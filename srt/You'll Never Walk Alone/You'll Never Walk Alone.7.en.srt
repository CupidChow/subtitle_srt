00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:54,670
Qiao Bin,

188
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,030
I'll take you to the beach tomorrow.

189
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,000
Loris

190
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,030
must have ulterior motives.

191
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:08,960
Thin about it.

192
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,550
We're both his employees.

193
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,440
Why do you live like a princess

194
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,350
with a coffee machine and a toaster

195
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,080
and I'm like a bum?

196
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,760
He's got feelings for you.

197
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,640
But I just asked around.

198
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,910
His last assistant lived here, too.

199
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:24,230
So I don't think he's trying to be nice.

200
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,550
But it's true that
your place is too shabby.

201
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,520
Did you offend him with what you said

202
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,400
when we first arrived?

203
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,320
I don't think so.

204
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,550
Why don't I talk to him for you?

205
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,520
No.

206
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,960
He's doing this to me

207
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,520
to force me to leave.

208
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,470
The more he wants me to leave,
the more I won't leave.

209
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,440
I'm going to piss him off.

210
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,960
Is this the same Hao Weilai who I know?

211
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,840
Yes, it's me.

212
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,350
Back then,

213
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,440
I thought we had to express

214
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,320
our sufferings.

215
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,590
Why should we bear it ourselves?

216
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,670
Now I'm enjoying

217
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,440
the feeling of suffering.

218
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,550
Xia Yuan,

219
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,710
is there something wrong with me?

220
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,760
Why am I into self-abuse now?

221
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,960
You've matured.

222
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,280
Mature?

223
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,590
But I'm still uneasy.

224
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:16,150
Personal assistant? How personal.

225
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,350
What do you have to do?

226
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,840
Didn't I show you the contract?

227
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,080
These are all very reasonable
job requirements.

228
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,710
Don't worry about it.

229
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,520
I'll protect myself.

230
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,590
Let's do this, then.

231
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:29,350
From now on,
you'll send me your location

232
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,960
every day, every hour.

233
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,440
I want to make sure you're safe.

234
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,640
Why?

235
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm not discussing with you,

236
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,230
I'm informing you.

237
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,470
Why?

238
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,840
Then, I'll call you

239
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,150
every hour to annoy the hell out of you.

240
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,670
I'll block your number, then.

241
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,110
If so, I'll...

242
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,520
Please.

243
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,230
Please.

244
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:00,760
Please.

245
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:20,120
[PLANJKA BEACH
HAVE A NICE DAY]

246
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,760
Ready? Three, two, one.

247
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,880
Hi, what are you doing?

248
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,590
I think they're doing the motor race.

249
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,670
The winner gets 1,000 Euro.

250
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,590
I see, thank you.

251
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,640
The prize money is 1,000 Euro.

252
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,000
1,000 Euro? Go.

253
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:45,320
Me?

254
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,280
Go.

255
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,150
Wait a minute.

256
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,470
And the time is 31 seconds.

257
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:58,640
Hey.

258
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,000
- Can I try?
- Yes, of course.

259
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,230
- What's your name?
- Ben.

260
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:03,960
Let's welcome Ben!

261
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,320
You can do it!

262
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:17,230
Ready? Three, two, one.

263
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:01,230
Great! Cool!

264
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,200
The time is 51 seconds.

265
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,670
Siqi.

266
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,910
Nice try, buddy.

267
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,280
Bye, guys. Bye!

268
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,080
Bye!

269
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,320
- See you guys.
- Anyone else?

270
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,470
You could finish all the food you're
given but you can't do anything well.

271
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:24,280
Go sit over there.

272
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,840
Listen to me, Siqi.

273
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:36,350
It's just that the waves are too big

274
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,280
and it's out of my control.

275
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,350
Hey, Ben. I was looking for you.

276
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,400
Why?

277
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,440
Even though you didn't win the race,

278
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,470
we still have a little souvenir for you.

279
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,670
Thank you.

280
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,110
Where are you from?

281
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:48,960
China.

282
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,910
From China?

283
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,350
What an amazing country.

284
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,760
Are you here for vacation?

285
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,150
Actually, I'm looking for a job.

286
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,960
We'd like manpower.

287
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,000
Are you interested in
the lifeguard position?

288
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,000
Of course.

289
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,150
But buddy,

290
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,550
I don't have a work visa.

291
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,710
That's not a problem.

292
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,110
You can work as a volunteer

293
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:07,910
on the beach.

294
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,880
I can provide food and accommodation.

295
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,790
Deal. Thanks.

296
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:11,710
No problem.

297
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,440
Sorry, sir.

298
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,280
Can I stay as well?

299
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,110
Yes, for sure.

300
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,710
The bar is in need of waiters.

301
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,440
It's perfect. Thank you.

302
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,840
My name is Jack.

303
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,150
I'm Kiki.

304
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:23,880
Okay, guys.

305
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,790
I'll wait for you at the bar.

306
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,350
Okay.

307
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,000
See you soon.

308
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,080
- Bye.
- See you later. Bye.

309
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,710
Bye.

310
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,150
Siqi,

311
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,150
Are you staying here to keep me company?

312
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,470
If not, why do you stay
and work as a waitress?

313
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,640
Yuan, I'll stay with Qiao Bin.

314
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,520
I'm afraid he'll die here.

315
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,520
I'm so kind.

316
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,790
Hopefully, I'll be able to
stop myself from scolding him.

317
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,230
What are you doing?

318
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,760
I'm peeking at your messages.

319
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,560
Why do you want to read my messages?

320
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,280
Didn't you say you were
going to have a meal?

321
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,560
Why didn't you tell me?

322
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,470
Why should I tell you

323
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,920
that we're going to have a meal?

324
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,280
I want to tag along.

325
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,430
Get back to your work.

326
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,190
I'm going to have a meal.

327
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,640
Get back to your work.

328
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,110
I'm going to have a meal.

329
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,470
Eat after you've finished your work.

330
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,920
I won't work if I don't eat.

331
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,070
I'll slack off.

332
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,710
If you don't work, you can't eat.

333
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,880
I won't work if I don't eat.

334
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,110
If you don't work, you can't eat.

335
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,800
I'm going to eat.

336
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Get back to your work.

337
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,110
Eat.

338
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,000
Work.

339
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,430
Quick.

340
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,350
Hurry up.

341
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:25,640
Come on, again.

342
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,950
Siqi.

343
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,070
That's right.

344
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,520
- Again.
- One more round.

345
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,590
I'll take the call.

346
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,110
Hello, Loris.

347
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,830
Xia Yuan.

348
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,880
There's a party tonight.

349
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,760
Do you want to come with me?

350
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,160
I'm out with friends today,

351
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,470
so I won't be there.

352
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,000
A lot of people are
coming to the party tonight.

353
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,280
Maybe you can ask around

354
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,830
about Song Hangyu.

355
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:12,880
All right, then.

356
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,830
I'll come over and meet you.

357
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,000
Send me the address.

358
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,110
Okay.

359
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,190
See you later.

360
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,000
What's it?

361
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,640
Loris invited me to a dinner party

362
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,230
and said I might get
some news about Song Hangyu.

363
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,920
I can't play with you guys.

364
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,230
I'm sorry.

365
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,590
Don't feel sorry about it.

366
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,310
You wouldn't leave us

367
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,430
if you didn't have something
important to do, right?

368
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,040
However,

369
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,040
you still have to watch out for Loris.

370
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,760
As usual,

371
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,110
send me your location
when you've arrived

372
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,560
and keep in touch.

373
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,040
Don't ever be alone with him.

374
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,430
I'll get going now, then.

375
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,310
Have fun.

376
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,760
Bye.

377
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,680
Continue.

378
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,110
Are you regretting

379
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,880
telling her about him?

380
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,400
Not really.

381
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,680
Well,

382
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,950
I don't think Loris

383
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,110
is a good person.

384
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,070
He's been treating Xia Yuan
like a secretary,

385
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,830
and I'm worried about her every day.

386
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,310
It's true,

387
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,800
I also think Loris

388
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,880
has some ill intentions
towards my sister.

389
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,830
Right?

390
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,310
You're smart for once.

391
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,230
Come on, give me five.

392
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,190
What five?

393
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,190
Don't get involved.

394
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,520
You have no idea.

395
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,640
It's a hunch.

396
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,070
Anyway, Hao Weilai,

397
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,760
you must protect my sister,

398
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,830
got it?

399
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,880
Don't worry,

400
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,350
I won't let her get hurt.

401
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:50,000
Besides, I've seen
all sorts of scoundrels.

402
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,830
Deal with him.

403
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,400
Deal with him. Come on.

404
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,350
Deal with him.

405
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,920
Loris, nice to meet you.

406
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,560
- And your name?
- Xia Yuan.

407
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,310
Nice to meet you.

408
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,590
Please sit down.

409
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,110
Long time no see.

410
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:22,560
Great place you've got here. Vert nice.

411
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,350
Thank you. Small change.

412
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:25,830
Thank you.

413
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,680
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

414
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,520
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

415
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,400
So, I heard you've
got a new partner now.

416
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,190
I thought everything's good between us.

417
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,640
Loris,

418
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,230
our partnership has been great.

419
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:48,400
But you never change your prices.

420
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,230
Business is business.

421
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:52,560
If someone gives me
a better opportunity,

422
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,880
I'll take it.

423
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,310
I hope you understand.

424
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,160
May I ask

425
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,190
your new business partner

426
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,760
is that Chinese guy, Mr. Xu?

427
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,230
That's right.

428
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:07,400
You know the Chinese are
doing very good business now.

429
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,230
And I think it's a good time to start

430
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,680
working with them.

431
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,830
Got it.

432
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,070
Sir,

433
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,680
Mr. Xu has arrived.

434
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,190
Please bring him here.

435
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:20,230
Excuse me, I have to leave now.

436
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,760
Please enjoy your drink.

437
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,230
Mr. Xu,

438
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:26,310
it's my pleasure to see you here.

439
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,760
I've been waiting for you a long time.

440
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,760
Thank you.

441
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,190
Mr. Xu,

442
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,070
you took my client.

443
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:36,070
I don't think that's
the right thing to do.

444
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:38,110
You're in the business world.
The fittest survive.

445
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,680
You have to blame yourself

446
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,310
for the loss of your own clients.

447
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,920
You're going

448
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,800
to pay for this.

449
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,920
Mr. Xu, let's talk about

450
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,880
our business here.

451
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,710
Please.

452
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:06,950
Loris,

453
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,470
are you all right?

454
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,640
I'm fine. Sit down.

455
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,800
Is that person

456
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,000
your competitor?

457
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,950
Yes.

458
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,400
He's the most prominent chairman

459
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,760
of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce here.

460
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,880
Do you want me to
stay and talk with you?

461
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,000
It's okay.

462
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,280
I'll be fine for a bit on my own.

463
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,040
All right.

464
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,280
I'll be back in a minute.

465
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,680
Hi.

466
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:03,920
Hi.

467
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:06,350
Are you Mr. Xu?

468
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:08,040
Yes.

469
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,230
Are you from China?

470
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:10,000
Yes.

471
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,710
I'm Chinese. My name is Xia Yuan.

472
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,640
I'm here to look for
a Chinese friend of mine.

473
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,520
I heard you're the chairman of
the Chinese Chamber of Commerce.

474
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,640
I wonder if you've ever met him.

475
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,110
He's also Chinese,

476
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:22,350
Song Hangyu. Have you ever met him?

477
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,070
No.

478
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,070
Anyway,

479
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,640
wait a minute.

480
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,350
Here's my business card.

481
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,920
If you need any help here,

482
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,760
give me a call.

483
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,560
Okay.

484
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,040
Mr. Xu,

485
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,280
this is my contact details.

486
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,950
If you have any news of him,

487
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:45,920
please let me know.

488
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,880
Sure.

489
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,430
Excuse me, may I ask you

490
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:54,190
if you're here with Mr. Loris?

491
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,920
I'm his new personal assistant.

492
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,880
As someone experienced in the field,

493
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,160
I'd like to give you a little advice.

494
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,160
According to what I know about him,

495
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,710
he has character problems.

496
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:08,760
I hope you will

497
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,830
pay special attention when
you are in touch with him

498
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,400
in the future.

499
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,110
All right. Thank you.

500
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,280
All right. That's it.

501
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,400
Let's get in touch by phone, then.

502
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:16,950
Thank you.

503
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:17,920
All right. Goodbye.

504
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,430
Goodbye.

505
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,400
(Should I trust Mr. Xu,)

506
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,880
(Loris?)

507
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,880
Shall I walk you in?

508
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,000
It's all right. Thank you.

509
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,230
I can walk in by myself.

510
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:26,760
What are you doing?

511
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,470
I'm looking at the stars.

512
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,400
Ms. Xia,

513
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,880
you're finally back.

514
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,760
What kind of party
was you having so much fun at?

515
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,190
You're back so late.

516
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,680
It's cold at night.

517
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,230
Let's go.

518
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,430
You don't even put on a jacket

519
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:04,230
when you're so thinly clad.

520
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,310
You'll get rheumatism in your old age.

521
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,280
Thank you.

522
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,040
What are you doing?

523
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,590
Did you drink?

524
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:33,470
Did he make you drink?

525
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:35,520
No, I just had a couple of sips.

526
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,000
He didn't make me drink.

527
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,160
So what did you find out?

528
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:46,110
I told you he tricked you, didn't I?

529
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,590
Did he make a pass at you?

530
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:49,590
You're so good at shoulder throw.

531
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:51,040
Why didn't you throw him down?

532
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,680
It's not as exaggerated
as you make it out to be.

533
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,430
He didn't do anything to me.

534
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,400
I didn't do anything to you,

535
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,470
but you threw me down.

536
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:59,310
You just won't throw him down, will you?

537
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,110
I'm so pissed off.

538
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,350
Goodnight.

539
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,000
Loris,

540
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,710
here's the report
you need for the meeting.

541
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:35,880
It's all ready.

542
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,070
Thank you.

543
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,880
Loris.

544
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,190
Loris.

545
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,520
I'd like to

546
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,640
ask you a favour.

547
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,800
Go ahead.

548
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,800
You said

549
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,590
Song Hangyu worked at your company.

550
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,000
I am wondering if I can

551
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,070
go to the staff records room

552
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,520
to see if there's any files

553
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,070
or other information on him.

554
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:03,400
We haven't sorted out
the staff records yet.

555
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,830
And you know,

556
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,400
it's been a long time.

557
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,280
You might not be able to find it.

558
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:08,920
I know

559
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,640
I'm making a presumptuous request.

560
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,000
But this is something

561
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,280
that's really important to me.

562
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,640
I won't bother anyone else.

563
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,280
I'll find it myself.

564
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:20,520
Okay.

565
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,520
I'll get Tom

566
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,760
to take you there later.

567
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,040
Thank you. Sorry to bother you.

568
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,280
Thank you.

569
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,520
Xia Yuan, what brings you here?

570
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,040
I'm here to see if there's
any files on Song Hangyu.

571
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Listen,

572
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,830
don't slack off.

573
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,880
Keep working, okay?

574
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:56,070
Which one of your eyes
saw me slacking off?

575
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,880
Why don't I help you find it?

576
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,640
Sure.

577
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,560
Can you check

578
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,880
if there's a contact number

579
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,880
or home address of him?

580
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,640
Why don't I move it down?

581
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,280
How many?

582
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,350
One, please.

583
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:42,710
Here you go.

584
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:43,830
Thank you.

585
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,590
Thank you.

586
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,350
- Hello.
- Hello.

587
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,190
One fries, please.

588
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:50,430
Okay.

589
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,280
Thank you.

590
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,680
How many?

591
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,830
Two of them, please.

592
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:03,590
Okay.

593
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:06,040
My name is David.

594
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:08,430
Nice to meet you.

595
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:09,640
Nice to meet you, too.

596
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,640
My name is Kiki.

597
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:14,470
Thank you.

598
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,680
Have you found anything?

599
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,400
No.

600
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,430
We've looked through so many files

601
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:27,830
and there's no information
on Sung Hangyu at all.

602
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,000
Loris must be lying to you.

603
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,470
Lie to me?

604
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,190
Why would he lie to me?

605
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:37,040
He gave me a job

606
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,230
and a place to live.

607
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,280
What's he got on us
that's worth cheating on?

608
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,160
But if such a big company

609
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,520
can't even organize its information well

610
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,950
and a person's information
can't be found,

611
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:47,710
what is it if he's not lying to you?

612
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,590
Maybe there's too much stuff.

613
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,640
Keep searching.

614
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,800
Did you search that box?

615
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,470
That one in there.

616
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:00,830
No.

617
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:16,590
[JET SKI PANCAKE BAR]

618
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,400
Help!

619
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,160
Help!

620
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,710
Help!

621
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,310
Help!

622
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:45,680
Oh, no.

623
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,190
Help!

624
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,920
What's going on? Is she okay?

625
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:44,350
- She's all right.
- Is she okay?

626
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:46,430
Luckily, you're awake.

627
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,230
Xia Yuan.

628
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,230
Yes?

629
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,430
There's something in your hair.

630
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:16,520
Thank you.

631
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,630
Come. Let's go work.

632
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:51,560
Everything must be here tomorrow.

633
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,630
Okay?

634
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:53,710
Do it.

635
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,000
Stop.

636
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,910
Stop, stop.

637
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:58,600
What are you doing?

638
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,520
That's fragile.

639
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,390
You have to lift it up.

640
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:04,190
Come on, lift it up.

641
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:07,560
It's fragile. Come on.

642
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,710
Like a lady. Go, go, go!

643
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,950
Hurry up!

644
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,760
Go, go, go!

645
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,760
Want a hand?

646
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,910
Go! Hurry up!

647
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:41,710
Why aren't you wearing uniform?

648
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,120
You didn't give it to me.

649
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,120
Oh, really?

650
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:46,360
I need to go now.

651
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,670
Why?

652
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,630
I've finished my work today.

653
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,840
You haven't finished it.

654
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,230
There are more to do.

655
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,800
Now, go back.

656
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,040
Okay.

657
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,760
You don't have to pay me today.

658
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,280
Come back! Hey!

659
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,470
Here you go.

660
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:14,950
Thank you.

661
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:15,870
Warm up with a cup of coffee.

662
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,430
Are you all right?

663
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:20,630
I'm feeling much better.

664
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:27,950
Thank you for saving me today.

665
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,560
If it wasn't for you,

666
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,150
I don't know what would have happened.

667
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,430
It's all right.

668
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:33,950
This is my job.

669
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,630
How come you speak Chinese so well?

670
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,600
I majored in Chinese in college.

671
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,520
No wonder.

672
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:45,120
All right.

673
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,120
Well, you rest here.

674
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,760
I have to go. I have work to do.

675
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:50,040
I'm sorry.

676
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,150
Well,

677
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:54,190
can I buy you a meal?

678
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,320
Buy me a meal?

679
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,360
Forget it. I have
something to attend to.

680
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,870
Thank you.

681
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,600
Hello.

682
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:44,040
Hello.

683
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,150
You're Chinese?

684
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,230
Yes.

685
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:50,910
Mister, what are you doing?

686
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,470
You're banging the trunk
of the tree and it's going bald.

687
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,280
I am indeed banging the tree.

688
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,910
It's a great way to
stimulate my acupoints

689
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:00,430
and get my mind and body to relax.

690
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,630
It feels good.

691
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,360
Do you want to try it?

692
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,710
How's it?

693
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:23,950
I think

694
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:26,710
there's a chance the meridians
could be unblocked.

695
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:29,600
But people's acupoints are in points.

696
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,760
How can you press

697
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,560
on the acupoints when
you're hitting only the surface?

698
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,390
Moreover,

699
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:35,630
there are many acupoints in the human
body that should not be pressed lightly.

700
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:37,950
If you don't control the strength,
you'll hurt your body.

701
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,360
I didn't expect you
to talk so much sense

702
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,840
at such a young age.

703
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,840
So, tell me,

704
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,630
what are the best exercises

705
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,910
for someone my age?

706
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,670
I recently saw one on the Internet.

707
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,430
It's supposed to be a good exercise.

708
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,630
Show me how to do it.

709
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,390
Isn't that a dog crawl?

710
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:17,670
It's called the atavism exercise.

711
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:19,670
If you do it in the right way,

712
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:21,560
it can help your back,
neck and shoulders,

713
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,520
and also prevent cardiovascular disease.

714
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,190
Atavism exercise?

715
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,190
All right.

716
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Let me try it.

717
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,080
Come on.

718
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,840
Mr. Xu,

719
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,280
get up.

720
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,080
What are you doing?

721
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:40,670
Isn't it ridiculous?

722
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,880
This young man says

723
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,950
it's the atavism exercise.

724
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,430
Got it?

725
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,710
This exercise

726
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:51,190
is good for the
shoulders, neck and spine

727
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,520
and prevents cardiovascular disease,

728
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,040
right?

729
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:54,840
Yes.

730
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:55,600
Do you want to...

731
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,630
No.

732
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:58,800
Let me massage you.

733
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:02,390
It feels so good.

734
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:04,040
I'm ashamed to say

735
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,470
that my own son
has never given me a massage.

736
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:08,800
I have never massaged my dad either.

737
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,040
Is that so?

738
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,190
Young man, what's your name?

739
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:14,320
Hao Weilai.

740
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,560
Weilai.

741
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,430
What a good name.

742
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:19,320
The future is promising.

743
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,120
What about you?

744
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:21,800
Me?

745
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,190
I'm Xu Youzhi.

746
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:25,280
Hi, let's be friends.

747
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:26,430
Will you come here

748
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:28,560
every day from now on?

749
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:30,080
I don't come here often.

750
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:31,710
I was just passing by this park today.

751
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,520
What a pity.

752
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,280
Then, I'll be the only one
crawling here every day,

753
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,520
others

754
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,910
won't know what's going on.

755
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,000
You'd better come here every day.

756
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,430
You can teach me

757
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:42,470
and

758
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:45,280
you can exercise with me.

759
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:46,520
Okay.

760
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,910
I'll come and exercise
with you more often

761
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:49,800
so you won't feel awkward.

762
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,670
Okay, it's decided, then.

763
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:52,670
Okay.

764
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,150
Thank you.

765
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:54,630
Let's continue.

766
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:55,560
Okay.

767
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:57,080
All right.

768
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:57,600
Mr. Xu.

769
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:58,950
Be careful.

770
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:01,800
Spread your arms and legs.

771
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,670
Okay.

772
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:08,000
Take it easy.

773
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,840
How's it?

774
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:11,000
There's no one else around, is there?

775
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:12,190
Be careful.

776
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,080
Siqi.

777
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:19,760
Siqi.

778
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:21,760
What did I do wrong again?

779
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,080
How dare you ask me?

780
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,800
I know, Siqi.

781
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,760
Are you jealous?

782
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:30,630
I'm telling you,
today was a real accident.

783
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:31,520
I had to take special measures
to deal with this unusual situation.

784
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,320
That's mu job.

785
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,840
Qiao Bin, let me remind you

786
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,190
that we're divorced.

787
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:39,000
We have nothing to do with each other.

788
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:39,800
I won't stand in your way

789
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,230
if you're in love.

790
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,670
No, Siqi. Don't say that...

791
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:43,630
Hi.

792
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:45,800
I'm sorry to bother you.

793
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,630
Look,

794
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,150
your girl is here.

795
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:51,600
Siqi!

796
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,800
Ye Siqi!

797
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:54,120
Ben,

798
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,670
thanks you for saving me today.

799
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:58,390
I came to invite you to dinner.

800
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:03,760
Would you accept the invitation?

801
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:16,040
Come in.

802
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,000
So, you're here.

803
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,320
I bought you some food.

804
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,040
You haven't eaten, have you?

805
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,320
You still remember me, huh?

806
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,840
What nonsense are you talking about?

807
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,080
Nothing.

808
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,630
When I'm alone for a long time,

809
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:35,840
I have to learn to talk to myself,

810
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,390
or I'll die of boredom.

811
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:39,390
It's all right. I'm fine.

812
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,230
All right.

813
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:43,430
Since you're fine,

814
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:44,870
I'm leaving now.

815
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:46,230
