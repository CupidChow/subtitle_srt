00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,320
Do you want water, Xia Yuan?

191
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,320
Let me pour you a glass of water.

192
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,120
Sure.

193
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,920
Me too.

194
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,480
Let's go.

195
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:32,920
Take a look.

196
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,800
All is good.

197
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,080
Thank you so much

198
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,960
for delivering them to my house.

199
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,320
Not at all.

200
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,640
You're our VIP.

201
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,160
We must deliver your order in person.

202
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,080
Besides,
our clients give us a lot of feedback

203
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,440
when we deliver the wine to their house.

204
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,800
It helps us to improve.

205
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,200
Why don't you stay here for a while?

206
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:54,840
Sure.

207
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,240
Sir, your breakfast.

208
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,160
Thank you.

209
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,720
Do you want some?

210
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,520
No, thanks.

211
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,520
Xia Yuan is here.

212
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,000
She'll take care of me.

213
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,160
Oh, Mr. Wei.

214
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,960
We came to deliver the wine to you

215
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,840
and to invite you and Siqi

216
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,720
to our Christmas party in the winery.

217
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,600
That's right.

218
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,400
Sure.

219
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,200
It will be a very special Christmas!

220
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,200
Uhm,

221
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,720
I have several business parties
on Christmas

222
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,480
so...

223
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,720
So you have
to seek refuge in the winery.

224
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,320
Right?

225
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,160
Come, Xia Yuan.

226
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,640
This is my room.

227
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,640
Do you like it?

228
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,680
So this is your cozy room.

229
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,480
Mhm.

230
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,200
Take a seat, Xia Yuan.

231
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,400
It's very homely.

232
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,320
You bought the plushies for yourself?

233
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,400
No, Mr. Wei gave them to me.

234
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,040
He is very nice to you.

235
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,000
It's all right.

236
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,520
Where do his other assistants live?

237
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,840
He doesn't have any other assistants.

238
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,880
Only me.

239
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,120
Only you?

240
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,600
So no one comes here at all?

241
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,600
No.

242
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,520
Hmm.

243
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,280
Siqi.

244
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,080
I know

245
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,880
Mr. Wei is a gentleman.

246
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,680
But

247
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,800
uhm,

248
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,400
maybe I'm overthinking it,

249
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,160
but you were living abroad

250
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,400
for a long time.

251
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,440
And now, you're living with Mr. Wei.

252
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,960
Just take care of yourself
and be safe, okay?

253
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,440
Xia Yuan,

254
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,200
you are reading way too much into it.

255
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,840
You don't know Mr. Wei at all.

256
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,520
You see, he's like a robot.

257
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,720
He wakes up early every morning to jog.

258
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,560
And at a specific time at night,
he switches off the light.

259
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,880
He cuts off the light and the internet
for the entire house.

260
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,360
Also, I noticed lately

261
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,320
that he is quite masochistic.

262
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,480
He and I are impossible.

263
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,480
Impossible.

264
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,240
But you

265
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,480
get along very well with Mr. Wei.

266
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,000
Way too well.

267
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,080
It doesn't even feel
like you're working for him.

268
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,240
Are you into Mr. Wei?

269
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,040
Xia Yuan! What are you on about?

270
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,360
You're too imaginative.

271
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,400
Just admit it already.
No need to deny it.

272
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,600
I do think Mr. Wei is

273
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,160
reliable and polite.

274
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,880
If you want to pursue him,

275
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,280
you'll have my full support.

276
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:47,960
But...

277
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,800
All right, Xia Yuan.

278
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,080
Listen.

279
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,000
You're very young.

280
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,920
You're reckless in your decision.

281
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,200
Look at you and Qiao Bin.

282
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,440
You married him hastily.

283
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,960
Then, you got a divorce.

284
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,000
A messy divorce too.

285
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,080
When it comes to relationships,
you must be serious.

286
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,360
Before you make a decision...

287
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,480
All right.

288
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,600
I get it, Xia Yuan.

289
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,240
Just relax.

290
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,080
You still won't admit it,

291
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,320
even though you like him a lot.

292
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,720
You'll never admit everything.

293
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,800
Xia Yuan.

294
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,760
We have stayed
in Europe for six months now.

295
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,600
So many things have happened,

296
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,840
things that I never imagined
would happen to me.

297
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,760
It's not just you.

298
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,280
I too didn't expect

299
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,560
things to deviate

300
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,280
from what I originally

301
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,000
planned.

302
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,320
Are you still counting down?

303
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,800
Are you disappointed then?

304
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,400
Disappointed?

305
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,160
It's more like I'm at peace.

306
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,320
I know

307
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,600
what I want now.

308
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,080
I have made up my mind.

309
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,760
I'll live for myself.

310
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,120
Well done, Xia Yuan.

311
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,360
I'm so glad to hear this from you.

312
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,840
Stop it.

313
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,400
They have been talking for a while now.

314
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:40,960
Yeah.

315
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,240
You can watch the TV.

316
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,080
Sure.

317
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,040
(In many documentaries
about mother nature,)

318
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,400
(we see how tigers and leopards)

319
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,000
(prey on the herbivores.)

320
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,680
Mr. Wei,

321
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,960
you watch Animal Planet?

322
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,480
Me too.

323
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,560
No, I don't watch it.

324
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,800
(Among the insects,)

325
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,320
(one is particularly vicious.)

326
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,640
Let's switch the channel.

327
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,560
It's okay. You can watch it.

328
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,720
(A heavy rain has just doused)

329
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,480
(a serene forest)

330
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,240
(in Gaowangjie, Xiangxi.)

331
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,000
(The air is very fresh.)

332
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,440
Thank you, Mr. Wei.

333
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,320
Do visit me often.

334
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,200
Sure.

335
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,040
I'll miss you, Xia Yuan.

336
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,680
- Hello?
- We'll celebrate Christmas soon.

337
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,920
I'll be there.

338
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,840
Wonderful.

339
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,720
Okay.

340
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,720
What's the matter?

341
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,760
Mischief Man called me

342
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,600
and said that Loris was arrested.

343
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,840
We can finally put our minds to rest.

344
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,480
Finally, no more walking on thin ice.

345
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,480
Mischief Man, what are you doing?

346
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,000
Put it down.

347
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,160
The elderly shouldn't drink.

348
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,760
You're old.

349
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,640
Let me spare you from this torture.

350
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,240
Hey!

351
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,680
Do you stop your dad

352
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,320
from drinking like this too?

353
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,520
I tried,

354
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,160
but he wouldn't listen to me.

355
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,000
My dad and I are like that.

356
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,680
We care about each other

357
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,400
but we will never admit it.

358
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,240
Why?

359
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,320
Hui tried to stop you from drinking,

360
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,840
and you refused to listen to him too?

361
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,360
Well,

362
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,760
when Zhen was alive,

363
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,280
I didn't drink.

364
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,760
After Hui moved out,

365
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,200
I began drinking.

366
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,240
This winery

367
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,400
was Zhen's dream.

368
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,360
I built it for her.

369
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,760
After the winery was constructed,

370
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,760
I devoted a lot of time

371
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,440
and effort on it.

372
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,920
After Zhen passed away,

373
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,000
I figure that I

374
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,240
should pass down

375
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,040
the winery

376
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,240
to Hui when I join Zhen later,
as a memento, you know?

377
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,600
So that's why you stay in this winery

378
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,080
even though you have
a business empire out there.

379
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,600
Does Hui know?

380
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,920
Don't worry.

381
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,760
He'll come around eventually.

382
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,240
Thanks.

383
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,200
Thank you.

384
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,560
Speaking of,

385
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,760
Hui told me that he would come back
and show me his cooking.

386
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,680
When is he coming back?

387
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,120
He already did that.

388
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,800
You tried his cooking?

389
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,840
I did?

390
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,120
Don't lie to me.

391
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,880
Let me jog your memory.

392
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,120
That day, he cooked Gong Bao Chicken.

393
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,840
He also told you

394
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,280
to cut down

395
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,560
on oily food.

396
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,960
Do you recall it now?

397
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,280
Can you recall it?

398
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,040
Look at me.

399
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,320
My son cooked something for me

400
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,320
for the first time in his life.

401
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,600
How could I forget about it?

402
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,400
I had his cooking.
And I forgot about it.

403
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,320
What's wrong with my brain?

404
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,680
But you recalled it, didn't you?

405
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,200
He's going to cook for you every day.

406
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:00,960
Okay.

407
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:05,840
Okay.

408
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,000
Thank you.

409
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,840
Thank you.

410
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,760
Higher.

411
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,280
A bit higher.

412
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:39,920
Is it good now?

413
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,640
Higher.

414
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,360
Here.

415
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:13,680
This side.

416
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,080
You mean

417
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,520
everyone
has to prepare a Christmas gift?

418
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,280
Well, yes.

419
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,200
That's how you celebrate Christmas.

420
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,360
What do you think, Mischief Man?

421
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,880
Mischief man?

422
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,320
What?

423
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,720
Weilai

424
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,680
wants everyone

425
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,800
to prepare a Christmas present.

426
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,680
We'll pool all the presents

427
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,640
and at night, we will have a lucky draw,

428
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,080
including Hui.

429
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,080
Sure.

430
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,680
Since we're having this party anyway,

431
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,760
just do what you want to do.

432
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,400
Let's get a gift.

433
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,680
Okay.

434
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,920
Weilai, can we talk?

435
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:55,880
Xia,

436
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,280
can you talk to Hui again

437
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,400
and ask him to come?

438
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,440
Mr. Xu.

439
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,400
Hui already said yes.

440
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,200
Really?

441
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,000
Wonderful. That's amazing.

442
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,720
Let's prepare the gift now.

443
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,320
Let's go.

444
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,800
What does she look like?

445
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,320
She

446
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,680
is pretty.

447
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,480
She has bright eyes.

448
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:39,040
And she has white skin.

449
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,160
And...

450
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,800
We need more specific characteristics.

451
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,320
Like what kind of personality
does she have?

452
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,040
What does she like?

453
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,240
How do you feel when you look at her?

00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:58,670

I can hardly recognize my winery now.

474
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,720
After Zhen passed away,

475
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,240
this place has never been this lively.

476
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,400
Come.

477
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,240
Wow.

478
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,480
You guys

479
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,760
thought everything through.

480
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:01,920
Good job.

481
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,840
Thank you so much.

482
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,640
Mr. Xu.

483
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,680
The guests have arrived.

484
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,480
Hi, Mr. Xu.

485
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,240
Siqi.

486
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,560
Hello.

487
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,560
Mr. Xu, this is your Christmas gift.

488
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,440
Thank you.

489
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,800
Let me take it.

490
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,160
Thanks.

491
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:13,680
Mr. Xu.

492
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,720
Merry Christmas.

493
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,560
Merry Christmas.

494
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,400
You are...

495
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,600
Mr. Xu, you have met him before.

496
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,680
Right, you're her uncle.

497
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,640
No, he's my boss.

498
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,440
Sorry.

499
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:29,800
Right.

500
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,960
So much food!

501
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,920
Help yourself. Help yourself.

502
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,360
Okay.

503
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,200
Oh, goodness.

504
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,600
Mr. Wei, it's so beautiful here.

505
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,480
Can you take a photo of me?

506
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,080
Hurry.

507
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,400
Hurry!

508
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:51,760
Done.

509
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,280
Another one.

510
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,680
Done.

511
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,880
Let me see.

512
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,280
That's so ugly.

513
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,160
The party hasn't even begun yet.
Don't eat this much.

514
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,600
Mr. Wei,

515
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,080
this is my first Christmas abroad.

516
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,920
I'm just too excited.

517
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,360
Let me take a photo.

518
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,200
Mr. Wei.

519
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,800
Let's take a selfie together.

520
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,800
Come. Take this.

521
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,600
Okay.

522
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,000
Higher. It's not in the frame.

523
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,800
Say cheese.

524
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,880
Come. Put this on.

525
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,120
Happy holidays.

526
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,640
- This is so cute.
- How do I put it on?

527
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,400
Like this.

528
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,080
Put it on like this.

529
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:55,840
I'll put it on.

530
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,120
It looks good on you.

531
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,520
Put this on.

532
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,880
I want this one. And this one.

533
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,440
Come.

534
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,040
- Thanks, Quan.
- You're welcome.

535
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,640
Scar, Biao. Come.

536
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,040
Mr. Wei.

537
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,880
You can't take it off.

538
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,240
Legend has it

539
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,920
that if you wear
antlers during Christmas,

540
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,640
you won't feel lost
in the following year.

541
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,120
I'm sure I won't feel lost without it.

542
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,480
Mr. Wei, put it on for me.

543
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,240
Quick.

544
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,560
How?

545
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,680
Put it here.

546
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:28,800
Don't move.

547
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,400
Turn around.

548
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:34,800
Done.

549
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,160
Let's take a selfie together. Come.

550
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,400
One, two, three. Say cheese.

551
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,320
Done.

552
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,960
- Am I...
- How do I look?

553
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,600
You doofus.

554
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,680
You put it on the wrong way.

555
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,360
Your phone is ringing.

556
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,440
Do I look like a wolf?

557
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,080
No.

558
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:55,920
No?

559
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,080
Xia Yuan.

560
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,760
Mr. Xu, we have to go.

561
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,000
Don't let me keep you.

562
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,880
Mr. Xu. Mr. Xu.

563
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,680
Does he not look like a mouse?

564
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,400
He looks like a Minotaur.

565
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,560
Why are you touching up on your makeup?

566
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,400
Are you nervous?

567
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,120
I have never seen you panic before.

568
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,480
Is meeting my sister that nerve-racking?

569
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,640
What are you on about?

570
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,280
Can't I fix my makeup during Christmas?

571
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:36,720
She's here.

572
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:37,680
Where?

573
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,360
Over there.

574
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,280
Long time no see, Penny.

575
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,000
Weilai.

576
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,960
It's been a while.

577
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,440
You're heavier than before.

578
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,520
Bugger off.

579
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,440
Hi, Penny. I'm Xia Yuan.

580
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,560
Hi, Xia Yuan.

581
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,240
I'm Penny.

582
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,640
I have heard good things about you.

583
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,720
Me too.

584
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,960
Weilai keeps telling me about you.

585
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,040
And from what he told me, I know

586
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:08,920
I'll like you.

587
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,920
I didn't tell you about her.

588
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,640
Don't make things up.

589
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,040
The party is over there?

590
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,680
Come.

591
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,440
Let's go.

592
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,240
Mr. Wei, try this.

593
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,360
This is very delicious.

594
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,200
Enjoy.

595
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,320
Why aren't you eating anything?

596
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:30,920
You'll enjoy the dinner.

597
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,400
Okay.

598
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,360
Hi.

599
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,560
Hi, everyone.

600
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,280
I invited someone from China

601
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,520
to celebrate
this special occasion with us.

602
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,320
She's my sister,

603
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,720
a famous singer, Penny.

604
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,200
Hi, everyone. I'm Penny.

605
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,080
I'm glad to be here

606
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,480
to celebrate Christmas Eve with you.

607
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,120
You sound way too formal.

608
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,640
Welcome.

609
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,560
Welcome, Penny.

610
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,920
Welcome.

611
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,480
Penny, we have met before.

612
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,480
Do you remember me?

613
00:29:59,240 --> 00:29:59,840
Oh?

614
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,240
That day, we...

615
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,080
I recall it now.

616
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,640
I changed my schedule all of a sudden

617
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,240
and you...

618
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,120
Yes!

619
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,600
I'm so sorry about that.

620
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,520
It's okay.

621
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,520
You're not at fault.

622
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,120
Sorry.

623
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,640
Come.

624
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,680
Put it here.

625
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,960
Long time no see.

626
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,000
Indeed.

627
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,160
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

628
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,720
It's been many years

629
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,280
and you haven't changed a bit.

630
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,280
It's been many years

631
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,000
and you have changed a lot.

632
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,120
You look younger now.

633
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,400
I take what I said back.

634
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,040
You have become better at flattery.

635
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:06,880
Oh.

636
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,280
What brought you here to Europe?

637
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,640
Why? Can't I be here?

638
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,040
Your head accessories

639
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,240
are quite festive.

640
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,320
It's Christmas.

641
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,400
I'm here in Europe to shoot

642
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,480
my music video.

643
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,440
I see.

644
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,880
If you need my help,

645
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,080
let me know.

646
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,500
[Marry Christmas]

647
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,680
Nice.

648
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,600
- Cute.
- I love it.

649
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,120
It's cute.

650
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,080
Penny bought it.

651
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,760
Okay.

652
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,240
I see you unbox the cake.

653
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,280
Xia,

654
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,880
is Hui coming or not?

655
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,160
Don't worry, Mr. Xu.

656
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,400
He'll be here.

657
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,360
Okay.

658
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,600
Eat something.

659
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,720
You should eat too.

660
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,520
He isn't here yet.

661
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,400
Who are we waiting for?

662
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,360
His son.

663
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,840
Can you check on the head accessory?

664
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,120
Quan.

665
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,080
Wait. Wait a little longer.

666
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,960
A bit to the side.

667
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,200
Mr. Xu, look.

668
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,800
Look who's here.

669
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,600
Dad.

670
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,760
I'm back for Christmas.

671
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,840
Hui.

672
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,760
You're back.

673
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,200
Yes, I'm back.

674
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,680
Take a seat.

675
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,120
Come. Sit down.

676
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,480
Quan, let's begin.

677
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,360
All right.

678
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:23,200
Everyone's here.

679
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,640
The Christmas Eve Party

680
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,160
starts now.

681
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,920
Raise your glass come.

682
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,400
- Okay.
- Come.

683
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:33,360
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

684
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,400
Thank you for looking after

685
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,000
Weilai in Europe.

686
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
We're cousins.

687
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,040
But when we were little,

688
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,720
we lived together.

689
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,960
He's like a younger brother to me.

690
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,760
So thank you.

691
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,400
Thanks, Penny.

692
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,560
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

693
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,240
Come.

694
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,480
Sit down.

695
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,800
Hui,

696
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,600
Penny brought

697
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,400
this cake here.

698
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,120
Ever since you were little,

699
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,400
you love chocolate cakes.

700
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,600
But your mom

701
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,320
wouldn't let you have it

702
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,520
because it's bad for your health.

703
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,280
I bought chocolate cakes
for you in secret many times

704
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,480
but your mom always caught me.

705
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,880
And she would give me an earful.

706
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,280
- You're a grown-up now.
- Put it on.

707
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,200
So today,

708
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,320
you can have it to your heart's

709
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,000
content.

710
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,560
Do you know?

711
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,920
In high school, Weilai

712
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,720
helped me get rid of my clingy admirers.

713
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:38,080
And in university,

714
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,600
he tried to beat my toxic exes.

715
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,560
But he

716
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,240
never won, of course.

717
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,400
How many toxic exes did you have?

718
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,440
How dare you speak to me in that tone?

719
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,680
I became busier

720
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,040
so we couldn't hang out
as much as before.

721
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,520
However, whenever I hold a concert,

722
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,960
the biggest floral stand,
without mistake,

723
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,240
always come from him.

724
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,400
The paparazzi then thinks

725
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,800
that I have a lover boy.

726
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,080
They were

727
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,080
talking about him.

728
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,440
Needless to say,

729
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,200
I

730
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,160
will be her lover boy forever

731
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,600
so that she can never find a boyfriend.

732
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,800
Hao Weilai, I am interested

733
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,320
in reading that particular article.

734
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,440
I'll let you in on another secret.

735
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,080
Tell me.

736
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,280
Hao Weilai

737
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,760
began confessing

738
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,960
to girls

739
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,280
when he was in third grade.

740
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,360
Hao Weilai.

741
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,400
You're awfully talkative today.

742
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,000
Sing for us.

743
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,840
Sing for us. Sing for us.

744
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,920
Sing.

745
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,560
Come.

746
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:50,640
Sing. Sing. Sing.

747
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,880
All right, I'll entertain you tonight.

748
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:53,720
Nice.

749
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:03,840
