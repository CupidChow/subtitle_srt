29
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,960
I didn't expect Mr. Tang
to be this kind of person.

30
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,440
It was Mr. Tang who spread the news

31
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,800
about your wedding being canceled
in the company on purpose.

32
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,800
That's impossible.

33
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,880
He comforted me yesterday

34
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,400
and even gave me a day off.

35
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,120
He didn't even blame me

36
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,360
for losing my composure
during the meeting that day.

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,080
Mr. Tang is quite smitten with you.

38
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,720
How about considering him?

39
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,000
Anna, stop messing around.

40
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,920
Oh, I've decided

41
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,120
to go to Europe.

42
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,320
Europe?

43
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,440
I heard Song Hangyu is there.

44
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,920
I'm planning to go and find him.

45
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,000
That's great.

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,600
You can ask him in person.

47
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,320
I think so too.

48
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,560
But I don't know how long it'll take.

49
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,960
So

50
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,320
I'm giving myself one year

51
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,680
and I don't know what will happen
within that one year.

52
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,640
But

53
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,480
what if you couldn't find him

54
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,160
during this one year?

55
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,640
Won't your effort go to waste?

56
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm going there

57
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,480
not just to find him.

58
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,800
The important thing

59
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,120
is to give myself a closure.

60
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,560
That's a good idea.

61
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,800
So it's not just a journey

62
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,240
to seek his explanations.

63
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,920
It's also a journey to free yourself.

64
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,560
You can go to the Vienna Concert Hall

65
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,080
to enjoy a concert,

66
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,920
take a stroll along the Danube River,

67
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,000
and wander around Mirror Lake.

68
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,560
Mirror Lake?

69
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,800
I think Europe is a good idea.

71
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,080

72

You might even find true love.

Yes.

00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,880
I'm Qiao Bin's best friend.

93
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,280
Can I talk to you?

94
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,400
Sure.

95
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,200
But I need to finish my work first.

96
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,840
Sure, no problem.

97
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,560
By the way,

98
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,520
our coffeehouse is having an event.

99
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,640
You're our 88th customer today.

100
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,560
You'll receive a complimentary drink.

101
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,400
That's great.

102
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,040
Please take a seat.

103
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,760
Okay.

104
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,360
She's not that bad.

105
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,560
She's quite gentle.

106
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,800
I still have to step in.

107
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,840
I'll show you what I've got.

108
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,160

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,640
Thank you.

110
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,320
Please have a taste.

111
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:32,760
Okay.

112
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,200
What's this?

113
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,320
I'm truly sorry.

114
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,280
I guess this special drink
isn't to your liking.

115
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,240
I'll change to a different one.

116
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,320
Please wait for a moment.

117
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,160
Wait.

118
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,200
Just stay and talk to me.

119
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,640
There's nothing to talk about.

120
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,200
Give me five minutes.

121
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:58,960
How about this?

122
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,040
I'll order 50 cups of coffee.

123
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,640
Just sit here and talk to me.

124
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,640
Birds of a feather sure flock together.

125
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,880
You're as childish as Qiao Bin.

126
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,720
The way out is there.
You can see yourself out.

127
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,720
What's with this attitude?

128
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,520
Since you have such a poor service,

129
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,880
don't blame me for not giving you face.

130
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,160
Is your manager here?

131
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,960
Get your manager here.

132
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,400
Is your manager here?

133
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,080
I want to complain about this person.

134
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:25,960
Stop it.

135
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,640
She added wasabi to my coffee.

136
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,640
I'm feeling really uncomfortable now.

137
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,880
You better stop drinking.

138
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,640
You'll get sick
and have an upset stomach

139
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,880
from drinking their coffee.

140
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,840
I'm sorry, okay?

141
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,320
Where's the manager?

142
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,640

Get your manager here.

145
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,160
Please stop it.
You're bothering other customers.

146
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,840
I'm sorry.

147
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,200
I'm the victim. Get your manager here.

148
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,160
I want to see the manager.

149
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,800
Excuse me, mister.
You're in a public place.

150
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,600
Many customers are here relaxing
and discussing work.

151
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,960
If you need anything,

152
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,000
please keep your voice down.

153
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,480
There's no need to trouble a young girl.

154
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,640
It's you.

155
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,760
Don't you remember me?

156
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,440
I pretended to be your boyfriend.

157
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,520
I helped you out

158
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,880
at the bar that day.

159
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,360
Do you remember me now?

160
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,360
It seems you not only lack manners,

161
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,680
but you're also a troublemaker.

One.

163
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,400
Two.

164
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,400
One, two.

165
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,880
One, two, three, four.

166
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,400
One.

167
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,480
Two.

One, two.

169
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,680
Let me check my phone.

170
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,320
Okay.

(She's at the coffeehouse.
You should go now.)

173
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,560
One, two.

174
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,160
Bin, I think

175
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,920
when I punched at the count of one-two,

176
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,800
I was...

177
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,040
I'm so sorry.

178
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,840
- It's okay.
- Did I hit your face?

179
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,360
Does it hurt?

180
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,400
I'm okay.

181
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm so sorry.

182
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,080
It's okay. Let's continue.

183
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,640
One.

184
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,400
Two.

185
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:52,800
One, two.

186
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,160
The ear of the mug
is easily stained by coffee too.

187
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,760
So you have to make sure it's clean.

188
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,960
Or else the customers would think

189
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,440
it's a used coffee mug.

190
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,680
Don't forget the insides of the ear too.

191
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,160
Sometimes, customers might stain it

192
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,080
when the coffee spills on their hands.

193
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,200
If the customers notice such a stain,

194
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,320
they might find it unhygienic.

195
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,000
Then they'll...

196
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,800
Boss, where's Siqi?

197
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,680
She quit.

198
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,760
What?

199
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,840
[Boss, I want to quit!]
How can you quit so casually?

200
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,800
I just want to go out

201
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,640
and explore the world.

202
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,000
Maybe after this journey,

203
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,280
you'll see a different me, Boss.

204
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,320
I tried to talk Siqi
out of this for you.

205
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,560
But what she said

206
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,360
made me realize

207
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,560
that both of you
have different views on love.

208
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,720
You've crossed her bottom line.

209
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,640
(Weilai, you must make
a good impression.)

210
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,760
(Don't let me down.)

211
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,480
(Or else...)

212
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,200
Thanks.

213
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,680
This is for you.

214
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,840
Thank you.

215
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,120
Liu Yun, I'm sorry about the other day.

216
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,920
My dad didn't give me any details.

217
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,320
I'm truly sorry.

218
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,920
So I reflected on myself
after I reached home.

219
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,760
I hope you can forgive me.

220
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,920
Of course.

221
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,960
I was at fault that day too.

222
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,640
It's commendable
to be ambitious in your career.

223
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,480
I shouldn't have gotten angry with you.

224
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,640
It's okay. We're friends, right?

225
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,040
It's understandable for friends

226
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,400
to have conflicts and misunderstandings.

227
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,360
Weilai, we're indeed friends now.

228
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,960
But we can't stay friends forever,
right?

229
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,680
I don't want to push you.

230
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,680
But my dad is pretty anxious.

231
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,720
After all, I'm the only child

232
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,400
and he had me when he was 35.

233
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,640
I know I should be more reserved.

234
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,120
But since this is
what our families want,

235
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,480
I don't have anything to hide, either.

236
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,840
I want to show you something.

237
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,360
I didn't get a chance
to show you last time.

238
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,360
I've carefully selected sample photos

239
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,800
from several bridal studios.

240
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,480
See if there's anything you like.

241
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,640
Look at them.

242
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,440
Liu Yun,

243
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,640
I think

244
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,760
we're going too fast.

245
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,240
It's only our second meeting,

246
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,440
and we don't know each other well yet.

247
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,240
Weilai,

248
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,840
you're anxious about investments too.

249
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,440
Don't worry. I'll support

250
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,160
whatever you want to do.

251
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,720
After our wedding,

252
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,520
I'll consider investing with you.

253
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,680
Take a look.

254
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,520
These several studios

255
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,080
are often fully booked.

256
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,480
I also plan to have a destination shoot.

257
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,000
How about Europe?

258
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What do you think about a month?

259
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,880
But I want to visit ten countries.

260
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,280
Excuse me, I need to take this call.

261
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,480
Hello?

262
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,520
Can you do me a favor?

263
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,040
I can't get away from this blind date.

264
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,320
You only need to lie for me

265
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,520
to get me out of here.

266
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,640
Please help me.

267
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,680
If you refuse,

268
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,720
I might get married on the spot.

269
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,400
She even brought out the wedding photos.

270
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,160
How do you want me to help you?

271
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:55,960
She's back.

272
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,240
Feel free to display your acting.

273
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,840
Who's she?

274
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,360
Are you friends?

275
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,520
I'm not familiar with her.

276
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,800
She keeps harassing me.

277
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,160
She said I looked like her boyfriend.

278
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,840
Last time, I even saw her running down

279
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,600
the street in a wedding dress.

280
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,480
Hangyu, come and take a look at this.

281
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,680
I've prepared all the things we need

282
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,600
for the wedding and the entire plan.

283
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,280
(Especially those career-driven women.)

284
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,120
(They often disguise themselves)

285
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,320
(as victims)

286
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,720
(and blame others,)

287
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,440
(never reflecting on their issues.)

288
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,960
They only want to hear what they like

289
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,240
and can't handle the truth.

290
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,600
Luckily, our son left.

291
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,560
If he still stays with her,

292
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,120
(he must be out of his mind.)

293
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,520
(But I'm curious.)

294
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,120
What did she do

295
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,720
to be abandoned at her wedding?

296
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,960
Think about it.

297
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,000
She has Mr. Tang

298
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,320
and the guy from the bar.

299
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,200
She was involved with three men
at the same time.

300
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,560
Perhaps her fiance
knew she cheated on him.

301
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,960
So he left her.

302
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,000
If you put it that way,

303
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,160
there could be more than three men.

304
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,440
Song Hangyu left for Europe

305
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,960
the night before your engagement.

306
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,400
My guess is her boyfriend dumped her.

307
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,120
So she's not in her right mind now.

308
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,240
She has all this strange behavior

309
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,680
and I don't understand a word she said.

310
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,680
Don't you remember what you said?

311
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,120
You said you'll be with me forever.

312
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,480
Now,

313
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,320
you treat me like a beggar.

314
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,080
Miss, what do you mean?

315
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,640
I don't understand.

316
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,440
Don't you know what I mean?

317
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,200
What did you tell me back then?

318
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,560
You abandoned me for no reason.

319
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,040
Do you know how I face my family?

320
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,560
Have you thought about my feelings?

321
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,880
What about my parents?

322
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,320
How should I face them?
Have you thought about it?

323
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,480
I asked you to help me,

324
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,240
not to sabotage me.

325
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,840
Why should I help you
and am I sabotaging you?

326
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,800
You could end years of relationship
just like that.

327
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,520
You abandoned me for no reason.

328
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,680
You just ended it as you please.

329
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,480
You're a scum!

330
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,960
Liu Yun,

331
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,280
you must let me explain.

332
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,400
I really don't know her that well.

333
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,760
I only asked her to do me a favor.

334
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,280
I didn't expect she would say that.

335
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,120
Please don't believe her.

336
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,280
You have to believe me.

337
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,800
Do you think I'll believe your lies?

338
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,840
We're both blind.

339
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,760
Scumbag.

340
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,920
Yes, Mr. Liu.

341
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,000
I'm so sorry, Mr. Liu.

342
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,840
Can we talk

343
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,880
about this again?

344
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,440
It's my treat tomorrow.

345
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,720
Dad, I'm home.

346
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,640
Sit down and eat.

347
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,600
I don't know if my cooking tastes

348
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,240
the same as your mom's cooking.

349
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,480
Try them.

350
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,560

351
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,320
I...

352
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,920
Don't talk. Just eat.

353
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,080
Look at you. You're already a grown man.

354
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,840
Don't gobble up your food impatiently.

355
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,920
You must change your habit
of being impatient after this.

356
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,120
If you have time,

357
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,280
you should learn to cook
and do house chores.

358
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,320
You'll have to live on your own someday.

359
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,040

00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,440

00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,040
Hao Weilai, can you be more sensible?

556
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,600
How is this not being sensible?

557
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,600
He forced me to go abroad.

558
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,960
Am I being insensible?

559
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,920
Hello, I've made an appointment

560
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,240
for Hao Weilai.

561
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,280
Please show me his passport.

562
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,760
Please wait.

563
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,560
Okay, thank you.

564
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,400
Siqi?

565
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,880
Are you going abroad too?

566
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,600
It's none of your business.

567
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,840
Siqi,

568
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,000
Qiao Bin is an upright person

569
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,640
with ideals, and aspirations,

570
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,760
and is wholeheartedly devoted to you.

571
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,920
You probably don't know.

572
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,280
After you got married,

573
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,480
he canceled
all his entertainment activities.

574
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,120
After work, he goes home
to accompany you.

575
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,360
He talks about you all the time.

576
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,240
You can't be too harsh on him.

577
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,000
Excuse me, are you sick?

578
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,800
I'm perfectly healthy.

579
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,080
What does my relationship with him

580
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:08,680
have anything to do with you?

581
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,960
I'm his best friend.

582
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,440
Of course, it's related to me.

583
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,960
I need a mature husband,

584
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,000
not a childish boy.

585
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,920
I'm fine that Qiao Bin's childish.

586
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,720
But I can't believe he lied to me.

587
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,760
You?

588
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,480
You're even more untrustworthy.

589
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,560
Judging others and taking sides
without justification.

590
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,360
Qiao Bin must have learned
these bad habits from you.

591
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,280
I wish he did.

592
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,040
I think he's too naive

593
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,600
to think you're so perfect.

594
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,240
You don't even know him.

595
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,840
I've already divorced him.

596
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,120
Stop bothering me after this.

597
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,200
Why are you acting so proud?

598
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,000
You just want the house, right?

599
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,760
Here's the deal. After I make money,

600
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,120
I'll buy a house for you guys first.

601
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,560
So you can have a good life.

602
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,280
Is that okay?

603
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,040
So what do you say?

604
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,840
Let go!

605
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,760
I said, let me go.

606
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,600
Please respect women in public places.

607
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,520
Control yourself next time.

608
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,760
Let's go.

609
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,160
Serves you right for bothering them.

610
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,880
Don't be nosy.

611
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,280
You're right.

612
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,200
He doesn't look like a nice person.

613
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,120
He keeps harassing me.

614
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,080
He's indeed annoying.

615
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,440
When you see him next time,

616
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,840
you must be careful.

617
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,720
I didn't dare to ask

618
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,480
the last time we met.

619
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,160
Since it's not an impulsive decision,

620
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,640
why did you give up your job

621
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,720
over a scum?

622
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,600
It's not worth it at all.

623
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,040
Love is not

624
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,960
about gains or losses.

625
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:24,040
Besides, it's not just
about finding him.

626
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:27,040
More importantly,
it's finding an answer for myself.

627
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,920
Is the answer

628
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,640
really that important?

629
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,480
Qiao Bin lied to me.

630
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,840
I didn't even give him
the chance to explain.

631
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,520
What I mind is the lie itself.

632
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,440
The so-called justified answer

633
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,360
won't change anything.

634
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,040
What if his explanation or answer

635
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,480
could make you change your mind?

636
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,920
Impossible.

637
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,600
He stabbed me with the needle.

638
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,920
Even if I pull it out,

639
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,040
I'll always remember that pain.

640
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,840
In any case, Qiao Bin and my divorce

641
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,280
was not an impulsive decision.

642
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,000
But going abroad this time

643
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,960
is indeed due to my impulsiveness.

644
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,040
We're not taking the same flight.

645
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,880
I don't know what to do

646
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,320
after I arrive.

647
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,360
It's okay.

648
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,280
If you need help after you've arrived,

649
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,720
you can contact me.

650
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,000
Can I consider you my sister?

651
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,080
Sure.

652
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,040
Let me add you as my contact.

653
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,320
I've even thought of the nickname.

654
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,320
I'll call it,

655
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,120
"European Umbrella."

656
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,360
Is everything okay?

657
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,240
You're not a boy anymore.

658
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,920
You should learn
how to get along with women.

659
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,720
Take it.

660
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,920
Why are you giving me so much cash?

661
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,440
I don't need it.

662
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,760
Keep it for rainy days.

663
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,160
I have my bank card.

664
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,320
I have a friend there.

665
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,240
I've already talked to him.

666
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,040
When you arrive, give him a call.

667
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,520
He'll arrange for you

668
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,280

I'm not a child anymore.

683
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,040
Both of you didn't have to send me.

684
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,440
Why did you insist on sending me?

685
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,160
You can stop here.

686
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,400
Go home, okay?

687
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,200
Okay, this is as far as we send you.

688
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,440
Look.

689
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,280
I made a mark for you.

690
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,160
Once you get off the plane,

691
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,640
you can easily find your suitcase.

692
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,880
Yuan.

693
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,280
You've never been away from us
since you were little.

694
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,960
Now, you're going so far,

695
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,640
and for such a long time.

696
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,640
We don't know

697
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,320
if you'll adapt to life over there.

698
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,680
You're my precious.

699
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,240
We may worry a lot.

700
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,640
But I'll support

701
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,520
every decision you make.

702
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,920
Enough of that talk.

703
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,880
You're putting her under pressure.

704
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,480
Yuan,

705
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,160
we believe

706
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,560
that you'll manage it well.

707
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,440
Remember.

708
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,680
When you're overseas alone,
safety first.

709
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,280
I got it, Dad.

710
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,400
Mom, don't worry.

711
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,560
I'm not a kid anymore.

712
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,560
I've planned what to do in Europe.

713
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,520
When the plane lands,

714
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,040
I'll video call both of you.

715
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,000
Okay.

716
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,760
Go home first.

717
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,880
When you reach, give me a call.

718
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,400
Dad.

719
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,280
- Good girl.
- Take good care of yourself.

720
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,640
Don't worry about us.

721
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,440
I'll get going now.

722
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,800
Okay, go.

723
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,120
Go home early.

724
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:36,640
Okay.

725
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,320
Stay there. Call me when you reach home.

726
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,680
Okay.

727
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,080
Go.

728
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,080
Hello. Can I have a cup
of double espresso, please?

729
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,680
Please wait for a moment.

730
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,120
How would you like to pay?

731
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,200
Mobile payment will do.

732
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,320
Hello.

733
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,640
I'd like a cup...

734
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,280
Why are you so...

735
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,160
It's you.

736
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,600
Why are you here?

737
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,840
Old habits die hard.

738
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,480
Hello, my coffee, please.

739
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,720
Is there a misunderstanding between us?

740
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,680

why didn't you send
