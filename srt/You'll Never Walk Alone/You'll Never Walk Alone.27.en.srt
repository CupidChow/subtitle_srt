Let me explain

82
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,080

83

00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,640
a new color series of iron cabinets.

87
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,880
The advantage of iron

88
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,640
is that it is durable and sunproof.

89
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,520
The color won't fade easily.
It won't go easily out of shape.

After all, this app

135
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,160

I have a rough idea

179
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,040
of your family's situation.

I hope we can be a little honest

the truth about your family's situation?

184

The truth

185
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,640
about my family's situation

186
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,400
is that we're bankrupt.

187
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,520
My dad used to

188
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,560
fund my studio.

189
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,440
Now, I've shut down my studio

190
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,040
and invest all the funds

191
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,800
in our production line.

192
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,840
I hope to establish my own brand.

193
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,800
It's a difficult time for us,

194
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,520
but we'll get through it.

195
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,720
Weilai.

196
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,240
Look.

197
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,680
My daughter is already 30 years old.

198
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,400
Her mother and I

199
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,640
hope she can have

200
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,400
a stable family.

201
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,120
Well,

202
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,040
Your relationship with her

203
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,120
is progressing in

204
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,520
an unusual

205
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,240
situation.

206
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,240
An unusual period.

207
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,440
I know.

208
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,160
You think

209
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,360
that love is the most important thing.

210
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,200
But as someone who has gone through it,

211
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,640
I must tell you this.

212
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,520
When two people are together,

213
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,720
aside from their feelings,

214
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,480
there are other factors too.

215
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,280
I'm not sure if I'm making it clear.

216
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,400
My daughter

217
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,840
isn't a materialistic girl.

218
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,680
I know her very well.

219
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,360
She can be with you

220
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,760
to start from nothing

221
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,520
and work hard together.

222
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,000
But now,

223
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,040
if she marries you,

224
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,840
she will have to

225
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,480
bear the debt with you.

226
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,240
But of course,

227
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,360
the thing is,

228
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,120
you're even struggling to get by now.

229
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,080
If she stays with you,

230
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,440
do you plan to sleep in the office?

231
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,400
Or the staff dormitory?

232
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,480
As a father,

233
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,400
I cannot accept this.

234
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,560
Weilai.

235
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,120
You're a good kid.

236
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,720
I know my daughter well

237
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,120
as her father.

238
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,600
If

239
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,760
you

240
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,320
can't give my daughter a good future

241
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,040
then please let go.

242
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,800
I hope you can understand
my difficulties.

243
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,960
Please.

244
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,360
Look, Uncle.

245
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,880
Our design and raw materials

246
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,320
are the same back then.

247
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,840
The main idea we are promoting now

248
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,880
is the new color series.

249
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,120
For example,

250
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,600
the swing door cabinet.

251
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,840
For this cabinet,

252
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,520
we've designed four colors.

253
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,440
This way, young people

254
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,080
can pick their wood finishes

255
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,960
and floor tiles.

256
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,360
This will give them more options.

257
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,400
On top of that...

258
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,840
Did something happen?

259
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,880
No.

260
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,680
Don't bottle things up.

261
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,280
You have me.

262
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,360
Although you are developing

263
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,960
an original product,

264
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,320
in terms of management and marketing,

265
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,240
I have more experience than you.

266
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,080
If you have problems,

267
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,840
let's talk it out.

268
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,240
I have talked to Mr. Ge that day.

269
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,760
He has completely changed
his mind about you.

270
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,640
At first, he thought

271
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,200
you were doing things on a whim.

272
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,080
But your proposal

273
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,040
was so well thought-out.

274
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,280
He was moved.

275
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,760
Look.

276
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,040
Everyone is supporting you.

277
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,280
I will do my best.

278
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,480
That goes without saying.

279
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,680
But you also mustn't
put too much pressure on yourself.

280
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,040
Take some time to get some fresh air

281
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,560
and spend time with Yuan.

282
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,480
Fix a time with Yuan.

283
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,400
Find out when she has time.

284
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,320
I will treat both of you to a meal.

285
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,520
Come on, son.

286
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,200
I am optimistic

287
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,960
about the country's
entrepreneurial environment.

288
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,680
But if there aren't enough
entrepreneurial projects

00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,360
after setting up
the entrepreneurial center,

290
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,920
then all my efforts

291
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,240
will be in vain.

Don't put so much pressure on yourself.

00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,080
Young people now are
passionate about entrepreneurship.

295
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,480
Try asking Siqi

296
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,400
if she has any good ideas.

297
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,600
Okay.

298
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,720
By the way,

299
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,520
you must come to the opening

300
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,520
of the entrepreneurial center.

301
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,560
Oh, please.

302
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,400
That's for sure.

303
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,960
Okay, then.

304

- Bye.
- Bye.

305
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,640
So, young people,

306
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,160
any ideas?

307
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,720
Of course I do, Sir.

308
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,280
This entrepreneurial center

309
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,520
is mainly aimed at young people, right?

310
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,280
That's right.

311
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,760
Then you must first get to know

312
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,680
the world of young people.

313
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,480
How do I do that?

Take a look.

316
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,280
Many universities are holding

317
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,120
entrepreneur competitions now.

318
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,600
I took part in one
when I was in university.

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,320
What was your project?

320
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,320
Let me guess.

321
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,280
Don't tell me

322
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,680
it was some nail art studio again?

323
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,360
Do you think

324
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,360
nail art is all I can do?

325
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,440
Just kidding.

into your entrepreneurial center.

On the one hand,

00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,880
you can help aspiring young people.

336
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,440
On the other, it can help you

of insufficient projects.

338
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,160
It can also

open future development channels.

00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,760
to only see me as a kid

384
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,200
whenever I'm with you.

385
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,800
I also wish to prove myself

386
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,280
through this project.

387
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,200
That's good.

388
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,560
I'm sure you will do a great job.

389
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,920
I haven't done anything.

390
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,080
How can you be sure?

391
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,160
That's because I trust my judgment.

392
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:24,720
You

393
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,600
are singing your own praises again.

394
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,040
Show it to me again.

395
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,440
Look. In these chat rooms,

396
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,920
we talk about the Lolita culture

397
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,560
that we like. What do you think?

398
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,240
Look.

399
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,360
Sorry.

400
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,320
I'm sorry.

401
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,680
The coffee shop
was swamped with customers.

402
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,800
This is for you.

403
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,200
Coffee again?

404
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,720
Double espresso.

405
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,600
I'm tired of it.

406
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,120
Didn't you say

407
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,040
that you liked it?

408
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,200
Let's go.

409
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,920
How's it going with your new product?

410
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,320
It's alright.

411
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,360
When do I

412
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,440
get to see the sample?

413
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,360
Don't know.

414
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:29,760
By the way,

415
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,080
I've been getting calls

416
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,360
from many headhunters lately

417
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,360
about executive positions.

418
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,960
But I didn't take their offer.

419
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,760
I'm focusing on Jin Xia

420
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,960
customized travel now.

421
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,640
I wish to put in more effort

422
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,480
into my own projects lately.

423
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,120
Many netizens also left me messages

424
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,840
saying they love my concept.

425
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,320
I've got to reply to them again.

426
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,520
- Xia Yuan.
- I...

427
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,640
Can you stop talking?

428
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,640
Let's be quiet for a while.

429
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,160
What's wrong?

430
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,880
Nothing.

431
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,760
Why are you suddenly upset?

432
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,880
I'm not upset.

433
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,360
But you're annoyed right now.

434
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,280
What's the matter?

435
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,040
It's nothing.

436
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,480
Stop pestering me

437
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,560
and being so annoying.

438
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,240
But I've always been like this.

439
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,960
What's going on with you?

440
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,040
Did...

441
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,680
Did I do something wrong?

442
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,400
It's not you. It's me.

443
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,840
Okay?

444
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,800
Yuan, you're home.

445
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,440
Yes.

446
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,280
Old man.

447
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,480
Yuan looks upset.

448
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,400
What's going on?

449
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,880
I think it's about work.

450
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,280
It's alright.

451
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,880
These are the new color series

452
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,760
iron balcony cabinets

453
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,320
that we'll be launching.

454
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,200
This is the main model.

455
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,120
As you can see, the front is blue.

456
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:45,880
But we can make

457
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,200
a different color

458
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,880
according to customers' different needs.

459
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,920
Customization.

460
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,440
Furthermore,

461
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,560
The cabinet divider

462
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,520
can be raised or lowered

463
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,360
according to a client's different needs.

464
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,600
Most importantly,

465
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,280
this is an outdoor balcony cabinet.

466
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,200
It's resistant to rain and sunlight.

467
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,360
Most importantly,

468
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,520
it has zero formaldehyde.

469
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,120
Not bad.

470
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,320
Nice to meet you, Mr. Li.

471
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,360
- I am Ye Siqi.
- Nice to meet you.

472
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,400
Please have a seat.

473
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,600
Lin Li has introduced you.

474
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,840
Our university is holding
an entrepreneurship competition.

475
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,080
We intend to look for

476
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,360
external collaborators.

477
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,600
That's wonderful.

478
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,480
Let me give you a rundown of our ideas.

479
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,400
Sure.

480
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,840
We're holding the
World Entrepreneurship Competition.

481
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,520
This is

482
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,720
the detailed rundown of our competition.

483
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,840
Look.

484
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,040
You must take note of this.

485
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,560
This, too.

486
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,160
It was a pleasure.

487
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,560
- Likewise.
- Thank you.

488
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,880
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

489
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,840
- Thank you.
- I look forward to our collaboration.

490
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,080
Take care. Let's collaborate again
if there's a chance.

491
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,320
I'm really sorry.

492
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,440
Let's keep in touch.

493
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,000
Okay.

494
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,800
Let's eat.

495
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,400
Coming.

496
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,560
Let's eat.

497
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,800
Ben, let's watch a movie this afternoon.

498
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,320
Ben?

499
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,760
I said, let's watch
a movie this afternoon.

500
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,280
Sure.

501
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,080
Is something bothering you?

502
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,200
No.

503
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,600
I'm your girlfriend.

504
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,240
I hope you can

505
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,520
share your thoughts with me.

506
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,800
I...

507
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,360
I miss home.

508
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,320
I'll come with you.

509
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,640
Really?

510
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,720
Thank you.

511
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,400
No matter where you go,

512
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,240
I'll go with you.

513
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,040
Hey, Jack.

514
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,600
Hey, Ben. Are you fine?

515
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,080
I'm good.

516
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,080
Jack.

517
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,640
I'm going to quit my job again.

518
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,720
You're going to
quit your job again? Why?

519
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,440
Because

520
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,120
I'm going back to China with Sofia.

521
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,840
Okay. With Sofia.

522
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,840
That's nice.

523
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,240
I would like to visit China someday.

524
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,320
You're absolutely welcome to visit.
You will like it.

525
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,760
I hear there are many opportunities.

526
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,400
I mean, China is
a fast-building country, isn't it?

527
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,440
If you want to come, tell me.

528
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,520
Sure.

529
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,160
Come on. Let's grab a beer.

530
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,800
It's on me.

531
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,200
Yes, it's on you.

532
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,080
I'll miss you.

533
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,760
Yuan, come and eat.

534
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,120
Yuan, come and eat!

535
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,200
Okay.

536
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,400
Here.

537
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,240
I'm coming.

538
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,200
What are we having?

539
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,880
They are all delicious.

540
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,480
Yuan.

541
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,400
Why are you

542
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,240
always on your phone?

543
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,080
Mom, I'm working.

544
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,120
Focus on eating when it's time to eat.

545
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,760
Speaking of which,

546
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,800
what's that Weibo

547
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,360
or some channel of yours?

548
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,640
What are those?

549
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,480
We have no idea.

550
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,560
That's my job right now.

551
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,760
When I was in Europe,

552
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,480
I had this idea and innovation.

553
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,920
I'm putting it into action right now.

554
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,760
It's hard to explain to you

555
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,600
in just a few words.

556
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,040
Look at you.

557
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,360
Ever since you came back,

558
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,800
you seldom went out.

559
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,640
You mustn't stay at home all the time.

560
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,680
It's almost three months now.

561
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,920
I can count the number of times

562
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,160
you went out with both my hands.

563
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,960
Your mother is right.

564
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,040
You should go outside.

565
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,320
Just go.

566
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,480
If you don't go outside,

567
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,480
you'll be out of touch with society.

568
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,760
It's the Internet age now.

569
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,520
How would I get
out of touch with society?

570
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,760
My job now
doesn't require me to go outside.

571
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,000
I can work at home.

572
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,960
But...

573
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,040
Mom.

574
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,520
A friend is urgently looking for me.

575
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,240
I need to head out for a bit.

576
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,760
Enjoy your meal.

577
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,160
Change into something nice first.

578
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,920
Okay?

579
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,720
Look at her.

580
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,240
That can't be.

581
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,440
Are you serious?

582
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,880
He hasn't contacted you for days?

583
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,040
He won't pick up my calls.

584
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,160
He doesn't reply to my messages.

585
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,880
His attitude is cold.

586
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,480
Did you go and see him?

587
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,400
He's ignoring me.

588
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,160
How am I supposed to find him?

589
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,920
All this time,

590
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,680
I thought Hao Weilai

591
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,240
was a witty

592
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,000
and gentle person.

593
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,280
These few days, I've been thinking

594
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,720
if I had done something wrong.

595
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,920
I thought about everything

596
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,280
that has happened lately.

597
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,840
But I don't think anything happened.

598
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,520
Do you think

599
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,000
that maybe

600
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,920
he has met another girl?

601
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,640
Look.

602
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,800
When we were abroad,

603
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,360
it was just a few of us.

604
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,040
Our social circle was small.

605
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,920
We saw each other every day

606
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,000
and grew affection for each other.

607
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,640
So we got together.

608
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,080
But after returning,

609
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,600
he started his own business

610
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,480
and met lots of new people.

611
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,360
Previously,

612
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,600
when I first met him,

613
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,720
he was on a blind date.

614
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,720
No way! That's impossible!

615
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,000
The Hao Weilai I know

616
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,560
isn't that kind of person.

617
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,480
Anyway, through this incident,

618
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,400
I've noticed

619
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,920
that I don't know him at all.

620
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,200
I couldn't see through him.

621
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,000
Hao Weilai is too immature

622
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,880
when it comes to dealing

623
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,960
with relationships.

624
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,080
Could he be

625
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,120
like Song Hangyu?

626
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,120
Does he have a secret?

627
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,640
Can you stop talking?

628
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,240
Let's be quiet for a while.

629
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,320
What's the matter?

630
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,120
It's nothing.

631
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,520
Stop pestering me

632
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,160
and being so annoying.

633
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,400
Yuan, don't worry.

634
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,400
I'll help you find out.

635
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,920
[Total Sales This Week]
The new color series

636
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,360
has been launched for a week.

637
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,520
Our number of followers

638
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,920
is constantly increasing.

639
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,080
I'm quite satisfied
with the overall outcome.

640
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,880
I was thinking

641
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,440
if I should reach out to
my friends who make apps

642
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,120
to ask them to run the ads
for another week?

643
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,640
Weilai.

644
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,120
I can't give you

645
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,120
any good advice about the Internet.

646
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,800
But since it is so efficient,

647
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,720
you

648
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,000
should just go with your gut.

649
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,040
Okay.

650
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,800
Look at this.

651
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,160
Just a moment.

652
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,440
Hi, Bin.

653
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,800
Hey, buddy. I'm back.

654
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,000
You're back?

655
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,720
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming back?

656
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,280
I was worried you'd be busy.

657
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,680
I'll see when you're free.

658
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,320
Okay. Bye-bye!

659
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,360
Bye-bye.

660
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,520
It's beautiful.

661
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,280
So this is where
we'll be staying from now on.

662
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,960
Sofia.

663
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,200
I'm

664
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,800
not capable enough now.

665
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,440
I can only afford to rent this room.

666
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,520
I think this place is great.

667
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,200
As long as I can be with you,

668
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,760
it doesn't matter where we live.

669
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,840
Let's unpack then.

670
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,200
Here.

671
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,480
What's going on with you?

672
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,080
You didn't tell me you were coming back.

673
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,880
I could have gone to pick you up.

674
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,640
I know you are a busy man.

675
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,120
I wouldn't dare to trouble you.

676
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,640
What are your plans after coming back?

677
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,520
Sofia came back with me this time.

678
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,200
I'm planning to stay for good.

679
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,680
You plan to stay for good?

680
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,360
What about your livelihood?

681
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,680
How about this?

682
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,720
I'm just

683
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,880
getting started in my career.

684
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,800
Why don't you join me?

685
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,640
Weilai.

686
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,200
This time,

687
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,600
I want to try

688
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,040
finding a job on my own.

689
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,080
I shouldn't always rely on you.

690
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,920
I can't do that forever.

691
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,920
That is why

692
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,760
I want to earn a living
and support my family on my own.

693
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,680
Not bad. You have made progress.

694
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,600
Was it because of Sofia?

695
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,240
Not entirely.

696
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,240
This time,

697
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,120
I met her parent over there.

698
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,080
They asked me

699
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,680
about my future plans.

700
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,720
I felt quite ashamed,

701
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,720
because I had no idea
what I wanted to do.

702
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,680
I was unfamiliar

703
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,160
with the place and people there.

704
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:46,840
But Sofia

705
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,240
never pressured me.

706
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,400
She even came back with me now.

707
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,240
Most importantly, she told me

708
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,960
that companionship is key

709
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,400
in a relationship.

710
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,320
You can take your time to earn money.

711
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,720
That's why I'm back.

712
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,840
How are you and Xia Yuan?

713
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,680
Fine.

714
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,200
Xia Yuan.

715
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,320
Well,

716
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,200
do you have something to tell me?

717
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,080
If you don't,

718
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,920
I need to go.

719
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,520
That was

720
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,160
a brief introduction

721
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,520
of the basics of our

722
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,760
innovation center.

723
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,640
Now,

724
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,520
I would like to share my feelings.

725
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,160
[World Creator]
I was once

726
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,240
an entrepreneur.

727
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,040
I know the hardships
of entrepreneurship.

728
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,520
That's why I'm grateful

729
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,680
for every opportunity I had

730
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,240
when I was starting my business.

731
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,840
What I'd like to do most right now

732
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,240
is to help more entrepreneurs.

733
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,080
So that they know

734
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,560
they are not alone.

735
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,600
The Entrepreneurship Competition
has officially begun.

736
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,160
We will be collecting creative projects

737
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,800
from all aspects of society.

738
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,360
All entrepreneurs
are welcome to participate.

739
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,360
The competition will be divided

740
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,040
into three stages.

741
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,280
Preliminary, semi-finals, and finals.

742
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,000
All projects that make it to the finals

743
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,880
can get a start-up capital,

744
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,360
and

745
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,120
will be invited to move into
our innovation center

746
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,320
where you can enjoy many benefits

747
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,280
like rental reduction

748
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,200
and expert guidance.

749
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,240
Alright.

750
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,040
I hereby announce

751
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,600
the official opening of

752
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,280
the World Creator Innovation Center.

753
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,440
How is it going, Penny?

754
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,480
Is it tiring?

755
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,440
It's okay.

756
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Didn't you see the script?

757
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,720
It's an emotional scene.

758
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,800
You're weird too.

759
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,040
Actors are able

760
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,120
to memorize so many words.

761
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,120
That's some memory you've got.

762
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:48,880
Come one.

763
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,520
Rehearse with me.

764
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,640
No, thanks.

765
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,160
Lately,

766
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,600
Uncle has been
singing your praises to me.

767
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,320
Even I can remember every word now.

768
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,120
Would you like me

769
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,320
to recite them to you?

770
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,560
No, thanks.

771
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,040
He praises me every day too.

772
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,720
I'm starting to feel embarrassed.

773
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,600
Weilai.

774
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,960
You've really impressed me.

775
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,360
You've really brought the factory

776
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,000
back to life.

777
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,000
Sales

778
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,880
for your new product
is doing quite well.

779
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,640
You can be at ease now.

780
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,680
Don't be ridiculous.

781
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,720
I still have tons of debt.

782
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,080
Just take it easy.

783
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,280
You should loosen up a little.

784
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,960
Don't put so much pressure on yourself.

785
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,760
Okay, it's ready.

786
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,160
Ms. Penny?

787
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,640
- Standby.
- I've got to go.

788
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,320
Sure.

789
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,280
Is this capturing the audio well?

790
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,160
It's good.

791
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,560
Beneath him, right?

792
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,840
Yes, further down.

793
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,280
Yes, that's good.

794
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,520
Is this position okay?

795
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,080
Okay.

796
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,600
Okay, camera rolling.

797
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,520
Three, two, one, action.

798
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,680
Wait.

799
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,320
Why have you been ignoring me?

800
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,600
If I did something wrong,

801
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,080
just tell me.

802
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,920
I just want an answer.

803
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,320
What's the matter with you?

804
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,880
Was it...

805
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,160
Was it something I did wrong?

806
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,000
That's right.

807
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,400
I was an entrepreneur at the time.

808
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,240
So I completely understand.

809
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,120
Yuan.

810
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:27,200
My dear Sir is so charming!

811
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,400
It's my first time seeing him

812
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,800
giving a serious speech on stage.

813
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,080
He's so cool!

814
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,840
Yes.

815
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,840
You were amazing today as well.

816
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,600
Thank you

817
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,560
for coming today, Yuan.

818
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,400
By the way,

819
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,960
Sir actually wanted

820
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,400
to invite Hao Weilai today.

821
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,200
But...

822
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,840
You were worried I'd feel uneasy?

823
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,360
I don't know

824
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,760
how to face him in private.

825
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,520
But at the workplace,

826
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,640
it's alright.

827
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,400
Yuan.

828
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,000
Did he not even come to see you once?

829
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,280
How heartless of him!

830
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,560
How dare he mistreat you.

831
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,200
I must teach him a lesson.

832
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,920
Who does he think he is?

833
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,360
I know.

834
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,040
You are someone

835
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,520
who is kind

836
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,600
and willing to take care of me.

837
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,720
You think of me

838
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,280
when it comes to a lot of things.

839
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,720
You want to protect me.

840
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,000
But

841
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,880
we will be walking down

842
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,920
a very long path together in the future.

843
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,480
I hope that we

844
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,920
can be honest with each other.

845
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,640
No matter what problems or hardships

846
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,840
we face,

847
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,880
we must face it together.

848
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,240
No matter if we're afraid or not,

849
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,800
we mustn't hide it from each other.

850
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,480
I will always stay by your side.

851
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,240
Boss.

852
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,160
What's the matter?

853
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,840
I'm losing my mind.

854
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,840
Why?

855
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,760
There's a really demanding client.

856
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,160
I've been arguing with him
for over an hour.

857
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,720
But I still can deal with him.

858
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,320
Then just let him return it.

859
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,840
But

860
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,200
this client

861
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,800
is a big client

862
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,280
who ordered
a few hundred drawer cabinets.

863
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,440
Returning the products

864
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,480
would be a shame.

865
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,720
Send me his contact information.

866
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,120
I'll handle it.

867
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,440
Okay.

868
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:15,960
Hi, Sofia.

869
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,080
Lisa.

870
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,040
My girlfriend, Sofia.

871
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,240
Hello.

872
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,160
Oh my god!

873
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,720
So you're his girlfriend.

874
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,280
Very nice to meet you.

875
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,680
I'm Lisa.

876
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,800
I like your outfit.

877
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,040
It's orange.

878
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,480
And your headband

879
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,480
is pink.

880
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,600
You can speak to me in Mandarin.

881
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,280
She's very impressive.

882
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:50,960
Oh.

883
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:51,520
That's right.

884
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,360
It's time

885
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,480
for class.

886
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,240
- Go ahead.
- I've got to go.

887
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,720
Bye-bye.

888
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,000
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

889
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:02,960
Come on.

890
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,600
Here.

891
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,720
When do you

892
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,240
plan to marry her?

893
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,840
I can't afford it now.

894
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,760
You get me?

895
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,240
I think

896
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,240
you should quickly make things official.

897
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,440
Look at your girlfriend.

898
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,080
That waist.

899
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,280
Those legs.

900
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,080
Gosh, that body.

901
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,720
Do you miss your friend?

902
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,040
They have their happiness.

903
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,560
I have mine.

904
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,240
Sofia, I'm

905
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,720
not capable enough now.

906
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,560
I can only afford to rent this room.

907
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,480
I think this place is great.

908
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,160
As long as

909
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,320
