00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,760
Why didn't you tell me earlier

189
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,520
that we were coming here?

190
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,080
I'm dressed up like a Cinderella.

191
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,200
If Cinderella always wears a gown,

192
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,960
she'll no longer be a Cinderella.

193
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,240
Let's go.

194
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,120
Mr. Wei.

195
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,320
The new men's collection
has arrived in our shop.

196
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,600
Your size has been reserved for you.

197
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,960
Would you like to try it on?

198
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,960
No.

199
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,160
Just wrap it.

200
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,120
And choose a suitable dress

201
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,440
for this lady.

202
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,520
Okay.

203
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,320
Sir.

204
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,360
Why are you suddenly
treating me so kindly?

205
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,080
It's considered
a business expense, right?

206
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,120
Don't worry. I'll pay for it.

207
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,200
What are you scheming again?

208
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,560
Don't think that you can
bribe me with a dress.

209
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,720
I'm an upright person.

210
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,360
You are thinking too much.

211
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,400
I just want you

212
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,320
to attend a dinner party
together with me.

213
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,600
Then I'll choose a dress.

214
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,560
Biao.

215
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,800
Tell me.

216
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,760
Both Hao Weilai and Young Master
like Xia Yuan.

217
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,280
Who do you think will win?

218
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,160
Of course Young Master will win.
There's no need to ask.

219
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,920
I don't agree with you.

220
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,280
I think

221
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,960
Hao Weilai will win.

222
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,080
Do you want to bet on it?

223
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,200
We can bet on anything.

224
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,360
Bring it on. I'll eat this chess piece.

225
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,600
What is it?

226
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,160
- Quan, you are here.
- You are here right on time.

227
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,240
We are making a bet.

228
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,280
I realise that both
Young Master and Hao Weilai

229
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,520
like Xia Yuan.

230
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,400
Who do you think will win?

231
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,880
I bet on Young Master.

232
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,840
I bet on Hao Weilai.

233
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,560
Enough. Both of you

234
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,480
should play your game of chess instead
of minding someone else's business.

235
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,160
Don't go.

236
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,000
Look at him.

237
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,520
He's jealous because
he had never dated before

238
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,840
when he was young.

239
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,960
Let's continue with our game.

240
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,200
What do you think?

241
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,320
Xia Yuan. Your cooking

242
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,440
is as delicious as always.

243
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,760
You cooked for us
for the very first time

244
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,320
when we were at the orchard.

245
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,560
Yuan.

246
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,080
The amulet that you gave me
is really effective.

247
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,520
Thank you for giving me
your family's blessings.

248
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,720
What amulet?

249
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,680
Yuan gave it to me.

250
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,200
Only she and I have an amulet each.

251
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,720
Both of you are so superstitious.

252
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,960
First come, first served, understand?

253
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,320
I just know that only
the virtuous one is worthy.

254
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,280
Are you saying that I have no virtues?

255
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,320
I'll go first.

256
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,160
Well.

257
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,520
I suddenly remember

258
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,000
that Mr. Xu wants to see me.

259
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,600
I'll go and find him now.

260
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,480
You can eat first.

261
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,440
Take your time.

262
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,080
I never hesitate when I want something.

263
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,600
You like Xia Yuan.

264
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,200
I like Xia Yuan too.

265
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,680
I won't give up.

266
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,960
Who says that I like Xia Yuan?

267
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,120
You make assumptions.

268
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,800
What's wrong? Do I look weird.

269
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,520
No. You look fine.

270
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,840
Let's go.

271
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,760
So beautiful.

272
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,200
This place is stunning.

273
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,920
Sir.

274
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,920
This is my first time attending
this kind of event.

275
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,760
I'm a little bit nervous.

276
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,240
You don't have to be nervous.

277
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,120
Just keep smiling.

278
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,000
So pretty.

279
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,240
Sir, I'm famished.

280
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,200
Let me go and get some food.

281
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,080
Sorry.

282
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,400
Sir, look.

283
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,160
There is so much good food here.

284
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,960
Mr. Wei, long time no see.

285
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,040
Long time no see.

286
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,200
Is she your friend?
I'll leave you to it.

287
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,920
Wei. What a coincidence.

288
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,640
I never thought that you would be here.

289
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,440
Long time no see.

290
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,040
Who's that girl?

291
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,040
My personal assistant, Ye.

292
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,360
Assistant?

293
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,520
Is she your friend, Sir?

294
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,440
She is my friend.

295
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,640
Hi. I am Siqi.

296
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,240
Siqi.

297
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,320
That's quite a nice name.

298
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,000
But you look very young.

299
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,200
How old are you?

300
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,360
I'm 22.

301
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,040
You are 22.

302
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,280
What can a 22-year-old person do?

303
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,000
What's going on?

304
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,720
I really didn't expect this, Wei.

305
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,320
We haven't met in so long.

306
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,080
Why has your taste
gotten worse and worse?

307
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,000
At least have some standards
when you choose an assistant.

308
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,520
Who are you?

309
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,320
Who am I? Ask him.

310
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,120
When I was with him,

311
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,920
you were probably still a baby.

312
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,760
I remember now.

313
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,520
You

314
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,240
must be the ex-girlfriend,

315
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,600
Song's biggest regret,

316
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,320
whom he has always told me about, right?

317
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,280
When we look at it like that,

318
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,360
it's indeed true that you didn't have

319
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,760
good taste in the past, Song.

320
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:43,840
Old lady.

321
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,880
Have you not had a good rest lately?

322
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,720
Look at all the wrinkles on your face.

323
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,400
But it's okay.

324
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,800
I know a great skincare product.

325
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,200
I'll share it with you later.

326
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,560
I'm sure it'll get you all fixed up.

327
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,400
You...

328
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,600
Forget it.

329
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,840
I

330
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,360
won't hold it against

331
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,680
a senseless lady like you.

332
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,240
Xuesong.

333
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,560
Next time,

334
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,160
come and visit
my family's new art gallery.

335
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,120
I can be your personal guide.

336
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,920
I'm really sorry.

337
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,960
Xuesong doesn't

338
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,920
like to look at paintings now.

339
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,320
He only likes to look at me.

340
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,520
Am I right, Song?

341
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,040
Yes. You are right.

342
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,240
So, sorry

343
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,880
to disappoint, old lady.

344
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,760
But if we are free next time,

345
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,000
we'll pay you a visit.

346
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,520
See you next time. Bye.

347
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,200
I'm sorry.

348
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,000
I probably can't visit

349
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,640
your art gallery. Please excuse me.

350
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,520
Sir, for such a competent employee
like me,

351
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,280
shouldn't you increase my pay?

352
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,480
I never thought

353
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,120
that you could drink so much.

354
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,120
I'm in a family that has
a wine business.

355
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,680
But you are not that bad either.

356
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,560
This is nothing.

357
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,760
When I was at home,

358
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,480
I drank at least
eight to ten bottles at least.

359
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,520
Don't you know

360
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,880
that I have a restaurant?

361
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,360
I drink wine in cartons.

362
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,960
I drink it like water.

363
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,120
You are the man. You are amazing.

364
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,040
Come on, my brother.

365
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,560
No.

366
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,480
Your dad and I are brothers.

367
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,600
So, you are my

368
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,760
nephew.

369
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,880
Come, nephew. Cheers.

370
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,600
Okay.

371
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,840
I'm so happy.

372
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,200
We are out.

373
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,960
Go and get us some more wine.

374
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,960
Let's go together.

375
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,040
Let's go.

376
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,280
The two of them really drank a lot.

377
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:25,800
Yes.

378
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,280
I feel younger after spending more time

379
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,080
with young people.

380
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,560
Sometimes,
I think that they are quite childish.

381
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,520
Really?

382
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,280
Xia.

383
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,320
Hui is my son.

384
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,640
I can tell

385
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,040
that he likes you a lot.

386
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,960
What do you feel about him?

387
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,560
Mr. Xu.

388
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,560
I think Hui is quite cute.

389
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,320
Like my younger brother.

390
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,600
I understand.

391
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,040
Let's go and drink some tea.

392
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,720
Okay. Let's go.

393
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,680
After you, Mr. Xu.

394
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,600
No. After you.

395
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,320
Let's go.

396
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,040
Here.

397
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,880
They drink wine, and we drink tea.

398
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,760
The tea smells so fragrant.

399
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,200
Hao Weilai.

400
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,480
Hao Weilai.

401
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,840
You...

402
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,200
Hao Weilai!

403
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,800
Your family has such a big winery.

404
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,120
Why isn't there any wine?

405
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,680
Go and get it from your dad.

406
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,040
Okay. I'll do it.

407
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:08,920
Wait.

408
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,480
My dad is over there.

409
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,040
Why are the two of you here

410
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,920
drinking in secret?

411
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,720
Dad, pour the wine.

412
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,240
Sure. I'll do it.

413
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,840
I'll pour the wine.

414
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,760
Okay. This is yours.

415
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,560
And this is yours.

416
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,560
- Cheers.
- Let's drink.

417
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,480
The two of you should drink too.
Don't just sit there.

418
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,200
- Great wine.
- Okay. We'll drink too.

419
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,040
Cheers.

420
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,240
- Mr. Xu, let me.
- Okay.

421
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,280
Okay.

422
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,560
Be careful.

423
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:12,880
Okay.

424
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,320
Okay. Sit and lie down.

425
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,480
Come.

426
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,440
Quan.

427
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,320
Do you know?

428
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,400
This is my first time

429
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,480
seeing

430
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,360
a drunk Hui.

431
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,760
My son

432
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,080
is so cute.

433
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,000
Quan,

434
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,960
go and get a glass of water for my son.

435
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,760
Okay.

436
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,280
Where are you going?

437
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,440
Go and get a glass of water for my son.

438
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,280
Hao Weilai.

439
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,080
Are you okay?

440
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,480
How are you feeling?

441
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,720
I'm fine.

442
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,760
Get up.

443
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,240
Don't pull my arm.

444
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,560
Go and sleep in your room.

445
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,040
You've caused so much trouble.

446
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,040
Lie down properly.

447
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,240
Take a good rest. I'll get going now.

448
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,040
Qiao Bin. Wait.

449
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,200
Get me my phone.

450
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,400
Your phone?

451
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,080
Why do you need your phone? Just sleep.

452
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,120
Just get me my phone.

453
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,200
I have to call Xia Yuan.

454
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,160
Where's your phone?

455
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,960
So troublesome.

456
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,320
Xia Yuan is just right next door.

457
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,800
You can just go and find her
if you want to talk to her.

458
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,120
Is this the first day you know me?

459
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,800
If I had the courage,

460
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,520
I wouldn't need you.

461
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,200
Is Xia Yuan that scary?

462
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,840
She's not scary.

463
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,760
It's just that I become a coward
when I see her.

464
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,320
What do you

465
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,560
want to say to Xia Yuan?

466
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,080
You can tell me about it.

467
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,760
And I'll relay the message to her.

468
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,080
Come here.

469
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,640
We can just talk like this.

470
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,240
Come here.

471
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,760
Come here.

472
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,400
Go ahead.

473
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,200
Listen.

474
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,920
Don't tell anyone else about
what I'm about to tell you.

475
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,440
Go ahead.

476
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,800
Have you ever liked someone before?

477
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,360
The kind

478
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,880
where you want to see her every day,

479
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,600
talk to her whenever you see her

480
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,000
and think about her all day long.

481
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,920
It's not like the relationship
between you and Ye Siqi.

482
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,000
Yours is a one-sided love.

483
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,240
Mine

484
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,040
is a one-sided love too.

485
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,360
Why don't I even have
the courage to confess to her?

486
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,040
Qiao Bin.

487
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,680
Confess?

488
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,760
Qiao Bin.

489
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,520
Don't you think Xia Yuan is a fool?

490
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,360
It's already so obvious that I like her.

491
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,440
Can't she tell?

492
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,480
She knows
that I'm not a proactive person.

493
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,520
Can she be more proactive?

494
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,760
What kind of era are we in?

495
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,200
Can't a woman be more proactive?

496
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,240
Am I right, Qiao Bin?

497
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,360
She's a woman.

498
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,920
You are a man.
Can't you be more proactive?

499
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,920
My friend.

500
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,440
You are right.

501
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,280
I should be more proactive.

502
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,480
Thank you.

503
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,960
You can go now.

504
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,160
Wait.

505
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,680
What is it?

506
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,720
Help me take off my clothes.

507
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,040
What are you talking about?

508
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:51,600
It's too uncomfortable
to sleep in my clothes.

509
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,760
You can just sleep like this.

510
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,360
Hurry up.

511
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,120
Why are you so shy?

512
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,920
It's just taking off my clothes.

513
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,520
Let me take off your jacket.

514
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,040
You are so heavy.

515
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,680
Xia Yuan.

516
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,760
Why are you taking off my jacket?

517
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,000
(I am)

518
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,080
(at home.)

519
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,040
(Milk.)

520
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,080
(Did Yuan take me home?)

521
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,360
(My family.)

522
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,560
Thank you.

523
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,680
Why are you standing there?
Let's eat breakfast.

524
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,200
Hurry up and eat breakfast.

525
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,480
Let's eat.

526
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,880
Let's eat. I'm famished.

527
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,240
Here. You can have this.

528
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,280
Eat more.

529
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:07,920
I can't eat so much.

530
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,000
Have another sausage.

531
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,480
Here.

532
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,560
This is your favourite.

533
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,040
Are you on a diet?

534
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,520
I've eaten too much.

535
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,160
Let's eat.

536
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,920
This is so luxurious.

537
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,480
You are finally awake.

538
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,720
Sit down and let's eat together.

539
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,320
This is so delicious.

540
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,640
Eat more if you like it.

541
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,800
By the way, sign this.

542
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,200
Wait.

543
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,760
What did I sign?

544
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,720
[Signature: Ye Siqi]
It's 50 for the sandwich,

545
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,520
15 for the milk

546
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,640
and 30 for the fruit.

547
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,880
And the service charge is 100.

548
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,560
This is an overpriced shop.
I want to file a complaint!

549
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,000
Let me ask you.

550
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Who's the assistant here?

551
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,520
You.

552
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:14,960
Me.

553
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,000
Who should make breakfast?

554
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,560
Me?

555
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,080
Who made breakfast today?

556
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,480
You.

557
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,640
Who ate the breakfast I made?

558
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,280
Me.

559
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,520
So,

560
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,760
not only you didn't do your work,

561
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,480
you also enjoyed my service.

562
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,520
And I have to be paid

563
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,520
for my service.

564
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,320
These expenses will be
deducted from your salary.

565
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,280
Clean up the table.

566
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,920
I'll inspect it later.

567
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,760
Sir, let's discuss it further.

568
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,680
All of you are so expensive!
I'm going to eat you all!

569
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,880
This is the draft
of our promotional item.

570
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,640
If you think it's okay,

571
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,440
I think we can add the slogan

572
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,320
that Hui has come up with.

573
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,800
- Sure.
- Yes.

574
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,280
This is the flow chart of the event.

575
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,120
I hope

576
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,520
that the wine-tasting event

577
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,400
can be an open and joyful event.

578
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,280
It's not just a business event.

579
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,120
It's a chance for everyone

580
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,600
to interact with each other.

581
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,080
So, I don't want this event

582
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,120
to be too stiff.

583
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,800
It's like a fair.

584
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,800
That's quite fun.

585
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,920
I don't have any other issues.

586
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,040
But can we delete the part

587
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,080
where Mr. Xu will give a speech?

588
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,760
We'll be inviting guests over.

589
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,560
So, how can the owner not give a speech?

590
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,720
I think

591
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,880
that since we are the host
for this event,

592
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,880
it's more appropriate

593
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,640
for any of us

594
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,800
to give a speech compared to him.

595
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,200
We are hired

596
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,160
by Mr. Xu to make this event.

597
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,400
Besides,

598
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,800
he has done so much for the winery.

599
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,320
He's our best choice.

600
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,480
Okay.

601
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,800
Remind him not to just

602
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,200
give a conventional speech.

603
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,280
No problem.

604
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,800
Let's go through the flow again.

605
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,160
The wine-tasting event

606
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,520
will take around
one and a half hours in total.

607
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,880
Everyone will be given a chance
to make a business arrangement.

608
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,760
Our event

609
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,280
will start at one

610
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,120
in the afternoon.

611
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:27,940
[Alarm, Snooze]

612
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,600
You are early today.

613
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,560
Let's eat.

614
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,360
Sir.

615
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,200
Can you give me a chance

616
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,560
to show what I can do?

617
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,480
If you do this,

618
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,360
I can't do anything.

619
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,640
Fine.

620
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,800
Since you've woken up so early today,

621
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,640
you can have free breakfast today.

622
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,960
Sir.

623
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,800
Is it fun to trick me like this?

624
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,160
Are you not going to eat?

625
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:29,360
I'll eat.

626
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,440
By the way,

627
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,600
this is today's schedule.

628
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,440
Take a look.

629
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,800
Morning run, fishing by the sea,

630
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,720
cleaning the study room.

631
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,240
You are

632
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,280
living the life of an old man.

633
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,280
We just have different living styles.

634
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,960
I quite enjoy this kind of life.

635
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,280
You can give it a try.

636
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,160
No.

637
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,000
I prefer

638
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,480
a life where I can actually have fun.

639
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,760
Keep it up.

640
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,360
Keep it up.

641
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,400
Don't go easy on yourself.

642
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,800
I can't do it anymore.

643
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,080
Let me tell you.

644
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,640
Your body fat percentage
is going down right now.

645
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,080
You will get the nice figure
that you like soon.

646
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,560
You can take a rest first.

647
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,640
Sophia.

648
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,640
Sorry.

649
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,640
Let's continue.

650
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,000
Again?

651
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,320
I've just taken a break.

652
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,400
Let's do it.

653
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,920
Finally, we are in the city.

654
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,360
Yes.

655
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,920
It's so packed here.

656
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,280
I'm sure we can find those
who are willing to spend on wine.

657
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,040
I hope that we can attract

658
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,600
some customers soon.

659
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,960
I'm sure we can do it. All the best.
