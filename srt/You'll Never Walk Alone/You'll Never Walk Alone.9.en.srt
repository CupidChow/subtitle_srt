You are hurt?

What happened?

How did you get so seriously hurt?

34
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,040
Is it that serious?

35
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,960
Yes.

36

You are unbelievable.

00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,600
The wound is quite deep.

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,840
Let me apply some medicine for you.

43
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,560
It's really serious.

44
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,960
This is the worst injury
that I've ever had in my life.

45
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,080

I'll explain it to you later.

50

the medicine on you?

Let me sanitize the area for you first.

58
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,480
Hang in there. It'll be painful.

59
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,080
Do it gently.

60
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,960
Xia Yuan, thank you.

61
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,720
So, you said that you were going out.

62
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,240
But you went to the warehouse

63
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,640
and got hurt so badly.

64
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,040
I didn't mean to keep it
a secret from you.

65
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,440
I think what you did was too risky.

66
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,000
You'll expose yourself.

67
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,960
How about we leave?

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,120
There's no need.

69

70

They wouldn't know it was me.

71

Moreover,

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,200
if we leave out of the blue right now,

73
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,560

on our back.

74
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,640
It's too dangerous for you
to be there now.

75
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,480
It's okay.

76
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,480
You don't have to worry about it.

77
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,160
I'll take good care of myself.

78
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,720
Besides,

79
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,600
I wasn't injured by others.

80
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,120

95
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,440
I can't get up anymore. Give me a hand.

96
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,320
Here.

97
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:42,840
If only

98
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,480
I can hold your hands like this forever.

99
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,680
I really hope that time
can stand still right now.

100
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,400
Can you not go?

101
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,200
I'm sorry, Sophia.

102
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,800
I have things to do tonight.

103
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,680
Bye.

104
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,720
Bye.

105
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,400
I'll get going now. Bye.

107
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,680

109
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,840

110
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,280
(Can it be that...)

111
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,920
Did you inspect the goods today?

112
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,080
Ya. They are all set.

113
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,960
Who was at the warehouse?

114
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,800
I don't know yet.

115
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,560
But I have an idea.

116
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,360
Who?

117
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,960
A Chinese guy.

118
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,440
He can't hurt us.

119
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,160
He's got no evidence.

120
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,480
What we need to do now

121
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,360
is to get the goods

122
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,360
into Mr. Xu's warehouse.

123
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,480
From there,
we get the goods onto the ship.

124
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,560
The ship sets sail,

125
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,120
we call the cops.

126
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,240
There's enough stuff in there

127
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,000
to put them away for a long, long time.

128
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,520
But we can't mess this up.

129
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,920
Ya. Great.

130
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,320
What's that?

131
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,880
July has been here.

132
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,800
How do you know that?

133
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,040
I can smell her perfume.

134
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:02,960
Hao Weilai.

135
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,000
What's wrong?

136
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,520
When I was by the office door,

137
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,920
I heard Loris and Tom planning
to frame Mr. Xu.

138
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,600
Loris is going to frame him?

139
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,800
I already said that he was
not a good man.

140
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,880
We have to call the police.

141
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,920
We can't. We can't prove it.

142
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,600
The police won't believe in us.

143
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,880
What should we do?

144
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,640
How about this?

145
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,760
Tomorrow morning,

146
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,640
pack your bags

147
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,480
and leave at once.

148
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,640
I'll look for the evidence.

149
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,320
Will it be safe for you?

150
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,680
I don't know.

151
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,760
How is your packing going on?

152
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,560
I'm almost done.

153
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,080
I'll go there now.

154
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,440
How's your wound?

155
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,200
I'm fine.

156
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,280
After you quit,

157
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,000
go to the beach to meet up
with Ye Siqi and the others.

158
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,120
Be careful.

159
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,080
You too.

Why aren't you at work today?

164
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,600
There has been an emergency in my house.

165
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,280
I have to go back.

166
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,960
I'm just about to hand in
my resignation letter to you.

167
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,880
Do you have to leave in such a rush?

168
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,360
How about

169
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,520
I treat you to dinner tonight?

170
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,200
To thank you

171
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,680
for what you've done for my company.

172
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,200
I'll pass.

173
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,440
My parents are waiting for me at home.

174
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,960
I'm in a rush to go back to them.

175
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,760
But you are leaving soon.

176
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,640
And I don't know

177
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,040
when I can see you again.

178
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,600
Let me give you a proper farewell.

179
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,600
If your family needs anything

180
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,440
or if you need my help,

181
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,720
you can always come to me.

182
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,120
Loris.

183
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,520
Where are we going?

184
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,560
You'll know when we get there.

185
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,880
Is it far away?

186
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,920
No.

187
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,160
We'll be there soon.

188
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,600
And you'll love that place.

189
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,720
What are you doing?

190
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,480
- Stop!
- Stop!

191
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,560
Don't move!

192
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,200
Stop!

193
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:25,800
Stop!

194
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,480
Don't move!

195
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,000
Stop!

196
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,880
What happened?

197
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,880
Someone broke into the warehouse.

198
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,000
Have you seen his face?

199
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,680
No. But I think he's an Asian.

200
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,360
Is he still here?

201
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,240
Yes. I'm sure.

202
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,200
You all, block the gates.

203
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,600
Loris.

204
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,400
Yes. Are you sure it's him?

205
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,520
Okay.

206
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,960
Don't worry.

207
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,360
I won't do anything to you.

208
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,200
I just want to take you to someone.

209
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,920
I don't want anyone to know

210
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,320
that I came here today.

211
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,880
Yes, Sir.

212
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,000
All the monitors have been handled by me

213
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,440
and all the gates have been locked.

214
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,800
He's still here.

215
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,360
He's still here?

216
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,080
Yes.

217
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,120
Weilai.

218
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,600
Xia Yuan is right beside me.

219
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,960
We are going to have dinner.

220
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,520
Do you want to join us?

221
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,440
Weilai.

222
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,000
If you come out,

223
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,240
I can ensure your safety.

224
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,760
But if you don't come out,

225
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,920
I can't promise you anything.

226
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,920
I'll count to three.

227
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,240
One,

228
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,640
two.

229
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,880
Loris.

230
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,520
I'll come with you.

231
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,040
Let Xia Yuan go.

232
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,160
Now, it's not about you coming with me.

233
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,160
Both of you are coming with me.

234
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,560
Please come down.

235
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,800
Let's go.

236
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,520
What's wrong?

237
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,320
Has Hao Weilai contacted you?

238
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,720
No.

239
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,080
I think something is wrong.

240
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,760
I can't get in contact
with my sister too.

241
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,400
Let me give him a call, then.

242
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,120
(Sorry.)

243
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,360
(The subscriber you have dialed
has powered off.)

244
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,400
His phone is powered off.

245
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,720
Did something

246
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,560
happen to them?

247
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,040
I don't think so.

248
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,120
Maybe

249
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,720
they are having fun out there

250
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,080
and their phones

251
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,120
have run out of power.

252
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,160
I hope so.

253
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,080
Don't think too much.

254
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,480
Loris.

255
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,320
Let her go.

256
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,920
Don't make me sound so mean.

257
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,120
As if I've kidnapped her.

258
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,480
Xia Yuan.

259
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,520
Have I treated you unkindly?

260
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,720
See?

261
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,520
I'm a gentleman.

262
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,520
I'm not violent.

263
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,160
I just wanted to have a meal
with Xia Yuan.

264
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,320
I never thought that things
would turn out like this.

265
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,400
Loris.

266
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,120
I beg you. Let her go.

267
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,720
She has nothing to do with this.

268
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,520
Come at me if you have
a grudge toward me.

269
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,440
Stop trying to act
like a hero in front of her.

270
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,800
Tom, you got some gum?

271
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,320
Xia Yuan.

272
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,480
Actually, I've always admired you.

273
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,400
But you've disappointed me this time.

274
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,720
I treated you so well.

275
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,640
Why did you lie to me?

276
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,800
Why did you lie to me?

277
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,520
Loris, what are you trying to do?

278
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,920
But even if you lie to me,

279
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,920
I still won't hurt you.

280
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,640
Have a good rest here.

281
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,280
Look at you.

282
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,200
Such a nice couple.

283
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,480
You know.

284
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,840
I don't like my boss's behaviour.

285
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,120
He's too kind.

286
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,480
He's a nice guy.

287
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,800
He's a gentleman.

288
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,640
But if you are in my country,

289
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,880
if you do something wrong,

290
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,000
you'll have to be punished.

291
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,360
Tom, let her go.

292
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,520
We must have...

293
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,200
You don't know how to shut up,
don't you?

294
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,320
Open your mouth.

295
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,320
Open your mouth.

296
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,280
Now! Open it.

297
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,400
Open your mouth.

298
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,960
You never know how to shut up.

299
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,160
Take it.

300
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,800
Don't blame others for your mistakes,
okay?

301
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,320
You want to play this game?

302
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,840
Perfect. Let's play.

303
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,760
No. What are you doing?

304
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,600
You like this?

305
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,960
Ready?

306
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,800
Stop!

307
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,360
Let's go, guys.

308
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,040
Hao Weilai.

309
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,400
Are you okay?

310
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,840
Hao Weilai!

311
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,360
Boss.

312
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,200
So, what should I do next?

313
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,680
I mean, those two people.

314
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,520
Should I take care of them?

315
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,880
We are not mafias. We are businessmen.

316
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,200
Just don't hurt them.

317
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,120
Okay. So what should I do?

318
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,160
Keep a good eye on them.

319
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,800
They are not a threat to us.

320
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,840
As long as we stick to the plan,
we'll be fine.

321
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,120
I see.

322
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,960
The ship sets sail tomorrow.

323
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,680
After that, we'll release them.

324
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,560
Until then, I don't want any problems.

325
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,560
Got it, Boss.

326
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:01,840
Qiao Bin.

327
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,520
I still think that something
is not right.

328
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,040
My sister and Hao Weilai's phones
won't be turned off at the same time.

329
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,760
Do you still remember

330
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,520
what Hao Weilai said about

331
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,520
Loris having ill intentions
toward my sister?

332
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,680
Did he...

333
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,200
It must be him.

334
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,680
Let's go and find them
at the wharf right now.

335
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,680
That'll be too late.

336
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,200
Let's just call the police.

337
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,000
Hao Weilai.

338
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,080
Hao Weilai.

339
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,480
You can't pass out now.

340
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,160
How do you feel?

341
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,080
Do you feel dizzy?

342
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,280
Can you see clearly?

343
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,040
I have to think.

344
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,480
I'm sure we can escape.

345
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,280
Come.

346
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:47,960
Get up.

347
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,920
Get up.

348
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,400
Are you okay?

349
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,000
How do you feel?

350
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,600
Get up.

351
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,560
Why is your head bleeding?

352
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,600
How do you feel?

353
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,280
Can you see me clearly?

354
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,080
Is it painful?

355
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,120
How do you feel?

356
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
How do you feel?

357
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,680
What?

358
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,080
What are you trying to say?

359
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,320
Okay.

360
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,160
The towel.

361
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,280
Bend your head down.

362
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,960
Bend your head down.

363
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,200
How do you feel?

364
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,320
Do you feel better now?

365
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,560
We have to think.

366
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,680
Let me check if there's an exit here.

367
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,960
We need to find a way to escape.

368
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,760
Let me check if there's an exit here.

369
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,840
Where is the exit.

370
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,160
Xia Yuan.

371
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,600
If we can't escape,

372
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,000
will you blame me?

373
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,480
Let's not talk about that.

374
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,040
We have to find a way.

375
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,720
I'm sure we can escape.

376
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:20,840
Come.

377
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,400
Let's stand with our backs
facing each other

378
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,800
so that we can untie the ropes.

379
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,840
Not that one.

380
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,160
The one inside it.

381
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,640
Not like that.

382
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,280
It's getting tighter now.

383
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,160
I can't untie it.

384
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,120
Try doing it from this side.

385
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,080
Can you untie it?

386
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,000
Can you see the knot?

387
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,520
Yes.

388
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,120
Tug on it again.

389
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,560
You've untied it.

390
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:57,720
Come.

391
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,640
Come. Let me untie you.

392
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:03,920
Hang in there.

393
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,680
Hang in there.

394
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,400
Okay.

395
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,560
How do you feel?

396
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,760
I'm fine.

397
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,880
Rest here for a while.

398
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,840
I'll look for an exit.

399
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,440
It's locked from the outside.

400
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,320
I'll check the back of the room.

401
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,400
Xia Yuan.

402
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,920
There's a vent here.

403
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,160
Let's go.

404
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,040
Be careful.

405
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,480
No.

406
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,240
Shit.

407
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,760
Boss, they've escaped.

408
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,320
Give me your hand.

409
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,640
Let's go. Over there.

410
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,120
- Let's go down.
- Stop!

411
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,440
Stop!

412
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,680
- Stop!
- Stop!

413
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:20,960
Over there.

414
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,840
Let's go. Over there.

415
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,480
- There they are!
- Catch them!

416
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,240
This way.

417
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,600
- Stop!
- Stop!

418
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,840
Don't move!

419
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,440
- There you are!
- Stop!

420
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,760
- Stop!
- Stop!

421
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,680
Don't move!

422
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,800
And here we are.

423
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,120
Catch them.

424
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,800
Okay. Enough.

425
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,680
Enough.

426
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,800
How are you feeling?

427
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,360
Little boy.

428
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,320
I told you not to mess with me.

429
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,840
You don't listen.

430
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,320
You like to show off.

431
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,000
You like to be the hero.

432
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,520
How does the hero feel now?

433
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,080
You know.

434
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,360
The sad thing is,

435
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,280
this poor girl

436
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,880
is going to suffer a lot.

437
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,960
That's a pity.

438
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,240
Because my boss has a big crush on you.

439
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,400
Tom.

440
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,760
You are committing a crime right now.

441
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,640
So scared.

442
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,440
Guys, they are yours.

443
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,200
- Don't move!
- Freeze!

444
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,400
Stay on the ground!

445
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,440
You, get down!

446
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,040
You, get on the ground.

447
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,440
Freeze.

448
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,160
Boss.

449
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,520
There's a cop at the gate.

450
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,680
Okay.

451
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:59,090
[Caution]

452
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,200
[Police]

453
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,120
When we got into the car,

454
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,920
they blindfolded us.

455
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,280
They didn't want us to know

456
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,960
where they were going.

457
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,400
I felt that something was not right.

458
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,320
So, I used my own method

459
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,720
to memorize the route.

460
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,360
Do you want to know

461
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,240
what method I used?

462
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,680
No. Get straight to the point.

463
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,360
The point is,

464
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,160
look.

465
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,720
This is the photo that I took.

466
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,640
It's a proof that they are trying
to frame Mischief Man.

467
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,600
Okay. I got it.

468
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,840
(I wonder how Hao Weilai is right now.)

469
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,880
(Why isn't he out yet?)

470
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,280
(I hope he's fine.)

471
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,160
Yuan, are you okay?

472
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,440
I'm fine.

473
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,960
Sorry for being late.

474
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,840
You are not too late.

475
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,360
Luckily, you called the police in time.

476
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,840
Where's Hao Weilai?

477
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,720
Hao Weilai

478
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,480
is a crucial witness.

479
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,640
They are still taking his statement.

480
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,680
I heard that Loris is still on the run.

481
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,480
What are the police going to do?

482
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,120
They've already issued
an arrest warrant on him.

483
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,480
Thank you. You can go now.

484
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,320
You are welcome.

485
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,560
Officer.

486
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,960
Do you really don't want to know

487
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,320
about my mind map?

488
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,280
You can note it down.

489
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,480
I can tell you more.

490
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,080
No.

491
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,680
It has nothing to do with the case.

492
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:45,920
Officer.

493
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,400
I have another question for you.

494
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,760
I transported these goods without

495
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,600
knowing better.

496
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,440
So, I didn't commit a crime, right?

497
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,320
You are right. Don't worry.

498
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,240
What are you going

499
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,320
to do with those goods?

500
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,840
Where are they now?

501
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,760
We have recorded everything.

502
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,400
All the goods have been confiscated.

503
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,600
Let me tell you.

504
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,880
It was so dangerous just now.

505
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,040
Mr. Xu.

506
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,440
The police station just gave me a call.

507
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,480
They told me that Loris

508
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,520
sneaked in a batch of illegal goods

509
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,240
into our warehouse.

510
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,400
But

511
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,680
fortunately, Mischief Boy

512
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,520
and his friend found out
about it in time.

513
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,680
The police have already
confiscated those goods.

514
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,800
Were they in danger?

515
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,360
They are fine.

516
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,040
They are giving their statements
at the police station now.

517
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,120
But

518
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,200
Loris got away.

519
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:37,880
Let's go.

520
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,400
Let's go and bring them back.

521
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,120
You don't have to go.

522
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,120
I've asked Scar to go
and bring them back.

523
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,280
And I'll go to the police station
to find out more about it.

524
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,280
Okay.

525
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,800
Make sure to prioritize their safety.

526
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,240
Don't worry.

527
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,400
Okay.

528
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,600
[One-Way, Police Station]

529
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,280
Are you okay?

530
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:09,800
I'm fine.

531
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,920
Thank you, Sir.

532
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,120
Thank you.

533
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,080
Are you okay?

534
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,480
I'm fine. Let's go.

535
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,400
Where are we going?

536
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:17,960
I don't know.

537
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,400
Loris is still on the run.

538
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,920
It won't be safe for us
no matter where we go.

539
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,200
Hello, Mischief Man.

540
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,560
(Mischief Boy.)

541
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,400
(I've sent someone to pick you up.)

542
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,840
(His name is Scar.)

543
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,120
(The car is right outside the station.)

544
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,160
(Get into the car now.)

545
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,320
Where are we going? Hello?

546
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:41,920
Hello?

547
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:44,960
Mischief Man.

548
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,320
Mr. Xu.

549
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,840
He said that he sent someone
to pick us up.

550
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,600
And that person is just right outside.

551
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,320
Let's go.

552
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:50,880
Okay.

553
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,520
You don't know

554
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,400
how dangerous it was for us.

555
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,680
Xia Yuan and I couldn't escape.

556
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,800
And we were chased by a group of men.

557
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,600
What happened in the end?

558
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,040
Who am I?

559
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,200
I took Xia Yuan's hand

560
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,720
and ran upstairs.

561
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,880
We kept running.

562
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,680
And we were blocked by a door.

563
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,880
What could we do?

564
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,920
I used my body to ram on the door.

565
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,160
I kept doing that

566
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,360
until the door opened up.

567
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,600
But think about it.

568
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,960
We were at the rooftop.

569
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,840
Where could we escape to, right?

570
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,040
When our lives were
on the precipice of death...

571
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,160
What happened in the end?

572
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,320
Tell us what happened.

573
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,840
- In the end, the police came.
- In the end, we...

574
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,040
Why did you do that?

575
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,720
Why didn't you let me finish the story?

576
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,680
It ended with the arrival
of the police, right?

577
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,560
Fine. The police came.

578
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,320
Don't I get any merits?

579
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,920
Let me tell you.

580
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,480
Thanks to Hao Weilai
who's smart and resourceful,

581
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,040
we managed to escape

582
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,400
so that the police could save us.

583
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,720
Are you satisfied now?

584
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,840
That's more like it.

585
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,880
I'm grateful

586
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,840
that both of you are safe and sound.

587
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,040
Hao Weilai, that's an improvement.

588
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,400
You've gotten better and better.

589
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,160
He's not the only hero here.

590
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,640
After all, we called the police, right?

591
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,520
Enough.

592
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,680
Thank you for saving us.
I'll forever be in your debt.

593
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,680
You can repay us with money.

594
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,280
I don't have it.

595
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,280
Treat us to a meal, then.

596
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,640
Why did you say that?

597
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,040
Scar.

598
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,520
Where are we going now?

599
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,800
You'll know when we get there.

600
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,800
This house is too big.

601
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,560
We are here.

602
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,640
Mr. Xu.

603
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,600
Mischief Man.

604
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,680
You are so rude.

605
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,400
Why didn't you come out to welcome me?

606
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,480
You brat.

607
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,680
Mischief Boy.

608
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,840
I'm here

609
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,120
to welcome you, right?

610
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,640
Hao Weilai is so shameless.

611
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,040
They knew each other in the past.

612
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,240
They almost became sworn brothers.

613
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,640
I've never seen these two before.

614
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,600
I am Ye Siqi.

615
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,960
You can call me Ye.

616
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,040
I am Qiao Bin.

617
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,320
You can call me Qiao.

618
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,880
Okay.

619
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,720
You can call me Mr. Xu.

620
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,400
- Hello, Mr. Xu.
- Hello, Mr. Xu.

621
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,400
Mr. Xu.

622
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,960
Thank you for saving us.

623
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,720
You are welcome.

624
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:35,720
Xia.

625
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,120
You've gone through a lot today.

626
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,400
We already know

627
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,720
what happened.

628
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,280
It was so dangerous.

629
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,640
Fortunately,
all of you are back in one piece.

630
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,400
I really

631
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,520
have to thank you this time.

632
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,160
Otherwise, we wouldn't know where to go.

633
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,800
Enough.

634
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,640
I should be the one to thank you.

635
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,160
Loris

636
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,440
did those things to frame me.

637
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,600
If it wasn't for you,

638
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,120
I would be sitting

639
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,120
in prison right now.

640
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,920
But I still have to remind you

641
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,640
that if something like that

642
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,720
happen again in the future,
call the police first.

643
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,720
Don't take things into your own hands.

644
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,160
We didn't want to alert them.

645
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,000
We wanted to call the police
right after we got the evidence.

646
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,000
But they found out.

647
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,440
Luckily, everything ended well.

648
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,680
Yes.

649
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,040
Looks like you are both injured.

650
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:19,560
I'm fine.

651
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,560
You are bleeding.

652
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,280
I'm bleeding.

653
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,000
Doctor.

654
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,320
Come. Look at you.

655
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,960
You are hurt. Hurry up.

656
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,680
Let's give you a wash

657
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,840
and dress the wound.

658
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,400
Look at you.
You need to take good care of yourself.

659
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,400
Okay.

660
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,480
Mr. Xu's house is so big.

661
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,200
What do you do for a living?

662
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,480
He is the president of our local
Chinese Chamber of Commerce.

663
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,680
Mischief Boy.

664
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,520
Go and get your wound treated first.

665
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,640
This way, please.

666
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,880
Yes. Eat.

667
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,280
Eat more, children.

668
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,480
If it's not enough, I'll ask
the kitchen to prepare more food.

669
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,040
Mischief Man.

670
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,120
This is the best meal
that I've had in a long time.

671
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,280
Really? Eat more, then.

672
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,920
You should stay here.

673
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,640
Then you'll get to eat
authentic Chinese food

674
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,280
every day.

675
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,920
Xia, Mischief Boy.

676
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,640
Think about it.

677
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,080
Stay, okay?

678
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,640
Mischief Man.

679
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,320
We don't want to trouble you.

680
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,600
Not at all.

681
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,800
Think about it.

682
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,280
Loris is still on the run.

683
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,600
You are still in danger.

684
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,480
So, this is the safest place
for you to stay in.

685
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,560
Yuan, stay here.

686
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,200
It's too dangerous outside.

687
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,920
Staying with Mr. Xu
is the safest option for you.

688
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,800
Yes.

689
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,920
Okay then. Sorry for the trouble.

690
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,520
It's no trouble at all.

691
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,880
To be honest,

692
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,240
I've already got the guest rooms
ready for you.

693
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,480
Mischief Man.

694
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,720
Your house is so beautiful
and it has a garden.

695
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,800
Why do you have to go to the park?

696
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,240
Because I'm lonely.

697
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,440
After living abroad for so many years,

698
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,400
I've made a fortune for myself.

699
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,720
But I'm living in such a big house

700
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,080
all by myself.

701
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,560
Everyone goes out to work every day.

702
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,680
I don't even have someone to talk to.

703
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,480
I...

704
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,320
I just want to go out,

705
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,360
make new friends

706
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,720
and talk to everyone.

707
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,560
So, I'm really happy to have you here.

708
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,680
You can find a partner for yourself.

709
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,080
You brat.

710
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,640
If that's the case, we'll stay here

711
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,400
and accompany you, the lonely man.

712
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,160
That's great.

713
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,520
Come. Cheers.

714
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,000
Firstly,

715
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,080
thank you.
You've been of great help to me.

716
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,080
Secondly,

717
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,680
welcome to my mansion.

718
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,000
Cheers.

719
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,880
♪You are like a fire♪

720
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,680
♪You burn me with your flame♪

721
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,880
Come. Take a seat.

722
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,360
Mr. Xu.

723
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,080
Sit anywhere you like.

724
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,320
Come. Biao.

725
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,240
Mischief Man,
this place is not bad at all.

726
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,400
It even has a KTV.

727
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,440
Mr. Xu.

728
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,240
What?

729
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,120
Mischief Man?

730
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,600
What's wrong?

731
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,480
We are in a group

732
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,480
called the Mischief Duo, right?

733
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,160
He is Hao Weilai.

734
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,280
She is Xia Yuan.

735
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,120
He is Biao.

736
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,520
They are very close to Mr. Xu.

737
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:34,800
Hello, Mr. Biao.

738
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,480
Hello.

739
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,200
Don't squeeze his hand so hard.

740
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,360
Mr. Xu.

741
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,400
Are these the kids who you saved?

742
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,360
Yes.

743
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,360
We are all Chinese.

744
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,040
It's not easy for us
to live in a foreign land.

745
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,960
It's my fortune

746
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,120
to be able to help them.

747
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,080
How heroic.

748
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:54,960
Okay.

749
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,840
You can go and have fun.

750
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,120
Quan, come out for a while.

751
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:58,880
Okay.
