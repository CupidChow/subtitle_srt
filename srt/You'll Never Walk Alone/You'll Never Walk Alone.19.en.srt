194
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,240
When I went back to China,

195
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,800
I thought about her from time to time,

196
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,200
but I was too afraid to let her know.

197
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,040
It's because

198
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,600
I wasn't sure

199
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,040
if I was grateful or in love

200
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:10,720
with her.

201
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,760
After appearing on my mind many times,

202
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,520
I realized

203
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,680
that I'm in love with her.

204
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,320
But it's too late.

205
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,320
She's gone.

206
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,960
It's never too late to do anything.

207
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,960
Once you put your mind to it,

208
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,760
it's not too late.

209
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,960
I met with Siqi several days ago

210
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,240
and told her that you were coming.

211
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,880
You...

212
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,600
I'm bad with secrets.

213
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,280
It's fine.

214
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,000
But you know

215
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,960
we have a turbulent history.

216
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,560
Besides,

217
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,640
when I'm here,

218
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,800
I don't know how to face her,

219
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,080
after she betrayed me.

220
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,800
I wouldn't call what happened
between you two betrayal.

221
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,880
You two got a divorce.

222
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,240
If you're not getting back together,

223
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,680
you wish each other happiness.

224
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,600
There's nothing wrong with that.

225
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,360
You know, this is quite amusing.

226
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,120
A couple can vow

227
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,160
to never leave each other's side
no matter the hardship.

228
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,400
Yet when they happen upon a crossroads,

229
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,160
they split.

230
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,120
Some

231
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,480
don't share anything in common.

232
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,520
They live in their separate worlds

233
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,400
yet one day,

234
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,720
they decide

235
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,160
to stick with each other.

236
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,200
Therefore,

237
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,840
I believe

238
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,200
that we

239
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,240
should cherish what we have,

240
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,600
and learn to let go when it's necessary.

241
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,440
Don't you agree?

242
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,280
Come.

243
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,520
Thanks.

244
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,160
What a coincidence.

245
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,880
I went to Luna Park with my friend

246
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,160
and I ran into you.

247
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,200
What a serendipity indeed.

248
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,720
My mom often mentioned you

249
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,680
after you left.

250
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,160
Oh.

251
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,080
I received the red wine you sent me.

252
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,120
It's delicious.

253
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,440
Thank you so much.

254
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,240
You're welcome.

255
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,360
Thank you for looking after me

256
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,320
in the farm too.

257
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,800
Have you found

258
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,560
the man you were looking for?

259
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,480
You

260
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,520
stopped looking for him?

261
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,120
Yeah.

262
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,160
I decided

263
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,120
to give up.

264
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,080
I started a new life

265
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,440
and I love it.

266
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,800
It's freedom.

267
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,200
Hear, hear.

268
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,320
Song Hangyu isn't worth your time.

269
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,680
I'm glad that you gave up on him.

270
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,520
Qiao Bin!

271
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,520
Zhiqun?

272
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,240
Come.

273
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:05,800
Here.

274
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,280
Weilai, allow me to introduce.

275
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:08,640
Hi.

276
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,320
He's

277
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,960
a friend I made

278
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,120
by the beach.

279
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:12,960
Chen Zhiqun.

280
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:13,720
This is

281
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,680
my best friend,

282
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,240
Hao Weilai.

283
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,360
Hi, I'm Weilai.

284
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,680
Hi, I'm Chen Zhiqun.

285
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,280
In fact,

286
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,000
Song Hangyu

287
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,480
is my ex-husband.

288
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,120
I didn't tell you because...

289
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,640
I thought you might not
be able to take it well.

290
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,720
Sorry, Xia Yuan.

291
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,560
It's okay.

292
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,960
It's all in the past.

293
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,160
When I first met him,

294
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,560
he was a foreign student here.

295
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,720
He is hardworking

296
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,080
and charming,

297
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,320
so I fell in love with him quickly.

298
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,760
That was the happiest moment of my life.

299
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,960
I was

300
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,680
love-struck and smitten.

301
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,080
I didn't get to meet his parents

302
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,000
before we got married.

303
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,760
He told me that his parents are old

304
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,840
and they can't speak English,

305
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,880
so they'll struggle here.

306
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,520
I told him that I could go to China

307
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,000
but he said no.

308
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,840
Back then,

309
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,480
I thought nothing of it.

310
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,400
I loved him,

311
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,600
and not his parents anyway.

312
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,920
But after we were married,

313
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,520
he began working for a company
who had business in China.

314
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,960
He spent less and less time here.

315
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,880
And

316
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,960
one day, he came back

317
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,000
and asked me for a divorce right away.

318
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,880
I said no.

319
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,000
But he went to my mother.

320
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,160
They argued and my mother fell sick
because of that.

321
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,840
I couldn't stand it anymore

322
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,920
so I agreed to the divorce.

323
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,040
And then, he went back to China.

324
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,200
I guess

325
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,640
he must be dating you

326
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,080
around that time.

327
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,720
I'm sorry, Kate.

328
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,320
I wasn't aware of this.

329
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,640
I have guessed as much.

330
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,120
You know,

331
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,800
after the divorce,

332
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,160
I was grieving for a very long time.

333
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,720
I forced myself

334
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,600
to send back all the letters

335
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,240
he wrote to me.

336
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,040
I used to think

337
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,440
that you were the woman
who took him from me.

338
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,400
Then I realized

339
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,120
that maybe, you are a victim,

340
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,640
like me.

341
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,240
You deserve better.

342
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,120
Kate,

343
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,480
you deserve better too.

344
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,400
Let's start over.

345
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,440
Xia Yuan, you're back.

346
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,400
Sit down.

347
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,720
It's so late. Where were you?

348
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,440
You drank.

349
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,480
I was

350
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,280
with Kate.

351
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,680
What did she tell you?

352
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,000
She told me

353
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,160
about Song Hangyu.

354
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,840
So you know everything then.

355
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,960
I take it that you already knew?

356
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,240
Why didn't you tell me?

357
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,320
I debated about it too.

358
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,360
But

359
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,800
it's your private life.

360
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,920
I want you to handle it yourself.

361
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,280
I don't want to meddle in it.

362
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,120
So what

363
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,120
will you do now?

364
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,080
It's all in the past.

365
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,720
Let bygone be bygone.

366
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,240
Can I tell you something?

367
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,960
I know

368
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,840
that you're

369
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,160
kind

370
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,880
and caring toward me.

371
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,600
You protect

372
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,000
my feelings

373
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,800
and me.

374
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,280
However,

375
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,360
we have

376
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,080
a long journey ahead of us.

377
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,520
I hope that we

378
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,120
can be honest with each other,

379
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,640
that we will face every problem

380
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,960
and challenge

381
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,600
together.

382
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,520
Regardless of how daunting it is,

383
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,680
we hide nothing from each other.

384
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,400
I will always be by your side.

385
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,200
Morning.

386
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,240
Morning.

387
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,800
Have your breakfast now.

388
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,640
Do you notice

389
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,080
anything different about me today?

390
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,200
No.

391
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,360
I hereby announce

392
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,280
that from now on,

393
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,560
I will kiss my past goodbye.

394
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,080
I will be looking for no one

395
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,600
and I will start my new life.

396
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,840
Okay.

397
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,360
Wait.

398
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,480
If I went missing,
would you look for me?

399
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,920
You?

400
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,040
I'll think about it.

401
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,760
Wait.

402
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,080
How dare you go missing?

403
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,200
I... I...

404
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,560
I was curious.

405
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,960
Eat!

406
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,800
Do not talk

407
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,480
while eating or sleeping.

408
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,920
♪Farewell, Mother♪

409
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,240
♪I am going on a faraway trip tonight♪

410
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,520

412
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,160
What?

413
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,280
I look hideous, don't I?

414
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,560
I told you your taste is bad.

415
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,960
You're not ugly at all.

416
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,480
You're very handsome.

417
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,320
Get ready.

418
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,320
We're going out.

419
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,520
To where?

420
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,960
It's not on your itinerary.

421
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,440
We're playing golf.

422
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,960
Golf?

423
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,960
Mr. Wei.

424
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,120
It's so beautiful here.

425
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,920
How do I putt it?

426
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:13,880
Watch closely.

427
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,840
Left hand on top.

428
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,760
Big thumb points downward.

429
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,440
Grab it with your right hand.

430
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,200
Good.

431
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:21,960
A bit to the top.

432
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,800
Good.

433
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,440
Grab the putter tightly.

434
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,200
Crouch

435
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,160
and bend your knees.

436
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,880
Pull your legs slightly apart.

437
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,720
Swing naturally

438
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,600
and hit

439
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,720
the ball.

440
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:34,720
Not bad.

441
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,920
I need to take photos
of this beautiful view.

442
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,320
Mr. Wei, let me take a photo of you.

443
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,440
Quick.

444
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,440
Strike a pose.

445
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,400
Is this good?

446
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,200
One, two, three.

447
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:52,760
Come.

448
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,000
Take a photo of me too.

449
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,160
Do I look good like this?

450
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,360
Look at this camera.

451
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,200
Don't move.

452
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,000
One, two, three.

453
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Done.

454
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,840
Let me see.

455
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,320
Do you know?

456
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,560
This is my first time at a golf course.

457
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,760
I need to take some pictures

458
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,120
to show off

459
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,080
to my fans.

460
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,520
You have followers on your Weibo?

461
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,400
Of course!

462
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,920
I have many loyal fans.

463
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,640
There's one lately who goes by...

464
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,840
Healthy Living Bear.

465
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,520
He

466
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,480
is so annoying.

467
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,800
He keeps criticizing me.

468
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,240
But then I tell myself

469
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,080
that if he makes the effort

470
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,560
to criticize every one of my posts,

471
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,840
it means he cares a lot about me.

472
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,440
Hi, Clown.

473
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,800
Hi, Princess.

474
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,520
It's time to work.

475
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,360
Let's do our best.

476
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,160
Yes!

477
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,920
Honey!

478
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,360
Honey! He attacked me.

479
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,840
[Jack the Ripper]
Move!

480
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,160
You can't touch me.

481
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,400
It says here that visitors

482
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,120
cannot attack staff members.

483
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,240
Hao Weilai?

484
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,120
You're Hao Weilai?

485
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:35,680
Who are you?

486
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,400
How do you know my name?

487
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,080
What are you doing?

488
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,120
Jia, who is he?

489
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:48,960
He

490
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,240
lied to my best friend, Liu Yun.

491
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,400
He's a liar.

492
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,600
Liu Yun?

493
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,320
You're Liu Yun's best friend?

494
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,640
I didn't lie to her.

495
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,680
My dad arranged a blind date

496
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,960
for us.

497
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,400
- What do you mean I lied to her?
- Have you heard?

498
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,320
His family used to run a furniture OEM.

499
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,960
Then, his father declared bankruptcy.

500
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,200
They are now trying to sell their house.

501
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,800
Who would have thought that one day,

502
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,000
you would need to dress like a clown
to earn a living.

503
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,520
Let's go.

504
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,560
We'll lodge a complaint.

505
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,440
I want to avenge my bestie.

506
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:14,920
Wait.

507
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,640
Explain everything.

508
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,120
Stay away from her!

509
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,200
Let's lodge a complaint.

510
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,720
(Bankruptcy?)

511
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,960
(Selling houses?)

512
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,320
(Impossible.)

513
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,760
Wei.

514
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,200
You're finally here.

515
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,320
It's you.

516
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,040
I was too afraid
to approach you just now.

517
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,800
You have company?

518
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,120
Hi, I'm Siqi.

519
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,680
I think I know her.

520
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:47,880
Yes.

521
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,640
She's my assistant now.

522
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,920
Come.

523
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,360
Careful.

524
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,200
- Please give us some space.
- Wei.

525
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,640
I recall it now.

526
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,680
She saved your life.

527
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,920
You look good today.

528
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,200
Oh?

529
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,720
Siqi.

530
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,960
You're young.

531
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,680
Show him

532
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,360
what young people do nowadays.

533
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,560
Don't be like him.

534
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,520
He shuts himself
in his room all day long

535
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,640
and brews tea.

536
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,080
Help me

537
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,800
get rid of his

538
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,200
boring, old-men hobbies.

539
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:22,960
Don't worry.

540
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,720
You can count on me,

541
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,080
as long

542
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,760
as he's willing to try.

543
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,320
Let's go.

544
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,640
Is she the girl who went with you

545
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,640
to admire the meteor shower?

546
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,360
You sure dote on her.

547
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,360
She isn't working at all.

548
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,360
She's vacationing.

549
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,560
She was quite busy earlier on

550
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,640
so I'm giving her some days off.

551
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,640
Mr. Wei!

552
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,000
Your tone softens

553
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,960
when you talk about her.

554
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,920
Mr. Wei!

555
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,240
Come clean now.

556
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,000
Are you

557
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,160
into her?

558
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:10,880
No.

559
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,400
Don't lie to me.

560
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,360
You

561
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,160
wear your heart

562
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,400
on your sleeve.

563
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:15,920
I should have

564
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,040
taken a photo of your face just now.

565
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:17,760
Your eyes

566
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,000
were oozing affection.

567
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,160
She and I are from two different worlds.

568
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,880
I hired her to be my assistant

569
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,680
because she saved me.

570
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,640
But it's weird for sure.

571
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,080
I know my past self

572
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,080
will not like

573
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:40,680
her attitude

574
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,560
and her work ethic.

575
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,880
But now,

576
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,400
I'm fine with it.

577
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,640
I wonder if she changed me

578
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,800
or I changed her.

579
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,920
Maybe I simply got used to her.

580
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,440
It's not that.

581
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,920
People our age

582
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,480
have seen many things.

583
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,480
It's not easy to find true love,

584
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,160
and I can tell

585
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,320
that she likes you a lot too.

586
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,680
Cherish her

587
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,080
or you might regret it forever.

588
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,760
All right. Time to golf.

589
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,960
(Have you heard?)

590
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,880
(His family
used to run a furniture OEM.)

591
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,600
(Then, his father declared bankruptcy.)

592
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,200
(They are now trying
to sell their house.)

593
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,120
(Who would have thought that one day,)

594
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,320
(you would need to dress like a clown
to earn a living.)

595
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,280
(What is happening?)

596
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,520
(Is this why
he never replies to my messages?)

597
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,840
(I wonder what)

598
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,760
(he's doing now.)

599
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,760
You know nothing.

600
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,440
You never ask me

601
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,560
and you doubt me.

602
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,800
How is that fair?

603
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,000
Forget it.

604
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,640
Give my employees

605
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,280
six months of salary advance.

606
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,680
I wired the money to your account.

607
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,920
Okay.

608
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,160
Dad's business is...

609
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,240
The family business
has nothing to do with me.

610
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,480
Dad needs your help
and understanding now.

611
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,480
I do help Dad.

612
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,520
Look.

613
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,480
I'm helping him

614
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,160
to spend the money

615
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:42,880
he earns.

616
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,280
(Dad.)

617
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,800
(I'm sorry.)

618
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,720
(I shouldn't have said those words)

619
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,080
(and left you behind in China alone.)

620
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,800
Look, Mr. Hao.

621
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,480
Not bad.

622
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,880
Are you okay?

623
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,800
I'm fine.

624
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,920
(What should I do?)

625
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,640
(I need to know what happened.)

626
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,840
Weilai.

627
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,760
Weilai.

628
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,600
Hao Weilai.

629
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:39,840
Sorry, the number you dialed
is unavailable.

630
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,840
Qiao Bin.

631
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,480
Is Weilai with you?

632
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,520
No,

633
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,240
he isn't.

634
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,560
He isn't?

635
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I see.

636
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,600
Let's go home.

637
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,560
Why?

638
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,600
Why didn't they tell me?

639
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,400
Everyone knew that something bad

640
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,760
happened to my family,

641
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,680
except me.

642
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,680
Does my dad think that I am useless?

643
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,400
That if I knew,

644
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,800
I'd only mess everything up?

645
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,320
This must be why.

646
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,400
You're overthinking it.

647
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,840
I'm sure all fathers

648
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,800
in this world

649
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,000
don't want their sons to feel sad

650
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,840
or worried.

651
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,560
But I am worried about him now.

652
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,400
Yes, Weilai?

653
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,920
I'm recording a song now.

654
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,600
Penny.

655
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,960
I want to ask you something.

656
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,840
Go ahead.

657
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:13,880
I know everything.

658
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,440
Penny.

659
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,400
I'm coming back.

660
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,600
Listen to me, Weilai.

661
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,000
You can't come back now.

662
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,960
Why?

663
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,040
Our family is in dire straits.

664
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,840
I shouldn't stay in Europe.

665
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,360
Listen.

666
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,680
You need to calm down.

667
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,400
Your dad sent you to Europe

668
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,120
because he doesn't want you
to see how bad it is.

669
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,000
Your concern will make him more anxious.

670
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
He sent you abroad

671
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
in hopes that you

672
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,520
learn to be independent and reliable

673
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,400
before you come back to help him.

674
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,520
Do you see it now?

675
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,160
Weilai?

676
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,480
Weilai?

677
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,760
How is my dad now?

678
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,880
Don't worry.

679
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,800
He's all right.

680
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,040
I'll take good care of him.

681
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:58,880
What about the factory?

682
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,080
It's not

683
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,520
looking too good.

684
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,120
A good majority of the factory

685
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,880
has been discontinued

686
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,360
as there is no new order.

687
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,680
When can I come back?

688
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,840
Focus on your work.

689
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,120
Once the timing is right,

690
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,360
I'll ask you to come back.

691
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,920
Trust me.

692
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,600
Okay?

693
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,920
I have to go back
to the recording studio.

694
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,880
Please take care of yourself.

695
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,960
Stop overthinking. Talk to you later.

696
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,560
Bye.

697
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,320
Let me show you

698
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,120
my secret pick-me-up.

699
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,720
- Here.
- Hi.

700
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,240
Hi, Maria.

701
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,320
I don't really like candies.

702
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,080
Try it.

703
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,280
Eat.

704
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,320
Do you like it?

705
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,120
It's sour.

706
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,600
Sour?

707
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,360
Sour.

708
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,320
Again?

709
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,680
It's sweet.

710
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,280
Sweet, right?

711
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,760
Thank you, Maria.

712
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,920
Bye.

713
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,080
In fact,

714
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,200
these two candies

715
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,280
are not sweet at all.

716
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,840
The first one is very sour.

717
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,880
And that makes

718
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,080
the second one taste extra sweet.

719
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,680
Look around.

720
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,040
Do they look very happy?

721
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,080
But are they truly

722
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,800
as happy as they look?

723
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,520
Maybe last night,

724
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,840
he drowned his sorrow away

725
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,640
because of his family or work.

726
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,720
The misery you felt before

727
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,200
will make you appreciate

728
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,280
the happiness you feel now.

729
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,520
Don't you agree?

730
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,320
You're right.

731
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,520
- Future.
- Therefore...

732
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,080
The manager is looking for you.

733
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,560
- Okay, thank you.
- Okay, thank you.

734
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,000
We got it.

735
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,240
Let's go.

736
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,320
Come.

737
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,600
Sir.

738
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,400
I just received a complaint about you.

739
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,880
What's wrong with you?

740
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,440
Why did you have
to fight the customer yesterday?

741
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,400
I didn't do it on purpose.

742
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:43,560
It's my responsibility to make
the customers feel scared.

743
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,280
Your behavior brought a bad reputation

744
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,720
to our park.

745
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,040
I'm already supporting you.

746
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,800
I have to fire you.

747
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,760
Give me back your cards.

748
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,080
Sir.

749
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,120
I'm very sorry.

750
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:59,320
But please,
would you give him another chance?

751
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,960
No.

752
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,760
Xia Yuan.

753
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,400
I can find another job.

754
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,520
I'm sick of playing a clown anyway.

755
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,360
Sir.

756
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,840
I'm very sorry

757
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,320
but

758
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,720
I will go with him.

759
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:28,920
Sorry.

760
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,200
Oh, Manager.

761
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,600
Would you consider my suggestion?

762
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,520
I think every seven second

763
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,320
for one arm attack is more scientific.

764
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,920
I can show you how I calculate it.

765
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,280
Please.

766
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,520
Just leave.

767
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,560
Thank you.

768
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,160
I can't believe she lodged a complaint.

769

you can't do your job too well here.

Forget it.

772
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,120
We have resigned anyway.

773

Don't dwell on it.

Why don't

778
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,360
tried out some of the rides.

You work out. You snorkel.
You ride jet skis.

I don't know everything.

My ex-wife.

I'm not here

that you stayed on the beach

816
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,840
and waited for Sofia,

I hope

820
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,520
you can cherish this opportunity.

821
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,760
You don't know women at all.

822
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,840
Even though Sofia

823
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,960
might have already given up,

824
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,160
her feelings for you

825
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,600
will not vanish in an instant.

826
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,840
You must hurry up and find her

827
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,240
so that you can tell her what you feel.

828
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,160
I see.

829
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,360
Likewise, you should hurry up too.

830
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,760
For?

831
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,800
I heard that you

832
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,200
are with

833
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,120

00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,440
What?

835
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,120
Don't deny it.

836
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,760
Think about it.

837
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,360
Does he give you presents regularly?

838
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,600
Does he care a lot about you?

839
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,720

840
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,600
you make?

841
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,920
See?

00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,440
