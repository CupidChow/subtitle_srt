189
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,520

192
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,320
Alright.

193
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,240
Alright, I know now.

194
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,080
We will leave now then.

195
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,040
Get some rest.

196
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,120
Alright.

197
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,120
Thanks to both of you.

198
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:18,800
Let's go.

199
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,160
Good night, Mr. Xu.

200
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,880
Right.

201
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,240
The schedule sheet,

202
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,880
I sent it to Quan and the others.

203
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,880
On the day of the event,

204
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,960
we have their full cooperation.

205
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,040
Really?

206
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,080
That's great.

207
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,520
Oh.

208
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,200
What is Ye Siqi

209
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,440
up to recently?

210
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,760
It seems like she is

211
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,640
working as an assistant for someone.

212
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,040
What's up?

213
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,360
Nothing.

214
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,520
It's just Qiao Bin.

215
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,920
I always feel that he is

216
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,080
still worried about Ye Siqi.

217
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,320
He kept asking me about her.

218
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,320
How would I know?

219
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,640
So I just asked you.

220
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,120
I can understand that.

221
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,800
Relationships are

222
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,960
hard to just let go.

223
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,200
Fine,

224
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,080
to help you with your task,

225
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,360
I'll give this little princess a call.

226
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,640
Talk to her, you first.

227
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,960
Not me, not me.

228
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,720
Hey Siqi,

229
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,800
what are you up to?

230
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,760
I'm taking a break.

231
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,240
I have to work in a bit.

232
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,480
You have to work at this hour?

233
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,280
Take care.

234
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,240
Don't work too hard.

235
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,240
Don't worry.

236
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,520
I make full use of my capabilities.

237
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,840
(Don't worry about me.)

238
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,360
(I'm fine here.)

239
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,720
I ate, dressed, and lived well.

240
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,600
Everything is fine.

241
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,840
Good for you then.

242
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,880
I want to tell you something.

243
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,640
Our winery

244
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,320
is holding an open house event.

245
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,280
Do you want to come over?

246
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,320
I'm inviting you.

247
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,120
(Sure.)

248
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,400
(I will definitely go.)

249
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,440
It's a date then. See you there.

250
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,720
No.

251
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,880
Let's hang up there. Bye bye.

252
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,480
There.

253
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,680
You did well.

254
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,280
Boss, I have something to ask of you.

255
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,080
May I?

256
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,720
Do I have a choice

257
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,080
to say no?

258
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,280
My dear sister

259
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,320
invited me to the winery

260
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,280
for their open day.

261
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,920
I would like to take a day off.

262
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,840
May I?

263
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,960
Sure.

264
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,520
You're quick to agree.

265
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,000
By the way, boss,

266
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,480
I see there isn't much wine
left in the cabinet.

267
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,440
Are you interested

268
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,040
in coming with me?

269
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,000
That winery is exceptional.

270
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,080
Their grapes are of the highest quality.

271
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,000
The wine is also very good.

272
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,440
Sure, we can go.

273
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,000
You are the best, boss.

274
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,760
It's this guy again.

275
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,480
On my Weibo recently,

276
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,440
there is a new fan who

277
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,400
comments on every Weibo post and

278
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,600
follows me closely.

279
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,080
Weibo? What is Weibo?

280
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,640
Wow, boss,

281
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,240
you don't even know what is Weibo?

282
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,240
Look, boss,

283
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,240
this is my Weibo.

284
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,240
Forget about it.

285
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,360
It's better that you don't know.

286
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,280
Clean the living room

287
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,320
and go to sleep earlier.

288
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,720
Fine.

Oh, come on in.

311

What is Quan thinking?

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,080
Why did he make you an usher?

313
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,120
Just your looks are enough

314
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,520
to scare people away.

315
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,160
Come.

316
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,520
Take a look at yourself.

00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,960
Turning it against me now, aren't you?

319
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,560
Mr. Xu, it's been a while.

320
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,120
Yes, yes.

321
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:07,760
How are you doing?

322
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,800
I'm doing alright.

323
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,720
This wine-tasting party is pretty good.

324
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,720
But I thought

325
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,760
you have given up the winery business.

326
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,800
I didn't set this up.

327
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,320
The kids did it for me.

328
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,160
That's nice.

329
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,560
The wine market is so big nowadays,

330
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,800

- would not be much of a challenge.
- Yuan.

- May what you say is true.
- Please excuse me.

364
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,840
and attend our open day.

365
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,560
First of all,

366
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,560
let's invite the owner of this winery,

367
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,520
Mr. Xu to say a few words.

368
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,000
Dear ladies and gentlemen, my friends,

369
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,560
welcome to the winery.

370
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,960
I wish that all of you

371
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,120
can have fun

372
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,080
and have a taste of the winery's

373
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,680
best wine.

374
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,320
As we may all know,

375
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,640
this winery dates back to

376
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,400
the time when my wife was still alive,

377
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,200
who took part in planning
and management.

378
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,600
It can be said that

379
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,560
the production of each grape

380
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,960
and each drop of wine

381
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,280
is a product of my wife's love.

382
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,840
Today,

383
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,560
even with her gone,

384
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,640
we hope that this is the opportunity

385
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,720
where the love

386
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,120
can be passed on,

387
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,440
over to everyone.

388
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,200
Thank you all again for coming.

389
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,120
Thank you.

390
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,880
Dear distinguished guests,

391
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,960
when our wine-tasting session

392
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,960
comes to an end,

393
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,040
we will take everyone

394
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,040
for a tour around our vineyards

395
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,760
to talk about the winemaking process and

396
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,200
to check out the cellar.

397
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,240
I will also talk about

398
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,720
the story of this winery.

399
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,920
Alright then.

400
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,000
Let the wine-tasting party begin.

401
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,520
Right. After you.

402
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,440
Let's go there.

403
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,480
Yuan.

404
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,960
What do you think of the reception?

405
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,120
It's pretty decent,

406
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,320
but

407
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,440
there is still some room
for improvement.

408
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,000
It's alright.

409
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,560
Mr. Wei, do tell me what you think.

410
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,680
Since its purpose

411
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,400
is to sell wine,

412
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,720
as guests enter the winery,

413
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,880
they should be surrounded by
wine elements.

414
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,320
You might want to set up a gallery,

415
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,560
so as guests enter the winery,

416
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,480
they already know of its history.

417
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,200
Of course,

418
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,280
this is just my personal opinion,

419
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,560
it might not be right.

420
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,120
If it's not right,
don't bother mentioning it.

421
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,160
Siqi seems to have grown so bold

422
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,680
to have disagreements with her boss.

423
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,240
Mr. Wei,

424
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,400
this idea of yours

425
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,120
were once ours too.

426
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,640
In the end, however, we decided that

427
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,080
it is better for our guests to
learn about it slowly.

428
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,200
That is an all-rounded consideration.

429
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,200
Yuan,

430
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,480
the brand,

431
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,760
what is it called?

432
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,680
We are coming up with a new name.

433
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,040
How do I promote it without a name?

434
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,440
Crafted to get your lips locked,
a wine ever so mesmerizing.

435
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,920
Lips locked.

436
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,920
What about "Lips Locked"?

437
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,040
That's a sound one.

438
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,400
Mr. Wei,

439
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,080
please try our red wine.

440
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,200
It has a very fruity aroma,

441
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,920
the bitter tannins
are not as pronounced.

442
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,520
It's a nice wine.

443
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,600
By the way, is this

444
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,800
the only wine from the winery?

445
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,720
Of course not.

446
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,880
We have quite a variety.

447
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,240
It's just that our feature today

448
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,520
is this mid-priced wine.

449
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,760
More premium ones to come in the future.

450
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,360
As the manufacturer,

451
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,920
you will know all about wine grading.

452
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,640
However, for those

453
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,040
who are new to wine tasting,

454
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,320
they don't necessarily know.

455
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,240
Indeed.

456
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,560
For someone like me,

457
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,960
if you don't spell it out for me,

458
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,040
I wouldn't understand at all.

459
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,000
That's right.

460
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,280
For example, in France

461
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,160
or Italy, where the old-world wines are,

462
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,400
they have very strict

463
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,400
grading systems.

464
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,120
Consumers cannot distinguish
between wine grades.

465
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,920
New-world wine is different.

466
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,320
As it is not bounded by
traditional institutions,

467
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,520
you can go creative.

468
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,480
I think, might as well,

469
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,120
on labels of wines with
different grades,

470
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,400
mark it with different numbers.

471
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,920
S1, S2, S8,

472
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,920
consumers can understand it at a glance.

473
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,760
Mr. Wei, your suggestions

474
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,640
will definitely be part
of our consideration.

475
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,040
Sir,

476
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,760
won't you show some support?

477
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,840
I'll place an order for 50 boxes.

478
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,760
Yuan, Mr. Wei has friends

479
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,840
from all over the country.

480
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,080
If he wants to gift all of them wine,

481
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,560
it will take more than 50 boxes.

482
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,920
I'll get 100 boxes then.

483
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,160
Thank you, Mr. Wei.

484
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,240
My boss is really nice.

485
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,880
Feel free to taste the others.

486
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:51,640
Xia Yuan.

487
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,200
Come here.

488
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,440
I'll go over.

489
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,440
Let me introduce you to a friend.

490
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,680
This is Mr. Li.

491
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,440
He is very interested

492
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,440
in our wines.

493
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,440
Hello, Mr. Li.

494
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,400
Hello.

495
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,400
We tasted your red wine.

496
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,920
The taste is really unique.

497
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,040
I will place orders for the wine

498
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,400
and for my customers,

499
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,720
I'll definitely
make some recommendations.

500
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,920
That's great.

501
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,840
Our winery owns the vineyard,

502
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,800
so we are very particular about
raw materials.

503
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,920
That's great, Mr. Li.

504
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,920
I will let Quan

505
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,880
send your orders out
as quickly as possible.

506
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,520
I am looking forward to our cooperation.

507
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,200
I am too.

508
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,040
Sir,

509
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,400
a man named Song Hangyu
is downstairs looking for you.

510
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:28,920
Who?

511
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,080
Song Hangyu.

512
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,680
Where is he?

513
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,480
The gentleman was still here just now.

514
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,680
It's okay, I'll look for him myself.

515
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,600
Excuse me.

516
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,560
Thanks.

517
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,680
Do not move.

518
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,960
Loris,

519
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,320
what do you want?

520
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,460
Shut your mouth and walk.

521
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,000
Indeed.

522
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,920
Yuan.

523
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,680
Siqi.

524
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,360
Right,

525
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,200
I think you haven't met.

526
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,440
Let me introduce both of you.

527
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,560
This is Mr. Xu's son, Hui.

528
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,760
This is my sister, Siqi.

529
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,120
This is her boss, Mr. Wei.

530
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:35,960
Hello.

531
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,680
Just now, Mr. Wei

532
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,200
gave us a lot of valuable suggestions.

533
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,880
I'll fill you in next time.

534
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,720
Sure.

535
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,120
Yuan, where is Hao Weilai?

536
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,040
Haven't seen him around.

537
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,360
Hao Weilai,

538
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,160
I saw him go out just now.

539
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,640
Go on and chat,

540
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,720
I'll look for him.

541
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,040
Excuse me.

542
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,480
Hao Weilai.

543
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,440
Hao Weilai.

544
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,120
What do you want?

545
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,040
You ruined my life.

546
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,880
I didn't ruin your life.

547
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,120
You did.

548
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,280
You committed a crime,

549
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,160
so you will be punished by law.

550
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,280
You want to kill me?

551
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,120
Do it.

552
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,200
If you kill me,

553
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,840
you will go to jail
for the rest of your life.

554
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,480
If anything happens to me,

555
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,080
I won't let you slip as well.

556
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,840
Stop.

557
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,840
Loris,

558
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,120
what are you doing?

559
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,560
Why are you here?

560
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,560
Leave now.

561
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,680
Xia Yuan, get out of the way.

562
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,000
I won't.

563
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,480
I trusted you so much,

564
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,280
yet you betrayed me.

565
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,680
What you did was wrong anyway,

566
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,520
so even if you kill him now,

567
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,800
things won't go back the way they were.

568
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,920
Before it's too late,

569
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,040
stop it now.

570
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,720
Step aside.

571
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,760
I won't.

572
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,840
Step aside.

573
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,880
Xia Yuan, I like you.

574
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,720
I won't hurt you.

575
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,640
Don't force me to.

576
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,640
Freeze!

577
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,600
Stay where you are.

578
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,600
Xia Yuan, are you okay?

579
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,600
I'm fine.

580
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,520
Loris,

581
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,040
it's you again.

582
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:39,800
Are you okay?

583
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,120
You were already wrong,

584
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,560
and you want to make more mistakes?

585
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,760
If it weren't for you,

586
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,120
I won't be where I am today.

587
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:50,720
[Wang Yazhen]

588
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,480
You.

589
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,440
I'll kill you!

590
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,760
Hui.

591
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,800
Hui!

592
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,200
There's no need.

593
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,200
Take him away.

594
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,400
Call the police immediately!

595
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,240
Stand up!

596
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,520
Stand up!

597
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,400
Can you get up?

598
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,600
Are both of you okay?

599
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,040
We're fine.

600
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:20,800
Good.

601
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,360
Don't be afraid.

602
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,720
It's all in the past.

603
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,000
Mischief Boy,

604
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,880
bring Xia in

605
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,200
and let her rest.

606
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,800
Just go.

607
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,280
What did the police say?

608
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,160
Loris told them everything.

609
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,080
Good.

610
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,160
However,

611
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,880
we can't let our guard down.

612
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,640
I worry he might still
have an ace up his sleeve.

613
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,880
Just speak your mind now.

614
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,920
The young master

615
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,440
didn't stay.

616
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,080
He went back still.

617
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,880
Remember,

618
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,240
we can't let our guard down.

619
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,840
I worry he might still
have an ace up his sleeve.

620
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,280
You said that just now.

621
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,680
Did I?

622
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:37,880
May...

623
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,240
Maybe I'm a little tired today.

624
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,760
Come in.

625
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,560
Are you working?

626
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,480
Yes.

627
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,640
I learned to make white fungus soup
from the kitchen aunt.

628
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,840
I heard that it is good for the skin.

629
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,760
Thank you.

630
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,880
You're welcome.

631
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:16,920
About today,

632
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,400
I should be the one thanking you.

633
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,360
Don't worry about it.

634
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,400
Anyway,

635
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,800
Hao Weilai,

636
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,680
perhaps in the future

637
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,200
you should stop trying to look tough.

638
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,360
You might think Mr. Xu

639
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,360
looks all well-composed and calm,

640
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,120
but he is also very scared.

641
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,640
Yes, commander.

642
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,840
I'll go back and rest.

643
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,760
Good night.

644
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,200
Hao Weilai.

645
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,840
Good night.

646
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,960
Penny?

647
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,930
[PENNY]

648
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,040
(Hey Penny,)

649
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,280
(Your new album release has
quite some good songs)

650
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,840
When is your concert?

651
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,600
Save me a VIP seat.

652
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,800
Of course.

653
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,160
I will definitely
save you the best spot.

654
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,120
Oh yeah,

655
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,320
last time I said

656
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,880
I will arrange to come to Europe.

657
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,280
That will be around Christmas.

658
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,280
For real?

659
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,400
That's great.

660
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,680
We can spend Christmas together.

661
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,440
Of course,

662
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,400
if there is someone else,

663
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,080
(I wouldn't mind
spending time with him either.)

664
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,480
Or is it you who's
spending it with someone else?

665
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,400
(Of course not.)

666
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,280
(What nonsense.)

667
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,800
Penny,

668
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,440
it's time.

669
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,480
Weilai, I have to hang up.

670
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,600
I have a shoot.

671
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:34,760
(Penny,)

672
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:35,680
(hold on.)

673
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,520
(What is it?)

674
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,880
Well,

675
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,840
How is the old man doing lately?

676
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,640
He didn't post much on Moments.

677
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,960
Uncle, he is the same as always.

678
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,520
He may have been too busy recently,

679
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,880
so he's posting less.

680
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,160
(Also,)

681
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,800
(I thought you didn't
care about his posts?)

682
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,200
Alright then.

683
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,600
Remember to remind him

684
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,480
to get physical examinations on time.

685
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,280
If you have anything to say,
tell him yourself.

686
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,600
I won't get involved in your affairs.

687
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,800
It's hard to talk to him.

688
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,840
(That's all. I'm hanging up.)

689
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:13,920
Me too.

690
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,520
(There is a generation gap
in our lifestyles,)

691
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,320
(now there is also a generation gap
in our clothes.)

692
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,760
(The colorful me)

693
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,400
(can't understand the old-fashioned
black and white and grey.)

694
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,000
(Black, white
and grey are premium colors)

695
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,200
(Most people won't understand.)

696
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,400
Most people won't understand.

697
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,240
What does that mean?

698
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,720
Am I being made fun of?

699
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,080
What did you say?

700
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,840
Sir, you scared the...

701
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,600
♪As summer drifts away quietly♪

702
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,120
♪It left us with a little secret♪

703
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:18,920
A little...

704
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,840
Sir, I am done cleaning.

705
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,040
You can inspect my work.

706
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,560
I am deducting your wages.

707
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:39,880
Sir.

708
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,600
Sir!

709
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,840
I made a mistake.

710
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,280
I won't do it next time.

711
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,320
That's a good attitude.

712
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,920
Keep it up.

713
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,600
Then sir,

714
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,240
can I ask for a

715
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,200
very, very small,

716
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,560
absolutely tiny request?

717
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,680
Are you coming up with
some weird ideas again?

718
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,880
It's definitely not a bad idea.

719
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,920
It's the door to a new world.

720
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,440
Sir, I went fishing with you.

721
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,480
It's your turn to accompany me, right?

722
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,960
I promise

723
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,120
it will be super fun.
You won't be disappointed.

724
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,360
Fine.

725
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,640
For real?

726
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,840
But now,

727
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,880
we have to first

728
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,880
go through a huge makeover.

729
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,600
I've already talked to Quan.

730
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,560
He will find some factories

731
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,960
to handle the packaging.

732
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,600
I have also thought of several plans.

733
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,680
Everyone can just meet

734
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,680
and discuss.

735
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,920
You have the foresight of

736
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,040
knowing that everyone

737
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,520
has opinions on the poor design.

738
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,440
Xia Yuan,

739
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,280
was it on your Moments

740
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,880
that you posted a song?

741
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:06,880
Yes.

742
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,840
I really like Penny's songs.

743
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,160
I yearned to go to her concert,

744
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,880
I just never had the chance.

745
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,440
You have never met her?

746
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,000
Of course, I have never.

747
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,160
Can't have her meet me casually, can I?

748
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,600
What if you see her?

749
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,720
Would you be very happy?

750
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,800
Of course, I will.

751
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,000
In a while,

752
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,040
she will come to Europe
to shoot a music video.

753
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,280
I'll take you to see her.

754
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,600
Are you talking about
fan pick-ups at the airport?

755
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
This way doesn't seem right for me.

756
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,800
I think for an idol,

757
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,480
I prefer to stand far away

758
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,880
and support them silently.

759
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,320
I don't want to disturb her life.

760
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,920
That's not what I meant.

761
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,280
I meant meeting her one-to-one,

762
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,080
face-to-face, in person.

763
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,160
One-to-one,

764
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,160
peer-to-peer?

765
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,960
Face-to-face meeting?

766
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,400
How is that possible?

767
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,920
Are you kidding me?

768
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,840
You don't believe me?

769
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,080
Let's make a bet then.

770
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,920
Anyway, it's almost the holidays.

771
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,080
What if we hold a party at the winery

772
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,480
and I'll invite her to come over?

773
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,440
You are going to invite Penny

774
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,320
to come to our party?

775
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,400
Why would she come?

776
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,680
You are pulling my leg.

777
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,360
Why would she?

778
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,000
Because I am her younger brother.
She is my cousin.

779
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,840
You are her cousin brother?

780
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,640
She is your cousin sister?

781
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,680
Do you think I believe that?

782
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,200
Why would you stand here
and chat with me still?

783
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,640
I'm serious.

784
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,080
She really is my cousin.

785
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,920
I swear,

786
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,920
if I am lying,

787
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,920
I will be struck by lightning.

788
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,800
I am serious.

789
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,320
Really?

790
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,400
Yes.

791
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,680
Penny is your cousin sister?

792
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,320
Is she your cousin, Hao Weilai?

793
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,160
Hao Weilai,

794
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,760
if you lie to me, I will be angry.

795
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,040
Is Penny your cousin?

796
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,080
Yes.

797
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,720
Penny is your cousin sister!

798
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,320
Gosh, why haven't you told me before?

799
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,560
You never asked.

800
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,240
Gosh.

801
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,160
Your cousin sister is Penny.

802
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,760
I never thought that

803
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,800
this would ever happen to me.

804
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,120
So,

805
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,560
if you invite her to the party,

806
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,600
will she come?

807
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,040
Of course, she will. Who am I?

808
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,240
If we were to hold a party,

809
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,040
should we

810
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,280
talk to Mr. Xu?

811
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,000
I think he will agree to it.

812
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,360
Sir, hurry up.

813
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,320
How do you feel, sir?

814
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,760
Siqi,

815
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,720
maybe you should just go in.

816
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,560
I...

817
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,640
I'll wait for you outside.
I am not going in.

818
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,480
Sir,

819
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,520
please don't think that the tea party

820
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,480
is only for girls.

821
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,560
No, no.

822
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,680
Sir, sir.

823
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,480
Have the courage to take the first step.

824
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,640
Dare to be the first.

825
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,560
Let's go, let's go!

826
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,460
[LOLITA PARTY]

827
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:09,600
That tastes good.

828
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,080
Sir,

829
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,880
the Lolita culture is in fact

830
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,760
a kind of exquisite life.

831
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,120
Look at you,

832
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,520
you spend time doing exercise and

833
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,800
pruning plants

834
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,280
while I spend time

835
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,040
matching outfits and

836
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,880
putting on appropriate makeup.

837
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,080
We both share the same ideas actually.

838
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,880
Do you see where I'm coming from?

839
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,280
Sir.

840
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,760
Come, spin around.

841
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,080
Looks lovely.

842
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,120
This hat is so pretty.

843
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,480
Sir,

844
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,520
I am going over to say hello.

845
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,960
This is good.

846
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,440
Hello, everyone.

847
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,720
Hello.

848
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,880
It is my first time
attending a tea party.

849
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,640
I like the vibes.

850
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,000
Your skirt

851
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,080
looks special.

852
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,280
I have never seen it before.

853
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,480
What brand is it?

854
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,800
This is a domestic brand.

855
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,880
Take a look,

856
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,600
isn't it pretty?

857
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,480
It is.

858
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,160
It is beautiful.

859
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,160
So lovely.

860
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,680
Hao Weilai.

861
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,320
Do you feel that

862
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,360
Mr. Xu

863
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,600
is a little weird lately?

864
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,960
It seems like

865
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,000
his memory is in decline.

866
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,880
He forgot what he just said immediately.

867
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,640
Is he too tired?

868
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,800
It might be aging.

869
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,960
Dementia?

870
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,200
Alzheimer's disease.

871
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,120
Alzheimer's disease is dementia, right?

872
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:50,960
Yes.

873
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,040
Both of us suspect something is up.

874
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,280
Although we might be guessing,

875
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,040
we shouldn't be careless
about these diseases.

876
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,760
We might be overthinking.

877
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,480
As one gets older,

878
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,120
it is normal to have weakened memory.

879
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,840
Even our memory is not good sometimes.

880
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,040
Sometimes I forget my phone,

881
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,080
sometimes my keys,

882
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:06,680
right?

883
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,600
But an early symptom of
Alzheimer's disease

884
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,160
is memory loss

885
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,800
that can only get more frequent.

886
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,840
What should we do then?

887
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,280
Should we bring him for a check-up?

888
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,320
You still have to tell Hui.

889
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,880
We are not his relatives though.

890
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,920
I'll ask Hui then.

891
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,520
I'm so happy today.

892
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,680
I made so many new friends.

893
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,000
Sir,

894
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,480
did you feel it too?

895
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,760
A long-coming relaxation.

896
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,520
The life of young people,

897
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,800
isn't it pretty rich and fun too?

898
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,920
Your tea party

899
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,360
and my banquet party,

900
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,120
the dress code is their only difference.

901
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,040
Point missed.

902
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,320
Sir, I'm sleepy.

903
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,560
I'll go to bed now.

904
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,560
Okay, go to sleep.

905
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,280
By the way, sir,

906
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,280
can I apply

907
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,160
to sleep in for tomorrow morning?

908
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,080
Sure.

909
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,040
But after tomorrow,

910
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,600
your sleep-in quota for this month

911
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,840
will have been all used up.

912
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:45,040
It's fine. Every lazy day is worth it.

913
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,600
Good night.

914
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,560
Good night.

916
