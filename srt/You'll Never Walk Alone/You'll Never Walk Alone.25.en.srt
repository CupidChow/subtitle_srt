If you're not used to it,

29
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,120
I'll take you to a hotel

It's fine.

61
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,160
Just follow this plan.

62
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,520
All right, Mr. Tang.
We'll take our leave.

Thank you, Mr. Tang.

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,960
I've always hoped you would come back.

75
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,400
Mr. Tang,

76
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,400
even though I've been
in Europe for a year,

77
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,840
I've been keeping up
with industry trends

78
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,040
and proposed some project plans.

79
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,640
It won't affect the company's progress.

80
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,880
I believe in your abilities.

81
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,640
It's all thanks to your trust in me

82
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,800
that I could come back this time.

83
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,880
I'll give my best

84
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,400

85
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,000
Xia Yuan, you see.

86
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,080
After all, you've been away for a year.

87
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,280
So things in this industry

88
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,880
change pretty quickly.

89
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,320
There might be

90
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,520
some job role adjustments.

91
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,840
I hope you can adapt quickly.

92
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,280
I've been away for a year, after all.

93
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,360
So I completely understand

94
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,400
what you mean.

95
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,320
So don't worry about it.

96
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,400
I'm glad to hear that.

97
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,240
How about this?

98
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,680
Go and talk to Anna after this

99
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,160
because she's in charge

100
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,480
of personnel matters now.

101
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,600
I've briefed her about your situation.

102
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,640
She'll take care of it.

103
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,840
All right, Mr. Tang.

104
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,760
You can get back to work, then.

105
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,560
I'll go and prepare for work.

106
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,080
Okay.

107
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,600
- I'll head over now.
- Okay.

108
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,760
Go with confidence.

109
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,000
I'll save your position

110
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,520
for you.

111
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,360
Does it tally?

112
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,040
Mr. Ge.

113
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,840
You can go back to work.

114
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,600
Are these the products

115
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,000

116
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,160
Yes.

117
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,000
The specific quantities and standards

118
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,360
are on my computer.

119
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,120
I'll send them to you later.

120
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,720
Okay.

121
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,920
But these products

122
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,120
look quite simple.

123
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,640
They are all processing materials
from customers.

124
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,760
We can only do

125
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,240
what the customers ask.

126
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,680
We have no final say in it.

127
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,400
Okay.

128
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,160
You can get back to work.

129

Come in.

132
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,640
It's been a really long time.

133
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,920
How are you doing?

134
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,400
Pretty good.

135
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,320
What about you?

136
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,400
Xia Yuan.

137
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,640
This is my office now.

138
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,560
I redecorated it after you left.

139
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,640
I'm sorry about that.

140
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,000
I've been away for so long.

141
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,200
So it's understandable.

142
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,560
By the way,

143

145
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,360
It's too bad

146
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,040
you weren't my bridesmaid

147
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,840
this time.

148
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,360
I had a two-day wedding

149
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,800
at the best hotel in Shanghai.

150
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,160
The first day was
for family and friends,

151
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,200
and the second was
for clients and co-workers.

152
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,840
It was quite lively.

153
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,040
Anna,

154
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,400
I never thought

155
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,040
so much could happen in just one year.

156
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,360
Congratulations.

157
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,760
My best wishes to you

158
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,280
and

159
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,240
Mr. Tang.

160
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,800
By the way,

161
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,200
I brought many gifts
for you from abroad.

162
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:14,840
So

163
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,760
consider them as your wedding gifts.

164
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,440
Also,

165
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,520
a lot has happened to me this past year.

166
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,800
After you finish work later,

167
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,520
why don't we find a place

168
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,920
and catch up, okay?

169
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,880
Oh.

170
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,360
Those are yours.

171
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,160
I'll take you

172
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,720
to your new desk.

173
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,480
Okay, thank you.

174
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,200
Over here, Xia Yuan.

175
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,120
This is your new desk.

176
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,320
Let me make the introduction.

177
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,440
I'm sure you're familiar with her.

178
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,320
The former director, Ms. Xia.

179
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,320
She has returned to our company again

180
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,920
as the new Deputy Director.

181
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,400
From now on,

182
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,520
please give your full cooperation

183
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,440
to Deputy Director Xia.

184
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,240
How did she end up as the deputy?

185
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,040
Weilai,

186
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,720
how have you been lately?

187
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,000
Penny, thank you

188
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,240
for taking care of my dad

189
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,120
this past year.

190
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,480
I've said this before.

191
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,640
Don't thank me.

192
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,480
We're family.

193
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,000
By the way, Weilai.

194
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,120
My house is still vacant
and no one's staying there.

195
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,040
Why don't you persuade your dad

196
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,520
so both of you move in together?

197
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,800
Penny,

198
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,080
we're fine staying

199
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,240
at the factory now.

200
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,440
You're just

201
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,080
as stubborn as your dad.

202
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,160
Oh,

203
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,160
I have some extra money on hand.

204
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,800
I'm not using them anyway.

205
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,200
I'm not giving it to you.

206
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,880
I'm just lending it to you.

207
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,400
When things turn for the better,

208
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,320
you can slowly pay it back.

209
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,600
Your money

210
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,520
can only solve visible problems.

211
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,920
Solving the underlying problems
still depends on us.

212
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,960
I discussed it with my dad.

213
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,360
We can't trouble you

214
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,280
or drag you

215
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,480
into this bottomless pit.

216
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,760
Penny,

217
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,360
what happened

218
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,560
to our family

219
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,840
that it ended like this?

220
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,400
There was a manager
at the factory named Jia Le.

221
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,280
He privately copied

222
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,800
a client's customized furniture designs,

223
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,200
put fake labels on them,

224
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,680
and sold them abroad.

225
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,200
It didn't take long
for the client to find out.

226
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,000
Out of anger,

227
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,720
the client sued the factory

228
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,960
for compensation.

229
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,880
The court ruled the factory engaged
in infringement.

230
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,720
Shouldn't it be Jia Le's responsibility?

231
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,480
Why does our factory have to pay for it?

232
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,240
Moreover,

233
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,840
can the factory reduce some of its debts

234
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,680
if we find Jia Le?

235
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,680
After the incident,

236
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,320
Jia Le disappeared.

237
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,880
As the person in charge of the factory,

238
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,600
Uncle has to bear the debts
and legal responsibilities.

239
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,360
And now, there's no way

240
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,200
to prove

241
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,800
that he's not involved in this matter.

242
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,760
Even though I hired a good attorney,

243
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,120
but

244
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,080
the current situation

245
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,840
is not optimistic.

246
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,880
All right. I understand.

247
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,560
Don't worry.

248
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,240
We'll handle it ourselves.

249
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,760
If there's anything, let me know.

250
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,600
Why are you here?

251
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,560
You look beautiful.

252
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,600
Where are we going?

253
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,000
You'll know when we get there.

254
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,760
Thank you. Please come again.

255
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:56,720
Hello, Madam.

256
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,640
Yuan!

257
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,560
It's been a while.

258
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,320
That's right.

259
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:00,880
What would you like to eat?

260
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,280
The usual, two servings.

261
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,560
Okay, go and take a seat inside.

262
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,400
I'll go ahead.

263
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,440
Okay, take a seat.

264
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,880
Let's sit here.

265
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,120
I thought

266
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,880
returning to the country
would make life better.

267
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,760
I didn't expect

268
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,800
I could only treat you to noodles here.

269
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,440
My dad and I have moved
to the factory now.

270
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,840
So it's not convenient for you

271
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,880
to visit me.

272
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,240
You won't lose interest in me, will you?

273
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,800
Listen.

274
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,600
This shop has been running

275
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,040
for over ten years.

276
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,840
I've been coming here
since I was a child.

277
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,200
At first,

278
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,440
there was only enough space
for two tables.

279
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,960
Madam had to cook noodles,

280
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,480
collect money, and serve dishes.

281
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,440
It was really hard.

282
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,440
But she's doing well now.

283
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,280
The surrounding shops have changed.

284
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,040
But hers has expanded.

285
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,480
See?

286
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,120
At the back,

287
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,760
she even hired more people to help.

288
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,720
So

289
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,280
persistence is key.

290
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,760
Then I'll definitely persist

291
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,800
and work hard to give you a good life

292
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,080
before you turn eighty.

293
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,760
Can you be a little more ambitious?

294
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,160
Can't you do it
before I turn seventy-five?

295
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:14,960
That's fine too.

296
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,880
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

297
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,080
It smells good.

298
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,320
Thank you.

299
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,720
They still taste the same.

300
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,840
It's delicious.

301
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,520
What do you think?

302
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,680
You better learn this from the kitchen

303
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,600
and cook this for me at home.

304
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,720
I don't need to learn from the kitchen.

305
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,800
I can learn from Madam.

306
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,000
You'll sit here.

307
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,240
And you, over here.

308
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,880
Siqi,

309
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,120
don't put these things on the bed.

310
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,840
I'm still not used to them.

311
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,920
Er Bai,

312
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,840
look.

313
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,080
Your dad doesn't want you anymore.

314
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,480
Dad.

315
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,440
But

316
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,000
I want to live with you and Mom.

317
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,120
It's just a plush toy.

318
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,240
It can't talk.

319
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,920
Sir,

320
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,720
I'm so bored
that I'm practically growing mold.

321
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,000
All I can do is talk to it.

322
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,920
I thought

323
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,080
married life

324
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,760
would be colorful.

325
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,480
But I've gotten used

326
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,200
to the routines of elderly people.

327
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,160
This isn't the kind of life
I should be living.

328
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,720
Do you have any places you want to go

329
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,440
or things you want to do?

330
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,320
I don't want to play.

331
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,480
I want to work.

332
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,400
Work?

333
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,640
Isn't working at home the same?

334
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,320
It's different.

335
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,320
At home,

336
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,960
you just pamper me.

337
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,760
We agreed

338
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,400
that I would do the housework.

339
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,960
But you always insist on doing it.

340
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,840
I'm still young.

341
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,800
I can't really live like
an elderly person.

342
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,720
That's why I thought
about going out to work.

343
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,240
Maybe I can improve faster

344
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,960
if I work in a completely
unfamiliar environment.

345
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,400
Siqi,

346
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,080
I understand

347
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,800
where you're coming from.

348
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,280
But let's hold off

349
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,160
on looking for a job.

350
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,640
You see, first of all,

351
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,200
your visa is expiring soon.

352
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,200
If you go out to find a job,

353
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,760
no one will hire you.

354
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,760
Secondly,

355
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,240
don't think that you're idle every day.

356
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,320
Didn't you finish reading

357
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,600
all those finance books?

358
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,520
So

359
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,800
you did make some improvement.

360
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,200
I did read them.

361
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,360
But it doesn't mean

362
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,800
I understand them.

363
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,040
Sir,

364
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,600
you've been here for so many years.

365
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,840
You have your circle of friends.

366
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,000
I don't know

367
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,960
anyone here.

368
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,960
Lately,

369
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,280
you've been going out
for work inspections every day,

370
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,400
leaving me alone at home

371
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,040
like a child being left behind.

372
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,240
How about

373
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,400
I arrange some entertainment

374
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,680
for you tomorrow?

375
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,200
That sounds good.

376
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,400
Go freshen up.

377
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,320
Hold it.

378
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,680
Okay.

379
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,280
Mrs. Wang,

380
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,480
which school is your son attending?

381
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,880
I've been worried about it lately.

382
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,680
Do you have any connections

383
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,840
to help me?

384
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,240
No problem. Mrs. Lin.

385
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,560
Have you been doing
beauty treatments lately?

386
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,760
You're getting younger
and more beautiful.

387
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,240
It's your turn.

388
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,520
I'm maintaining it

389
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,400
through external means.

390
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,760
Unlike Mrs. Wei,

391
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,360
who has natural youth.

392
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,200
Look at the skin of young people.

393
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,240
It's so firm.

394
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,760
Indeed.

395
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,480
We can't compare.

396
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,240
It's your turn now.

397
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,960
(How about)

398
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,520
(I arrange some entertainment
for you tomorrow?)

399
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,520
Get out! Get out!

400
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,240
- Just get out.
- Siqi.

401
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,320
- Don't be mad.
- Sleep in the living room!

402
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,760
I'm sorry.

403
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,520
Siqi, I'm really sorry.

404
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,520
What do you want to eat?

405
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,400
I'll take you out to eat, okay?

406
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,080
Don't try to bribe me with food.

407
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,240
The entertainment you planned

408
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,400
turned out

409
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,240
to be a complete disaster.

410
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,360
Ding told me about it.

411
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,880
He said his wife has fun

412
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,560
doing this every night at home.

413
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,920
Don't try and blame Ding for this.

414
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,800
I should have recorded today's situation

415
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,320
to show you

416
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,240
how awkward it was for me.

417
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,160
They were talking

418
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,040
about children, jewelry,
and beauty treatment.

419
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,440
I couldn't even say anything,

420
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,280
and they treated me like a display,

421
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,520
looking at me

422
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,120
and touching me.

423
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:21,960
Wei Xuesong,

424
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,080
is there something
you don't like about me?

425
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,840
If you do, just say it.

426
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,720
You didn't have to do this to me.

427
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,240
Okay, fine.

428
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,080
From now on, when I go to work,

429
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,240
you can come with me

430
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,240
and be my little assistant,

431
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,400
okay?

432
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,920
That's okay.

433
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,240
But double the salary.

434
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,840
Okay.

435
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,720
Ms. An,

436
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,880
I made this coffee for you.

437
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,800
Ms. An, this is the coffee

438
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,160
my relatives specially brought
from abroad for you.

439
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,000
Thank you.

440
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,960
But don't drink coffee now.

441
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,680
I'm trying to conceive.

442
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,400
Look at her acting all high and mighty.

443
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,560
I must say,

444
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,560
Xia Yuan sure is impressive.

445
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,760
Not only did she leave
her professional career,

446
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,840
but when Ms. An treated her that way

447
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,160
the other day,

448
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,040
she remained unfazed.

449
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,560
She sure is admirable.

450
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,080
What's the use?

451
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,880
Xia Yuan used to be
a top candidate for promotion

452
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,160
to director.

453
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,320
Now,

454
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,920
she's constantly being suppressed
by Ms. An.

455
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,960
Can't you see

456
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,040
that Xia Yuan's former assistant
was fired?

457
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,960
We must follow the right person.

458
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,560
Then who do you think we should follow?

459
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,600
Do you even need to ask

460
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,520
when it's already obvious?

461
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,840
Since everyone's here,

462
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,160
let's start with the meeting.

463
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,000
Ms. An,

464
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,920
Ms. Xia is not here yet.

465
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,200
Let's begin.

466
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,080
Where's your proposal?

467
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,360
It's ready.

468
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,160
Then I'll briefly talk

469
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,920
about the position
of the tourism industry in our country.

470
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,240
In 2019,

471
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,720
the number of tourists in our country
reached 4 billion people.

472
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,720
Don't worry.

473
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,680
I cherish my bike very much.

474
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,000
There are no scratches

475
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,480
and it looks brand new.

476
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,600
Everything looks good.
I'll transfer you the money.

477
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,440
Sorry, I'm late.

478
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,640
I've noticed some people

479
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,000
have stayed abroad for too long

480
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,400
that they're not accustomed
to the local time anymore, huh?

481
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,840
The meeting has been going on
for half an hour.

482
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,040
If you don't want to attend,
you can leave.

483
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,280
If you don't want to work, you can quit.

484
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,680
Sorry, Ms. An.

485
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,120
It's my negligence.

486
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,960
Mr. Tang, why are you here?

487
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,440
I'll also attend today's meeting.

488
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,720
I want to hear everyone's thoughts.

489
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,920
Welcome, Mr. Tang.

490
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,760
Okay, continue.

491
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,600
Where are my meeting materials?

492
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,440
I...

493
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,400
Xia Yuan is the core
of the Operations Department.

494
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,880
How could you not even prepare
the meeting materials?

495
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,440
Is this how you guys work?

496
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,360
I'm sorry.

497
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,480
Xia Yuan,

498
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,120
please go ahead.

499
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,720
Okay, Mr. Tang.

500
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,120
Let me tell you

501
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,920
about several customized solutions
I designed abroad.

502
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,240
Mr. Tang, here are the materials.

503
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,720
Everyone can take a look.

504
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,760
Ms. An, here.

505
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,720
Bai, Qiang.

506
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,280
Did you guys receive money

507
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,000
from the company?

508
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,160
Yes, we received it.

509
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:56,960
Look.

510
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,000
Oh, my.

511
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,920
This is several months' salary.

512
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,640
That's a lot.

513
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,080
Could there be a mistake?

514
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,360
Could it?

515
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,520
Don't tell me Boss has made it big.

516
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,760
That's a possibility.

517
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:10,960
You're all here.

518
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,600
Boss.

519
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,080
- Boss.
- We missed you so much.

520
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,360
Come on, fist bump.

521
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:19,960
Sit down.

522
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,120
How's everything?

523
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,000
Monkey,

524
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,960
you lost weight.

525
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,720
Did your girlfriend mistreat you?

526
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,200
I'm sorry

527
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,760
for not returning to the studio

528
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,000
to see you all immediately.

529
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,320
Sorry about that.

530
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,600
It's okay.

531
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,560
Oh, Boss.

532
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,200
Why did you transfer
so much money to us?

533
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,600
Did you transfer it by mistake?

534
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,880
We're not going to return the money.

535
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,560
No, it was no mistake.

536
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,360
This is your bonus.

537
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,080
You've been working hard for the studio

538
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,040
when I was away during this past year.

539
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:49,760
Am I right?

540
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,200
You manage the studio so successfully.

541
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,400
So this is your reward.

542
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,040
Thank you, Boss.

543
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:55,800
Boss,

544
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,720
are you hungry?

545
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,600
Let's order some food.

546
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,480
No rush.

547
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,480
I have something else to announce.

548
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,640
I may have to shut down

549
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,880
the studio temporarily.

550
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,600
I know

551
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,920
this may be sudden

552
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,360
for you.

553
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,000
But

554
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,440
I'm helpless.

555
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,440
My family

556
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,480
is facing some financial issues.

557
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,200
So our family's factory

558
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,760
is struggling.

559
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,080
I want to allocate all the funds
from the studio

560
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,960
to the production line.

561
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,680
Also,

562
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,960
I'm only one person

563
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,160
with limited capacity.

564
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,360
I can manage the company,

565
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,720
but not the studio.

566
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,040
So I can only make this decision.

567
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,280
I'm truly sorry.

568
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,000
- It's okay, Boss.
- It's fine, Boss.

569
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,280
You don't have to apologize.
We can understand.

570
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,680
Boss.

571
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:01,280
Actually, the three of us
had already guessed.

572
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,240
You have your difficulties.

573
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,880
When something happens at home,

574
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,760
it's natural to prioritize family.

575
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,080
We all understand.

576
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,280
I'm just worried...

577
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,240
I'm worried

578
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,040
that you might have trouble
finding jobs after this.

579
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,560
Boss, don't worry about us.

580
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,480
You chose us.

581
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,240
Wherever we go,
people will be eager to hire us.

582
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,000
So don't worry.

583
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,560
That's right.

584
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,360
Don't worry

585
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,040
about our employment.

586
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,520
He's right.

587
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:23,880
You see,

588
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,160
we even won first prize.

589
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:25,840
Right, guys?

590
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,360
Yes.

591
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,760
You really don't need to worry
about our work.

592
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,640
Okay.

593
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:29,920
Boss.

594
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,360
In the future,

595
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,880
we'll be there for you
whenever you need us.

596
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,040
- Yes.
- Yes.

597
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,440
Thank you, guys.

598
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,000
It's nothing.

599
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,640
Enough said. Let's get something to eat.

600
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,880
- Okay.
- Okay.

601
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,200
Order what you want.

602
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,080
My treat.

603
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,280
Anything expensive is fine.

604
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,280
That's

605
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,800
the complete content of the proposal.

606
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,320
Do you have any other ideas?

607
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,120
Mr. Tang,

608
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,440
what do you think?

609
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,240
Not bad.

610
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,440
Xia Yuan's material

611
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,960
is quite comprehensive.

612
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,360
Personally,

613
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,120
I think we can proceed
with the project proposal right away.

614
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,160
It seems

615
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,120
the field visit was quite effective.

616
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,360
Thank you, Mr. Tang.

617
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,480
Actually, my proposal

618
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,320
still has plenty of room
for modification.

619
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,640
I hope everyone can share their thoughts

620
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,080
and brainstorm.

621
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,960
Hello, Ms. Xia.

622
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,120
Hello, Ms. Xia.

623
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,080
Did your work go smoothly?

624
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,920
It's okay.

625
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,360
Anna

626
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,480
didn't notify me of the meeting time
on purpose.

627
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,680
I was late.

628
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,600
Everyone was already there
when I arrived.

629
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,960
The meeting had already started.

630
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,760
Fortunately,

631
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,560
I was well-prepared
for the meeting content.

632
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,920
Today went pretty smoothly.

633
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,960
Why are these people so mean?

634
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,800
Don't get mad.

635
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,240
After all, it's because Ms. Xia
is beautiful and capable.

636
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,840
Jealousy is inevitable.

637
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,240
But if there's too much backstabbing,

638
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,960
won't you turn into Godzilla?

639
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,080
It's okay. We've been through

640
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,840
a lot of ups and downs abroad.

641
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,120
This is nothing.

642
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,440
I'll just be ready
for whatever comes my way

643
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,960
and face it until the end.

644
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:26,880
Good.

645
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,640
All the best.

646
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,440
Then I'll get back to work.

647
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,320
All the best to you too.

648
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,240
That's a must.

649
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,800
Don't forget to eat your meals on time.

650
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,840
Don't just think about me.

651
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,520
See you.

652
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:35,880
See you.

653
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,640
I don't see any

654
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,600
of our co-workers today.

655
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,720
I only invited you

656
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,920
from our company.

657
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,120
I'm truly sorry.

658
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,000
Yuan,

659
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,720
why are you apologizing to me?

660
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,480
I'm honored to be here.

661
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,000
It was Mr. Tang who spread the news

662
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,400
about your wedding being canceled
in the company on purpose.

663
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,520
That's impossible.

664
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,280
Yuan,

665
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,200
I think you should take a few days off.

666
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,360
I can help you handle

667
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,720
the things at the company.

668
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,040
This is my office now.

669
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,520
I'm married.

670
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,040
There might be
some job role adjustments.

671
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,880
This is your new desk.

672
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,120
(Anna.)

673
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,800
Yay!

674
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,280
Qiao Bin,

675
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,320
my parents texted

676
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,640
that they're coming to visit us.

677
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,400
What should I do?

678
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,000
I didn't buy anything.

679
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,320
It's okay.

680
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,890
[Schremser, The Waldviertler Beer]

681
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,760
Mom. Dad.

682
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,760
We're over here.

683
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,240
My dear.

684
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,800
Dad.

685
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,480
Hey, Sophia. I missed you, baby.

686
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,880
Me too.

687
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,040
Have a seat.

688
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,760
Glad to meet you.

689
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,600
I'm Ben from China.

690
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,480
I used to work as a personal trainer.

691
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,520
So will you protect my daughter?

692
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,600
Of course, I'll protect her

693
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,720
and take good care of her.

694
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,520
I'll marry her.

695
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,600
Don't be nervous.

696
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,800
My parents are easygoing.

697
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,840
You know you've broken her heart, right?

698
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,400
I don't think it's a good time
to talk about this.

699
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,760
Dad, the past is the past.

700
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,440
Please.

701
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,240
Sophia, it's okay.

702
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,960
I'm truly sorry for that.

703
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,480
My hesitation

704
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,400
has broken Sophia's heart
and made you worried.

705
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,560
But now, I'm pretty sure
I love her very much.

706
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,200
She's a brave and independent girl.

707
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,360
She's not a little princess.

708
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,760
She's also my baby girl.

709
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:11,800
So I would put all my heart
to cherish and love her.

710
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,120
Please

711
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,360
trust me.

712
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,440
Dad,

713
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,000
I'm really happy with him.

714
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,480
Okay.

715
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,480
To be honest,

716
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,600
when I heard about you,

717
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,200
I didn't like you.

718
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,320
I don't know

719
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,320
if you're good enough for my daughter.

720
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,880
But now I hear your words,

721
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,480
I think you're a good man.

722
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,880
You dedicated yourself
and are in love with her.

723
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:46,840
You're honest and a very passionate guy.

724
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,960
So I'll give you my blessing.

725
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,320
Thank you.

726
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,040
I won't let you down.

727
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,440
Okay.

728
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,400
What's your plan for the future?

729
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,520
Plan?

730
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,200
Mom, I...

731
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,520
Ben came here for me.

732
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,920
So we'll figure out

733
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,200
our future.

734
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,560
Don't worry. We'll be all right.

735
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,960
