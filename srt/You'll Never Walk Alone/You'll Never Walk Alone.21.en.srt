can you tell me

00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,040
about your past?

80
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,280

00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,040
I'm just an ordinary person.

There's nothing interesting
about my life.

83
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,480

84
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,840
no significant achievements,

85
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,600
and not much excitement in life.

86
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,120
In short,

87
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,600
it's quite boring.

91

from me?

92
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,560
What is it?

93
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,920
Penny.

94
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,840
When I first met her,

95
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,800
she was a girl

96
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,320
who loved to sing.

97
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,040
At that time,

98
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,480
my partner and I liked

99
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,320
to go to a music cafe for dinner.

100
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,960
She was the resident singer there.

101
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,000
Her voice was beautiful,

102
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,640
like an old friend

103
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,760
telling her story.

104
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,160
We became friends

105
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,640
as we went there more often.

106
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,320
Later, I opened a restaurant

107
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,480
and invited her to sing there.

108
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,880
Our interactions became more frequent.

109
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,240
After that,

110
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,520
you started dating?

111
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,160
After about three years,

112
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,480
she was discovered by talent scouts
and signed with an agency.

113
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,240
She was busy with her career.

114
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,640
During that time,

115
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,240
I became busier with my career too.

116
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,680
Gradually,

117
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,520
we drifted apart.

118
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,480
Don't you think it's a pity?

119
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,000
When we first separated,

120
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,880
I was in pain.

121
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,800
For a long time,

122
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,520
I couldn't move on
from that relationship.

123
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,960
My friends advised me to go abroad.

124
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,520
So here I am,

125
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,560
living the so-called "old person's life,"

126
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,880
as you put it.

127
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,520
After that,

128
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,600
did you two keep in touch?

129
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,960
I happened to run into her once.

130
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,720
We talked for a long time

131
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,560
and talked everything out

132
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,720
without any reservations.

133
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,240
Later, I realized
we were better off as friends.

134
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,000
I think

135
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,320
what you two had

136
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,400
wasn't love.

137
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,520
Do you know what love is?

138
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,480
I may not know

139
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,720
what love is.

140
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,840
But you can't be friends

141
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,400

00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,400
Time to get up.

191
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,080
No, let me sleep a little longer.

192
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,800
Don't you want to see it?

193
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,600
See what?

194
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,840
Sunrise.

195
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,640
Sunrise?

196
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,520
It's freezing.

197
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,880
Sir, look!

198
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,320
Sorry about yesterday.

199
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,120
I lost my temper.

200
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,440
It's okay.

201
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,480
My method worked.

202
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,040
When I came in for work just now,

203
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,520
I saw Xia Yuan and Weilai

204
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,320
keeping a distance from each other.

205
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,320
And Xia Yuan

206
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,800
looked unhappy.

207
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,240
Obviously, they had a big fight
last night.

208
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,360
Now, Weilai knows

209
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,400
how miserable this feels like.

210
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,600
That's right.

211
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,600
But their relationship

212
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,160
doesn't seem to be that stable.

213
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,240
Just a few words from us,

214
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,960
they already had a big fight.

215
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,000
You never know

216
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,600
when things might fall apart.

217
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,880
I agree with you.

218
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,760
Hurry up.

219
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,800
Slow down.

220
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,360
Come on.

221
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,160
If you can't catch up to me,

222
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm not going to wait for you.

223
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,920
Stop jumping around.

224
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,040
Watch your steps.

225
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,120
Hurry up.

226
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,280
I want to hurry home
and watch Animal World.

227
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,560
Flowers of the Motherland...

228
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,680
Siqi!

229
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,600
Siqi!

230
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,320
Siqi!

231
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,880
Siqi, stay awake.

232
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,280
Siqi.

233
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,520
Doctor,

234
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,360
is it necessary to wait
until a month later for a check-up?

235
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,160
I'm afraid her condition
might get worse.

236
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,200
Don't worry.

237
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,560
She only suffered from a shock

238
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,960
and some flesh injuries.

239
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,680
But other than these,

240
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,240
she's completely fine.

241
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,560
All she needs is proper rest

242
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,600
to recuperate.

243
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,040
Over time, her injuries will recover.

244
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,440
Okay.

245
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,000
Is there anything else I should know?

246
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,040
Like her diet and daily care?

247
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,200
By the way,

248
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,280
is there a way to relieve her pain?

249
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,160
Relax.

250
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,160
You can come with me.

251
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,640
I'll give you all the information

252
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,920
and get the medication

253
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,280
she needs for her pain,

254
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,160
okay?

255
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,600
Okay, thank you.

256
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,200
I'll be right back.

257
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,320
Get some rest.

258
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,920
Call me if there's anything.

259
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,760
Don't move around.

260
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,120
You better don't move around.

261
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,760
You must not, I tell you.

262
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,720
Go.

263
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,640
(Yuan,)

264
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,720
(what does it feel like
to love someone?)

265
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,320
(Does your heart beat faster)

266
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,200
(when you see him?)

267
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,840
(Do you feel incredibly happy)

268
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,320
(when you're with him?)

269
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,360
(Do you find
yourself smiling uncontrollably)

270
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,680
(at the mere thought of him?)

271
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,560
(Yes, I'm sure)

272
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,720
(this is love.)

273
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,400
(I've truly fallen in love with him.)

274
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,160
(Siqi,)

275
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,920
(are you sure
you've fallen in love with him,)

276
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,560
(now a momentary impulse?)

277
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,200
(Yes, Yuan.)

278
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,280
(I'm very sure of it.)

279
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,400
(I'm 100% sure of it.)

280
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:15,790
[Sorry]

281
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,520
Why did you get up?

282
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,800
I brought you something to eat.

283
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,680
Have some fish soup.

284
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,560
Here.

285
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,040
I can do it myself.

286
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,640
Just let me do it.

287
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,240
What's wrong?

288
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,360
Are you not feeling well?

289
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,040
No.

290
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,040
Maybe I'm just too hungry.

291
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,600
Here.

292
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,920
I can do it myself.

293
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,880
You're the patient now.

294
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,040
So you have to listen to me,

295
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,560
okay?

296
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,000
Here, have a sip.

297
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,880
Is it too hot?

298
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,160
Here.

299
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,720
You need

300
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,640
to learn to take care of yourself

301
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,960
because I can't be
by your side all the time.

302
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,080
Understand?

303
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,840
By the way,

304
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,680
when I'm not around these days,

305
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,640
let it take good care of you.

306
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,280
So you have to be good

307
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,720
and recuperate well.

308
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,000
Understand?

309
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,040
I'll put it here.

310
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,840
What do you think?

311
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,520
Have some more.

312
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,080
Do you want some vegetables?

313
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,680
Red light.

314
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,080
I know that.

315
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,200
It's been eleven hours
and thirty-four minutes

316
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,160
since you ignored me.

317
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,840
I'm about to shut myself off.

318
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,960
What are you doing?

319
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,520
I'm sorry. I know I was wrong.

320
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,480
I shouldn't have even asked.

321
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,080
It's wrong for me to be nosy.

322
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,640
Will you forgive me then?

323
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,760
What are you doing?

324
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,240
If you don't forgive me,

325
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,040
I'll drag you across the street

326
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,360
with my eyes closed.

327
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,960
Jeez, what's your problem?

328
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,200
You're nuts.

329
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,520
Have you watched
"A Chinese Ghost Story"?

330
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,360
When I get angry,
even I'm scared of myself.

331
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,240
Crazy.

332
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,480
Since you started talking to me,
does that mean you forgive me?

333
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,640
This will be the last time.

334
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,680
Are you going to get mad next time?

335
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,600
Hurry up. Let's go home.

336
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,840
This way, please.

337
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,520
Please enjoy.

338
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,880
What do you think?

339
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,160
Can you forgive me now?

340
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,440
I'll think about it after the meal.

341
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,840
Come on, don't think about it.

342
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,200
You've tormented me for days now.

343
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,400
You see,

344
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,520
I've deeply reflected on myself.

345
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,600
I've come around now.

346
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,360
In the future,

347
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,960
if I do something wrong,
it'll be my fault.

348
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,640
If you make a mistake,
it'll still be my fault.

349
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,640
You...

350
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,240
Excuse me?

351
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,360
Will I make mistakes?

352
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,640
No,

353
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,960
you're always right.

354
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,040
What's wrong?

355
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,080
I think I saw Song Hangyu.

356
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,760
Are you sure?

357
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,960
Then

358
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,880
do you want to go and talk to him?

359
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,520
Forget it.

360
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,040
I've decided

361
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,200
to let it go.

362
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,240
What's the point of looking for him?

363
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,000
Let's eat.

364
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,200
Hey, man. What's up?

365
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,160
Xia Yuan.

366
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,280
Xia Yuan.

367
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,440
You may have let it go.

368
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,840
But I know

369
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,760
you need closure.

370
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,680
I'll go with you.

371
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,560
Don't be scared.

372
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,880
Let's go.

373
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,920
Please.

374
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,040
Thanks, man.

375
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,160
Do you know
what's the funniest thing about today?

376
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,880
You're supposed to pay up.

377
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,960
So now,

378
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,280
if you don't pay me my money,

379
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,240
I think you might find yourself
in a little bit of trouble.

380
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,680
When is this going to end?

381
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:51,280
When you give me my money!

382
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,040
Song Hangyu.

383
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,240
Have some water.

384
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,800
Thanks.

385
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,080
How's your injury?

386
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,680
It's fine.

387
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,600
Who's that man?

388
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,640
He's my boyfriend.

389
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,440
Yuan,

390
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,560
how have you been during this time?

391
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,600
I'm doing fine.

392
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,600
I owe you an apology.

393
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,000
I know you hate me.

394
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:18,920
I also know

395
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,160
no matter what I say,
I can't make up for it.

396
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,160
But

397
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,120
I never lied to you.

398
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,840
I was sincere about you.

399
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,240
I genuinely liked you at that time

400
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,120
and wanted to go forward with you.

401
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,200
But...

402
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,720
I don't expect you to forgive me.

403
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,000
But since we've met again,

404
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,200
can we still be friends?

405
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,720
I'm lonely here.

406
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,120
I have no friends.

407
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,560
What about Kate?

408
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,320
So I came overseas

409
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,760
to find an answer,

410
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,000
to give myself an answer.

411
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,920
It's all in the past.

412
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,440
Everything is now in the past.

413
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,120
My mom is a very dominant person.

414
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,320
Since I was young, she demanded

415
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,520
that I do everything
to the best of my ability.

416
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,000
The reason I studied abroad

417
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,520
was to escape her control.

418
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,960
Later, I met Kate.

419
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,440
She was like a safe haven,

420
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,080
making me feel secure.

421
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,240
So we decided to get married.

422
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,960
But Kate's control grew stronger.

423
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,200
She wanted to know everything
and control everything.

424
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,800
I couldn't stand it anymore.

425
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,040
Yuan,

426
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,840
I originally wanted to keep it from you

427
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,640
and build a future with you.

428
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,120
But you and Kate are very alike.

429
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,600
Both of you are so dominant.

430
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:39,960
I don't want to go back

431
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,120
to those days of being controlled.

432
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,400
Yuan,

433
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,720
all of this is my fault.

434
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,040
I shouldn't have left
without saying anything.

435
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,040
Yuan,

436
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,040
I've regretted it these past few months.

437
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,280
I hate myself.

438
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,720
I hate my weakness.

439
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,720
I hate that I only know how to escape.

440
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,440
Yuan, I'm not doing well here.

441
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,680
I have no friends.

442
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,400
I don't dare
to tell my family the truth.

443
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,760
I miss you every day.

444
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,840
I get it.

445
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,600
So, will we meet again?

446
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,640
I think it's not necessary.

447
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,560
Let's not contact each other again.

448
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,320
You can go now.

449
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,560
Take good care of yourself.

450
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,880
Slowly.

451
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,360
It's not that serious.

452
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,440
Be careful.

453
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,360
I'm fine.

454
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,680
Lie down.

455
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,600
Be careful.

456
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,080
Your room is a mess.

457
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,240
After this,
it'll also be in the inspection range.

458
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,000
My room, my rules.

459
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:22,720
Wait!

460
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,000
Leave that white teddy for me.

461
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I want to hug...

462
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,640
Here you go.

463
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,280
Hold it.

464
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,760
Rest well.

465
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,480
By the way,

466
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,160
you can sleep in tomorrow.

467
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,320
Good night.

468
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,080
Good night.

469
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,960
It's completely different
from what I imagined.

470
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,360
I thought when I saw him,

471
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,960
I would break down

472
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,200
and be upset.

473
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:32,080
But just now, I feel nothing.

474
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,360
I thought I would ask many questions.

475
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,840
Why did you abandon me?

476
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,800
Why did you leave without a word?

477
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,560
But when I faced him just now,

478
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,680
I didn't need any answers.

479
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,480
I didn't want to say anything.

480
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,960
It's all in the past.

481
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,760
Xia Yuan,

482
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,000
I need to go out for a bit.

483
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,160
Why?

484
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,280
Qiao Bin wants to see me
about something.

485
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,680
Go then.

486
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,320
You called me out so urgently.

487
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,280
What's the matter?

488
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,880
I thought I saw Sophia.

489
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:39,000
But I searched for a long time
and couldn't find her.

490
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,000
Are you having hallucinations
because you miss her too much?

491
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,040
Weilai,

492
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,040
what if she deliberately hides

493
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,040
and doesn't want me to find her?

494
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,240
What should I do?

495
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,960
If she deliberately hides from you,

496
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,680
you won't be able to find her.

497
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,880
Wait until she figures it out.

498
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,760
She'll naturally come and see you.

499
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,320
Just wait.

500
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,640
You must learn from my mistake.

501
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,600
If I had given Sophia
a response earlier,

502
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,400
I wouldn't be in this situation now.

503
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,040
Xia Yuan and I are doing perfectly fine.

504
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,120
Don't worry about us.

505
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,920
Yuan, go now.

506
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,400
Who are you?

507
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,280
Get out!

508
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,800
I'm calling the police.

509
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,920
Go ahead.

510
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,000
Be my guest.

511
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,880
We're not leaving.

512
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,240
Am I right, guys?

513
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,560
But then,

514
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,520
poor Mr. Song.

515
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,840
He might have a bit of a rough time.

516
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,360
Yuan, don't worry about me.

517
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,440
Just leave.

518
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,040
Stop!

519
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,160
Now,

520
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,920
Miss Xia.

521
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,800
We really don't want to bother you.

522
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,960
But we found out that you're his wife.

523
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:10,120
Mr. Song here

524
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,760
owes us a lot of money.

525
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,200
He can't repay it.

526
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,080
So we thought

527
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,400
we could come up with some arrangement.

528
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,080
She's not my wife.

529
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,560
Just trust me.

530
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,600
She has nothing to do with this!

531
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,520
Stop it!

532
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,720
Mr. Song,

533
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,440
you're a good boy,

534
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,440
an honorable man.

535
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,240
Isn't he, guys?

536
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:44,160
But honorable men pay their debts.

537
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,840
Sir,

538
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,520
if you have nothing
to do with each other,

539
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,320
we can just leave.

540
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,320
Right, guys?

541
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,080
Why don't you say

542
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,120
your farewell to Miss Xia?

543
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,600
Okay.

544
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,640
No!

545
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,720
No, stop it!

546
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,680
Please stop!

547
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,200
Stop! Stop!

548
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,600
Okay, guys.

549
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,920
That's enough.

550
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,880
Please give us a moment alone.

551
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,120
Of course.

552
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,480
We have all the time in the world.

553
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,560
Don't we, guys?

554
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,440
As long as we get our money back.

555
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,720
Okay, we'll be outside.

556
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,520
Get up.

557
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,080
Song Hangyu, get up.

558
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,440
Get up.

559
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,120
I'll send you to the hospital.

560
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,640
Are you okay?

561
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,080
Let's go to the hospital.

562
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,600
I can still hold on.

563
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,920
Let's call the police.

564
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,720
They are very powerful.

565
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,720
Even if you call the police,

566
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,280
they'll send someone else to get me.

Song Hangyu?

611
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,920
Did he come again?
