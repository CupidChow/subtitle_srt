00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,160

85
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,000
Maybe sugar-coat the truth.

86
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,040
Sure.

87
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,400
Your confession is like

88
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,880

00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,120

and progressive.

you might really think

94
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,280

No fever.

133
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,120
What's up with you?

134
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,120

137
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,840

138
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,840
(agree to any of your requests.)

139
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,360

144
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,840

151
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,280

153
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,920

154
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,560
Of course.

155
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,400
When I found out
about my family's situation,

156
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,480
I immediately wanted to return.

157
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,880
I was worried that my old man
couldn't bear it alone.

158
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,800
I wanted to go back and help him.

159
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,160
But when I called him,

160
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:45,920
you were also there.

161
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,520
You saw his attitude.

162
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,160
He didn't want me to go back.

163
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,480
I get it after giving it some thoughts.

164
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,040
Since he doesn't want me to go back,

165
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,600
I should respect his decisions.

166
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,920
I should trust him

167
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,640
and realise the promise
I've made to him.

168
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,000
When the time comes,

169
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,960
I'll return immediately.

170
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,440
And, I'd prove to him

171
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,920
I was able to live well alone

172
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,760

But job aren't easy to come by.

174
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,720

175
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,240
Let's go car-hopping.

176
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,000
Car-hopping?

177
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,040
Yeah.

178
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,360
Car-hopping is

179
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,080
a unique recruitment method in Europe,

180
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,120
where all unemployed people

181
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,320
gather together.

182
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,200
Employers drive to that place

183
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,000
and if they agree
with each other's terms,

184
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,120
they hop on the employer's vehicle

185
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,680
and follow them to the workplace.

186
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,880
Sounds highly efficient.

187
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,160
So? Do you want to give it a try?

188
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,640
Let's go.

189
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,840
Meat factory needs three workers.

190
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,920
Eighteen Euros an hour.

191
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,760
Who wants it?

192
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,600
Here, here.

193
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,040
You, you and you.

194
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,480
Come with me.

195
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,000
I'm looking for female employees

196
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,680
to do farm work.

197
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,160
I want you,

198
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,360
and, yeah, you.

199
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,400
Come with me.

200
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,320
Hello.

201
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,080
Our restaurant needs a female waitress.

202
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,000
Be ready. A job opportunity is here.

203
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,200
Twenty Euros an hour.

204
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,320
Here, here.

205
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,120
You're Chinese?

206
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,200
Yes, I am.

207
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,200
Okay. You should do. Come on.

208
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:21,760
Really?

209
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,680
Sir,

210
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,800
can I go with her?

211
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,280
We're together.

212
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,040
No. We only need female workers.

213
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,600
Don't worry about me.

214
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,240
I'll call you when I'm there.

215
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,400
- Okay. Let's go.
- Go on.

216
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,680
Be safe.

217
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,480
Bye.

218
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,120
Can I?

219
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,960
Yes.

220
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,360
That was easy.

221
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,800
Bye.

222
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,360
Kim.

223
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,800
He's our manager.

224
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,120
Thank you.

225
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,200
I'm the manager of this restaurant.

226
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:27,760
Hi.

227
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,000
What's your name?

228
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,560
My name is Xia Yuan.

229
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,440
Where are you from?

230
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,840
Shanghai, China.

231
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,720
I see.

232
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,720
Follow me. I'll show you inside.

233
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,480
Thank you.

234
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,320
I can.

235
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,000
Yeah?

236
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,880
What about us?

237
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,760
I'm looking for woman candidates.

238
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,720
Thank you. It's a pity.

239
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,600
Is there any woman

240
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,080
looking for a job in Chinatown?

241
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,640
Just come look for me.

242
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,120
Hey, are you Chinese?

243
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,880
Yes, I am.

244
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,040
Do you hire

245
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,880
males as waiters?

246
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,960
Sorry. We're only looking
for female candidates.

247
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,880
I see.

248
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,480
I could be on probation for a day.

249
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,520
If you think I'm doing a good job,

250
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,360
I'll continue to work.

251
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,480
If you think
I'm not suitable for the job,

252
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,040
you can dismiss me at anytime.

253
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,080
But we only need female staff.

254
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,280
I can speak English and Mandarin.

255
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,600
I can also speak a little
of other languages.

256
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,600
There are no female recruiters now.

257
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,240
Why don't you give me a chance?

258
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,920
Sure.

259
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,400
Thank you.

260
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,160
Xia Yuan, please help me.

261
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,680
Okay.

262
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,960
Put this inside this dishes, okay?

263
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,560
Okay. The ketchup?

264
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:08,960
Yes.

265
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,040
Should I mix it?

266
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,200
Yes, you can.

267
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,280
Okay.

268
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,970
[Expiry Date: 30 September 2018]

269
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,440
Sorry.

270
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,160
This ketchup is expired.

271
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,680
Can I get another one?

272
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,120
It's not your business.

273
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,720
You just work.

274
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,400
No.

275
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,840
We will get in trouble.

276
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,440
It would get people sick.

277
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,640
No.

278
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,120
Sorry?

279
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,560
She doesn't want to work.

280
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,920
Sorry. I don't mean that.

281
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,880
Why?

282
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,280
Sorry, Mr. Kim.

283
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,840
The ketchup is expired.

284
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,400
I pay you money to work here.

285
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,640
You don't have to worry about the food.

286
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,680
I'm sorry.

287
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,120
This is our responsibility
to the customers.

288
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,840
We cannot provide them
with expired food.

289
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,120
It will land us in trouble.

290
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,080
People will get sick from it.

291
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,520
Shut up.

292
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,080
I pay you money to work here.

293
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,080
It's not your responsibility.

294
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,080
But this is expired.

295
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,640
Excuse me?

296
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,360
Yes, this place is quite suitable.

297
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,600
You're here.

298
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,560
Hello. Sorry I'm late.

299
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,400
Hello, Mr. Kim.

300
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,920
Please, seat.

301
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,280
How's the wine from our company?

302
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,000
Do you like it?

303
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,920
Yeah, I like it.

304
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,760
But the price point

305
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,600
is not that competitive.

306
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,240
You know,

307
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,000
because we already got stable suppliers,

308
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,120
we got to think about it.

309
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,440
I get it.

310
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,920
I already tried your dishes.

311
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,760
I think our wine

312
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,720
is best for your restaurant.

313
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,280
You can provide our wine

314
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,000
to your customers for free.

315
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,080
If they like it,

316
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,920
we can think about a cooperation.

317
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,000
Sure.

318
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,560
What are you doing?

319
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,600
It's none of your business.

320
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,640
Alice,

321
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,840
please, call the manager.

322
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,200
What? Excuse me.

323
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,800
It should not be a problem, Uncle Quan.

324
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,760
What happened?

325
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,960
She just took a picture.

326
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,080
Did you take the picture?

327
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,040
Did you take the picture?

328
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,600
Sorry, Mr. Kim.

329
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,560
It's none of your business.

330
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,200
I quit.

331
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,760
And, I'm leaving now.

332
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,200
What are you doing?

333
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,720
Don't touch me.

334
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,440
Give me the file.

335
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,360
Don't touch me.

336
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,880
Give me the file.

337
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,440
No. Stop.

338
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,680
- Go away.
- Give me the file.

339
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,920
Go away.

340
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,680
No, no.

341
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,680
Help.

342
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,920
- No. Go away.
- Give me the file.

343
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,800
No. Stop it.

344
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,120
What are you doing? No.

345
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,240
- Xia Yuan?
- No.

346
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,240
No. Stop it.

347
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,120
- Stop it.
- Yuan.

348
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:13,920
Are you all right?

349
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,760
Hui, why are you here?

350
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,480
Ask her to delete the picture.

351
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
What's happened?

352
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,560
They used a big amount
of expired ingredients.

353
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,120
I took photos as evidence,

354
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,840
and he discovered it.

355
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,720
Our business is done.

356
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,280
We have no interest
in doing business with you right now.

357
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,520
And, what you have done is illegal.

358
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,440
Let's go, Yuan.

359
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,440
Okay. Your business is over.

360
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,240
You

361
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,320
shouldn't just continue waiting.

362
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,960
You should take the initiative.

363
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,920
You know that?

364
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,840
What are you even talking about?

365
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,200
I don't even know anything about her.

366
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,720
Go through her friends, then.

367
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,640
(Been there, done that.)

368
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,240
(I've contacted all her friends.)

369
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,120
(What are you doing?)

370
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,280
I'm making Xia Yuan a bento.

371
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:12,760
By the way,

372
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,960
how's job search going for you?

373
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:18,840
I secured myself a job.

374
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,600
Hang on while I answer the phone.

375
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,360
Hello, Xia Yuan?

376
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,080
Okay. I'm on my way.

377
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,320
Bye.

378
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,840
Yuan,

379
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,640
have some water.

380
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,160
- Thank you.
- Are you feeling better?

381
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,600
Are you all right, Xia Yuan?

382
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,560
- I'm fine.
- Are you injured?

383
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,200
I'm fine.

384
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:49,840
Let me see.

385
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,040
I'm fine.

386
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,600
Why are your hands red?

387
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,280
Where's that black-hearted boss?

388
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,600
I'll kill him if I get the chance to.

389
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,240
I have already handed over
the evidence to the police.

390
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,880
They are looking into the matter.

391
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,320
It's my fault

392
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,680
for not taking good care of you.

393
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,640
It's not your fault.

394
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,200
Hui

395
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,080
and Uncle Quan came
to my rescue just now.

396
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,720
Thank you, Hui.

397
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,560
You're welcome.

398
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,760
Have you both secured jobs
for yourselves?

399
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,240
It's a yes for me.

400
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,920
But I think Xia Yuan
just lost her job again.

401
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,440
It's fine.

402
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,920
We'll find a way.

403
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,040
My father's Alzheimer's disease

404
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,200
is getting worse and worse.

405
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,120
Most of my time

406
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,440
is spent in the winery now,

407
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,960
and I really don't have time
to manage the restaurant.

408
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,600
So I'd like to invite you two

409
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,000
to help me manage the restaurant.

410
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,680
Because this restaurant

411
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,240
is started in memory of my mother.

412
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,640
I don't want it to close down like this.

413
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,680
What do you mean?

414
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,320
Are you trying to steal me?

415
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,440
I just got myself a job.

416
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,920
We won't even consider your offer

417
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,760
without a promotion and salary increase.

418
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:08,720
Sure.

419
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:09,760
I've got that sorted.

420
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,040
Hey, Jack.

421
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:27,720
Hey, Ben,

422
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,680
Jack, I can't find Sofia.

423
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,160
Do you know where she is?

424
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,200
No, sorry.

425
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,000
She hasn't been here for a while.

426
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,200
I called her

427
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,240
but she didn't answer.

428
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,160
Do you know how I can contact her?

429
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,000
Yeah. I have her email address.

430
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,440
I'll send it to you later, okay?

431
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,400
Exert from your waist.

432
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,800
Lower your body.

433
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,800
Then exert from your waist again.

434
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,040
Do it this way.

435
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,360
Got it?

436
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,240
But I always get it wrong.

437
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:52,960
I'll

438
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,400
record a sample video for you.

439
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,080
Why don't you pass me
your email address?

440
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:56,960
Okay.

441
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,440
Sure. I'll wait for it.

442
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,480
Okay. Perfect, Ben.

443
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,840
- Bye.
- Bye.

444
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,120
These two

445
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,840
are the newly hired managers
of our restaurant,

446
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,760
Mr. Hao Weilai and Madam Xia Yuan.

447
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,000
Let's welcome them.

448
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,400
Hello.

449
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,920
I'm Hao Weilai.

450
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,080
We don't have much experience

451
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,720
in food and beverage management.

452
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,680
Please

453
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,040
be kind to us.

454
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,360
I'm Xia Yuan.

455
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,200
Let's

456
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,720
work hard together

457
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,000
and make
Zhen's Chinese Restaurant great.

458
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,160
I hope everyone can cooperate
with the management

459
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,240
and together,

460
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,080
we'll bring Zhen's Chinese Restaurant
to greater heights.

461
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,080
Long,

462
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,120
why don't you

463
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,440
show them around?

464
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,120
Okay.

465
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,400
This way, please.

466
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,560
Get busy, everyone.

467
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,280
Please, please.

468
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,360
Yes.

469
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,040
That table.

470
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,640
Hey, your head's always down
settling accounts.

471
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,600
It'd hurt your neck.

472
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,840
You should occasionally look up

473
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,000
at the handsome me.

474
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,600
We're working. Be serious.

475
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,040
Get busy.

476
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,200
I said get busy.

477
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,360
Yes, Ma'am.

478
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,000
Go on.

479
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,400
Are you ready?

480
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:27,880
Yeah.

481
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,600
I'm ready.

482
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,040
We'll start now.

483
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,040
Here.

484
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:38,680
Come on.

485
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,680
How do I look?

486
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,160
Handsome.

487
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,800
Three, two, one.

488
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,120
Go.

489
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,360
Hi, Sofia.

490
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,120
Long time no see.

491
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,480
Look.

492
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,960
This is where we first met.

493
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,080
I'm back again.

494
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,400
And, this time around,

495
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,000
I have many things to say to you.

496
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,040
I'd like to say

497
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,120
that I'm sorry.

498
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,800
Actually,

499
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,960
I knew how you felt about me all along.

500
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,640
But I was scared to reciprocate

501
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,280
and made you wait for so long.

502
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,520
So to be fair,

503
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,840
I'll wait here for you this time.

504
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,440
I'll wait here for you to come back.

505
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,360
Sofia,

506
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,200
I love you.

507
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,470
[I love you, Sofia]

508
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,720
What's wrong?

509
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,000
I

510
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,240
think I forgot to switch the camera on.

511
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,560
Uhm. Can we do a take two?

512
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,720
Chen Zhiqun.

513
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,000
Our boss

514
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,800
is fond of that newcomer Xia Yuan.

515
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,160
It's obvious even to me.

516
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,200
These few days,

517
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,320
he'd see Xia Yuan first thing

518
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,280
when he arrives here.

519
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,400
What's funny is,

520
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,200
that Weilai

521
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,400
doesn't know a thing about it.

522
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,200
Of course, he can't find out about it.

523
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,560
What can't I know?

524
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,280
Interesting, huh?

525
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,640
Yeah.

526
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,760
This one. It's not bad.

527
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,240
What about this one?

528
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:20,760
Siqi,

529
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,800
get my glasses for me.

530
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,280
Boss,

531
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,880
there's something
I want to talk to you about.

532
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:27,800
What is it?

533
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,880
But you must not get upset.

534
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,400
Go ahead.

535
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,960
Actually, when you put on your glasses,

536
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,200
you look like a veteran cadre.

537
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,800
A veteran cadre?

538
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,720
I think

539
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,160
you should make some changes.

540
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,760
Such as?

541
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:04,880
Boss,

542
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,040
how do you feel?

543
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,480
Not bad.

544
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,640
Boss,

545
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,880
this is for you.

546
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,600
From now on,

547
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,840
ditch the glasses

548
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,320
for contact lenses.

549
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,080
I guarantee

550
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,480
that it'd take you
from uncle to an older brother.

551
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,820
[Sofia, I love you]

552
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:00,320
[Email sent]

553
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,880
Come in.

554
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,360
What are you doing?

555
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,800
The Chinese restaurants in Chinatown

556
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,600
are quite similar.

557
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,760
So I'm planning

558
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,520
to design something unique.

559
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,280
Are you this serious
in everything you do?

560
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,200
Of course.

561
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,240
How do you find

562
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,960
the work

563
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,720
at the restaurant?

564
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,920
Jobs are scarce.

565
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,760
We've gotten used to working
at the restaurant.

566
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,640
Why don't

567
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,640
we

568
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,240
give it some time?

569
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,280
What's up?

570
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,160
I'm just afraid you can't stand

571
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,800
the gossip of restaurant staff.

572
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,040
They talk so badly

573
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,520
about our relationship.

574
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,760
It's enough that you know it.

575
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,640
Most importantly,

576
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,080
is that our conscience clear,

577
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,640
and prove them wrong with our actions.

578
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,160
That'd be the loudest clap-back.

579
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,320
If we leave now,

580
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,720
it's like we're escaping.

581
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,080
Then,

582
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,040
do we need

583
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,600
to show them

584
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,000
some display of affection?

585
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,200
What do you mean?

586
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,360
Well,

587
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,800
we could hug,

588
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,080
kiss,

589
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,600
- and hold hands.
- Stop.

590
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,200
Get out.

591
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,400
I'm going to bed.

592
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,600
Bye.

593
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,920
Goodnight.

594
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:02,000
You're going to bed?
Then, I'm going to be all alone.

595
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,120
I'm asleep.

596
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,080
Me too.

597
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,080
Go to your room.

598
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,720
Go to bed.

599
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,080
Waiter.

600
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:30,920
Yes.

601
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,920
Waiter.

602
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,360
Hello.

603
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,560
Look.

604
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,760
There's a strand of hair.

605
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,920
Get your manager.

606
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,920
I apologise.

607
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,320
Manager.

608
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,680
Please come over.

609
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,520
What's wrong?

610
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,400
There was a strand of hair
in this customer's dish.

611
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,600
Get on with your stuff.

612
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,440
You're the manager?

613
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,040
See for yourself.

614
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,560
It's such a long strand of hair.

615
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,920
We came to enjoy the dishes

616
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,120
and not hair.

617
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,760
We are deeply sorry

618
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,720
for what happened.

619
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,120
It is our fault.

620
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:08,920
Why don't

621
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,840
I replace this dish?

622
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,240
Put it down.

623
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,280
Put it down.

624
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,520
There's already hair in this dish,

625
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,080
why would I possibly want another dish?

626
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,080
We came to eat

627
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,280
because of your good reputation.

628
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,320
If you can't even guarantee

629
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,640
basic hygiene,

630
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,080
do you think we'll come again?

631
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,520
We're deeply sorry.

632
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,360
Sir,

633
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,520
would it be okay

634
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,880
that we put

635
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,240
your entire order

636
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,760
on the house,

637
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,160
and gift you complimentary desserts.

638
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,560
And if you ever feel unwell

639
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,040
after the meal,

640
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,080
you could see me.

641
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,080
I'm the person-in-charge here.

642
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,120
My name is Xia Yuan.

643
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,080
We're deeply sorry.

644
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,760
Okay. I'll forget it.

645
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,440
We're deeply sorry.

646
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,160
I'll replace this dish.

647
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,680
We apologise

648
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,600
to have affected your mood to dine.

649
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,600
Please take your time.

650
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,320
We're sorry again.

651
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,040
We're here?

652
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,400
Let's go.

653
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,960
Today's incident

654
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,600
has brought
an extremely negative impact,

655
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,760
so there will be a deduction of wages.

656
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,200
Wait. Wait.

657
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,600
On what grounds are you doing that?

658
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,480
That hair might not even be ours.

659
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,240
It could be the waiters'.

660
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,120
I didn't say that you're
bearing the deduction alone.

661
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,560
I'll be the first
to have my wages deducted.

662
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,040
All who handled this dish

663
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:28,720
will have their wages deducted.

664
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,360
The customer did not request
for compensation.

665
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:30,960
Besides,

666
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,400
there is no loss on the books.

667
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,800
Yes.

668
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,120
But it has had
an extremely negative impact

669
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,640
on the reputation of our restaurant.

670
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,000
The impact on our reputation
does far more damage

671
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,120
than loss on the books.

672
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,160
I hope this won't happen again.

673
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,480
Or else,

674
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,720
don't blame me for being cruel.

675
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,720
Who does he think he is?

676
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,640
What a parasite. Let's go.

677
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,760
You two, hurry up
and bring the wine over.

678
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,400
Hurry.

679
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,600
You're here, Uncle Scar.

680
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,160
Xia Yuan,

681
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,840
I have something to pass to you.

682
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,680
Have our stock arrived?

683
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,520
Yes.

684
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,560
Xia Yuan,

685
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,560
this is for you.

686
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,360
Young Master said this rose is the
prettiest in the whole of the winery.

687
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,400
Well, Uncle Scar,

688
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,880
please thank Hui for me.

689
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,560
I think

690
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,080
it's better to leave
the flower in the winery.

691
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,120
This is no place

692
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,360
for nurturing flowers.

693
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,080
Young Master repeated told me

694
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,600
to personally give this to you.

695
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,360
If you don't accept it,

696
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,600
I won't be able to explain it to him.

697
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,160
I...

698
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,720
Just accept it.

699
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,400
I'm in a hurry to move the goods.

700
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,040
Okay.

701
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,240
Thank you, Uncle Scar.

702
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,440
Who does he think he is?

703
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,600
He got this job

704
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,840
because of Xia Yuan.

705
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,920
Yeah.

706
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,400
And he even thinks of himself as boss

707
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,600
and deduct our wages.

708
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,080
This won't do.

709
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,440
We need to find a way to deal with him

710
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,880
and show him who's boss.

711
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,360
Let's

712
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,880
talk about Xia Yuan and Boss

713
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,480
to upset him

714
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,520
when he comes in later.

715
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,600
Let's see what he can do.

716
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:40,840
Xia Yuan,

717
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,840
you forgot your flower.

718
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,640
Take it.

719
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,880
It's just so beautiful.

720
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,880
Take it.

721
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,000
Thank you.

722
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,520
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

723
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,760
I heard, Xia Yuan called our boss.

724
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,680
Guess. What does Xia Yuan

725
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,800
call our boss?

726
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,320
Honey-Hui.

727
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,320
Honey-Hui, listen.

728
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,960
Hello, Honey-Hui?

729
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,600
Let's go for a meal

730
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,680
tomorrow.

731
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,440
And, Xia Yuan

732
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,800
did this when Weilai's not around.

733
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,360
I don't know what else to call it
if not a guilty conscience.

734
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,400
Yeah.

735
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,840
Did you see

736
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,880
that Xia Yuan got a rose?

737
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,800
Our boss

738
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,120
is really becoming more and more brazen.

739
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,000
Yeah.

740
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,040
Li Yan,

741
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,800
devein the prawns.

742
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,560
They are not cleaned.

743

[Chopping board]

744
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,200
We're here.

745
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,480
Give this to me.

746
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,960
You go sit.

747
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,000
Do you know how to set up a tent?

748
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,200
Go on.

749
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,320

769
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,840

Have a taste.

Smells so good.

779
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,080
Who gave you the rose
that's placed at the entrance?

weren't given by someone else?

00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,200
Right.
