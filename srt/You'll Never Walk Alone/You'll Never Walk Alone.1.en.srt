00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,280
I'll ask my friend to send
a few more bottles to you then.

189
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,160
You are so considerate.

190
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,920
If only we had known each other earlier.

191
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,720
It's not too late
to know each other now.

192
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,080
Let's eat something first.

193
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,280
I really like this restaurant.

194
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,600
I come here often.

195
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,440
Let's see what you think about it.

196
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,120
By the way, Weilai,

197
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,560
what's your horoscope?

198
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,320
Me? I'm Leo.

199
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,760
Leo?

200
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,520
Leo usually has great leadership.

201
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,480
That's good.

202
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,720
I guessed that you were Leo just now.

203
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,920
I don't think I have
many leadership qualities.

204
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,080
But I'm a little bit controlling.

205
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,800
These are all my shortcomings.

206
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,560
You are too humble.

207
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,960
Liu Yun.

208
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,440
My dad told you

209
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,360
that we'll talk
about something important today, right?

210
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,320
I never thought
that it would be so soon.

211
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,240
It's quite soon.

212
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,000
But we don't have to waste time
on unnecessary procedures.

213
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,880
I think what matters
the most is communication.

214
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,040
I want to know

215
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,320
about your future plans

216
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,080
and arrangements.

217
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,640
I don't have any special plans.

218
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,680
After all, I'm a woman.

219
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,960
I'm more emotional.

220
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,800
You are a man. You are more rational.

221
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,440
So, you can make all the decisions.

222
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,360
What are you talking about?

223
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,080
What's wrong with being a woman?

224
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,280
Look at how successful you are, right?

225
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,640
Dad, Mum, I'm back.

226
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,720
Dad, Mum.

227
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,600
She's back.

228
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:16,880
♪Happy birthday to you♪

229
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,800
- Happy birthday to you.
- Happy birthday.

230
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,160
Come. Make a wish.

231
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,960
Make a wish.

232
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,520
Good.

233
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,320
Happy birthday.

234
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,600
I hope that we can

235
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,720
communicate more with each other

236
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,000
to avoid conflicts.

237
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Yes.

238
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,000
Actually, I don't have much to say.

239
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,040
I just hope

240
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,400
that we can settle down
as soon as possible.

241
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,160
Of course.

242
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,480
That's what I want as well.

243
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,160
Actually, after so many years,
I rarely...

244
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:05,880
No. Not rarely.

245
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,160
I've never met

246
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,160
a partner like you with alacrity.

247
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,440
A partner?

248
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,280
I understand what you mean now.

249
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,400
That's great.

250
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,440
How about this?

251
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,320
When I'm free, I'll give you
the contract as soon as possible

252
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,120
within the next two days.

253
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,360
If there's any issue with it,

254
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,640
you can contact me and tell me about it.

255
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,720
Okay?

256
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,840
A contract?

257
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,120
Weilai, I know that you are
starting your own business.

258
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,720
So, it has become a habit
to use a contract or something similar

259
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,920
to protect
your own rights and interests.

260
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,640
But we are just dating.

261
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,560
There's no need
to be so frigid about it.

262
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,800
What

263
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,520
are you talking about? Dating?

264
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,600
You said that we were partners.

265
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,080
We are a couple.

266
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,640
I...

267
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,880
What I meant was business partners.

268
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,360
Liu Yun, did you
misunderstand something?

269
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,640
Or did my dad not tell you

270
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,640
that I'm here for business?

271
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,480
I'm not here to get into a relationship.

272
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,760
Hao Weilai.

273
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,760
I think I've misunderstood you.

274
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,680
I'm not here
to talk business with you today.

275
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,840
I'm sorry.

276
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,200
Let's call it a day.

277
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,040
Liu Yun.

278
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,160
I think we hit it off quite well.

279
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,240
Maybe we can be friends first.

280
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,400
We can talk business again next time.

281
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,600
We hit it off quite well?

282
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,320
I think you just want me
to invest in you.

283
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,600
I...

284
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,360
This is awkward.

285
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,600
It's so delicious.

286
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,880
Mum, I still have some work
to do for the company.

287
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,440
I'll go back to my room now.

288
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,000
You and Dad can enjoy the cake.

289
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,400
Yuan.

290
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,160
You have to eat the cake.

291
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,120
You can eat it in your room.

292
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,480
Okay.

293
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,560
Yuan.

294
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,280
Remember.

295
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,640
No matter what happens,

296
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,800
you'll always have us.

297
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,560
Don't worry.

298
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,040
From now on,

299
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,560
things will only get better for you.

300
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,160
Okay.

301
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,800
I'll go back to my room now.

302
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,280
Go.

You can learn from me now.

321

Breathe in.

322
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,880
Breathe out. Relax.

323
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,680
Boss.

324
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,280
I think we are dozing off instead

325
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,200
of meditating.

326
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,680
Yes, Boss.

327
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,320
I know that it's not easy for you.

328
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,840
But it's not easy for us too.

329
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,960
Qiang, how can you
talk like that to him?

330
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,080
Sit down.

331
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,120
Boss, Qiang is too straightforward.

332
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,720
But comes to think of it,

333
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,720
we haven't been paid for three months.

334
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,840
I can't even buy
a gift for my girlfriend.

335
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,160
And we can't explain it
to our family, Boss.

336
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,440
I know that it hasn't been easy for you.

337
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,080
All of you

338
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,000
are hand-picked by me.

339
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,840
I trust you completely.

340
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,920
Our studio has just been set up
for a few months.

341
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,840
And we already developed
an APP for others.

342
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,560
And we've very good market feedback.

343
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,480
What does it prove?

344
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,200
It proves that we are all capable.

345
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,280
Right?

346
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,240
This is just a slight setback
for us right now.

347
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,560
So, we need to look for the reason.

348
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,560
What's the reason?

349
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,240
We don't have our own APP, right?

350
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:10,840
So, we need

351
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,240
to create our own APP

352
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,640
and build our own brand

353
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,120
so that we can be successful, right?

354
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:15,960
That's right.

355
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,000
You are right.

356
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,760
Yes.

357
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,320
You are right.

358
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,400
I think that it's good to have a dream.

359
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,160
And the three of us
have worked really hard.

360
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:24,480
Yes.

361
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,480
If you treat us well,

362
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,520
we'll do everything we can
to support you.

363
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,160
But...

364
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,560
Boss, look.

365
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,640
The three of us
are just ordinary people.

366
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,120
We need food to eat, clothes to wear
and girlfriends to date.

367
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,360
We need to make a living

368
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,960
to survive.

369
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,720
Now,

370
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,840
we can't even afford
to pay for our basic needs.

371
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,360
If I don't get paid,

372
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,800
I don't think I can
continue working here.

373
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,720
I'll come up with a solution.

374
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,240
Hello. May I ask

375
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,680
if Song Hangyu has come
to the company recently?

376
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,280
Song Hangyu?

377
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,040
He has already quit.

378
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,120
Quit?

379
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,120
Penny.

380
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,240
Do you have some autographs with you?

381
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,720
Keep it down.

382
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,240
Give me two.

383
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,400
Do you think I'll take

384
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,240
my autographs with me at all times?

385
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,360
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

386
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,440
I can give you some next time.

387
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,440
Okay.

388
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,800
I think I've offended our dad again.

389
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,440
What did you do again?

390
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,160
He introduced

391
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,960
the daughter of the Liu family to me.

392
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,120
I thought he was introducing
a business partner to me.

393
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,680
I never thought that she

394
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,760
would be like that.

395
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:56,880
What do you mean?

396
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,160
It was a blind date.

397
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,560
And she was so forward.

398
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,800
Is she pretty?

399
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,200
Stop it.

400
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,560
Not bad.

401
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,400
Isn't that great?

402
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,440
I don't like the feeling

403
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,200
of being controlled by someone.

404
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,160
Forget about that.

405
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,760
Penny.

406
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,880
I'm sure our dad won't give me
some money now.

407
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,240
Give me some to help me stay afloat.

408
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,200
No.

409
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,960
You should solve your own mess.

410
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,000
Forget it, then. I'll get going now.

411
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Don't go.

412
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,440
I haven't finished my coffee yet.

413
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,520
It's not every day that I get
to come out and drink coffee.

414
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,400
Are you Ms. Penny?

415
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,560
- Ms. Penny.
- Ms. Penny.

416
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,200
Ms. Penny, please sign for me.

417
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,960
Please sign on my hand.

418
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,800
Ms. Penny.

419
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,080
Thank you.

420
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,200
Mr. Song, Mrs. Song.

421
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,160
Why are you here?

422
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,120
Mrs. Song?

423
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,440
Has Hangyu contacted you lately?

424
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,280
Now, you want to contact Hangyu?

425
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,760
Do you only care about my son now?

426
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,160
When he was having

427
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,680
thirty-nine degrees high fever,

428
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,000
why didn't you put your work aside

429
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,320
to take care of him?

430
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,360
My son

431
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,000
called me because
he was suffering too much.

432
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,440
When I went to him,

433
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,120
do you know what he told me?

434
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,520
He asked me

435
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,440
not to disturb you.

436
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,200
You love working so much,

437
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,840
you can just get married to your work.

438
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,200
From now on,

439
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,600
don't come and bother our son anymore.

440
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,560
Let's go.

441
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,600
Mrs. Song.

442
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,160
- Mr. Song.
- Come. Let's go home.

Please take a look.

455
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,800
I'm sorry. There are
some changes to the event.

Please leave the stage for now.

457
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,480

She was supposed to be after us.

466
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,600
But what is going on?

467
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,440
Does she have no respect
for the schedule?

468
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,680
Kiki, what's going on right now?

469
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,160
Are we going to wait here?

470
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,080
Now that Penny is here,
there'll be no place for us.

471
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,080
Don't worry.
I'll ask them to give us an explanation.

472
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,600
Forget it.

473
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,080
Let's not make a big deal out of it.

474
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,640
Forget it. Let's just deal with it.

475
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,320
Who's the captain here?

476
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,120
I am.

477
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,440
This is today's payment.
Thank you for your hard work.

478
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,320
Thank you.

479
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,280
Why is it so much less than promised?

480
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,400
At first, you were supposed
to perform two songs.

481
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,200
But you only performed one song.

482
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,520
So, the pay has been cut by half.

483
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,000
You are the ones
who changed the plan suddenly.

484
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,720
We weren't notified about it.

485
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,200
We are the victims too.

486
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,560
We can't do anything

487
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,760
about the change of plan.

488
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,520
There has been a change
in Penny's schedule.

489
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,680
We spent a lot of money
to invite Penny here.

490
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,760
You should feel honored

491
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,600
to perform on the same stage as her.

492
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,160
I hate people like her
who do whatever they want

493
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,320
just because they are famous.

494
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,240
I'll go and confront her.

495
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,280
Enough.

496
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,760
She has already left.

497
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,880
Dear, I'm back.

498
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,000
Why are you eating this again?

499
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,320
You can't cook,

500
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,120
and I can't cook.

501
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,240
If I don't eat instant noodles,

502
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,200
I'll starve to death.

503
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,520
You can order food delivery.

504
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,400
That's expensive.

505
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,800
I don't want to waste money.

506
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,280
It's convenient
to just eat instant noodles.

507
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,120
Put that down.

508
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:45,840
Eat this.

509
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,840
Fried chicken?

510
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,360
You bought fried chicken for me?

511
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,760
It's so good.

512
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,760
Why did you buy fried chicken?

513
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,200
It's expensive.

514
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,120
You should be frugal.

515
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,200
I have so many clients now.
I have money.

516
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,960
I know that you are the best.

517
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,920
But we are newly married.
We don't have much savings.

518
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,280
We still need to be frugal.

519
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,320
I know that you are working hard.

520
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,680
But don't give yourself
too much pressure.

521
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,760
Okay.

522
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,480
Dear, you are so kind.

523
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:21,920
Cry.

524
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,240
Shouldn't you cry because
you feel touched?

525
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,920
Cry.

526
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,520
Wait.

527
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,960
You look like a dummy. Cry again.

528
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,440
- Who is it?
- Who is it?

529
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,400
I'm coming.

530
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,400
Qiao Bin, I have something to tell you.

531
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,040
We can talk here.

532
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,080
Let's talk inside.

533
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,280
I want to take a look at my house too.

534
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,160
Don't. Well...

535
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,320
Why are you being so mysterious?

536
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,280
What happened to the floor?

537
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,240
Qiao Bin, who is she?

538
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,680
She is...

539
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,600
Look at what you are wearing.

540
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,360
Only my granddaughter
will wear something like this.

541
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,840
Qiao Bin, who is she?

542
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,240
My wife.

543
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,000
Qiao Bin, who is she?

544
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,280
She's a relative of mine.

545
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,200
Who's your relative?

546
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,240
I am the landlady.

547
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,640
My son is going to get married soon.

548
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,080
I have to renovate this house.

549
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,680
I'll give you one month.

550
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,120
You'll move away next month.

551
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,240
Okay now. I don't need to say much.

552
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,120
I'll get going now.

553
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,040
The landlady?

554
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,360
Qiao Bin!

555
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,280
I'm sorry, Dear. Tell me.
How long should I kneel?

556
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,000
How dare you lie to me, Qiao Bin.

557
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,680
I didn't do it on purpose.

558
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,200
Qiao Bin.

559
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,360
It doesn't matter
that you can't afford a house.

560
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,680
You can tell me.

561
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,600
I hate it when someone lies to me.

562
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,280
I'm afraid that you'll look down on me.

563
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,400
I'm worried that you won't marry me
because I don't have a house.

564
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,640
Do you think I'm with you

565
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,240
because of a house?

566
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,240
Am I that kind of person in your eyes?

567
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,520
I'm so disappointed in you.

568
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,080
Siqi.

569
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,160
I don't want to see you. Go away.

570
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,040
No.

571
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,960
If you don't go, I'll go.

572
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,800
No. I'll go.

573
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,920
I'll leave.

574
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,160
Sit down.

575
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,960
Don't be mad.

576
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,920
Call me if you need me.

577
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,480
Dad, I'm sorry.

578
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,200
What's the point of apologizing?

579
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,520
Do you know

580
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,440
that the Liu Group
is a major client of ours?

581
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,240
I know.

582
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,600
That's why I said that I was wrong

583
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,840
and apologized to you.

584
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,360
If you are sincere,

585
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,280
apologise to Miss Liu tomorrow.

586
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,720
Okay.

587
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,120
Dad, well.

588
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,400
I need to pay the wages for my studio.

589
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,480
You want money again.

590
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,120
It's about your studio again.

591
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,760
All you think about is your studio.

592
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,640
Miss Liu really likes you.

593
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,480
But what about you?

594
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,080
What you did was a humiliation to her!

595
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,240
You don't want to work for the company.

596
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,480
Fine, I won't force you.

597
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,400
You say that you have your own dream.

598
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,800
Fine. I support you.

599
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,240
But what is your dream?

600
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,840
Those applications?

601
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,320
There are so many applications
in the market.

602
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,440
Why do you think you can be successful?

603
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,680
With your empty talk?

604
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,440
Yes. I'm all empty talk.

605
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,560
Did you tell me that it was
a blind date with Liu Yun?

606
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,400
When you asked me to meet her,

607
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,240
I thought that she was
a potential investor.

608
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,480
You have a bad temper.

609
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,400
And you always vent your anger on me.

610
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,520
Is that my only purpose as your son?

611
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,560
Why is my studio so offensive to you?

612
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,880
I'm working with my body

613
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,360
and my mind.

614
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,960
You think that only what you do
is real business.

615
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,800
While those of us who are engaged
in technology, development and research

616
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,080
are just fooling around.

617
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,600
You don't know anything.
You don't ask me anything.

618
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,760
And you keep doubting me.
What rights do you have to do that?

619
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,200
What rights do I have?

620
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,520
What do you think?

621
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,880
I'm the one who invested in your studio.

622
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,760
Do you know

623
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,760
how much money you've spent
after coming back from abroad?

624
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,720
You keep talking about your dream.

625
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,240
But what have you achieved?

626
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,960
You say that your team is excellent.

627
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,680
I believe that.

628
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,840
But what have you given them?

629
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,600
You can't even pay them their wages.

630
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,000
End your business at once

631
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,240
before it gets worse.

632
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,200
Impossible!

633
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,200
You need investors
when you want to start a business.

634
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,480
Did your company start making money
the first day you opened it?

635
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,040
It takes time to start making profits.

636
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,040
You know that better than me.

637
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,720
Besides,

638
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,880
who is the one who asked me
to study Computer Science?

639
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,800
You told me

640
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,080
that you were getting old

641
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,960
and couldn't keep up with the trends
of the young people.

642
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,600
You talked about those
who could earn money

643
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,280
by sitting in front of the computer.

644
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,600
You asked me to study
Computer Science well.

645
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,160
Are you regretting it now?

646
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,800
I don't want to argue about it anymore.

647
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,080
Give me the wages first.

648
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,280
I won't ask you
for money again after this.

649
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,400
I'll look for my own investors, okay?

650
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,280
Stop.

651
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,800
You should settle the issue
that you are facing now.

652
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,360
We can talk again when you've done it.

653
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,040
Come in.

654
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,240
Have you forgiven me?

655
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,240
Fine. You've not forgiven me yet.

656
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,920
Qiao Bin.

657
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,480
We got married not long after we met.

658
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,800
Do you know what I like about you?

659
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,000
Actually,
I don't want anything from you.

660
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,080
I like that you treat me well

661
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,880
and that you are honest.

662
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,360
You are honest with me about everything.

663
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,200
But you lied to me on this issue

664
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,600
that is against my principles.

665
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,440
You've broken my trust in you.

666
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,240
How can we be together after this?

667
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,320
I promise that I'll treat you
even better after this.

668
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,440
I won't lie to you ever again.

669
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,160
Besides,

670
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,280
I'll buy a house sooner or later.

671
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,400
It's just a house.

672
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,960
Qiao Bin, why don't you understand?

673
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,040
It's not about the house.

674
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,280
You lied to me!

675
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,040
I...

676
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,480
Qiao Bin.

677
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,560
I've thought it through.

678
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,560
We are not meant for each other.

679
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,440
Let's end it here.

680
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,600
Let's file a divorce.

681
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,640
I'll see you at the Civil Affairs Bureau
in three days.

682
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,160
I failed her.

683
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,400
I was wrong.

684
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,680
I shouldn't have lied to her.

685
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,080
I thought

686
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,920
that you were just fooling around.

687
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,360
I never thought
that you would marry her.

688
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,880
And now, you are going to get a divorce

689
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,480
before the ink is dry.

690
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,880
I didn't expect it too.

691
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,440
Usually, she'd just hit me
when she was angry.

692
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,200
I didn't expect her
to file a divorce with me.

693
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,720
She even hit you?

694
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,360
Does she think she's Princess Iron Fan?

695
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,240
Why do the women now
have such an ill temper?

696
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,560
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

697
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,880
I'll help you change her mind

698
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,480
with my glib tongue.

699
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,800
Okay? Cheers.

700
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,880
Don't be so depressed.

701
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,200
I'll leave it to you, then.

702
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,440
It's done.

703
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,880
Thank you.

704
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,160
Otherwise, the proposal
that I spent the whole night doing

705
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,400
would be gone.

706
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,040
It's so noisy here.

707
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,320
Are you sure you can work here?

708
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,080
Our company is doing
our team building here today.

709
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,880
I don't have anywhere else to work at.

710
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,840
Actually,
I've booked a private room here today.

711
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,480
But I'm leaving because I'm in a rush.

712
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,720
How about you use that room?

713
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,760
This is my name card.

714
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,600
I am Song Hangyu.

715
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,600
I think I know that woman.

716
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,440
Are you finally going
to get into a relationship?

717
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,720
What nonsense are you talking about?

718
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,000
Xia Yuan?

719
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,680
Mr. Tang.

720
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,880
Why didn't you invite us to drink along?

721
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,640
No.

722
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,680
I was here to take care of something.

723
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,520
Xia Yuan.

724
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,080
Actually, I've always liked you.

725
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,080
Mr. Tang.

726
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:05,680
I really...

727
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:09,280
Mr. Tang, you are drunk.

728
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,960
What are you doing?

729
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,920
Why do you refuse to let her go?

730
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,720
Well...

731
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,960
He is...

732
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,800
Me?

733
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,960
I'm her boyfriend.

734
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,440
Mr. Tang.

735
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,320
Xia Yuan.

736
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,320
Anna.

737
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,520
Well...

738
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,280
Mr. Tang is drunk.

739
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,960
Mister.

740
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,520
Thanks a lot.

741
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,640
You are welcome.

742
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,080
Your phone...

743
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,800
I can't simply be kind toward others.

744
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,840
She's a bad judge of character.

745
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,520
(Hangyu.)

746
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,800
(I'll find you.)

747
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,440
(I still have my parents)

748
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,800
(and my job.)

750
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,080
(Move forward.)

751
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,640
Is she not awake yet?

752
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,040
She slept very late last night.

753
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,240
Let her sleep for a while longer.

754
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,240
Okay.

755
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,120
Dad, Mum, I'm going to head out now.

756
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,920
Eat some breakfast first.

757
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,600
I can't. I'm going to be late.

758
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,000
Yuan.

759
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,560
Well.

760
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,920
You came back so late last night.

761
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,480
Where did you go?

762
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,840
Enough.

763
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,440
Don't ask.

764
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,240
I'm doing okay.

765
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,640
Don't worry.

766
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,720
I'll get going now.

767
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,920
Look. Have you heard?

768
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,240
Yes.

769
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,440
That was yesterday.

770
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,560
Something so serious had happened.
Why is she here today?

771
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,480
- Good day, Ms. Xia.
- Good day, Ms. Xia.

772
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,200
Good day, Ms. Xia.

773
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,680
Xia Yuan.

774
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,040
Don't just drink double espresso.

775
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,560
Try something new.

776
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,320
How is everything?

777
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,280
Don't be so anxious.

778
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,280
I think

779
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,280
he won't just disappear like this.

780
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,160
Moreover, even if he's gone,

781
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,560
you still have Mr. Tang.

782
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,800
Anna, stop joking around.

783
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,960
Who was that man from yesterday?

784
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,160
- I don't know him.
- It was just a misunderstanding.

785
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,520
I thought as much.

786
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,640
Don't take it to heart.

787
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,680
There are many people in the company.

788
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,000
They like gossiping.

789
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,920
They'll forget about it soon.

790
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,360
Yuan.

791
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,160
I think you need to rest
for a few more days.

792
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,040
I can help you

793
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,600
handle your work at the company.

794
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,880
I haven't been doing great recently.

795
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,720
But I can't let it affect my work.

796
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,360
I have to report to Mr. Li today.

797
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,960
And I have to write
a proposal this afternoon.

798

You are always on call around the clock.

799
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,320
You should give yourself a break.

If you need anything, just tell me.

801
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,760
I'll help you.

802
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,200
Don't be too distressed.

803
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,920
Time will give us an answer.

804
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,360
Thank you, Anna.

805
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,440
I'll go back to work now.

806
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,760
Call me if you need anything.

00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,400
Any comments?

812
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,520
Mr. Li, what do you think?

813
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,960
I think this proposal

814
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,480
is okay.

815
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,200
But I think there's something wrong
with the data analysis.

816
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,360
But this proposal

817
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,880
is only targeting those who want

818
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,280
[Financial Freedom, High Income,]
to enjoy a trip after they've reached

819

[For the Purpose of Travel]
financial freedom.

820
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,760
But based on what I know,

821
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,200
our target clients are those

822
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,040
who want to have a healing trip.

823
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,760
Ms. Xia.

824
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,880
I believe that there are

825
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,040
women like that too around you.

826
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,800
Those who are fired,

827
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,120
got dumped by their boyfriends

828
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,040
and those who are abandoned
by their husbands.

829
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,960
Either career or love,

830
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,480
there'll be something
that's not going well for them.

831
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,080
But this type of woman

832
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,480
always disguises herself

833
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,280
as a victim.

834
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,680
She'll put the blame on others.

835
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,680
But she'll never reflect on herself.

836
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,520
They

837
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,920
just want to listen
to what they want to hear.

838
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,400
They can't handle the truth.

839
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,640
Especially those so-called career women.

840
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,720
They always babble about equality.

841
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,120
They think that women
can do all the things that men can.

842
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,320
But in the end,

843
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,640
they'll fail in both
their love and career.

844
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,640
Mr. Li.

845
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,560
I think that's too unilateral.

846
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,160
If you think

847
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,680
that our data analysis
is not comprehensive enough,

848
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,240
we can fix that at any time.

while trying to earn money

854
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,920
from them

855
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,320
with this superior and egoistical stance

856
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,600
is very disrespectful.

857
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,320
No work ethic at all.

858
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,200
I was just being hypothetical.

859
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,920
I'm not talking about you.

860
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,120
Besides, you need to remember

861
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,440
that I am your client.

862
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,400
Everything has to be done
according to what I want.

863
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,360
I don't like your attitude just now.

864
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,160
I hope that Mr. Tang

865
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,320
can give me a reasonable explanation
for what you did.

866
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,560
Let's go.

and customized services for our clients.

If you want to attract
a certain type of customer,

for our proposal...

870
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,640
What happened?

871
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,680
I already asked them
not to spread it around.

872
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,240
But someone secretly filmed it.

873
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,600
Mr. Tang, don't blame Xia Yuan.

874
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,520
She was stood up by her fiance.

875
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,520
She must be feeling stressed.

876
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,440
I just came out of her office.

877
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,240
She was not doing well.

878
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,240
I'm worried that it'll affect
her work after this.

879
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,480
Stood up?

880
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,400
Why didn't I know about it?

881
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,160
You didn't know?

882
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,880
That's not a surprise.

883
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,880
She won't allow me to tell anyone.

884
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,480
Just pretend that you don't know.

885
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,920
Besides, who was that man

886
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,960
from yesterday?

887
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,000
Although that's her private life,

888
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,280
if rumors spread out about it,

889
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,040
it'll affect our company's reputation.

890
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,680
Our company is working
on many projects lately.

891
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,760
Maybe you can arrange for someone else
to take over the projects.

892
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:36,280
Xia Yuan has always been
our top-performing employee.

893
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,080
I believe that she can
pull herself together.

894
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,680
I was drunk yesterday.

895
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,040
I already apologized to her.

896
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,560
You can go back to work first.

897
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,400
Okay.

898
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,400
How did it end like this

899
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,280
between the two of them?

900
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,280
What were they doing?

901
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,760
Mr. Song, Mrs. Song.

902
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,160
You are here, Yuan.

903
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,880
How dare you come here.

904
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,200
Everyone in this community

905
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,440
is saying that we are bullying you.

906
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,640
Why did you spread a rumor like that?

907
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,520
I didn't do that, Mrs. Song.

908
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,040
Xia Yuan, don't try

909
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,440
to ruin my son's reputation.

910
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,520
I know

911
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,720
that our son sold the house.

912
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,640
So, you are upset because
you don't get anything out of it.

913
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,720
Let me tell you.

914
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,360
You won't get anything out of it.

915
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,520
I know a lot of lawyers.

916
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,960
If you continue to do this,

917
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,320
you'll receive our lawyer's letter.

918
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:34,760
Let's go.

919
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,800
Mrs. Song, this is for you.

920
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,880
I don't want it.

921
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,720
Yuan, well...

922
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,080
Let's go home!

923
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:44,920
Okay.

924
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,800
Please wait for a moment.

925
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:59,840
Two cups of latte.

926
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,680
Okay.

927
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,880
Yuan.

928
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,000
Yuan.

929
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,480
Why are you here, Mr. Song?

930
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,200
Mrs. Song

931
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,760
is always like that.

932
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,560
Don't take it to heart.

933
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,040
It's okay, Mr. Song.

934
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,760
Well.

935
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,080
Yuan, take a seat.

936
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,080
I want to talk to you.

937
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,080
Okay.

938
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,760
We can sit over there.

939
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,000
Mr. Song, take a seat.

940
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,360
After you.

941
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,520
Well.

942
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:48,960
Yuan.

943
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,240
You are a good girl.

944
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:55,520
It's unfortunate that we can't

945
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,280
be a family.

946
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,040
Our family

947
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,680
is at fault.

948
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,960
Let me apologise to you.

949
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,440
Mr. Song.

950
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,400
I'm sorry.

951
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,920
This is not your fault. It's mine.

952
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,120
No.

953
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,120
By the way, Mr. Song,

954
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,560
I'm here this time

955
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,240
to give this to you.

956
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,840
If there's a chance,

957
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,080
help me pass it to Hangyu.

958
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,200
Two, three, four,

959
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,800
five, six.

(I just want to find him.)

967
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,760
And we don't have any mutual friends.

968
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,600
Can you please give me

his friends' contact numbers?

970
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,040
I'll contact them one by one.

971
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,320
I'll be able to find him, Mrs. Song.

972
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,800
You are his girlfriend.

973
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,360
But you don't even know

974
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,840
his friends.

What are you thinking?

976
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,720
Luckily, our son left.

977
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,720
If he was with her,

978
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:16,480
he would fall sick because of her.

979
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,080
Well...

980
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,200
Mrs. Song.

981
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,840
You said that Hangyu left.

982
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,120
Where did he go?

983
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,200
I don't know.

984
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,160
Mrs. Song, Mr. Song.

985
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:25,720
Let's go home.

986
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,040
Let's go.

987
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,680
Hello, Ms. Xia. It's like this.

988
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,160
We received a parcel for Mr. Song.

989
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,840
But I couldn't get in contact with him.

990
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,840
So, I could only call you.
