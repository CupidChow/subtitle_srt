Wait.

26
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,080
When I was three,

27
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,640
I asked you a question.

28
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,720
I asked if Santa Claus was real.

29
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,480
You said yes.

30
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,240

After Mom passed away,

Santa Claus stopped visiting me.

that you sacrificed
a lot for this family.

59
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,240

No.

61

No?

62
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,840
Penny?

63
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,560
Mr. Wei,

64
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,680

65
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,760

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,280
What?

67
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,800
His nose became very long.

68
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,640
Come in.

69
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,400
What are you looking at?

70
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,200

71
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,520
It's not bad, isn't it?

72
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,320
It's just all right.

73
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,240
Were you hoping to get

74
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,960
the present I prepared?

75
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,760
Not at all.

76
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,400
But it's obvious that you drew me.

77
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,960
It'd be awkward if someone else took it.

78
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,040
Awkward? How come?

79
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,680
It looks like Ye Siqi too.

80
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,480
No.

81
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,640

Look.

that Venus

96
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,880
would give me guidance

97
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,600
and courage.

98
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,320
And now,

99
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,760
I have found

100
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,080
my Venus.

101
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,280
Not bad.

102
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,000

103
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,120
Mr. Xu,

104
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,640
Hui has potential.

105
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,520
He could become a Michelin chef.

106
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,400
Quan, Scar, Biao,

107
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,120
take a seat.

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,680
Yes.

- Come.

112
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,680
Right?

113
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,720
Okay.

114
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,520

115
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,800
Thank you.

116
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,240
Dad,

117
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,520
remember to cut down on sugar.

118
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,880
All right.

119
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,480
Cut down on sugar.

120
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,280

121
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,880

Do you want mine?

123
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,640
I love fried eggs.

124
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,120

125
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,280
I mean,

126
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,400
look at the egg.

127
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,600
It's perfectly cooked.

128
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,840

129
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,600

The mashed potato is delicious.

131
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,200
The milk is delicious.

132
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,320
And the chef is very skillful.

133
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,880
Right, Mr. Xu?

135
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,680
What are you planning to do now?

136
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,680
Don't get me wrong.

137
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,720
I'll support you

138
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,280
whatever you do,

139
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,520
as long as you're happy.

140
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,680
Dad.

141
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,040
I want to close down my restaurant.

142
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,120

authentic Chinese cuisine,

144
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,760
I'll reopen it.

145
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,880

Other than what you said earlier,

161
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,520
do you have any other plans?

162
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,680
Such as?

163
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,720
Stay

164
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,200
and run this winery.

165
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,720
Why?

166
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,200
One,

167
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,840
you already see

168
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,120
your father's condition.

169
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,440
This winery needs

170
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,520
a successor.

171
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,840
And it is the brainchild

172
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,920
of your late mom too.

173
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,000
Two,

174
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,200
we're trying very hard

175
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,920
to rebrand ourselves here.

176
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,280
You grew up here

177
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,280
so perhaps, you can give us
some ideas on marketing.

178
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,240
Three,

179
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,120
I believe that our wines

180
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,440
shouldn't only be sold to Europeans,

181
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,640
but also to China.

182
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,920
We need a good leader.

183
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,200
Yuan.

184
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,240
I have the same idea too,

185
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,600
but I want

186
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,280
to distill my business proposal

187
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,840
before I bring it up to Dad.

188
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,480
Okay.

189
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,400
Oh, Hui,

190
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,800
if you have the time,

191
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,240
keep

192
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,000
your dad company.

193
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,400
Let's go back.

194
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,440
Mischief Man.

195
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,200
You two are here.

196
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,160
I see.

197
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,240
What are you reading?

198
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,000
History Can Be Deceptive.

199
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,360
It's a good read.

200
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,280
How was

201
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,040
the Christmas party yesterday?

202
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,360
It's perfect.

203
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,440
It's the best Christmas

204
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,640
I have ever had.

205
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,240
You two were there with me.

206
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,360
Hui is back too.

207
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,000
I'm very happy.

208
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,120
Thank you so much.

209
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,840
Mr. Xu.

210
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,920
We have

211
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,480
another surprise for you.

212
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,480
Another surprise?

213
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,840
What is it?

214
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,320
Be my guest.

215
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,600
I...

216
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,200
I have no idea.

217
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,640
Sit.

218
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,440
What a good boy.

219
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,440
Hello there.

220
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,960
You're adorable.

221
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,600
Look. It's smiling.

222
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,440
Xia Yuan and I prepared

223
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,320
this other present for you.

224
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,520
Thank you.

225
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,240
It's so cute.

226
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,760
What is its name?

227
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,480
It doesn't have one. Give it a name.

228
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,800
I...

229
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,160
I'll name it...

230
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,440
I'll...

231
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:58,760
I'll name it

232
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,960
Sakura.

233
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,840
Okay.

234
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,160
- Sakura.
- Sakura.

235
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:02,760
Come.

236
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,560
- Sakura.
- Hand.

237
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,560
Give me your hand.

238
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,240
It knows how to shake hands.

239
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,320
Hi.

240
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,200
Hello.

241
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,400
I just recalled

242
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,360
that you don't like sugar in your latte.

243
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,600
How is your work here?

244
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,760
All is good.

245
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,840
I was surprised to see you in the party.

246
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,480
You lied to me last night,

247
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,160
didn't you?

248
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,000
You met her a long time ago.

249
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,280
Penny.

250
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,560
Penny.

251
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:04,830
[Penny's Picture]

252
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,720
She is beautiful.

253
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:38,600
Penny's romantic past revealed!

254
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,320
Is that her ex-boyfriend?

255
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,440
And you told me you didn't know her.

256
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,920
You two met a long time ago!

257
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,960
Liar!

258
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,480
Someone's missing you.

259
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,720
That's not funny.

260
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,720
I just arrived here and I already

261
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,960
heard that you have a nickname,

262
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,000
Workout Fanatic.

263
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,440
So you know.

264
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,080
It's just a kind of lifestyle.

265
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,640
I have told you many times

266
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,480
to get out of your comfort zone.

267
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,560
Come out and look

268
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,080
at the world outside.

269
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,400
You'll notice...

270
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,760
That

271
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,840
being alone is the best.

272
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,800
It's been so many years

273
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,800
and you're as stubborn as always.

274
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,360
But I do think that the girl

275
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,120
could change you.

276
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,800
It seems like I need
to be more authoritative then.

277
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,640
That's not what I mean.

278
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,600
It's not about work.

279
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,920
You

280
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,080
are not getting any younger.

281
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,600
If you find someone you like,

282
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,000
grab her and cherish her.

283
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,880
This isn't funny.

284
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,640
I'm serious.

285
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,360
You two share

286
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,480
a special

287
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,760
chemistry.

288
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,840
It's not special.

289
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,240
It's unusual.

290
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,560
She and I are from different worlds.

291
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,680
We can never be together.

292
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,160
We were in different worlds too

293
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,960
and we dated for many years.

294
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,800
And we broke up in the end.

295
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,400
Oh.

296
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,920
I

297
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,040
found several amazing spots.

298
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,800
You can shoot

299
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,040
your music video in these locations.

300
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,920
I already found the main location.

301
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,880
But I'm still looking for
something more special.

302
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,680
Sorry.

303
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,040
[Ye Siqi]
Liar. You're a big fat liar.

304
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,440
Big fat liar!

305
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,720
She's a kid.

306
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,480
You seem to be enjoying it.

307
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,600
What a scrumptious meal.

308
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,680
Did you screw up somewhere else?

309
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,760
No.

310
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,840
This is my job.

311
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,960
Bon appétit.

312
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,520
Okay.

313
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,920
Why are there salts in the salad?

314
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,720
Have some soup.

315
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,800
How many chili peppers
did you put in there?

316
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,760
This is what you get

317
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,480
for lying.

318
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Mr. Xu.

319
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,600
Why are you sitting here?

320
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,760
Get up.

321
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,200
Hush.

322
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,720
Don't wake Hui.

323
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,000
Hui loves

324
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,840
to fall asleep next to me.

325
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,080
Okay?

326
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,800
But he's an adult now.

327
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,400
We need to teach him independence.

328
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,160
Let me stay here for a while.

329
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,160
Just for a while.

330
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,080
Go to bed now.

331
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:35,800
No, Mr. Xu.

332
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,600
It's cold out here.

333
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,440
- Get up.
- No.

334
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,120
- I don't care.
- Get up.

335
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,560
I'll stay here.

336
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,680
You...

337
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,440
Let go of me.

338
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,640
Look!

339
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,680
Why are you sitting here, Dad?

340
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,560
Hui, did I wake you?

341
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,640
No.

342
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,840
Go back to your bed.

343
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,200
I'll leave now.

344
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,440
Tomorrow morning,

345
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,280
I'll drive you to school, okay?

346
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,600
Sure, Dad.

347
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,440
Let's sleep together tonight.

348
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,240
Let's go to your room, okay?

349
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:04,800
Come, Quan.

350
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,880
Come.

351
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,000
Mr. Xu, come.

352
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,640
Good boy.

353
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,040
Thanks a lot, Quan.

354
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,000
Come.

355
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,080
Are you tired?

356
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,200
I'm all right.

357
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,320
Sit down, Dad.

358
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,520
I can do this.

359
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,920
Let me help you, Dad.

360
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,360
Thanks, Hui.

361
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,520
I'll take off the glasses for you.

362
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,880
Right.

363
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,120
Sleep now.

364
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,640
All right.

365
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,200
It's been two days.

366
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,920
Show me

367
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,120
your ideas.

368
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,520
I'll go first.

369
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,080
I'll go first.

370
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,320
Okay.

371
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,920
I believe the winery

372
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,920
should present an image

373
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,400
of a vast prairie.

374
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,280
It's grand,

375
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,400
and it's like the song you like.

376
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,000
♪The blue sky♪

377
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,160
♪The green field♪

378
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,520
Quan.

379
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,720
A prairie?

380
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,320
When we see a prairie,

381
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,800
we think of dairy cows.

382
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,960
It has nothing to do with red wines.

383
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,920
We can plant some grapes...

384
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,560
This is too huge.

385
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,320
We print it

386
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,800
on our logo.

387
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,800
What even is this?

388
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,400
Let me show you mine.

389
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,880
What do you think?
It's poignant, isn't it?

390
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,720
It represents our ambition.

391
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,880
If we can print this

392
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,320
on our logo,

393
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,440
our business
will grow like bamboo shoots.

394
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,600
Scar, you can draw an axe

395
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,680
and a bamboo.

396
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,120
Just don't smash our bottles like this.

397
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,040
Listen.

398
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,720
This is just a symbolism.

399
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,840
All right.

400
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,520
I take back
the "two heads are better than one"

401
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,440
comment that I made just now.

402
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,280
Xia Yuan, it's your turn.

403
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,160
I count on you.

404
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,480
Yes.

405
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,320
Mr. Xu.

406
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,160
This is the design I came up with.

407
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,320
It's just a grapevine.

408
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,840
We make wine from grapes,

409
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,960
and you drew grapes...?

410
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,000
Let her explain.

411
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,240
I drew this because I want

412
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,560
to evoke the scenery
of a century-old grapevine

413
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,120
hanging low with heavy fruits.

414
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,120
Our winery

415
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,360
has the oldest grapevine

416
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,560
in the world.

417
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,000
We should use it to our advantage

418
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,080
and show our clients our legacy.

419
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,040
Let me see.

420
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,760
I must say

421
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,320
Xia's idea is very promising.

422
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,480
If you're

423
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,280
incorporating our winery

424
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,160
into the packaging,

425
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,320
why don't

426
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,840
we add

427
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,280
the address of our vineyard

428
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,720
on the logo too?

429
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,080
After all, we are

430
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,680
one of the most famous

431
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,600
vineyards in the world.

432
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,600
What does "s" here mean?

433
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,040
There are a lot

434
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,440
of similar wine products on the market.

435
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,160
Consumers

436
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,840
are often overwhelmed by choices.

437
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,800
And a lengthy name

438
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,000
doesn't help with retention.

439
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,120
I think

440
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,040
we can simply name

441
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,680
our new products as Series S.

442
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,400
It's easy to retain, and it stands out.

443
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,880
Look.

444
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,760
This...

445
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,480
Xia thought everything through.

446
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,560
People my age

447
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,680
can never retain
the name of a wine bottle

448
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,320
if it's too long.

449
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,840
This solves the issue

450
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,760
and increases our visibility.

451
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,240
What do you think?

452
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,680
Mr. Xu,

453
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,320
I like the logo design.

454
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,080
But

455
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,360
what about the bottle design?

456
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,360
For the bottle,

457
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,600
I agree
with what everyone said just now,

458
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,040
which is to simplify the design.

459
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,280
Less is more.

460
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,200
The bottle should stick

461
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,560
with one base color.

462
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,800
As for the logo,

463
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,200
we should make it gold

464
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,560
so that it looks like the grapes
are bathing under the sunlight.

465
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,920
If that's the sentiment
you want to evoke,

466
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,160
we can make our main logo bronze.

467
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,440
Sure.

468
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,040
- I like that.
- Yeah.

469
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,720
I'll handle the packaging then.

470
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,520
Once I make the amendment,

471
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,600
I'll release it as soon as possible.

472
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,160
Yes. Thank you.

473
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,880
Xia,

474
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,360
I'm not an expert when it comes

475
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,160
to designing.

476
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,880
I won't be able to help you

477
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,080
but if you ever need me

478
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,280
to do anything,

479
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,480
just let me know, okay?

480
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,840
But I still like my design better.

481
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,480
You're trying to axe our wine bottle.

482
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,120
Axe our wine bottle.

483
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,680
Xia Yuan, you know me.

484
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,640
I hate it when people lie to me.

485
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,560
Siqi.

486
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,480
You are being too childish here.

487
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,120
Wei Xuesong is your boss,

488
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,560
not your boyfriend.

489
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,320
You're hired

490
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,400
to do your job.

491
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,680
He has the right to share

492
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,240
or withhold any information

493
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,720
from you.

494
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,040
You can only demand him
to be open and honest

495
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,960
when he's

496
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,720
a good friend of yours.

497
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,800
Yes, I know.

498
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,560
Stop scolding me.

499
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,280
It's just that he

500
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,400
could have told me the truth.

501
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,280
Oh, Xia Yuan.

502
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:46,960
Hao Weilai

503
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,680
left without saying anything today.

504
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,360
It

505
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,160
doesn't bother you at all?

506
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,080
He's doing what he needs to do.

507
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,880
Why would I be mad?

508
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,280
But he's not by your side now.

509
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,120
And that concerns you.

510
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,040
Xia Yuan,

511
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,480
I know I used

512
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,360
to hate Hao Weilai.

513
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,280
But

514
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,040
after all that has happened,

515
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,320
he has

516
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,440
become more mature.

517
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,320
I also see

518
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,360
how sincere his feelings are.

519
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,640
Xia Yuan.

520
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,480
Are you not moved

521
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,680
by him at all?

522
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,760
Just get together already.

523
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,280
Or I'm giving up on you two.

524
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,560
We'll cross the bridge when we're there.

525
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,000
Either you

526
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,920
are in denial

527
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,080
or you

528
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,960
have not moved on from Song Hangyu.

529
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,680
The countdown is over.

530
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,480
Looking back,

531
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,160
I just want to laugh

532
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,160
at my own stubbornness.

533
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,720
I came here to look
for someone who dumped me.

534
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,600
Wounds

535
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,800
do heal

536
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,080
with time.

537
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,440
Well, I'm glad to hear this

538
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,760
from you.

539
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,320
I want you

540
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,240
to erase that jerk from your memory.

541
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,560
I heard there's a gelato store in front.

542
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,480
Let's get some.

543
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,640
Sure. It's on you.

544
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,640
Let's go.

545
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,840
Penny, how do you like Europe so far?

546
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,880
Do you enjoy it here?

547
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,120
It's decent.

548
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,440
Anyway, shouldn't you tell me

549
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,720
how

550
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,320
you met Yuan?

551
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,280
She's quite sweet.

552
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,960
Tell me now.

553
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,160
Penny, I didn't bring you here

554
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,160
to talk about this.

555
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,120
I need a favor from you.

556
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:33,960
Go ahead.

557
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,560
We're trying

558
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,560
to promote the winery.

559
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,800
Can you help us?

560
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,280
Weilai.

561
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,040
Is the winery that important to you?

562
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,320
Mischief Man

563
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,880
saved us.

564
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,120
His winery

565
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,440
needs us now

566
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,720
so I want to help.

567
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,960
My little brother is asking me for help.

568
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,320
Who am I to turn him down?

569
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,120
It's time for you

570
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,520
to tell me

571
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,480
your relationship with Yuan.

572
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,640
My business here is done. Bye.

573
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,560
Brand ambassador?

574
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,720
Yes.

575
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,880
Hao Weilai.

576
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,360
Isn't she shooting

577
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,880
her music video nearby?

578
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,880
Yes.

579
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,200
I have an idea

580
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,640
that's worth trying.

[Champion, Secondary Color]

582
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,200
As long as you love sports

583
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,560
and life,

584
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,720
you're a Champion.

585
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,400
Thank you.

586
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,480
You may return to your seat.

587
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,200
All candidates

588
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,320
have given

589
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,720
their presentations.

590
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,520
The judges are deliberating

591
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,440
and tallying the competition scores.

592
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,560
I ask

593
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,840
for your patience.

594
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,520
Stop shaking it.

595
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,920
Did I shake it?

596
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,640
Bin.

597
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,400
I'm getting nervous.

598
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,440
Relax.

599
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,240
Why am I so nervous?

[10th Twinkle Cup App Design Contest,
Grand Prize]

601
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,040
Penny agreed to be

602
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,000
our brand ambassador for free.

603
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,600
But

604
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,200
she wants to know if we

605
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,000
can get the distribution right in China.

606
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,480
My concern

607
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,760
is that we have close to zero

608
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,000
market share in China.

609
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,200
I think this is worth a try.

610
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,640
What do you think?

611
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,560
Distribution right in China, huh?

612
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,520
Does that mean

613
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,600
we can sell

614
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,880
our wines to the Chinese market soon?

615
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,000
The wine industry in China

616
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,360
is quite mature.

617
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,440
Traditional French or Italian wineries

00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,240
or other new European wineries

619
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,440
have already ventured
into the Chinese market.

620
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,760
Yes.

621
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,560
Knowing the quality of our wine

622
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,320
and the eye-catching new design,

623
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,280
if Penny

624
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,920
can promote it in China,

625
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,040
we will be able to establish

626
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,720
ourselves quickly over there.

627
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,520
Besides,

628
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,920
if Penny gets the distribution right,

629
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,360
she'll be incentivized
to promote our brand better.

630
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,400
I like this idea too, Dad.

631
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,200

Working with her

635
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,400

00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,560
Once Penny

637
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,800
becomes our ambassador,

638
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,560
it will

639
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,360
stimulate our sales greatly too.

756
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,040

I... I...

758
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,520
We strive to do better in the future.

759

Our real captain

768
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,320
is abroad right now.

769
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,000
He's working very hard
to gather our startup capital.

770
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,200
And what do we want
to say to Hao Weilai?

771
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,000
Come.

772
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
We'll shine brighter in the future!

773
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,600
All the best.

774
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,800
I should send this to my dad.

775
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:20,080
The application I made won.

776
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,320
Hao,

777
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,640
I am aware

778
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,160
of your factory's situation.

779
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,400
You only have a few workers left.

780
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,240
They won't be able to meet my demands.

781
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:29,920
Mr. Liu.

782
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,960
We upscale our manpower

783
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,200
according to the project volume.

784
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,360
The deliverables will be punctual

785
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,600
and of good quality.

786
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,000
Trust me.

787
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,640
I heard

788
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,160
that many brands

789
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,960
stopped working with you
after what happened last time.

790
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,160
If I work

791
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,720
with you now,

792
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,920
it might affect my brand too.

793
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,800
Maybe we can work together

794
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,240
once you handle your situation.

795
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,280
Mr. Liu,

796
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,640
I can offer you
a more competitive price.

797
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,120
I really want
to make it work between us.

798
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:54,880
I...

799
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,200
I have a meeting.

800
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,240
Wait.

801
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,520
Do I look good?

802
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,160
How long do we have to wait?

803
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,200
They are here.

804
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,560
Yeah.

805
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,600
Hello.

806
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,240
Hi, Penny.

807
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:47,240
Welcome.

808
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,200
My dad is unwell

809
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,600
so I came to receive you on his behalf.

810
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,080
Is Mr. Xu all right?

811
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,520
I wish him a speedy recovery.

812
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,320
Thank you.

813
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,440
Let's go inside.

814
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,320
Okay.

815
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,380
[Signature of Client: Penny]

816
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:14,770
[Signature of Agency Representative:
Alex Xu]

817
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,560
- To a successful partnership.
- To a successful partnership.

818
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,840
I'll have my lawyer and my agent

819
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,880
to follow up on the rest.

820
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,360
We'll assemble a team of professionals

821
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,960
to oversee the sales in China.

822
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,640
I'll ask them to send you

823
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,840
the proposal as soon as possible.

824
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,440
If you need me for your work

825
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,760
or to relay information,

826
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,520
let me know.

827
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,320
Weilai

828
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,160
will give you my contact details.

829
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,520
I'm very much

830
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,880
aligned with what Xia Yuan is thinking.

831
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,240
February 14th is the perfect occasion

832
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,280
to launch new red wines.

833
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,840
Flowers to lock hearts,

834
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,360
red wines to seal lips.

835
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:01,480
Love stories and classy wines
are a match made in heaven.

836
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,240
I believe

837
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,480
Valentine's Day will allow

838
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,040
our brand to reach greater heights.

839
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,400
Bravo.

840
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,920
Well said.

841
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:20,880
Come.

842
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,080
What snacks do I spy here?

843
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,960
Here.

844
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,880
Thank you

845
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,560
for helping me

846
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,640
and Mr. Xu.

847
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,960
I know you did this for me.

848
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,600
Don't flatter yourself now.

849
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,000
You brought me to this winery, yes.

850
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,120
But I also personally think

851
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,720
that this place is worth the investment.

852
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,400
Okay.

853
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,080
You're never wrong anyway.

854
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,840
What's the matter?

855
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,400
Good. Good.

856
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,600
Feeling better?

857
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,920
Anywhere else?

858
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,000
Are you sure you're my little brother?

859
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,480
Why?

860
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,840
You need a favor from me, don't you?

861
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,520
You want to borrow money?

862
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,080
No.

863
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,480
Be gentle!

864
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,560
Can't I massage you out of good faith?

865
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,080
Geez.

866
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,440
But if you want to give me money,
it's fine by me too.

867
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,120
There you go.

868
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,040
I am now who I was anymore.

869
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,240
When Dad left me here,

870
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,320
I told myself

871
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,800
that I would purchase

872
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,800
a plane ticket and sneak out
after a few days

873
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,120
just to spite him.

874
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,480
But as I live here,

875
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,200
I slowly get used to it.

876
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,880
I quite like this place.

877
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,400
I can feed myself here too.

878
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,560
Weilai.

879
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,080
You have changed a lot.

880
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,880
I'm so happy for you.

881
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,720
I don't know

882
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,120
what the future holds for me.

883
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,560
But I have confidence in myself.

884
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,280
Do you know?

885
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,480
My company won the prize.

886
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,120
But I don't know

887
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,000
if Dad knows.

888
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
He didn't reply
to the message I sent him.

889
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,800
I think he knows.

890
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,360
Maybe he's too busy.

891
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,160
He forgot to check his phone

892
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,880
or he forgot to reply.

893
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,200
He's still busy?

894
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,920
Don't think too much of it.

895
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,360
Sakura.

896
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,880
Why are you here all alone?

897
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,720
Whose pet is this? It's so cute.

898
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,960
Xia Yuan gave it to Mr. Xu.

899
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,280
Oh.

900
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,240
Mr. Xu is sick.

901
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,840
What kind of sickness?

902
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,960
Alzheimer's.

903
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,600
That's so sudden.

904
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,120
He was fine at the Christmas party.

905
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,640
It caught us by surprise too.

906
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,240
Certain things will always

907
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,720
catch us blindsided.

908
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,880
Right?

909
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,960
Yeah.

910
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,840
So unpredictable.

911
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,800
I pet the dog, and you pet me.

912
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,600
Because you're cute.

913
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,560
Stop it.

914
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,280
Glare at Penny.

915
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,720
Show her your fangs.

916
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,840
