He opened up to me.

75
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,960
I thought
that was the best moment to confess,

At the moment,

100
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,240
I'm imagining that these snacks

00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,160

My mom

117
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,480
once said

118
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,080
that she dreamed of a person
when she was asleep.

119
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,160
The photo of that person

120
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,200
was in the bedroom.

Where's the light?

133
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,520

134
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,480

139
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,640

140
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,040

141
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,640
will you resent me?

142
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,000
No.

143
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,840
Why would I resent you?

144
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,880
Because I'm bad with directions

145
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,800
and I brought you to this secluded spot.

146

150
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,920

Okay, we have people down there.

we won't be able to find her.

192
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,040
Oh.

193

You couldn't reach her friends either?

No.

195
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,760
What exactly happened

196
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,160
between you and your assistant?

197
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,440
She is someone who quits

198
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,440
without prior notice.

199
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,960
My friend,

I want you

201

to find the love of your life.

202
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,800
But

203
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,480
at our age,

204
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,240
falling in love

205
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,480
might be dangerous.

206
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,600
Think it through.

207
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,640
Slow down.

208
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,440
Why?

Eat while you can.

210
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,840
What if it disappears later?

211
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,520
Don't worry.

212

Wait for me.

It's all right.

Let's go.

- Hop on.
- Xia Yuan.

Can we walk together?

236

Okay.

Come.

Don't cross the line.

It's been several days

since I left Mr. Wei.

252
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,280
I didn't even notice it
when I was with him.

253
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,680
But now,

254
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,840
I realized that I don't
want to lose him.

255
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,440
I think about him all the time.

256

257
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,640
Oh, Xia Yuan.

258
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,480
After I left,

259
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,280
Mr. Wei

260
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,200
gave me some money.

261
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,200
I want to return the money to him.

262
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,480
I can't have it.

263
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,160

265
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,080
become more mature now.

266

is much older than you.

271
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,960
He's grounded and reliable
in his approach,

272
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,560
but that also means he has a lot more

273
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,320
to consider.

274
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,800
For you, when two persons

275
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,840
are in love,

276
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,200
they should get together.

277
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,400
But for him, there are other issues.

278
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,680
He will wonder

279
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,640
if he can provide for you,

280
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,800
if he can give you happiness,

281
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,640
or if he can take care of you forever.

282
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,480
He has to think about all these things.

283
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,920
Is that true?

Can you forgive me?

384
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,040
Forget it.

385
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,320
Let me bring you to the hospital.

386
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,120
Wait.

387
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,280
Mr. Wei.

388
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,080
Sorry.

389
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,680
I lied.

390
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,280
I miss you so much.

391
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,440
Mr. Wei.

392
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,920
I lied to you.

393
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,400
Why aren't you mad?

394
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,520
Why would I be mad?

395
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,360
I was at fault.

396
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,840
So you knew.

397
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,080
Tell me then.

398
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,440
What did you do wrong?

399
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,120
After

400
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,640
you left that day,

401
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,560
I have been living in regrets.

402
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,840
I've been reflecting on myself.

403
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,320
You

404
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,280
are younger than me,

405
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,800
yet you are braver than me.

406
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,520
I feel like you have done

407
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,880
a lot of heavy lifting

408
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,080
in our relationship.

409
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,360
Siqi.

410
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,400
I have made up my mind.

411
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,560
From now on,

412
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,600
I'll protect you

413
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,480
and dote on you.

414
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,320
I'll be

415
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,240
your superman.

416
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,400
Can I hold you against your words?

417
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,120
Pinkie promise.

418
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,280
Pinkie promise.

419
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,680
Mr. Wei,

420
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,920
the view over there is amazing.

421
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,960
Let me show you.

422
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,080
- Oh?
- Give me your hand.

423
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,760
- Your hand.
- My hand.

424
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,200
Slow down.

425
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,680
(My necklace!|)

426
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,800
(Yes!)

427
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,240
(You're back.)

428
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,480
(I wonder who returned it to me.)

429
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,160
(Oh, my dear necklace.)

430
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,640
(I'm never losing you again.)

431
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,560
Mr. Wei.

432
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,960
You had told me

433
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,600
about you and Penny.

434
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,240
I too

435
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,440
need to tell you something.

436
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,800
Siqi.

437
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,960
I do not care about your past.

438
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,840
I only care about our future.

439
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,400
I must have had a lot of rough days

440
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,000
because a sight like this
is enough to dazzle me now.

441
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,440
You guys have had a bumpy journey.

442
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,760
Why don't you spend a night here

443
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,920
instead of your trailer?

444
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,200
Get some rest.

445
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,120
You're so thoughtful.

446
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,160
I must politely decline.

447
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,560
We are used
to sleeping in the trailer by now.

448
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,880
Besides,
our belongings are in the trailer.

449
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,000
Yeah.

450
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,240
Xia Yuan, Weilai,

451
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,440
you two

452
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,440
have done

453
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,320
many things

454
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,680
for Siqi and me.

455
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,080
Take this as a thank-you gift from me.

456
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,160
Xia Yuan.

457
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,680
Stay.

458
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,200
Think of this as his gift for me.

459
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,120
Right?

460
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,120
Come.

461
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,840
Let's go.

462
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,640
Enjoy.

463
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,440
Thank you.

464
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,120
Dig in.

465
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,800
Xia Yuan.

466
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,960
I owe you

467
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,480
a heartfelt thank-you.

468
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,680
If you

469
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,120
hadn't come up with this idea,

470
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,440
god knows when

471
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,360
I would be able

472
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,440
to face my true feelings.

473
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,440
It has nothing to do with me.

474
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,000
I merely sped things up.

475
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,920
I knew

476
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,360
you would come.

477
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:14,920
Xia Yuan,

478
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,160
I was anxious when you told me

479
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,320
about this plan.

480
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,960
I'm serious, Mr. Wei.

481
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,400
I was worried

482
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,160
that you wouldn't come.

483
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,560
But I was also worried

484
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,360
that you would be mad at me

485
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,120
once you learned the truth.

486
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,360
It's all my fault.

487
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:36,960
No.

488
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,960
It's my fault.

489
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,600
I was too childish.

490
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,880
Oh, Mr. Wei.

491
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,320
Do you want to join our trailer trip?

492
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,600
I wouldn't want

493
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,160
to impose myself.

494
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,080
You are bothering us.

495
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,680
No, you're welcome to join us.

496
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,000
With you on board,

497
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,560
someone can finally discipline her.

498
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,320
Hao Weilai.

499
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,160
I'm punching you.

500
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,680
See?

501
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,240
Discipline her now.

502
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,040
You're cute.

503
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,040
Xia Yuan.

504
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,840
Where are we going tomorrow?

505
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,160
Tomorrow...

506
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,040
You know what?

507
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,280
I'll arrange my work schedule now.

508
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,800
If you don't mind,

509
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,240
I can arrange for

510
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,320
for the itinerary tomorrow.

511
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,840
Sure.

512
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,120
Mr. Wei.

513
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,440
You're an investor.

514
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,560
Have you thought about
investing in China?

515
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,920
Hao Weilai.

516
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,440
No shameless advertisement here.

517
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,160
We're having a double date.

518
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,000
Don't

519
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,760
bring money into this.

520
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,720
I'm not promoting myself.

521
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,080
I asked if he wanted
to go back to his roots.

522
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,600
Got it?

523
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,320
Mr. Wei.

524
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,440
He's implying
that you forgot about your roots.

525
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,960
Xia Yuan.

526
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,320
We

527
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,960
can finally

528
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,200
sleep on a comfortable bed.

529
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,560
You have no idea

530
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,600
how small and dilapidated the motel

531
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,920
I stayed in was two days ago.

532
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,960
The windows were creaky.

533
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,720
Xia Yuan and you are taking this room.

534
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,080
Mr. Wei.

535
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,360
I like your arrangement.

536
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,080
Keep it up.

537
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,960
Rock, paper, scissors!

538
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,560
Drink up.

539
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,040
I'll drink with you.

540
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,080
Refill!

541
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,840
It's empty.

542
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,400
Wait for me here.

543
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,600
I'll find some wine.

544
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,800
Wait.

545
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,360
Wait for me here.

546
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,680
Wait for me.

547
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,680
Wine... Wine...

548
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,680
Why aren't they back yet?

549
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,000
Hao Weilai.

550
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,840
Go check on them.

551
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,040
Go.

552
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,040
No one answered the door.

553
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,280
I think they are asleep.

554
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,080
Asleep?

555
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,480
Let's go to bed now.

556
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,040
Let's go.

557
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,200
Xia Yuan.

558
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,560
Do you think Siqi and Wei Xuesong

559
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,000
make a good couple?

560
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,040
Yes.

561
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,080
Look.

562
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,080
Siqi and Qiao Bin

563
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,520
are around the same age.

564
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,360
But they are both kids.

565
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,480
They are not mature enough.

566
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,680
So they argued a lot

567
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,200
and no one wanted to make a compromise.

568
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,720
Mr. Wei

569
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,880
is mature and grounded.

570
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,280
He has seen many things,

571
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,800
so he is more understanding

572
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,200
toward Siqi.

573
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,720
They will

574
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,200
be happy together.

575
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,160
You are in a happy relationship too.

576
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,680
A mature and grounded man like me

577
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,200
indulges you all the time.

578
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:21,840
So

579
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,680
where do you want to go next?

580
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,640
I want to visit Mirror Lake.

581
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,640
My friends who came here

582
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,960
said that it was beautiful.

583
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,120
I want to visit it.

584
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,640
Sure. I'll come with you.

585
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,800
What about you?

586
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,000
What do you want to do next?

587
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,920
I want to go back to China.

588
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,520
My visa is expiring soon.

589
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,360
It's time to deliver my promise

590
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,000
to my dad.

591
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,600
Great. I want to go back too.

592
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,320
I have done

593
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,720
what I'm here for,

594
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,640
and I want to visit my parents.

595
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,600
Besides,

596
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,480
I took leave to come to Europe.

597
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,000
It's time to go back to my work.

598
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,520
Okay.

599
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,840
We'll go back together.

600
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,440
You have to meet
your in-laws sooner or later.

601
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,240
And it's time for me
to meet your parents too.

602
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,760
All right, darling.

603
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,600
Time to sleep.

604
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,840
I'm going to bed. Goodnight.

605
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,320
Goodnight.

606
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,040
Ben, did you find your necklace?

607
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,920
Yeah.

608
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,280
Somebody put it in front of my room.

609
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,400
That's odd.

610
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,760
Because the person who gave you back
the necklace must know you.

611
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,360
Otherwise,
somebody knows where you live,

612
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,520
right?

613
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,240
I saw a girl

614
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,280
who looks like Sofia,

615
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,000
but I'm not sure.

616
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,040
Really?

617
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,960
Really.

618
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,080
Jack.

619
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:08,600
Yeah?

620
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,400
I'll go for a walk.

621
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,280
Yeah, okay, no problem. Bye.

622
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,280
Bye.

623
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,000
Mr. Wei.

624
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,520
Where are you bringing us?

625
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,840
It's a secret.

626
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,480
Don't worry.
I have arranged for everything.

627
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,200
Is it too cold for you?

628
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,720
Hop on.

629
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,120
A horse carriage?

630
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:28,880
Yes.

631
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,360
Mr. Wei.

632
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,520
I'm scared.

633
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,400
Relax. I'm with you.

634
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,400
Let's go.

635
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:37,880
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

636
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,960
I'm scared too.

637
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,560
Don't be.

638
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,640
Before the advent of the automobile,

639
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,920
horse carriage was the universal mean
of transportation.

640
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,720
You have visited many places

641
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,840
with your trailer.

642
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,160
Now, I present you a trip
on a horse carriage.

643
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,240
What do you think?

644
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,680
Away from the bustling cities,

645
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,320
let's experience life

646
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,360
on a slower pace.

647
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,680
Mr. Wei, you can become a tour guide

648
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,280
when you quit your job as an investor.

649
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,120
Still afraid now?

650
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,440
No.

651
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,640
You're by my side, so I'm not afraid.

652
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,520
You're by my side, so I'm not afraid.

653
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,320
Hao Weilai!

654
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,040
You should be more afraid
when I'm by your side.

655
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,680
No, I'm not afraid.

656
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,040
Hi.

657
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,800
Look. Two donkeys.

658
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,760
It's beautiful over there.

659
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,840
Where?

660
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,200
Look.

661
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,840
Are you tired? Should we swap?

662
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,800
I'm fine.

663
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,680
Mr. Wei.

664
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,680
Have some water.

665
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,000
Hao Weilai, do you want some?

666
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Thanks.

667
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,560
Here, Weilai.

668
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,280
Thank you.

669
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,640
I like the views here.

670
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,280
We can travel a bit.

671
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,600
The hotels nearby

672
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,680
are fully booked.

673
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,760
We can only sleep on the trailer.

674
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,920
This trailer?

675
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,800
How will it fit

676
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,680
the four of us?

677
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,880
It can.

678
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,680
You two

679
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,840
will share Xia Yuan's and my bed.

680
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,520
Xia Yuan and I will sleep here.

681
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,760
There's a bed here.

682
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,280
Walk around a bit.

683
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,800
Xia Yuan and I will lay the bed.

684
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,840
Go.

685
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,360
Let's go.

686
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,440
Look.

687
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,720
Mr. Wei.

688
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,720
Can I tell you something?

689
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,600
Yeah?

690
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,920
You see,

691
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,840
we have bothered Xia Yuan and Hao Weilai

692
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,280
for long enough.

693
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,480
We shouldn't overstay our welcome.

694
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,120
Hao Weilai planned

695
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,880
this trip for Xia Yuan.

696
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,200
We should let them

697
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,720
have their date.

698
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,760
Besides,

699
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,960
I want to go home.

700
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,400
Okay.

701
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,200
By home,

702
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,000
do you mean China?

703
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,320
No.

704
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,000
I mean

705
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,520
our home here.

706
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,560
Mr. Wei,

707
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,480
my home is where you are.

708
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,200
What are you doing?

709
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,520
Looking at swans.

710
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,400
Look.

711
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,200
They come in pairs.

712
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,520
That pair there even has a baby swan.

713
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,240
I'm thinking

714
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,680
what our future will look like.

715
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,920
What would I be doing now

716
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,400
if I never met you?

717
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,000
Maybe you would

718
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,400
go on blind dates in every country.

719
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,680
Or maybe

720
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,120
you might marry Liu Yun.

721
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,200
What?

722
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,200
If we never met,

723
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,960
maybe Hui would be your boyfriend.

724
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,800
What? Are you mad now?

725
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,720
No, I'm not.

726
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,240
I was joking.

727
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,480
I was joking.

728
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,640
Come.

729
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,040
Let's not talk about the past.

730
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,400
Hao Weilai.

731
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:04,640
Remember the time you told me
that your wallet was stolen?

732
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,800
I paid for your food.

733
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,960
When are you paying me back?

734
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,400
I didn't order any food.

735
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,600
You did.

736
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,920
Fast food counts too?

737
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,280
Yes.

738
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,000
I'll pay you back once we're home.
