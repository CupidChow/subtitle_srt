in my old company,

147
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,800

164

Sir,

165
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,160
actually, I thought about
the worst-case scenario.

166
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,320
I thought

167
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,320
you'd never come back to me

168
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,760
and I'd never come back here.

169
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,840
I also thought about

170
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,240
the toys you gave me.

171
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,520
When I thought of them,

172
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,480
I felt like

173
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,360
a sinner for abandoning them.

174
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,000
Why do you have
so little faith in yourself?

175
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,720
Because you had never expressed

176
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,920
that you liked me too.

177
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,800
Do you want to be the lady boss?

178
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,080
What are you talking about?

179
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,120
Am I the kind

180
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,040
of person who just wants to
stay stable and not get ahead?

181
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,560
I have to become a better person.

182
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,400
I've made up my mind.

183
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,560
From now on,

184
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,360
I have to work hard.

185
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,000
I can't be too far away from your world,

186
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,040
right?

187
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,560
Your spirit is commendable.

188
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,440
You're holding the magazine upside down.

189
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,440
Just cut me some slack.

190
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,760
What does

191
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,360
"cut you some slack" mean?

192
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,480
Looks like you have

193
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,680
something to learn from me.

194
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,640
I'm keen to learn and
not ashamed to ask.

195
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,920
That depends on your sincerity.

196
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,040
What would you like for dinner?

197
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,160
I'll make it for you.

198
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,920
Braised Pork Ribs.

199
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,560
Okay.

200
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,040
Crayfish.

201
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,080
Sure.

202
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,040
Chinese Mitten Crab.

203
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,760
No problem.

204
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,560
And...

205
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,160
What are you doing?

206
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,640
Don't you want to get up yet?

207
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,040
I'm scratching your skin.

208
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,640
Why didn't you sleep?

209
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,120
I'd like to see you sleeping.

210
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,480
And then what?

211
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,320
Then, I just kept looking at you.

212
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,800
It's so good to see you again.

213
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,640
My dad misses you guys.

214
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,160
Every time he saw Sakura,

215
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,480
he said it's from Xia.

216
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,920
He said Xia's sweet.

217
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,520
He still reserves the rooms for you two.

218
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,880
He said you can stay there

219
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,400
whenever you come back.

220
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,880
This morning, I told him

221
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,200
you were coming

222
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,640
and he blamed me
for not telling him earlier

223
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,920
so he could prepare.

224
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,880
We're lucky

225
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,120
to have met Mischief Man on this trip.

226
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,320
Although

227
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,520
his memory is getting worse now,

228
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,720
his feelings

229
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,760
for people will never change.

230
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,960
What about you? You won't change
your feelings for Xia Yuan, will you?

231
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,200
What are you trying to say?

232
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,000
Xia Yuan has always been my dream girl.

233
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,720
You haven't given up yet, have you?

234
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,320
How dare you say that to my face?

235
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,120
It's better to say it to your face,

236
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,920
it shows that I have a clear conscience,

237
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,280
no ulterior motives.

238
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,720
Don't worry.

239
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,240
I really wish you both happiness.

240
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,120
You'll

241
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,520
find your happiness soon, too.

242
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,120
Thank you.

243
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,040
All right, I got it.

244
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,680
I'll be right there.

245
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,600
Okay, bye.

246
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,120
Siqi,

247
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,320
let's go out with me.

248
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,560
Where to?

249
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,840
To the place where we first met.

250
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,200
What's with the mood?

251
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,800
Any other plans?

252
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,360
No.

253
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,480
Just listen to me.

254
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,120
Go and get changed now.

255
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,840
Sir,

256
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,000
this is where we met for the first time.

257
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,320
What made you think of bringing me here?

258
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,200
Sir,

259
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,720
how did you feel when you first met me?

260
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,640
At that time,

261
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,960
I thought

262
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,280
you're a kind girl.

263
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,800
Just kind?

264
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,600
You didn't fall for me then?

265
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,760
Didn't you end up

266
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,760
stepping into my heart?

267
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,920
Siqi,

268
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,720
I've got a surprise for you.

269
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,400
It's over there.

270
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,920
Go and check it out.

271
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,960
What's the surprise?

272
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,680
Just check it out.

273
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,520
Why don't you come with me?

274
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,720
I'll be right there.

275
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,200
Go.

276
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,320
What's the surprise?

277
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,560
You're acting all mysterious.

278
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,080
Just check it out.

279
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,480
I'll go, then.

280
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,690
[Happiness is inside]

281
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,080
Sir?

282
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,160
Siqi,

283
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,520
it's only been

284
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,080
a few months

285
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,800
since I first met you,

286
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,400
but we've been through a lot.

287
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,760
I was hesitant,

288
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,240
scared,

289
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,520
backed out.

290
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,720
But now, I'm sure

291
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,600
you're the one I want to
spend the rest of my life with.

292
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,720
In the past, you took me
to explore the new world.

293
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,280
So, let me

294
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,480
accompany you to see

295
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,520
a bigger world in the future.

296
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,160
I'll always be with you

297
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,560
and be your man forever.

298
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,400
Siqi,

299
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,920
will you let me be your family

300
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,760
and walk down the aisle with me?

301
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,840
(Siqi.)

302
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,320
Come on, Siqi.

303
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,080
Mom,

304
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,600
this is my favourite ice cream.

305
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,280
Good girl. Dig in now.

306
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,400
Siqi, wait for me at Grandma's house.

307
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,840
I'm going to buy you a doll,

308
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,960
okay?

309
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,440
I want to follow you.

310
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,880
But I want to give you a surprise.

311
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,400
If you come with me,

312
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,400
there'll be no surprise,

313
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,440
right?

314
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,600
I'll wait for you at home.

315
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,040
Good girl.

316
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,320
Siqi,

317
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,280
you must be a good girl.

318
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,800
Listen to Grandma,

319
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,480
okay?

320
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,120
Mom!

321
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,960
Mom, come back!

322
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,400
Mom!

323
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,480
Be my family.

324
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,120
I'll always be with you.

325
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,960
This place is really beautiful.

326
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,240
Are we going to stay here forever?

327
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,840
I came here after I left my parents

328
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,400
and I haven't left since.

329
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,960
But I have you now.

330
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,160
As long as I'm with you,

331
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,520
I can stay anywhere.

332
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,920
Qiao Bin,

333
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,160
I'm touched,

334
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,240
especially during the time
you've been looking for me.

335
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,800
I don't think there's
anyone in the world

336
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,680
who cares more about me than you,

337
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,360
except maybe my parents.

338
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,160
I love you.

339
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,240

Sir,

363
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,920
how long have you been planning this?

364
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,320
Do you remember

365
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,240
that day at Mirror Lake

366
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,680
when you told me you wanted to go home?

367
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,000
At that time,

368
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,480
I wanted to give you a cozy home.

369
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,600
Siqi,

370
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,600
before you showed up,

371
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,000
my life was set in stone,

372
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,480
without a ripple.

373
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,640
I really didn't expect

374
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,520
your presence

375
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,560

563
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,880
Thank you. Sorry to bother you.

564
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,760
It's all right.

565
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,160
Come on in.

566
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,520
- Be careful, Dad.
- Be careful.

567
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,120
It's so heavy.

568
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,320
- Be careful.
- Come on.

569
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,560
Hurry up. Come on.

570
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,960
Change your shoes first.

571
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,480
Come on in.

572
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,840
Come and get some rest.

573
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,520
All right.

574
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,640
Mom, have a seat.

575
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,000
Come and sit down.

576
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,520
My baby girl is finally home.

577
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,960
Come on, sit down.

578
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,640
Sit down.

579
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,680
Let me take a good look at you.

580
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,960
You've lost weight.

581
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,760
No.

582
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,360
Did you have trouble eating abroad

583
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,240
or was it because you were so tired?

584
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,120
Sometimes, it seemed like you were doing

585
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,200
the physical work when
I was on a video call with you.

586
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,760
You must have suffered a lot.

587
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,000
Mom,

588
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,040
I had a great time

589
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,600
eating and playing abroad.

590
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,840
It's like traveling every day.

591
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,280
I was not tired.

592
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,680
We didn't want to

593
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,360
put too much pressure on you
when you were out there.

594
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,440
So, whatever you said,

595
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,160
we fully supported you.

596
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,520
In fact,

597
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,160
we're very worried,

598
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,760
especially your dad.

599
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,200
He didn't usually
check out Moments, right?

600
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,880
Ever since you went abroad,

601
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,840
whenever he's free,

602
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,640
he kept scrolling through Moments

603
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,480
to see if you've updated anything.

604
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,320
Sometimes, when your dad

605
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,840
wanted to make a video call with you,

606
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,880
he would dress up

607
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,360
and say he wanted
to look his best for you.

608
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,680
Don't just talk about me.

609
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,320
You're the same, too.

610
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,720
Come on.

611
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,600
Stewed Chicken Soup?

612
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,800
It's been stewing all morning.

613
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,200
Try it.

614
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,920
When you just left,

615
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:33,000
your mom couldn't
sleep through the night.

616
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,240
Whenever she watched

617
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,360
the news of foreign accidents on TV,

618
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,240
she was terrified.

619
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,000
It's true

620
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,480
that mothers are worried
when their children are far away.

621
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,640
Finally,

622
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,640
you're back safe and sound.

623
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,480
I'm sorry, Mom.

624
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,880
I'm sorry.

625
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,320
I made you and Dad worry.

626
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,320
As long as you came back safe and sound.

627
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,800
Right, Mom.

628
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,280
I bought you a present

629
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,720
while I was in Europe.

630
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,480
I wasn't there for your

631
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,640
wedding anniversary this year.

632
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,800
Look.

633
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,880
My mom always said

634
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,600
your wedding rings are outdated.

635
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,600
These are so beautiful.

636
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,560
My daughter has good taste.

637
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,480
Darling, look.

638
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,920
It's so beautiful.

639
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,800
It's really beautiful.

640
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,440
Here, Mom, put it on.

641
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,200
Well...

642
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,760
All right. I'll put it on.

643
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,960
Let me try it on for size first.

644
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,320
I'll try it, too.

645
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,800
It's so nice.

646
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,280
Darling, look.

647
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,200
- Nice.
- It's so beautiful.

648
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,880
- Nice.
- It's so beautiful.

649
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,040
Thank you.

650
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,360
Yuan,

651
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,920
when are you getting married?

652
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,600
I'll buy you rings

653
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,160
when you get married, too.

654
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,920
Mom, why are you bringing this up again?

655
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,520
When I was abroad,

656
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,520
I wanted to have my dad's chicken soup.

657
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,600
Right?

658
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,240
(You hate me that much, huh?)

659
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,000
You want me to get lost,
don't you? Fine.

660
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Give me 300,000 yuan and I'll get lost.

661
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,600
I've transferred the money
to your account.

662
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,800
Okay, I got it.

663
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,200
I'll get lost as soon as possible.

664
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,400
Do you know that
your dad's business now...

665
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,240
What does my family's business
have to do with me?

666
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,240
Can you be sensible?

667
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,160
He forced me to come abroad
and you still think I am not sensible?

668
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,560
Mr. Wang.

669
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,960
You're back.

670
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,680
Mr. Ge.

671
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,800
Get back to you work.

672
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,560
Why are you back?

673
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,360
Does your dad know?

674
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,680
No, he doesn't.

675
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,720
Where's my dad?

676
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,000
He's upstairs.

677
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,840
I'll take you there.

678
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,160
Mr. Ge,

679
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,560
what's going on with the factory?

680
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,840
Back in the day,

681
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,040
there were over 400 people here,

682
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,600
but now, there are only
about 30 people left.

683
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,360
These 30 or so people still work shifts,

684
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,360
and they can only
work three days a week.

685
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,960
Today,

686
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,600
a few more workers

687
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,080
said they'd quit.

688
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,960
How could this happen?

689
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,360
Since

690
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,160
the company's in debt,

691
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,800
orders have dropped dramatically.

692
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,360
There are only two lines
still in operation.

693
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,040
The products produced by
these two production lines

694
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,200
are the last orders
from the previous OEM.

695
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
At this rate,

696
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,880
we'll have no work

697
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,160
after this is done.

698
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,160
If no new orders come in,

699
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,400
it's hard to keep the company running.

700
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,080
Let's go.

701
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,760
I'm leaving.

702
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,520
What's wrong?

703
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,280
Are you sick? Are you okay?

704
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,960
Why are you back?

705
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,880
Go back now.

706
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,440
Go back?

707
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,000
Go back where?

708
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,120
I've been abroad for a year.

709
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,800
I know everything that's
going on in our family.

710
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,080
I want to stay and help you.

711
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,520
I don't need your help.

712
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,640
You have a studio, don't you?

713
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,960
You've won an award for your studio,

714
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,200
and you're doing so well in your career.

715
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,840
Go do your own thing.

716
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,280
I can handle it.

717
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,920
You can handle it?

718
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,880
You've already sold the house,
can you handle it?

719
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,720
Where are you living now?

720
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:35,640
[Mr. Tang]

721
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:46,480
Hello.

722
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,640
Hello, Mr. Tang.

723
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,880
I'm Xia Yuan.

724
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,160
I'm back.

725
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,080
Hi, Xia Yuan.

726
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,240
How have you been?

727
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,680
I'd like to report to work tomorrow.

728
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,760
Is that okay?

729
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,760
Hello?

730
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,480
Mr. Tang, are you listening?

731
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,440
Well, Xia Yuan,

732
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,000
do you really want to come back?

733
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,840
Yes.

734
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,960
Is there a problem?

735
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,840
I've got

736
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,040
the new project proposal
all done abroad.

737
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
All right.

738
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,120
Let's do this.

739
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,920
You can report to work tomorrow.

740
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,680
Okay, Mr. Tang. See you tomorrow.

741
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,600
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

742
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,080
Yuan.

743
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:46,800
Mom,

744
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,960
you haven't gone to bed yet?

745
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,600
Not yet.

746
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,000
I have to take good care of my daughter.

747
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,200
Come on, sit down.

748
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,520
Mom,

749
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,120
I'm a grown-up now.

750
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,280
I should be taking care of you now.

751
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,960
Yuan,

752
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,600
don't worry.

753
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,400
Your dad and I

754
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,320
have retired.

755
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:04,960
Besides,

756
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,280
we can take good care of ourselves.

757
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,280
We don't have

758
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,200
as much to worry about now.

759
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,320
You, on the other hand,

760
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,160
will have a lot more

761
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,400
to worry about

762
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,680
than we do.

763
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,960
Your dad and I

764
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,200
can't help you

765
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,920
with your work

766
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,520
so we can only

767
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,320
care for you in your life,

768
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,120
take care of your food and living,

769
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,800
and be your backup.

770
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,000
Right, Mom.

771
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,240
I have to report to work tomorrow.

772
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,080
Tomorrow?

773
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,360
That's fast.

774
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,040
Are you physically able to handle it?

775
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,040
No problem. I'm okay.

776
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,160
Yuan,

777
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,360
you've been

778
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,760
away from your job for almost a year

779
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,240
so it must have been stressful for you

780
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,680
to go back to work all of a sudden.

781
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,080
Anyway, don't worry.

782
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,160
Take it easy.

783
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:58,960
You can do it.

784
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,880
Mom, don't worry.

785
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,760
I believe in you.

786
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,240
Go to bed early.

787
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,160
You, too.

788
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,720
Okay. Goodnight.

789
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,760
Tell Dad to go to bed early too.

790
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,800
