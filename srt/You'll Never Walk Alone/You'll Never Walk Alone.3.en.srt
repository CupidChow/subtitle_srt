00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,200
if you insist on keeping her here.

192
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,040
And you will take the consequences

193
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,360
when the police arrive.

194
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,840
By the way, I'm a lawyer.

195
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,080
Don't touch her.

196
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,320
You want to fight?

197
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,280
All right.

198
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,200
This guy used to work as a policeman.

199
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,640
Jack, standby.

200
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,520
Everybody calm down.

201
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,680
You guys still want to try?

202
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,880
Your guys' muscles

203
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,640
versus my guy's gun.

204
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,360
Let me guess, which one will win.

205
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,040
Qi.

206
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,680
Somebody came to pick you up.

207
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,280
Siqi.

208
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,240
Yuan.

209
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,720
Xia Yuan, leave now.

210
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,320
How about you?

211
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,880
Go.

212
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,600
Now you can go.

213
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,840
Give her passport back.

214
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,480
Passport.

215
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,800
Arms down.

216
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,640
How is it? Is Siqi fine?

217
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,920
She slept. We'll talk later.

218
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,240
Jack told us to go back first.

219
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,400
I'll be sure to thank him
when we're back.

220
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,160
That's the first goal.

221
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,640
Yeah.

222
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,960
Nice!

223
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,480
Give me five!

224
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,880
If we're going to surprise them,
let's do it right.

225
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,400
Bin, what do you think?

226
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,360
Bin, our app is on the list.

227
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,520
Stop talking.

228
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,560
Stop talking.

229
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,360
I've made up my mind.

230
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,560
I'm going overseas to win my wife back.

231
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,520
Sleep.

232
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,800
How is she?

233
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,520
Slept?

234
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,680
Yes.

235
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,480
Thanks to you.

236
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,400
You went out to save her
without any hesitation.

237
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,240
I didn't expect you to be so smart.

238
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,120
You can be an FBI,

239
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:52,960
or lawyer,

240
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,520
and sometimes is armed.

241
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,560
You have a quick response.

242
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,760
Come.

243
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,200
What?

244
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,560
More, more.

245
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,480
That's a very nice compliment.

246
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,640
Continue.

247
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,360
All right, I'll stop joking with you.

248
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,200
Well, after today's incident,
we're considered sworn friends.

249
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,160
Let me introduce myself again.

250
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,120
My name is Hao Weilai.

251
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,280
Future.

252
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,120
Xia Yuan.

253
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,280
July.

254
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,960
Your English name
is quite straightforward.

255
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,480
Future.

256
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,280
Well, yours is no better.

257
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,800
July.

258
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,520
First of all, thank you for saving me.

259
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,520
Next, please accept my apologies.

260
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,040
I'm financially limited.

261
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,320
I can only afford

262
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,440
to buy you a meal here.

263
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,600
This is good.

264
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,520
Well, you're someone considerate.

265
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,400
Yuan.

266
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,520
I'm so lucky to have met you.

267
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,000
Thank you.

268
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,760
Thank you too.

269
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,360
Despite the past incidents,

270
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,200
you're a good guy.

271
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,440
And thank you

272
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,080
for getting back my luggage.

273
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,440
That's a piece of cake.

274
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,600
But,

275
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,680
the misunderstanding
between us is nothing

276
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,800
as compared to mine and Yuan.

277
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,840
I bet you didn't know about this.

278
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,200
When we first met,

279
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,720
I was catching a thief

280
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,280
and then she caught me.

281
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,200
There was another time
when I apologized to someone,

282
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,480
and I asked for a favor from her.

283
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,320
She beat the shit out of me

284
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,360
and people mistook me as a playboy.

285
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,480
One time, you were with us.

286
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,000
We went to the health screening center.

287
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,520
She beat me again.

288
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,400
And my father misunderstood me.

289
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,440
This time, she is the most gentle one.

290
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,160
She didn't beat or scold me

291
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,080
but she made me risk my life
to save someone.

292
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,800
Don't you think you're bringing

293
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,200
bad luck to me?

294
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,080
Right?

295
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,000
Do you admit it?

296
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,320
Is that all?

297
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,480
Are you done?

298
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,320
Fine, in regards to
the past misunderstanding,

299
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,480
I apologize, again.

300
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,200
Insincere.

301
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,880
We are even now.

302
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,080
No.

303
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,240
No?

304
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,960
Why?

305
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,240
We are even now.

306
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,360
Let me talk about your issue next.

307
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,480
Yours is very serious.

308
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,720
You should be careful
if you're alone in a foreign country.

309
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,600
Anyhow, you're my

310
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,000
buddy's...

311
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,680
Don't mention him.

312
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,040
If you mention him,
I'm going to slap you.

313
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,880
Are you two

314
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,080
usually so moody?

315
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:48,960
Aren't you two here

316
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,680
to thank me today?

317
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,600
Cheers. Take it easy.

318
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,840
Let's eat.

319
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,640
You eat too.

320
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,680
(What did I do wrong?)

321
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,680
(Met another psycho girl.)

322
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,080
Weilai, how's life in Europe?

323
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,120
Hi.

324
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,800
Urgent. Need help.

325
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,880
Your dad mentioned

326
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,520
not supporting you financially.

327
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,760
You can't do this to me.

328
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,000
You have to support me.

329
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,960
I'm going to die here
if I don't have money.

330
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,920
One, two, three.

331
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,320
Hurry up.

332
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,920
Yuan, look.

333
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,520
Good shot.

334
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,400
Just give up. That's your face.

335
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,800
Yuan, even the roof is so pretty here.

336
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,480
Yuan, pick a photo for me
to post on Weibo.

337
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,800
This one.

338
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,680
Your eyes look weird here.

339
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,280
How about this?

340
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,800
This is not nice.

341
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,520
This?

342
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,640
Uneven brow.

343
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,640
Don't need to look so clearly.

344
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,080
I can always photoshop it.

345
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:44,680
Siqi, do you know
what a green onion looks like?

346
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,160
Yes.

347
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,600
Siqi, do you know
what a daffodil looks like?

348
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,360
Yes.

349
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,680
Do they both look alike?

350
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,200
In terms of the shape, yes.

351
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,960
But they are different.

352
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,840
Daffodil is flower
and green onion is grass.

353
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,920
A photoshopped photo is like grass.

354
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,480
It's not real.

355
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,720
You can never be a flower.

356
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,560
Hao Weilai, you're mocking me!

357
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,280
I'm not.

358
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,800
Stand right there!

359
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,440
Yuan, he bullied me.

360
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:15,960
Hi.

361
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,440
Forget it. Let's go.

362
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,520
Hey, listen.

363
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,360
I'm joking about

364
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,240
the green onion and daffodil.

365
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,720
Excuse me.

366
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,360
My room card doesn't work.

367
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,120
Could you help me to check it?

368
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,560
Yes.

369
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,560
I'm sorry, sir.

370
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,080
Your card has been declined.

371
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,480
Do you want to change your credit card?

372
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,720
No, thanks.

373
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,320
I'd like to check out now.

374
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,880
But I have to take my luggage.

375
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,920
Okay.

376
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,800
Thank you.

377
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,280
By the way,

378
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,560
I need to return my card.

379
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,640
Okay.

380
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,640
Thank you.

381
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,160
I didn't know

382
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,360
having fun can be so tiring.

383
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,560
Stop snacking.

384
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,960
You're young now,

385
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,760
next time, you'll know.

386
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,360
At this hour?

387
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,560
I'll go check.

388
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,360
Xia Yuan.

389
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,040
Why are you here?

390
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,760
Mr. Hao, what do you want?

391
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,760
Are you dumb?

392
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,680
You're guarding against

393
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,200
the wrong person.

394
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,640
I'm leaving.

395
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,800
Where are you going?

396
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,160
To look for a friend.

397
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,600
All right, we're planning
to leave tomorrow too.

398
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,040
All right. Goodbye then.

399
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,240
Bye.

400
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,280
I'll see you out.

401
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,560
Sure.

402
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,360
I'll be out for a while.

403
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,760
Yuan, come back earlier.

404
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,600
Let's say goodbye here.

405
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,800
It's cold out here. Go in.

406
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,720
Okay.

407
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,320
All the best.

408
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,800
You too.

409
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,190
[Weibo NEW @KoalaKiki
A big fall. Luckily I have Yuan!]

410
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,120
Let me out!

411
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,720
Save me! Let me out!

412
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,240
Yuan.

413
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,760
Double espresso

414
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,720
is not for everyone.

415
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,240
I like to stay awake.

416
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,680
I'm impressed.

417
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,560
Siqi,

418
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,920
I've thought about it.

419
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,760
I'm being arbitrary.

420
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,080
I'm here to look for someone,

421
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,720
I shouldn't take up your time.

422
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,840
I'll help you land a job.

423
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,040
What are you interested in?

424
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,360
Yuan, I'm willing to go to
the farm with you.

425
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,760
I know you're a kind-hearted girl.

426
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,600
But there's no need to accompany me.

427
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,240
Yuan, I'm used to surviving alone
in Shanghai.

428
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,000
Shanghai and Europe
are both metropolises.

429
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,480
I survived Shanghai.

430
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,080
Surviving a year in Europe

431
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,800
is no big deal.

432
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,200
But, look.

433
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,800
I failed so badly
when I first came here.

434
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,480
Yuan.

435
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,600
I chose to go to the farm with you

436
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,120
for a selfish reason.

437
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:01,000
With my ability, I don't know

438
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,960
what I'm capable

439
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,360
of doing without you.

440
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:08,440
But I'm afraid
I might bring you trouble too.

441
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,360
Not at all.

442
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,440
I didn't think it through.

443
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,560
This is the first time
you travel abroad.

444
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,120
It's definitely safer

445
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,960
to have someone you know around.

446
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,040
Don't worry. Take your time.

447
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,400
I need to start

448
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,080
to learn to plan.

449
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,240
Let's see what I can do

450
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,040

451
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,800

Excuse me, sir.

485
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,240
Do you work here?

486
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,640
Yes, how can I help you?

487
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,120
We're looking for a person.

488
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,200
Chinese man.

489
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,160
They are all working here.

490
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,120
Maybe you can take a look at the farm.

491
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,120
Okay, thank you.

492
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,040
Follow me.

493
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:44,880
Okay.

494
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,880
Let's go.

495
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,600
Is this your apple farm?

496
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,640
Yes.

497
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,320
Look, this is our apple farm.

498
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,400
Hi.

499
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,240
So many apple trees.

500
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,880
It's really nice here.

501
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:14,840
Thank you.

502
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,720
You're welcome.

503
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,760
Taste it.

504
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,680
Is the apple sweet?

505
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,680
It's so sweet.

506
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,920
Thanks.

507
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,280
I think you're looking for someone.

508
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,200
Yeah.

509
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,520
We are looking for a person.
Name is Song Hangyu, Chinese man.

510
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,880
Thirty years old.

511
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,360
I don't know who that is.

512
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,160
But we can ask the farmkeeper.

513
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,280
Thank you very much.

514
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,440
Just follow me.

515
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,120
Thank you for the help.

516
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,200
You're welcome.

517
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,200
Song?

518
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:05,880
Yes.

519
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,280
He is my fiance.

520
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,480
I saw a packaging

521
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,560
from this farm.

522
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,280
And the packaging
is sent to Song Hangyu.

523
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,160
Did you hear about him?

524
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:14,880
No.

525
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,120
I'm sorry. I don't speak Chinese.

526
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,800
But my daughter does.

527
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,840
We have a lot of Chinese people here

528
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,880
and I just can't remember names.

529
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,120
Does he have an English name?

530
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,640
Hey mum.

531
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,200
This is my daughter, Kate.

532
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,160
Hi, Kate.

533
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,120
Hello.

534
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,040
They are looking for her fiance.

535
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,800
Have we hired anyone
from China recently?

536
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,400
I mean, I put up a new post
about two days ago.

537
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,720
But we haven't had anybody
coming in for interviews.

538
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,320
Oh, right.

539
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,520
We have a Chinese worker here,

540
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,520
Huo Mingxuan.

541
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,000
Who are you looking for?

542
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,440
We are looking for Song Hangyu.
Have you seen him?

543
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,080
Your fiance is not here.

544
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,440
Please leave.

545
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,600
I'm so sorry.

546
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,440
She is not being very nice.

547
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,680
She just divorced.

548
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,600
Maybe she didn't like the word fiance.

549
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:18,200
Really? I just got divorced too.

550
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,640
Poor thing.

551
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,040
No, no. I'm very fine.

552
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,120
If he's not the one,
it's better to be alone.

553
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:25,880
That's true.

554
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,120
Mrs. Smith,

555
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,200
I hear you looking for workers

556
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,640
and still no one showed up.

557
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,120
I think we can have a try.

558
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,080
Work here?

559
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,720
Yes.

560
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,760
Well, it's harvest.

561
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,560
We do need extra people.

562
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,040
But I have to ask Kate.

563
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,800
She's the one operating the farm.

564
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,440
Please, Mrs. Smith.

565
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,160
Please let us help you.

566
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,920
Okay, okay.

567
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,320
But I have to check your IDs.

568
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,960
Yes, of course.

569
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,000
This is my passport.

570
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,040
Looks like everything is in order.

571
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,880
Thank you.

572
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,040
Why are you still here?

573
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,920
They want to work here.

574
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,600
No.

575
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,440
Sorry, Kate.

576
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,560
We've just arrived in this country.

577
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,080
We need this job badly.

578
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:15,640
Yeah.

579
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,160
We really want to work here.

580
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,560
Please.

581
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:21,480
Kate, we really need the extra help.

582
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,200
And they are very kind.

583
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,640
I checked their paper

584
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,760
and they are fine.

585
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,920
We promise we'll get the job done.

586
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,680
Whatever.

587
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,320
Yeah. That means yes.

588
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:43,000
Thank you. You're so sweet, Mrs. Smith.

589
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,040
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

590
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,120
This is the communal kitchen.

591
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,680
So you can cook here,

592
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,320
drink a coffee, and have a rest.

593
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,360
You know I used to live here with Kate

594
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,000
and the other orchard workers.

595
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,400
Kate said they are too young

596
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,720
and sometimes quite noisy.

597
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,760
So she bought me the house

598
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,120
next door.

599
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,240
I live there now, quietly.

600
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,880
Hi.

601
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,360
Hi.

602
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,320
He also works for our farm.
He is from China.

603
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,000
You're Chinese.

604
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,040
Yes.

605
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,600
I'm Ye Siqi. You can call me Kiki.

606
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,920
I'm Huo Mingxuan.

607
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,760
Hello, hello. Nice to meet you.

608
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,480
Sure.

609
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,200
Hi, I'm Xia Yuan.

610
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,440
Hi.

611
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,160
Okay, Mrs. Smith.

612
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,640
We're really thankful and plus Kate.

613
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,680
Of course, we'll do our best.

614
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,840
I must apologize for Kate.

615
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,960
She used to be so outgoing,

616
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,560
and kind with everyone.

617
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,880
But since divorce,

618
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,360
she changed.

619
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,600
I can understand.

620
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,840
Divorce is not something
to be happy about.

621
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,080
It's true.

622
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,880
So, we'll have a rest today.

623
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,680
I'll let you see around the farm.

624
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,280
And we'll start work tomorrow.

625
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,480
Okay.

626
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,400
Let me show you the way.

627
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,720
Okay, let's go.

628
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,600
- Bye.
- Bye.

629
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,920
Here we are.

630
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,760
It's quite nice here.

631
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,320
Thank you, it's quite nice here.

632
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,800
See you.

633
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,920
See you. Bye.

634
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,120
Bye.

635
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,240
The house on this farm is so pretty.

636
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,920
Yuan, you sleep over here.

637
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,640
I'll sleep there.

638
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,160
No need. You can take the bed.

639
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,480
I like this one.

640
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,440
Thank you.

641
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,880
Let's see.

642
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,880
We have an individual bathroom.

643
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,240
This is great.

644
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,760
Hey, come.

645
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,040
Video call with your daughter. Hurry up.

646
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,520
Coming.

647
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,160
Come.

648
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,360
We are doing fine here.

649
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,520
It's like a holiday.

650
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,720
Look. This is my bed.

651
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,160
So soft and comfortable.

652
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,200
Oh, let me show you.

653
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,240
This is my roommate.

654
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,360
Hello, I'm Siqi.

655
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,280
I'll take care of her for you.

656
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,360
Don't worry.

657
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,120
This is Fairy Siqi's bed.

658
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,440
Look. This is our table lamp.

659
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,680
So cute.

660
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,880
Here.

661
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,320
There's an individual bathroom.

662
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,960
These are our clothes.

663
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,320
The owner is very nice to us.

664
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,400
Mrs. Smith is warm and welcoming.

665
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,880
Don't worry.

666
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,200
Go to bed earlier.

667
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,800
- Good night.
- Good night.

668
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,040
Yuan, the atmosphere
is great in your family.

669
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,280
Unlike me,

670
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,960
my dad passed away when I was a kid.

671
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,400
Count on me! I'll take care of you.

672
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,840
You're so nice to me.

673
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:13,960
No sugar.

674
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,520
Let me. Thank you.

675
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,840
I'm happy that you're here.

676
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,120
Where is Zhang?

677
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,640
I fired her a long time ago.

678
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,480
Uncle, this is not good.

679
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,760
Anything I can help with?

680
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,720
I'm doing good. Just...

681
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,760
I'm worried about Weilai.

682
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,080
That brat blocked me yesterday.

683
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,160
Don't you know him?
He's just being willful.

684
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,800
He always blocks me too.

685
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,840
But don't worry.

686
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,000
He'll unblock you after a day or two.

687
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,920
Whatever. He is always like this.

688
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,120
No one

689
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,200
would spoil him like me when he's out.

690
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,160
I wonder how is he doing now.

691
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,680
Uncle, look.

692
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,360
He is living his life.

693
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:11,720
[GoodFeature. Today.
Street food taste good too.]

694
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,160
He never eats street food.

695
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,000
It seems like

696
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,440
he has spent the 10,000 euros
that I gave him.

697
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,160
Uncle, you don't know him at all.

698
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,480
We used to eat street food

699
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,280
all the time here.

700
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,920
Street food is his favorite.

701
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,640
Panni, update me on Weilai's situation

702
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,520
as soon as possible.

703
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,680
I will, don't worry.

704
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,600
Did he ask for money from you?

705
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,800
No.

706
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,280
Slow down. Don't eat so fast.

707
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,800
You're gonna get sick.

708
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,320
Thank you, Mrs. Smith.

709
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,000
Of course, you're welcome.

710
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,520
Who let them in?

711
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,880
I did. They were hungry.

712
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,680
We finished our food.

713
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,160
We haven't got the time to buy any.

714
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,080
We have no choice but to ask for help.

715
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:15,960
We are hungry.

716
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,720
Do you guys like to eat

717
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,320
and use others' stuff?

718
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,520
Xia Yuan.

719
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,120
Or,

720
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,600
you like things
that belong to someone else.

721
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,920
That's too much!

722
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,680
It's just a meal. What's the issue?

723
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,200
Okay, Kate.

724
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,600
I gave them something to eat.

725
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,840
They were hungry.

726
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,520
Why are you so angry?

727
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,200
Sorry, Kate. I crossed the line.

728
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,400
We'll leave now.

729
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,360
Let's go.

730
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,840
Why are you always against Yuan?

731
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,280
Wait. Take some bread with you.

732
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,360
Thank you, Mrs. Smith.

733
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,360
We are so sorry.

734
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:53,920
You're welcome.

735
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,160
Thank you.

736
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,200
Kate, what happened to you?

737
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,280
Ever since the divorce,

738
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,920
you become mean.

739
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,000
You didn't used to be like this.

740
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,440
Why are you so angry?

741
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,160
I don't want to talk about that.

742
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,680
Alan.

743
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,000
Alan.

744
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,360
Alan.

745
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,600
Wake up.

746
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,840
Alan, what are you doing?

747
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,160
Who are you?

748
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,960
Who are you?
Why are you pointing me with a gun?
