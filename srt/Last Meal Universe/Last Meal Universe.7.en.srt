1
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,600
Here.

2
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,560
Thank you.

3
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,040
I'm starving.

4
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,480
Do you have something to eat?

5
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,560
How have you been?

6
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,160
It had been a while.

7
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,440
I miss your cooking.

8
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,400
See you later.

9
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,400
See you.

10
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,240
No more food.

11
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,720
It's alright.

12
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,720
I’ll eat anything you have.

13
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,160
The water is over there.

14
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,400
Self-service.

15
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,000
Couldn’t you serve me?

16
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,400
Couldn’t you serve me?

17
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,800
Thank you.

18
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,880
Keep it.

19
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,360
Delicious huh?

20
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,360
Mm.

21
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,440
Delicious as always.

22
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,920
You aren't going to ask

23
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,480
why am I here?

24
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,200
No.

25
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,080
Hurry up and leave.

26
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,320
Chan Dan.

27
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,440
Are you still angry at me?

28
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,960
I’m not angry

29
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,960
but hate you.

30
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,600
I HATE YOU.

31
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,240
Well. I won’t pretend anymore.

32
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,000
I came here because I miss you.

33
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,040
I came here because I miss you.

34
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,960
Miss me?

35
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,080
You’re so fake.

36
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,320
Miss me? Oh please.

37
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,440
Just eat and go.

38
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,360
What? I’m your damn customer.

39
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:06,880
Oh, are you?

40
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,120
Yes!

41
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,760
My restaurant is available for good customers only.

42
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,560
If you blow me off,

43
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,640
I’ll report it to OPBC.

44
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,920
It's OCPB, you idiot.

45
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,400
Hurry up and get out of my face!

46
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,920
Hey.

47
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,440
Where is it?

48
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,160
Where is what?

49
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,760
Where is my commission fee?

50
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,640
I will report it to HGS.

51
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,000
What HGS?

52
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,880
You idiot.

53
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,600
It's very popular.

54
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,840
What commission?

55
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,760
I don’t know what are you talking about.

56
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,560
Damn you.

57
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,000
I worked my ass off!

58
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,960
But in the end, you took my commission!

59
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,440
Well…

60
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,200
I was pressed for money back then.

61
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,640
Couldn’t you let it slide?

62
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,080
And now?

63
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,400
A little.

64
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,840
Shit-

65
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,200
I saw this bracelet.

66
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,440
It was only 50 baht from a retail shop in Sampeng!

67
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,040
By the way,

68
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,040
I came to inform you that

69
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,200
at the company

70
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,520
there's a vacancy.

71
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,000
Do you want to reapply?

72
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,320
Do you want to reapply?

73
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,760
Well, I

74
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,360
I sacrifice my time to look for you.

75
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,000
No, thank you.

76
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,360
My life is ok now.

77
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,520
Thank you by the way.

78
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,120
Hey.

79
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,040
Chun?

80
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,160
Hey?

81
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,000
Wait.

82
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,320
Wait.

83
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,480
Where are you going?

84
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,920
I’ll be back. Take care of my shop.

85
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,400
What?

86
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,400
What the?

87
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,200
Chan Dan!

88
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,880
Gosh.

89
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,280
Who taught him to cook an omelet like this?

90
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,960
I’m not eating it.

91
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,120
Wait a moment, please.

92
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,200
Hey.

93
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,000
Hey.

94
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,760
Hey.

95
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,600
Chun.

96
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,320
I must warn you that

97
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,400
your suitcase contains a powerful power.

98
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,200
Moreover, both you and the bomb

99
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,240
have a timed-tracking chip implanted.

100
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,640
If you resist,

101
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,120
the Space Police Force will capture you.

102
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,560
You must accomplish your mission as soon as possible.

103
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,000
Chun.

104
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,200
Chun.

105
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,080
I’ll return to my planet soon.

106
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,080
Are you angry at me or something?

107
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,720
You don’t have to be worried.

108
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,680
Contact the operational officer.

109
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,000
Understood.

110
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,720
Understood.

111
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,600
The operational officer is on a mission call, now.

112
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,200
Please wait a moment.

113
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,560
Project One Wealth One Universe

114
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,120
is a major project of space.

115
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,080
We have assigned a well-prepared engineer

116
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,040
to carry out the mission.

117
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,560
And this mission

118
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,840
will be accomplished soon.

119
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,440
We are ready.

120
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,000
What about you, Spacemen?

121
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,200
What about you, Spacemen?

122
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,400
Are you ready to live in the most developed world in the universe?

123
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,040
It won’t be long and

124
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,720
the Space Expressway

125
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,080
will be the best of the universe.

126
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,680
Please, report the progression.

127
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,120
2225? Are you still on the call?

128
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,440
Oh.

129
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,320
Y-yss. I am.

130
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,280
I um...

131
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,520
I’m ready

132
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,000
to press the button.

133
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,480
to press the button.

134
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,400
Please inform me of the location and suitable time.

135
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,080
What a great news.

136
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,400
Please wait a minute.

137
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,000
Project One Wealth One Universe

138
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,560
is a major project of space.

139
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,320
We have assigned a well-prepared engineer-

140
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,040
2225?

141
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,320
Yes?

142
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,720
I’m still on the line.

143
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,000
Destroy the third planet

144
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,960
Destroy the third planet

145
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,360
of the solar system.

146
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:09,160
Time 17:00 GMT+7 standard time.

147
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,520
The bomb pressing location, original coordinates.

148
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,760
Understood.

149
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,720
Where the hell have you been?

150
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,240
You left me alone

151
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,080
with YOUR rotten omelet.

152
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,560
Shut up.

153
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,520
Hey, Bro.

154
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,600
A moment ago.

155
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,560
Who was that?

156
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,120
Your boyfriend?

157
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,080
No.

158
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,200
That was my friend.

159
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,760
For real?

160
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,000
He’s really your friend?

161
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,400
Yes.

162
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,600
What the hell are you smiling for?

163
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,320
Hmm…

164
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,960
Isn’t he just a friend?

165
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,360
Why are you jealous?

166
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,600
Chun!

167
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,600
Where are you going?

168
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,040
What the hell is wrong with your eyes now?

169
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,160
You.

170
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,280
You’re Mimiw’s friend.

171
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,240
You know my cat?

172
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,600
Oh.

173
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,800
Mimiw didn't come with you today?

174
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,000
He probably running around like a cat would.

175
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,920
He probably running around like a cat would.

176
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,560
Amen. Doing it.

177
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,640
He must be hungry.

178
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,400
So um...

179
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,400
You and Miniw

180
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,840
live in the same house?

181
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,720
Well.

182
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,240
Of course.

183
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,840
Why did you ask?

184
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,840
Who are you?

185
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,040
I never saw you before.

186
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,000
Oh,

187
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,400
Oh,

188
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,560
I…

189
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,320
Hm. Forget about it.

190
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,920
He has been out for long.

191
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,600
It will be dark soon.

192
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,560
I’m worried that he might get hit by a car.

193
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,040
Sigh.

194
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:15,680
Uh.

195
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,240
Sir.

196
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,840
What if

197
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,000
today

198
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,840
today

199
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,240
you have to die,

200
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,200
What will you do?

201
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,440
Strange question.

202
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,400
Well, I don’t know when I will die.

203
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,000
And I don’t know what I should do.

204
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,440
And I don’t know what I should do.

205
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,200
But I know that

206
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,600
I live with something that makes me happy.

207
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,600
And that's enough.

208
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,520
And…

209
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,560
It…

210
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,880
What is the difference?

211
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,000
It’s different.

212
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,320
It’s different.

213
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,360
If I know that I’m going to die,

214
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,200
I would stay with something or someone that makes me happy.

215
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,720
And I’ll stay with them as long as possible.

216
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,520
Happiness…

217
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,000
What is happiness?

218
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,280
What is happiness?

219
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,440
Happiness?

220
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,680
It’s just…

221
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,680
Who we’re staying with

222
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,120
or something that

223
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,600
can make us smile,

224
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,160
can eat

225
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,640
and can sleep.

226
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,640
That's happiness.

227
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,600
And…

228
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,920
What if

229
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,360
you don’t know

230
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,040
when you will die?

231
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,960
Then I’ll make every day a happy day for me.

232
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,440
Knowing or not.

233
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,720
It's the same.

234
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,000
Right?

235
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,720
Right?

236
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,560
Oh.

237
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,440
Mimiw.

238
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,960
Mimiw.

239
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,320
You’ve been hiding here hm?

240
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,280
Come. Let's go home.

241
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,800
Come on.

242
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,480
Ah.

243
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,680
Let’s go home.

244
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,360
Come. Let’s go.

245
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,200
Mimiw.

246
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,120
Since when did you come?

247
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,280
Tell him when he saw, little one.

248
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,000
Hm.

249
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,200
Hm.

250
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,000
Hehe.

251
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
So, you love wandering around hm?

252
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,320
Hm.

253
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,600
It's getting dark. We better go home.

254
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,920
Yeah?

255
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,760
Hm.

256
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,440
This is

257
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,600
my happiness.

258
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,480
I have to go now.

259
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,600
Come, Mimiw.

260
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,840
Oh. Hey.

261
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,040
Don’t squirm. Ok?

262
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,800
Don’t squirm. Ok?

263
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,160
There.

264
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,280
Let's go.

265
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,320
Let’s go home.

266
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,680
Say goodbye to him.

267
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,800
Hm.

268
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:16,520
Today you wandered quite far.

269
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,480
Hm.

270
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,920
Oh.

271
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,280
Oh. You came home late today.

272
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,280
Go play, little one.

273
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,000
Hm.

274
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,520
Hm.

275
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,440
Oh.

276
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,720
Why did you buy so many things?

277
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,800
Meow~

278
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,000
Oh.

279
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,800
They are your favorite foods.

280
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,400
Hm.

281
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,480
Thank you so much.

282
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,080
I’ll take my leave then.

283
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,920
Wait. Wait.

284
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,000
You bought so many of them.

285
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,640
I won’t be able to finish it by myself.

286
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,960
Haha!

287
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,880
Here.!

288
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,160
I’m your helper.

289
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,600
Mimiw is here!

290
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,480
Meow~

291
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,960
No. Mimiw.

292
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,000
Go eat your food.

293
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,320
Go eat your food.

294
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,440
You always intervene when I’m eating.

295
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,600
Mimiw!

296
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,720
Meow!

297
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,440
Hm!

298
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,520
Heh.

299
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,240
Oh.

300
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,880
Come eat.

301
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,440
So this one is Fish cakes.

302
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,760
You eat it with Crab in coconut dip from Chan Dan's shop.

303
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,880
They taste well together.

304
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,200
Oh, the Grandma’s restaurant.

305
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,880
Her food was delicious.

306
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,960
Hm. I'll try Fish cakes first.

307
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,640
How is it?

308
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,480
Hm.

309
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,760
Not bad.

310
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,280
I don't know why

311
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,560
my tongue can't taste much.

312
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,360
No matter what I eat, it doesn't taste very good.

313
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,960
Oh.

314
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,720
And

315
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,160
about your new shop.

316
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,960
Is there a lot of customers?

317
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,400
Did your mother know?

318
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,040
Hey.

319
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,600
But don't think much about it.

320
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,400
Each person has their path.

321
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,800
You’re a man.

322
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,000
You must be consistent

323
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,920
You must be consistent

324
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,040
and strong.

325
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,440
Ok?

326
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,360
Go on.

327
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,920
You should hurry up and eat.

328
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,120
It's night already. You should go home soon.

329
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,840
If not and your mom comes home,

330
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,480
you guys will get into a fight again.

331
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,960
I understand.

332
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,400
I know that Mom is worried about you.

333
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,560
Ok?

334
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,920
If living alone is difficult,

335
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,920
then come back to our home.

336
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,960
Don’t worry about Mom.

337
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,480
Endure it a little bit longer.

338
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,320
I’ll talk to her, Son.

339
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,840
Mom, she loves you.

340
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,480
That's why she worries about you.

341
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,040
Just give in to her Son.

342
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:34,480
We have only you.

343
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,640
Stop teasing me!

344
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,120
Oh, come on!

345
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:09,920
Go home.

346
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,920
I don’t want to.

347
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,280
Don’t you have other things to do?

348
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,560
Tell me your friend’s name first.

349
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,960
Why do you want to know his name?

350
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,560
Well. He’s just a friend, isn’t he?

351
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,320
Chun.

352
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,040
Where have you been??

353
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,520
Ouch!

354
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,000
Ahh!

355
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,960
Ahh!

356
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,800
What is wrong with you?

357
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,040
I suddenly have a stomach ache.

358
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,080
Ouch.

359
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,320
I must be starving.

360
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,640
Huh?

361
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,720
I guess I’m starving.

362
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,720
I can't go home anymore.

363
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,560
I can’t go home like this. Can I have something to eat first?

364
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,760
Ouch.
What did you mean hungry? You just ate.

365
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,480
Gosh. Your awful omelet? Who could eat that?

366
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,400
Ah.

367
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,160
I can’t take it.

368
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,400
Take me to the chair. It's painful.

369
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,240
Gosh.

370
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,240
What the hell?

371
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,320
Ouch!

372
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,600
Ouch.

373
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,000
Oh, god.

374
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,320
Oh, god.

375
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,840
Ouch.

376
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,680
Ah.

377
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,400
Gosh.

378
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,080
Ouch.

379
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,760
Hurry up!

380
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,120
Make me something to eat.

381
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,680
I’m hungry.

382
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,160
Hungry?

383
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,480
Get out of my shop and go home.

384
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,080
I told you that I can’t.

385
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,320
Why you leave up my glock.

386
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,960
No need to blow me off.

387
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,000
What about you?

388
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,400
What about you?

389
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,680
Oh.

390
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,400
I’m hungry too.

391
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,880
You too?

392
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,280
Ouch!

393
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,080
That's hurt.

394
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:42,760
What is wrong with you?

395
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,120
Are you going home or not?

396
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,280
Fine! Fine!

397
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,520
Stop threatening me.

398
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,200
Hm.

399
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,160
What about you?

400
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,000
You said that you would go home.

401
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,560
You said that you would go home.

402
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,800
Um…

403
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,800
Well…

404
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,160
What are you guys talking about?

405
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,480
None of your business.

406
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,360
What? You!

407
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,800
The hell.

408
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,760
I only asked.

409
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,320
Hm…

410
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,880
It's um…

411
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,480
It's…

412
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,000
Before I destroy this world.

413
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,200
Before I destroy this world.

414
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,520
I want to come back to my happiness.

415
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,160
What do you mean?

416
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,800
Well.

417
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,840
Someone told me that

418
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,520
if we ate a delicious food

419
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,840
enjoyed it

420
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,520
and had a good sleep,

421
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,000
that was happiness.

422
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,760
that was happiness.

423
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,720
And your cooking

424
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,120
is like what I said.

425
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,880
What are you guys talking about?

426
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,640
I’m hungry.

427
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:26,920
Shut up.

428
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,520
Why don’t you go home already?

429
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:29,920
Huh?

430
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,000
I know. Just hurry up and get me food.

431
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,320
I know. Just hurry up and get me food.

432
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,600
So I can leave.

433
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,040
Right?

434
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,000
Nice to meet you.

435
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,960
I’m Boss.

436
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,920
I’m his best friend.

437
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,680
I'm not your best friend.

438
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:41,720
You said

439
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,520
if I get you something to eat,

440
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,720
you will go home right?

441
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,120
Yes.

442
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,080
Fine.

443
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,000
Wait here.

444
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,840
What's your name?

445
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:52,720
Oh.

446
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,160
Don't talk to him, Chun!

447
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:58,840
Now go.

448
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,000
Whoa! I can walk damn it!

449
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,120
Whoa! I can walk damn it!

450
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:00,840
Here.

451
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,600
What?

452
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,760
I packed the food for you.

453
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,480
Now leave.

454
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,280
What the hell did you give me to eat again?

455
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,120
Huh?

456
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,640
Chan Dan!

457
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,880
You can't do this to me!

458
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,640
Chan Dan!

459
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,520
Hey!

460
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,560
Wait!

461
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,400
Chan Dan!

462
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,320
Hey!

463
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,560
What is this thing?

464
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,480
God.

465
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,520
Chan Dan!

466
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,600
Chan Dan!

467
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,640
I won't forget this!

468
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,480
Sigh.

469
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,840
You said that

470
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,400
my cooking was your happiness.

471
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,760
You meant that?

472
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,920
Yes.

473
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,240
Your food

474
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,280
it's so delicious

475
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,000
and it makes me happy.

476
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,880
and it makes me happy.

477
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,520
I came back

478
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,240
because I would like to eat your cooking

479
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,600
for the last time.

480
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,480
My last meal.

481
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,880
Before I destroyed this planet.

482
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,840
I’m hungry.

483
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,760
Hurry up.

484
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,680
Late-night rice porridge is here.

485
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,000
Wow,

486
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,840
Wow,

487
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,120
Rice porridge!

488
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,640
Hm.

489
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,400
Give it a try.

490
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,720
Mm…

491
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,560
You're so good at cooking.

492
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,840
It's because my cooking

493
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,840
is your happiness.

494
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,280
Eat as much as you want.

495
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,120
Thank you.

496
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,160
Hey.

497
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:25,360
If you say that my food is delicious.

498
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,000
can…

499
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,080
can…

500
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:34,280
Can you stay and eat it every day?

501
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
And you aren't angry at me?

502
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,360
I have to destroy-

503
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,320
Just eat.

504
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,200
Don’t talk about other things now.

505
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,720
Delicious?

506
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,800
Very delicious.

507
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:50,120
Can you say that every day?

508
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,440
Best

509
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,000
friend.

510
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,360
friend.

511
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,480
Hey.

512
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,960
Be careful.

513
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,680
Ok.

514
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,200
I’ll go get a cloth.

515
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,800
Wait a minute.

516
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,000
What is wrong with me?

517
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,400
What is wrong with me?

518
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,280
Why you haven’t pressed the button?

519
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,600
You’re violating our rules!

520
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:46,200
Press the button! This is an order!

521
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,560
But it's too late.

522
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,160
I’m so sorry.

523
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,120
All done.

524
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,280
Here.

525
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,040
Thank you.

526
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:57,080
Thank you so much.

527
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,360
Oh!

528
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,440
Hey!

529
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,920
Well. Well.

530
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,960
Fully dressed.

531
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,080
Where are you going?

532
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,320
Hm.

533
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,200
I’ll go home.

534
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,840
Home?

535
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,000
Like Doa?

536
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,440
Like Doa?

537
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,400
Hmm, a lot of people from Dao Khanong.

538
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,760
Hmm?

539
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,920
Do you want it?

540
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,960
Take it.

541
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,040
Are you sure?

542
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,480
But

543
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,480
I don’t have money.

544
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,000
It's alright.

545
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,160
It's alright.

546
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,400
Because you’re the only one saying that my coffee is good.

547
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,560
That's all I need to make me happy.

548
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,720
Consider it a farewell gift.

549
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,960
Ahh.

550
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,000
It is really delicious right?

551
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,360
It is really delicious right?

552
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,400
Yes.

553
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,440
Drink as much as you want.

554
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,920
I’ll be right back.

555
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:28,440
Donate to feed homeless animals?

556
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,680
Oh, you are so kind.

557
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,000
Sis, please donate.

558
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,680
Sis, please donate.

559
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,680
Of course!

560
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,840
Where’s my money?

561
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,720
Oh!
Wow!

562
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,720
You donate a lot.

563
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,440
Thank you so much.

564
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,680
Hmm.

565
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,960
Can I play?

566
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,320
Of course.

567
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:48,160
Move. Move.

568
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,480
Wow, she plays really well.

569
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,440
Yes.
You play very well.

570
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,920
Awesome!

571
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,520
Really?

572
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,400
Really.

573
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,720
Why does she seem so happy?

574
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,960
I’m sorry

575
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,000
that I have to destroy this planet.

576
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:53,600
Chun, what are you doing?

577
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,600
Cape

578
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,600
I’m going to do my mission

579
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,000
Huh?

580
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,880
What.

581
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,760
I can’t hear anything.

582
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,560
What was that?

583
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,120
What are you doing?

584
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,760
I'm going to press the button.

585
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,760
Now

586
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,080
you have to go.

587
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,240
Huh? What?

588
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,960
Now, hurry up and escape!

589
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,200
Escape what?

590
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,360
I don’t understand.

591
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,920
Can you speak louder?

592
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,280
Huh? What?

593
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,880
Now you must escape!

594
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,600
Escape what?

595
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,560
Oh. Ok. Ok.

596
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,440
What was that?

597
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,880
Could speak a bit louder?

598
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,120
I can’t hear anything.

599
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,680
What was that again?

600
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,040
Huh?

601
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,520
What did you say?

602
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,000
I can’t hear it.

603
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,520
Can you say that again?

604
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:57,080
Um, could you please be quiet?

605
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,000
I can’t hear.

606
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,440
I can’t hear.

607
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,680
Hey!

608
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,760
Could you stop playing for a minute?

609
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,320
What did you say again?

610
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,600
Gosh!

611
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,560
I told you to run.

612
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,560
The policemen!

613
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,960
The Space Policemen are after you.

614
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,200
Huh?

615
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,080
POLICE?!

616
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:14,640
Yes!

617
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,560
The Space Policemen!

618
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,240
Holy-

619
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,320
Oh God!
