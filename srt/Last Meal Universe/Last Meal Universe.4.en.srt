1
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,440
Look at you.

2
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,120
Gosh!

3
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,000
Tired. I’m tired.

4
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,520
Tired. I’m tired.

5
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,480
Or should I hurry up and destroy this planet?

6
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,320
No!

7
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,760
I cannot do that.

8
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,160
Now I have an owner.

9
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,560
Moreover

10
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,320
if I destroy it

11
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,240
I won’t be able to eat delicious food.

12
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,400
You’re weird.

13
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,000
Hm?

14
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,360
You could hear me?

15
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,520
You’re too tired and turning weird.

16
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,600
Go get some rest.

17
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,760
Oh.

18
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,960
What?

19
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,480
Hm?

20
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,320
It's yours?

21
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,520
Yes.

22
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,760
But

23
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,840
I decided that I wouldn’t take it anymore.

24
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,000
That's good.

25
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,240
If you don’t have to depend on it anymore.

26
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,480
Here.

27
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,000
Take it.

28
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Take it.

29
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,880
You worked tiringly, you should keep it.

30
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:40,960
But-

31
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,440
You’re still here with me right?

32
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,800
You can return it to me. Once you have a better job.

33
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,000
Um..

34
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
On my planet, we don't use money.

35
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,080
But we use this capsule

36
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,960
to pay for working.

37
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,600
I’ll try to understand you.

38
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,600
But I suggest that

39
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,920
you should get some rest now.

40
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,320
Please.

41
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,520
Go to bed.

42
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,560
If you need anything just tell me.

43
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,080
Here.

44
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,680
And I have to wash it for you?

45
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,560
Oh, by the way, I think you should continue taking the pills.

46
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,760
Oh. And

47
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,600
don’t be afraid of my grandmother.

48
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,080
She was a kind person.

49
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,520
Are you scared of ghosts?

50
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,920
Hm.

51
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,560
Gosh!

52
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,760
Ah!

53
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,960
Ah!

54
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,520
Don’t tell me..

55
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,000
Gosh!

56
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,760
Don’t tell me..

57
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,240
That…

58
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,760
It must be..

59
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,240
Gravity! Yes!

60
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,560
This planet's gravity is so strong.

61
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,720
Grandma, turn this way ok?

62
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,720
Stay there. That way. You scared me.

63
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,960
Oh.

64
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,120
So, this is how strong gravity is.

65
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,120
It fell and scared me.

66
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,680
Ah!

67
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,120
Electric shocking?

68
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,880
What shocked?

69
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,600
Ah.

70
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,720
I don't want to get up and turn off the light.

71
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,040
We don’t have much time left

72
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,720
for blowing up the earth.

73
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,400
To ensure our work goes smoothly.

74
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,200
I had decided.

75
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,840
I will send the most useless operator

76
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,760
to earth and complete this mission.

77
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,520
And why the most useless?

78
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,960
Well.

79
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,320
His only task is to press the button.

80
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,280
We don't need to use skilled operator.

81
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,760
Right?

82
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,000
So this time.

83
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,320
So this time.

84
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,080
It has to be him then.

85
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,920
I’m here, Sir.

86
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,560
Oh, you’re here.

87
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,360
As we all know

88
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,920
on earth

89
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,000
there are no Atlantieanes left.

90
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,600
there are no Atlantieanes left.

91
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,520
Because

92
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,760
they have made a contract to sell earth

93
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,200
to the Space Expressway Organization.

94
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,880
Later on, we have been planning for a long time.

95
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,880
And we agree that

96
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,040
the areas on earth

97
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,720
are suitable for constructing roads.

98
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,960
And make it the space expressway.

99
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,400
Hold on for a second.

100
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,000
Don’t we need to inform the humans first?

101
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,880
No need.

102
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,880
They must have known already

103
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,000
that one day, their last day would come.

104
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,680
Your mission is

105
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,360
going to Earth and destroy it.

106
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,600
It's a highly important mission. I see your potential.

107
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,000
That's why I choose you.

108
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,040
The most important and suitable man

109
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,400
of this space.

110
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,880
But

111
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,920
you must remember that

112
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,320
this mission

113
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,800
must not be failed for the third time.

114
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,760
Must not.

115
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,000
Third time?

116
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,040
Third time?

117
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,360
Some had said that

118
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,240
The first two operators

119
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,360
went missing during the mission.

120
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,440
Even the Satellite operator

121
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,280
couldn’t find them.

122
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,680
Don’t look at me like that.

123
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,200
I really couldn't find them.

124
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:26,960
Alright, Alright.

125
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,640
You don't need to wonder.

126
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,000
Let's just say I have time for you to go and do your duty.

127
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,480
Let's just say I have time for you to go and do your duty.

128
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,600
Destroy the earth.

129
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,960
So, we can finally build a space highway to another planet.

130
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,440
If you can complete it

131
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,600
I’ll consider a promotion for you.

132
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,360
And.

133
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,240
How do a hundred thousand food capsules sound?

134
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,320
Hm.

135
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,160
I am

136
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,680
giving you a chance.

137
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,600
Do not disappointed me.

138
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,120
What are you doing?

139
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,880
Oh!

140
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:48,960
Ah!

141
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,520
Be careful!

142
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,960
Oh gosh.

143
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,240
You’re so clumsy.

144
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,880
This is the second time already.

145
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,680
Hm..

146
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,880
What is that smell?

147
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,240
It’s the smell of Chinese stewed spices.

148
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,200
What is it?

149
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,800
Can I have them?

150
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,880
At 5 a.m.?

151
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,960
I haven’t finished cooking

152
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,000
How about this?

153
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,440
How about this?

154
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,600
If you want to eat it faster

155
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,400
then come help me.

156
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,040
Hm?

157
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,320
Help you?

158
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,400
What are looking at?

159
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,160
Help me peel the eggs.

160
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,800
What? Don’t tell me you don’t know how.

161
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,800
Do you even know how to cook?

162
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,280
Oh.

163
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,920
Your parents must be the ones cooking for you.

164
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,280
Hurry up. Help me peel them.

165
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,920
The sun almost rises.

166
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,960
Like this. Easy right?

167
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,680
Hm.

168
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,960
Wow!

169
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,240
Eggs!

170
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:46,720
What?

171
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,640
Hey!

172
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,640
Hm, what?

173
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,920
Why did you eat it?

174
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,280
Eggs are not edible?

175
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,880
No! Wait! Wait!

176
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,480
Eat it!

177
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,800
Don’t spit it out!

178
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,360
Eat it!

179
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:56,840
What?

180
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,280
Eat?

181
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,760
I can eat it?

182
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,800
Do you want some?

183
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,000
What?!

184
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,360
What?!

185
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,120
Do you want some?

186
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:01,560
No. I’m good.

187
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,000
Here!

188
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,840
Eat it!

189
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,680
Don’t spit out.

190
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,320
Swallow it!

191
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,600
Come on.

192
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,960
Swallow it.

193
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,920
It's edible. Don’t spit out.

194
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,080
Eat it.

195
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,160
You eat it.

196
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,800
How could he eat it whole?

197
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,600
Mm!

198
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,160
Delicious!

199
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,360
So delicious!

200
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:15,920
What?

201
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,600
Your egg is delicious.

202
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,200
Your egg is delicious.

203
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,640
Finish chewing first.

204
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,520
Finish chewing first and then speak.

205
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,720
Ok?

206
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,960
Can I have more eggs?

207
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,880
Can I have more eggs?

208
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,280
Finish the one on your mouth first.

209
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,400
Ah.

210
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,600
Hold on.

211
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,560
Miniw.

212
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,480
Where are you, Mimiw?

213
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,440
Come and eat your food.

214
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,160
Mimiw?

215
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,880
It's been a whole day now and you haven't eaten anything yet.

216
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,000
Mimiw.

217
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,040
Mimiw.

218
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,240
Where are you?

219
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,240
Mimiw?

220
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,720
Mimiw?

221
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,520
There.

222
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,800
I’ll place it here.

223
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,800
If you’re hungry, come and eat it.

224
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,120
Can I eat it now?

225
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:16,960
Hm.

226
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,560
Wait! Wait! Wait!

227
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,480
Huh?

228
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,000
Put it down.

229
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,200
Put it down.

230
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,640
Why?

231
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,200
Here.

232
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,000
You have to eat it like this.

233
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,360
How is it?

234
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,800
So delicious!

235
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,720
Of course.

236
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,000
It was my grandma’s recipe.

237
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,040
It was my grandma’s recipe.

238
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,440
Hm..

239
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,400
Can I have another one?

240
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,720
Yes.

241
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,760
But you must finish the one on your plate first.

242
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,400
Ok?

243
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,880
Ok.

244
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,920
Stop! Stop! Wait!

245
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,320
This one is spicy.

246
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,000
Try a small amount first. It's spicy.

247
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,160
Oh.

248
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,880
Small bite.

249
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,920
Hm.

250
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,000
Delicious?

251
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,520
Delicious?

252
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,200
You act like you never have it before.

253
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,400
But I understand.

254
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,920
Your family must be poor right?

255
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,040
Oh, hey.

256
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,000
You aren't looking for a job anymore?

257
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,800
You aren't looking for a job anymore?

258
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,480
I think you should do something that you're capable of.

259
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,280
The job that I'm capable of doing?

260
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,320
Yes.

261
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,640
The one that you're proficient in.

262
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,680
A job that you have done before.

263
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,120
And I have to do it now?

264
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,880
I’m tired of talking to you.

265
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,120
Sigh.

266
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,080
You continue eating.

267
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,560
Keep going.

268
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,080
If I do my job

269
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,760
this meal would be my last meal.

270
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,160
Hm.

271
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,680
But the food is so good.

272
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,040
Hmm..

273
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,520
Hello!

274
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,600
Your coffee, Dim!

275
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,720
I didn't order it.

276
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,600
Please order!

277
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:20,240
If you drink my coffee, you will feel fresh all day!

278
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,320
I don’t want it.

279
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,440
And why is that?

280
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,400
How about..

281
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,920
If you buy it today

282
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:29,480
tomorrow I will deliver the coffee here for free!

283
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,000
This is a new special promotion from the shop that I just thought of right now!

284
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,880
This is a new special promotion from the shop that I just thought of right now!

285
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,040
If you take this coffee

286
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,440
I will give you this promotion.

287
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,520
And if others ask for-

288
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,720
Enough Tan.

289
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,080
I told you. I don't want it.

290
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,440
But every morning, you have me deliver the coffee to you.

291
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,040
Now I don't want it.

292
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,360
How come you don't want it now?

293
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,880
Do you really want to know that?

294
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,440
Yes.

295
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,000
Your coffee

296
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,120
Your coffee

297
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,560
is suck.

298
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,000
And I’m bored of it.

299
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,600
You don’t have to be this harsh.

300
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,640
It is not true!

301
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,480
Chan Dan and others-

302
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,640
They lie!

303
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,720
They buy it

304
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,840
because they pity you.

305
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,600
I don’t want to lie anymore.

306
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,720
After I bought it

307
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,000
I threw it in the trash.

308
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,920
I threw it in the trash.

309
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,000
Therefore, after this

310
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,600
stop delivering it to me.

311
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,560
I do not want it.

312
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,920
You’re right.

313
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,440
You choose a work that you have experience in.

314
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,680
Here.

315
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,560
I cooked it for you.

316
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,920
In case when you feel hungry.

317
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,920
Thank you so much.

318
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,880
Good luck.

319
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,000
I hope you get a job soon.

320
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,560
I hope you get a job soon.

321
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,360
Is the store open?

322
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:05,960
Yes, we’re open.

323
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,560
Please come inside.

324
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,840
Thank you.

325
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,360
You’ re right

326
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,840
You are supposed to do the assigned job.

327
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,440
Hurry up.

328
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,960
So you could go back home.

329
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,760
But.

330
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,880
If you destroy this planet

331
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,040
You won't be able to eat the delicious food anymore.

332
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,760
But if you go back

333
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,480
you will get the food capsules as a bonus.

334
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,960
One hundred thousand capsules!

335
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,400
But you said it yourself that

336
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,840
the capsule tasted bad.

337
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,240
The food here is more delicious.

338
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,640
Isn’t it?

339
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,360
Shut up.

340
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,680
We’re doing a very important mission.

341
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,120
Don’t bet on food.

342
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,920
But we are able to live because of food.

343
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,320
You can eat anything, it is the same!

344
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,000
If don’t hurry up and press the boom

345
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,360
If don’t hurry up and press the boom

346
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,200
your boss will send someone here to capture you.

347
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,640
Like what Kay said.

348
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,800
Remember?

349
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,560
Don’t be a fool.

350
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,280
Hm!

351
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,080
Come on!

352
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,360
I must be responsible!

353
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,600
Then.

354
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,760
Today.

355
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,200
I will have my last meal.

356
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,560
And I will destroy this world.

357
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,680
Hm!

358
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,640
Hm!

359
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,360
Ah!

360
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,760
So cruel!

361
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,760
Hm?

362
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,240
Cruel!

363
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,600
Cruel man!

364
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,200
How could you say that my coffee is suck!

365
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,000
This world isn’t fair!

366
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:51,880
Hey.

367
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,320
Don’t stop me.

368
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,560
Who were you talking to?

369
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,520
Who?

370
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,040
Suck?

371
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,800
Suck?!

372
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,640
No Tan.

373
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,200
You must be positive.

374
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,640
Calm down. Calm down.

375
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,440
Be positive.

376
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,640
Screw positive!

377
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,000
Oh. Um..

378
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,520
Don’t say that just bring it on!

379
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,120
Or you will stop me?!
Hey. Hey.

380
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,000
Calm down.

381
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,320
Please, calm down.

382
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,840
Well.

383
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,280
I will go straight to the point.

384
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,560
What planet do you come from?

385
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,000
What did you say?

386
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,400
What did you say?

387
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,400
What planet do you come from?

388
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:33,800
You.

389
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,120
If it is not delicious, then don't drink it!

390
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,840
Why keep saying it's not delicious!

391
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,880
Fine!

392
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,840
From now on!

393
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,360
Do not drink my coffee! Anymore!

394
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,680
And everyone!

395
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,240
Will miss my coffee!

396
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:45,840
Hmph.

397
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,520
No! No! No!

398
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,880
If it’s suck

399
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,560
I will destroy it!

400
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,160
What?!

401
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:53,560
Wait!

402
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,480
Destroy it?

403
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,360
Yes!

404
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,840
And it will be gone.

405
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,600
Forever!

406
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,440
Hey! Hey!

407
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,760
Wait. Forever?

408
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,000
Hey. Hey!

409
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,600
Hey. Hey!

410
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,080
Your coffee is really good.

411
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,640
What did you say?

412
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,400
Well.

413
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,720
Your coffee

414
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,480
is really good.

415
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,560
Um..

416
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,640
Can I have it?

417
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,800
You seem to like it a lot.

418
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,080
G-Good!

419
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,160
You mean that?

420
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,080
Yes.

421
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,120
Or

422
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,880
you said that out of pity?

423
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,840
Pity?

424
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,640
What does it mean?

425
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,280
Are you stupid or just pretening to be one?

426
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:50,880
Hm?

427
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,440
You said that my coffee was delicious.

428
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,840
You lied right?

429
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,720
Lie?

430
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,600
You mean

431
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,000
not speaking the truth?

432
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,120
not speaking the truth?

433
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,680
See?

434
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,840
You lied.

435
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,520
You didn't speak the truth.

436
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,080
Are you listening to what I’m saying?

437
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,880
No. I meant that I spoke the truth.

438
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,240
You did?

439
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,760
So.

440
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,880
My coffee is not delicious. Do you speak the truth?

441
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:21,880
Of course!

442
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,160
So, what does everything you say mean?

443
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,040
Well.

444
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,000
You said that my coffee wasn't delicious.

445
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,040
You said that my coffee wasn't delicious.

446
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,240
You just pity me.

447
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,880
So you lie to me.

448
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,520
Is that right?

449
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,720
Yes.

450
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,120
What?

451
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,240
The coffee is good.

452
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,280
Then.

453
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,920
Drink it all.

454
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,680
Mm.

455
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,960
Mm..

456
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:05,960
Must be good.

457
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,360
Yes.

458
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,240
Drink it all.

459
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,480
Ah, yes.

460
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,840
It does delicious.

461
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,640
I wish I had more customers like you.

462
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,920
But they must have money.

463
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,760
However

464
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,600
thank you so much.

465
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,160
Oh.

466
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,760
Oh!

467
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,600
Electric shock.

468
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,560
Oh, I’m so sorry.

469
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,880
It's alright.

470
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,720
Well..

471
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,320
You're also very energetic, aren't you?

472
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,200
Hm.

473
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,320
By the way,

474
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,000
what is your relationship with Chan Dan?

475
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,480
what is your relationship with Chan Dan?

476
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,280
Why are you living with him?

477
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,320
Oh.

478
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,320
Are you two..

479
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,600
Boyfriend?

480
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,760
Hm?

481
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:15,960
Boyfriend?

482
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,520
Don’t be shy.

483
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,440
Ah!
Oh!

484
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,600
Oh!
Ouch!

485
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,360
Oh, I’m so sorry.

486
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,400
It's ok.

487
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,080
Your skin must be so dry.

488
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,280
And are you alright?

489
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,440
I’m alright.

490
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,000
I think we better get going.

491
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,640
I think we better get going.

492
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,040
It will rain soon.

493
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,800
Let's go before something happens for real.

494
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,040
Gosh. Is he a man or an electronic pole?

495
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,600
Hey! You!

496
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,720
What is happening to you?

497
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,800
Help! Somebody help!

498
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,880
Hey.

499
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,640
Are you alright?

500
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,800
Where..am I?

501
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,280
At Mars.

502
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,240
Huh?

503
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,640
Hey.

504
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,360
How did I get to Mars?

505
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,240
Hey.

506
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,040
Take me back to earth now.

507
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,000
Hahaha.

508
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,280
Are you out of your mind?

509
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,320
Being funny?

510
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,720
Take a look around.

511
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,800
This is my grandma’s bedroom.

512
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,000
And

513
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,080
And

514
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,800
what happened to you?

515
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,840
Why does your body have an electric shock?

516
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,680
Slow down.

517
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,080
And.

518
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,840
Any"How did I come back here?
"thing I know?

519
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,920
I brought you back.

520
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,160
Hey!

521
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,240
Chun!

522
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,440
Chun!

523
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,120
Ouch!

524
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,000
Tan, what happened?

525
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,480
Tan, what happened?

526
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,720
I don't know either.

527
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,200
We were walking.

528
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,280
And then he just collapsed.

529
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,080
Chun!

530
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,880
Ah!

531
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,920
Ouch!

532
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,640
I think we should go back now.

533
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,000
The rain is coming.

534
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,160
He might get struck by the thunder.

535
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,320
There is an electric shock. How do we get him back home?

536
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,560
Ouch.

537
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,040
Hey!

538
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,680
Chun!

539
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,960
Stay with me ok?

540
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,360
Tan hurry up!

541
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,800
Calm down! He’s heavy!

542
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,480
Ah!

543
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,160
What did he eat?! So heavy.

544
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,360
Stay with me!

545
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,840
Oh, god.

546
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,040
And what happened to you?

547
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,280
Achoo!

548
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,640
Well.

549
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,080
Ok.

550
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,080
I’ll go prepare you a glass of ginger ale.

551
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,000
So, you would feel better.

552
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
So, you would feel better.

553
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,800
Ginger ale?

554
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,360
Yes.

555
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,320
Is it tastes good?

556
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:05,920
Oh.

557
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,120
It's very good.

558
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,560
It's my grandma’s recipe.

559
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,800
And if you have a cold like this

560
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,480
you will definitely feel better.

561
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,280
Achoo!

562
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,960
Here it is.

563
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:42,080
My grandma’s ginger ale.

564
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,600
Oh! Wait! Wait!

565
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,760
Huh?

566
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,360
I think I better place it here.

567
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,680
Hm.

568
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,640
Hm.

569
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,280
Hm..

570
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,840
I feel better now.

571
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,160
Is it good?

572
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,280
Hm.

573
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,720
What?

574
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,240
Cut!

575
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,160
Again.

576
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,480
There are no other jobs on this planet?

577
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,520
Man, I’m sorry.

578
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,000
Damn you.

579
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Damn you.

580
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,880
Gun, Rit, Tono.

581
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,880
Gun was so cool!

582
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,160
Who is he? So damn old-fashioned.

583
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,760
Not this one.

584
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,400
You cannot say this one.

585
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,600
Not this one.

586
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,520
You don’t stay in the character!

587
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,240
You must stay in the character.

588
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,760
So damn old-fashioned.

589
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,480
For the star~

590
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,880
That~

591
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,880
Hey! How did you know how to sing that?

592
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,600
For the star, the dream isn’t far~

593
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,120
Hey!

594
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,120
Huh?

595
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,040
You must not be able to sing it.

596
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,120
I used to watch it.

597
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,000
It was broadcast on my planet.

598
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,080
It was broadcast on my planet.

599
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,600
I cannot see!

600
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,640
Come back! I cannot take it off!

601
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,080
Help me!

602
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,080
They must know it.

603
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,560
Ah, cut.

604
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,040
Go ahead.

605
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,400
Nut, why did you touch it?

606
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,160
Cut.

607
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,440
Slate.

608
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,040
I don’t know where the cat goes.

609
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,000
He’s here.

610
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,240
Please allow me, ok?

611
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,760
Please, let me shake you.

612
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,320
Please, let me shake you gently ok?

613
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,000
Oh! Oh! Oh!

614
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,960
Oh! Oh! Oh!

615
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,440
Let's go home.

616
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,000
Cut.

617
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,400
Hahahaha!

618
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,040
Stay still.

619
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,800
Do you want a bone?

620
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,840
Oh, I forgot. You aren’t a dog.

621
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,640
Why did you say that?

622
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,560
See?

623
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,640
You are like this.

624
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,280
What did you say?

625
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,600
You

626
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,600
can eat the bone.

627
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,000
You. I must look at you in the eyes.

628
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,080
You. I must look at you in the eyes.

629
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,640
And I must say

630
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,240
the keywords damn!

631
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,480
Not a dog!

632
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,440
So do you want a bone?

633
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,600
Yes.

634
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,960
Keep roll, keep roll.

635
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,640
Your line is ‘I have an owner now’

636
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,600
Ah! Damn!

637
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,280
Damn!

638
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,640
You forgot.

639
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,400
I don't eat vegetables. Take it out.

640
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,520
I will spit it out.

641
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,160
But I like vegetables.

642
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,000
You must eat them together.

643
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,760
Here.

644
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,480
Like this.

645
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,520
Oh.

646
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,760
Hahahaha.

647
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,840
It can go wrong sometimes, ok?

648
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,320
I told you.

649
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,760
It-
