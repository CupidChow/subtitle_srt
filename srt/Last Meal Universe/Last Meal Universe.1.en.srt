Everything is good?

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,480
Thank you so much.

You're welcome.

7
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,240
Dim!

8
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,880

Come. Hurry.

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,040
Here.

15
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,400
Let's go.

16
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,400
I'll take my leave now.

17
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:39,880

00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,800

Hey! Hey!

21
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000

22
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,800
Um.

23
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,800
I arrived, Sir.

24
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,160
Please report the progress.

25
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,600
It's kidda cold

26
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,600
and stuck.

27
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,600
What?

28
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,240
Oh, I mean

29
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,280
Um.

30
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,480
the signal is quite stuck,

31
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,240
However,

32
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,000
the people here

33
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,880
the people here

34
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,880
seem to live their lives normally.

35
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,000
Copy that

36
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,040
How about over there?

37
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,400
How is it?

38
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,760
Aww..

39
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,920
Oh.

40
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,440
It's almost time.

41
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,720
But how do I get down from here.

42
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,800
But how do I get down from here.

43
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,880
What are you doing?

44
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,600
Shh!

45
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,560
Shh!

46
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,000
human.

47
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,800
No

48
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:39,920
W-wait.

49
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,080
Human!

50
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:42,960
Hey!

51
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,720
Help me.

52
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,440
W-hey!

53
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,120
Oh, oh.

54
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,640
How do I get down?

55
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,000
If not, 

56
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,040
If not, 

57
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,480
then this way.

58
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,600
1

59
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,440
2

60
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:15,920
3

61
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,640
Aaaahhh!

62
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,200
Ugh!

63
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,080
Ugh!

64
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,800
Ugh!

65
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,920
Ugh!

66
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,280
God!

67
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,320
Why the gravity is so strong here!

68
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,040
Ugh!

69
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,680
Ugh!

70
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,040
What should I do now?

71
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,200
That's is important.

72
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,560
Oh come on!

73
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,280
Huh?!

74
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Huh?!

75
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,200
Seriously?! How unlucky can I get?!

76
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,000
So boring.                                                          

77
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,800
So boring.                                                          

78
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,040
Would this planet have something delicious to eat?

79
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,480
I know that you're hungry.

80
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,680
Damn human kid!

81
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,000
You're gonna die soon, 

82
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,400
You're gonna die soon, 

83
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,480
and you have no idea.

84
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,120
Sh*t

85
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,600
Let's go home little one.

86
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,520
Ahh!

87
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,280
What’s wrong with you?

88
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:45,880
And

89
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,160
who are you?

90
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,640
Why are you drinking my coffee?

91
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,600
Cofy?

92
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,600
Coffee.

93
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,200
Oh, coffee.

94
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,800
Yes, coffee.

95
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,400
but

96
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,480
Coffee?

97
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,560
what's coffee?

98
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,440
Are you seriously?

99
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,960
That's my coffee.

100
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,240
This is your coffee?

101
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,000
Yes

102
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,760
I see

103
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,000
Your coffee

104
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,760
tastes good

105
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,440
Seriously?

106
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,120
And who are you?

107
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,760
Why did you drink my coffee?

108
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:25,560
Hm?

109
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,440
Oh! You live here?!

110
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,440
Are you crazy?

111
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,040
Are you crazy?

112
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,720
This is my barber shop.

113
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,920
Do you want a haircut?

114
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,000
No.

115
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,800
I'm not talking to you.

116
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,960
I'm talking to him!

117
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,080
He must be crazy.

118
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,640
Now give me 60 baht.

119
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,640
It's for my coffee.

120
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,000
What?

121
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,120
60

122
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,800
60?

123
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,080
Umm

124
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,680
What 60?

125
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,520
I um..

126
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,240
I think I should go.

127
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:07,920
See you later.

128
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,240
Thank you for coming.

129
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,600
Thank you as well.
Good bye.

130
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,040
Goodbye Mimiw.
Come let's go, Mimiw.

131
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,160
Do not touch!

132
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,320
Mimiw will smack you to death!

133
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,280
I warned you.

134
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,640
You cazy man.

135
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,520
Now where's my 60 baht.

136
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,200
For my coffee.

137
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,360
What?

138
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,760
60 baht.

139
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,440
60 baht.

140
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,920
60?

141
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,120
Hey!

142
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,040
Gosh!

143
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,480
Why this planet is so chaotic?

144
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,640
Whatever.

145
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,400
It will be destroyed soon.

146
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,360
Oh!

147
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,440
You!

148
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,360
Have you been living on this planet for a long time?

149
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,640
Well of course.

150
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,360
You're silly.

151
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,040
Oh!

152
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,920
Then!

153
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,000
You came from the planet Mau?

154
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,480
Correct!

155
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,160
And what about you?

156
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,080
What are you doing here?

157
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,320
Or?

158
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,680
Or?

159
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,960
Or?

160
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,240
Or?

161
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,000
Or?

162
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,920
Or?

163
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,320
Or you

164
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,840
came here to spend your retired life?

165
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,200
Retirement?

166
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,080
Hey!

167
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,960
Look!

168
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,240
Take a look at me!

169
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,640
My face 

170
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,360
is still handsome not old.

171
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,360
Old?!

172
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,080
Say it again and I will scratch your lips!

173
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,040
How could you say that!

174
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,600
I'm not old!

175
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,000
O-okay.

176
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,880
O-okay.

177
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,040
My apologies.

178
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,440
So,

179
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,960

180
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,360
came to spend your retired life here?

181
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,280
Yeah.

182
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,960
Chilling.

183
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,920
So are you going to tell me?

184
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,040
Why

185
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,240
are you here?

186
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,480
Um..

187
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,880
Well..

188
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,760

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,480

193
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,440

Whoa, calm down.

Mimiw!

195
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,800
Where are you going?

196
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,600
No so fast!

197
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,600
Come here. The uncle will scold you!

198
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,960
Let's go get you some milk

199
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,400
and some treats.

200
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,160
Who's this guy?

201
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,280
Was he going to eat you?

202
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,440
Hurry. Let's go!

203
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,880
Why are you so cute!

204
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,720
Chondan Kitchen

205
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,640
Grandma.

206
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,280
Please bless me with a lot of customers today.

207
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,320
Sh*t

208
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,720
Hello.

209
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,640
Dear customer.

210
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,120
Hi.

211
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,200
Um. 

212
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,720
These things.

213
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,120
What are these?

214
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,440
which one?

215
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,480
These.

216
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,520
There're foods.

217
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,040
Foods.

218
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,000
Foods?

219
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,120
Foods?

220
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,400
But they look strange.

221
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,640
Are they eatable?

222
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,560
Of course.

223
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,600
All the food at Chondan Kitchen 

224
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,560
is delicious!

225
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,240
Are you here to eat, sir

226
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,680
Would you like to dine in or take away in a box?

227
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,840
Box?

228
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,400
Could I get it in a capsule please?

229
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,760
Oh you’re

230
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,400
funny.

231
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,760
Dress formally and quite funny.

232
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,800
How about this one?

233
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,480
I’ll get them for you.

234
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,800
Ok, I still have some time left.

235
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,280
If this amount of rice enough?

236
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,320
I don't think so.

237
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,280
I can see it from your body shape.

238
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,400
I will add more for you.

239
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,440
Yeah, more.

240
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,000
For new customer.

241
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,080
Which curries do you want on top of the rice?

242
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,080
On top?

243
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:53,920
On top?

244
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,280
The curries which one do you want with the rice.

245
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,000
This must be the food of this planet.

246
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,280
This must be the food of this planet.

247
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,800
Well.

248
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,880
I would like to get all of them.

249
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,680
You.

250
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,520
Are you here for the meal or pranking me? 

251
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,320
What? Why not?

252
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,360
I'm hungry.

253
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,560
I want to eat all of them.

254
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,840
You can’t eat all of that.

255
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,680
If you don’t finish your food here, 

256
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,720
you’ll have to pay extra.

257
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,600
Let's have each of them first.

258
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,960
I've never seen him around here.

259
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,160
Then.

260
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,880
In that case, I’ll serve you.

261
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,000
Go ahead and take a seat.

262
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,280
Go ahead and take a seat.

263
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,760
okay

264
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,120
That way!

265
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,280
Sit over there.

266
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,240
Oh.

267
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,320
Got it

268
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,920
What's wrong with him?

269
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,680
Wearing only one shoe.

270
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,160
Crazy?

271
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,960
Here's your foods.

272
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,360
Fried Boiled Egg with Tamarind Sauce.

273
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,920
And Coconut Milk Dipping with fresh veggies.

274
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,480
Sweet and mellow.

275
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,800
Enjoy your meal!

276
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,560
Just kidding.

277
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,680
Enjoy your meal.

278
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,640
Oh and

279
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,280
There is a bucket of roselle juice.

280
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,480
There is a bucket of roselle juice.

281
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,880
Feel free to help yourself.

282
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,720
Oh, yes.

283
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,240
So delicious!

284
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,240
This!

285
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,440
The most delicious food in the universe.

286
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,360
Sir! Sir!

287
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,960
Are you alright?

288
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,720
Sir.
Oh!

289
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,800
Slow down.

290
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,000
Your foods!

291
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,200
Your foods!

292
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,160
So delicious!

293
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,200
So delicious! 

294
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,600
Your foods are so delicious!

295
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,480
You.

296
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,320
Are you ok?

297
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,240
I've never eaten anything

298
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,920
this delicious before!

299
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,840
It's that delicious?

300
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,120
I'm so hungry, 

301
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:57,960
Hm..

302
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,000
Have as much as you want!

303
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,080
Have as much as you want!

304
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,760
I'm here!

305
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,640
What would like to have?

306
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,120
Um.. This one. This one and this one.

307
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,600
Only side dishes?

308
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,360
And 4 plates of rice please.

309
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,360
4 plates of rice.

310
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,120
Alright.

311
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,960
Please have a seat and wait for a few minutes.

312
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,440
I ordered.

313
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,840
You You

314
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,040
Can I get more?

315
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,400
Huh?
More!

316
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,920
You aren't full yet?!

317
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,960
Are you sure that you're ok?

318
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,560
More!

319
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,000
Ok. Ok. Go back to your seat.

320
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,960
Ok. Ok. Go back to your seat.

321
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,560
I will get another one for you.

322
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,280
Why is he this starving?

323
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,880
Oh my god!

324
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,040
Looks so good!

325
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,240
Here.

326
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,600
Slow down, ok?

327
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,520
Mmm! This one is so delicious!

328
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,640
This one also!

329
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,960
Why the foods here are so good!

330
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,680
Hm..

331
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,560
I should sneak it back to my planet!

332
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,280
Gosh!

333
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,400
What is this juice?

334
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,280
This one also good!

335
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,000
Sweet first and then sour.

336
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,160
Sweet first and then sour.

337
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,960
And it has faint aroma too.

338
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,640
Hey! You!

339
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,240
Stop it!

340
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,520
Use the glass!

341
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,040
Drinking like this is impolite!

342
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,360
And you.

343
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,800
why wearing only one shoe?

344
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:27,960
Oh no!

345
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,720
I told you to stop!

346
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,800
Mmm. Sweet.

347
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,880
What sweet.

348
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,160
This is roselle.

349
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,520
Yes!
Put it back down.

350
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,160
If you drink like this,

351
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,840
how can others drink it? 

352
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,280
Use the glass.

353
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:47,720
Bro.

354
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,280
Today I want to eat

355
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,640
this one, this one

356
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,200
and fried egg.

357
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,920
Ok. Just a minute.

358
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,960
Hey!

359
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,040
Hm?

360
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:03,680
Your friend?

361
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,840
No.

362
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,800
A moment ago

363
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,360
he stole my coffee.

364
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,520
Is..

365
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,400
Is he here

366
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,920
to have a meal?

367
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,680
Be careful.

368
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,680
Or he must be..

369
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,680
Oh! Excuse me.

370
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,760
right on time.

371
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,560
I have to go.

372
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,280
Go where?

373
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,240
Yeah where?

374
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,000
Oh, you guys.

375
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,000
Prepare to die.

376
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,640
Prepare to die.

377
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,880
What?

378
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,840
Your damn mouth

379
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,400
Wait!!

380
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,080
Dim, take care of my shop!

381
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,720
You!

382
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,800
But my foods?

383
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,200
Help yourself!

384
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,200
Take care of my shop!

385
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,240
You!
Ah. Yes.

386
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,440
Why this planet is so chaotic!

I'm waiting...

for the exact time.

391
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,760
Copy that.

392
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,640
What should I do?

393
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,280
Soon, this planet will be destroyed.

394
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,080
You! 

395
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,760
You!

396
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,600
You! You

397
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,720
Oh..

398
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,000
You forgot your belonging.

399
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,360
You forgot your belonging.

400
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,720
Hey! That's my tissue box!

401
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,600
No! Don't touch it!

402
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,360
Don't touch it!

403
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,840
Be gentle!

404
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,760
No! Don't touch it!

405
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,880
What do you want me to do?

406
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,400
Whatever.

407
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,280
Just please step back as far as you can.

408
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,160
Step back to where?

409
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,600
Pay for the food first.

410
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,680
Don't tell me.

411
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,600
that you won’t pay?

412
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,960
And you steal my tissue box!

413
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,480
What a day.

414
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,960
What day is it?

415
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,480
It’s the day that the earth will be destroyed.

416
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,320
What?

417
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,000
Oh no!

418
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,680
Oh no!

419
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,120
Nothing.

420
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,200
Hey you!

421
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,080
Do not touch!

422
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,000
Inside that suitcase,

423
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,800
there’s a boom!

424
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,560
A boom?

425
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,480
Yes!

426
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,840
Oh my god!

427
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,120
Everyone!

428
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,840
Be careful!

429
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,760
There’s a boom here!

430
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,680
Are you crazy?

431
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,560
Do you think I’m stupid?

432
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,360
Gosh.

433
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,800
Stupid again.

434
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,080
How could this tiny suitcase have a boom? 

435
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,560
Now pay for the food.

436
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,280
Hurry!

437
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,320
Please report the progress.

438
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,800
Yes sir,

439
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,760
Yes, please wait for a few minutes.

440
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,840
I’m going to do it soon.

441
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,240
Yes.

442
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,760
Copy that.

443
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,200
Please wait for a few minutes.

444
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,360
Who are you even talking to?

445
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:14,920
Huh?

446
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,200
You must be really crazy.

447
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:16,880
Hey.

448
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,800
If you don't pay me,

449
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,720
I‘ll see what's inside.

450
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,600
No! No! No!

451
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,320
Please don't do that.

452
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,320
Ok. How about this?

453
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,480
How about you

454
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,720
hand me back my suitcase?

455
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,680
And I will give me.

456
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,560
What?

457
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,000
Yes.

458
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,360
Yes.

459
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,200
I give me.

460
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,800
You mean give you?

461
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,280
Ah. Yes, give you.

462
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,800
And tell me what you want?

463
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,120
I want money.

464
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,880
You ate my foods. And you haven’t paid.

465
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,520
Yes.

466
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,280
Money.

467
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,360
Yes. Money.

468
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,640
Huh?

469
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,240
Are you sure that you have money?

470
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,640
Um. Yes.

471
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,280
But can you wait until 

472
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,480
I complete my mission first?

473
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,320
What mission?

474
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,000
What do you mean?

475
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,240
What do you mean?

476
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,920
Ah.

477
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,760
I see.

478
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,760
So you're looking for a job?

479
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,200
Ok then.

480
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,960
You don't have to pay.

481
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,320
You can pay me when you have it.

482
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,680
But if you don’t,

483
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,920
you can come to eat at my shop.

484
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,240
Because in my shop  

485
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,720
pregnant women 

486
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,480
elders 

487
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,520
children 

488
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,000
and crazy people 

489
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,680
can eat for free.

490
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,600
Thank you so much.

491
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,960
Sir.

492
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,640
Could you help me with one more thing?

493
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,280
Help what?

494
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,960
How did it even get stuck up there? 

495
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,560
I floated down.

496
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,000
And it just stuck there.

497
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,960
And it just stuck there.

498
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,880
Really?

499
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,960
Um.

500
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,760
Who the hell is he?

501
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,400
Thank you.

502
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,840
Hmm.

503
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,720
You better thanks him.

504
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,960
Thank you so much.

505
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,000
Farewell.

506
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,720
Farewell.

507
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,560
His name must be David.

508
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,040
Copperfield.

509
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,040
Floating down

510
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,320
The signal is successfully connected to the sun.

511
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,680
can be initiated.

512
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,160
Please specify employee code

513
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,240
of The Space Special Authority

514
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,240
Employee code. 2225

515
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,240
I couldn't hear the signal. 

516
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,000
Could you please say it again?

517
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,680
Could you please say it again?

518
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,080
22

519
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,760
25

520
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,520
I think the signal is getting weak.

521
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,960
Give us some time to reset the signal again.

522
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,120
Ah-

523
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,720
The line was cut off.

524
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,720
It's so unfair.

525
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,760
This planet has a lot of delicious food.

526
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,120
Why would they want to destroy it? 

527
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,440
But.

528
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,920
If I destroyed this planet

529
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,400
I will have to eat the food capsule again.

530
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,000
Ah no.

531
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,680
I don't even want to think about it.

532
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,640
Alright!

533
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,960
I

534
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,760
will not 

535
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,840
go back to eat his food 

536
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,320
ever again

537
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,320
Please enter the security code.

538
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,960
Roselle!

539
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,000
What?

540
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,480
What?

541
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,760
What code again?

542
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,480
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

543
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,240
Please enter the security code again.

544
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,080
"Mute signal" 

545
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,440
Come on!

546
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,920
Chun!

547
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,560
You can’t prioritize food over a mission!

548
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,000
Accomplishing a mission is the most important!

549
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,640
Let’s do it.

550
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,120
The security code

551
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,480
is

552
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,840
22

553
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,800
25

554
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,000
Copy that.

555
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,920
Copy that.

556
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,160
We will start the countdown

557
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,040
to destroy the current planet.

558
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,200
Pressing the star bomb

559
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:05,960
will happen.

560
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,920
Please press the button after hearing the beep.

561
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,720
Begin.

562
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,560
9

563
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,640
8

564
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,800
7

565
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,000
6

566
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,160
5

567
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,640
4

568
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,160
3

569
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,080
2

570
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,360
Hey.

571
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,960
You seemed to like it.

572
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,000
So I brought a roselle juice for you.

573
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,560
So I brought a roselle juice for you.

574
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,000
Only one bottle left.

575
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,360
Well.

576
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,800
Keep going.

577
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,920
You can do it.

578
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,880
Overact this much, really?

579
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,840
Oh.

580
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,880
I thought that was a commercial shoot.

581
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,040
So good.

582
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:53,920
No!

583
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,480
My ice cream fell!

584
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,000
Oh!

585
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
This kid again.

586
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,400
This kid again.

587
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,880
Are alright dear?

588
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,200
Are you ok?

589
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,080
I’m so sorry. 

590
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,160
I’m so sorry.

591
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,680
My daughter is naughty.

592
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,200
No problem.

593
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,800
Say sorry to him now.

594
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,640
I’m sorry.

595
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,560
That’s alright.

596
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,600
Are you hurt dear?

597
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,840
Any pain?

598
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,520
Oh, no no.

599
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,840
I will buy a new one for you.

600
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,160
Ahh

601
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,040
Okay

602
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,480
Here.

603
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,640
Next time, don't ask for free ice cream again.

604
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,240
Because it’s for selling.

605
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,200
Understand?

606
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,760
And you.

607
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,640
This ice cream

608
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,280
it's my treat

609
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,040
as an apology.

610
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:57,840
Thanks.

611
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,080
What?

612
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,360
treat?

613
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,600
Treating again

614
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,200
What's wrong with this planet?

615
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,400
Wow

616
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,440
So delicious!

617
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,520
I finished it already.

618
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,600
I was enjoying it!

619
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,080
What are you waiting for?

620
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,000
Why aren’t you hurrying up with your duty?

621
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,160
Why aren’t you hurrying up with your duty?

622
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,200
Do you know

623
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,040
that now

624
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,640
our planet is in chaos now.

625
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,200
Because you didn't follow your order.

626
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,400
I..

627
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,160
I apologize.

628
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,320
I apologize.

629
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,040
It's um..

630
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:09,440
I..

631
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:09,720
It’s

632
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,560
i will

633
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,040
I mean..

634
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,080
What happened?

635
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:12,880
I mean..

636
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,760
The distance in kilomile of the expressway

637
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,760
has been miscalculated.

638
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,560
If we blow up the earth now

639
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,240
it may

640
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,880
affect our planet.

641
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,920
Are you certain?

642
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,480
Then.

643
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,280
Make us a report urgently.

644
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,040
I’ll discuss it in the assembly.

645
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:28,400
Uhh... 

646
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:28,920
yeah, sure, 

647
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,000
I‘ll hurry and send you a summary report.

648
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,720
I‘ll hurry and send you a summary report.

649
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,160
But if we could destroy it

650
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,600
you must report us immediately.

651
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,240
You must strictly follow the instructions.

652
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,800
Understand?

653
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,840
Yes, Sir.

654
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,160
The Beauty’s coffee is here.

655
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,480
The pretty lady

656
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,920
for the delivery.

657
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,960
Thank you.

658
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,200
Oh

659
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,800
No food left?

660
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,800
I haven’t eaten yet.

661
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,600
There are some left.

662
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,800
Do you want to have them?

663
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,160
Yes! Yes!

664
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,920
Your cooking 

665
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,640
is the best around here.

666
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,840
Do you know that?

667
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,920
Always praise me too much.

668
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,800
Not too much!

669
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,160
It is true!

670
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,840
I guess so.

671
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,840
It’s the only shop in this area.

672
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,560
Hehe.

673
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,560
It is.

674
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,000
Too much rice?

675
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,280
Should I take some off?

676
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,440
No. More, please.

677
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,560
That's enough.

678
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,400
This is more than enough.

679
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,200
Then I would be to have this one too.

680
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,560
Chicken Massaman Curry?

681
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,800
I’m serious!

682
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,400

683
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,920

684
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,440

685
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,040
So delicious!

686
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,360
your food is amazing!

687
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,040
OMG

690
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,080

00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,320
Yes, please!

692
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,400
Omelet too?

693
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,680
Omelet too.

694
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,360
Fine.

695
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,560
So small

696
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,400
but eat a lot.

697
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,160
Take it

698
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,040
You don’t have to pay

699
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,520
Really?

700
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,600
Oh my. You are

701
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,040

00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,040
It’s for the coffee

704
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:50,800

00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,240
I will take it home.

706
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,560
I will take a spoon and fork.

707
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,000
Hey! I have a box for away.

708
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,080
Hey! I have a box for away.

709
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:01,680
It's ok.

710
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,520
I’m eco-friendly!

711
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,360

Eat it yourself.

723
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,520
So boring.

724
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,840
Eating only dry food.

725
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,480
I want to eat salmon!

726
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,080

740
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,200

Ok.

746
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,920
Be careful, uncle.

747
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,520
What?

748
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,720
Be careful

749
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,600
Of what?

750
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,720
Of my shoes.

751
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,200
It will get dirty.

752
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,840
Ahh!

753
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,680
You scare me!

754
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,360
Why are you shocked, Boss?

755
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,560
I just came to say hi!

756
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,000
Wow, you’re really full.

757
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,120
Wow, you’re really full.

758
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,800
Why are you here?

759
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,880
What do you mean?

760
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,040
This is my house.

761
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,320
Wait! 

762
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,440
Where are you going?

763
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,600
What?

764
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,440
Where are you going?

765
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,760
I got a news.

766
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,240
What news.

767
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,160
Someone from space came here again, right?

768
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,280
How did you know?

769
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,320
This area is my territory, Boss.

770
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,360
I have to know who comes and goes.

771
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,640
But in your thoughts.

772
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,000
Do you think it was the engineer 

773
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,160
Do you think it was the engineer 

774
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,440
that came here to... 

775
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,160
wipe out-

776
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,760
Shhh!

777
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,760
Gosh!

778
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,960
You scared me!

779
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,160
I won’t talk ok?

780
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,320
How about this?

781
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,240
I

782
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,320
I'll keep an eye on the situation around here.

783
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,920
But you!

784
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,240
If you happen to pass by again

785
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,760
don't forget to bring me food!

786
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,120
I’ve eaten only trash!

787
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,240
They’re all rotten!

788
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,120
And stinky!

789
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,000
Very stinky.

790
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,880
Very stinky.

791
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,680
The trash?

792
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,880
You!

793
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:33,880
Yes!

794
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,520
Go!

795
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,480
Go with you?

796
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,680
Go away from me!

797
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,520
As we all know

798
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,920
on Earth 

799
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,160
there are no Atlanteans left.

800
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,800
Because 

801
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,880
they

802
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:52,320
have made a contract to sell Earth

803
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,240
to the Space Expressway Organization. 

804
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:59,320
Later on, we have been planning for a long time.

805
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,000
And we agree that

806
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,560
And we agree that

807
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,480
the areas on Earth

808
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,320
are suitable for building roads.

809
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,160
And make it the space expressway.

810
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,720
Hold on for a second.

811
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,040
And

812
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,240
Don't we need to inform the humans on Earth first?

813
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,440
No need.

814
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,320
They must have know already 

815
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,880
that one day

816
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,160
Is that so?

817
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,480
It wasn't our duty.

818
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,360
But it was the duty of the Atlanteans.

819
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,360
Yet they were selfish

820
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,240
and migrated to another planet.

821
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,000
Leaving the unfortunate humans 

822
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:30,960
Leaving the unfortunate humans 

823
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,560
to live

824
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,840
without knowing 

825
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,920
when will be the end of the world.

826
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,240
It can’t be help.

827
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,720
But this isn't fair.

828
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,080
Officer Chun!

829
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,880
This isn't about fairness!

830
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,640
It's about duty!

831
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,840
You must accomplish this mission.

832
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,480
No matter how you keep saying that

833
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,040
this world

834
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:56,120
or the whole universe is not being fair to you.

835
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,400
No one will ever listen.

836
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,800
I don’t agree with that.

837
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,280
No matter what, we should inform them first.

838
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:09,200
We are assigning you this mission.

839
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,240
If you can complete it

840
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:16,040
I'll consider a promotion for you.

841
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,280
And

842
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,960
How about 

843
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,040
100,000 food capsules?

844
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,160
Mmm-hmm.

845
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:30,000
Really?

846
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,200
Really?

847
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,640
Of course.

848
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,160
So, 

849
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,000
it’s a deal.

850
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:44,480
Um

851
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:45,400
Deal

852
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:48,480
Deal

853
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,360
The meeting resolution is concluded.

854
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,080
Close the meeting.

855
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,320
I’m hungry again.

856
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,920
Is this the gravity of this planet?

857
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,240
I haven’t done anything 

858
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:14,720
and I feel hungry again.

859
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,760
Look!

860
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,720
When you're in a space

861
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:27,680
you don’t use the energy

862
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,000
like it does on Earth.

863
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:30,240
like it does on Earth.

864
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:31,720
Mr.Cat

865
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,240
How did you get here?

866
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,440
Welcome to the City of Freedom!

867
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,280
I can go anywhere, I want.

868
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:40,720
And will you

869
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:41,960
give me an answer

870
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,000
that why are you here?

871
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,800
Why did you come to earth? 

872
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,120
Um..

873
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:48,880
I

874
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,760
came

875
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,560
To blow up the earth right?

876
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,240
Hmm.

877
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,760
By the way.

878
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Do you think the food here is delicious?

879
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,080
Do you think the food here is delicious?

880
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:02,080
I eat it recently.

881
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,440
And have you ever tried it?

882
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,000
Well....

883
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,680
I have tries yes.

884
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,880
Well I like it a lot.

885
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:10,800
I just had them.

886
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:11,680
At first.

887
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,080
After I ate, I felt that

888
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,280
the taste of the food made me mouth-watering.

889
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,240
And it was so delicious.

890
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,040
I feel like I want to eat all the time.

891
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:17,840
What should I do?

892
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,400
If I destroy this planet 

893
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:19,960
then

894
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:20,760
I won’t be able to eat it again.

895
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,400
It is that serious?

896
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:24,280
I don't know.

897
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,160
When a human gives me something to eat

898
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,480
I just eat it.

899
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,920
For example, at the house where I live 

900
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,000
the owner feed me well.

901
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,280
the owner feed me well.

902
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,360
Feed?

903
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,840
Feed likes

904
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,080
giving you food?

905
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,320
Yes.

906
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:42,800
Oh. Really?

907
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,720
I’ve never known that before.

908
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:51,960
On this planet earth.

909
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,040
There are so many things 

910
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,720
that you

911
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,280
don’t know about it.

912
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,960
Mr.Cat

913
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,560
Report the progress.

914
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,360
Um.

915
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,400
Report the progress.

916
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,200
What should I do?

917
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,080
Or

918
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,720
should I just press the button?

919
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,000
And go back to my planet.

920
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:00,000
If you can complete this mission

921
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:00,080
If you can complete this mission

922
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:02,200
I’ll consider a promotion for you.

923
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,440
and

924
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,240
How about 

925
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,120
100,000 food capsules?

926
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,800
Come on!

927
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,680
Just an easy job!

928
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,600
Here it comes!

929
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,880
Here we go!

930
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,920
I’ll press it.

931
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,520
I’ll really press it!

932
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:50,080
I’m going to press it!

933
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:56,960
I’m going to!

934
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,840
My finger almost hit the button!
