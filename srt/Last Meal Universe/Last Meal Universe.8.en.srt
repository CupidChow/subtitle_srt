1
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,640
Can you speak louder?

2
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,200
I can’t hear you.

3
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,000
What did you say?

4
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,280
What did I can’t hear you. say?

5
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,400
Say it again.

6
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,880
I can’t hear you.

7
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,200
You. You!

8
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,680
Can you stop playing?

9
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,800
What did you say?

10
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,280
Damn it!

11
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,200
I told you to run away!

12
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,280
The police!

13
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,600
The Space Policemen are going after you!

14
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,000
Huh?

15
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,440
Huh?

16
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,640
Police?

17
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,320
Yes!

18
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,720
The space policemen!

19
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:20,880
Holy shit.

20
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,840
Oh my god.

21
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,840
Holy-

22
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,480
Police?

23
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,280
Municipal police?!

24
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,000
Hurry! Run!

25
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,400
Hurry! Run!

26
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:30,920
Run! Run!

27
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,760
Sis let's go!

28
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,280
Gosh!

29
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,960
I did't do that.

30
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,320
Officer 2225! Stop!

31
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,200
You must come with us now!

32
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,600
Wait! Wait! Wait!

33
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,200
You're misunderstanding!

34
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,920
Stop running if you're innocent!

35
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,520
Come back!

36
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,720
Where the hell did he go?

37
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,080
FII to satellite.

38
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,880
Request the location of Officer 2225.

39
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,880
The signal

40
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,040
is bad.

41
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,200
May I 

42
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:10,920
find his location?

43
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,280
And I’ll contact you.

44
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,040
What should I do?

45
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,760
That's all I can help Chun.

46
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,640
Damn it. The signal is gone.

47
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,800
Spread out and find him.

48
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,320
If you find him, report it to me.

49
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,440
Yes sir!

50
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,480
Or is it that way?

51
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,000
Sigh.

52
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:45,760
What are you doing??

53
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,440
Whoa! God!

54
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,160
Hey!

55
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:47,880
What?!

56
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,840
You scared me!

57
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,960
Running away from them?

58
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,160
Yes.

59
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,880
What are you doing here?

60
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,640
That's my question!

61
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,760
This is my secret base.

62
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,200
Why are you here?

63
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,320
You can’t run away.

64
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,240
In the end, you have to go.

65
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,720
You aren't the first one

66
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,360
who falls into a situation like this.

67
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,040
Hmm?

68
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,280
Hey. You.

69
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,320
You won't give me some food?

70
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,840
Oh. Oh. What do we have here?

71
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,080
Ahhh!

72
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,600
I’m sorry!

73
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,680
I’m sorry! I’m sorry!

74
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,760
Tan!

75
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,760
What the hell are you doing?

76
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,960
I ran away from the Municipal police!

77
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,360
I’m so sorry!

78
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,000
Dim let me go!

79
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Dim let me go!

80
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,240
What are you playing?

81
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,640
I’m not playing anything.

82
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,160
I really ran away from them!

83
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,560
What kind of policemen?

84
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,280
They carry glowing guns!

85
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:10,680
Nonsense.

86
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,840
No nonsense. It's true!

87
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,160
Why are you always scolding me? 

88
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,560
Tan.

89
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,880
I’m tired of talking to you.

90
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,720
Me either!

91
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,200
You’re a strange man!

92
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,320
Keep saying that my coffee is suck!

93
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:26,880
Cone on, Tan.

94
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,040
Why are we talking about this again? 

95
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,640
Well!

96
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,000
It's true.

97
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,880
It's true.

98
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,880
Can’t you try to make me feel better?

99
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,720
Sigh.

100
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,560
You can just pretend that my coffee is good

101
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,120
or that you like it.

102
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,800
That will make me happy.

103
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,880
Try making other people feel good

104
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,640
rather than being self-centered.

105
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,080
Are you done talking?

106
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,000
Dim.

107
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,280
Dim.

108
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,520
I hate you.

109
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,160
The world doesn't revolve around you.

110
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,280
Sigh.

111
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,880
Cape!

112
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,000
Cape. Come on. Answer me.

113
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,040
Cape.

114
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,960
Cape.

115
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,200
Cape! They're here!

116
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,880
Damn it Cape!

117
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,880
Huh. Gosh.

118
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,680
Whoa! Whoa! I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

119
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,280
Are you alright?

120
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,800
Umm…

121
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,760
Please, don't be afraid.

122
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,120
I'm a police. Calm down please.

123
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,800
Police?

124
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,160
Yes.
Oh I…

125
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,000
Officer I just ran away from the police!

126
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,520
Officer I just ran away from the police!

127
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,160
Wait a second.

128
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:02,960
What?

129
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,160
I umm…

130
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,600
I umm…

131
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,080
Officer!

132
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,680
I just ran away from the police!

133
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,440
Officer over there!

134
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,520
Those officers!

135
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,680
Hey! You!
Sir, you alright

136
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,800
Hey, are you ok?

137
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,240
Please be careful.

138
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,080
Are you ok?

139
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,600
Sigh.

140
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,280
Captain.

141
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,000
From our data base

142
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,160
From our data base

143
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,840
I can't find any information about them.

144
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,440
I think they’re fake policemen.

145
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,920
We haven’t found any identification data about you.

146
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,280
Including these guns.

147
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,280
Officer.

148
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,800
I think that makes sense.

149
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,080
Look at their uniforms.

150
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,400
What kind of police dress like this?

151
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,680
But you mean this guy as well?

152
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,360
Yes.

153
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,880
Officer.

154
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,600
Umm… But I can identify myself.

155
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,680
Oh.

156
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,080
Here.

157
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,560
Officer.

158
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,000
I am a space operator.

159
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,360
Uh, I come from outer space.

160
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,080
Are you kidding me?

161
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,280
We are policemen from outer space!

162
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,680
Come to arrest him for investigation.

163
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,120
I’m doing my duty here!

164
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,680
Why would you try to capture me? 

165
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,320
You refuse to destroy the world!

166
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,480
That's why we are here!

167
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,040
I’m doing it now!

168
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,200
We don't believe you!

169
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,800
We got a report that you intentionally-

170
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,320
Enough!

171
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,520
Everyone enough!

172
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:29,880
Honey.

173
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,000
Stop it ok?

174
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,240
Stop it ok?

175
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,760
Now I believe you

176
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,640
that you aren't crazy.

177
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,560
Please.

178
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,920
I believe you.

179
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,920
Next time, please take good care of him.

180
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,720
Next time, please take good care of him.

181
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,200
Or 

182
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,000
put your contact on the card.

183
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,240
put your contact on the card.

184
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,200
You, Officer.

185
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,520
I’m so sorry.

186
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,360
My boyfriend has been sick for a long time.

187
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,680
So I have to play along.

188
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,000
I’m sorry for the inconvenience.

189
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,240
Come. Let's go home.

190
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,480
Hey! Wait! Wait!

191
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,960
We are not crazy.

192
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,760
You can't accuse us like that!

193
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,680
Whatever.

194
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:25,840
Fake policemen.

195
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,760
I mean- So who are you guys?

196
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,000
I told you. We are police

197
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,520
I told you. We are police

198
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,040
from the outer space.

199
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:32,840
Yes.

200
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,400
Our captain of DSAI sends us to capture him.

201
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,600
Because we found out that

202
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,560
he neglected his duty of destroying the world.

203
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,640
No. I’m-

204
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,680
Hey! What the hell?!

205
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,480
Hey you!

206
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,320
Please, calm down.

207
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,720
How about…

208
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,720
Have you guys eaten?

209
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,000
Come on, Officer.

210
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,440
I promise that

211
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,000
I’ll let him go with you.

212
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,040
But

213
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,560
I’d like you to try out my food first.

214
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,800
Oh and…

215
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,280
Where’s another Officer?

216
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,840
He was out to find the Captain.

217
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,200
Oh.

218
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,120
What captain?

219
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,160
Please eat.

220
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,680
I won’t charge you money.

221
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:24,840
Money?

222
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,400
What is money?

223
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,040
Just forgot about it.

224
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,000
Let's think about it later.

225
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,440
Let's think about it later.

226
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,640
Please eat.

227
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,280
Uh…

228
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,200
It's like umm…

229
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,320
Like capsule.

230
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:41,920
But

231
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,440
more delicious.

232
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,640
Wait. Wait. Wait.

233
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:47,840
Oh.

234
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,320
Please use that utensil.

235
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,600
That one.

236
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,280
Yes.

237
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:55,800
Oh well.

238
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,760
Trying to teach him now?

239
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,600
Hmm…

240
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,200
Delicious!

241
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,600
Very delicious!

242
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,840
I never had something this delicious!

243
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,160
This planet has very delicious food!

244
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,560
So good!

245
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,080
Gosh.

246
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,280
I’m so happy.

247
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:23,960
Please, eat a lot.

248
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,120
What is it?

249
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,240
I still want to see his face while eating.

250
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,000
He seems to love it.

251
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,480
He seems to love it.

252
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:30,880
Hey.

253
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,000
Thank you

254
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,080
for saving me.

255
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,320
Even though 

256
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,520
I’m about to destroy your planet.

257
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,080
I told you.

258
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,480
Let's think about it later.

259
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,720
So…

260
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,280
Everything is true?

261
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,640
All the time 

262
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,280
I thought you were crazy.

263
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,000
It's unbelievable.

264
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
And 

265
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,600
what would you do now?

266
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,320
You do nothing.

267
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,600
Because I’ll capture him back.

268
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,440
You go back first.

269
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,840
I’ll take care of it.

270
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:18,840
Yes, Sir.

271
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,640
All right, the fun's over.

272
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,480
Your time is over.

273
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,600
You have two choices.

274
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,080
One

275
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,920
destroys the world now

276
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,120
and go back for punishment.

277
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,400
Charge of messing up your duty.

278
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:45,880
Or two

279
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,000
Go back now to receive your punishment.

280
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,120
As for the bomb, I'll handle it myself.

281
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,160
I umm…

282
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,120
Shut up!

283
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,760
Everyone on the space station

284
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,560
has been watching you.

285
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,960
You just live day by day.

286
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,000
And nothing happened.

287
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,280
And nothing happened.

288
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,200
I don't understand.

289
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,960
Why did they choose you? 

290
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,680
Can I ask for him to stay one more night, please?

291
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,080
I would die anyway.

292
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,280
Please, I’m begging you.

293
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,920
What do you mean?

294
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,960
Promise 

295
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,080
Promise?

296
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:47,880
Like this.

297
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,120
Hm.

298
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,960
Fine.

299
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,000
Consider it an exchange for food.

300
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,000
Thank you so much, Sir.

301
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,680
Thank you so much, Sir.

302
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,080
Hm.

303
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,120
If you don’t press the button,

304
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,680
Make some light out.

305
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,600
your suitcase will do it for you.

306
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,880
Let's get inside.

307
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,160
Yeah. Come in.

308
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,280
Oh. Let's get inside.

309
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,880
Hello, Uncle.

310
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,760
Oh. Hello.

311
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,520
Here. I bought food for you.

312
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,320
And this one for Mimiw.

313
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,400
Ah, thank you.

314
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,720
Mimiw.

315
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,840
I have food for you.

316
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,400
Hm.

317
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,800
Went out the whole day.

318
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,320
Hm.

319
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,680
For Mimiw right?

320
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,520
Yes.

321
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,000
What are you doing?

322
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,400
Be patient.

323
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,920
You must learn to wait.

324
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,320
Slow down a bit.

325
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,040
Yes.

326
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,480
You never learn.

327
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,440
Be patient.

328
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,840
Oh and

329
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,000
take Mimiw back.

330
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,720
Or your mom will be angry again.

331
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,160
She’s allergic to cat fur.

332
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,760
Ah. That's enough.

333
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,000
Enough.

334
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,200
Enough.

335
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,560
I’ll handle it.

336
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,000
Yes.

337
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,320
I’ll take my leave now.

338
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,400
Please eat a lot.

339
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,560
Mimiw, good bye.

340
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,680
Wait.

341
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,680
Take him with you.

342
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,400
My cat.

343
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,240
I remember him.

344
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,000
But can you take him with you?

345
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,560
I don't want to have him anymore.

346
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,760
Consider it my plea.

347
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,760
Could you make me feel at ease?

348
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,480
Pity him

349
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,120
like how you pity me.

350
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,040
I'm begging you.

351
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,720
There must be many truths 

352
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,720
that I still don't know.

353
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,680
Then. Before I die

354
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,040
can I ask you something?

355
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,520
Why haven't you destroyed the world yet?

356
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,520
Hmm…

357
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,080
Because 

358
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,240
the food here is delicious.

359
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,480
And everyone here

360
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,960
Is very kind to me

361
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,440
especially you.

362
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,000
You've been kind to me from day one to last-

363
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,320
You've been kind to me from day one to last-

364
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,240
Today.

365
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,000
Hm.

366
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,360
Today.

367
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,600
Do you know 

368
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,160
that I’m not the first one 

369
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,240
who came here.

370
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,280
Is there an article here?

371
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,640
Article?

372
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:10,920
Yes.

373
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,440
There are articles,

374
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,600
tales,

375
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,320
novels

376
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,400
and a lot more.

377
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,600
I have

378
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,920
an article that I want to tell to you.

379
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,640
It's the story of 

380
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,280
a spaceship 

381
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,280
and 

382
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,520
the earth.

383
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,800
There were 3 spaceships.

384
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,480
The first one

385
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,880
came to explore the earth.

386
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,720
Then it…flew away.

387
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,280
But the second one

388
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,640
had been flying around the earth

389
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:19,960
everyday.

390
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,880
Never stop not even a day.

391
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,960
For the last ship.

392
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,040
He intended to land.

393
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,360
he disappeared forever.

394
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,440
What the hell?

395
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,760
Do you want to die?

396
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:19,800
I’m sorry, Sir.

397
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,120
Watch where you’re going!

398
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,600
Dim.

399
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,200
What happened?

400
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,560
Bro…

401
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,080
Could you make me feel at ease?

402
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,920
Pity him

403
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,400
like how you pity me.

404
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,640
Uncle!

405
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,280
Uncle!

406
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,080
Uncle!

407
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,000
Uncle!

408
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,200
Uncle!

409
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,040
Hey!

410
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,200
Dim.

411
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,440
Calm down.

412
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,920
I’ll help you find him.

413
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,520
Uncle and Mimiw

414
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,320
probably won't go anywhere far.

415
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,680
I think…

416
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,120
Shall we go to my house first?

417
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,520
They will come back soon.

418
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,680
What if they don’t?

419
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,520
He has Alzheimer's, Man…

420
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:44,920
Umm…

421
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,280
Let me

422
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,880
help to check.

423
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,160
Mimiw.

424
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,760
Meow. Meow. Meow.

425
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,840
Stubborn cat.

426
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,520
Where are you?

427
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,080
Stubborn cat.

428
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,720
Mimiw.

429
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,040
Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow.

430
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,000
Stubborn one.

431
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,120
Where are you?

432
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,000
Stubborn cat.

433
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,800
If you don't come out

434
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,120
I’ll go home then.

435
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,520
I’ll wait for you there.

436
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,800
Mimiw.

437
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,400
Hm?

438
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,320
You’re back, stubborn cat.

439
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,880
Oh.

440
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,080
You must be hungry.

441
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,480
Here.

442
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,440
Eat it.

443
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,000
Sigh.

444
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,280
Sigh.

445
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,760
Don’t wander too far.

446
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,960
I’m so old.

447
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,360
I can’t follow you.

448
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,920
Sigh.

449
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,480
My wife is gone.

450
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,360
My son also ran away like you.

451
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,000
He hasn't come home now.

452
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,680
He hasn't come home now.

453
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,480
Sigh.

454
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,360
Are you tired?

455
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,320
Do you want to go home now?

456
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,680
Or do you still want to be out here?

457
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,080
So I can keep your company.

458
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,160
Hm?

459
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,840
You won't say anything?

460
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,840
We’re friends, stubborn cat.

461
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,440
If I speak,

462
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,240
will you hear me?

463
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,280
Thank you

464
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,520
for bearing with an ill man like me.

465
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,800
I won’t leave long.

466
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,880
You should go live with my son.

467
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,600
Soon he would come back.

468
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,960
And I…

469
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,000
I would forget you.

470
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,880
I would forget you.

471
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,440
But I don’t know if I’ll forget 

472
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,880
or I’ll die first.

473
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,440
But you will remember me.

474
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,000
How could I forget you?

475
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,480
How could I forget you?

476
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,880
You’re my kind human.

477
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,680
Please, go.

478
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,120
Go live with my son.

479
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,760
When he comes back

480
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:00,000
he will never forget you.

481
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,760
he will never forget you.

482
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,720
You understand me right?

483
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,880
Dad.

484
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,960
I’m sorry.

485
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,760
Son, you’re back.

486
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,480
Dim.

487
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,280
Hey.

488
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,680
You.

489
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,040
Where are you going?

490
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,600
You.

491
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,200
I’m not just destroying the world.

492
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,600
But I’m destroying everyone.

493
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,040
I’m selfish.

494
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,520
My planet is selfish.

495
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,960
People here have lives.

496
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,040
Have hearts.

497
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,600
Have feelings.

498
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,920
But my we’re heartless.

499
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Only seeking benefits.

500
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,680
Only seeking benefits.

501
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,360
What should I do?

502
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,680
Is it too late to fix it?

503
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,720
Hey.

504
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,040
It's ok.

505
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,880
If you can’t go back and change anything

506
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,880
then let it be.

507
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,640
But.

508
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,240
Tomorrow.

509
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,040
I have to destroy the whole world.

510
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,200
Come on.

511
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,280
Let's think about it later.

512
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,880
How about 

513
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,680
we go get something to eat at my house?

514
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,520
I’ll cook delicious food for you.

515
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,480
Let's say that

516
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,760
it's the last meal.

517
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,000
Before the world became a space expressway.

518
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,240
Before the world became a space expressway.

519
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:02,840
What is it?

520
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,600
A promise.

521
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,560
A promise.

522
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,840
that you will cook a delicious food 

523
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,800
for me.

524
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:54,920
I promise.

525
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,320
Keep going.

526
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,160
You can do it.

527
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,480
I want to eat your food every day.

528
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,640
Because your cooking

529
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:46,840
is mind-blowing!

530
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:47,920
So damn good!

531
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:53,920
I don’t want to be a stray.

532
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,480
Can you be my owner, please?

533
00:44:58,960 --> 00:44:59,960
Let's go home.

534
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,560
If you say my food is delicious

535
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,240
how about staying 

536
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,440
and eating with me every day?

537
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,440
Alright.

538
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,440
When everything is settled.

539
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,000
I’ll take my leave.

540
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:30,240
I’ll take my leave.

541
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,200
And you stay here.

542
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,760
Wait until the bomb signal appears.

543
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,680
I’ll be waiting for good news.

544
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:42,800
And

545
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,240
after finishing the explosion 

546
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,840
use that umbrella and return home immediately.

547
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:48,640
Yes.

548
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,960
Understood.

549
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:51,920
Oh.

550
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,320
Another thing.

551
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,360
Don’t think about running away.

552
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,880
Your friend has been locked up.

553
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,920
Gotcha.

554
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,520
What are they doing?

555
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:47,040
I don’t want to see you die.

556
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,840
It's ok.

557
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:00,000
Press the button.

558
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,400
Press the button.

559
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,120
I’m not scared of death.

560
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,960
It's just a shame 

561
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,000
that I can't see you anymore.

562
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:04,920
Hey!

563
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,080
Hey!

564
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:24,800
Watch out!

565
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:25,360
Whoa! Hey! Hey!

566
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,360
Hey! Whoa!

567
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,200
Ahhh!

568
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,040
Huh?

569
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,560
Uh….

570
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,400
It-

571
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,840
It will dry bro!

572
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:44,880
Hey!

573
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,840
The hell?

574
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,040
You.

575
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,080
It's almost dry.

576
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:56,440
Is that ok?

577
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:06,560
Chun!

578
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,160
We did it!

579
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:08,960
YESSS!

580
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,160
REALLY?!

581
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,200
WOOHOO!

582
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,240
IT WON’T EXPLODE ANYMORE?!

583
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:12,720
WOOHOO!

584
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:13,280
CAPE!

585
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,960
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!

586
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,120
What?

587
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,040
Not explode?

588
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:21,680
It’s not exploding anymore?

589
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:22,280
Not anymore.

590
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:22,920
Yes!

591
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:23,840
Yes! Not anymore!

592
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:26,200
Hahahaha! 
Hahahaha! 

593
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,400
Yay!

594
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,960
Hell yes!

595
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,000
It won’t explode anymore!

596
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:30,840
It won’t explode anymore!

597
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:35,240
Ahahahha!
Ahahahha!

598
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,360
I can’t believe it.

599
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:42,440
Tan’s coffee 

600
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:43,920
could save the world!

601
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:46,000
Hm.

602
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:47,760
Come on!

603
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,400
Be happy!

604
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,440
Our world is surviving.

605
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,080
Yay!

606
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:54,880
Woohoo!

607
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,000
Come on smile.

608
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,680
You look cute.

609
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,240
Hey.

610
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,160
So.

611
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,960
Do you really have to go home?

612
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,760
Come on.

613
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,040
Smile a bit.

614
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,160
Hm.

615
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,560
Your planet is only this far.

616
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:27,000
Come back when you’re hungry.

617
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,680
If I go back this time

618
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:49,240
I won’t be able to come back.

619
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,080
Why?

620
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,240
Hm?

621
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,760
I committed a serious offense.

622
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,400
They won’t let me come back again.

623
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:10,720
Really?

624
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,520
Then do this.

625
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:19,280
Here.

626
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:30,000
Like this.

627
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,120
Like this.

628
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,520
I promise that

629
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,640
one day

630
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:51,160
I’ll find a way to see you again.

631
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:55,040
Oh. 

632
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,200
And about the story that you told me.

633
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,000
About the spaceship on Earth.

634
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:00,080
About the spaceship on Earth.

635
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,480
Do you remember it?

636
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:04,920
Do you know that

637
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:07,640
here we also have it

638
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,240
Doreamon.

639
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:14,560
You are

640
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,040
the most precious to me, you know?

641
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,160
Now that you know this.

642
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:29,960
Please don't go.

643
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:48,520
When i was a kid.

644
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:51,000
I loved reading a certain comic.

645
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:54,000
It was the story of a boy named Nobita

646
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,000
who met a robotic cat named Doraemon.

647
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:59,920
They were best friends.

648
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:02,640
I kept reading.

649
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,400
Until my grandma told me that

650
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,720
The comic had three different endings.

651
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:16,560
The first ending.

652
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,920
Doraemon is just a robot friend 

653
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,960
that Nobita created.

654
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,760
Because he never had a true friend growing up.

655
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:28,560
The second ending.

656
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,000
Doraemon was just a dream.

657
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:30,360
Doraemon was just a dream.

658
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,280
A part of Nobita’s imagination.

659
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:34,960
So Nobita could only meet Doraemon

660
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,680
in his dreams.

661
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:47,480
The third ending.

662
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,240
Doraemon intended to go back to the future

663
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:53,960
to ask for a chance to return to Nobita.

664
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,040
Before he died.

665
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,000
No matter how the story ends,

666
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:00,880
No matter how the story ends,

667
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:04,800
they’ll always be best friends forever.

668
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,000
Thank you so much.

669
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:40,960
What?

670
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:41,920
You’re free today?

671
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:44,480
Nothing to do?

672
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,400
Tomorrow bring me your coffee too.

673
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,000
What are you doing, Tan?

674
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:00,160
What are you doing, Tan?

675
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:08,160
Yes!

676
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:10,640
Finally sold out!

677
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:11,800
Are you crazy?

678
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,000
Oh. Hi Uncle.

679
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:15,720
Hello.

680
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:17,280
Are you here for a haircut?

681
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:17,880
Hm.

682
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:19,120
By the way.

683
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:21,320
Today my shop has a free haircut promotion.

684
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,280
Oh alright.

685
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:26,680
This way, please.

686
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,400
Are you doing well?

687
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,280
I’m doing well.

688
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:39,800
Oh.

689
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:41,800
Haven't seen you for a while.

690
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:42,960
You’ve grown up.

691
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:43,680
Hahaha.

692
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:47,440
He looks cute.

693
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:52,440
Hahaha.

694
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:56,680
If my wife isn't allergic to cat fur

695
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:59,160
I’ll get one of them.

696
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:02,520
Oh.

697
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:03,600
And what’s its name?

698
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,080
And how long have you had it?

699
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:09,520
His name is Mimiw.

700
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,080
I’ve had him for a while.

701
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,920
But if you want to play with him

702
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,000
you can come every day.

703
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,400
Consider it as being Mimiw's friend.

704
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:17,320
Really?

705
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:17,800
Yes.

706
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:18,880
Thank you. Thank you.

707
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:20,800
Mimiw.

708
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:23,080
Here.

709
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:23,400
Well.

710
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,680
Please have a seat.

711
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:28,360
Oh.

712
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:29,800
Um. Uncle.

713
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:31,120
This promotion 

714
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:31,760
I have to…

715
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,440
May I take a picture with you first?

716
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:34,480
Yes.

717
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:35,320
I’ll selfie then.

718
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:35,960
Alright. Alright.

719
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:36,320
Hehe.

720
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,000
And then we will do a haircut.

721
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:38,680
Ok.

722
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,200
1

723
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:41,920
2

724
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,440
Meow~

725
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:51,800
The feeling like this

726
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:54,480
make this world worth living.

727
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:57,760
Meow~

728
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:44,840
Come Mimiw.

729
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:45,640
Let's go home.

730
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:49,080
Let's go home.

731
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:50,200
Go.

732
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:51,480
Yeah.

733
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:54,600
Go.

734
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:56,560
Yeah.

735
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:57,640
Let's go home.

736
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,720
Come on.

737
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:46,640
Hey.

738
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,000
What are you doing?

739
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:49,800
Oh.

740
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:51,960
You’re back.

741
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:53,600
I’m back yes.

742
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:56,400
Ah.

743
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:57,240
I umm…

744
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,000
Thinking of someone.

745
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,120
Thinking of someone.

746
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:02,960
Thinking of who?

747
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,640
Thinking of you.

748
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:08,720
Aww…

749
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,160
Eat.

750
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:16,520
Ahem.

751
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:17,280
Chun.

752
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:18,360
Hm?

753
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:20,200
Before eating, what should you do first?

754
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,240
You never learn.

755
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:27,280
Coming?

756
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:30,000
Don’t cheat.

757
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:30,200
Don’t cheat.

758
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:30,760
Ok.

759
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:33,040
Muach.

760
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,120
Hmm.

761
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:37,320
What a cutie.

762
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:38,280
Whose boyfriend is this?

763
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:39,920
Hey! Don’t squeeze my belly.
Hmm! Chubby. Chubby.

764
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:43,120
I’m fat now.

765
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:46,360
You cook me a lot of food.

766
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:48,080
Look at me.

767
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:49,080
Am I too fat?

768
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:50,120
Should I lose some weight?

769
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:50,840
Hm?

770
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,280
You won't remember me.

771
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:53,760
You’re cute like this.

772
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:54,840
No need to do so.

773
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:55,640
Really?

774
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:00,560
What is this?

775
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:02,320
What promise this time.

776
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:04,680
Oh.

777
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,480
Actually, this symbol doesn't really mean 'promise'.

778
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:08,960
Huh?

779
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:10,760
it actually means...

780
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,440
I love you.

781
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,840
it Means, I love you.

782
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:18,880
Really?

783
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:20,480
Real

784
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:22,680
Eat the food, Love.

785
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:27,120
So you've been secretly telling me

786
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:28,600
you love me all this time, haven't you?

787
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:29,240
Huh?

788
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:31,360
Um.

789
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:32,800
Didn't see that coming.

790
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:33,600
Hehe.

791
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:36,920
Wait.

792
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:38,520
Wait a minute.

793
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:45,280
This symbol…

794
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:49,640
you made it for the space police too, didn’t you?

795
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:53,080
Um.

796
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:55,200
So you’re in love with the space police

797
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:55,720
No!

798
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:56,320
Is that so?

799
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:58,400
Eh?

800
01:01:58,920 --> 01:01:59,560
I mean...

801
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:00,000
Eh?

802
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:00,320
Eh?

803
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:01,200
Hold up.

804
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:01,600
listen to me.

805
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:02,240
Why did you.

806
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:02,640
Eh?

807
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:03,400
space police

808
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:04,160
handsome too.

809
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:05,280
Please listen to me first.

810
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:05,960
Calm down.

811
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:06,600
Oh.

812
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:10,160
The reason I had to do that that day was to protect you.

813
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:11,520
By telling him you love him?

814
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:12,640
Before me?

815
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,720
At that time, I honestly couldn’t think of anything.

816
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,280
So, I ended up doing this.

817
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:17,000
Like this?

818
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,480
But I wasn’t thinking about anything at all.

819
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,000
But you already sent it.

820
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:20,920
Is that so?

821
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:22,240
Oh wow!

822
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:24,200
Babe, you’re studying my personality a bit too much.

823
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:27,360
I understand that you intend to give it to me alone.

824
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:27,840
Sigh.

825
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:28,200
I’m sorry.

826
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:28,760
I’m really sorry ok?

827
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:29,600
You. Stop it!

828
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:30,000
No. Go sit there.

829
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:30,560
No. Go sit there.

830
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:32,120
I won’t eat anything today!

831
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:32,680
No.
I not eating it!

832
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:33,880
You stop-

833
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:35,600
I’ll go eat at Aunt Jaew’s shop.

834
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:36,520
I’ll go now.

835
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:37,520
I was angry with you.

836
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:38,200
I’ll walk there now.

837
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:39,240
I’ll walk there now.

838
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:40,120
Will you let me go?

839
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:41,640
Aunt Jaew gave me food!

840
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:42,880
Ahhh!

841
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:44,240
I’m confident!

842
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:45,320
I don't believe you!

843
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:46,920
Aunt Jaew's cooking is more delicious!

844
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:49,120
How can her food be better than mine?!
Oh well!

845
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:50,520
She is better!

846
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,200
What is this place?

847
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:00,000
What is that smell?

848
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:00,080
What is that smell?

849
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:01,360
Smell good.

850
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:07,080
Please report the progress.
