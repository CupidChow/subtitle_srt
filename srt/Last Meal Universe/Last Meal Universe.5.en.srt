1
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,240
So, what happened to you?

2
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,160
Why does your body have such effect?

3
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,160
Be careful.

4
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,240
Achoo!

5
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,000
Hey.

6
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,440
Hm.
I’ll go prepare a glass of ginger tea for you.

7
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,640
So, you would feel better.

8
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,680
Ginger tea?

9
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,600
Yes.

10
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,520
Does it taste good?

11
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,120
Good?

12
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,000
It's the best.

13
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,760
It's the best.

14
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,520
It was my grandma’s recipe.

15
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,640
I can assure you

16
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,680
that you will definitely feel better.

17
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,160
Achoo!

18
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,280
Here

19
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,120
Smash it gently.

20
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,240
Careful not to crush it.

21
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,600
Yes, Grandma.

22
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,680
Hm.

23
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,680
The water is boiling.

24
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,080
Put the ginger in.

25
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,720
And boil it for only 15 minutes.

26
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,120
The heat is too high. Lower the heat.

27
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,040
Oh.

28
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,520
And.

29
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,000
You must continue boiling in low heat for 20 minutes.

30
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,800
You must continue boiling in low heat for 20 minutes.

31
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,200
When you finish, turn off the stove.

32
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,800
Then wait for 15 minutes more.

33
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,200
Why it takes so long, Grandma?

34
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,080
Remember, dear.

35
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,040
Cooking, you must be calm.

36
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,240
If you rush it, the food won’t be delicious.

37
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,640
Understand?

38
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,560
Yes, Grandma.

39
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,440
Once finished, you may add the brown sugar.

40
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,000
And why we cannot add it before we finish, Grandma?

41
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,680
If you add the sugar before it finish,

42
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,680
the sugar will stop the ginger

43
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,120
from releasing its juice.

44
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,120
And the sweetness of the ginger won’t come out.

45
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,840
It smells so good, Grandma.

46
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,280
Is it?

47
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,040
Yes, Grandma.

48
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,640
Coming.

49
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,960
The sweet smelled ginger tea from my grandma’s recipe.

50
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,720
Oh! Wait! Wait! Wait!

51
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,000
Huh?

52
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,200
Huh?

53
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,440
I better place it here.

54
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,920
Hmm.

55
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,800
Hm?

56
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,200
Oh!

57
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,520
No more electronic shocking!

58
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,240
Ah!

59
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,160
Whoa!

60
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:46,440
Oh!

61
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,600
Oops.

62
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,280
Oh.

63
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,800
Umm.

64
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,640
I’m sorry.

65
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,320
You’re still unwell.

66
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,080
I think you better get more rest.

67
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,000
I’ll go back to the counter.

68
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,360
I’ll go back to the counter.

69
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,560
I’ve left it for a while.

70
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,840
Hey.

71
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,040
Thank you.

72
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,680
Take some rest.

73
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,200
It’s because of you.

74
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,280
Achoo!

75
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,920
Achoo!

76
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,600
Chan Dan.

77
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,200
How’s he doing?

78
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,480
He seems better now.

79
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,200
He’ll be alright.

80
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,840
Thank you for taking care of the restaurant when I was away.

81
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,000
You’re welcome.

82
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,880
Don’t mention it.

83
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,080
But…

84
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,680
Can I at least have something to eat?

85
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,040
Go ahead.

86
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,000
Thank you so much!

87
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,160
Thank you so much!

88
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,040
May I order?

89
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,400
Our restaurant is already closed today.

90
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,600
I’m so sorry.

91
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,160
It's alright, man.

92
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:38,840
Please come back later.

93
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,240
Of course.

94
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,040
Thank you.

95
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,120
You haven’t returned the plate you took.

96
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,320
Give it back.

97
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,600
My restaurant will run out of plates soon.

98
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,440
It’s a giveaway!

99
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,640
Hey! Isn't it too much?

100
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,760
That's enough.

101
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,720
Thank you so much.

102
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,840
What's wrong with you?

103
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,400
Have a lot of free time to just sit here and do nothing?

104
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,080
Lonely?

105
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,800
Hm?

106
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,840
Dim.

107
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,640
You aren't gentle like Chan Dan!

108
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,400
Mark my words.

109
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,440
One day.

110
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,000
You won’t be able to resist.

111
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You won’t be able to resist.

112
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,160
And you will miss my coffee!

113
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,160
Your coffee is here.

114
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,160
Have you paid?

115
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:10,840
Yes.

116
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,760
Thank you.

117
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,760
Have you already paid?

118
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,560
Yes.

119
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,240
50 baht

120
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,520
Delivery fee included.

121
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,640
Ah!

122
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,160
Hey.

123
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,840
I cooked rice porridge for you.

124
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,200
Chun?

125
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,360
Cape?

126
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,480
Cape?

127
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,400
What's up, bro?

128
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,760
Well, Gab..um..

129
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,000
I think..

130
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,760
I think have a problem.

131
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,960
Problem?!

132
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,640
Yes.

133
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,800
Well, now body 

134
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,800
it has..

135
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,520
it has static electricity.(ประจุไฟฟ้าสถิต)

136
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,760
Huh?

137
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,920
This can't be good.

138
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,960
I’ll report to the boss.

139
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,560
What?

140
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,080
Cape!

141
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,200
No!

142
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,000
We can’t let him know this.

143
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,160
If he knows,

144
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,560
he will send the inspector here.

145
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,000
They will know the truth.

146
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,720
Ah!

147
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,800
I see.

148
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,000
Then in five minutes, find a place that is not crowded.

149
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,440
Then in five minutes, find a place that is not crowded.

150
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,360
And I’ll find your location.

151
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,560
I’ll send someone, I trust down there to check on you.

152
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,360
Hm.

153
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,680
Thank you so much.

154
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,080
Oh, hey.

155
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:33,720
Hey.

156
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,600
Where have you been?

157
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,960
I made rice porridge for you.

158
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,560
Hey.

159
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,360
Where are you going?

160
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,200
Are you well now?

161
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,560
Hey!

162
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,600
Ah!
Ouch!

163
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,160
I’m sorry.

164
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,680
I asked you a question.

165
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,000
Umm...

166
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,360
Umm...

167
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,400
Well…

168
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,760
Well, what?

169
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,200
Don’t you see

170
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,600
that it will rain soon.

171
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,840
Hey!

172
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,000
Where the hell is he going?

173
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,040
Where the hell is he going?

174
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:56,680
Uh

175
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,880
My code…

176
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,640
It’s 2225.

177
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,000
Copy that.

178
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,640
Copy that.

179
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,680
I was sent to take care of your condition.

180
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:03,960
Yes.

181
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,240
And how are you feeling?

182
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,760
Umm…

183
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,920
I think…

184
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:12,000
I think that I might have static electricity in my body. (ประจุไฟฟ้าสถิตอยู่ในร่างกาย)

185
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,400
This can be severe if we let it continue.

186
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,360
I suggest you

187
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,760
to go back to our planet immediately.

188
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,640
And change the temperature to 0 Kelvin.

189
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,200
The climate(สภาพภูมิอากาศ) of this planet is  unstable. 

190
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,360
Sudden hot and then cold.

191
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,000
It’s no surprise that we were sent here to destroy it.

192
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,000
Destroy.

193
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,840
Destroy.

194
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,200
Correct.

195
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,520
You were sent here to destroy it.

196
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,920
Weren’t you?

197
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,040
A-oh.

198
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,160
Yes.

199
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,360
Yes, you’re right.

200
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,400
Then.

201
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,080
Let me find a location to secretly produce the vaccine for you.

202
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,240
I‘ll contact you later.

203
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,000
And don't forget to take good care of yourself.

204
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,240
And don't forget to take good care of yourself.

205
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,520
Do not let your boys get wet.

206
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,280
And regularly check your temperature as well.

207
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:36,920
Understood.

208
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,040
Wait. Sir.

209
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,440
About this you won’t-

210
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,560
No problem,

211
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,320
You can trust me.

212
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,360
You can touch my mind.

213
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,240
But.

214
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,760
Not too long.

215
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,960
If the boss knows we lie,

216
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,000
we’re dead.

217
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,240
we’re dead.

218
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,720
Ah!
Ah!

219
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,120
Gosh!
Gosh!

220
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,120
Ah!

221
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:07,680
Ah!

222
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,080
This is bad.

223
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,280
This planet is uninhabitable!

224
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,320
I'll take my leave now.

225
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,240
Hey!

226
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,920
Huh?

227
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,680
Hey?

228
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,080
Huh?

229
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,040
It's lock.

230
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,000
Gosh.

231
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,080
Hey!

232
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:49,880
What?

233
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,120
Chan Dan!

234
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,320
Are you there?

235
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,760
Hey!

236
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,400
The door is locked.

237
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,360
It's locked.

238
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,280
The door is locked.

239
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,640
You came alone?

240
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,400
Huh?

241
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,560
Yes.

242
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,280
What is it?

243
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,920
It's locked.

244
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,000
Hey, it's locked.

245
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,440
Hey, it's locked.

246
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,800
It's locked!

247
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,200
What?

248
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,480
IT'S LOCKED!

249
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,520
You didn’t hear?

250
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:40,880
It-

251
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,440
You open it.

252
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:41,960
Open.

253
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,120
Open the door for me.

254
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:43,720
What is wrong-

255
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,480
Just.

256
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,240
The door is locked.

257
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,280
What?

258
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,520
Hey.

259
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,240
Hey!

260
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,200
The door is locked!

261
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:51,960
Hey!

262
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,840
Hey!

263
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,920
What the hell?

264
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,280
Do you know what you forgot outside?

265
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,000
ME!

266
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,280
ME!

267
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,160
I’M HERE!

268
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,280
OPEN THE DOOR!

269
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,520
THE MOSQUITOS ARE BITTING ME

270
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,040
HEY! THE DOOR IS LOCKED!

271
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,160
OH COME ON!

272
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,360
CHAN DAN!

273
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,640
HEY!!!

274
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,360
OPEN IT PLEASE!

275
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,600
Delicious hm?

276
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,360
You eat a lot of it today.

277
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,400
Have you finished it?

278
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,680
You eat a lot today.

279
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,760
Finished?

280
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,680
Are you done?

281
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,360
Done?

282
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,160
Full? Are you?

283
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:45,840
Come.

284
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,120
Let’s go to bed.

285
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,520
Oh.

286
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,360
Let’s go.

287
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:49,920
That's enough eating little one.

288
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,760
Enough. Enough.

289
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,160
Come.

290
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,080
Let’s go.

291
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,080
Let's go to bed.

292
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,560
It's sleeping time.

293
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,320
You’re sleepy.

294
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,240
Oh well, you’re ready to sleep hm?

295
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,000
There.

296
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,800
Ok.

297
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,240
Lay there.

298
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,360
The same spot.

299
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,280
Sleep then.

300
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,280
Come sleep here.

301
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,960
Hurry.

302
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,840
Hey!

303
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,600
Come, on!

304
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,200
Could you open the door please?

305
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,680
Hey.

306
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,880
Can I come in, please.

307
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,880
Yes.

308
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,280
But you must tell me! Where have you been?!

309
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,760
Don’t you know how much I worried about you!

310
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,280
Well, I mean…

311
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,760
You’re living in the same house as me, right?

312
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,400
And you’re sick.

313
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,520
And you went out in the rain.

314
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,200
What if you die inside my house, what do I do?

315
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,880
Oh.

316
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,680
I’m sorry.

317
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,200
Yeah. Whatever.

318
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,640
I was so worried.

319
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,000
Turned out that

320
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,440
you went out to meet someone else.

321
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,400
Huh?

322
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,840
Went where?

323
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,800
I haven’t gone anywhere.

324
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,680
Yeah? Haven’t gone?

325
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:26,800
Hey.

326
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,760
Ouch!
Ah!

327
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,640
I’m sorry.

328
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
So..

329
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,280
Won’t you go see your friend?

330
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,920
You had met him.

331
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,560
Hm?

332
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,640
Friend?

333
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,720
I don’t have friends here.

334
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,800
Are you pulling my leg now?

335
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,280
Go away.

336
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,600
What?

337
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,120
W-hey.

338
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,720
Hey!

339
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,360
Right in time.

340
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,960
Why this planet 

341
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,600
is so tiring

342
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,960
and dismal.

343
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,800
Meow~

344
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,800
Whoa.

345
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,920
Hey.

346
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,600
You?

347
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,360
Yes.
Why are you here?

348
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,360
What a lament.

349
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,200
You.

350
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,280
Why are you here?

351
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,600
Why silly question?

352
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,800
Huh?

353
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,000
This is my place.

354
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,840
It’s you.

355
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,000
Why don't you go home?

356
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,400
Why don't you go home?

357
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:34,800
There.

358
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,800
Go back to your friend’s house.

359
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,040
Friend?

360
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,160
Yes.

361
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,280
That human.

362
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,400
The one that lives with you.

363
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,880
He’s your friend. Don’t you know that?

364
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,640
But..

365
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,000
I haven’t known him for long.

366
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,600
I haven’t known him for long.

367
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,600
We haven’t been closed.

368
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,920
We can be friends?

369
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,280
Of course.

370
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,400
You can.

371
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,200
Don’t tell me that you never had a friend before.

372
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,840
I have..

373
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,000
I have friends…but

374
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,480
you must be close first so that you can be friends next.

375
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,320
Ahh!  Why is it so hard for you to understand something? 

376
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,000
By the way, are you free now?

377
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,440
I am.

378
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,520
Good. More interested to talk to.

379
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,320
Hm.

380
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,240
Hm?

381
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,600
This.

382
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,440
Here.

383
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,160
Thank you- What the-

384
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:46,720
What?

385
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,800
Why did you slab me? It's hurt!

386
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,200
I though-

387
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,320
I mean scratching my chin.

388
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,280
Chin scratching. Like this.

389
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,920
Why didn't you say it in the first place?

390
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,280
Mmm..

391
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,920
Oh, yeah there.

392
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,320
What I want to tell you is that

393
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,000
friends are easy to find on this planet.

394
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
friends are easy to find on this planet.

395
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,200
You can be friends even with someone you just met.

396
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,280
Oh.

397
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,520
And someone

398
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,760
is not a normal friend.

399
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,520
Oh?

400
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,160
But..

401
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,200
Aha.

402
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,960
Not normal friends and what?

403
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,040
Hm..

404
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,800
Gosh!

405
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,880
You’re just friends at first.

406
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,680
But after knowing each other for a while 

407
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,280
from normal friends would turn into best friends.

408
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,000
Best friends, you know?

409
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,120
Best friends, you know?

410
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,240
Meow~

411
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,640
But I have none.

412
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,720
Best friends?

413
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,880
Yes.

414
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,600
Humans…

415
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,120
Do feel that way?

416
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,520
Yes.

417
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,520
Is there something on my ear?

418
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,800
Ah~ Thank you.

419
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,280
The humans on this planet

420
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,200
they all have feelings.

421
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,800
And how could I know that?

422
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,480
You ask so many questions.

423
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,000
Let's try it this way.

424
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,320
Let's try it this way.

425
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,280
For me, if someone feeds me

426
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,320
it means

427
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,520
that they love me.

428
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,280
Haha. Meow~

429
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:39,800
Ah!

430
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,520
Ah! Meow!

431
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,800
Ah!

432
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,400
Whoa!

433
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,600
Hey!

434
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,920
W-wait!

435
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,920
Hey!

436
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,680
The earth…

437
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,920
And space…

438
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,400
Why they are so different?

439
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,480
What should we do now, Chun?

440
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,120
Let’s go home.

441
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,600
Huh?

442
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,160
Come on. Hurry.

443
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,960
Ah. Gosh.

444
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,080
Hm.

445
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,960
Our clothes are wet.

446
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,160
You can touch me..

447
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:47,800
It means you don’t get an electric shock anymore?

448
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,960
There is a shock.

449
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,720
Huh?

450
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,600
But you still-

451
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,520
Just a small shock.

452
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,480
I’ll be alright.

453
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,800
Ouch!
Ouch.

454
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,000
Ah!

455
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,360
Ah!

456
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,280
Haha.

457
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,080
Achoo!

458
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,160
Hmm.

459
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,640
I think you better go get a shower.

460
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,000
I’ll go prepare something hot for you.

461
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,760
Prepare something for me?

462
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,560
Yes.

463
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,520
Are you…

464
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,960
Are you fond of me?

465
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,880
Just go take a shower.

466
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,000
Come on. Go.

467
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,080
Come on. Go.

468
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,240
Oh.

469
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,040
Hey.

470
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,520
Hm?

471
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,000
You came just right on time.

472
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,360
Come eat.

473
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,080
Wow!

474
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,680
This is rice porridge.

475
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,640
Porridge?

476
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,160
Give it a try. It’s really good.

477
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,240
Smell good.

478
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,000
If it smells good, then hurry and eat it.

479
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,920
Oh and…

480
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,640
Drink a lot of water.

481
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,520
Water?

482
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,000
Yes.

483
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,280
Yes.

484
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,160
My grandma said that a symptom like this

485
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,840
could be cured by drinking a lot of water.

486
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,280
Oh, really?

487
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,160
And why is that?

488
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,920
You must maintain the moisture in your body.

489
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,800
Your skin is very dry.

490
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,640
Put on the cream and drink more water.

491
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,080
Confuse?

492
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,600
Confuse hmm?

493
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,520
It’s called static electricity.

494
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,560
Moreover, your skin is drier than normal.

495
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,880
Eat the porridge.

496
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,240
And drink water too.

497
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,480
Is it good?

498
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,240
What is it?

499
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,200
For me, if someone feeds me

500
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,120
it means that

501
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,200
they love me.

502
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,560
You…

503
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,160
Hm?

504
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,600
Do you love me?
