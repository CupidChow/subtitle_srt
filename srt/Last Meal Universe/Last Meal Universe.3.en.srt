1
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,400
Oh.

2
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,520
You awake.

3
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,520
Wow.

4
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,840
They look delicious.

5
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,400
Hey!

6
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,040
Be careful!

7
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,720
Whoa!

8
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,320
You should be waiting outside.

9
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,160
You’re blocking my way.

10
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,240
I have to cook.

11
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,000
Go, Wait outside.

12
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,120
Hey bro!

13
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,840
What are you doing?

14
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,160
I'm working.

15
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,360
You dare lie to a satellite operator like me?

16
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,280
Huh?

17
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,600
If you already know, what are you asking for?

18
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,280
Right?

19
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,440
Hm.

20
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,680
So what do you want?

21
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,000
Nothing.

22
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,080
Nothing.

23
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,480
I just wondering

24
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,000
that

25
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,200
What are you doing?

26
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,880
Just hurry up and destroy the world.

27
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,600
Then come back to the space.

28
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,440
Well.

29
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,400
I am.

30
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,560
Um.

31
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,320
Um.

32
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,320
I.

33
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,440
How about this?

34
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,720
I will go meet you there.

35
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,680
But

36
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,200
after my work.

37
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,640
Let's meet at our usual coordinates

38
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,120
No!

39
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,680
Hey!

40
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,520
What?

41
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,920
Oh no.

42
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,760
Here is your food.

43
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,120
Wow.

44
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,080
So

45
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,040
Do you really treat me to a meal?

46
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,280
Hm.

47
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,680
Well, when you get a job.

48
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,280
You can treat me back.

49
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,920
Oh and

50
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,760
if you feel sick or unwell

51
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,240
you can tell me.

52
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,080
Oh.

53
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,440
Thank you so much.

54
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,200
Enjoy your food.

55
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,040
Mm.

56
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,200
Mm.

57
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,040
Huh?

58
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,000
If you already know, what are you asking for?

59
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,240
If you already know, what are you asking for?

60
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,000
Right?

61
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,680
Hm.

62
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,680
So what do you want?

63
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,600
Maybe he’s a psychiatric patient?

64
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,160
Strange.

65
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,400
Oh my!

66
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,600
I like it!

67
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,320
Korean style.

68
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,240
Here.

69
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,440
Thank you so much.

70
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,040
You're welcome.

71
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,600
Thank you.

72
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,240
Thank you too.

73
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,120
Please come back again next time.

74
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,800
See you later.

75
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,520
Mimi?

76
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,480
Where are you going?

77
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,680
Did you come alone?

78
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,360
Come here.

79
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,400
Come to me.

80
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,680
I would like to get a haircut.

81
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,880
This way please.

82
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,360
Your coffee is here!

83
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,720
Why don't you wear the head part?

84
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,840
I need a break.

85
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:41,880
So hot.

86
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,320
Here.

87
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,320
Your coffee.

88
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,280
Gosh!

89
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,240
I’m so tired.

90
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,840
Why are you wearing it then?

91
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,040
You always complain.

92
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,360
Well my Boss told me to wear it.

93
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,200
He said it was for marketing.

94
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,680
Hey. I ordered only one cup

95
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,000
I didn't order this one.

96
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,920
You order this one.

97
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,480
But I think that guy.

98
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,000
That one.

99
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,560
That one.

100
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,920
He wants this one.

101
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,000
Hm?

102
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,680
Fine.

103
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,120
Thank you!

104
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,920
Any special price for two?

105
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,520
Oh, come on. They’re for selling not bargaining.

106
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,080
Hm.

107
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,800
Don’t forget my change.

108
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,000
I don't have change. How about this evening?

109
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,640
I don't have change. How about this evening?

110
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,560
I will give it to you.

111
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,160
Tan!

112
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,080
Stop there!

113
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,880
Mm! Mm!

114
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,560
Mm!

115
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,560
Wait a second

116
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,440
Wait.

117
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,360
Can you give me more money?

118
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,400
Huh?

119
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,840
Hm.

120
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,160
Well I

121
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,880
want more money.

122
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,040
Could you

123
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,640
find me a job?

124
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,120
Job?

125
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,280
Yes.

126
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:16,920
Again?

127
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,840
Like.

128
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,600
There is no other job in this world?

129
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,440
Well.

130
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,720
You look cute!

131
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:23,920
Right?

132
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,080
What are you laughing at?

133
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,280
Cute.

134
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,000
Look at how cute this is.

135
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,480
Look at how cute this is.

136
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,840
Fine. Cute then.

137
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,000
Well.

138
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,800
You need money.

139
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,600
You can split the job with me, half a day each.

140
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,120
And I will share the money with you.

141
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,120
Hm.

142
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,240
Here.

143
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,280
Take this.

144
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,800
I will go deliver the coffee first.

145
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,840
Um.

146
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,000
Oof!

147
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,480
And follow me ok?

148
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,480
Don’t slack off.
Hm.

149
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,960
Be careful.

150
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:00,800
Here.

151
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,800
Coffee.

152
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,440
Mm.

153
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,720
Hm.

154
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,400
Hm!

155
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,040
Ah.

156
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,840
Wow.

157
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,480
So refreshing!

158
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,400
Woo!

159
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,440
This planet is absolutely amazing!

160
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,920
I'm ready!

161
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,160
I’m ready to work!

162
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,480
For this planet!

163
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,000
Yay!

164
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,520
Hey.

165
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,200
That sounds familiar.

166
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,800
For the star~

167
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,000
I long to be~

168
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,360
I long to be~

169
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,720
To be the star, the dream isn't far~

170
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,360
Are you a fan of the show The Star?

171
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:35,840
Huh?

172
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,240
My favorite is the 6th season.

173
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:37,840
Huh?

174
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,120
Gun, Rit, and Tono.

175
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,240
"Especially Gun, he sings so incredibly well!"

176
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,240
How long will it take you to do this~

177
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:45,840
What?

178
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,160
Why do you seem confused? Never heard of it?

179
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,480
Never watched?

180
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,200
What is that?

181
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,080
About Rit I'm not sure. Maybe he's a doctor now.

182
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,720
He isn't sing anymore.

183
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,760
Just go.

184
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,960
Oh! Wait! Wait!

185
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,000
H-huh?

186
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,160
H-huh?

187
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:00,960
Wait a second.

188
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,080
Hm.

189
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,240
Take this with you.

190
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:06,960
Oh.

191
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,920
I made it for you.

192
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,160
For when you feel hungry.

193
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,040
Thank you so much.

194
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,640
Hey!

195
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,040
Yes?

196
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:18,640
You forgot this.

197
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,600
Oh.

198
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,360
Here.

199
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,360
Very good.

200
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,160
Hey!

201
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,520
Come on!

202
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,800
Ouch!

203
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,160
I’m just kidding.

204
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,000
Wrong side.

205
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,200
Wrong side.

206
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,360
I’m sorry. Sorry.

207
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,320
There.

208
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,320
Here.

209
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,880
Put it on.

210
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,840
Ok.

211
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,440
Looking good.

212
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,680
Be careful ok?

213
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,280
Ok.

214
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,200
And keep singing.

215
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,320
For the star~

216
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,200
Huh?

217
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,600
For the star~

218
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,360
Sing after me.

219
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,560
For the star~

220
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,880
I long to be~

221
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,080
I long to be~

222
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,160
For the star~

223
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,560
The dream isn't far~

224
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,840
The dream isn't far~

225
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,760
Very good keep singing.

226
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,160
Why don't you sing it yourself?

227
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,680
Hm.

228
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,480
Good luck .

229
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,000
Bye bye.

230
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,160
Bye bye.

231
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,920
Oh, you left so much food, Mimiw!

232
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,960
Hello, Uncle.

233
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,080
Oh, hello.

234
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,320
Are you preparing food for Mimiw?

235
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,680
Hm.

236
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,400
Always leaves the leftover.

237
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,240
Oh, I bought this for you.

238
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,720
Thank you.

239
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,400
From which restaurant?

240
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,800
The one um.

241
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,800
Oh, the grandma’s restaurant right?

242
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,200
Ah, yes

243
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,960
The grandma cooked the food well.

244
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,040
But when it comes to her grandson.

245
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,000
I’m not sure if it would be delicious.

246
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,160
I’m not sure if it would be delicious.

247
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,080
Hm.

248
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,040
I think

249
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,280
it's pretty delicious.

250
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,040
Yeah?

251
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,720
Oh and.

252
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,360
Where is Mimiw?

253
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,480
Hm.

254
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,200
I don't know. He must be traveling somewhere.

255
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,440
Hasn’t come back yet.

256
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,680
Hm.

257
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,400
Why don't you cage him?

258
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,760
Oh, no no.

259
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,920
You can not cage them.

260
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,400
Cats are animals that love freedom.

261
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,480
If we cage them

262
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,920
and once they are free

263
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,960
they will never come back.

264
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:33,880
Hm.

265
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,440
I see.

266
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,680
Let me prepare the food for you.

267
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,720
It's ok just leave it there.

268
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,600
Leave it there.

269
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,680
Well.

270
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,160
I will wait for Mimiw to come back first.

271
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,240
Yes.

272
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,560
Mimiw.

273
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,280
Meow. Meow.

274
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,760
Where are you little one?

275
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,640
Meow. Meow.

276
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,400
Meow. Meow.

277
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,000
Your food is ready.

278
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,280
Your food is ready.

279
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,600
Come eat them.

280
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,880
Where are you?

281
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,360
Mimiw?

282
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,400
Come here.

283
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,640
Come eat your food.

284
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,000
Where did you go?

285
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,840
Come. Come.

286
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,360
Mimiw.

287
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,200
Where are you?

288
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,080
Uncle.

289
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,280
I’ll take my leave then.

290
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,040
See you later.

291
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,960
Oh, alright.

292
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,320
Goodbye, uncle.

293
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,120
Um.

294
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,840
Meow. Meow.

295
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,080
God!

296
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,080
Gosh!

297
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,760
Gosh!

298
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,680
I can’t do this anymore!

299
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:15,760
Sigh.

300
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:16,880
Sigh.

301
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,800
Sigh.

302
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,280
Hi.

303
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:18,960
Ah!

304
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,160
You low-ranking engineer of space.

305
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,320
What is this?

306
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,360
What are you wearing?

307
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,560
Heh.

308
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,880
I'm just stopping by

309
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,200
Seriously.

310
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,320
When will you

311
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,440
blow up this planet.

312
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,720
I know that.

313
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,400
I’m working on it.

314
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,520
Working?

315
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,920
On what actually?

316
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,720
Each day.

317
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,520
I see you do nothing.

318
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,320
How did you know?

319
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,560
Eh?

320
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,240
Mm!

321
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,080
Mm!

322
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,920
Ah!

323
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,480
Have you been secretly spying on me?

324
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,320
Not secretly.

325
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,000
I intend to do that.

326
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:10,760
Hm.

327
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,520
Actually.

328
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,640
I came here to tell you.

329
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,360
That our organization

330
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,480
is keeping an eye on you.

331
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,720
What do you mean?

332
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,360
Well, your duty

333
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,960
is to destroy this planet.

334
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,840
So that we can build a space expressway, right?

335
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,000
What are you waiting for?

336
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,480
What are you waiting for?

337
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,760
Hurry up and destroy it.

338
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,040
So you could get a promotion.

339
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,480
Plus, you get a hundred thousand food capsules!

340
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,160
I know that.

341
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,600
You do?

342
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,440
If you do, then hurry up.

343
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,640
I’m tired of answering other people's questions now.

344
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,560
They have been following me around.

345
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,840
Even more than how I follow you.

346
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,160
And why is that?

347
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,400
Don’t forget that

348
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,960
right now, I’m on satellite surveillance duty.

349
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,920
I can track you.

350
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,000
I’m here to warn you.

351
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,240
I’m here to warn you.

352
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,960
Come to think of it.

353
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,360
This planet is plain.

354
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,240
And

355
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,840
there’s no point in us staying for a long time.

356
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,880
That isn't true.

357
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,160
Yeah. Yeah. Whatever.

358
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:18,840
Here.

359
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,320
Take it.

360
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,600
I brought it for you.

361
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,960
You may have nothing to eat.

362
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,000
I must go now.

363
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,000
Hurry up and destroy this planet, then come back quickly.

364
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,040
Hurry up and destroy this planet, then come back quickly.

365
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,240
I will go now.

366
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,440
Heh.

367
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,040
Of course, I have.

368
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,680
There are delicious foods here, after all.

369
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,440
Dim!

370
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,920
Tan.

371
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,320
I told you that I don't want the coffee anymore.

372
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,920
Please take it.

373
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,480
If you don't

374
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,640
I’ll lose a whole glass's worth of income.

375
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,160
Please buy it.

376
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,560
Pretty please.

377
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,000
I do this much and you won’t buy my coffee?

378
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,880
I do this much and you won’t buy my coffee?

379
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,800
What are your looking for?

380
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,200
Mimiw.

381
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,520
Have you seen him?

382
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,800
Oh.

383
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,200
Mimiw

384
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,320
Mimiw?

385
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,880
Mimiw.

386
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,520
Where is he? Maybe I had seen him?

387
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,880
Do you see it?

388
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,680
Do you want to know the answer?

389
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,560
If you want to know then

390
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,440
order my coffee first!

391
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,120
Hey.

392
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,160
I was kidding!

393
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,000
I haven’t seen him.

394
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,640
I haven’t seen him.

395
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,320
Just that.

396
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,200
Here.

397
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,680
Take it back.

398
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,560
Huh?

399
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,640
Wait! Dim!

400
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,920
Wrong side!

401
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,680
Come back and help me first!

402
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,840
It's a wrong side!

403
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,680
Dim!!

404
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,080
Come back! I can’t take it off.

405
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,840
Help me!

406
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,600
Sigh

407
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,640
Ah.

408
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:31,920
Sigh.

409
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,600
Why it's so tiring living on this planet?

410
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,200
Sigh.

411
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,880
Or should I hurry up and blow up this planet?

412
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,400
Then go back to working in the cold comfortable room.

413
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,880
As it was before?

414
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:49,800
Hm.

415
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,440
Hm.

416
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,520
Hm.

417
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,240
Sigh.

418
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,000
Wow.

419
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,680
Why is it looks so delicious?

420
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,320
Oh wow.

421
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,800
Wow!

422
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,160
Wow!

423
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,960
Look so delicious.

424
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,640
Meow.

425
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,520
Meow.

426
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,120
Heh-heh.

427
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,920
Hm.

428
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,760
Meow.

429
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,200
Meow. Meow.

430
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,720
Hey!

431
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,000
What are you doing?

432
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,640
What are you doing?

433
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,240
Why are you staring at me?

434
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,960
This is my food, Not yours.

435
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,800
Pff.

436
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,640
I won’t eat your food!

437
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,000
Because I'm a cat.

438
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,800
I must eat cat food.

439
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,120
Heh.

440
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,680
But it smells really good.

441
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,560
I agree.

442
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,480
Hey,

443
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,440
by the way.

444
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,960
At your planet

445
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,680
what type of food did you have?

446
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,440
My planet?

447
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,000
Hm.

448
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,480
Hm.

449
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,640
Hm.

450
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,160
Capsule.

451
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,520
Huh?

452
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,880
Capsule?

453
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,720
Mm!

454
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,680
Oh!

455
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,360
We are the same.

456
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:40,720
Huh?

457
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,440
We also eat capsules on my planet.

458
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,640
So that's mean that

459
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,480
in this world

460
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,320
they have different foods from other planets.

461
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,960
Oh.

462
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,200
Hm. Sigh.

463
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,520
By the way.

464
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,240
You’re lucky.

465
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,040
Hm.

466
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,000
I got to eat a lot of different kinds of strange food.

467
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,640
I got to eat a lot of different kinds of strange food.

468
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,400
Unlike me.

469
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,120
Eating only cat food.

470
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,560
So boring.

471
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,360
Well.

472
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,560
You are

473
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,600
a cat.

474
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,640
Heh-heh.

475
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,760
Hm.

476
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,160
That smells good.

477
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,080
Why? Are you hungry?
You have a lot more.

478
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,160
I want to try it.

479
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:20,720
Just small pieces.

480
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,200
Small piece.

481
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,200
But this is human food.

482
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,360
You are hungry, right?

483
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,960
It's made from fish. I can eat it.

484
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,000
Heh-heh.

485
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,320
Heh-heh.

486
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,000
Hm.

487
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,920
Smells good.

488
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,600
Aha.

489
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,400
Ah, I understand.

490
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,400
I understand now.

491
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,280
Here.

492
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,200
Take this.

493
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,480
Open it.

494
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,520
What is this?

495
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,520
Ah!

496
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:47,960
Capsule?

497
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,560
Yes, capsule.

498
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,640
You brought it with you?

499
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,360
Yes, I have some left.

500
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,800
Oh well.

501
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,280
You can keep it for yourself.

502
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,480
It's alright. I have my food here.

503
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,000
You can eat the capsule.

504
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,960
You can eat the capsule.

505
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,560
Capsule?

506
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,680
So that we can eat together

507
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,120
Mm.

508
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,720
So delicious.

509
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,640
Hm.

510
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,360
Mm!

511
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,840
This thing is really good.

512
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,280
Have a good taste.

513
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,880
I don't know how they cook it.

514
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,240
Oh wow.

515
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,680
Heh-heh

516
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,720
Why don't you eat the capsule?

517
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,960
Come on. Eat it.

518
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,000
Hm.

519
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,240
Hm.

520
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,440
Come to think of it.

521
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,920
I haven’t eaten it in a long time.

522
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,560
Hm.

523
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,280
I don't even remember the taste of it.

524
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,720
Already forgot.

525
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,720
Hm.

526
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,000
But

527
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,280
it doesn't look delicious

528
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,840
like that you're eating.

529
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,640
Are you full?

530
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,480
Eat it.

531
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,560
Come on.

532
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,760
Hm.

533
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,160
Finally.

534
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,000
Aha.

535
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,720
Aha.

536
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,640
How is it?

537
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,120
It's stiff.

538
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:02,720
Stiff?

539
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,240
Yes.

540
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:03,920
Then try to swallow it.

541
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,440
My throat feels dry.

542
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,720
Swallow it.
I cannot.

543
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,280
Cannot?

544
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,000
Mm.

545
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,760
Then lift your head up.

546
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,200
Aha!

547
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,520
Let me help you.

548
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,280
Not yet?

549
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,000
Not yet?

550
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,600
Help!

551
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,440
It stuck in my throat.

552
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:13,960
It stuck in my throat.

553
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,720
Can’t swallow yet?

554
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,400
It stuck in my throat!

555
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,080
Hm.

556
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,400
Hm.
Hm!

557
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,040
Swallow it.

558
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,960
Swallow it!

559
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,560
Hey!

560
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,040
Come on! Swallow it.

561
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,560
Hey! Hey!
Swallow it!

562
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:28,720
Huh?

563
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,920
What are you doing?

564
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,000
You must be so scared.

565
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,480
You must be so scared.

566
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,640
Huh?
It's ok now.

567
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,240
I just.

568
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,440
I’m trying to help him.

569
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,280
Help?

570
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,560
You're trying to kill him!

571
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,200
What?

572
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:40,760
Wait.

573
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,000
Kill him?

574
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:42,960
Me?

575
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,640
I didn't try to kill him.

576
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,720
Well, it’s obvious!

577
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,080
There. There. It's ok now.

578
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,480
Are you scared?
Huh?

579
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,080
Wait. No. No.

580
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,360
I was helping him.

581
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,200
Let's go.

582
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,240
I will take you home.

583
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,840
Wait.

584
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,000
Hey.

585
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,640
Hey.

586
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:03,720
Hiss.

587
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,760
Let's go home.

588
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,920
Hiss.

589
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,240
Ahem!

590
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:11,840
Ah!

591
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,800
Huh?

592
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,640
What?

593
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,240
Oh.

594
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,200
You.

595
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,160
Hey, you.

596
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,440
Why are you dressing up to mock me?

597
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,960
What? No, I’m not mocking you.

598
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,000
This is my working costume.

599
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,160
This is my working costume.

600
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,720
Oh,

601
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,320
by the way.

602
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,080
Did you came from

603
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,320
the planet Mau like Mimiw?

604
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,400
Sigh.

605
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,160
You can say that.

606
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,680
That's good.

607
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,320
You have a friend.

608
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,040
What do you mean by that?

609
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,440
Well,

610
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,200
you have friends too, coming from the same planet.

611
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,800
Unlike me. I have no friends

612
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,400
that came from the same planet.

613
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,280
Are you sure?

614
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,280
I’m sure.

615
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:06,920
Is that so?

616
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,640
It is.

617
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,120
That's not true.

618
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,880
I saw you

619
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,080
staying at the human house.

620
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,840
The one that opens a restaurant.

621
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:15,880
How did you know?

622
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,840
Of course I know!

623
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,560
I’m Ngao!

624
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,040
The genius!

625
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,080
I know everything in this planet.

626
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,480
Oh.

627
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,160
Everything huh?

628
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,320
You can say that.

629
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,760
What?

630
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,000
You mock me twice already.

631
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,640
You mock me twice already.

632
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,360
Oh and

633
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,880
is he kind?

634
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,000
Are you talking about the humans who sell food?

635
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:44,800
Hm.

636
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,480
Heh.

637
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,080
Sigh.

638
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,160
Huh?

639
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,840
By the way, how long have you been here?

640
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,040
Very long.

641
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,560
But

642
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,240
I have no home to live.

643
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,600
Unlike that round-headed orange cat."

644
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,120
The one with a funny face.

645
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,400
But I think he looks like you.

646
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,480
Thank you.

647
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,400
That's the third time already.

648
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,720
Third times.

649
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,760
Oh.

650
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,200
Whatever.

651
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,800
However, I

652
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,480
don't like having an owner.

653
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,960
An owner?

654
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,480
Yes,

655
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,000
I like being alone.

656
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,760
I like being alone.

657
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,480
If you want to live in this planet

658
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,360
you must have an owner.

659
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,520
If not, you will become a stray.

660
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:39,960
Hm?

661
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,640
Stray?

662
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,200
How stray?

663
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,000
Wandering around.

664
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,000
No home to live.

665
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,920
No home to live.

666
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,560
No bed.

667
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,360
If it rains,

668
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,680
you have to find a pile of garbage
to take shelter from the rain.

669
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,440
When I'm hungry

670
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,320
I have to wait for a kind person to bring me food.

671
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,720
If no one gives me

672
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,240
I have to find it in the trash.

673
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,560
Talking about it makes me feel sad.

674
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,000
Crying.

675
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,040
Crying.

676
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,240
Hm.

677
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,000
Oh,

678
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,160
fish smell.

679
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,200
Can you smell it?

680
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,400
I start to feel hungry now.

681
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,880
Then I'd better go get something to eat.

682
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,720
A cat like me has dignity.

683
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,240
I don't eat food from human hands.

684
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,000
Must be only trash.

685
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,160
Meow!

686
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,840
Hey!

687
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,240
Oh.

688
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,800
Sigh.

689
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,760
Hm.

690
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,040
We are home.

691
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,280
Just a moment.

692
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,120
Hm.

693
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,000
Uncle.

694
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,120
Oh.

695
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,400
Mimiw?

696
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,800
Come here.

697
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,320
Gently. Gently.

698
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,560
Here. I prepared your food.

699
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,000
Go ahead.

700
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,800
This one is really stubborn.

701
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,320
Why don't you eat?

702
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,720
Look at that. Why so small bite?

703
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,160
Next time, if you don’t eat, I have to punish you
so you’ll learn.

704
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,280
So stubborn.

705
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,720
Look at him.
I think.

706
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:16,880
Sigh

707
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,000
He is walking away.

708
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,920
Look at him.

709
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,720
I think he isn’t hungry yet.

710
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,000
This cat is bad.

711
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,880
But thank you.

712
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,000
You’re neither my child nor my grandchild.

713
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,680
You’re neither my child nor my grandchild.

714
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,640
But you always care for me.

715
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,840
I'm happy to help, Uncle.

716
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,400
Because you’re an elder.

717
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,920
And you live alone.

718
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,680
Oh and

719
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,840
have you eaten the food that I brought you this morning?

720
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,240
Oh,

721
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,440
I will eat together with Mimiw.

722
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,000
You can go do your work.

723
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,080
You can go do your work.

724
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,760
Don’t worry about me.

725
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,280
Well then,

726
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,040
I’ll take my leave now.

727
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,920
See you later.

728
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,880
Sigh.

729
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,440
So messy.

730
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,880
I should hurry and finish my last meal.

731
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,400
Then

732
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,760
I will blow up this planet.

733
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,240
Hm.

734
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,240
Mm.

735
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,720
So good.

736
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,040
Sigh.

737
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,720
I cannot.

738
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,440
If we blow up this planet

739
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,160
Then I  won’t be able to eat delicious food.

740
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,360
Sigh.

741
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,360
Sigh.

742
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,600
Hey!

743
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,000
Hm.

744
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,840
Hm.

745
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,000
Mm.

746
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,480
Hey

747
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,240
How did you get here?

748
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,040
I'm afraid someone might get lost.

749
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,400
So I come to check on you.

750
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,160
Hm?

751
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,280
Are you taking a break to eat?

752
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,200
Mm.

753
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,360
Why eat only that one?

754
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,880
Why don't you eat them all?

755
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,720
I went through the effort of cooking them for you.

756
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,240
Here. You have to eat them together.

757
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,000
Together like this.

758
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,440
Together like this.

759
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,600
It will make them more delicious.

760
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,360
Try it.

761
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,240
Hm.

762
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,960
Mm!

763
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,360
It's really delicious!

764
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,160
Hey.

765
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,600
Give me.

766
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,080
Hm!

767
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:18,560
What?

768
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,080
Hey!

769
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:19,680
Wait! Wait!

770
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,440
Stop! Stop!

771
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,680
Calm down.

772
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,440
Hey!
Give me some!

773
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,880
It's difficult for you.

774
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,760
I’ll feed you myself.

775
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,600
Stay still.

776
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,880
You might strain Tan’s costume.

777
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,320
Hey.

778
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,440
What?

779
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,160
Can you be my owner?

780
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,960
What?

781
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,560
Be my owner, can you?

782
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,320
What owner?

783
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,720
What do you mean?

784
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I don't want to be a stray.

785
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I don't want to be a stray.

786
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,280
I want to have a bed.

787
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,080
To have a delicious food to eat.

788
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,600
I’d like you to feed me every day.

789
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,240
Well, if you don’t have anywhere to go

790
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,360
you can stay with me for now.

791
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,200
Really?

792
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,360
Hm.

793
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,000
Yay!

794
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Yay!

795
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,080
That's good!

796
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,240
Then I’ve already decided!

797
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,600
I’ve decided that I won’t blow up this planet yet.

798
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,560
And you

799
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,600
feed me every day.

800
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,640
Won’t blow up this planet?

801
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,080
Must feed you everyday?

802
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,400
It’s like I’m cooking to save the world, huh?

803
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,480
Please.

804
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,200
Fine.

805
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,480
Yay!

806
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,640
Yeah.

807
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,720
Yay!

808
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,520
Really?

809
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,760
I finally have an owner!

810
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,880
Hehe.

811
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,240
Do you want to keep eating?

812
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,240
Yes!

813
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,040
Would you like a chicken feet?

814
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:08,680
Yes!
