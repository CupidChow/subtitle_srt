1
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,800
I'm going to push the button!

2
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,760
Wow!

3
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,360
Hey!

4
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,200
What?

5
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,200
You!

6
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,280
How did you get into my house!

7
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,560
Oh!

8
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,960
There.

9
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,200
So someone's door was opened.

10
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,760
And you just walked inside?!

11
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,680
Aha.

12
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,960
Oh. Oh,

13
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,440
What smell was that?

14
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,440
It smells so good.

15
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,520
Hey you!

16
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,120
It's not a joke!

17
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,000
You came into my house. what do you want?

18
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,640
You came into my house. what do you want?

19
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,920
I’m hungry.

20
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,200
Again?

21
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,560
Yes.

22
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,320
Can you treat me to a meal?

23
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,720
Can I treat you to a meal?

24
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,960
And who are you? Why should I do that? 

25
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,800
Not an elder.

26
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,800
Nor pregnant women.

27
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,240
Oh.

28
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,480
You are a crazy man then.

29
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,720
Hm?

30
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,280
Leave.

31
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,120
Why haven’t you gone home? It's already late.

32
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,920
Why?

33
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,320
I cannot go back.

34
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,200
If I do

35
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,520
I will face something bad.

36
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,800
What do you mean by that?

37
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,440
Because haven’t finished my mission yet.

38
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,000
And I have lied to them.

39
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,080
And I have lied to them.

40
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,360
Ah.

41
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,080
Now I know

42
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,120
that your family

43
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,040
Is like

44
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,640
placing high expectations on you.

45
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,720
Hm.

46
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,080
Can you treat me to a meal, please?

47
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,520
A meal right?

48
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,680
Yes.

49
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,040
Fine!

50
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,920
But you owe me twice.

51
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,480
Ok.

52
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,000
Go wait outside.

53
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,920
Go wait outside.

54
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,040
I will bring the food for you.

55
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,160
Oh, of course.

56
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,960
Are you trying to get on my nerves?

57
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,680
I told you to wait outside.

58
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,480
Do want to have food or something else?

59
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,720
Well, I’m sitting here.

60
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,840
Outside the kitchen!

61
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,960
Oh.

62
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,840
Hurry up ok?

63
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,000
Hurry up.

64
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,160
Hurry up.

65
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,200
Hurry up?

66
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,760
Asked for free and dare to order me?

67
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,960
God.

68
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,080
What are you looking for? 

69
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,000
You come this far.

70
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,320
You come this far.

71
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,360
Feel free to eat it.

72
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,320
Go ahead.

73
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,760
Don't tell me that you don't know how to use chopsticks?

74
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,880
Form your face

75
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,240
you don't seem like a guy who cannot use it.

76
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,440
Same as you.

77
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,920
Why this food is different from the ones in the morning?

78
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,960
Those were for selling.

79
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,120
Well it's like this.

80
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,840
The life of the owner of Chan Dan restaurant.

81
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,360
Handsome.

82
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,040
Kind.

83
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,320
Charming.

84
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,640
But unfortunately 

85
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,360
single.

86
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,640
Is that so?

87
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,120
Hurry up and eat!

88
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,560
Before I finish it all!

89
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,640
Yay!

90
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,360
Finally!

91
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,880
Mm!

92
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,760
Oh!

93
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,320
So delicious!

94
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,040
This grass is really good!

95
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,320
It's a vegetable!

96
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,440
What do you mean by a grass?

97
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,200
Are you a cow?

98
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,840
Oh.

99
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,680
Vegetable?

100
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,880
In my hometown, we call it grass.

101
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,240
You call it grass?

102
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:57,960
Um.

103
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,560
Where is your hometown huh?

104
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,800
Well.

105
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,280
It's far.

106
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,640
Roi Et?

107
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,920
Ah. Maybe not.

108
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,080
Hungry like this?

109
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,640
Chai Meang?

110
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,640
Hm?

111
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,520
Why didn't you correct my joke?

112
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,480
I said Chai Meang. You must say Chiang Mai!

113
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,960
How could you not know this joke?

114
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,080
It's very popular!

115
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:21,840
Come on try.

116
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,640

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,520

118
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,360
Yeah!

119
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,360
Chai Riang

120
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,120
Chai Riang?

121
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,520
Chiang Rai.

122
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:29,920
Chiang.

123
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,000
Chai.

124
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,360
Chai.

125
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:30,760

126
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,760
Chai. Like this.

127
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,520
Chai Riang.

128
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,720
Chiang Rai.

129
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,920
Chai noi.

130
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,680
Pi, Pojaman.

131
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,720
You like it see?

132
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,320
Eat up. 

133
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,160
The same menu again.

134
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,680
Don't you have something else?

135
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,960
Aw. You like this menu hm?

136
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,840
Eat up!

137
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,000
Don't understand what I said?

138
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,160
Don't understand what I said?

139
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,840
Come.

140
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,840
Eat up.

141
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,200
Gotcha!

142
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,280
What are you doing, Dim?

143
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,320
I’m looking at him eating.

144
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,640
Hm. 

145
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,000
True.

146
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,240
Aw. So cute!

147
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,160
What for?

148
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,520
Oh, he eats a lot.

149
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,840
I didn't!

150
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,880
Here.

151
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,680
Eat up!

152
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,960
Pff!

153
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,000
And what are you doing here?

154
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,760
It's late why don't you go home?

155
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,520
Are you worried about me?

156
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,760
God.

157
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,600
I’m just kidding.

158
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,760
Today, I went to uncle's house.

159
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,760
And

160
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,960
I went to see Mimiw.

161
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:43,920
And played with Mimiw.

162
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,800
Then I went to help my boss close the shop late.

163
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,760
After I went to help him late. 

164
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,680
He told me

165
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,080
to do the laundry

166
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,720
wash the dishes

167
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,160
clean the tables.

168
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,160
Then I walked home.

169
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:50,720
Walking home late.

170
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,440
I didn't get the OT.

171
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,160
Coffee is also not selling well.

172
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,400
Enough.

173
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,520
Tan.

174
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,880
Tomorrow I don't want your coffee.

175
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:57,960
Huh?

176
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,120
Why?

177
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,000
Hey! Wait! Dim!

178
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,480
Hey! Wait! Dim!

179
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,560
Don't go yet!

180
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,320
Talk to me first!

181
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,240
Don't shut the door!

182
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,160
Oops.

183
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,640
Got dumped.

184
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,000
What's wrong with him? 

185
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:08,920
Hey!

186
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,160
Stay still!

187
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,240
Don't pet me!

188
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,200
Hey! Don't go!

189
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:12,720
Don't touch me!

190
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,200
Hey!

191
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,960
I said stop!
Where are you going?

192
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,360
No!

193
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,200
Don’t pet me!

194
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,640
Come on no stuttering.

195
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,000
You were stuttering.

196
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,320
Chai Meang?

197
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:18,880
Chiang Mai!

198
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,520
Chai Riang?

199
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,000
Chiang Rai!

200
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,440
Chai Si?

201
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:20,880
MiGyo!

202
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,480
Chai noi?

203
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,800
Pi, Pojaman!

204
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,880
Yeah.

205
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,120
Pi, Pojaman with more action.

206
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,240
Pi, Pojaman! Like this.

207
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,040
More?

208
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,800
Chai noi?

209
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,000
Pi, Pojaman!

210
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,080
Pi, Pojaman!

211
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,320
Good! Not bad.

212
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,200
Um.

213
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,760
You don't have the juice like this morning?

214
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,080
It was very good.

215
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,240
Hey you.

216
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,680
You came asking for free food.

217
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,840
Yet you still ask for more?

218
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,160
Don't you know what consideration is?

219
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,600
No, now we don't have the juice.

220
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,840
This is all we have.

221
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,080
If you want to drink it, come again tomorrow.

222
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,160
But.

223
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:56,720
Hm?

224
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,120
You must pay this time.

225
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,280
Money?

226
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,000
Yes.

227
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,240
Yes.

228
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,600
What is money?

229
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,240
I don't have it.

230
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,800
Are you kidding me?

231
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,600
Do you want me to teach you one more joke?

232
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,040
Money is what gives us the power to spend on something we need.

233
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,320
Like food.

234
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,120
Or become a millionaire.

235
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,880
Who wants to be a millionaire?

236
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,320
You don't know this one?

237
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,920
This joke?

238
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,600
Oh, it's me. Oh, it's me.

239
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,960
When I sing Who wants to be a millionaire?

240
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,880
You sing. Oh, it's me. Oh, it's me.

241
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,640
Understand?

242
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,120
Yes.

243
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,000
Who wants to be a millionaire?

244
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,400
Who wants to be a millionaire?

245
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,280
Oh, it's me. Oh, it's me.

246
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,640
Who wants to have a bus?

247
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,600
Oh, it's me. Oh, it's me.

248
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,880
Who wants to be a tycoon?

249
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,880
Oh, it's me. Oh, it's me.

250
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,320
Good!

251
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,760
Many jokes today.

252
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,840
Don’t you like it?

253
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,120
I can't remember.

254
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,120
Go home safely.

255
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,720
If you want to have my cooking again tomorrow 

256
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,880
you can come.

257
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,000
Chan Dan’s restaurant is welcome

258
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,080
Yes.

259
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,720
whenever you are hungry.

260
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,040
Chan Dan is not joking.

261
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,680
What?

262
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,120
Hey?

263
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,400
Do you want to say something to me?

264
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,800
No?

265
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,920
See you then.

266
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,440
Hey, you?

267
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,160
Hey!

268
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,120
Did you lock the door?

269
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,400
Hey?

270
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,560
Gotcha!

271
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,640
No one?

272
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,840
Fine.

273
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,480
Gosh!

274
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,440
I'll press the bomb and kill them all at once!

275
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,200
God.

276
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,440
Ouch! It bites me again!

277
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,760
Stop it, please.

278
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,360
Your coffee is here!

279
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,920
Hm.

280
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,080
Thank you for your order.

281
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,040
My handsome bro!

282
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,480
Can I not order?

283
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,240
You are my regular customer.

284
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,800
It's like a fixed deposit.

285
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,440
Once you deposit you cannot withdraw.

286
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,200
Hehe.

287
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,840
Please give me the change.

288
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,000
Oh.

289
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,760
Oh! Boss?

290
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,560
I’m coming! I’m coming!
Tan!

291
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,040
Just a minute boss!

292
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,840
Tan! This joke is old!

293
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,320
The coffee is more expensive every day.

294
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,760
Hm.

295
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,120
It's good though.

296
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,840
Where did he go?

297
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,280
Hey! You!

298
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,000
You dress well but

299
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,280
why were you sleeping here?

300
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,400
Why didn't you go home?

301
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,640
You.

302
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,280
Can you treat me to a coffee?

303
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,640
Can you treat me to a coffee?

304
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,760
Treat what?

305
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,240
Can you?

306
00:16:59,240 --> 00:16:59,840
Hey!

307
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,000
Are you just gonna ask for that easily?

308
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,080
Are you just gonna ask for that easily?

309
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,000
Huh?

310
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,800
Hm.

311
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,240
What? Do you want this?

312
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,120
Mm.

313
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,840
Do you want it?

314
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,920
Dim!

315
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,200
This is your coffee!

316
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,800
Whose coffee is that?

317
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,240
Mine is better.

318
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,440
My coffee is much better!

319
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,040
That one you could put it away.

320
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,000
Hey!

321
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,160
Hey!

322
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,200
Oh!

323
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,240
Ah!

324
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,960
Oh!

325
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,800
So good!

326
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,720
Very good!

327
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,960
It's truly worthy of being the coffee of the world!

328
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,440
Correct!

329
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,080
No coffee on earth is better than mine.

330
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,560
You have a very good taste!

331
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,840
Mm!

332
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,640
Is it delicious?

333
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,640
Yes!

334
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,200
Very good!

335
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,920
Both are crazy.

336
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,160
Hey!

337
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,080
Dim!

338
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:56,920
Hold on!

339
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,040
I will go get a new one for you!

340
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,000
Wait a minute!

341
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,040
Wait a minute!

342
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,920
I don't want it.

343
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,400
What the?
Hm.

344
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,000
Please report progress.

345
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,800
Um.

346
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,400
Um.

347
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,760
Please report progress.

348
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:22,760
Um.

349
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,440
Well.

350
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,120
So um.

351
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,720
I think it was the engineer who came down before me.

352
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,000
He must have miscalculated the space kilomiles.

353
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,720
He must have miscalculated the space kilomiles.

354
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,400
That's impossible.

355
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,880
It's possible. 

356
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,840
Please believe me.

357
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,480
I'm the only one at the earth right now.

358
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,600
If I press the button

359
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,400
there is a chance 

360
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,040
that the explosion effects will affect our planet.

361
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,920
And what is your plan?

362
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,720
Um.

363
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,360
I will do some research first.

364
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,520
Then I will report the process to you.

365
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,320
Alright.

366
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,000
I hope you will accomplish the mission.

367
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,600
I hope you will accomplish the mission.

368
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,040
Or else 

369
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,920
I will send another operator instead.

370
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,760
Yes, Sir.

371
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,000
Please bless me with a lot of customers today, Grandma.

372
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,040
Please bless me with a lot of customers today, Grandma.

373
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,960
Don't just stand there and smile.

374
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,280
What the!

375
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,520
Oh god!

376
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,880
They look so delicious!

377
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,600
Well, of course.

378
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,920
Mm.

379
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,400
Hey.

380
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,240
You.

381
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,200
Last night did you go home?

382
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,320
And where did you sleep?

383
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,360
Where would it be?

384
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,640
He slept underneath the tree.

385
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,040
So.

386
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,960
Well.

387
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,560
Do you guys know each other?

388
00:19:59,080 --> 00:19:59,880
No.

389
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,960
I just accidentally met him.

390
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,480
I saw him sleeping under the tree.

391
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,080
And once again.

392
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,960
He stole my coffee.

393
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,000
I guess he likes it.

394
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,600
I do like it.

395
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,120
Hm.

396
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,920
And why didn't you go home?

397
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,920
Well.

398
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,080
You didn't let me stay with you.

399
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,360
What?!

400
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,600
It's not like that you think!

401
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,320
Last night you asked for free food.

402
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,320
When you finished you must go home.

403
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,640
I think I might be unemployed, bro.

404
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,720
Whatever.

405
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,960
It's none of my business.

406
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,160
Today I would like to have

407
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,000
this one, this and fried egg please.

408
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,520
Right away.

409
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,680
Alright.

410
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,760
And you.

411
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,880
If you want to eat the food

412
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,040
you must pay today.

413
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,640
What?

414
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,200
Hey.

415
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,880
If you aren't in hurry 

416
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,600
step aside.

417
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,560
So others could order.

418
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,800
What would you like to order?

419
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,400
Here you go, bro.

420
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,000
Thank you.

421
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,320
Thank you.

422
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,520
Enjoy.

423
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,560
What would you like to order?

424
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,400
Not yours.

425
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,720
Massaman curry right?

426
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,680
Anything else?

427
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,520
Right away.

428
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,320
Please have a seat and wait.

429
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,200
I will get it for you.

430
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,480
Chan Dan!

431
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,560
This is so delicious!

432
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:29,640
Heh.

433
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,640
Of course.

434
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,920
Enjoy your meal.

435
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,320
It's good.

436
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,720
Why haven't you ordered?

437
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,880
You are broke huh?

438
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,720
Woo.

439
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,240
You are on the way.

440
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,800
You.

441
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,440
Can you treat me to a meal?

442
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,440
No.

443
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,840
I told you if you want to eat you must pay for it.

444
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,720
Do you have money?

445
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,720
Step aside. The customers are here.

446
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,080
What would you like to order?

447
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,360
But I’m hungry.

448
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,120
Please.

449
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,200
Hey.

450
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,800
If you want to eat, you have to wait in line.

451
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,760
Dear customer, I have to-

452
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,400
But I'm hungry.

453
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,400
So hungry.

454
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,600
Go wait in line. I have a lot of customers.

455
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,360
What would you like to order?

456
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,400
Just um ignore him.

457
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,120
You can order.

458
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:14,840
Hm.

459
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,720
I'll have Massaman curry and an omelet.

460
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,560
Massaman curry and an omelet.

461
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,040
Right away.

462
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:19,520
Just a moment, please.

463
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,040
Bamboo shoot, please.

464
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,640
Again, please?

465
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,200
Bamboo shoot, please.

466
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:21,880
Ok.

467
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:22,920
Right away.

468
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,840
Just a moment.

469
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:24,800
I will get it for you.

470
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,880
You can wait at the table.

471
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,320
I will get it for you.

472
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,280
Hey.

473
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,720
You are annoying. Do you know that?

474
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,480
I already told you.

475
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,440
If you don’t have money, then you cannot eat.

476
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,320
I gave you for free so many time.

477
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,120
Please.

478
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,440
Please, I’m hungry.

479
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,680
Hey.

480
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,080
Oh god.

481
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,240
Please.

482
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,040
There.

483
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,520
There is a customer in line.

484
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,560
If you want to eat then wait on the line. 

485
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:49,880
Move.

486
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,120
Behind there, what would you like to have?

487
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,080
You may order.

488
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,320
What would you like to have?

489
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,200
I.

490
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,000
Would.

491
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,200
Have.

492
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,200

495
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,040
Sa.

496
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,800
Man.

497
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,720
Chicken.

498
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,000
Chicken Massaman.

499
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,080
Right away.

500
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,160
Yes.

501
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,280
You can order faster.

502
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,280
And.

503
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,640
Do you need anything else?

504
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,520
You can order a bit faster.

505
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,880
I can catch up with you.

506
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,000
Want.

507
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,240
A.

508
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,560
Fried egg?

509
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,080
Omelet.

510
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,280
Ah, wrong.

511
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,480
Omelet then.

512
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,520
Yes.

513
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,040
Here.

514
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:17,880
That all.

515
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,080
Two of them are enough.

516
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,240
There you go.

517
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,240
You can eat first and then pay.

518
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,720
Smell good.

519
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,360
Enjoy your meal.

520
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,440
You may go.

521
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,800
Please go ahead and enjoy.

522
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,560
Ha.

523
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,360
Ha.

524
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,160
Ha.

525
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,720
Thank.

526
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,840
You.

527
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,000
Was that your laughing?

528
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,720
Was that your laughing?

529
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,200
Oh. My apologies.

530
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,640
Please forget that I ask.

531
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,120
You may go enjoy your meal.

532
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,200
Come.

533
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,480
Come this way.

534
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,360
Wow.

535
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,880
What a guy.

536
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,120
Even his laughing was in slow motion.

537
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,080
Here.

538
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,000
Bro.

539
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,960
Thank you.

540
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,280
I will go open my shop now.

541
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,320
You keep going ok?

542
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,240
sit

543
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,000
Today must be a tiring day.

544
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,360
Today must be a tiring day.

545
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,840
Yeah, I think so.

546
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,160
You keep up the good work as well.

547
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,400
Hey.

548
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,320
Why don't you drink Tan’s coffee?

549
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,560
Be careful, she might come and cry at you.

550
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,640
It tastes bad.

551
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,280
Come on just give her some compliments.

552
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,920
I will take my leave now.

553
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,000
Good luck. See you around.
See you around.

554
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,360
Here.

555
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,800
I put your stuff in order.

556
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,000
Hey!

557
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,320
Hey!

558
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,360
You.

559
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,120
Wh?

560
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,360
What?

561
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,800
Yes?

562
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,880
You um.

563
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,160
You!

564
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,280
You seem familiar.

565
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,680
I know it.

566
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,320
M.

567
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,560
Me?

568
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,640
Hm.

569
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,640
What?

570
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,000
Here.

571
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,520
This.

572
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,200
Let me put it there.

573
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:40,960
You.

574
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,000
You are from Solo Planet, right?

575
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,960
You.

576
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,960
K.

577
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,200
Know.

578
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,240
U.

579
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,760
U.

580
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,920
Us?

581
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,920
Yes.

582
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,680
Yes?

583
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,320
Yes.

584
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,600
You are very obvious.

585
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:11,840
Yes.

586
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,160

00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,840
See?

590
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,960
Ha.

591
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,600
Ha.

592
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,000
Ha.

593
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,320
Ha.

594
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,560
He likes to laugh huh?

595
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,360
Do you want to eat?

596
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:36,720

597
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,400
Let me help.

598
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,000

599
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,680
Garb it.

600
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,360
Yes.

601
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,280
So you come from Solo Planet, right?

602
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,480
Hey.

603
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,800
You.

604
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,280
Can I ask you something?

605
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,880
Why are you here on earth?

606
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,160
Why are you here on earth?

607
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,880
Hm?

608
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:00,600
Hm?

609
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,320
Yeah?

610
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:02,920
It.

611
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,640
D.

612
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,520
Delicious!

613
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,680
Everyone is looking at us.

614
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,080
Um.

615
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,280
You don't speak anymore?

616
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,160
Oh.

617
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,240
Delicious.

618
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,240
So 

619
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,440

620
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,680
because there are delicious foods?

621
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,640
It's possible.

622
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:35,640
Oh!

623
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,000
Hey.

624
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,960
They have to use um.

625
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,320
Um money?

626
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,040
Money for exchange.

627
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,520
Um.

628
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,280
Do you have some for me?

629
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Huh?

630
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,640
No reply.

631
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,640
So do you have it or not?

632
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,080
T.

633
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,240
Thief.

634
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,240
It's just.

635
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,040
Isn't it just 

636
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,760

637
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,680
Hm.

638
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:30,960
Hm.

639
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,640
I'm leaving.

640
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,520
W.

641
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,000
W.

642
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,200
W.

643
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,840
What.

644
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,240

645
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,320
What is happening here?

646
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,600
Why everyone

647
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,000
comes here.

648
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,360
comes here.

649
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,760
The food here is that delicious?

650
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,720
Delicious enough to make everyone moves here?

651
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,480
Hey!

652
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:11,960
What are you doing!

653
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,840
What?

654
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,560
Pay me for the coffee.

655
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,480
This morning you took my coffee.

656
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,400
Money?

657
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:20,440
Money.

658
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,920
Money.

659
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,560
I don't have

660
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,560
money.

661
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,480
You don't?

662
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,720
Yes.

663
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,000
Are you pulling my leg!

664
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,120
Are you pulling my leg!

665
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,360
Look at your suitcase!

666
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,160
Don’t you feel hot?

667
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,280
You cannot say that you don't have money!

668
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,920
Dim refused to pay!

669
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,360
You also drank my coffee for free!

670
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,120
I don't have it.

671
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,360
No money.

672
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,360
Here.

673
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,320
What is it?

674
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,000
Well.

675
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,440
You don't have money to pay me.

676
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,040
So you have to work for me in order to pay.

677
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,040
Huh?

678
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,520
What? Have you forgotten?

679
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,280
You drank a whole cup of my coffee.

680
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,560
If I don't have money to give to my boss

681
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,280
he would fire me!

682
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:20,760
Huh?

683
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,960
It wasn't free?

684
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,520
Free?

685
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,200
Yes.

686
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,520
Look at me! Do I look like someone who gives something for free?

687
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,480
Whatever!

688
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,000
If you don't pay

689
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,960
If you don't pay

690
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,320
then I will report it to the police!

691
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:32,800
What?

692
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,400
Police?

693
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:34,880
Yes!

694
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:35,600
Oh no.

695
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,560
Just forgot that.

696
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,600
Let's do it this way.

697
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,160
You work for me to pay off your debt.

698
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,160
And you don't have to pay for the coffee.

699
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,360
You may even have some money to buy more!

700
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,520
Deal?

701
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,120
And.

702
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,920
Can I exchange money 

703
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,160
with food?

704
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,320
Exchange for food?

705
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:52,960
Yes.

706
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,920
Of course!

707
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,280
No more questions!

708
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,680
Go start your work! 

709
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,960
So much stuff.

710
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,000
Hey! Careful!

711
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,520
Hm.

712
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,480
Go! Go!

713
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,400
Pick up the headpiece.

714
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,040
Hey!

715
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,160
I cannot see anything!

716
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,480
Can you see now?

717
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,240
And this. Hand them over to them ok?

718
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,240
Who? Where?

719
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,320
Give it to someone walking by.

720
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,800
There! There! They're coming!

721
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,400
Hand it to them?

722
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,560
H-here!
Just like that!

723
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,240
Here's a flyer.
You can take it.

724
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,040
Hello.

725
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,440
Who is that?

726
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,360
Hand it out! One by one!

727
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,320
Flyer!

728
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,800

729
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,240
Here! Here! Feel free to take them!

730
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,000
There!

731
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,720
There!

732
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,320
Hey. Flyer.

733
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,040
Flyer here.
Feel free to take it!

734
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,840
Flyer here.

735
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,080
Hello.
Feel free to take it!

736
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,280
Flyer here.

737
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,480
Flyer.

738
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,640
Joe!

739
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,000
I told you to get a student haircut!

740
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,600
And what is this huh!

741
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,520
Come on Mom!

742
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,840
I want to be unique!

743
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,000
Unique?

744
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,760
Yeah?

745
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,440
What unique!

746
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,040
What unique huh!

747
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:18,800
Barber!

748
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,320
Don’t you see what uniform it is?

749
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,480
It's a student uniform, Ma'am.

750
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,480
Student uniform when it must be student haircuts!

751
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,280
Cut his hair again!

752
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,200
A-alright.

753
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,080
God.

754
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,160
What a slow life guy.

755
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,160
Excuse me.

756
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,040
Do you want a bill?

757
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,840
How-

758
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,000
50 baht.

759
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,480
Have you

760
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,120
had any water yet?

761
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,280
It's over there.

762
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,480
It's self-service.

763
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,800
Oh.

764
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,560
May I help you?

765
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,240
Help you.

766
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,040
Here.

767
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,000
T.

768
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,840
Thank you.

769
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,400
Thank.

770
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,440
You.

771
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,040
Tan! Hey.

772
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,200
Are you Tan?

773
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,280
You must be hungry.

774
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,240
Do you want something?

775
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,520
The food is almost gone.

776
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,400
What?

777
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,880
Why are you only nodding your head?

778
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,000
How about rice with curry?

779
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,560
How about rice with curry?

780
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,680
I will prepare them for you.

781
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,960
Do you need a lot of rice?

782
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,600
Not much then. You are quite small.

783
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,760
That's enough.

784
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:18,920
Two curry.

785
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,040
And some omelet.

786
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:27,440
And.

787
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,000
You won't take the costume off to eat?

788
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,800
You won't take the costume off to eat?

789
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,080
Hey?

790
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,280
Hello!

791
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:35,320
Hey!

792
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,000
Where are you going?

793
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,200
That wasn't you?

794
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,360
And who was that?

795
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,240
That guy!

796
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,040
Which one?

797
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,480
The one that ate here.

798
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,600
There were a lot of them.

799
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,120
Which one?

800
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,680
The one that keeps telling you to treat him to a meal.

801
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,920
Please.

802
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,800
Pretty please.

803
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,040
The one with the suit?

804
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,200
Yes, that one.

805
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,920
Again?

806
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:00,760
Gosh!

807
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,240
He is slacking off.

808
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:03,680
Hey!

809
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,160
You!

810
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,560
I forgot the drink.

811
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,640
Tan! What are you doing?

812
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,720
It fell off.

813
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,720
God.

814
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,120
Phew.

815
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,440
Phew.

816
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,560
I'm starving!

817
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,360
Look so delicious!

818
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,280
Here.

819
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,560
Longan juice.

820
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:04,960
Oh my!

821
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,000
So good!

822
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,560
No need to run away.

823
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,320
It's my treat.

824
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:24,560
Oh.

825
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,120
Ok.

826
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,640
Thank you so much.

827
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,320
You must be starving.

828
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,280
Here.

829
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,000
If you are then you may eat.

830
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,160
Thank you.

831
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:37,880
I hold the drink for you.

832
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,520
You will?

833
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,640
So, have you found a job yet?

834
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,440
Job?

835
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,000
Here.

836
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,920
I’m doing it.

837
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,440
No. Not like this.

838
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,720
I mean a regular job.

839
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,000
Well.

840
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,920
Well.

841
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,880
Before I opened this restaurant, I used to work with some companies.

842
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,280
I’ve known some companies around.

843
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:11,240
So that I can recommend you 

844
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,440
some good companies.

845
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,560
Hey!

846
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,920
Slow down.

847
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,640
Water! Water!
Here! Here!

848
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,320
Delicious.

849
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,600
It's okay if you don't answer.

850
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,040
I just trying to help.

851
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,840
Enjoy your meal then.

852
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,720
I’m leaving.

853
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,640
Hey.

854
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,600
Hey!

855
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,360
You cannot help me.

856
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,800
But it's me

857
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,560
who can help you. 

858
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,240
H-hey.

859
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,160
Hey!

860
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,200
Hey!

861
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,120
Hey!

862
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,840
Wait for me!

863
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,760
Wait!

864
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,600
Hey!

865
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,440
What do you want huh?

866
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,480
Hey.

867
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:14,840
Here.

868
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,520
What?

869
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,120
I must hurry to close my restaurant.

870
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,920
Um.

871
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,400
Can I stay with you?

872
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,160
What do you mean? 

873
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,800
I mean.

874
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,560
Can I stay with you?

875
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,680
I want to eat the food you make every day.

876
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,000
Because you cook them

877
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,840
So good. 

878
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,360
Like the most delicious.

879
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,000
And what about your home?

880
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,120
And what about your home?

881
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,400
So you really won’t go home?

882
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,560
Yeah.

883
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,720
Fine.

884
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,440
You can stay at my grandma’s room.

885
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,400
But

886
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,360
I'm renting it to you.

887
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,320
It isn't for free.

888
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,040
And the reason why I let you stay

889
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,920
it was a that you complimented my food.

890
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,680
But they are really delicious.

891
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,440
I’m well aware.

892
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,760
Everyone says that.

893
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,440
But it wasn't of your compliment that I let you stay.

894
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,800
Remember that.

895
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,120
Hey!

896
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,480
Here!

897
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,120
This is your wages today.

898
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:10,880
Wait!

899
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,240
Yes?

900
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,120
This is for the coffee you drank.

901
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,480
This for commission.

902
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:26,560
As for the mine wages, I didn't work. I won’t take it.

903
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,400
Why don't you just take it all?

904
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,000
So strict.

905
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,400
So strict.

906
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,640
Can I?

907
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,680
Oh.

908
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,520
So this is the one

909
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,840
that can be exchanged for food?

910
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,640
Yes.

911
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,840
You have money now.

912
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,640
You can buy whatever you want.

913
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,800
Alright, Tan will head back now.

914
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,200
And for the costume, you can leave it here.

915
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,480
I will come get it.

916
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,360
Wait. Wait a minute.

917
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,320
What about the times I overpaid for coffee, 

918
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,840
and you didn't give the change to me?

919
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,760
Oh.

920
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,120
I must go now!

921
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:01,800
See you later!

922
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,840
I have to go!

923
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,360
Ouch!

924
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,320
I will be back!

925
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,840
Hm?

926
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,680
Notification: 1000 capsules have been deposited into your account.

927
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,320
This is my wages, isn't it?

928
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:28,520
Hey.

929
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:29,800
Hm?

930
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,200
Who are you talking to?

931
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,120
Oh. No one.

932
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,680
Come.

933
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,720
Go get change.

934
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,360
I will take you to see the room.

935
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,680
Hurry.

936
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,800
You can stay in this room for now.

937
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,240
It is quite messy.

938
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,000
But if you put things in their place, It livable.

939
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,120
Oh.

940
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,000
And about your clothes.

941
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,520
And about your clothes.

942
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,440
You have only this one?

943
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,240
Don't tell me you were wearing this under a mascot costume.

944
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:07,400
God.

945
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,920
Must be so hot as hell.

946
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:14,920
Oh and

947
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,680
don't be scared of my grandma.

948
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,200
She was kind.

949
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,520
Are you scared of ghosts?

950
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,720
And what’s your name?

951
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,640
Chun.

952
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,280
I’m Chan Dan.

953
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,880
You go take a shower first.

954
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,480
I'll lend you some clothes.

955
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:54,880
Go ahead.

956
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,960
Be my guest.

957
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,080
If you need something, just call me.

958
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:07,560
Alright.

959
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,080
Hey!

960
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,680
God!

961
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,160
Lol!

962
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,240
Hey!

963
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,480
Wait a minute!

964
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:24,520
Why?

965
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,560
What are you wearing!

966
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,520
You left this cloth in the bathroom.

967
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,240
That was my grandma's cloth.

968
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,000
Huh?

969
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,400
Huh?

970
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,160
Oh god.

971
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,120
It's alright I think.

972
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,080
Take this.

973
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,120
When you finish showing.

974
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:35,800
Put them on.

975
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,040
I brought you some clothes to borrow.

976
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,280
Oh.

977
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:39,800
Thank you.

978
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,240

979
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,880
Oh hey.

980
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,040

981
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,000
Peter?

982
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,440
Yes.

983
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:51,880

984
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,000

986
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:56,240

987
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,080
Shit! Peter?

988
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:57,720
Why are to touching it!

989
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:58,520
Let it go!

990
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,000
Why? This's Peter. My friend.

991
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,280
Why? This's Peter. My friend.

992
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,000

00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:03,760
Let it go now!

995
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,640
Or kill it!

996
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,160
I cannot! Are you crazy!

997
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,720
You know him as well!

998
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:08,600
Why would you want me to kill him!

999
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,920
I know it!

1000
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,920
But you must kill it now!

1001
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,080
No!

1002
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,080
You must kill it!

1003
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,280
Are you crazy! How could I kill him!

1004
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,520
If you don't it, then get out of my house!

1005
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:17,880
What?

1006
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:18,560
Kill it!

1007
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,680
No!

1008
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:20,840
No?

1009
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:21,640
No?

1010
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:22,320
Yes!

1011
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,560
I won't stand it!

1012
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,040
Hey!

1013
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,520
Stop!

1014
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,000
Take it!

1015
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:30,720
Take it!

1016
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,520
Loving kindness dissemination.

1017
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,240
May all beings who are my comrades in Suffering

1018
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,640
Be happy free from fear free from revenge.

1019
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,640
Hey!

1020
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:44,080
Mr.Peter is dead!

1021
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:45,600
God!

1022
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:48,320
Mr. Peter had to evacuate himself from Planet Joa.

1023
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,520
And was captured to another planet for experimentation.

1024
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,400
He would be suffering a lot!

1025
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,560
What the hell are you talking about!

1026
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:54,320
See!

1027
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,920
I send him back to his planet!

1028
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,440
He can't go back because he is dead!

1029
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,080
I don't want to talk to you anymore!

1030
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,000
Damn it!

1031
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:00,320
Damn it!

1032
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,160
Stop!

1033
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:05,640
What!

1034
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:06,320
What!
Another Mr.Peter is here.

1035
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,360
Chun!

1036
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,480
Let it go!

1037
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,200
See? He is cute.

1038
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,480
What do you mean cute?

1039
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,640
Try to touch him first.

1040
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:12,480
Hey! Careful!

1041
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,800
Hey!

1042
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,000
Let it go!

1043
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:16,720
Hey!

1044
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:17,680
Don't touch it!

1045
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,440
Don't hurt Peter!

1046
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:22,400
I can't stand it anymore!!

1047
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,560
Peter!!
