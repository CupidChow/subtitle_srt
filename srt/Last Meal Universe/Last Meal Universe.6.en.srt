1
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,800
Don’t forget to drink water.

2
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,400
How is the food?

3
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,120
What?

4
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,760
You…

5
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,160
Hm?

6
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,880
Do you love me?

7
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,480
What did you ask me?

8
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,920
Do you love me?

9
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,440
Just hurry up and finish the food.

10
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,840
Just eat.

11
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,520
And drink water.

12
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,280
Well…

13
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,640
You gave me foods.

14
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,360
It means that you love me.

15
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,000
And you are my friend.

16
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,840
Right?

17
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,680
Bestie

18
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,040
How is the taste

19
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,480
out of ten?

20
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,520
I give you a million.

21
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,520
So exaggerate.

22
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,360
Exaggerate.

23
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,200
Keep eating.

24
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,200
I’ll be back.

25
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,280
Who are you looking for?

26
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,840
Hello, I’m looking for-

27
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,120
He is not home.

28
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,080
He is not?

29
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,240
Yes.

30
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,560
He isn’t here?

31
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,040
He isn't here

32
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,320
And where is he?

33
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,640
I don't know either.

34
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,600
Oh and

35
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,200
whether accident, property, or health insurance

36
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,120
I already have them.

37
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,000
Including serious diseases like cancer.

38
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,560
What are you talking about?

39
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:05,600
Oh?

40
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,520
I thought

41
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,440
you were an insurance salesman.

42
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,680
No?

43
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,320
Oh. Um…

44
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,080
I don't know it.

45
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,400
I apologize.

46
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,960
And what are you doing here?

47
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,320
This is my restaurant.

48
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,400
Oh?

49
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,840
How tall are you?

50
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,120
As tall as you.

51
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,840
Oh. Laika.

52
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,080
This is my friend.

53
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,600
Ah.

54
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,560
When did you come out here?

55
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,080
Um… I would like to talk with Laika.

56
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,600
You could wait for me inside.

57
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,440
Please go.

58
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,520
Go wait inside.

59
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,120
It won’t be long.

60
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,680
He said that wasn't his friend!

61
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,680
Why would he lie?

62
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,760
Whatever they are. It isn't none of my business.

63
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,760
I just couldn't find a secluded place to make the vaccine.

64
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,840
So, I thought maybe I could live with you.

65
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,040
It's alright.

66
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,800
I’m well now.

67
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,760
What?

68
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,360
Yeah.

69
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,880
Or maybe it is?

70
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,480
Of course not.

71
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,160
Maybe it is?

72
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,280
No. It is not.

73
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,120
Amazing!

74
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,640
Yeah!

75
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,000
Gosh! Congratulations!

76
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,880
It's my business.

77
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,760
Ah. No.

78
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,240
By the way

79
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,000
how could you get better without our vaccine?

80
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,840
Well, my friend said that I just had a dried skin.

81
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,080
I just…

82
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,720
Um…

83
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,520
Have to drink more water

84
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,920
and maintain my skin moisture.

85
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,040
Then I got better.

86
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,680
So that means…
Hm.

87
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,920
The temperature of this planet

88
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,720
is different from ours.

89
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,760
But.

90
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,480
Wait.

91
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,640
You said your friend?

92
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,000
But you never came here before.

93
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,000
How do you have a friend?

94
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,440
Oh. Well.

95
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,200
It is not like that.

96
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:36,880
But un-

97
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,440
It's alright,

98
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,000
It is none of my business.

99
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,560
I have accomplished my mission on this planet.

100
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,520
I’ll take my leave then.

101
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,800
And for you,

102
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,520
I must warn you that

103
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,560
you must hurry up and press the button.

104
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,360
If you keep wasting our time,

105
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,640
our space will be underdeveloped.

106
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,960
We won't be able to develop as fast as other planets.

107
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,160
So.

108
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,320
I’ll leave now.

109
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,120
Oh. Ok.

110
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,120
Bye bye.

111
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,920
It’s good!

112
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,880
My coffee!

113
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,400
Ah!

114
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,760
You broke my vehicle.

115
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,400
How could I go back to my planet?!

116
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,160
V-

117
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,120
What vehicle?

118
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,920
What the?

119
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,160
The route back to the Space station is ready.

120
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,240
You may depart.

121
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,600
There is an accident now.

122
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,440
I am not able to depart.

123
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,800
I will contact back later.

124
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,080
It was because of you!

125
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,360
See?

126
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,240
How could I go back to my planet now?!

127
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,160
Planet? Dao?

128
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,960
At Dao Khanong?

129
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,960
It's just over there.

130
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,480
It’s broken. How could I go home?

131
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,040
It is not even rain.

132
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,040
He must be crazy.

133
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,000
What should I do now? If I call for backup,

134
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,920
my boss will know that I’m not working.

135
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,480
Alright. Alright. Come.

136
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,600
I’ll take you to get it fixed.

137
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,840
It's my apology.

138
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,960
Come. Come.

139
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,240
Sit. Sit.

140
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,320
Sit here.

141
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,760
Hello.

142
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,840
Hello.

143
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,600
What would you like to have?

144
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,320
What food do you have?

145
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,040
Oh, they are all delicious.

146
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,320
We have Omelet Soup.

147
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,840
Vietnamese Sausage. A Stir-fried spicy dish.

148
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,200
I would have a Stir-fried spicy dish and fried Vietnamese sausage.

149
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,200
Right away.

150
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,040
And rice.

151
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,720
Of course. Just a moment.

152
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,960
This is a Stir-fried spicy dish.

153
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,760
And Vietnamese sausage?

154
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,640
Yes.

155
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:43,120
And Vietnamese sausage.

156
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,120
Oh. Is there anything that cat can eat?

157
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,320
I’ve never had one. So, I thought that it might be hungry.

158
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,240
Oh.

159
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,920
If for cat,

160
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,320
you will need cat food

161
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,960
because human foods are bad for their health.

162
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,800
Understand?

163
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,760
Here is your order.

164
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,560
Cat food is better for them.

165
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,440
Cat food is better for them.

166
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,360
Cat food is better for them.

167
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,680
Hm. Is that so?

168
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,600
Thank you.

169
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,400
Oh, and?

170
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,360
It's on the house.

171
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,240
For you it's free.

172
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,120
Oh, no.

173
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,720
This is for sell.

174
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,000
I have to pay.

175
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,280
It’s totally fine, Uncle.

176
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,280
I really want to help.

177
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,960
Are you sure?

178
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,200
Then…

179
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,760
Thank you so much.

180
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,280
Your welcome.

181
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,800
You're always kind, Granny.

182
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,440
I’ll take my leave now.

183
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,040
Goodbye.

184
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,280
Hff.

185
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,920
Hff.

186
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,400
What?

187
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,720
Your neck hurts?

188
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,120
Crick in the neck?

189
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,440
Dim!

190
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,400
What?

191
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,360
And…

192
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,480
Isn’t it too much?

193
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,240
Aren’t you hot?

194
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,520
I agree.

195
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,320
Aren’t you hot?

196
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,520
Ah.

197
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,000
I forgot.

198
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,320
I won’t talk with you.

199
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,120
Heh.

200
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,160
Why?

201
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,040
What did I do?

202
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,720
Hm?

203
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,400
You said my coffee was suck.

204
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,440
It was.

205
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,880
You could at least try to be nice.

206
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,960
I was nice.

207
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,040
Your coffee was suck.

208
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,160
It was true.

209
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,040
Or do you want me to lie?

210
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,400
Oh, it's so good.

211
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,080
Like this?

212
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,240
Hey!

213
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,440
How long will you be arguing?

214
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,280
Oh.

215
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,240
I see…

216
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,040
Why you both can get along so well.

217
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,760
Oh.

218
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,280
Ants.

219
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,080
Hm…

220
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:55,720
What a nice weather.

221
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,760
Oh.

222
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,280
Hello, Uncle.
Uncle.

223
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:58,920
Hello.

224
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,640
Oh?

225
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,760
You went to buy food yourself?

226
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,960
Tan.

227
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,240
Go home.

228
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,240
Then you must tell me first

229
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,360
that my coffee is good.

230
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,000
It isn’t a time for jokes.

231
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,800
Go away.

232
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,680
Let’s go, Uncle.

233
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,600
Is there something wrong?

234
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,880
Oh.

235
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,120
The cat.

236
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,960
they.

237
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,200
Oh.

238
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,480
Cat?

239
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,000
I don't have any cat.

240
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,880
You don’t?

241
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,680
Oh.

242
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,760
That one is for a stray cat.

243
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,760
I normally give him food.

244
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,880
Yes.

245
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,520
Hm.

246
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,000
This shop looks clean.

247
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,280
If you have a cat,

248
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,680
it will be just fine.

249
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,280
Actually, I’m not really into owning one.

250
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,120
Then…

251
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,760
Why do you keep feeding him?

252
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,360
Why am I keep feeding him?

253
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,360
Oh.

254
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,360
Maybe because of pity.

255
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,640
Hm.

256
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,800
I’ll go now.

257
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,800
Hm.

258
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,600
I’ve been away for a while now.

259
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,280
My cat at home

260
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,840
may get hungry now.

261
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,840
I pity him.

262
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,440
But um...

263
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,720
Uncle.

264
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,720
I will buy some food

265
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,760
and bring it to you tomorrow.

266
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I must seem pitiful huh?

267
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,840
Stir-fried bamboo shoots and fried eggs are here.

268
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,200
The next one, what would you like to have?

269
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,680
Stir-fried bamboo and

270
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,520
Vietnamese sausage?

271
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,280
Right away.

272
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,680
You may take a seat.

273
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,200
Once I finish I’ll serve it to you.

274
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,160
Chan Dan!

275
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,200
Hey!

276
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,840
I’ve decided that I will have my last meal

277
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,320
before I destroy this planet.

278
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,080
Hey.

279
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,720
Can you bring me food?

280
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,680
Chan Dan.

281
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,160
Chan Dan.

282
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,640
Hey.

283
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,480
I’m hungry.

284
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,640
Can I have something to eat? I’m hungry.

285
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,200
Step aside.

286
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:22,880
I'm hungry.

287
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,800
I'm working.

288
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,920
Please. I'm hungry,

289
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,840
Step aside.

290
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,720
Oh, come on. Please.

291
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,840
The customers are waiting. See?

292
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,600
Please.

293
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,280
Bestie

294
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,600
Bestie, yes.

295
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,480
Can I have something to eat please?

296
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:34,800
I'm hungry.

297
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,560
Please. Pretty please.

298
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,480
What on earth are you saying?

299
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,360
Please.

300
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:40,800
Bestie

301
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,440
Fine!

302
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,440
I understand it ok?

303
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,240
Go take a seat.

304
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,600
Here is your order.

305
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,720
Oh!

306
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,680
There is a shop here?

307
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,200
New opening shop?

308
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,400
Excuse me?

309
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,920
Can you fix an umbrella?

310
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,120
Hey! You!

311
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,600
What you?

312
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,560
Do you guys know each other?

313
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,440
No.
Yes!

314
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,360
What?

315
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,840
Or…

316
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,520
Or I thought you were someone else.

317
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,760
Heh.

318
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,480
Heh.

319
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,120
Um. It's ok.

320
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:33,960
Ah. Bro.

321
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,520
Whose bro?

322
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,200
Bro?

323
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,800
I have no brother.

324
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:41,880
You?

325
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,800
I'm a man.

326
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,240
You!

327
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,720
Hm.

328
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,120
What do you want.

329
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,520
Could you get this umbrella fixed?

330
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,720
Please?

331
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,880
Why don't you just buy a new one?

332
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,720
Oh.

333
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,720
No, I cannot.

334
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,200
This one.

335
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,040
It.

336
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,440
It must be fixed.

337
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,920
Heh.

338
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,840
So annoying.

339
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,720
Buying a new one must be expensive.

340
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,200
I’m broke.

341
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,000
What is wrong with you?

342
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,160
I’m sorry.

343
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,320
Gosh.

344
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,080
What a nuisance.

345
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,560
Do not touch my stuff!

346
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,360
Wow!

347
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,120
It looks so good!

348
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:08,960
Wow.

349
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,800
Wow!

350
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,520
Thank you so much.

351
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,240
Mm!

352
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,880
Very delicious!

353
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,600
Gosh!

354
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,600
Hush!
What do I do?

355
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,680
Chan Dan.

356
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,040
The food is so good. I don't want to destroy this planet anymore!

357
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,280
I want to continue living here!

358
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,080
I want to eat delicious food like this every day!

359
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,400
Shh.

360
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,720
Lower your voice.

361
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,920
I know that the food is delicious.

362
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,040
So good!

363
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,920
I know!

364
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,400
Hm!

365
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,480
By the way.

366
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,400
Hm?

367
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,840
Your friend.

368
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,560
Where did he go?

369
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:51,840
Friend?

370
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,600
Yes.

371
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,160
Oh!

372
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:53,640
Well.

373
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,520
It's you.

374
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,080
No.

375
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,640
I meant the guy from last night.

376
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,800
Oh.

377
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,880
He already headed back to his planet.

378
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,240
He’s the Space Technician.

379
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,360
Like…

380
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,960
Space Technician.

381
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,720
Well,

382
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,840
Space stars.

383
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,400
I have to say that

384
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,640
since you lived with me

385
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,240
I can’t understand you fully.

386
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:27,960
Huh?

387
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,840
Can you speak my language?

388
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,240
Those stuff about stars and spaces or whatever,

389
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,120
could you stop talking about that?

390
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,440
Or.

391
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,800
Do you want to be an astronaut or something?

392
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,720
I don’t want to be an astronaut.

393
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,960
But I’m a Space Engineer.

394
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,760
Space engineer?

395
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,640
Yes.

396
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,200
Are you pulling my leg?

397
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,520
Huh?

398
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,680
Pulling what?

399
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,960
My leg.

400
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,240
Huh?

401
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,520
You’re pulling my leg.

402
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,320
Hey!

403
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,320
I speak the truth!

404
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,040
But if you don't believe me

405
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,720
I’ll prove it to you!

406
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,400
Wait a minute.

407
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,840
Where are you going?

408
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,320
Prove me what?

409
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
Will he come back to eat?

410
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,320
I’ll just leave it here then.

411
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,800
Very good.

412
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,280
I like thank you so much.

413
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,600
You're welcome.

414
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,960
This is for you.

415
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,680
It's okay.

416
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,680
We don't have to recharge.

417
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,160
It’s alright.

418
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,080
You can speak Thai?

419
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,320
Nah.

420
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,120
You give it.

421
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,640
When I go back home,
I would share with my friends.

422
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,000
that you’re the best.

423
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Who would know is when you see this kid.

424
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,960
Okay,

425
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,880
Thank you so much.

426
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,400
Don't worry.

427
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,480
A best memory.

428
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,680
I will never forget.

429
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,480
Thank you so much.

430
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,760
Bye bye.

431
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,560
Thank you.

432
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,640
Ngao.

433
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,800
Sigh.

434
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,720
Ngao.

435
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,800
You live and eat well huh?

436
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,800
You live and eat well huh?
Where are you?

437
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,440
Hehe.
Come and eat your food.

438
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,040
Meow.

439
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:25,680
Ngao.
Hey.

440
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,080
Hm?

441
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:27,720
Meow.

442
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,600
Why don’t you go to him?

443
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,080
Mimiw.

444
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,560
Come here.

445
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,560
Nope.

446
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,880
Human gives the same food every time.

447
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,080
I’m bored of it.

448
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,680
Hm?

449
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,440
Does he ignore me?

450
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,360
They both are friends now?

451
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,720
Hm.

452
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,040
What about you, Boss?

453
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,640
Why haven’t you gone home?

454
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,800
Sigh.

455
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,720
Hey.

456
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,800
How long do you think

457
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,720
we have to stay on this planet?

458
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,960
Hm…

459
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,520
If we don’t die

460
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,640
from fighting with the dogs around here,

461
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,880
I’ll continue living.

462
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,480
Not long then.

463
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,320
Heh. Heh.

464
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,640
Maybe.

465
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,960
Since that man came here to destroy the earth…

466
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,320
If he presses the button!
Ah!

467
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,600
We are all dead.

468
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,920
Hahaha!

469
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,800
He wouldn’t dare.

470
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,920
Don't forget that

471
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,680
he isn’t the first engineer who came here.

472
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,880
But still, I’m worried.

473
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,880
Worried?

474
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,120
Who are you worried about?

475
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,240
Don’t tell me that…

476
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,920
You’re worried about that human!

477
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,560
The one that is your owner!

478
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,760
The human- the human that you’re talking about

479
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,800
is my friend!

480
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,600
Friend?

481
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,360
Hm?

482
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,240
So the chubby now has a friend?

483
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,520
Hehe.

484
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,480
Having a human as a friend

485
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,160
is more reliable than you.

486
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,160
What?

487
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,000
Heh.

488
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,760
Now you love humans more than your kind.

489
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,360
Chubby.

490
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,360
Come and eat your food.

491
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,600
Your favorite snack is here.

492
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,560
Hurry.

493
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,000
Come eat it.

494
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,320
Why formally dressed? Where are you going?

495
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,320
Greetings.

496
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,640
My name is Chun.

497
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,440
I'm a Space Engineer.

498
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,800
My mission

499
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,800
is to press the boom

500
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,960
and destroy the world.

501
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,200
Hahaha!

502
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:57,760
Hey!

503
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,040
It’s not a time for reading.

504
00:29:59,040 --> 00:29:59,720
Eat your food.

505
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,000
Hurry up.

506
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,040
So we can go.

507
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,640
Hahaha.

508
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,360
Anyone would laugh at it.

509
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,400
This is

510
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,360
my mission.

511
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,080
Then tell me.

512
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,040
Why did you come to destroy my beloved world?

513
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,960
What for?

514
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,080
Oh.

515
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,640
Um…

516
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,680
We

517
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,640
were assigned

518
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,880
to expropriate the lands on the earth .

519
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,200
In order to create a shortcut to another planet.

520
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,520
We called it

521
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,920
Space Expressway.

522
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,600
Space Expressway?

523
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,080
Yes.

524
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,600
Around Chan Road?

525
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,760
Not that Chan but near the moon.

526
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,120
Here.

527
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,600
What is it?

528
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,120
It's a boom.

529
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,880
Don't worry.

530
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,360
It won't explode as long as I don't push the button.

531
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,520
Idiot!

532
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,680
Why keep reading it?

533
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,840
Let's go home now!

534
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,880
Owner!

535
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,880
The money is here.

536
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,480
Go.

537
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:01,960
Hurry up!

538
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,840
I lost my appetite.

539
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,880
Hurry up! Come here.

540
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,560
Let’s go home!

541
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:05,960
Thank you so much.

542
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,000
You read it every day!

543
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,320
Excuse me, how much is it?

544
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,880
Oh, it's 50 baht.

545
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,760
Here.

546
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,600
Thank you so much.

547
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,200
Thank you too.

548
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,840
Hey.

549
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,080
I told you the truth.

550
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,440
You still don’t believe me?

551
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,720
Hey.

552
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,120
I really spoke the truth.

553
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,080
You don’t believe me?

554
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,000
I do.

555
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,080
I do believe that

556
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,400
You will destroy this world.

557
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,360
When you press the button.

558
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,880
Then boom!

559
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,640
We are dead.

560
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,360
Just like that?

561
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,600
Yes.

562
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,000
And why are you telling me this?

563
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,440
What?

564
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,200
You asked me before about this.

565
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,880
And now we are

566
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,280
best friends.

567
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,640
That's why I wanted to tell you this.

568
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,760
Chun.

569
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,480
I think you overconsume cartoons and movies.

570
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,440
Just tone it down.

571
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,360
Huh?

572
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,680
It’s not like that.

573
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:23,000
At first, I planned to just push the button and leave.

574
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,640
But…

575
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,040
After I got to try your food.

576
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,280
I felt that

577
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,280
I don't want to destroy this planet anymore.

578
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,560
Because your food

579
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,080
it's really delicious.

580
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,080
Please believe me.

581
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,360
How much is my food?

582
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,000
Today it's free.

583
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,480
Thank you.

584
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,160
Do you want to see what's inside?

585
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,400
Mm.

586
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,640
Hey!

587
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,080
What in the world is this?

588
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,120
This is clearly an electrical repair tool.

589
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,040
What? Wait!

590
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,200
This is not my suitcase.

591
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,000
Gosh! What had I been listening to?

592
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,000
Ah!

593
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,200
Gosh!

594
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,520
This can’t be good.

595
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,360
This planet is uninhabitable.

596
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,280
Well.

597
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,240
I’ll take my leave.

598
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,320
We’re in danger!

599
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,200
We’re in great danger!

600
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:07,640
Where are you going?!

601
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,880
God!

602
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,600
Hey!

603
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,280
Hey!

604
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,080
Who the hell am I living with?

605
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,800
Gosh!

606
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,400
I gave him food for free.

607
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,880
He said it so sensibly.

608
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,520
An air conditioner repair man!

609
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:32,520
Um…

610
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,640
Officer?

611
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,320
Officer! This way, please.

612
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:39,960
Um…

613
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,520
This one is your suitcase.

614
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,200
Oh!

615
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,040
Did we swap them?

616
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,720
You’re lucky that I haven’t gone back to space.

617
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,800
If I do, that would be a problem.

618
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,280
And why is that?

619
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,000
There's a transmitter chip in the suitcase.

620
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,240
If I go back,

621
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,560
everyone will know that I came here.

622
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,720
Oh.

623
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,840
I’m sorry.

624
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,080
I um…

625
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:03,640
Next time

626
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,200
I would be more careful.

627
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,480
Next time?

628
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,240
Heh.

629
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,320
So.

630
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,560
You haven’t decided to press the bomb?

631
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,440
Oh.

632
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,560
I don't know what reason you have.

633
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,320
But I must warn you that

634
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:29,520
your suitcase contains a powerful power.

635
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,840
It has a destructive power.

636
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,720
Moreover, both you and the bomb

637
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,400
had a time-tracking chip implanted.

638
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,160
I suggest you

639
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,120
to hurry up and finish it.

640
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,040
If you resist

641
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,200
the Space Policeman will capture you

642
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,480
and they will remove you from your position.

643
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,600
It's finished.

644
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,240
Your umbrella is fixed.

645
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,040
Then, my work here is done.

646
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,920
The Cape signal is beeping.

647
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,560
See you at our planet.

648
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,920
Huh?

649
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,400
Does he just leave?

650
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,600
What a strange man.

651
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,040
No, thank you no nothing.

652
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,760
Hm.

653
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,520
Hm?

654
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,800
What is wrong with him?

655
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,960
Gosh.

656
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,880
So many situations in one day.

657
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,400
Hm.

658
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,800
I won’t come to this shop again.

659
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,160
Code DSII.

660
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,440
Tracking the target.

661
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,400
Sigh.

662
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,920
What is it?

663
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,000
Sigh.

664
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:31,920
Oh!

665
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,280
Shit!

666
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,880
Hey.

667
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,440
Bro?

668
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,280
Hey!

669
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,760
Oh!

670
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,120
Sorry.

671
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,280
How long have you been here?

672
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,840
I just arrived.

673
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,440
Do you need something to eat?

674
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,560
Eat here or take away?

675
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,880
Take away.

676
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,000
Today I would have…

677
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,360
Hm…

678
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,520
Crap Meats with Coconut Milk Dipping.

679
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,120
Crap Meats with Coconut Milk Dipping. Alright.

680
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,080
Take away please. I buy it for Uncle.

681
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,320
This menu?

682
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,080
Yes.

683
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,800
Uncle just bought it not long ago.

684
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,600
Oh, really?

685
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,640
Yes.

686
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,800
Oh, well.

687
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,680
I'll stil take it.

688
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,640
But add more vegetables. I'll eat it myself.

689
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:35,880
Ok.

690
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,640
Anything else?

691
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,560
Oh.

692
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,840
I would have

693
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,440
an Omelet Soup takes away as well.

694
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,080
Right away.

695
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,200
Ok.

696
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,920
Two foods and rice?

697
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,600
Yes.

698
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,320
Ok.

699
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,000
Just a moment.

700
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,720
Thank you so much.

701
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,080
Done.

702
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:57,880
How much is it?

703
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,640
Hm…

704
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,680
110 baht.

705
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,760
But give me 100.

706
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,160
Ok.

707
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,480
Hey.

708
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,960
It's cute.

709
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,680
A cat keychain?

710
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,600
My customer gave it to me.

711
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,720
If you like it, just get one.

712
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,000
The cats.

713
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,360
Here's your money.

714
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:26,960
Um...

715
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,080
About having a cat.

716
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,160
I don’t know.

717
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:35,080
I don't know. If they like me the same way as I like them or not.

718
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,720
Hm.

719
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,320
I’m so hungry.
