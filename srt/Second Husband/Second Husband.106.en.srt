We look so good.

My mom is giving you a hard time,
isn't she?

79

It wasn't that hard, thanks to you.

80

It's not like I just met her.

Thank you.

How many kids should we have?

84
00:06:23,532 --> 00:06:26,199
I want to have about five daughters
that look just like you.

85

How about five princesses?

86

I can't have that many.

87

A son resembling you is enough for me.

Is that so?

89
00:06:39,797 --> 00:06:41,531

It's as sweet as honey.

97

They're straight from the fields.

98

They're fresh Korean melons from Seongju.

Mother, I'm home.

Where have you been with that big belly?

101
00:07:35,104 --> 00:07:38,771
Sang Hyuk lost his appetite
because of the heat,

102
00:07:38,807 --> 00:07:40,641
so I went to buy some summer radish.

103
00:07:40,676 --> 00:07:43,009
You know he loves yeolmukimchimariguksu.

104
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:45,279
A refreshing bowl of it...

105
00:07:45,314 --> 00:07:47,614
does give you an appetite.

106
00:07:47,983 --> 00:07:50,417
Would you like kongguksu?

107
00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:53,724
Okay.
I have no appetite, but that sounds good.

108
00:07:56,024 --> 00:07:57,625
I forgot to get noodles.

109
00:07:57,659 --> 00:08:00,060
I'll go buy them quickly.

110
00:08:00,095 --> 00:08:02,362
How forgetful you are.

111

Mother.

116
00:08:43,505 --> 00:08:46,106
I think I'm in labor.

117
00:08:46,141 --> 00:08:48,975
Can you call Sang Hyuk...

118
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:50,912

00:08:50,946 --> 00:08:52,946
Where are you?

120
00:08:52,981 --> 00:08:55,882
I'm grabbing a taxi to go to the hospital.

121
00:08:55,918 --> 00:08:58,218
But there are no taxis.

122
00:08:58,253 --> 00:08:59,454
What?

123
00:08:59,871 --> 00:09:02,405
My Seon Hwa is about to have a baby?

124
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,659
Which hospital?

125
00:09:04,693 --> 00:09:07,360
I'll run over there right now.

126
00:09:07,396 --> 00:09:09,330
She's not at the hospital yet.

127
00:09:09,364 --> 00:09:11,898
She's on her way now.

128
00:09:11,934 --> 00:09:15,267
It's her first baby,
so it would take a while.

129
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:18,737
Anyway, I'll call you again
when I get to the hospital.

130
00:09:19,516 --> 00:09:22,716
What a hothead.

131
00:09:23,178 --> 00:09:25,378
Mom, you should've called Sang Hyuk first.

132
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,500
Why did you call Seon Hwa's grandmother?

133
00:09:27,521 --> 00:09:29,423
Your brother is working hard at work.

134
00:09:29,451 --> 00:09:31,352
There's no need to rush him for it.

135
00:09:31,386 --> 00:09:33,620
He might come by
when she's about to give birth.

136
00:09:33,655 --> 00:09:35,490
You didn't even call him.

137
00:09:35,524 --> 00:09:36,458
Get up.

138
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:37,892
Leave me alone.

139
00:09:37,926 --> 00:09:39,507
Hurry.

140
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:49,988
Soo Chul.

141
00:09:50,873 --> 00:09:53,473
Pull up the car
in front of the pregnant lady.

142
00:09:53,608 --> 00:09:54,543
I'm sorry?

143
00:09:55,233 --> 00:09:57,815
Oh, no!
She might give birth on the streets.

144
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,633
Why are there no taxis?

145
00:10:06,533 --> 00:10:07,966
Just hang on!

146
00:10:07,966 --> 00:10:10,766
That's right. Take deep breaths.

147
00:10:10,766 --> 00:10:14,000
It looks like she's pregnant.
Let's go to the hospital in my car.

148
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,166
Sorry?

149
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,833
This looks urgent. Let's hurry.

150
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,300
Would you do that for her?

151
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,333
I was going to get a taxi for her.
Thank you.

152
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,833
Thank you so much.

153
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:22,900
Let's hurry up.

154
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,200
Be careful.

155
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,919
- Please take care of her.
- Of course.

156
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,266
Grandma.

157
00:10:56,066 --> 00:10:59,233
Grandma, I'm going into labor.

158
00:11:00,066 --> 00:11:02,100
It feels like I'm going to die.

159
00:11:03,466 --> 00:11:05,133
Where are you now?

160
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:06,933
Let's go faster.

161
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:16,200
It just tastes all right.
I don't understand why it's popular.

162
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:19,566
The most popular idol group is
the model for the commercial.

163
00:11:19,566 --> 00:11:20,966
I see.

164
00:11:20,966 --> 00:11:23,200
Just think of it as a seasonal product.

165
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,000
Are there any other ideas
for the new product's theme?

166
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,900
These days, customers are smart.

167
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:32,433
It's the information age, and people can
buy and taste snacks from everywhere.

168
00:11:33,033 --> 00:11:34,000
So?

169
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,400
Now, not only do we have to focus
on the taste but the visuals as well.

170
00:11:38,633 --> 00:11:41,600
We'll focus on the taste and visuals
for this product's theme.

171
00:11:42,366 --> 00:11:47,433
I think the value proposition for it is
"the most beautiful snack."

172
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,900
That sounds good. As they say,
"What looks good tastes good."

173
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:56,166
Why don't we try contacting
Mon Chou in France?

174
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:01,200
They are known for their pride
and not working with anyone.

175
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,933
We have to try and see
if that's true or not.

176
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,200
Are you confident?

177
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:11,400
Yes, I am.

178
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,700
Then you should take charge
and carry it forward.

179
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,300
Let's end our meeting for today.

180
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,366
Okay.

181
00:12:18,366 --> 00:12:19,666
Ma'am.

182
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:22,600
It's been a while
since we had a team dinner.

183
00:12:24,466 --> 00:12:27,100
All right, then.
I'll buy you guys beef barbeque today.

184
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,433
Is everyone free?

185
00:12:28,433 --> 00:12:29,833
- Yes.
- Yes.

186
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,466
Oh, yes! Beef!

187
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,866
Sang Hyuk, you'll be joining us too,
right?

188
00:12:35,633 --> 00:12:36,600
Sure.

189
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,300
Okay. Let's have fun today.

190
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,766
<i>I didn't know it then</i>

191
00:12:49,266 --> 00:12:51,933
<i>I wasn't even interested</i>

192
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:58,133
<i>Under the warm sunlight</i>

193
00:12:59,933 --> 00:13:03,066
<i>The time and people</i>

194
00:13:03,066 --> 00:13:07,366
<i>And the past memories</i>

195
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,200
<i>Shine beautifully, my youth</i>

196
00:13:15,173 --> 00:13:18,440
<i>As much as I've fallen</i>

197
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,407
That's enough.

198
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,907
First, there's no personality.

199
00:13:26,007 --> 00:13:28,740
For a rookie,
freshness and individuality are crucial.

200
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,407
That's how you become a hit.

201
00:13:30,407 --> 00:13:33,407
Yes, sir. Please give me another chance.

202
00:13:34,107 --> 00:13:35,208
I'll do my best!

203
00:13:36,373 --> 00:13:39,607
Everyone that comes in here says
they'll do their best.

204
00:13:40,173 --> 00:13:41,773
But that's not enough.

205
00:13:41,773 --> 00:13:44,173
Rookies have to find a way to stand out.

206
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,940
Start working on that now.

207
00:13:52,907 --> 00:13:53,873
You can go now.

208
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,040
Okay. Thank you.

209
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,207
I'll come back after more practice.

210
00:14:03,207 --> 00:14:05,073
- Sure.
- Okay.

211
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,240
Seon Hwa!

212
00:14:18,807 --> 00:14:22,240
Hey! Stop running. My legs hurt!

213
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,507
Hurry up, Mom!

214
00:14:23,507 --> 00:14:25,240
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

215
00:14:28,573 --> 00:14:30,140
- Ha Rin, the meat is burning!
- Oh, no!

216
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,673
You need to be careful.

217
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,073
- Thank you for the meal.
- Thank you for the meal.

218
00:14:35,073 --> 00:14:36,040
Enjoy!

219
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,373
- Yes, we will.
- Thank you.

220
00:14:38,373 --> 00:14:40,090
It's been so long
since we last had barbeque together.

221
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:41,411
You're right.

222
00:14:42,273 --> 00:14:43,940
"Find the Master"!

223
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:48,773
Viewers, I've found the most popular
hanok-style bakery lately.

224
00:14:48,773 --> 00:14:52,107
Look at the line!

225
00:14:52,107 --> 00:14:53,407
It must be delicious.

226
00:14:53,407 --> 00:14:54,707
Let's start our interview.

227
00:14:54,707 --> 00:14:57,007
It's awesome.

228
00:14:57,007 --> 00:14:59,707
They taste good and look very pretty too.

229
00:15:00,173 --> 00:15:03,573
Let's go inside and see how awesome it is!

230
00:15:03,573 --> 00:15:04,873
Come this way.

231
00:15:14,573 --> 00:15:16,740
- Welcome.
- Hello!

232
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,907
The bakery itself is so pretty!

233
00:15:21,907 --> 00:15:23,207
Nice to meet you!

234
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,407
Oh, gosh!
Did you prepare these for me to try?

235
00:15:27,907 --> 00:15:28,873
That's right.

236
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,852
With the perfect taste buds...

237
00:15:31,852 --> 00:15:34,048
that even the skilled cook Jang Geum
will be jealous about,

238
00:15:34,073 --> 00:15:36,173
I'll try it!

239
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:42,073
Oh, my goodness.

240
00:15:43,173 --> 00:15:45,707
It's unbelievably sweet!

241
00:15:45,707 --> 00:15:48,473
It's terrific, everyone.

242
00:15:48,473 --> 00:15:50,973
Are you the master?

243
00:15:50,973 --> 00:15:52,773
- No, I'm not.
- You're not? Well, then...

244
00:15:52,773 --> 00:15:56,640
Ma'am. Are you the master?

245
00:15:57,307 --> 00:15:58,513
It's not me either.

246
00:15:59,473 --> 00:16:02,840
Where's the master, then?

247
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,940
Please follow me.

248
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:04,940
Oh, sure.

249
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,607
I'm back.

250
00:16:18,207 --> 00:16:21,907
Excuse me, are you the Dessert Master?

251
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,340
That's right. You found the right person.

252
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:30,040
I'm the master.

253
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,907
Viewers of "Find the Master,"

254
00:16:33,907 --> 00:16:35,573
I've finally found him,

255
00:16:35,573 --> 00:16:38,440
the Dessert Master!

256
00:16:50,007 --> 00:16:52,440
They almost saw my handsome face.

257
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,040
Didn't they catch me on the camera?

258
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,107
That can't be good.

259
00:17:02,107 --> 00:17:05,740
Mom, I'm having a gathering
with my colleagues today, so I'll be late.

260
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,801
Is that so?

261
00:17:07,473 --> 00:17:08,707
Okay, then.

262
00:17:08,707 --> 00:17:11,340
Please help me tell Dad.

263
00:17:11,807 --> 00:17:14,007
- Darling, I'm back.
- Of course.

264
00:17:14,007 --> 00:17:15,673
He just came in.

265
00:17:15,673 --> 00:17:16,707
You're back.

266
00:17:17,707 --> 00:17:18,873
Who was that on the phone?

267
00:17:18,873 --> 00:17:20,573
It was Jae Gyeong.

268
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:22,173
She said she'll be late
because of the team dinner.

269
00:17:22,173 --> 00:17:23,173
Why that girl.

270
00:17:23,852 --> 00:17:27,540
She's not a child anymore.
Why does she still tell us everything?

271
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:31,140
She's just trying to get your attention.

272
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,107
What did you do today, honey?

273
00:17:36,673 --> 00:17:40,973
I went to take care of some business
for the welfare foundation.

274
00:17:42,373 --> 00:17:46,273
Oh, right!
I gave a pregnant woman a ride just now.

275
00:17:47,307 --> 00:17:49,273
I wonder if she gave birth smoothly.

276
00:17:49,273 --> 00:17:51,440
- A pregnant woman?
- Yes.

277
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:56,273
Other people's children are
giving birth just fine.

278
00:17:56,273 --> 00:17:58,273
How come I haven't heard from Jae Min?

279
00:17:59,507 --> 00:18:01,873
Why are you trying to rush things?

280
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:06,107
He's doing well studying in the US now,
and you're suddenly asking him for kids?

281
00:18:08,373 --> 00:18:10,740
Darling, give Jae Min a call.

282
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,973
Tell him I miss him so much
that my eyes are sore.

283
00:18:14,473 --> 00:18:17,473
You're all whining.

284
00:18:36,507 --> 00:18:37,407
Let's have a toast.

285
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,440
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

286
00:18:43,173 --> 00:18:45,540
The atmosphere here is so exciting.

287
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,540
- It's great.
- It feels like a foreign country.

288
00:18:50,807 --> 00:18:51,940
Are you confident?

289
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,607
Yes, I am.

290
00:18:54,707 --> 00:18:56,840
- Are you imitating them?
- Isn't it similar?

291
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,040
- It's not the same.
- You sounded just like them.

292
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:58,973
It's the same!

293
00:18:58,973 --> 00:19:01,573
The idea to contact Mon Chou was
really out of my expectations.

294
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,140
Let's stop talking about work
and have another glass.

295
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,607
- Sure.
- Let's do it.

296
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:11,340
- Ms. Yoon, please have another glass.
- Bottoms up!

297
00:19:13,107 --> 00:19:14,207
Thank you for the drinks.

298
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,373
Oh, gosh. I'm so worried.

299
00:19:32,373 --> 00:19:36,107
Goodness. She must have a safe delivery.

300
00:19:36,107 --> 00:19:38,673
She will.

301
00:19:38,673 --> 00:19:40,773
What's going on?

302
00:19:40,773 --> 00:19:42,873
Is Sang Hyuk still not picking up?

303
00:19:42,873 --> 00:19:44,973
No, he's not picking up.

304
00:19:44,973 --> 00:19:47,604
What on earth is he up to
in this critical moment...

305
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:49,782
that he's not picking up?

306
00:19:49,807 --> 00:19:51,640
What do you mean?

307
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,240
Why would you say that...

308
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,154
when he's working hard at the office?

309
00:19:55,179 --> 00:19:56,888
It's not like Sang Hyuk is off work now.

310
00:19:56,913 --> 00:19:59,654
That's not what I meant.

311
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:04,854
I'm just worried sick about her!

312
00:20:04,879 --> 00:20:07,559
- Hurry and call him up.
- Okay.

313
00:20:08,843 --> 00:20:09,962
Goodness me.

314
00:20:14,935 --> 00:20:16,501
Are you going to leave today too?

315
00:20:17,502 --> 00:20:19,831
I told you that I'm seeing someone.

316
00:20:19,831 --> 00:20:22,707
And I told you
I'm not asking you to marry me.

317
00:20:23,063 --> 00:20:24,642
You're funny.

318
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,679
That hurts my pride.

319
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,381
Am I not...

320
00:20:32,391 --> 00:20:33,718
attractive enough?

321
00:20:37,756 --> 00:20:39,209
You're my boss.

322
00:20:40,534 --> 00:20:42,670
Who says you can't date your boss?

323
00:20:43,237 --> 00:20:44,739
Who told you that?

324
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:14,227
You're doing well. Push.

325
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,796
One more time.

326
00:21:17,379 --> 00:21:18,281
Push.

327
00:21:47,165 --> 00:21:48,147
Push.

328
00:22:38,173 --> 00:22:40,506
- A son?
- Yes, it's a son.

329
00:22:40,966 --> 00:22:42,091
My goodness.

330
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,559
You did a good job, baby.

331
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,983
- Ms. Yang.
- Yes.

332
00:22:47,983 --> 00:22:51,225
My Seon Hwa had a son.

333
00:22:51,225 --> 00:22:55,571
I heard as well. I was here too.

334
00:22:56,745 --> 00:23:00,218
Is my Seon Hwa, the mother, doing okay?

335
00:23:00,218 --> 00:23:01,292
Yes, she's doing well.

336
00:23:01,292 --> 00:23:03,512
- She delivered the baby safely, right?
- That's right.

337
00:23:03,879 --> 00:23:07,280
- Goodness. Thank you.
- Congratulations.

338
00:23:07,305 --> 00:23:09,352
Thank you so much.

339
00:23:09,377 --> 00:23:13,682
Eat up.
You haven't had dinner when it's so late.

340
00:23:13,682 --> 00:23:16,024
- You must be starving.
- Yes.

341
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:19,561
You skipped your meal
because you couldn't get a job?

342
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:20,942
Yes.

343
00:23:20,967 --> 00:23:22,564
That's one thing.

344
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,139
But also, it tastes so amazing.

345
00:23:31,673 --> 00:23:34,873
I came to eat your meal
because it tastes like a work of art.

346
00:23:36,445 --> 00:23:39,314
You're adorable. Eat lots.

347
00:23:40,332 --> 00:23:41,514
It's so good.

348
00:23:46,488 --> 00:23:47,723
Yes, Ms. Han.

349
00:23:48,257 --> 00:23:49,161
Sorry?

350
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,727
Seon Hwa had a baby today?

351
00:23:52,161 --> 00:23:55,471
It's a son, I see. How's Seon Hwa doing?

352
00:23:55,496 --> 00:23:57,066
Did she deliver the baby safely?

353
00:23:58,767 --> 00:24:01,870
Congratulations. That's good news.

354
00:24:07,246 --> 00:24:10,579
- Sae Byeok, look over there. It's Dad.
- Over here.

355
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:14,125
- Sang Hyuk, it's now. Take it now.
- Okay. I got it.

356
00:24:14,525 --> 00:24:16,581
- Sae Byeok.
- Sae Byeok, over there.

357
00:24:16,581 --> 00:24:18,265
You're so adorable.

358
00:24:18,289 --> 00:24:19,996
Look at Daddy. Daddy's here.

359
00:24:19,996 --> 00:24:21,912
- Daddy.
- That's a good boy.

360
00:24:21,936 --> 00:24:24,493
- Sang Mi, can you take a picture of us?
- Yes, let's do that.

361
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:26,411
Hurry and sit here.

362
00:24:26,411 --> 00:24:27,933
Sae Byeok, look here.

363
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:29,248
- Here we go.
- Over here.

364
00:24:29,272 --> 00:24:31,533
In 1, 2, 3!

365
00:24:33,235 --> 00:24:37,587
Sae Byeok is handsome, just like his dad.

366
00:24:38,397 --> 00:24:42,277
I know, Mother. He'll become
a great person when he grows up.

367
00:24:42,528 --> 00:24:47,176
He's my son,
but how could he be so good-looking?

368
00:24:47,176 --> 00:24:49,176
- Goodness.
- I'm so proud of him.

369
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,882
You should be thankful to Sae Byeok.

370
00:24:51,882 --> 00:24:54,267
I was so against it, but you decided
to get married by yourselves.

371
00:24:54,267 --> 00:24:56,558
And you came home with a big pot belly.

372
00:24:56,558 --> 00:24:58,360
I almost passed out as I was so surprised.

373
00:24:59,381 --> 00:25:01,430
Thank you, Sae Byeok.

374
00:25:02,719 --> 00:25:05,682
By the way,
where are you going all dressed up?

375
00:25:05,682 --> 00:25:09,377
Now that I've recovered,
I want to find a job.

376
00:25:09,377 --> 00:25:11,506
That's what you want as well.
Both of us to work.

377
00:25:11,506 --> 00:25:12,922
Who's going to look after Sae Byeok?

378
00:25:12,922 --> 00:25:15,538
Who could look after him but you?

379
00:25:15,538 --> 00:25:16,487
Listen to you.

380
00:25:16,511 --> 00:25:18,511
What about your grandmother?

381
00:25:18,535 --> 00:25:20,849
I was solely responsible
for helping you recover as well.

382
00:25:20,849 --> 00:25:23,986
As you know,
my grandmother doesn't have a good back.

383
00:25:24,281 --> 00:25:28,090
I'll land a job in no time
and give you lots of spending money.

384
00:25:28,325 --> 00:25:32,928
You're making me do all the work.
This is so frustrating.

385
00:25:33,428 --> 00:25:37,833
Why did Sang Hyuk have to pick someone
who is only worth an Animal card?

386
00:25:37,857 --> 00:25:39,524
It's so upsetting.

387
00:25:39,525 --> 00:25:43,008
Mother, if you have 5 Animal cards,
it counts as 1 point.

388
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:45,008
Do you know how useful that is?

389
00:25:45,032 --> 00:25:46,874
- Goodness.
- If you have 6, it's 2 points.

390
00:25:46,874 --> 00:25:48,308
With 7, you win.

391
00:25:48,871 --> 00:25:53,315
Mother, I'll become worth 7 Animal cards
and take good care of you.

392
00:25:53,949 --> 00:25:55,133
I'll be on my way.

393
00:25:55,133 --> 00:25:58,887
Geez. You're all talk.

394
00:25:58,894 --> 00:26:03,830
(All Event)

395
00:26:05,737 --> 00:26:08,565
Congratulations, Seon Hwa.
I heard you had a son.

396
00:26:08,565 --> 00:26:10,498
Thanks to you,

397
00:26:10,498 --> 00:26:13,669
I had the baby safely,
and I'm going to return to work.

398
00:26:14,069 --> 00:26:15,058
So soon?

399
00:26:15,058 --> 00:26:17,547
I underwent postnatal care
and am all better now.

400
00:26:17,572 --> 00:26:19,283
I can do everything.

401
00:26:19,283 --> 00:26:21,910
Senior Manager, I want to work.

402

Doors closing.

403

Fourth floor.

404
00:26:47,402 --> 00:26:48,770
Excuse me.

405
00:26:51,073 --> 00:26:53,308
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

406
00:26:59,681 --> 00:27:02,050
What do we do?
The coffee might be left on your shirt.

407
00:27:02,584 --> 00:27:05,087
It's okay. It'll only stain.

408
00:27:05,887 --> 00:27:08,590
- Are you doing okay?
- I'm doing good.

409
00:27:10,926 --> 00:27:12,294
You didn't burn yourself, did you?

410
00:27:16,987 --> 00:27:17,889
Hey.

411
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:21,071
Someone might see us.

412
00:27:21,071 --> 00:27:22,057
See you later.

413
00:27:45,243 --> 00:27:46,377
Yes, Sang Hyuk.

414
00:27:46,377 --> 00:27:49,001
I came out in a while.
Can you guess where I am?

415
00:27:49,026 --> 00:27:50,179
Where are you?

416
00:27:50,179 --> 00:27:53,273
I'm in the department store
near Daekook Confectionery.

417
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:54,770
Can you come out for a bit?

418
00:27:54,977 --> 00:27:57,406
I have to buy your clothes,
so meet me here.

419
00:27:57,773 --> 00:27:59,044
You should try it on before buying.

420
00:28:01,001 --> 00:28:02,043
Okay.

421
00:28:02,043 --> 00:28:04,043
I'll check out the clothes,

422
00:28:04,638 --> 00:28:06,181
so call me when you get here.

423
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:17,069
- Gosh. Seriously. That hurts.
- What do you think you're doing?

424
00:28:17,094 --> 00:28:18,967
You're a student.

425
00:28:18,967 --> 00:28:21,175
How dare you try
to steal someone else's stuff?

426
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,986
I said it hurts.

427
00:28:22,986 --> 00:28:25,467
Hey. Where do you go to school?
Say it now!

428
00:28:25,847 --> 00:28:28,079
Let go of my arm. It hurts.

429
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:29,688
This won't do.
You're going to the police station,

430
00:28:29,688 --> 00:28:31,058
so you don't ever do this again!

431
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:36,344
Are you okay?

432

(The Second Husband)

433
00:29:13,901 --> 00:29:16,718
I also sang a soundtrack for a drama
where my face was not shown.

434
00:29:16,742 --> 00:29:18,661
- How do you feel about singing trot?
- Trot?

435
00:29:18,661 --> 00:29:23,044
He's desirable.
He's charming, capable, and bright.

436
00:29:23,069 --> 00:29:25,364
What did you think about my song?
Whether it's trot or ballad,

437
00:29:25,364 --> 00:29:28,208
I'll do anything as long as I can sing.

438
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:30,661
Would it be okay
if my boyfriend joined us?

439
00:29:30,661 --> 00:29:33,735
- He'll be here soon.
- I'd like that. I'm curious.
