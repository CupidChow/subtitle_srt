[Previously...]

00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:42,380
<i>Smallpox is a very contagious disease.</i>

8
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:46,990
<i>Make sure no other prince or princess visits.</i>

9
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,320
<i>Yes.</i>

10
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,830
<i>A prince has smallpox.</i>

11
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:55,860
<i>It will probably spread among the people, too.</i>

12
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,720
<i>Your Majesty must care for the people.</i>

13
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,760
<i>I will watch over</i>

14
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,660
<i>Seongnyeong.</i>

15
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,660
<i>My son is this sick, and yet,</i>

16
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,610
<i>I should go and</i>

17
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,980
<i>care for the people first?</i>

18
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,320
<i>Will he...</i>

19
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,210
<i>survive?</i>

20
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,890
<i>You must save him.</i>

21
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:50,270
<i>You have to save him at all costs.</i>

22
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,650
<i>Please...</i>

23
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,850
<i>save him.</i>

24
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,720
Please take care of the Queen.

25
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,090
Yes, Your Majesty.

26
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,380
Work with the Mayor of Hanseongbu

27
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:34,450
to find out how many in the city have smallpox

28
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,430
and have them quarantined.

29
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,560
I will provide for those quarantined

30
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,770
from my own royal storehouses.

31
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:44,280
Yes.

32
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,620
How is Seongnyeong doing?

33
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,000
He has fallen asleep after drinking a tonic.

34
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:00,320
- And the Queen?
- She is by his side always.

35
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,560
[Episode 12]

36
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,880
Grand Prince Chungnyeong.

37
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,370
What brings you here?

38
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,820
Were you reading through medical books?

39
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:04,470
Yes, hoping I could help Grand Prince Seongnyeong.

40
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:08,290
I, too, came for that reason.

41
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,450
Naetaksan?

42
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,120
The Royal Physician prescribed

43
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,980
sodokeum and hwadeuktang.

44
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,490
I have consulted the ancient medical books

45
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,420
for pediatric treatments.

46
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:22,180
For smallpox, pus forms on the third day.

47
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,840
Thus, I will ask about

48
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,560
prescribing naetaksan as well

49
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,650
to help expel the pus well.

50
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,710
Seeing how much you are trying,

51
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:36,820
Grand Prince Seongnyeong will surely get well.

52
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:40,790
By chance, is there anything I can help you with?

53
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,410
Your Majesty, the Royal Physician is prescribing

54
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:49,460
naetaksan to reduce the pus.

55
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,220
Naetaksan...

56
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,870
Good job.

57
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:06,120
I am praying to the gods of heaven and earth.

58
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,430
Thank you.

59
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,850
With the help of Court Lady Jeong,

60
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,960
I am ensuring order and discipline

61
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,950
of the palace maids are maintained flawlessly.

62
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:20,460
So you do not need to worry.

63
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,900
All right.

64
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,160
I have watched...

65
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,710
Your Majesty all my life.

66
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:31,030
Seeing you like this...

67
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:34,620
I am afraid you may fall ill.

68
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,550
I wondered what drying up with worry meant.

69
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,830
Now,

70
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,980
I completely understand what that means.

71
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,190
Princess, what brings you here?

72
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,990
I was looking for a tonic to give to Her Majesty.

73
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,990
What is this?

74
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,340
That is Suhexiang oil.

75
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,000
Has it gone bad?

76
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,440
- Pardon?
- Are these little specks bugs?

77
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,240
Oh, yes...

78
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,120
Suhexiang oil is a medicine for His Majesty.

79
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,830
Was it like this when you received it? Or...

80
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,560
did you store it

81
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,540
incorrectly after you received it?

82
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,140
I-I did not store it incorrectly.

83
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,820
Then,

84
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,250
who supplied this product?

85
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:18,160
<i>The Secretary of Royal Orders who was dismissed.</i>

86
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,750
<i>Yu Sa Nul?</i>

87
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,180
<i>Yes.</i>

88
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:27,000
<i>One of his followers supplied this</i>

89
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,780
<i>and he is Court Lady Kim's brother.</i>

90
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,230
<i>His Majesty is here.</i>

91
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,950
Did you get some sleep?

92
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,020
I will watch over Seongnyeong,

93
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,690
so you should get some rest, Queen.

94
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,860
After giving birth to Seongnyeong,

95
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,930
I thought the heavens

96
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:44,940
sent us this child to prevent us

97
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:49,050
from becoming divided.

98
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:55,360
Thus, I thought of him as a gift.

99
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,870
I am afraid.

100
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,100
I am so afraid...

101
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:15,030
that I might lose this child.

102
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,360
Seongnyeong.

103
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,990
Seongnyeong.

104
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:29,150
Seongnyeong! Seongnyeong...

105
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,180
Seongnyeong...

106
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,750
Seongnyeong!

107
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:40,760
Seongnyeong...

108
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:54,500
Seongnyeong...

109
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:15,430
Say your last farewell

110
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,440
to Prince Seongnyeong.

111
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,500
But where is the Crown Prince?

112
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:36,230
When your younger brother was dying,

113
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:39,710
were you shooting arrows at beasts?

114
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:42,830
When your younger brother was dying!

115
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,830
How can you...

116
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,180
call yourself human after this?

117
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:52,380
How can you call yourself human!

118
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,140
You bastard...

119
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,950
The king did not

120
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:09,800
get to see Seongyeong's body being prepared.

121
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,920
Because he is a monarch,

122
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,020
he did not even get to touch his casket

123
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,890
nor did he get to see his burial.

124
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,540
But,

125
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,540
you did all that for him.

126
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,840
Mother...

127
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,920
You acted...

128
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,410
dutifully as his older brother.

129
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:08,840
The Crown Prince went drinking outside the palace

130
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,770
and shamed himself before the people.

131
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:14,310
At a previous hunt, the Crown Prince

132
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:18,480
harmed the people by injuring their livestock.

133
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,910
The Crown Prince listened to corrupt officials

134
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:24,480
and committed wrong by recklessly pursuing women.

135
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,330
You can tell through divine will

136
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:28,730
that the people's sentiment turned against him.

137
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:31,040
Depose the Crown Prince

138
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,660
and send him into exile.

139
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,640
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

140
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,740
<i>Depose the Crown Prince</i>

141
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,960
<i>and send him into exile.</i>

142
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,840
The State Council, the Three State Councilors,

143
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,130
the Six Ministries,

144
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:57,310
and the Supreme Military Command.

145
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,330
You have all gathered here.

146
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:00,630
All of you.

147
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,140
However,

148
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:06,480
none of you is standing up for the Crown Prince.

149
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,460
Shall I open the door?

150
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,940
The sunlight is nice outside.

151
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:44,000
Your Majesty, I will open the door.

152
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,460
<i>I mean it.</i>

153
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:56,570
<i>The color green has a scent to it.</i>

154
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,030
The King will

155
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,670
depose you from being Crown Prince.

156
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,880
Do not be flustered when the royal decree is issued.

157
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:44,740
Maintain your dignity as Crown Prince to the end.

158
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,070
Yes.

159
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,990
Even if you are deposed as Crown Prince,

160
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:56,480
your position as the eldest son will not change.

161
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:00,850
I really...

162
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,410
wanted to tell you this.

163
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:06,070
Chungnyeong is...

164
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:09,710
very similar to Father.

165
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,240
Chungnyeong?

166
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,500
He knows what he wants to do for the people.

167
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,780
He has ambition

168
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,920
and determination.

169
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,840
If there was one thing different,

170
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,740
Father...

171
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,720
did not have a mother like you.

172
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:37,490
Crown Prince.

173
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:39,780
I will get along with my brothers.

174
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:44,900
I will live the rest of my life enjoying myself. So...

175
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,190
please do not worry about me.

176
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,660
Thank you.

177
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,450
The Crown Prince's actions were utterly improper

178
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:12,320
and the officials petitioned that

179
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,040
he could not inherit the nation.

180
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,470
Thus, Crown Prince Je will be deposed

181
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:20,600
and re-titled as Grand Prince Yangnyeong.

182
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:29,820
Yangyeong, the deposed Crown Prince, has two sons.

183
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,740
The eldest is six years old,

184
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,950
and the second is three years old.

185
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:38,410
Grand Prince Yangnyeong's eldest son will be my heir.

186
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:42,000
Thus, carefully consider and report

187
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,500
whether you will call him Wangseson or Wangtaeson.

188
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,500
<i>Yes.</i>

189
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:03,420
I asked to see you royal advisors

190
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:06,180
regarding choosing the next Crown Prince.

191
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,490
The King wants

192
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:12,350
deposed Crown Prince Yangnyeong's eldest son.

193
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:14,360
But I am against it.

194
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,330
But Your Majesty,

195
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:18,700
who can dare go against His Majesty's will?

196
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,860
You must risk your life to go against his will.

197
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:24,630
His Majesty forges ahead once he makes a decision.

198
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,420
He does not listen to others.

199
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,020
I will find a way to open His Majesty's ears.

200
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:34,000
So, advise on who is fit to be the Crown Prince.

201
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,910
Advise him to the best of

202
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,810
your ability as royal advisors.

203
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:45,280
Of all people, how could you do this to me?

204
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,440
The Suhexiang oil offered to the King was spoiled.

205
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,100
And that was supplied by your brother.

206
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,180
That is news to me.

207
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,910
It probably went bad after he supplied it.

208
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:59,710
That is why I am saying we should find out

209
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,930
if it was before or after he supplied it.

210
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:04,930
I am asking why you are stepping in to do that!

211
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:06,620
Since...

212
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,310
I cannot just let you be.

213
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,080
Pardon?

214
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,820
Early morning of the Royal Sericulture Ceremony day,

215
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:16,400
you poured Changija into Her Majesty's bathwater.

216
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,210
Prolonged exposure could kill her with liver damage!

217
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,410
Did you see it yourself?

218
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:27,470
Are you not just assuming this?

219
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:28,960
You have no evidence.

220
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,680
I left no evidence, thinking you were my ally.

221
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,450
I regretted it

222
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:37,690
and blamed myself.

223
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:41,750
Since when did you become a devotee of the Queen?

224
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,870
Since when?

225
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:48,610
When one climbs from the bottom to the top,

226
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:50,520
it is hard to see the bottom

227
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,280
since their viewpoint has been elevated.

228
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,240
However, when the one at the top comes down,

229
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:00,200
do you know what the first thing you see is?

230
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,320
It is the lowest of the low.

231
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,150
I saw your lowest side.

232
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,680
So...

233
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,460
are you saying you will side with the Queen now?

234
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:16,040
I am loyal to anyone who takes me in.

235
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,900
Of all people, how did you not realize that?

236
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,650
<i>Princess, I will enter.</i>

237
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,210
Take her out.

238
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:33,660
Let go. Let go!

239
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,090
The Crown Prince will bring back

240
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:37,190
Anseong Buwongun after he becomes king.

241
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:39,860
You should not do this to me if you consider that!

242
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:43,050
Unfortunately, I do not think that will happen.

243
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:44,620
Goodbye.

244
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,460
Take her away.

245
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,260
Let go! Princess!

246
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,130
Princess!

247
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:53,640
Let go! Princess!

248
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:14,030
When the Crown Prince is selected,

249
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:16,560
I want to become the Crown Prince's tutor.

250
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,440
You want to become the Crown Prince's teacher?

251
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,630
Yes.

252
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:22,380
Why?

253
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,500
First,

254
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,340
unlike other subjects,

255
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:30,350
I will not use my teacher status to gain power.

256
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,500
Second,

257
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,170
I want to teach him well

258
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:36,570
what kind of person needs to become king.

259
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:39,920
What kind of person needs to become king?

260
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:43,200
A long time ago, a king once said

261
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,500
the heavens raise up a king

262
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,690
not because it loves the king,

263
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:50,310
but for the benefit of all the people.

264
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:53,830
Those are Taesangwang's words.

265
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:56,780
A king who loves his people.

266
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,580
Without selfish motives,

267
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:01,370
I will pass down to the new Crown Prince

268
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:03,820
the wisdom I have learned.

269
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,500
Selfish motives...

270
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:11,480
Do you really not have any selfish motives?

271
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,400
When I look at you, you have selfish motives.

272
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,010
- Mother.
- You have a thirst

273
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:24,730
for what you want to achieve if you obtain power.

274
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:26,120
No, I merely just-

275
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,220
If you cannot become the King,

276
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,980
is it not that you want to quench

277
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:34,190
that thirst by becoming the Crown Prince's tutor?

278
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,570
That is a selfish motive.

279
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:46,850
I know very well what Father is worried about.

280
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:51,440
That is why I am trying not to get ambitious.

281
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:15,000
You seem deep in thought.

282
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,270
Chungnyeong is the right choice as Crown Prince.

283
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:21,580
All the royal advisors are petitioning saying that.

284
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:24,750
The Queen probably told them to do so.

285
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:27,350
What are you thinking of doing?

286
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,740
I have enough time to

287
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,040
teach Yangnyeong's eldest to be king.

288
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,020
<i>Your Majesty, with all due respect,</i>

289
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,080
<i>the Queen has asked for you.</i>

290
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,160
It is late.

291
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:40,930
You should go.

292
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:43,630
It must be important if she asked

293
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:45,960
for you at this hour.

294
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:23,610
<i>His Majesty is here.</i>

295
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,820
Why is the deposed Crown Prince here at this hour

296
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,720
when he should be outside the palace?

297
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,570
I secretly called him in.

298
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,200
Last time, you told me

299
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,600
that Chungnyeong is similar to His Majesty.

300
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:59,310
Yes.

301
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,700
You also said you will not seek power

302
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:06,130
and get along with your younger brothers.

303
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,520
Yes.

304
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:17,800
Could you swear that before His Majesty?

305
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:24,660
Yes, Mother.

306
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,140
I, deposed Crown Prince,

307
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,780
dared to return to the palace

308
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:33,690
to alleviate your concerns.

309
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:36,810
- Concern?
- I will not resent you, Father,

310
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:42,870
for deposing me as Crown Prince.

311
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:46,280
If anyone approaches me seeking power,

312
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:50,480
I will slay him without hesitation.

313
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,300
If one of my younger brothers rises to the throne,

314
00:29:57,410 --> 00:30:01,770
I will become his loyal subject.

315
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:05,250
One of your younger brothers...

316
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:09,440
Did the Queen order you to do this?

317
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:13,850
There is no longer any conflict among brothers.

318
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:16,010
Yangnyeong pledges like this.

319
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:17,730
Queen.

320
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:19,050
During the Year of the Yellow Tiger,

321
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,660
Crown Prince Yi Bang Seok

322
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,420
and Prince Muwon Yi Bang Beon.

323
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:26,410
Killing those two younger brothers to become king

324
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:29,980
was not Your Majesty's fault.

325
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:33,050
What are you suddenly saying?

326
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:36,120
It was the will of the heavens.

327
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,030
The heavens raise up a king

328
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:43,120
not because it loves the king,

329
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,440
but for the benefit of all the people.

330
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,730
These are Taesangwang's words.

331
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,480
It was divine will.

332
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,950
Please...

333
00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:02,410
face with whom that divine will

334
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:04,580
lies.

335
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:21,650
I will be going now, Father.

336
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:25,040
Mother.

337
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:17,670
The stars look extra bright tonight.

338
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:22,200
That one star over there

339
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,140
is shining bright blue.

340
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:44,200
I wish to give the Commentary on the Great Learning

341
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,110
I copied for the Crown Prince to Chungnyeong.

342
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:03,590
<i>Though it may be a heavy burden,</i>

343
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,360
<i>it is up to you</i>

344
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,080
<i>whether you wish to bear it.</i>

345
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,890
<i>Once you decide,</i>

346
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:13,650
<i>come to show the King your resolve.</i>

347
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:13,120
In a conversation, Mencius told King Xuan of Qi

348
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,730
the people are the most important,

349
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:16,730
and the king is the least important.

350
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:18,970
If a king cannot govern benevolently,

351
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:20,970
what would happen?

352
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:24,120
With all due respect,

353
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:27,420
a king must always remember that

354
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:30,290
the people can raise an iron mace against him.

355
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:32,980
I believe that is what he was teaching.

356
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,970
Chungnyeong.

357
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:41,850
I believe that your rebellion in the Year of the

358
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:44,630
Yellow Tiger was an iron mace

359
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:47,500
against an undeserving Crown Prince.

360
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:03,600
Chungnyeong.

361
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,030
Yes.

362
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,980
Do you want to become King?

363
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:12,290
Yes.

364
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:15,290
What kind of king do you want to become?

365
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:18,450
I want to become a king who places his people

366
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:25,060
at the top of this world and fears the people.

367
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:34,080
It is time for me to come down from

368
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:39,660
the back of this tiger that I have been riding.

369
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:45,680
Take the Queen's Commentary on the Great Learning.

370
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,150
Take it with you

371
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:51,320
and go find out what kind of king

372
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,750
places his people at the top of this world

373
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:58,710
and fears the people.

374
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:01,050
Yes, Father.

375
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:03,990
[Tae Jong Yi Bang Won: Third King of Joseon]

376
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:46,780
[King Se Jong the Great]

377
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,680
Minister of Finance, listen.

378
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:11,170
The rice has not ripened this year due to rain.

379
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:13,290
As a result, the people's suffering is deep.

380
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:16,980
Have the regional inspectors investigate damages.

381
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,350
Yes, Your Majesty.

382
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:21,390
I have notes from my prince days on relief laws,

383
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:23,200
so you can reference that.

384
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,120
<i>Yes, Your Majesty.</i>

385
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,390
Minister of Defense, hear me.

386
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,400
Our Joseon lacks the copper

387
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,310
necessary for producing military weapons.

388
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,070
Reference the weapons used in Ming.

389
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:40,570
More importantly, focus on producing copper.

390
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:43,290
<i>Yes, Your Majesty.</i>

391
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:45,580
Also,

392
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,250
Min Mu Gu,

393
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:48,820
Min Mu Jil,

394
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,730
Min Mu Hyul,

395
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:53,340
Min Mu Hoe.

396
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:56,490
They are the Former Queen's younger brothers.

397
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:59,220
While they were punished for their sins,

398
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:02,350
their families also became recognized as sinners.

399
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:08,410
I would like for you to take care of them.

400
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:11,530
Min Mu Gu, Min Mu Jil, Min Mu Hyul, and Min Mu Hoe.

401
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:14,650
The Justice Minister should examine relevant laws

402
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:16,920
for their families to live freely in the outskirts.

403
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,700
However, Your Majesty,

404
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:23,220
they all committed acts of disloyalty.

405
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:26,860
You cannot forgive them because you became king.

406
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:29,610
This was the order from Sangwang.

407
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,700
Thus,

408
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,060
I am bound to carry this out.

409
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:43,720
[Year 1420, Second year of Se Jong's reign]

410
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:06,470
We should go to Gaegyeong together.

411
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:10,170
Why Gaegyeong all of a sudden?

412
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:13,140
I miss it.

413
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:19,460
In Gaegyeong, we were young.

414
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:24,790
Do you miss the days of your youth?

415
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:27,860
I do.

416
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,680
If I were to go back to my youth,

417
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,160
would I have sought to become King again?

418
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:41,360
If I had not become King, what would have happened?

419
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:50,030
Did you not love me because I sought to be King?

420
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,930
You went through a lot...

421
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:57,410
serving as King.

422
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:02,230
I only made it to this point, thanks to you.

423
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:08,100
If a woman could rise to the throne,

424
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:16,290
you would have been a much better monarch than me.

425
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,150
After you first became King

426
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:24,350
at Suchang Palace,

427
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:26,960
you asked me

428
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:31,110
if I wanted to sit on the throne.

429
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,470
Back then, I could not answer you.

430
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:42,300
After that, I thought about it for a long time

431
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:46,720
whether I wanted to sit on the throne.

432
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:51,490
Yes, I wanted to.

433
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,660
However, I realized it over time.

434
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:00,980
Did I seek power?

435
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:07,630
No, what I sought was not power but the world.

436
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,770
Because I sought the world,

437
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:15,360
I thought to myself,

438
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:20,130
who cares who sat on the throne?

439
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:36,120
We will leave for Gaegyeong early in the morning,

440
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:40,320
so we should rest early today.

441
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:08,800
Former Queen.

442
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,760
Former Queen.

443
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,250
I will enter.

444
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,860
Former Queen, Former Queen!

445
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:26,970
Former Queen! Former Queen! Former Queen!

446
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,010
She has malaria.

447
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:44,700
Malaria?

448
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:50,420
You do not need to be alarmed.

449
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:55,070
Then, what should we do?

450
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:58,120
Because she alternates between being cold and hot,

451
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,560
I need to consider whether to use a warm medicine

452
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,750
or a cold medicine based on her state.

453
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:07,170
I will be going to Gaegyeong with Sangwang.

454
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:08,950
That is not possible.

455
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:12,340
Though you are fine now, your symptoms come and go,

456
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,510
so you must not take this lightly.

457
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:18,440
Then, are you telling me to enter into a medical retreat?

458
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:21,090
I do not want to do that.

459
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:27,680
Then,

460
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:32,180
how about we go while being very cautious?

461
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:35,300
I wrote this at Hoeamsa in the Year of the Red Tiger.

462
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,160
If it is the Year of the Red Tiger,

463
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,960
do you mean when I killed Pan Su

464
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:53,740
and you left the palace?

465
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:03,740
I felt that I would not have the opportunity

466
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,700
to give this to you if I did not do so now.

467
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:44,830
<i>What if we had not become King and Queen?</i>

468
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:46,540
<i>Why did we think</i>

469
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:51,680
<i>saving the world was the only meaningful life?</i>

470
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:58,560
<i>I am realizing here that I would have</i>

471
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,670
<i>been truly happy</i>

472
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:07,230
<i>as long as you were by my side</i>

473
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,650
<i>even if I lived an ordinary life.</i>

474
00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:53,450
Queen!

475
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:02,740
Former Queen...

476
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:05,070
you have to endure it even if it is cold.

477
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:07,410
We need to lower your fever.

478
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,430
I will do it.

479
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:55,710
Let us go back.

480
00:47:57,730 --> 00:47:59,760
Let us go to Gaegyeong

481
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:02,380
next time.

482
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:05,170
Let us go next time.

483
00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:47,950
We will go to

484
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:51,200
a subject's house for a medical retreat tomorrow.

485
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:55,020
- So, a bit longer-
- I know this illness.

486
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,170
Did I...

487
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:11,940
bring this on you?

488
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:13,850
No.

489
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:18,760
They say birth and death are the will of heaven.

490
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:24,890
Do not cry in secret.

491
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:31,790
I can sense your sorrow even behind my back.

492
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:41,920
Right now,

493
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:46,550
I am just happy

494
00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:51,040
to be able to feel your touch

495
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:55,750
while I am fully conscious.

496
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:20,220
Who is able to cure the Former Queen's malaria?

497
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,060
Search far and wide.

498
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:25,780
I will send my posthorses.

499
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:28,350
If anyone is able to cure her,

500
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:32,070
I will reward him greatly.

501
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:34,950
<i>Yes, Your Majesty.</i>

502
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,080
This was made with

503
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,430
tribute abalone from Gijang, Busanbu.

504
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:48,770
It is called the wild ginseng of the sea.

505
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:52,770
So, Mother...

506
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:55,790
please eat all of it.

507
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:17,540
I feel like I am getting stronger already.

508
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:24,610
Under the pretext of avoiding malaria,

509
00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:26,930
we are moving from house to house from

510
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:31,890
General Gwak Seung Woo's house to Deputy Mayor Yi Maeng Yu

511
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:35,020
and Buwongun Kim Seung Ju's house.

512
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:38,680
- Father.
- If I could only save her,

513
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:41,890
I could even pray to a ghost.

514
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:43,590
However,

515
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:49,530
let us stop now.

516
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:51,430
Father.

517
00:51:54,730 --> 00:51:57,930
I cannot let her die outside the palace.

518
00:51:57,930 --> 00:52:02,550
You should personally bring her to the palace.

519
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:07,010
I wish to send her off with honors befitting the

520
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:11,460
true hero who built the foundation of this dynasty.

521
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:20,240
Yes, Father.

522
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,530
Court Lady Seo.

523
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:37,320
Since you personally await the Former Queen,

524
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:40,630
I am sure she will be touched, Sangwang.

525
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:45,880
It is nothing compared to what she did for me.

526
00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:51,800
How is the Former Queen?

527
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:55,640
When I visited her yesterday,

528
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:02,340
her voice and appearance were as always.
