[Filming of animals or child actors followed production guidelines.]

5
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,450
Your Majesty!

6
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,560
Return to the palace first.

7
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,480
Yes, Your Majesty.

8
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,520
Chae Ryeong.

9
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:38,880
You should tell the King directly.

10
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,120
Yes...

11
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,110
Your Majesty.

12
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,020
[Episode 6]

13
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,660
<i>Who is the one providing information to the Queen?</i>

14
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,940
<i>I received orders from His Majesty.</i>

15
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,530
<i>What will you report to him?</i>

16
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,330
<i>I did not...</i>

17
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,900
<i>see anything noteworthy, so...</i>

18
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,310
But if you go to the King and say otherwise,

19
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,110
I will kick you out of the palace.

20
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,050
<i>Will you accept it?</i>

21
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:41,300
<i>Yes, Your Majesty.</i>

22
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:04,650
I know why you invited the King to come to this banquet, Father.

23
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:11,070
I am glad the King accepted my invitation.

24
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:16,210
However, it is in times like these that we have to be more careful.

25
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:21,250
The gazes directed at our Min family have grown sharper.

26
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,700
Yes.

27
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,120
I will keep that in mind.

28
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:32,380
But, Your Majesty,

29
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:37,090
privately meeting with an informant is too dangerous.

30
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:43,320
You know that the King is no ordinary man.

31
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,460
Your Majesty.

32
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:21,640
I felt bad about taking the Queen with me to the palace in such a rush

33
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,530
without seeing you, Father.

34
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,470
No, Your Majesty.

35
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:29,110
I am honored that you visited my humble abode.

36
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:32,020
Please, come inside.

37
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:46,290
It is great that we are all here together like this.

38
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:49,350
Your Majesty, I hope the food is to your liking.

39
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,610
Oh, the food is great.

40
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,290
I will pour you a drink.

41
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,560
Yes, please do.

42
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,580
It has been a while, yes.

43
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,770
The wine is sweet!

44
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:01,430
Sir.

45
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:04,190
Aigoo, look who it is.

46
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,370
Here it is.

47
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,940
Please have a glass of this.

48
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,230
- The food is delicious.
- Yes, I agree.

49
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,140
Aigoo, it's good.

50
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,220
It's amazing.

51
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,530
When you took in Sungkyunkwan Music Researcher Kwon Hong's daughter as a concubine,

52
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:27,070
there were many rumors on the streets

53
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:29,920
that you were deposing the queen.

54
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,550
Father, you do not have to worry about such things.

55
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,790
Your Majesty's grace knows no bounds.

56
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,610
That is a strong wine from Ming.

57
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,180
Where did you get it?

58
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,690
The local official brought it.

59
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:56,430
Strong wine from Ming is worth at least 160 kg of rice.

60
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:00,110
Then, did you also receive their help when you bought farmland in Gaegyeong

61
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,700
for an extremely low price?

62
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:06,810
That is...

63
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:12,280
Yeoganggun, pay for the strong wine from Ming you received from that local official.

64
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,750
Pardon?

65
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:20,140
Yes, Your Majesty.

66
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:29,060
Your Majesty, the wine is going down so smoothly on this fine day.

67
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,300
All right, let us drink!

68
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,560
- Let us drink.
- Drink up!

69
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,960
- Sounds great!
- Drink up.

70
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,550
I feel we will not have enough wine.

71
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:41,040
Bring out some more wine!

72
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,600
Take a glass from me.

73
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,700
Wait here.

74
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,160
Goodness...

75
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:11,040
Did you see their faces when the King used the strong wine from the Ming

76
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,230
to crush the arrogance of the Min family?

77
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:17,320
At first, I wondered why I was dragged here.

78
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,050
I guess I came to witness that spectacle.

79
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:26,290
I mean, even the Queen's face turned pale.

80
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:30,270
I do not think the King believes only the Min family does that.

81
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:33,590
Who do you mean? The King?

82
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:37,440
He did that to show us all.

83
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,720
In any case, they ended up receiving more backlash for their efforts.

84
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,400
Are you referring to the Min family?

85
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,900
Let us go.

86
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,700
The alcohol is not wearing off.

87
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,430
I cannot shake it off.

88
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:05,240
Did you see the way the King looked at us when he talked about the strong wine?

89
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,680
Why?

90
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,700
It was scary.

91
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,230
He tends to look at people like that sometimes

92
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,610
with an unpleasant look.

93
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:20,630
He was like that in the past, too.

94
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,930
It was different from before.

95
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:26,670
He is definitely wary of us.

96
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:35,600
I will go prepare some medicine to soothe your stomach.

97
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,800
No, no.

98
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,890
It is better for you to just stay by my side right now.

99
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:45,070
I do not want people fussing over me.

100
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:48,120
You drank too much.

101
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,610
I did so because I felt I should not drink less than everyone else.

102
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,810
I am the King after all.

103
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:59,600
People do not pay attention to things like that.

104
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,250
They do pay attention to it.

105
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,040
They pay attention to everything about me.

106
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,070
They watch closely

107
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:09,350
and wait for the right moment to exploit any weakness.

108
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,740
<i>I am afraid.</i>

109
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,070
<i>Do not be afraid.</i>

110
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:21,790
<i>The history stands with us tonight.</i>

111
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,720
<i>No!</i>

112
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:44,740
<i>How dare you!</i>

113
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:03,900
When Yeong Mu and Yeong Gyu swung their mace

114
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:07,060
and blood splattered from Po Eun's shattered head,

115
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:10,340
I felt myself starting to vomit.

116
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:18,370
I just cannot get used to the stench of blood.

117
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:30,080
Are you all right, Dear Wife?

118
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:34,840
It is revolting for me as well.

119
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,670
But?

120
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:41,000
We have already made our choice, and we cannot turn back.

121
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,540
People say you should not look down when you are on top of a cliff

122
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:51,770
because if you take the wrong step out of fear, you will fall.

123
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:58,240
And so, I will only look straight ahead.

124
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:09,090
When I think about it, I wonder if you were better suited to be a king than me.

125
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:30,860
Congratulations.

126
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,360
Congratulations.

127
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,670
Congratulations.

128
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,800
But why did you keep it to yourself?

129
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,250
I was afraid I may jinx it,

130
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,550
so I waited until my pregnancy became stable.

131
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,260
That could lead to big trouble.

132
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,040
In the future, you must let us know right away.

133
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,470
Yes.

134
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:07,810
When you give birth to an offspring of the King, you will receive the position of concubine.

135
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,850
We will prepare to move you to a pavilion worthy of your position.

136
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:13,120
Thank you.

137
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,930
We will also need to assign a court lady. I will prepare a smart girl-

138
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:21,390
I would like to ask someone else to be my court lady.

139
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:24,610
I will search for a smart girl to serve her.

140
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:32,000
Oh, yes. That is fine.

141
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:41,700
[Gaegyeong]

142
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:47,930
<i>The King will come to your quarters tonight.</i>

143
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:06,180
Did you find out whom the Queen met at her private residence?

144
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,780
I clearly saw her meeting with someone.

145
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:14,380
However, I was unable to see who that person was.

146
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,860
Is that so?

147
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,490
I see.

148
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,700
Also,

149
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,500
I have great news to tell you.

150
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,810
I am pregnant.

151
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:38,680
Really? Thank you.

152
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,990
I will bear you a prince.

153
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:43,890
All right. You should be careful at all times.

154
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:47,100
I will tell the Chief Court Lady to take extra care of you.

155
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,290
I am honored.

156
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,960
But does the Queen know about this?

157
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,600
Pardon?

158
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,600
Yes, she knows.

159
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,480
All right, then.

160
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,340
Fish or meat that has not been fully cooked must not be served on her table.

161
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,170
Yes, Court Lady.

162
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,500
Also, you must not serve any raw persimmon or shellfish.

163
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,820
Make sure to take extra care.

164
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,950
Yes, I understand.

165
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,570
But Court Lady.

166
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:39,160
What is it?

167
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,770
If Favored Court Lady is pregnant now,

168
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:44,970
then what will happen to Her Majesty?

169
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,610
What do you mean?

170
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:53,710
I was concerned that His Majesty's affections might only be for Favored Court Lady.

171
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:59,770
Her Majesty is the leader of the palace ladies.

172
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:02,560
How disloyal of you to compare them in that manner?

173
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,640
I am sorry.

174
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,300
I am worried that Her Majesty

175
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:19,010
will end up like a dog helplessly staring at the roof after chasing a chicken.

176
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,320
Is the palace...

177
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,180
an animal farm?

178
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:29,420
Then, who is the chicken, and who is the dog?

179
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,000
Tell me. Tell me!

180
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,950
Who is the chicken, and who is the dog!

181
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,600
I heard that you are pregnant.

182
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,450
Goodness, this is such good news.

183
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:56,920
Thank you.

184
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,750
And here.

185
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,070
Her Majesty sent these.

186
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:03,780
They are ginseng and deer antlers.

187
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,880
She said since your hands and feet tend to get cold,

188
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,970
your pregnancy may not yet be stable,

189
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,470
so she said you should take extra care.

190
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:19,070
Please give birth to a prince.

191
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,060
Thank you.

192
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:25,410
Are you now rising to such a high position

193
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:29,430
that someone like me cannot even reach?

194
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:38,310
This act is to clearly define

195
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:41,570
the hierarchy of who bestows and who receives.

196
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,180
Yes.

197
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:47,120
And you have to always remember

198
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,470
Court Lady Seo is the Queen's servant.

199
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:56,520
Yes.

200
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:04,320
I delivered it to Favored Court Lady.

201
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,310
Great work.

202
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:11,030
It is good news,

203
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:16,930
but when I think about Your Majesty, my heart aches a bit.

204
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:18,690
Are you all right?

205
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:20,940
She is a sensitive child.

206
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:27,030
You should take extra care of her until she gives birth.

207
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,690
She is now also pregnant,

208
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:35,200
so I am worried His Majesty's affection will only be directed toward her. Honestly, I...

209
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,050
I do not know.

210
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:42,170
What if she gives birth to a prince like that?

211
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,360
If she gives birth to a prince,

212
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,550
I just need to raise him as my son.

213
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:56,840
Court Lady. Court Lady.

214
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,620
Are you not going to set up a date for the royal consummation?

215
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,710
It is the date of royal consummation of the King and Queen.

216
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:04,450
I cannot set the date just because I want to.

217
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,050
Still! Still!

218
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,650
Just set up a date!

219
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:10,950
Gosh, this woman!

220
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:18,770
Even if I were to set up the date, would the Queen accept it?

221
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:21,090
She will accept it.

222
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,070
Even if you become the king,

223
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:49,320
that position will not be set up for you.

224
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:53,780
It is a position that you must set up as you go.

225
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:58,100
Yes, Mother.

226
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:03,310
You will be wary of each step you take.

227
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,800
[Yi Je, Grand Prince Yangnyeong]

228
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,950
However, it is only when you move forward

229
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,510
boldly without being indecisive

230
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:15,030
that you become a king.

231
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:18,190
Yes, Mother.

232
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:57,280
I do not deserve to eat this.

233
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,670
I know with what state of mind you brought this back.

234
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:04,670
Take it with you and eat it.

235
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,990
Are you not pregnant with a child?

236
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:09,560
Your Majesty, but-

237
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:15,090
The royal child in your womb is like a royal child in my womb.

238
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:23,680
Shall I put in a word to the royal physician to boil it for you?

239
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,530
No, Your Majesty.

240
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,380
I am sorry.

241
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:33,980
You should focus on giving birth to a healthy child for the time being.

242
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,180
Instead of involving yourself in useless things.

243
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:05,170
<i>Did you not say that your body may belong to the King,</i>

244
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:08,140
<i>but your heart belongs to me?</i>

245
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:23,090
<i>Your Majesty, it appears Pan Su at the border</i>

246
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:26,170
<i>caught wind of military movements in Dongbukmyeon.</i>

247
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:30,490
<i>The only thing is, he insists on telling you in person.</i>

248
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,110
Your Majesty!

249
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:36,840
Jo Sa Eui has finally started a rebellion in Dongbukmyeon.

250
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,140
Even if Jo Sa Eui started a rebellion,

251
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,930
I am sure my father must be behind it.

252
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:46,770
I, the king, cannot fight against my own father.

253
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:48,980
Send Park Sun to appease him.

254
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,620
They have killed Park Sun and

255
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,180
are advancing to the regions of Deokcheon and Anju in Pyongan-do.

256
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,580
And nearby Gabyeolcho soldiers are joining their forces.

257
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,470
Appoint Jo Yeong Mu as the Commander-in-Chief

258
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:00,040
of Dongbukmyeon, Gangwon, Chungcheong, Gyeongsang, and Jeolla Provinces

259
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,000
and prevent sympathizing forces from joining the rebellion.

260
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,900
And send Jo Yeong Moo, Yi Cheon Woo, Kim Yeong Ryeol, Yi Gwi Cheol to Dongbukmyeon.

261
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,730
<i>Yes, Your Majesty.</i>

262
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:10,180
They have captured 100 of Yi Cheon Woo's horsemen.

263
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:13,100
Their army is around six to seven thousand men.

264
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,900
If the Uriankhai also join them, their forces would exceed 10,000 men.

265
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,150
Did you say the Uriankhai?

266
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:36,390
The Uriankhai are one of the Jurchen tribes,

267
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:40,590
who share a special bond with the Taesangwang.

268
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:43,880
Are there any other men who will join him apart from the Uriankhai?

269
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,350
No.

270
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:47,190
Then, that is fine.

271
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:52,500
Has Father entered Wonjung Port, as you mentioned before?

272
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,190
That is so.

273
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:56,040
All right.

274
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,710
The King is watching carefully.

275
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,620
Return safely.

276
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:15,470
Our forces between Hwangju and Bongju number 40,000.

277
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:18,160
Even if the Uriankhai join them, they are only 10,000.

278
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,890
The odds are in our favor.

279
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:25,470
However, if we engage in battle, countless soldiers will die.

280
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,170
They are all my people as well.

281
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,090
If I can bring my father here,

282
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:35,720
would we not be able to end the war without engaging in battle?

283
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,620
The Gabyeolcho were originally soldiers who followed Taesangwang.

284
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,070
They will scatter like grains of sand.

285
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:44,890
Your Majesty, give me the command.

286
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:48,440
I shall ride out and secure the Taesangwang.

287
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,780
Are you saying you will capture my father?

288
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:59,780
If so, I would become a king who killed his younger brother,

289
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:02,750
dethroned his older brother,

290
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:05,830
and seized his own father.

291
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,790
Then...

292
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:19,160
All we need to do is secure the Taesangwang.

293
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:24,130
Why is the King unable to make up his mind like that?

294
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:26,920
Think about it.

295
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,430
Though Jo Sa Eui started the rebellion,

296
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:32,270
Taesangwang is the one controlling him behind the scenes.

297
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,600
Everyone knows that!

298
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,530
Do you think the King does not know that?

299
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:40,470
Besides, we do not know where Taesangwang is.

300
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:43,910
We can figure that out once we capture Jo Sa Eui.

301
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:48,900
Then, a large-scale war would be inevitable.

302
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,950
He wants to avoid a war against his own father at all costs.

303
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,890
Where are you going?

304
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:00,250
Are you not going to go home?

305
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,690
There is a book I need to find in the palace.

306
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:05,850
A book in the palace?

307
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:07,660
You can leave first.

308
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,720
<i>Your Majesty, His Excellency Ha Ryun is here.</i>

309
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,300
Were you surprised that I asked you to come secretly?

310
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,820
No.

311
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:05,740
I am thinking of personally heading out to Dongbukmyeon.

312
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,770
Are you saying you will vacate the palace?

313
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:11,420
I cannot entrust someone else

314
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,700
with securing my father.

315
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,450
The regime is not stable yet.

316
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:19,390
If people find out the King has vacated the Palace-

317
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,950
You must

318
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:25,180
protect the palace in my place.

319
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:29,640
I understand.

320
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:39,630
I know that you are an expert in astrology and physiognomy.

321
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:42,740
I am deeply honored.

322
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,980
Thus, I have a question for you.

323
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,020
Please, ask away.

324
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,700
Yi Suk Beon...

325
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,740
What kind of energy does he have?

326
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:57,810
Is it that of a faithful subject or a traitorous subject?

327
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:04,820
That depends solely on how Your Majesty uses him,

328
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:08,300
but he does not have the energy of a traitorous subject.

329
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:12,550
He is not a traitorous subject, but whether he is a faithful subject or not depends on me?

330
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:13,960
That is so.

331
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,970
Then, what about the Queen?

332
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,820
Pardon?

333
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,090
W-What are you asking me?

334
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:25,650
I am asking about a king's energy.

335
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,410
Look at that constellation, Your Majesty.

336
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:46,660
I am referring to that red star.

337
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:51,280
That third star in that group of seven stars

338
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,190
is an ominous sign.

339
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:55,560
What do you mean by ominous?

340
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,840
It could be an omen of rebellion.

341
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,830
By rebellion, do you mean Dongbukmyeon?

342
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:05,840
The rebellion at Dongbukmyeon has already started.

343
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,490
So, that would not be an omen.

344
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:11,410
Then, Your Majesty,

345
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:15,810
how about you entrust the palace to Yeoheung Buwongun?

346
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:17,310
I should test them?

347
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:19,340
I will secretly watch them.

348
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:23,460
Are you saying the Queen is the center of a rebellion?

349
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:34,720
His Majesty will personally head out to Dongbukmyeon.

350
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,860
What? Personally?

351
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,970
Yes.

352
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:43,410
It appears he will entrust the palace to Father.

353
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,110
He must view our family as the only ones he can trust in an emergency.

354
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,600
Nonsense.

355
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,010
His Majesty has His Excellency Ha Ryun by his side.

356
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:54,580
He definitely has a different reason for this.

357
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:59,140
How could he decide this without telling me?

358
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,180
Are you upset?

359
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,700
Is he not going to battle where people may live or die?

360
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:33,290
Summon the Chief Court Lady.

361
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,280
My Lady.

362
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,050
[Kwon Seon, Yi Bang Won's concubine]

363
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:47,190
My Lady.

364
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:54,210
Favored Court Lady said your music interferes with her prenatal care and asked...

365
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:00,010
She asked that you refrain from playing.

366
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,710
What?

367
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,830
<i>Princess Jeongeui is here.</i>

368
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,140
<i>Writing?</i>

369
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,160
The sound of my geomungo is interfering with your prenatal care?

370
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,460
What do you mean by that?

371
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,900
It is noisy.

372
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:51,230
Perhaps it is because I do not understand music,

373
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:53,860
but it is noisy. Very noisy.

374
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:58,230
You do not have the ear to even appreciate such music?

375
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:04,730
I guess you must have solely used your body to seduce His Majesty.

376
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:09,260
I was born into a lowly status,

377
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:13,840
so I merely did not have the opportunity.

378
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:21,300
However, I know what makes His Majesty happy in bed.

379
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:25,710
It means that I am fulfilling my responsibilities as a concubine

380
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:28,490
to the best of my ability.

381
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,900
Please have His Majesty come to the Queen's palace.

382
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:40,300
Are you saying I should set up a royal consummation?

383
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,570
That is correct.

384
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:44,360
B-But the Chief of the Royal Astronomical Bureau...

385
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,920
Basically, tonight is not a date I received from him.

386
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,420
Then, can you not set it up right now?

387
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,950
This is a royal consummation between the king and queen of a nation.

388
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,150
The procedure and preparation-

389
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:56,040
The procedure and preparation do not need to be complicated.

390
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,850
A wife is seeking her husband, who is heading out to battle.

391
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:04,970
Even if so, the Queen never requests a royal consummation first.

392
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:09,940
I want to be with His Majesty.

393
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:12,590
Is there a better reason than that?

394
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:19,370
If you really cannot, I will go to His chambers instead.

395
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,220
No, Your Majesty.

396
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:26,210
I understand.

397
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:29,120
Tonight?

398
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,270
Yes. Though it was set up in a hurry,

399
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:36,850
tonight was considered to be the best night to produce a baby prince.

400
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:41,560
I understand.

401
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,800
Why did you do that?

402
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,870
Princess Jeongui called the Chief Court Lady and scolded her,

403
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:57,330
and that was reported to His Majesty.

404
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:58,860
To His Majesty?

405
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,200
Yes.

406
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:05,550
For now, I hear that he will build her a pavilion near the small pond

407
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:10,310
where Princess Jeongui can play the geomungo in peace.

408
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:13,820
He is letting you off lightly because you are pregnant.

409
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:18,840
But why is His Majesty doing all that for Princess Jeongui?

410
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,980
She is the daughter of a powerful family.

411
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:24,160
Even if he is a king, he cannot ignore that fact.

412
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:28,720
Since they have money, power, and organization.

413
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,370
But I am pregnant with his child.

414
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:33,810
Are you the only one who can get pregnant?

415
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:38,210
Do you think His Majesty's affection will only stay with you?

416
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:44,730
The palace is where young, new, and beautiful women are constantly supplied.

417
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:49,510
Then,

418
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:54,970
I also need a powerful minister who can become my ally.

419
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:58,420
Is that not so?

420
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,960
Oh, no need, no need.

421
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,490
Lift your glass.

422
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:17,860
How well do you think you know His Majesty?

423
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,880
I think I know him pretty well.

424
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,920
Pretty well, you say.

425
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:34,830
From what I can tell, you do not know him at all.

426
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:37,210
What do you mean?

427
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:42,150
His Majesty will not place you at the forefront this time.

428
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,320
Then what?

429
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:52,140
Did the Queen exert her influence again?

430
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:59,610
This is why I say you do not know His Majesty.

431
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:04,980
Is His Majesty someone who would be swayed by someone's words?

432
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,660
Then?

433
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:10,760
He judges and decides on his own.

434
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:15,000
But is it not true that Her Majesty's opinions

435
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,620
played into many of His Majesty's past decisions?

436
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:26,130
They were longtime political partners.

437
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:29,540
Even when he takes in all those women and fights with her all the time?

438
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:32,520
Even when he takes in all those women and fights with her all the time,

439
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:36,780
they have always shared the same political goals.

440
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:40,460
Even if their political goals are the same,

441
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:43,120
one is a king, and the other is a subject.

442
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:46,450
And one is a man,

443
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,200
and the other is a woman.

444
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:58,410
So?

445
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:06,510
I am saying this is the easiest relationship to change.

446
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:17,130
Then,

447
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:19,640
what can you do about it?

448
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,930
I will break their alliance.

449
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,710
I will make sure to do so.

450
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:35,340
If I pull this off, what will you do for me?

451
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,840
His Majesty is here.

452
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,380
I hear you are heading out to battle.

453
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,790
That is correct.

454
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,540
Why are you here?

455
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:46,590
You should just close your eyes and ears for tonight, okay?

456
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,550
W-W-What?

457
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:52,230
- Hey, Court Lady!
- H-H-Hey!

458
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,810
Quiet, quiet.

459
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:36,320
How about you go by yourself to bring Father?

460
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:41,900
He will be with his army.

461
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:45,280
How can you say I should go by myself to bring him?

462
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:50,960
Father is by himself at Wonjung Port.

463
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,740
Secretly, with only his closest elite guards with him.

464
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,980
Is that true?

465
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,040
It is true.

466
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:08,080
Is it your informant again?

467
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:12,530
It is all for Your Majesty.

468
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,790
But...

469
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:25,620
will Father readily agree to come with me?

470
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:29,380
You know how he left Gaegyeong.

471
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:32,220
Now is different from back then.

472
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,320
Jo Sa Eui's army is already afraid

473
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:37,180
after hearing that the royal army totals 40,000,

474
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:40,850
and Father will also not want any more of his men

475
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:43,410
to get hurt in a battle he cannot win.

476
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:49,540
Perhaps Father may only need justification for changing his mind.

477
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,300
That I came for him by risking my life.

478
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,880
I should give him that justification?

479
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,970
It will not be an easy task.

480
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:03,860
It will be dangerous.

481
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:10,260
However, that may perhaps be the only way.

482
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:27,300
<i>You must not step in until you realize the King's life is in danger.</i>

483
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,200
<i>Do you understand?</i>

484
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:34,640
<i>If the King does not bring Taesangwang by 45 minutes after the Hour of the Rabbit,</i>

485
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,830
<i>you must go to the temple and save the King.</i>

486
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:05,700
<i>The distance from there to where Father is will be about two hours distance.</i>

487
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:06,740
<i>There are ten elite guards protecting Taesangwang.</i>

488
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:09,610
In groups of five, they rotate their shifts

489
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:13,040
twice at 45 minutes past the Hour of Rooster and the Hour of Rabbit.

490
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:19,860
<i>Then, I should meet Father between the Hour of Rabbit and 45 minutes past.</i>

491
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:28,380
How is your health, Father?

492
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:37,290
Have you come all the way here to capture me?

493
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:38,950
No.

494
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:42,080
I came to bring you back.

495
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:47,360
You led an army

496
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:51,250
to escort your father home?

497
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:53,190
I came by myself.

498
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:57,960
Are you telling me to believe that you, the King, came alone?

499
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,430
Please believe me, Father.

500
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:13,180
Go back.

501
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:15,960
- Father.
- Go back!

502
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:19,090
This is a battle you cannot win.

503
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:23,790
Why are you turning a blind eye to the fact that soldiers will die unnecessarily?

504
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:32,080
I will move the capital back to Hanyang.

505
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:34,440
How dare you!

506
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,730
I will cut ties with those who seek vested interests from Jeonju.

507
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:40,630
What you tried to do, Father,

508
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:42,720
I will do it.

509
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:09,980
<i>You have to get moving before it becomes 45 minutes past.</i>

510
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:13,770
<i>The rotating elite guards are not men you can handle.</i>

511
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:15,530
Please make up your mind.

512
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:17,590
Go back.

513
00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:21,630
If you do not go back, I will kill you!

514
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:23,790
You have already killed me

515
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:27,750
several times over, Father.

516
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:32,610
Grab him!

517
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:35,030
Do not move. I am the King of Joseon.

518
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:36,760
He is not the King.

519
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:40,060
He is a rebel claiming to be a king!

520
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:43,900
Father!

521
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:51,110
Kill him.

522
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:54,470
If you kill me,

523
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:58,150
Joseon will die.

524
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:02,390
If you kill me, the court will fall into chaos,

525
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:04,870
and your name will be recorded in history

526
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:08,260
as a greedy schemer, blinded by greed for power,

527
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:10,270
replaced the royal family.

528
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:12,320
How dare you!

529
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,810
If you kill me,

530
00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:17,060
Sam Bong's death,
[Sam Bong: Jeong Do Jeon]

531
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:19,140
Po Eun's death,
[Po Eun: Jeong Mong Joo]

532
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:21,820
and Bang Beon and Bang Seok's deaths...
[Yi Bang Beon, Yi Bang Seok, Yi Bang Won's half-brothers]

533
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:25,710
All of that will have been in vain!

534
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:30,220
What are you all doing? Hurry up and kill him!

535
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:42,180
Did you not say you came alone?

536
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:44,000
Give me your bow.

537
00:47:55,630 --> 00:47:57,280
No.

538
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,750
Do not come near! Stop!

539
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:03,660
- Your Majesty!
- I said, stop!

540
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:19,450
I regret killing my younger brothers.

541
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:22,680
I deeply...

542
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:26,980
regret it.

543
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,610
I have done wrong.

544
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:36,190
I am deeply sorry.

545
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:48,220
Why did you kill them?

546
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:55,220
I asked you why you killed them.

547
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:03,420
I wanted to create the Joseon that I dreamed of.

548
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:08,810
I will become a king solely for the people.

549
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:12,010
I will repay to the people

550
00:49:12,010 --> 00:49:15,160
the blood that I have shed, Father.

551
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:19,300
Even if no one understands, you would understand, Father!

552
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:21,820
What kind of heart that is!

553
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:50,750
Hanyang is the land where Taesangwang started afresh.

554
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:52,560
However, in the Year of the Yellow Rabbit,

555
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:55,760
we abruptly moved to Gaegyeong after Jo Bak petitioned the Sangwang,

556
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,440
and we have not been able to return.

557
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:02,550
To revive the founding spirit of Joseon,

558
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:06,940
we will move the capital to Hanyang and establish a new Joseon.

559
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:10,790
You should not do this.

560
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:13,580
Gaegyeong, with its proximity to Byeokrando,
[Byeokrando: An international trading port for foreign envoys and merchants]

561
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:16,640
serves as a convenient commercial hub for trade.

562
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,070
Hanyang is located along the Han River.

563
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:22,980
It is in no way inferior to Gaegyeong in terms of commercial transport.

564
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:24,750
If the capital is moved to Hanyang,

565
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:27,900
we will have to mobilize the people to construct roads again.

566
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:31,230
Hanyang has even roads connecting all directions

567
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:33,540
and both boats and carts can pass through with ease.

568
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:36,390
There will be no unnecessary burden on the people.

569
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:40,870
However, Gaeseong served as the capital for 500 years, so it is fully equipped-

570
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:44,520
Fully equipped may be the case for you powerful ministers!

571
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,160
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

572
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:49,500
- Your Majesty!
- <i>Your Majesty!</i>

573
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:57,960
When Sangwang moved the capital back to Gaegyeong,

574
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:01,720
who bought land and houses here?

575
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:05,990
It was the powerful ministers who had a lot of wealth and early information.

576
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:09,110
They illegally bought land and houses here

577
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:11,880
and drained the blood of the people.

578
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:16,700
If anyone ever opposes me in this matter again,

579
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:19,410
I will investigate and confiscate their wealth,

580
00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:22,270
and punish them according to the law.

581
00:52:38,010 --> 00:52:40,300
Your Majesty, you are doing well.

Just a little more. Please push just a little more!

583
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:46,900
Your Majesty, Your Majesty. Please push one more time!

584
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:48,560
Your Majesty.

585
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,800
Push a little more!

586
00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:11,270
The Queen gave birth to a healthy prince.

588
00:53:15,010 --> 00:53:18,980
<i>Congratulations, Your Majesty.</i>

589
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:21,630
I will notify the royalty and nation of this fact

590
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:24,420
and bestow a great feast to celebrate.

594
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:53,930
you will get to live in it.

595
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,820
Take Prince Hamryeong outside for a bit.

596
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:13,540
Both of you also.

597
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:26,460
There is someone who wants to see you today.

598
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,710

00:55:04,830 --> 00:55:06,570
Finally,

602
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:10,150
I am able to set foot here again.

603
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:13,510
Congratulations.

604
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:20,980
I am not sure if I will be able to cut off the powerful men of Gaegyeong here.

605
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:23,500
You will succeed.

606
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:27,390
Great sacrifices will need to be made.

607
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:31,070
Avoiding it will do us no good.

608
00:55:40,730 --> 00:55:43,020

About the powerful families.

610
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:56,770
Cutting them off was impossible while at Gaegyeong.

611
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,360
That is why

612
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:05,550
I founded the nation and established its capital in Hanyang.

613
00:56:09,350 --> 00:56:12,190
Did you say you will go to Hanyang?

614
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:18,330
- Yes.
- Did you say you will cut off all vested interests

615
00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:21,850
and start anew there?

616
00:56:21,850 --> 00:56:23,970
Yes, Father.

617
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:32,030
Then, you may have to start with the Queen

618
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:35,380
and her family members.

619
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:37,610
Can you do that?

620
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:42,600
I asked if you can do it.

621
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:47,600
Yes, Father.

622
00:56:50,190 --> 00:56:51,940
