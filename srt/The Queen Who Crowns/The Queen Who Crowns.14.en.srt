[This drama is a fictional story based on historical figures and events and may differ from actual historical records.]

00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,860
[Filming of animals or child actors followed production guidelines.]

5
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:36,730
Go, go!

00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:40,200
[15 years later]

7
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,430
<i>Flip him over, flip him over!</i>

8
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:45,110
<i>Hey, flip him! Flip!</i>

9
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:47,860
<i>Flip him! Go, go! Go!</i>

10
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,880
- You did well.
<i>- One more time!</i>

11
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,440
<i>One more time, one more time!</i>

12
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,520
Could I ask for another round?

13
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,140
Fine.

14
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,750
This time, actually use some strength.

15
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,670
Yes.

16
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,570
All right, let us start!

17
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,420
<i>Spin around!</i>

18
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,950
<i>The leg!</i>

19
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,160
<i>Spin around!</i>

20
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:20,790
<i>Flip him! Do it!</i>

21
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,050
He let him win on purpose, right?

22
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:29,900
He is not someone who would let anyone win.

23
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,250
He is running low on strength.

24
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,990
You are quite as strong as I had thought.

25
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,410
Shall we do one more round?

26
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:42,830
Yes.

27
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,120
<i>All right! Go, go!</i>

28
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,000
<i>Flip him, flip him!</i>

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,520
<i>Flip him!</i>

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,660
[The Queen Who Crowns: Fateful Encounter at Dano]

31
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,730
How many times did I tell you that you can no longer win with your strength?

32
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,410
Why would you wrestle someone so big?

33
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,760
How long has it been since we were alone like this?

34
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,830
The sunlight is so nice.

35
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,200
My father says he will provide some grain.

36
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,140
- Dear Wife!
- Because His Majesty

37
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,120
has frozen all available assets,

38
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,770
we were unable to give even half a bushel of barley to soldiers during the last Lunar New Year.

39
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:58,270
We cannot just skip over this Dano.

40
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,100
Let us do only what we can afford.

41
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,750
My soldiers are loyal to me.

42
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:07,040
Spoken allegiance has no power.

43
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,020
How long would an allegiance without compensation last?

44
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,640
Come on, give me some more.

45
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,210
Next person.

46
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,980
- Here.
- Please!

47
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,490
Give it to me again.

48
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,550
All right, hold this again.

49
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,210
Happy now?

50
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,080
Come over here.

51
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,810
You are so stingy.

52
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,020
Yes, next.

53
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,920
Chae Ryeong is quite good.

54
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:50,240
But I am worried the grain may run out.

55
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,000
Since there are so many soldiers.

56
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:04,140
Please thank Father-in-law for me.

57
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,800
Geez!

58
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,500
Must I be careful around Brother-in-law even when I am helping him?

59
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,950
How many times have I told you he has a strong ego?

60
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:23,090
Do you think I do not?

61
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,670
Is that not His Excellency Ha Ryun?

62
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,330
These are Surichwi rice cakes.

63
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,590
Please try some.

64
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,480
So?

65
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,160
You should gather more soldiers in secret

66
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,280
and make full preparations.

67
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,370
Are there any movements?

68
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:01,940
Jeong Do Jeon is constantly visiting the Queen's palace.

69
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,250
Something seems off about this.

70
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,180
I do not know what they are plotting.

71
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:12,220
By chance, do you know anyone who can help us in the palace?

72
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,650
We need to know what they are plotting to prepare for it.

73
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,560
Yeong Sil.

74
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:26,120
A girl named Yeong Sil is a palace maid in the Queen's palace.

75
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:34,720
There is nothing I cannot do for you, Sir.

76
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,140
When Jeong Do Jeon comes to the Queen's palace,

77
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,140
just find out what they are talking about.

78
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,660
Yes, I will do so.

79
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,850
Here.

80
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:11,260
Do you not regret marrying me?

81
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,790
What are you saying?

82
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,430
If you had married Yeongyeongun, Wang Ik-

83
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,350
Dear Husband.

84
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,660
I hear he crossed over to Ming and gained massive wealth

85
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,160
by sticking to the imperial family there.

86
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:27,840
Even so, he is just a man from a fallen dynasty.

87
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,170
If you had married him,

88
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,910
Goryeo would not have fallen.

89
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:38,570
What do you mean by that?

90
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:42,970
Everyone says I am the greatest contributor to the founding of Joseon,

91
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:47,540
but you are the one who made me who I am.

92
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,250
Even while going around wielding my sword

93
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:58,720
like a madman after killing Jeong Mong Ju, I was thinking of you.

94
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,520
I thought about what I could achieve together with you.

95
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,130
But now,

96
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:10,560
I am just anxiously wondering when my death will come.

97
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,090
I have become so pitiful and pathetic.

98
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:23,270
This is such a good season to just let it pass by.

99
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:28,490
Should we go out somewhere close and get some fresh air for a few days?

100
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:18,030
This book is a collection of the conversation between Mencius and King Xuan of Qi.

101
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:25,080
Why "The Dialogues with King Xuan"?

102
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:30,700
I brought it to remind you not to forget what we dreamed of together.

103
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,830
What king will you become?

104
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,940
A book about the way of the king.

105
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:43,150
But this book is forbidden literature for me.

106
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:47,650
How can you say that when no one is here to scrutinize you?

107
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:12,020
I will go nearby and get some snacks for us.

108
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,670
All right.

109
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,340
Go to the granary and bring us some snacks.

110
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,780
Yes.

111
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,120
Madam.

112
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,840
Are you not Palace Maid Seo of the King's palace?

113
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,830
Pardon? Maid?

114
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,030
Maid of the palace?

115
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,920
She is really a palace maid?

116
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,070
If a palace maid gives birth here...

117
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,180
Aigoo, that would be big trouble. No, no.

118
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,900
Leave this temple immediately!

119
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:14,110
Bodhisattva, please, I beg you.

120
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,200
I prayed and prayed to Buddha

121
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,970
to please save me and my baby.

122
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,910
- So, please, I beg you...
- Aigoo, then the father is...

123
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,620
Aigoo! I will get kicked out as well like this!

124
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,120
Hurry up and leave! Leave!

125
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,840
Hurry up and leave! Hurry!

126
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,240
Look!

127
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,180
She is someone I know as well.

128
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,920
Even still,

129
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,680
if word of this gets out...

130
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:40,180
If you keep quiet about this, nobody will know.

131
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,340
That is true,

132
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,130
but what if the chief monk finds out?

133
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:47,210
I will make a separate special donation to the chief monk.

134
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:50,530
Oh, yes. If you will do so.

135
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,140
Thank you.

136
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:04,460
I will not ask you what happened.

137
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:08,610
Give birth to a healthy child.

138
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:13,330
Madam, thank you.

139
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,630
Please take good care of her.

140
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,590
Is this not also the will of Buddha?

141
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,520
Yes, Madam.

142
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:53,690
His Excellency Ha Ryun said I should gather more troops

143
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:57,080
and train them in secret.

144
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:01,930
It so happens the King will likely appoint Jeong Do Jeon

145
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,300
as the Chief Commander of the Three Armies.

146
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,720
They mean to put all the private soldiers in their hands.

147
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,510
If they raise an army after doing so,

148
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:13,380
we will be helpless against them.

149
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:17,820
Thus, I would like to sell our house.

150
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,910
<i>- Noonim!</i>
- Dear Wife!

151
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,950
We need funds to manage our soldiers.

152
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,310
Noonim.

153
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,710
Technically, that house is not yours.

154
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:27,930
It is Father's!

155
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:30,130
Do not get involved in this.

156
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,110
You cannot sell that house.

157
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:36,540
Were you not going to give me that house anyway?

158
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,540
My apologies.

159
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,310
That will not happen.

160
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:43,120
Prince Jeongan, please promise me

161
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,100
that you will not sell that house.

162
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,390
Yes, Father-in-law.

163
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:50,870
If so, I will raise some funds from my possessions.

164
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,790
I am ashamed.

165
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:57,910
Father, from Gaegyeong to now,

166
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,270
we sold too many houses because of Brother-in-law!

167
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,190
That is-

168
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,960
I will make sure to pay you back.

169
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,010
You know me.

170
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,770
We already dipped our feet in.

171
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:15,680
Your Brother-in-law's future is our family's future.

172
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:29,990
My younger brothers upset you, did they not?

173
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:35,560
They were sidelined from important positions in the court, so they are feeling-

174
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,300
I can understand those things.

175
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:45,240
But how could you say that you will sell the house without even consulting me?

176
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,340
Even if Father-in-law bought the house for us-

177
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:51,520
If I consulted with you, would you have said yes?

178
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,930
Would you not have said no?

179
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,130
Saying, "Let us trust my soldiers."

180
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,750
"They are loyal to me."

181
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,150
I must have seemed so insignificant in your eyes.

182
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:12,200
- Pardon?
- The biggest contributor in building Joseon

183
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,950
is living so pitifully.

184
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:19,470
Living in fear, wondering if the Queen will come for my life, scheming with Jeong Do Jeon.

185
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:20,860
Thus, without your family's help-

186
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,340
Why do you talk as if we are strangers again?

187
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,660
I am sorry.

188
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:45,720
I know you are under pressure and going through a hard time for multiple reasons.

189
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,480
- However-
- Just promise me one thing.

190
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:54,550
That you will consult with me on everything, even the smallest thing.

191
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:59,790
Yes. I will do so.

192
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,070
Please head inside first.

193
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:28,110
Did you give birth to the child?

194
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:30,120
All thanks to your care and support.

195
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,610
The temple agreed to raise the baby for me, so I returned to the palace.

196
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,740
That is great news.

197
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:40,370
But what are you doing here so late at night?

198
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:47,810
Palace Maid Yeong Sil was dragged away to the Queen's palace.

199
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:51,020
I felt it may have something to do with your family.

200
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,590
What did you say?

201
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,760
Your Majesty!

202
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,370
This girl was instigated by Prince Jeongan to spy on me.

203
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,810
Did you not give this to her?

204
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,760
I did give her that,

205
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,170
but I never told her to spy on you.

206
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,490
You impudent girl.

207
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,630
She already confessed to it.

208
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,660
Probably because she could not endure the beating.

209
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,780
What did you say?

210
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,730
If she had said so,

211
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:57,380
she probably gave a false confession to stop the beating.

212
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:03,840
What are you so afraid of that you are doing this, Your Majesty?

213
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,740
Do you truly...

214
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,600
want to die?

215
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:13,220
Let me ask you one thing before I die at your hands, Your Majesty.

216
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:17,180
Father hates Prince Jeongan despite him being his offspring.

217
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:21,440
Thus, he wants to take away all the power that Prince Jeongan has.

218
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,660
I thought about when he started being like that.

219
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,790
"Kill Jeong Mong Ju."

220
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,450
Kill Jeong Mong Ju.

221
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,310
With your own hands.

222
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:50,320
Then, I will support you in becoming king after your father.

223
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,200
[Queen Shindeok: Yi Seong Gye's second wife, Yi Bang Won (Tae Jong)'s stepmother]

224
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,870
I am thinking of telling this fact to Father.

225
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:03,210
- You wretch!
- "Her Majesty instigated Jeong Mong Ju's death."

226
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:07,250
"So, please stop hating Prince Jeongan."

227
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,560
What will you do about it?

228
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,160
You came.

229
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,340
Madam.

230
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:41,900
I did not say anything to Her Majesty.

231
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,970
It is the truth.

232
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:48,210
All right. I got it.

233
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,970
Let us go inside.

234
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,820
Dear Wife!

235
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,850
Dear Wife, what happened?

236
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,350
Sir...

237
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:08,060
Chae Ryeong, take her inside.

238
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,480
Yes.

239
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:23,670
So, you told her the Queen instigated the killing of Jeong Mong Ju

240
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:27,700
and Prince Jeongan carried it out?

241
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,310
- Yes.
- Dear Wife!

242
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:33,470
Do you think people do not say that because they do not know?

243
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,130
There is a reason why they do not!

244
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:37,850
The moment you speak such words,

245
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:40,320
either the Queen or the one who speaks it...

246
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,090
one of the two must die.

247
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:48,380
The Queen will not just let you be.

248
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:51,030
She will do whatever is at her disposal to shut you up.

249
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,470
What if she sends an assassin after you-

250
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,410
There was no other way

251
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:58,070
to get Yeong Sil out of the palace.

252
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,060
There was no other way

253
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:03,250
to save you, Dear Husband.

254
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,070
What would be the point of gaining the world

255
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:25,470
if I were to lose you?

256
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,170
I will resolve this matter somehow.

257
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:36,870
So, promise me that you will not act so recklessly

258
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:38,850
on your own like this.

259
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,630
Yes.

260
00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:01,550
Your Majesty's daughter-in-law was discourteous to you.

261
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,690
Please forgive her.

262
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,040
She hates her mother-in-law.

263
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,870
Of course, she would speak so carelessly to me.

264
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,600
- Your Majesty...
- Go back.

265
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:19,030
I will not leave until you say you forgive her.

266
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:22,280
You would save your wife at all costs?

267
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:26,430
There is a way to save her, I suppose.

268
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:30,430
Shall I tell you?

269
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:33,660
Crown Prince, come here.

270
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:43,150
I know you believe your position as the Crown Prince

271
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:45,400
was stolen by my son, Bang Seok.

272
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,640
No.

273
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,990
No?

274
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:50,230
Then,

275
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:53,590
will you pledge your allegiance to the Crown Prince?

276
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:04,630
I, Prince Jeongan, Lee Bang Won

277
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:09,740
pledge allegiance to the Crown Prince.

278
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:20,390
It is said that words carry the least amount of weight.

279
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:22,310
You should do a bow of allegiance.

280
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,860
Your Majesty!

281
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,910
Why? You cannot do it?

282
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:35,020
Promise me that you will not harm my wife.

283
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:23,430
Did something happen? You do not look very good.

284
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:25,870
It is nothing.

285
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:30,640
But why did you suddenly call for me so urgently?

286
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:37,280
His Majesty says he will confiscate all weapons from each Jeoljesa.
[Jeoljesa: A commander of the provincial garrison troops]

287
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,300
What?

288
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:42,620
The private soldiers had already established deep trust with Jeoljesa.

289
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:45,900
So, even if you control them, there are limits.

290
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,820
However, if their weapons are confiscated,

291
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:52,390
they will be rendered powerless.

292
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,950
In the end, he intends to take everything from me

293
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:01,100
and make me wither away slowly.

294
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,920
What if we refuse to hand over the weapons?

295
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,630
There is not much you can do if it is the King's order.

296
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:09,530
What if we do not hand over the weapons?

297
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:12,640
He will probably come with an army for your life

298
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,380
saying you disobeyed the king's orders.

299
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:17,740
In the end, he is asking me to die!

300
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,550
Prince Jeongan...

301
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,820
They are both not here.

302
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,370
Sir!

303
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,270
Brother-in-law, did you put this house up for sale?

304
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,390
What are you saying?

305
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:48,240
I hear a buyer has come forward.

306
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,870
How could you pretend not to know?

307
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:53,380
He does not know anything about this.

308
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,570
I did it.

309
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:58,020
I promised Father-in-law that I would not sell it!

310
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,760
Father gave me the permission to do so.

311
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,900
I was supposed to inherit this house anyway.

312
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,570
It is none of your business.

313
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:06,210
Dear Wife!

314
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,180
You must be tired. Please head inside first and rest.

315
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,550
Dear Wife.

316
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:16,850
I need to discuss something with my brothers.

317
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:19,050
Yeong Sil.

318
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,770
Sir.

319
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:36,570
You are ruining our family!

320
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,500
- What?
- You are depleting our wealth

321
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,370
and blocking our path forward!

322
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:42,880
Considering how things are going in the world,

323
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,610
this marriage should never have taken place.

324
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,800
You should just divorce him!

325
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:51,250
<i>So, we can pull out while we can.</i>

326
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,940
<i>Brother-in-law is a swamp!</i>

327
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,380
<i>- Someone like you, Noonim,</i>
- Sir.

328
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:57,870
<i>can still find another man to marry!</i>

329
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:01,410
Noonim!

330
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,820
If you ever insult Prince Jeongan again,

331
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:09,310
I will cut ties with you both.

332
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,630
Hyungnim!

333
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:43,540
Do not be too shocked by what I am about to say.

334
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:48,860
Let us end our relationship here.

335
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:53,800
Did you hear what my brothers said?

336
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,240
I heard, but that is not the reason why.

337
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,880
Then why?

338
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,280
I know you better than anyone else.

339
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:06,890
You are someone who could even die for me.

340
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:09,300
That makes me afraid...

341
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:12,990
that my love may end up killing you.

342
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:14,190
Dear Husband.

343
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:19,320
It appears the Queen and Sam Bong swayed Father's heart.

344
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:24,390
Not only will he take all the private soldiers, he will also confiscate all the weapons.

345
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:27,110
I just cannot accept this.

346
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:29,680
I will resist to the end and die.

347
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,490
But if I die like that,

348
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:35,220
you, your family,

349
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,390
and our children will all die.

350
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:41,430
Thus, if we end our relationship here-

351
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:43,990
You are so selfish.

352
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:48,460
How could you think about dying alone and leaving behind your family?

353
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,730
Dear Wife.

354
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:54,010
If they ask you to hand over your weapons, do so.

355
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:55,880
What do you mean?

356
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:52,210
Come this way.

357
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,200
What is all this?

358
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:16,130
I heard that all the soldiers and weapons of the princes would be confiscated.

359
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,260
Then, these are...

360
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,790
Military weapons prepared in secret.

361
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:27,470

in secret for me.

364
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:37,340
Thank you."

365
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,940
Should I be thanking you?

366
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,340
Dear Husband.

367
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:44,790
I always desire to walk in pace with you,

368
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:50,640
but you are always a couple steps ahead of me.

This is...

370
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:59,120
how I show my love for you.
