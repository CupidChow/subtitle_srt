Let me.

6
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,130
You should twist him around!

7
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,040
A little more!

8
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,100
Really, goodness.

9
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,640
He is amazing.

10
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,980
- One more time!
- Oh, one more time?

11
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,940
Gather your strength again and go!

12
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,010
No, you should stick your leg inside.

13
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:43,030
Try it while putting your leg inside!

14
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,400
- Wow!
- Is he a bull?

15
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,100
He is absolutely a bull.

16
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,370
He is so strong.

His waist!

19
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,050
Yeah, the waist!

20
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,570
The waist!

21
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,460
Take him down!

22
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,520
Yeah, go, go!

23
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:35,780
The hoe hook technique is when you hook the back part of their ankle.

24
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,800
You do not kick their shin relentlessly.

25
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,630
Sorry about that.

26
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:49,340
- My skills are just...
- Let us go grab a drink.

27
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,070
- Okay. Let us go.
- Wait...

28
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,620
Why do you wrestle when you do not even know why you are losing?

29
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,900
Are you not hurt anywhere?

30
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,230
Are you all right?

31
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:14,670
Well, this level of bruising is nothing to worry about.

32
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:20,970
If I upset you, I am sorry.

33
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,980
Wait.

34
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,170
I am asking just in case,

35
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,790
but do you know my name?

36
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,320
Are you not Scholar Yi Bang Won?

37
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,280
That is right. I am Yi Bang Won.

38
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,510
Wait, where are you going?

39
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,830
Look!

40
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,790
Master is coming.

41
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,620
All right, let us go inside.

King Xuan of Qi asked, "Is it true that Tang banished Jie

43
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,850

He is the one who got first place

48
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,550
over you in the recent first round of the state exam, right?

49
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:17,210
If you had just written that one line of poetry properly,

50
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:20,340
you would have gotten first place.

"Those who harm humanity and righteousness are nothing more than bandits."

52
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,310
Look.

53
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,470
Why are you so unable to focus today?

54
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,850
What are you doing?

55
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,300
Keep going.

"One who despoils humaneness is called a thief."

58
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,530
"Someone who is a robber and a thief is called a mere fellow."

"I have heard of the punishment of the fellow Zhou but never of the slaying of a ruler."

60
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,510
All right, well done.

61
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,940
Were you not too hard on that scholar earlier?

62
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,840
Who? The scholar I hit with my fan?

63
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,420
No, not him.

64

"Why do you wrestle when you do not even know why you are losing?"

65
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,260
His countenance changed.

66
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,890
I guess it hurt his pride quite a bit.

67
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:10,910
Whenever I see him,

68
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,120
he always seems so tense.

69
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,880
He is so uptight

70
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,180
as if it would be the end of the world if he failed the state exam.

71
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,210
I hear General Yi Seong Gye is his father

72
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:25,280
and his wish is for someone from his family to pass the humanities state exam.

73
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,420
Oh, really?

74
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,530
But when that man walks,

75
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:34,340
he walks like this. Kind of like this. It is so pitiful.

76
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,310
So you felt pity for him?

77
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,620
- Well, yeah, it happened naturally.
- Oh, really?

78
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,400
I, the Chancellor of Sungkyunkwan,

79
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,040
gathered you all to my home study hall

80
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,050
because less than a year remains until the final round of the state exam.

81
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:56,100
Do not get distracted by Dano, and devote yourself to studying.

82
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,430
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

83
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:01,370
Receive a government position, make your name known, and achieve greatness and honor.

84
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:06,120
That is the way for you to raise your family's honor.

85
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,380
Oh, he is here.

86
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,130
Is it not Wang Ik, the younger cousin of His Majesty?

87
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,580
I heard he returned from Bukwon with an imperial edict from the Emperor.

[Bukwon: A nation established by remnants of Yuan]
Sit, sit.

89
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:33,670
Studying the political dynamics of the neighboring countries surrounding Goryeo

90
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:37,120
is absolutely essential as we prepare for next year's state exam.

91
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,000
So, I invited him as a special guest.

92
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,330
I am Yeongyeongun, Wang Ik.

93
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:48,740
I am here because I could not say no to my future Father-in-law.

94
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:00,470
Thanks for the surichiwi* rice cakes.

Your mother likes them.

96
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:06,000
She even got me flower-embroidered socks to wear for my wedding.

97
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,660
- Mother.
- Please, I beg you.

98
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,990
I only have one daughter.

99
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:17,590
They are officials from the Tribute Marriage Bureau.

100
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:19,160
Tribute bride?

101
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,990
Please, you cannot.

102
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,770
S-She is running away! Catch her!

103
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:26,710
You cannot, you cannot!

104
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:29,700
Run away! Run away!

105
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,380
Get up!

106
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,880
No! You cannot!

107
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,380
Let go of her!

108
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,410
Get up.

109
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:55,360
Bukwon and Ming are vying for supremacy over Zhongyuan.

110
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,450
But Bukwon is requesting military support from Goryeo.

111
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,000
What shall we do?

112
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,600
We cannot send troops.

113
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,970
- Why not?
- Ming is a rising sun, while Bukwon is a setting sun.

114
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:09,650
Moreover, our people are already suffering from raids from Japanese pirates.

115
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:13,730
Our troops should focus on protecting our people right now.

116
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:18,880
Then, what will you tell Bukwon?

117
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,300
That the weather was too hot and too cold.

118
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,160
The grass for the horses all withered from the hot weather,

119
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,310
and the grass for the horses all froze from the cold weather.

120
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,010
Will they believe you?

121
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:35,800
That is why diplomatic skills are essential.

122
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,410
Especially from royal figures such as you, Yeongyeongun.

123
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,370
Father has reasons for wanting to impart special teachings

124
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:51,810
to us who passed the first round of the state exam.

125
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:55,780
Without a solid foundation, no matter how difficult an exam you pass,

126
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,840
you can never become an excellent official.

127
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,510
Hyungnim!

128
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:02,600
We are in big trouble! We are in big trouble!

129
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,800
Noonim is at the Tribute Marriage Bureau and...

130
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,840
What do you mean? The Tribute Marriage Bureau?

131
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,110
Wait, is that the government office that selects tribute brides?

132
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,710
Exactly.

133
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:14,160
So why is Noonim there?

134
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,520
No way...

135
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,180
I-I need to leave right away.

136
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,300
I will go with you.

137
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,230
Hyungnim! I cannot run anymore.

138
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,770
Take me with you!

139
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,840
Even if you are selecting tribute brides,

140
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,690
there is a time and procedure for it.

141
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:30,000
How could you take her away indiscriminately?

142
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,170
Goodness. You should just leave, Young Lady.

143
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,260
What is the problem?

144
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,000
I am saying this because my friend got taken away.

145
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,580
I need to speak to the head of this government office.

146
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,940
Should I explain it to you again?

147
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:43,350
Envoys from Bukwon came recently.

148
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,150
Bukwon is currently at war with Ming right now,

149
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:49,560
and they said Bukwon's troops needed women to take as wives.

150
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,190
Would you marry off your sister to a soldier at war?

151
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,350
Especially when the war does not involve Goryeo?

152
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,190
Gosh, you are really annoying me.

153
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:00,490
But you are not the one going, Young Lady!

154
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,330
Who is that Young Lady?

155
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:05,080
She is the daughter of the Chancellor of Sungkyunkwan, Min Je.

156
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,310
Oh, no wonder.

157
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,340
Noonim!

158
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,710
Please take the Young Lady home. She is driving me crazy!

159
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:15,040
She beat up four Tribute Marriage Bureau officials!

160
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,250
You will need to treat their wounds as well.

161
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,380
Yes, I understand.

162
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,650
Noonim! Let us go.

163
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,420
I will not go.

164
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,150
I cannot go!

165
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:30,290
Do you think we like doing this?

166
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:33,560
We have no choice because the orders come from our superiors!

167
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,790
He is right.

168
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:38,450
There is nothing these men can do.

169
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:44,590
What will change by nagging them?

170
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:47,230
I wanted to meet with the head of the Tribute Marriage Bureau.

171
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,100
What will you do if you meet him?

172
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,200
It was decided by the royal court. What will change?

173
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,360
Then, should I just watch and do nothing?

174
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,280
I am sure you are aware of how the world works,

175
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:04,490
but your actions seem like a tantrum from a daughter of a powerful family.

176
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,200
- What did you say?
- Goryeo is powerless,

177
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,370
and Goryeo's people are even more so.

178
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,230
That is why these things have happened.

179
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:15,000
Not because of the mistakes of a few individuals.

180
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,720
So?

181
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,790
It is not like you are being taken away as a tribute bride.

182
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:25,130
- Is that not right?
- Of course! What a relief that is.

183
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:28,310
I do not know about others, but I cannot let my noonim be taken.

184
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:30,280
It is right for you not to be taken, Noonim.

185
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,460
This is what I mean.

186
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:35,780
You sons of bitches!

187
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,590
Because people like you become officials and seek a good life

188
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,470
is why Goryeo has ended up like this!

189
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,940
You despicable bastards.

190
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,820
No, wait-

191
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:52,150
She looks furious.

192
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,770
Noonim!

193
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,130
<i>Why do you wrestle when you do not even know why you are losing?</i>

194
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,940
With her fan, bam!

195
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,600
I have never seen such a strong-headed woman like her.

196
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,880
It was satisfying and refreshing.

197
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,110
That is not all.

198
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,330
To stop her friend from being taken away,

199
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:26,040
she singlehandedly beat up four Tribute Marriage Bureau officials.

200
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,820
Gosh, just stay still.

201
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,720
Y-Yeong Sil.

202
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,540
Did you fall for her?

203
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,620
You have been talking about her constantly.

204
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,180
B-Be more gentle.

205
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,130
All right.

206
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,880
There is something I need to clear up.

207
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,280
Pardon?

208
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,660
I am not a son of a bitch.

209
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:26,630
So, I am not trying to become an official just to seek a good life.

210
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:29,680
Then, that is a relief.

211
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,130
I heard you are betrothed.

212
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,630
Yes.

213
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:40,080
How do you feel about him?

214
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,380
Why are you curious about that?

215
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:48,920
I feel like my heart keeps flowing toward you.

216
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:53,050
So, I am desperately building a dam to stop that flow.

217
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:55,440
I feel that if that dam breaks,

218
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,000
I will not be able to control myself.

219
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,770
So, if it is a feeling I need to cut off,

220
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:04,400
I must cut it off in advance. That is why.

221
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,820
Cut it off.

222
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,670
I am sorry.

223
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:25,150
Please, I beg you.

224
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:27,760
Please, I beg you...

225
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,180
Why are you not taking that girl?

226
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:34,150
Why are you only taking my daughter? Why!

227
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:39,210
Please give me one moment.

228
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:48,220
I am leaving now.

229
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,210
I am the one leaving,

230
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:56,620
so why are you crying?

231
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,110
I feel so bad.

232
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,710
For what?

233
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:06,200
I just feel bad for everything...

234
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:15,420
It is not like I am going to die.

235
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:36,460
It is okay, it is okay. Everything will be fine.

236
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,120
Everything will be fine.

237
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,020
When a household has a woman selected as a tribute bride,

238
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,530
the parents and relatives wail.

239
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:46,700
Their cries continue day and night.

240
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,720
On the day she leaves, some cry out

241
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,930
and even hang themselves in grief and anger.

242
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:59,500
As a woman, I have no way to inform the court of this.

243
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,240
However, you are the scholars of Sungkyunkwan.

244
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:09,800
Please sign your names to this petition and submit it to the Inspector of the State Council.

245
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:14,160
I will not partake in this.

246
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,860
I also will not partake in this.

247
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,490
I am sorry.

248
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,200
What about you?

249
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:33,820
I also do not think this is the way.

250
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,500
Mu Gu!

251
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:40,520
This may sound cold-hearted, but pay attention to what I say.

252
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:46,070
The sole purpose of those who gathered here is to rise to prominence and success.

253
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:50,290
So, why would they do something problematic even before the state exam?

254
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,970
You are all so cowardly.

255
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:56,650
Sometimes, it takes courage for people to become cowardly.

256
00:16:56,650 --> 00:17:00,840
My friend and I laughed and cried together

257
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,690
and shared everything.

258
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:06,230
My friend, who is like my own flesh, is being taken away as a tribute bride!

259
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,020
Yet, I hear, "It is not like you are the one going."

260
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,420
"I am glad it was not you."

261
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,880
Do not feel guilty.

262
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:22,150
It is not your fault that she was taken away alone.

263
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:26,200
I am glad that they did not take you.

264
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,600
- I mean it.
- How could you say that!

265
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:33,200
Even if you criticize me for being selfish, I cannot help it. This is how I honestly feel.

266
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,620
Though I can say more about my feelings for you,

267
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:41,130
it does not seem proper when you just lost your friend,

268
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:43,280
so I will stop here.

269
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,450
Look, Chancellor.

270
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:03,210
Is Yi Bang Won a Sungkyunkwan scholar studying under you?

271
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,590
Yes, that is correct.

272
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:07,830
A scholar who has not even been appointed as an official yet

273
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:10,790
dared to submit this to the Inspector!

274
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:21,130
This is a letter regarding the tribute brides.

275
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,770
I am glad I caught it in advance.

276
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:25,490
What if it ended up reaching the King?

277
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,970
Are you laughing?

278
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:32,180
Kick him out of the Sungkyunkwan.

279
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,320
Pardon?

280
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:38,780
Even without this, my head hurts from all the petitions disturbing the King's mood.

281
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:41,210
I intend to make an example out of him.

282
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:44,510
Why are you trying to silence the scholar?

283
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,790
I cannot do that.

284
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:49,800
Then, I will have you impeached.

285
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,690
Do as you wish.

286
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,290
Are you all ready?

287
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,930
<i>Yes.</i>

288
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,440
Let us go.

289
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,210
Noonim!

290
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,640
Why did you come here?

291
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,740
- What is the matter?
- We have a problem.

292
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:43,760
Are you really leaving Sungkyunkwan?

293
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:49,300
Supposedly, Master will be impeached if I do not leave.

294
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:54,630
Your father will be extremely disappointed.

295
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,310
Hyungnim, you have not left yet.

296
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:09,170
Stay outside for a moment.

297
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,730
I have something to say to him.

298
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,820
Yes.

299
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,570
I will see you later.

300
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,580
Why did you do that?

301
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:34,020
I personally wrote and submitted the petition,

302
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:37,030
so it will not cause you any harm.

303
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:39,930
Why did you do this alone?

304
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,570
Young Master.

305
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:47,540
At first, I was curious about this woman who did not hesitate when facing injustice.

306
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:52,250
Then, I wanted to protect her reckless determination for her friend.

307
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:01,790
I will find a way so you will not suffer negative consequences alone, Young Master.

308
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:06,730
What I mean is I will find a way to take responsibility with you.

309
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,810
There will not be such a way.

310
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:14,650
I am a scholar who studies to create a new world,

311
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:19,120
but I told you to ignore the unjust suffering of those taken away as tribute brides.

312
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,680
You taught me that.

313
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,360
That is why I did it.

314
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,950
So you do not need to take responsibility or worry about it.

315
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,850
Then, what will you do now?

316
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,590
What will I do?

317
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,900
The foolishness of fighting without even knowing the reason for losing

318
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,960
is probably not mine alone.

319
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,900
Perhaps our Goryeo is the same.

320
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,680
I will take time to think about this

321
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,530
as someone standing alone in the vast wilderness.

322
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:04,560
Please place this over there gently.

323
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:13,790
I wanted to personally decorate the house we will live in after we got married.

324
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:17,620
These are the finest items brought from Bukwon.

325
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,870
I will be going to Bukwon for a month or two.

326
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:24,780
After that, let us have a grand wedding.

327
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,870
I have been wanting to ask you.

328
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:32,280
Why are you suddenly going to Bukwon?

329
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,850
Well, about that...

330
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:39,910
Are you handling the task of offering the Goryo women as tribute?

331
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:43,850
I saw you at the Tribute Marriage Bureau, Yeongyeongun.

332
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,560
Must you do this job?

333
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,160
This is not for a woman to concern herself with.

334
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,470
My friend, who is like my own flesh, is being taken away as a tribute bride.

335
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:57,670
- Turn a blind eye to it.
- Sir.

336
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:02,040
I will receive much wealth from the King if I go and offer them as tribute.

337
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,290
My position in Goryeo will only expand and grow stronger,

338
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:11,710
and we will become happy as we enjoy more wealth and power.

339
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:25,560
<i>The foolishness of fighting without even knowing the reason for losing</i>

340
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,530
<i>is probably not mine alone.</i>

341
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:31,560
<i>Perhaps our Goryeo is the same.</i>

342
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,480
<i>I will take time to think about this.</i>

343
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,240
I will not have you stand alone in the wilderness.

344
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,910
I will stand together with you.

345
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:57,730
Then, the engagement must be broken first.

346
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:00,160
Your marriage with the royal family of Goryeo.

347
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,140
Are you sure you can do it?

348
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:06,450
- But, that-
- If you wish to stand together in the wilderness as "us,"

349
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:09,210
take care of that first.

350
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:34,680
I will not marry Yeongyeongun.

351
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,500
- Pardon?
- What do you mean by this?

352
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,580
I am sorry for not telling you sooner.

353
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,580
But I cannot do this.

354
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:47,040
Child, why are you acting like this?

355
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,720
Is this because your friend is leaving as a tribute bride?

356
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,560
If so, I will switch her out.

357
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,440
What will you do after you switch her with someone else?

358
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:01,720
How could you humiliate me like this?

359
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,460
I am sorry.

360
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,320
If you will unilaterally break this marriage,

361
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,220
I will not just sit idly by, either.

362
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,050
What do you want me to do?

363
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,620
How shall I take responsibility for this?

364
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:16,890
I will make sure your father and your younger brothers

365
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,890
can never set foot in the court.

366
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,580
If so, Father,

367
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,900
cast me out.

368
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:30,320
Cast me out of the Min family.

369
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,540
Noonim!

371

<i>By the time you read this letter, I will break off the engagement with Yeongyeongun.</i>

372
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,200
<i>Since this is breaking an engagement with the royal family,</i>

373
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,650
<i>I will definitely face negative consequences for it.</i>

374
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:26,630
<i>However, I will not run from it.</i>

375
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:29,250
<i>I want to meet with you, Young Master.</i>
