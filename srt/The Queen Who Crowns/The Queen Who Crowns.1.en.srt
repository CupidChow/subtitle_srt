["Long live the King"]

00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,570
<i>A thousand years! A thousand years!</i>

17
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,990
The foundation of royal transformation must always

18
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:22,900
begin with the righteousness of the household,

19
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:28,480
and the lineage of the royal family is tied to the noble dignity of the consort.

20
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,510
Thus, this proclamation is issued to commend and elevate Lady Min.

21
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,570
Lady Min, you possess

22
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:39,000
modest refinement and unparalleled beauty, demonstrating virtue and wisdom.

23
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,660
Since joining the royal household,

24
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,460
you have demonstrated the remarkable virtues of a devoted wife.

25
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:49,410
<i>Notably, you showed decisive judgment, personally dressing His Majesty in armor,</i>

26

<i>and aiding in establishing the royal order.</i>

27
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:59,390
The King's success in fulfilling his grand plans is greatly owed to your support.

28
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,610
<i>Since he is unable to forget his first wife,</i>

29
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:07,140
he honors her with a ceremonial position and grants her a significant role.

30
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:11,200

00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,510
Very good.

35
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,500
Nice.

36
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,460
Let's drink.

37
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,790
Please eat up.

38
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,970
Would you like to try it on?

39
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,760
No, Your Majesty.

40
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:24,970
I am fearful and honored to just be able to touch it.

41
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,960
Y-Your Majesty...

42
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,250
A-Are you not His Majesty, the King?

43
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,520
You are amazing!

44
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:27,110

<i>Let us go through everything together.</i>

<i>I am afraid.</i>

50
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,420
<i>Do not be afraid.</i>

51
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:26,520
<i>The history stands with us tonight.</i>

52

- Your Majesty!
- You will get hurt!

55
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,820
Gosh, goodness.

56
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,760
Your Majesty!

57
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,980
Your Majesty!

58
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,220
Your Majesty, Your Majesty!

59
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,210
Aigoo, what are we to do about them?

60
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,470
Your Majesty! Aigoo.

61
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,510
You should not be like this.

62
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,310
What are you all doing! Hurry!

63
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,800
Hurry up, hurry!

64
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,170
What do we do about this?

65
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:40,440
It is my fault for not letting you know in advance

66
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,360
of the king and queen's royal consummation.

67
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,890
Gosh, Court Lady.

68
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,430
What are we to do about this unfathomable situation?

69
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,650
- Let us go in.
- Yes.

70
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,740
They lived as a married couple for a long time at their private residence,

71
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,670
so they may think lightly of the court etiquette.

72
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:07,220
- I see.
- Everything must be done without fail

73
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,690
according to customs from now on.

74
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,160
Yes.

75
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,320
Do you have the large acupuncture needles in case of any mishaps during their act?

76
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,130
I have them here.

77
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:28,470
Court Lady Jeong! Court Lady Jeong! Court Lady Jeong!

78
00:08:54,193 --> 00:08:57,043
<i>The purpose of a royal consummation</i>

79
00:08:57,043 --> 00:09:00,223
solely lies in bearing an heir.

80
00:09:07,593 --> 00:09:09,493
<i>Under no circumstances,</i>

81
00:09:09,493 --> 00:09:17,103
Your Majesty the Queen should not be shamefully above His Majesty in the act.

82
00:09:23,071 --> 00:09:28,261
<i>Your Majesty must focus solely on His Majesty</i>

83
00:09:28,261 --> 00:09:32,101
and make him feel comfortable.

84
00:09:32,101 --> 00:09:38,781
Your Majesty, you must never enjoy it for your own pleasure!

85
00:09:57,892 --> 00:10:00,962
His Majesty has already partaken of wine.

86
00:10:00,962 --> 00:10:03,452
According to court etiquette,

87
00:10:03,452 --> 00:10:08,082
it is proper for you to quietly retire to your chamber for the night.

88
00:10:08,082 --> 00:10:09,912
Please...

89
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:12,409
<i>Go away!</i>

90
00:10:16,942 --> 00:10:19,602
<i>Your Majesty...</i>

91
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,500
Will you stay there all night?

92
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,610
<i>Your Majesty...</i>

93
00:11:16,415 --> 00:11:18,565

Won Beom!
[Yi Seong Gye, Taesangwang (Yi Bang Won's father)]

95
00:11:26,515 --> 00:11:29,005
Is it difficult to control your anger?

96
00:11:29,005 --> 00:11:30,115
[Won Beom, Yi Seong Gye's right-hand man]

97
00:11:30,155 --> 00:11:31,765
Shall we go to a nearby Buddhist sanctuary?

98
00:11:31,765 --> 00:11:34,705
When I sit in front of Buddha,

99
00:11:35,855 --> 00:11:38,785
I begin to resent Buddha.

100
00:11:38,785 --> 00:11:40,985
When I look at the sky,

101
00:11:42,085 --> 00:11:44,905
I begin to resent the sy.

102
00:11:45,715 --> 00:11:49,625
Thus, I have nowhere in this world

103
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,815
where I can reside.

104
00:11:57,725 --> 00:12:00,475
He is probably laughing.

105
00:12:02,345 --> 00:12:05,055
He will definitely be laughing.

106
00:12:06,055 --> 00:12:09,265
No matter what,

107
00:12:09,265 --> 00:12:11,965
I will make known to them

108
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:14,835
what they have done!

109
00:12:15,555 --> 00:12:19,725
I will make the royal throne

110
00:12:21,285 --> 00:12:25,055
hell for you!

111
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,025
We shall pray fervently to the heavens

112
00:12:50,025 --> 00:12:54,745
for your prosperous reign to be established.
[Yeoheung Buwongun Min Je, Father of Queen Won Gyeong]

113
00:12:54,745 --> 00:12:56,815
Thank you.

114
00:13:04,725 --> 00:13:06,025
[Ha Ryun, a meritorious subject of Lee Bang Won]

115
00:13:06,025 --> 00:13:09,085
You have got the whole world under your feet, Yeoheung Buwongun.

116
00:13:09,085 --> 00:13:11,665
What are you saying?

117
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:15,025
[Yeoseonggun Min Mu Jil / Yeoganggun Min Mu Gu, Younger brothers of Queen Won Gyeong]

118
00:13:17,545 --> 00:13:21,475
In private, they say the King and their Min family

119
00:13:21,475 --> 00:13:25,175
share joint rule.
[Anseonggun Yi Suk Beon, a meritorious subject of Lee Bang Won]

120
00:13:25,175 --> 00:13:28,785
During the Year of the Yellow Tiger*, did not the Queen secretly say
[The year of Prince's Rebellion]

121
00:13:28,785 --> 00:13:31,135
that she would prepare military weapons?

122
00:13:31,135 --> 00:13:33,865
I was terrified at the time.

123
00:13:33,865 --> 00:13:35,715
What would she do if she got caught?

124
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:38,855
The Queen should have been born as a man,

125
00:13:38,855 --> 00:13:41,285
seeing her boldness and abilities.

126
00:13:41,285 --> 00:13:43,975
If the Queen was born as a man,

127
00:13:43,975 --> 00:13:46,935
would she not have become the King?

128
00:13:58,795 --> 00:14:04,615
Your Majesty, you always just smile when we say something.

129
00:14:04,615 --> 00:14:10,715
Whenever you do that, I just cannot figure out what you are thinking.

130
00:14:12,725 --> 00:14:14,985
Yes, I understand.

131
00:14:14,985 --> 00:14:17,795
You have spent many years having to

132
00:14:17,795 --> 00:14:21,725
hide and be cautious in order to survive.

133
00:14:21,725 --> 00:14:23,435
However, Your Majesty,

134
00:14:23,435 --> 00:14:27,245
is not the whole world beneath your feet now?

135
00:14:27,315 --> 00:14:32,015
You can now speak freely and say what is on your mind.

136
00:14:33,645 --> 00:14:37,115
If I speak freely and say what is on my mind,

137
00:14:37,115 --> 00:14:40,115
will you be able to handle it, my brothers-in-law?

138
00:14:44,725 --> 00:14:46,905
What are you saying?

139
00:14:46,905 --> 00:14:50,525
Would we not recognize you, Your Majesty?

140
00:14:50,525 --> 00:14:52,245
That is enough.

141
00:14:52,245 --> 00:14:54,585
Even if this is a place of celebration,

142
00:14:54,585 --> 00:14:57,815
there are things you should and should not say.

143
00:14:57,815 --> 00:15:00,645
With the King present, how dare you say

144
00:15:00,645 --> 00:15:03,295
if the Queen had been born a man, she would have become King?

145
00:15:03,295 --> 00:15:06,225
That is not what I am saying!

146
00:15:06,225 --> 00:15:08,575
I was saying they are perfect for each other.

147
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,855
Even if that is what you meant.

148
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:16,375
Why are you doing this on such a joyous day?

149
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:17,915
You should stop this.

150
00:15:17,915 --> 00:15:21,105
All right, you should have a drink.

151
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,985
Your Majesty.

152
00:15:37,325 --> 00:15:39,205
Your Majesty,

153
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:42,625
you have finally done it.

154
00:15:44,605 --> 00:15:47,245
We accomplished it together.

155
00:15:47,245 --> 00:15:49,375
If it was not for you,

156
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:52,755
I would not have made it this far.

157
00:16:28,555 --> 00:16:31,585
[The day of the Prince's Rebellion]

158
00:16:31,585 --> 00:16:33,935
I am afraid.

159
00:16:33,935 --> 00:16:35,635
Do not be afraid.

160
00:16:35,635 --> 00:16:39,765
The history stands with us tonight.

161
00:16:41,055 --> 00:16:44,015
I wonder what my father will think.

162
00:16:44,015 --> 00:16:46,605
We just need to show the people

163
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:50,285
that our rebellion was the right move.

164
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:07,405
If it was not for you, and if I was alone,

165
00:17:07,405 --> 00:17:10,165
I would not have even dared start this.

166
00:17:10,165 --> 00:17:12,265
I also...

167
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:16,725
only dared to dream of this because of you.

168
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:25,315
The world that will unfold before us

169
00:17:25,315 --> 00:17:29,045
will be different from the past.

170
00:17:29,045 --> 00:17:34,405
Do not be afraid and forge onward.

171
00:17:37,585 --> 00:17:40,625
There will be many unexpected losses.

172
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:43,095
It is something we must bear.

173
00:17:47,935 --> 00:17:51,085
The heavens made this position for you.

174
00:17:51,085 --> 00:17:55,755
This glory belongs solely to you.

175
00:17:55,755 --> 00:18:02,155
You should now carry out your great plans, Your Majesty.

176

177

00:18:26,155 --> 00:18:29,475
Maybe it is because the king has changed,

181
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:32,115
but it is so dry.

182
00:18:32,115 --> 00:18:34,475
It is because the heavens are angry.

183
00:18:34,475 --> 00:18:36,675
I mean, he killed so many people.

184
00:18:36,675 --> 00:18:39,385
Supposedly, he killed all of his younger siblings.

185
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:41,325
That's right!

186
00:18:41,325 --> 00:18:45,195
And then he rode the curtails of the Queen to become King.

187
00:18:45,195 --> 00:18:46,595
Why are you whispering?

188
00:18:46,595 --> 00:18:48,995
Everyone already knows that.

189
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:52,945
The Taesangwang ran off with the royal seal, so he did not have to see that.

190
00:18:52,945 --> 00:18:54,215
What?

191
00:18:54,215 --> 00:18:58,845
Then the King does not even have the royal seal?

192
00:19:02,535 --> 00:19:06,265
Is it to your liking, Pan Su*, sir?
(Male shaman, usually blind)

193
00:19:09,885 --> 00:19:12,315
The blind fortuneteller?

194
00:19:15,545 --> 00:19:17,355
Do you have a room?

195
00:19:20,845 --> 00:19:22,505
Mother.

196
00:19:26,285 --> 00:19:28,375
I asked if you have a room.

197
00:20:02,345 --> 00:20:08,315
All the talk in the marketplace speaks negatively of His Majesty's legitimacy.

198
00:20:08,315 --> 00:20:10,935
Did Pan Su say that?

199
00:20:11,815 --> 00:20:14,955
The officials are also whispering things.

200
00:20:18,595 --> 00:20:20,585
No!

201
00:20:35,595 --> 00:20:37,735
[Crown Prince Yi Bang Seok, Yi Bang Won's half-brother]

202
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:41,865
How dare you!

203
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:44,425
<i>I told him</i>

204
00:20:44,425 --> 00:20:47,185
that he must not kill him.

205
00:20:47,185 --> 00:20:50,505
It is not like he killed him himself.

206
00:20:54,315 --> 00:21:00,305
Many in Jeonju have had their property stolen and have become slaves.

207
00:21:00,305 --> 00:21:05,435
Thus, I wish to restore their commoner status.

208
00:21:07,495 --> 00:21:10,505
However, Your Majesty!

209
00:21:10,505 --> 00:21:11,635
What is it?

210
00:21:11,635 --> 00:21:17,015
Then, there will be nobility who lose their property.

211
00:21:17,015 --> 00:21:21,225
How will you deal with their discontent?

212
00:21:21,225 --> 00:21:23,975
If they gained by stealing from innocent people,

213
00:21:23,975 --> 00:21:27,395
how could you say that it is their property?

214
00:21:32,265 --> 00:21:35,155
It has been so long since we requested the proclamation and the seal from Ming.

215
00:21:35,155 --> 00:21:37,735
Why is there still no word?

216
00:21:38,535 --> 00:21:40,735
The Ming Emperor Yunwen must be

217
00:21:40,735 --> 00:21:44,475
preoccupied with his ongoing war against the Prince of Yan, Zhu Di.

218
00:21:44,475 --> 00:21:48,795
It is not like we sent an envoy without knowing that.

219
00:21:48,795 --> 00:21:51,435
My apologies, Your Majesty.

220
00:21:53,685 --> 00:21:55,315
Not too long ago,

221
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:58,135
I sent green grapes to Father

222
00:21:58,135 --> 00:22:00,935
at the temporary palace in Soyo Mountain.

223
00:22:00,935 --> 00:22:04,785
We are trying our best in every way we can,

224
00:22:04,785 --> 00:22:10,395
so in time, Father will open his heart to us again.

225
00:22:14,295 --> 00:22:16,075
Thank you.

226
00:22:20,225 --> 00:22:24,435
Just because Ming is slow to issue the proclamation and the seal,

227
00:22:24,435 --> 00:22:27,305
you do not need to grow anxious.

228
00:22:27,305 --> 00:22:30,525
While Ming is embroiled in their internal strife,

229
00:22:31,995 --> 00:22:34,915
should we have aimed to secure Liaodong?

230
00:22:35,905 --> 00:22:38,225
Or was Sam Bong correct?
[Sam Bong: the pen name of Jeong Do Jeon]

231
00:22:38,225 --> 00:22:42,935
You know the Prince of Yan, Zhu Di, better than anyone.

232
00:22:42,935 --> 00:22:49,245
In the early days of our kingdom's foundation, he can cause the death of our people.

233
00:23:08,895 --> 00:23:11,145
Do not be anxious.

234
00:23:13,005 --> 00:23:15,685
You are doing well.

235
00:23:28,545 --> 00:23:33,385
[Temporary Palace in Soyo Mountain]

236
00:23:45,665 --> 00:23:50,045
The Queen has carefully preserved green grapes from last early summer-

237
00:23:50,045 --> 00:23:51,795
At one time,

238
00:23:52,795 --> 00:23:55,635
I valued you greatly.

239
00:23:58,695 --> 00:24:02,165
So, what are you doing in the palace now?

240
00:24:02,165 --> 00:24:04,945
I am in charge of lamp duties.

241
00:24:04,945 --> 00:24:08,425
Lighting and extinguishing the lamps?

242
00:24:13,335 --> 00:24:15,155
Do you like it?

243
00:24:46,115 --> 00:24:53,165
You will need to tell the King you serve what I did after receiving this...

244
00:24:54,465 --> 00:24:57,695
and to the Queen.

245
00:24:57,695 --> 00:25:00,155
Then, will your neck remain intact?

246
00:25:00,155 --> 00:25:02,685
Your Majesty, how could you say such things?

247
00:25:02,685 --> 00:25:04,735
Come closer.

248
00:25:21,865 --> 00:25:23,615
I cannot.

249
00:25:23,615 --> 00:25:30,215
Someone I once valued traveled a long way.

250
00:25:31,985 --> 00:25:34,075
This is valuable.

251
00:25:52,325 --> 00:25:54,345
Won Beom.

252
00:25:55,645 --> 00:25:57,075
Yes.

253
00:26:12,375 --> 00:26:15,465
What do we call your father?

254
00:26:15,465 --> 00:26:17,505
Father, Your Majesty.

255
00:26:17,505 --> 00:26:21,155
Aigoo, that is right. Aigoo, you are so smart.

256
00:26:21,155 --> 00:26:25,205
Then, when you talk to Father,

257
00:26:25,205 --> 00:26:27,245
what did I tell you to say first?

258
00:26:27,245 --> 00:26:29,805
I humbly ask for your attention.

259
00:26:29,805 --> 00:26:33,225
Aigoo, my child. Aigoo, my child.

260
00:26:38,655 --> 00:26:42,545
Will His Excellency Ha Ryun believe us?

261
00:26:42,545 --> 00:26:43,695
What do you mean?

262
00:26:43,695 --> 00:26:46,465
That he is the King's son?

263
00:26:46,465 --> 00:26:50,515
We came here because we could not raise the Prince in that rural place.

264
00:26:50,515 --> 00:26:53,995
But this is definitely not a simple matter.

265
00:26:56,435 --> 00:26:58,835
Either we enter the palace,

266
00:26:58,835 --> 00:27:01,395
or just die.

267
00:27:03,105 --> 00:27:05,165
It is one or the other.

268
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,745
I said it would just take a moment!

269
00:27:07,745 --> 00:27:10,335
Gosh, this woman!

270
00:27:10,335 --> 00:27:13,085
Aigoo, I told you I cannot! What is wrong with you?

271
00:27:13,085 --> 00:27:14,715
Let us meet with His Excellency.

272
00:27:14,715 --> 00:27:16,465
It is about something very important!

273
00:27:16,465 --> 00:27:19,215
He is not someone anyone can just come to meet!

274
00:27:19,215 --> 00:27:21,035
Anyone? Anyone!

275
00:27:21,035 --> 00:27:23,245
Will you be able to handle the consequences?

276
00:27:23,245 --> 00:27:25,775
Do not do something you will regret later!

277
00:27:25,775 --> 00:27:29,275
How could you threaten people like that?

278
00:27:29,275 --> 00:27:31,665
Aigoo, Your Excellency.

279
00:27:31,665 --> 00:27:32,985
What is the matter?

280
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:35,215
They wanted to meet with you, Your Excellency.

281
00:27:43,625 --> 00:27:47,925
Your Excellency, do you recognize me?

282
00:27:48,925 --> 00:27:51,315
You used to serve the late Queen Dowager...

283
00:27:51,315 --> 00:27:56,595
Yes, I am Yeong Sil, who moved to Chudong afterward.

284
00:27:56,595 --> 00:27:59,045
I remember.

285
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:02,585
Is it not the current Queen who saved you back then

286
00:28:02,585 --> 00:28:05,265
from being beaten to death by the Queen Dowager?

287
00:28:05,265 --> 00:28:07,375
That is so.

288
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:09,785
But...

289
00:28:09,785 --> 00:28:11,885
you used to serve the Queen.

290
00:28:11,885 --> 00:28:14,745
It would be easier for you if you went to Yeoheung Buwongun's house.

291
00:28:14,745 --> 00:28:16,895
Why did you come to me?

292
00:28:27,335 --> 00:28:29,605
How is Father?

293
00:28:29,605 --> 00:28:31,625
Is he well?

294
00:28:31,625 --> 00:28:33,825
Yes.

295
00:28:33,825 --> 00:28:35,395
All right.

296
00:28:36,795 --> 00:28:42,015
Did he enjoy the green grapes that the Queen sent him?

297
00:28:42,015 --> 00:28:45,755
Yes, he enjoyed them very much.

298
00:28:48,695 --> 00:28:50,875
Did he say anything else?

299
00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:53,135
He did not.

300
00:28:58,785 --> 00:29:02,225
Do you know the reason the Queen sent you?

301
00:29:03,535 --> 00:29:05,305
Yes.

302
00:29:05,305 --> 00:29:08,425
How did he seem when you went to see him?

303
00:29:08,425 --> 00:29:10,765
Will he return to the palace?

304
00:29:17,795 --> 00:29:21,895
<i>Your Majesty the King, His Excellency Ha Ryun is here.</i>

305
00:29:21,895 --> 00:29:24,305
Have him enter.

306
00:29:24,305 --> 00:29:26,295
You may leave.

307
00:29:36,025 --> 00:29:40,015
Your Majesty, I have something urgent to tell you.

308
00:29:40,805 --> 00:29:43,825
Do you remember a girl named Yeong Sil when you lived

309
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:46,905
in your former residence in Chudong several years ago?

310
00:29:50,445 --> 00:29:52,715
Yeong Sil?

311
00:30:17,875 --> 00:30:21,005
It is the date of the royal consummation.

312
00:30:26,035 --> 00:30:30,235
Please bless us with a prince.

313
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:25,785
[Sincerity]

314
00:32:40,795 --> 00:32:43,285
You wrote it well.

315
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:47,625
What brings you here?

316
00:32:52,645 --> 00:32:54,665
Do you remember...

317
00:32:55,745 --> 00:32:57,885
Yeong Sil?

318
00:33:01,985 --> 00:33:04,435
She is raising a prince.

319
00:33:07,275 --> 00:33:10,065
Are you sure?

320
00:33:10,065 --> 00:33:11,925
Yes.

321
00:33:11,925 --> 00:33:14,075
Then...

322
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:17,005
was it because of you

323
00:33:17,005 --> 00:33:20,065
that she suddenly disappeared back then?

324
00:33:22,385 --> 00:33:24,195
That, I do not know.

325
00:33:24,195 --> 00:33:26,605
Where is that child?

326
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:29,275
It appears they went to His Excellency Ha Ryun.

327
00:33:29,275 --> 00:33:33,165
I must meet that child first.

328
00:33:33,165 --> 00:33:36,755
Thus, you should stay put, Your Majesty.

329
00:33:36,755 --> 00:33:38,445
Queen...

330
00:33:55,705 --> 00:33:57,215
Queen, you should leave.

331
00:33:57,215 --> 00:33:59,005
Leave and call for the inspectors.

332
00:33:59,005 --> 00:34:00,605
Hurry!

333
00:34:03,945 --> 00:34:06,215
Is no one out there?

334
00:34:16,915 --> 00:34:18,415
Queen, you should leave.

335
00:34:18,415 --> 00:34:20,815
I will buy us time.

336
00:35:09,485 --> 00:35:12,675
Your Majesty, are you all right?

337
00:35:14,395 --> 00:35:16,725
Your Majesty!

338
00:35:16,725 --> 00:35:19,305
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!
(Watch on www.kisskh.la or www.kisskh.co to support Admin)

339
00:35:19,305 --> 00:35:21,365
Your Majesty, are you all right?

340
00:35:21,365 --> 00:35:23,565
Your Majesty, this way.

341
00:35:27,605 --> 00:35:29,485
Please be careful.

342
00:35:58,225 --> 00:36:01,035
<i>There is a fire!</i>

343
00:36:01,035 --> 00:36:02,655
<i>Put the fire out!</i>

344
00:36:02,655 --> 00:36:05,245
<i>Fire!</i>

345
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:11,065
It was Won Beom.

346
00:36:11,065 --> 00:36:12,755
It was definitely him.

347
00:36:13,585 --> 00:36:15,085
Then...

348
00:36:16,115 --> 00:36:18,925
Father sent him.

349
00:36:59,235 --> 00:37:03,015
Who came last night to harm His Majesty?

350
00:37:03,015 --> 00:37:05,395
I do not know.

351
00:37:05,395 --> 00:37:07,325
You do not know?

352
00:37:09,025 --> 00:37:14,615
Someone saw you secretly meet someone last night.

353
00:37:15,825 --> 00:37:17,695
Just kill me.

354
00:37:17,695 --> 00:37:19,595
You ask to be killed...

355
00:37:19,615 --> 00:37:22,515
- This bastard is holding out to the end!
- Do you not have

356
00:37:22,515 --> 00:37:26,905
an elder mother who is now blind?

357
00:37:26,905 --> 00:37:29,505
Dying as a traitor may be the end for you,

358
00:37:29,505 --> 00:37:31,805
but what about your mother?

359
00:37:32,585 --> 00:37:35,255
After you die, your mother will

360
00:37:35,255 --> 00:37:38,885
either die from being stoned or from starvation.

361
00:37:51,855 --> 00:37:54,715
Promise me.

362
00:37:54,715 --> 00:37:58,955
That even if I am to die,

363
00:37:58,955 --> 00:38:01,595
you will spare my mother...

364
00:38:01,595 --> 00:38:03,725
I promise.

365
00:38:03,725 --> 00:38:05,625
So tell me.

366
00:38:05,625 --> 00:38:07,365
Who is it?

367
00:38:11,345 --> 00:38:13,245
Who is it?

368
00:38:15,645 --> 00:38:18,095
Gabyeolcho.
[Gabyeolcho: Tae Jo Yi Seong Gye's private army]

369
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:21,465
Gabyeolcho of Dongbukmyeon.

370
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:24,155
Gabyeolcho of Dongbukmyeon.
[Dongbukmyeon: Where Tae Jo Yi Seong Gye is from]

371
00:38:24,155 --> 00:38:26,955
Then the man who ordered this was...

372
00:38:28,435 --> 00:38:30,285
Tae...

373
00:38:31,285 --> 00:38:33,125
Sang...

374
00:38:38,442 --> 00:38:40,352
How dare you...

375
00:38:40,352 --> 00:38:43,342
slander the Taesangwang!

376
00:38:58,106 --> 00:38:59,726
Your Majesty.

377
00:39:29,046 --> 00:39:33,506
Our family has finally produced someone who passed the state examination!

378
00:39:33,506 --> 00:39:35,306
Yes, Father.

379
00:39:36,746 --> 00:39:39,116
Thank you,

380
00:39:39,116 --> 00:39:41,336
and thank you again.

381
00:39:41,336 --> 00:39:45,876
The scorn I have suffered due to my lack of scholarly background...

382
00:39:45,876 --> 00:39:50,416
You have fulfilled that lack for me.

383
00:39:52,856 --> 00:39:58,926
From now on, the one who will carry out my will

384
00:39:58,926 --> 00:40:01,106
is you, Bang Won.

385
00:40:03,856 --> 00:40:05,656
Come here!

386
00:40:19,356 --> 00:40:23,596
<i>How dare you!</i>

387
00:40:29,106 --> 00:40:31,066
Father...

388
00:40:34,936 --> 00:40:36,966
<i>Lady Min, you possess</i>

389
00:40:36,966 --> 00:40:39,906
<i>modest refinement and unparalleled beauty, demonstrating virtue and wisdom.</i>

390
00:40:39,906 --> 00:40:43,986
<i>In private, they say the King and their Min family</i>

391
00:40:43,986 --> 00:40:46,756
<i>share joint rule.</i>

392
00:40:46,756 --> 00:40:50,026
<i>If the Queen was born as a man,</i>

393
00:40:50,026 --> 00:40:53,036
<i>would she not have become the King?</i>

394
00:40:58,046 --> 00:41:00,076
<i>Your Majesty,</i>

395
00:41:00,076 --> 00:41:03,466
<i>you have finally done it.</i>

396
00:41:04,446 --> 00:41:07,066
<i>We accomplished it together.</i>

397
00:41:07,066 --> 00:41:09,186
<i>If it was not for you,</i>

398
00:41:10,006 --> 00:41:12,096
<i>I would not have made it this far.</i>

399
00:41:12,096 --> 00:41:16,086
<i>Congratulations!</i>

400
00:41:16,086 --> 00:41:20,026
<i>Congratulations!</i>

401
00:41:23,016 --> 00:41:27,326
<i>The history stands with us tonight.</i>

402
00:41:28,746 --> 00:41:32,036
<i>The world that will unfold before us</i>

403
00:41:32,036 --> 00:41:35,016
<i>will be different from the past.</i>

404
00:41:38,396 --> 00:41:42,316
<i>Congratulations!</i>

405
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:49,776
<i>Congratulations!</i>

406
00:42:07,556 --> 00:42:11,666
He is arrogant and even disrespectful.

407
00:42:11,666 --> 00:42:15,976
What would he be afraid of when he controls the military?

408
00:42:18,726 --> 00:42:22,196
His father is the Left State Minister, and his older sister is the Queen.

409
00:42:22,196 --> 00:42:25,476
Now, he even has the prince on his back.

410
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:28,836
Is Yeoganggun the Middle Army Commander?

411
00:42:28,836 --> 00:42:30,746
Yes, Your Majesty.

412
00:43:51,286 --> 00:43:52,796
Oh, my. Aigoo.

413
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:54,696
Are you all right?

414
00:43:58,616 --> 00:44:00,386
How dare you!

415
00:44:03,226 --> 00:44:05,036
Your Majesty!

416
00:44:06,036 --> 00:44:07,876
Mother!

417
00:44:27,596 --> 00:44:29,856
You do not need to cry.

418
00:44:31,416 --> 00:44:32,746
Yes.

419
00:44:37,516 --> 00:44:39,526
Was it that child?

420
00:44:41,796 --> 00:44:43,206
Yes.

421
00:44:46,566 --> 00:44:52,076
From now on, I will handle everything involving you.

422
00:44:52,076 --> 00:44:58,826
Thus, you just have to follow what I say.

423
00:44:58,826 --> 00:45:00,756
Do you understand?

424
00:45:02,296 --> 00:45:03,756
Yes.

425
00:45:21,286 --> 00:45:23,396
It is so upsetting.

426
00:45:23,396 --> 00:45:26,896
How could he leave Your Majesty and be with another woman?

427
00:45:30,466 --> 00:45:32,426
Your Majesty!

428
00:45:35,456 --> 00:45:37,756
It is nothing.

429
00:45:42,346 --> 00:45:45,446
It is nothing if you treat it as such.

430
00:45:58,226 --> 00:45:59,766
Your Majesty.

431
00:46:02,046 --> 00:46:06,036
What kind of life did that girl Yeong Sil live?

432
00:46:07,936 --> 00:46:10,466
Why do you ask?

433
00:46:11,456 --> 00:46:14,176
I am thinking of bringing her into the palace.

434
00:46:16,416 --> 00:46:20,696
Not just your offspring, the prince?

435
00:46:24,126 --> 00:46:27,106
I am not sure how the Queen will react to that.

436
00:46:28,956 --> 00:46:31,196
I will do that.

437
00:46:31,196 --> 00:46:34,096
Go and tell the Secretary of Royal Orders.

438
00:46:35,516 --> 00:46:37,476
Yes, Your Majesty.

439
00:46:43,296 --> 00:46:47,726
<i>The King ordered to bring Yeong Sil and her son into the palace.</i>

440
00:46:49,036 --> 00:46:54,306
Your Majesty, today is the date Seowungwan set for a royal consummation.

441
00:46:54,306 --> 00:46:56,326
Your Majesty, I am not sure what is the matter,

442
00:46:56,326 --> 00:47:01,146
but it will not be too late to speak to His Majesty when he comes to your chambers.

443
00:47:03,336 --> 00:47:05,056
Your Majesty.

444
00:47:05,056 --> 00:47:06,696
Open the door.

445
00:47:09,196 --> 00:47:11,906
Please come down from your throne.

446
00:47:14,396 --> 00:47:18,446
I wish to speak to you on the same eye level.

447
00:47:20,516 --> 00:47:23,586
This is a matter between a husband and wife.

448
00:47:35,236 --> 00:47:37,736
Telling me what to do...

449
00:47:37,736 --> 00:47:40,846
Do you now want to sit on this throne as well?

450
00:47:42,436 --> 00:47:43,976
I will bring Yeong Sil into the palace.

451
00:47:43,976 --> 00:47:50,396
Do you think I came here just over the matter of bringing her into the palace?

452
00:47:50,396 --> 00:47:52,986
I asked you to entrust me with everything involving Yeong Sil.

453
00:47:52,986 --> 00:47:54,496
I said I would handle it.

454
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:57,596
She is raising my child outside the palace.

455
00:47:58,596 --> 00:48:03,396
Is that something to be so proud of in front of me?

456
00:48:05,796 --> 00:48:08,136
Whether or not Yeong Sil is brought into the palace is a matter of royal concubines!

457
00:48:08,136 --> 00:48:10,016
I get to decide that!

458
00:48:10,016 --> 00:48:13,506
- Queen.
- Since you are the ruler of a nation,

459
00:48:13,506 --> 00:48:16,286
I was not going to let that child just be.

460
00:48:16,286 --> 00:48:21,336
So, you should have trusted me and waited.

461
00:48:24,186 --> 00:48:26,206
Wait?

462
00:48:26,206 --> 00:48:28,826
You are telling the King to wait?

463
00:48:41,106 --> 00:48:45,026
Back then, of all the women out there,

464
00:48:45,026 --> 00:48:48,436
why did it have to be Yeong Sil?

465
00:48:48,436 --> 00:48:51,336
Yeong Sil used to serve me.

466
00:48:51,336 --> 00:48:53,586
I valued her greatly.

467
00:48:53,646 --> 00:48:58,046
So, why did you have to make me jealous of her?

468
00:48:59,346 --> 00:49:02,626
Do you know how humiliating this is?

469
00:49:04,476 --> 00:49:06,646
Humiliating?

470
00:49:06,646 --> 00:49:09,726
Queen Shindeok, the woman my father loved,

471
00:49:09,726 --> 00:49:13,986
and Sam Bong, the subject my father trusted wholeheartedly,

472
00:49:13,986 --> 00:49:17,296
they tried to kill me at every chance.

473
00:49:17,296 --> 00:49:20,856
To survive, I had to cling to your family, who possessed

474
00:49:20,856 --> 00:49:23,126
great power and strong private military.

475
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:25,996
That humiliation you say you felt!

476
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:28,716
I felt it very often and endured it every time.

477
00:49:28,716 --> 00:49:30,376
How is that the same?

478
00:49:30,376 --> 00:49:33,146
I do not think they are different.

479
00:49:35,376 --> 00:49:37,206
Is that why you chose Yeong Sil...

480
00:49:37,206 --> 00:49:41,686
I thought it was the most effective way to humiliate you.

481
00:49:47,836 --> 00:49:55,176
Your Majesty, you do not seem to be the person I have known for a long time.

482
00:49:57,896 --> 00:50:00,636
I am the King of this nation

483
00:50:00,636 --> 00:50:02,696
and you are now my subject.

484
00:50:02,696 --> 00:50:07,186
I will make all the decisions, and you just have to follow them.

485
00:50:08,186 --> 00:50:09,626
I am not your subject.

486
00:50:09,626 --> 00:50:11,216
This nation is a nation of Neo-Confucianism.

487
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:15,846
Then, that Neo-Confucianism is wrong.

488
00:51:06,596 --> 00:51:10,046
<i>Her Majesty the Queen is here.</i>

489
00:51:43,856 --> 00:51:45,606
Chae Ryeong.

490
00:53:18,496 --> 00:53:20,416
This one.

491
00:53:20,416 --> 00:53:24,256
The royal consummation between the King and the Queen differs from common marriage.

492
00:53:24,256 --> 00:53:27,136
It is an affair concerning the future of the state.

493
00:53:27,136 --> 00:53:28,316
Please keep this in mind.

494
00:53:28,316 --> 00:53:31,646
She is already mindful of it.

495
00:53:35,426 --> 00:53:39,056
You must put out the fire so you cannot see His Majesty.

496
00:53:39,056 --> 00:53:42,146
You must lie down to the left of His Majesty.

497
00:53:42,146 --> 00:53:44,536
You must not make any noise,

498
00:53:44,536 --> 00:53:47,716
and you must not lay your hand on His Majesty's body.

499
00:53:47,716 --> 00:53:51,246
You must never climb on top of His Majesty's body.

500
00:53:51,246 --> 00:53:52,976
Court Lady Jeong.

501
00:53:52,976 --> 00:53:54,846
Yes, Your Majesty.

502
00:53:55,716 --> 00:53:59,226
I will refuse the royal consummation.

503
00:53:59,226 --> 00:54:00,846
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

504
00:54:00,846 --> 00:54:05,646
Your Majesty, the royal consummation is the Queen's duty!

505
00:54:05,696 --> 00:54:10,106
Your Majesty, many people will die if you just leave like this.

506
00:54:10,106 --> 00:54:13,036
So, please do not leave.

507
00:54:13,036 --> 00:54:15,176
Your Majesty...

508
00:55:48,706 --> 00:55:54,126
If you are ready, then start the royal consummation.

509
00:56:00,006 --> 00:56:04,476
You changed as soon as you became King.

510
00:56:04,476 --> 00:56:06,146
"Let us share in everything,

511
00:56:06,146 --> 00:56:08,116
let us go through everything together..."

512
00:56:08,116 --> 00:56:10,776
Did you forget what you said?

513
00:56:10,776 --> 00:56:14,236
- Queen.
- If I knew you would change this badly,

514
00:56:14,236 --> 00:56:19,646
I would not have utilized my entire family to make you King.

515
00:56:56,716 --> 00:56:58,656
Is anyone outside!

516
00:57:13,746 --> 00:57:16,036
Where is His Majesty?

517
00:57:49,626 --> 00:57:51,936
You must not go in.

518
00:57:51,936 --> 00:57:53,456
What do you mean I must not?

519
00:57:54,209 --> 00:57:59,209
You cannot enter his chambers, Your Majesty.

520
00:58:03,721 --> 00:58:05,901
Who is the one

521
00:58:07,291 --> 00:58:08,911
in his chambers?

522
00:58:23,691 --> 00:58:27,211
Your Majesty, we will send her in.

523
00:59:40,301 --> 00:59:42,861
[The Queen Who Crowns]

524
00:59:42,951 --> 00:59:51,691
♫ <i>Only the moonlight lights up the entire mountain</i> ♫

525
00:59:51,691 --> 01:00:01,781
♫ <i>Oh, heavens, holding your breath from being shy</i> ♫

526
01:00:01,781 --> 01:00:11,311
♫ <i>Until the day breaks</i> ♫

527
01:00:11,311 --> 01:00:19,591
♫ <i>We are separated, and I sing alone</i> ♫

528
01:00:19,591 --> 01:00:23,651
<i>I will chase you out of the palace.</i>

529
01:00:24,631 --> 01:00:26,071
<i>Did the Queen do this?</i>

530
01:00:26,071 --> 01:00:28,961
<i>Did you change now that you have attained power?</i>

531
01:00:28,961 --> 01:00:32,441
<i>He asked Your Majesty to come to a Buddhist ritual ceremony.</i>

532
01:00:32,441 --> 01:00:34,251
<i>Is that not strange?</i>

533
01:00:34,251 --> 01:00:36,591
<i>What do you desire to gain by killing me?</i>

534
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:39,751
<i>Undoing everything that went wrong.</i>

535
01:00:39,751 --> 01:00:42,121
<i>No, you must not!</i>

536
01:00:42,121 --> 01:00:44,561
<i>Arrest the Taesangwang.</i>
