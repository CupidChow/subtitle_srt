<i>Not only that, but there are many cases of people</i>

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,850
<i>not receiving Your Majesty's charity rice.</i>

8
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:51,280
<i>From what I hear, all this is connected to Myeongseon Daebu.</i>

9
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,830
<i>It is clear Myeongseon Daebu is gathering forces and defying Your Majesty.</i>

10
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:59,820
<i>In such a situation, who would respect the authority of the monarch?</i>

11
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,950
<i>Your Majesty should summon the Minister of Finance and find out what happened.</i>

12
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,180
You just need to find the Chief Court Lady.

13
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,740
Then, it will be delivered to His Majesty.

14
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,280
I will go and deliver this well.

15
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:09,830
He wanted to see inside the capital city.

16
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,270
Have a good trip.

17
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,260
And enjoy touring the capital.

18
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,560
Yes.

19
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,910
Thank you.

[Episode 10]

21
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,830
Dansan Buwongun is here.

22
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,960
Have you been well?

23
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,950
[Dansan Buwongun Yi Mu: Aided the establishment of Joseon and Tae Jong's ascension to the throne]

24
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,210
In the Year of the Yellow Tiger,

25
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:25,000
I helped you two to eliminate Sam Bong
[Sam Bong: Jeong Do Jeon]

26
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,520
and helped make the current king.

27
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,040
I never imagined a day like this would come.

28
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:36,980
So,

29
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,560
have you looked into it?

30
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,750
Yes.

31
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,580
Will they join forces with us?

32
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,640
The Ministry of Defense, the Royal Guards, and the Capital Security Office.

33
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,450
Everyone who used to follow you two is enraged.

34
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:57,900
The King probably penalized them

35
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,390
for following the Min family.

36
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:05,570
Then, what are you planning to do?

37
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:09,200
The King always suffered from a boil.

38
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,810
We will exacerbate that ailment, then use that as a pretext

39
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:17,640
to put forth the Crown Prince and seize the throne.

40
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:23,640
Then, we will need the help of the Queen more than anything.

41
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,190
The Queen is your sister, so of course-

42
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:27,190
First, you should

43
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:30,060
discreetly...

44
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,590
gauge her intentions.

45
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:35,070
Yes.

46
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,840
You should have a drink.

47
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,050
Your Majesty.

48
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,920
Are you not Mu Hyul?

49
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,140
Look who this is.

50
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,520
Are you not Dansan Buwongun Yi Mu?

51
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,300
You have not forgotten me?

52
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,090
How could I ever forget you?

53
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,900
[Yeowongun Min Mu Hyul: Queen Won Gyeong's younger brother]
But why have I not seen you around recently?

54
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:08,020
I used illness as an excuse to stay away from the court.

55
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,980
Let us go inside.

56
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,560
Have the Crown Prince ascend to the throne

57
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,350
and take over the regency?

58
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,140
- Yes.
- That is nonsense!

59
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:34,110
How could I when His Majesty is still strong and healthy?

60
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,580
The King has suffered from a boil for a long time.

61
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,580
While he lived at the private residence,

62
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,880
he used to lay ill for a few days when it got worse.

63
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,670
But I hear that it has gotten worse lately.

64
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,930
What is it that you want to say?

65
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:51,900
We will secretly exacerbate the boil.

66
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,910
- What did you say?
- Use that opportunity to put forth the Crown Prince

67
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:58,400
and take control of the military with our men-

68
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,590
Did I just hear you wrong?

69
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,350
You dare propose treason?

70
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,780
We are simply saying we should reclaim the power stolen from us.

71
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,770
Dansan Buwongun!

72
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:12,400
Do you wish to die by my sword here right now?

73
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,470
Your Majesty!

74
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,870
Or shall I notify the King of this treason?

75
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,390
Then, will you leave Hyungnims like that?

76
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,940
Shut up!

77
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,200
I will pretend I did not hear this.

78
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:26,510
If you ever come to me again regarding this matter,

79
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:31,680
all of you will not be able to retain your life.

80
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,360
Oh, you are here.

81
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,480
- Where is he?
- Inside.

82
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,880
Let us go at once.

83
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:52,180
Yi Mu came by.

84
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,480
Yes.

85
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,440
Yi Mu, who visited Jeju,

86
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,100
went to Hoeamsa to meet with the Queen...

87
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:07,290
Things are going so well on their own.

88
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,060
What should we do?

89
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,560
Anything else besides that?

90
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,780
The Queen seems to have sent someone to the palace.

91
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:22,650
- Someone?
- It seemed like he was carrying a letter.

92
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,040
Hear ye!

93
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:42,220
Yes, Your Excellency.

94
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,380
Who ruined these flowers like this!

95
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,820
Find who did this immediately! Right now!

96
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,120
Yes.

97
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,750
A letter...

98
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,380
By the way,

99
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,830
where will we stay for the night?

100
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:12,640
Let us find a tavern somewhere or another place where we can stay the night.

101
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,040
Yes.

102
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,740
It was somewhere around here...

103
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,060
Oh, that must be it!

104
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,520
Who are you!

105
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,480
Catch him!

106
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,890
Is this the letter the Queen sent to the palace?

107
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,580
Yes, Your Excellency.

108
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:28,550
I almost would have ended up dying.

109
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,530
So, are you telling me right now

110
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:39,030
that Dansan Buwongun met with Yeoganggun and Yeoseonggun

111
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:42,740
who are in exile and met with the Queen

112
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,230
to plot treason?

113
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,960
That is so.

114
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,920
Do you have proof?

115
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,220
Yes, Your Majesty.

116
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,530
If you cannot,

117
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,910
you will have to give up your life.

118
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:23,860
[Dansan Buwongun Yi Mu: Aided the establishment of Joseon and Tae Jong's ascension to the throne]

119

120

Your Majesty!

121
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,620
Your Majesty!

122
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,630
You should not be so quick to execute him.

123
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:53,000
Who will get hurt if this becomes a point of contention?

124
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,570
It will be the Queen and the Crown Prince.

125
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,950
Though Yeoganggun and Yeoseonggun in Jeju-do

126
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:00,160
failed to carry it out, but they clearly plotted treason.

127
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,650
Are you not friends with Yeoheung Buwongun?

128
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:04,800
He was my friend.

129
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,440
Do you not think you are being too cold-hearted?

130
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,590
Your Majesty!

131
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,420
Let us wrap this up by executing Yi Mu.

132
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,840
Your Majesty.

133
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,220
I will go on hunting for a moment.

134
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,230
Though you may avoid it for the time being,

135
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:19,190
you will have to decide on this at some point.

136
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:22,470
You want to go hunting all of a sudden?

137
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,670
- That is correct.
- Then, I will follow you, Father-
[Yi Je: Grand Prince Yangnyeong]

138
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,610
You should stay in the palace.

139

Stay in the palace

140

and handle the affairs of the state in my place.

141
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,780

Yes.

143
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,960
You two should not fight for the rest of your lives.

144
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,630
- Yes.
- Yes.

145
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:53,380
Do not do anything to upset each other

146

Yes.

149

It seems the King will be vacating the capital for a week.

175
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:43,770
Then, we should return to the palace during that time.

176
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:45,280
If you return while he is away,

177
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:50,200
he would not be able to do anything, even if he got furious.

178
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:55,140
Did he not say you cannot enter the palace without his permission?

179
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:59,850
Are you afraid of not being able to return to the palace?

I do not want to eat rough rice and vegetable side dishes anymore.

181
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:09,620
But we cannot enjoy such refreshing winds in the palace.

182
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:16,000
And the view of the world from up here is peaceful.

183
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,340
That is all superficial.

184
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,840
If you look closely, whether it is the palace, the temple

185
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,450
or an ordinary household, it is all the same.

186
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,180
What do you mean?

187
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,010
Arguing and quarreling.

188
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,960
Fighting over who will eat and who will eat more.

189
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,140
Fighting here and fighting there.

190
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:34,300
Do their stomachs never get full?

191
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:40,710
Please do not laugh. I am serious.

192
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,700
T-This...

193
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,540
What is this?

194
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:01,310
Your Majesty.

195
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,570
Your Majesty.

196
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:19,900
What is it?

197
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,790
His Majesty said you cannot leave this place

198
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,980
until he gives any further orders.

199
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,360
The King said that?

200
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,620
Why?

201
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:33,000
There is evidence suggesting you plotted treason.

202
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,380
What do you mean, treason?

203
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,750
If not, how could I have mustered the soldiers like this?

204
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,530
As of today, no one in here can leave,

205
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:50,040
and those who are outside cannot enter.

206
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,450
But how is it that you are so beautiful?

207
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:05,000
When I first saw you, I thought you were Her Majesty.

208
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:09,950
That is because you have not seen Her Majesty.

209
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,930
It is a small gift.

210
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:18,210
It is a blush that is popular in Ming right now.

211
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,990
Blush?

212
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,340
My family's youngest is a low-ranking eunuch.

213
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:30,630
I heard the senior pharmacist position opened up.

214
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:31,950
A senior pharmacist...

215
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,130
A senior pharmacist is a 3rd Junior Rank.

216
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:37,930
It is a position responsible for managing medicinal herbs used in the palace.

217
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,930
You should take this back with you.

218
00:17:55,870 --> 00:18:00,390
However, I have heard already that your family's youngest is quite skilled.

219
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:02,260
So, do not worry and return home.

220
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,720
Pardon?

221
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,450
Then...

222
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:08,660
All he has to do is promise to be loyal to me

223
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,580
throughout his stay in the palace.

224
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,310
That is the only promise I need.

225
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:15,680
Of course.

226
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:25,240
I heard that you sometimes give your input regarding various matters in the palace.

227
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,130
Why do you not realize that this is putting an immense burden on His Majesty?

228
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:31,670
- It is just a senior pharmacist position.
- It is not merely "just."

229
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,930
If you cannot accept such a request from me,

230
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:37,970
how embarrassing would it be for me, a royal concubine of the 2nd Junior Rank,

231
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:40,580
who is favored by His Majesty?

232
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,420
Grant me this request.

233
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,640
You must grant me this request!

234
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,830
You are here.

235
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:06,600
Yes, I did as you told me, but...

236
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:12,850
The Queen must never be allowed to leave Hoeamsa.

237
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:16,240
But why did you suddenly give such a dangerous order?

238
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,630
On the day the King finds out-

239
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:20,040
We better make sure he does not find out.

240
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,680
At all costs.

241
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:27,120
While the Queen is detained at Hoeamsa,

242
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:32,240
I will make sure to receive approval to depose the Quee

243
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:35,520
What if you fail to do so?

244
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,680
In the worst-case scenario.

245
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:53,880
must die at the hands of lawless bandits

246
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,020
while she takes a walk near Hoeamsa.

247
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:02,570
In the worst case scenario.

248
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,020
Yes.

249
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,340
<i>Your Excellency.</i>

250
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,170
Is he the one who ruined my flowerbed?

251
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,620
It appears it happened while playing hide-and-seek.

252
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,200
I am sorry, Your Excellency.

253
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,170
Please forgive him this once.

254
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,830
He did not know what he was doing as a kid.

255
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,770
Yes, please forgive him.

256
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,610
Lock him in the shed and starve him to death.

257
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:26,520
- Your Excellency! No, Your Excellency!
- Your Excellency!

258
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,490
- No, he is just a young boy!
- Your Excellency!

259
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:31,290
Just please this once, Your Excellency! I will teach him well!

260
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:33,290
- Hear ye!
- Your Excellency!

261
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,520
Take these people away as well.

262
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,720
- Your Excellency!
- Your Excellency!

263
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,280
- He is only a child! I cannot let him starve to death!
- I am sorry, Your Excellency!

264
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,400
- Your Excellency!
- Your Excellency!

265
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,940
- Your Excellency!
- Your Excellency!

266
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,690
Your Excellency!

267
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:50,150
Your Excellency!

268
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,740
- Monk!
- Oh, child!

269
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,450
What happened?

270
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:35,510
Wake up!

271
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:39,810
Drink it slowly.

272
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,330
Monk,

273
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:50,340
they killed Monk Myeong Ryun.

274
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,800
Goodness.

275
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:55,870
May Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva be praised.

276
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:59,300
May Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva be praised.

277
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,220
Will you be all right?

278
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,970
There is no need for you to go as well.

279
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:13,480
No.

280
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,990
I will follow you as well.

281
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:20,850
I will deliver the message to the people who had their charity rice stolen.

282
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:23,280
Yes, please hurry.

283
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,770
Yes.

284
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,860
Your Majesty, I believe it is this way.

285
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,790
Please be careful.

286
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,620
Careful.

287
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,120
Where are you going?

288
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,710
Who are you?

289
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,200
[Yeosangun Min Mu Hoe, Yeowongun Min Mu Hyul: Younger brothers of Queen Won Gyeong]

290
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,740
So, is the Queen all right?

291
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,260
Yes.

292
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,840
Hyungnim, inside the capital will be more dangerous.

293
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:15,090
Gather up everyone you can.

294
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:17,170
- All right.
- Let us go.

295
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,430
What did you say? How did all those soldiers lose her?

296
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,190
I am sorry.

297
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:27,380
But what if she entered the capital already?

298
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,970
We will need to catch her.

299
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:32,030
We will catch her at all costs and see to the end of this.

300
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,470
Pardon?

301
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,260
Move aside.

302
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,680
Move aside.

303
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,390
She is here.

304
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:25,270
All right, let us go.

305
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,860
Go, go.

306
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,290
Why are you here?

307
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:35,240
I came to strike the Drum of Grievance!

308
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,050
Not just anyone can strike it.

309
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:38,710
There is a procedure to it all.

310
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:41,340
The people are trying to make known how they were wronged.

311
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,800
So, what procedure is needed?

312
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:47,950
Y-Your Majesty.

313
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:05,760
Father!

314
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,980
Father!

315
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,390
What is the matter?

316
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:20,520
Father, please go to the Drum of Grievance.

317
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,950
What are you saying all of a sudden?

318
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:31,330
If I end up in danger, I will let you know.

319
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:33,770
If so, could you help me?

320
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,720
More, more, more.

321
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:05,070
The people are gathering!

322
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:14,220
We had the charity rice granted by the King taken from us unfairly.

323
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:17,060
But when we told the local authorities about this,

324
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:19,560
we were beaten unfairly!

325
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,860
Have any of you experienced that, too?

326
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,530
Here!

327
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:25,500
Here, too!

328
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,780
- Me, too!
- Here, too!

329
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:31,230
- Here, too!
- Here, too!

330
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,030
Here, too!

331
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,530
Me, too!

332
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:35,930
Here, too!

333
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:38,280
Here, too!

334
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:41,220
All of you, stand down!

335
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,440
His Majesty is here!

336
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,920
Everyone, stand down!

337
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,680
Queen, what is going on?

338
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:06,700
The charity rice that you granted the people was not delivered to them.

339
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,430
- What!
- No matter how much they told the local authorities,

340
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:12,600
this fact was not reaching Your Majesty's ears,

341
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,170
so I had them strike the Drum of Grievance like this.

342
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,150
But that is not all.

343
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:24,200
The land that you granted Hoeamsa was not delivered, either.

344
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:27,250
May Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva be praised.

345
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,770
Also,

346
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,670
Suk Beon dared to

347
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:35,500
bring Your Majesty's soldiers under the pretense of royal command

348
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,000
and detained me,

349
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,800
the Queen, at Hoeamsa.

350
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:44,260
Your Majesty.

351
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,910
Is this true?

352
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:47,620
The thing is...

353
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,700
I was told of Your Majesty's orders to detain Her Majesty.

354
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,080
Who was it?

355
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,510
I asked who it was!

356
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:04,300
M-Myeongseon... It was Myeongseon Daebu.

357
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,330
Arrest him!

358
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,180
Your Majesty!

359
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:19,570
- Your Majesty!
- They are hidden followers of the Min family.

360
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:21,300
It appears they came to rescue Her Majesty.

361
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,000
Are you all right?

362
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,320
Your Majesty the Queen!

363
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,320
Please have mercy on us!

364
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,730
<i>Your Majesty the Queen!</i>

365
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:43,910
<i>Your Majesty the Queen!</i>

366
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:47,780
<i>Your Majesty the Queen!</i>

367
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:51,600
<i>Your Majesty the Queen!</i>

368
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,060
<i>Your Majesty the Queen!</i>

369
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:58,160
<i>Your Majesty the Queen!</i>

370
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:02,100
<i>Your Majesty the Queen!</i>

371
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:43,010
Who are you?

372
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:53,750
Wait, listen to me for a moment.

373
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:56,340
- Wait!
- Die!

374
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:45,210
Save me...

375
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,560
If the deed took place,

376
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:25,180
should we not have heard the news already?

377
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,470
No news is good news.

378
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:32,560
I had a good dream last night as well.

379
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:36,630
But,

380
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:43,760
why does the sea look so blue and vast today?

381
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:59,230
While I was away from the palace,

382
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:03,550
I received a detailed report about what happened among the palace ladies.

383
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:06,960
The actions of the palace ladies serving the king need to be blameless

384
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,280
in order for the people to trust and follow the monarch.

385
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:15,020
Sukeui.

386
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,200
Yes.

387
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:24,220
How dare you attempt to intervene in matters of personnel?

388
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:29,020
Your Majesty.

389
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,730
You should now...

390
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:33,690
leave the palace.

391
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,440
Chae Ryeong.

392
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,420
I am His Majesty's concubine.

393
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,820
Unless His Majesty orders-

394
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,310
I am the head of the inner court.

395
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,390
Your Majesty!

396
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:48,650
You pushed yourself to the edge of the cliff!

397
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:03,190
[Petition]

398
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:16,780
Deliver the royal command for Yeoganggun and Yeoseonggun in exile

399
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:19,360
to commit suicide.

400
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:28,850
Your Majesty, Your Majesty!

401
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,030
Your Majesty!

402
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:36,960
The King commanded Yeoganggun and Yeoseonggun to commit suicide.

403
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:42,180
What do we do!

404
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,520
Your Majesty.

405
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,280
Your Majesty.

406
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:39,640
<i>The world that will unfold before us</i>

407
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,320
<i>will be different from the past.</i>

408
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:48,310
<i>Do not be afraid and forge onward.</i>

409
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:53,060
<i>There will be many unexpected losses.</i>

410
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:55,550
<i>It is something we must bear.</i>

411
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:02,230
Her Majesty recovered the bodies of her two younger brothers

412
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:05,210
and had them buried.

413
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:11,010
She will quietly offer a memorial service to console their spirits.

414
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:13,040
Yes...

415
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,100
Thank you, and thank you again.

416
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:22,080
Please convey to Her Majesty that her mother is

417
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:27,530
praying for her well-being as well, Court Lady.

418
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,270
Still, I think you should meet her.

419
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,880
Mother...

420
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:21,300
It is my fault...

421
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,040
No.

422
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,140
I am to blame...

423
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:46,870
Her Majesty appears to be accepting it with composure.

424
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:51,720
Shall I send word that you will go to the Queen's palace?

425
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,280
No, it is all right.

426
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:45,260
I heard there is no one starving to death, even during the barley hardships.

427
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:53,630
There is also no one whose grain or wealth has been taken by corrupt officials.

428
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:56,160
Ever since His Majesty ascended to the throne, the world has definitely changed.

429
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,070
the world has definitely changed.

430
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:38,650
You should have made your presence known, Chungnyeong.

431
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:43,800
[Yi Do: Grand Prince Changnyeong, later becomes Se Jong]
I was afraid of breaking your momentum while you were training, so I waited quietly.

432
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,810
Seeing your swordsmanship,

433
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:49,940
I felt that it was a shame that you were a woman.

434
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:52,910
This is a matter of training one's mind and body.

435
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:55,430
What does it matter if I am a man or a woman?

436
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:59,230
I wondered if you may have faced regrettable situations because you are a woman.

437
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:01,690
It is not because I am a woman.

438
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,200
But I have faced regrettable situations.

439
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:09,150
Let us go.

440
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:21,970
[Yi Je: Grand Prince Yangnyeong]

441
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:25,880
This is the mindset of a monarch.

442
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:37,660
Focus solely on the target.

443
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:39,660
Once you have set your goal,

444
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:42,130
do not waver for anything.

445
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:46,320
A bullseye.

446
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:51,380
You take after Taesangwang.

447
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:54,240
I will strive even harder from now on.

448
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:57,020
Your archery skills are good enough.

449
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:59,530
Now, you should strive harder in your studies.

450
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:01,080
Yes, Father.

451
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,800
I sowed to the best I could.

452
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:07,290
You need to do the job of blossoming.

453
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,090
Yes.

454
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:11,800
Now, that is the only thing left for me.

455
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:16,980
A bullseye.

456
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:23,300
I will make you do so at all costs.

457
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:44,120
The sunlight feels too nice for you to only live buried in books.

458
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:48,120
I love reading in such sunlight.

459
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,160
There are so many good things in the world,

460
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,150
so why do you love reading so much?

461
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,590
Discovery of Yeonghwaji.

462
00:43:58,590 --> 00:44:01,590
Reading is like blossoming

463
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:05,650
what is splendidly hidden inside a flower bud.

464
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:08,830
Have you read the Commentary on The Great Learning?

465
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:10,030
Yes.

466
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:14,270
The Commentary on The Great Learning is a study of the way of kings about royal governance.

467
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:18,300
[Yeosangun Min Mu Hyul, Yeowongun Min Mu Hoe: Younger brothers of Queen Won Gyeong]

468
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,100
I hear you read it multiple times.

469
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:21,970
How many times have you read it?

470
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:23,890
I am embarrassed to say,

471
00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:26,180
but I read it five times.

472
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,330
The Crown Prince took six years to read it once and learn it.

473
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:36,440
And the King held a feast to celebrate.

474
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:40,650
I merely only read it. I have not fully grasped its meaning.

475
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:45,080
This is precisely why people say you were born with the qualities of a monarch.

476
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,490
That is true.

477
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:48,290
Yeowongun.

478
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,930
I spoke without thinking.

479
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:54,700
I am sorry.

480
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,930
Your Majesty,

481
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:01,860
the King made me the Governor of Hanseongbu,

482
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:05,230
and made Hyungnim the head of the Royal Family Affairs Bureau.

483
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:11,540
I believe he wishes to show love to our Min family again as he once did before.

484
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:15,150
He is only trying to balance the powers in the court.

485
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:19,530
So, practice self-discipline and refrain from reckless behavior.

486
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:22,020
<i>Yes.</i>

487
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,750
By the way, the Crown Prince...

488
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:29,060
What about the Crown Prince?

489
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:32,010
Since we are here, we should say hello.

490
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:35,720
I heard that you two uncles received important positions in the court.

491
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:40,070
Yes, we should now revive our fallen family.

492
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:43,560
Revive your fallen family?

493
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:51,210
But seeing you so strong and dignified like this makes me so happy.

494
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:53,730
I feel so reassured.

495
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:58,080
If only our late elder brothers had seen this, how happy they would have been.

496
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,160
A fallen family,

497
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,990
and my late uncles...

498
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:03,760
Please stop speaking of such things now.

499
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,010
Your Highness.

500
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:06,280
It makes me uncomfortable.

501
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,240
Uncomfortable?

502
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,270
How could you say such an upsetting thing?

503
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:13,250
Your Highness grew up in our Min family.

504
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:16,960
Even if nobody else knows, you should know this, Crown Prince.

505
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,680
Our hyungnims died without fault.

506
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,490
Then,

507
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:26,520
are you saying my father killed those two uncles when they were innocent?

508
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:30,920
How did you become my father's subjects while thinking that way?

509
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:34,980
I will be going first.

510
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:45,530
Your Highness! Your Highness!

511
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,940
Yeoseonggun made a mistake, so please forget about it.

512
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:55,010
Do you think I feel at ease about this?

513
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:57,710
Then, you just have to not forget it.

514
00:46:57,710 --> 00:47:02,210
All you have to do is remember that they died unjustly.

515
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:03,690
Died unjustly?

516
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:06,870
- Your Highness!
- Do you not know the true reason

517
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:08,590
why they died?

518
00:47:08,590 --> 00:47:10,930
They plotted treason!

519
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:16,430
My hyungnims sacrificed everything to help the King ascend to the throne.

520
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:18,330
Yet, he only used them and killed them!

521
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:20,090
Uncle!

522
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:23,000
I am the son of the monarch! I am the Crown Prince!

523
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,480
They were treasonous traitors who deserved to die a thousand times over-

524
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:30,850
Watch your mouth.

525
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:33,990
If you ever insult my hyungnims again,

526
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:37,960
I will not hold back then.

527
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:56,640
Yeowongun did that to the Crown Prince?

528
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:02,120
This happened after His Highness argued with Yeosangun and stormed off.

529
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:06,160
If the Crown Prince is thought so lightly of,

530
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:11,370
what will change even after he becomes the monarch?

531
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:13,980
Will you just leave things be?

532
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:21,400
Did anyone else besides you see this?

533
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,790
This happened so quickly, so...

534
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:27,110
Then, I will just let this pass for now.

535
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:30,630
A Crown Prince who is scorned by his uncles...

536
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:34,030
What more could he be than a laughingstock to his subjects?

537
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:42,430
I must obtain a black horn bow.

538
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:43,400
Pardon?

539
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:46,400
I must obtain Joseon's finest black horn bow so I can shoot down

540
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,240
all these ruthless men and protect myself.

541
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:53,300
Your Highness, those who once offered up bows to you have been exiled.

542
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:54,850
So where would we obtain this?

543
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:57,300
Regardless, I must obtain it!

544
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:01,490
<i>Her Majesty is here.</i>

545
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,790
You have done well.

546
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:08,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

547
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:14,580
As you well know,

548
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:19,660
the King also learned the way of kings through this Commentary on the Great Learning.

549
00:49:21,010 --> 00:49:22,940
Mother.

550
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:28,510
Is something the matter?

551
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:31,120
No.

552
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,630
Gyeokmulchiji
[Gyeokmulchiji: To deeply study the principles of things to attain complete knowledge]

553
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:38,240
It is written on the folding screen, which I have inscribed as well.

554
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:41,860
Do not read it carelessly, but think deeply and critically about it.

555
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:45,660
Only then can you become a great monarch.

556
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:48,080
Yes.

557
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:53,770
Also, this is a letter Pan Su left me five years ago.

558
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:58,100
<i>Musician Yi Oh Bang from the Royal Music Bureau</i>

559
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:00,840
<i>and Gu Jong Su from the Sungeumsa are surrounding the Crown Prince.</i>

560
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:05,990
<i>It appears the Crown Prince often leaves the palace to hang out with them.</i>

561
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:09,940
<i>What they seek is to each attain a major position</i>

562
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:12,820
<i>after His Highness inherits the throne.</i>

563
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:19,350
<i>Also, there are rumors that Yi Suk Beon is trying to stay close to Gu Jong Su's brothers.</i>

564
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:21,880
<i>But I was not able to confirm this.</i>

565
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:24,830
In that letter is written what you received from whom

566
00:50:24,830 --> 00:50:27,660
and how you spent your time outside the palace.

567
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:31,750
At that time, I considered ordering an Office of the Inspector General inspector to investigate.

568
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:35,530
But due to the unrest within the palace caused by your uncles,

569
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:37,970
I settled the matter by punishing only a few people.

570
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:42,750
Mother! This is not what I need to become a monarch.

571
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:43,950
What do you mean?

572
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:46,280
What I need is power.

573
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:50,380
It is the determination to move forward without wavering after setting a goal.

574
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:51,930
At times, it is ruthlessness.

575
00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:54,270
Power, determination,

576
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:56,330
and ruthlessness at times...

577
00:50:56,330 --> 00:51:00,330
Is that your idea of a monarch?

578
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,870
I trust you, Crown Prince.

579
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:15,410
Yes, Mother.

580
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,890
Head inside.

581
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:31,100
I think it is best you do not try to obtain a black horn bow.

582
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:34,050
- Why not?
- Her Majesty will be watching.

583
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:35,580
I must obtain it.

584
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:37,350
No matter what!

585
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:43,410
Then, if we look into it through Gu Jong Su,

586
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:46,010
we may be able to find one.

587
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:50,070
Gu Jong Su, who was exiled for drinking with me

588
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:52,170
outside the palace?

589
00:51:52,170 --> 00:51:53,910
Yes, Your Highness.

590
00:51:54,910 --> 00:51:56,570
Make sure to obtain one.

591
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:24,760
Oh, you are here!

592
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:27,970
Gosh, you must be tired since it is so hot. Give it to me.

593
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:33,320
Aigoo, I wonder what medicinal herbs you brought today.

594
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:35,890
Between the Hours of Dragon and Horse, place it at the eastern edge of the eaves.

595
00:52:35,890 --> 00:52:38,580
Between the Hours of Sheep and Monkey, place it at the western edge.

596
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:39,770
That is the wind path.

597
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:41,380
Yes. Aigoo.

598
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:43,800
You must be thirsty. Aigoo...

599
00:52:44,850 --> 00:52:48,470
Take one long sip.

600
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:50,250
Thanks.

601
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:54,180
Let me see, let me see.

602
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:58,560
Wow, it is golden and silver honeysuckle!

603
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:01,590
Oh, my, there is even a field marigold!

604
00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:04,590
Wow, so pretty, so pretty.

605
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:07,400
Whoa, what kind of herb is this?

606
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:10,150
Let me stay by Your Majesty's side.

607
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:14,020
Then, I will accept any punishment you give me.

608
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:16,640
I have done wrong, Your Majesty.

609
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,430
Your Majesty!

610
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:23,470
<i>Royal Consort Sukeui, obey the Queen's orders.</i>

611
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:28,090
Your Majesty!

612
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,650
What are you all doing?

613
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:34,880
Wait!

614
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,280
It is so good to come here with you.

615
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:29,690
Mother.

616
00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:34,360
Is not Hanyang so vast?

617
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:38,770
I cannot see where its end lies.

618
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:46,220
<i>Young Master, is not Gaegyeong quite small?</i>

619
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:49,840
Did you say it is vast?

620
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:54,530
- Yes.
- Why do you say that it is vast?

621
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:58,960
Because it is filled with people.

622
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,210
People who farm the land,

623
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:03,600
people who raise livestock,

624
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,510
people who starve,

625
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:07,800
people who are suffering from illness,

626
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,840
people who laugh,

627
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,490
and people who mourn.

628
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,480
I see...

629
00:55:22,350 --> 00:55:25,160
you want to become a monarch.
