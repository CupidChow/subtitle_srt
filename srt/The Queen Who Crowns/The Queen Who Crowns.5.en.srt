[The Queen Who Crowns]

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,660
[This drama is a fictional story based on historical figures and events and may differ from actual historical records.]

00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:42,950
[Filming of animals or child actors followed production guidelines.]

5
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,050
In the end,

6
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,710
you must have Yeong Sil killed?

7
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:10,120
In the end, this is the only way to save you.

8
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,750
Your Majesty...

9
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:14,140
You will not die from this,

10
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,800
but you must live as though you are dead.

11
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,500
Your Majesty...

12
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,790
Your Majesty.

13
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,930
Look, is anyone outside?

14
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,560
Your Majesty!

15
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,130
- Notify the royal pharmacy!
- Yes.

16
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:44,920
My Lady!

17
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,880
Your Majesty.

18
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,240
She will not die.

19
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,200
She is already dead to me now.

20
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,000
You will not die,

21
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,510
however, you will not be able to conceive.

22
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,680
Thank you for your hard work.

23
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,310
What did you say? She will not be able to conceive?

24
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:17,940
Yes.

25
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,330
Bearing children is not the only duty of a concubine.

26
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:48,600
Why are you doing this when you wanted to kill me?

27
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,100
Seeing you lying here like this

28
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:56,070
makes me wonder if you were worth killing with my hands.

29
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,010
Please leave.

30
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:03,180
You tried to find your value in one man.

31
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,820
That is why you ended up like this.

32
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,760
Go away!

33
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,500
Please!

34
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,720
Even now, you should find your own reason for living.

35
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,690
If you do, I will help you.

36
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:17,180
How!

37
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,980
I'm a concubine who cannot even bear children!

38
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:30,090
Do not forget that you are the only one who can save yourself.

39
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,880
<i>Attendant Lady is here.</i>

40
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,910
What about His Majesty?

41
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,610
He is taking a bath.

42
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:07,050
Finally, the war between His and Her Majesty has begun.

43
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:11,200
That is how I read this situation.

44
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,640
You read it well.

45
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:17,910
But I wonder why they are taking it that far.

46
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,780
In order to create Joseon for the people,

47
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,000
he must strip the powerful ministers of their influence.

48
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,250
That is what His Majesty seems to have determined.

49
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:33,450
And who is at the center of the powerful ministers?

50
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:37,930
Is it not Her Majesty and her family?

51
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:55,050
Right now, His Majesty does not have Her Majesty nor Princess Hyosun by his side.

52
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,680
He has nobody beside him.

53
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,060
Yes.

54
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,990
[Episode 5]

55
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:36,860
Your Majesty, is not Her Majesty too much?

56
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,740
If she had stepped in, Your Majesty would not have had to do that to the Princess-

57
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,370
Stop!

58
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:47,430
Do not talk rashly about the Queen like that.

59
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,170
Yes, Sire.

60
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,840
My apologies, Your Majesty.

61
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:02,660
Your Majesty!

62
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,960
If Your Majesty steps in, it may cause more problems.

63
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,700
Have you not come out of the palace in secret?

64
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,620
But whose farmland is so expansive like this?

65
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,770
This belongs to Yeoganggun and Yeoseonggun.

66
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,860
When Sangwang decided to move the capital back to Gaegyeong,

67
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,340
some powerful ministers rushed to buy land from farmers

68
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,090
at a very low price.

69
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:31,370
That is when they bought it.

70
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,720
Did you hear?

71
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,940
The King tried to kill Yeong Sil in front of Her Majesty-

72
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:44,110
He did not try to kill her. He did that to save her.

73
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,510
What do you mean?

74
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:50,920
Even still, Yeong Sil was destined to die anyway.

75
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,080
Yeong Sil was working with forces trying to restore Sangwang to the throne.

76
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:00,250
Only the Queen was able to shield and save Yeong Sil,

77
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,870
but the Queen would not act.

78
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,990
So, the King did that to save Young Sil...

79
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:11,460
In the end, only the Queen was put into a difficult situation.

80
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,780
It is probably Kwon Hong's daughter.

81
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,160
The one who is playing the geomungo*?
(Korean musical instrument)

82
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,380
Yes.

83
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,690
Kwon Hong is a music researcher at Sungkyunkwan.

84
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,590
Your Majesty.
[Kwon Hong: Music Researcher of Sungkyunkwan]

85
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:13,860
Hyungnim, you said the chrysanthemum wine you preserved last fall has aged well, right?

86
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,620
Yes, that is so.

87
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,760
He suddenly notified me.

88
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,640
Please come this way.

89
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,700
[Kwon Seon]

90
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,310
Your Majesty.

91
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:25,690
How about you bring that girl to the palace and find comfort in her when you feel down?

92
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:28,030
You mean to take her as my concubine?

93
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,480
Yes.

94
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:37,330
She is a precious daughter of a noble family. How could I?

95
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:41,510
Thus, you should prepare properly and receive her.

96
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:45,070
Properly, by setting up a Ministry of Royal Weddings.

97
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:56,110
You saw the land that the Min brothers bought, right?

98
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:59,230
Who do you think they rely on to be so bold like that?

99
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:05,100
There is nobody like a powerful concubine to keep the Queen in check.

100
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,670
I hear powerful ministers, including my brothers-in-law,

101
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:28,670
bought land before Gaegyeong became the capital once again.

102
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,580
How many ministers have done this?

103
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,670
Probably many

104
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,710
since they have money and information.

105
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:38,250
Did you do so as well?

106
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,440
I, too, enjoy a few minor privileges that power guarantees.

107
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:50,260
However, I am confident that it will not hinder the reforms Your Majesty envisions.

108
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:59,200
Privileges that power guarantees...

109
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:12,850
Right.

110
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,930
I am thinking of taking Kwon Hong's daughter as my concubine.

111
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,810
- Your Majesty.
- If it is to weaken the power of the Min family,

112
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:24,910
I can partner with anyone.

113
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,870
You should lead the Ministry of Royal Weddings.

114
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:34,780
Your Majesty, Yeoheung Buwongun Min Je is my friend!

115
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,440
That is why...

116
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,640
I am asking you to lead it.

117
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,930
Is anyone outside?

118
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,710
<i>Yes.</i>

119
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:54,530
Raise me up.

120
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,970
- My Lady...
- Right now!

121
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,600
Where is His Majesty sleeping tonight?

122
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,800
I hear he is going to Favored Court Lady's quarters.

123
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:19,520
Carry me on your back, Court Lady.

124
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,020
- My Lady...
- I said, carry me on your back!

125
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,780
He would not abandon me like this!

126
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:46,740
You said to live as though I am dead, right?

127
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:53,190
But I cannot live like that.

128
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:59,220
No matter how much I think about it, I cannot live like that.

129
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:05,460
Did you not love me?

130
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,160
Did you not say...

131
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:12,580
that you were comforted the most by me?

132
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,420
Take her away.

133
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,910
Your Majesty...

134
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,760
Your Majesty!

135
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:24,740
Your Majesty!

136
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,300
Your Majesty!

137
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,350
Your Majesty...

138
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,350
Are you worried about your mother?

139
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,160
[Yi Bi, Prince Gyeongnyeong (Princess Hyosun's son)]

140
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:05,920
I will take extra good care of her.

141
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,940
So, do not worry too much.

142
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,490
Yes.

143
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,820
Je.
[Yi Je, Grand Prince Yangnyeong]

144
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,120
Yes.

145
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,380
Bo.
[Yi Bo, Grand Prince Hyoryeong]

146
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,480
Yes.

147
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,610
Do.
[Yi Do, Grand Prince Chungnyeong]

148
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:20,790
Yes.

149
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:25,870
Take good care of Bi and love him.

150
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:30,870
You are all brothers.

151
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:33,810
<i>Yes, Mother.</i>

152
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,120
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

153
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,040
Your Majesty.

154
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,640
What did you say?

155
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,080
It has not been long since he took in Yeong Sil.

156
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,100
How could he take another concubine? How could he!

157
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:57,850
Not only that, but they are also setting up the Ministry of Royal Weddings since she is Kwon Hong's daughter.

158
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,660
M-Ministry of Royal Weddings...

159
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:05,200
It is clear the King was swayed by Suk Beon, who is out to torture Her Majesty!

160
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:19,660
I will set up the Ministry of Royal Weddings and take Kwon Hong's daughter as my concubine.

161
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,160
Pardon?

162
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,880
Your Majesty, how could you take in a concubine?

163
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,470
The King, who is the master of the nation, is taking a woman for himself.

164
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,680
We just need to accept it dutifully as his subjects.

165
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,290
He is not just taking her. He is setting up the Ministry of Royal Weddings for it!

166
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:37,160
He is taking a daughter of a noble family's daughter as a concubine.

167
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,220
We should observe proper etiquette for her.

168
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:42,070
Pressing state affairs are piled up like a mountain!

169
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:46,030
Making sure the King has many descendants is also an important state affair.

170
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,860
Your Majesty!

171
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,880
Your M-

172
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,130
There is no need. I will wait.

173
00:17:56,130 --> 00:18:01,060
I hear you recently brought His Majesty to Kwon Hong's house, Anseonggun.

174
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,280
How did you know?

175
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,280
Did you think there are secrets in this world?

176
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:10,010
Yeoseonggun must believe it is his duty to look into everything His Majesty does.

177
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,600
Do not sow discord between us!

178
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,190
What do you mean, sow discord!

179
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:18,240
Do not sow discord between His Majesty and the Min family!

180
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,600
What are you all doing in front of His Majesty!

181
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,860
Your Majesty.

182
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,720
Keep going.

183
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,540
Your Majesty, Anseonggun is jealous of the relationship between Your Majesty and us

184
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,560
and is using Kwon Hong's daughter to divide us-

185
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,830
Do you think Her Majesty brings comfort to His Majesty?

186
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,310
You!

187
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,200
A woman should provide relief for the King.

188
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,320
You!

189
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,840
You!

190
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,870
Let him know.

191
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:50,270
Your Majesty, Her Majesty is here.

192
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,460
I will set up the Ministry of Royal Weddings and take a concubine.

193
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:22,170
Since it also concerns palace ladies, help with the palace rituals-

194
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,150
No, you must not.

195
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,150
- I must not?
- If you set up Ministry of Royal Weddings

196
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:30,230
and hold a grand royal wedding,

197
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:34,570
the people will think Your Majesty is taking a new queen.

198
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:36,890
That is a big leap and a victim mentality.

199
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:41,050
If the new concubine gains your favor and bears a son,

200
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:46,470
how would I know if the bloodshed Your Majesty experienced will not happen again?

201
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,580
Are you doubting my heart for you?

202
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,800
Yes. I do now.

203
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,740
- Queen.
- My children.

204
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,550
- Queen!
- Our Je.

205
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,890
Our Bo. Our Do!

206
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:59,560
I must protect the positions of these boys.

207
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,350
They are all my sons as well!

208
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:03,210
If you still insist on this,

209
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:07,430
I will die before you.

210
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,170
What did you say?

211
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:15,390
If there is nothing more to say to me, I will go to my family's house.

212
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:17,490
I do not give you permission.

213
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,470
Every single time!

214
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:23,130
If you refuse to obey me every single time like this,

215
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:26,400
you will lose my love in the end.

216
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:34,180
Losing your love does not mean I should lose myself.

217
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,670
In the Joseon I build,

218
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,520
please live as a Joseon woman.

219
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,780
I would rather...

220
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:46,840
die as a Goryeo woman.

221
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,230
How could she be so relaxed like that?

222
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,710
The woman coming as a concubine...

223
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,710
I hear she is good at playing geomungo.

224
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:24,650
Yes, it appears it is from her father's influence.

225
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:30,530
While the King lived at his previous residence,

226
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:34,450
he often called in musicians and enjoyed music.

227
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:40,210
Whenever I watched His Majesty lost in the music from afar,

228
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:45,740
I wished I could be that geomungo.

229
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,010
Kwon Hong's daughter...

230
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:51,040
What is her weakness?

231
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,700
I do not know.

232
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:58,620
She grew up in a wealthy family without lacking much, so there is nothing much.

233
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:06,280
Then I know very well the weakness of people like that.

234
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,770
What do you mean by people like that?

235
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:10,190
People who are always at the center of attention.

236
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:13,690
People who are complimented for just smiling.

237
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:16,390
People like that.

238
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:22,440
Now, I will exploit that weakness.

239
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,030
Are you...

240
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,670
all right?

241
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:15,390
I will only look forward.

242
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,310
Your Majesty.

243
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,570
Father.

244
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:36,790
You must be tired from your journey here.

245
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,640
Please come inside.

246
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,630
Mother.

247
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,380
What brings you here?

248
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,680
You have been well, right?

249
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,780
His Majesty is here.

250
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:30,220
It is a wine made with ginseng and Siberian ginseng.

251
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:35,260
It will soothe your body and heart with warmth.

252
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,890
I want to...

253
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,560
bear you a prince.

254
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:27,500
I must bear a prince.

255
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:32,150
I will not allow a woman into my heart anymore.

256
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:33,740
I already...

257
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:37,500
know that.

258
00:26:55,490 --> 00:27:00,520
I hear the Ministry of Royal Weddings already sent a dowry to Kwon Hong's house.

259
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,460
The King is not in his right mind!

260
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:06,420
The one who protected His Majesty from Taesangwang's iron mace at Hoeamsa

261
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:10,010
and the one who saved His Majesty from the danger of losing his throne to Sangwang

262
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:12,130
was Your Majesty.

263
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:15,530
So, how could he betray you like this?

264
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:20,080
The King is setting up the Ministry of Royal Weddings and taking in Lady Kwon

265
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,430
to use her family's power to put down the Min family.

266
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:27,930
Not only that, His Excellency Ha Ryun is leading the Ministry of Royal Weddings.

267
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:30,280
And with regard to the concubine,

268
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,270
this is completely different from how he tried to torture

269
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:35,700
Your Majesty with Yeong Sil and Chae Ryeong!

270
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:39,710
Are you confident you can replace the king?

271
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,930
Your Majesty.

272
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:47,590
If you are not confident, then keep your mouth shut.

273
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:56,360
His Majesty will take Sungkyunkwan Music Researcher

274
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,270
Kwon Hong's daughter as a concubine.

275
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:04,520
His subjects should respectfully and wholeheartedly partake in this wedding ceremony.

276
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,710
The Queen's palace is empty right now.

277
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:45,000
The former Queen Consort was unable to bear me a son,

278
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,700
but we still get along because of our past affection.

279
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,940
And the Queen bore you three sons already.

280
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:55,480
What makes you so unhappy about her?

281
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:05,450
Taesangwang said there will never be reforms for the people

282
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:09,180
without cutting off powerful ministers.

283
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:14,820
But the Queen's family is at the center of powerful ministers.

284
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:21,360
So, you want to dilute the power of the Queen by taking more concubines...

285
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:28,040
I do not know.

286
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:35,250
From the start, you did not have it in your heart to cut off the Queen.

287
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:40,800
So, regardless of whether you take in more concubines, nothing will change.

288
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:58,020
I feel that you are leaving your post for too long.

289
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,780
You do not need to worry.

290
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:28,400
Prince of Yan, Zhu Di, has seized the throne of the Ming empire.

291
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:33,120
- What about Yunwen?
- When Zhu Di's elite forces entered Nanjing,

292
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,090
Yunwen was already gone.

293
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:39,110
There is also a rumor that

294
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:43,650
he was brutally killed while hiding from them in the city.

295
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:45,800
So...

296
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:51,090
why are you watching my reaction as you report this fact?

297
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,870
I apologize.

298
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:59,410
Then, we should receive a new proclamation and seal from Zhu Di

299
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:02,780
and discuss our tribute in earnest.

300
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:05,350
We should prepare the tribute with the proper formalities of a tributary relationship,

301
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:09,430
but we should determine the return gifts for the tribute.

302
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:14,080
A tributary relationship is where a small nation offers tribute to a great nation to show respect.

303
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:19,640
Thus, it is not proper for us to determine the return gift for the tribute.

304
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,470
Do you know the origins of the tributary relationship?

305
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,900
It dates back to the Yin and Zhou dynasties.

306
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:30,790
The Yin and Zhou dynasties received tribute from neighboring states to avoid further wars.

307
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,860
Smaller states would send tribute,

308
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:35,420
and the larger states would offer return gifts,

309
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,400
essentially forming a system of trade.

310
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,200
The purpose was to establish peace through these exchanges.

311
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:45,990
So, why do you only think so abjectly and hastily to offer tribute?

312
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:56,320
If you attack your subjects so vehemently for not knowing something,

313
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,030
resentment toward the king will build up in their hearts.

314
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,650
I think it is best that we bring Her Majesty back.

315
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,340
Why are you suddenly bringing up the Queen?

316
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:11,880
I say this because you seem anxious.

317
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,280
She left on her own because she did not like me.

318
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,190
Your Majesty.

319
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:21,190
How are you unable to read your own feelings, Your Majesty?

320
00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:02,740
<i>How are you unable to read your own feelings, Your Majesty?</i>

321
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:20,150
♫ <i>Cold and barren</i> ♫

322
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:22,500
<i>I am afraid.</i>

323
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,920
<i>Do not be afraid.</i>

324
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:29,210
<i>The history stands with us tonight.</i>

325
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:37,400
Prepare the horse!

326
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:54,080
♫ <i>Brushing against my skin</i> ♫

327
00:34:54,080 --> 00:35:05,740
♫ <i>Please grant even my small wish</i> ♫

328
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,370
Open the door!

329
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:09,290
Open the door!

330
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:15,770
♫ <i>Please grant it</i> ♫

331
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:22,660
♫ <i>Please grant it</i> ♫

332
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:25,170
His Majesty is here!

333
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,560
- The King is here?
- Yes.

334
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,380
Where is he right now?

335
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,000
He entered the annex.

336
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,100
He said he would meet with you another time.

337
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:37,130
So, he said not to cause much commotion today.

338
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,390
Queen!

339
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:09,200
<i>Why did you come?</i>

340
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,280
I came because I missed you.

341
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,970
I tried to suppress it,

342
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:19,490
but I just could not suppress it, so I came.

343
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:26,050
<i>Please dismantle the Ministry of Royal Weddings.</i>

344
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,650
I said I came because I missed you!

345
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:31,570
Your Majesty is the one who turned our relationship like this.

346
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,380
Fine.

347
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,640
I hear Her Majesty has returned.

348
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,880
His Majesty personally brought her back early this morning.

349
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,750
Your Majesty.

350
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,520
I have something to say to Anseonggun.

351
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,920
Yes.

352
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:46,010
Why did you do something that would cause you so much anxiety?

353
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:49,110
Something that would cause anxiety?

354
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:53,550
You took a stand against me.

355
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:58,890
You put in so much effort, so I will turn a blind eye regarding the concubine.

356
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:04,400
However, do not expect anything more than that.

357
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,000
Should you not enjoy what trivial power you have?

358
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:25,290
Your Excellency, what do you mean the Ministry of Royal Weddings is being dismantled?

359
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:27,940
Look, we have no choice.

360
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:30,530
At the Queen's sincere plea, the King relented.

361
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:32,770
This is a plot of the Min family.

362
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:35,150
A-And it is an insult to our family!

363
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:38,120
Come now, how could you speak like that?

364
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,970
- Then, this should have never-
- If she bears him a prince,

365
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:42,970
things would be very different.

366
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:46,320
Is she not the only concubine from a noble family?

367
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:37,960
Can you hear me?

368
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:43,960
I am sorry to send you off in such a lowly manner

369
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,630
when you are marrying the King.

370
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:51,710
His Majesty's current concubine comes from a lowly background.

371
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:54,110
Do not forget that fact.

372
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:58,170
Let us go.

373
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:18,400
Escort her.

374
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,710
Set it down over here.

375
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:54,850
The wedding vows will take place in three days at the Hour of Sheep.

376
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:59,210
You must be tired from traveling since morning, so please rest early.

377
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:05,120
I was really worried this time.

378
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:10,330
I would never have imagined His Majesty would personally come here

379
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:12,140
to Chudong so late at night.

380
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:15,770
Their relationship is quite amazing.

381
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,640
It is quite a relief.

382
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:25,850
However, this incident clearly shows that His Majesty is trying

383
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:30,670
to use other forces to keep us in check.

384
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:36,590
We should also use this opportunity to show our strength.

385
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:38,550
How?

386
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:40,880
We will host a banquet.

387
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,330
A banquet?

388
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:46,480
We will invite His Majesty to our home and hold a banquet.

389
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,330
Invite all the meritorious subjects as well,

390
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:50,970
including His Excellency Ha Ryun, too.

391
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:55,850
That is a good idea.

392
00:41:55,850 --> 00:42:00,130
We will be able to show off our strengths properly.

393
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:05,770
But will the King agree to do so that easily?

394
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:09,910
On the night the King took the Queen with him,

395
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:12,630
we were unable to serve him anything.

396
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:18,040
If I personally ask him with that as an excuse, he will not be able to say no.

397
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:24,630
We should invite Yi Suk Beon as well

398
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:27,630
and break his spirit for good.

399
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:55,690
This is silk from Ming.

400
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:59,000
I hope this pleases you, Your Majesty.

401
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,980
I am the one who opposed installing the Ministry of Royal Weddings.

402
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:07,500
You probably resent me for it, but somehow, you are still smiling.

403
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:13,120
The only thing I can say to you is this.

404
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:17,670
Do not hang everything you have on the King's affection.

405
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:19,980
Pardon?

406
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:22,610
What I am saying is

407
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:28,320
find your own reason to live in this palace apart from the King's affection.

408
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:35,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

409
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:00,090
Here it is.

410
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:06,150
It has already been several days since the wedding vows.

411
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:10,710
Should you not go today to greet her?

412
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:16,670
It will not be beneficial to you to go too late, My Lady.

413
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:29,260
The carp are so cute.

414
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:31,670
Yes, you are right, My Lady.

415
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,620
My Lady.

416
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:47,150
Look.

417
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:50,380
Look!

418
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,750
So, it is you.

419
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:02,120
Why have you not come to greet me?

420
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:06,940
I asked you a question!

421
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:11,800
I could not decide how I should treat you.

422
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,710
What do you mean by how to treat me?

423
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:16,690
How rude!

424
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:21,200
Why are you laughing?

425
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:26,120
I thought for a moment about how I would get to say

426
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:30,850
"How rude!" to you one day, Princess.

427
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,680
Do you want to die?

428
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:40,470
Of course not.

429
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:46,530
From now on, there is only one

430
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:51,290
who will decide the hierarchy between us. His Majesty.

431
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:55,580
Are you confident?

432
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,900
I am...

433
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:00,770
confident.

434
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:12,060
Your Majesty!

435
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:42,460
You are quite arrogant and bold.

436
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:45,730
Your Majesty.

437
00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:52,300
Were you saying you are confident you can win my heart?

438
00:46:54,610 --> 00:47:00,510
I know very well that no one apart from Her Majesty can have your heart.

439
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:03,550
Then?

440
00:47:08,590 --> 00:47:11,180
What were you saying you were confident in?

441
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:15,730
I asked what you were confident in.

442
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:18,470
Though I cannot win your heart,

443
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:21,140
Though you cannot win my heart...

444
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:28,320
I believe I am useful to Your Majesty.

445
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,320
That is why...

446
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,210
I said I was confident.

447
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:35,320
That is all.

448
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:39,360
You say you are useful?

449
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:50,620
His Majesty saw the Favored Court Lady insult his consort.

450
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:54,230
Even if His Majesty scolds you for the palace ladies' lack of discipline,

451
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:56,020
there is nothing you can say.

452
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:59,780
You should summon the Favored Court Lady and reprimand her.

453
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:04,200
That way, you can uphold your dignity as Queen.

454
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:07,520
With such a narrow-minded response,

455
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,190
how will that uphold my dignity as Queen?

456
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:14,140
- Your Majesty.
- Where is the Favored Court Lady right now?

457
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:29,150
I received His Majesty's favor first.

458
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:33,220
Will you be able to handle Her Majesty's wrath?

459
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:38,190
Did you forget who ultimately made Princess Hyosun like that?

460
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:47,020
<i>If the Queen hits you with a rod,</i>

461
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:49,450
<i>make sure to accept it obediently,</i>

462
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:53,330
<i>so people will at least look at you with sympathy.</i>

463
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:57,420
Your Majesty, the Favored Court Lady is here.

464
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:04,660
Your Majesty.

465
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:06,630
Come here and sit down.

466
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:12,530
Are you not sick of drinking tea all the time?

467
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:19,550
Will you have a drink?

468
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:23,410
No, Your Majesty.

469
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:33,900
Your Majesty.

470
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:38,630
Just hit me with a rod instead.

471
00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:40,400
Why?

472
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:45,070
I did not show proper respect to Princess Jeongui.

473
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:49,950
This is a difficult situation for me as well.

474
00:49:49,950 --> 00:49:52,260
How could I blame you?

475
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:05,090
In a few days, I will go to my family home in Chudong with His Majesty.

476
00:50:05,090 --> 00:50:08,860
I will go ahead first to prepare.

477
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:20,480
Then, allow me to escort you there.

478
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:28,470
Chae Ryeong.

479
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,280
Yes.

480
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:35,750
Do not place yourself on the edge of a cliff.

481
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:48,910
Yes...

482
00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:50,970
Your Majesty.

483
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:02,400
Are the preparations against the rebellion going well?

484
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,170
Yes, we are preparing flawlessly for it on our side.

485
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:09,020
However, Yeoseonggun is currently in Chudong.

486
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:12,730
The Queen also decided to go there early.

487
00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:18,630
The Queen is heading there early?

488
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:27,600
- Summon the Favored Court Lady.
- Yes, Sire.

489
00:51:37,410 --> 00:51:40,070
Things are looking ominous at Dongbukmyeon.

490
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:42,130
By Dongbukmyeon,

491
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:45,800
is it Taesangwang?

492
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:48,010
We do not know where Taesangwang is,

493
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:51,670
but I received information that Dongbukmyeon's Gabyeolcho are on the move.

494
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:55,450
Military weapons are also being drawn in.

495
00:51:55,450 --> 00:51:57,350
Military weapons?

496
00:51:59,310 --> 00:52:00,980
Does the Queen also know about this?

497
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:03,250
Yes, I told her.

498
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:04,900
What did she say?

499
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:09,050
I will need to meet with Pan Su.

500
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:17,190
The King is watching carefully because of what happened last time involving Sangwang.

501
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:20,180
Especially if you are leaving the palace.

502
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:21,730
This is a serious matter.

503
00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:25,630
By Pan Su, are you referring to that blind man?

504
00:52:25,630 --> 00:52:27,570
Yes.

505
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:29,430
When?

506
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:34,070
She said she would come here a few days before the banquet and meet with him.

507
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:36,790
Goodness...

508
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:43,080
Why is she meeting that blind man at this point?

509
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:49,410
There she is.

510
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:03,020
Aigoo, My Lady. Aigoo, My Lady!

511
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:06,450
When you first came, you were such a tiny little kid.

512
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:09,320
- Have you been well?
- Yes.

513
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:28,940
<i>Hello.</i>

514
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:38,190
<i>Who is the one providing information to the Queen?</i>

515
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:18,160
They will raise an army at Dongbukmyeon soon.

516
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,790
And Father will also be with them?

517
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:22,020
Yes.

518
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:26,430
However, Taesangwang's health is not very good.

519
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:30,780
After he demonstrates his strength to the soldiers,

520
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:34,340
he will enter Wonjung Port.

521
00:54:35,270 --> 00:54:37,650
Wonjung Port...

522
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:37,550
I received orders from His Majesty.

523
00:55:37,550 --> 00:55:39,650
Even still,

524
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:45,160
how could you, of all people, spy on Her Majesty, Favored Court Lady?

525
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:51,250
What will you report to him?

526
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:54,060
I did not...

527
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:57,070
see anything noteworthy, so...

528
00:55:57,070 --> 00:55:59,980
You say you did not see anything noteworthy.

529
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:02,990
Yes.

530
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:12,970
Believe me, Your Majesty.

531
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:16,210
You want me to believe you?

532
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:35,410
Your Majesty,

533
00:56:35,410 --> 00:56:39,030
why are you accepting Yeoheung Buwongun's invitation at this point?

534
00:56:40,070 --> 00:56:42,640
I know what you are worrying about.

535
00:56:55,500 --> 00:57:00,650
<i>Since His Majesty is coming, tell Chae Ryeong.</i>

536
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:21,870
Why did you tell me to come here?

537
00:57:22,850 --> 00:57:25,530
I was reminded of the old days.

538
00:57:25,530 --> 00:57:29,890
Did you not used to wash me here?

539
00:57:31,590 --> 00:57:33,380
Enter.

540
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,840
How could I dare to-

541
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:40,750
Then, shall I come out for you instead?

542
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:16,540
<i>Chae Ryeong.</i>

543
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:21,010
<i>Do not place yourself on the edge of a cliff.</i>

<i>The gazes directed at our Min family have grown sharper.</i>

550
00:59:18,490 --> 00:59:20,700
<i>They pay attention to everything about me.</i>

551
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:24,640
<i>They watch closely and wait for the right moment to exploit any weakness.</i>

552
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:29,110
<i>Did you not say that your body may belong to the King, but your heart belongs to me?</i>

553
00:59:29,110 --> 00:59:31,070
<i>How dare you!</i>

554
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:33,720
<i>It is all for Your Majesty.</i>

555
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:35,650
<i>This is a battle you cannot win.</i>

556
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:38,800
<i>Is he not going to battle where people may live or die?</i>

557
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:40,480
<i>Kill him.</i>
