<i>What is it?</i>

22
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:59,030

Arrest him!

32
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:21,690
Perhaps this is the will of the heavens.

33
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,830
Stop!

34
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,680
I said, stop!

35
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,340
Wait. Your Majesty.

36
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,790
Move aside.

37
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,480
Yes.

38
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,950
What do you desire to gain by killing me?

39
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,970
Go back.

40
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,660
Do you hate me so much that you want to kill me?

41
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,570
I said, go back.

42
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:11,010
We should continue your offering of the metal bell.

43
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:13,020
What did you say?

44
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,740
Think of the people.

45
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:20,490
Who will follow a king when his own father wants to kill him so badly?

46
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,280
Did you just say the people?

47
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,870
How dare you.

48
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,740

Try rotating your shoulders.

00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,250
Take the medicine the royal pharmacy gives you.

56
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,220
After a few days, you will get better.

57
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,060
All right.

58
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,890
Are you really all right?

59
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,340
Did not the physician also say so?

60
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,060
It only brushed by me.

61
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:59,410

How did you know?

65
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,680
How did you know there was an iron mace in the metal bell box

66
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,620
and that Father was trying to kill me?

67
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,830
How did you know?

74
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,430
So please tell me the truth.

Hurry up and tell me!

77
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,760
I do not know.

79
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:07,440
Look carefully.

You are next.

81
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,030
Grab his face and make him look.

82
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:22,570
This is impossible without any sympathizing forces.

83

Who are they?

84

[Jo Sa Eui: Queen Shindeok's relative]

Is this the will of Taesangwang?

Yes.

97
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,800
Why?

He said when enough forces are gathered,

they would come down and attack Gaegyeong.

Father, Bang Won is here.

101
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:08,270
You are a king who gets blood on his royal robes, I see.

102
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,460
You cannot go anywhere.

103
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:14,480
I should never have given birth to you.

104
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,220
You are right.

105
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,150
Why did you give birth to me?

106
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,810
Why did you raise me?

107
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:25,760
Why did you have me learn to read and write?

108
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,190
And why were you so proud when I passed the state exam?

109
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,650
How dare you.

110
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:39,230
You made me this way, Father!

111
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:42,700
Your finger always pointed to the top position, Father.

112
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,450
I also lived believing that was best,

113
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:47,380
and that is why I rose to that position.

114
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,260
After all that, why!

115
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,120
Why are you denying me now?

116
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,040
Yes, you are not.

119
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:04,930
You will never be deserving.

121
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,050

122
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,910
make sure to kill you

123
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:19,100
and undo everything that went wrong.

124
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:31,180
You will now have to live only in this palace.

125
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,150
You will not be able to take one step outside of here.

126
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:40,970
In this place, you will see how well

127

the son you did not choose does.

128
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,150
While seeing that,

129
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:52,800

00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:58,990

Your Majesty...

133
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:51,690
The King asked how I knew about the iron mace.

134
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:54,540
What did you tell him?

135
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:58,680
I told him I found out by chance, and he did not ask further.

136
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,460
How about we hand over our intelligence network to him at this time?
[Yeoganggun Min Mu Gu, Younger brother of Queen]

137

00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:13,710
Pan Su* has a nationwide network.
(Male shaman, usually blind)

141
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:18,700
To distinguish allies and foes, we must know who is meeting whom.

142
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:24,060
Is not our intelligence and having the wealth to support it our strength?

143
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:30,990
For now, it may be better for the King not to know about this.

144
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,990
You are right.

145
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:36,690
I do not think now is the time yet.

146
00:12:54,540 --> 00:13:00,870
Her Majesty seems like someone who makes you lonely.

147
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,920
I will comfort you.

148
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,740
Yes.

00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,180
I will guard the front.

156
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:43,490
There were certain circumstances,

157
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:47,110
but Taesangwang blessed the future of this nation

158
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:50,670
while offering the metal bell at Hoeamsa.

159
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,120
Yes, Sire.

160
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,290
- Minister of Justice.
- Yes.

161
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:57,540
There is a rumor about a disgraceful incident at Hoeamsa.

162
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,680
Find out who is spreading this rumor and punish them severely to prevent future rumors.

163
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,890
Yes, Your Majesty.

Secretary of Royal Orders.

165
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,280
Yes.

166
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,700
Based on strange information, the Queen

167
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:16,140
upset my father, who was trying to offer a metal bell to Buddha

168
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,700
and also ruined a rare chance for reconciliation between father and son.

169
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,660
This is a clear act of filial impiety.

170
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,230
Thus,

171
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:29,040
let us discuss the procedures for deposing the Queen.

172
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,110

<i>I will enter.</i>

175
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:04,370
I am sorry to say this, but His Majesty told the Secretary of Royal Orders

176
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:07,580
to discuss procedures to depose the Queen.

177
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,830
Your Majesty.

178
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:16,580
He is afraid my authority might grow stronger after the recent incident at Hoeamsa,

179
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,230
so he is trying to suppress my influence in advance.

180
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,000
Thus, no need to make a fuss about it.

181
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,800
<i>Your Majesty, Yeoganggun and Yeoseonggun are here.</i>

182
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:33,190
Your Majesty.

183
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,800
Court Lady, what happened? Deposing the queen?

184
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,400
I know.
[Court Lady Seungeun (Favored), Chae Ryeong]

185
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,030
Is someone visiting her?

186
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,960
Yes, her younger brothers.

187
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,900
I will wait here and see her afterward.

188
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:58,170
How could the King mention deposing the Queen unless he has gone mad?

189
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,760
Yeoseonggun, watch your mouth.

190
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,640
Watch my mouth? How could I?

191
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:06,320
If it was not for Your Majesty, the King would have been struck by the iron mace and died!

192
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,550
Yet depose the Queen?

193
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,710
A father tried to kill his son.

194
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:12,100
Should he not stop this news from spreading?

195
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,310
Do you think that is possible?

196
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:17,410
Not only that, why is he deposing the Queen to stop that?

197
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:21,690
To show even if the Queen defies his father's will, she will be cast aside.

198
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:23,950
He probably wanted to emphasize his filial loyalty.

199
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,470
Is it not killing two birds with one stone?

200
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:27,120
Since he needs legitimacy.

201
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,000
How does that make sense?

202
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,800
- After all we did to make him king!
- Stop right there!

203
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,570
I apologize.

204
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,940
But this is what I find strange.

205
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,740
Let us imagine the terrible hypothetical situation

206
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,390
where the King was struck by Taesangwang's iron mace.

207
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:55,200
Then, naturally, my Je would rise to the throne as the eldest prince.

208
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,510
But would Taesangwang

209
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:02,520
have thrown the iron mace to enthrone my Je?

210
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,110
Then what?

211
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,660
Are you saying there are sympathizing forces?

212
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:15,010
There is probably a powerful sympathizing force in the palace.

213
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:18,000
There are Gabyeolcho in the Three Armies as well.

214
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,440
Are you referring to them?

215
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,810
The one who can mobilize the Gabyeolcho.

216
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:25,370
Then you mean...

217
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,660
The Sangwang.

218
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,880
<i>The Sangwang was a fierce general</i>
[Yi Bang Gwa, Sangwang (Yi Bang Won's older brother, Jeongjong)]

219
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,140
<i>who used to fight in wars with Father.</i>

220
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,460
Are there not many former Gabyeolcho

221
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,830
in the Three Armies, who still follow Sangwang?

222
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:55,410
You mean, Sangwang was involved in the Hoeamsa-

223
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:07,610
Is that what you are saying?

224
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,710
It is only my hypothesis.

225
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:13,580
But if you are able to figure this out,

226
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,750
would the King not know this?

227
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:20,640
The King probably does not want to consider such a possibility.

228
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,640
If so, will he not have to raise his sword against another brother?

229
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,610
Your Majesty,

230
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:30,990
now that you mention it, I am reminded of something.

231
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:35,920
Someone is going around meeting individually with former Gabyeolcho in the Three Armies.

232
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:40,180
Supposedly, he has a burn mark on his face.

233
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,700
He is probably Won Beom.
[Won Beom, Yi Seong Gye's right-hand man]

234
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,640
Secretly find out where he is

235
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,950
and find out who he is meeting with.

236
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,440
Your Majesty,

237
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,050
Favored Court Lady is here.

238
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,450
Your Majesty, it is me, Chae Ryeong.

239
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:08,380
I came because I was worried.

240
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:11,330
<i>I will not be deposed from my position,</i>

241
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:13,820
<i>so do not worry and go back.</i>

242
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,240
You should do so.

243
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:20,050
Even when I told her about the potential deposition, she did not bat an eye.

244
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:22,450
Even if that is so,

245
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:25,710
I used to serve Your Majesty.

246
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,330
So I should perform my duties.

247
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:32,670
You must not leave in a rush like this.

248
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,680
Shall I inform His Majesty?

249
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,190
I am on my way to offer prayers for my brothers.

250
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,860
There is no need to inform him.

251
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:42,170
Taesangwang is also waiting for you, Sangwang. If you leave like this...

252
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:44,800
I do not care. Do not come outside.

253
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,280
Even if I serve the King in the future,

254
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,990
that will not be my will.

255
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:10,730
Have I ever blamed you for that?

256
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:14,330
You speak thus,

257
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:17,050
but you still distance yourself from me.

258
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:24,150
Allow me to serve you close by your side as in the past, Your Majesty.

259
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:27,460
You have already received the favor of the King.

260
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,570
You are no longer Main Chamber Maid Chae Ryeong.

261
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,140
Your Majesty.

262
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,850
I am just Chae Ryeong.

263
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:44,210
I am Chae Ryeong who served you a long time at your former residence in Chudong.

264
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:46,360
Though I may give my body to the King,

265
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,730
my heart belongs to Your Majesty.

266
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,380
I have not changed.

267
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,900
You have changed, I see.

268
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,880
The news of His Majesty

269
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,550
ordering to discuss deposing the Queen is widespread in the marketplace.

270
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:38,400
[Princess Hyosun, Yeong Sil]

271
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,620
They say his filial piety is to the point of casting aside his own wife.

272
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:45,970
He will not be casting aside his wife.

273
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,880
I know him very well.

274
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,030
You never know what the future holds.

275
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:55,620
Who would have known you would be lying here today, Princess?

276
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:04,760
I want to erase the Queen from the King's heart,

277
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,040
but I cannot figure out how.

278
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,940
Be patient and wait.

279
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:12,320
While he was Prince Jeongan,

280
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,830
why do you think he sought you out?

281
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:18,770
It is because you were comfortable.

282
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:22,500
Eventually, men cast aside women

283
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,270
who are burdensome.

284
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:29,940
If that happens, that would be good for our baby prince.

285
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:35,660
Well, what happened to the safflower blush we talked about last time?

286
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:38,200
I will soon obtain it.

287
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,760
Goodness, you are so pretty already.

288
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,020
If you put that precious thing on,

289
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:48,080
he will say Yang Guifei has reincarnated.

290
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,140
I want to...

291
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,540
give birth to a prince.

292
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,950
Pardon?

293
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:06,410
I must give birth to a prince.

294
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:08,810
While I am still young and beautiful,

295
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:14,200
I must give birth to a prince over and over again.

296
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,790
Will you help me?

297
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,160
Why are you here?

298
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:31,710
Taesangwang keeps looking for me,

299
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:36,520
and I can tell what Taesangwang will tell me to do if I see him.

300
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:40,340
So I left the palace for a moment.
[Nam Jeong: Yi Bang Gwa's right-hand man]

301
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:47,710
The memorial tablets of those who died for me on the battlefronts are here.

302
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,640
Sangwang.

303
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,030
I thought about

304
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:54,600
what to do if I had to come to

305
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:58,610
Myeongbujeon again
[Myeongbujeon: A temple where you pray for the dead]

306
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:00,590
for the same reason.

307
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,970
Do you not feel it is unfair at all?

308
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:11,350
You lost the kingship to Bang Won.

309
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:17,130
We will help you get it back.

310
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:21,130
Just tell us you want it back.

311
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:25,780
We will prepare everything by ourselves.

312
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,970
Most importantly,

313
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:30,340
that is what Taesangwang wants.

314
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,800
I do not

315
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,310
want any more of you to die.

316
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:38,880
Why do you think we will die?

317
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:43,430
Sangwang.

318
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,620
The sunlight is harsh.

319
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:11,130
If the sunlight is harsh,

320
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:14,350
I should stay in the shade for a while.

321
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:19,570
I am worried that shade will last forever.

322
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:22,670
Are you worried that I will be deposed as Queen?

323
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:25,070
How could you say such a thing?

324
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:27,390
Do not worry so much.

325
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,460
No matter what happens,

326
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:35,230
I must look after the princes.

327
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,080
[Yi Je, Grand Prince Yangnyeong]

328
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,030
[Yi Bo, Grand Prince Hyoryeong]

329
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,890
[Yi Do, Grand Prince Chungnyeong]

330
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,300
[Yi Bi, Prince Jeongnyeong (Prince Hyosun's son)]

331
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:16,210
You have not studied for a long time,

332
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:17,930
but you have improved a lot.

333
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:20,460
Father promised to give me

334
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:24,560
a reward for every book I read.

335
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,860
Is that so?

336
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:29,110
He praises me and gives me snacks.

337
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:32,730
Studying is starting to become more fun.

338
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:35,900
I see. You did well.

339
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,560
She says I did well.

340
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,920
Yes, you did well.

341
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,880
Did Father really give you snacks?

342
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,400
Yeah!

343
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,920
Your Majesty, His Majesty is here.

344
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:13,170
Do not follow me any further. Wait here.

345
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,490
After the incident at Hoeamsa last time,

346
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:43,470
I asked you how you knew there was an iron mace in the box.

347
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:47,690
At the time, you said you found out by chance, Queen.

348
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:49,640
When the private armies were disbanded in the past,

349
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,280
I clearly declared that having private informants was unacceptable.

350
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,080
However,

351
00:29:56,630 --> 00:30:01,760
you hid the fact that you are using private informants, Queen.

352
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,170
Is that why you decided to discuss deposing me as Queen?

353
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,600
It's still the early days of my reign, which is not yet stable.

354
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,200
I cannot openly proclaim that the Queen and her family have defied royal commands.

355
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,740
I was able to protect you from the danger because of that.

356
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,130
You should stop now.

357
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:25,780
From now on, I will face and fix them.

358
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,460
Are you confident that you can distinguish

359
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:34,260
the factions within this court?

360
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:41,500
The stench of blood spilled to establish this nation still lingers in many places.

361
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,420
You have experienced it, so you know.

362
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,430
Those who are loyal to the previous dynasties,

363
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:48,200
those who are loyal to Taesangwang,

364
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,420
and those who are loyal to Sangwang.

365
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:54,620
Are you confident that you have seized control

366
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:57,290
over those who are in hiding?

367
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:02,670
What is it you want to say?

368
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:07,520
Let us imagine the hypothetical terrible situation

369
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,460
that you were hit by Father's iron mace.

370
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,850
- Queen.
- Do you believe

371
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:16,660
Father acted thus without any preparations?

372
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:19,660
Will he not have prepared for the next steps after that?

373
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:22,150
- Queen!
- Sangwang!

374
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:28,690
You probably figured it out already, but you are ignoring it.

375
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:34,970
So, you are saying I should view both my father and hyungnim as enemies?

376
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:38,430
I am saying you should see the reality with a level head.

377
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:41,390
It will not be too late to get rid of my informants

378
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:44,540
after Your Majesty becomes level-headed.

379
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:47,620
Will you make a fool out of me to the end?

380
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,450
Did I not say I will face it myself?

381
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,110
Did I not say I will handle it?

382
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,830
I, as King!

383
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,720
Did I not say I will take care of it!

384
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,600
Your Majesty.

385
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,570
If you view me as the King, then stop here.

386
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:02,190
If you bring up Sangwang again,

387
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:04,880
I will not let you off.

388
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:36,800
His Majesty is deeply worried after hearing that you have not eaten.

389
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:47,050
I said to bring Sangwang to me.

390
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:49,470
Sangwang!

391
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,790
[Won Beom, Yi Seong Gye's right-hand man]

392
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:51,980
He brought the commands of Taesangwang.

393
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,550
We will raise an army

394
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,160
in Dongbukmyeon as originally planned.

395
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,720
[Nam Jeong: Yi Bang Gwa's right-hand man]

396
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:05,100
Is not Taesangwang imprisoned in the palace?

397
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,800
He predicted all of this.

398
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,960
He must have a plan.

399
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,640
Then...

400
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:18,500
the Gabyeolcho in the Three Armies need to join us,

401
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:22,850
but Sangwang needs to make his intentions known first.

402
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:25,090
He is...

403
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:28,010
sill unable to decide.

404
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:34,000
I am not sure what he is so afraid of.

405
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:39,190
Then let us do this.

406
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:41,780
Let us show him the secret royal order we signed.

407
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,430
How will we deliver that to him?

408
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:47,680
After the incident at Hoeamsa, the security at the palace has grown strict.

409
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,410
There is...

410
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,310
one way to do so.

411
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,790
Tell me.

412
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:14,670
At Nam Jeong's house, several former Gabyeolcho met in secret.

413
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:16,210
What did you say?

414
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:32,820
Aigoo, my Princess must be pretty powerful.

415
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,840
To think I would live in a house like this!

416
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,530
My goodness...

417
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,740
Welcome.

418
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:47,170
I was waiting for you while stretching my shoulders.

419
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:54,580
You cannot buy that safflower blush these days

420
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,780
even if you wanted to.

421
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:00,580
- Oh, really? Then I will take this, and-
- This one.

422
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,630
Okay, let me see.

423
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,100
It looks so good on you.

424
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,880
Really?

425
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,360
- This one, too.
- Goodness, this woman.

426
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,380
You know, that thing.

427
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,890
This.

428
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:24,630
I barely managed to find it after digging around Boseong.

429
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:27,240
If you wash your private parts with this,

430
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:32,030
it will be very effective in...

431
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,540
That scared me.

432
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,410
Who is it?

433
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,100
You want me to deliver this to the Attendant Lady of Sangwang's palace?

434
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,350
That is correct.

435
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:55,850
What is this?

436
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,340
You do not need to know.

437
00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:01,500
I heard several times that Taesangwang is looking for you.

438
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:10,120
You are quite peaceful

439
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:14,990
despite the chaotic situation around you, Sangwang.

440
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:17,290
My mind is conflicted.

441
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:20,090
Seeing how you are unable to tell,

442
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:23,040
I see that I was not found out.

443
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:23,680
What is it?

444
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,040
- I was worried, so I made some porridge.
- Porridge?

445
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:32,230
I remembered she used to eat black sesame porridge to calm her stomach and

446
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:34,300
improve her appetite when she lived in Chudong.

447
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,190
Goodness, so commendable.

448
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,610
Your Majesty,

449
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:43,760
Favored Court Lady has brought some black sesame porridge.

450
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,580
Shall I have her come in?

451
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:47,420
<i>Have her come in.</i>

452
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,170
I am Your Majesty's servant.

453
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:57,590
Then,

454
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:03,220
can you find out what the King is thinking and tell me?

455
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,410
Can you?

456
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:10,890
If I do,

457
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,020
can I serve you closely?

458
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,970
That is so.

459
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:29,760
Yes.

460
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:39,200
<i>His Majesty said he will come here.</i>

461
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,690
<i>The reason he is seeking Favored Court Lady's quarters is-</i>

462
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:43,910
<i>I know.</i>

463
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:57,740
<i>His Majesty is here.</i>

464
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:10,400
There is no need.

465
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:21,360
Has Yeoseonggun visited the Queen's chambers recently?

466
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,870
Yes.

467
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:27,200
Yeoganggun and Yeoseonggun both came by.

468
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,670
What did they talk about?

469
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:34,950
It appeared that they were talking about Sangwang.

470
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,190
What did they say?

471
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:39,480
I could not hear in detail

472
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:43,320
because they spoke so secretively in a low voice.

473
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:48,440
You need to tell me everything that you hear regarding Sangwang.

474
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,090
Yes.

475
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,000
That is all.

476
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:08,370
<i>If you carelessly rush like last time, you can mess things up.</i>

477
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:13,180
<i>So allow His Majesty to decide the sleeping arrangements.</i>

478
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:38,380
I hear His Majesty is staying tonight at Favored Court Lady's quarters.

479
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:41,630
As Queen, must I know

480
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:46,470
which quarters the King spends the night in?

481
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:48,760
That is so.

482
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,820
It is late at night.

483
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:52,180
I suggest you sleep now.

484
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:55,330
I understand, so leave.

485
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,850
Yes.

486
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,130
<i>No!</i>

487
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:48,100
<i>How dare you!</i>

488
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,840
<i>You will never deserve it.</i>

489
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,840
<i>I will kill you</i>

490
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:56,900
<i>and undo everything that went wrong.</i>

491
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:14,330
Your Majesty.

492
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:15,840
Your Majesty!

493
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,460
Your Majesty.

494
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,650
Your Majesty.

495
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:47,210
You should lie down straight and sleep comfortably.

496
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:04,420
Are you not going to sleep?

497
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:07,130
As for me,

498
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:12,200
instead of sleeping while looking at Your Majesty's back,

499
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:18,680
despite the dim moonlight, I would rather

500
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:24,520
sit here and look at your face all night.

501
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:37,310
You were a maidservant of the Queen at the private residence.

502
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:40,470
Then, you became a Main Chamber Maid after entering the palace.

503
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:43,480
- Yes.
- Then you received my favor

504
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:46,420
- and became Favored Court Lady.
- Yes.

505
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:48,720
Not only that, you were bold enough

506
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,430
to make me seek you out two times a month.

507
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:56,160
Then, have you not gained enough?

508
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:05,440
I have not gained

509
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:08,970
your attention.

510
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:31,490
You should not keep one foot on the Queen while keeping the other foot on me.

511
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:36,600
- Your Majesty.
- You also must not decide for yourself what to tell

512
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,220
and what not to tell me.

513
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:41,870
You must report everything to me.

514
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:43,690
Do you understand?

515
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:47,760
Why are you not answering me?

516
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,120
If I agree to do so,

517
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:54,010
will you trust me?

518
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:58,700
Everyone still thinks of me as the Queen's servant.

519
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:01,340
I will trust you. I will...

520
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:05,420
- trust you.
- If I agree to do so,

521
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:10,420
what will Your Majesty give me in return?

522
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,900
I will give myself.

523
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,520
I will...

524
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,690
give you myself.

525
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:23,030
All right. Did you serve the King well?

526
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:24,720
Yes.

527
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:28,940
Did he seem upset at all?

528
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:32,600
No, he did not seem that way.

529
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:35,760
He rested well.

530
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,520
You are quite good.

531
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:42,120
To think you satisfied him in my absence.

532
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,450
That is not so.

533
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:47,530
I will merely do what you say.

534
00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:49,370
You may leave.

535
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:03,240
Your Majesty, it appears our opportunity has come.

536
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,480
Are you referring to the envoy from Ming?

537
00:51:06,450 --> 00:51:08,380
Yes, you knew about it.

538
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:10,930
If the envoy from Ming comes looking for Taesangwang,

539
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:13,750
it will be difficult to discuss deposing the Queen any longer.

540
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:15,300
- Yes.
- Yes.

541
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:18,220
Help the King make the decision.

542
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:20,160
- Yes.
- But...

543
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,690
it will not look good if you pressure him too much.

544
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:23,830
Yes, Your Majesty.

545
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:28,930
But I do not know if it is okay to let Taesangwang leave the palace.

546
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:32,120
Rumors of what is happening at Dongbukmyeon are ominous.

547
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:35,150
Have our informants pay close attention through Pan Su.

548
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:37,510
Yes, Your Majesty.

549
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,110
Give this...

550
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:52,940
You want me to give this to Sangwang?

551
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:55,790
That is correct. And...

552
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:00,030
- This is...
- What is this?

553
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:02,110
It is not much, but...

554
00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:04,140
- No.
- Court Lady.

555
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:23,570
<i>His Majesty is here.</i>

556
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,050
Your Majesty.

557
00:52:52,050 --> 00:52:56,450
The envoy from Ming will be arriving in Gaegyeong soon.

558
00:52:56,450 --> 00:53:00,210
How is the reception of the envoy from Ming progressing?

559
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:05,140
It is traditional for the Queen's palace to prepare for this,

560
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:11,900
but we are currently discussing deposing the Queen.

561
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:15,270
No matter how well the Yeongjeopdogam prepares,
[Yeongjeopdogam: A temporary office created for receiving Ming envoys]

562
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:19,950
I am afraid there might be some problems.

563
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:28,100
The envoy from Ming said he would meet with Taesangwang and hear directly from him.

564
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:30,970
Even if he says he will hear directly from Taesangwang,

565
00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:35,000
their actual goal is to receive tribute.

566
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,570
What Yunwen needs the most in his ongoing war with Zhu Di must be horses.

567
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:42,610
But if we just offer horses as a tribute to Yunwen

568
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:45,730
and Zhu Di ends up taking control of the empire...

569
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:48,840
We have to consider that possibility as well.

570
00:53:51,370 --> 00:53:55,070
We need to stall for time so we can see how the war is progressing.

571
00:53:55,070 --> 00:53:59,450
However, only Taesangwang is capable of doing that.

572
00:53:59,450 --> 00:54:04,460
I hear that the envoy became close friends with Taesangwang

573
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:07,560
during his time at Dongbukmyeon.

574
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:11,770
But will Taesangwang do this for us?

575
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:17,170
How about you tell the Queen to help?

576
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:21,310
She acted as a temporary bridge between Your Majesty and Taesangwang

577
00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:24,340
before you ascended to the throne.

578
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:42,480
Are you telling me to meet Father and persuade him?

579
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,560
What will you do?

580
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:46,680
I will do it.

581
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:48,240
However...

582
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:56,400
It is your right as the Queen.

583
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:12,270
Sir!

584
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:15,230
They are no longer discussing deposing the Queen.

585
00:55:15,230 --> 00:55:18,720
Thus, we must pick a date for the royal consummation.

586
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:22,710
It has been 11 days since Her Majesty's last period.

587
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:26,220
However, tomorrow is the day of the snake. So that is no good.

588
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:28,810
You say the day of the snake and the day of the tiger are no good.

589
00:55:28,810 --> 00:55:30,700
And the first, 15th, and last day of the month are no good, either!

590
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:32,620
Then when can it happen?

591
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:35,570
Well, maybe we can look again next month.

592
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:37,730
We cannot wait until then!

593
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:41,470
Looking at the weather,

594
00:55:41,470 --> 00:55:44,280
there is also the risk of thunderstorms for the time being.

595
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:49,320
How about tonight?

596
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:50,520
Tonight?

597
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,290
Today is not the day of the snake or the tiger.

598
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:55,410
Nor is it the first or last day of the month.

599
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:59,050
And it is not the 15th day of the month.

600
00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:01,710
And there are no thunderstorms.

601
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:03,130
How could we so suddenly?

602
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:04,730
There is a slight mist-

603
00:56:04,730 --> 00:56:06,180
That is settled!

604
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:08,210
Let us set it up for tonight.

605
00:56:08,210 --> 00:56:10,100
There is no such rule!

606
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:14,490
The rules are made based on need. Is it not?

607
00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:15,920
Come on now!

608
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:46,520
You should stay here.

609
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:08,570
I heard the leader of the envoys who came was a longtime friend of yours, Father.

610
00:57:08,570 --> 00:57:11,780
Welcome your long-lost friend and comfort him-

611
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:14,180
You should get to the point.

612
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:19,010
Supposedly, he will demand 10,000 horses as tribute.

613
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:23,020
I would like for you to persuade him

614
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:25,990
that it will take time to prepare this.

615
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:34,320
You want to watch how the war between Yunwen and Zhu Di progresses

616
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:37,770
and respond accordingly to the tribute demands.

617
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:42,800
And so, you are asking me to buy you some time.

618
00:57:44,590 --> 00:57:48,630
If it is about such a matter, why are you here

619
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:51,220
instead of the King?

620
00:57:52,450 --> 00:57:55,230
There was the incident at Hoeamsa,

621
00:57:55,230 --> 00:57:58,810
and he also felt you may find the King uncomfortable, Father.

622
00:57:58,810 --> 00:58:00,600
And?

623
00:58:01,790 --> 00:58:07,610
And he thinks you and I have been close since our private residence days.

624
00:58:07,610 --> 00:58:09,600
That was during your private residence days.

625
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:12,210
He is now the King.

626
00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:14,940
There are things the King should do

627
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:19,560
and things the Queen should do.

628
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:23,770
What?

629
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:29,270
Will you talk about the people and lecture me again?

630
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:32,530
- No, Father.
- Do you...

631
00:58:32,530 --> 00:58:34,940
perhaps even subconsciously,

632
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:43,400
consider this nation, Joseon, to belong to the Min family?

633
00:58:44,770 --> 00:58:46,700
How could you say such a thing?

634
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:49,780
- You enthroned the current King.
- Father.

635
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:56,820
I say this since the King has always been manipulated under the folds of your skirt.

636
00:58:57,820 --> 00:58:59,620
Will you not...

637
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:05,010
see more bloodshed in the future?

638
00:59:05,010 --> 00:59:06,900
How could you say such terrible things?

639
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:09,370
I am referring to Sangwang.

640
00:59:09,370 --> 00:59:10,690
Father.

641
00:59:10,690 --> 00:59:12,440
Father.

642
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:21,650
I called for him.

643
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,900
What do you want me to do?

644
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:30,280
- Die.
- Father!
