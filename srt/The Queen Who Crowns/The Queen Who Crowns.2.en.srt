[Filming of animals or child actors followed production guidelines.]

5
00:00:50,682 --> 00:00:54,432
You must serve His Majesty tonight.

6
00:00:54,432 --> 00:00:55,992
Pardon?

7
00:00:57,602 --> 00:01:00,612
Does Her Majesty know about this?

8
00:01:01,612 --> 00:01:03,212
Strip her naked.

9
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,510
Will you serve His Majesty holding that?

10
00:01:30,116 --> 00:01:31,483
Wash her!

11
00:01:59,856 --> 00:02:01,886
I will tell Her Majesty first.

12
00:02:01,886 --> 00:02:05,066
Every woman in the palace belongs to His Majesty.

13
00:02:05,966 --> 00:02:09,206
The same goes for a maid of the Queen's palace.

14
00:02:09,206 --> 00:02:13,466
The Queen will soon learn that as well.

15
00:02:43,883 --> 00:02:47,563
Your Majesty, we will send her in.

16
00:04:31,778 --> 00:04:38,588
<i>Your Majesty, you do not seem to be the person I have known for a long time.</i>

17
00:04:38,588 --> 00:04:40,908
<i>I am the King of this nation</i>

18
00:04:40,908 --> 00:04:43,058
<i>and you are now my subject.</i>

19
00:04:43,058 --> 00:04:46,828
<i>I will make all the decisions, and you just have to follow them.</i>

20
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,668
[Episode 2]

21
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:16,598
Young Master, is not Gaegyeong quite small?

22
00:05:16,598 --> 00:05:24,158
I want to race across the vast world to my heart's content.

23
00:05:25,168 --> 00:05:28,968
I see you are so easily letting go of a woman's fate.

24
00:05:29,728 --> 00:05:31,658
What about you, Young Master?

25
00:05:35,848 --> 00:05:41,818
I want to protect you in every moment by your side.

26
00:06:07,778 --> 00:06:10,868
Thief, thief! Catch the thief!

27
00:06:10,868 --> 00:06:13,868
Aigoo, how dare you put the rice cakes in your mouth!

28
00:06:13,868 --> 00:06:15,698
This girl is a thief! You thief!

29
00:06:15,698 --> 00:06:18,918
Hey, I told you to go away without causing trouble!

30
00:06:18,918 --> 00:06:20,298
Spit it out, spit it out!

31
00:06:20,298 --> 00:06:22,938
I will teach you a lesson today!

32
00:06:22,938 --> 00:06:24,788
You evil wench, you thief!

33
00:06:24,788 --> 00:06:27,178
Hey, spit it out! Spit it out!

34
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,108
What is your name?

35
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,358
Chae Ryeong.

36
00:06:33,828 --> 00:06:36,668
Chae Ryeong, eat this.

37
00:06:39,428 --> 00:06:43,828
Not too long ago, her mother abandoned her and ran away.

38
00:06:51,628 --> 00:06:53,568
Aigoo, aigoo! You! Hey, hey!

39
00:06:53,568 --> 00:06:55,728
Do you know how much that costs!

40
00:06:55,728 --> 00:06:57,908
Aigoo, what is everyone doing not catching her!

41
00:06:57,908 --> 00:07:00,848
<i>Aigoo, aigoo! Aigoo!</i>

42
00:07:00,848 --> 00:07:03,338
<i>Aigoo! Come here!</i>

43
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:06,208
I will give this to you.

44
00:07:06,908 --> 00:07:09,998
However, it is on one condition.

45
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:15,168
Will you come with me to my house?

46
00:07:20,238 --> 00:07:25,698
<i>I will help you live in a world where you are not</i>

47
00:07:25,698 --> 00:07:29,978
<i>looked down on or discriminated against</i>

48
00:07:29,978 --> 00:07:33,088
<i>for being weak as a woman.</i>

49
00:07:51,818 --> 00:07:54,608
Court Lady Jeong is already here.

50
00:07:56,448 --> 00:08:02,168
The court lady who attended the King's chambers has returned to her quarters.

51
00:08:03,128 --> 00:08:04,738
And the consummation was completed well-

52
00:08:04,738 --> 00:08:06,288
That is enough.

53
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:11,218
Do I need to learn more about this matter?

54
00:08:12,218 --> 00:08:14,228
No.

55
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:22,058
- Your Majesty-
- She received the favor of the King.

56
00:08:22,748 --> 00:08:27,768
You should handle the matter according to the laws and customs of the palace.

57
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:32,118
Yes, I understand.

58
00:08:33,438 --> 00:08:37,258
Chae Ryeong comes from a lowly background,

59
00:08:37,258 --> 00:08:40,268
so she might face disdain from other court ladies.

60
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:44,548
You must strictly maintain discipline.

61
00:08:45,928 --> 00:08:49,308
Yes, I understand.

62
00:08:50,448 --> 00:08:53,008
<i>I will come in for a moment.</i>

63
00:09:37,608 --> 00:09:40,868
<i>The Chief Court Lady is here.</i>

64
00:09:48,538 --> 00:09:50,998
A separate living quarters will be prepared for you soon.

65
00:09:50,998 --> 00:09:54,128
You have received the favor of the king.

66
00:09:54,128 --> 00:09:57,418
In the chance that you bear him a child, you will be moved to Junior 4th Rank.

67
00:09:57,418 --> 00:10:00,248
As someone of high rank, you should take extra care

68
00:10:00,248 --> 00:10:02,448
and not act rashly.

69
00:10:03,328 --> 00:10:04,368
Yes.

70
00:10:04,368 --> 00:10:07,928
If any court lady looks down on you because you were formerly a slave,

71
00:10:07,928 --> 00:10:10,648
tell me without hesitation.

72
00:10:10,648 --> 00:10:15,408
I received orders from Her Majesty to maintain strict discipline.

73
00:10:21,068 --> 00:10:22,598
Yes.

74
00:10:37,088 --> 00:10:41,618
I will oversee all matters concerning bringing Yeong Sil

75
00:10:41,618 --> 00:10:44,748
into the palace.

76
00:10:44,748 --> 00:10:50,448
But I have not received any separate orders from His Majesty regarding this.

77
00:10:50,448 --> 00:10:52,988
I am the one responsible for the royal concubines.

78
00:10:52,988 --> 00:10:57,188
Thus, you just have to follow my decisions.

79
00:10:58,138 --> 00:11:00,168
I understand.

80
00:11:07,768 --> 00:11:10,618
Your Majesty, I have committed a sin worthy of death.

81
00:11:10,618 --> 00:11:12,368
Your Majesty, Your Majesty!

82
00:11:12,368 --> 00:11:13,958
I have committed a sin worthy of death.

83
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:17,528
Your Majesty! Your Majesty, I have committed a sin worthy of death.

84
00:11:17,528 --> 00:11:18,688
Your Majesty...

85
00:11:18,688 --> 00:11:21,138
It is not...

86
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:23,408
It is not your fault.

87
00:11:23,408 --> 00:11:26,248
It is the fault of the one who took you.

88
00:11:26,248 --> 00:11:30,728
Last night, whatever the nature of that union may have been...

89
00:11:34,168 --> 00:11:39,018
If it was such a union, receiving royal favor is not something to rejoice over.

90
00:11:39,018 --> 00:11:40,688
He treated you like nothing.

91
00:11:40,688 --> 00:11:43,488
It is something to be angry about!

92
00:11:43,488 --> 00:11:47,128
Your Majesty, Your Majesty, please...

93
00:11:47,128 --> 00:11:50,098
- Your Majesty...
- Your Majesty!

94
00:11:50,098 --> 00:11:53,228
Prince Je is right now...

95
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,058
[Yi Je, Grand Prince Yang Nyeong]

96
00:12:03,058 --> 00:12:06,488
<i>Her Majesty is here.</i>

97
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:10,778
No need for you to get up.

98
00:12:17,968 --> 00:12:20,738
My child, were you very sick?

99
00:12:20,738 --> 00:12:23,558
He has a severe cold.

100
00:12:23,558 --> 00:12:25,978
He will get better after taking some medicinal tonic,

101
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:28,628
so you do not have to worry.

102
00:12:28,628 --> 00:12:30,518
All right.

103
00:12:33,418 --> 00:12:37,588
He will need to eat the rice porridge in order to take the tonic.

104
00:12:39,888 --> 00:12:43,148
<i>His Majesty is here.</i>

105
00:12:50,908 --> 00:12:52,988
Father.

106
00:12:52,988 --> 00:12:54,548
Yes...

107
00:12:54,548 --> 00:12:56,998
You should eat some with your mother.

108
00:13:00,028 --> 00:13:01,698
Let me see...

109
00:13:27,868 --> 00:13:30,768
"We do not know why the Former King bequeathed the throne.

110
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,348
Even if he did,

111
00:13:32,348 --> 00:13:35,648
there are Grand Prince Ik An and Grand Prince Hwe An after him.

112
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,028
We do not know why the King ascended to the throne.

113
00:13:38,028 --> 00:13:42,758
We will go meet with Taesangwang and hear from him directly." That is what they said.

114
00:13:44,148 --> 00:13:47,128
They must think of me as a joke as well.

115
00:13:47,128 --> 00:13:51,928
Your Majesty, how could you say such a thing?

116
00:13:51,928 --> 00:13:54,428
You know well that Ming's internal situation is chaotic,

117
00:13:54,428 --> 00:13:57,688
and they act this way to gain the upper hand

118
00:13:57,688 --> 00:14:01,408
regarding tributes and other future matters.

119
00:14:21,338 --> 00:14:26,938
We will be forever in your debt for calling us into the palace.
[Princess Hyosun, Yeong Sil]

120
00:14:28,548 --> 00:14:32,098
All right. How much did you teach him to read and write?

121
00:14:32,098 --> 00:14:34,988
I was not in the state to do so...

122
00:14:34,988 --> 00:14:38,328
However, he is an intelligent child.

123
00:14:38,328 --> 00:14:42,608
See each other twice a day, morning and evening, for about 15 minutes each time.

124
00:14:43,718 --> 00:14:44,948
Your Majesty...

125
00:14:44,948 --> 00:14:48,708
He probably lacks studies compared to the other princes.

126
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:52,538
Thus, he will spend the remaining time learning to read and write.

127
00:14:52,538 --> 00:14:55,298
- He is young.
- He is a prince.

128
00:14:56,228 --> 00:15:00,678
How dare someone like you get involved in the education of a prince?

129
00:15:06,628 --> 00:15:10,838
As Queen, all the princes are my sons.

130
00:15:10,838 --> 00:15:15,708
Thus, you will also be my son from now on.

131
00:15:17,858 --> 00:15:20,708
[Yi Bi, Prince Gyeongnyeong]

132
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,398
Yes.

133
00:15:22,398 --> 00:15:25,018
Even if you are the King's son,

134
00:15:25,018 --> 00:15:28,958
you will be looked down on by your subjects if you lack academics.

135
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,868
Yes, Your Majesty.

136
00:15:30,868 --> 00:15:34,928
In the palace, you do not have to be nice.

137
00:15:34,928 --> 00:15:37,858
Or else people might think lightly of you.

138
00:15:38,758 --> 00:15:43,898
I have never cut corners in life, not even for a single moment.

139
00:15:43,898 --> 00:15:49,488
And so, I am teaching my children to do the same.

140
00:15:49,488 --> 00:15:51,598
You should do the same.

141
00:15:51,598 --> 00:15:54,198
I shall do the same.

142
00:16:10,748 --> 00:16:12,988
I remember how I dreamed of a white dragon

143
00:16:12,988 --> 00:16:17,418
coiled around the rafters of your former residence in Chudong

144
00:16:17,418 --> 00:16:20,168
and told you about it.

145
00:16:21,418 --> 00:16:23,078
In the end,

146
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:27,328
you have become the master of the whole nation.

147
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:32,878
Do you remember those days?

148
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,728
You are warm.

149
00:16:39,418 --> 00:16:43,018
Just like how you were in those days,

150
00:16:43,018 --> 00:16:45,998
you are quite comfortable and warm.

[Yi Seong Gye, the Taesangwang (Yi Bang Won's father)]

153
00:17:28,068 --> 00:17:32,558
How is the renovation of the main hall of Hoeamsa Temple going?

154
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:34,528
They have finished.

00:17:41,578 --> 00:17:43,738
Yes.
[Won Beom, Yi Seong Gye's right-hand man]

158
00:17:43,738 --> 00:17:48,238
The Taesangwang still resides at Soyo Mountain.

159
00:17:48,238 --> 00:17:53,108
And the Gabyeolcho are gathering under Jo Sa in Dongbukmyeon.

160
00:17:53,108 --> 00:17:57,538
Are not Gabyeolcho the soldiers of Dongbukmyeon who used to serve Taesangwang?

161
00:17:57,538 --> 00:18:01,078
Your Majesty, before they amass a large army,

162
00:18:01,078 --> 00:18:03,888
we should strike them first.
[Yeoganggun Min Mu Gu, Younger brother of Queen Won Gyeong]

163
00:18:04,888 --> 00:18:07,488
The Secretary of Royal Orders should notify the Minister of Defense

164
00:18:07,488 --> 00:18:12,538
and have the Ministry of Personnel report to the King regarding the military organization.

165
00:18:16,158 --> 00:18:20,678
Your Majesty, shall we do that?

166
00:18:20,678 --> 00:18:22,828
Why would you wait for his consent?

167
00:18:22,828 --> 00:18:25,018
We should move quickly!

168
00:18:25,798 --> 00:18:31,448
Your Majesty, shall we do according to what Yeoganggun says?

169
00:18:32,718 --> 00:18:34,798
Who is the king?

170
00:18:37,058 --> 00:18:41,378
Between Yeoganggun and me, who is the king?

171
00:18:42,658 --> 00:18:44,638
I apologize.

172
00:18:45,398 --> 00:18:47,218
I have not made up my mind yet.

173
00:18:47,218 --> 00:18:50,358
Then, Your Majesty, will you just watch and do nothing?

174
00:18:50,358 --> 00:18:56,288
Then, are you saying I should go to war against my father's men?

When the first crow of the rooster calls in the early morning,

one should rise from bed.

Tidy oneself, arrange the bedding and the house...
[Yi Bo, Grand Prince Hyoryeong]

178
00:19:29,048 --> 00:19:32,558
And then proceed with the tasks assigned...
[Yi Do, Grand Prince Chungnyeong]

179
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:34,988
To each individual.
[Yi Bi, Prince Jeongnyeong]

180
00:19:34,988 --> 00:19:38,408
The passage is from the "Myeongryun" section of "The Great Learning."

181
00:19:38,408 --> 00:19:43,498
All right, could you tell me what it means?

182
00:19:43,498 --> 00:19:46,028
When the first crow of the rooster calls in the early morning,

183
00:19:46,028 --> 00:19:49,768
one should rise from bed, tidy oneself,

184
00:19:49,768 --> 00:19:53,918
arrange the bedding and the house,

185
00:19:53,918 --> 00:19:56,798
and then proceed with the tasks assigned to each individual.

186
00:19:58,178 --> 00:20:01,238
You did very well.

187
00:20:01,238 --> 00:20:03,268
To put it simply,

188
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:06,798
anyone who wishes to change the world

189
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:12,068
needs to keep their surroundings well-organized.

190
00:20:12,068 --> 00:20:14,778
That is what it means.

191
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:18,918
Then, Prince Bi,

192
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:24,598
could you start reading again from where the eldest Prince read?

193
00:20:29,138 --> 00:20:31,608
Bom nal...

194
00:20:31,608 --> 00:20:35,318
beom we...

195
00:20:35,318 --> 00:20:37,128
gye...

196
00:20:37,128 --> 00:20:39,128
Prince,

197
00:20:41,058 --> 00:20:43,578
do you not want to study?

198
00:20:44,898 --> 00:20:46,688
That is no good.

199
00:20:46,688 --> 00:20:50,918
You need to study even if you do not want to.

200
00:20:50,918 --> 00:20:53,238
All right, let us start again.

201
00:20:55,518 --> 00:20:57,698
Prince!

202
00:20:59,688 --> 00:21:01,758
Your Majesty!

203
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:13,248
Even if the princes slack off in their studies,

204
00:21:13,248 --> 00:21:17,648
it will be difficult for you to punish the princes.

205
00:21:20,348 --> 00:21:22,448
Go and bring a rod.

206
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:23,878
Your Majesty.

207
00:21:23,878 --> 00:21:25,288
Hurry!

208
00:21:25,288 --> 00:21:27,078
Yes, Your Majesty.

209
00:21:31,928 --> 00:21:35,758
Bi, pull up your pant legs and stand.

210
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:10,618
She made him read books all day for an entire month,

211
00:22:10,618 --> 00:22:13,248
except when he ate and used the outhouse.

212
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:16,008
She was famous from her Chudong residence days

213
00:22:16,008 --> 00:22:18,918
for being very strict with her children's education.

214
00:22:18,918 --> 00:22:20,558
But even still...

215
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:23,768
Would she have done this if it was her own son whom she bore?

216
00:22:31,728 --> 00:22:34,338
The King goes to Yeong Sil's-

217
00:22:36,818 --> 00:22:39,918
to Princess Hyosun's quarters often.

218
00:22:39,918 --> 00:22:44,448
Since the days in Chudong, I knew she would cause such a problem.

219
00:22:44,448 --> 00:22:46,358
She would go around smiling with her eyes.

220
00:22:46,358 --> 00:22:48,078
Maybe it is because of that,

221
00:22:48,078 --> 00:22:52,048
but the way the King is treating us has changed.

222
00:22:52,048 --> 00:22:57,268
When he looked at me in the main hall, my heart dropped, and I felt a chill all over.

223
00:22:57,268 --> 00:23:00,228
With that look in his eyes, he could even kill someone.

224
00:23:00,228 --> 00:23:04,068
There are complaints rising to him saying that Hyungnim should resign

225
00:23:04,068 --> 00:23:06,298
from being the Middle Army Commander.

226
00:23:06,298 --> 00:23:09,538
I am sure someone is inciting this behind the scenes.

227
00:23:11,278 --> 00:23:13,098
Resign from the position.

228
00:23:13,098 --> 00:23:14,598
Your Majesty!

229
00:23:14,598 --> 00:23:16,868
How could you say that so easily?

230
00:23:16,868 --> 00:23:18,948
Hyungnim.

231
00:23:18,948 --> 00:23:22,068
Has the Queen ever been wrong?

232
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:24,228
Let us do what she says this time.

233
00:23:24,228 --> 00:23:26,208
- Still, even so!
- Come on, Hyungnim.

234
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:29,668
<i>Your Majesty, Princess Hyosun is here.</i>

235
00:23:29,668 --> 00:23:33,478
- Princess Hyosun!
- How dare you barge in here!

236
00:23:36,318 --> 00:23:38,768
Let us talk again later.

237
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:55,988
What do you want?

238
00:23:55,988 --> 00:23:59,948
My Bi cannot become king anyway.

239
00:23:59,948 --> 00:24:03,178
Must I listen to you looking up?

240
00:24:03,178 --> 00:24:06,238
Therefore, I will not have him study so hard.

241
00:24:06,238 --> 00:24:08,768
This is the matter of educating a prince.

242
00:24:08,768 --> 00:24:10,838
Your opinion does not matter.

243
00:24:10,838 --> 00:24:14,238
Why are you so harsh only to my Bi?

244
00:24:15,498 --> 00:24:20,108
I do not know why I need to explain all this to you,

245
00:24:20,108 --> 00:24:22,618
but Bi has not received proper education up until now.

246
00:24:22,618 --> 00:24:27,238
If he is to not impede the other princes' education and keep up with them,

247
00:24:27,238 --> 00:24:29,198
is this not the only way?

248
00:24:29,198 --> 00:24:30,788
Impede?

249
00:24:31,608 --> 00:24:33,138
That is not it.

250
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:36,448
You just dislike me, Your Majesty.

251
00:24:37,448 --> 00:24:40,578
How could I like you?

252
00:24:40,578 --> 00:24:43,218
That is why you hit him like that.

253
00:24:43,218 --> 00:24:46,768
You say I hit the child because I dislike you?

254
00:24:46,768 --> 00:24:48,108
That is right.

255
00:24:48,108 --> 00:24:52,558
Because you could not endure the fact that I was loved by the King.

256
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:54,248
You have lost your mind.

257
00:24:54,248 --> 00:24:58,488
That is why you took out your anger on the child.

258
00:25:04,008 --> 00:25:06,158
I know you.

259
00:25:06,158 --> 00:25:08,438
You received favor from me.

260
00:25:08,438 --> 00:25:10,178
However,

261
00:25:10,178 --> 00:25:14,178
you must want to take sole possession of the King's affection, even if you trample me.

262
00:25:14,178 --> 00:25:15,698
Thus,

263
00:25:15,698 --> 00:25:18,418
I must become a bad person to you.

264
00:25:18,418 --> 00:25:20,688
Someone who deserves to be trampled.

265
00:25:20,688 --> 00:25:25,668
That way, you will feel less guilty about it.

266
00:25:27,138 --> 00:25:29,328
If you are so superior,

267
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:34,538
and know the world as if it is in the palm of your hands,

268
00:25:34,538 --> 00:25:38,178
why did you make His Majesty lonely?

269
00:25:38,178 --> 00:25:40,738
Is that why you secretly slept with His Majesty

270
00:25:40,738 --> 00:25:44,138
back when he was Prince Jeongan?
[Prince Jeongan: Yi Bang Won's title as a prince]

271
00:25:44,138 --> 00:25:45,438
Yes.

272
00:25:45,438 --> 00:25:49,938
I felt bad watching him endure his fierce madam and his imposing in-laws.

273
00:25:49,938 --> 00:25:53,058
- Shut your mouth!
- His Majesty said

274
00:25:53,058 --> 00:25:58,328
he felt suffocated while living with the Min family when he was young.

275
00:26:03,748 --> 00:26:06,328
<i>Your Majesty, we will be entering.</i>

276
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:12,188
Y-Y-Your Majesty.

277
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:18,828
Get this girl out of my sight now!

278
00:26:20,008 --> 00:26:21,818
Princess...

279
00:26:36,418 --> 00:26:38,538
Your Majesty.

280
00:26:49,618 --> 00:26:51,278
Who are you?

281
00:26:53,348 --> 00:26:56,038
I am a court maid who is to serve Princess Hyosun.

282
00:26:56,038 --> 00:26:58,338
I have not heard anything of it. Turn back!

283
00:26:58,338 --> 00:27:00,318
What is with all the ruckus?

284
00:27:01,098 --> 00:27:03,728
- This woman-
- Enough. I already checked her.

285
00:27:03,728 --> 00:27:05,168
Let her in.

286
00:27:05,168 --> 00:27:06,358
Yes, sir.

287
00:27:07,118 --> 00:27:08,578
Wait!

288
00:27:09,578 --> 00:27:11,768
- Let her be.
- Yes.

289
00:27:13,058 --> 00:27:15,968
How could he be so inflexible?

290
00:27:24,238 --> 00:27:29,408
The King says he will come to your quarters, Princess.

291
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:32,938
But I am thinking of giving an excuse to reschedule for another day.

292
00:27:32,938 --> 00:27:34,498
Why?

293
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:39,648
No, I will serve the King tonight.

294
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,948
Princess.

295
00:27:40,948 --> 00:27:45,978
Is it not the duty of a concubine to serve His Majesty whenever he wants?

296
00:27:51,868 --> 00:27:53,708
Goodness...

297
00:27:54,838 --> 00:27:56,888
You did well.

298
00:27:56,888 --> 00:27:59,438
You also bore him a prince.

299
00:27:59,438 --> 00:28:01,388
You do not need to be afraid of her.

300
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,758
I will not be afraid of her.

301
00:28:05,218 --> 00:28:07,648
Whether it is face powder, blush, or eyebrow makeup,

302
00:28:07,648 --> 00:28:10,968
I brought you the best of Joseon.

303
00:28:11,948 --> 00:28:15,198
And this is a fragrant knot accessory.

304
00:28:15,198 --> 00:28:16,708
It contains musk.

305
00:28:16,708 --> 00:28:18,558
Please try smelling it.

306
00:28:24,268 --> 00:28:29,268
It is the scent that drives men crazy in bed.

307
00:28:30,638 --> 00:28:36,228
Now, all you have to do is wrap the King inside of your skirt

308
00:28:36,228 --> 00:28:40,828
and prevent him from escaping your grasp.

309
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:45,578
Favored Court Lady* is here.
(It means one who's been graced by the king)

310
00:28:57,518 --> 00:28:59,718
Did you call for me?
[Court Lady Seungeun (Favored), Chae Ryeong]

311
00:29:00,818 --> 00:29:05,858
Now that you are properly dressed, I see you are also quite pretty.

312
00:29:07,088 --> 00:29:08,848
How did you end up...

313
00:29:08,848 --> 00:29:14,528
Who would dare do this to the concubine whom the King loves?

314
00:29:17,318 --> 00:29:19,668
I am a court maid.

315
00:29:19,668 --> 00:29:21,918
I am a servant of the Princess.

316
00:29:21,918 --> 00:29:24,498
Oh, I see.

317
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:29,928
Since you have served Her Majesty for a long time, you probably know well

318
00:29:29,928 --> 00:29:33,328
that she is a very confident person.

319
00:29:33,328 --> 00:29:35,448
For her, her thoughts are the standard,

320
00:29:35,448 --> 00:29:38,508
and everything else that differs from them is wrong.

321
00:29:39,908 --> 00:29:43,198
I am no longer the Yeong Sil of the past.

322
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,078
With that said, let me ask you.

323
00:29:45,078 --> 00:29:49,028
You and I have to join forces for us to live in this palace

324
00:29:49,028 --> 00:29:52,328
without being pushed around by the Queen.

325
00:29:57,208 --> 00:30:02,788
If you had to pick between Her Majesty and me, who would you pick?

326
00:30:03,878 --> 00:30:09,138
Of course, it will be more advantageous for you to stand with the Princess.

327
00:30:09,138 --> 00:30:12,378
Everyone in the palace knows

328
00:30:12,378 --> 00:30:16,708
with whom the King's affection lies.

329
00:30:35,588 --> 00:30:37,948
Favored Court Lady.

330
00:30:37,948 --> 00:30:39,908
What is it?

331
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:53,628
If you do not want to grow old and die alone in the backroom

332
00:30:54,708 --> 00:30:57,328
you should pick the right side.

333
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:01,548
What...

334
00:31:01,548 --> 00:31:03,868
do you mean by that?
(Watch on www.kisskh.la or www.kisskh.co to support Admin)

335
00:31:03,868 --> 00:31:05,928
Just because you were favored by the king once

336
00:31:05,928 --> 00:31:09,418
does not mean you have gained the entire world.

337
00:31:09,418 --> 00:31:14,068
If you make the wrong move, you may end up making enemies of everyone,

338
00:31:14,068 --> 00:31:16,908
before getting cast aside.

339
00:31:34,568 --> 00:31:39,278
<i>If you make the wrong move, you may end up making enemies of everyone,</i>

340
00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:42,658
<i>before getting cast aside.</i>

341
00:31:42,658 --> 00:31:48,238
<i>If you had to pick between Her Majesty and me, who would you pick?</i>

342
00:32:05,948 --> 00:32:09,518
My Lady! My Lady!

343
00:32:09,518 --> 00:32:12,288
My Lady, where are you going?

344
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:14,608
My Lady, My Lady.

345
00:32:15,988 --> 00:32:17,858
My Lady, My Lady.

346
00:32:17,858 --> 00:32:19,568
My Lady!

347
00:32:20,368 --> 00:32:22,458
What is going on?

348
00:32:22,458 --> 00:32:23,678
No, you cannot enter.

349
00:32:23,678 --> 00:32:25,268
- Your Majesty!
- You cannot enter!

350
00:32:25,268 --> 00:32:27,138
- It is me, Chae Ryeong!
- You cannot enter!

351
00:32:27,138 --> 00:32:29,678
- Your Majesty!
- You cannot enter!

352
00:32:37,868 --> 00:32:43,408
I want to serve you like before, Your Majesty.

353
00:32:44,408 --> 00:32:47,978
After you saved me that day,

354
00:32:47,978 --> 00:32:51,748
I promised to stay by your side even to my death.

355
00:32:55,378 --> 00:32:58,038
Your Majesty,

356
00:32:58,038 --> 00:33:03,548
did you not say that it was not my fault that His Majesty took me?

357
00:33:10,628 --> 00:33:12,328
Your Majesty...

358
00:33:12,328 --> 00:33:14,908
<i>Your Majesty, I will enter.</i>

359
00:33:18,248 --> 00:33:19,598
Your Majesty.

360
00:33:19,598 --> 00:33:22,898
What have you been doing all this time?

361
00:33:22,898 --> 00:33:25,668
This court lady who received the favor of the King

362
00:33:25,668 --> 00:33:28,728
is running amok like this

363
00:33:28,728 --> 00:33:31,208
not knowing her status has changed.

364
00:33:32,008 --> 00:33:38,128
Will you concern me with His Majesty's messy women problems?

365
00:33:38,128 --> 00:33:40,298
I apologize, Your Majesty.

366
00:33:40,298 --> 00:33:44,428
If this ever happens again, you will have to forfeit your position.

367
00:33:44,428 --> 00:33:49,108
I will... I will make sure this never happens again.

368
00:33:49,108 --> 00:33:51,258
Please take her back.

369
00:33:51,258 --> 00:33:53,988
- Your Majesty.
- Take her back.

370
00:33:53,988 --> 00:33:56,308
Your Majesty...

371
00:33:56,308 --> 00:33:58,498
Your Majesty!

372
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:06,098
Your Majesty...

373
00:34:08,188 --> 00:34:10,178
<i>Your Majesty...</i>

374
00:34:13,278 --> 00:34:15,268
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

375
00:34:15,268 --> 00:34:17,498
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

376
00:34:27,548 --> 00:34:29,818
Your Majesty, you abandoned me!

377
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:32,498
She did not abandon you. Rather, she gave you a wake-up call.

378
00:34:32,498 --> 00:34:34,988
If you are Favored Court Lady, you are now His Majesty's woman,

379
00:34:34,988 --> 00:34:37,268
not a servant of the Queen's palace.

380
00:34:40,848 --> 00:34:45,368
You have to think that way to keep living in this palace.

381
00:34:48,438 --> 00:34:49,938
Take her to her quarters.

382
00:34:49,938 --> 00:34:51,698
<i>Yes.</i>

383
00:35:13,568 --> 00:35:16,158
I heard the news about Favored Court Lady.

384
00:35:16,158 --> 00:35:19,078
I heard the Queen was furious.

385
00:35:19,078 --> 00:35:21,728
You are supposed to be the Attendant Lady of the King's palace.

386
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:25,268
Have you not told Favored Court Lady how she should conduct herself

387
00:35:25,268 --> 00:35:28,248
after she has received the favor of the King?

388
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:31,008
Oh.

389
00:35:31,008 --> 00:35:32,618
Oh?

390
00:35:34,128 --> 00:35:37,498
How are you in your position with that mentality?

391
00:35:40,678 --> 00:35:42,338
Also,

392
00:35:42,338 --> 00:35:46,008
I heard you discreetly placed your brother on the suppliers' list providing goods to the palace.

393
00:35:46,008 --> 00:35:48,158
Is it true?

394
00:35:48,158 --> 00:35:49,988
He meets the qualifications.

395
00:35:49,988 --> 00:35:53,168
Are you saying he cannot because he is my brother?

396
00:35:54,408 --> 00:35:57,498
Everything has principles and procedures.

397
00:35:57,498 --> 00:35:59,858
And that judgment is for me to make.

398
00:35:59,858 --> 00:36:01,148
This isn't the first time, either!

399
00:36:01,148 --> 00:36:02,828
- Court Lady Jeong.
- I am tired. You should go.

400
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:05,208
- Court Lady Jeong!
- Go!

401
00:36:06,208 --> 00:36:09,158
Did I not say I am tired today?

402
00:36:22,968 --> 00:36:25,338
<i>Your Majesty, you abandoned me!</i>

403
00:36:25,338 --> 00:36:28,048
<i>She did not abandon you. Rather, she gave you a wake-up call.</i>

404
00:36:28,048 --> 00:36:30,488
<i>If you are Favored Court Lady, you are now His Majesty's woman,</i>

405
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:32,748
<i>not a servant of the Queen's palace.</i>

406
00:37:07,208 --> 00:37:09,098
Was it the Queen?

407
00:37:13,368 --> 00:37:15,138
Did you get hit?

408
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:18,908
It is nothing.

409
00:37:18,908 --> 00:37:20,798
Tell me.

410
00:37:22,548 --> 00:37:25,118
It is a matter between women.

411
00:38:02,888 --> 00:38:05,028
I do not want to grow old

412
00:38:06,328 --> 00:38:09,578
and die alone in the backroom, forgotten.

413
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:12,808
What do you mean by that?

414
00:38:15,128 --> 00:38:21,508
Create an opportunity for His Majesty to seek me.

415
00:38:26,428 --> 00:38:30,398
That is something for His Majesty to decide.

416
00:38:30,398 --> 00:38:33,488
I just carry out his will.

417
00:38:48,198 --> 00:38:50,288
This was...

418
00:38:51,288 --> 00:38:53,728
given to me by the Queen.

419
00:39:27,918 --> 00:39:29,898
What happened?

420
00:39:29,898 --> 00:39:35,008
It would be breaking custom to speak about matters involving my superior.

421
00:39:35,008 --> 00:39:37,858
So you are saying you cannot tell me?

422
00:39:37,858 --> 00:39:40,368
Even though the Princess's face was bruised,

423
00:39:40,368 --> 00:39:43,008
nobody can tell me anything?

424
00:39:45,498 --> 00:39:48,168
I hear the Princess privately summoned the Favored Court Lady

425
00:39:48,168 --> 00:39:51,618
to tell her everything in detail.

426
00:39:51,618 --> 00:39:53,438
Are you referring to Chae Ryeong?

427
00:39:53,438 --> 00:39:55,628
That is correct.

428
00:39:58,138 --> 00:39:59,838
All right.

429
00:40:01,588 --> 00:40:04,598
You will resign from the Middle Army Commander position?

430
00:40:04,598 --> 00:40:06,888
Yes, Your Majesty.

431
00:40:06,888 --> 00:40:11,958
I feel that perhaps my chronic stomach pain is a result of my heavy duties.

432
00:40:12,958 --> 00:40:16,068
You have done much for me, Yeoganggun.

433
00:40:16,068 --> 00:40:20,838
I feel bad that you may have overexerted yourself because of it,

434
00:40:20,838 --> 00:40:23,398
but stay by my side if possible.

435
00:40:25,838 --> 00:40:27,328
No, Your Majesty.

436
00:40:27,328 --> 00:40:29,538
My ailment is severe.

437
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:33,688
Is that so?

438
00:40:37,248 --> 00:40:40,658
I suppose health is most important.

439
00:40:40,658 --> 00:40:43,708
Then, you may leave and focus your efforts on improving your health.

440
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:46,028
I will call for you again.

441
00:40:46,028 --> 00:40:48,668
Your grace knows no bounds.

442
00:40:52,368 --> 00:40:59,098
Your Majesty, Taesangwang, residing in Soyo Mountain, has sent a messenger.

443
00:40:59,098 --> 00:41:00,808
What did you say?

444
00:41:00,808 --> 00:41:03,668
The main hall renovations at Hoeamsa Temple are complete,

445
00:41:03,668 --> 00:41:05,988
so he will offer up a metal bell as a tribute.

446
00:41:05,988 --> 00:41:10,418
He requests Your Majesty's presence at that event.

447
00:41:10,418 --> 00:41:11,948
My father said that?

448
00:41:11,948 --> 00:41:13,498
Yes.

449
00:41:20,028 --> 00:41:23,938
You say that he had a metal bell made in Gaegyeong?

450
00:41:23,938 --> 00:41:25,838
Yes.

451
00:41:25,838 --> 00:41:30,668
Not only that but on the metal bell were inscriptions

452
00:41:30,668 --> 00:41:34,878
to commemorate the late Queen Dowager,

453
00:41:34,878 --> 00:41:38,308
"Wang Hyeon Bi" and...
[First queen of Joseon, Queen Shindeok, Lee Bang Won's stepmother]

454
00:41:38,308 --> 00:41:41,758
also the words "Crown Prince."

455
00:41:46,088 --> 00:41:48,388
But...

456
00:41:48,388 --> 00:41:50,688
something seems off.

457
00:41:50,688 --> 00:41:52,898
What seems off?

458
00:41:52,898 --> 00:41:55,008
She is Her Majesty.

459
00:41:56,318 --> 00:41:58,068
Your Majesty.

460
00:41:58,068 --> 00:42:01,448
What are you saying seems off?

461
00:42:01,448 --> 00:42:03,228
Well,

462
00:42:03,228 --> 00:42:06,628
the man who did the inscribing on the metal bell

463
00:42:06,628 --> 00:42:09,678
said it looked like it was made only halfway.

464
00:42:12,278 --> 00:42:15,178
It looked like it was made only halfway...

465
00:42:15,178 --> 00:42:16,828
Yes.

466
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:24,328
If you find out anything more,

467
00:42:24,328 --> 00:42:27,278
you better tell me without delay.

468
00:42:29,048 --> 00:42:32,938
Yes, Your Majesty.

469
00:42:36,798 --> 00:42:41,168
Offering an unfinished metal bell to Buddha...

470
00:42:41,168 --> 00:42:43,188
Something does not seem right.

471
00:42:47,108 --> 00:42:50,758
There is definitely something there.

472
00:42:50,758 --> 00:42:52,518
Please find out what it is.

473
00:42:52,518 --> 00:42:55,258
Yes, I understand.

474
00:42:55,258 --> 00:42:56,698
All right, then.

475
00:43:12,138 --> 00:43:13,738
Your Majesty.

476
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:18,898
Hoeamsa is where prayers were offered for the two princes

477
00:43:18,898 --> 00:43:22,098
and his son-in-law, who died in the Year of the Yellow Tiger.

478
00:43:22,098 --> 00:43:23,918
This is a nation of Neo-Confucianism.

479
00:43:23,918 --> 00:43:27,708
He asked Your Majesty to come to a Buddhist ritual ceremony.

480
00:43:27,708 --> 00:43:29,438
Is that not strange?

481
00:43:29,438 --> 00:43:32,848
That thought did cross my mind.

482
00:43:32,848 --> 00:43:35,918
But I lack a justification for rejecting my father's request.

483
00:43:35,918 --> 00:43:40,358
Moreover, an envoy from Ming is also coming.

484
00:43:43,558 --> 00:43:47,878
Then, I will heighten the security.

485
00:43:47,878 --> 00:43:51,878
We will prevent anyone with weapons from entering

486
00:43:51,878 --> 00:43:57,238
and make sure not even a mouse can get in without authorization.

487
00:44:07,298 --> 00:44:11,168
Why did you come out when it is so late?

488
00:44:12,678 --> 00:44:14,158
Mother.

489
00:44:14,158 --> 00:44:17,258
I am just so upset.

490
00:44:17,258 --> 00:44:19,638
Goodness, this woman.

491
00:44:19,638 --> 00:44:23,518
If anyone is upset, Her Majesty would be the most upset one.

492
00:44:23,518 --> 00:44:25,478
And even Chae Ryeong!

493
00:44:25,478 --> 00:44:28,888
Has he not gone too far?

494
00:44:32,028 --> 00:44:37,988
Your Majesty, it appears that now is a time for us to humble ourselves.

495
00:44:37,988 --> 00:44:39,548
Thus,

496
00:44:40,548 --> 00:44:43,708
do not be too bothered by what happened with Yeoganggun.

497
00:44:43,708 --> 00:44:45,528
Yes, Father.

498
00:44:47,398 --> 00:44:49,358
You do not need to cry.

499
00:44:49,358 --> 00:44:52,818
We have the princes anyway.

500
00:44:52,818 --> 00:44:55,738
Yes. Yes.

501
00:44:55,738 --> 00:44:57,288
All right.

502
00:45:11,618 --> 00:45:13,908
What do you mean it was unfinished?

503
00:45:13,908 --> 00:45:15,648
What do you mean by that?

504
00:45:15,648 --> 00:45:17,528
What is a metal bell?

505
00:45:17,528 --> 00:45:21,808
It is called a metal bell because it makes a ringing sound as smooth as silk.

506
00:45:21,808 --> 00:45:24,628
But that thing. That thing is missing.

507
00:45:24,628 --> 00:45:29,238
How could it be when it is a precious tribute the Taesangwang is offering to Buddha?

508
00:45:29,238 --> 00:45:31,548
What do you mean that thing is missing?

509
00:45:33,468 --> 00:45:35,328
The metal bell is...

510
00:45:48,278 --> 00:45:50,148
Tell me.

511
00:45:51,868 --> 00:45:56,748
I can only speak my own thoughts.

512
00:45:56,748 --> 00:46:02,918
If what I say results in deciding who is right and wrong,

513
00:46:02,918 --> 00:46:05,328
I will not be able to retain my life.

514
00:46:05,328 --> 00:46:07,878
I will guarantee your life.

515
00:46:08,878 --> 00:46:13,958
Both of them are my superiors whom I serve.

516
00:46:15,198 --> 00:46:17,498
So,

517
00:46:17,498 --> 00:46:19,928
you cannot tell me?

518
00:46:21,608 --> 00:46:23,818
Please kill me.

519
00:46:35,208 --> 00:46:38,128
I wonder if the Queen was

520
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:42,798
deeply distressed after Yeoganggun's departure.

521
00:46:46,448 --> 00:46:48,738
Did the Queen say that?

522
00:46:48,738 --> 00:46:50,608
No.

523
00:46:50,608 --> 00:46:53,248
She was especially sensitive that day,

524
00:46:53,248 --> 00:46:56,738
so I just tried to figure out why.

525
00:46:58,448 --> 00:47:03,758
Do my brothers-in-law still visit the Queen's palace often?

526
00:47:05,288 --> 00:47:07,288
That is so.

527
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:15,738
Did you hear what the Queen discussed with them?

528
00:47:17,488 --> 00:47:20,148
Tell me exactly as you heard it.

529
00:47:21,778 --> 00:47:23,968
I said, tell me!

530
00:47:26,778 --> 00:47:28,308
Then,

531
00:47:29,848 --> 00:47:35,318
will you come visit my quarters at least two times a month?

532
00:47:40,154 --> 00:47:41,764
Were you not...

533
00:47:42,814 --> 00:47:46,324
the girl whom the Queen valued the most?

534
00:48:08,814 --> 00:48:16,094
<i>His Majesty likes his ear being warmly caressed while he sleeps.</i>

535
00:48:53,881 --> 00:48:59,191
I am embarrassed by what happened involving Yeong Sil.

536
00:51:02,221 --> 00:51:05,351
You have traveled a long way to come here.

537
00:51:13,781 --> 00:51:15,501
Your Majesty.

538
00:51:16,991 --> 00:51:22,671
A long time ago, a king once said

539
00:51:25,741 --> 00:51:28,911
the heavens raise up a king

540
00:51:30,351 --> 00:51:33,791
not because it loves the king,

541
00:51:39,211 --> 00:51:42,251
but for the benefit of all the people.

542
00:51:43,221 --> 00:51:46,341
I am not sure what you mean.

543
00:51:48,721 --> 00:51:52,551
I was just thinking for a moment

544
00:51:54,891 --> 00:51:58,131
about what I should do for all the people.

545
00:53:09,421 --> 00:53:13,881
Perhaps it is because you are at Hoeamsa, but you seem peaceful.

546
00:53:21,081 --> 00:53:25,751
We are touched that you invited us to such a meaningful event, Father.

547
00:53:28,521 --> 00:53:30,771
How admirable.

548
00:53:45,401 --> 00:53:46,501
What do you want?

549
00:53:46,501 --> 00:53:50,171
I-I came to see the Queen.

550
00:53:50,171 --> 00:53:51,541
You cannot enter.

551
00:53:51,541 --> 00:53:53,661
P-Please let me enter.

552
00:53:53,661 --> 00:53:55,321
I have to enter!

553
00:53:55,321 --> 00:53:56,951
It is a matter of importance!

554
00:53:56,951 --> 00:53:58,451
Please, let me enter!

555
00:53:58,451 --> 00:54:00,961
- Go away! Get lost!
- Please!

556
00:54:00,961 --> 00:54:02,851
P-Please!

557
00:54:02,851 --> 00:54:04,591
- Go away!
- Your Majesty!

558
00:54:04,591 --> 00:54:07,051
- Your Majesty!
- What is going on!

559
00:55:17,401 --> 00:55:21,171
Your Majesty, I have something urgent to tell you.

560
00:55:40,211 --> 00:55:41,941
What is it?

561
00:55:44,581 --> 00:55:46,771
The object that is inside

562
00:55:48,141 --> 00:55:52,471
is not a metal bell.

563
00:57:26,131 --> 00:57:28,451
You have to stop!

564
00:57:28,451 --> 00:57:30,961
You must not!

565
00:58:09,751 --> 00:58:12,391
[The Queen Who Crowns]

566
00:58:12,391 --> 00:58:21,141
♫ <i>Only the moonlight lights up the entire mountain</i> ♫

567
00:58:21,141 --> 00:58:31,401
♫ <i>Oh, heavens, holding your breath from being shy</i> ♫

568
00:58:31,401 --> 00:58:41,071
♫ <i>Until the day breaks</i> ♫

569
00:58:41,071 --> 00:58:48,271
♫ <i>We are separated, and I sing alone</i> ♫

570
00:58:48,271 --> 00:58:51,851
<i>My cause is hatred!</i>

571
00:58:51,851 --> 00:58:53,791
<i>Are you saying there are sympathizing forces?</i>

572
00:58:53,791 --> 00:58:55,571
<i>Confess!</i>

573
00:58:55,571 --> 00:58:58,591
<i>Did I not say I will handle it? I, as King!</i>

574
00:58:58,591 --> 00:59:00,291
<i>Did I not say I will take care of it!</i>

575
00:59:00,291 --> 00:59:03,241
<i>You should see the reality with a level head.</i>

576
00:59:03,241 --> 00:59:06,421
<i>You must report everything to me alone.</i>

577
00:59:06,421 --> 00:59:11,711
<i>If I agree to do so, what will Your Majesty give me in return?</i>

578
00:59:11,711 --> 00:59:14,701
<i>Let us discuss the procedures of deposing the Queen.</i>
