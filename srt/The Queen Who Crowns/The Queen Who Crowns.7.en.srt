[Episode 7]

6
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,740
[Year 1405, Hanyang]

7
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,500
After moving the capital to Hanyang,

8
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,590
there are quite a few officials who are seizing the homes of the people.

9
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:21,310
Many people are having their homes seized.

10
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:25,530
The Office of the Inspector General should gather the list of those involved and report it to me.

11
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,060
Yes, Your Majesty.

12
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,810
Also, horses or carriages of the court

13
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:35,290
are often used for the personal affairs of some officials.

14
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:38,310
Horses or carriages of the court are often being used.

15
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,770
The State Council should assess this situation and report to me.

16
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,020
Yes, Your Majesty.

17
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,600
In the new Joseon I will build, the people are the masters.

18
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:56,640
You must not lord it over the people just because you have power.

19
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,190
Then, Mother.

20
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,810
The man named Ji from the Analects

21
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:05,580
coveted even the throne of the King because he was powerful.
[Yi Do, Grand Prince Chungnyeong]

22
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:10,570
Is it not right for the King to punish someone like this Ji?

23
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,710
So, what were you doing?

24
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:23,240
I was asking Mother about Ji from the Analects.

25
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,970
Are you referring to Ji of the powerful family of Lu?

26
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,430
Yes.

27
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:37,160
<i>Are you sure there is no Ji from the family of Lu in this Joseon?</i>

28
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,990
Did you say you will go to Hanyang?

29
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:45,390
- Yes.
- Did you say you will cut off all vested interests

30
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:48,130
and start anew there?

31
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,690
Yes, Father.

32
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:53,620
Then, you may have to start

33
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,600
with the Queen...

34
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,870
and her family members.

35
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,090
Can you do that?

36
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,590
I asked if you can do it.

37
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,610
Yes, Father.

38
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,980
During the last personnel discussion, I told the King

39
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:38,590
that I wanted the position of Commander of the Right Army.

40
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:43,340
But was not Suk Beon eyeing that position?

41
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,050
I cannot let a key military position fall into Suk Beon's hands.

42
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,330
He is someone the King trusts.

43
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,020
It is just one position of the Right Army Commander.

44
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:55,820
Military authority is something that must not be ceded, even a single position.

45
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,510
The Crown Prince must study with the Seoyeongwan
[Seogyeongwan: The officials in charge of educating the Crown Prince]

46
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,620
three times a day,
[Yi Je, Grand Prince Yangnyeong]

47
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,940
at morning, day, and evening.

48
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,480
Yes.

49
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,210
Great work.

50
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,820
According to Yin-Yang and the Five Elements, yellow represents the center of the earth.

51
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:37,520
It symbolizes imperial authority, as it is considered to be closest to the sun.

52
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,520
Thus, we chose a light yellow color dyed with gardenia.

53
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,410
Did you personally select this color?

54
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,750
Your Highness the Crown Prince,

55
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,940
we have prepared a gift for you so that you may become a brave king.

56
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:02,580
Wow, it is a falcon tail tag.

57
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,920
You should use it during falconry.

58
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,550
How about you give it a shake?

59
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,890
<i>His Majesty is here.</i>

60
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:26,930
Should you not be at Taepyeonggwan right now?

61
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:31,280
We were curious about his study environment at Changdeokgung,

62
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,000
so we took a moment to visit.

63
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:41,280
So, I hear you are reading the Great Learning.

64
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,360
Yes.
- Then,

65
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,250
you must know the meaning behind the name Seongjeonggak.

66
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,790
Seongeui, which signifies the sincerity in one's approach to studies,

67
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:51,160
and jeongshim, which signifies the right mindset.

68
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,000
The name comes from the first syllables of each word.

69
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,120
That is right.

70
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,630
This is how the qualities of a king are cultivated.

71
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:03,440
He must take after you, Your Majesty.

72
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:10,780
Wait, is that not a falcon tail tag?

73
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,660
Give it to me.

74
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,820
You are the Crown Prince who will one day be responsible for a nation.

75
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,640
Reading all day would not be enough.

76
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,320
How could you consider going falcon hunting?

77
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,050
I will just hold onto it.

78
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:37,710
If you hold onto it, you will want to go out hunting.

79
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,460
Give it to me.

80
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:51,720
Your Majesty, how about you give it to him as a reward?

81
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:57,290
Je, how many sijins will you read in here every day?
[Sijin: Around 2 hours]

82
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,400
Two sijins?

83
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,670
Five sijins.

84
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,820
It will be five sijins.

85
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:07,910
If I hear that you read for five sijins every day for a week,

86
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,750
I will return it to you then.

87
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,540
Yes, Father.

88
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,470
Both of you.

89
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,300
You must no longer

90
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,230
make personal visits to the Crown Prince

91
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,960
nor give him luxurious gifts.

92
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,910
Wait, Your Majesty.

93
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:39,690
Must we be mindful of His Majesty even about such matters?

94
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:42,780
The Crown Prince grew up in our care since he was young.

95
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,970
It is this mindset of yours that is the problem!

96
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:49,900
The Crown Prince is the foundation of this nation.

97
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:54,020
Take extra care so no such problems arise in the future.

98
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,830
<i>Yes.</i>

99
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:02,830
<i>They acquired so many slaves that they are running short on grain in their household.</i>

100
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,930
<i>The household of my brothers-in-law gained so many slaves that</i>

101
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:08,470
<i>they are running short on grain?</i>

102
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,680
<i>Yes.</i>

103
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,020
<i>Does the Queen know about this?</i>

104
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,380
<i>I do not think she knows.</i>

105
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:19,210
<i>Your Majesty, Anseonggun is here.</i>

106
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,830
Your Majesty, did you summon me?

107
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,360
The number of slaves in the Queen's family will have suddenly increased.

108
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,710
Secretly investigate this matter.

109
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,990
Outside of the Office of the Inspector General?

110
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,740
The Inspector General is an ally of the Min family.

111
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

112
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,670
Finally, the King has given me the order.

113
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:55,920
A few hundred probably suddenly became slaves of the Min family.

114
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,830
I will investigate this thoroughly.

115
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:03,480
Then, will you become the Right Army Commander, Anseonggun?

116
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,910
Since you set the table for me like this,

117
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:08,880
I should make sure it happens.

118
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,110
Then,

119
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:20,600
what do you want me to do for you now?

120
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,230
Later.

121
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,540
Your Excellency.

122
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:53,710
Anseonggun is investigating like that after receiving the King's orders?

123
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,450
Yes, Your Excellency.

124
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,450
What are you going to report to the King?

125
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,250
It is not your business.

126
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,800
- Come down.
- How impudent of you!

127
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,690
- Impudent?
- You must be unaware that times are changing.

128
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,300
Let me down.

129
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:40,260
I received orders from His Majesty.

130
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,910
Even so, you should have told us first.

131
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,650
You should have hidden it and covered it up for us!

132
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,660
I am not a subject of the Min family.

133
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:51,100
- I am saying we are comrades.
- Comrades?

134
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:57,580
Is that more important than feudal loyalty?

135
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:00,280
Then, are you blameless, Anseonggun?

136
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,620
I am...

137
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,480
I am blameless.

138
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,970
You chicken rib of an official!
[Chicken rib: Slang for something useless but hard to discard]

139
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:19,440
Chicken rib? Did you just call me a chicken rib?

140
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,050
That is right! Chicken rib!

141
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:24,820
A damn chicken rib that is untouchable despite being

142
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:29,240
involved in power abuse and corruption because of the Queen.

143
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,790
What are you doing!

144
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,420
There was a wretched fight in front of Changdeokgung front gate.

145
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:54,890
And they were two meritorious subjects fighting over a position.

146
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:58,290
That is how I will report this to the King.

147
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:03,800
I will cover up this matter.

148
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,040
However,

149
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,410
I cannot do that for nothing.

150
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,040
Yeoseonggun.

151
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:17,290
- Yes.
- Give up on the Right Army Commander position.

152
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:19,070
Your Excellency!

153
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:23,540
Anseonggun.

154
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,660
Yes.

155
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:30,220
Promise me that you will not seek the position of Right Army Commander.

156
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:38,190
Yeoseonggun, you should answer me first.

157
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,090
Giving up on that position...

158
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:44,080
That is no big deal for me.

159
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,110
However,

160
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:49,970
Anseonggun has been secretly investigating me.

161
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,200
I received orders from the King.

162
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,400
When the capital was moved to Hanyang, countless commoners lost their homes.

163
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,230
We simply took them in.

164
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:01,350
We could not just take them in for nothing, so we had them work.

165
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:05,080
Then, why would they feel wronged and seek out the authorities?

166
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:10,640
And why would the authorities cover this up and fail to investigate it?

167
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,850
That is because you are Her Majesty's younger brothers.

168
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,570
What did you say?

169
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:22,520
I am merely following the King's orders.

170
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,100
I hear among those following Your Excellency,

171
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,340
someone has been eyeing the position of Right Army Commander.

172
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:37,020
Even if it is Your Excellency, I will not overlook this.

173
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,740
That man...

174
00:13:56,430 --> 00:14:00,430
By sending tribute and receiving return gifts,

175
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:04,760
I expect the trust between Joseon and Ming will be solidified.

176
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,580
That is an admirable thought.

177
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,770
As was requested, we will send 10,000 horses,

178
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:14,830
a specialty of Joseon, to the Emperor.

179
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:18,790
The Emperor will surely be greatly pleased.

180
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,270
[Hwang Eom: A Joseon-born eunuch and envoy of Ming]

181
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:24,570
What will Ming send us as a return gift?

182
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:27,610
We should clarify this from the start,

183
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:30,580
so there are no misunderstandings later.

184
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,710
Sounds good.

185
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,800
We will proceed as such.

186
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:40,420
Now, this is Ming's request.

187
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,910
You will need to send us tribute brides.

188
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,810
Send tribute brides?

189
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:50,470
At least 50.

190
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:59,880
Would not such a price be necessary to confirm the trust between Ming and Joseon?

191
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,900
Why is the Ming following Yuan's evil practices?

192
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:13,000
His Majesty tried to request a lot as a return gift to strengthen our nation's finances.

193
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,020
But Hwang Eom saw through all this and

194
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,600
caught him off guard by requesting tribute brides.

195
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,960
In the end, the King was outmaneuvered.

196
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,990
Yes, it appears so.

197
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,590
What are the officials doing while things have reached this point?

198
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:32,130
His Majesty has issued a silence decree.

199
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:33,360
A silence decree?

200
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,060
The Saganwon was made an independent entity
[Saganwon: Office responsible for criticism and correction of officials]

201
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,820
so they spoke what needed to be said.

202
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:41,790
If you make a bigger deal out of this, you would reveal to the world that

203
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,900
the King fell for Hwang Eom's schemes.

204
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,230
You should turn a blind eye.

205
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:18,230
Sending tribute brides to Ming is a settled matter.

206
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:20,950
I told you not to bring it up!

207
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:28,810
The Queen said if the new nation's tribute system is no different from Goryeo's,

208
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:33,660
what was the point of establishing a new nation?

209
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,170
I did not instigate the petition.

210
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:42,450
All I did was help them to see the truth.

211
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:43,620
Help them see the truth?

212
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,440
Before you ascended to the throne,

213
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,260
you clearly stated that there will no longer be any more tribute brides.

214
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:53,140
That promise must be kept.

215
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,330
Do you think this was an easy decision for me?

216
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:58,180
I thought about this over and over again!

217
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,180
You should have held your ground to the end.

218
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,250
You should have reduced the number by even one!

219
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,940
There is no other way!

220
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,640
I will find a way.

221
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,720
So, entrust me with this.

222
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,050
No, Your Majesty.

223
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:15,790
This is not for the Queen to handle-

224
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,680
Then, six months.

225
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,920
If you fail to do so,

226
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:29,670
could you endure six months in the Queen's palace in seclusion?

227
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,520
Yes.

228
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,570
I will do so.

229
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,040
This is silk from Ming.

230
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,150
I hope this pleases you, Your Majesty.

231
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,790
The silk you gifted me last time

232
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:53,650
is only used by the imperial family, even in Ming.

233
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:56,840
How was this at your house?

234
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:00,450
One of our elders was a Taebu Gamtaegam in the Yuan dynasty.

235
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,520
[Taebu Gamtaegam: An official responsible for managing prices and goods]

236
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,580
The one who offered his daughter as a tribute to the Yuan imperial family.

237
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:10,630
Yes. My grandmother, who was the Crown Princess of Yuan,

238
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,830
committed suicide after Ming took over the empire.

239
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:17,760
Emperor Wen of Ming found her actions commendable

240
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,920
and sent various gifts to our family.

241
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:25,940
The Emperor of Ming sent gifts just because he found her actions commendable?

242
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:29,390
And only to your family at that?

243
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:33,290
Is that not strange?

244
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,170
What did you send to Emperor Wen?

245
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:46,660
If you did not do so, why would the Emperor of Ming

246
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:51,150
send gifts to some family of Joseon.

247
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:53,180
- Your Majesty.
- Were you trying to

248
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:57,910
create connections also in the imperial family of Ming after Yuan's fall?

249
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:03,020
I will not ask what you sent and why you sent them.

250
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:07,100
Hwang Eom is the one who handles gifts offered to the imperial family.

251
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,470
- Yes.
- Hwang Eom is skilled with people and intelligent,

252
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,240
but he is greedy.

253
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:18,500
I do not believe Hwang Eom delivered all of your gifts.

254
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,390
That is correct.

255
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:26,620
I plan to use this as leverage to resolve the issue of the tribute brides.

256
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:30,010
Yes, Your Majesty.

257
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,800
Your Majesty.

258
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:44,320
You are here.

259
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,940
What orders do you have for me?

260
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,450
I need your help with something.

261
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,960
I will help you.

262
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,030
You say you will help me without even asking any questions.

263
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:02,330
If Your Majesty needs me, I will do anything for you.

264
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:17,910
<i>Emperor Wen of Ming does not allow any mistakes.</i>

265
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:20,520
<i>These are his envoys.</i>

266
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,150
<i>They will be on high alert and try not to make any mistakes.</i>

267
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:29,010
<i>Your job is to make them let down their guard.</i>

268
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:32,140
She is Lady Consortship Sukeui serving His Majesty.

269
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,170
[Sukeui: Royal Consort Rank 2]

270
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:37,240
I hear Her Majesty left the palace.

271
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,020
I will serve you until then.

272
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,770
Her Majesty has come,

273
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:24,930
but she asks to see you separately.

274
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:30,970
I feel that bringing the Queen here is not proper, either.

275
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:34,600
I will serve you two well.

276
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:44,430
I prepared gifts for the two of you.

277
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:05,430
Why do you think the Queen asked to meet with only Taegam Hwang?

278
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:13,180
I will keep this a secret from the Taegam.

279
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:18,130
I know you speak the Joseon language well since you are from Sinuiju.

280
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:22,370
I would like to talk with you in the Joseon language.

281
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:25,160
Please allow me to do so.

282
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,860
Yes.

283
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:40,370
This is familiar, is it not?

284
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:44,650
Princess Jeongui's family has connections in the imperial family of Ming.

285
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:48,830
Thus, they offered gifts to Emperor Wen,

286
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:52,640
but something like this one was not delivered.

287
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,550
There is no proof that they offered this to him.

288
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:00,810
The father of Princess Jeongui here

289
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:05,070
sent a letter stating that he sent such and such as gifts,

290
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:10,710
but he received a response stating that they did not receive so and so.

291
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:17,320
It is true.

292
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,050
What will you do?

293
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:21,970
Will you find it for us?

294
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:26,960
Or shall we tell the Emperor directly?

295
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,980
What are you trying to do here?

296
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:40,090
The request to send 50 tribute brides...

297
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:42,800
Is that the Emperor's request?

298
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:47,640
The Emperor clearly stated that Ming was different from Yuan.

299
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,750
He also declared that his take on tribute brides was different.

300
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:54,140
I just found it very strange.

301
00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:01,510
Perhaps someone increased the number of tribute brides for their personal gain.

302
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:05,030
What is it you want?

303
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:10,590
All you have to do is enjoy yourself and return with a light heart.

304
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,430
And take the gift you should take with you.

305
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:24,790
Thank you for providing such great hospitality.

306
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:28,530
The Emperor will be especially pleased

307
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:32,000
with your tribute of 10,000 horses.

308
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,130
And with regards to the tribute brides,

309
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:42,740
let us discuss that again later in the future.

310
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,840
Discuss it again later?

311
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,120
Then what about the number?

312
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,360
It will not be the same as before.

313
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:27,120
Have you ever seen

314
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:33,460
someone play geomungo better than you?

315
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,670
Yes, Your Majesty.

316
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,940
Did you not get jealous?

317
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:43,240
I still have much to learn, so...

318
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:17,490
Are you saying Yeoseonggun and Anseonggun fought over that?

319
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:18,750
Yes.

320
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:22,580
Anseonggun merely followed His Majesty's orders.

321
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:26,320
Therefore, Yeoseonggun was at fault.

322
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,100
Pardon?

323
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,330
Your Majesty!

324
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:31,660
Set free all the commoners who became slaves,

325
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,390
and pay them for their labor.

326
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:38,850
Also, I will ask the King to punish you both for your wrongdoings.

327
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:41,670
Your Majesty, why are you doing this?

328
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:42,840
What do you mean, why?

329
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,380
We put our lives and family on the line

330
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:49,330
in order to make Prince Jeongan king!

331
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:52,000
- Yeoganggun.
- Still, I kept quiet because you said to.

332
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,590
And yet, I cannot even do this much?

333
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:56,120
You cannot.

334
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,350
You must not.

335
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:00,810
All the other meritorious subjects have engaged in equal or worse things!

336
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:03,950
You must not, especially because you are the younger brothers of the Queen!

337
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:06,810
We are the younger brothers of the Queen, so why can we not gain more?

338
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:09,560
Why do we have to be more careful and give up more?

339
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,120
If so, we did not need to gain power!

340
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,830
No matter what anyone says,

341
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:17,970
half of this power belongs to our Min family!

342
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,970
What is the power to you both?

343
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:24,170
Is it to have more, to enjoy more, and to wield more privilege?

344
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:27,000
Whether you can have what is in front of you or not.

345
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,400
That is power.

346
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:33,880
For me, power means something different.

347
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,670
I wanted to create a new world that was different from Goryeo.

348
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:39,800
That is why I need power.

349
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,350
With all due respect,

350
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:47,090
who are you to dare dream such things, Your Majesty?

351
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:52,380
You do not have the power to change this world, Your Majesty.

352
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,780
Is that what you believe?

353
00:27:55,780 --> 00:28:00,160
I will prove it to you.

354
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,130
Open.

355
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,570
Your Majesty, what brings you here at this time of night?

356
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:18,260
Has he gone to bed?

357
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,200
<i>Not yet.</i>

358
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,630
<i>Go away for a moment.</i>

359
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:24,120
Pardon?

360
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,130
Yes.

361
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:47,070
My younger brothers increased their personal slaves through illegal means.

362
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:51,650
Investigate them thoroughly and punish them severely.

363
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,700
Did you come here to say that?

364
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,270
Enter.

365
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,510
If I sit face-to-face with you and look at your expression,

366
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:10,170
I do not think I can ask you this, so I will ask from here.

367
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:14,520
What is it?

368
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:20,390
Why did Father try to harm you?

369
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:22,540
Father believed that

370
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:27,540
the Joseon he dreamed of will never come to fruition

371
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,860
while I was king.

372
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,440
But, that day at Wonjung Port,

373
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,620
Your Majesty managed to change Father's heart.

374
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:43,670
How did you do it?

375
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:45,360
In the end,

376
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:49,430
I promised him that I would

377
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:54,390
make sure to build the Joseon

378
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:56,510
my father dreamed of.

379
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:02,100
Was that all?

380
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,620
And...

381
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:10,940
I said I will eliminate any obstacles

382
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,310
in building that Joseon.

383
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,810
Are my younger brothers

384
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:22,240
included in those obstacles?

385
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,040
<i>That is so.</i>

386
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,920
By chance...

387
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,160
If by chance...

388
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:41,620
my younger brothers get in Your Majesty's way with the help of the Crown Prince,

389
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:44,200
what will you do?

390
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:49,630
Will you kill them?

391
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:55,640
Including the Crown Prince?

392
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:06,380
As my father has done,

393
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:10,030
I, too, will walk the same path.

394
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:28,980
<i>Do you, perhaps even subconsciously, consider this nation, Joseon,</i>

395
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:32,400
<i>to belong to the Min family?</i>

396
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,000
<i>That hatred is so deep</i>

397
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,880
<i>that the sorrow of having to kill my own son is my cause!</i>

398
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,320
Your Majesty!

399
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,210
Father...

400
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:13,800
Why did you summon us?

401
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:18,340
What am I to you?

402
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,020
You are the pillar of our Min family.

403
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:30,790
And you are also our sister, of whom we are proud.

404
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:40,170
You are the Queen of this nation.

405
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,010
From now on,

406
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:48,590
I will distance myself from the Min family.

407
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,290
- Pardon?
- What do you mean?

408
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:56,100
It means that I cannot both be a Queen from the Min family

409
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:01,400
and a Queen who becomes a parent figure to the people.

410
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,860
The Queen seems to have changed.

411
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:10,200
The Queen was always like that.

412
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:14,590
We just need to walk our own path for our family.

413
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,350
All these petitions are saying

414
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:57,810
Yeoseonggun needs to be appointed as the Right Army Commander.

415
00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:00,650
Did you all come for the same purpose?

416
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:03,950
Yeoseonggun has already held power over the military for many years.

417
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:07,880
There are countless men willing to give their lives for Yeoseonggun in the military,

418
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,720
and they seek to follow his will exclusively.

419
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,520
Please entrust him with the military position.

420
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,410
The Min family, including Yeoseonggun,

421
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:17,900
oppressed hundreds of commoners, making them household slaves.

422
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,760
Afraid of their overwhelming power,

423
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,170
the local authorities failed to conduct investigations.

424
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:23,930
With such corruption and abuse of power,

425
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:26,240
why do you ask me to entrust him with an important position?

426
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:31,180
Yeoseonggun's minor faults are far overshadowed by the greater merits of Her Majesty.

427
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:36,340
The Queen protected the women of Joseon from Hwang Eom's outrageous demands.

428
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,130
As word of this noble act spread,

429
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:41,800
many officials have come to support and follow the Queen.

430
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:47,140
Therefore, please entrust Yeoseonggun with the military position.

431
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:50,560
<i>Please entrust Yeoseonggun with the military position!</i>

432
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:56,130
<i>Your Majesty, please entrust Yeoseonggun with the military position!</i>

433
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:59,800
<i>Please listen to our plea.</i>

434
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:06,250
Your Majesty, please listen to our plea!

435
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:10,460
<i>Please listen to our plea!</i>

436
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:20,760
You are supposed to protect the King in the palace,

437
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,800
yet you have come forth to threaten me.

438
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,400
- General!
- Yes!

439
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:44,380
Spare the one to whom you will be loyal and slay the other.

440
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,210
Do it now!

441
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,970
Your Majesty!

442
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:52,590
Your Majesty!

443
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,550
The commanders are all my commanders,

444
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:02,540
and the soldiers are all my soldiers.

445
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:06,020
And yet, when you are supposed to protect me,

446
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:08,950
you have come forth to protect Yeoseonggun.

447
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:12,590
Are you aware of Yeoseonggun's presence

448
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:15,930
but unaware of my presence!

449
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,960
Your Majesty! It is me, Court Lady Seo.

450
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,550
Open the doors.

451
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:34,590
Your Majesty, His Majesty has summoned the court to the Main Hall.

452
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,560
- What is the matter?
- In front of the Main Hall,

453
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,350
100 officers of the Haengsajik who support Yeoseonggun have gathered.
[Haensajik: Military officers responsible for defending the capital]

454
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:41,490
- What?
- Even the Crown Prince

455
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:44,510
has been summoned to the Main Hall.

456
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,550
Crown Prince!

457
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:06,640
I will bequeath my throne to the Crown Prince.

458
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,400
Your Majesty!

459
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,700
Your Majesty!

460
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,370
You must not, Your Majesty!

461
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:34,960
Please tell us the reason for this!

462
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:44,630
Please withdraw your command!

463
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:49,000
<i>Please withdraw your command!</i>

464
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,230
Your Majesty!

465
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:04,270
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

466
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:20,450
We need to set up a Naejaechu.

467
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:22,750
If the young Crown Prince ascends to the throne,
[Naejaechu: A select group of officials to handle crucial state affairs]

468
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:25,070
he will need ministers to assist him.

469
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:27,720
We should set it up quickly tonight

470
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,470
and meet with His Majesty early in the morning.

471
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:33,500
But what if His Majesty's intention...

472
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,360
His Majesty's intention? What does that matter?

473
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,130
If we miss our chance, he will use the excuse

474
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:41,790
that we unjustly increased our slaves and expel us all.

475
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:43,390
Yes.

476
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:46,590
The King has already spoken the word.

477
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:49,770
And the Crown Prince is already one of us.

478
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:52,120
You all should increase the palace's security

479
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,230
and notify me of any movements inside the palace immediately.

480
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:56,410
Yes.

481
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:58,770
Also, though the hour is late,

482
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:02,030
tell like-minded ministers to gather at my house without delay.

483
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:04,350
- Yes.
- Hyungnim.

484
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,500
- Should we not tell Her Majesty-
- Not yet.

485
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,790
It is not the time yet.

486
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:19,680
Naejaechu?

487
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,000
Yes.

488
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:26,360
I guess I can discern who is traitorous through this.

489
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,290
Excluding all the guards who are loyal to the Min family,

490
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:31,680
secretly gather up the soldiers tomorrow morning.

491
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,470
- Yes.
- Also,

492
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:39,100
find out who enters the Min family's house tonight.

493
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:43,810
Yes, Your Majesty.

494
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:19,330
It is only until he decrees that he will withdraw his command.

495
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:21,740
Let us wait together until then.

496
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:24,830
Yes, Mother.

497
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:27,450
Your Majesty!

498
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:31,180
The King has sent the royal seal to the Eastern Palace*!
[Eastern Palace: The Crown Prince's residence]

499
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,900
<i>Thank you for coming.</i>

500
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,820
<i>You made it.</i>

501
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,790
As you have probably heard,

502
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:02,270
His Majesty said he would bequeath his throne.

503
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:05,210
The hour is late, but let us set up a Naejaechu

504
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:08,500
and present it to His Majesty early in the morning.

505
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,870
When the order is given, you must capture every single one of them.

506
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,570
Yes.

507
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:18,250
The King is unwilling to back down.

508
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:23,260
This is to cut off

509
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:26,330
my two younger brothers.

510
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:28,270
Is that correct?

511
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:39,620
Tonight, I hear they will set up a Naejaechu

512
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:43,110
and seek a private audience early tomorrow morning.

513
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:47,640
His Majesty will secretly have troops on standby to monitor the situation.

514
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:52,570
Especially since the one put forth by Yeoganggun and Yeoseonggun is the Crown Prince.

515
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:44,830
Your Majesty, Her Majesty and the Crown Prince are here.

516
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:47,810
It appears he has already gone to bed.

517
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:48,960
Move aside.

518
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,790
Your Majesty.

519
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:04,430
Father, please withdraw your command.

520
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:09,090
Queen, why are you doing this?

521
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:18,070
The Crown Prince is still lacking in education,

522
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:21,180
so he cannot handle the duties of a king.

523
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:23,170
Then,

524
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:26,180
you can take over the regency, Queen.

525
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:29,310
[Regency: The eldest of the royal family exercises power if the king is too young]

526
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:34,210
Give the royal seal to His Majesty.

527
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:49,050
What are you doing!

528
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:51,300
I need to perform the Royal Sericulture Ceremony.

529
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,620
The Royal Sericulture Ceremony?

530
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:56,250
I need to first complete a ritual of making an offering to the deity of the silkworm.

531
00:43:56,250 --> 00:44:01,110
To perform the ritual properly, Your Majesty's royal seal is absolutely necessary.

532
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:04,950
I already said I would pass the throne on to the Crown Prince.

533
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:07,250
Please withdraw the command to pass the throne

534
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:09,910
and instead grant me the royal seal for the ritual.

535
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:12,390
- Queen!
- If not,

536
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:14,460
shall I take the Crown Prince

537
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:18,010
and go to my family's house where they are setting up the Naejaechu?

538
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:23,340
- What did you say?
- Will you really have me and the Crown Prince

539
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:26,690
at the end of your sword?

540
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:39,730
I am not trying to kill you.

541
00:44:39,730 --> 00:44:42,580
I am doing this to save you.

542
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,830
When a king shows even the slightest sign of weakness,

543
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:49,730
his subjects will try to suppress the king.

544
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:52,550
They will try to suppress him and take control.

545
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:56,180
If you fall under their control, the royalty and the nation will fall apart.

546
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:58,570
Father, please, the royal seal-

547
00:44:58,570 --> 00:44:59,880
I, your father!

548
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,950
I had already memorized the Four Books and Five Classics at your age

549
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:05,530
and determined to govern the world!

550
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:07,480
Court Lady Kim!

551
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:12,090
- Yes.
- Escort the Crown Prince to the Eastern Palace.

552
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:14,250
Quickly escort him!

553
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:42,960
What will you do

554
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,560
if my brothers come in the morning, putting forth the Crown Prince?

555
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:51,790
If they come and say they have set up the Naejaechu,

556
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:54,730
so you can step down from your throne.

557
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:58,750
Then, will you grant that?

558
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:10,920
Have you ever thought

559
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:15,930
why I said I would

560
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,370
pass the throne?

561
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:23,280
Yeoseonggun brought military officers and

562
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,540
refused to give up his military position

563
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:28,020
by showing off his power and threatening me.

564
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:31,080
The king must have been a joke to him.

565
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,590
Then, you should have settled the matter then and there.

566
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:35,820
How can I settle the matter

567
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:39,510
when I do not even know how many hide and support the Min family?

568
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:42,080
You should draw your sword

569
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:45,500
only when the enemy

570
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,840
has clearly entered your field of vision.

571
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,920
Did you just say enemy?

572
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,790
This is why...

573
00:46:56,790 --> 00:47:00,850
I am passing the throne since I am lacking as king.

574
00:47:00,850 --> 00:47:05,990
Then, a bloody war will break out with our Crown Prince

575
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,070
caught in the middle.

576
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:11,010
If that happens, nobody

577
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:14,880
can guarantee the safety of our Crown Prince.

578
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:21,140
Withdraw your command about passing the throne.

579
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:35,530
I will take the Crown Prince and go to my family's house.

580
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:39,360
Are you saying you will ultimately fight against me

581
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:42,030
instead of caring for me?

582
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:46,520
I must protect the Crown Prince.

583
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:03,090
I will return if you grant me the royal seal, allowing me to lead the Royal Sericulture Ceremony.

584
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:06,010
I will wait until the Hour of Swine tomorrow.

585
00:48:07,110 --> 00:48:09,270
What will you do after waiting?

586
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,600
I will personally set up the Naejaechu

587
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:17,990
and come to execute your command of passing the throne.

588
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:37,170
Your Majesty, why are you doing this?

589
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:39,990
Either the King withdraws his command

590
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:44,200
or the Crown Prince inherits the throne right now.

591
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,450
It is one or the other.

592
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:11,270
Notify him.

593
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:12,550
No, I cannot.

594
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:17,240
- What did you say?
- His Majesty said not to let anyone in.

595
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,240
Your Majesty, it is me, Chae Ryeong.

596
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,870
<i>- Your Highness.
</i> - Your Majesty!

597
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:26,280
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

598
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:38,150
Your Majesty.

599
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:39,720
Court Lady Seo.

600
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,580
Your Highness.

601
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:43,320
I delivered your orders.

602
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:47,500
Everyone who gathered to set up the Naejaechu have all scattered.

603
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,730
- Great work.
- But why...

604
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:51,380
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

605
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:53,440
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

606
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,100
Why...

607
00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:06,420
<i>Your Majesty, please withdraw your command that you will pass the throne.</i>

608
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:09,870
What about the royal seal?

609
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:13,880
He sent it back to the Eastern Palace early in the morning.

610
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:17,040
I hear the Crown Prince went to Yeoheung Buwongun's house. At this rate-

611
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,900
Quiet!

612
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:27,230
<i>Your Majesty, please withdraw your command that you will pass the throne.</i>

613
00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:31,420
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

614
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:35,760
- Notify him.
- He said not to let anyone in until he gave the command.

615
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:45,020
<i>Your Majesty, please withdraw your command that you will pass the throne.</i>

616
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,220
Did you stay up all night?

617
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:52,410
I went home briefly during the night and came back early in the morning.

618
00:50:52,410 --> 00:51:00,100
<i>Your Majesty, please withdraw your command that you will pass the throne.</i>

619
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:07,830
<i>Your Majesty, please withdraw your command that you will pass the throne.</i>

620
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:09,470
All right.

621
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:18,730
<i>Your Majesty, please withdraw your command that you will pass the throne.</i>

622
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:27,460
<i>Your Majesty, please withdraw your command that you will...</i>

623
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,740
Will the King really pass the throne?

624
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:38,250
At first, he was trying to find those loyal to the Min family and eradicate them...

625
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:42,050
Last night, the Queen went to her private residence.

626
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:43,930
With that said,

627
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:48,200
things have gotten much more complicated.

628
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:51,800
Your Majesty said you will pass the throne,

629
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:54,710
and you gave them justification to act by doing so.

630
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:57,660
- I know that.
- In the palace,

631
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:00,560
there are many who follow Yeoheung Buwongun.

632
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:04,460
Many high-ranking military officers are loyal to Yeoganggun and Yeoseonggun.

633
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:05,950
I know that.

634
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:08,740
If the Queen leads the charge in setting up Naejaechu,

635
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:11,560
it will be much more problematic than with Yeoganggun and Yeoesonggun.

636
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:13,640
The Queen is the Crown Prince's mother.

637
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:16,880
I know that. I know all this!

638
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,980
Your Majesty.

639
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:26,350
If Her Majesty comes after setting up Naejaechu,

640
00:52:26,350 --> 00:52:28,920
will you be able to handle it?

641
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:35,440
If you say you can handle it, then Her Majesty will get hurt.

642
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,690
But if you cannot handle it,

643
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:40,620
you will indeed have to pass the throne.

644
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:04,050
Since the Queen says the Royal Sericulture Ceremony is urgent,

645
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:07,090
I will have to grant her permission to do the relevant ritual.

646
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:13,520
I will grant her the royal seal.

647
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,850
Tell her that.

648
00:53:15,850 --> 00:53:18,870
Your grace knows no bounds, Your Majesty.

649
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:33,830
Whether I go back to the palace or not,

650
00:53:33,830 --> 00:53:36,850
you should renounce all of your official positions

651
00:53:36,850 --> 00:53:39,530
and relinquish your military power.

652
00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:40,680
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

653
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,730
You took in hundreds of commoners as household slaves!

654
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:45,700
Should you not take responsibility for that?

655
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:50,290
Is that...

656
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,650
the will of the King?

657
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:56,090
It is the will of the King,

658
00:53:56,090 --> 00:53:58,430
and my will as well.

659
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:03,060
Your Majesty.

660
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:06,140
You can leave.

661
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:11,150
I think she is sure that the King will not pass the throne.

662
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:13,410
Her Majesty?

663
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:19,490
Then, what will happen to us for trying to set up the Naejaechu?

664
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:24,200
We were too rash.

665
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:28,200
But the King definitely showed signs of weakness.

666
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:32,880
- If we take advantage of this and-
- Only if the Queen is fully on our side.

667
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:37,600
Thus, if that is not the case, there is nothing we can do.

668
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:40,960
First, as Her Majesty said,

669
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:44,450
we will have to lower ourselves and stay quiet like we are dead.

670
00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:50,790
I know there are

671
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:54,560
hundreds of commoners who became slaves unjustly at my brothers' homes.

672
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:57,390
But after thinking about it calmly,

673
00:54:57,390 --> 00:55:00,690
I do not think my brothers are the only ones involved.

674
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:02,720
What do you think?

675
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:06,590
As the court moved to Hanyang, there was a lack of housing.

676
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:10,360
So, those with power seized the people's houses.

677
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:14,070
- Is that so?
- As a result, the people who lost their houses

678
00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:18,960
became dependent on powerful families and ended up as slaves.

679
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,490
Who do you mean by powerful families?

680
00:55:20,490 --> 00:55:22,920
Powerful meritorious subjects,

681
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,080
especially the royal family members.

682
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,140
Powerful meritorious subjects,

683
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:28,370
especially the royal family members?

684
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:32,410
Among those put forward by the powerful royal relatives,

685
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:35,280
there is someone from the Kim family of Bamgol.

686
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:39,150
The Kim family of Bamgol?

687
00:55:39,150 --> 00:55:43,890
<i>I hear she is also a distant royal relative.</i>

688
00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:53,320
Do you have any idea which powerful royal relative is working with Kim of Bamgol?

689
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:57,680
They cannot be doing this on their own without a powerful backer.

690
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:01,060
I will look into it.

691
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:02,600
Also,

692
00:56:03,430 --> 00:56:10,290
by chance, are my younger brothers connected to this Kim of Bamgol at all?

693
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:13,790
This is a royal relative trying to expand their influence.

694
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:17,410
Will they bring in the King's in-laws?

695
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,940
Your Majesty.

696
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:27,100
Your Majesty, the Chief Eunuch came from the Main Hall.

697
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:33,240
The King withdrew his command to pass the throne.

698
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:37,590
Thus, he requests that you return to the palace now.

699
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:48,490
[I grant permission for the Royal Sericulture Ceremony]

700
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:55,070
She came back to the palace immediately after hearing your message.

701
00:56:55,070 --> 00:56:57,740
She is waiting for you at the Queen's palace.

702
00:57:00,270 --> 00:57:01,810
Your Majesty!

703
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:10,260
I have figured out everyone who gathered at Buwongun's house last night.

704
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:13,740
Why are you not giving me any further orders?

705
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:17,880
I will watch them a bit longer.

706
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:22,790
Then, let me have the position of Right Army Commander.

707
00:57:25,310 --> 00:57:27,380
If you tell me to become a loyal dog,

708
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:30,150
I will do so.

709
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,960
I will consider it.

710
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:00,830
Did you have to do this?

711
00:58:00,830 --> 00:58:05,570
I had no other way to stop Your Majesty.

712
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:10,080
You abandoned me and left.

713
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:14,500
Not even for a single moment have I abandoned Your Majesty.

714
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:18,640
Not even for a single moment have you abandoned me?

715
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:23,550
I have never abandoned you, even for a single moment...

716
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:26,390
I always stood by your side,

717
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:30,470
but where were you, Your Majesty?

718
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:41,290
I feel like an island floating alone

719
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:45,480
in the vast ocean of my subjects.

720
00:58:47,930 --> 00:58:49,680
Your Majesty.

721
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:57,010
I made my brothers relinquish all of their military authority.

722
00:58:57,010 --> 00:59:00,070
I will also remove them from the Crown Prince's side.

723
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:02,640
What about after you remove them?

724
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:06,800
There are dozens more like Yeoganggun and hundreds more like Yeoseonggun.

725
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:10,880
They are everywhere. The royal relatives, my in-laws, and all over the royal council hall!

726
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:15,750
Could you remove all of them as well?

727
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:19,860
Your Majesty.

728
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,500
[The Queen Who Crowns]

729
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:31,000
♫ <i>Only the moonlight lights up the entire mountain</i> ♫

730
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:41,200
♫ <i>Oh, heavens, holding your breath from being shy</i> ♫

731
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:50,850
♫ <i>Until the day breaks</i> ♫

732
00:59:50,850 --> 01:00:01,160
♫ <i>We are separated, and I sing alone</i> ♫

733
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:05,720
<i>- Who are you?
- I should make him at least ten times the profit.</i>

734
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:09,870
<i>I saw how they lose their homes with my own eyes.</i>

735
01:00:09,870 --> 01:00:12,670
<i>There must be those who are unjustly profiting.</i>

736
01:00:12,670 --> 01:00:16,190
<i>How could a mere woman be allowed to act so recklessly?</i>

737
01:00:16,190 --> 01:00:19,270
<i>I wonder if Queen Seondeok reincarnated would look like that.</i>

738
01:00:19,270 --> 01:00:23,040
<i>You are overstepping your boundaries, Queen.</i>

739
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:26,660
<i>What could he do, even if he is the king?</i>

740
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:31,460
<i>In the worst-case scenario, the Queen must die.</i>
