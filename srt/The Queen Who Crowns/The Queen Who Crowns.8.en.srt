<i>Among those put forward by the powerful royal relatives,</i>

00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:46,170
<i>there is someone from the Kim family of Bamgol.</i>

8

<i>The Kim family of Bamgol?</i>

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,330
<i>I hear she is also a distant royal relative.</i>

10
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:02,260
<i>Do you have any idea which powerful royal relative is working with Kim of Bamgol?</i>

11
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:06,640
<i>They cannot be doing this on their own without a powerful backer.</i>

<i>Your Majesty, I made my brothers relinquish all of their military authority.</i>

21
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,930
<i>I will also remove them from the Crown Prince's side.</i>

22
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,500
<i>What about after you remove them?</i>

23
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,690
<i>There are dozens more like Yeoganggun and hundreds more like Yeoseonggun.</i>

What a great day! So nice!

28
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,510
You must be tired from coming up here.

29
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:14,080
This is a royal relative that I am very close to.

30
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,940
And this is Anseonggun.

31
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,600
My name is Yi Suk Beon.

32
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,270
Say hello.

33
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,030
This is my daughter.

34
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,180
I brought her because I wanted to show her the vast world.

35
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,070
You really care about your daughter.

36
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,060
All right, let us take a look.

37
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,110
All right, let us go.

38
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,350
It is that property.

39
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,890
So, what do you think?

40
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:47,510
I am speechless.

41
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:53,480
However, I hear that His Excellency Ha Ryun also came by.

42
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,600
Well, Ha Ryun is quite lacking in ambition.

43
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,920
I recommended a few houses for him over there.

44
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,240
He asked me to do so under an alias,

45
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,200
so I did that for him.

46
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,090
He is so stingy.

47
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:15,320
Those houses must cost quite a bit.

48
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,730
He was so stingy that I sold it to him at the buying price.

49
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:30,020
Then you should sell to my Anseonggun at half the buying price.

50
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,770
I will just give it to you.

51
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,950
What difference is there if I sell it for half the buying price

52
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,330
or just give it to you for free?

53
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,900
I heard you have been eyeing that property for a long time, Anseonggun.

54
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,960
Thank you.

55
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,510
Shall I do so under an alias?

56
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:51,760
Oh, please do-

57
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,680
That would be so stingy, right?

58
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,600
This woman!

59
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,340
Do you like it?

60
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,340
Yes, it is so pretty.

61
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,350
You should become a precious and beautiful woman.

62
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,160
This is my gift to you.

63
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,960
Thank you!

64
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,920
Let me see.

65
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,560
It suits you well.

66
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,410

Your Majesty.

69
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:54,430
I came to see what the Crown Prince is studying for his royal education.

70
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,420
Where are all the royal educators?

71
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,230
They have not come to work yet.

72
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,500
It is already the Hour of the Horse.
[Hour of the Horse: From 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.]

73
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,720
What happened?

74
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,690
W-Well... t-the thing is...

75
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:11,490
They could not find a house in the city.

76
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,050
What did you say?

77
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:17,480
Officials who have been pushed out of the capital due to housing

78
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,590
now make up half of the administrative offices in the palace.

79
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,130
Not only that,

80
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:23,360
the officials who found housing

81
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,140
are having trouble paying for the houses.

82
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,750
Why...

83
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,960
have you not reported this to me?

84
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,840
- Minister of Commerce.
- Yes.

85
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,180
Investigate in detail how many houses and how much land there are

86
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,670
in the capital and report to me.

87
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:46,630
Yes.

88
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,600
- Minister of Justice.
- Yes.

89
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,720
If the housing prices skyrocketed to the point where officials cannot buy a house,

90
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,660
there must be someone taking in unfair profits.

91
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,480
Investigate this matter in detail.

92
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,850
Yes.

93
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,430
Madam!

94
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,330
Someone is here to see some land.

95
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,160
Madam.

96
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:50,360
I have disturbed Your Majesty's mind over a military position.

97
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,550
Thus, I humbly ask that I may decline

98
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,660
all military positions.

99
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,380
I will accept your commendable intention.

100
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:22,090
I will change the Inspector General to Yi Wan Yeong from Han Sam Geon.

101
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:28,730
It appears he will take this opportunity to eradicate everyone under the Min family's influence.

102
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,130
Kim Nam Su will be made the Left Army Commander,

103
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:35,070
and for the Right Army Commander,

104
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,980
I will appoint Shim Gwi Ryong.

105
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,550
Shim Gwi Ryong.

106
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,850
- Minister of Justice.
- Yes.

107
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,750
Official Kim Cheo Won ignored the grievances of the wronged people

108
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,310
and failed to carry out his duties properly

109
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:01,020
for fear of the powerful Min family.

110
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:05,160
Thus, give him 60 beatings with a rod and revoke his official title.

111
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,600
Yes.

112
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,170
Also, investigate to see if there are other powerful ministers

113
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,680
who made slaves of people who had their houses seized.

114
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,420
After investigating,

115
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:16,230
have them pay labor wages and set the slaves free by a deadline.

116
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:19,000
If there are powerful ministers who do not obey,

117
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,510
they will be given 60 beatings with a rod

118
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:25,290
and I will personally revoke their titles.

119
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,780
I will carry out your command.

120
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,300
Your Majesty, we are deeply moved with gratitude

121
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,770
for withdrawing your intention to abdicate

122
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:36,730
and carefully overseeing the affairs of the state.

123
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:43,610
We shall respond by pledging our unwavering loyalty to Your Majesty's decision.

124
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,580
Bow four times!

125
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,990
Bow.

126
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,900
Bow.

127
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,330
Bow.

128
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:40,420
Namchon, Bukchon, Dongchon, Seochon,

129
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,230
Jungchon, and Ochon.

130
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,680
Sangdae, Hadae, and Yangdae.

131
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,930
These regions have deep connections with my parents and me as well,

132
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:50,750
dating back to the Goryeo period.

133
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,560
Are you saying you have Hanyang in the palm of your hand?

134
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,830
Yes, I have it in the palm of my hand.

135
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,410
But that is not all.

136
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:01,950
I have ties with all the top meritorious subjects

137
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,410
who are royal relatives.

138
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,230
- Ties?
- Close ties formed through

139
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,560
amassing wealth.

140
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,580
Thus, what could he possibly do

141
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,770
in Hanyang...

142
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:19,390
even if he is the king?

143
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:29,240
Your world may have been thus so far,

144
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,230
but the world in which you will live will be different.

145
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:37,160
Thus, you should return to the people all the houses and land

146
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,900
that you unjustly amassed.

147
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:42,640
What if I refuse?

148
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,400
Then, I will have you punished.

149
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,020
Really?

150
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,790
But too bad.

151
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:55,330
"Self-cultivation and family management lead to good governance and societal harmony."

152
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:00,250
Should he not be here by now?

153
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,520
Yes, he is waiting.

154
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,620
Then, bring him here.

155
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,980
Yes.

156
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,890
Why are you here?

157
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,110
You made us lay down our military authority.

158
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,810
Also, to stay away from the Crown Prince.

159
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:51,330
You made us relinquish both power and authority.

160
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:54,220
Then, what would be left for us?

161
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,080
- What did you say?
- We should protect and increase the wealth we have.

162
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,920
Yeoganggun!

163
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,290
I told you that all the other powerful families do it!

164
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:03,100
You two cannot.

165
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,600
I made this clear.

166
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,050
I am-

167
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,620
I am the eldest son in the family.

168
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:12,590
It is my duty to make our family

169
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:16,200
flourish and affluent, not yours.

170
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,390
- Yeoganggun!
- Do you not understand?

171
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:22,010
It is all your fault that things ended up like this.

172
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,490
What did you say?

173
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:26,860
At least you became the Queen.

174
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,310
Yeoganggun.

175
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:32,980
If you will excuse me, I will leave now.

176
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,070
Your Majesty.

177
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,020
Why are you at the library?

178
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:17,170
The Royal Sericulture Ceremony is coming up soon.

179
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:20,970
I thought I should read up on some books on silkworm farming.

180
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,840
You, Royal Consort?

181
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,640
Then, what brings you here, Princess?

182
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,230
It is not your business.

183
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,150
Even if he is your younger brother, Your Majesty,

184
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,160
is it not human nature

185
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,430
to be swayed by an easy way to gain wealth?

186
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,080
Can you take responsibility for your words?

187
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,100
Empty words are worse than not speaking at all.

188
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,550
Yes.

189
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,760
Is that not Court Lady Kim?

190
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:10,760
Go and check.

191
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,050
Yes.

192
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:18,600
Father, I do not want to move.

193
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,550
For just two seoms of rice and one seom of beans?

194
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,940
Even if we got more,

195
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:26,400
it would get taken away by those with more power, anyway.

196
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,920
The nation only changed names from Goryeo to Joseon.

197
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,210
I will go borrow a cart.

198
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:34,180
Did you come to see the house?

199
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,080
It got sold already.

200
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,750
To Kim of Bamgol?

201
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:45,040
No, it was Herb Gatherer Kim.

202
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,870
Herb Gatherer...

203
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,760
Did you say a Herb Gatherer bought this house?

204
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,940
Did they not say the sister he came with works in the palace?

205
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,440
How would I know that?

206
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:03,510
Where were you between the Hours of Sheep and Monkey?

207
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,360
I was at the palace.

208
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,590
You were at the palace...

209
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:10,160
Where in the palace were you?

210
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:16,650
I was not feeling well, so I was resting in my quarters.

211
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,500
In the middle of the day?

212
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:23,870
- Yes.
- I thought I saw you at Jungchon.

213
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:27,030
No, you probably saw wrong.

214
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,580
Is that so?

215
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,010
But...

216
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,560
why are you asking me this?

217
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,430
I was concerned that there may be a problem with your actions.

218
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,510
I will be careful in the future.

219
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,180
Careful about what?

220
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,780
- Pardon?
- About your secretive acts?

221
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:52,220
Or about getting your secretive acts found out?

222
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,770
Your Majesty!

223
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:56,140
You are a court lady of the King's palace.

224
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:59,410
If I discover actions that do not fit that title,

225
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:03,640
I will not forgive you then.

226
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,050
Yes.

227
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,750
Tell His Majesty to come to the Queen's palace tonight.

228
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,610
But the Royal Consort-

229
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:19,570
Yes, I will do so.

230
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,430
Chae Ryeong is sick?

231
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,990
That is so.

232
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:25,500
Where?

233
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:28,840
She has a cold.

234
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,930
If it is a cold, it is fine.

235
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:33,790
No, Your Majesty.

236
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:37,960
The Chief Court Lady said it would be a major problem

237
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,000
if Your Majesty catches it from her.

238
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,930
In that case, yes.

239
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,950
Also,

240
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:51,210
Her Majesty requested your presence tonight.

241
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,330
What did you say?

242
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:03,330
<i>Royal Consort, I will enter.</i>

243
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:12,270
His Majesty is supposedly going to the Queen's palace tonight.

244
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:15,430
- Why?
- A-About that...

245
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:18,210
Because he was told you are sick.

246
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,360
I am...

247
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,870
sick?

248
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,380
Were you surprised that I requested your presence?

249
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,480
Yes.

250
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:02,550
But I feel I may have rushed over here without thinking.

251
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:16,490
Give it to me.

252
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:27,350
Their fights are so fierce, but then they are so affectionate at other times.

253
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,210
What kind of harmony is this?

254
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:31,440
When you sleep together, have children,

255
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,040
and go through many things together,

256
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,460
it creates a bond that you cannot break off.

257
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,710
What is that bond?

258
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,850
It is hard to explain.

259
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,080
There is something like that.

260
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:58,170
I visited Jungchon.

261
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:00,050
Queen!

262
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:02,350
I did not tell you because you would say

263
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:05,880
it is dangerous and not let me go, if I told you in advance.

264
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,420
And?

265
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:12,340
I met the people.

266
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:16,730
I saw with my own eyes how they lost their homes.

267
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:19,010
You are overstepping your boundaries, Queen.

268
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:21,650
- Your Majesty.
- I thought about it.

269
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:24,680
What you said to me last time.

270
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,980
Where do I stand?

271
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:32,460
I will not stand with royal relatives or with meritorious subjects.

272
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:37,100
But neither will I stand with you, Queen.

273
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,980
I will stand in my place

274
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,770
as the king of this nation.

275
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,170
Yes.

276
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:53,360
It appears I have asked a foolish question.

277
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:00,260
<i>Royal Consort, Royal Consort!</i>

278
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,790
Royal Consort!

279
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:08,240
Your Majesty.

280
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,320
I...

281
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,310
I can serve Your Majesty tonight.

282
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,890
I will serve you.

283
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:17,200
- Chae Ryeong.
- Your Majesty!

284
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,970
I am not done speaking with the Queen.

285
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:26,350
Leave.

286
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,620
Your Majesty!

287
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,760
What are you all doing, Court Ladies?

288
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,780
- Escort her back quickly!
- Hurry!

289
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,400
Yes, Court Lady.

290
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,680
Royal Consort.

291
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:55,120
I will stop by here before heading back,

292
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,140
so return to my chambers first.

293
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,500
That is a bit...

294
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,450
Go first.

295
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:05,110
Yes, I understand.

296
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:48,290
Does this geomungo bring you comfort?

297
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:11,770
About the books you were going to read for the Royal Sericulture Ceremony...

298
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:13,850
Did you finish them?

299
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:19,160
I was once a mere servant...

300
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,510
Yes.

301
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:25,610
Right now, I wonder if I deserve to live such a life.

302
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:28,310
But strangely,

303
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:31,200
whenever someone tries to take what is mine,

304
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:34,870
I cannot bear it,

305
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:37,370
not even for a moment.

306
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:41,250
Look at Princess Hyo Sun.

307
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,380
See how she is living.

308
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,860
Did she not commit a crime?

309
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,950
Her crime was

310
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,480
getting on Her Majesty's bad side.

311
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,600
The Queen is an impartial person.

312
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,210
Do you know

313
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:58,420
Her Majesty better than I do?

314
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,980
She is someone who can take away

315
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:06,010
the only thing a concubine has despite having ten things.

316
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,440
Just remember one thing.

317
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:20,110
You may be able to comfort His Majesty temporarily with that geomungo,

318
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:22,580
but it will not win you his heart.

319
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:24,950
Thus,

320
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:27,960
we need to partner up.

321
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,580
We?

322
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,050
Yes. We.

323
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:02,210
How could you do this to me?

324
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:04,440
Of all people, how could you do this to me!

325
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,150
Her Majesty's command was so solemn.

326
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:11,510
However, my heart for you has not changed.

327
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:16,400
There will come a day when I can make up for what happened today.

328
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:25,430
A three-room tile-roofed house costs five seoms of rice.
[One seom of rice is about 160 kg]

329
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:29,650
Based on that, purchase the houses near Changdeokgung.

330
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:34,070
I will personally inspect and appropriately distribute them to the officials.

331
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:36,240
However, Your Majesty,

332
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,360
there is already an established price.

333
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,130
Who set that price?

334
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:43,630
Did the people decide it?

335
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:49,590
Your Majesty, the price at which a house is sold or bought

336
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:53,320
is completely up to the people.

337
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:58,730
How can Your Majesty set in stone that a three-roomed tile-roofed house

338
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:01,920
is worth five seoms of rice?

339
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,450
Even if this is criticized, I will take the blame.

340
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:11,490
With all due respect, Your Majesty,

341
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:13,810
it has not been long since we moved to Hanyang.

342
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:18,000
I fear we will lose the hearts of the people in the capital over this matter.

343
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,250
Thus, please rescind your order.

344
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:25,770
<i>Please rescind your order.</i>

345
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:30,930
Are the people you are referring to

346
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:33,480
different from the people I know?

347
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,440
Rescind my order?

348
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,000
When you fight over a position, you do so as if you are mortal enemies.

349
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,070
But how could you all be so unified in this matter?

350
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,680
They are no different!

351
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,920
I will punish those who line their own pockets

352
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,910
at the expense of the people in accordance with the law.

353
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,760
Minister of Justice, execute my order thoroughly.

354
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,850
If I find you were negligent in carrying out your duties,

355
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:01,180
I will hold you accountable.

356
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,710
Yes.

357
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,850
We cannot let the Queen keep running wild like that.

358
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,800
We need to drain the Queen of her strength.

359
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,980
She definitely was not a pushover.

360
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:22,050
Obviously, someone who helped establish the king

361
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:24,840
and became queen would not be a pushover.

362
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:33,160
I see that you have a plan.

363
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:43,780
You will sell a house you recently bought?

364
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,300
A buyer came along.

365
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,120
For ten times the cost!

366
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:51,750
The Queen said we cannot.

367
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,740
We just have to make sure she does not find out.

368
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,850
Hyungnim!

369
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:56,940
We are being pushed out of power.

370
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,040
If we are pushed out of financial power as well,

371
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,930
then we will lose influence in Hanyang.

372
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,160
Did she not say so before?

373
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:11,560
Her Majesty is not on our Min family's side.

374
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,940
Do not trust in the Queen.

375
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:17,850
We need to...

376
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:20,450
walk our own path now.

377
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:21,840
Yeoganggun?

378
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,220
Yes.

379
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:26,930
I sold six three-room tile-roofed houses to Yeoganggun.

380
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:30,720
Now that I have found buyers for those houses...

381
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:35,390
You set the trap like that?

382
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:40,660
Should I not help him make at least ten times the profit?

383
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:44,100
He is Her Majesty's younger brother, after all.

384
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:51,630
You should see how the Queen keels over from this.

385
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,780
I should see it for myself.

386
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,870
I plan to attend the Royal Sericulture Ceremony, which was used

387
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:58,820
to justify the King's withdrawal of his declaration of abdication.

388
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:01,790
I hear he asked all the women of the royal relatives to attend.

389
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,130
But you know,

390
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:16,750
there are others besides Yeogganggun who increased their wealth in such a way.

391
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:22,420
I fear the fallout might end up hurting us as well.

392
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:28,140
Who would dare step forward and speak out about their own wrongfully gained profit?

393
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:33,100
As long as nobody speaks up about it, there will be no problem.

394
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,930
But the people...

395
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:37,140
Whether it is through threats or persuasion,

396
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:40,150
I will make sure they keep silent.

397
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:57,100
Which one is the Queen's bathwater?

398
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,160
It is this one.

399
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,160
Is it all ready?

400
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,080
Yes, it is all ready.

401
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,390
Court Lady.

402
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:18,080
What are you doing here, Court Lady-

403
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,410
Wait, C-Court Lady?

404
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,920
Aigoo, it is all ready.

405
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:32,980
The Hours of Ox and Tiger.

406
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,980
This is clear water drawn 0.2 km deep from the Han River,

407
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:39,040
and the clear water from the stream at Suseongdong of Inwang Mountain.

408
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,720
Thus, the water is still cold.

409
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,060
Court Lady Seo will soon bring the hot water.

410
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,520
Change the water.

411
00:29:57,490 --> 00:29:58,950
Forget it.

412
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:04,260
How will the Queen have a bath like this?

413
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,630
Your Majesty!

414
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:56,250
Madam! Madam!

415
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:01,570
What is the matter?

416
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,580
Madam...

417
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:08,730
The offering ceremony where wine is poured for the God of Silkworms.

418
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:12,890
The presentation of five types of mulberry leaves on the ceremonial platform.

419
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,980
The Crown Prince and officials' presentation of their tribute writings.

420
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:22,910
His and Her Majesty's reception of greetings from the inner court.

421
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:26,930
We prepared everything in the order you commanded.

422
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:35,080
Do not have the presentation of tribute writings separately.

423
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,500
Combine it with the reception of greetings.

424
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,140
Yes, Your Majesty.

425
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,710
Hello.

426
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,730
You are beautiful.

427
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:51,940
Thank you for coming.

428
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:06,050
Thank you for coming.

429
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:09,480
I will escort you to the rear garden.

430
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,970
- Follow me.
- Yes.

431
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,810
Thank you for coming.

432
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,790
Thank you for your hard work.

433
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:01,010
- Please come inside.
- Yes.

434
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,410
Aigoo.

435
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:18,740
Head inside.

436
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,660
Follow me quickly.

437
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:32,070
My goodness!

438
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:34,330
Aigoo, careful, careful!

439
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,390
She is Her Majesty.

440
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:52,360
What brings you here?

441
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:57,830
What is the matter that is so urgent?

442
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:03,270
It appears Yeoganggun has fallen for Bamgol Kim's trap.

443
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,870
What did you say?

444
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:47,580
Was there such a ceremony in the Celestial Empire?

445
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:51,620
I heard the Queen is holding this ceremony for the first time.

446
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:13,080
Your Majesty.

447
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,220
You have fallen into a trap.

448
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,750
Pardon?

449
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:21,390
His and Her Majesty have carefully watched over

450
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:24,810
the livelihood of the people, both morning and evening.

451
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:28,590
When they saw hungry people, they expressed great sorrow.

452
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:32,470
In order to save the poor and destitute people,

453
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:35,560
Taesangwang established a nation.

454
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,490
His and Her Majesty

455
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:43,150
worked tirelessly to continue to carry out his goal.

456
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:48,470
Her Majesty's dedication to teaching silkworm farming to the people

457
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:51,090
is a sacred and blessed endeavor.

458
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:55,570
Her Majesty's desire to improve the people's welfare by promoting sericulture

459
00:36:55,570 --> 00:37:00,010
will surely have reached the heaven.

460
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:19,400
<i>The secretly laid trap will not only ensnare Yeoganggun,</i>

461
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,450
<i>but also Your Majesty.</i>

462
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:27,420
I, Myeongseon Daebu, a relative of His Majesty report this.
[Myeongseon Daebu: A 3rd senior rank given to a royal relative]

463
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:30,490
The one who is secretly supporting Bamgol Kim is

464
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:32,910
Taesangwang's half-brother,

465
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:35,430
Myeongseon Daebu.

466
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:39,840
If so,

467
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,490
even the king would have difficulties with him.

468
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:47,370
For the people, having a house is more important than sericulture.

469
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:50,260
Having a house where their entire family can live together.

470
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:54,910
However, there are powerful ministers who are taking away

471
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:57,850
the houses of such people for their own profit.

472
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:59,970
Thus, I want to report this.

473
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:04,400
Who is the powerful minister you are referring to?

474
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:43,060
I was told that if I buy a house briefly for cheap and then sell it,

475
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,070
I could make ten times the profit.

476
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:50,230
I was blinded by my greed, and I...

477
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:53,220
Of all people, me!

478
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,840
I must have gone mad temporarily.

479
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:00,550
Your Majesty!

480
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:03,080
To express my allegiance to Your Majesty,

481
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:06,760
I will offer up all those houses to you.

482
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,540
Accept those houses and fairly distribute them

483
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:13,850
to officials who do not have a house.

484
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,420
Is that all?

485
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,930
From what I heard from the Minister of Commerce,

486
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:26,460
there were more.

487
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:31,310
I also have two three-room tile-roofed houses

488
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:33,750
and two four-roomed tile-roofed houses in Jungchon.

489
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:36,890
I will hand over these to show my allegiance to you

490
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:40,510
and follow in Yeoganggun's great intentions.

491
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:45,920
I will also offer up a tile-roofed house, Your Majesty!

492
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:50,050
I offer you my allegiance, Your Majesty.

493
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:53,010
I will offer up three tile-roofed houses, Your Majesty!

494
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:57,800
<i>We offer you our allegiance, Your Majesty!</i>

495
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:06,080
I-I will also offer up all my houses

496
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:10,890
to help alleviate your concern for the people.

497
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:16,620
What about you, Myeongseon Daebu?

498
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,470
Well...

499
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,630
If the elder of the royal relatives steps in,

500
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:28,150
it will please His Majesty greatly.

501
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:32,180
Well...

502
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,780
Well, I...

503
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,560
I obviously will also...

504
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:41,340
Your Majesty.

505
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:46,290
I have two two-room tile-roofed houses

506
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:50,770
and five three-room thatched-roof houses in Jungchon.

507
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:55,080
I will hand them over to your disposal.

508
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,660
Your Majesty.

509
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:34,280
Now, you should command the Ministry of Justice to arrest Bamgol Kim...

510
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,190
Your Majesty.

511
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:48,510
Great work.

512
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:01,760
About Myeongseon Daebu.

513
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,240
It was refreshing to see this,

514
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:08,110
but he would be your uncle-in-law if this was a private residence.

515
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:11,540
The unjust luxuries he enjoyed in Gaegyeong,

516
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,960
he enjoyed here in Hanyang,

517
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,230
and tried to continue enjoying them.

518
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,390
What about the Crown Prince?

519
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:22,330
He went to the Eastern Palace.

520
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:26,210
Since he worked hard today, I should give him praise.

521
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,810
Let us go.

522
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,890
Secretary of Royal Orders.

523
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,910
Yes, Your Majesty.

524
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:41,350
Tell the Minister of Justice to first arrest Bamgol Kim.

525
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,620
Yes, Your Majesty.

526
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:12,450
How did it seem to you?

527
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:16,670
I am talking about the Queen.

528
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:23,340
She was like a king.

529
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:28,730
Thus, you must be wary of her.

530
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:32,800
In this situation, if the Min family uses the Queen and the Crown Prince to push their agenda,

531
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,340
will you be able to handle them?

532
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:39,000
If Your Majesty and the Crown Prince were to be in opposition,

533
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,450
the Queen will side with the Crown Prince.

534
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:45,580
Is that not why you withdrew the order to pass the throne, knowing this?

535
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:51,250
If I spoke out of line, I committed a grave sin worthy of death.

536
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:55,150
No. Everything you said is right.

537
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:01,480
Your Majesty, you need to expand your influence.

538
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:04,740
You should use both the royal relatives and Ansunggun Yi Suk Beon

539
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:07,880
as a means to grow stronger.

540
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:12,680
I must expedite the Crown Prince's marriage.

541
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:20,580
Is this it?

542
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:22,290
Yes.

543
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:26,080
A black horn bow's body must be made by combining mulberry wood and bamboo.

544
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,150
But this is made of only bamboo.

545
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,930
Not only that, the horns on either tip are not even water buffalo horns.

546
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:36,360
Get me another one.

547
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,760
Yes, Your Highness.

548
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,020
Water buffalo horns are a military supply item that must be imported from Ming.

549
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:42,230
Mother.

550
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:44,760
You only need your bow for hunting,

551
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:48,940
so why do you need a black horn bow?

552
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:51,990
I am the Crown Prince of this nation.

553
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,480
Because you are the Crown Prince of this nation, you must be even more cautious.

554
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,990
I asked why you need this bow when it is a military item.

555
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:04,440
- Eunuch Kim.
- Yes.

556
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:08,290
This is probably not the only bow the Crown Prince owns.

557
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:10,220
Bring me all of his bows.

558
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:12,760
- Your Majesty-
- Now!

559
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,200
Yes.

560
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:20,560
Where did you get all of these?

561
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,270
Still, I read the books diligently.

562
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:26,740
What is the point of reading the books

563
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:29,280
when your mindset is not right?

564
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:34,840
Then, I will only go hunting once every three months.

565
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:38,460
Only to the extent that it does not cause harm to the people.

566
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:46,350
Once every six months...

567
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:49,130
Since you have said so,

568
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:52,770
I will trust in your word.

569
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:56,430
Yes, Mother.

570
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:57,670
Court Lady Seo.

571
00:45:57,670 --> 00:45:59,170
Yes.

572
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:10,350
This is your reward for your dignified appearance during the Royal Sericulture Ceremony.

573
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:13,770
Honil Gangni Yeokdae Gukdo Jido.
[Honil Gangni Yeokdae Gukdo Jido (Gangnido): Oldest known world map in the East]

574
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:18,420
It is a world map that marks the capitals of various countries.

575
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:26,300
As soon as His Majesty ascended to the throne,

576
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:28,660
he created this map, Gangnido.

577
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:33,470
You should also carry the great will of your father, who created this map,

578
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:35,430
in your heart, Crown Prince.

579
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:37,780
Yes, Mother.

580
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:54,970
Also, I will appoint Yeoseonggun, Min Mu Jil

581
00:46:54,970 --> 00:46:57,670
as Inspector General.

582
00:46:57,670 --> 00:46:59,320
If Min Mu Jil becomes Inspector General,

583
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,980
he will target the central figure of the royal relatives, Myeongseon Daebu.

584
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:03,820
That is why I am doing this.

585
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,620
Myeongseon Daebu is Your Majesty's ally.

586
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:06,830
Indeed, he is an ally.

587
00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:08,490
However,

588
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:10,340
he has become corrupt.

589
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:21,220
You know, Her Majesty at the Royal Sericulture Ceremony today...

590
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:26,690
I wonder if Queen Seondeok reincarnated would be like her.

591
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:31,540
I thought that Her Majesty would have done really well

592
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:34,730
even if she had become

593
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:37,500
the king of this nation, Joseon.

594
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:43,250
A woman cannot become a king in this nation.

595
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:46,150
What is your true motive for saying that?

596
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:04,660
So what if Her Majesty showed the demeanor of a king?

597
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:14,460
Only you are the monarch of this nation.

598
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:30,960
You say the Queen showed the demeanor of a king?

599
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:36,450
I could...

600
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:40,390
end your life for that statement.

601
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:58,350
I will restructure the Palace Internal Guards into the Royal Guard.

602
00:48:58,350 --> 00:49:01,230
Also, the Royal Guard will be integrated into the Central Army of the Supreme Military Command,

603
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:03,830
and be commanded by three military commanders

604
00:49:03,830 --> 00:49:05,860
to strengthen its power.

605
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:08,220
The purpose of the Royal Guard's existence

606
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:10,390
is to guard the King's Palace.

607
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:13,900
<i>Yes, Your Majesty.</i>

608
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:17,740
Also, I will arrange for the Crown Prince's marriage.

609
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:20,310
If there is a family who wants to participate in the royal marriage,

610
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:23,380
collect the profiles of their daughters as marriage candidates.

611
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:25,550
Secretary of Royal Orders should establish the Ministry of Royal Weddings

612
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:27,770
and help the Queen as its chief.

613
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:30,400
<i>Yes, Your Majesty.</i>

614
00:49:31,310 --> 00:49:32,840
Additionally,

615
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:36,030
I appoint Yeoseonggun Min Mu Jil

616
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:39,290
as Inspector General.

617
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:48,570
I-I am honored.

618
00:49:56,930 --> 00:50:03,330
Also, I will appoint Yeoseonggun, Min Mu Jil as Inspector General.

619
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:04,930
If Min Mu Jil becomes Inspector General,

620
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:07,620
he will target the central figure of the royal relatives, Myeongseon Daebu.

621
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:09,480
That is why I am doing this.

622
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:11,290
Myeongseon Daebu is Your Majesty's ally.

623
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:12,440
Indeed, he is an ally.

624
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:15,980
However, he has become corrupt.

625
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:22,060
You have to attempt to cut 80% to actually cut 50%.

626
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:24,100
If you try to cut 50% from the start,

627
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:28,260
you will end up only cutting 20 or 30%.

628
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:32,920
That will not move the people at all.

629
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,690
Then?

630
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:41,290
At the appropriate time, I will pardon Myeongseon Daebu.

631
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:43,280
If so,

632
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,850
from then on,

633
00:50:45,850 --> 00:50:48,520
they will start attacking the Min family.

634
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:05,670
Your first mission as Inspector General is to investigate the powerful ministers

635
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:10,590
who colluded with Bamgol Kim to steal the people's houses and land.

636
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:14,400
- Yes.
- Their allies are everywhere in the court.

637
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,220
You must not give them any opportunity to act preemptively,

638
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:19,580
and carry this out discreetly.

639
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:23,400
I shall carry this out without any errors.

640
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:07,200
I asked to meet with Myeongseon Daebu.

641
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,640
He asked me to join him in the meeting.

642
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,510
Please take a seat.

643
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:21,300
All right, he should be arriving soon.

644
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:29,550
What happened with the Right Army Commander position was His Majesty's will.

645
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:33,120
But one of Your Excellency's men received that position.

646
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:36,540
What is so important about the title of your position?

647
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:41,150
The title of your position determines the level of your power.

648
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:47,630
You are here.

649
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:49,210
Hello.

650
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:56,380
I was utterly humiliated!

651
00:52:58,570 --> 00:53:03,450
When the Queen asked me, "What about you, Myeongseon Daebu?" Goodness.

652
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:06,580
The Queen got me really good.

653
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:11,550
How could the King let a mere woman run wild like that?

654
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:14,030
Come on now, your words are crossing the line.

655
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:15,600
What do you mean, crossing the line?

656
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,620
Honestly, who did we establish as king?

657
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:21,500
Is it the King or the Queen?

658
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:24,140
He appointed Yeoseonggun as Inspector General.

659
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:26,160
That is what I mean!

660
00:53:34,490 --> 00:53:40,510
That is why I need to make my daughter become the Crown Princess.

661
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,930
Help me.

662
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:49,280
This is only possible with the royal relatives' support.

663
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:52,800
You will make your daughter the Crown Princess,

664
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,990
so you want the royal relatives to support her?

665
00:53:54,990 --> 00:53:56,370
Yes.

666
00:53:56,370 --> 00:53:57,860
Why should we?

667
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:01,410
Who is the Crown Prince?

668
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:04,420
He grew up in the Min family when he was young.

669
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:07,860
Thus, if we do not make sure the Crown Princess is one of our people,

670
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:10,550
they will push us around again.

671
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:15,380
But did not His Majesty order the Ministry of Rites

672
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:17,460
to accept marriage candidate profiles publicly?

673
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:21,090
You do not have to worry about that.

674
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:26,160
I am Yi Suk Beon.

675
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,610
<i>Madam! Madam! Madam!</i>

676
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:32,870
You were all gathered here, I see.

677
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:45,780
Save me.

678
00:54:49,510 --> 00:54:51,250
Who are you?

679
00:54:52,930 --> 00:54:54,790
I do not believe I have seen you before.

680
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:59,500
You gained so much wealth through me. How could you pretend not to know me?

681
00:54:59,510 --> 00:55:00,790
Do you have proof? Probably not.

682
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:02,600
You probably do not.

683
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:05,980
- Your Excellency!
- Oh, yeah!

684
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:09,070
About the land that I was supposed to receive last time...

685
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:13,260
Luckily, the title has not passed to me yet.

686
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:15,580
Let us just say it never happened.

687
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,480
Is anyone outside?

688
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,510
Is anyone outside?

689
00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:28,710
A criminal ran in here.

690
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:33,050
Do you believe you can get away by using me as a scapegoat?

691
00:55:33,050 --> 00:55:34,210
Hear ye!

692
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:36,480
I will not die alone!

693
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,730
To see a better day in the future,

694
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:43,200
think about how you can die well right now.

695
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:48,940
Hear ye! What are you doing?

696
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:50,590
Quickly drag her out!

697
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:53,140
- I will not die alone!
- Move!

698
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:55,840
I will not die alone!

699
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:59,900
I am sorry for the commotion.

700
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:02,730
Aigoo, aigoo! Aigoo, what is this!

701
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:04,190
Aigoo, I am so sorry.

702
00:56:04,190 --> 00:56:06,130
Are you all right? I am so sorry.

703
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:07,340
It is fine, it is fine.

704
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:08,760
Let us go.

705
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:10,100
Goodness, seriously.

706
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:11,360
Aigoo.

707
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:17,830
This is the first time a crown princess is being selected after the founding of the dynasty.

708
00:56:17,830 --> 00:56:20,720
What we do from now on will become precedent,

709
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,540
and that precedent will become history.

710
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:28,160
I ask that you approach this with solemn reverence and care.

711
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:47,600
[Daughter of Yi Suk Beon of the Anseong Yi family]

712
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:52,400
Is this all?

713
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,080
Yes.

714
00:56:55,390 --> 00:57:00,140
Just three candidates, including Anseonggun Yi Suk Beon's daughter?

715
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:04,260
And the other two are clearly just listed for formality.

716
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:09,210
Bring me a new list of candidates.

717
00:57:09,210 --> 00:57:10,940
Your Majesty.

718
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:15,200
I hear the royal relatives are supporting Anseonggun anyway.

719
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:18,000
I refuse to accept this.

720
00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:23,530
However, if she is a candidate supported by the royal relatives, His Majesty-

721
00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:25,420
Bring me a new list of candidates.

722
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:29,040
I cannot select the crown princess like this.

723
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,030
[Daughter of Yi Suk Beon of the Anseong Yi family]

724
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,650
[Daughter of Kim Han Ro of the Gwangsan Kim family]

725
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:55,540
I wish to hold a competition to weave your own cotton fabric.

726
00:57:55,540 --> 00:58:01,430
Ultimately, I will select the one who wins this competition as the Crown Princess.

727
00:58:02,510 --> 00:58:05,070
[The Queen Who Crowns]

728
00:58:05,070 --> 00:58:08,940
♫ <i>I look at you, whom I cannot reach</i> ♫

729
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:18,210
♫ <i>I dream a dream I cannot achieve</i> ♫

730
00:58:18,210 --> 00:58:24,860
♫ <i>What used to shine brilliantly</i> ♫

731
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:29,840
♫ <i>The faded days</i> ♫

732
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:36,750
♫ <i>Like the wind that I cannot contain</i> ♫

733
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:40,830
♫ <i>You who disappeared</i> ♫

734
00:58:40,830 --> 00:58:43,770
<i>I have selected the Crown Princess.</i>

735
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:46,520
<i>I am saying I will strengthen the monarchy.</i>

736
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:51,130
<i>My feelings for you have never changed.</i>

737
00:58:51,130 --> 00:58:53,440
<i>All she needs to do is win.</i>

738
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:56,040
<i>You are the one who created this mess, right?</i>

739
00:58:57,030 --> 00:58:58,870
<i>Right now, I am Joseon.</i>

740
00:58:58,870 --> 00:59:01,250
<i>- You are being cowardly.
- Enough!</i>

741
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:04,020
<i>Please spare them.</i>

742
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:07,940
<i>Why are you doing this to me!</i>
