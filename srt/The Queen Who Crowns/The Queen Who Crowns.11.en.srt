00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,280
It is so good to come here with you.

Mother.

8
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,560
Is not Hanyang so vast?

9
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,890
I cannot see where its end lies.

10
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:02,370
Young Master, is not Gaegyeong quite small?

11
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,020
Did you say it is vast?

12
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:10,700
- Yes.
- Why do you say that it is vast?

13
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,130
Because it is filled with people.

14
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:17,390
People who farm the land,

15
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:19,780
people who raise livestock,

16
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,690
people who starve,

17

people who are suffering from illness,

18
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,020
people who laugh,

19
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,590
and people who mourn.

20
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,600
I see...

21
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:41,290

[Yi Do: Grand Prince Changnyeong, future Se Jong]

23
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,010
Is not a monarch

24
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,090
chosen by the heavens?

25
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,130
A monarch

26
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:02,780

Father fought with his sword brandished

29
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:12,950
and seized the throne.

30
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,000
The one who had him do so

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,190
was you, Mother.

32
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:23,630
May I ask you why you did so?

33
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,080
Because I saw his thirst.

34
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,650
Wanting to do this

35
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,020
and that for the people...

36
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,190
That kind of thirst.

37
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,750
Did you say thirst?

38
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,330
That very desire

42
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,230
Father.

43
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,690
These are Chinese records on helping the hungry.

44
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,620
- The hungry?
- When it rained black rain,

45
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,070
I learned there were many hungry people.

46
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,690
My heart was broken for them for a long time, and

47
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:14,000
I wondered if there were other ways to help them

48
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,600
aside from just giving them charity rice.

49
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,090
But there were no such methods in Joseon.

50
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,420
I am thinking of compiling feasible methods

51
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,560
from records throughout Chinese history.

52
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,400
I am thinking of going hunting next month.

53
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,930
I want to leave now, but the path is not ready,

This is a book on the geomungo and the pipa.

57
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,320
There is nothing like music among things enjoyed

58
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,740

59
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,110
I will keep that in mind, Father.

M-My Lady.

64

Is this your third visit after I left the palace?

65
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:32,620
Yes.

66
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,220
You had not visited me once during the past year.

67
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,530
I will not be coming at all from now.

68
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,790
Why do you want to learn of the palace news?

69
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,970
It would only make you sad.

70
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,970
So you are cutting ties with me.

71
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,560
You came to tell me this, I see.

72
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,820
Did you deliver the medicinal herbs that

73
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,920
I sent with you to give to the King two years ago?

74
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,630
Doing that will not change the King's mind.

75
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,960
They say people's hearts change when times change.

76
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,520
However,

77
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,420

Changija.*
(Herbs poisonous to liver)

79
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:19,720
What you slipped into Her Majesty's bathwater.

80
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,520
There is no proof.

81
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,980
And that was a long time ago.

82
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,830
Do not threaten me with that.

83

All right.

91

Gosh, so heartless.

92
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,470
How does this make any sense?

93
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,910
Min Mu Hyul is the head of the Royal Family Bureau

94
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:08,360
and Min Mu Hoe is the governor of Hanseongbu.

95
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,110
It feels like the Min family is taking over again

96
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:15,960
so I am quite bothered.

97
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:20,760
The King is saying he will not give anyone

98
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,400
his complete trust.

99
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,640
Yes.

100
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,680
Five years ago, through the situation

101
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,500
with Myeongseon Daebu, I realized

102
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,580
how cold-hearted the King is.

103
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,140
By Myeongseon Daebu, do you mean

104
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:39,340
when you detained Her Majesty at Hoeamsa?

105
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,450
Fire and jail the Ministers of Defense and Justice

106
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,930
for deceiving me with Myeongseon Daebu's support.

107
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,610
Also, there will be other court ministers

108
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,190
who also falsely claimed to be under my orders

109
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,680
and tormented the people.

110
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,890
You must expose all of their crimes.

111
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:07,820
Yes, Your Majesty!

112
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,300
Your Majesty.

113
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,730
There is much that I know

114
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,810
about the suspicions regarding Myeongseon Daebu.

115
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:18,810
Please allow the Investigative Bureau

116
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,050
to investigate me.

117
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,500
Then...

118
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,120
I will expose their crimes

119
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,200
and demonstrate my loyalty to you.

120
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:32,920
I pledged my allegiance to him that day,

121
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:36,240
and I persevered and tried my best

122
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,350
for years to prove this.

123
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,620
Thus, you became the Associate Left Minister

124
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,150
and received the title of Buwongun.

125
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,440
However, the King does not give me

126
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,800
his full trust both then and now.

127
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,120
Look over here!

128
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,000
Welcome!

129
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,430
That is why

130
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:08,130
I need an even more powerful connection.

131
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,280
I am sorry we are late.

132
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:20,190
Let me pour you a glass.

133
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,950
I heard from Gu Jong Su

134
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,870
that he obtained a black horn bow.

135
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,380
But is he not in exile?

136
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,750
That is why I want to ask you a favor.

137
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,500
Please receive it from him and give it to me.

138
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,690
But Your Highness,

139
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,140
the King will strike him if he finds out.

140
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,620
Yes, I will do so.

141
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,430
- Great!
- Your Excellency!

142
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,650
I will get that black horn bow

143
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:57,130
and secretly deliver it to you.

144
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:03,740
Then, what will Your Highness give me in return?

145
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,170
What would you like?

146
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:10,790
When you rise to the throne later,

147
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:15,090
seat me in the closest position next to you.

148
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,660
Of course.

149
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,630
Of course!

150
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,040
This is the strong wine you requested.

151
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,630
Oh, this strong wine.

152
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,550
It is a precious wine, Your Highness.

153
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,150
I will have it.

154
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,800
Give it over here.

155
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,400
Your Highness.

156
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,630
Your Highness!

157
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,020
I am sorry.

158
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:51,230
You must be full of affection for me.

159
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:00,930
Your Majesty, the weather is so nice.

160
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:04,260
Aigoo, look at the flowers.

161
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,090
Prince Hamnyeong.

162
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:18,380
We should greet Mother.

163
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,590
They are Grand Prince Chungnyeong

164
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,780
and Sukeui's son, Prince Hamnyeong.

165
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:32,590
Is it not time for Prince Hamnyeong to marry now?

166
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,140
Yes.

167
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,540
Go visit Sukeui.

168
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,480
Should not his mother be the one to marry him off?

169
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,600
Then...

170
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,590
Five years is...

171
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:50,240
a sufficient punishment.

172
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,340
Yes.

173
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,270
The Queen will prepare Prince Hamnyeong's wedding?

174
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:15,910
Last time, Her Majesty also handled the wedding of

175
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:19,440
Princess Hyosun's son, Prince Gyeongnyeong.

176
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,410
What about Sukeui?

177
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,590
How is Sukeui doing?

178
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:31,410
I-I hear she is doing well.

179
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:34,610
Your Majesty, Prince Hamnyeong is grown up now.

180
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:37,920
How long will you leave her outside the palace?

181
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,200
I will have to bring her back soon.

182
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,020
It appears the Queen also thinks the same.

183
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,340
Goodness.

184
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:06,320
What is this? Why is she suddenly here?

185
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,770
Again, that annoying woman, Court Lady Kim-

186
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:12,320
Who are you calling annoying?

187
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,660
C-Court Lady Jeong!

188
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,410
Aigoo!

189
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:20,230
Aigoo, what brings you here!

190
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:28,020
She is considering the daughter of Choi Sa Gang.

191
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,080
If it is Choi Sa Gang,

192
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,760
is he not the Associate Minister of Defense?

193
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,950
Yes.

194
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:37,300
He has great character, and it is a great family.

195
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,280
That is good to hear.

196
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:46,520
Her Majesty said Prince Hamnyeong's wedding

197
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,490
will be handled by his own mother,

198
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:54,110
so you need to prepare to return to the palace.

199
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:27,040
Your Majesty, Your Majesty!

200
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,680
- What is the matter?
- We have big trouble!

201
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,100
- Big trouble?
- A woman was secretly

202
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,110
living in the Crown Prince's palace.

203
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,800
The King found out and was furious.

204
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,110
What are you talking about?

205
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,810
He put a palace maid uniform on a gisaeng

206
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,860
and hid her in his palace.

207
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,560
What did you say!

208
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,740
Is she that girl?

209
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:10,040
How could you disappoint me like this?

210
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,100
How will you become the king like this?

211
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,840
- I will be more careful.
- Be more careful?

212
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,630
To do what?

213
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:20,140
Saying you will be careful

214
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,760
is a phrase spoken

215
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,020
out of habit when you want to shut me up.

216
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,820
I am sorry.

217
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,820
Do you not know that...

218
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:33,300
the subjects are comparing you and Chungnyeong?

219
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,470
Your Majesty!

220
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:37,760
Every time I hear that, I become afraid

221
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,620
their words may induce bloodshed between princes.

222
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,530
Your Majesty!

223
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,020
This is not the time to say such things-

224
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,430
I wanted to do well!

225
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:49,590
I also wanted to hear you say I did well.

226
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,610
However,

227
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:54,100
I felt so suffocated the more I tried.

228
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:57,420
So, your solution to the tension

229
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,880
was to fool around with a girl?

230
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,990
I told you to read.

231
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,720
I told you to train in martial arts.

232
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,190
To cultivate strong moral character!

233
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:07,940
A strong moral character does not come from books.

234
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,680
As far as I know, a strong moral character

235
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:13,920
cannot be found in the palace.

236
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,720
In the palace, there are only

237
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,800
disgusting subjects pretending to be loyal.

238
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:25,390
A monarch must endure even such feelings

239
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,270
of disgust.

240
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:34,130
You do not know, Father.

241
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,600
What do I not know?

242
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,000
The subjects who even think lightly of

243
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,020
the Crown Prince.

244
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:45,890
Did you say subjects who think lightly of you?

245
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,650
Yeowongun did that to the Crown Prince?

246
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,940
This happened after His Highness

247
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,920
argued with Yeosangun and stormed off.

248
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,700
Did anyone else see this besides you?

249
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,020
This happened so quickly, so...

250
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,380
Then, I will let this pass for now.

251
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:05,360
A crown prince who is scorned by his uncles...

252
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,260
Who are these subjects who think lightly of you?

253
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:16,480
- Father
- I asked, who they are!

254
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,750
M-My uncles.

255
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,870
Crown Prince!

256
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,290
You mean Yeowongun

257
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,160
and Yeosangun?

258
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,610
Yes.

259
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,540
What do you mean by that?

260
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,130
I heard Yeowongun

261
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:02,340
dare throw a fist at the Crown Prince.

262
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,210
There must be a maid who saw this act.

263
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,370
That is a baseless rumor.

264
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:11,030
If that is a rumor, someone must have spread it.

265
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:14,210
Whether the rumor in the palace is true or not,

266
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,760
for the sake of the Crown Prince,

267
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,450
it is only right as subjects to cover this up.

268
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,290
Grand Prince.

269
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:25,560
What is your intention for trying to uncover this?

270
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:30,460
If His Highness was scorned, I must reveal-

271
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:34,050
A maid who dares to reveal the truth boldly

272
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:36,670
must be willing to risk her life.

273
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,180
What do you seek to gain by using

274
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,500
a person's life as collateral, Anseong Buwongun?

275
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:48,870
Grand Prince, I am quite well-off already-

276
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:51,770
I merely did this out of my feelings of loyalty.

277
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:53,650
How could you say such...

278
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,330
The Grand Prince Chungnyeong

279
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:01,300
shut up Anseong Buwongun...

280
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:08,580
with one word, and it was so thrilling.

281
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,670
Did something happen

282
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:14,180
to the Crown Prince that I do not know about?

283
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,410
Pardon?

284
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,210
Tell me.

285
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:22,180
Enraged, Yeowongun punched the Crown Prince

286
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,450
- like this...
- Your Excellency!

287
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,210
Your Majesty.

288
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,810
Mother.

289
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,240
Where is the Crown Prince?

290
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,640
The King summoned him.

291
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,130
I have something to check for myself.

292
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:39,810
Tell him to come to me when he can.

293
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:42,070
Yes, Mother.

294
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,980
What is that?

295
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,750
I said I would not take it,

296
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,280
but he insisted and left it behind.

297
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,820
Did you bring a bribe?

298
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,290
No.

299
00:19:56,290 --> 00:20:00,780
I merely happened to obtain good wine from Ming.

300
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:06,170
Your friend Gu Jong Su was among those who called

301
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:08,990
the Crown Prince outside to hold drinking parties.

302
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,820
He was sent into exile.

303
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,500
I have cut ties with him already.

304
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,250
You cut ties with him?

305
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:18,300
That better be true.

306
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:22,520
If you approach the Crown Prince with them again,

307
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,380
I will not hold back then.

308
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,910
Give it back to him.

309
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:36,080
Yes, Mother.

310
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,540
Yes.

311
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,790
Well, then...

312
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,400
Tell the Dojeju of the Royal Investigative Bureau.

313
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,670
There must be others who lured the Crown Prince.

314
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:00,480
Those who drink with the Crown Prince outside,

315
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,780
those who offer bribes to the Crown Prince,

316
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,550
those who provide him with women.

317
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,790
Tell them to find out who they are.

318
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,690
I will punish them severely.

319
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:12,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

320
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:50,110
Her Majesty is here.

321
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:58,410
Please send Yeosangun and Yeowongun

322
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:01,660
into exile.

323
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,660
Let us do that.

324
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,470
I hope...

325
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:15,590
you will prevent any more

326
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:18,370
innocent deaths with that.

327
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:35,220
Yeowongun and Yeosangun.

328
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:39,070
Royal authority will not be solidified solely by

329
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:41,700
removing threats to the Crown Prince.

330
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,430
You two shall fill each other's cups.

331
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,730
Drink.

332
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:26,190
Chungnyeong has the qualities of a monarch.

333
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,070
That is what people say on the streets.

334
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,790
Have you heard this?

335
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,010
Yes.

336
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,300
Chungnyeong.

337
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,670
Do you want to be a king?

338
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,770
- Father.
- Answer me.

339
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,120
No.

340
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:54,360
Only the Crown Prince will follow me as king.

341
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,670
I will make sure to establish the tradition

342
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:00,520
of passing the crown to the firstborn.

343
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,700
This cannot be changed.

344
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,060
Yes.

345
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:07,210
So, promise me that you will

346
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:12,180
use your deep knowledge for the Crown Prince only.

347
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,720
Yes, Father.

348
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,880
Did you hear that, Crown Prince?

349
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,570
Yes.

350
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:23,160
Chungnyeong will help you.

351
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,480
Everyone will help you.

352
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,080
Do not get distracted.

353
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,000
And do not do anything shameful.

354
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,830
Only,

355
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,410
focus on the goal.

356
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:34,670
Being a benevolent king

357
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:37,890
must be your only goal.

358
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:41,130
Yes, Father.

359
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:12,760
It seems you have been well.

360
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,640
Thank you for

361
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,750
calling me back.

362
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,220
All right.

363
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:24,700
I will never

364
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,800
behave foolishly.

365
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:34,900
I will serve you well, so Your Majesty never

366
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,300
abandons me again.

367
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,790
Chae Ryeong.

368
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:51,840
Do not forget that you are also

369
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,000
a mother to a prince.

370
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:00,840
Yes, Your Majesty.

371
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:06,810
My Lady.

372
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:16,410
In celebration of Prince Hamnyeong's wedding,

373
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:19,680
His Majesty will bestow the title of Princess.

374
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,750
Goodness, My Lady!

375
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:25,670
We prepared your quarters to befit that.

376
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:27,510
You should take a look.

377
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,740
Hello, welcome.

378
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:50,080
Are you still close to Anseong Buwongun?

379
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,630
Yes.

380
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,460
Shall I have him come to greet you?

381
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:19,480
I cannot leave the Queen like that.

382
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,580
If I do,

383
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:24,290
she will stab me in the back one day.

384
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:25,710
You are right.

385
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,370
Then...

386
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:30,740
Do you remember Princess Hyosun?

387
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,930
She was once called Yeong Sil.

388
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:34,880
Yes, I remember her.

389
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,920
His Majesty once loved her

390
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,650
but was left behind at Gaegyeong.

391
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:40,900
And now, she is forgotten.

392
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:44,880
But why do you bring up Princess Hyosun?

393
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:48,320
There is a woman known as Gyo Ha-daek.

394
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,760
Have her meet with the King.

395
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,530
[Gyo Ha-daek: Princess Hyosun's (Yeong Sil) friend]

396
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:05,880
Sir.

397
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,060
Sir, please wait.

398
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:16,560
We are almost there. Forge on just a bit further.

399
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:30,280
Yeong Sil...

400
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:37,260
When Princess Hyosun came to my house at Gyo Ha,

401
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:40,220
she was pregnant.

402
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:43,350
That winter, when she was about to give birth,

403
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:46,770
people from Gaegyeong came.

404
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:48,890
They were from Chudong.

405
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:51,380
By Chudong, do you mean

406
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:54,080
the Queen's private residence

407
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,450
where I previously lived?

408
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:58,140
Yes.

409
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,210
Those men

410
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,950
took Yeong Sil away.

411
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:08,340
During a snowstorm, they abandoned Yeong Sil

412
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:12,870
who was close to giving birth in an empty field

413
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:16,220
where only wild animals traverse.

414
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:20,710
As if they wanted her to die.

415
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:22,360
And?

416
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:38,190
She had birthing pains in the freezing wind.

417
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:40,710
Yeong Sil, who was doomed to die

418
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:44,710
crawling with her bare hands on the frozen ground,

419
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:47,190
was discovered by my brother.

420
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:49,310
The heavens blessed us

421
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:53,970
and we barely managed to get her to a nearby barn

422
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:56,940
and helped her give birth.

423
00:29:58,370 --> 00:29:59,830
Then,

424
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:04,020
who ordered that deed from Chudong?

425
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,250
The King did not...

426
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:25,360
seem to believe it.

427
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,990
What is the matter?

428
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:20,830
Stand aside.

429
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,100
What is this about?

430
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,060
The King has ordered that the Queen

431
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:40,210
and all the court ladies and maids

432
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:43,990
must not leave the Queen's palace from now on.

433
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:45,460
What?

434
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,540
What is this about?

435
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,310
We do not know.

436
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:53,890
We are merely obeying His Majesty's orders.

437
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:57,510
Move aside!

438
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,620
Did you Min family

439
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,220
try to kill Prince Gyeongnyeong and his mother?

440
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,560
Absolutely not, Your Majesty!

441
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,670
How could we dare to plot such a thing?

442
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:18,030
We never did such a thing.

443
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:21,610
This is slander by those trying to frame us!

444
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:24,110
Please listen to our plea!

445
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,420
- Force them to their knees.
- Yes!

446
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,890
I will ask you one more time.

447
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:01,300
Did you Min family

448
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,280
try to kill Prince Gyeongnyeong and his mother?

449
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,400
N-No, Your Majesty.

450
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,980
We did not do it!

451
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,310
Please...

452
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:18,840
kill us now.

453
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,540
We did not do it.

454
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,210
Yeowongun Min Mu Hyul,

455
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:32,780
and Yeosangun Min Mu Hoe,

456
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,280
die by drinking poison.

457
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,630
Your Majesty, should I summon the Royal Physician?

458
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:03,140
No.

459
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:12,240
That never happened at my family's residence!

460
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,600
His Majesty knows better than anyone

461
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,030
- that never happened.
- Then?

462
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:22,150
He did that despite knowing all that?

463
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,830
I saw it.

464
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:25,510
Saw it?

465
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:28,300
What did you see?

466
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,520
Yeowongun...

467
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:34,290
scorning the Crown Prince.

468
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,050
That rumor...

469
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,020
It was true.

470
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:51,220
If that incident was brought to light,

471
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:54,570
the Crown Prince would be damaged too much.

472
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,470
It seems he has found another reason.

473
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,630
And that other reason

474
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:02,590
was provided by Yi Suk Beon...

475
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:04,160
Yes.

476
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,810
The King said

477
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:09,810
he will come to console you tomorrow.

478
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:11,170
No.

479
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:12,640
There is no need for that.

480
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,510
- Your Majesty.
- There is no need to console

481
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:18,090
or to be consoled.

482
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:19,610
Just tell him

483
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,310
the King can do his job

484
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,560
as King.

485
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,280
Yes.

486
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,030
She said,

487
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:45,270
the King can do his job as King.

488
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:31,920
Come now.

489
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,840
Court Lady Seo.

490
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,690
Yes, Your Majesty.

491
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:40,260
Open the door.

492
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,530
I will go to the Crown Prince.

493
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:59,730
Yes, Your Majesty.

494
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,960
Your Majesty, it is so early in the morning.

495
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,190
It is best you stay in

496
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:07,050
your palace and sort your feelings.

497
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:10,840
The King has killed all of my younger brothers.

498
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:14,560
If I stay in bed in my palace in this situation,

499
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,060
will not gossip say

500
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,250
that the Queen

501
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:21,800
has an illness of the heart.

502
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:25,370
That will not be good

503
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:27,460
for neither the court

504
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,220
nor myself.

505
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,370
But Your Majesty,

506
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:35,430
you must comfort your heart at times like this.

507
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:39,210
Do not blame yourself.

508
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:41,700
This is not Your Majesty's fault.

509
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:45,610
Even if they deserved death, they are your family!

510
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:50,340
If I were you, I would resent His Majesty.

511
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,650
They are her younger brothers!

512
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:53,450
Court Lady Seo!

513
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:00,050
I will not resent him.

514
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:05,240
Mother.

515
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:09,480
You could have summoned me.

516
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,840
It is all right.

517
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,670
Where is the Crown Prince?

518
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,740
I asked, where is the Crown Prince?

519
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,650
He left the palace last night...

520
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,500
It appears he left because he missed that gisaeng.

521
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:31,180
I am ashamed to even face you.

522
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,660
I am trying to hold it in and endure it.

523
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,520
Do not hold it in.

524
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,750
And do not try to endure it.

525
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,590
Holding it in and enduring

526
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:44,700
can sometimes...

527
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:47,270
become a snare in life.

528
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:52,020
Yes, Mother.

529
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,480
All right, let us go in.

530
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:05,920
Is that not the Princess?

531
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,100
Where is Her Majesty?

532
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,160
She is inside.

533
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,230
What brings you here?

534
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,720
His Highness will meet with

535
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,380
Anseong Buwongun Yi Suk Beon this afternoon.

536
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,530
- What!
- It appears

537
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:27,410
he will receive a black horn bow.

538
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:29,490
A black horn bow?

539
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:34,420
But how did you find this out?

540
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:37,200
Anseong Buwongun came to greet me yesterday.

541
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,930
He said he would take hold of the Crown Prince.

542
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:42,770
I looked into what he meant secretly

543
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:44,970
and rushed here.

544
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,570
Gu Jong Su, in exile, got a black horn bow

545
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:57,510
and Anseong Buwongun Yi Suk Beon

546
00:39:57,510 --> 00:40:00,280
will give it to the Crown Prince secretly.

547
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:12,770
This is the finest black horn bow in Joseon.

548
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:17,430
I will never forget what you did, Anseong Buwongun.

549
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:19,120
You must not forget it.

550
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,760
I am putting everything on the line for you.

551
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:27,290
Thus, you must love me like this forever.

552
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:28,900
Of course.

553
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,980
Of course!

554
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:37,070
Your Highness, how could you...

555
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:40,170
- Goodness, Your Highness...
- Your Highness.

556
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:44,990
Your Highness, I pledge you my allegiance!

557
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:48,380
I will continue to treat you like this.

558
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,350
Your Highness...

559
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,550
Oh, my!

560
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,890
Y-Your Majesty!

561
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:07,860
Your Majesty!

562
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:27,960
Is that not a bribe from a criminal in exile?

563
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:30,890
Father, well...

564
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:33,780
Bring it here.

565
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:44,180
I already said I will severely punish those

566
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:46,430
who give personal gifts to the Crown Prince

567
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:48,890
or invite him to drinking parties outside the palace!

568
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:50,490
Your Majesty, this is not what you think-

569
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:52,460
Silence!

570
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,860
I will take away Anseong Buwongun Yi Suk Beon

571
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:59,580
and Secretary of Royal Orders Yu Sa Neul's positions

572
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,490
and send them into exile.

573
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:03,300
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

574
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,010
Drag them away!

575
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:08,080
- Your Majesty!
- Please reconsider!

576
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,380
Your Majesty, Your Majesty!

577
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,730
Please withdraw your command!

578
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:13,370
Please hear me out, Your Majesty!

579
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:15,080
Your Majesty!

580
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:30,290
You did not heed my warning.

581
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:32,430
You will never see

582
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:35,450
His Majesty again while you are alive.

583
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:50,250
The Crown Prince is not to leave your palace

584
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:53,250
until further orders are given.

585
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:57,380
Yes, Father.

586
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:59,190
Take him.

587
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:40,870
Wait, then...

588
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:50,560
I had to let you know.

589
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:54,030
The Crown Prince will inherit the throne!

590
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:55,830
How could you humiliate him like this?

591
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:58,150
You must not try to ignore it.

592
00:43:58,150 --> 00:43:59,870
You must face the truth.

593
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:04,110
The Crown Prince lacks the qualities of a monarch.

594
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:05,360
Queen!

595
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,430
You should now relieve the

596
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:13,150
Crown Prince of the heavy burden you put on him.

597
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:22,130
You are so cruel.

598
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:26,540
To both the Crown Prince and me.

599
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:28,150
Taesangwang said

600
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:31,000
he would even kill his own children if they

601
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,420
destroyed the royal authority and the court.

602
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:37,240
He said the sorrow of having to kill his own son

603
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:40,020
was part of his undertaking as a monarch.

604
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:45,350
Are you any different, Your Majesty?

605
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:46,540
What do you mean?

606
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:48,010
If the Crown Prince

607
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:51,250
ruins royal authority and the country,

608
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:53,840
are you sure you will not pull out the iron mace

609
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:56,360
that Taesangwang pulled out back then?

610
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,920
Queen!

611
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:00,210
I am...

612
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:03,010
I am different from my father!

613
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:24,350
If Father had passed the throne to his firstborn,

614
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:26,120
I would not have killed Bang Beon

615
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:29,370
and Bang Seok in the Year of the Yellow Tiger.

616
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:33,490
If Father had passed the throne to his firstborn,

617
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:38,760
Your Majesty would not have become king.

618
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:43,700
You would have suffered much from disappointment.

619
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:49,770
Since you wanted to become king more than anyone.

620
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:57,390
Do you think no princes want the throne now?

621
00:45:57,390 --> 00:46:00,460
I fear there may be bloodshed among the princes.

622
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:02,130
Thus, I am trying to

623
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:05,910
prevent this by making the firstborn the heir.

624
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:11,700
I know very well what you are afraid of.

625
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:14,590
I also fear that.

626
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:16,840
However, the Crown Prince

627
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:19,570
lacks the qualities of a monarch.

628
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:21,110
I will teach him.

629
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:22,470
I just teach him.

630
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:24,950
He tried to take bribes from a criminal.

631
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:27,690
He had drinking parties outside of the palace.

632
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:29,870
He broke Your Majesty's commands.

633
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,670
I will teach him.

634
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:34,350
Not anyone else, but I!

635
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:38,850
You have understood me the most until now.

636
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:42,880
Though we fought, you supported me in all things.

637
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:46,290
Please do so this time as well.

638
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:00,830
How could you do such a thing?

639
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:05,480
Do you know how disappointed Father was with me?

640
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:09,020
Is that what you are afraid of?

641
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:12,890
You tried to accept a bribe from a criminal.

642
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:16,100
You should first take accountability for that.

643
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,870
A monarch

644
00:47:17,870 --> 00:47:20,420
is not in a position to take accountability,

645
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,080
but of holding others accountable!

646
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,280
A monarch...

647
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:25,630
must take accountability.

648
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:27,360
Mother!

649
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:29,670
In the past,

650
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:32,490
when the King said he will pass the throne to you,

651
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:34,900
your uncles tried to enthrone you

652
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:37,000
when you were not ready.

653
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
If I did not stop them, then,

654
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,270
the king would have taken his sword against you!

655
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:46,940
If you become the monarch but are not a good king,

656
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:51,140
where would the King's blade be pointed at?

657
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:52,450
The Ministry of Defense

658
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:55,050
and all of the Supreme Military Command

659
00:47:56,050 --> 00:47:58,890
are under the King's control.

660
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:26,320
Is it hard to eat this?

661
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:29,550
No.

662
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:42,560
This is what the people eat regularly.

663
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:46,340
Forget about what happened yesterday.

664
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:51,220
I punished those who led you astray.

665
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:52,630
Yes.

666
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:55,800
All you need to do is study hard

667
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:58,490
and cultivate a character befitting a monarch.

668
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:08,270
Father.

669
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:13,390
Do you believe I can become a benevolent king?

670
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:20,000
Do you believe I have the qualities of a monarch?

671
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:27,730
You can attain it if you try.

672
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,620
Is that

673
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:34,610
something I can attain by trying?

674
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,510
Try to do so.

675
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:39,780
I want to know why you want to make me king.

676
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:41,040
Because you are the firstborn.

677
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,450
Father, you were also

678
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:45,970
not the firstborn.

679
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,860
That is all the more

680
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:56,640
reason I must make you king.

681
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:23,910
They are Chungnyeong and Seongnyeong.

682
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:40,100
Chungnyeong is perfect, except that he is weak.

683
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:42,590
He may seem weak on the outside,

684
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:46,970
but his decisiveness after deep consideration

685
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:49,580
is second to none.

686
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:05,100
Seongnyeong.

687
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:06,250
Come over here.

688
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:07,990
Father.

689
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:11,930
You grew taller since I last saw you.

690
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:15,650
I think I grew a few inches in the past month.

691
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:17,420
I see, I see.

692
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:38,190
I mean it.

693
00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:41,860
The color green has a scent to it.

694
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:43,380
What scent?

695
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:44,950
A fresh scent.

696
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:50,200
The scent of something blossoming and growing.

697
00:51:51,790 --> 00:51:54,650
I really love this scent.

698
00:51:55,560 --> 00:52:00,020
My Seongnyeong, you are the finest poet in Joseon.

699
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:02,350
Only in Joseon?

700
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:20,330
Your hand is hot.

701
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:24,920
You have a bit of a fever.

702
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:27,040
How long have you been like this?

703
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:31,130
He had a slight fever since this morning.

704
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:34,820
It is all right. Do not be worried about me.

705
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:38,450
Where is the Royal Physician?

706
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:23,920
I have not heard you play the geomungo lately.

707
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,990
I am more into tea-brewing than the geomungo.

708
00:53:28,990 --> 00:53:30,790
Tea-brewing?

709
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:36,560
When I steep, pour,

710
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:39,440
and enjoy the scent of the tea,

711
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:42,820
I can focus solely on myself.

712
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:44,490
Your Majesty.

713
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:51,160
I heard what Her Majesty said

714
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:54,440
about the Crown Prince.

715
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:57,430
Yes.

716
00:53:57,430 --> 00:53:59,640
With all due respect,

717
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:03,560
Her Majesty's words are loyal advice.

718
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:08,340
Of all people, how could you say such a thing?

719
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:13,330
Do you not also honestly feel nervous about this?

720
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:16,270
If you consider from a broader perspective-

721
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:18,780
My mind will not change on this matter.

722
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:21,120
Let us stop talking about this.

723
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,090
Your Majesty!

724
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,710
Your Majesty!

725
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:32,170
What is the matter?

726
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:34,320
Grand Prince Seongnyeong...

727
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:38,280
supposedly has smallpox.

728
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,360
Smallpox? Are you saying he has smallpox?

729
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,540
I am greatly sorry, Your Majesty.

730
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:08,670
His Majesty is here.

731
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:10,330
Son!

732
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:15,340
No, stay lying down.

733
00:55:16,090 --> 00:55:17,880
Stay lying down.

734
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:22,130
Father...

735
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:25,990
I am sorry for causing you concern.

736
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:29,110
No, that is all right.

737
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,990
Talk with me for a moment.

738
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:44,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

739
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:01,150
Are you sure he has smallpox?

740
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:03,090
Yes.

741
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:07,670
Then, what must we do?

742
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:11,380
I prescribed paedeuksan and seungmagalgeuntang.

743
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:15,200
I am extracting harmful energy stored up in his body.

744
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:18,140
Will he...

745
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,590
survive?

746
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:24,510
You must save him.

747
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:26,320
You must save him at all costs.

748
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:29,590
The next three or four days will be critical.

749
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:33,610
We have to lower his fever by then.

750
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:35,470
Please...

751
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:37,540
save him.

752
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:48,890
Your Majesty.

753
00:56:48,890 --> 00:56:50,840
Yes.

754
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:55,150
Smallpox is a very contagious disease.

755
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:59,710
Make sure no other prince or princess visits.

756
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:02,080
Yes.

757
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,620
A prince has smallpox.

758
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:08,620
It will probably spread among the people, too.

759
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:13,470
Your Majesty must care for the people.

760
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:15,560
I will watch over

761
00:57:16,590 --> 00:57:19,480
Seongnyeong.

762
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,460
My son is this sick, and yet,

763
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:28,290
I should go and

764
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:31,780
care for the people first?

765
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:49,080
[The Queen Who Crowns]

766
00:57:54,590 --> 00:57:58,200
♫ Oh, heavens ♫

767
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:04,750
♫ Holding your breath from being shy ♫

768
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:14,330
♫ Until the day breaks ♫

769
00:58:14,330 --> 00:58:24,540
♫ We are separated, and I sing alone ♫

770
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:29,030
For smallpox, pus forms on the third day.

771
00:58:29,030 --> 00:58:30,590
Where is the Crown Prince?

772
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:33,510
How can you call yourself human after this?

773
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,890
Depose the Crown Prince

774
00:58:35,890 --> 00:58:39,210
and banish him to a faraway land.

775
00:58:39,210 --> 00:58:40,840
You poured Changija

776
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:42,470
into Her Majesty's bathwater.

777
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:44,050
You must risk your life

778
00:58:44,050 --> 00:58:45,690
to go against his will.

779
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:48,510
Do you truly not have any ulterior motives?

780
00:58:48,510 --> 00:58:50,450
Did the Queen order you to do so?

781
00:58:50,450 --> 00:58:53,390
If one of my younger brothers is enthroned,

782
00:58:53,390 --> 00:58:56,450
I will slay him without hesitation.
