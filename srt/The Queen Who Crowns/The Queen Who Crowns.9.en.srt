<i>I thought that Her Majesty would have done really well</i>

6
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,720
<i>even if she had become</i>

7
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,130
<i>the king of this nation, Joseon.</i>

8
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,570
<i>A woman cannot become a king in this nation.</i>

9
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:53,140
<i>What is your true motive for saying that?</i>

10
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,810
<i>At the appropriate time,</i>

11
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,760
<i>I will pardon Myeongseon Daebu.</i>

12
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,120
<i>If so,</i>

13
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,940
<i>from then on,</i>

14
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,930
<i>they will start attacking the Min family.</i>

15
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:11,490
<i>This is your reward for your dignified appearance during the Royal Sericulture Ceremony.</i>

16
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,060
<i>I must expedite the Crown Prince's marriage.</i>

17
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,750
<i>Help me.</i>

18
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:20,260
<i>You will make your daughter the Crown Princess,</i>

19
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,400
<i>so you want the royal relatives to support her?</i>

20
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,460
<i>Yes.</i>

21
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,250
<i>I do not believe I have seen you before.</i>

22
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:28,990
<i>Hear ye! What are you doing?</i>

23
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,350
<i>- I will not die alone!
- Move!</i>

24
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,590
<i>I will not die alone!</i>

25
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:40,440
This is the first time a crown princess is being selected after the founding of the dynasty.

26
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,230
What we do from now on will become precedent,

27
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:46,070
and that precedent will become history.

28
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:50,710
I ask that you approach this with solemn reverence and care.

29
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,100
[Daughter of Yi Suk Beon of the Anseong Yi family]

30
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,930
Is this all?

31
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,490
Yes.

32
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:22,620
Just three candidates, including Anseonggun Yi Suk Beon's daughter?

33
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,770
And the other two are clearly just listed for formality.

34
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,030
Bring me a new list of candidates.

35
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,470
Your Majesty.

36
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:37,760
I hear the royal relatives are supporting Anseonggun anyway.

37
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,590
I refuse to accept this.

38
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,390
However, if she is a candidate supported by the royal relatives,

39
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:48,600
His Majesty has no choice but to accept, too-

40
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,530
Bring me a new list of candidates.

41
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:54,130
I cannot select the crown princess like this.

42
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,720
So, you asked to see me privately?

43
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,210
Yes.

44
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,180
What is it?

45
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:15,380
I wish to offer my daughter as Your Majesty's daughter-in-law.

46
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,370
The Queen is responsible for selecting the Crown Princess.

47
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:27,770
Your Majesty, I am offering my daughter to you out of my loyalty to you.

48
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:31,160
How could you say it is the responsibility of the Queen?

49
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,150
Your Majesty,

50
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,440
please do not distance yourself from me.

51
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,550
Since the Year of the Yellow Tiger

52
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:46,610
when soldiers were mobilized in front of Gyeogbokgung until now,

53
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:51,550
Your Majesty is the only one I sought to be loyal to.

54
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,870
So why...

55
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:57,770
Why is Your Majesty treating me differently than before?

56
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:18,340
How could you say I am treating you differently?

57
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:24,680
My feelings for you have never changed.

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,100
So, how did you come to such a misunderstanding?

59
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:36,910
Your Majesty!

60
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,520
[Episode 9]

61
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,870
Tavern Lady, where are you?

62
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,270
I made a reservation.

63
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,790
Please, that way.

64
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,400
Your Majesty.

65
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:34,020
Aigoo, this is so precious.

66
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,580
Thank you.

67
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,620
She seems like a madam of a noble family.

68
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,950
What is the matter? Is her husband causing trouble?

69
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,340
Did he take a gisaeng mistress?

70
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,150
What in the world!

71
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:47,190
He is solely devoted to My Lady!

72
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,760
I have a request for you.

73
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,470
Just give the command.

74
00:05:55,470 --> 00:06:00,570
It appears someone is gifting luxury bows to the Crown Prince.

75
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:04,560
But they are bribes and not gifts in reality.

76
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,470
Please find out who those people are.

77
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,920
When you find out who they are, tell the chief monk at Hoeamsa.

78
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,450
Yes.

79
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,510
Oh, also,

80
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:25,980
there was a major commotion at Anseonggun Yi Suk Beon's house recently.

81
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,120
What do you mean?

82
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:34,140
A maidservant who was like a sister to Anseonggun's daughter committed suicide.

83
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,710
What? Why?

84
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:43,580
Anseonggun said to return all the jewelry she received from Bamgol Kim,

85
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:48,140
but it seems the daughter did not return one of the rings.

86
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,350
After Anseonggun found out and scolded her,

87
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:55,540
I believe she told him that her maidservant stole it.

88
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,610
Are you saying Anseonggun's daughter secretly took the ring

89
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:02,470
and then framed her maidservant for it?

90
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,090
Yes.

91
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,260
Aigoo!

92
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,580
Goodness!

93
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,630
- Put the tofu down first!
- Goodness, why would the young lady

94
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:28,850
of a noble family personally bring such heavy tofu?

95
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:31,980
I kept telling her I would carry it, but-

96
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,340
How will you carry this with your hand like that?

97
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,730
Sit here and eat something before you go.

98
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,450
I will prepare two rice soups quickly for you.

99
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,670
No, no.

100
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,970
I do not want to bother you while you are working.

101
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,920
Just do the math quickly for me.

102
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,590
Yes.

103
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,360
Are you referring to the daughter of Kim Han Ro?

104
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,930
That is correct.

105
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,680
I see he is the one who passed the state exam along with His Majesty.

106
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,480
However,

107
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,560
he is a subject of controversy.

108
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,790
During Taesangwang's reign,

109
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:06,300
he once took a horse from a station official under the pretext of attending a banquet.

110
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,300
That had stirred up quite a bit of trouble then.

111
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,930
That is not all.

112
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:13,110
When he went as a congratulatory envoy to Ming,

113
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:15,440
he secretly engaged in trade to earn profit

114
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,510
and was dismissed from his position.

115
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:20,970
I am not speaking to you about Kim Han Ro,

116
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,720
but his daughter.

117
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,230
However, Your Majesty.

118
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:27,580
If we deny her even a chance just because of her faulty father,

119
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:32,070
would that not be injustice inflicted upon an individual by the state?

120
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:37,780
Thus, I will have Anseonggun's daughter and Kim Han Ro's daughter compete.

121
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,670
Your Majesty,

122
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:43,690
His Majesty already has Anseonggun's daughter in mind.

123
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,250
You need to know this-

124
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:49,370
I clearly told you the principles last time.

125
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:55,770
I will not let the selection of the Crown Princess be used to satisfy their own greed.

126
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,190
I heard that you have Anseonggun Yi Suk Beon's daughter in mind.

127
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,660
What are your thoughts on it, Queen?

128
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,230
I heard Anseonggun asked to meet you privately

129
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:14,890
and made a tearful plea.

130
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,680
Since he can pretend to be that loyal,

131
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,190
it is not that I believe in his act.

132
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,260
Then why...

133
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:30,080
I intend to establish the Gyeomsabok as a cavalry-focused royal guard.

134
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,830
However, upon reflection,

135
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:36,280
does Yi Suk Beon not hold sway over a considerable portion of this nation's military?

136
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,220
However, this is about finding a lifelong partner for the Crown Prince.

137
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,280
The Crown Prince will one day become the monarch.

138
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,130
The Gyeomsabok is a royal guard that strengthens the monarchy.

139
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:49,200
While the Crown Prince's marriage has political implications,

140
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,730
we cannot focus solely on the political aspects.

141
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,420
I am saying I will strengthen the monarchy.

142
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,760
You should consider it positively.

143
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,790
[Yi Family of Anseong, Yi Suk Beon's Daughter]

144
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,410
[Kim Family of Gwangsan, Kim Han Ro's Daughter]

145
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,660
You will be meeting your lifelong partner. How do you feel?

146
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,610
I am not sure.

147
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:25,600
I hope she is someone like your mother.

148
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,480
My mother?

149
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,630
Why?

150
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,720
Is she not upright?

151
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,790
When she sets a goal, she stays true to the path.

152
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,830
That is a valuable trait.

153
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:41,430
But sometimes, I find it difficult and tiring.

154
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,530
Your Majesty, I will do it-

155
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:55,180
It is all right.

156
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,880
In the section of Mencius titled "The Heart," it says this.

157
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,020
- The people are the most valuable,
- <i>The people are the most valuable,</i>

158
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,390
- the state and its affairs come second,
- <i>the state and its affairs come second,</i>

159
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,800
- and the king is the least important.
- <i>and the king is the least important.</i>

160
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,640
This is a quote from the chapter "The Heart" from Mencius.

161
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,120
If the king is so insignificant compared to the people,

162
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,230
how much less important is the crown princess.

163
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:39,180
During the Yin and Zhou dynasties, there were King Jie and King Zhou.

164
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,350
Both kings became a dokbu overnight.

165
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,890
Do you know what dokbu means?

166
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:52,070
Does it not mean a lonely man?

167
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:56,260
A dokbu is what you call a king who is overthrown due to poor governance.

168
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,800
That is correct.

169
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,600
Thus, there is a saying that someone who cares for me is a king,

170
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,400
and someone who abuses me is an enemy.

171
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,110
Do you know where this saying comes from?

172
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:09,640
It comes from Taegyegyeong in the Zhou section of the Book of Documents.

173
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,910
You are quite intelligent.

174
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:14,760
The afternoon selection process will take place during the Hour of Monkey.
[Hour of Monkey: 3 p.m. to 5 p.m.]

175
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,270
You may return to your quarters, eat, and rest for a bit

176
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,730
before coming back at the appointed time.

177
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:24,190
I will escort the former Queen Consort back.

178
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:33,320
If I was born as the daughter of a noble family like you, Princess,

179
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,580
would I have passed such a selection process?

180
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,640
What do you think?

181
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,590
Anseonggun's daughter seemed intelligent.

182
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:49,620
Is it not apparent that she only read books rather than do useless things?

183
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,870
Useless things?

184
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:58,170
I did not say that with any particular intent.

185
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:05,100
The Queen would not select the Crown Princess based on intelligence alone.

186
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,610
Then what?

187
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:10,070
She would look at the person's character.

188
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:15,390
Do you believe that Kim Han Ro's daughter will be selected?

189
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:20,150
Yi Suk Beon's daughter will probably be selected,

190
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:25,040
since the selection of the Crown Princess is not about choosing a good person,

191
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,400
but about choosing a political partner.

192
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,030
Recently, we held a Royal Sericulture Ceremony at the palace.

193
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,850
Do you know about the Royal Sericulture Ceremony?

194
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:41,950
It is an event where Her Majesty personally demonstrates

195
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:46,590
silkworm farming to the public in order to improve the livelihood of the people.

196
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,090
That is correct.

197
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:52,390
However, I believe there is a problem with the Royal Sericulture Ceremony.

198
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,470
What do you think that is?

199
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:01,730
The thread gathered from silkworms is a silk thread.

200
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:08,760
Among the people, how many could make silk clothing made with silk thread?

201
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,880
You are right.

202
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:18,080
The people do not wear silk clothing made with silk thread.

203
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:23,240
They wear clothing made of cotton or rough hemp fabric.

204
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,880
How can one understand the lives of the people

205
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,950
who wear cotton clothing while dressed in silk clothing?

206
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:34,640
Thus, I will hold a competition where you will personally weave cotton fabric.

207
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:40,290
I will select the winner of this competition as the Crown Princess.

208
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:44,350
Both of you will receive the same weaving education

209
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:46,870
before entering the competition.

210
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:03,980
You are to stay here and weave for the next three days.

211
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,440
Pardon?

212
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,370
For three days?

213
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:20,880
For these three days, you are forbidden from meeting outsiders, including your family.

214
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,560
Yes.

215
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,000
I understand.

216
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:36,560
How could she select the Crown Princess by weaving cotton fabric

217
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,090
that the lowly people wear!

218
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,320
In any case, it is a competition.

219
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,040
All she needs to do is win.

220
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:55,070
Well, I do have someone who is good at weaving at my house.

221
00:16:55,070 --> 00:17:00,740
However, outsiders are forbidden from entering.

222
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,320
Give it to me.

223
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,630
If you would do so.

224
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,140
This is from your family.

225
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,830
They said you can submit this tomorrow.

226
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,820
Thanks.

227
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,310
You did a good job.

228
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:44,540
I am honored.

229
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,840
It is natural that it would look this way since it is your first time.

230
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,060
However, Anseonggun's daughter demonstrated great skill with much effort

231
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,440
although it was her first time.

232
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:13,710
Will you learn from her what you did wrong to end up like this?

233
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,810
Yes, Your Majesty.

234
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:21,010
The mother of the nation should be able to teach such things to the people.

235
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:25,580
Show her how it is done.

236
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:30,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

237
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,840
Did you really weave this yourself?

238
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,540
I asked if you wove it yourself.

239
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,390
From the outside,

240
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:47,060
one of the maids at home...

241
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:59,030
You cheated,

242
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,230
so you are disqualified.

243
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:08,150
I am thinking of punishing your family's maid for helping you cheat.

244
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:10,120
What are your thoughts?

245
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:16,210
I do not know.

246
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,330
You do not know?

247
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:25,230
She will be punished because of you, but you do not know?

248
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,250
Did you receive that from Bamgol Kim?

249
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,790
I heard the maidservant who was like a sister to you stole it.

250
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:40,290
So why do you have it?

251
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:44,840
You do not take any responsibility for your actions.

252
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,980
Instead, you are passing blame to others.

253
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:52,270
You memorized the Book of Documents, which teaches us to fear the people,

254
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:57,370
but you have no fear or compassion toward the people.

255
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:59,420
So, how could you dream of...

256
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:03,370
becoming the Crown Princess, who will become the mother of a nation?

257
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:11,760
I have selected...

258
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,630
Kim Han Ro's daughter as the Crown Princess.

259
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,830
However, the royal relatives and His Majesty believe that

260
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:23,480
Anseonggun's daughter will be selected.

261
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,400
You saw for yourselves, and yet, you say that?

262
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:29,610
She lacks the qualities necessary.

263
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:33,220
Kim Han Ro's daughter

264
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:37,780
was selected as the Crown Princess.

265
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,930
- Your Majesty...
- I understand.

266
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:47,980
Shall I deliver your intention to Her Majesty again?

267
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,730
It is all right.

268
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:51,730
You may leave now.

269
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:11,990
During the Year of the Yellow Tiger, I sent my own troops to Gyeongbokgung,

270
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,240
and during Park Po's Rebellion,

271
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,700
I was the one who led the charge in defeating the traitors!

272
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,150
So how could he!

273
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:20,310
It is already decided.

274
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:25,530
The positions of Right Army Commander and the

275
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:29,070
Crown Princess are not the only ways to gain the King's trust.

276
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,460
What do you mean?

277
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,500
During the Royal Sericulture Ceremony,

278
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,300
an outsider secretly entered the palace.

279
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,830
However, that outsider is...

280
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:42,640
someone His Majesty desires.

281
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:50,610
Can you capture him?

282
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,670
Is it them?

283
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:16,950
The ones who have long colluded with Bamgol Kim,

284
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:20,070
taking bribes and reaping benefits.

285
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,600
Yes.

286
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:27,370
How dare you!

287
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:28,970
Your Excellency!

288
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:31,150
Whose orders are these!

289
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:33,780
Let go! Let go of me!

290
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,910
I will walk of my own accord.

291
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,450
Aigoo, Your Excellency!

292
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:41,700
- I am innocent!
- Your Excellency!

293
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:48,390
Let go of me!

294
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:50,870
Gosh, what do we do!

295
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:53,250
Aigoo, Madam!

296
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,430
What is going on!

297
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,530
Why are you...

298
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:50,380
I sent someone to reach you but did not hear back.

299
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,950
I see.

300
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:00,860
But...

301
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:03,700
where did you go this late at night?

302
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,170
The S-Sungeumsa.

303
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:09,660
[Sungeumsa: Agency in charge of maintaining law and order in the capital city]

304
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:13,700
Did you buy and sell houses in Jungchon?

305
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,750
There is no reason for you to

306
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:21,690
frequently visit the Sungeumsa unless you have ties to Bamgol Kim.

307
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:24,440
No, it was not that serious.

308
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:29,680
Just hold your breath for a moment and wait.

309
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:33,040
- Pardon?
-The King achieved his goal,

310
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,950
so this will be over soon.

311
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:37,040
How do you know this?

312
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:42,620
I have served the King for the past eight years already.

313
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:04,760
I-It is j-jangmija.

314
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,420
Jangmija?

315
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,790
It is for sanitizing my nose when I get sores sometimes.

316
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:12,500
If you misuse it, it can damage someone's liver,

317
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,350
and in severe cases,

318
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:17,610
it can even be fatal.

319
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:26,360
R-R-Royal Consort.

320
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:33,450
Who were you trying to silence?

321
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:34,940
That is not it!

322
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:37,310
That is definitely not true!

323
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,470
Throw it away.

324
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:41,720
This is not a good method.

325
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:44,890
Yes.

326
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:47,210
I came by today

327
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:51,010
since I am also a mother-in-law to the Crown Princess.

328
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:54,990
I do not want her to treat me lightly for being a concubine who was a former main chambermaid.

329
00:27:54,990 --> 00:28:00,180
I came to ask you to make sure that would not happen.

330
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,320
Of course.

331
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:14,160
With the upcoming Crown Prince's marriage, I will hand out pardons.

332
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,990
Along with Myeongseon Daebu,
[Myeongseon Daebu: A 3rd senior rank given to a royal relative]

333
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:23,370
I will pardon every meritorious subject of the First Prince's Rebellion

334
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:27,200
of the first degree who were punished for

335
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,020
colluding with Bamgol Kim.

336
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:42,000
<i>Your grace knows no bounds.</i>

337
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:49,700
<i>Your grace knows no bounds.</i>
[Yeoseonggun Min Mu Jil, Younger brother of Queen Won Gyeong]

338
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:56,570
<i>Your grace knows no bounds.</i>

339
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:06,280
Were you planning to do this from the start?

340
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:08,340
What do you mean?

341
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,950
I am talking about your pardon of Myeongseon Daebu.

342
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,330
What is wrong with that?

343
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:19,930
Myeongseon Daebu will only be an obstacle in Your Majesty's path.

344
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:24,340
Sometimes, an obstacle that is removed well becomes a stepping stone.

345
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:28,750
You know that he can never become a stepping stone!

346
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:33,590
You made Yeoseonggun wield the sword and then hid behind him.

347
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:36,650
Let us say I put him in the forefront.

348
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,520
Will they do nothing?

349
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,380
They will now attack Yeoseonggun.

350
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,010
So, if you made him wield his sword,

351
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:45,550
you should take responsibility for it!

352
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:49,460
Responsibility?

353
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:55,360
Responsibility is an elegant way of saying shouldering flaws.

354
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,420
However, under no circumstances should I have any flaws.

355
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:02,460
You often forget this,

356
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:05,250
- but I am Joseon now.
- Your Majesty!

357
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:09,250
I clearly made my intent to select Suk Beon's daughter as Crown Princess.

358
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:13,800
However, my intent was lighter than paper to you.

359
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,960
She lacked the qualities-

360
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,890
Did you not publicly shame Suk Beon's daughter to undermine me?

361
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:21,540
"Look, she is so inadequate."

362
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,440
Was that not outright insulting the monarch?

363
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,870
It was to find a lifelong partner for the Crown Prince.

364
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:28,150
It was the same during the Royal Sericulture Ceremony.

365
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:30,840
Did you have to go that far with Myeongseon Daebu?

366
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,810
Queen,

367
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:34,930
you are not the monarch.

368
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,710
You are cowardly.

369
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:44,510
You cannot do as I did with Myeongseong Daebu.

370
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:47,350
Is that not why you hid behind the sword of Yeoseonggun?

371
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:49,670
- Knowing this, I-
-Queen.

372
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:54,930
How can you say that such cowardly behavior is Joseon?

373
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:56,720
Enough!

374
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,610
Your Majesty.

375
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:02,460
Go back.

376
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,170
- Arrest him.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

377
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,520
Who are you?

378
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,620
Why are you doing this?

379
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,230
Let go of me!

380
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:19,250
Why are you doing this?

381
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,810
Your Excellency.

382
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,440
Are you all right?

383
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:34,160
Do you know how much I suffered on the cold prison floor?

384
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:39,960
His Majesty used the sword of his in-laws to strike the royal relatives and the meritorious subjects.

385
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:44,420
I did not realize His Majesty would do this.

386
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:48,790
Do you really not know His Majesty?

387
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:53,870
Although they were half-brothers, he killed his younger brother and overthrew his older brother

388
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:56,490
to ascend to the throne.

389
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:59,800
Despite that, he set you free like this.

390
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,510
What do you think that means?

391
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:10,910
It means that you can strike back now.

392
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:16,150
The King is not one to lend support to only one side fully.

393
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:25,810
But with what can I strike back?

394
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:28,670
Your Majesty!

395
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:32,030
Back when Your Majesty said you would pass the throne,

396
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:36,120
Yeoganggun and Yeoseonggun seemed eager to carry it through.

397
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:39,690
Also, when Your Majesty withdrew your intent and returned to your position,

398
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:44,960
they appeared sad, unlike the rest of the people who rejoiced.

399
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:50,360
How could they be like this if they did not have a heart of treason

400
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,880
to take power by using the young Crown Prince?

401
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,100
Not only that but on the day you said you would pass the throne,

402
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:01,420
they tried to use the Crown Prince to create the Naejaechu.

403
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,460
It is clear that they have a heart of treason,

404
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:06,210
so revoke their official positions and status

405
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:09,470
as meritorious subjects and depose them.

406
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:38,850
I am sorry to meet Your Majesty in such a state.

407
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:44,170
If you had let me know, I would have sent the Royal Physician.

408
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:46,380
Why did you not say anything?

409
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:49,920
With all due respect,

410
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:53,700
the reason my father suddenly ended up like this

411
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:58,740
is because Your Majesty is trying to abandon us.

412
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,440
Yeoganggun.

413
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:11,370
I was waiting for you.

414
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:14,940
I had a request to make of Your Majesty,

415
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:20,360
I waited here, unable to die.

416
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:22,880
Even if, by chance,

417
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,990
something were to take place,

418
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:37,390
please...

419
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,630
spare them.

420
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,520
Father!

421
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:51,160
Though they may be lacking in many ways,

422
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:58,020
I can guarantee their loyalty to Your Majesty.

423
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,940
So...

424
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,470
please...

425
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:06,920
spare them...

426
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,700
Your Majesty!

427
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,520
Your Majesty...

428
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:51,110
<i>Aigoo, aigoo.</i>

429
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:57,040
<i>Aigoo. Aigoo. Aigoo. Aigoo, aigoo...</i>

430
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:04,430
<i>Aigoo, aigoo. Aigoo, aigoo. Aigoo...</i>

431
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:11,930
<i>Aigoo. Aigoo, aigoo. Aigoo. Aigoo.</i>

432
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:18,340
<i>Aigoo, aigoo. Aigoo. Aigoo.</i>

433
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:26,450
<i>Aigoo, aigoo. Aigoo, aigoo. Aigoo.</i>

434
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:29,650
His Majesty is here.

435
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,460
Go back!

436
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,610
I cannot allow you to be here.

437
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:08,880
Your Majesty does not deserve to pay condolences

438
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,540
to my father.

439
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,350
Yeogganggun.

440
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:19,760
Yes, Your Majesty.

441
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,360
Yeseonggun appears to have lost his discernment due to his deep sorrow,

442
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,860
so take him inside.

443
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,500
Yes.

444
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,630
Let us go.

445
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:29,290
I do not want to!

446
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:31,310
I will not go!

447
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:33,300
I will not go!

448
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,910
Let go of me!

449
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,410
Please, let go of me...

450
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:39,980
Let go of me...

451
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,850
Bow.

452
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:03,060
Bow.

453
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,560
Yeoheung Buwongun's funeral is over.

454
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:24,210
Revoke the official positions and status of his sons Yeoganggun Min Mu Gu and Yeoseonggun Min Mu Jil

455
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:26,210
and send them into exile to Jeju.

456
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:29,990
They will spend a thousand years there.

457
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:32,170
<i>Yes, Your Majesty.</i>

458
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,120
What did you say!

459
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:39,020
Your Majesty!

460
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,930
Just a bit...

461
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:42,810
Please calm down for just a bit before-

462
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:44,220
Move aside!

463
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:47,260
- Your Majesty!
-<i>It is me, Court Lady Seo. I will enter.</i>

464
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,980
Your Majesty!

465
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:51,030
We have a major problem!

466
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:59,130
Check if this man is the right one.

467
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,550
Yes, he is.

468
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:10,300
You caused the Queen to disobey the King's command.

469
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,400
When I was the Crown Prince,

470
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,690
I declared that no one should use private informants.

471
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:19,020
I believed that reporting to Her Majesty

472
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:24,210
was the same as reporting to Your Majesty.

473
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:25,600
How dare you!

474
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,060
How are they the same?

475
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:30,310
The Queen is His Majesty's subject!

476
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:33,340
Please kill me.

477
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:44,300
Ask me to spare you.

478
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,600
Please,

479
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,430
kill me.

480
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:51,200
You will not...

481
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:55,230
cause harm to the Queen even if you end up dying?

482
00:40:56,850 --> 00:41:00,350
What is your reason for being so loyal to her?

483
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,930
Her Majesty...

484
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:09,940
has a calling.

485
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:13,460
Only His Majesty can have a calling.

486
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,620
I wish to...

487
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,560
uphold that calling for her at all costs.

488
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:39,230
Your Majesty, if you kill him...

489
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:43,300
That desire of yours

490
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:47,240
is what is killing the Queen instead.

491
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,660
Blame me for this.

492
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,960
Your Majesty.

493
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:53,250
Have you lost your mind?

494
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:56,800
- What did you say?
- How could you do this

495
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,400
to an innocent man without having lost your mind?

496
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:11,240
This man broke the King's command.

497
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,570
I clearly said

498
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:17,210
there must not be any private informants.

499
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:21,760
It was not enough for you to exile my younger brothers.

500
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,290
You even killed a man I trusted!

501
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:27,260
Why are you doing this to me!

502
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,940
I have no hard feelings toward you.

503
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,090
Your Majesty.

504
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:36,830
If you wish to blame me for this, do so.

505
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:38,990
I will bear it.

506
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,310
Your Majesty, this is black rain!

507
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:35,340
It is bad for you.

508
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:42,940
What brings you here...

509
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:49,450
The Royal Consort said she suddenly had the chills...

510
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:51,460
Tell her to come out.

511
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:53,190
Your Majesty.

512
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:55,680
Should I drag her out?

513
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,160
Kneel.

514
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,600
She is a concubine of His Majesty. How could she be disgraced-

515
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,220
Make her kneel.

516
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:20,580
Move aside.

517
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,310
You are the one who caused this situation, right?

518
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,780
Yes.

519
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:37,150
What did you seek to gain from this?

520
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:41,860
I wanted to be affirmed as someone useful to the king.

521
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:44,330
That is a lame excuse.

522
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:48,360
You are already drunk with the taste of power

523
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:51,400
and caused the death of innocent people to have more.

524
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,310
That is not true!

525
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:02,620
Though I have not abandoned you up to now,

526
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:04,980
I will now...

527
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:08,760
abandon you.

528
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,690
Royal Consort.

529
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:41,310
The people are getting anxious due to the continuing black rain.

530
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:44,170
The number of starving people is growing.

531
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:48,380
Thus, I will release some charity rice quickly.

532
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:50,530
- Minister of Finance.
- Yes.

533
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:52,430
Investigate which households are starving

534
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:55,230
and distribute ten bags of rice and one seok of beans to each household.

535
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:56,910
Yes, Your Majesty.

536
00:46:56,910 --> 00:47:02,520
Also, I granted to Hoeamsa Temple 100 gyeol of land confiscated from Bamgol Kim.

537
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:06,360
I granted this land so the nearby people could farm together to make a living.

538
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:10,440
Investigate whether that land is also being properly managed and report back.

539
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:14,800
Why are you not responding, Minister of Finance?

540
00:47:17,890 --> 00:47:19,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

541
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:22,390
I will do as you have commanded.

542
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:24,350
Minister of Justice.

543
00:47:24,350 --> 00:47:25,540
Yes, Your Majesty.

544
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:29,980
Investigate whether the land I granted to the Buddhist temple is also being managed properly.

545
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,010
However, Your Majesty,

546
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:35,170
that should be left to the Buddhist temple to manage-

547
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:36,990
This is the King's command!

548
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:47,600
The land that the King granted to Hoeamsa...

549
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:50,620
Have you still not obtained approval for it?

550
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:54,020
I gave that land to you, trusting what you said, Myeongseon Daebu.

551
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:55,810
I was supposed to

552
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:58,800
receive that land from Bamgol! It is my land!

553
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:03,120
Regardless of whose land it is, I will die if this fact is revealed.

554
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:06,490
You think you will die alone? I will also lose my head!

555
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:09,640
This will not do. I should go to Hoeamsa and-

556
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,240
Wait, wait!

557
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:14,060
We just have to make sure the King does not find out. Is it not so?

558
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:16,090
How will you do that?

559
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:19,530
I will be leaving first.

560
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:27,730
I am saying this because the Minister of Justice is on my side.

561
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:34,200
Your Majesty, the eunuchs and the local officials

562
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:37,680
of Gyeonggi-do will secretly handle the burying of Pan Su.

563
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,270
Please let them handle it!

564
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:43,360
Pan Su came to help me yet died unjustly at the hands of my husband.

565
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,890
How could you say to leave it to someone else?

566
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:48,510
But, Your Majesty, the timing is not good.

567
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:53,210
His Majesty gave such a horrible sentence to Yeoganggun and Yeoseonggun.

568
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:57,000
In any case, it is better that you do not go out right now.

569
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,880
They are innocent.

570
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:09,080
His Majesty knows that fact as well.

571
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,070
Mother.

572
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:23,550
It has not been long since you entered the palace.

573
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:26,650
I am sorry to show such behavior to you.

574
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:28,840
No, Mother.

575
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,890
It is okay.

576
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:36,710
Though you may live in the palace,

577
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:40,540
you must direct your sights to the outside of the palace.

578
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:42,880
Yes, Mother.

579
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,420
The people are outside of the palace.

580
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:47,920
Yes.

581
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:51,900
Your Majesty.

582
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:55,300
Yes, what is it?

583
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:58,630
Her Majesty has left the palace.

584
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:00,120
She left the palace?

585
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:03,700
To take care of the corpse of Pan Su.

586
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:09,290
The Queen went to take care of the corpse

587
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:12,270
of a man whom the King has slain?

588
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:16,270
That is unheard of throughout history.

589
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:24,120
- Chief Eunuch.
- Yes.

590
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:26,790
Tell the Royal Guard and the gatekeepers guarding this palace

591
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:28,350
not to allow

592
00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:32,260
anyone from entering this palace without my permission.

593
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:33,730
Yes.

594
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:37,230
More, more, more, more. More.

595
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:39,880
Pat this part down smoothly.

596
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:51,560
<i>It appears someone is gifting luxury bows to the Crown Prince.</i>

597
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:55,520
<i>But they are bribes and not gifts in reality.</i>

598
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:59,360
<i>Please find out who those people are.</i>

599
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:05,220
<i>When you find out who they are, tell the chief monk at Hoeamsa.</i>

600
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:07,630
<i>Yes. I will do so.</i>

601
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,460
I must go to Hoeamsa.

602
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:12,850
Not to the palace?

603
00:51:12,850 --> 00:51:14,610
Aigoo, we are done.

604
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:16,000
Oh, yes.

605
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:18,970
I added a half nyang of silver.

606
00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:21,100
Aigoo, thank you.

607
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:24,670
Still, he is a blessed man.

608
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:26,620
What do you mean?

609
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:31,840
I am just saying there are those who are tossed away after starving to death.

610
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,270
How is it that they starve to death?

611
00:51:34,270 --> 00:51:37,110
There should be charity rice granted by the state.

612
00:51:37,110 --> 00:51:39,600
You must be a madam from a noble family,

613
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,110
but you are speaking so naively.

614
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:43,930
How dare you! Do you know who she is-

615
00:51:44,890 --> 00:51:46,470
That darned charity rice...

616
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:48,780
It is skimmed off from above and from the middle.

617
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:50,340
We are lucky if we receive any at all.

618
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:53,220
There are many who do not even receive any. Geez.

619
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:55,390
Is that true?

620
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:59,600
I wish to meet them.

621
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,150
Pardon?

622
00:52:07,470 --> 00:52:11,810
How did your condition worsen all of a sudden?

623
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:22,880
A boil...

624
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:28,080
is caused by pressure on the heart.

625
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:32,290
You have to relax your heart and mind.

626
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:37,460
That is impossible for a monarch.

627
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:40,290
How could I relax in peace?

628
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:44,880
Your Majesty, if this is not treated in time, this may result in palsy.

629
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,410
You must be careful.

630
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,510
What brings you here?

631
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:04,600
I heard His Majesty is not feeling well.

632
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:05,880
You should return.

633
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,760
I can go.

634
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,400
- Royal Consort!
- I will check

635
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,980
and take care of him.

636
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:14,250
As Hyeoneui, I am of First Senior Rank.

637
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:16,850
But you are only a Second Junior rank as Sukeui.

638
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:19,220
It is right that I take care of him.

639
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:23,250
While I gave birth to four princes and princesses,

640
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:26,720
you only gave birth to a single princess.

641
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:31,130
Who do you think the King is waiting to care for him?

642
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,130
Please go back in peace.

643
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:45,900
Your Majesty,

644
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:48,490
<i>the Royal Consort is here.</i>

645
00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:50,360
Have her enter.

646
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:58,050
Your Majesty...

647
00:53:58,050 --> 00:54:00,790
- How did you know to come here?
- Your Majesty.

648
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:04,650
I will take care of you.

649
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:07,100
There is no need. I have the Royal Physician.

650
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:11,700
How could I eat and sleep when Your Majesty is like this?

651
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:15,370
I will stay by your side all night to wipe away the pus

652
00:54:15,370 --> 00:54:18,020
and apply medicine.

653
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:23,210
Royal Physician, you may go now.

654
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:10,010
I now understand how the world works after all this.

655
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:14,600
There is no need to blame the world.

656
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:17,280
We can just use

657
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:20,840
our grievance as motivation.

658
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:26,180
How many people would follow us

659
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:28,410
if we were to stage a rebellion?

660
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:41,030
I wrote down what that man Pan Su said in case I forgot.

661
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:44,450
<i>Musician Yi Oh Bang from the Royal Music Bureau and Gu Jong Su</i>

662
00:55:44,450 --> 00:55:47,030
<i>from the Sungeumsa are surrounding the Crown Prince.</i>

663
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:52,080
<i>It appears the Crown Prince often leaves the palace to hang out with them.</i>

664
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:56,040
<i>What they seek is to each attain a major position</i>

665
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:58,490
<i>after His Highness inherits the throne.</i>

666
00:55:58,490 --> 00:56:02,270
<i>Also, there are rumors that Yi Suk Beon is trying to</i>

667
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:04,800
<i>stay close to Gu Jong Su's brothers.</i>

668
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,400
<i>But I was not able to confirm this.</i>

669
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,360
Yi Suk Beon...

670
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:17,480
By the way,

671
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:22,020
I heard many people were unable to receive the charity rice granted by His Majesty.

672
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:23,920
How did this happen?

673
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,500
It seems some of the lower-ranked officials

674
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,700
with the support of powerful ministers

675
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:31,510
are taking the charity rice for themselves.

676
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:33,430
Did you just say, powerful ministers?

677
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:38,530
Yes. I hear that there are many who do so

678
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:42,110
with the support of Myeongseon Daebu recently.

679
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:44,090
Myeongseon Daebu...

680
00:56:46,130 --> 00:56:50,930
The King granted land to Hoeamsa recently.

681
00:56:50,930 --> 00:56:52,610
Did you receive it?

682
00:56:52,610 --> 00:56:55,250
This is news to me.

683
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:02,260
Your Majesty!

684
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:07,330
I did not recognize you earlier.

685
00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:08,630
I committed a sin worthy of death!

686
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:11,360
It is all right. Please get up.

687
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:14,100
Please get up. You all should get up.

688
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:24,260
Are these the men?

689
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:27,500
The men who did not receive the charity rice they deserved?

690
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,070
Yes.

691
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:30,620
That is so.

692
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:41,570
[The Queen Who Crowns]

693
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:46,890
♫ <i>Only the moonlight lights up the entire mountain</i> ♫

694
00:57:46,890 --> 00:57:57,050
♫ <i>Oh, heavens, holding your breath from being shy</i> ♫

695
00:57:57,050 --> 00:58:06,620
♫ <i>Until the day breaks</i> ♫

696
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:17,400
♫ <i>We are separated, and I sing alone</i> ♫

697
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,060
<i>What is it that you want to say?</i>

698
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:21,550
<i>Your Majesty, use the Crown Prince to...</i>

699
00:58:21,550 --> 00:58:25,220
<i>Do you wish to die by my sword here right now?</i>

700
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:28,230
<i>They met with the Queen to plot treason?</i>

701
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:31,580
<i>Do you have proof?</i>

702
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:33,270
<i>Execute him!</i>

703
00:58:33,270 --> 00:58:37,700
<i>The Queen must die at the hands of lawless bandits</i>

704
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:39,940
<i>while she is detained at Hoeamsa.</i>

705
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:44,320
<i>Yeoganggun and Yeoseonggun, exiled in Jeju-do, clearly plotted treason.</i>

706
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:47,170
<i>Deliver the royal command for them to commit suicide.</i>
