00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:32,717
What the...

6
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,803
She must've closed early today.
All the lights are out.

7
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:36,513
But it's still early.

8
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,598
Did something come up?

9
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:42,894
I told you to hurry up.
What took you so long?

10
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:45,605
Captain wanted the report
by the end of the day,

11
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:48,149
and I couldn't tell him
I had to leave for rice soup.

12
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,277
There's a new noodle place
that's open 24 hours near here.

13
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,154
I'd rather have rice than noodles.

14
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:56,658
What's that?

15
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,410
- What do you mean?
- Was that a flashlight?

16
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:03,873
- Junghwan.
- Yeah?

17
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,443
- Hold still, you bastard.
- Relax.

18
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,612
Bold move, robbing a restaurant
frequented by detectives.

19
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,114
It's not like that!

20
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:38,491
As if. Then why did you
break in here?

21
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,785
My great-aunt runs this place!

22
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,328
Great-aunt, my foot!

23
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,998
Why is it that everyone who comes here
calls her their aunt?

24
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:47,208
My goodness.

25
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,919
- What are you guys doing?
- Are you okay, Mom?

26
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,171
We caught a thief!

27
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,505
Bullshit.

28
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,465
He's my great-nephew.

29
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:57,010
- What?
- Great-aunt.

30
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:58,469
Let him go.

31
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,016
- Sit up.
- My shoulder.

32
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,642
What did I do wrong?

33
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,060
Minsik?

34
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:12,150
Eat slowly.

35
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:13,276
What happened to your face?

36
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,361
Nothing.

37
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,657
I've changed the fuse, but you'll need
an electrician for the rest.

38
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,618
I thought you had experience.

39
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,411
I've just helped out
on construction sites.

40
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:25,955
You need a pro for this.

41
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:29,918
Hey, Minsik.

42
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,670
I didn't know
you were my mom's great-nephew.

43
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,632
What a small world.

44
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:36,841
Your mom?

45
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:39,886
My great-aunt is your mom?

46
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,513
Does that mean you and my mom...

47
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,724
Don't be ridiculous.

48
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:48,603
I don't know why this brat
keeps calling me his mom.

49
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,606
Try this. I made it last night.

50
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:53,691
I'm not sure if it's ripe or not.

51
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:55,860
- Not bad, huh?
- You're the best.

52
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:59,239
- Eat up.
- It's too salty.

53
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:03,243
Did you get into a fight?
Is everything all right?

54
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:06,496
Well...

55
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,416
I've been trying to stay out of trouble
since that incident,

56
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,377
but things aren't going my way.

57
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,711
What's wrong?

58
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,964
Hey, why bother asking?

59
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,423
It'll just be another headache.

60
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:24,764
Tell us what happened.

61
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,307
- Forget it.
- Suit yourself.

62
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,601
I'll tell you everything.

63
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,065
I need your help, Detectives.

64
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:35,942
What happened?

65
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,737
I might have gotten involved
in some online gambling.

66
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,281
- You little...
- Calm down.

67
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:45,868
Great job. Didn't you say
you'd turn over a new leaf?

68
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:49,122
It was out of curiosity.
I know it was stupid of me.

69
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,124
I want to die.

70
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:52,834
Hey, keep it down.

71
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:55,628
Please help me out, Detectives.

72
00:04:55,712 --> 00:05:00,800
If you don't, I might die.

73
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,472
Okay. Payment complete.

74
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,559
30% discount coupon applied,
early bird pricing,

75
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:10,852
a mobile carrier discount,

76
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,562
and 4% cashback plus points accumulated.

77
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,483
I got goosebumps. I'm incredible at this.

78
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,651
Don't you think, honey?

79
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,320
- Hi!
- Hi!

80
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,114
- We're Hana and Doona.
- We're Hana and Doona.

81
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:27,035
- I want in too.
- Cut. Let's try again.

82
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,911
I have to go. See you.

83
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,788
See you. Oh, wait.

84
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,917
- Take this. Open your bag.
- Is that for me?

85
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,170
I didn't know it was for me.

86
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,090
- See you.
- Actually,

87
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:44,302
I think you should quit YouTube.

88
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,637
It's not like we're making
a ton of money off it.

89
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:49,682
It's only stressing you out.

90
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,517
What are you saying?

91
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,227
Have you heard of kid content creators?

92
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,354
Kid what?

93
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,522
You don't know anything about this.

94
00:05:57,106 --> 00:06:00,401
When a kids' food show like that blows up,

95
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,737
you can become a celebrity overnight.

96
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,405
I don't care.

97
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,325
It doesn't feel right
to show our kids' faces online.

98
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,577
Have you heard of Jjangjjang's Food Show?

99
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,622
- Jjangjjang?
- They bought another building.

100
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,749
- A building?
- A building.

101
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:16,417
- They bought a building?
- They did.

102
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,003
Should I still quit?

103
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,714
Quit if you're going to be
so sloppy about it.

104
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,175
We need better camerawork.

105
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,345
I'm familiar with food shows.

106
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:28,846
I watch them all the time.

107
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,015
Guys, let me film you.

108
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,475
Ready.

109
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,143
Now, dig in.

110
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:35,937
Here we go.

111
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:39,565
Good. Yum-yum.

112
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,318
You're doing great.

113
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,445
Yum-yum!

114
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,572
- Sena, you're up.
- Aren't you late?

115
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:47,740
Who cares?

116
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,452
- Get going now.
- It's okay.

117
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:56,499
We don't get enough extra pay
to write up all this paperwork.

118
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,084
I got paid a bit more this time.

119
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,169
Captain wants to start the meeting.

120
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,213
- Where's Detective Jung?
- I'm sure he'll be here soon.

121
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:03,756
Oh, Captain.

122
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,633
What are you all doing here?

123
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,552
We had to submit papers.

124
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:11,347
I got some fresh air on
the rooftop. Can we start the meeting?

125
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,474
Detective Jung isn't here yet.

126
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:14,559
Still?

127
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,751
What are you doing?

128
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:44,755
How long were you watching me?

129
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,049
Since you were crawling on the floor.

130
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,344
You're so good at crawling.

131
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,722
I'm learning so much from you.

132
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,182
That little...

133
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,518
Now that our pro crawler's here,
let's start the meeting.

134
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,811
- Sure.
- Yes, sir.

135
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,607
- Have you lost it?
- What?

136
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:07,028
What you see...

137
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,112
"POWERCASH"

138
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,281
What you see on the screen

139
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:12,658
is a gambling site called Powercash.

140
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,912
You convert cash into points,

141
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,915
which you then use to place bets.

142
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,667
The website has been reported many times.

143
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:25,505
Junghwan and I helped a victim
file a report yesterday.

144
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:30,301
How could he lose 200 million won
in such a short time?

145
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,386
He said it all happened
in the blink of an eye.

146
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,554
POWERCASH

147
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:34,680
ODD

148
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,615
<i>He found the website
through an ad</i>

149
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,284
<i>and started by betting just 10,000 won.</i>

150
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:04,001
<i>After a few wins,
he had 500,000 won in his hands.</i>

151
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,922
<i>Greed took over,
and he started placing bigger bets.</i>

152
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,175
"10,612TH ROUND
YOUR BET: 3,000,000 WON"

153
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:14,387
YOU LOST

154
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,642
YOU LOST

155
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:23,688
What are you looking at?

156
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:33,155
<i>Before he knew it,
he had lost five million won.</i>

157
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,700
<i>To recover his losses,</i>

158
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:38,953
<i>he ended up betting
another five million won.</i>

159
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:42,081
Please, please, please!

160
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,918
<i>Soon, he ended up
taking out loans,</i>

161
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,462
<i>only to lose the money all at once.</i>

162
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,216
He even lost his security deposit
for his apartment.

163
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,468
- Exactly.
- It doesn't end there.

164
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,678
What's worse is

165
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,264
even after the victim lost
all the money he had,

166
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:02,101
they led him
into taking out expensive loans.

167
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:03,686
When he failed to pay back in time,

168
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,938
they even showed up at his workplace
and intimidated him.

169
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,732
There you are, you scumbag.

170
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,819
<i>It seems those little brats
were ruthless with him.</i>

171
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:12,903
Hold on!

172
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:15,031
- Why are you taking off your clothes?
- Come on.

173
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,074
You fucking bastard.

174
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,659
- You think this is a joke?
- No.

175
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,453
- Cut it out, you moron.
- I'm sorry.

176
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,204
- Pay us back, you asshole.
- I will. Please.

177
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,831
- You piece of shit.
- I promise.

178
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:24,999
Shut up.

179
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,002
Make sure we look good.

180
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:30,004
- Smile.
- One, two, three.

181
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:32,298
- Smile.
- You look so cute. Give us a smile.

182
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:35,343
One, two, three. Keep smiling.

183
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,261
That's illegal.

184
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,555
So there are gangsters involved?

185
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,557
It seems so.

186
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:45,227
If this involves a gang,
it is within our jurisdiction,

187
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:49,148
but online gambling falls under
the Cyber Bureau's jurisdiction.

188
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,942
- Hey.
- Since the report was made to us,

189
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,319
we should handle it.

190
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:54,904
Still, jurisdictions should be respected.

191
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,822
Any cases reported to us
are our responsibility.

192
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,201
That's exactly my point.
It's within our jurisdiction.

193
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,369
There he goes again.

194
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,914
We need to track the bank accounts first,

195
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,958
so you'll need to sign up for the site,
place bets, and play.

196
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:09,960
Find out where the money is going.

197
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,045
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

198
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:19,345
Odd! Odd! Odd! Odd! Odd!

199
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,602
- Even! Even! Even!
- No! No! No!

200
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,480
We've gotten an odd number
four times in a row!

201
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:30,731
We have to go with even!

202
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,817
I'm your senior. Show some respect!

203
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,069
- Let's go with even!
- This isn't about seniority.

204
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,905
We should go with the flow
and stick to odd!

205
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:41,158
- We have to go with even this time!
- Double the wager!

206
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,785
I'm going with odd!

207
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,163
I feel a shiver.

208
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,541
One from the bottom for Minseo.

209
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,835
One from the top for Tansik.

210
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,045
One from the bottom for Junghwan.

211
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,548
One from the top for me.

212
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,299
One from the top for Captain.

213
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,677
Get off, I'll cut your hand off!

214
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,473
Ah... Captain.

215
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,683
What are you up to?

216
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,769
We were investigating together.

217
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:15,693
As you mentioned,
in an attempt to track the accounts

218
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:18,904
and understand how this whole site works,

219
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:22,324
I bet 50,000 won out of my own pocket,

220
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,076
and we've been on a winning streak.

221
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,456
The more money I win, the more funds
we'll have for the investigation.

222
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,255
It was all Minseo's idea.

223
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,175
It was your idea!

224
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,551
- You pushed us into doing it!
- You...

225
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:42,178
Have you tracked the accounts yet?

226
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,263
We asked the bank
for cooperation.

227
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:49,018
Captain, with all due respect,
now that we've actually played,

228
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,146
the game itself doesn't seem rigged.

229
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,732
They even show everyone
the win rate for each game.

230
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:58,110
They seem to try to make things fair.

231
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:01,155
Regardless of the win rate,
they're bound to make money.

232
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:03,073
They only disclose the win rates
to appear fair.

233
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,909
What do you mean,
they're bound to make money?

234
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:07,828
In online gambling,
you pay a fee for every round.

235
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:12,082
While your money is supposed to double
if you win, that's not true after fees.

236
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,959
If you lose, you lose all your money.

237
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,879
The more you play, the more money you lose

238
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,714
and the more money the company makes.

239
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,551
Even so, if Jeon Minsik played
like we did...

240
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,762
I mean, if he played like Detective Moo

241
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:27,097
and made smart moves,

242
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:30,392
he wouldn't have lost so much money.

243
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,479
Are you blaming the victim
for not playing better?

244
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:34,980
When you roll a dice,

245
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:38,442
the odds of rolling an odd or even number
are exactly 50%.

246
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:41,821
But what if you keep getting odd numbers?

247
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:42,947
Then you should bet on even.

248
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,741
Or you could bet on odd again.
Maybe that's the vibe for that day.

249
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,868
Both of your arguments are valid.

250
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,287
That's called the Gambler's Fallacy.

251
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,872
{\an8}DONGBANG YUBIN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA

252
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,415
"WE'LL GET AN ODD AFTER SO MANY EVENS!"

253
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,460
GAMBLER'S FALLACY
A COGNITIVE ERROR WHERE ONE BELIEVES

254
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,295
THAT INDEPENDENT EVENTS
INFLUENCE EACH OTHER

255
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:02,466
People often believe
that independent events are related,

256
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,260
but with each roll,

257
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:08,514
the chances of rolling
an odd or even number remain the same,

258
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:11,392
unless the game is rigged.

259
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:16,230
In other words,
the only way to win at gambling is...

260
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,402
I really need to win this time.
Please tell me how.

261
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:29,994
It's by not playing.

262
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,832
- I see.
- You're right.

263
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:35,916
We're detectives.

264
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,209
- Yes, we are.
- That's right.

265
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,962
They'll launder the money and
transfer it to their withdrawal account.

266
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,381
I'm sorry to say this,
but to catch their money mule,

267
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,675
we'll have to go on a stakeout.

268
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,427
- A stakeout?
- Okay.

269
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,887
- We'll go out in teams of two.
- Sure.

270
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,013
- Let's do that.
- Okay.

271
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,514
I'll join you this time.

272
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,101
- You will?
- Yes.

273
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:57,521
Let's all take turns going on stakeouts.

274
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,733
- That sounds fun.
- Nice.

275
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,651
- Sounds like a plan.
- Right?

276
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,740
We could share snacks together.

277
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:11,160
In teams of two, two, two, and two.

278
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,037
I didn't know
you enjoyed stakeouts so much.

279
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,251
Are you done yet?

280
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,336
Almost.

281
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,921
- Stay still.
- Okay.

282
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:27,051
Anyway, I'm proud of you
for deciding to get a license, Hyunseo.

283
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,886
One of my friends got one,

284
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,930
and I thought I could too,
after a bit of practice.

285
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:33,849
I'm good with my hands, you know.

286
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,935
Sure, it's important
to challenge yourself.

287
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,312
This time, don't give up.

288
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,856
I get it. Stop nagging.

289
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,694
There. It's done.

290
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,696
How do I look? Do I look pretty?
Stunning?

291
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,449
Yeah. The more makeup you wear,

292
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,242
the prettier you look.

293
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,203
That's not true.
I look prettiest without makeup.

294
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,247
- Let me take some pictures.
- No way.

295
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,375
It's for my assignment.

296
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,043
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

297
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,921
Who is it at this hour?

298
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,590
Ah, I ordered hot pot.

299
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:08,509
- Can you get it?
- Sure.

300
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:09,802
I have to go to the bathroom.

301
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,639
By the way, I forgot to pay.

302
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,015
Are you kidding me?

303
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:17,393
Why didn't you just eat instant noodles?

304
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,229
Enjoy... Shit!

305
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,691
- "Shit"?
- That's not it.

306
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,234
I mean, "Sit down and enjoy."

307
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,736
- Wait!
- Yes?

308
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,363
- I need to pay.
- Right.

309
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,380
Oh, what's all this?

310
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,007
You'll see.

311
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:51,844
I'm going on a stakeout,
so I won't be home for a few days.

312
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,972
- Call me if anything happens.
- Okay.

313
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:58,142
Are you not filming today?

314
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,728
Ah, I checked
what I filmed the other day,

315
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,896
and it wasn't very fun or anything.

316
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,983
That's too bad.

317
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:09,028
I was feeling like
I was forcing them to eat anyway.

318
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:14,283
Sorry. I have to use the bathroom.
See you later.

319
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,452
- Okay. See you.
- Bye.

320
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,537
See you guys...

321
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,713
Honey! We need to film this! Honey!

322
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:31,175
We need to get this on camera! Ah!

323
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,430
We need to capture this, honey!
Come out right now!

324
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,931
Give me the camera!

325
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,225
Stop whatever you're doing and come out!

326
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,563
Here we go.

327
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:45,689
"JANG TANSIK, POSSIBLE HEIR"

328
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,149
Jeez, not now.

329
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:52,571
"CAPTAIN DONGBANG"

330
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,407
Hello, Captain. Yes, I'm on my way.

331
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,493
Yes, I'll be there soon.

332
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:00,245
Okay. Bye.

333
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,002
Ah. Good.

334
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,754
This will get a million views.

335
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,260
"SKY BANK"

336
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,643
I've looked into
their withdrawal accounts,

337
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:25,521
and they're all under borrowed names.

338
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:29,566
Most of the time, they use this ATM.

339
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,902
So we've picked the right spot.

340
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:37,574
The money mule probably lives nearby.

341
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,202
It's more convenient that way.

342
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:41,912
Right.

343
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,039
Right.

344
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,793
Should I grab us some coffee?

345
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,002
No, I'm good.

346
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,629
Ah, I see.

347
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,969
I can't believe you're here
on a stakeout with me.

348
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,763
I'm sure it's uncomfortable...

349
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:00,931
No, it isn't.

350
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:02,599
Is this uncomfortable for you?

351
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,977
No way. Not at all.

352
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:10,149
I consider you family.

353
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,651
Why would I feel uncomfortable
around family?

354
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,778
I feel totally at home.

355
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:16,697
<i>This is killing me.</i>

356
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,123
Captain.

357
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,500
This is a back cushion.

358
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,336
And this is a neck pillow.

359
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,756
It helps you maintain good posture
when sitting for a long time.

360
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:37,968
This is a scalp massager.

361
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,178
You use it like this.

362
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,723
It feels super nice.
Would you like to try it?

363
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,683
- I'll let you know when I need it.
- Sure.

364
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,730
Ah!

365
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:53,483
I brought some boiled eggs
for when we're hungry.

366
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,235
Should I peel one for you?

367
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,237
It's still warm.

368
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:01,033
If you're not big on eggs,
I brought some <i>gimbap too.</i>

369
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,994
I'm not a good cook,
but I make amazing <i>gimbap.</i>

370
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:06,079
- I'll let you know when I'm hungry.
- Okay.

371
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,211
Ah!

372
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,545
If you're bored, how about a movie?

373
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,714
- I'll let you know when I'm bored.
- All right.

374
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:19,968
We're on a stakeout.

375
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,511
I can't watch a movie

376
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,014
unless I have another eye.

377
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,183
I'm sorry.

378
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,477
I guess I made a mistake again.

379
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,771
Everyone makes mistakes.

380
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:32,231
You and I are no exception.

381
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,566
Do you make mistakes too?

382
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,610
I used to make a lot of mistakes at first.

383
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,571
I thought you were perfect
from the beginning.

384
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:41,531
I was.

385
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:42,658
I knew it.

386
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:47,579
I don't understand
why I keep making mistakes.

387
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,582
Ah.

388
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,252
Here you go.

389
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,671
What's this?

390
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,256
It's a guardian bell.

391
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,633
Motorcyclists usually keep one.

392
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:02,886
It's supposed to ward off evil spirits
that cause danger and mistakes.

393
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,554
You can keep it.

394
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,390
Is it really okay if I keep it?

395
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:09,518
It's nothing special.

396
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,271
Detective Jang,

397
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,482
you're naturally full of energy.

398
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,859
As long as you channel it wisely,

399
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,237
you'll make an excellent detective.

400
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,655
I have high hopes for you.

401
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:22,823
You do?

402
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:25,867
Yes.

403
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:39,589
Daeho Apartment Intersection
might be a better spot.

404
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,842
You think so?

405
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:44,094
Yes, it's more convenient
to drive around there,

406
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:45,804
and there are many back alleys.

407
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:48,640
Criminals are always prepared to run away.

408
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:51,184
More than anything,

409
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:55,480
my hunch says so.

410
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,149
Is that right?

411
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,608
Never mind.

412
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:00,777
I'm sure you know better than me.

413
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:02,571
No, I agree with you.

414
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,282
If we don't make any progress this week,
let's move there.

415
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,450
Okay.

416
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:09,453
I'm learning a lot from you,
Detective Moo.

417
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:14,458
Me? How so?

418
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,711
Watching you,

419
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:20,630
I've come to understand
the importance of field experience.

420
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,049
I learned in school

421
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:24,468
that investigations aren't done
with your head but with your legs.

422
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,678
Back then, I didn't quite understand that.

423
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,265
But now, seeing you in action,
it's finally starting to make sense.

424
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,933
Thank you for saying that.

425
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,227
I sometimes mess up though.

426
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,856
That's true. Way too often.

427
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:41,568
Well, I don't think
I mess up that often.

428
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,281
Anyway, regardless of our ranks,

429
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:49,201
you're like the big brother of the team.

430
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:52,371
I know you secretly take good care
of your colleagues.

431
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:56,333
I'm flattered.

432
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,418
I'm going to the bathroom...

433
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:00,796
I was about to say that.

434
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,840
Ah. What should we do?
We can't both go at the same time.

435
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,842
I can't hold it any longer.
I'll make it quick.

436
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,010
I'm at my limit too.

437
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:10,389
This calls for
rock-paper-scissors.

438
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:14,142
That's a good idea, but I'm your captain.

439
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,477
You said I was like a big brother.

440
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,479
- We're on duty now.
- That's true.

441
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,606
Then please go ahead.

442
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:22,776
I'll be right back, brother.

443
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:28,907
That selfish jerk.
Is this how he treats his big brother?

444
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,710
Ah, I'll give it a shot.

445
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:49,678
You shouldn't be sitting here.
I'm on duty.

446
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,097
Let me just stay here for a second
until my bus arrives.

447
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:56,017
It's still not allowed.

448
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,271
Why are you copying me?

449
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:00,439
I'm not.

450
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,656
Yes, you are.

451
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:10,740
No, I'm not.

452
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,534
To tell you the truth,

453
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,621
- you're the man of my dreams.
- What?

454
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:19,291
When I grow up,
I want to be a cop like you.

455
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:24,504
I think you mean I'm your role model.

456
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,006
A raw model?

457
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:28,091
A role model, not a raw model.

458
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,926
When is your bus coming anyway?

459
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:33,180
Let me see. Hmm...

460
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,475
Wait! I don't have to go
to the academy today.

461
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:39,269
Donggoo. What are you doing here?

462
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:40,437
Hello.

463
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:43,523
Goodbye, Mr. Raw Model.

464
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:44,983
Raw model!

465
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:53,241
What's wrong?

466
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,286
I'm a little thirsty.

467
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:02,834
I'd rather be out and about.
Stakeouts aren't for me.

468
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,962
I'm not good at staying still either,

469
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:10,759
but I'm never bored when I'm with you.

470
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,427
When you're with me?

471
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:15,680
I mean, because there's always
something happening.

472
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,934
Are you saying I make a lot of mistakes?

473
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,562
Captain, I might not look it,

474
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:25,357
but I'm actually a perfectionist.

475
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:28,235
If I may say so myself,

476
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:30,529
I rarely make mistakes.

477
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,030
I can see that.

478
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:33,907
That's my coffee, by the way.

479
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,451
This is mine.

480
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:40,622
"YUBIN'S"

481
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:41,873
I'm sorry.

482
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:43,750
You can drink both.

483
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:47,879
I'll buy you a new one later.

484
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:50,882
Can I ask you something?

485
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:52,759
What is it?

486
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:56,555
Why did you leave the US?

487
00:25:56,638 --> 00:26:00,350
I heard you never finished your studies.

488
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:03,019
Why did you choose to come back
and work in the field?

489
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:07,607
I realized studying wasn't for me.

490
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:08,733
And I...

491
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,654
...enjoy working in the field.

492
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:14,823
I see.

493
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:17,534
"A WITHDRAWAL HAS BEEN MADE"

494
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:20,745
Oh. The bank has confirmed a withdrawal.

495
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,872
- What?
- It must be that guy.

496
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,384
The name of their money mule
is Hwang Younghoon.

497
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:37,095
He's 21 years old,
and he's a member of the 007 Group.

498
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:38,805
- 007 Group?
- Yes.

499
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:42,642
All its members were born
between '00 and '07.

500
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:44,728
They're an MZ gang.

501
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:48,898
They've been growing fast,
so we've been keeping an eye on them.

502
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:51,359
They make money through online gambling,

503
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,194
crypto investment scams,
and illegal loans.

504
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,113
If they were born in '07,
they're underage.

505
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:56,615
That's right.

506
00:26:56,865 --> 00:27:00,952
School bullies are selected and trained
to join the gang.

507
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:04,164
Wow, really? Talk about early learning.

508
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:06,207
There were kids like them
at my school too.

509
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,293
Don't tell me you hung out with them.

510
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:09,711
No way.

511
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:13,048
This is what we know
about their organization so far.

512
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,758
Their organization is quite fragmented,

513
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:17,302
so we'll have to update the chart
as we gather more information.

514
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:20,972
Mastar at the top is basically
the boss of the MZ Union,

515
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,099
but we know nothing
about his identity yet.

516
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:26,603
What should we do?
We could raid them.

517
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:29,856
I agree. Let's tail
Hwang Younghoon,

518
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,691
and once we locate their office,

519
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,818
let's round them up all at once.

520
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,982
- So?
- How does it look?

521
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:16,736
There's only one entrance.
I think we should move in.

522
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,447
- What about the rooftop?
- The door to the rooftop is blocked.

523
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:23,201
Their office is on the third floor.
Everyone else has left.

524
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:24,911
This is our chance.

525
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:27,706
They're trapped. Let's do this.

526
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:30,834
They might have secured
another exit, so stay alert.

527
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:33,461
- Detective Jang, block their escape route.
- Yes, sir.

528
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,922
Detective Seo, stay in the car.
We might have to drive.

529
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:39,175
Detective Moo, Detective Jung,
and I are going into the building.

530
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:41,094
This might be our last chance for a while.

531
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:42,345
Let's get them no matter what.

532
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:43,430
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

533
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:52,605
- The door's locked.
- Get the tools. I'll break it open.

534
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:55,650
- Hold on. Let me take a look.
- Okay.

535
00:28:57,444 --> 00:29:00,697
Zero and seven are more worn out
than the others.

536
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,700
Since they're the 007 Group,
could the passcode be 007?

537
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:05,660
Ah.

538
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:08,830
The passcode has to be
at least four digits.

539
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:11,458
Four digits. In that case...

540
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,168
Could it be 0070?

541
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:20,300
0, 0, 7, 0.

542
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:21,384
Bam!

543
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:27,474
Are we going in?

544
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,559
One, two, three.

545
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:37,358
We're the Songwon Police.
May we have your attention?

546
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:40,904
Listen up. You're under arrest
for establishing illegal gambling websites

547
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:44,282
and violating
the Electronic Financial Transactions Act.

548
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:45,992
You have the right to remain...

549
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:47,744
What are you going on about?

550
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:53,333
Eat up.
And you have the right to an attorney.

551
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:54,417
What do you want?

552
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:55,502
- You bastard!
- Come here!

553
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,719
That must hurt. Are you okay?

554
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:09,891
That hurts! Please let go.
I think my shoulder's broken.

555
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,309
Hold on.

556
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,937
There are five bowls.
There must be one more person.

557
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:17,398
Over there! Get him, Detective Moo!

558
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:18,483
Go get him!

559
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:25,073
Get back here, you bastard!

560
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:27,408
Tansik, come around back.
There are stairs.

561
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,410
Okay. I'll be right there. Let's do this!

562
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:31,412
You've got this.

563
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,461
Excuse me!

564
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:39,838
Come here!

565
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,840
No! No!

566
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,258
You can't go!

567
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,305
- Hey!
- Hey!

568
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:50,682
- It's you!
- It's you!

569
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,394
- Gangmin!
- Jangpan!

570
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,273
I knew I recognized
the way you waddled.

571
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:00,692
- Get up, man.
- Thanks.

572
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:07,073
I knew it.
I did think your voice sounded familiar.

573
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:08,658
It's been so long.

574
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:10,743
You always said
you were going to be a cop.

575
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:11,911
Look at you now.

576
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:14,038
Yes, I'm a cop now.

577
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:17,792
You were working so hard
to become a movie director.

578
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,294
What happened?

579
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,671
- Dust yourself off.
- Thanks, man.

580
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,675
Hold on. I need to cuff you,

581
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:27,218
- I can't find my handcuffs.
- Handcuffs?

582
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,429
Where did they go?

583
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:32,140
Hey, they're in your back pocket.

584
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,933
I see.

585
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:36,269
You're so clumsy.
Are you sure you can bust bad guys?

586
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:37,353
You know me.

587
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,397
Give me your wrists. I need to cuff you.

588
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:41,816
You know how it goes.
You have the right to an attorney.

589
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,860
The Miranda warning.
You sound like a cop.

590
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:45,528
- I do?
- Yeah, it's so cool.

591
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:48,323
You may request a review
of your arrest's legality.

592
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:49,574
Your voice sounds so deep.

593
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:50,950
- Do I sound like a cop?
- Absolutely.

594
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:53,870
Bang!

595
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:56,873
- Hey, give me your other wrist.
- Sure.

596
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,877
- Your tattoo looks so cool.
- Right?

597
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,004
Should we put both of them behind bars?

598
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:06,549
SONGWON POLICE STATION
HAS MOVED TO A TEMPORARY LOCATION

599
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:09,677
We've arrested Song Gangmin
and updated the chart.

600
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,679
This is all we know for now.

601
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,140
There are still so many blanks.

602
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:16,643
Gangmin told us
everything he knew.

603
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:18,311
Are you defending him?

604
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:19,479
It's not like that.

605
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:21,230
I don't think he lied.

606
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,566
Their organization
is extremely fragmented.

607
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,109
They don't even know each other.

608
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,111
The guys we arrested

609
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,072
don't know each other's names or ages.

610
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:32,075
They even chat anonymously.
What are they, a virtual band?

611
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:33,534
How ridiculous.

612
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:34,911
What did they do with the cash?

613
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:38,247
They receive orders
from headquarters online,

614
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,458
put the cash in a locker
at a subway station,

615
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,418
and then people from headquarters
pick it up.

616
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:47,006
All our efforts will go to waste
if we fail to catch that guy, Mastar.

617
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:50,802
The Cyber Bureau launched
an arrest operation last year,

618
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:52,804
but they failed to bust the headquarters.

619
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:55,848
They did arrest most of those
who ran the branches,

620
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:59,060
but the organization has managed
to expand even further since.

621
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,687
What are they, a bunch of cockroaches?

622
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,897
Let's fill in the blanks one by one.

623
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,316
- That's the fun, isn't it?
- Okay.

624
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,610
Also, identify those
who are running the branches.

625
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:09,862
Are we going to arrest them right away?

626
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:13,074
No, we'll have to go after
the higher-ups at the same time.

627
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:16,160
How much do we know about Lawyer Yoon?

628
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,996
Nothing much.

629
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,665
All we know is
that his nickname is Lawyer Yoon.

630
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:22,375
Is he a real lawyer?

631
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:23,668
Not really.

632
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:25,086
He dropped out of law school,

633
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:28,006
but that's just what they call him.

634
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:31,676
He visited the branches only once
at the beginning.

635
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:34,512
Since then, all of his communications
have been online.

636
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,227
Bring in Song Gangmin
one more time.

637
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:42,937
I have more questions for him.

638
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,106
It's so cozy here.

639
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,482
- Cool, right?
- Totally.

640
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:50,570
You look like
a different person here.

641
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,531
You were such a dork back in school.

642
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:55,616
What? You were a bigger dork than me.

643
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,660
No way. I was super popular!

644
00:33:58,453 --> 00:33:59,537
By the way,

645
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,123
do cops really stand behind that wall?

646
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:03,791
- Behind that wall?
- Yeah.

647
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,085
I'm usually the one standing there.

648
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,170
That's amazing!

649
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:11,132
By the way, are you on social media?

650
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,551
Of course I am. I'm Gen Z.

651
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,803
That's great.
Give me your phone for a second.

652
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,513
- What for?
- You remember Minyeong?

653
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,849
- Yeah.
- I met her the other day,

654
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:21,726
and she seemed interested in you.

655
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:23,686
I'll show you her social media.

656
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:24,896
Talk to her if you want.

657
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:26,981
She's interested in me?
What's she up to these days?

658
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:30,485
She's a model.

659
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:36,282
Here you go.

660
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,036
- Can you unlock it?
- Sure.

661
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:44,999
- Okay.
- Okay.

662
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,086
- Did you get his phone?
- Here.

663
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,338
It's unlocked.

664
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:51,756
- Yes.
- Here, Captain.

665
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,299
Hey, you...

666
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:56,511
I'll try to set you up with Minyeong
if I ever get a hold of her.

667
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:57,678
Song Gangmin.

668
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:01,265
Is it true you sent all the money
to headquarters?

669
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:02,683
- What?
- You better tell the truth.

670
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:07,230
He mastered all
the lie detection techniques at the FBI.

671
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,903
- That's a lie, isn't it?
- No, it's true.

672
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,447
<i>FBI.</i>

673
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:22,203
- It's a lie.
- See? I told you.

674
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:26,374
MAP

675
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:28,209
"DAESEON FARM"

676
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,129
- Do you farm on the weekends?
- What?

677
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:35,716
<i>FBI.</i>

678
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:40,263
He doesn't. Did you say
they bury their cash in the ground?

679
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:43,808
Yes, they do that when they can't deposit
all the money in the bank.

680
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,601
You've been frequenting
Daeseon Farm.

681
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,770
- Did you bury the money there?
- No.

682
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:50,690
Unless you want to get your joints broken,
tell the truth.

683
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:54,986
Unless you want your joints broken

684
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:57,613
and crawl on all fours, get lost.

685
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:00,032
Okay! I prefer walking.

686
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:02,952
<i>Titan Club.</i>

687
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,331
That's right.

688
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,542
We buried it at Daeseon Farm.

689
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:12,795
Thanks for cooperating.

690
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,509
Thanks, buddy.

691
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:19,719
How could you...

692
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:22,388
Minyeong's married, by the way.

693
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,640
DAESEON FARM

694
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:27,226
The farm's way too big.

695
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,062
There's no way we can find the money here.

696
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,940
We can't possibly dig up the whole farm.

697
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,067
We don't even know
if the money really is here.

698
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:37,945
I'm sure there's a mark.

699
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:41,199
Otherwise, how would they
be able to find it themselves?

700
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:46,662
There has to be a mark somewhere.

701
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:54,795
"Knock, and the door
will be opened to you."

702
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:57,465
What are you doing?

703
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,676
I think I found it.

704
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:08,351
Thank you.

705
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:10,519
Let's go.

706
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:31,916
Captain.

707
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:33,376
Are you sure this is it?

708
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:37,630
Yes, this time, I'm more than 90% sure.

709
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:38,839
I'm positive.

710
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,717
Did they really bury it so deep?

711
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,929
Ah. Why would they do that?

712
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:52,561
Ah, can't you dig properly?

713
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:55,690
I said that's not how you do it!

714
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:58,651
This is how you do it.

715
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:00,027
The angle matters!

716
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:02,071
Stick your shovel in at 45 degrees.

717
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,282
Use your leverage and lift it.

718
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,075
That's the proper way to do it!

719
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:08,619
I'm doing my best.

720
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:16,043
Captain, stop fooling around

721
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,671
and just go get us some water.

722
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:21,549
But I want to help you.

723
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,634
Getting water is helping. Hurry up.

724
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:26,178
All right. I'll be right back.

725
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,140
They buried the money this deep?

726
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:31,017
That's crazy.

727
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:35,688
Captain.
I don't think this is the right spot.

728
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:37,273
Trust me.

729
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:40,860
I'm positive this is the right spot.

730
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,989
They couldn't have buried the money
so deep every time.

731
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:58,753
Oh, I found it! I found it!

732
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:06,844
<i>I found it!</i>

733
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:16,145
This has got to be
at least 10 billion won in total.

734
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:19,565
The number's so big
it doesn't feel real anymore.

735
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:22,568
We're literally
swimming in money.

736
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:25,488
I wish this were all mine.

737
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:29,367
The victims must've shed blood, sweat,
and tears to earn this money.

738
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,618
Those leeches.

739
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:33,871
Anyway, how did you find the money
on such a big farm?

740
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:37,583
Hey, don't even get me started.

741
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:41,587
I shed blood, sweat, and tears
because of a certain someone.

742
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:44,465
I'm done.

743
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:45,716
Did you count it properly?

744
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,343
Of course. It's perfect this time.

745
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:51,097
Check Junghwan's pockets.

746
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,807
What? What are you talking about?

747
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,767
- What are you doing?
- What are you hiding?

748
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,018
- Nothing.
- Let me see.

749
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,771
- My goodness.
- Where do you think you're going?

750
00:39:58,854 --> 00:39:59,897
The bathroom.

751
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,318
<i>At a bar in Seoul,</i>

752
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:07,154
<i>dozens of well-built men in their twenties</i>

753
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,989
<i>suddenly broke out into a fight,</i>

754
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,991
<i>leaving the bar in shambles.</i>

755
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:14,453
<i>They are Gen MZ gangsters</i>

756
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:17,748
<i>born between the 1980s and 2000s.</i>

757
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:21,377
<i>They have amassed wealth
through white-collar crimes</i>

758
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,629
<i>such as running illegal gambling websites</i>

759
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:26,298
<i>and orchestrating
cryptocurrency investment scams.</i>

760
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:30,052
<i>As Gen MZ emerges as
the new driving force in gang activities,</i>

761
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:32,638
<i>the police are intensifying
their investigative efforts.</i>

762
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:36,851
<i>However, their increasingly sophisticated
crimes make them more difficult to arrest.</i>

763
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:49,572
Have you found out anything more
about Lawyer Yoon?

764
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:54,118
No, nothing much. He's quite elusive.

765
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,996
We're in a race against time.

766
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:01,584
We'll have to make Lawyer Yoon come to us.

767
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:07,423
That would make things easier, but how?

768
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:08,591
Let's start a gang.

769
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:12,011
That sounds like a great... Sorry?

770
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:13,679
Start a what?

771
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:15,389
From now on,

772
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,558
we're the Dongbang Group.

773
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:34,450
