Entered the Police University

00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,903
…then graduated as the top student.

6
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,281
These guys are evil.

7
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:15,825
Working in the White-Collar Crimes Team
at headquarters,

8
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,077
contributed to the arrest

00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,245
of the biggest Ponzi scheme organization

00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:23,917
Promoted by one rank
and commended by the commissioner.

11
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:34,219
Later joined the Special Operations Unit,

00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:36,596

Always by your side

15
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,066
Doing our best to serve the people

16
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:52,153
Promotional video

00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,863

Won the grand prize in policy promotion,

as well as the special award

00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:07,794
Later completed a PhD program in
Applied Criminology at New York College.

22
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,049
Attended the FBI's leadership program

23
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,845
and was selected
as an honorary top FBI agent.

24
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:20,431
But you're still determined
to hit the field?

25
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:21,808
Don't you think
your résumé is going to waste?

26
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,309
Not really.

27
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:26,771
I was summoned all morning
with no breaks in between until now.

28
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,065
You know we're struggling
with all the jurisdiction tweaks.

29
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,109
It's like a war every single day.

30
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,153
The battlefield is here, not out there.

31
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:37,824
Yes? What is it?

32
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:40,076
Commissioner,
I was about to order lunch boxes.

33
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,161
What would you like?

34
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,829
The one we had last time.

35
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:43,913
The Royal Meal?

36
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,790
There are the Left, Right,
or Chief State Councilor sets.

37
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:46,958
The Chief State Councilor set.

38
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,127
Where were we?

39
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,296
The Royal Meal.
You chose the Chief State Councilor set.

40
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,673
Not that.
Are you messing with me right now?

41
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:56,551
I understand what you're saying,
but I want to learn more in the field.

42
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,887
If you do, how can you
turn things upside down like this?

43
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,180
I didn't turn things upside down.

44
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,765
-You're the one who's upside down.
-What?

45
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,352
Why do you think
I'm on this thing upside down?

46
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,604
It's because of punks like you

47
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,606
-that my back's gone out!
-Oh.

48
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,609
The doctor says it's stress-induced.

49
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:16,404
You think hanging here
for 10 minutes every day is easy?

50
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,242
What's going on?

51
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,620
My goodness. Looks like it's broken.

52
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:24,787
Jeez.

53
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,415
What are you waiting for?
Come hold my head.

54
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:28,708
Yes, sir.

55
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,510
Please assign me
to the Violent Crimes Team.

56
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:54,609
Episode 1

57
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:11,417
The package is on the move.
Do we proceed now?

58
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:14,796
Hold off for now.

59
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,631
Make the move
as soon as he makes the handoff.

60
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:19,133
Everyone, stay sharp.
If we lose him, we're all fired.

61
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,551
Gosh, my stomach.

62
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,907
Captain, I've found the item.

63
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,539
Detective Jang,
what are you doing? You're too close!

64
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,291
Back off…

65
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,959
Why's this acting up?

66
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:09,350
This won't do.

67
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:13,855
One, two, three.

68
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,316
One, two. One, two.

69
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,820
Oh, don't mind me.

70
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:23,740
Huh?

71
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:25,908
Hmm.

72
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,994
- Put your hand down!
- Sorry, my bad!

73
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,288
Seriously?

74
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:31,497
Why would you respond?

75
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,419
You idiot!

76
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,630
I won't do it again, sir.

77
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,219
What's your deal?

78
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,570
Hey, run!

79
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:04,197
Wait a second…

80
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,873
Damn it!

81
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:16,084
Forget the delivery bike.
Go after the package!

82
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,877
Damn it!

83
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,295
- Hurry!
- Let me put my shoes on.

84
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,963
Whoa!

85
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,804
-What the--
-What are you doing?

86
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,223
Hurry up and reel it in!

87
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:33,643
-It's a big one!
-You can't miss this! Catch it!

88
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,120
Don't move!

89
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:53,871
I'll shoot if you do--

90
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,046
Tansik, are you okay?

91
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,842
Tansik, answer me!

92
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,681
-Move!
-Move!

93
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,724
Hey! Move!

94
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,729
Go, Minseo and Junghwan!

95
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,022
Go get him!

96
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,527
Hey, stop!

97
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,572
We almost got him.

98
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,075
Come here!

99
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:39,125
-We've got him!
-No, we don't!

100
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,878
-Pedal harder!
-Isn't there supposed to be a seat?

101
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,467
Ah!

102
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,179
-Minseo, wait…
-Just get off then!

103
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,046
Whoa…

104
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,130
Hold on!

105
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,966
What the hell, Junghwan?

106
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,677
Was there no seat from the beginning?

107
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:35,264
Hey!

108
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:37,850
Why are you scared, you punk?

109
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,685
- Who are you?
- Me?

110
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,479
Hey, stop!

111
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:42,813
I won't stop!

112
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,982
Fine, keep going.

113
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:48,694
Stop. I said stop!

114
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,112
Wait a second, this thing…

115
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,323
How do you stop this thing?

116
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:53,491
How should I know?

117
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,117
Come here! Quick!

118
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:58,120
I said, come here!

119
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,205
Hey!

120
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,583
Come here!

121
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:05,753
Come here!

122
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,839
Come here!
How do I stop this?

123
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,216
Hey!

124
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:15,513
I think he's still hiding around here.

125
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:16,973
Here you go, Captain.

126
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,433
Thanks.

127
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,813
What's wrong with your face?

128
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,356
I got hit by a taser.

129
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,942
-And your voice too?
-It's from the taser too.

130
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,402
Who fired the taser?

131
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,534
-I did.
-Truly amazing work.

132
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,204
-What do you have there?
-Nothing, sir.

133
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,706
- What's that noise?
- It's nothing.

134
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,165
- Come on, what is it?
- Nothing.

135
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,375
Let me see. What is it?

136
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,460
Earlier, the fisherman said
it was a big catch,

137
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,796
and he caught it for me.

138
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,007
-We can make fish stew later--
-What are you doing?

139
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,758
Not catching the criminal
but catching what?

140
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,927
- A big catch?
- Please calm down.

141
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,888
What the hell were you thinking?

142
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,349
Pack your belongings and leave!

143
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:03,936
This is serious.

144
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:10,484
I can't believe
I had to talk with the Inspection Team.

145
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,946
In my 30 years in the force,
shit has really hit the fan this time.

146
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,700
Captain, I packed all your medicine.

147
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:23,414
It was not nice knowing you,
and let's never see each other again.

148
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,756
- He's gone.
- Okay.

149
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:34,717
Let's go.

150
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,968
Come in!

151
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,138
You should go.

152
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:40,514
-Go.
-Stop it.

153
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,933
-What do you mean, "Stop it"?
-Go.

154
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,403
- Attention. Salute.
- Don't.

155
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,822
Don't even bother
with salutes or greetings.

156
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,866
Yes, sir.

157
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:02,036
Right, don't bother.

158
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,830
- Yes, sir.
- It just makes parting harder.

159
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,540
Be quiet.

160
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,876
I ought to fire all of you.

161
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,379
But only the captain suffered.

162
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,048
Do you know where Captain Yoon
has been transferred to?

163
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:16,550
Somewhere in the South Sea…
Where was it again?

164
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,219
Somewhere far off the coast
of the South Sea…

165
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,685
They said on a clear day,
you can even see Japan.

166
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,853
That's quite far, isn't it?

167
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:31,107
You all should pack up too.

168
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,817
Why should we?

169
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:38,239
We haven't been told about any transfers.

170
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:41,951
The department is undergoing construction.

171
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:45,830
We've arranged a temporary office,
so you'll be there for a while.

172
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:48,332
But why should we move?

173
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,835
In terms of seniority,
we've been around way longer than Team 3!

174
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:51,961
You little…

175
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,881
They may not have the experience,

176
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,175
but they have a great track record.

177
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,885
Unlike…

178
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:03,013
you idiots!

179
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,141
Still, we have way more experience--

180
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,350
I swear I'll kill you.

181
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,853
A temporary office, you said?

182
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,020
Where exactly is it?

183
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,399
Go and pack your things.

184
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,359
-We'll do our best--
-Just don't.

185
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,737
- Don't. Just go.
- Attention.

186
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,072
I said no salutes!

187
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,579
I hate those damn fools!

188
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:30,291
SONGWON POLICE STATION

189
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,513
Building on lease at a huge discount

190
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,526
"Shit Well Daycare Center."

191
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,570
"Shit Well Daycare Center"?

192
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:22,009
Wish-It-Well Daycare Center

193
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,093
Sun Class

194
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:31,602
Sprout Class

195
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,981
Seriously? I'm so annoyed.

196
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,066
Moon Class

197
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,778
Director's Office

198
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,617
Damn it.

199
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:54,333
Hey. That's the Rainbow Class,
and that's the Sun Class.

200
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,585
So are we the Violent Crimes Class?

201
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,128
This isn't right.

202
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,297
Are we children?
How can we work in a daycare center?

203
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,382
They said

204
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:03,717
they sold this place for cheap
after it closed down.

205
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,929
Are they leaving all these behind?

206
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,264
Ooh!

207
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,266
This would be perfect for Hana.

208
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,520
Still, this isn't right.

209
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,772
How are we supposed to do any work here?

210
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:20,067
They're basically telling us
to take it or leave it.

211
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,236
Damn it!

212
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:24,613
Let's all just quit. Let's go!

213
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,241
Why would we quit?

214
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,535
If we quit, do you have a plan?
Did you win the lottery?

215
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:30,995
Do we have to win the lottery to quit?

216
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:41,505
Hey rookie, can't you read the room?

217
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:42,715
Yes, ma'am.

218
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,968
If I hear that noise one more time,

219
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,304
I'll have you making that same noise.

220
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,680
I won't do it again.

221
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,392
Everyone, let's not get too emotional

222
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:56,854
and think more calmly
about how we ended up here.

223
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,064
What we should think about is…

224
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,078
So let's be logical
and come up with a plan.

225
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,372
Let's think it over--

226
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,629
I swear I'll wring your neck!

227
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,589
- Stop!
- I'll kill you!

228
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:29,303
You idiot!

229
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:45,235
Seoul Busters

230
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,237
- Police officers!
- Hello!

231
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,615
Hi.

232
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:53,202
Songwon Police Station
has moved to a temporary location

233
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,380
Ugh, shut up!

234
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:08,300
Seo Minseo
30 years old, Corporal

235
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,094
Stop it already. We can't do anything now.

236
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:12,638
I'm not mad at you guys.

237
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:15,099
I'm just really angry at myself.

238
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:19,269
Moo Joongryeok
41 years old, Lieutenant

239
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,896
You're stirring up the dust in here.

240
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,148
- You know I have sensitive lungs.
- Jeez.

241
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:25,776
Whoa!

242
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,528
You haven't paid yet.

243
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:30,072
-Wait, you have to pay first.
-Gosh, that's cold.

244
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,533
It was your idea
to have one person pay anyway.

245
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,284
How much is the total?

246
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,869
That'll be 33,000 won.

247
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,663
33,000…

248
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,166
- Rookie, is this yours?
- Yes.

249
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,669
Thank you.

250
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:46,839
Detective Moo,
thank you for the coffee.

251
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:50,175
Did you order coffee to take a bath in it?

252
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,260
Can you even finish that?

253
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,429
I only drink jumbo sizes.

254
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,933
Jang Tansik
29 years old, Officer

255
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,351
Jeez!

256
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,355
I need to go now. I'm running late.

257
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,732
All right, all right.

258
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:08,986
You sure took your sweet time
with the delivery, and yet…

259
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:12,156
Come on! My delivery rating will go down!

260
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,658
The address was to Songwon Police Station,
but this is a daycare.

261
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:15,826
Of course I was late.

262
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:16,910
You're not even children.

263
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,662
But this was an express delivery!

264
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,665
It was, but I was late
because you put in the wrong address!

265
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,542
- All set.
- What's wrong with this?

266
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,919
Hey. What's going on?

267
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,589
Why won't this work?

268
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:30,841
You think that'll do anything?

269
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:33,594
I think this is broken!

270
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:34,720
Hey.

271
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,688
I think you're the defective one.

272
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,148
Detective Jung,
that was amazing!

273
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,524
Have a nice day.

274
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:48,650
Wait a second.

275
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:54,323
Thank you so much-- Hmm?

276
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,532
Detective Jung Junghwan

277
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,159
Use that number for the rewards.

278
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:00,162
Jung Junghwan
36 years old, Sergeant

279
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,333
When will they fix the bathroom here?

280
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,918
We have to use
the one on the second floor.

281
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,087
How inconvenient.

282
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,340
-Tansik, give me my coffee.
-Yes, sir.

283
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,595
Hey.

284
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:17,888
Good work.

285
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:18,972
- Thank you.
- Is this an amusement park?

286
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,349
It's not bad though.

287
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,643
-They can be dispatched quickly.
-Right.

288
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,438
One day, I will too.

289
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:38,242
Hey, do you really have to go
right now? While I'm like this?

290
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,369
Between us,
what's the big deal?

291
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,912
What's between us?

292
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:46,416
Joongryeok, I've been thinking
about our team captain.

293
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,794
Well, there's no talk of a new captain.

294
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,546
Maybe it's your turn to get promoted.

295
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,175
I mean, most of your peers
have already become captains.

296
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,344
So it must be your turn now.

297
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,596
No way. That's ridiculous.

298
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,515
Why is it ridiculous?
It makes perfect sense.

299
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:04,560
With your skills, background,
and looks, you're perfect.

300
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,061
If you don't become the captain,

301
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,187
I'm quitting.

302
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,690
Sure, of course you will.

303
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:12,526
Hey, we're in the middle
of an important conversation.

304
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:13,902
I'm sorry, sir.

305
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,737
But I have to go number two.

306
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,072
- Hey.
- What?

307
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,242
Don't do that.

308
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:23,203
Seriously?

309
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,542
Dear God…

310
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,762
-Whoa, what in the…
-What the hell was that?

311
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,514
-That smell…
-Damn.

312
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:43,932
Whoa, what the heck?

313
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,476
What's this?

314
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,187
It's a Parasaurolophus.

315
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,771
-Para-what?
-It's a dinosaur.

316
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,148
Parasaurolophus.

317
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:53,400
Hana is really into dinosaurs these days.

318
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:54,860
I'll give this to her.

319
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,279
Hey…

320
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,829
- Rookie, get the phone!
- On it!

321
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,083
This is the Songwon Police
Violent Crimes Team.

322
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,510
This is the Songwon Police
Violent Crimes Team.

323
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:21,803
Yes… Yes.

324
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,056
Someone's looking for a detective.

325
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:27,976
What are you then, a teacher?

326
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:29,937
You think this is a real daycare center?

327
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,022
Uh… Yes, go ahead.

328
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:36,318
They're reporting a death.

329
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,329
First time in the field, right?

330
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,005
How did you end up
on the Violent Crimes Team?

331
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,924
Where were you before?

332
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,676
-Traffic--
-Dealing with hit-and-runs?

333
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,011
Not hit-and-runs.
I was in the control room.

334
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,179
Just the control room?

335
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,723
Not just any control room,
but the comprehensive control room.

336
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,726
I can't comprehensively
understand this situation.

337
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,937
You were in the control room,
then came to Violent Crimes?

338
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,983
Ah, it's always been my dream
to work in Violent Crimes.

339
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:18,485
-Your dream?
-I know I may seem inexperienced

340
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:20,737
and clumsy in your eyes,

341
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,948
but I really worked hard
to come to the Violent Crimes Team.

342
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:24,324
I prepared a lot.

343
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,745
Please give me a chance.

344
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,292
Sure, why not?

345
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,127
Thank you, sir.

346
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,212
- Turn left ahead.
- Left turn.

347
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:39,840
Left turn.

348
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,591
-Left is that way!
-I'm sorry.

349
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,593
Left turn… There's a car!

350
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,554
I'm sorry, sir.

351
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:46,722
You little…

352
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,224
Going off course.
Recalculating.

353
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,851
-Damn it.
-Oh.

354
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,811
I won't do it again, sir!

355
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,896
Are you okay?

356
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,117
Which floor did you say?

357
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:08,952
Third floor. Unit 302.

358
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:13,623
It feels ominous somehow.

359
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,792
Look at the weather.

360
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:18,462
I've got a bad feeling about this.

361
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,553
You learned
how to process a scene, right?

362
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,472
-Yes, in theory.
-Just do as you were taught.

363
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,391
The forensic team will be here soon.

364
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:15,936
By myself?

365
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,896
Don't mess things up too much. Go.

366
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,065
Go.

367
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:21,566
-Yes, sir.
-Go.

368
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,660
Goodness.

369
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,585
- That man…
- Why, what's wrong?

370
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:23,086
Sorry for the long wait.

371
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,671
I was looking for my medicine.

372
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,339
It's okay. I just got here.

373
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,675
May I give you a ride to the hospital?

374
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:32,179
Like I always tell you, I can take a taxi.

375
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:35,098
Why take a taxi when we're here?

376
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:38,602
But was there a burglary here?

377
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,020
A burglary?

378
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:41,188
About the deceased…

379
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,565
-What about the deceased?
-The deceased isn't actually dead.

380
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,358
What? How can the deceased not be dead?

381
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,277
He's deceased because he's dead.

382
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:54,993
Who are you guys?

383
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,247
Wait. I'm getting a call.

384
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:03,710
Junghwan, we're here. What's going on?

385
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,588
-We're right here at…
-407 Dorim-dong.

386
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,340
407 Dorim-dong.

387
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:10,759
Dorim-dong?
Not Dorim-dong, Daerim-dong.

388
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:11,843
You're not in Dorim-dong, are you?

389
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:14,721
Why, you…

390
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,641
What are you guys doing here?

391
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:19,893
What are you doing in my house?

392
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,775
Run!

393
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:35,033
Black raspberry wine

394
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:37,953
This is a crime scene.
No photos.

395
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,205
But I live just right there.

396
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:42,249
- Where are you going?
- Goodness…

397
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:46,378
My goodness. What a mess.

398
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,632
You should have checked the address.

399
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:53,635
I clearly heard it was Dorim-dong.

400
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,470
How can Daerim-dong be Dorim-dong?

401
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,764
Is this a "hod," not a head?

402
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,266
A "bron," not a brain?

403
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:02,811
I'm so embarrassed because of you,
I could just…

404
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,229
- Detective Moo.
- Yes.

405
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:05,689
Did you find anything?

406
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:06,940
We'll look more into it,

407
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:08,900
but it looks like a suicide.

408
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,944
-We found a note.
-I see.

409
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:12,279
Should I hold onto it?

410
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:14,489
No, Detective Jang, you…

411
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,616
Yes, just say the word.

412
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:21,454
Junghwan, come here.

413
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:22,914
- Minseo, let's wrap up.
- Okay.

414
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,541
The estimated time of death

415
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:26,376
-is between 10 and 11 last night.
-Yes.

416
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:29,004
The father came here on the first train
due to a relative's wedding

417
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,297
and found his son dead.

418
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,424
Since the note was found…

419
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,884
No signs of forced entry or struggle,

420
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,469
and with the note found, case closed.

421
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,054
What's that you're holding?

422
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:41,600
It's nothing.
Someone had thrown these out.

423
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:44,728
They're in decent condition, aren't they?

424
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:46,313
Perfect for playing with Hana and Doona.

425
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:48,189
These are quite expensive to buy new.

426
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:51,026
- What's with you?
- All right. Have fun with that.

427
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,194
Jeez.

428
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,988
And have him write the report.

429
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,908
What did I tell you?
I had a feeling it was suicide.

430
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,535
Just had a hunch.

431
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:03,580
With a hunch that bad,
you won't be able to stand up straight.

432
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:07,500
Who's this?

433
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:29,606
I'm so tired. Goodbye. Sorry, Dad.

434
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:32,192
A printed note alone isn't enough
to confirm the cause of death.

435
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:33,985
This is a basic part
of crime scene analysis.

436
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,196
It appears the basics are lacking here.

437
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,280
Wouldn't you agree?

438
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:38,823
He's right.

439
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,659
They do lack the basics.

440
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,410
-Who are you?
-Quick to judge,

441
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,788
slow to act, and careless in speech.

442
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:47,082
No wonder Songwon Police's
Violent Crimes Team 2

443
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,167
is number one in the nation
in terms of performance.

444
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,585
The number one worst.

445
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:53,963
-Hey.
-Mister.

446
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:57,467
Itching for a beating, aren't you?

447
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:01,179
Come on. If he's itchy, he'll scratch it.

448
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:04,432
Consider yourself lucky
for not getting punched this time.

449
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,559
-Just back off, okay?
-Okay.

450
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:10,689
But I guess not having any habits
is better than having bad ones.

451
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:13,942
Hey, who do you think you are, huh?

452
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:18,279
I'm the new captain, Dongbang Yubin.

453
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,700
Dongbang Yubin
37 years old, Senior Inspector

454
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:44,723
It's an honor to work for you, sir.
I'm Sergeant Jung Junghwan.

455
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,349
Welcome, Captain.

456
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,897
Oh!

457
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,694
I'd like to have a look around the scene.

458
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:58,987
Please, this way.

459
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:29,476
You can't smoke in here.

460
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,480
It's chocolate.

461
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:36,608
Oh, chocolate?

462
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:38,193
Our brain accounts for
about 2% of our body weight

463
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,987
but consumes over 20% of our energy.

464
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,698
The most important thing
for brain function is the supply of sugar.

465
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,952
The suicide note being so short
also raises suspicions.

466
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:51,539
Lies tend to be brief and to the point
to avoid suspicion.

467
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,334
Indeed. You're absolutely correct.

468
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:55,502
Correct, my foot.

469
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:58,588
But we can't rule out a suicide
based on that alone.

470
00:29:58,671 --> 00:29:59,756
I'm not ruling it out.

471
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:02,175
It's just too early
to definitively say it is.

472
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:03,468
Did you check out the printer?

473
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:05,345
We did, sir.

474
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:06,763
Could you bring me
some printer paper, please?

475
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,307
Yes, sir.

476
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:12,018
Why do we need the paper?

477
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:22,779
Here's a sheet of printer paper, sir.

478
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,333
Just as I thought.

479
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:37,961
This seems like cheaper paper
that weighs less than 3 oz.

480
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:40,630
It's not like you have scales for hands.

481
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,715
Hey, they actually do feel
a bit different.

482
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:43,883
What does that matter?

483
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,802
How does that change anything?

484
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:48,721
There are plenty of internet cafés nearby.
He could've easily gone to one.

485
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:51,641
Maybe he got super frustrated
while gaming,

486
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:53,977
felt depressed, and thought,
"I might as well end it all."

487
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:57,772
Then he saw a printer
and decided to print out a suicide note.

488
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,440
No, that's absolutely not a possibility.

489
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,317
Never rely on coincidence
at a crime scene.

490
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,027
That's a basic principle of investigation.

491
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,989
The possibility of forgery is high.

492
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:09,534
What is he saying?

493
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,372
Hey.

494
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:17,959
They never told us we had a new captain.

495
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:19,669
What do you think of him?

496
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:23,256
Looks like
he became captain through connections,

497
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:26,301
considering his age and everything.
I really don't like him.

498
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,011
Same here.

499
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:30,263
Shouldn't Joongryeok
have been promoted to captain?

500
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:32,265
How cruel of them.

501
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:34,517
Hey, you're the worst one.

502
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,983
Wait! Did you think before speaking?

503
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,068
Did you think?

504
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:47,113
Minseo, you keep an eye on him
for the time being.

505
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:49,115
-Why me?
-Then should we do it?

506
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:51,117
You two can do it.

507
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,827
Then should Tansik do it?

508
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,705
Wow! There's something quite exceptional
about our captain,

509
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:56,915
don't you think?

510
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,935
Smile and say kind words to be a good kid

511
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:19,312
I'll now start with the case briefing.

512
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:22,357
The deceased's name is Lim Dongil.

513
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,610
28 years old and born in 1996, you rat…

514
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:34,452
I mean, the Year of the Rat.

515
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:35,745
Yeah.

516
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:39,457
As for family,
he has one father living in Cheongju…

517
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,959
Usually, there's just one father.

518
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:48,466
Exactly. Anyway,
he moved to Seoul three years ago

519
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,343
and worked as a road manager…

520
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,512
…at an entertainment company.

521
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,181
"Road manager"?

522
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:57,475
What's that? So he managed a road?

523
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:58,893
Road manager.

524
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:04,148
It's the kind of manager
that manages celebrities on the road.

525
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,483
Okay, okay, okay.

526
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,236
Right, well…
he did that kind of work.

527
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:11,698
For the past year, he managed
the schedule of actor Kang Minjae--

528
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:12,865
Kang Minjae?

529
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:14,826
No way. Kang Minjae?

530
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:16,411
-Who's that?
-You don't know Kang Minjae?

531
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:19,414
The Kang Minjae who became a star
through a globally-streamed TV show?

532
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:23,459
The lead of the huge hit Octopus Game.
Don't you know him?

533
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:25,420
-I don't know him.
-Why should I know him?

534
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:26,587
So, he's famous?

535
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,173
You all truly know nothing.

536
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,759
Have all of you been living under a rock?

537
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,761
This is why our team is in this situation.

538
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:37,056
How do you not know the person
at the forefront of Korean content?

539
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,850
The hot and happening Kang Minjae?

540
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:41,352
-I don't know him either.
-Mm…

541
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:44,188
It's understandable for you not to know,
as you were in the States.

542
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,482
What's the big deal about celebrities?

543
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,526
There are so many of them.

544
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:51,571
-What about the CCTV?
-The apartment is over 20 years old,

545
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:53,865
so there were no CCTVs.
We're securing footage from the area.

546
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:56,367
It's definitely a suicide.

547
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,494
What? What's this?

548
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:00,079
It's a Triceratops.

549
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:02,040
This is quite popular among kids.

550
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:04,834
-What is this, Jurassic Park?
-It's a Styracosaurus.

551
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:06,919
Dongbang Yubin's Encyclopedia

552
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,087
-What?
-Pardon?

553
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:10,548
The horn shape is different
from that of a Triceratops.

554
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:14,343
Triceratops: 3 horns
Styracosaurus: 6 horns

555
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:16,012
A Triceratops is not a Styracosaurus!

556
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:22,560
I'll go to the agency
where the victim worked.

557
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:24,353
It would be nice
if someone could go with me.

558
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:31,527
Uh, well…

559
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:36,407
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

560
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:41,370
Catch a tiger by the toe.

561
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:43,498
Ah.

562
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:46,292
If it hollers,

563
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,377
-let it go.
-Gosh, my stomach.

564
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,881
- Eeny, meeny…
- Oh no, it's coming out.

565
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,176
-…miny…
-It's coming out.

566
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,804
-…moe--
-I'll go with you, sir.

567
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:01,933
Then Detective Seo, you're chosen.
Let's go.

568
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,017
Okay.

569
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:11,025
Minseo.

570
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,027
Good luck.

571
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:19,784
JMT Entertainment

572
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,035
Romantic Lawyer

573
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:24,705
The CEO, Mr. Jang, is quite tall.

574
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:27,416
Looks about the same height
as Kang Minjae.

575
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,876
No, he isn't that tall.

576
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,504
Have you met him?

577
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:33,005
No.

578
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:35,925
Then how do you know his height?

579
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:37,885
By looking at you.

580
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:39,470
I'm sorry?

581
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,472
It's by triangulation.

582
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:44,183
You're probably
about five feet five inches.

583
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:45,309
Uh…

584
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:46,853
It's actually five feet six inches.

585
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,396
Okay, sure.

586
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:52,150
People usually hang pictures or paintings
at their own eye level.

587
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,361
And seeing how much you're looking up,

588
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:57,613
Mr. Jang is probably
about four inches taller than you.

589
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:59,115
So about five nine.

590
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:01,534
-It would be five ten.
-Okay, sure.

591
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:02,869
If they appear similar in the photo,

592
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:05,496
it could be because
Kang Minjae bent his knees a bit.

593
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,373
And you know that just by looking?

594
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:11,419
It's not exactly knowing.
Let's just say there's a high probability.

595
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:13,588
How does that…

596
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:17,717
What else do you see probability-wise?

597
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,635
Hmm…

598
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,812
Left-handed

599
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,230
Well, he's left-handed.

600
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,441
Sunscreen SPF 100+
Tiger oil

601
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:38,446
Wet dirt

602
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,156
He recently traveled to Southeast Asia,

603
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:43,242
has poor vision
but prefers not to wear glasses,

604
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,078
and likes to work out,
so he exercises diligently.

605
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:48,664
You should read fortunes.

606
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,708
Seems like you'd make a lot of money.

607
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,752
I'm not good enough to read fortunes.

608
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,671
Even one's handwriting alone
can reveal a lot.

609
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,673
It's the realm of the subconscious.

610
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:01,385
Goodness. Sorry for the long wait.

611
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:03,095
I'm Jang Taesik.

612
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:07,683
Oh! I'm sorry. I'm left-handed.

613
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:09,810
I'm Dongbang Yubin
from the Songwon Police.

614
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,854
- Ah.
- And this is Detective Seo Minseo.

615
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:12,939
-Hello.
-Hello.

616
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:14,941
Please, have a seat.

617
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,069
I've been so busy these days.

618
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,364
I just got back
from the Philippines this morning.

619
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:22,490
I see.

620
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,075
I haven't even eaten yet.

621
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:27,787
I've ordered some food,
so if it's not too much trouble…

622
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,580
Please go ahead.

623
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,916
You're quite modest.

624
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:35,419
With you being a CEO,
I thought you'd only eat the finest foods.

625
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:38,339
No, I don't do that.
I eat like anyone else.

626
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:47,306
I heard about the incident.

627
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,600
So the person who committed suicide
was our employee.

628
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,310
-Not exactly.
-I'm sorry?

629
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:54,146
It hasn't been concluded as suicide yet.

630
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:56,607
Is that so?

631
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,567
I heard it was suicide.

632
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:01,195
Were you close with Mr. Lim Dongil
by any chance?

633
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:05,533
Do I have any reason to be close
with a junior road manager?

634
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,785
Just saw him around, you know?

635
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,579
Mr. Kang Minjae
is aware of the incident, right?

636
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:13,249
Minjae is somewhat shocked.

637
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,960
After all, they'd been working
closely together for over a year.

638
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:17,670
Mm.

639
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,339
How was the relationship
between Mr. Kang Minjae and Lim Dongil?

640
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:25,845
Well, Minjae is quite nice
to everyone on his staff, and…

641
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,930
he really treats them well.

642
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:30,057
Mm.

643
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:37,106
I have weak lungs,
so I use a sensitive air purifier.

644
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:38,774
It's probably reacting
to the smell of the food.

645
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:40,151
I see.

646
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:43,654
It seems you also review scripts
when selecting projects?

647
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:47,491
I have an excellent instinct.

648
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:51,329
If I find it interesting,
strangely, it tends to do well.

649
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:54,123
So I review all the scripts first.

650
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:56,500
It would be good to speak
with Mr. Kang Minjae as well.

651
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,669
Unfortunately,
he's all booked today.

652
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:02,465
Then, please contact us…

653
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,425
when Mr. Kang is available.

654
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,302
- Sure, I'll do that.
- Thank you.

655
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:09,221
Gosh.

656
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:12,141
Don't get it wrong.
That noise was from the sofa.

657
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,567
It wasn't me!

658
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,903
It made a noise when I moved like this.

659
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:25,863
You know, like this. Why won't it do it?

660
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:28,574
Like this, like this!

661
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:33,412
Why is that doing that?
Has it gone crazy?

662
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,873
Crazy? Who? Me?

663
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:38,334
-Let's have dinner?
-No, that thing is crazy!

664
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:39,710
Let's have it next time! Next time!

665
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,712
-You have neck pain?
-Buy a new one!

666
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,798
- I'm saying that thing is crazy!
- You hurt yourself?

667
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:46,092
I moved like this, and it made the noise.

668
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:47,676
Good thing I bought this.

669
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:49,804
Tiger oil.

670
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:54,975
Captain.

671
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,894
I know it's weird
to keep talking about this,

672
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:58,646
but in the office… I mean…

673
00:39:58,729 --> 00:39:59,730
What is it?

674
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:02,316
About the noise… It's not what you think.

675
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,609
I feel so misunderstood.

676
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:07,029
It wasn't me.
The noise was really from the sofa,

677
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,697
but that crazy air purifier--

678
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:11,409
Hello. I'm from the Songwon Police.

679
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:14,120
May I ask you a few questions?

680
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:17,957
- Sure.
- Let me help you with these.

681
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:20,042
Like this?

682
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,586
My eyes are about to pop out.

683
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,923
Is this youngster being stubborn
just because he's the captain?

684
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:28,717
Just like you said,
this is obviously a suicide.

685
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,302
We're making a mountain out of a molehill.

686
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:31,387
Joongryeok.

687
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:35,057
I seriously think it's time
you got that promotion.

688
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:38,185
- Your experience isn't just full.
- It's overflowing.

689
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:40,646
What's the deal with skipping the line

690
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:43,524
just because he got a shiny diploma
from the Police University?

691
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,151
Are you just a hurdle?

692
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,445
Everyone's just leaping over you
without a second thought.

693
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,488
Do they think you're a pushover or what?

694
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:53,701
There's a saying, after all.
"Even a worm will turn when stepped on."

695
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:54,785
You little…

696
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:57,079
-What?
-I really wanted to poke your eyes out.

697
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:02,668
Wait a second.
Isn't that guy following Lim Dongil?

698
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:04,545
He's following him, right?

699
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:08,215
Seems like it, but it's too blurry.
I can't see his face properly.

700
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,301
Oh? That's Jeon Minsik.

701
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:13,679
How do you know this guy?

702
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:16,557
I got several complaints against him
for online shopping fraud.

703
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,058
You're on his case?

704
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:21,145
Not officially,
but I've been tracking him on my own.

705
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:22,605
Why on your own?

706
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:26,150
I personally got scammed by him
trying to buy a laptop.

707
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:28,694
I should never have wired him the money.

708
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:31,572
This guy seems fishy.

709
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:35,117
I've got a hunch again.

710
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:43,751
I'm not sure if I should say this.

711
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,295
But the day before the incident,

712
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:49,632
Dongil was seriously chewed out
by Kang Minjae.

713
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:54,720
You can't even drive or clean up properly.

714
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:56,388
What can you even do?

715
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:58,098
Just what, you punk?

716
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:01,352
If you're going to drive like that,
just drive by yourself.

717
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:03,646
I don't want to be
a casualty of your driving.

718
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:05,856
Understand, you idiot?

719
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,901
-Answer me properly.
-Yes.

720
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:11,153
Louder.

721
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:12,655
Yes, sir!

722
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:20,496
He's kind of a psycho,

723
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,665
especially toward his staff.

724
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:25,709
It got really bad after he became famous.

725
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,963
We even call him Dog Minjae
behind his back.

726
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:34,468
That bastard.

727
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:35,844
Are you talking about me?

728
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:39,557
No, I wasn't calling you a bastard.

729
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,893
Why would I call you a bastard?

730
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,311
You just called someone a bastard.

731
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,438
There's no one else in the car.
I'm the only one here.

732
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:48,566
It was just me talking to myself.

733
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:53,696
That Kang Minjae thinks
that just because he's a celebrity,

734
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:55,614
he can treat people however he wants?

735
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:57,283
That all counts as assault.

736
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:59,827
People like him deserve
to be treated the same way.

737
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:02,037
-Someone should grab him and--
-Detective Seo.

738
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:03,622
Yes?

739
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:07,084
Don't get worked up. Focus on the case.

740
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:10,629
And even if everything said
about Kang Minjae is true,

741
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,965
he is legally innocent,
although he may be morally wrong.

742
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:16,135
Captain, a person died.

743
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:17,303
And you say he's innocent?

744
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,556
If there's a connection between them,
it's our business.

745
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:23,100
If not, it's beyond our duty.

746
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:26,812
And Mr. Jang.
Why lie when it's so obvious?

747
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:28,188
He's the CEO.

748
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,524
He probably didn't want rumors
to spread about his actor.

749
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,651
It's a natural reaction.

750
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:36,655
Captain, you know what?

751
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:38,115
What?

752
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:39,533
Never mind.

753
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:41,118
What is it?

754
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:43,370
It's just…

755
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:45,748
you seem a bit unlikable.

756
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:47,750
I get that a lot.

757
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:57,134
Mmm…

758
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:01,680
Hey, do you really have to eat it
with your hands like that?

759
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:04,099
Sushi is supposed to be eaten
with your hands.

760
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:07,519
Would you scoop up curry
with your hands too?

761
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:09,313
We're here, so we can eat it our way.

762
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:12,650
But why did the police
come to the company?

763
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:15,194
Don't worry about it.
It's just a routine investigation.

764
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:17,946
Routine, my foot.
I heard that detectives were here.

765
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,699
What if this crap
ends up splattering on me?

766
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:23,202
Why would any crap splatter on you?

767
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:24,662
I told you not to worry.

768
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:27,539
But shouldn't you be worrying, at least?

769
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:29,583
The police are showing up at the company.

770
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:32,336
And my name seems to be floating around
in the comments already!

771
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:34,880
If an article breaks linking me to this,

772
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:36,632
I'll be in some deep shit!

773
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:39,218
Stop with all the poop talk
while we're eating!

774
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:42,388
I'm telling you,
there's nothing to worry about.

775
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:46,642
You had nothing to do
with Lim Dongil's death, right?

776
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:48,227
Are you blaming me now?

777
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:50,646
No. Just since it came up…

778
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:53,023
Your favorite soy sauce shrimp.

779
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,525
-Open up.
-Not with your hands.

780
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:56,944
Oh, come on. Open up.

781
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:00,406
Good boy.

782
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:03,325
The soy sauce shrimp…

783
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:07,246
…has astaxanthin in it,
which is good for the skin.

784
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:11,959
Saucy, just like you!

785
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:13,794
And me too!

786
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,421
Just get this sorted out.

787
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,047
Okay.

788
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:19,883
Where did everyone go?

789
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:23,053
Hey! Did they go home first?

790
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:26,181
I don't know if they went home,
but they left together earlier.

791
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:27,349
Unbelievable.

792
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:29,101
You guys should also call it a day.

793
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:30,811
Yes, sir.

794
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:33,647
The day feels so long.

795
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,484
Bang!

796
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:38,819
Who are you?

797
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:41,321
- It's a monster! Attack!
- A monster!

798
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:42,614
Who are these kids?

799
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:44,700
Some parents came to the daycare center

800
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:46,785
- and asked us to watch them for a bit.
- Stop it!

801
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:53,709
Attack!

802
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:56,170
They said they'd be back soon.
There was nowhere else for them to go.

803
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:57,254
This is a police station!

804
00:45:57,337 --> 00:45:59,256
Stop that. Hey, stop it!

805
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,175
- Hey!
- Get her!

806
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:06,180
- Ugh! Let go of me! Stop!
- Hey, kids!

807
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:15,814
Hmm.

808
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:42,925
Seoul Busters
