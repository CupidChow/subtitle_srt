{\an8}EPISODE 14

3
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:53,845
Ha Minyong doesn't seem
to be the culprit either.

4
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:56,848
His employer confirmed
that he's hard-working

5
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,933
and well-liked by his clients.

6
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:02,020
I also looked into his theft charge,
and he was just an accessory.

7
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:06,066
Then should we do some more digging
into the housekeeper?

8
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:09,986
She's over 60 and worked
for them for over 10 years. Not her.

9
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:18,495
Captain?

10
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:23,792
- Captain?
- Yes?

11
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,503
What are you doing?
We're in the middle of a briefing.

12
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:27,587
I'm checking social media.

13
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:29,631
Social media?

14
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,383
These days,
there's little need for legwork.

15
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,969
You can find out most information
on social media.

16
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,888
Why don't you make an account?

17
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,223
It's really fun.

18
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,558
- We could follow each other...
- Hey.

19
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:42,811
Be quiet.

20
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,854
Whose social media are you looking at?

21
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,147
Ha Minyong's.

22
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,859
- Is that a drone?
- Yeah.

23
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,779
- What's the big deal?
- It seems to be his long-time hobby.

24
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:54,114
He even has a license.

25
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,366
Do we really need to care
about his hobbies?

26
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,243
Drones are popular these days.

27
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:02,163
He's been fined for violating
the Aviation Safety Act before.

28
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:05,208
Specifically for the unauthorized flight
of ultra-light vehicles.

29
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,378
Did you say Professor Kim's neighbor
recently called emergency services?

30
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,213
Yes, it was about wasps.

31
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,716
Did Ha Min-yong ever pay another visit
to Professor Kim's place?

32
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,095
He did. He went back to change a filter.

33
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:19,597
Our culprit is...

34
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:25,812
Ha Minyong.

35
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,616
Drink this.

36
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,952
- Here.
- Thank you.

37
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:48,585
- Do you keep anything valuable in there?
- Not at all.

38
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,629
<i>He probably noticed the vault
while repairing the HVAC system.</i>

39
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,631
<i>With just an old couple living there,</i>

40
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:57,051
<i>he would've thought
he just needed the passcode to rob it.</i>

41
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,471
But how could he have found out
the passcode?

42
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,056
My goodness.

43
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,516
There is a way.

44
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:08,438
You tie a camera to a pigeon and fly it.

45
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,356
Pretty close.

46
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,359
He would've used a drone.

47
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,285
Test the HVAC in each room

48
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,329
<i>Using the HVAC test as an excuse,</i>

49
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,459
<i>he must've made Professor Kim's wife
unlock the vault</i>

50
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:33,171
<i>and filmed it from the outside
using his drone.</i>

51
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:38,927
<i>It would've been easy for him to zoom in
and get the passcode.</i>

52
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,433
I hear wasps.

53
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:46,768
I'll replace the filters.

54
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:49,812
I noticed last time that they were
pretty old. It won't take long.

55
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:57,654
There will be dust everywhere
when I open this.

56
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,406
You can wait in the room
until I'm finished.

57
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,076
- Should I?
- Yes. [chuckles

58
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,509
Let's bring Ha Minyong in.

59
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,094
Yes, sir.

60
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,603
SEOUL BUSTERS

61
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:35,358
Why did you take
only one painting?

62
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,194
I was short on time,
and I only had two hands.

63
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,905
So I just took the first thing I saw.

64
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,156
What did you do with it?

65
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,367
I hadn't planned the crime.

66
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,411
It was a spur-of-the-moment thing.

67
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:49,580
Cut the nonsense and tell us
what you did with the painting!

68
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,416
I mean...

69
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,168
I'm a victim too.

70
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,462
What the hell are you talking about?

71
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:00,383
I asked the director where I used to work
to take care of the painting, but...

72
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,802
- Do they run a taekwondo studio?
- What are you talking about?

73
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,512
It can't be a hapkido
or kendo studio, can it?

74
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,723
That's not it.

75
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,725
Director Cheon runs a gallery.

76
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,643
You sold the painting
to this Director Cheon?

77
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,646
It was taken away from me.

78
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,897
What?

79
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,025
When he found out I stole it,
he took it away from me.

80
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,486
Please catch him.

81
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,655
I didn't realize this
when I was the thief,

82
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,907
but now that I've lost
what belongs to me...

83
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:28,786
Cheon Ilyong is
the director of Midam Gallery.

84
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,538
And he seems pretty fishy.

85
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:33,916
Four years ago, he was investigated
for smuggling out cultural assets.

86
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,210
Ha Minyong said
that Cheon Ilyong used his gallery

87
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,921
for the unlawful transfer of assets
and money laundering.

88
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:42,675
I guess his gallery is just a cover
for all his shady business.

89
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:46,471
But he's such a big shot.
I'm not sure if we can handle him.

90
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:51,309
Whether he's a big shot or not,
he's a criminal all the same.

91
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:54,103
Of course.
He's the perfect size for us to handle.

92
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,813
Like a custom suit.

93
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,482
Everything seems clear. Let's take action.

94
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,484
There you go again.

95
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:02,403
If we scare him into hiding,
we'll have to kiss the painting goodbye.

96
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,489
- Hey.
- I agree.

97
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,533
We'll have to find a way
to casually approach him.

98
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:10,870
What do you mean, casually approach him?
It's not like we're hitting on him.

99
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:12,747
- Hey, Junghwan.
- Yeah?

100
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,415
We just have to zoom over and bam,
right?

101
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,667
Zoom and bam?
That's easier said than done.

102
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,961
What if he catches wind
and the painting goes poof?

103
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,381
Come on. If we zoom and bam
and the painting goes poof,

104
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,049
we'll just swoosh and snatch it back.

105
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:25,510
Who's this advisor mentioned here?

106
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,428
They call him Mr. Jeon.

107
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:30,640
He often appraises antique art
for the gallery.

108
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,934
<i>Once a fence,</i>

109
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:35,603
<i>he's become a big shot
in the antique art market.</i>

110
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,066
<i>He has such a keen eye for art
that even scholars seek his advice.</i>

111
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,737
<i>People entrust him with artworks
too valuable to handle themselves.</i>

112
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:48,741
<i>In short, he's the kingpin
behind the scenes of the art market.</i>

113
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:02,630
A MAN IS ONLY ASS...

114
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:08,594
A MAN IS ONLY AS...

115
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:14,058
Will he agree to help us
with all his shady business going on?

116
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,227
We'll have to face him head-on
with a bang.

117
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,397
Not you too.

118
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:33,035
As I said, I can't help you.

119
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,789
We just need you to introduce us
to Director Cheon.

120
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,624
We heard you two are quite close.

121
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,713
You're asking the wrong person.
I haven't talked to him in ages.

122
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,883
Song, my guests are leaving.

123
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,176
Show them out.

124
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:55,892
Yes, sir.

125
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,852
Let me show you out.

126
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,814
Please help us out just this once.

127
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,233
You're our only hope.

128
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:08,613
Follow me, or I'll have to
use force.

129
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,533
Good grief.

130
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:34,263
Detective Seo, I think we should leave.

131
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,515
But Captain...

132
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,100
"Detective Seo"?

133
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,477
Is your last name Seo?

134
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,105
- Me?
- I did think you looked familiar.

135
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,234
May I ask what your father's name is?

136
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,527
Why do you ask?

137
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,653
Just answer me.

138
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,365
It's Jangsoo.

139
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:57,578
Seo Jangsoo.

140
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,872
I knew you looked familiar!

141
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,041
So you're Seo Jangsoo's daughter.

142
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,418
Jangsoo used to brag so much

143
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:07,505
about his daughter becoming a cop.

144
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,340
- Song!
- Yes, sir?

145
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,384
- Bring us some tea.
- Yes, sir.

146
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:19,600
I owe your father a lot.

147
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,938
How's he doing? Is he well?

148
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,816
How would I know?

149
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,570
He's in prison.

150
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,489
How would I know whether he's well or not?

151
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:39,161
I know you're busy,
but try to visit him once in a while.

152
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,873
All he ever talked about was his daughter.

153
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:45,001
He'd go on about
how smart and pretty you were.

154
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,295
He showed me pictures of you all the time.

155
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,797
It's true that he committed a crime,

156
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,424
but he had good reason
for everything he did

157
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,467
and did what was right.

158
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:56,554
He's still a thief.
Who cares about any of that?

159
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,390
You have a point.

160
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:05,021
Still, he helped recover many
cultural assets from being sold abroad,

161
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:06,856
and he didn't do it for money.

162
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,234
He clearly made a mistake,

163
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,279
but he's paying for what he's done.

164
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:16,824
I think it's time for you to forgive him.

165
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:24,832
He's your family, after all.

166
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,459
He's your father.

167
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,050
If we don't find this painting,

168
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,427
no one knows where it'll end up.

169
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:38,888
Please help us.

170
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,229
Mr. Jeon.

171
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:51,734
Your guests from Taiwan
are waiting in the annex.

172
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,865
We'll wait outside for your answer.

173
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,247
They say
birds of a feather flock together.

174
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,332
What?

175
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,128
I'm talking about my dad.

176
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,880
His acquaintance

177
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:15,966
turns out to be a crook
who's been in and out of prison.

178
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,636
Don't be so hard on your father.

179
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:22,473
You can say that
because you don't know what he's like.

180
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:27,812
If your father really is
the Seo Jangsoo I know,

181
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,063
I do know a little about him.

182
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:33,192
<i>He's a famous thief who caused
a stir nationwide in the early 2000s.</i>

183
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:37,238
<i>His legendary skills meant he could unlock
any door with a small screwdriver.</i>

184
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:41,575
He only went after the top 1% of society.

185
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,911
He also helped recover
many stolen cultural assets

186
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:47,373
and donated most of his earnings
to a children's cancer center.

187
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,208
That's how he got the nickname

188
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:52,002
"Romantic Master Thief"
after he got caught. Correct?

189
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,879
You seem to know more about him than I do.

190
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,048
At the Police University,

191
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,968
we were tested on him every year.

192
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,225
Please don't tell our team...

193
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:07,601
I won't tell anyone.

194
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,813
- Let's wait in the car.
- Okay.

195
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,490
- What do you mean?
- Sorry?

196
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,743
You just said, "Really?"

197
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:24,994
No, I didn't.

198
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,708
Hm, I see.

199
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,668
Come to think of it,
it's well past dinnertime.

200
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,629
There are some instant noodles
in the trunk.

201
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:36,714
Instant noodles?

202
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:40,301
But we can't boil water here.

203
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:41,927
- Really?
- Hey...

204
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,513
I think we can.

205
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,607
Oh, It turned on.

206
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,111
Wow, it really works.
It's amazing.

207
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:00,905
Of course it does.

208
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:02,198
How did you know about this?

209
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,741
It says so in the manual.

210
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,286
Who actually reads the manual?

211
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,872
- Who doesn't?
- Ah...

212
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,793
I've never read any manuals.

213
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,754
You never read the manual
after buying something?

214
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,964
I see.

215
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,600
That hits the spot.

216
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,435
It's so good.

217
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,064
Hold on. Use this.

218
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,941
- For what?
- You have a runny nose.

219
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,234
Ah.

220
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,075
Detective Seo. By any chance,

221
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:49,203
did you go to high school in Seodaemun?

222
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,790
I did. Why?

223
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,501
I knew it. So that's what happened.

224
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,171
Mr. Seo Jangsoo was arrested

225
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,298
in front of a girls' high school
in Seodaemun.

226
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:08,556
<i>If I remember correctly,</i>

227
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,058
<i>it was graduation day.</i>

228
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,810
"CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR GRADUATION"

229
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,149
"SEJEONG GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL"

230
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:22,236
- Where do you think you're going?
- Get him.

231
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,573
- Got him!
- Come here.

232
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:29,076
- You put up a good fight.
- Seo Jangsoo, you're done for.

233
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,202
Hold still!

234
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,181
<i>I'd been curious</i>

235
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:55,519
why that elusive Seo Jangsoo
got caught there on that day,

236
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,646
of all places and times.

237
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:09,700
Now I know why
he had to be there then.

238
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,053
Captain.

239
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,182
Perhaps...

240
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,602
I knew it all along...

241
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:41,565
but I was too proud to admit it.

242
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,612
You told me the other day

243
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,741
to keep a distance from cases

244
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:54,203
because people often fail to see things
that are too close.

245
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:00,334
But I have trouble keeping a distance
from those close to me.

246
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,086
I'm such a fool.

247
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:09,009
Just follow your heart

248
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,553
so that you won't have any regrets later.

249
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,766
There's only so much time

250
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:18,519
to forgive someone or ask for forgiveness.

251
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:24,233
Some things can only be seen up close.

252
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,236
Sometimes,

253
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,906
I wish I could see things
up close like you.

254
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:39,206
I always knew you were a good talker,

255
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:46,046
but I didn't know
you were also good at making people talk.

256
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,631
Really?

257
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,426
That wasn't me, I swear.

258
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,019
You're still here.

259
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:03,272
Mr. Jeon told me to give this to you
if you were still here.

260
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:07,317
Okey-dokey

261
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,450
Now we owe your father one.

262
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,369
Thanks.

263
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:29,339
It so happens that a Korean-Japanese
person wants to purchase an artwork.

264
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,341
We're going to go undercover as them.

265
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:35,054
Detectives Jung and Jang,
I need you to back us up from the outside.

266
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:38,682
Detectives Seo, Moo, and I are going
undercover to meet with Director Cheon.

267
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,976
Detective Seo and I are going to be
the Korean broker couple.

268
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,188
And Detective Moo is going to be
the Korean-Japanese chairman.

269
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:48,901
Captain, we're quite used to
undercover operations,

270
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,235
but will you be okay?

271
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:54,281
Back in school,
I was a member of the Hamlet Society.

272
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:58,535
I have a lot of acting experience,
and I specialize in method acting.

273
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,913
I'm pretty talented, so don't worry.

274
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:03,832
Captain, could you say a line from <i>Hamlet?</i>

275
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,501
I'll do the most famous one.

276
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,252
"To be, or not to be."

277
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:11,423
"That is the question."

278
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:20,015
I can do better
when I'm on stage and in costume.

279
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,809
He says he's good!

280
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:24,103
SONGWON POLICE STATION
HAS MOVED TO A TEMPORARY LOCATION

281
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,438
WISH-IT-WELL DAYCARE CENTER

282
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,113
My, that looks so real.

283
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:36,281
Where did you learn how to do this?

284
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,242
I've never done <i>Hamlet,</i>

285
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:40,536
but I was also in a drama club
back in school.

286
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,247
Will you stay still?

287
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,250
It's just that it tickles.

288
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,002
You're supposed to only speak Japanese,

289
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,671
so remain as quiet as you can.

290
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:55,300
Come on.
This isn't my first undercover operation.

291
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,677
I have so much...

292
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,680
There you go again.
You have to stay still.

293
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,557
What's the deal with you?

294
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,601
I'm ticklish.
And my ears are super sensitive.

295
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,895
Still, try to stay
as still as possible.

296
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:07,980
This could make or break us.

297
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:51,190
- Captain, you're sweating.
- Am I?

298
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,108
Didn't you say
you were in the Hamlet Society?

299
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,902
I've only done <i>Hamlet.</i>

300
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,945
Just act natural.

301
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,572
This is an investigation, not a play.

302
00:19:58,655 --> 00:19:59,740
Got it. An investigation.

303
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,120
Come on.

304
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,249
SONGWON POLICE STATION

305
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,210
Okay. They just went in.

306
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:14,880
Help them out
whenever they need to speak Japanese.

307
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,006
They have in-ears.

308
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,382
Understood.

309
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,508
Understood.

310
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,427
Great.

311
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,721
Anyway, my heart's beating so fast.

312
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:25,265
Don't worry. Didn't you see Captain
saying the line from <i>Hamlet?</i>

313
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,518
Right, you didn't.
It was some serious method acting.

314
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,771
He was Hamlet himself.

315
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:32,981
You know <i>Hamlet, right?</i>
<i>We're in.</i>

316
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,944
Here they come.

317
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:46,286
Thank you for coming
all the way here.

318
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,121
Nice to meet you, Ham...

319
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:52,125
- I mean...
- Captain.

320
00:20:57,214 --> 00:21:00,425
Nice to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

321
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,265
Are you a news anchor or something?
You speak so clearly.

322
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:09,685
Oh, Director Cheon!

323
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:14,523
Hello.

324
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:18,485
I'm his wife.

325
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:22,781
Hold on. Why are you so stylish?

326
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,701
No wonder you're in the art scene.

327
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,077
I'm flattered.

328
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,162
I'm amazed by your beauty myself.

329
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,833
- Please have a seat.
- Over there? Okay.

330
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,335
Have a seat. Make yourself comfortable.

331
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:39,214
- I'll take a seat.
- Please.

332
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:54,187
OUR GALLERY IS TEMPORARILY CLOSED

333
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,736
Let me introduce...

334
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,779
This is Chairman Kobayashi.

335
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:06,158
I'm sure you're familiar with him.
He's a huge spender.

336
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:10,620
Ah, is that right?
It's a pleasure to meet you.

337
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:16,418
I look forward to doing business with you,
Chairman Kobayashi.

338
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,087
<i>Why is his Japanese so good?</i>

339
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,381
Please say something.

340
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,760
Ah...

341
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,555
I'm also...

342
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:30,891
pleased...

343
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,197
...happy to meet you.

344
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,283
Nice to meet you.

345
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,452
He seems
to have trouble speaking.

346
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:53,830
He's had a stroke,

347
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:56,124
- Oh dear.
- So he struggles with speaking.

348
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,585
- I see.
- Yes.

349
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:01,755
By the way, is it hot?
You're sweating.

350
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:05,092
He has hyperhidrosis.

351
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:08,637
- He naturally feels hotter than others.
- Goodness.

352
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,097
A stroke.

353
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:11,723
Hyperhidrosis.

354
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,350
Hyperhidrosis. I see.

355
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:16,311
Anyway, I heard
you're looking for an artwork.

356
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,604
That's right.

357
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:21,233
I heard <i>Chungwoonsansudo is here.</i>

358
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:22,984
May we have a look at that first?

359
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,945
Who told you that?

360
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,488
Mr. Jeon did.

361
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,201
That old man
can never keep his mouth shut.

362
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:34,746
I'm only showing it to you because
your identities have been confirmed.

363
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,374
Bring us <i>Chungwoonsansudo.</i>

364
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:48,218
How's the Japanese
antique art market these days?

365
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:50,303
Why does he have so many questions?

366
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:51,930
It's thriving!

367
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:53,598
It's thriving.

368
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:59,020
If you have
any valuable artwork...

369
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:02,274
...<i>please let me know.</i>

370
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:07,195
Please let...

371
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:19,082
...me know.

372
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,334
Ah...

373
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,044
- Have some tea.
- Okay.

374
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,505
He just answered in Korean.
He said, "Okay."

375
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:28,133
I can't do this anymore!

376
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,594
Just say something.

377
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,597
Huh?

378
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:42,397
- Please have some tea.
- Please help yourself.

379
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:46,902
It tastes lovely.

380
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,570
It's lovely. Lovely...

381
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,363
Do you like it?
That's a relief.

382
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,117
Bring it here.

383
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,660
- Careful.
- Honey.

384
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:57,787
Honey. Honey!

385
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,166
Here it is.

386
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:04,669
This is the last masterpiece
by Cheongpung Kim Sangjik,

387
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,506
<i>Chungwoonsansudo.</i>

388
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:13,094
- This is it, right?
- I think so.

389
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:16,681
I told you so. Based on trust...

390
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:19,476
- Be quiet while we take a closer look.
- Sorry?

391
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,062
- Let's wrap things up, Detective Seo.
- Yes, sir.

392
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:24,064
"Detective Seo"? What's going on here?

393
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,941
Is your name Detective, ma'am?

394
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,109
You're done too, Detective Moo.

395
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,195
"Detective Moo"? What do you mean?

396
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,822
Are those your nicknames?

397
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:35,075
It's not my nickname.
I'm a real detective.

398
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,036
You're a detective?

399
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:41,164
Listen up. You've been caught in the act.
You're all under arrest!

400
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,585
Don't follow me. Block them.

401
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,796
- Take care of them, Detective Moo.
- Get rid of them!

402
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:48,880
Okay.

403
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:55,095
Which one of you guys
wants a beating from Grandpa?

404
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:56,555
What is he saying?

405
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,348
- Four.
- What?

406
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:01,017
I mean four punches, you moron.

407
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:05,730
What is it?

408
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:13,446
Here we go.

409
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:16,199
Let's go, Captain.

410
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,041
MIDAM GALLERY

411
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,294
Where are my car keys?

412
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:28,378
Where did they go?

413
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:34,718
Hi, it's me.
Bring the car around right now.

414
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:37,012
Just do as I say!

415
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,180
They're already here?

416
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,394
That was fast. Let's go.

417
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,105
I have to wait for my colleagues.

418
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:49,399
Who are you?

419
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:51,735
We're from the Songwon Police
Violent Crimes Team, sir.

420
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:52,819
What?

421
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,572
There must be
a misunderstanding.

422
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:57,991
I'm not Korean. I'm Japanese.

423
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:01,286
You're under arrest.
You have the right to an attorney,

424
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:03,246
and you have the right to remain silent.

425
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,040
- I'm not Korean.
- You're under arrest.

426
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:08,543
- I'm Japanese. No. I'm Japanese.
- Please stop.

427
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,086
That's enough, sir.

428
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,589
I'm Japanese!

429
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,343
Let's just go. I am Korean.
Fine.

430
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,261
Nice.

431
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:08,395
Great job, Yubin.

432
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:12,649
I'll make sure you get a promotion,
so wait just a little longer.

433
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:18,113
After the promotion, you can transfer
to headquarters with glory.

434
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,656
I'm good.

435
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:22,158
Just keep up your end of the deal

436
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:24,035
and reward my team.

437
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,246
They worked so hard for this case.

438
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:30,125
Hey, for them to get a promotion,
you need to be promoted first.

439
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:33,461
I'll send you a list of officers
who deserve a reward.

440
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,879
<i>You little brat.</i>

441
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:37,549
<i>Fine, suit yourself then.</i>

442
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:48,560
Songwon Police Violent Crimes Team 2
Award Ceremony

443
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:50,937
Lieutenant Moo Joongryeok!

444
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,105
Good work.

445
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,194
Sergeant Jung Junghwan!

446
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:00,196
Good work.

447
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:07,704
Corporal Seo Minseo!

448
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,082
Good work.

449
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:15,962
Keep it down.

450
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:23,762
Officer Jang Tansik!

451
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,346
Are you okay, sir?

452
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,682
- Go, Violent Crimes Team 2!
- Go, Violent Crimes Team 2!

453
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:29,601
Good work, everyone.

454
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:30,685
Thank you, sir!

455
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,466
Detective Seo.

456
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:02,926
Captain.

457
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:04,344
Thank you.

458
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,723
I guess you've identified the buyer.

459
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,600
Yes.

460
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:14,813
I found CCTV footage of the kid
selling the stolen transit card.

461
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,606
Ah.

462
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:19,651
I tracked the buyer's movements
based on his appearance,

463
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:22,362
and it turns out that
he always gets on and off at this station.

464
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,365
I checked his transit history,

465
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:27,951
and he typically gets on the subway
around this time of day.

466
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:31,120
Also, I have a feeling he lives nearby.

467
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:34,332
Now that I've been coming here every day,
I think I can pick him out

468
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:37,126
among the people who enter around
the time marked on his transit card.

469
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,964
He should be here soon.

470
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,341
I think he's here.

471
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:44,968
I'll be right back.

472
00:30:58,439 --> 00:30:59,524
Thank you.

473
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:09,075
What did you give to him?

474
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:12,871
He didn't do anything wrong,
so I gave him a new transit card.

475
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,163
I see.

476
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:18,126
- Here. Let's get going now.
- Okay.

477
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:21,629
You got the card back,
but you don't seem so happy.

478
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,465
The picture of his daughter
has been taken off the card.

479
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,051
It was the reason he wanted the card back.

480
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,177
What should we do?

481
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,179
Still, you did your best.

482
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:32,390
What's important is
that you kept your promise.

483
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,809
You're right. Thank you.

484
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,770
TRANSIT CARD

485
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:39,564
I'm sorry, sir.

486
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:42,734
It's okay.
There's nothing to be done.

487
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:47,488
I should've taken better care
of the last picture I had of my daughter.

488
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,532
It's my fault.

489
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,455
By any chance, is she...

490
00:31:57,498 --> 00:32:00,668
No, she's alive and well.

491
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,755
She even has kids and everything.

492
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:06,257
Then why?

493
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,846
I made a lot of mistakes when I was young.

494
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:13,806
I was a bad dad

495
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,268
and a bad husband.

496
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:22,690
So they don't want anything
to do with me anymore.

497
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,526
I haven't heard from them in ages.

498
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,657
And I feel too ashamed
to ask for their forgiveness.

499
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,912
Anyway, thank you, Detective.

500
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:37,914
Thank you so much.

501
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,875
Don't mention it.
I was just doing my job.

502
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:45,046
I'll get going now.

503
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:49,717
You must be busy.
I'm sorry for all the trouble.

504
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,803
Not at all.

505
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:58,267
Listen, sir.

506
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,353
Yes?

507
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:05,233
I think you should reach out
to your daughter.

508
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:09,570
She might be waiting for you...

509
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:15,076
to ask for forgiveness.

510
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:50,486

00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:32,315
There's only so much time

531
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:35,026
to forgive someone or ask for forgiveness.

532
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:56,130
RELATIONSHIP: DAUGHTER

533
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:06,182
<i>Don't resent him too much.</i>

534
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:08,809
<i>He's still our dad.</i>

535
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,563
<i>I think it's time for you
to forgive him.</i>

536
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:13,898
<i>He's your family, after all.</i>

537
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:15,900
<i>He's your father.</i>

538
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:20,780
<i>Now we owe your father one.</i>

539
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:31,874
Forgiveness and comfort
over resentment and blame

540
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,005
It's cold today.

541
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,257
You didn't have to come.

542
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:28,764
I just wanted to.

543
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:35,396
I see.

544
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:38,190
I'm glad you're here.

545
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:03,799
Happy birthday, Dad.

546
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:25,071
Thanks.

547
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,073
Thanks, Dad.

548
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:51,764
SEOUL BUSTERS

549
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:36,475
<i>- Next time on Seoul Busters.
- We are...</i>

550
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:37,726
They're unstoppable

551
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:40,104
- We are...
- The path!

552
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:41,272
They're evil

553
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:43,357
<i>They're an MZ gang.</i>

554
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,359
<i>They make money through online gambling,</i>

555
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,319
<i>crypto investment scams,
and illegal loans.</i>

556
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:48,946
To punish evil

557
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:51,615
<i>Mastar at the top is basically
the boss of the MZ Union,</i>

558
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,951
<i>but we know nothing
about his identity yet.</i>

559
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:57,621
<i>Once we locate their office,
let's round them up all at once.</i>

560
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:01,292
They enter the den of vice!

561
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:03,669
- Let's start a gang.
- Start a what?

562
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:05,588
<i>From now on,
we're the Dongbang Group.</i>

563
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:08,007
<i>Let's show them what we're made of!</i>

564
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:09,133
<i>Fine, let's go!</i>

565
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:10,718
The Violent Crimes Team returns stronger!

566
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:12,678
The Dongbang Group returns
stronger than ever!

567
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:13,804
<i>Who are we?</i>

568
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:16,098
<i>- The undefeated...
- Dongbang!</i>

569
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,892
<i>Warm up, everyone.</i>

570
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,435
<i>Let's show them what we've got.</i>

571
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:21,604
To be continued...
