{\an8}EPISODE 6

3
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,887
Hey, you.

4
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,056
Where do you think you're going?

5
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:57,974
Who are you guys?

6
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,310
You guys obviously don't work here.

7
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:01,770
Are you the ones with a tip?

8
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:04,481
We don't know the details.

9
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,109
We were just asked to teach you a lesson,

10
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:10,111
so you just get ready to learn.

11
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,822
I'm so scared.
You're going to teach me a lesson?

12
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,617
Yeah.
You should've lived a better life.

13
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,494
And you should've been nicer to others--

14
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:20,330
Nam Junghyun!
I know you're here, you bastard!

15
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,376
Look, let's not drag this out.

16
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,339
Let's see here. If I land two blows each…

17
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,216
One, two, three, four…

18
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,384
Man, that's going to take forever.

19
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,136
Two each is too many, isn't it?

20
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,056
I'll just do one blow each.
Be grateful for what you get.

21
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:40,767
That should be plenty.

22
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,103
What are you babbling about?
Are you done talking now?

23
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:44,604
Here I go.

24
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,738
Bring it on. Bring it on.

25
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,542
Damn it.

26
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,767
Uh…

27
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,270
Wait! You already punched me.

28
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,438
- Are you sure?
- Yes. I can't breathe.

29
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,149
Blame your ski mask.

30
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,525
Here's another blow.

31
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:34,904
Hey, answer me honestly.

32
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,073
- Where's Nam Junghyun?
- He's over there.

33
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:39,993
- Hold this for me.
- Okay.

34
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,246
Jeez.

35
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,168
There you are.

36
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,253
Come here, you bastard.

37
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,342
Come here.

38
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,220
Shit! That hurts!

39
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:00,805
Watch your language!

40
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,223
It hurts so damn much!

41
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,267
It really hurts.

42
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,103
Scumbags like you
who pick on people weaker than you

43
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,354
need a good beating.

44
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,065
I'm going to smack some sense
into you today, so be prepared.

45
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,484
Let go of me first…

46
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,487
- Hold on. Hey, answer my phone.
- Sorry?

47
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:17,989
- My phone's ringing!
- Yes, sir.

48
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:22,243
-Hold, please.
-Who is it?

49
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,328
It's Taesung.

50
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,663
Hello? Yeah. What?

51
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,457
I'm busy right now. Why?

52
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,000
Hey, hold this guy for me.

53
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,085
- Me?
- I said hold him!

54
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,630
So what's the matter?

55
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,632
- What the hell are you doing?
- Well…

56
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,592
Let go!
What's the deal with you?

57
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:39,010
Hold him tight.

58
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,345
- No, don't.
- Tight?

59
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,389
No, I wasn't talking to you.

60
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,515
Right now? Okay, I'll be right there.

61
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,975
- Let's go.
- Are we leaving?

62
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,561
- Yes. Hey, I'm on my way.
- Don't resist.

Why are we here?

66
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,450
Hey. Wait in the car for a minute.

67
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,534
Okay.

68
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,287
Don't touch anything or do anything.

69
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,372
Understood.

70
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,168
Welcome.

71
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:14,003
Hello.

72
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:17,715
I'm looking for this.

73
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:21,928
Those are out of production.
You won't find them anywhere.

74
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,097
Is there any way I could find one?

75
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,683
I promised my daughter
I'd get it for her birthday.

76
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,101
There's no way.

77
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,978
Please, sir, help me out.

78
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:33,398
There's nothing I can do even if you beg.

79
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,150
Could you at least check in your storage?

80
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,361
I know my inventory, and we're out.

81
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,405
How can I sell them when I don't have any?

82

"T-REX EXTINCT"

83
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,450

SEOUL BUSTERS

85
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:59,340
<i>I'm not sure
if this has anything to do with the case,</i>

86
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,467
but it's been bothering me.

87
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,553
What is it? Spit it out.

88
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:06,973
Coach Yoon asked me to lend him
some money right before the fire.

89
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,851
-Money?
-Around 50 million won.

90
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:13,104
It seems like he invested in crypto

91
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:15,273
and ended up taking out loans.

92
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,025
You mean things like Bitcoin?

93
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:20,278
You know how he always talks about
life being about one shot?

94
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:21,863
He tried to get me involved too.

95
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,867
You could look for evidence
of where he invested.

96
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,954
One shot, my foot.

97
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,878
SHIT WELL DAYCARE CENTER

98
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:40,173
SONGWON POLICE STATION
HAS MOVED TO A TEMPORARY LOCATION

99
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:42,592
Mmm.

100
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,969
Right before the fire,

101
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,263
he paid three months' worth
of overdue insurance at once

102
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,639
to stop it from being canceled.

103
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,309
Was he really after the insurance money?

104
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,061
Mm. That doesn't add up.

105
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:54,979
Even if he received 300 million won,

106
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,565
after all the expenses,
he'd end up with 100 million won.

107
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,317
Burning down his restaurant for that?

108
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,861
You're right. It wouldn't be worth it.

109
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,409
Watch your step.

110
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,829
Sorry about that. Enjoy, everyone.

111
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,665
How can you eat that? You'll get sick.

112
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,710
You eat food off the floor,
and you hardly wash up.

113
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,255
All the food
you leave uneaten in your life

114
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,508
catches up with you after you die.

115
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,802
Also, it's okay if you pick it up
within five seconds.

116
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:29,055
- I've heard of the five-second rule too.
- Right?

117
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:31,808
Supposedly,
bacteria can't transfer that fast.

118
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,018
Is that some kind of rule
for beggars? Huh?

119
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,354
Do we really need to worry
about how quickly we pick up food?

120
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:40,733
Bacteria move around 70 times slower
than mollusks like snails,

121
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,027
- so there's some science to it.
- Mm.

122
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:46,072
Still, food that's fallen
on the floor is dirty.

123
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,990
Nothing's dirtier than our hands.

124
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:49,617
So dirty.

125
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,081
How was Mr. Yoon's business doing?

126
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:58,000
It was worse than we initially thought.

127
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:01,879
The YouTube video had gotten him
some new customers,

128
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,840
but he'd been struggling the whole time.

129
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,342
I see. Why isn't this mixed yet?

130
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,886
-Do you need help?
-No, I'm fine.

131
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,222
Gosh, this is…

132
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,107
How's Hyojoo doing?
Is she okay?

133
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,025
She's gotten a lot better.

134
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:27,405
She still can't remember
anything about the fire though.

135
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,575
Don't worry. Everything will be okay.

136
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:32,577
I hope so.

137
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:37,457
Being with you brings back memories.

138
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,209
Boxing was tough,

139
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:44,881
but I miss how carefree we were back then.

140
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,176
-Don't you agree?
-I don't even remember those days.

141
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,054
Take this.

142
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,265
And say hi to Hyojoo for me.

143
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:18,873
<i>Use this for the hospital bill.</i>

144
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:36,974
Come in.

145
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,699
I never noticed that before.

146
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:02,959
Here you go.

147
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,379
What's this?

148
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:11,259
It seems like Minsoo was into crypto.

149
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:12,760
Crypto?

150
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,638
I don't know much about that field,

151
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,641
but I put together everything I found out.

152
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,019
It seems like he made a risky investment.

153
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,275
I thought it might help.

154
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,822
Or maybe not.

155
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:33,906
I'll be off.

156
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:35,616
Detective Moo.

157
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,413
Thank you.

158
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:42,957
You're welcome.

159
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,509
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

160
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,885
So this was your urgent business?

161
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,015
Here's the information about Gold Coin.

162
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:00,683
Thank you.

163
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,769
They claim
their currency's value is backed by gold.

164
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:06,480
But it seems more like
an elaborate Ponzi scheme to me.

165
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,693
Isn't this enough evidence to take action?

166
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,028
What are you waiting for?

167
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,947
They haven't given up all hope yet.

168
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,742
I mean the investors.

169
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:21,037
The upcoming IPO is expected to increase
the cryptocurrency's value by 20 times.

170
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,039
The investors are staking
everything on it.

171
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,083
If we act rashly,

172
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,501
it could backfire on us.

173
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,895
<i>You know
it's Doona's birthday tomorrow, right?</i>

174
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,438
<i>Don't forget to get her a present.</i>

175
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,732
<i>The kids are looking forward
to you keeping your promise.</i>

176
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,697
For crying out loud.

177
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:11,921
Hello.

178
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,506
- Hello.
- Hello.

179
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:16,550
- Dahye, Mommy's here.
- Hi, sweetie.

180
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,347
There's a crazy man on the slide.

181
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,973
A crazy man!

182
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,271
Donggoo!

183
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,153
-Where's your mom?
-She's busy today.

184
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,114
What are you doing here?

185
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,199
I've been waiting for you.

186
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,283
Me?

187
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,203
Is the T-Rex still with you?

188
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,622
Do you mean this?

189
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,040
Yes, that…

190
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,333
Oh!

191
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:53,671
Can you please give me that?

192
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,965
I really need it.

193
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,092
I'll buy you another toy instead.

194
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:59,301
No way.

195
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,012
Don't be so stubborn, Donggoo.

196
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:05,516
- I'm begging you.
- Mm…

197
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:06,600
I don't want to.

198
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,230
Hey, I found it first,
but you snatched it away.

199
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,691
-Are you angry with me?
-What?

200
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,694
Of course not.

201
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,362
I'm not angry with you at all.

202
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:21,157
I'm just asking you for a favor.

203
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,825
Mm…

204
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,910
- I don't want to.
- Hey, Donggoo!

205
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,664
Hmm?

206
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,416
You're obviously angry with me.

207
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:31,792
I was just saying your name.

208
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,627
Please help me out just once.

209
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,588
I'll be really good to you.

210
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,506
So please, just this once.

211
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,050
Please give it a second thought.

212
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:43,429
Should I go down on my knees?
Will that change your mind?

213
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,473
Can you mimic a T-Rex?

214
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:46,557
Mimic a T-Rex?

215
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,893
If you do a good job, I'll reconsider.

216
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:49,977
Uh…

217
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,064
Don't you think that's too much?

218
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,357
I'm a grown-up.

219
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,359
Forget it then.

220
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,571
No, wait! Give me just a second.

221
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,618
I'll do it. I'll give it a try, okay?

222
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,334
What are you doing?

223
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,377
That was terrible. Forget it.

224
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,463
Wait. Just a second.

225
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:20,049
Let me try again.
I'll give it another try.

226
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,218
One more time.

227
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:25,805
What is he doing?

228
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,140
<i>Doona, give me courage.</i>

229
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:31,227
<i>I'll get you your birthday present
no matter what.</i>

230
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,396
I'm counting on you, Daddy.

231
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,474
Is he a real T-Rex?

232
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,029
He's crazy!

233
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:52,808
Donggoo.

234
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,185
Can I have that T-Rex now?

235
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,897
Do me a favor first.

236
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,566
-What favor?
-Follow me.

237
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:03,193
What?

238
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:13,245
BETTER TOMORROW TARGET SHOOTING

239
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,706
GOD OF MARKSMANSHIP

240
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:21,211
You have to hit all ten targets
to win the Sting Man figurine.

241
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,713
1ST PRIZE
STING MAN

242
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,298
No one's won it yet.

243
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,342
Can you win that for me?

244
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,261
Donggoo.

245
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,555
I think these rifles aren't even zeroed.

246
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,432
Keep your promise.

247
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:37,269
Sir, do you have a handgun?

248
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,612
Here you go.

249
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,572
Thank you. I'll borrow it for a second.

250
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,850
No way.

251
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,733
Give me Sting Man.

252
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:25,943
Of course.

253
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:27,820
Here you go.

254
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:32,032
Give me the T-Rex now, Donggoo.

255
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,040
You're amazing.

256
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,291
Donggoo.

257
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,377
Thanks.

258
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,925
Thank you.

259
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,846
Thanks, Donggoo.

260
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:58,183
SONGWON POLICE STATION
HAS MOVED TO A TEMPORARY LOCATION

261
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,936
Even if Mr. Yoon invested in crypto,

262
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,354
he's only suffered losses.

263
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:05,149
Is this really related to the case?

264
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:06,400
And the victim is his daughter.

265
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,034
Where have you been?

266
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,245
I had a bad headache.

267
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,205
But I'm fine now.

268
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,498
That's a relief.

269
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,208
Take a seat.

270
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,465
-I solved it.
-What?

271
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,884
I think I know who the culprit is.

272
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:34,011
-Who is it?
-I think the culprit is…

273
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:36,722
The culprit is…

274
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:38,557
The culprit is…

275
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,476
Come on.

276
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:44,354
The culprit is Mr. Yoon's wife.

277
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:50,611
-That's so random.
-It's not at all.

278
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,614
She's been severely depressed.

279
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,699
So when she found out
about their financial loss,

280
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,493
she set the restaurant on fire.

281
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,412
Depression can lead to impulsive behavior.

282
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,081
Why would she go that far?

283
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,540
Because she was severely depressed.

284
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,167
Her daughter was inside the restaurant.

285
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,960
She was severely depressed.

286
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,254
She's unwell, and she would've had
to climb down the wall!

287
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,298
She was severely…

288
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:16,887
…depressed.

289
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,181
I'm getting depressed.

290
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:20,849
I'm sorry, sir.

291
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,436
Wait, Tansik.

292
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,189
Sit in that chair and think some more.

293
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,273
Okay.

294
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,236
You can go back to your seat.

295
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,114
Yes, sir.

296
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,959
What are you doing, Captain?

297
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:49,086
I'm trying to think.

298
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,380
It's a thinking chair, after all.

299
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,720
Mm…

300
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,527
What are you doing here?

301
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:16,238
-Thank you.
-Sure.

302
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,701
Nice view of the sunset, isn't it?

303
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,287
Oof.

304
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,039
If this weren't a daycare,
it'd be a great scenic viewpoint.

305
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,127
I found some footage of the restaurant
at the time of the fire.

306
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,045
It matches Jiwoong's statement.

307
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,964
The resolution isn't great,

308
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:36,466
but I put a copy on your desk
for your review.

309
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,052
-Good work.
-Thank you.

310
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,937
Do you invest in crypto too?

311
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,564
No, it's not my thing.

312
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,107
Hmm.

313
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,319
All my friends were into it for a bit.

314
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:59,698
You know how quickly news spreads
about who made how much, right?

315
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,533
But no one ever talks about losing money.

316
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,452
What about you? Do you invest in crypto?

317
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,954
I used to think
crypto could turn my life around,

318
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:10,792
but I couldn't scrape together
any money to invest.

319
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:11,919
Hmm.

320
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,795
What was that crypto called?

321
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,756
Everyone was saying it'd shoot up tenfold.

322
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,051
But who cares?
I don't have two nickels to rub together.

323
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:47,454
This coffee's way too bitter.

324
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:26,702
I used to think
crypto could turn my life around.

325
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,620
Everyone was saying it'd shoot up tenfold.

326
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,957
But who cares?
I don't have two nickels to rub together.

327
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,334
<i>They haven't given up all hope yet.</i>

328
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:35,961
<i>I mean the investors.</i>

329
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,300
What if 100 million won
isn't just 100 million?

330
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,029
Are you here alone?

331
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:07,909
Yes.

332
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:10,996
Can we talk for a minute?

333
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,080
Sorry?

334
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:14,666
About what?

335
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:25,802
How's boxing going?

336
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:26,887
Is it fun?

337
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:30,390
I know nothing about boxing.

338
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:33,727
Uh, I quite like it.

339
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,563
It takes my mind off things.

340
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:37,731
Mm.

341
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:38,815
I see.

342
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,403
You were on your way to the gym
when you saw the fire, right?

343
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,322
What?

344
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,283
Uh, yes.

345
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:53,914
<i>You made a report right away,</i>

346
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:56,249
<i>and it was at 4:27 a.m., correct?</i>

347
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,001
There's a fire.

348
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,880
I think so.

349
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,097
Hyojoo! Hyojoo!

350
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,308
Stay with me, Hyojoo.

351
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:16,645
- Hyojoo!
- Then you carried Hyojoo out.

352
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:23,485
You went into the restaurant
and carried Hyojoo out

353
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,362
within two minutes of seeing the fire.

354
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:31,034
How did you know
Hyojoo was lying unconscious inside?

355
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,706
-What?
-The restaurant was filled with smoke,

356
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,085
and no one would've known
Hyojoo was there.

357
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,421
And you couldn't have seen her

358
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,423
lying in the kitchen from the outside.

359
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,427
You better tell the truth now.

360
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:54,266
Why did you set the restaurant on fire?

361
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:21,668
What did he say?

362
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:24,254
He's remaining silent.

363
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,924
May I try talking to him, sir?

364
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:30,844
I tend to get along with millennials.

365
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:33,263
-He's Gen Z.
-What?

366
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:35,348
He's Gen Z, not a millennial.

367
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,517
Since when did that become a thing?

368
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:38,852
It's been a while.

369
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:40,729
It means "Generation Z."

370
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,105
Detective Seo, you go in.

371
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:44,608
Me?

372
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,249
Drink some.

373
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:13,720
Just be honest.

374
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:15,472
That's all there is to it.

375
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:20,810
Hmm.

376
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:31,655
I know you were just trying
to help Mr. Yoon

377
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:34,783
because you felt indebted to him.

378
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:37,494
Am I right?

379
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:43,333
I heard Mr. Yoon
has been helping you out a lot.

380
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,087
If you really want to help him,

381
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:51,258
you should tell the truth.

382
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:16,449
Things got pretty out of hand,
didn't they?

383
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:21,871
How did you first meet Mr. Yoon?

384
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,835
I met him at the gym.

385
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:30,922
<i>He used to coach my coach.</i>

386
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,383
Focus! Focus!

387
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,010
Come have some chicken!

388
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:36,720
Let's have some chicken.

389
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:38,305
Jiwoong.

390
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:42,726
<i>I live alone with my grandma.</i>

391
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:45,395
<i>When I got in trouble at school,</i>

392
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:46,813
<i>Mr. Yoon stepped in.</i>

393
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:48,565
It's because of his upbringing.

394
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:50,609
It's not like that, ma'am.

395
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:53,028
- He's a good kid.
- Are you defending him?

396
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,279
Look what he's done!

397
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:56,573
You've fooled around long enough.

398
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:58,742
From now on, focus on boxing.

399
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,452
But I'm not talented.

400
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:04,164
I have a glass jaw and small fists.

401
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:07,042
You can still be a boxer
even if you have a glass jaw.

402
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,418
Just don't get hit.

403
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:12,505
Besides, boxing isn't just about fists.

404
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:13,923
It's about using your eyes.

405
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:17,218
And from what I can see,
you have sharp eyes.

406
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,976
He would even take my grandma
to the hospital

407
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,311
in the middle of the night,

408
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:28,396
send me money every now and then,

409
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:31,399
and give me private boxing lessons.

410
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,202
<i>But lately,</i>

411
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:44,788
he seemed pretty down.

412
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:47,123
I asked him what was wrong

413
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,709
and said I'd help him in any way I could.

414
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:54,422
At first, he said everything was fine
and I should focus on boxing.

415
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,968
But a few days before the fire…

416
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:04,974
he came over, completely drunk.

417
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:07,644
This is for your grandma.

418
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:09,562
She loves tangerines, right?

419
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:11,856
She does. Thank you.

420
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,109
I heard the national team
selection matches are scheduled.

421
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:16,152
Yes, they're on the 17th of next month.

422
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,987
That's coming up fast.

423
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:20,073
- Make sure to stay in shape.
- I will.

424
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,784
I'll get going.

425
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,537
- Is there something wrong, sir?
- What?

426
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,789
No, nothing's wrong.

427
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:31,584
Please let me know
if I can be of any help. I'll do anything.

428
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:34,045
Forget it.

429
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:35,630
I'm off.

430
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:39,342
Jiwoong.

431
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:46,683
I actually have a favor to ask.

432
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:50,979
So that favor was…

433
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,399
He said he was in a tight spot,

434
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,944
and this was the only solution.

435
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,489
<i>He said all I had to do</i>

436
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:05,702
<i>was set fire
to the pile of fry bits next to the fryer.</i>

437
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:12,125
Hey.

438
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,627
What are you doing?

439
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:24,512
-What the hell are you doing?
-It's not what you think it is.

440
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:25,764
Stay right there.

441
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,893
- I can explain everything.
- Give me my phone back.

442
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:32,312
-Please. I can explain!
-Give me that!

443
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:33,813
Please!

444
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:37,400
Please hear me out!

445
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:38,485
Give me my phone!

446
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:43,490
- Please let me explain!
- Let go!

447
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:44,991
Please, Hyojoo!

448
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,827
Hey, you!

449
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:15,563
<i>I couldn't think straight.</i>

450
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:18,650
<i>If Hyojoo had called the police…</i>

451
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:22,070
<i>and I'd been arrested,</i>

452
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:27,242
<i>all my hard work
would've gone down the drain.</i>

453
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,329
<i>But then the restaurant caught fire.</i>

454
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,338
I should've told the truth…

455
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:43,383
but I didn't have the courage.

456
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:49,097
Mr. Yoon said no one would find out
as long as I kept quiet.

457
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:52,267
Detective.

458
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:53,977
I…

459
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:56,896
I don't care if I go to prison,

460
00:30:57,897 --> 00:30:59,274
but what will happen to my grandma?

461
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:06,614
Who will take care of my grandma?

462
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,560
Aren't you bored?

463
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:39,564
Should I get your laptop from home?

464
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:41,608
Yes.

465
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:44,652
Okay, I'll bring it tomorrow.

466
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,031
Dad.

467
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,825
Yes? Do you need something else?

468
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:54,871
I saw Jiwoong at the restaurant that day.

469
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,875
I remember everything that happened.

470
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,544
I just pretended I didn't.

471
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:06,090
The fire…

472
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,011
You have something to do with it,
don't you?

473
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:14,057
Jiwoong said something strange.

474
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,434
He said he could explain everything.

475
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:18,728
I suspected…

476
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,522
you were involved…

477
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,568
so I played dumb.

478
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:29,405
As long as we keep quiet,

479
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:31,991
things will blow over.

480
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:37,872
So don't say anything.

481
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,417
You need to stay strong.

482
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,583
- Hey.
- Hey.

483
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,795
Why did you want to see me here
out of the blue?

484
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,631
-Up for some mitt work?
-What?

485
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,300
You know, for old times' sake.

486
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:36,180
Doing mitt work with you
always helped me clear my mind.

487
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:39,600
Shall we?

488
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,602
All right then.

489
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,522
Let's give it a try.

490
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,335
Hey, Moo Joongryeok!

491
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,589
Joongryeok…

492
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,717
You little…

493
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,219
-Do you remember?
-Remember what?

494
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,096
The reason you loved boxing.

495
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,224
No matter how cornered you were,

496
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,019
you said you could always turn it around.

497
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,774
No matter how certain you were to lose…

498
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,736
you said you always had
one shot left in you.

499
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:35,865
Did I say that?

500
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,786
Now that I look back…

501
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,543
I absolutely hated boxing.

502
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:51,672
<i>It hurt,</i>

503
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,217
and it was exhausting.

504
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,599
I only put up with it for your sake.

505
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:07,897
<i>Come to think of it…</i>

506
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:12,693
…I never said thank you.

507
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,078
Thank you, Minsoo.

508
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,123
Thank you so much.

509
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,217
Minsoo.

510
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,725
We still have one shot left in us, right?

511
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:58,364
It's not over until it's over, is it?

512
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:13,421
I'll get going.

513
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,714
Please come with us.

514
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:31,517
Doona, you're asleep, right?

517
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,847
Dad says to come during visiting hours.
He says it's been too long.

518
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:09,824
Oh?

519
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:11,826
Why are you taking that down?

520
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,786
It's our first team photo.

521
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:15,871
-Just because.
-That's not a good excuse.

522
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:19,375
After everything that happened,

523
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:21,627
I figured it wasn't a good memory anymore.

524
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:24,380
What does that have to do with the photo?

525
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,562
Mm.

526
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:41,313
I get it now.

527
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:44,191
What do you mean? Get what?

528
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:47,111
Why you took the photo down.

529
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:49,238
And why's that?

530
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:51,657
Anyway, I forbid you to take it down.

531
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:53,742
That's my order as your captain.

532
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,169
How did he figure it out?

533
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:05,337
Jeez.

534
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,470

00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:38,037
<i>A neighbor brought it
because someone asked them to.</i>

543
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,122
So you didn't see his face clearly.

544
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:42,833
Who did this? That bastard!

545
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:45,461
<i>The Violent Crimes Team
works hard to solve the case.</i>

546
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,546
In kidnapping cases, every second counts.

547
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,132
<i>Focus on securing
CCTV footage and witnesses.</i>

548
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:53,260
<i>But things take an unexpected turn.</i>

549
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,805
<i>The kidnapping case
of Choo Yoona will now be handled</i>

550
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,432
by the Special Investigation Team
from headquarters.

551
00:41:58,516 --> 00:41:59,683
<i>In the new setup,</i>

552
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,561
<i>Junghwan is torn between staying loyal
and getting a promotion.</i>

553
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,063
What were you doing in there?

554
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:06,315
If you so much as talk to them,
you're a traitor.

555
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:09,485
- <i>What will Junghwan choose?</i>
- Salute.

556
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:13,948
<i>And will the Violent Crimes Team
manage to find the kid?</i>

557
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:21,080
To be continued…
