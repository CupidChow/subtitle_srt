00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:44,919
"Listen, you little punk."

3
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,130
"I have my pride too."

4
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,720
"Did you just call me a punk?
You've come a long way."

5
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,640
"Are you scared
that girl will look down on you?"

6
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,101
"What did you just say, you bastard?"

7
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,770
"'Bastard'?"

8
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:10,195
"One last smoke
isn't too much to ask, is it?"

9
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:14,157
"One last smoke
isn't too much to ask, is it?"

10
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:15,992
"How could that happen?"

11
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:19,245
"I'm number two.
Who says I'm number three!"

12
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:22,874
"Listen, you moron.
I had a meal with your chief..."

13
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:26,795
"Did you really have to take
everything away from...me!"

14
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,547
"How much do you need?"

15
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,424
"I thought that could make you mine."

16
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,676
"Do I like you?"

17
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,639
- Captain.
- Yes?

18
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:40,183
Are you serious
about the Dongbang Group thing?

19
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:44,604
I don't see any other option for now.

20
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:47,482
I'm just a little worried.

21
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:50,443
They say,
"Nothing ventured, nothing gained."

22
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,403
Let's give it a shot and see how it goes.

23
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,488
All right.

24
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:00,036
"Wouldn't it be amazing?"

25
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,871
"We'll buy a house..."

26
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,124
"Are you scared that girl will..."

27
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,834
"What did you just say, you bastard?"

28
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,172
Has he lost his mind?

Episode 16

31
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,685
- Hi, everyone!
- Hey, Hyunseo.

32
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,770
-Look who's here.
-Hyunseo!

33
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,063
Hey, Hyunseo!

34
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,898
-What a surprise.
-Hi.

35
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,817
What brings you here?

36
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,194
Captain needed help with makeup,

37
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,362
so I asked her for help.

38
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:37,615
What do you know about makeup?

39
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,909
I even got a license.

40
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:44,497
Great job. Well done.
Nice job.

41
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,418
How dare you...

42
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,461
- Who's she? Ah.
- My sister.

43
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:53,006
What's going on, Tansik?

44
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:55,592
- Why are you smiling at her?
- It's nothing.

45
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,093
You're here.

46
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:58,636
Hello.

47
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,472
Please make sure
I look like a Gen MZ gangster.

48
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,433
Consider it done.

49
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,519
I got us an office nearby.

50
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,147
Are we getting a new office?

51
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,566
We're going to lure Lawyer Yoon there.

52
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,152
With method acting.

53
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:19,073
They say,
"Good acting starts with authenticity."

54
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:23,369
The moment we step into our office
in our makeup and costumes,

55
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,955
we're no longer
the Songwon Police Violent Crimes Team.

56
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,875
Instead, we become the MZ Gang,
the Dongbang Group.

57
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,877
Keep that in mind.

58
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,050
Is everyone ready?

59
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,718
- Yes.
- Okay, yes.

60
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:39,886
-Yes.
-Yes.

61
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,087
Hold the door, please!

62
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,719
<i>- The doors are closing.</i>
- Thank you.

64
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,426
What's this?

65
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,055
-What...
-Carry on.

66
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,099
You're doing great.

67
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,726
-Okay.
-Clean thoroughly.

68
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,436
What are you up to?

69
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,688
I'm setting up my desk.

70
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,523
Good. You're an expert at that.

71
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:58,816
Keep up the good work.

72
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,318
Okay.

The Undefeated Dongbang

74
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:07,033
My goodness.

75
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:09,202
Can kids these days
even read Chinese characters?

76
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,120
Who told you to hang this here?

77
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,374
I thought it'd brighten up the room.

78
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,627
No, all it does is

79
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,921
kill the vibe.

80
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,297
Jeez, come here.

81
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:23,800
Hold it.

82
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,638
"The"

83
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:29,722
Next.

84
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,016
Hold it.

85
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,478
"Undefeated"

86
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:36,729
Next. Hold it.

87
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,856
-What's with him?
-What?

88
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,941
"Dong"

89
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:42,276
Next. Do I have to tell you every time?

90
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,361
Sorry.

91
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,156
"bang"

92
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:50,660
Should I use tape
to hang these up, Captain?

93
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,912
...Ah.

94
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:55,540
"Captain"?
Did you call me "Captain"?

95
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:59,460
Didn't I tell you to call me Boss?
I'm gonna flip my lid!

96
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,505
I'll be careful
not to make your lid flip, Boss.

97
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:07,051
All right, be careful.

98
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:12,473
Wow. Captain's totally in character,
isn't he?

99
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,892
Now that we've settled in,

100
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,603
what's the first thing we should do
as gangsters?

101
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,858
I know. Let's go ransack a place!

102
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:26,195
Minseo, you too?
What do you mean, ransack a place?

103
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,782
- Isn't that what they do?
- They wage turf wars and stuff.

104
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,660
Jeez, just go wage a war
against each other.

105
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:35,329
Man, it's so noisy in here.

106
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,914
Keep your voices down, will you?

107
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,500
What's the first thing we should do, Boss?

108
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:41,836
Since we're a new gang,

109
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,796
we'll have to get our name out there.

110
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,381
Ah, what do you mean by that?

111
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,134
Let's get ourselves on the 'gram!

112
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,890
I'm sorry, but what does that mean?

113
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,808
The 'gram.

114
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,228
-The 'gram?
-The 'gram?

115
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:03,483
I mean Instagram.

116
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:08,362
Rookie, make us an account.

117
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:09,447
In the MZ style.

118
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,408
Yes, Boss. I'll get on it right away.

119
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,493
Good.

120
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,620
Let's do this.

121
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,121
Have you lost it?

122
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,998

123

00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,928

Shot after shot

127
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:40,645
I gave you more time.

128
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:41,979
Thank you.

129
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,190
Sorry, outside drinks
aren't allowed.

130
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,358
We didn't drink them.

131
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:47,068
-This is empty.
-This is just water.

132
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,153

136
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:06,837
How do I look? Do I look okay?

137
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:11,300
Get out of my way! I'm busy.
Move!

138
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,678
- Sorry.
- Those are fake.

139
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,054
Dongbang Forever Group

140
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,306
- They're mixed up.
- Ah.

141
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,600
Wasted at the gathering
#Glamping #DongbangGroup #MZ

142
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,812
What are you doing on the rooftop?

143
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,398
Sorry.

144
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,609
Hello!

145
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,904
We're Dongbang High seniors,
we'd like to join.

146
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,531
-I'm Kim Yeongjin!
-I'm Song Taeu!

147
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:34,740
Nice to meet you!

148
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:35,950
-The undefeated...
-Dongbang!

149
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,329
Excuse me.

150
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,667
Are you debt collectors?

151
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,836
I found you guys online.

152
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,303
We're ready to devote our lives
to the Dongbang Group!

153
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,470
We're Dongbang...

154
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:59,348
Why can't I be your client?

155
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,522
The undefeated Dongbang!

156
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:15,156
Our strategy doesn't seem
to be working.

157
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,158
Our posts aren't targeting
the right people.

158
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:18,826
How much longer do we have to do this?

159
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,161
I miss my kids so much.

160
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:22,413
Let's suggest a different plan.

161
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,249
Oh.

162
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,251
What a headache.

163
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,921
Have a seat, everyone.

164
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,760
Detectives! I mean, Boss.

165
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:39,221
I've been following
the MZ Union on social media,

166
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,431
they're planning a gathering.

167
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,016
A gathering?

168
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:45,936
It seems any gang is free
to participate.

169
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,732
If you leave a good impression,
you'll be invited to join the union.

170
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,317
What should we do?

171
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,527
Let's give it a shot.

172
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,112
Let's do this!

173
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,740
Let's show them
what we're made of!

174
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,200
Fine, let's go!

175
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,284
Yeah.

176
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,286
Sounds good.

177
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,916
We, the Dongbang Group,
will be the highlight of the gathering.

178
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,627
-Okay!
-Okay!

179
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,172
-The undefeated...
-Dongbang!

180
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,543
Keep your shoulders back.

181
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,305
Make some noise!

182
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,782
All right.

183
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,702
Nice to meet you all!

184
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:28,622
I'm Byeon Cheolyong
from the Lala Land Group in Uijeongbu!

185
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:35,212
Now, let's make a toast.

186
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,214
Everyone, fill your glasses.

187
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:40,134
Go ahead, fill your glasses to the brim.

188
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:42,011
Here we go.

189
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,054
- We are...
- The path!

190
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,515
- We are...
- The path!

191
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:52,229
Drink up! Drink as much
as you want.

192
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,315
- Bottoms up!
- Bottoms up? For real?

193
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:55,441
Bottoms up.

194
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,112
- It's too bitter.
- Ah!

195
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:03,616
- Can you drink mine for me?
- Don't be silly.

196
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,787
Hold on.

197
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,081
Some people haven't downed
their drinks yet.

198
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:14,335
I'm watching you, so bottoms up.

199
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,176
Ah!

200
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:27,139
I have an important
announcement to make.

201
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,433
We have some new faces here.

202
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:32,269
Where are you? Come up on stage.

203
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:41,737
Relax, it's okay.
Introduce yourself.

204
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,573
Hello, everyone!

205
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,996
I'm from the Fiery Fists in Jamwon-dong,
new to the MZ Union.

206
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,081
Here we go!

207
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,165
- Fiery...
- Fists!

208
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,458
- Fiery...
- Fists!

209
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,502
Fiery Fists!

210
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,672
With our fiery passion,

211
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:02,174
we'll do our best to help you!

212
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,551
A round of applause!

213
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:04,635
Hello, everyone.

214
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:07,263
It's an honor to join the MZ Union.

215
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,139
I'm from the Little Giants.

216
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,724
We're glad to be here.

217
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,685
Nice to meet you all!

218
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,478
A round of applause!

219
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,355
Size...

220
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:18,691
-Doesn't matter!
-Doesn't matter!

221
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:21,527
We might be small,

222
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,237
but we'll show you what we're made of.

223
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,905
-Let's do this!
-A round of applause!

224
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,949
Guys, shouldn't we do something too?

225
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,200
Like what? Who should do it?

226
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,702
Let me give it a try.

227
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:31,287
Sit back down.

228
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,538
Last but not least...

229
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,748
Captain... I mean, Boss.

230
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,086
Give him a round of applause!

231
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,381
What do we do?

232
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:45,384
Hello, everyone!

233
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:54,476
I'm from the Dongbang Group
in Songwon-dong.

234
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,228
Nice to meet you all!

235
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:01,734
The undefeated...

236
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,948
- Dongbang?
- Dongbang!

237
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,074
Dongbang!

238
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,619
-The undefeated...
-Dongbang!

239
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:13,871
I'll keep it short.

240
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,165
As a new member of the MZ Union,

241
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:19,209
we, the Dongbang Group, will do anything

242
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:22,713
to help our fellow members!

243
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,924
That's so cool.
Give it up for him, everyone!

244
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,803
On that note, let's do an acrostic poem
for "DBG," as in Dongbang Group.

245
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,472
An acrostic poem?

246
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,474
-An acrostic poem.
-An acrostic poem?

247
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:34,683
-Here we go.
-What do we do?

248
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,519
- D!
- D!

249
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,606
Dreams do come true.

250
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,152
- All right. B!
- B!

251
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:48,238
Because I'm finally part of the MZ Union!

252
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,828
That's nice.
Here's the last letter. G!

253
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:56,914
Get the party started!

254
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,999
Get the party started!

255
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,007
Great job.

256
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,301
-He planned it, didn't he?
-He definitely did.

257
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,552
-Totally.
-I'm positive.

258
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:17,476
I didn't expect him
to make me do that.

259
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,356
Now, go find out something
about Lawyer Yoon.

260
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:23,482
Yes, Captain.

261
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:25,526
What did you just call me?

262
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,363
Boss.

263
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,656
That's better.

264
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,078
Get moving.

265
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,454
Yes...

266
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:38,914
Yes, Boss.

267
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:46,296
Can I ask you something?

268
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,215
What is it?

269
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:51,010
I'm interested in running a gambling site.

270
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,803
They don't just let anyone do that.

271
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,931
I heard you butter up
Lawyer Yoon or whatever he's called.

272
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,558
I've heard a lot about him too.

273
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,186
By the way, how old are you?
Show some respect.

274
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,605
I'm pretty sure I'm older than you.

275
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,899
I'm quite old. I was born in '00.

276
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,401
Ah.

277
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,069
Then you're older than me.

278
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,821
Can we take a picture together?

279
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,114
Sure, let's do it.

280
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,409
Stretch your arm a bit more.

281
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:17,911
Will do.

282
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,998
So you're running a crypto business?

283
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,998
So you're running a crypto business?

284
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:23,625
Something like that.
What do you guys do?

285
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,961
You don't want to know.

286
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:27,921
So cocky.

287
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,507
Stop being cocky. Just tell us.

288
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,261
We go after people.

289
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:37,514
You go after people?

290
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,933
And we lock them up.

291
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,644
Where?

292
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,564
A place you can't leave...

293
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,901
...alive.

294
00:17:55,282 --> 00:18:01,080
97 Union

295
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,334
Where are the 97 Union guys?

296
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,130
-I'm one of them.
-Are you class of '97?

297
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,423
No way.

298
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,717
You can't be 97 years old, right?

299
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:16,386
What are you talking about?

300
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:20,015
-You're not, are you?
-Can't you see? It says "97 Union" here.

301
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,809
-Were you born in '97?
-Yeah.

302
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,227
-So you're 27 years old?
-No.

303
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,646
I knew it. You almost had me there.

304
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,314
My birthday hasn't passed yet.
I'm still 26.

305
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,274
You must've been through a lot.

306
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,692
Hey, thanks.

307
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,656
Ah!

308
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:37,783
Hey, you...

309
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,204
Ah!

310
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,211
You did a good job back there.
Let's drink.

311
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,839
-Thank you, sir.
-Drink up.

312
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,932
-Ah!
-You're a good drinker.

313
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,100
I'm not bad.

314
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,518
That's good.

315
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,563
Let me treat you sometime.

316
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,231
Sounds good.

317
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,817
Let's meet up when we both have time.

318
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,070
Can I ask you something, sir?

319
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,196
What is it?

320
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:21,410
I've lost a ton of money gambling online.

321
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,203
-So?
-That taught me a thing or two

322
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,746
about online gambling.

323
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,874
Now I understand
how the whole thing works.

324
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,168
I'm basically an expert.

325
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,670
So I'd like to run a business,

326
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,965
but I can't get my hands on the program.

327
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,511
So you're saying
you want to run a gambling site?

328
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:42,222
Give me a chance, and I'll work hard.

329
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,974
Hm...

330
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,937
That's not my decision to make.

331
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:52,107
Have you ever heard of Lawyer Yoon?

332
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,194
I can give you his messenger info.

333
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:58,447
At the end of the day,
he's the one who decides.

334
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,366
That'll be very helpful, sir.

335
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,204
-Have a drink.
-Of course.

336
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,122
Drink up. Bottoms up.

337
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,381
Hannuri Travel Agency

338
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,384
<i>This is Dongbang</i>
<i>from the Dongbang Group.</i>

339
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,721
<i>I'm reaching out because I'd like to join</i>
<i>your online gambling business.</i>

340
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:25,390
<i>Get back to me, and I'll risk it all.</i>

341
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,642
Lawyer Yoon

342
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:27,768
All right, sent.

343
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,019
Good.

344
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,520
The die is cast.

345
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,189
All we can do now is wait.

346
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:35,984
I'm worried we're relying
too much on this Lawyer Yoon.

347
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,403
This is the only way to bust their boss.

348
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:41,073
Mastar only communicates with him.

349
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,241
To lure Lawyer Yoon,

350
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:47,537
keep posting about our activities
on social media.

351
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,581
Share two posts each every day.

352
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:51,667
That's too many.

353
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,377
-You think so?
-Yes.

354
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,753
Then make it three.

355
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,964
Let's just settle for two.

356
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,259
Listen, Detective Moo.

357
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,679
Why do you keep complaining?
Are you disobeying me?

358
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,722
No, Boss.

359
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,432
Good. That's better.

360
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,310
Now, get to work, everyone.

361
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:11,728
Yes, sir.

362
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,441
What's with him?

363
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:19,152
- The way Captain walks...
- The boss, not the captain.

364
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,696
The way Boss walks...

365
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,781
- Is he the captain now...
- I think the boss.

366
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,284
He is, judging by the way
he's walking.

367
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,119
I think he's just a weirdo.

368
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,415
Let's finish up.

369
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:33,250
It's time to switch.

370
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,334
Yes, Boss.

371
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,129
That came out wrong. Yes, Captain.

372
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:43,260
What are you staring at,
woman?

373
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,389
- Sorry.
- What a mess.

374
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,601
Mom! Mom!

375
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,525
Gosh, time flies.

376
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,694
Let's call it a day.

377
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,029
Yes, Captain.

378
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,282
That came out wrong.

379
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,329
Sounds good, Boss.

380
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,292
What?

381
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:18,962
Jeez.

382
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,756
Hey, wake up.

383
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:35,604
- Mine is already cold.
- No, it isn't.

384
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,109
Is this the Dongbang Group office?

385
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,904
We're having our lunch break.
Please come back later.

386
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:46,198
Better yet, don't come back.

387
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:52,579
Are you closed for the day?
I'm here to talk business.

388
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:54,331
Who are you anyway?

389
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:55,749
I'm Lawyer Yoon.

390
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:05,675
- Thank you for your message.
- Sure.

391
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:09,262
Put your trust in us,
and you won't be disappointed.

392
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:10,889
This isn't about trust.

393
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:12,933
You seem to have a good reputation though.

394
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,769
Is this everyone?

395
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:18,980
Yes, it's just us,
but we can get a lot done.

396
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:20,732
Introduce yourselves.

397
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:24,986
Nice to meet you, sir.

398
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,906
I'm Sharpie, and I'm in charge of sales.

399
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,075
As in the pen?

400
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:32,702
As in "sharpshooter."

401
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,121
Nice to meet you.

402
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:37,165
They call me a lot of things,
but most know me as "Nigerian Prince."

403
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:41,044
That rings a bell.
I think I've heard of you.

404
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,796
I don't mean to brag,

405
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:46,800
but I'm sure that most people have gotten
an email from me at least once.

406
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:48,218
She's a legend.

407
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:51,721
She was a true pioneer in the field.

408
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:57,477
Sup dawg, I'm the money mule, Wang Tansik.

409
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,729
"Sup dawg"? Where are you from?

410
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:02,482
- It's a Chuncheon dialect?
- That's where I'm from, dawg.

411
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:05,819
My mom's side of the family is from there,
and that's not the Chuncheon dialect.

412
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,821
Was it Suncheon then?

413
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:11,032
I've never set foot in Chuncheon.
I'm from Suncheon, dawg.

414
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:15,120
Don't mind him.
Who cares where he's from?

415
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:17,038
I'm One Punch from Bongcheon-dong.

416
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,249
-Let me tell you a bit about myself--
-Later.

417
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,042
Yep.

418
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:26,214
You all seem full of energy
and pretty sharp. I like it.

419
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,508
We're just doing our best.

420
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,845
We might end up working together,
so I'll keep things informal.

421
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:35,932
Do you mean
we might start working for Mastar?

422
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:40,395
Hey, you shouldn't mention
his name so casually.

423
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,898
He must be a big deal.

424
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,609
I've only heard his name a few times.

425
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:49,446
I'm his closest aide,
but even I hardly ever get to see him.

426
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:53,617
He completely took over the field
within three years

427
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,369
and now handles

428
00:24:56,453 --> 00:25:01,708
tens, no, hundreds
of billions of won daily.

429
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:05,504
In short, he's a living legend.

430
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:09,341
And he's giving you a task.

431
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:13,887
Ah. What kind of task is
such an important person giving us?

432
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,514
Is this an IOU?

433
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:17,849
The borrower has defaulted
on a substantial loan.

434
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,185
- But it's not about the money.
- A billion won?

435
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:22,395
We need to keep this under wraps

436
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,189
because our business
relies on word of mouth.

437
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:27,609
So we'd like to set an example.

438
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,278
What do you mean by that?

439
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,697
We'd appreciate it
if you could get it sorted out.

440
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,325
Think of it as a test.

441
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,457
Well...

442
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:47,212
Consider it done, sir.

443
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:48,338
We'll take care of it.

444
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,131
Okay.

445
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,890
This must be it.

446
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:02,143
How could you accept
a job like this on your own?

447
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,896
What if things go wrong?

448
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,065
The kids must be extremely strong.

449
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,318
If you're scared,
stay in the car.

450
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:14,030
Warm up, everyone.
Let's show them what we've got.

451
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:24,291
-Where are they?
-Guys.

452
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:25,792
Spread out and search.

453
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,127
-Let's do that.
-Okay.

454
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,211
Search that way.

455
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,051
Is this it?

456
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:48,815
Who sent you?

457
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:51,401
Who are you, you little prick?

458
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,069
-Sorry?
-Answer me.

459
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:57,365
Well, I'm not sure...

460
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,493
-What's going on?
-Guys!

461
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:01,995
One after another, huh?

462
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:06,124
-Who are you?
-Ever heard of the Dongbang Group?

463
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:09,252
What a corny name.
Are you YouTubers or something?

464
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:10,795
I hear you have some debt.

465
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,714
We're here to collect it.

466
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,675
You're not only rude but also reckless.

467
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:18,136
Guys, get rid of them!

468
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,180
Yes, sir!

469
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,015
Get started.

470
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:24,726
- Come here!
- Hey!

471
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:37,697
Come here! Let's have some fun!

472
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:45,497
Okay.

473
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:56,758
Are you okay, Minseo?

474
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,843
- Sorry!
- It's me!

475
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:02,555
One, two, three!

476
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:19,823
Tansik!

477
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,788
Nice job!

478
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:24,846
I'm sorry. Please forgive me this once.

479
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,890
It was a mistake.

480
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:29,184
Please forgive me this once.

481
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,437
We're the Songwon Police
Violent Crimes Team.

482
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:34,481
Are you police officers?

483
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:36,649
We're in the middle of an operation.

484
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:39,903
Anyway, please keep
this arrest confidential.

485
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:42,447
Don't inform the higher-ups yet.

486
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,240
Also, make sure
it doesn't leak to the press.

487
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:45,450
Promise?

488
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,368
I promise.

489
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,287
Are you really a police officer?

490
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,080
See for yourself.

491
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:55,502
Hannuri Travel Agency

492
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:56,878
<i>You got it done?</i>

493
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,755
We collected the debt as you requested,

494
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:02,383
down to the last cent.

495
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:06,262
Okay, I'll come over later today.

496
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,473
I have a better idea.

497
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,642
Let us come over this time.

498
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:13,686
We'll have to purchase
the program and website,

499
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:17,106
and it's a big investment.
We need a demonstration too.

500
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,691
<i>You want to come over?</i>

501
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:21,736
It only makes sense to visit headquarters
before opening a branch.

502
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,112
I'm afraid you can't do that.

503
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:28,117
I thought we were family.
I'm disappointed.

504
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,331
Fine.

505
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,208
<i>I'm not supposed to do this though.</i>

506
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:38,127
<i>Okay, come over this afternoon.</i>

507
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:40,797
<i>I'll send you the address.</i>
<i>See you in a bit.</i>

508
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:45,301
All right.
Please text me the time and place.

509
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:46,386
<i>Will do.</i>

510
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:47,720
Thank you, sir.

511
00:30:58,314 --> 00:30:59,732
Round One
Welcome to our place

512
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,192
Is this the right place?

513
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,778
It's the right address.

514
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:07,657
Their office is in
such a crowded area.

515
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,325
The business actually
seems to be operating.

516
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:12,704
So this is their cover
for operating dozens of gambling sites?

517
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:17,292
They're a national gang after all.
Why don't we request backup?

518
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:18,418
There won't be any backup.

519
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:22,714
The Cyber Bureau seems to suspect
that our information isn't reliable.

520
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,216
Whether there are a hundred
or a thousand of them inside,

521
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,843
we'll have to handle them ourselves.

522
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,721
Is anyone backing out now?

523
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:37,687
Be confident.

524
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:39,439
Who are we?

525
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:41,399
-The Dongbang Group.
-The Dongbang Group.

526
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:42,734
Who are we?

527
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:44,694
-The Dongbang Group.
-The Dongbang Group.

528
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:46,195
Who are we?

529
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,655
The Dongbang Group!

530
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,198
We're the Dongbang Group!

531
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:50,283
Let's go.

532
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:52,452
- Yes, Boss!
- Yes, Boss!

533
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,164
We're not the Dongbang Group.

534
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:58,291
We're the Songwon Police
Violent Crimes Team.

535
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,753
- How many are there?
- Bring it on!

536
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:03,546
Just how many are there?

537
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,258
It really is the right address.

538
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:08,843
What is this, a library?

539
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,261
How can I help you?

540
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:15,391
-You're the Dongbang Group, right?
-Yes.

541
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:18,186
Please wait over there.
Lawyer Yoon will be here soon.

542
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,437
Okay.

543
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,731
Help yourselves to some coffee.

544
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:23,650
- Coffee?
- Sure.

545
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,653
Let's have a seat.
He told us to wait over there.

546
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:30,907
Goodness.

547
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,952
Jeez, this sofa is harder than I thought.

548
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:36,496
You're already here.

549
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:38,414
Sorry.

550
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:42,460
There was bad traffic.

551
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:47,840
I bet those guys
were difficult to handle.

552
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:49,175
I'm impressed.

553
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:51,928
We were just doing our job.

554
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:53,304
So this is headquarters?

555
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:54,889
What? Yes.

556
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,225
It's different
from what you expected, right?

557
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,977
While you guys handle the legwork,

558
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,270
these guys use their brains
to bring in the money.

559
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:03,856
I see. Is our program ready?

560
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:08,569
I have the latest version ready for you.

561
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,115
With just a few clicks,

562
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,033
you can manipulate the odds of winning.

563
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:19,497
Mr. Jung, please demonstrate.

564
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:27,088
Are you feeling under the weather?
You don't look well.

565
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,884
You can log in as an administrator.

566
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:34,512
I'll send you the username and password.

567
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,224
The current odds of winning are 51 to 49.
Do you see that?

568
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:42,478
-Yes.
-You can adjust the odds here.

569
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,564
If you have any questions,
feel free to ask.

570
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:45,648
Okay.

571
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:50,236
Is Mastar not here?

572
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:53,614
I told you that he rarely shows up.

573
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,826
He gives me orders online, and that's it.

574
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:01,706
You don't know what he looks like?
That's a shame.

575
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:04,292
I've checked the program.

576
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,753
Go ahead and arrest all of them.

577
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,629
Yes, sir.

578
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,382
You're all under arrest.
Please cooperate.

579
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,217
It's over now.

580
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,386
Who are you?
What do you think you're doing?

581
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:17,680
Stay still, please.

582
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,599
You have the right
to remain silent.

583
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:22,226
-You're a lawyer, you know how this goes.
-I'm not a lawyer.

584
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,936
Put your hands on your head!

585
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:27,023
Hands on top of your head!
Stand up!

586
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:30,777
Follow me!

587
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,403
-What the...
-Hurry up.

588
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,116
Let's go.

589
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,036
I'll carry your bag, Captain.

590
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,370
Shit Well Daycare Center

591
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:43,581
Songwon Police Station
has moved to a temporary location

592
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:46,501
I looked
into Mastar's identity,

593
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,961
but he hasn't shown any signs of activity
since last year.

594
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,379
He hasn't left the country either.

595
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:52,965
Could he have stowed away?

596
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,592
That's a possibility.

597
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:57,178
Many criminals
have their offices overseas.

598
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:59,931
If he's abroad,
there's no way we can find him.

599
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:03,851
Should we go talk to
some stowaway brokers?

600
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:07,438
Can I take another look at the texts
between him and Lawyer Yoon?

601
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,273
-I'll bring it to you.
-Thank you.

602
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:20,326
Date, Time, Name

603
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,253
<i>They communicated mostly</i>
<i>in the evenings.</i>

604
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,970
<i>The only times they communicated</i>
<i>during the day</i>

605
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,429
<i>were on weekends.</i>

606
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:43,933
<i>On weekdays,</i>

607
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:47,937
<i>their communications</i>
<i>always ended before 9 p.m..</i>

608
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:52,150
<i>There must've been a reason</i>
<i>they only communicated</i>

609
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,818
<i>in the evenings on weekdays.</i>

610
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,781
Come in.

611
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:04,579
Det. Jung is investigating
some stowaway brokers who work with China,

612
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:08,624
and Mastar allegedly stowed away
to China last winter.

613
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,419
-Is that right?
-The broker's still in touch with him.

614
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:14,005
Should we search for him in China?

615
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:17,550
Captain, about the branches,

616
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,010
it seems they've caught wind

617
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:21,512
that their headquarters has been busted.

618
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:24,599
Even if we conduct a raid now,
we might not be able to round them up.

619
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:25,683
What do you think?

620
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:29,312
- Park Seongun, known as Mastar.
- Yes.

621
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,939
I think I know where he is.

622
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:34,317
You know where Mastar is?

623
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:39,488
I found a pattern in his texts.

624
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:43,993
<i>On weekdays,</i>
<i>he only texts between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m..</i>

625
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:47,872
<i>On weekends,</i>
<i>he texts from morning until 9 p.m..</i>

626
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:50,166
<i>But since July of last year,</i>

627
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:54,003
<i>he's been texting</i>
<i>from morning until 9 p.m. on weekdays too.</i>

628
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:55,880
- <i>Since July of last year?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

629
00:36:57,215 --> 00:37:00,635
<i>I looked into it,</i>
<i>and I found a clue.</i>

630
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:03,512
<i>Starting in July of last year,</i>

631
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:06,557
<i>some troops were allowed</i>
<i>to extend their mobile phone use.</i>

632
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,226
July, 2023, Extended phone
use is permitted

633
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:10,269
<i>They can now use their phones</i>
<i>during work hours.</i>

634
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:11,896
Military Police

635
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:12,980
<i>So that means...</i>

636
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,942
- <i>Mastar's in the military.</i>
- "We are the Korean army."

637
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:19,654
<i>He must be in a troop where</i>
<i>this extended phone use is permitted.</i>

638
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,083
Military police

639
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:34,210
Damn it.

640
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:45,137
Matstar

641
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,223
Mastar

642
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:52,895
Nice to meet you.

643
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,898
I didn't know what you liked,
so I brought some fried chicken.

644
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:58,818
Who are you?

645
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,989
I'm from the Songwon Police
Violent Crimes Team.

646
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,825
Should I call you Mastar?

647
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,413
You know Lawyer Yoon, right?

648
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,501
I've handed Park Seongun over
to the military police.

649
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:17,378
They agreed to collaborate with us.

650
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,715
Start arresting the rest immediately.

651
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,009
Damn it!

652
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,052
Left, left.

653
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:28,681
One, two, one, two.

654
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:30,683
- One, two, three, four.
- Come on!

655
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,518

Left...

660
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:46,866

664
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,003
Louder!

665
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:01,005
-One!
-One!

666
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:03,215
- Two!
- That hurts!

667
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,634
- Hey!
- Why are you hitting me?

668
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:08,554
-Try again. One!
-One!

00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:10,306

-Two!
-I'm sorry!

673
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:26,572
Clap three times.

674
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:30,034
Stand close to the wall.
Hands on shoulders.

675
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:31,577
Move forward!

00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:08,114
Hurry up and write!

681
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:10,533
Write your name first.

682
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:12,326
Why are you hitting just me?

683
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,287
-Fill it out already.
-I am!

684
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:23,879
Attention, everyone.

685
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:26,298
It seems like
you haven't come to your senses yet.

686
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:29,427
Your charges may vary,

687
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:32,138
but there's one crime
you've all committed.

688
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:34,723
Organization of criminal groups.

689
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:37,768
Gangsters like you are usually indicted

690
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:41,856
for various offenses, such as threat,
bodily harm, and intimidation,

691
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,732
so you're likely to face
aggravated punishment.

692
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:47,945
You could face at least
four years in prison, a life sentence,

693
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:50,781
or even capital punishment.

694
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,202
But listen.

695
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:58,581
There's still hope.

696
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:02,835
One person who makes the
biggest contribution to the investigation

697
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,754
will be exempt from punishment.

698
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:11,385
So stop fooling around and wasting time,

699
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,221
and cooperate as much as you can.

700
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,390
You have 10 minutes. Begin.

701
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,936
Write down everything you know.

702
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:24,023
-Be honest.
-Don't leave anything out.

703
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:25,691
Write legibly.

704
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:36,410
It seems like all of you wrote
as much as you could.

705
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:38,787
There are too many of you,

706
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:40,789
so you'll be held in custody
at the main building.

707
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:44,877
Detective Moo,
please hand every single one of them over.

708
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,962
What's going on?

709
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,672
Quiet down, quiet down!

710
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,633
Stand up.

711
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:52,051
Stand up!

712
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:57,097
Damn cops.

713
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:04,730
Get inside!

714
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,946
You can't enter.

715
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,782
You can't enter, ma'am!

716
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:16,534
Mom?

717
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:23,123
It's my mom! Let go!

718
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,376
I didn't know Cheolyong
was a mama's boy!

719
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:28,629
Shut up, you punks!

720
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:32,841
Why are you here? You're embarrassing me.

721
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:35,970
It's nothing serious.

722
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,472
You know
I've been running a business, right?

723
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:39,890
Things went a little sideways.

724
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:43,060
My partner sold me out and disappeared.

725
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,104
It's no big deal,

726
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:47,439
so don't worry and go home.

727
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:49,441
You trust me, don't you?

728
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:53,112
How could you...

729
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:03,956
How could you do this to me?

730
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:08,294
Mom, I...

731
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:13,465
Mom.

732
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:20,180
Mom.

733
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:25,519
Mom.

734
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:31,627
<i>Perhaps...</i>

735
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:33,879
I knew it all along...

736
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:37,132
but I was too proud to admit it.

737
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:38,801
One of the cases

738
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,262
involves stalking and kidnapping.

739
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:43,972
The suspect hasn't been identified yet.

740
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:46,892
Remind you of anybody?

741
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:26,265
Seoul Busters

742
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:27,349
<i>Coming up.</i>

743
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:29,226
<i>Why do you think</i>
<i>an elite detective</i>

744
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:31,979
<i>left to join this insignificant</i>
<i>Violent Crimes Team?</i>

745
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:33,897
<i>This might be</i>
<i>a serial killing case.</i>

746
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,691
<i>Ketaflurane. It's a general anesthetic.</i>

747
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:38,569
<i>The MO is similar to Jaein's case.</i>
<i>It appears to be the same person.</i>

748
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:39,945
<i>Catch him no matter what.</i>

749
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:41,697
<i>Look into that detective's background.</i>

750
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:44,241
<i>-He's been located.</i>
<i>-Standby team, move in!</i>

751
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:45,325
<i>Come here!</i>

752
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:48,120
<i>Every moment presents a choice</i>

753
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:50,122
<i>and can be the beginning of a case.</i>

754
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:53,000
No!

755
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,335
Let's change the plan. It's too dangerous.

756
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:57,463
<i>Stick to the plan.</i>
<i>We need to catch the culprit.</i>

757
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:59,339
Okay, bring it on.

758
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:02,384
<i>You don't know who you're up against.</i>

759
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:04,553
<i>What are you waiting for? Request backup.</i>

760
00:46:04,636 --> 00:46:06,388
<i>They'll be heading to Songnae Mountain.</i>

761
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:07,848
<i>It's over. Drop the gun.</i>

762
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:11,226
To be continued...
