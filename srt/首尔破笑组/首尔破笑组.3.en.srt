2
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:47,088
We need to talk
to Mr. Jang's ex-secretary.

3
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,840
She quit six months ago.

4
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,844
What? The perp got busted?

5
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,847
Who busted who?

00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,475

{\an8}WISH-IT-WELL DAYCARE CENTER

8
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,104
I didn't mean to lie.

9
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,981
I just wanted to avoid trouble.

10
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:06,691
I'm looking for a job too.

11
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,777
I mean it, Detective.

12
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,237
Do you know what makes someone fake?

13
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:12,614
Sorry?

14
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:15,742
It's when they pretend to be
something they're not.

15
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,911
Don't leave anything out.

16
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:20,997
Write down everything you did
and didn't do at Lim Dongil's place,

17
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,291
including when you arrived and left.

18
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:25,543
I didn't do much at all.

19
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:28,046
The more you leave out,
the more suspicion you'll raise.

20
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:32,258
So, imagine you're taking the SAT
and your life depends on it.

21
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,760
Think carefully and write everything down.

22
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,763
If you can't remember something,

23
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,973
do you see that over there?

24
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,768
Sitting in that chair will help you.

25
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:44,437
It's a thinking chair. Got that?

26
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:52,237
That's just bullying.

27
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,906
Jeez, that hurts.

28
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,452
Wait! Think for a second.

29
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,713
Think and think.

30
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:14,551
Think and think. Think and think.

31
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:21,599
He doesn't seem like someone
who could kill a person.

32
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:22,684
Exactly.

33
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:26,479
That's what makes him
even more suspicious.

34
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:30,400
He borrowed an apartment
and a car from Lim Dongil.

35
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:33,361
Who would benefit the most
from Lim Dongil being gone?

36
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:34,737
It's him.

37
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,365
Why would he lie about what he did
if he was innocent?

38
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:39,159
How much did he borrow from Lim Dongil?

39
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,535
That's not important.

40
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,579
-Around a million won, sir.
-A million won?

41
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,831
That's not a small amount, is it?

42
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,833
A tenth of it was in gift vouchers.

43
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,002
Gift vouchers are just like money.

44
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,503
Detective Moo.

45
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:52,255
Shouldn't you have informed me first?

46
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,883
I was going to,
but I thought I should bust him first.

47
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,426
You should've notified me first.

48
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,472
If this happens again,
I'll take official disciplinary action.

49
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,187
You got the wrong guy.

50
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,563
Captain.

51
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:10,398
Have you contacted Mr. Jang's secretary?

52
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:14,110
Oh, I've been trying to reach her,
but no luck.

53
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,156
Regarding Jeon Minsik,
file a warrant request

54
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,158
only for his existing charges.

55
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,286
What do you think you're doing?

56
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,122
He's our prime suspect.
We need a thorough investigation.

57
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,376
If you want to investigate him,
bring the evidence.

58
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,010
Guys,

59
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,763
he just deliberately undermined me,
didn't he?

60
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:45,433
To be fair, he has a point.

61
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,477
You probably got the wrong guy.

62
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:50,772
Whatever.

63
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,483
Anyway, how am I supposed
to bring that woman in?

64
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:54,943
I can't even reach her.

65
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,361
A woman?

66
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:57,946
Who?

67
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,450
I heard you're not eating.

68
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:06,120
Minjae wasn't just one of my actors.

69
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:08,039
He was like a little brother to me.

70
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:11,417
Actually, he called me
the day before he killed himself.

71
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,835
What did he say?

72
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,046
He said he was struggling
after the incident.

73
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,507
He was childish, short-tempered,

74
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,634
and would do whatever he wanted.

75
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,180
But he was actually soft-hearted.

76
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,265
So?

77
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,519
I should've met him that day.

78
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,689
He wanted to grab a drink,

79
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,024
but I couldn't
because I was on herbal medication.

80
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:38,528
I told him we should catch up
once I was done with them.

81
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,862
If it's any comfort,

82
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,616
I recently saw a movie called
Pieces of Friendship.

83
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,618
There's this line in it.

84
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:50,373
"Time may not heal all wounds,
but it does fade all memories."

85
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,583
I saw that movie at a special screening.

86
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,670
The final beach scene was incredible,
wasn't it?

87
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,380
Yes, I guess.

88
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,758
Ugh, that bastard.

89
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,345
How could he leave like that?

90
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,015
If only I wasn't on these meds…

91
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,438
I heard the two of them go way back.

92
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,232
Mr. Jang seemed really shaken up.

93
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,151
I'm not sure.

94
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,737
Didn't you just see him?

95
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,281
He was crying and everything.
He seemed heartbroken.

96
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:25,325
It didn't seem that way to me.

97
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,870
Are you suggesting he was acting?

98
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:33,374
He's supposed to be refusing all food,
but his cuff was stained with soy sauce.

99
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,544
I told him we should catch up
once I was done with them.

100
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,548
Unless he's moonlighting at a restaurant,

101
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:43,217
he must've had sushi for lunch.

102
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:46,220
Soy sauce can drip down
when you eat sushi with your hands.

103
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,305
"SOY SAUCE STAIN"

104
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:48,556
Also, his breath smelled minty.

105
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,268
I figure he must've snagged
a mint at the restaurant.

106
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,187
A mint?

107
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,856
He doesn't strike me
as the type to buy them.

108
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:01,361
But he's got a solid alibi.

109
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,197
A ton of people saw him
at the VIP screening.

110
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,450
I think you're jumping to conclusions.

111
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,910
I'd call it deduction.

112
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:14,165
Look closely around you,
and you might uncover unexpected details.

113
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,794
What are you, Sherlock Holmes?

114
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:22,131
- Not this one.
- What's wrong?

115
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,508
It's going up.

116
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:28,262
Why don't you look
more closely around you?

117
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,225
You seem to be missing
what's right before your eyes.

118
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,813
{\an8}SONGWON POLICE STATION
HAS MOVED TO A TEMPORARY LOCATION

119
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:40,775
Detective Jang, see me in my office.

120
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,360
Me, sir?

121
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,529
How's it going with Mr. Jang's secretary?

122
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:47,198
Oh, she won't budge an inch.

123
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:49,075
She's refusing to cooperate.

124
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:50,868
She'll show up.

125
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:52,954
She will? Why all of a sudden?

126
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:55,248
Why else? I asked her to.

127
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:58,960
Come on, as if she'd just listen to you.

128
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:03,214
Look, you can't just boss a woman around.

129
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,800
Forget it. You wouldn't get it.

130
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:20,356
Speak of the devil.

131
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,483
I'm here to see Detective Moo Joongryeok.

132
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,322
That'd be me.

133
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,668
SEOUL BUSTERS

134
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:43,588
So you were Mr. Jang's secretary at JMT?

135
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:47,258
I worked with him
since he started the company.

136
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:50,970
But eventually,
I got tired of him and quit.

137
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:55,641
Did Kang Minjae have
any enemies within the company?

138
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:58,144
Most of them were.

139
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,688
The thing about him is…

140
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:02,690
…he can be a real pain.

141
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,650
How did he get along with Mr. Jang?

142
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,944
Mr. Jang had to put up with him.

143
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,530
His whole company relied on Kang Minjae.

144
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,908
I heard they were like brothers.

145
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,659
"Brothers"?

146
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,870
Well, they go way back.

147
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,372
They even lived together for a bit.

148
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,174
By the way, this is top secret…

149
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,135
but my friend at TMT told me…

150
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,763
that Kang Minjae was planning

151
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,390
to ditch his contract with JMT
and join them.

152
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:40,478
If that's true,
Mr. Jang must've been in deep water.

153
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,647
After that Octopus Game or Hagfish Game

154
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,608
or whatever it is blew up,
Kang Minjae became a big deal.

155
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:49,695
Mr. Jang scored some big bucks
from China riding on his success.

156
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,031
Being in deep water
would be an understatement.

157
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,866
For all I know,

158
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,203
he was probably on the verge of drowning.

159
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,128
Anyway, since I showed up and talked,

160
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,339
hold up your end of the deal

161
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,591
and have a meal with me, Detective Moo.

162
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,470
I already ate.

163
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,057
But I want to eat now.

164
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:29,860
You do?

165
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,871
Uh, Detectives Jung and Moo,

166
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,623
I need you to head over to TMT.

167
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,292
I'm busy today.

168
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,960
-Detective Seo, can you--
-I'm busy.

169
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,629
Detective Seo, I'm taking you somewhere.

170
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,715
-Where?
-Let's go see a movie.

171
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:51,799
Me?

172
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,427
A movie? Together?

173
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,554
With Detective Seo, not you.

174
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,347
Why… I mean, what movie?

175
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,890
300 Days of Confessions.

176
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,559
-300 Days of…
-Confessions?

177
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,644
You're fine with that, right?

178
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,313
I'll wait in the car.

179
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:12,361
-Has he lost his mind?
-Does he think I'm that easy?

180
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:23,205
Hey, I bet our captain
will get in huge trouble soon.

181
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:24,832
What do you mean?

182
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,793
Has he completely lost it?

183
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,712
Going to the movies?

184
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,797
With his subordinate, while on duty?

185
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:36,302
I looked up the movie, and it's a rom-com.

186
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:37,511
It's totally a date.

187
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:41,057
This precinct has gone to the dogs.

188
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,934
Isn't it a good thing
if they get together?

189
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,062
Detective Seo can be a bit of a slob

190
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,147
and has a short fuse,
but she's a good person.

191
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,940
She's too good for him.

192
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:54,111
She is a bit of a slob though.

193
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,321
Here's your popcorn.

194
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:57,615
Thank you.

195
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,118
Let's go in. It's Theater 4.

196
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,954
Let me see. It's that way.

197
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,665
Wait.

198
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,460
What the…
Are we really watching a movie together?

199
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:19,178
The Riverside Star
Forest Central Éclatni Palace!

200
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,932
An exceptional choice
for a prestigious person like you!

201
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:26,519
Dad! I love our place!

202
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,271
-Detective Seo.
-Yes?

203
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,690
Do you feel uncomfortable?

204
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,360
Yes, sort of.

205
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,113
You're denser than I thought.

206
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,448
I gave you plenty of hints.

207
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:44,453
I usually don't have time
to go to the movies with a colleague.

208
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,330
Gosh.

209
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,958
Captain.

210
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,085
I'm sorry, but--

211
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:53,003
You know what, Detective Seo?

212
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,133
In English, you "ask someone out,"
not "confess your feelings,"

213
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:00,094
because they don't hide their feelings.

214
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:04,598
I don't want to hide my feelings
from you either.

215
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,016
Actually…

216
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,821
I'm sorry, Captain, but--

217
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,364
-Detective Seo.
-Yes?

218
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,490
Do you feel uncomfortable?

219
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,534
Please don't do this.

220
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:24,910
Detective Seo.

221
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:30,040
I have to go to the restroom.

222
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,292
Wait.

223
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,877
-What the…
-Gosh, why now?

224
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,089
What's the deal with him?

225
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,093
What the heck?

226
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:54,815
I'm sorry.

227
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,985
Is he making his poop
from scratch in there?

228
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,406
Why did he even bring me here then?

229
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,867
He should've invited me
to the restroom instead.

230
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:06,869
Jeez.

231
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,997
It's true
that we considered scouting Kang Minjae.

232
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:14,001
But he was the one
who approached us first.

233
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,377
He did?

234
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,838
What the… How do I turn this off?

235
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,132
-Help me.
-Push that button.

236
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:21,759
It's off. Go on.

237
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,178
He wanted to leave JMT.

238
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,430
He thought he'd find
more opportunities abroad,

239
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,015
with streaming platforms and stuff.

240
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:30,476
So you were actually interested
in scouting him.

241
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,063
We were in talks. That's about it.

242
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:38,818
But it wasn't like
he could start working overseas right away

243
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,736
because of the language barrier.

244
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,616
Right, Kang Minjae uses a burier.

245
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,744
Absolutely. He very much uses a burier.

246
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,163
I mean a language barrier.

247
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,166
Minjae couldn't speak English,

248
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,417
just like you two.

249
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,672
Still, he was a charming actor,

250
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:02,591
and I thought he was full of potential
before the incident.

251
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,302
Would he have been able
to ditch his existing contract?

252
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,806
I'm not sure if I should tell you this.

253
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,393
WISH-IT-WELL DAYCARE CENTER

254
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:15,062
Kang Minjae would've faced a hefty penalty

255
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,647
if he breached his contract with JMT.

256
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:20,609
To avoid this,
he was digging up dirt on Mr. Jang.

257
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,279
He hoped to find evidence
of embezzlement or dual contracts

258
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,114
so he could leave the company.

259
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,700
The so-called brothers
were digging up dirt on each other.

260
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,410
So two-faced.

261
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,288
No, that's wrong.

262
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,164
It's four-faced.

263
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,960
There are two two-faced people,
so four faces in total.

264
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,464
I can't believe him.

265
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,265
Two two-faced people,
so four faces in total.

266
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:53,726
That's hilarious.
I mean, it's simple math.

267
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,771
-What is it now?
-You're so desperate.

268
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,069
I'm back, Captain.

269
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,113
Four-faced.

270
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,990
Detective Jang, my office.

271
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,200
He just sat down though.

272
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,119
What's with him?

273
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,706
That's enough.

274
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:17,082
Hey, come here.

275
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,127
The captain is talking to Tansik again.

276
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:23,380
He seems to like working with him.

277
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,174
How was the movie?

278
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,011
Whatever.

279
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,804
What do you mean?

280
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,556
Wasn't it awkward?

281
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,058
I said it was whatever.

282
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,851
I watched the movie alone.

283
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:37,978
What about the captain?

284
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,981
He was in the restroom the whole time.

285
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:45,027
Maybe I should recommend
some laxatives to him.

286
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,947
I've never seen someone
so backed up. It's unbelievable.

287
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,782
He's backed up?

288
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,367
It took him two and a half hours.

289
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,911
It seems like a lot of us are backed up.

290
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,626
I found the taxi driver and the actor
as you requested.

291
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,711
-Nice job.
-Thank you.

292
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:03,921
- You're dismissed.
- Yes, sir.

293
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,884
Hello, Dongbang speaking.

00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,637

297
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:25,275

301
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,868
Are they the same person?

302
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:37,454
Jung Eunkyung,
Jung Eunkyung, Jung Eunkyung…

303
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,248
Is she the only one working here?

304
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,503
Are you the new captain?

305
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,213

Yes, I'm Dongbang Yubin.

308
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,427
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

309
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,303
Uh…

310
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,931
This was found inside Kang Minjae's body.

311
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,933
He must've swallowed it
right before he died.

312
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,729
It was stuck halfway down his throat.

313
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:03,939
It looks like it was a piece of paper.

314
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:05,649
A piece of paper?

315
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,988
It could be a person's name.

316
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:15,284
What could "29" and "02" mean?

317
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:17,119
Could it be a phone number?

318
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,165
Oh…

319
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,000
So that's what happened.

320
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,835
Sorry?

321
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,462
Thank you. This was very helpful.

322
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,799
Ah.

323
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:32,968
I'll come back for the evidence.

324
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:39,391
Actually, please send over the evidence
to the daycare center we're at.

325
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,476
All right.

326
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:52,821
And here I thought there was finally
someone normal on the Violent Crimes Team.

327
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,030
Did you seriously come here
on your scooter?

328
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,950
The old clunker gave out.

329
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:41,954
So I'm picking you up on this baby.

330
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:44,039
I can't ride this!

331
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,833
I'll freeze to death!

332
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,709
I almost did.

333
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,545
Hop on. It's okay.

334
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,964
This baby's faster than a car.

335
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,173
Did you eat?

336
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,341
What do you think?

337
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:57,219
Then I'll make you some instant noodles.

338
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,680
You know I make amazing noodles,
don't you?

339
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:00,848
Instant noodles again?

340
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:02,683
What about eggs?

341
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:05,060
I've already bought some for you.

342
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,438
I know you never eat
instant noodles without eggs.

343
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:10,732
- Hold on tight.
- Let's go.

344
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,986
I said let's go…

345
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:18,782
When we make it big,
the first thing we'll do is buy a van.

346
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,409
Doesn't that sound amazing?

347
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,661
We'll buy a house…

348
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,246
-and a car too!
-And a car too!

349
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:28,083
- Won't that be amazing?
- It'll be amazing!

350
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,076
Oh, Detective.

351
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,871
That was close. You scared me.

352
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:08,373
Sorry about that. Are you going somewhere?

353
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,292
I'm getting some fresh air.

354
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,585
What brings you here, anyway?

355
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,378
- I have some business with you.
- Business?

356
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:16,423
Can it wait?

357
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:17,633
It can't.

358
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,220
-I'm here to arrest you.
-I know.

359
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:25,390
Pardon?

360
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:27,976
Jang Taesik, you're under arrest

361
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,395
for the murders
of Lim Dongil and Kang Minjae.

362
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,734
On what grounds?

363
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,614
I'll explain the details on the way.

364
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,743
You have the right to remain silent--

365
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,501
Okay.

366
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:13,855
Out of the way!

367
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:22,114
What are you doing?

368
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,381
I'm sorry.

369
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,966
-Be careful.
-Okay.

370
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,049
What a convenient entrance.

371
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,759
It's a nice trail.

372
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:25,761
My goodness.

373
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,097
Damn it.

374
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,693
You've got this.

375
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,236
Go for it!

376
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,781
- Keep going!
- You can do it!

377
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:50,410
There.

378
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:57,751
Whoa!

379
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:04,966
My landing was weak.

380
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,134
There you are.

381
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,387
How did you come from that way?

382
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,471
Oh.

383
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,891
I ran up there, went over there,

384
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:16,520
and was going to go around there,
but then just came straight across.

385
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:20,190
Wait. Let's not climb any higher.

386
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:22,150
We'll have to get back down anyway.

387
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,445
Okay.

388
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:30,492
Come to think of it,
I don't understand why I ran away.

389
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:33,036
Why are you suspecting me?

390
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,456
I thought you had no reason to kill,
but you did.

391
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,666
What?

392
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,835
You found out
Kang Minjae was bullying Lim Dongil…

393
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:43,130
and that's where it all began.

394
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:45,340
After that Octopus Game
or Hagfish Game

395
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:48,218
or whatever it is blew up,
Kang Minjae became a big deal.

396
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:49,761
He wanted to leave JMT.

397
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:52,347
It's true
that we considered scouting Kang Minjae.

398
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:55,183
But he was the one
who approached us first.

399
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,435
You started this.

400
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:58,770
Seriously?

401
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,272
If you were to kill Lim Dongil

402
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:02,732
and tell the press that it was suicide,

403
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:06,361
Kang Minjae would be accused of bullying
and hit rock bottom.

404
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:08,363
Are you crazy?

405
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:12,534
You're telling me to eat this crap now?

406
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,369
How the hell did this get out?

407
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:17,497
You probably figured that no agency
would want Kang Minjae then.

408
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,167
That was the only way for you to keep him.

409
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,545
As for the puffer fish poison,

410
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,255
the idea must've come from the series

411
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:26,673
- one of your actors was in.
- He said,

412
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:29,634
"I put a ton of puffer fish blood,
so she'll drop dead soon."

413
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,429
The defendant murdered his wife
with puffer fish poison.

414
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,682
And he disguised it as a suicide!

415
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:36,892
How does that make any sense?

416
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:40,437
I was the last person
who wanted Minjae to go down.

417
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,981
You would've been hit hard
at first, for sure.

418
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:44,816
But things would've blown over with time.

419
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,027
You're being delusional.

420
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,778
I've got a rock-solid alibi.

421
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:52,782
I attended the VIP screening
at the movie theater.

422
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:56,244
It's true you went there,
but you didn't watch the movie.

423
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,955
The final beach scene was incredible,
wasn't it?

424
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,124
Yes, I guess.

425
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,168
I haven't watched that movie.

426
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:06,588
Nor have you.

427
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,007
VIP SCREENING

428
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,343
PIECES OF FRIENDSHIP

429
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,263
Excuse me.

430
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:19,768
You left the theater
as soon as the movie began.

431
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,020
START

432
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:46,503
You hurried somewhere
while your double watched the movie.

433
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,464
- Take me to this address, please.
- Okay.

434
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:58,390
15 MINUTES PASSED

435
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:09,067
Who is it?

436
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:14,906
You barged into Dongil's place
by making up some excuses.

437
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:19,077
After all,
not many people can turn away their boss.

438
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:23,373
45 MINUTES PASSED

439
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,923
And you poisoned Dongil as planned.

440
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:56,072
1 HOUR AND 59 MINUTES PASSED

441
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,490
2 HOURS PASSED

442
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,578
You wanted to make it
look like a perfect suicide,

443
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,705
but you ran out of time.

444
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,964
I timed it myself.

445
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:20,305
Two and a half hours.

446
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:25,393
You must've barely made it back in time.

447
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:34,194
2 HOURS AND 25 MINUTES PASSED

448
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:39,032
I've secured the dashcam footage
from the taxi you were in

449
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:41,284
as well as the driver's testimony.

450
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:44,496
I even got hold of the stand-in
who watched the movie instead of you.

451
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,289
Cut the bullshit.

452
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:48,708
That one was easy to solve, ah…

453
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,627
but not the Kang Minjae case.

454
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,546
Kang Minjae would've faced a hefty penalty

455
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,131
if he breached his contract with JMT.

456
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:57,217
To avoid this,

457
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,219
he was digging up dirt on Mr. Jang.

458
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:05,308
Kang Minjae
would've snuck into your office

459
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,769
to find dirt on you
in order to nullify his contract.

460
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:10,689
This bastard's been pocketing bribes
left and right.

461
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,319
Jeez, that scared me.

462
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:18,738
What the hell?

463
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:23,201
That's when he stumbled upon
some evidence related to the murder.

464
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:27,414
And he found out
you were involved in Lim Dongil's death.

465
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:30,375
Yujeong Lake Apartments, Unit 302
8 Daerim-ro 29ga-gil, Songwon-gu, Seoul

466
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:35,171
Calm down. What are you talking about?

467
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,798
Why would I do that? Am I crazy?

468
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:38,675
Also, I haven't taken any bribes!

469
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:40,885
Forget it.

470
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,596
I'll come over right now, so hang tight.

471
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,641
If I did go to Kang Minjae's place,
how come I wasn't caught on CCTVs?

472
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,185
Do you know
how many cameras are around there?

473
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,603
Delivery.

474
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,361
Delivery.

475
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:09,664
No one recognized you
because you were wearing a helmet,

476
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,709
especially since it was raining that day.

477
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,965
What's with the getup?

478
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:20,925
I was feeling nostalgic.

479
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:24,512
So I hopped on my motorbike,
but it started raining.

480
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,235
Have you lost your mind?

481
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,029
How could you
even think of killing Dongil?

482
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,323
What the hell are you talking about?

483
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:44,991
What's with you these days?

484
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,284
Shut up.

485
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,411
I can't believe
I considered you a brother.

486
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:53,750
Look, this is Dongil's home address.

487
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:56,461
I found it in your office
on the day of the incident.

488
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:59,672
Why would you hold on
to a roadie's home address?

489
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,635
Did you think
I wouldn't figure out your tricks?

490
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,891
Were you trying to get me canceled?

491
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,769
You're the one who told the press, right?

492
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:14,646
Give me that.

493
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:16,231
Why should I? This is evidence.

494
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,607
Give me that right now!

495
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,568
I should never have gotten involved
with scum like you.

496
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:26,324
Hey, watch what you say.

497
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:29,369
Do you have any idea
what I went through to make you a star?

498
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:31,996
I hustled until my feet were sore

499
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,289
and bent over backward,

500
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,041
sucking up to people
until my back gave out!

501
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:39,212
I bet my life on you, and what?

502
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,258
Now that you've made it,
you want to ditch my company?

503
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:47,595
Who do you think
got you to where you are now?

504
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,264
You're just a parasite.

505
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:55,812
Listen.

506
00:30:56,938 --> 00:31:00,108
Apart from all the money you pocketed…

507
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,278
by mooching off of me,

508
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:06,573
is there anything
you achieved on your own?

509
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,369
It's time for you…

510
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:14,706
to pay for what you've done,

511
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,209
you dirty scumbag.

512
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,839
Scum like you

513
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,592
should be completely isolated
from society.

514
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:56,539
You brought this upon yourself.

515
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,708
It's all your fault.

516
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,331
This was found inside Kang Minjae's body.

517
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,501
Do you recognize the handwriting?

518
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:43,086
I did right away.

519
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:51,219
Luckily, Mr. Kang didn't digest all of it.

520
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:55,473
Once we process it,
we'll find your DNA all over it.

521
00:32:57,433 --> 00:33:00,019
I was going to run away to China anyway.

522
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,439
It wouldn't make any difference…

523
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,442
if I killed you too.

524
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,237
Goodness, that's a knife.

525
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,823
Too bad. I'm a detective.

526
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:14,075
We're the only people allowed to carry…
Where's my gun?

527
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:16,577
Where did it go?

528
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,622
Hold on.

529
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:22,041
People are looking.
Let's talk this out.

530
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,335
You little…

531
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:38,391
Are you okay, Captain?

532
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:39,642
Detective Moo?

533
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:41,269
Take a little break.

534
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:49,861
You should've talked this out
while you could.

535
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:52,113
Do you know
what kind of people I hate the most?

536
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:54,657
Get out of the way,
or I'll kill you, goddammit!

537
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:59,579
Don't mind us, everyone.
Have fun.

538
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:00,705
-Thanks.
-All right.

539
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,751
Fine, you can swear and take out a knife
when you're cornered.

540
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:05,877
That's all understandable.

541
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:11,132
But I can't forgive punks
who run away to high places. Why?

542
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,760
I even gave up on my pension
to skip running.

543
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:15,553
What are you babbling about?

544
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:17,513
-Three.
-Three?

545
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:18,848
Three.

546
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:20,558
Three?

547
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:24,062
Three.

548
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:41,829
Bring it on.

549
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:00,014
Are you shooting a movie?

550
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:02,100
-No, it's real.
-It's real.

551
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:07,021
You're so good.
Are you shooting a TV show?

552
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,023
- It's real.
- It's real.

553
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:13,528
-What are they doing?
-They're good.

554
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:14,862
Are they shooting a movie?

555
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,281
-Is this real?
-It's real.

556
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:27,875
Come here.

557
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:40,429
Goodbye.

558
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,233
Nice job!

559
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:57,488
Wow.

560
00:35:58,614 --> 00:35:59,615
How did you find me?

561
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,660
Just a hunch. A good one.

562
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:08,207
We'll hand him over.

563
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,878
Hey, let me ask you one last time.

564
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:14,255
Do you really not remember anything
about that day?

565
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,465
I'm sorry.

566
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:19,677
Oh.

567
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,972
-What is it?
-When I was leaving Dongil's place,

568
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:24,849
I saw a man getting out of a taxi.

569
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:30,062
He seemed somewhat out of place.

570
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:31,314
Can you make a sketch?

571
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:36,402
Even Hana could make a better sketch
with her feet.

572
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:38,279
I got excited for nothing.

573
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,740
Wait, this looks familiar.

574
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:45,244
It's Mr. Jang.

575
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:46,954
It's definitely him.

576
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:50,833
Seonhwa, this is Detective Moo.

577
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,593
What kind of detective loses his gun?

578
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:02,929
What are you, Handel and Grengel?

579
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:05,556
"Handel and Grengel"?

580
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,641

COLLECTED BY THE BROTHERS GRIMM

584
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,402
Let's go.

585
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:32,208
Are you okay, sir?

586
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:36,545
I heard the perp swung a knife at you.
Are you okay?

587
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:37,880
Yes, I'm fine.

588
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:40,549
I feel hurt. Is no one worried about me?

589
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,052
I'd be more worried about the perp.

590
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,054
Of course, you were on the national team.

591
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:46,931
The national team?

592
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:48,307
Were you on the national team?

593
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,685
Stop it. That was a long time ago.

594
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,812
It's no big deal.

595
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,772
Oh, you didn't know, Captain?

596
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:57,525
Detective Moo
was on the national boxing team.

597
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,735
The KO King of Athens.

598
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,320
Was he KO'd a lot?

599
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:03,698
Is that really what you think?

600
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:06,742
Moo Joongryeok the KO King,
who won a gold medal in Athens

601
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:11,622
by winning every match by knockout,
was you?

602
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:15,543
Yeah, yeah, that's me!

603
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,962
- Come on!
- Oh, my goodness.

604
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,339
I'm the only Moo Joongryeok in the world.

605
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:23,718
I'm sorry. I'm not that into boxing.

606
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,764
The whole nation
was rooting for him back then.

607
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,057
I only watch soccer.

608
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,684
Enough about boxing.

609
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,311
Who watches boxing these days anyway?

610
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:36,147
Everyone watches soccer
and roots for Son Heungmin and Lee Kangin.

611
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,357
By the way, I want to ask a question.

612
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:41,110
-Don't.
-Why is Mr. Jang the culprit?

613
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,904
I'm tired. Start the car.

614
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:46,991
- Let's go.
- Okay.

615
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:13,976
Hey, rookie!

616
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,895
You can't doze off!

617
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:18,272
- I'm sorry, sir!
- For crying out loud!

618
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:38,209
-Wash up first.
-I did.

619
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:40,753
-When?
-This morning.

620
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:09,407
KIM SEONHWA, JMT SECRETARY

621
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:18,499

622
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,084
Daddy!

623
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:23,045
-He brought fried chicken!
-Fried chicken!

624
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:25,673
-Chicken!
-Chicken!

625
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,008
Long day?

626
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,135
I'm fine.

627
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:30,970
The kids…

628
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:32,346
- I'll open it!
- Give it to me!

629
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,098
- Daddy will open the sauce!
- No, I'll do it!

630
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:35,349
No!

631
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:44,358
HEALTHY POOPS

632
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,570
Dear Captain Dongbang Yubin.

633
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:50,406
This should work wonders
when you're backed up.

634
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:53,409
It was hard to come by.
Wishing you good health. Salute.

635
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:56,745
From Jung Junghwan, your loyal ally.

636
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:57,830
Oh.

637
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:01,208
I didn't know I was backed up.

MOVIE STAR'S TRAGIC DEATH REINVESTIGATED

639
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:06,547
Look at him.

640
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:11,051
Working in the field seems to suit him
better than I thought.

641
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:12,428
Mmm.

642
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:13,512
Then again…

643
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:17,308
he should be burning with passion
at his age.

644
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:22,188
That's hot!

645
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:28,152
I spilled it everywhere.

646
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:54,803
{\an8}THE LATE LIM DONGIL

647
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,567
The whole country
is talking about this case.

648
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,153
But how come it's so quiet here?

649
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,489
How ironic.

650
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:20,704
How did you know
Dongil liked coffee-flavored milk?

651
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:24,124
I went through his credit card statements,

652
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,126
and he spent
less than 10,000 won on food a day.

653
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:30,798
He lived on lunch boxes and noodles
from the convenience store.

654
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:33,759
But he would enjoy
a small carton of coffee milk every day.

655
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:39,807
Did you know coffee milk contains
more caffeine than coffee?

656
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,434
Actually, coffee milk

657
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:44,812
has about 20% more caffeine
than an Americano…

658
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:47,648
What's wrong?

659
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:52,653
I was just thinking that you really seem
to love explaining things.

660
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:55,990
Oh.

661
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:58,450
Mm.

662
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:07,960
But seriously, will there be
a team dinner any time soon?

663
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:12,923
Ever since you joined, we've been too busy
with the case to have a team dinner.

664
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:16,260
Let's do it.
I'll treat you guys to some nice food.

665
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:18,304
-Tell me what you want to eat.
-I want beef.

666
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:19,430
You want what?

667
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:22,474
I don't need anything else.
All I need is beef.

668
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,977
-So you like beef.
-Yes.

669
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,228
-What do you say?
-Sure.

670
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:27,438
Yeah.

671
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:29,398
Captain.

672
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:32,568
What do you think of our team?

673
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:36,155
Well…

674
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:39,992
You guys aren't exactly invincible.

675
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:45,456
I agree we're quite far from invincible.

676
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:46,540
I admit it.

677
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:48,542
Still…

678
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:52,129
there's something charming about you all.

679
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:55,049
Charming?

680
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,550
Yes.

681
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,303
That's interesting.

682
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,513
But we're the Violent Crimes…
