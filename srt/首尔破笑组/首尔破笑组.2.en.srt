{\an8}SEOUL BUSTERS

2
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:47,756
{\an8}They sell everything
at convenience stores these days.

3
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:50,633
The high schoolers
over there are eating a lot.

4
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:55,472
Come on. You just ate.

5
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:59,100
Not reporting this to the captain…

6
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,771
I feel a bit uneasy.
Wouldn't it be better to report this?

7
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:04,022
Report what?

8
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:07,942
If we catch him, he'll just thank us.

9
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:11,529
But what are you doing? We're at work.

10
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:14,282
I'm working.
I'm being very productive, you know.

11
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:16,367
-Goodness.
-See? Look.

12
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,080
If I log in every day, I get points.

13
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,665
-And I can cash out the points later.
-Is that so?

14
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,709
Sometimes it hits big, like a lottery.

15
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,544
Lottery, my foot…

16
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,254
They say,
"Many drops make a mighty ocean."

17
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,840
Keep collecting forever.
Those drops will stay drops.

18
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,592
You underestimate the power of drops.

19
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:33,802
Nice!

20
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:34,928
-What happened?
-I hit it big.

21
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:36,721
-How much?
-60 won.

22
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,517
What am I going to do with you?

23
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,060
I earned 280 won today.

24
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:43,978
-It'll take you 300 years.
-You're so negative.

25
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,855
You're way too positive.

26
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:49,109
I'm going to get some shut-eye.
Keep your eye on things.

27
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:50,610
And stop playing games.

28
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:51,861
I said I'm working!

29
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,948
Whatever, forget it.

30
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,286
Joongryeok.

31
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,373
Joongryeok.

32
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,667
-What happened?
-Look over there.

33
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,794
- Where?
- His physique seems to match perfectly,

34
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:09,212
but I can't confirm the face.

35
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:10,964
Who? Him?

36
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:12,715
Yes, to the left.

37
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,893
Something wrong?

38
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,229
- Sorry, but I need to check this.
- What? Why?

39
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,398
- It'll only take a moment.
- Why?

40
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:29,774
Just give us a second.

41
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,609
- It won't take long.
- What are you doing?

42
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:32,944
Who are you guys?

43
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,784
-It's not him.
-We're sorry.

44
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,119
You can click this.

45
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,539
What was that?

46
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,427
What's up?

47
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,929
I have a hunch about that guy just now.

48
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,307
Him? He didn't have a package though.

49
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,558
Inside his bag.

50
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,687
Isn't it strange
for someone to go into a store

51
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,939
and not look at the items, but at us?

52
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,570
I think we have our man.

53
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:18,531
Minsik,

54
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,742
if you're done picking items,
come with us for a while.

55
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,162
We're from the Songwon Police.
We need to talk.

56
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:47,268
Don't you dare come closer.
I'll zap you all with this!

57
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,561
That's not even charged.

58
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,233
You should charge these things beforehand.

59
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,276
Hey, hey, hey!

60
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,070
- Don't do it. We told you!
- Don't!

61
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,947
Wait! Don't do it!

62
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,531
Calm down!

63
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,242
I told you. Don't do it.

64
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,993
I said don't do it. Don't you dare.

65
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,453
Calm down!

66
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,155
An Sungil, get up!

67
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,032
You need to go see your mother.

68
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,034
You need to go home!

69
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:48,663
Get up! Get up!

70
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,250
Medic!

71
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:03,970
Can you hear me?

72
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,805
Requesting backup! Requesting backup!

73
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:19,110
♪ We are safeguarding ♪

74
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:22,655

75
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,115
Hey! Junghwan!

76
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:26,200
Platoon Leader Moo, take cover!

77
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,410
Get a hold of yourself!

78
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,746
Our soldiers are down, sir!

79
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,831
Come back to your senses!

80
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,167
Hey!

81
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,835
-Are you okay?
-Joongryeok.

82
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,670
Hey. Are you okay?

83
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,343
Huh?

84
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,811
Hey.

85
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,396
What's wrong with you?

86
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:56,856
What was that?

87
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,611
Hands up!

88
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:10,244
SEOUL BUSTERS

89
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,579
WELCOME

90
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:13,873
What is this place?

91
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:17,210
Ouch, it pinched my skin.

92
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:18,795
He seemed incredibly suspicious,

93
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,671
so we made an emergency arrest.

94
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,549
We intended to report to you,
but I thought we should catch him first.

95
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:26,886
I'm not sure what seems suspicious.

96
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:29,514
He visited the house of Lim Dongil
on the day of the incident.

97
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:30,765
Not at the time of death.

98
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,725
He's also a known con artist.

99
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,143
Not the same case.

100
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:38,189
Anyway, what I'm saying is
I have a hunch about him.

101
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:39,649
There's definitely something fishy.

102
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:42,235
My hunch is telling me that.

103
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:50,785
Who are you?

104
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,495
The laptop.

105
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,372
- Who are you?
- The laptop!

106
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:55,957
I said who are you?

107
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,460
My laptop!

108
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,379
Why are you yelling?

109
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,842
How did you get
to know Lim Dongil?

110
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,597
It was through
my ex-girlfriend's sister's boyfriend.

111
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,643
Dongil's ex-girlfriend
used to work part-time with him,

112
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:19,439
so we met up a few times
and got to know each other that way.

113
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,731
Why is it so complicated?

114
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:25,820
Anyway, your… girlfriend…

115
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:29,824
and Lim Dongil's… girlfriend…

116
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:31,242
-No, no.
-What?

117
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:33,077
It was my ex-girlfriend's
sister's boyfriend…

118
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,037
-Ah.
-…and Dongil's ex-girlfriend.

119
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,374
-Your… ex-girlfriend?
-Mm-hmm.

120
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,586
Anyway, why did you go
to Lim Dongil's house that day?

121
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:44,881
-To hang out.
-When did you hear about the incident?

122
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:48,968
My girlfriend's ex-boyfriend
and I are really close friends,

123
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:52,555
and he told me to come visit him
after he moved to Busan.

124
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,307
This is so complicated.

125
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,476
Dongil's ex-girlfriend was notified

126
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,478
and sent my girlfriend a message.

127
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:02,231
So, the victim's…

128
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,942
ex-girlfriend… right?

129
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:08,029
She contacted your girlfriend…

130
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,741
…sending her a message…

131
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:15,786
That's "message" spelled with an "m."

132
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,915
No, not that one.
The one under your middle finger.

133
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,083
-Yes, that one.
-You punk!

134
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,211
Sit up straight.

135
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:26,756
Message…

136
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,092
Here, you type it.

137
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,970
Don't miss
a single word, got it?

138
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,889
-Me?
-Type!

139
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,140
Okay.

140
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,809
There are a lot of typos.

141
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,895
But you didn't show your face
after your friend died.

142
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,146
What were you doing?

143
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,691
"But you didn't show your face
after your friend died."

144
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,360
"What were you doing?"

145
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,070
Am I the one answering?

146
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,530
What are you doing?

147
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,240
Are you interrogating me now?

148
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,659
Sorry. It's just that while typing--

149
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:58,037
So what were you doing
after hearing about Lim Dongil?

150
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,413
Well, I was devastated,

151
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:02,708
but I had a lot on my plate.

152
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,586
"A lot on your plate"?
Like scamming with secondhand sales?

153
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:09,590
You must be nuts. Good grief.

154
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,553
Do I also write "nuts"?

155
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:14,762
-Should I leave it out?
-You should.

156
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,180
-Leave it out.
-Okay.

157
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,765
Without "nuts."

158
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,392
Did you notice anything unusual
about Lim Dongil?

159
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:20,518
Not really…

160
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:24,397
But he was really stressed about work.

161
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,316
He kept saying he'd quit everything
and move down to Cheongju…

162
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,610
-So I…
-So you what?

163
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,779
…told him if he moved to Cheongju…

164
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,034
…that I'd like to borrow his place
for a while.

165
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:40,496
I'm behind on my rent.

166
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,375
You're not a friend.
You're a complete freebie.

167
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,877
Not freebie. Freeloader.

168
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:49,046
-Right. Write down "freeloader."
-Okay.

169
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,842
Don't correct me!

170
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,343
You little freeloader!

171
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,059
So, it seems like
it was suicide, right?

172
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,103
Seems like it.

173
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,230
Jeon Minsik's alibi is solid too.

174
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,774
It seems Lim Dongil
was severely bullied by Kang Minjae.

175
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,777
I never imagined Kang Minjae
would be like that. How vile.

176
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,905
Minseo, don't fall for a man
just based on how he looks.

177
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,283
The ones with pretty faces
are even more dangerous.

178
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,035
Someone who looks like me
is just about right.

179
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:22,079
Hey, not all good-looking people
are bad, you know?

180
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,165
Being handsome…

181
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:26,000
…isn't a crime.

182
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,628
How ridiculous.
What makes you think you are?

183
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,087
Why are you getting angry?

184
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,964
He's not wrong.

185
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,924
Being handsome isn't a crime, after all.

186
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:37,637
Joongryeok, if being handsome was a crime,
you'd be Mother Teresa.

187
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,263
Completely innocent.

188
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,890
For goodness' sake.

189
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:43,726
Since we're all innocent here,
let's drop it.

190
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:48,064
But is Captain not eating?

191
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,690
You think he'd eat in a place like this?

192
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,651
He wouldn't come near such a dirty place.

193
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,694
You little punk.

194
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,072
If it's so dirty, why are you eating here?

195
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,907
Because the food tastes so good!

196
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,493
He doesn't even know that, like a fool.

197
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:06,290
Captain keeps saying
it might not be a suicide.

198
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,751
What does he know about the field?
All he's ever done is push papers.

199
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:09,835
Exactly.

200
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,630
Always putting on airs,
talking about studying in the States.

201
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,173
I don't care if he's the captain…

202
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:16,884
Captain! Over here.

203
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:21,889
Please have a seat.

204
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,517
- I'll have a soup with rice too.
- Okay.

205
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,355
This case has blown up in the news.

206
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,315
Seems like
some information leaked.

207
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,858
- Huh?
- Huh?

208
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,235
The news?

209
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:35,820
The remote.

210
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,656
-What's this?
-Not the shopping channel.

211
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:41,033
Not a movie!

212
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,077
Hold on. Where's the news?

213
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,161
How old-fashioned.

214
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,038
Does the news just appear
when you turn on the TV?

215
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,790
Rookie, look it up on your phone.

216
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:48,999
Yes, ma'am.

217
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,878
Another person has passed away
because of bullying in the workplace.

218
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,673
Actor Kang Minjae
verbally assaulted…

219
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,007
Where did the story leak from?

220
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,759
Has anyone met with reporters?

221
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,261
No, sir.

222
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:03,556
We've even handled snooping reporters.

223
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,641
Do you think we're new to investigations?

224
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,644
We're not amateurs.
We never discuss such matters.

225
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:14,150
Joongryeok, is that the suicide case
you were talking about?

226
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,153
When did I say that?

227
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,363
A suicide note was found
at the scene, wasn't it?

228
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,157
Even if the paper's different,

229
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,160
a note was found, and the motive is clear.

230
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,621
Seems obvious that it was a suicide.

231
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,499
There was a note.

232
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,626
- The detective has a big mouth.
- Does he?

233
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,086
That's not true!

234
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,088
Be careful with what you say.

235
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,594
It's not me, I'm telling you!

236
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,596
I never said that, Mom!

237
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,101
Who the hell was it?

238
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,228
That son of a bitch.

239
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:55,274
Wait, not this!

240
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:56,817
Hit something else. Anything else.

241
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,738
How exactly are you handling things?

242
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,824
Please calm down.

243
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,826
You expect me to calm down right now?

244
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,579
What are we going to do?

245
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,080
What are we supposed to do now?

246
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,833
I've called some reporters I know.
Let's issue a correction.

247
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:16,545
I also have contacts in the police.

248
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:25,971
-Is it really here?
-Well…

249
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,098
-What are they, the KGB? FBI?
-Over there.

250
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,725
-Are they undercover?
-It says over there.

251
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:30,893
Are we in the wrong place?

252
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,812
We went
to the wrong place last time too.

253
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,607
Captain! Captain Dongbang!

254
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,193
- Captain!
- A word, please!

255
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,277
Sir!

256
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,074
Detective Seo…

257
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,701
A comment, please!

258
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:48,953
A word!

259
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,832
Give us a comment, please!

260
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,918
He's over there!

261
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,002
- Over there!
- Me?

262
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,504
- He's over there!
- Over there!

263
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,089
- There he is!
- Go!

264
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,966
He's over there!

265
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:04,593
Get him!

266
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:09,390
-Please wait!
-We have a question!

267
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,814
- Excuse me!
- A word, please!

268
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:18,607
-Say something!
-Please!

269
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,067
Don't you have anything to say?

270
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,152
Wait, hold on, wait, stop--

271
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,626
The journalists
still aren't leaving.

272
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,671
Even if it's concluded as suicide,

273
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:44,633
Kang Minjae or whatever his name is
won't be appearing on TV for a while.

274
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,260
The negative comments are no joke.

275
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:49,430
It'll be a big loss for him
if he loses sponsorships.

276
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:53,183
People are incredibly sensitive
about bullying and abuse of power.

277
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,895
The press is making a huge fuss.

278
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,813
It's clearly a suicide.

279
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,774
Why does the captain
keep drawing this out?

280
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,860
From what I can see,

281
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:04,904
the captain is a huge attention seeker.

282
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,655
We're just suffering

283
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,366
because he wants
to ride the wave of attention.

284
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:11,869
The autopsy results are out.

285
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:13,996
-Where's the captain?
-In his office.

286
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,335
He just has to make
a big deal out of everything.

287
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:22,504
Captain.

288
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,091
Captain?

289
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,530
Violent Crimes Team 2 Captain

290
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:55,204
The captain is Detective Conan?

291
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,331
What? What did he say?

292
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:59,458
Well, it's just that he…

293
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,044
Are you sure he's inside his office?

294
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,463
He is. I just told you.

295
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:05,589
Give it to me. I'll do it.

296
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,967
Seriously?

297
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,599
Could it be

298
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,309
that Detective Conan is real?

299
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,311
What's wrong with you?

300
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,814
If somehow the captain…

301
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,652
became a kid like Detective Conan--

302
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,070
Are you talking about me?

303
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,117
Captain,
weren't you in the office?

304
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,785
I just went
to the bathroom upstairs.

305
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:36,620
There's a kid in there.

306
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,247
His mom left him here again.

307
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,251
People think we'll look after their kids
because of you!

308
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:46,380
Whoa! Nice catch.

309
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,174
Uh, did the autopsy results come in?

310
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,259
Yes, sir.

311
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,180
What did the
National Forensic Service say?

312
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:57,891
AUTOPSY REPORT

313
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,019
-It's a suicide, right?
-It's a homicide.

314
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:06,316
As of now, the Lim Dongil case
has become a murder case.

315
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,573
-Let's go!
-Let's…

316
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,245
You were going to go? Go ahead.

317
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,461
- Hello, Eunkyung.
- Detective Moo.

318
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,838
Do you have something against us?

319
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:31,383
Why would you send Detective Jang?

320
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,468
Sorry?

321
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,720
What about Detective Jang?

322
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:38,390
{\an8}NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

323
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,853
- Hello.
- You're here.

324
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,104
I got the autopsy results.

325
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:47,149
It was urgent, so I expedited it a bit.

326
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,610
Oh, um… Thank you, ma'am.

327
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:54,531
The size of the heart
is larger than usual.

328
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,366
It's quite heavy too.

329
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,747
This case was no walk in the park.

330
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,207
Charcoal briquettes
were at the scene, right?

331
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,750
- Yes.
- But the cause of death

332
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,335
wasn't carbon monoxide poisoning.

333
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,419
Oh.

334
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:10,672
We considered the possibility
of poison but found nothing.

335
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,805
There was a case
in the early 2000s

336
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:21,517
where two friends going to play golf died
on the side of the highway.

337
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,937
No signs of homicide or poison.

338
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,563
Similar to this case, isn't it?

339
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:27,981
It is.

340
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,317
I guess
he didn't eat for a while.

341
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:31,610
No trace…

342
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,738
of food particles.

343
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,490
Where was I again?

344
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,371
- Right, the two dead friends.
- The two dead friends.

345
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,623
There were traces
of sleeping pills in one person,

346
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:45,958
but not lethal amounts.

347
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,084
Not lethal.

348
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,460
The National Forensic Service

349
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,129
conducted over 500 tests
for drugs and poisons…

350
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,964
…but nothing matched.

351
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,549
It turned out to be a biological toxin.

352
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,384
A natural poison.

353
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,593
A natural poison.

354
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,387
Curious, aren't you?

355
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,680
About what the answer is?

356
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,306
Tetrodotoxin.

357
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,767
It was puffer fish poison.

358
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,938
In this case, even if we don't know
who the criminal is,

359
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:09,773
they were quite clever.

360
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,693
They used a natural poison
to make it look like a suicide,

361
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:15,070
but they probably didn't know
how powerful it was.

362
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,741
They tried to make it
look like it was the briquettes,

363
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,285
but the victim was already dead

364
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,203
and not breathing.

365
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,004
What do you think?
I'm pretty amazing, aren't I?

366
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,922
Don't you have anything to say to me?

367
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:35,924
Ugh!

368
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,134
Ugh?

369
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,218
- Ugh?
- Ugh?

370
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,804
Ugh?

371
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,785
What did you eat so much of?

372
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,586
All right, I'm sorry.

373
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,346
Detective Moo,
the meeting is starting now.

374
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:23,931
Please hurry.

375
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,226
Let's think about why I did that

376
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:31,897
There's nobody to consider a suspect.

377
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,149
Why are his personal connections
so limited?

378
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,068
There weren't any
insurance payouts, were there?

379
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,945
Not even private health insurance.

380
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,196
Only public health insurance.

381
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,614
What about--

382
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:43,367
Didn't I tell you not to speak
when you're in the thinking chair?

383
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,826
Go ahead.

384
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:50,207
I thought of a different approach.

385
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,917
Unanswered Questions

386
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,212
Some Unanswered Questions

387
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,381
Perhaps the culprit

388
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,841
isn't someone he knew--

389
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,678
What's there not to know?
You're the only one in the dark here.

390
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,721
There were no signs of forced entry

391
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:06,682
or signs of struggle.

392
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:07,891
Do you think a random robber

393
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,519
brought charcoal briquettes
and puffer fish poison?

394
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,272
It could have been
a very well-prepared robber--

395
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:17,317
There was nothing taken
and no signs of the place being searched.

396
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:22,030
What if it was an honest thief
who doesn't steal others' belongings?

397
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,032
-Back to your spot.
-Back to my spot.

398
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,328
Let's stop here for now.

399
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:33,709
Make sure the investigation details
don't leak to the public.

400
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,211
And avoid contact
with reporters for a while.

401
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,588
-Got it, Detective Moo?
-Yes, I got…

402
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,221
Why only me?

403
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:10,704
DIRTY DISHES

404
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:14,041
CLEAN CUPS

405
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,468
SHELF NOT AGAINST THE WALL

406
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:32,267
TRACES OF CHARCOAL BRIQUETTES

407
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:38,940
There's no other entrance
to the house.

408
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,069
Then through the front door?

409
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:53,747
Who is it?

410
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,211
The doorbell rings.

411
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,923
And there's an unexpected guest.

412
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,345
He had to let them in,
even though he didn't want to.

413
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:10,889
And then…

414
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:33,161
They created an opportunity to strike.

415
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:10,866
They tried to drag the unconscious
Lim Dongil into the room…

416
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:15,579
then stopped.

417
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,040
Why?

418
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,293
Why though?

419
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:24,337
Out of a petty sense of guilt?

420
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,840
If not…

421
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:29,843
then why?

422
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,640
Wish-It-Well Daycare Center
We are not a daycare!

423
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:05,253
This is fun.

424
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,756
This thing can go fast.

425
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,466
Giddy up! Giddy up!

426
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:11,343
Let's go!

427
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:13,762
Detective Seo, what are you doing there?

428
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,140
- Well, I was--
- Waiting for a taxi, I see.

429
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,600
You were alternating
between looking at the road

430
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:19,684
and your phone.

431
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,228
-Are you going somewhere?
-To Cheong--

432
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:23,647
Heading to Cheongju?
To Lim Dongil's place?

433
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:26,483
If you're going to answer
your own questions,

434
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:27,984
why bother asking?

435
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,945
Right. I'm sorry.

436
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,405
Lim Dongil's funeral is tomorrow.

437
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:35,116
I thought it would be better
to inform them directly

438
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,743
since the nature of the case has changed.

439
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:37,827
Why do you ask?

440
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:40,372
Let's go together in my car. Hop in.

441
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:48,004
I feel even more troubled now.

442
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:53,635
What?

443
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:56,346
For someone feeling troubled,
you seem to be eating quite well.

444
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,431
This is my first meal of the day.

445
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,685
Thinking about Lim Dongil makes me so sad.

446
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,396
He came to Seoul all by himself
at a young age

447
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:06,773
without any friends
in order to find his path.

448
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:08,066
Detective Seo.

449
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,151
When dealing with cases,

450
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,237
try to detach your emotions
as much as possible.

451
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,615
Sometimes, bad guys are innocent,
and good guys are guilty.

452
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,535
When a person catches a tiger,
it's called hunting,

453
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:20,662
but when a tiger catches a person,
it's a disaster.

454
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:23,164
The perspective changes
the nature of the situation.

455
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:26,251
Captain, you know what?

456
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,587
-What?
-Never mind.

457
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,046
Go ahead.

458
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:31,673
Well, it's just…

459
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,385
You sounded a bit like
a know-it-all just now.

460
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:36,511
A know-it-all?

461
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:39,514
But you do have a lot of knowledge,

462
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,141
so you probably have a lot to explain.

463
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:42,809
I completely understand.

464
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,769
I've never heard that before.

465
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,229
It's quite refreshing.

466
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:51,151
Hey, Joongryeok.

467
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:53,278
I'm currently on my way
to Cheongju with the captain.

468
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,030
What's that?

469
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,532
Okay, we'll turn the car around
and go to you.

470
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:58,617
What's going on?

471
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:02,037
Kang Minjae jumped to his death.

472
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,172
We're the police. Excuse me, please.

473
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:14,674
Minjae!

474
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,509
Did you check the body?

475
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,803
Take him to the NFS.

476
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,221
My Minjae!

477
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:26,311
Out of my way!

478
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:27,520
What's going on?

479
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,230
What are you doing? Stop them!

480
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,316
Tansik, where are you going?

481
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:32,567
Where are you going?

482
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,737
Detective Moo!

483
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,202
Just go.

484
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:52,462
SHIT WELL DAYCARE CENTER

485
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:54,881
Dinner is served.

486
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,883
- Nice.
- Let's eat while we work.

487
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:58,927
- Thank you for getting dinner.
- My burger!

488
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,136
Just a second.

489
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,346
Double patty, double cheese.

490
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:02,764
- Yes, I double-checked.
- Tansik.

491
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,766
-Put mine on my desk.
-You got it.

492
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,142
Come here, my burger!

493
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:09,020
My burger!

494
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,230
Oh, my baby!

495
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:11,439
- Here you go, sir.
- Thank you.

496
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:16,111
Hey, what's this?

497
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,904
How many times do I have to tell you?

498
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:19,322
I hate onions.

499
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:20,949
Are you doing this on purpose?

500
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,659
Not at all, sir. It just slipped my mind--

501
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:24,828
My hand might just slip into a fist.

502
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,287
I'm not eating this.

503
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:30,500
Just eat it as is. How annoying.

504
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:32,711
It's connected now.

505
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:37,716
Are you crazy?
You're telling me to eat this crap now?

506
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,260
Are you brainless?
Don't you know I'm working out?

507
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,680
- It's stressful enough to stick to a diet.
- Wow.

508
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:46,349
Who the hell hired an idiot like you?

509
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,977
They should really be fired.

510
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:53,565
This is the abuse video
that was spread online last night.

511
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:56,317
Can you believe that guy?

512
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,080
I'm sorry, Tansik.

513
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:11,416
-Please eat.
-Thank you, I will.

514
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:16,379
The video started circulating
online around 11 p.m. last night,

515
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:19,257
and Kang Minjae committed suicide
at around 3 a.m. on the same day.

516
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,552
Gosh, they say you never know
what will happen in life.

517
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:24,304
He really did fall, just like his image.

518
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:26,431
This is where Kang Minjae lived.

519
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:29,726
The Riverside Star Forest
Central Éclatni Palace.

520
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:33,605
The Riverside Star Forest
Central Éclatni Palace?

521
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,482
Wow…

522
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:37,567
He really made it big.

523
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,152
What's so great about that place?

524
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:41,529
What's with this silence?

525
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:42,614
You don't know?

526
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:46,659
You don't know the Riverside Star Forest
Central Éclatni Palace?

527
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:50,997
{\an8}The Riverside Star Forest
Central Éclatni Palace!

528
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:54,334
{\an8}An exceptional choice
for a prestigious person like you!

529
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:55,960
{\an8}Dad!

530
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,046
{\an8}I love our place!

531
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,798
{\an8}"A premium life
enjoyed only by the top 1%!"

532
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:00,882
{\an8}So do I!

533
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:06,387
-What is it?
-How should I know?

534
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:10,099
How does no one know
this famous landmark in Korea?

535
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,518
Here we go again.

536
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:12,852
It's the most expensive place
on the market.

537
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:15,772
A lot of celebrities
and famous people live there.

538
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:19,317
Let's all keep up
with how the world works, shall we?

539
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,778
-Right, Captain?
-This is my first time hearing about it.

540
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:24,614
Well, it's understandable
that you don't know.

541
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:26,115
You lived in the States for a while.

542
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:28,326
It's just an apartment.

543
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:30,078
- So many condos these days.
- Don't be like him.

544
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:33,748
Anyway, this is where he lived.

545
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,917
The Riverside Star Fore…

546
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,419
Why is it so long?

547
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,463
Aren't the names getting longer

548
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:43,550
so old people living in the countryside
can't find where their children live?

549
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:45,134
Whatever.

550
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,178
Kang Minjae was living
on the 47th floor.

551
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,055
The external windows don't open,

552
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:51,808
but the 2,490-square-foot unit he lived in
had an outdoor terrace.

553
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:53,810
It seems he jumped from there.

554
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:58,147
A suicide note was posted
on his social media just before the fall.

555
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:01,359
As you can see,
it's only a few lines long.

556
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,486
Hm?

557
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,571
Excuse me for a moment.

558
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:07,323
Jeez, why are you so clumsy?

559
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:11,286
Perfect Match

560
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,037
Ms. Seo! Your 35th match is waiting!
Become a couple today!

561
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,624
Where did it go?

562
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,796
Ugh, where is it?

563
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,881
{\an8}HAPPY POOP

564
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,883
{\an8}MS. SEO! IF YOUR CONSTIPATION
PERSISTS FOR 5 DAYS, PLEASE VISIT US.

565
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,968
Oh my god.

566
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,558
Apart from the social media post,

567
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:37,437
no other notes or will
were found at the scene. That's all.

568
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,815
-What's wrong?
-Ms. Seo.

569
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,945
I mean, Detective Seo.

570
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,322
-Great work.
-Thank you.

571
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,740
I think I need to go out to the scene.

572
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:51,868
- I'll get ready to go.
- No.

573
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:55,163
-I'll go. Tansik, get ready quickly.
-Yes, sir.

574
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:57,040
-I'll go with you.
-Tansik, don't get ready.

575
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:58,583
Yes, sir.

576
00:31:58,791 --> 00:31:59,792
I'll go.

577
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,294
No.

578
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,172
Why not?

579
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:09,302
Where are you coming from?

580
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:11,971
Hello,
we're from the Songwon Police.

581
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,097
"First CCTV at the entrance"

582
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,807
- Song Wonsu?
- No, Songwon Police.

583
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,935
There's no resident by that name.

584
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,019
"Second CCTV facing the side"

585
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:19,437
It's not a name.
We're the police.

586
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,688
Please let us in.

587
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:28,988
THIRD CCTV IN THE LOBBY

588
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:33,534
UNFRIENDLY SECURITY GUARD

589
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,203
ANOTHER CCTV

590
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,872
- Captain.
- Yes?

591
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,458
I'll stop by the security office first.

592
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:41,709
Sure, please do.

593
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,754
That way.

594
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,486
SEPARATE OFFICE

595
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,113
TWO BOTTLES OF EXPENSIVE LIQUOR

596
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:14,951
LIKES TO DRINK ALCOHOL

597
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:19,080
WELL-ORGANIZED FRIDGE

598
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,541
DO NOT ENTER, POLICE LINE

599
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:26,170
UNUSED BALCONY

600
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,758
AND THE 47TH FLOOR

601
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:40,476
TWO MEN WHO LOOK VERY CLOSE

602
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:02,915
They were quite fussy,
going on about the residents' privacy.

603
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:05,710
I barely managed to get
a copy of the footage.

604
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:07,336
Thank you for your effort.

605
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:10,590
Wow.

606
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:11,966
This place is like a palace.

607
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,595
But the view
is half the value of this place.

608
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:16,971
Why'd he cover it up with curtains?

609
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,515
Kang Minjae likely had a fear of heights.

610
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,267
A fear of heights?

611
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:24,479
It seems he hardly used the balcony.

612
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:27,148
This is the lowest floor among the ones
with the same layout, right?

613
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,941
Yes, I believe so.

614
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:32,195
But why live this high up
with a fear of heights--

615
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:34,697
Do you know the only vice
that can overcome fear?

616
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,949
Let me think.

617
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:38,785
Um… gluttony?

618
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:39,911
Ah!

619
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:42,080
-Lust.
-It's greed.

620
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:44,332
Right, it's definitely greed.

621
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,793
Well, fear of heights or not,

622
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:50,171
living here would make you feel
pretty successful.

623
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,380
Makes you feel cool too.

624
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,134
Who could it be?

625
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:58,471
Captain, stay right here.
I'll take a look.

626
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,151
Coffee delivery.

627
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,320
-Coffee?
-Enjoy.

628
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:16,572
-What about payment?
-It's already been paid. Enjoy.

629
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:19,117
Captain. We got a coffee delivery…

630
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,119
I ordered that. Have one.

631
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,203
I see.

632
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:25,206
Iced Americanos are my go-to.

633
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,668
That means this is for you, right?

634
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:30,002
Yes. Thank you.

635
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:32,713
I have some things to take care of here.
You may go home.

636
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,215
I can go home?

637
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,592
And what will you do here?

638
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:39,303
Oh, it's almost time for my show to start.

639
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:40,805
I'll be late if I watch it at home.

640
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:42,849
Oh…

641
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:46,936
Then please enjoy.

642
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:48,020
Thank you.

643
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,191
How bold of him to watch TV
at a crime scene.

644
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:53,943
Is it because he lived in the States?

645
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:58,197
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

646
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,534
By the way…

647
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,870
Can I get rewards points for the coffee?

648
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:06,414
-Yes.
-Can you add them to my phone number?

649
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,832
-Sure.
-Okay.

650
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:09,542
Hold on.

651
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,086
Yes, Joongryeok.

652
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,297
Hey. I think we've found the killer.

653
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,340
Huh? Who is it?

654
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,809
Should we grab him now?

655
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:28,603
He's dead meat.

656
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,104
Get the handcuffs ready.

657
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,647
I'll go around the back.

658
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,482
Okay, go ahead.

659
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,109
There's a fly.

660
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,986
-What are you doing?
-Don't mess up.

661
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:40,281
There are so many alleys here.
We can't afford to lose him.

662
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:41,699
Got it.

663
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,452
Hey.

664
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,037
What are you doing? Turn it off!

665
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,205
-Why won't it work?
-Hey.

666
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:48,956
-What?
-No, it's this thing!

667
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,166
- Come on!
- Turn it off!

668
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:51,417
Why isn't this working? Dumb car.

669
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,669
- Stop it.
- You'll break it!

670
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,255
It broke!

671
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,882
It's okay.

672
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,177
Fixed it!

673
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:06,349
I'm sorry.

674
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:08,768
-Joongryeok.
-I fixed it.

675
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:09,852
Joongryeok.

676
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:18,861
Get him!

677
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:44,804
Out of my way!

678
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:48,266
She's running now.

679
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:56,941
Stop already!

680
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:00,778
Hey!

681
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,155
Hey! That's dangerous!

682
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,365
Come here, you…

683
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:15,626
Looking for this?

684
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,797
Stop messing around. Come here.

685
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,048
Please, just leave.

686
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,050
I can hit women and kids too.

687
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,135
I said come here.

688
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:26,512
I took kickboxing lessons.

689
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,849
Go in with the left,
then slam you with the overhand!

690
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,101
You're done for.

691
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:43,446
Detective Seo, are you okay?

692
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:44,822
What happened?

693
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,284
Why would you do that?

694
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,038
Good job.

695
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,292
What's with his eyes?

696
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:58,044
Objection!

697
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:01,922
The prosecutor is conflating
an assumption with the truth.

698
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:05,384
That message is
completely unrelated to the case.

699
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:10,181
The phrase "I might die" was used
to express how delicious something was.

700
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:13,434
This report shows
that the puffer fish guts went missing…

701
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:05,903
Hello?

702
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:07,822
Oh, shit!

703
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:08,906
Sorry?

704
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,285
What did the captain say?

705
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:15,162
Well, the captain…

706
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,247
What?

707
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:19,125
The captain said… "Shh."

708
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:20,626
What do you mean?

709
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:21,877
What exactly did he say?

710
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:24,255
Oh…

711
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,931
Oh, shit!

712
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:39,353
SEOUL BUSTERS

713
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,063
Slapping the butt

714
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,982
Yeah, let's go!

715
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,067
Let me go again.

716
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,152
Cue!

717
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:49,738
I swear I'll wring your neck!

718
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:52,491
Bawk, bawk!

719
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,078
Dizzy

720
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:59,165
These… these guys who look evil…

721
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:00,249
As you can see…

722
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:02,126
these evil-looking… guys…

723
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:03,210
I'll go again.

724
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,295
"Laughing"

725
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:06,547
These guys… What are they?

726
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,631
Hey.

727
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:08,716
"So far, so good"

728
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,217
You'll betray the country one day.

729
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:11,844
-Me?
-Yes.

730
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:13,846
-Go take a dump.
-I was about to.

731
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:15,264
Wait, really?

732
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:21,228
Showing his great acting skills

733
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,731
I'm rolling away…

734
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:27,193
The tent rolls over due to the wind…

735
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,403
Don't correct me!

736
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,779
Sit down.

737
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,907
What's your highest level of education?

738
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,450
-Art school.
-Art school?

739
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:37,453
Art school?

740
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:40,789
Hahaha

741
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,417
Taxi… driver?

742
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,002
Smash

743
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:46,086
It broke in one go…

744
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,171
Swinging

745
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:48,255
Flustered

746
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:50,925
Do a grin.

747
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,426
Smirk

748
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,303
Acting that pierces through the screen

749
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:58,766
Powerful glare
