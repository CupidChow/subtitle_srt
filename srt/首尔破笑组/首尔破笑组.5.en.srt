{\an8}EPISODE 5

3
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:50,508
Wait!

4
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:53,428
Yes?

5
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,638
Well…

6
00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:00,560
I'm not sure
if this is related to the case, but…

7
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:04,147
We only need information
relevant to the case.

8
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:07,984
Any information would be helpful.
Please go ahead.

9
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:12,447
Hyojoo's ex has been giving her
a hard time lately.

10
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:13,740
Her ex?

11
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,868
Yes, Nam Junghyun
from the physical education department.

12
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:19,287
They briefly went out last year,

13
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:23,041
but he's been harassing Hyojoo
ever since they broke up.

14
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,251
Having fun at karaoke?
Pick up your phone

15
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:31,591
He's the reason
Hyojoo took a leave of absence.

16
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:34,803
Has she reported him to the police?

17
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:37,889
The police said
there was nothing they could do.

18
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:40,975
Also, he's from a wealthy family.

19
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:44,312
You didn't actually see him that day,
did you?

20
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:45,897
No.

21
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:50,276
But I have a feeling he was nearby.

22
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,362
Is it that bastard again?

23
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,823
-Let's take a taxi together.
-Let's go.

24
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,866
No need.
We're not going in the same direction.

25
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,284
I'll get going.

26
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,744
- Be careful.
- Bye.

What do you think you're doing?

33
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:53,001
Songwon Police Station
has moved to a temporary location

34
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,127
Nam Junghyun.

35
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,171
He's in the physical education department
at the same school as Yoon Hyojoo.

36
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,965
They briefly dated,

37
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:02,719
and he's been harassing Hyojoo nonstop
since they broke up.

38
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,679
He's even been fined for stalking.

39
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,389
I bet he's the culprit.

40
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,561
Judging from the texts
he sent her that night,

41
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,022
<i>he must've been keeping tabs on her.</i>

42
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,857
Isn't it obvious?

43
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,317
We don't know for sure yet.

44
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,235
Of course not.

45
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:21,904
What about
the man from the CCTV footage?

46
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,031
I found out who he was.

47
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,408
He's Kang Sangdu,
the owner of Lucky Chicken,

48
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,910
the place across from One Shot Chicken.

49
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:31,164
They've been at odds
since day one.

50
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,415
One thing to note

51
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,752
is that he's been suspected
in three arson cases.

52
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,211
Arson?

53
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,421
There you have it.

54
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,089
No, let's not jump to conclusions.

55
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,258
No, we shouldn't.

56
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,678
Yoon Minsoo, the owner of the restaurant,

57
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,930
and Song Sanguk, the landlord,
are also suspects.

58
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,307
They both have fire insurance.

59
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,434
In the event of a fire,
Yoon Minsoo receives 300 million won,

60
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,770
<i>and Song Sanguk
receives over a billion won.</i>

61
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,938
The latter has
more than four fire insurance policies.

62
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,940
That does raise a red flag.

63
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,651
Why would he have
so many fire insurance policies?

64
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:03,988
- We've finally solved the case, sir.
- No, not yet.

65
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,907
You're right. We haven't solved it yet.

66
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,618
Ugh, this is frustrating.

67
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:10,828
Minsoo didn't do it.

68
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,664
I'm sure this stalker's the culprit.

69
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,208
That's my hunch.

70
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,085
You'll soon see I was right.

71
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:28,012
This one's a tough nut to crack.

72
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,224
A T-Rex!

73
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:32,809
I brought us some lunch!

74
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:36,813
Detective Jung!

75
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,149
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay. Take a seat.

76
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:53,371
All right!

77
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:56,082
- Let's summon all the suspects first.
- Yes, sir.

78
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:58,960
Detective Jang, schedule the interviews
and bring them in.

79
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,461
- Yes, sir.
- Let's eat.

80
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,588
- I'll eat later.
- Understood.

81
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,643
SEOUL BUSTERS

82
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,355
-Detective Seo.
-Yes?

83
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,816
- Come with me, please.
- Yes, sir.

84
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,162
BACKGROUND CHECK

85
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,499
I'd appreciate all of your cooperation.
Let's do this!

86
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,834
FIRST PLACE: YOON MINSOO

87
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,379
FIRST PLACE: YOON MINSOO

88
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,133
THE LORD DETESTS LYING LIPS,

89
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:49,552
BUT HE DELIGHTS IN PEOPLE
WHO ARE TRUSTWORTHY. PROVERBS 12:22

90
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:08,863
Why isn't this…

91
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:10,656
This is all I can offer you.

92
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,620
Sorry, there's not much to see.

93
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:16,787
Have a seat.

94
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:17,914
Okay.

95
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,666
Are you eating candy? I want some.

96
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,627
It's not candy. Don't mind me.

97
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:26,797
Thank you.

98
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,467
Did you say this could've been arson?

99
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,760
Well, yes.

100
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:34,138
Are you suggesting someone
set my restaurant on fire on purpose?

101
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,724
That's a possibility.

102
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,686
- How's Hyojoo doing?
- Sorry?

103
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,898
Oh, she's still unconscious.

104
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:48,569
But she'll come around. She's strong.

105
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,905
Our Father in heaven,

106
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,615
hallowed be your name,

107
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,283
your kingdom come…

108
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,952
She's been ill for a long time.

109
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:03,251
Mr. Yoon seems like a good person,
doesn't he?

110
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:04,627
I'm not sure.

111
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,712
Why not? I thought he seemed really kind.

112
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,464
Hmm. Maybe he is.

113
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,175
Does that mean
you think he's a good person or not?

114
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,928
I don't think people can be labeled
as simply good or bad.

115
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:17,682
Everyone is multifaceted,
just like how every coin has two sides.

116
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:20,810
Any person can act in a good or bad way,
depending on the situation.

117
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,729
I bet you're not religious.

118
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,231
I'm not. What about you?

119
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,441
I'm not either.

120
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,152
But I do think it could be helpful
in these kinds of situations.

121
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,154
Why aren't you religious?

122
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,284
-Are you familiar with Gustave Courbet?
-Not really.

123
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,160
He's a 19th-century Realist painter.

124
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,956
<i>When criticized for refusing
to paint biblical scenes, he said this.</i>

125
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,543
"Show me an angel,
and I'll paint one."

126
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,545
I feel the same way.

127
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,006
I don't believe in what can't be proven.

128
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,466
Mm-hmm. Sure, sure.

129
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:55,469
Am I being a know-it-all again?

130
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:59,932
Oh, my goodness.
Are you still brooding over that?

131
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:03,144
No, not at all.
It just suddenly came to mind.

132
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,021
Sure, sure.

133
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,898
Please don't take this personally.
I'm just curious.

134
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,693
Are you saying "sure" twice

135
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,903
to indicate sarcasm?

136
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,572
No way.

137
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,157
Mm-hmm.

138
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,075
Never mind. Forget I asked.

139
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,243
Sure, sure.

140
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,003
Gosh.

141
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:31,088
Sorry for the long wait.

142
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,965
Something urgent came up.

143
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,216
I just got here.

144
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,760
Drink this. I got one for each of us.

145
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:38,012
Oh! Thank you.

146
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,350
Mmm! I love this tea.

147
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,770
How did you know I love tea with milk?

148
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:48,439
You got your PhD in the UK.

149
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:53,027
That's right. I hate the cold.

150
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:56,447
Tea with milk was my lifesaver.

151
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,742
Here's a picture of the scene.

152
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:03,037
We've identified pour
and splash patterns.

153
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,916
It indicates that the fire started
from flammable liquid.

154
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,920
It seems someone splashed flammables
and set the fire.

155
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,005
That's the typical scenario.

156
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:17,259
Could the person who attacked Hyojoo
have started the fire too?

157
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:20,721
Maybe.

158
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,353
<i>This is the police report center.</i>

159
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,188
<i>Hello, sir.</i>

160
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,899
<i>I need help. It's urgent.</i>

161
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,609
<i>What's wrong?</i>

162
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:38,114
<i>My ex is outside the window,
holding a knife.</i>

163
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,866
<i>A knife?
He's holding a knife?</i>

164
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,202
I can't make it out clearly,

165
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,288
but it looks like one.

166
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:50,334
He's quite short-tempered.

167
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,795
<i>So please hurry here.</i>

168
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,255
<i>Okay.
What's your address?</i>

169
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:55,548
That bastard.

170
00:11:58,801 --> 00:11:59,802
TAESUNG

171
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,096
Hi, Taesung. What's up?

172
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,974
Hey, Joongryeok.
Coach Yoon's wife called me.

173
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,810
<i>Some detectives
visited them earlier</i>

174
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,187
and took Coach Yoon to the police station.

175
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,066
Okay. I'll call you back.

176
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:24,285
If you cut like that,
it'll take forever.

177
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,328
It's because he's got thick hands.

178
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,164
Will you even finish by today?

179
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,999
-Just eat this.
-My goodness.

180
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,042
I'm actually quite good with knives,

181
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,836
but I somehow get worse
whenever I come here.

182
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,087
What is he talking about?

183
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,172
Goodness.

184
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,340
-You can call me sister.
-Look at his teddy bear shirt.

185
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,551
Hello, sir.

186
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:41,677
Hi, it's me.

187
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,388
I need you to have your guys
look for a man.

188
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,182
<i>Who is it?</i>

189
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,393
I'll send you a picture.
I need his whereabouts.

190
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,145
Yes, sir. Understood.

191
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,945
Hey, Hammer.
This is Two Knives from Sanggye-dong.

192
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,114
No time for small talk.

193
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,367
I have a job for your guys.

194
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,081
I'm sorry, ladies.
Something urgent came up.

195
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,374
If you'll excuse me.

196
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,542
-Okay.
-Goodbye.

197
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:16,879
May I borrow this knife?

198
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,006
-Sure.
-Thank you.

199
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:21,509
Goodbye.

200
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:25,930
-Oh my goodness.
-That was scary.

201
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,349
Was that what he meant
by being good with knives?

202
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,894
I'm telling you, it's perfect for you.

203
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,354
That's the worst.

204
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:38,484
Nam Junghyun!
Do you have a minute?

205
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,986
You'll have to come with me
even if you're busy.

206
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,280
What are you talking about?

207
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,032
- Who are you anyway?
- I'm a detective.

208
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:46,408
You know Yoon Hyojoo, right?

209
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,828
I need to ask you something about her,
so follow me.

210
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:49,912
Hyojoo?

211
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:51,705
Now I remember.

212
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,501
I have nothing to say about her.

213
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,586
-Why you little…
-Jeez, you scared me.

214
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,380
Are you even a real cop?

215
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:02,550
You look more like a thug to me.

216
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:06,178
Look, mister. Leave my friend alone.

217
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:07,888
You don't want to do this.

218
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,808
What are you talking about?
Like you're really a cop.

219
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:15,104
There are so many scumbags
impersonating cops these days.

220
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:18,941
Let go! My shoulder!

221
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,571
You guys started this.

222
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,576
Bring it on.

223
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:30,327
Ugh!

224
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:31,745
Come here, you bastard.

225
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,669
Follow me.

226
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:39,920
- Let go!
- Bastard.

227
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,130
Come on!

228
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,382
SONGWON POLICE STATION

229
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:46,927
The suspects are gathered in a room?

230
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,137
Not a physical one.

231
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,763
The rookie created a group chat

232
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:52,057
and invited all the suspects.

233
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,184
Oh, he invited all of them here?

234
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,729
Not physically, but…

235
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:00,190
Are you not familiar with group chats?

236
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,360
- I am.
- I wanted to save trouble

237
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:06,030
by notifying them of the schedule
in a group chat.

238
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:09,033
Still, you should've scheduled
their interviews separately.

239
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:11,118
We can't question all of them
at the same time.

240
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:12,286
I'm sorry.

241
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,496
So they're all here?

242
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,708
Nam Junghyun didn't reply,
but everyone else is here.

243
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,002
That's Nam Junghyun.

244
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,295
Let go!

245
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:22,671
Damn it…

246
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,964
Shut your mouth!

247
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,676
Look, this guy is definitely the culprit.

248
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,392
You have
four fire insurance policies.

249
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,937
That's quite unusual.

250
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,940
-Well…
-All the circumstances

251
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:44,318
point to you committing arson
to get insurance money.

252
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:47,196
If it was arson,
I wouldn't get any insurance money anyway.

253
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,491
Regardless,
you could still be charged with fraud.

254
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,242
My goodness.

255
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:56,580
Whatever I say here
stays between us, right?

256
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:57,998
Yes.

257
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,124
The thing is…

258
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,920
-I love to write poems.
-Sorry?

259
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:05,923
I'm an official member
of the Association of Poets.

260
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,551
-And?
-Do you know where poems come from?

261
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,178
I'm not sure.

262
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:14,682
Poems come from beauty.

263
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:19,436
To write poems,
you must yearn desperately

264
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,774
to devote your whole existence to beauty…

265
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,734
…and even risk
losing your sense of self…

266
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,241
Let me get this straight.

267
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:36,787
So you had a crush on this lady, right?

268
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,373
And she sells insurance.

269
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:43,002
You had to buy all kinds of insurance
to even have a meal with her,

270
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:46,296
and that's how you ended up with
so many insurance policies. Is that it?

271
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,424
That pretty much sums it up.

272
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:50,592
By the way…

273
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:54,847
will my wife be informed about this?

274
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:05,441
You've been investigated
for arson many times before.

275
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,570
-Detective.
-Yes?

276
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,321
This is seriously frustrating.

277
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:16,952
I absolutely hate fire! I mean it.

278
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,913
-Do you see this burn?
-Yes.

279
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:22,583
I got it while making caramel
when I was little.

280
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:26,003
I've gone out of my way
to avoid using gas stoves ever since.

281
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:28,505
I haven't barbecued
in more than a decade!

282
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,889
Why don't you take a seat?

283
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,557
I'm good. Let's just get this over with.

284
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,145
Have a seat.

285
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,898
You're distracting me.

286
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,358
I don't see any chairs.

287
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,906
<i>Wait! Think for a second.</i>

288
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,125
You're going to regret this.

289
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:08,212
How could you use violence
on a law-abiding citizen?

290
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,297
Do you think I'll let it slide?

291
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,301
I heard you used excessive force
in the process of bringing him in.

292
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:18,847
The suspect was resisting violently, so--

293
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,265
That's your side of the story.

294
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,017
I just want you to know

295
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:25,479
that we're not letting this one slide.

296
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:28,774
Let it slide, glide,
or whatever you want.

297
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,528
You texted Yoon Hyojoo
on the day of the incident, didn't you?

298
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:38,117
Is texting a crime in Korea?

299
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,369
You met her that day.

300
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,122
We can prove it
by tracking your phone.

301
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,331
Don't even try to lie.

302
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:45,874
You're making a baseless assumption.

303
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:52,881
It seems like you've been fined
for stalking before.

304
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,634
Have you been stalking Ms. Yoon?

305
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:58,220
What? Who are you calling a stalker now?

306
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,513
You, you bastard.

307
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,598
We're accusing you of stalking!

308
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:05,978
Can I hold you responsible for that?

309
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,355
You were following Hyojoo that day.

310
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,110
<i>You saw her
enter the restaurant</i>

311
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,278
<i>and followed her in.</i>

312
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:18,198
You probably tried to push her
to go out with you again.

313
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:22,119
When she said no,
things must've gotten tense.

314
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,172
You must've been both upset…

315
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,966
and scared.

316
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,263
By then, the place was full of evidence.

317
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,809
So you set the fire to get rid of it all!

318
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,102
What do you think you're doing?

319
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:53,233
This is why people think
you're such useless pigs.

320
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:56,695
Fine, I followed her that day. Why?

321
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,656
Just because I dated her for a bit,

322
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,825
she was acting all high and mighty.

323
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:02,910
That's enough.

324
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,412
She acts like she's all that
when she's just a nobody.

325
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:09,208
When I see people like her,
I can't help but knock them down a peg.

326
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,544
People need to know their place.

327
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,546
Am I right?

328
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,716
Stop it, Joongryeok.

329
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,844
This will only make things worse.

330
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,930
Calm down, okay?

331
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,973
No further statements.

332
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,308
Don't say anything more.

333
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,352
-Let's go.
-This is pissing me off. Let go.

334
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:29,436
What did I do wrong?

335
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,313
Fine, I followed her,

336
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:34,566
but she caught on
and ditched me.

337
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,817
So I lost her.

338
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,210
Hello?

339
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,172
Okay. I'll be right there.

340
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:05,555
I hung out with my friends
at a poker room all night.

341
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:06,932
You can ask them.

342
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,191
Captain.

343
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:19,611
You summoned Minsoo too?

344
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,323
I told you it wasn't him.

345
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:24,950
We're still getting his statement.

346
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,076
Exactly.

347
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,786
Why are you doing this?

348
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,297
That's what I should be asking you.

349
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,882
Are you going to keep this up?

350
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:50,559
This is Violent Crimes Team 2.

351
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:53,603
Listen.

352
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,981
Hyojoo has woken up.

353
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:57,065
She has?

354
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,905
- Come out, Minsoo.
- What?

355
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,783
-Hyojoo's woken up. Head over there.
-She has?

356
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,201
Head to the hospital.

357
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,203
You can give your statement later.

358
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,794
You can head over there too,
Detective Moo.

359
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:19,838
I'll give you a ride.

360
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:26,762
She might not be ready
to give any statements yet.

361
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,222
She's only just regained consciousness.

362
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:30,390
How long do we have to wait?

363
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:31,475
It's hard to say.

364
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:35,270
She barely remembers anything
about what happened that day.

365
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,314
She suffered a TBI…

366
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:39,483
Oh.

367
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,486
- TBI stands for…
- Traumatic brain injury.

368
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,489
- I know that much.
- How do you know that?

369
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:48,325
- I studied a bit of forensic medicine.
- Oh.

370
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:50,452
That makes this a lot easier for me.

371
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:51,912
Yes, go ahead.

372
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:53,663
As I mentioned,

373
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,582
the wound on the back of her head

374
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:57,709
isn't serious in itself.

375
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:00,212
The cerebral hemorrhage
isn't as severe as I thought either.

376
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:02,464
Cereal and porridge?

377
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:04,466
Not cereal and porridge.

378
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,134
Cerebral hemorrhage.

379
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,260
Bleeding in the brain.

380
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,679
Let's just speak Korean, shall we?

381
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,515
We need to honor Sejong the Great.

382
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:14,142
What he invented was Hangul,
not the Korean language itself.

383
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,352
DONGBANG YUBIN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA

384
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:16,728
KOREAN AND HANGUL ARE DIFFERENT!

385
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:19,398
KOREAN REFERS TO THE SPOKEN
AND WRITTEN LANGUAGE USED BY KOREANS

386
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,691
WHILE HANGUL SPECIFICALLY REFERS
TO THE KOREAN ALPHABET

387
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,527
Sure. Anyway,

388
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,071
the problem is dissociative amnesia.

389
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:28,615
She's experiencing memory loss

390
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:30,325
and doesn't remember a thing
about the incident.

391
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,411
Will her memory never come back?

392
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:34,621
I can't say for certain.

393
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:36,706
In some cases, memory does return,

394
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:40,252
but in others, it's lost for good.

395
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:53,306
Daddy's home.

396
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,058
Daddy!

397
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,768
You brought fried chicken!

398
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,270
- It's not chicken.
- It stinks.

399
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:00,439
-What is this?
-I hate you, Daddy.

400
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:03,650
-You stinky pants.
-I brought some dinosaurs for you.

401
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:05,360
-Ta-da!
-Wow!

402
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,862
-Here you go.
-Wow!

403
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:11,074
-Triceratops.
-Velociraptor.

404
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,535
Stegosaurus.

405
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:16,455
But where's T-Rex?

406
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,539
T-Rex?

407
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,500
The Tyrannosaurus rex is our favorite.

408
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:24,629
Oh. I'd gotten my hands on it,
but then I lost it.

409
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:26,089
I'll get it back soon.

410
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,757
Make sure to get it back.

411
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:29,342
Promise us.

412
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,427
I promise.

413
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,138
Go to your rooms, girls.

414
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,140
Didn't you say you had a work emergency?

415
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:37,642
-Things worked out.
-Mm.

416
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:38,852
Do we still have to do this?

417
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:40,979
You can never be too careful.

418
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,315
You're done.

419
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:44,983
- Is Nuri asleep?
- Yes.

420
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:48,111
Hmm? Are you knitting?

421
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:50,238
I'm doing it for money.

422
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:53,074
Jeongsuk's studio
is exporting them,

423
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,868
and they just got a big order.

424
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:56,203
Are they paying you enough?

425
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,079
It's not worth it. Just quit.

426
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,248
I'm getting paid 5,000 per piece.

427
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:01,833
-5,000 won?
-Yeah.

428
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:04,127
Wow, that's not bad.

429
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:07,047
Do you have to send
a video of your work too?

430
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:10,467
No, I'm going to start a YouTube channel.

431
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,344
- YouTube?
- Yeah.

432
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,347
Once you get enough subscribers,

433
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,098
it's supposed to be quite profitable.

434
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,810
People find these videos meditative.

435
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:24,105
What? You don't like it?

436
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,149
Of course I do. It'll be total SHIT.

437
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,737
-Did you just curse at me?
-Don't you know what "SHIT" means?

438
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,988
It's an acronym.

439
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:35,450
"Subscribe, Hit like,
In the comments, Turn on notifications."

440
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:46,419
Shit Well Daycare Center

441
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:52,634
I got you.

442
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,720
Sorry, you're not the one I'm looking for.

443
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:57,514
Did you lose something?

444
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,724
No, don't mind me. It's nothing.

445
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,770
Where did it go?

446
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:06,565
-What are you talking about?
-It's nothing.

447
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:09,568
Salute!

448
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,111
Jeez, that startled me.

449
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:12,988
What the hell is this?

450
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:14,864
You still haven't
cleaned this up?

451
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:15,949
Listen.

452
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,619
- Where's the captain?
- He'll be back any minute, sir.

453
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:20,996
What brings you all the way here?

454
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,664
Are you sure you want to know?

455
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:27,586
Do you know who just called me? Huh?

456
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:31,131
The head of our division at headquarters.

457
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:35,176
I heard you brought in an innocent person
and grilled him.

458
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,511
You even used violence!

459
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,013
We never…

460
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:40,056
Uh…

461
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:41,600
You're talking about Nam Junghyun.

462
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:42,684
Who was it?

463
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:44,936
Tell me who it was!

464
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,277
But it's not our fault.

465
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:55,280
The suspect refused to be interviewed…

466
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:58,283
…and assaulted a detective.
Should we have tolerated that?

467
00:26:58,366 --> 00:26:59,826
What are we, punching bags?

468
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,370
Hey, Seo Minseo.

469
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,999
Do you think you're in a position
to talk back to me?

470
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,209
- No, sir.
- Listen.

471
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,754
I'm not letting this one slide.

472
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,797
Send your captain to me
as soon as he comes back.

473
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,883
And be prepared for disciplinary action,
all of you.

474
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,134
Got that?

475
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:17,761
Yes, sir.

476
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:19,429
For goodness' sake!

477
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:21,973
What's the deal with you idiots?

478
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,725
Damn it!

479
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:27,437
Clean this up!

480
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:31,149
-Salute!
-Don't salute me!

481
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,528
Jeez.

482
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,614
This is bad.
This is really bad.

483
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:40,200
This is going to be a nightmare.

484
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:46,581
Hey, why would you take the fall for me?

485
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,334
I just couldn't stand it.
After all you went through…

486
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:52,379
And how the hell does he know
the head of our division?

487
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,591
Minseo.

488
00:27:57,884 --> 00:28:00,053
I'm touched.

489
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,222
Detective Moo.

490
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:04,057
Me too.

491
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,018
It's no big deal.
Don't let it get to you.

492
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,647
How can we not?
It keeps bugging me.

493
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:14,067
I'm concerned too.
The chief totally flipped his lid.

494
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,486
Don't worry about the chief's lid.

495
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:20,990
More importantly, Hyojoo won't be able
to give any statements for a while.

496
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,284
Unfortunately,
she's experiencing memory loss.

497
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,328
- I think you should see this.
- What is it?

498
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:28,373
The captain told me
to keep an eye on Chicken Hunter,

499
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:30,083
so I turned on notifications,

500
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:31,668
and he just posted a new video.

501
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,503
<i>Hello, this is Chicken Hunter.</i>

502
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:36,423
<i>I'd like to apologize
to everyone</i>

503
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:39,759
<i>who has supported us
and watched our videos.</i>

504
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:43,221
<i>Besides our first few videos,</i>

505
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:46,891
<i>we had been paid by restaurant owners
to create favorable content.</i>

506
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,435
- What?
<i>- It hasn't been easy for us either.</i>

507
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:50,019
Did they lie about
Seoul's top seven chicken joints?

508
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,855
Including One Shot Chicken?

509
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:53,231
That can't be.

510
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:55,358
How did you know from the beginning?

511
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:58,319
Contrary to popular belief,
taste is objective.

512
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,780
Cooking involves chemistry.

513
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,867
In other countries,
many scientists are also chefs.

514
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:07,245
That chicken joint
didn't deserve all the hype.

515
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:09,914
Talk about rubbing salt in the wound.

516
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,624
What about all those favorable reviews?

517
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:12,792
They can't all be fake.

518
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:15,462
Their ratings are off the charts!

519
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,547
Most of them must have been manipulated.

520
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:24,262
MEETING ROOM

521
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,269
Gosh, it's out of stock everywhere.

522
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,980
How can I get my hands
on a T-Rex?

523
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:47,035
I've got this.
I've got this under control.

524
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,746
Oh! Gosh!

525
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,080
Hey, why are you here?

526
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:53,500
Nature called on my way to the academy.

527
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:54,959
I can't believe you.

528
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,628
This isn't a public restroom.

529
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:58,963
Public offices are open to everyone.

530
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,507
This is not a public…

531
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,803
It actually is,
but you can't keep coming in here.

532
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,805
Fine, I get it. I'm off.

533
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:18,483
Hey, Donggoo! Donggoo! Wait a second.

534
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,153
- That's…
- Cool, right?

535
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:24,405
It's a Tyrannosaurus rex. T-Rex.

536
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:28,076
-Where did you get it?
-Why?

537
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,703
Well, it looks a lot like the one I lost.

538
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:34,207
-It's mine.
-I'm not saying it's not yours.

539
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:37,627
Let's see here.
I wonder where you might've gotten that.

540
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,005
You picked it up around here, didn't you?

541
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:44,759
I lost mine around here.

542
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,095
-And?
-What do you mean?

543
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,721
It's time to return it to its owner.

544
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,598
-Give it here.
-It's mine.

545
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,267
You picked it up here.

546
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,560
And I lost it here.

547
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,895
And where did you get yours?

548
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,188
-What?
-Cat got your tongue?

549
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,482
Dog got your tongue?
Horse got your tongue?

550
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,317
Do you have anything to say?

551
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:04,529
You don't. Bye.

552
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:06,573
Donggoo! Donggoo…

553
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:08,324
We need to talk. Donggoo.

554
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,468
Hmm.

555
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:02,921
No.

556
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:09,469
This isn't it.

557
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,433
The wound was on the back of her head.

558
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,519
That means…

559
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,218
No. Not this.

560
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:53,888
This isn't it either.

561
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:10,863
<i>It indicates that the fire
started from flammable liquid.</i>

562
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:14,784
<i>It seems someone splashed flammables
and set the fire.</i>

563
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:16,786
<i>That's the typical scenario.</i>

564
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:23,793
NAM JUNGHYUN, 23 YEARS OLD

565
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:26,212
Nam Junghyun's friends confirmed

566
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:28,339
that they were with him until morning.

567
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:30,675
<i>His phone was traced
to the poker room too.</i>

568
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,261
He was our prime suspect.

569
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,764
And Kang Sangdu
was at his restaurant.

570
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,641
<i>It's been confirmed</i>

571
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:41,310
that he was streaming videos
using his restaurant's Wi-Fi.

572
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:43,688
- Out.
- He's out too.

573
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,940
Mr. Song's statement
has been verified as well.

574
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,734
His insurance agent confirmed

575
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,819
<i>that he has a ton of insurance policies,</i>

576
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:52,113
-<i>including three for his dog.
-</i>Thank you so much.

577
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:53,781
Mr. Song is out too.

578
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,408
So is Mr. Yoon.

579
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:58,786
I checked the CCTV,
and he came home around 1 a.m.

580
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,079
and stayed put.

581
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,622
All night long.

582
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:04,000
- Who on earth did it then?
- Gosh.

583
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,587
Did the owner used to be a boxer?

584
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,923
The medal at the restaurant.
Did you say it was stainless steel?

585
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,008
Yes.

586
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:13,968
What about it?

587
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:16,262
<i>If it had been gold,</i>

588
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:18,264
<i>it would've melted
beyond recognition in the fire.</i>

589
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:19,891
<i>But since it's steel,</i>

590
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:21,768
<i>it should've remained intact.</i>

591
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:23,811
<i>The medal in the restaurant</i>

592
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,605
disappeared after the fire

593
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:29,358
<i>and turned up in Yoon Minsoo's apartment.</i>

594
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:31,402
Yoon Minsoo

595
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:35,281
may have known in advance
that there would be a fire.

596
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:36,908
Are you suggesting he--

597
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:38,993
Hey, are you serious?

598
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,662
I'm just saying.

599
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:45,458
Yoon Minsoo's statement
also seemed a bit off.

600
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,960
Did you say this could've been arson?

601
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:50,171
<i>Even though his daughter
was attacked…</i>

602
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,883
<i>he only asked if it was arson,
not who did it.</i>

603
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,888
So what? That doesn't prove anything.

604
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,974
Maybe not.

605
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:05,770
It's just been on my mind, that's all.

606
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:20,618
"Moo Joongryeok wins boxing gold
at Athena International Games"

607
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:22,662
"My goal is to continue winning
every match by knockout"

608
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:24,413
- Hello, sir.
- Keep up the good work.

609
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:25,832
Hello, sir.

610
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:27,583
Here comes our gold medalist!

611
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:30,294
You're on TV all the time.
You're quite the star now.

612
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,463
Right, I want your autograph.

613
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,173
I'm going to hang it on the wall here.

614
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,300
Don't be silly.

615
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,178
- Here.
- What's this?

616
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:41,806
You said
you wanted my gold medal.

617
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:44,725
You can have it.
Hang it somewhere or something.

618
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,769
That was just a joke.

619
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,313
Anyway, is this real gold?

620
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:52,692
I asked around,
and they said it was fake.

621
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:55,153
If it was real,
I would've kept it myself.

622
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,237
Then I don't want it either.

623
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,572
You wanted it though.

624
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:00,199
This is an Olympic gold medal.

625
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,535
Hand it down
from generation to generation.

626
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,745
It's no big deal.

627
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,497
Want to touch it?

628
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,577
No, no, no, no, no.

629
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,287
Stop crying.

630
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,539
I'm a grown-up,
so I'm good at making these things!

631
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,749
What were you guys making?

632
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:51,626
-This.
-Let me see.

633
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,591
What are you, Leonardo DiCaprio?

634
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:02,345
It's Leonardo da Vinci.

635
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:04,597
You ruined everything!

636
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,391
We've been working on this project
for six months.

637
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:08,559
Six months?

638
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,863
<i>Yoon Minsoo's statement
also seemed a bit off.</i>

639
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:23,491
<i>Even though his daughter was attacked,</i>

640
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:26,619
he only asked if it was arson,
not who did it.

641
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,247
<i>Joongryeok.</i>

642
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,831
Hyojoo will be okay, right?

643
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:34,961
She means everything to me.

644
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:37,838
Detective Moo.

645
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:40,174
We need you inside.

646
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:42,969
Give me a break, will you?

647
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,512
Please, just this once.

648
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,936
The captain asked me
to look into something.

649
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:53,271
Just tell us.

650
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,981
Yes, just tell us.

651
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:57,441
They say a picture's
worth a thousand words,

652
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,986
so I created a video for you.

653
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,404
Let's see it.

654
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:13,833
Wow.

655
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,085

SONGWON POLICE STATION
VIOLENT CRIMES TEAM 2 BRIEFING

660
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:30,141
What the heck is this?
Are you submitting this to the Oscars?

661
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:32,059
Are you gonna call yourself
Bong Tansik now?

662
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,228
While I was at it,
I wanted to do it properly.

663
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,980
You can just tell us.

664
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:38,190
But it's going to start soon.

665
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:41,110
ONE SHOT CHICKEN REVIEW ANALYSIS

666
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:42,194
What's wrong with this?

667
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:44,238
What are you doing?

668
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:54,707
The file must be corrupted.

669
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,584
You must be kidding me.

670
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,836
I'll just tell you.

671
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,963
Take a look at this.

672
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,674
A photo posted on the food delivery app
Satisfaction Delivered on August 2nd

673
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:08,012
is the same as the one posted on the app
Ready to Order on September 13th.

674
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:09,722
The same photo has been posted everywhere.

675
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:12,683
That's right. The pattern on the table

676
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:15,436
and even the oil stains
on the wrapper are identical.

677
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,646
I found more than
20 similar cases.

678
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:20,483
Detective Seo, please look
into the restaurant's insurance again.

679
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:24,195
Detectives Jung and Jang,
interview the neighbors again.

680
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:25,529
Yes, sir.

681
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:26,655
And Detective Moo.

682
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:31,702
I think you should leave this case to us.

683
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:06,278
No one expected that restaurant's success.

684
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,489
But it started attracting customers

685
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:09,907
from all corners overnight.

686
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:12,284
It was never popular with the locals.

687
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:14,412
Their chicken is nothing special.

688
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:17,957
I heard they used
to run a pork cutlet place,

689
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:20,543
but it failed.

690
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:22,294
Then they must've been in debt.

691
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:26,298
Well, I don't know all the details.

692
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:29,844
I heard nothing gets past you around here.

693
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,011
I'm thirsty.

694
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:37,393
As the leader of our community,

695
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:40,896
she knows everything
about the neighborhood.

696
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,237
After a series of failed businesses,
they were up to their neck in debt.

697
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,198
The guy used to do sports
or something, didn't he?

698
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,450
Yes, he used to be a boxer.

699
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,869
After doing sports all his life,

700
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:57,788
wouldn't it be strange
if his business succeeded right away?

701
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,039
And he opened the restaurant

702
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,416
at the peak of the COVID crisis.

703
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:01,709
Oh.

704
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:03,836
-Talk about bad luck.
-Mm-hmm.

705
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,921
Are you taking notes?

706
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:07,506
You little brat.

707
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,091
Make sure to get all the receipts.

708
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:10,759
Otherwise, I'm paying out of pocket.

709
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,596
Snap out of it.

710
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:16,515
Right before the fire,

711
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:19,518
he paid three months' worth
of overdue insurance at once.

712
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,896
Three months' worth at once?

713
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:24,315
It was to stop his policy
from being canceled.

714
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:26,775
Was he after the insurance money then?

715
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:28,861
How much is the payout?

716
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:30,654
In the event of a fire,

717
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,199
up to 300 million won.

718
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:36,994
After deducting expenses,
he'd be left with around 100 million won.

719
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:39,788
But here's the thing.
He's taken out a lot of loans.

720
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,209
The principal alone
exceeds 100 million won.

721
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,586
Setting his restaurant on fire
to pay off his debt?

722
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:47,755
It doesn't make sense.

723
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,974
Why are you alone today?
Where is everyone?

724
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:02,811
I wanted to sort out my thoughts alone.

725
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:06,357
Goodness gracious.

726
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,776
You're sorting out thoughts
over rice and soup?

727
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:11,028
That's so corny.

728
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:14,907
I had to eat anyway.

729
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:17,117
What's there to think about?

730
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:20,871
Your job is to bust bad guys.

731
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:22,498
It's that simple.

732
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:32,716
I have a tip
regarding the Yoon Hyojoo case.

733
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:48,440
