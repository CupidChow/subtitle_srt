{\an8}EPISODE 10

3
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,841
Yes. My username is Chocoholic.

4
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,219
What? It's been forever
since I returned the products.

5
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,805
Why haven't you sent the new ones yet?

6
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:59,017
It's not just some chocolate to me.
My life depends on it.

7
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:00,727
What?

8
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:05,732
Look, Nam Junghyun really was in the club.

9
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:08,276
See? I got bad vibes
from him right from the start.

10
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,611
Should we arrest him right away?

11
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:11,446
Arrest him? For clubbing?

12
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:13,782
Stop being frustrating.
When it comes to arresting someone,

13
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,241
speed is key!

14
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:18,828
Evidence must be lawfully obtained
to be admissible.

15
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,667
Huh, isn't that Berkeley Druggie?

16
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,796
It's him, isn't it?

17
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,881
You're right.
I heard he just got released.

18
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:31,716
-Who's Berkeley Druggie?
-What?

19
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,176
<i>Tan, Tan.</i>

20
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,428
Oh, he's a famous junkie.

21
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,847
He lies about
having graduated from Berkeley

22
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,183
or some fancy US university

23
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:43,144
and slings drugs at clubs.

24
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,230
Wow,
Nam Junghyun must be doing drugs too.

25
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:46,815
Don't you think?

26
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:50,276
Why don't we try to get an arrest warrant
for Nam Junghyun using this, Captain?

27
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,862
Forget it.
We couldn't even get a search warrant.

28
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,907
Let's just bring him in
and deal with whatever comes after.

29
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,033
Let's just arrest him.

30
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,493
Hey, jinx!

31
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,453
Jinx, my foot.

32
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,039
I'm talking about Berkeley Druggie,
not Nam Junghyun!

33
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,584
There's no need to yell.

34
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,087
Sorry about that.

35
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,973
SEOUL BUSTERS

36
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,182
SEARCH AND SEIZURE WARRANT

37
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,560
You can't just push your way in like this.

38
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,186
We brought the warrant!

39
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,231
Whether you have the warrant or not,
you'll have to wait a minute.

40
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,732
You're still refusing to cooperate?

41
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:33,736
Hey, thugs.

42
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,904
What?

43
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,072
Get out of the way.

44
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,491
I'll count to three.

45
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,286
I'm serious this time.

46
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,290
One.

47
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,586
Two.

48
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,219
We're not supposed to do this,
but welcome!

49
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,304
Welcome!

50
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,186
Sir!

51
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,188
What is it now?

52
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:11,649
You need to wear this wristband to enter.

53
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,234
Okay! Put it on me.

54
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,319
Yes, sir.

55
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:17,030
- Is that too tight?
- It's perfect.

56
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,994
Let's spread out
and search! Quick!

57
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,078
Okay.

58
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,506
What do you need? I'm busy.

59
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:45,099
I don't like the music today.

60
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,061
-You're a new face.
-Yeah.

61
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,145
Are you here alone?

62
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,231
I heard I could find good music here.

63
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:54,359
-Music?
-From abroad.

64
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,110
A mood-booster.

65
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,368
Here's my number.

66
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,081
If you're looking for Berkeley Druggie,

67
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:11,125
he's in the room
at the end of the hallway.

68
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,919
Thanks.

69
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,048
Hey. He's in the room
at the end of the hallway.

70
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:21,511
Come upstairs,
and you'll find the VIP rooms, hmm?

71
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,430
I'll have to drug test you too.

72
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,723
What?

73
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,101
Is this what you're into?

74
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,811
I got you dead to rights.

75
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,271
What?

76
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,399
I need backup.

77
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,110
Is this for real?

78
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,119
- What the hell?
- Gosh!

79
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:48,204
- Keep dancing. Sorry.
- Shit!

80
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,082
Hold on!

81
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,293
Berkeley Druggie!

82
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,586
- Ouch!
- It's you, isn't it?

83
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,380
If you've had enough fun, come with me.

84
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,756
Yo, what's up, man?

85
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,218
What is it now?

86
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:03,970
I've really quit drugs now.

87
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:06,055
I'm clean, yo.
I've washed my hands.

88
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,641
I don't care if you've washed
your hands or ass. Just follow me.

89
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,101
Who are you?

90
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,645
Move.
Don't cross the line, or else.

91
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,355
This guy's crazy, yo.

92
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,108
Who do you think you're talking to?

93
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:19,068
You want to bow to me, don't you?

94
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,113
What the hell are you talking about?

95
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,330
- Damn it.
- Get him, guys!

96
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:57,815
You're dead!

97
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:14,957
What the heck?

98
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,042
What's he doing?

99
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,002
- Punch him, now!
- Dance time!

100
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,853
- Champagne?
- I only drink soju.

101
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,355
Follow me.

102
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,149
How about soju and beer?

103
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,280
Hey, Druggie. Look at this.

104
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,491
You've sold drugs to him, haven't you?

105
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,244
Detective.

106
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:55,498
If I rat on him, I'm dead meat for real.

107
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:58,459
He's a bad guy
who isn't scared of anything.

108
00:06:58,543 --> 00:06:59,752
He's super bad, yo.

109
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,505
Answer my question,
or you're done for anyway.

110
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,591
Jeez.

111
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,009
Goddammit!

112
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,262
Yeah! <i>Ganddaengi</i>! Yeah!

113
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,931
His <i>ganddaengi</i> is all swollen.
He needs to learn a lesson.

114
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,725
<i>Ganddaengi</i>? He's got a swollen liver?

115
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,602
No, it's an idiom.

116
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:19,355
It means he's got a lot of nerve.

117
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:21,357
Okay?

118
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,444
Step it up this time.

119
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,444
Step it up this time.

120
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,404
If you mess up
again, you owe us two million won.

121
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,073
Just get your money ready, okay?

122
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,202
Fore!

123
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:41,294
Hey, you even suck at golf.
Is there anything you're good at?

124
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,629
What do you want now?

125
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,423
I know. You're good at being an ass.

126
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,468
You're under arrest
for possessing cannabis

127
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,511
under the Narcotics Control Act.

128
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:54,724
-Get over here.
-Damn it.

129
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,893
Stop there!

130
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,479
Whoa, whoa, whoa…

131
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,563
- What the…
- Hey!

132
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,109
Joongryeok, get in! Get in!

133
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,694
We can't let him get away!

134
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,196
Step on it, Junghwan!

135
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,407
What the hell? Wrong way!

136
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,242
Stop, stop, stop!

137
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,161
- Stop. Change gears.
- Gears. Gears.

138
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,913
- Where's the lever?
- There it is.

139
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,916
-Hey! My gosh, turn around.
-Turn around?

140
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,834
-Back up! Yes!
-Back up?

141
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,252
There you go!

142
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,670
Let's go!

143
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,132
Step on it, Junghwan!

144
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,258
Stop right there!

145
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,635
Stop!

146
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,595
- Hey!
- You have nowhere to run!

147
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,806
Speed up! Step on the gas!

148
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,183
I can't go any faster!

149
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,393
- This is fine.
- I said step on it!

150
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,062
- I am!
- Harder!

151
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,523
Out of the way!

152
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:44,607
Stop!

153
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,526
Gosh, what are you doing?

154
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,361
-Out of the way!
-Please move.

155
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:51,656
Damn it.

156
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,375
Nam Junghyun, you'll have to come with me.

157
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,543
Let go.

158
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:09,924
Is this Nam Junghyun's locker?

159
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,050
It's so full.

160
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:12,885
Can you give me a bag for all this?

161
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,179
We'll take care of his belongings.

162
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,056
-Otherwise, we might get in trouble.
-Don't worry.

163
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,017
You know this costs
about 10 million won, right?

164
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,894
What costs 10 million won? This?

165
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,480
-Yes.
-Why didn't you tell me sooner?

166
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:26,816
Whoa…

167
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:28,818
-Is this okay?
-No, it's not.

168
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:29,944
-Give it here.
-Whoa.

169
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:32,697
10 million won?

170
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,659
SONGWON POLICE STATION
HAS MOVED TO A TEMPORARY LOCATION

171
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,536
Wow, you bleached your hair.

172
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:43,249
Why do you care?
Is this a hair salon?

173
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:46,335
Are you my hairdressers or something?

174
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,505
Damn it.

175
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,382
What a pain in the ass.

176
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,427
I agree, sir. Totally.

177
00:09:57,346 --> 00:10:01,726
Junkies do all sorts of things
to their hair to destroy evidence.

178
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,227
You think we don't know that?

179
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:04,979
So you detoxed?

180
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,981
As if that's going to work.

181
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:08,816
You're out of line.

182
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,569
You recognize him, don't you?

183
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,409
-What's going on?
-You two got into a scuffle on the street.

184
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,494
Wait a minute. What's going on here?

185
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,371
What does this have
to do with the case?

186
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,958
We can show you the CCTV footage
if you want.

187
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,005
This is getting interesting.

188
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,466
Now I remember.

189
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:37,845
This old geezer was getting on my nerves.

190
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,431
-But what about him?
-Later that night,

191
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:44,143
he was murdered.

192
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:48,814
Let me get this straight.

193
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,191
Are you suspecting me of murder,

194
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,942
not drug use?

195
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,527
You don't have to answer them.

196
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,696
Is it really okay

197
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,324
to try to pin a murder on someone
without any grounds?

198
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,869
If you want to investigate him further,
bring the evidence.

199
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:07,500
Let's take a break.

200
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,596
Captain, what should we…

201
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,684
What's with him? He ignored me.

202
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,812
What should we do
if that bastard keeps playing dumb?

203
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:30,856
Hey, something's fishy.
I can tell from his eyes.

204
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,358
I have a hunch.

205
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,319
-What happens if he keeps playing dumb?
-What do you think…

206
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,654
<i>Tan, Tan.</i>

207
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,115
Oh, then things get complicated.

208
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:42,118
And he'll just get charged
with using cannabis at most.

209
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,744
By the way, where's Minseo?

210
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,622
She went to the National Forensic Service
to get the drug test results

211
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,833
for the guy we collared at the club.

212
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,876
Oh… Let's take a break for now.

213
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:15,484
Mmm…

214
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,737
Hey, kid. Can I buy that from you?

215
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:24,744
No way.
My uncle got it for me in Switzerland.

216
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,537
I really need it.

217
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,289
Please sell it to me.

218
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:32,251
You can't just get whatever you want
because you say you need it.

219
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,546
Plus, think about how much it costs
to ship this from Switzerland.

220
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,257
-My answer's no.
-These are originally 3,000 won each.

221
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,383
This is way more than that.

222
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,927
I really need it right now.
Please do me a favor.

223
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,013
I'll give you
a whole box tomorrow.

224
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:47,099
Ugh, why do the detectives here
keep trying to take stuff from me?

225
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,769
-Did someone else ask you for something?
-I'll think about it.

226
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,437
I'll pay you more.

227
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,647
Forget it. Wait, I have to catch my bus.

228
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:57,109
- Bye.
- What? No, wait, kid!

229
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,161
Shit!

230
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,415
- Hi, Donggoo.
- Hello.

231
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,971
I'm so tired.

232
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,056
Hi, guys!

233
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,058
-Hi, Donggoo.
-Hi.

234
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,894
My uncle bought me chocolate
from Switzerland.

235
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,313
- Really?
- Yes.

236
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,023
- Want to see it?
- Yes!

237
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,650
Hmm?

238
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,903
<i>Let me borrow your chocolate
until tomorrow.</i>

239
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,030
<i>We really need it for busting bad guys.</i>

240
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:44,406
<i>From the pretty detective.</i>

241
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,033
Wow!

242
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,785
When did she swap them?

243
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,203
Unbelievable!

244
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,089
Huh? Hold on a second.

245
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,966
What is this doing here?
Who put it here?

246
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,050
Oh!

247
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:05,594
Wow.

248
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,832
-Detective Seo.
-Yes?

249
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:37,209
Can I have another look at the footage?

250
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,503
You mean the footage
from the convenience store?

251
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:40,754
Yes, please.

252
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,594
Why is he suddenly in a good mood?
What's with him?

253
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,930
Maybe he slept well.

254
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:53,142
He's like a roller coaster these days.

255
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,496
Please write down
what you did on the day of the incident.

256
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,874
In chronological order.
Don't leave anything out.

257
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,293
Fucking hell.

258
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:24,131
Hey, do I look that easy to you guys? Huh?

259
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,507
Do I look like a pushover to you?

260
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,593
Answer me, goddammit!

261
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:32,514
What gives you the right
to waste my time whenever you want to?

262
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,849
Huh?

263
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:34,934
Hey.

264
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:37,436
I can't stand you anymore.

265
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,687
You deserve a beating.

266
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,316
Be my guest, gorilla. Get up.

267
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,943
"Gorilla"?

268
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,612
- Come here, you bastard.
- What do you think you're doing?

269
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,948
No!
His jacket costs 10 million won!

270
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:53,827
Grab him already!

271
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,330
What are you waiting for? What's wrong?

272
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,624
Go ahead and grab me.

273
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,376
Hey, gorilla.

274
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,297
What's wrong? Do it.

275
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,508
Grab me already.

276
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:10,552
Didn't you say
you were going to teach me a lesson?

277
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,513
You little…

278
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:16,892
Just answer the question.

279
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,061
Do you really have nothing
to do with the murder?

280
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,688
Stay out of it, underling.

281
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,272
Answer me!

282
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,990
Tansik. Tansik!

283
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,658
- Detective Jang. Detective Jang!
- Calm down.

284
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,452
Shake him hard two more times.

285
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,295
You must all be out of your minds.

286
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,423
You won't get away with this!

287
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,800
Calm down and follow me.

288
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,815
Detective Moo, please drive him
to the National Forensic Service.

289
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:07,901
- The National Forensic Service?
- Yes. I've already talked to them.

290
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:11,739
Detective Jang,
keep your hands covered the whole way.

291
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:14,408
- Yes, sir.
- What should we do with Nam Junghyun?

292
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,869
Let him go for now.

293
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,078
Get going.

294
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,414
Follow me.

295
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:21,790
Okay.

296
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,094
-Get in already.
-I can't use my hands.

297
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,521
- Well…
- What? What is it now?

298
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,066
-Buckle me up, please.
-I can't believe you.

299
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,442
Look, my hands.

300
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,447
Careful!

301
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,786
-What's wrong?
-Oh, I'm ticklish.

302
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,746
Stay still,

303
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,456
-or I'll push you out.
-Understood.

304
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,460
I'm sorry.

305
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,173
-Detective Moo.
-Will you be quiet?

306
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:12,758
I'm sorry, but--

307
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:15,052
Whatever it is, just don't.

308
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,845
- I'm really sorry, but--
- What is it?

309
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,349
-I need to use the bathroom.
-You crazy idiot!

310
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,017
Not in a million years, got that?

311
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,394
If I hold it in any longer, I might die.

312
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,188
Sure, just die. Drop dead.

313
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,856
I'm about to wet my pants!

314
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,983
Fine, go ahead!

315
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,693
-I'm wetting my pants!
-Hey!

316
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,321
-I really am!
-You little…

317
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,210
Detective Moo.

318
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,755
I can't thank you enough.

319
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,423
I'll never forget

320
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,592
your kindness.

321
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,345
- Let's go.
- Hey.

322
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:00,556
Promise you'll take this to your grave.

323
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,225
I promise.

324
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:06,145
No. Keep it a secret
even in the afterlife.

325
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,688
I will.

326
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:14,778
Detective Moo.

327
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,239
Please open the door for me.

328
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:24,163
Captain, Nam Junghyun
is leaving the country today.

329
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,581
He's flying out to LA tonight.

330
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,207
- Tonight?
- Yes.

331
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,502
I also found footage of him taking a taxi
to the scene of the incident.

332
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,672
But we're still waiting
for the forensic results.

333
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:35,799
We'll have to stall him.

334
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,594
Actually, the drug squad
is going to search his home.

335
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:41,555
If they find any drugs,
we can make an arrest immediately.

336
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:43,515
Then let's head over there.

337
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,808
Yes, sir.

338
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:49,563
- Hello.
- Hello.

339
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:51,773
- Have you found anything?
- No.

340
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,775
Where on earth
did he hide them?

341
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,569
Captain, we'll help
with the search.

342
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:56,653
There's no need.

343
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,739
The sniffer dogs
are on their way, so please wait.

344
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:01,241
- Sniffer dogs?
- There's one called Coco,

345
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,701
and he can detect any…

346
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:05,370
- Here they come.
- Let's go in.

347
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,247
Come here.

348
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:11,585
Coco.

349
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,297
Coco?

350
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,216
This one here

351
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:18,717
is Coco.

352
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,222
Isn't he
a bit too cute for the job?

353
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,432
He may be adorable,
but he's the top dog on the team.

354
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,519
Let's go, you guys!

355
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,078
Detective Jang.

356
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,416
You should give it a try.

357
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:56,004
- Me?
- I think you can do better than a dog.

358
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,215
Give it a try.

359
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,468
Wait.

360
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:04,638
Please leave Coco alone
while he's searching.

361
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:07,557
This guy's sense of smell
is just as keen as that of a sniffer dog.

362
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,775
<i>Who's that mangy mutt?</i>

363
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,568
<i>Does he really think</i>

364
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,988
<i>his weak nose
stands a chance against mine?</i>

365
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,116
<i>"Co" means nose,
and I'm called "Coco" for a reason.</i>

366
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,659
<i>Coco, the champion sniffer.</i>

367
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,452
Detective Jang.

368
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,746
Go find the drugs.

369
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,082
Yes, sir.

370
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:24,468
Hey, how did it go?

371
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:29,848
How are we doing on time?

372
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,725
We're short on it, as always.

373
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:33,977
At this rate, we'll miss him.

374
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:36,271
There's no way he can outsniff a dog.

375
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,690
What do we do?

376
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:41,276
We can't let him get away.

377
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:44,363
I told you it wouldn't work.

378
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,242
There's no point.

379
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:53,747
<i>I really think of us as a team.</i>

380
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:57,167
<i>I'm sure there's a role for you
on our team.</i>

381
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,670
<i>You're just as good as a dog.</i>

382
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:05,300
<i>No, I think you might be
even better than a dog.</i>

383
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:06,718
<i>You really have</i>

384
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,471
the nose of a dog.

<i>Drugs.</i>

400
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:58,955
I found the drugs!

401
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,334
I knew it! Well done, Detective Jang.

402
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:03,502
Good boy!

403
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,886
Track down and arrest Nam Junghyun.

404
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:14,471
- Yes, sir.
- Let's go.

405
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:15,555
Okay.

406
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:17,182
Nice job.

407
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:25,106
<i>If only I hadn't caught a cold,
I would've beaten him.</i>

408
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:28,610
<i>Cheer up, Coco.
Better luck next time.</i>

409
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:31,154
<i>I hope we still get some treats.</i>

410
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,534
Hello, Dongbang Yubin speaking.

411
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,536
Your guess was right.

412
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:38,745
I was right?

413
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,413
<i>The fibers found
under the victim's nails</i>

414
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:44,459
<i>matched those from the jacket
Nam Junghyun was wearing that day</i>

415
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,835
<i>and also matched</i>

416
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,089
the fibers found on the weapon.

417
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:53,009
This should be enough direct evidence.

418
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:56,429
In other words, it's crystal clear.

419
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:57,639
Good work.

420
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:01,351
It's been confirmed

421
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:03,979
that Nam Junghyun murdered Yoon Haesik.

422
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,690
- I knew it.
- Let's go.

423
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:14,030
All he did was grab him by the collar.
How did that lead to crucial evidence?

424
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:16,283
Edmond Locard,
the criminologist, said this.

A FRENCH CRIMINOLOGIST
AND PIONEER OF MODERN FORENSIC SCIENCE

428
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:24,541
"Every contact leaves a trace."

429
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:30,005
<i>I knew Nam Junghyun must've
left a trace if he really was the killer,</i>

430
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:35,218
<i>no matter how small it was.</i>

431
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,429
Shake him hard two more times.

432
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,438
Oh… So that was why.

433
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:49,357
If Nam Junghyun had been wearing
something else that day,

434
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,942
we wouldn't have found our evidence.

435
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:54,029
We eventually would have,
although it would've taken longer.

436
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:57,198
How could he kill a person
over such a trivial matter?

437
00:26:57,282 --> 00:27:00,744
People like him always go after
those weaker than they are.

438
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:04,289
The lower your self-esteem is,
the more you rely on your pride.

439
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,499
- Leave me alone!
- Just choose whatever you want.

440
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,001
- Let go!
- I'll give you a good price.

441
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:09,169
- I said no!
- What's going on?

442
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:10,253
Come with me!

443
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:13,131
-Look.
-Hey, stop it!

444
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:16,301
Who are you? Get out of the way.

445
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:18,345
She's telling you to leave her alone.

446
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:21,514
You shouldn't try to overpower a woman.
Let her go!

447
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:23,725
-What?
-Don't worry and go home, miss.

448
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:26,353
Where do you think you're going? Hey!

449
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:28,938
Look, don't do this.

450
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,942
- Do you want to die?
- Show some respect!

451
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:34,527
Hey! Let go!

452
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:35,862
Do you even know who I am?

453
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:39,407
I sure do.

454
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,409
You're a loser who harasses women!

455
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:46,539
Why you little…

456
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:49,000
He's going to hit him.
What should we do?

457
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,378
<i>When he realized
he had made a spectacle of himself,</i>

458
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,879
<i>he must've felt humiliated.</i>

459
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:57,676
- Is he beating someone up?
- We need to call the police.

460
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:02,013
-Consider yourself lucky.
-Lucky, my foot.

461
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,101
He needs to calm down.

462
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,603
Yoon Haesik's provocation

463
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:11,272
must have damaged his fragile self-esteem.

464
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:45,098
Okay.

465
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:12,000
You seem to be in a good mood
after making me feel like shit.

466
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,084
Who are you?

467
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,641
What a pathetic loser.

468
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,227
You followed me all the way here?

469
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,520
Who's a pathetic loser?

470
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:47,994
Who do you think you are,
mocking me like that?

471
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,369
He comes from a rich family.
Why did he feel so insecure?

472
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:13,580
People tend to fixate on
what they don't have

473
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:16,457
than what they do have.

474
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,834
Uh, hello?

475
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,336
Okay. Are you sure?

476
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,380
Okay, got it.

477
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:26,801
Captain, Nam Junghyun's been located.
He's on his way to the airport.

478
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,637
He must've caught on
and moved up his flight.

479
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,014
Drive us to the airport, rookie.

480
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:32,599
- Okay.
- Step on it.

481
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,852
- What the…
- What happened?

482
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:37,228
It appears we got a flat tire.

483
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:42,275
I can't believe this.
Do we have a spare tire?

484
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:43,568
No, we don't.

485
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:45,278
Should we get a taxi?

486
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:46,696
I'll get us a new car.

487
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,615
From where?

488
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:51,326
A friend of mine lives
just five minutes away from here.

489
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,911
-What?
-Is it another friend of yours?

490
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,162
I'll be right back!

491
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,915
Damn this junker!

492
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:01,210
Where is he?
He said he'd be back with a car.

493
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:04,339
Maybe we should request a vehicle
from the nearest precinct.

494
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,507
-Got it.
-Try calling a taxi too.

495
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,217
What should we do with Tansik?

496
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:24,400
Get in!

497
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:25,777
What?

498
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:27,737
Whoa!

499
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,364
Okay.

500
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:44,462
It's so cramped in here.

501
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,007
Wait!
I'm getting a cramp in my leg!

502
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:50,134
-What? Your leg's cramping?
-My leg!

503
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:52,512
Try putting saliva on your nose.

504
00:32:58,768 --> 00:32:59,769
My chin hurts!

505
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:12,031
We're gaining on him!

506
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:13,533
-Isn't that his car?
-Is it?

507
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:15,368
-It is!
-4987! He's right there!

508
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:19,789
I'll block him.

509
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,089
- Whoa, whoa.
- We've got him. Whoa!

510
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,298
Make a right.

511
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:30,508
Jeez!

512
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:32,552
Does that bastard have a death wish?

513
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:37,974
That little…

514
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,311
Hey!

515
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:47,567
You're dead meat. Hey!

516
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,653
Roll down the window.
I said roll down the window!

517
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,657
-Pull ahead of him and block his car!
-Yes, sir.

518
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,244
Son of a…

519
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:03,750
How do we get out?

520
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,502
- I'm going to kill that bastard.
- Hey!

521
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:07,712
Come here…

522
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:09,547
-Nam Junghyun.
-Damn it!

523
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,715
Captain! No!

524
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:12,467
-Move!
-Captain!

525
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,052
- I can't get out!
- What should we do?

526
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,720
We're stuck!

527
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,308
Nam Junghyun!

528
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,192
Whoa!

529
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,444
-I'm seriously going to kill you.
-You should stop.

530
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:33,362
-Go away.
-I hate violence.

531
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:42,872
Whoa!

532
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:45,249
Why, you little…

533
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:55,093
It's opening up!

534
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:58,221
Finally! It's open! It's open!

535
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:00,264
-Where's Tansik? Is he okay?
-My neck hurts.

536
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,849
Why did he even join
the Violent Crimes Team

537
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,476
if his only experience is being Santa?

538
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:04,852
Santa? Santa Claus?

539
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,396
What do you think?
Is there any other Santa?

540
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,315
Why would he write that on his résumé?

541
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:11,651
It was Sanda, not Santa.
It's a martial art.

558
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,657
<i>We have no time to lose. Get up!</i>

559
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:01,868
<i>Get up. Get up!</i>

561
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,791
Stop right there!

562
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:23,598
That's Sanda!

563
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,683
That's it!

564
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,111
You leave me no choice.

565
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,947
I'll have to use force.

566
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:16,317
Nam Junghyun.

567
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:20,196
You're under arrest
for the murder of Yoon Haesik.

568
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:26,577
Detective Jang!

569
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:27,954
-Rookie!
-Wow!

570
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:29,538
Detective Jang!

571
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:30,873
Great job, rookie!

572
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,001
That was so cool!

573
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:59,151
Thanks, Tansik.
I'll call you when I get there.

574
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:02,446
Please do.
Be good to your aunt and study hard.

575
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:03,906
I will. One more thing.

576
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:10,204
Thank you for catching the killer.

577
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,874
You don't have to thank me.
I was just doing my job.

578
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:16,752
-It's cold. Get going.
-Okay.

579
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,798
Tansik, I've always wanted
to ask you this.

580
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,134
Why did you become a detective?

581
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:34,020
My father was one.

NICE RICE! TAN RESTAURANT IS MY FAVORITE!

585
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:59,837
Have some lotus roots.
You like them, right?

586
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:03,549
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

587
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,801
Please bring what I asked for earlier.

588
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:08,846
What did you ask them for?

589
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:10,806
This is our first date in ages.

590
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:14,685
Thank you.

591
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:18,981
Korean rice wine
is a worldwide sensation now.

592
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,066
Thanks.

593
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:25,571
I have to drive,
so I'm just going to sniff it.

594
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:26,864
Cheers.

595
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,992
Mmm… It smells nice.

596
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:33,579
I thought you were taking me
somewhere nicer.

597
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:35,331
Tan Restaurants are everywhere.

598
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:37,666
And why do you think that is?

599
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,751
Because it's that good.

600
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:42,296
Oh, I'll go wash my hands first.

601
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,926
Don't start the crabs without me.

602
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:48,928
-Fine.
-Dig in.

603
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:57,103
Huh?

604
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:06,112
He definitely has a big nose.

605
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:08,656
No way.

606
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,038
Huh.

607
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:17,915
It can't be.

-Nice job.
-Thank you.

612
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:48,571
- <i>Hold on.</i>
- Where did he go?

613
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:49,697
"Hahaha"

614
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,700
He's pumping out testosterone

615
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:54,118
Macho Joongryeok

616
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:56,120
He ends up laughing

617
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:58,205
- <i>Cut.</i>
- Cut!

618
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,498
I can't do this.

619
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:00,666
"Hahaha"

620
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:02,877
Does he think I'm that easy?

621
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:04,837
"Spraying!"

622
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,505
I'll try one more time.

00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:08,799
"Giggling"

624
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:10,384
Ow!

625
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,765
Sad thoughts, sad thoughts…

626
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:24,356
The human nose is one of the oldest
sensory organs…

627
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,192
I lost my flow. I have to try again.

628
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:27,735
Charges, then stops

629
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:28,819
What if I take these off?

630
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:30,779
No.

631
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,031
What about the beanie?

632
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,200
- Sure.
- Really?

633
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:36,285
- Yes.
- I'll take everything off.

634
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:37,369
I'm sorry.

635
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:40,122
Don't come back again, okay?

636
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:42,249
Whatever. I'll do what I want.

637
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,460
"Joongryeok, 41, imitates Donggoo, 7"

638
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:46,253
Whatever.

639
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,671
Sorry, sorry.

Yubin shakes his noodles vigorously

641
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,968
Also, it's okay if you pick it up
within five seconds.

642
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,136
Why are you laughing?

643
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:57,181
Giggling

644
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,183
Joongryeok is being mischievous!

645
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:03,229
Junghwan holds back his laughter

646
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:04,772
Hahaha

647
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,148
Ad-libbing

648
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:12,363
Vroom!

649
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:13,864
They walk as one team

650
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:15,157
Shall we see the bloopers?

651
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:16,867
Let's go.

652
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,456

We're engaged.

<i>I visited his place
because I couldn't reach him.</i>

661
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,978
<i>She got engaged without

662
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,604
<i>How is that even possible?</i>

663
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:47,982
<i>You can do that
when you're in love.</i>

664
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:49,775
<i>Because she loved him.</i>

665
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:51,402

667
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,073
- Hello.
- Sweet and sour pork.

668
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:57,700
It's really delicious.

669
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,495
Out of the way!

670
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:06,375
Will their investigation have
a happy ending?
