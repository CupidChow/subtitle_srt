00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,465
You little bastard!

3
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,014
-Enough of this.
-I didn't do it!

4
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:57,474
Sure you didn't.

5
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:08,151
Let go!

6
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,076
-You're under arrest for special larceny.
-Detective Seo!

7
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,494
What took you so long?

8
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,704
I'm sorry. I'll take it from here.

9
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:22,457
Ugh.

10
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,334
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

11
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:25,668
- Hold still!
- I'm sorry...

12
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,805
Jiseok.

13
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:44,729
It's been a while.

14
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,777
Hold still,
or you'll get hurt!

{\an8}EPISODE 11

16
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,659
<i>Hello.</i>
<i>Welcome to Youngeun's Knitting Studio.</i>

17
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,704
<i>I'm back with the giant velvet yarn.</i>

18
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,124
"Both the bag and the host are so pretty"

19
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,668
<i>This time, we're going to make</i>
<i>a simple cushion with this...</i>

20
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:07,919
I'm back.

21
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,295
You got him already?

22
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:11,339
Good work.

23
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,384
Why are you by yourself?
Where's Detective Seo?

24
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,803
She ran into an acquaintance
and is chatting with him.

25
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,304
She'll be back at the precinct soon.

26
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,890
An acquaintance? Who?

27
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,101
-Was his name Jinseop?
-It's Jiseok.

28
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,352
Right, Jiseok.

29
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,105
Wow! You have a good memory.

30
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,565
I may be lazy,

31
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,733
but I'm actually quite smart.

32
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,152
Oh!

33
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,072
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,198
Sorry about that.

35
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,034
Let me see. Who's this Jiseok?

36
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,161
Jiseok?

37
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:43,121
That ungrateful asshole?

38
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:44,998
Do you know him?

39
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:47,959
She used to date him
when she was a rookie officer.

40
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,711
She took such good care of him

41
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:51,504
when he was studying
for the civil servant exam,

42
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,131
but as soon as he passed it,
he dumped her.

43
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,382
That bastard.

44
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:57,886
Anyway, it's a long story.

45
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,429
- What story?
- What story?

46
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:04,434
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:09,606
Minseo, come to your senses, will you?

48
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:19,032
I had a feeling
we might cross paths someday,

49
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:22,160
but I didn't expect it
to be in the men's room.

50
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:27,040
Has it been about two years?

51
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,124
Well...

52
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,170
I guess so.

53
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:33,838
You have...

54
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:37,550
-something in your hair.
-My hair?

55
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,470
Oh.

56
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:44,766
You live in Sejong?

57
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,684
I got transferred to Seoul last year,

58
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:48,519
so I live here now.

59
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,650
Isn't it tough
working on the Violent Crimes Team?

60
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:58,446
It can be intense,
but I enjoy it. It's fun.

61
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:01,866
Then again,

62
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,076
it was your dream after all.

63
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:04,827
That's right.

64
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,926
I'm getting married to Soyeong.

65
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,472
This week.

66
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,188
I thought I should be the one to tell you.

67
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,608
Oh.

68
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,032
Congratulations.

69
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,493
There's no need for that.

70
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,495
What about you?

71
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:48,746
Are you seeing anyone?

72
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,416
What?

73
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,167
-You're not?
-I am.

74
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:54,544
You are?

75
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,629
-Who?
-Well...

76
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,549
There's this guy.

77
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:00,842
What does he do?

78
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:04,345
He...

79
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:06,597
He's a nice guy.

80
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:09,058
So what does that nice guy do?

81
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,394
-He and I...
-Work in the same field?

82
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:14,188
Yeah...

83
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,441
Sort of.

84
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,776
-So he's also in the force?
-I mean...

85
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,737
Is he on the same team as you?

86
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,489
- Yeah.
- That's great.

87
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:24,949
I've been worried about you.

88
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,243
You didn't have to be.

89
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,256
How did you know I love strawberries?

90
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,716
I didn't.

91
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,676
It just looked tasty.

92
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:45,928
You're lying.

93
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,184
Mmm.

94
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,727
It's so good.

95
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,896
Sweet and soft.

96
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,648
- Just like you.
- Anastasia.

97
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:01,527
I'm neither sweet nor soft.

98
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:02,779
You're lying again.

99
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,783
Your eyes give you away every time.

100
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,743
No, I'm good at lying.

101
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:10,244
My childhood nickname was Pinocchio.

102
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,539
-I'll get going.
-Wait.

103
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,917
You haven't replied to my text.

104
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,919
It was so long
I couldn't finish reading it.

105
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:20,088
Anyway, I like you.

106
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,465
Will you officially go out with me?

107
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,098
Do you remember our first date?

108
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:31,974
Yeah.

109
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:35,228
We had seaweed oyster rice soup together.

110
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,063
It was delicious.

111
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:38,856
I want you to remember me...

112
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,402
like seaweed oyster rice soup.

113
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,071
Hearty,

114
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:48,366
warm, and delightful.

115
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,828
But that's it.

116
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:53,871
Love isn't for me.

117
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,998
- Love is for everyone.
- Except for me.

118
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,127
People say...

119
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:01,963
love is like snow.

120
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,675
It's beautiful at first

121
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,219
but only gets muddy afterward.

122
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,181
That's how I view love.

123
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:14,934
I'll be off.

124
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,205
It's cold outside.

125
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:51,679
Joongryeok!

126
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,558
Watch out, sir!

127
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,393
- Sir.
- Hey!

128
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,020
Where do you live?

129
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:43,147
- Why do you need to know that?
- Sir!

130
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,733
I'll deal with him.

131
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:48,236
- Sir, sir!
- Hey.

132
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:49,820
Jiseok!

133
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,115
It's okay.

134
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,200
I'm sorry.

135
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:57,787
I love you too.

136
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:02,917
Jiseok.

137
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,545
Sorry to keep you waiting.
It's chaos today.

138
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,256
Don't worry. Take your time.

139
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,885
There's nothing I enjoy more
than waiting for you.

140
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,971
You're so sweet.

141
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,264
Should we go for some meat today?

142
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,015
-Meat?
-Yes.

143
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,768
Uh... It's pretty chilly today,

144
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:22,103
so how about some <i>tteokbokki?</i>

145
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,771
What does that
have to do with the cold?

146
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:25,106
I'm craving meat.

147
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,108
I'll go change real quick. Just a moment.

148
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:28,192
Wait...

149
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,112
Okay.

150
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:03,269
Where did you go in the middle of eating?

151
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:13,362
Here. You always complain
about indigestion after eating late.

152
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,157
Thanks. You're the best.

153
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,243
Oh! This looks done.

154
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,704
Here you go, Officer Seo Minseo.

155
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,289
It looks delicious.

156
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,043
After you.

157
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:29,378
Here.

158
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,006
- How is it? Good, right?
- Mmm!

159
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:37,011
Let's go for some beef
when I get paid next month.

160
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:40,264
No. Wait until I pass the exam,
and I'll treat you to beef.

161
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,349
Prime cuts?

162
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,684
Prime cuts it is.

163
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,562
SEOUL BUSTERS

164
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,524
The stolen car
Yoon Jihun used for burglary

165
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,651
was found in a nearby
supermarket parking lot.

166
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,904
The NFS is analyzing the dashcam footage.

167
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:40,199
They'll send us the enhanced footage
tomorrow at the earliest.

168
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,784
All right. Good work.

169
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,662
-Detective Jung, please see it through.
-Yes, sir.

170
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,956
Dating violence
is on the rise in our jurisdiction.

171
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,041
How are you dealing with that,
Detective Seo?

172
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:54,046
Detective Seo?

173
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,175
Uh...

174
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:01,095
You weren't listening.

175
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:02,430
I'm sorry, sir.

176
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,850
Detective Moo.

177
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,729
Detective Moo?

178
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,361
I have everything under control, sir.

179
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:21,866
Just because we're in a daycare center
doesn't mean you can act like kids.

180
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:24,577
Do I really need to remind you
to pay attention during meetings?

181
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,620
I'm sorry, sir.

182
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:30,124
I don't want any half-baked excuses
from either of you.

183
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,168
Sorry?

184
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,003
Wait, since there are two of you,

185
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,672
it must be a fully-baked excuse.

186
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:37,757
Oh!

187
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,843
A half-baked excuse from each of you
would add up to a fully-baked excuse,

188
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,429
just like when you double
the cooking time.

189
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:46,640
Captain, you crack me up.

190
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:47,808
It wasn't meant to be funny.

191
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,687
I know. Your joke was hilarious,
but it didn't make me laugh.

192
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,397
Anyway, pay attention, everyone.

193
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,065
Detective Seo,
how many dating violence cases

194
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,151
have there been
in our jurisdiction so far?

195
00:12:57,234 --> 00:13:00,863
Well... Can you hand me
that file over there?

196
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,698
The one on the left down there.

197
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,033
Yes, that one.

198
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,042
I need you to come quickly.

199
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,128
Someone's trying to break into my place.

200
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,255
Please hurry. Yes.

201
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:07,263
SONGWON POLICE STATION
HAS MOVED TO A TEMPORARY LOCATION

202
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,892
She's a stranger?

203
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,227
Are you sure?

204
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:14,979
I've never seen her before.

205
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,647
Did you say you live alone?

206
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,691
Yes, I live alone.

207
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:23,279
I found out that
she was living with my boyfriend.

208
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,866
We're engaged.

209
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,661
I visited his place
because I couldn't reach him,

210
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,082
and I found her there.

211
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,669
This doesn't add up.

212
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,588
She claims her boyfriend lives there,

213
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,464
but the victim lives alone,

214
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,341
and the guy was nowhere to be found.

215
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,469
Maybe she got
the wrong address or apartment.

216
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,430
That can't be it.

217
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:51,765
She even brought tools
to break open the door.

218
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,268
<i>That means it wasn't impulsive.</i>

219
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:56,353
She must've been
monitoring the victim for a while.

220
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,398
Then what should we do, sir?

221
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,775
What else?
There's nothing more to it.

222
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:05,112
She was caught in the act of
breaking and entering, so it's game over.

223
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,447
Should we hand her over right away?

224
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:09,867
Hmm...

225
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,332
Drink it while it's warm.

226
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,000
Thank you.

227
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,464
So you don't know your boyfriend's name

228
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,425
or what he looks like?

229
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:34,016
What made you believe
your boyfriend lived in that apartment?

230
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,645
He said it was provided

231
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,230
by the National Intelligence Service.

232
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,649
The National Intelligence Service?

233
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,735
He said it was confidential.

234
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:51,241
He explained that's why
I couldn't meet him even if I came over.

235
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,118
He just asked me to bring some items

236
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,455
and leave them at the door.

237
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:00,876
How did you two first meet?

238
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,381
We met on MyHeart.

239
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,049
<i>MyHeart? What's that?</i>

240
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,218
It's a dating app.

241
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,553
It's popular with young people.

242
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:15,641
So they met on the app?
Is that where she got his address?

243
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,476
She believed he lived in a safe house

244
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,561
-provided by the NIS.
-A safe house?

245
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,981
The Intelligence Service
isn't your neighborhood car service.

246
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,149
That's just too far-fetched.

247
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,944
She lives in a student apartment.
Is she looking for a job?

248
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,904
She's studying for the civil servant exam.

249
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,489
ACE THE EXAM AND
ENTER THE GOVERNMENT!

250
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,074
YOU'RE ALMOST THERE! YOU CAN DO THIS!

251
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,008
FEELING LONELY?
FIND YOUR MATCH ON MyHeart!

252
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,969
<i>She tried the dating app</i>
<i>out of curiosity.</i>

253
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,727
Hi! Wanna chat?

254
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,991
Hi

255
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:27,337
Huh?

256
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,803
<i>After dating online</i>
<i>for about a month,</i>

257
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:37,431
<i>they agreed to get married.</i>

258
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:42,686
She got engaged without
seeing his face or knowing his name?

259
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,813
Does she think marriage is a joke?

260
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,023
You can do that...

261
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,026
when you're in love.

262
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,321
How much money did she lose?

263
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,739
Around 400 million won.

264
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,199
400 million won?

265
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,326
Where did she get all that money?

266
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,787
She borrowed money from people
by making up excuses,

267
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,331
and she even took out private loans.

268
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,041
How is that even possible?

269
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,584
You can do that when you're in love.

270
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,128
Why are you going on about love?

271
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,839
Anyway, how did he ask her for money?

272
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,674
He told her that he was a secret agent

273
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,928
and that he lost some funds
for his operation.

274
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,763
He said he was going to inherit a fortune,

275
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:21,308
and they could move abroad together
once everything was settled.

276
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,476
Something like that.

277
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,061
I'm baffled.

278
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,813
How could she believe that?

279
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,356
Because she loved him!

280
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:35,572
Because she loved him.

281
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,994
As soon as she sent the money,
he ghosted her.

282
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,704
And when she visited his address,

283
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,457
she found another woman living there.
Is that it?

284
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,251
I hear a sound.

285
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,002
The sound of her world
crumbling around her.

286
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,963
It's a typical romance scam.

287
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,422
It's not going to be easy.

288
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:55,801
This is my case, so I'll see it through.

289
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,094
Sounds good.

290
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:00,097
Detective Moo, please assist her.

291
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,101
I have a lot on my plate. Why me?

292
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,936
Since you're an expert in love.

293
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,232
Do we know anything else?

294
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,693
They video chatted once.

295
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,489
<i>Things will settle down soon.</i>

296
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,491
<i>I miss you.</i>

297
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:22,870
<i>Oh.</i>

298
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:25,747
<i>I have to go. My boss needs me right away.</i>

299
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,291
This is a deepfake.

300
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:30,627
Non-experts may have trouble
discerning it,

301
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:35,048
but I actually have a degree
in AI.

302
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:40,262
So I ran an analysis on the video,

303
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:45,142
and this one frame had an error,

304
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,560
revealing another person's face.

305
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,854
No wonder victims get fooled.

306
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:53,942
It shows how difficult it is
to spot deepfake videos.

307
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,027
Hold on.

308
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:58,405
I think I've seen this video before.

309
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:02,993
Here it is.

310
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,370
Oh, I did it again.

311
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,955
I have such a good memory.

312
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:11,501
Actually, my IQ is over 160.

313
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,754
-You didn't know that, did you?
-No.

314
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:15,672
Take a look at this.

315
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,552
<i>We can meet</i>
<i>as soon as this gets sorted out.</i>

316
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:23,013
<i>I can't wait to see you.</i>

317
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,892
<i>-We--</i>
-The same frame has an error here too.

318
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,811
They must've used the same video.

319
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:34,149
This means they've been at it
since last year.

320
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,360
There have been similar cases
in other areas too.

321
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:39,029
- Please email me the files.
- Okay.

322
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,316
What's that?

323
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,319
It's chocolate. Do you want some?

324
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,779
No, thanks. I don't like sweets.

325
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:24,825
Yubin, chocolate makes
your brain work better.

326
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:27,119
Is that the sole reason you're eating it?

327
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:30,372
Absolutely.
It's just like taking medicine.

328
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,044
I'm learning psychological analysis
at the FBI these days.

329
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,170
I can tell when you're lying.

330
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:39,715
I mean it. Try one.

331
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,216
You'll see what I mean.

332
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:15,876
Granny!

333
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,377
Welcome.

334
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,838
One bowl of rice soup, please.
With a lot of offal.

335
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:21,006
Goodness.

336
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:24,009
Why haven't you had dinner yet?

337
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:25,260
We have a new case.

338
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,013
I just got off. I'm exhausted.

339
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,640
My goodness. Give me just a second.

340
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:37,689
Hey, your face is getting
thinner and thinner.

341
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:40,025
At this rate, it'll disappear soon.

342
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,362
-Eat more.
-Give me extra, please.

343
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:46,615
Mom, one bowl of rice soup, please.

344
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,700
You little brat! I'm not your mom!

345
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,535
Wouldn't it be great
if you had a son like me?

346
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,330
Detective Moo.

347
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,123
Minseo. You didn't go home?

348
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,333
I've been working on my case.

349
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,043
-You have?
-Yeah.

350
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:00,170
No matter how busy you are,
you should eat.

351
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,422
Definitely.

352
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:05,634
Hey, I heard you ran into Jiseok,
or whatever his name is.

353
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,971
How could you run into your ex

354
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,474
in the men's room?

355
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,935
What an ill-fated relationship.

356
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:18,897
Don't tell me
that rekindled your love or anything.

357
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:20,399
He's getting married.

358
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:25,737
Are you okay?

359
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,323
Ugh, come on. We broke up ages ago.

360
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,701
-Shall we drink some soju?
-Forget it.

361
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:32,994
-Let's drink.
-I quit drinking.

362
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,372
Mom, give us a bottle of soju!

363
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:36,915
I'm not going to drink!

364
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:41,211
That's the day we first met.

365
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:42,712
Was it?

366
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,550
If it hadn't been for me,
you would've been disciplined.

367
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:49,136
Still, I couldn't hold back.

368
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,805
Oh, you were incredible.

369
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,723
"You bastard!"

370
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:56,935
I thought you were out of your mind.

371
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,354
Too bad it's so cold.

372
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,690
It's okay. It's a bit warmer today.

373
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,024
Did you receive the picture?

374
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,193
He's supposed to show up
around here often.

375
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,736
-Please keep an eye out.
-Yes, sir.

376
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,531
I heard one of your colleagues
wants to join the Violent Crimes Team.

377
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,158
You're talking about Officer Seo.

378
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,161
She's right there.
I'm sure she'll do well.

379
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,163
Uh, she looks a bit weak.

380
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,833
I picked out the prettiest ones.

381
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,418
It even has our picture.

382
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,295
You know I...

383
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:27,090
Jiseok.

384
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:29,843
Jung Soyeong?

385
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,428
50 DAYS TOGETHER

386
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:34,389
Ugh!

387
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,975
You said you were going out of town
for a wedding.

388
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:38,852
Minseo, let's talk later.

389
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:41,146
Get out. Right now.

390
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:43,190
I said get out!

391
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,274
-Out!
-What are you doing?

392
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:45,984
-Soyeong, you crazy bitch!
-I'll get out.

393
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:47,694
- Get out right now!
- I will.

394
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:48,778
Look at that.

395
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,282
"50 days together"?

396
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:56,036
How long has this been going on? Huh?

397
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:58,455
It's not what you think it is.

398
00:24:58,538 --> 00:24:59,873
Hey!

399
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:02,083
How could you do this to me?

400
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,710
How dare you?

401
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:05,545
- Stop it! I get it!
- Hey!

402
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,380
You crazy bastard!

403
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,591
-Damn you!
-Do you think this has been easy for me?

404
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,969
I've been putting up with you
this whole time!

405
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,513
You're out of your mind.

406
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:25,524
Oh no!

407
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,742
Imagine you had tased a civilian, not me.

408
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,411
Then you wouldn't be here now.

409
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:42,791
I'm so grateful that I could cry,
Detective Moo.

410
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,961
I know.

411
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,255
You're not one to be ungrateful.

412
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,632
Definitely not. I know how to be grateful.

413
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:55,428
In return,
I'll fill your glass to the brim.

414
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,513
Here you go.

415
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:58,557
-Let me pour you one too.
-Sure.

416
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,184
- Love shot.
- Love shot?

417
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:20,870
Didn't you say
you almost got married once?

418
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:26,960
Don't be like that.
I want to hear about it.

419
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:30,005
It's a pathetic story.

420
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:36,886
Stop right there!

421
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:44,871
Excuse me.

422
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,540
Can you recommend a lotion for men?

423
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,167
You're bleeding.

424
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,673
Here.

425
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,351
Uh...

426
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:07,519
If I may ask...

427
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:11,064
what's your name?

428
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:12,816
Me?

429
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:20,490
Joongryeok.

430
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:23,910
I asked around,
and she seems to be single.

431
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:27,288
- Anything else?
- Anything else?

432
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:29,332
She's a fan of Byun Jinsub.

433
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,543
Byun Jinsub? What does she like about him?

434
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:32,919
I have no idea.

435
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:34,587
Anyway, she's a huge fan.

436
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,340
Okay. Hold this.

437
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:39,008

COOPERATIVE FALL PICNIC

441
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,950
I'm sorry, but may I go first?

442
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:06,453
- Sure.
- Thank you.

443
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,665
- I've never seen him before.
- Hello.

444
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,501
Congratulations on your picnic.

445
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,920
Uh, I don't own a shop
in the shopping mall,

446
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:19,507
but I'd like to sing a song for you
as your customer.

447
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:20,592
A round of applause, please!

448
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:24,220
I love you all.

Why does anyone break up, really?

463
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:54,435
You see...

464
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,896
it's a long story.

465
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:00,900
- Detective Moo.
- What?

466
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,193
I have to go.

467
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,696
In the middle of drinking?

468
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:08,950
I asked them to look into
the bank accounts in Hyebin's case,

469
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,785
and they're already finished.

470
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,496
You're off duty now. Just stay.

471
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,498
I just feel so bad for her.

472
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,542
Let's drink one last shot.

473
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,085
All right.

474
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,045
Cheers.

475
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:22,922
Let's just drink.

476
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,179
-You should get going.
-I'm off.

477
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,140
Thanks for the drinks.

SHIT WELL DAYCARE CENTER

484
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:44,689
SONGWON POLICE STAITON HAS MOVED
TO A TEMPORARY LOCATION

485
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:51,738
All the accounts Hyebin sent money to
were under borrowed names.

486
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:54,991
The money she sent
was withdrawn right away.

487
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:57,827
That must mean he had accomplices.

488
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:00,955
The money was withdrawn
in these neighborhoods in Yeongdeungpo.

489
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,124
The only account with any money left
is Account D.

490
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,251
I'm sure it'll also be withdrawn soon.

491
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:09,005
If the perp used ATMs,
there should be CCTV footage.

492
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:10,465
Not really.

493
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,843
His face was all covered,
so you don't see anything.

494
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:16,679
Hold on.

495
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:20,183
There's something
on the back of his hand.

496
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:22,185
-What's that?
-I see dark spots.

497
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:24,729
Those aren't spots.
It looks like a tattoo.

498
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:26,522
Isn't that Fubao?

499
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,733
A hobo? Don't be ridiculous.

500
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:31,235
Who would want a hobo
tattooed on their hand?

501
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,445
<i>Not a hobo.</i>

502
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:34,405
<i>Don't you know Fubao, the cute panda?</i>

503
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,494
Who cares whether he has a tattoo
of a panda or a hobo?

504
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,704
We still don't know
where he'll show up next.

505
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,539
Can you show me the map again?

506
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,375
Hmm...

507
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:47,752
I think I see a pattern.

508
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,880
He didn't use
any of the ATMs at the banks.

509
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:54,300
He only used convenience store ATMs
next to major streets

510
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:56,719
where he could pull up his car.

511
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,846
And he never used the same ATM twice.

512
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,641
That should narrow down our options.

513
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:04,852
That leaves us with those three, right?

514
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,562
Yes. Let's start from there.

515
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:10,566
Hello.

516
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,568
We're from Sojanggak.
Try our sweet and sour pork.

517
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:13,778
Sweet and sour pork!

518
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:15,029
It's really delicious.

519
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,572
Hello.

520
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:18,533
- Try our sweet and sour pork.
- Forget it!

521
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:21,911
Take it easy. Why are you trying so hard?

522
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:24,747
Those who hand out flyers
are usually very enthusiastic.

523
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:28,084
Are you running a restaurant for real?
Are you a chef or something?

524
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,293
I won't do it again.

525
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,463
Hello!

526
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:34,882
Oh!

527
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:36,467
Excuse me.

528
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:37,844
Is this place any good?

529
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:40,721
I don't know.

530
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:43,933
What? How can you not know
if you're promoting it?

531
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:45,476
I've never tried their food.

532
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,853
What's with the attitude?

533
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,650
-You're so damn honest.
-What? Come here.

534
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:54,193
Let it go, Detective Moo.

535
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:56,863
May I have a flyer too?

536
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,407
Go away, kid.

537
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,450
-I want one.
-Go away!

538
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,119
Here you go. Now, leave.

539
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,456
- Go already!
- Is this true?

540
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,876
Can I get free sweet and sour pork
if I bring 10 people?

541
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,210
What?

542
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,379
It says so here.

543
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:15,715
"Bring 10 people,
and you get free sweet and sour pork."

544
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:17,008
Yeah, sure.

545
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,844
Free sweet and sour pork sure sounds nice.

546
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:21,137
Okay.

547
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,388
Don't come back.

548
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:23,681
Jesus or hell.

549
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:25,892
- I'm a Buddhist.
- Buddha, give us peace.

550
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:27,560
Jesus or hell.

551
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,650
Jesus or hell.

552
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:39,280
I'm sorry, ma'am,

553
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:42,074
but could you check
if I can use my reward points here?

554
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,576
We don't accept reward points.

555
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:44,869
I bet I can use them.

556
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:47,163
It says here I can get a 500-won discount.

557
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:50,124
I said we don't accept reward points!

558
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,667
Why do you keep saying no?

559
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,544
- Are you sure about this?
- Stop it!

560
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:59,050
Hey!

561
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:00,801
Gosh, you surprised me.

562
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:03,221
You look so real.

563
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,514
So do you. It's incredible.

564
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:06,641
Really?

565
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,351
"Jesus or hell."

566
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,853
What are you doing here?

567
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:13,064
The ATM over there is out of order.

568
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:14,941
I'm going to take a lap and call it a day.

569
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,734
Ugh, you're slacking off. As usual.

570
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:18,361
What are you talking about?

571
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:21,405
Give me something to drink.
I'm thirsty.

572
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:23,991
That'll be 10,000 won.

573
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,534
No way. I have reward points.

574
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,621
- Look!
- What's with you?

575
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:31,999
I can't believe you.

576
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,086
I'll pay you later.

577
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,837
Jesus or hell.

578
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,798
Jesus or hell.

579
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,176
ATM

580
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,180
This isn't going anywhere.
Let's call it a day.

581
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:48,641
-After I hand out the rest.
-What are you talking about?

582
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:50,142
-This is just a cover!
-I'm sorry.

583
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:51,978
-Pull yourself together.
-I will.

584
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:54,480
- Sweet and sour...
- Pork!

585
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:56,983
- Sweet and sour pork!
- Sweet and sour pork!

586
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,776
-What's up with those kids?
-That's Donggoo.

587
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,403
He brought other kids along.

588
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,738
Sweet and sour pork!

589
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:06,117
- Sweet and sour pork!
- Why, you little...

590
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,869
-Sweet and sour pork!
-Go away!

591
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:11,872
- Sweet and sour pork!
- Go away! Go!

592
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,709
Sweet and sour pork! Sweet and sour pork!

593
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,627
Sweet and sour pork!

594
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:19,088
Sweet and sour pork! Sweet and sour pork!

595
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:22,008
Sweet and sour pork! Sweet and sour pork!

596
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:24,510
-Sweet and sour pork!
-You're mistaken.

597
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:26,679
- Sweet and sour pork!
- Please be quiet.

598
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:29,307
Sweet and sour pork! Sweet and sour pork!

599
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,725
What's that over there?

600
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,101
Run! What are you waiting for?

601
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,317
Sweet and sour pork!

602
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,528
SONGWON POLICE STATION

603
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:46,574
Come on in, Captain Dongbang.

604
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:49,410
-He's our ace. Ace.
-Good to see you.

605
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,996
You know Professor Sim, right?

606
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:56,042
This is a producer
from the broadcasting station.

607
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,585
I've heard a lot about you.

608
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:00,171
I'm Kim Jimin, the producer
of <i>Remaking of Crime.</i>

609
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:02,673
It's a pleasure.

610
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,633
Let's have a seat and chat.

611
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:08,804
What's this about?

612
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:17,229
We're back.

613
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:18,564
Any progress?

614
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:20,441
Progress, my foot.

615
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,234
Such a waste of time and energy.

616
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:26,030
Jeez. Donggoo, that little brat
won't give me a break.

617
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:27,239
What about him?

618
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:29,950
Hey, I heard your ATM is out of order.
That's great.

619
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,410
Team up with him from tomorrow.

620
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,537
-Sorry?
-What are you talking about?

621
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:34,914
I have a ton of cases to work on.

622
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:38,292
Hey, since when did our team
become so lax?

623
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,668
Don't you worry!

624
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:40,920
I'll take up the slack.

625
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:44,340
If Detective Jung is busy,
I'll go out alone starting tomorrow.

626
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:45,508
I can't trust you.

627
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:47,301
-Just sit back down.
-Okay.

628
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,637
Jeez. What is it now?

629
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,223
You can't barge in here like this, ma'am!

630
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:54,058
Who said you could come in?

631
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:56,352
-Thank you.
-That's Detective Seo.

632
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:57,436
Minseo?

633
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,981
Ta-da.

634
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,525
Wow!

635
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:04,985
-Are you kidding me?
-I want one with pills.

636
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,112
Come on.

637
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:08,406
Yes, that one.

638
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,202
This way, please.

639
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:16,122
Is this really the place?

640
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:19,041
- Oh!
- Come on in.

641
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:29,260
Please say hello.
