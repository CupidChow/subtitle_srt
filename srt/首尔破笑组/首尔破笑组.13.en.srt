Captain.

00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:57,849
What's all this blood?

4
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:02,020
Why are you licking that?

5
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,188
It smelled sweet.

6
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:05,440
- What?
- It tastes sweet too.

7
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:07,150
It must be Strawberry Berry Bonbonbon.

8
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,152
Strawberry what?

9
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:12,072
It's an ice cream.
It's popular with teenagers.

10
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,364
Oh.

11
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,867
- Did you get a statement?
- There was nothing noteworthy.

12
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,120
The elderly man lives alone
and works as a custodian.

13
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,498
He came home from work and found this.

14
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,832
Hmm...

15
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,626
- What's this?
- What happened?

16
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,795
Apparently, it's Strawberry Bonbonbon.

17
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:29,297
Those punks made a total mess!

18
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,132
They even smoked and ate instant noodles.

19
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:33,885
- Who did this?
- It's Badger.

20
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:43,061
What? A badger did this?

21
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:45,730
Judging by the robust scent of kelp,

22
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,441
I bet they ate Badger instant noodles.

23
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:51,319
Hey, stop sniffing around
and go finish interviewing the witnesses.

24
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:53,571
Okay. I'll do my best.

25
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,615
Go on. Hurry. Go already.

26
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,910
What's missing is 20,000 won in cash

27
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:01,079
and a transit card with 30,000 won on it.

28
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:05,416
So the victim only lost 50,000 won?

29
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,584
Exactly.

30
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,337
There's no sign of forced entry,
and the entrance is undamaged.

31
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,506
Maybe the old man
left the door open.

32
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:14,008
People can be forgetful at his age.

33
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,094
It's an electronic lock,
it locks automatically.

00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,347
What's Captain doing?

35
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,228
He's doing that again.

36
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,194
There's nothing in the room.

37
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,523

Hmm. I bet a nearby convenience store
reported a theft.

00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:13,610
Check the CCTVs
to see if the thief was that boy.

Are you suspecting
the middle schooler upstairs?

How would he
have known the passcode?

We'll catch the culprit soon.

Can I get back what I've lost?

65
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:50,313
I really need it back.

66
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,650
It's my transit card.

67
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,193
- A transit card?
- Yes.

68
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:58,321
It has a picture of my daughter on it.

69
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,326
I'll make sure you get it back.

We're busy as it is.

76
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,431
Do we have to bother with 50,000 won?

77
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,351
It's not just 50,000 won.
It's trespassing plus special larceny.

78
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,894
The amount doesn't matter.

79
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,604
What I mean is,

80
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:35,066
I don't see why we had to come
all the way here over 50,000 won.

81
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,860
Would you stop
going on about 50,000 won?

you owe me 50,000 won, don't you?

Don't glare at me like that.
It looks like your eyes will pop out.

89
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,045
Fine, I'll even pay interest.

90
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,422
Give it to me right now.

91
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:00,633
I don't have it. I'll pay you later.

92
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:03,011
You dismiss 50,000 won,
yet you don't even have that much?

93
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,929
Can you lend me 50,000 won?
I'll pay you back.

94
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,848
I never have that much cash on me.

95
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,891
You're seriously pathetic.

96
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,977
Captain, can I borrow 50,000 won?
I'll pay you back.

97
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,354

99
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,904
Captain, how did you do that back there?

100
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,573
What do you mean?

101
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,534
I mean, you took a quick look
around the scene

102
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:29,454
and started recounting
everything that happened

103
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:30,872
like some sort of psychic.

104
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:32,040
Oh?

105
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,042
You could call it deduction.

106
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,044
Are you familiar with crossword puzzles?

107
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,797
Yeah, I used to do the crossword puzzles
in sports newspapers.

108
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,090
It's similar to that.

109
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,509
Think of it as a crossword puzzle.

110
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,721
You use the fragmentary clues
found at the scene

111
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:49,182
to fill in the blanks.

112
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,934
I see.
I used to be so good at those things.

113
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,854
You? No way.

114
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:56,230
Are you looking down on me?

115
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,566
I was the spelling champion of Gwanak-gu.

116
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:01,110
Cut it out, dumbass.

117
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,113
What did you just say?

118
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,615
He's talking in his sleep.

119
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,325
He's completely passed out.

120
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,619
Times sure have changed.

121
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:13,081
How is it that our rookie is sleeping
in the back seat while I'm driving?

122
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,707
Get over it.

123
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,042
Just focus on driving.

124
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,211
I don't think he's asleep.

125
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:21,214
If he is, how come everything
he's saying makes sense?

126
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:24,509
Shame on you. You're picking a fight
with a sleeping person.

127
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:27,261
Shut up, cheapskate.
Just go save up those nickels and dimes.

00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:32,767

Hey, calm down.

131
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,771
He's asleep. He's talking in sleep.

132
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:39,690
He's being a know-it-all again.
He's so full of himself.

- What?

- Are you up?
- Yes.

137
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,825
- Did you sleep or not?
- I didn't.

138
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,202
- You didn't?
- You didn't?

139
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:53,037
- No.
- Did you call me a dumbass?

140
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:56,874
- I bought my place by saving.
- Am I a cheapskate?

Never mind. Go wash up.
I'll set the table.

We're going to bust your dad
no matter what.

178
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,217
Heard about Minseo's dad?

179
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:56,178
- What about him?
- You don't know? He's a wanted man.

180
00:09:56,262 --> 00:10:01,183
- What?
- Yeah. He's the Master Thief on the news.

181
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,103
He is? No way!

182
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,564
I did always get bad vibes from her.

183
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:07,648
I know.

184
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,992
How shameless.

185
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,715
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

186
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,050
Three years ago,

187
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:38,012
they made a database of cold cases
at headquarters.

188
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:40,097
They're determined
to make progress from now on.

189
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,475
And it seems like
they'll put me in charge.

190
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,310
That's great.

191
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,228
I could also cover it on my show.

192
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,773
I'd love to get you on board
before anything else,

193
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,024
but I know you'd say no.

194
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,443
I could really use some help.

195
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:59,283
Hmm. The TV crew will be here
to shoot inserts soon.

196
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:01,327
I'm amazed.

197
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,371
Hmm? At what?

198
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:06,540
I never imagined
you'd enjoy being on TV so much.

199
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,001
I thought I knew you so well...

200
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,628
but apparently not.

201
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,171
It's not that I enjoy it.

202
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,673
I have no choice.

203
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,633
I wasn't criticizing you.

204
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:18,094
Anyway, please take a look at those cases.

205
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,845
Any advice would be helpful.

206
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,723
I'm not sure I'll have time.
We're busier than you think.

207
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,643
I didn't mean
you were slacking off or anything.

208
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,770
Hmm! One of the cases

209
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:31,399
involves stalking and kidnapping.

210
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,192
The suspect hasn't been identified yet.

211
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,236
Remind you of anybody?

212
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,988
It makes me think of Han Junho.

213
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:41,826
The crime was committed
in his neighborhood too.

CHUNGWOONSANSUDO THEFT CASE

222
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:42,303
Don't tell me
you're asking me a favor.

223
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:43,763
A favor, my foot.

224
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,474
Then are these noodles a bribe?

225
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,435
I'm not sure
if this is within my jurisdiction.

226
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,061
Just take it regardless.

227
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:54,398
The victim is my kid's old teacher.

228
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,359
I used to be your teacher too.

229
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:00,571
You were still wet behind the ears
when you first came to me.

230
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,491
And now, you act like you're all that.

231
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,911
I still look up to you
as a professor.

232
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,371
But not as the commissioner?

233
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,290
So it's a theft case.

234
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,375
Don't change the subject, you little brat.

235
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,629
And it took place
in a locked room.

236
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:19,548
That's why
I'm asking you to take it.

237
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,134
Something about this case...

238
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,304
...doesn't feel right.

239
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,891
If I manage to solve this one,

240
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,519
please reward my team generously.

241
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,103
Reward, my foot.

242
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,776
The victim's name
is Kim Jongsoo.

243
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,653
He's a history professor
at Hanguk University.

244
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:43,531
He's been collecting antique art
for a long time,

245
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,991
so he has many valuable artworks
in his house.

246
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,410
One of them was stolen recently.

247
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,037
Only one painting was stolen?

248
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,748
Is the perp cautious or timid?

249
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,124
Isn't that ridiculous?

250
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:58,671
This is <i>Chungwoonsansudo,</i>
the stolen artwork.

251
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:01,173
It had been taken overseas
during Japanese rule,

252
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,384
but Professor Kim raised funds
to recover it

253
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,469
and was going to donate it to a museum.

254
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:06,637
How much is it worth?

255
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,848
The market price is over a billion won.

256
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:11,934
- A billion won?
- It was the last artwork

257
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,686
created by the master painter Kim Sangjik

258
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:16,480
during the mid-Joseon period
before he died in exile.

259
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,607
You can't put a price on it.

260
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:21,235
Then the victim must've kept it
in a safe place.

261
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:23,779
He has a dedicated room for artwork
in his house.

262
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:27,241
You need to enter a passcode to access it.

263
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,326
There was no sign of forced entry,

264
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,995
but only the painting disappeared.

265
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,956
So only his family knew the passcode.

266
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,043
Guys, let's go.

267
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,128
Yes, sir!

268
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,462
Minseo, get ready.

269
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,631
I have to finish up
the Jinju Apartments case.

270
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,009
I'm waiting for the convenience store
to call.

271
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:46,677
Which case?

272
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,972
Is that the one where some kids
broke into an old man's apartment?

273
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,141
- Yeah.
- Oh! The 50,000-won case.

274
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,684
Rookie, didn't I put you in charge?

275
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,394
Detective Seo wanted to take charge.

276
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,396
He can't handle it alone.

277
00:14:57,479 --> 00:15:00,941
I'm almost done,
so I'll join you as soon as I can. Sorry.

278
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,818
Why waste your time
on such a trivial case?

279
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,945
No case is more important than others.

280
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,822
All cases are equal.

281
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,408
Still, we need to prioritize.

282
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,285
- If Captain finds out...
- I gave her permission.

283
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,497
Are you prioritizing a 50,000-won case
over a billion-won case?

284
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,208
No case is more important than others.
All cases are equal.

285
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,835
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

286
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,589
No case
is more important than others...

287
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,884
All cases are equal...

00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,753

298
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,716
Wow!

299
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,265
Thank you.

300
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,607
- Is that right?
- I have no idea.

301
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,903
That's piping hot.

302
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,990
Tea tastes best when drunk from a bowl.

303
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:36,370
Can you get me another cooling bowl?

304
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,539
Why do you need another?

305
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,293
Please try it.

306
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:44,670
Ah...

307
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:50,092
It's a Chinese tea called Biluochun.
It has such a beautiful aroma.

308
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:54,013
Oh, this tastes way better than green tea.

309
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,431
What kind of tea is Biluochun?

310
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:57,474
It's a type of green tea.

311
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:58,892
I see.

312
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,310
Uh...

313
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:03,230
When did you last see the stolen painting?

314
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:05,149
Three or four days ago.

315
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:07,359
I was preparing to mount it.

316
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,653
So it wasn't framed yet?

317
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,613
No, it was in a tube.

318
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,657
Who knows the passcode?

319
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:17,953
My wife and I are the only ones
who know it.

320
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,497
The culprit is someone
who knows the passcode.

321
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,041
So the culprit is...

322
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:24,668
either him or his wife?

323
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,171
I heard you have a daughter.

324
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,422
Does she know the passcode?

325
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:31,341
My daughter and her husband
have no interest in art at all.

326
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,844
By the way, the window
in that room is open.

327
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:35,679
Do you always keep it open?

328
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,848
No, I only open it occasionally
for ventilation.

329
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,266
Why do you ask?

330
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:40,642
It's nothing.

331
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,531
We haven't found any leads.

332
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:58,285
Apparently, it cost a fortune
to reinforce this door.

333
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,163
This is more of a vault than a room.

334
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,171
Look at you.

335
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,633
Why are you posing like that?

336
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:15,135
<i>Captain,
how did you do that back there?</i>

337
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,970
You could call it deduction.

338
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,848
You use the fragmentary clues
found at the scene...

339
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:23,227
- <i>Use fragmentary clues...</i>
- ...to fill in the blanks.

340
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,229
<i>...to fill in the blanks.</i>

341
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,774
<i>Focus, Moo Joongryeok.</i>

342
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,777
<i>If Captain can do it, you can too.</i>

343
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,863
<i>I need to trust
my extensive field experience.</i>

344
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,044
<i>This apartment is too high up
to access by scaling the wall.</i>

345
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,297
<i>The window is too small
for a person to pass through.</i>

346
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,133
<i>What if the culprit isn't human?</i>

347
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:57,052
<i>What kind of being, not human,
could access this height</i>

348
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,971
<i>and move freely?</i>

349
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,890
<i>What could it be?</i>

350
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,642
<i>It must be...</i>

351
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:14,444
PIGEON

352
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,895
What are you doing?

353
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,521
- What's wrong?
- It really worked.

354
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:53,150
Junghwan,
I think I know who the culprit is.

355
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,693
The culprit? Who is it?

356
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:56,820
A pigeon.

357
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,698
- A pigeon?
- Yes.

358
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,243
I once saw on the news
that someone trained pigeons

359
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,537
to steal valuables.

360
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,831
Pigeons were also used in war.

361
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:10,792
The culprit must be a trained pigeon.

362
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:14,004
A pigeon flew in through the window

363
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:15,547
and stole the painting?

364
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:16,757
Right, right.

365
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,551
While coo-cooing?

366
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,261
That's right.

367
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,222
Are you going cuckoo?

368
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,265
Everything's already crazy enough.
Get it together.

369
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,976
Look, Junghwan.
The thing about pigeons is

370
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,938
they aren't as dumb as we think.

371
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:47,162
Don't resent him too much.

372
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,623
He's still our dad.

373
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,710
Enough.

374
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,634
He's refusing to apply for parole,

375
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,679
although he's been eligible
for two years already.

376
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:08,058
Mom thinks he's worried
he'll get in your way.

377
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,687
He doesn't realize times have changed.

378
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:15,816
You're not coming, right?

379
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,193
See you.

380
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:35,627
CONGRATUATIONS ON GRADUATING

381
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:39,172
- Here we go. Three, two, one.
- Okay, hurry up.

382
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:40,924
Hi, guys.

383
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,050
- Hi, Hyunseo.
- Hi.

384
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,428
- I'll join you guys in a bit.
- Okay, we'll go ahead.

385
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:45,762
- Make it quick.
- Got it.

386
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,224
- You're finally graduating.
- Oh.

387
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,268
Congratulations.

388
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:52,936
Thanks.

389
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,689
Too bad Mom couldn't make it.

390
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:58,358
Why can't she close her shop
even for a day?

391
00:21:58,442 --> 00:21:59,443
Forget it.

392
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:02,195
Hey, this is too small.
Everyone else got big ones.

393
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:03,905
I'm broke.

394
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:19,296
<i>Seo, also known as the Master Thief,</i>

395
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:22,341
<i>was arrested near Seodaemun
this afternoon.</i>

396
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,593
<i>After evading capture
for over three years,</i>

397
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:28,138
<i>he was finally apprehended
by the persistent efforts of the police...</i>

398
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,596
Coo...

399
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,064
Gosh, look at you.

400
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,108
- You know what I think?
- Hey!

401
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:23,193
You should've become an actor,
not a detective.

402
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:25,487
Hey, I'm investigating. Turn that off.

403
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:29,658
No way.
I'll replay this whenever I feel down.

404
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,744
Hey, stop fooling around
and erase that right now.

405
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:35,622
Why are you so upset? Fine, I'll erase it.

406
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,666
In my imagination.

407
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,459
- Come here.
- Fine, I get it!

408
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,715
- Damn it!
- Hey!

409
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,426
What are we going to do...

410
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,428
If the painting is worth a billion won,

411
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,430
how much would this be worth?

412
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:55,142
Hey, what are you going to do now?

413
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,269
It's all your fault.

414
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:58,770
What are you talking about?

415
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,272
You're the one to blame for this!

416
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:02,607
You knocked it over with your butt!

417
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:05,610
It wouldn't have happened
if you hadn't been fooling around!

418
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,028
It's all your fault.

419
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,572
You're being...

420
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,783
...ridiculous, Lieutenant Moo.

421
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,118
"Lieutenant Moo"?

422
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:14,494
Yes, Lieutenant Moo.

423
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:17,747
You're the one who knocked it over.
Why are you blaming me?

424
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,541
I can't believe you.

425
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,293
I'm just stating the facts.

426
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:22,836
Hey, I don't care.

427
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,088
Let's split the cost evenly.

428
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,465
What do you mean, split the cost?

429
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,425
I'm not okay with that.

430
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:32,220
Have you always been this heartless?

431
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,347
I've never been a pushover.

432
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,266
Fine. I'll take care of it, okay?

433
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:37,559
We're strangers now.

434
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:40,353
No matter how empty your life is,

435
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:42,022
you shouldn't be so stingy.

436
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:43,440
Empty, stingy, I don't care.

437
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:46,902
I'm just gonna take it easy,
so you take care of it, Lieutenant Moo.

438
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,111
Why you little...

439
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,823
What's taking you so long?

440
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,120
What happened here? Whoa!

441
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,791
What happened
to my precious white porcelain?

442
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:02,959
What have you done?

443
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,628
What are you going to do now?

444
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:05,712
H-How much is it worth?

445
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:08,340
This is at least 20 million won.

446
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,302
My goodness.

447
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:14,930
Junghwan, let's split the cost.

448
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:46,044
Catch that fur!

449
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,949
Captain, why are you so desperate
to catch that fur?

450
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,289
Welcome.

451
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:24,457
- Ring me up, please.
- Okay.

452
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,418
- Do you need a bag?
- [No need. Just hurry up please.

453
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:27,711
- That'll be 9,000 won.
- Okay.

454
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:28,878
- Place your card here.
- Okay.

455
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,048
"Insufficient funds."
Do you have another card?

456
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,133
Try again.

457
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:34,801
- But...
- Just try again.

458
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,971
- It says the same thing.
- Is the machine broken?

459
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:39,723
- If you have another card...
- What's the issue?

460
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:42,183
- Do you have another?
- I have money. What's wrong?

461
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:45,770
- It says "insufficient funds."
- Try again. Is this your first day?

462
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:47,814
- No. Do you have another card?
- Are you new?

463
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:50,525
I don't understand
why it's not working all of a sudden.

464
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:51,901
Forget it. I'm not buying.

465
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:55,697
Hey.

466
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,198
We got a lot.

467
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,491
Nice job!

468
00:26:58,575 --> 00:26:59,826
Hi.

469
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:01,077
You're Park Jihu, right?

470
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:04,748
I'm from the Songwon Police. Hi.

471
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,708
- Run!
- Run!

472
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:11,254
- Some loyal friends you have.
- Okay, okay!

473
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:13,632
- I haven't turned 14 yet.
- Oh...

474
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:14,841
Ugh.

475
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:16,051
You can't punish me.

476
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:19,512
I know. You're too young
to face criminal punishment.

477
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:22,766
But I've looked into your history.

478
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:25,060
Theft, trespassing,

479
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,020
and even driving without a license.

480
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,189
You're a habitual offender.

481
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:32,651
You'll be placed
on a high level of probation.

482
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,362
So what?

483
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:38,615
The stuff you stole
from your downstairs neighbor.

484
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:40,617
What did you do with it?

485
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,785
It was chump change.

486
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:45,038
Do you want to ruin your life
over chump change?

487
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:46,873
You see,

488
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:51,252
I'm the best at my precinct
when it comes to screwing crooks' lives.

489
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:55,215
All I stole was 20,000 won in cash.

490
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:57,467
- I already spent it.
- Anything else?

491
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,135
There was a transit card.

492
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:02,263
I sold it to a guy at the station
for 10,000 won.

493
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,848
- A man? Who?
- How should I know?

494
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:05,767
It was just some random man.

495
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:07,352
Ugh.

496
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:08,561
That's it, I swear.

497
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:10,647
- Can I go now?
- Hold on.

498
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:12,732
Where do you think you're going?

499
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:17,195
Whether you're underage or not,
if you've done something wrong...

500
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:18,488
Wow.

501
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,532
You must pay for it, don't you think?

502
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,201
Come here, you little brat.

503
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:24,828
Go in.

504
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:50,019
<i>Personal loans for full-time
employees for up to 200 million won.</i>

505
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:52,021
Good luck.

506
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,608
Det. Jang, what did
the National Forensic Service say?

507
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:57,444
They'll have the results
by tomorrow morning.

508
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,821
You can all go home now.

509
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,823
- We'll be busy starting tomorrow.
- Yes, sir.

510
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,511
<i>Can I get back what I've lost?</i>

511
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,388
<i>It's my transit card.</i>

512
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:26,723
A transit card?

513
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:29,392
It has a picture of my daughter on it.

514
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:36,316
Detective Seo, why are you still here?

515
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,027
I'm working on the Jinju Apartments case.

516
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,946
The boy said he sold the transit card
to someone at the subway station,

517
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,281
so I'm tracking the buyer.

518
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:44,741
Isn't the case already solved?

519
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:46,367
- Why are you tracking the buyer?
- Well...

520
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:51,623
The transit card
meant a lot to the victim,

521
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:53,208
and I promised I'd get it back to him.

522
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,753
You should know by now

523
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:59,130
that such promises are rarely kept.

524
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:01,090
I do.

525
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:05,470
Still, I want to do my best.

526
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:10,892
The ability to empathize with a victim
can be a strength for a detective,

527
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,268
but it can also be a weakness.

528
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:16,189
Sometimes, you fail to see things
that are too close to you.

529
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:18,608
Understood.

530
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,488
Captain!

531
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,867
It was too close to you, wasn't it?

532
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,869
Don't stay too long.

533
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:32,121
Got it. See you.

534
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,726
SHIT WELL DAYCARE CENTER

535
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:57,814
APPLY FOR A LOAN

536
00:30:57,897 --> 00:30:59,774
Professor Kim asked you
to cover the damage?

537
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,693
He even sent an appraisal.

538
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,487
You'd think rich people would be generous.

539
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,239
That's too bad.

540
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,241
You've got this.

541
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,328
I'll chip in if you want.

542
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:13,538
Do you have some money?

543
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:15,039
Of course.

544
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:17,083
I have about 500,000 won.

545
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,919
Forget it. Thanks for the offer though.

546
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,922
At least you're not like some jerk I know.

547
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,800
Hey, Joongryeok!

548
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,010
Joongryeok!

549
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,721
What are you up to?

550
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:32,891
I put my house up for sale yesterday!
And I'm looking into loans!

551
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,767
Why would you do that?

552
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:36,769
That white porcelain was a knockoff.

553
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:37,854
- What?
- A knockoff?

554
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:39,314
What are you talking about?

555
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:40,773
It's worth only 50,000 won.

556
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:43,234
You're okay now, Joongryeok.

557
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,529
I'll pay for half of it.

558
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,823
Come on, pay a little more. He's crying.

559
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,535
Fine, since you've been
so stressed about it,

560
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,495
I'll pay 30,000 won.
You just pay 20,000 won.

561
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:57,415
There you go. You're the best.

562
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:58,791
Are you crying?

563
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:01,878
It's okay, Joongryeok.

564
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:04,047
- Stop crying.
- Detective Moo.

565
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,506
Whoa! Hold on!

566
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,717
- Stop it!
- Let go!

567
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,677
It was a knockoff, Joongryeok!

568
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,554
Will you stop,
for goodness' sake?

569
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:15,058
<i>♪ It turned out to be a knockoff,

570
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:18,937

<i>♪ It turned out to be a knockoff ♪</i>

574
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:27,695
The white porcelain
turned out to be a counterfeit.

575
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:30,823
The fur found in it
seems to belong to a Bichon Frisé.

576
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:33,952
Whoever swapped
Professor Kim's porcelain with a knockoff

577
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:37,038
is likely to have a dog.

578
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,332
The broken porcelain
turned out to be a counterfeit.

579
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,751
A high-quality one at that.

580
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,378
But it used modern dye,

581
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,130
and the color of the glaze
is a bit off too.

582
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:50,385
Painting stripes on a pumpkin
doesn't make it a watermelon.

583
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:52,929
Oh my.

584
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:54,597
That was such a perfect analogy.

585
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:57,183
A pumpkin is just a pumpkin.

586
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:00,269
Clever, don't you think?

587
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:01,354
Sure.

588
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:03,564
I'm quite talented in literature.

589
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:06,234
Many people used to tell me
to major in literature.

590
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,444
I even won an award
in a writing contest once.

591
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:13,282
I got a little carried away there.

592
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:14,951
Am I full of myself?

593
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:17,578
Yeah, you're a bit of a know-it-all.

594
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:18,663
A know...

595
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,083
Hmm.

596
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:25,420
How did you figure out
the porcelain was fake?

597
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,547
Its base had collected black grime.

598
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:30,174
Isn't it natural for an old antique
to have collected grime?

599
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,802
Most Korean antique porcelains
have been excavated.

DONGBAN YUBIN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA

00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,807
THAT PROVIDE INSIGHTS
INTO ANCIENT HUMAN CULTURE

603
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:41,269
Unearthed porcelains don't usually display
that sort of black grime.

604
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,353
Oh.

605
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:43,646
Has the fur been analyzed?

606
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:46,566
It's dog fur, as you guessed.

607
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:49,110
Professor Kim
doesn't have a dog.

608
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:52,071
But his daughter does.

609
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:54,240
- What?
- A Bichon Frisé.

610
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:55,408
The fur color matches too.

611
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:57,160
How did you find that out?

612
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:59,912
I saw pictures
on her social media account.

613
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,706
The dog's name is Fanny.

614
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:03,499
Whoa, this Bichon Frisé...

615
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,043
- What about it?
- It's adorable.

616
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:09,797
I would've adored you
if you didn't talk nonsense all the time.

617
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:13,384
Professor Kim's son-in-law
stopped by the day before the incident.

618
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,636
He's our prime suspect so far, right?

619
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,388
There you have it.

620
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,681
Let's not jump to conclusions.

621
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:21,517
We shouldn't. Nothing's for sure yet.

622
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,227
We'll have to check

623
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:26,606
whether the fur found in the porcelain
matches his daughter's dog fur.

624
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:28,900
- Yes, sir.
- Whoa!

625
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:31,277
His son-in-law's name is Joo Hyeonguk.

626
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,612
- So?
- What about it?

627
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,864
His last name is "Joo,"

628
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:36,741
and he's a son-in-law,
which is pronounced "sawi."

629
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:40,328
That makes him "Joosawi,"
as in the word for dice.

630
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:44,290
Ah...

631
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,044
Want me to dice you up into pieces?

632
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,880
Junghwan, can you and Tansik
go and get some fur from that dog?

633
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:52,131
- Why should I?
- Do it.

634
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,758
- Just do it.
- Go ahead.

635
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,635
Yes, sir.

636
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,767
Joo Hyeonguk is approaching. Stand by.

637
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:08,064
Hey, don't look at me.

638
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,149
Get as much fur as you can.

639
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,279
My gosh!

640
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,031
Aren't you just adorable?

641
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,741
- What's your dog's name?
- It's Fanny.

642
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:19,992
Fanny?

643
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,828
As in Tiffany?

644
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:24,956
- May I pet your dog?
- Sure.

645
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,374
Are you a boy or a girl?

646
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,917
Fanny!

647
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,794
You feel so nice, Fanny.

648
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,671
Mmm, you smell so good.

649
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,174
- Hi, honey.
- I'm buying some meat for dinner.

650
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,300
Will two portions be enough?

651
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,594
That's way too little. Get more.

652
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:39,720
<i>Get more.</i>

653
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:41,848
<i>More? More.</i>

654
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:44,308
Fanny!

655
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:45,643
Why do you smell so good?

656
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:47,895
I was born in the Year of the Dog.

657
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,522
Excuse me. We have to get going.

658
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:53,609
Did he scare you?
It's okay. Let's go.

659
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:56,028
- Two portions should be enough.
- No way. It's way too little.

660
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,530
Get more. Way more.

661
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:59,991
- <i>Way more?</i>
- Stay away from that weird guy.

662
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:01,534
- Fanny!
- What the...

663
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,202
What's with you?

664
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:04,954
I love this. Are you happy? I'm happy too.

665
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:06,038
Good girl.

666
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,248
What are you doing?

667
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,125
Stop it. Let's go.

668
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,585
Fanny seems happy.

669
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,795
No way. She seems uncomfortable.

670
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,297
Were you scared, Fanny?

671
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,966
I'm sorry.
I lose control whenever I see a dog.

672
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:19,886
- They're handing out free trash bags.
- Bags?

673
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:22,221
- But I can't be bothered.
- What? You should get them.

674
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,764
Don't forget to get the bags.

675
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,434
<i>Don't forget the bags.</i>

676
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:37,486
What happened?

677
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,071
Should I call the police?

678
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,449
- Sorry?
- He stole something.

679
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:42,909
Yes, he stole the poop.

680
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,118
What? Poop?

681
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:48,748
- Detective Jung!
- How did it go, Tansik? Everything good?

682
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,792
Ta-da. Will this be enough?

683
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:54,420
Is that dog shedding? This is a lot.

684
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:57,006
You kept telling me to get more,
so I rolled around with the dog.

685
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:58,633
- Did I?
- Yes.

686
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,927
Also, the most important thing.

687
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,179
Hey, why did you bring this?

688
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:05,681
You told me to make sure to get the bag.

689
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:06,766
- Did I?
- Yes.

690
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:08,768
- I told you to get the dog poop?
- Yes, you did.

691
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,854
The bag ripped!

692
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:15,900
Joo Hyeonguk runs Shim Interior.

693
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:19,904
One of his clients recently defaulted,
causing financial strain for his company.

694
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:22,156
He also entered
into the condo business

695
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,283
and suffered a big loss recently.

696
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,160
He's clearly been pressed for money.

697
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:29,997
He's the one
who renovated Professor Kim's vault.

698
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:33,251
He would've been able
to get the passcode if he tried to.

699
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:36,128
He must've swapped artworks with knockoffs
whenever he needed money,

700
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:37,338
including the painting.

701
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:38,547
Oh...

702
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:40,758
Everything seems to be falling
into place for once.

703
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,219
Captain.

704
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:44,804
The National Forensic Service confirmed

705
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:48,432
that the fur found in the porcelain
matched that of Joo Hyeonguk's dog.

706
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,645
- Let's interview Mr. Joo first.
- Yes, sir.

707
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:54,897
SONGWON POLICE STATION
HAS MOVED TO A TEMPORARY LOCATION

708
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:58,276
I was pressed for money
because I was out of funds,

709
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:01,779
but I couldn't expect my father-in-law
to lend me any money.

710
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:05,408
But I stayed away
from the most valuable ones.

711
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:06,742
Where did you get the counterfeits?

712
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,247
Uh, I have a friend
who does business in China,

713
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:14,041
and I asked one of his clients for help.

714
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,418
What about the painting?

715
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:18,754
As I said, I'm not the one who stole it.

716
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:25,636
Here's Joo Hyeonguk's call history.

717
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,557
- You may come in.
- I can't, sir.

718
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,309
- Come on in.
- No, sir.

719
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,560
I insist.

720
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,026
Whoa.

721
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:42,486
A-Aren't you the poop thief?

722
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:43,946
Yes, you are!

723
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,365
It's you, the dog poop thief!

724
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,331
Have you contacted him?

725
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,875
He's in China now.
He'll cooperate once he gets back.

726
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:57,001
What about the painting?

727
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:58,544
He knew nothing about it.

728
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:00,546
I've been a detective for over a decade,

729
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:03,507
but no one has ever admitted
to their charges voluntarily.

730
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,968
- Excuse me.
- What is it?

731
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,306
Do you need anything?

732
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:12,767
I think I got less meat than the others.

733
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,894
Could I have more?

734
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:17,730
You must love meat
because you're from the US.

735
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:19,273
- Right?
- I guess.

736
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,150
I want more soup, Mom.

737
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:23,361
Why would you need so much soup?

738
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:26,030
- Goodness.
- What did I do?

739
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:32,453
- Hey, listen.
- Do you need more soup?

740
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,747
No, can I have everyone's attention
for a second?

741
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,793
Well... I've given it some thought,

742
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,837
and I don't think
Joo Hyeonguk stole the painting.

743
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:42,963
Sorry?

744
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:46,467
He usually swaps artworks
with counterfeits.

745
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,843
But this case is different.

746
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:51,639
He would've known that someone
would notice the painting was missing.

747
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:52,890
That's what's off.

748
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,685
Did anyone else visit
Professor Kim's place around then?

749
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:58,938
Uh...

750
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:01,649
- He didn't have any other guests.
- Hmm...

751
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:07,029
There may still have been people
who visited his place for other reasons.

752
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,406
Let's look more into it.

753
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:09,740
Yes, sir.

754
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:11,367
- Eat up.
- Okay.

755
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:12,451
Oh!

756
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:14,286
Excuse me. Can I have more meat?

757
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:19,542
They had a housekeeper,

758
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,085
but she didn't live with them.

759
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:23,129
I'll find out more
as soon as she's identified.

760
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:26,006
An HVAC repairman also visited them

761
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,217
about a week before the incident.

762
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,845
Yes. That's about it.

763
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,972
- There's one more thing. Can I?
- Hold on.

764
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:37,560
Captain, one of his neighbors
called emergency services.

765
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:38,853
What are you doing?

766
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,813
It's no big deal,

767
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:43,107
but the old man living downstairs
has Alzheimer's,

768
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,151
and he reported wasps.

769
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:47,528
But emergency services found nothing

770
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,488
since it's the middle of the winter.

771
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:51,949
SONGWON POLICE STATION
HAS MOVED TEMPORARILY

772
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:55,286
The housekeeping agency
seems to do a thorough background check.

773
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:58,247
Also, Professor Kim's family
handpicked their housekeeper.

774
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:00,374
She's been a housekeeper for a decade,

775
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,376
and she doesn't seem suspicious.

776
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,003
What about the HVAC repairman?

777
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:06,255
His name is Ha Minyong.

778
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:08,090
He's been employed for barely half a year,

779
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:10,009
and he has a criminal record.

780
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,804
Convicted of larceny.

781
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:16,098
He served three years for special larceny.

782
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:18,726
I think we should look into him.

783
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:21,061
Detectives Moo and Seo are already on it.

784
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,230
FINE HVAC SYSTEMS

785
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,906
Mr. Ha Minyong,

786
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,240
we're from the Songwon Police.

787
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,700
Do you have a minute?

788
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:36,869
The Songwon Police?

789
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,121
Hold on!

790
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:43,375
I left as soon as I was finished
with my job that day.

791
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:46,253
Are you suspecting me
because of my criminal record?

792
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,255
This is just
a routine investigation.

793
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:51,592
Then why are two detectives
here to see me?

794
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:55,554
About my criminal record,
I fell in with the wrong crowd,

795
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:58,098
and all I did was keep watch.

796
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,434
<i>To think I served three years for that.</i>

797
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:02,269
<i>But this case is different.</i>

798
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:05,773
<i>He would've known that someone
would notice the painting was missing.</i>

799
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:06,982
<i>That's what's off.</i>

801
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:10,778
Why are you so worked up, huh?

802
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:13,030
It makes you seem suspicious.

803
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,033
I just feel wronged.

804
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:19,203
Also, his vault was passcode-protected.

805
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:23,666
He has a dedicated room for artwork
in his house.

806
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:27,795
You need to enter a passcode to access it.

807
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,880
There was no sign of forced entry,

808
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:31,549
but only the painting disappeared.

809
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,968
How could I have stolen the painting,
even if I wanted to,

810
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,803
<i>without knowing the passcode?</i>

How would he have known the passcode?

815
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:51,360
<i>He must've seen it
while taking the stairs.</i>

816
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:52,987
Maybe he recorded it with his phone.

817
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:58,075
<i>One of his neighbors
