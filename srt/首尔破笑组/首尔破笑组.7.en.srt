Seoul Busters

00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:45,128
Episode 7

3
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,464
Honey, can you take out the food waste?

4
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:21,790
Take good aim
when throwing away your food waste

5
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:24,626
<i>Jung Junghwan lines up his final shot.</i>

6
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:29,798
<i>His Olympic participation
hinges on this moment.</i>

7
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:34,594
<i>Nearly all his shots so far
have hit the target.</i>

8
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:38,640
<i>He takes a deep breath,</i>

9
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,934
<i>centering all his focus on the target.</i>

10
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:33,695
Damn it.

11
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,533
Why did you have to run
into a building without an elevator?

12
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:42,662
What are you going to do now?

13
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,081
- Goodness!
- You're dead.

14
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,457
Stay away!

15
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:54,215
Junghwan, let's go!

16
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:00,305
Come at me! Come on!

17
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:01,598
Out of the way!

18
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,481
Ha!

19
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,360
- Detective Seo!
- Go!

20
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,156
I'll be right with you!

21
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,490
Hey!

22
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,665
Hey, where have you been?
We're already done here.

23
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,875
I got lost while chasing him.

24
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:12,710
Something's up.

25
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,587
Detective Jung,
your housewarming party is today, right?

26
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,798
Since you moved.

27
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:19,884
Let's reschedule since everyone's busy.
A new home isn't a big deal.

28
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,011
That's not okay.

29
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,764
I even skipped lunch for your party.

30
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:28,601
Hey, Junghwan's wife makes amazing food.
You won't be disappointed.

31
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,228
Captain! Captain!

32
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:31,980
Are you in?

33
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,731
-What do you mean?
-You're in.

34
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:37,402
All right.
I expect every one of you to be there.

35
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:38,903
- That's all.
- Okay!

36
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,071
Wait, excuse me.

37
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:44,492
If everyone here is expected to be there,

38
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:47,287
can I go too?

39
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:50,623
Sure you can.

40
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:51,833
Really?

41
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:52,959
To prison.

42
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,672
Make sure to throw a cell-warming party.

43
00:04:58,631 --> 00:04:59,632
Okay.

44
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,682
- All right, here we go.
- Yes!

45
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,600
-Who goes first?
-Rookie, I'll pour you one.

46
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:10,935
-I don't really drink…
-Give me your glass.

47
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,186
Okay.

48
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,440
-There you go.
-Thank you.

49
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:16,983
Captain, a drink?

50
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,527
-I have to drive, so I'll stick to water.
-Okay!

51
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,154
-Minseo, let me fill your glass.
-Me?

52
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:23,865
- You work so hard these days.
- I know.

53
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:27,660
- But please wash up now and then.
- Why would you bring that up?

54
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,829
It's all out of love.
She doesn't wash up often.

55
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,372
Junghwan, here.

56
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,582
The place is a lot more spacious

57
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,083
than it looks from the outside.

58
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,044
- You have a lovely place.
- It's really nice.

59
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,837
I still have a huge mortgage to pay off.

60
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,757
I barely even own the bathroom.

61
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,258
Is everyone's glass filled?

62
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,801
Captain, please make a toast.

63
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,094
-Me?
-Yes.

64
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,305
Hmm… Everyone…

65
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:49,349
drink up!

66
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,730
Drink up.

67
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,108
Drink up.

68
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:03,613
Sorry, I didn't prepare much.
It's such a mess in here too.

69
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:07,075
You made braised short ribs?
That must've been a lot of work!

70
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:10,244
-Let me tell you, she's a great cook!
-Thanks, honey.

71
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,580
- She is?
- I smell apples.

72
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:14,332
From the braised short ribs?

73
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:15,458
I'm positive.

74
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,793
How did you know that?

75
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,504
I added some grated apples
to tenderize the meat.

76
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,381
Nice one, rookie.

77
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:22,965
Dig in…

78
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,842
Captain.

79
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,511
Thank you. Dig in, everyone.

80
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,721
I'll just drink some more.

81
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,807
Joongryeok, let me fill your glass.

82
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:35,061
Since you're drinking,
I'll drink with you.

83
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:44,737
Joongryeok, try this. I made it.

84
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:46,697
Oh my.

85
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,117
You made it?

86
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,701
Mmm!

87
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,916
Eggshells.

88
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,877
Why do you keep staring at me?

89
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,462
Am I that good-looking?

90
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,759
It's not okay to say that, Sena.

91
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:17,061
-You shouldn't say that.
-Does she think I'm good-looking?

92
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,312
Oh, it's nothing.

93
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,939
Gosh.

94
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,774
How's the food?

95
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:22,984
It's good.

96
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:26,028
The sauce is a bit too strong,
and the meat isn't seasoned enough,

97
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,238
but it's decent.

98
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:30,158
No, it's absolutely scrumptious!

99
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,326
Share the recipe with me.
I want to make it at home.

100
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,494
Of course.

101
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,413
It's nothing special.

102
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,458
-Are the kids giving you a hard time?
-Not at all.

103
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,835
Hana's so good at games.

104
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,963
Daddy!

105
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,382
-Daddy!
-What's wrong, Doona?

106
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,384
-Play with me, Daddy!
-Why'd you come out?

107
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,969
-Can you sit down?
-Stay over there.

108
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:52,305
Guys, take Nuri to your room.

109
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:54,265
I don't want to.

110
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:55,766
Go play over there.

111
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,186
Guys, play over there.

112
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,271
- Play with me!
- I don't want to!

113
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:01,606
Go to your room!

114
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:02,773
You too!

115
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,114
Oh, I'm sorry.

116
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,116
Guys, let's go play in the room.

117
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,993
- Let's go.
- I'll play with you. Let's go.

118
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,786
Hana, take your sister with you.

119
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,372
- I want to play.
- I want to play with Daddy.

120
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,291
Is everything okay?

121
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:24,003
Don't worry.
This happens all the time.

122
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,546
Are you dead once we leave?

123
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,965
-Will you be okay?
-Of course.

124
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,383
Let's just drink.

125
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,636
Drink up!

126
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:34,013
- Daddy!
- What happened?

127
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,557
- Why are you back?
- Daddy!

128
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,392
I'll put them to sleep.
Can you brush their teeth?

129
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:41,145
- Hana, your sisters…
- Sorry.

130
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,688
Play with us!

131
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:46,067
Captain, I'm okay.
I'll go help them brush their teeth.

132
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,860
Okay, guys!

133
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,405
Thank you for the food.

134
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:52,740
It was delicious.

135
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,617
- It was really good.
- Thank you.

136
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,202
Detective Seo, I'll drop you off.

137
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,829
Then please drop me off
at the subway station.

138
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,414
-We'll get going.
-Okay.

139
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:01,916
-Good night!
-Thank you!

140
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:03,709
Bye!

141
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,504
Hey, Junghwan.
Want to grab another drink somewhere?

142
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,923
-Oh!
-Shall we? Then just one more…

143
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,508
Come. Let's go inside.
It's cold.

144
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,218
Okay, sure.

145
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,970
All right.

146
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,096
- Good night.
- Good night.

147
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,639
Good night. Bye.

148
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,766
See you.

149
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,811
I feel sorry for him.

150
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,815
I still want another drink.

151
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,234
With who? Detective Jung went back inside.

152
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:32,029
With you.

153
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,823
-Follow me.
-Okay.

154
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:40,454
Aren't Detective Jung's kids adorable?

155
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,291
Strictly speaking,

156
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,626
all children are adorable,
not just Detective Jung's.

157
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,878
Most mammals, including humans,

158
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,715
are genetically wired
to find children cute.

159
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,425
It's called the "baby schema."

160
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,512
The physical features
that prompt caregiving

161
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,098
A round face, large eyes,
and short, chubby limbs--

162
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:01,142
-Captain.
-Yes?

163
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,894
I'm sorry, but DKDC.

164
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,148
I see. DKDC.

165
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,733
Do you even know what that means?

166
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:11,861
-It doesn't sound good.
-It means "Don't know, don't care."

167
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,362
DKDC.

168
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,781
-Oh, so that's what it means.
-Yes.

169
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:17,783
Detective Seo.

170
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,368
SFBK. IBMC.

171
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,121
-Sorry?
-Sorry for being a know-it-all.

172
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,539
I'll be more careful.

173
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:25,416
Okay.

174
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,424
That hits the spot.

175
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:34,508
I know.

176
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,678
Why can't you drink alcohol with me?
You're no fun. Tsk.

177
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,555
I don't like the taste.

178
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,140
Goodness me.

179
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:43,434
By the way,
I'm impressed by Detective Jung.

180
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:45,478
-What do you mean?
-Four kids in this day and age?

181
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,563
He's a true patriot.

182
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,441
Actually, he never planned on
having that many.

183
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:53,653
It was more like fate.

184
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,030
-Fate?
-It's a long story.

185
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:58,908
Detective Jung was 25 or 26 years old.

186
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:02,119
His first encounter with his wife
was also fate.

187
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,586
Match Made by Ping-Pong

188
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,186
Are you okay?

189
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,820
I'm sorry, but can I have my ball back?

190
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,245
Uh…

191
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,248
Your smash is really impressive.

192
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,543
Hold on.

193
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,755
Here you go.

194
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,063
Hmm?

195
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,444
Let's grab a meal sometime

196
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:36,797
Ta-da.

197
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:41,719
"I, standing before
the noble Korean flag…"

198
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:46,015
I didn't make
the national team in the end,

199
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:49,685
but seeing you make it
totally makes up for it.

200
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,187
You'll make it next time.

201
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:55,483
Until then, I'll make sure to win
an Olympic gold medal

202
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,359
and put it around your neck.

203
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,527
Okay.

204
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,155
After that…

205
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,659
let's get married.

206
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,119
Get married?

207
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,579
Yes, let's get married.

208
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,457
You've always wanted
to see the Eiffel Tower.

209
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,833
Let's go there for our honeymoon.

210
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,336
Sounds good.

211
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,381
On that note,

212
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,050
I don't want to go home…

213
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:23,511
on a night like this.

214
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:26,180
Oh, but I have to go home.

215
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:30,392
Youngeun, now that
I'm on the national team,

216
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:34,980
the full weight of this flag on my chest
is starting to sink in.

217
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:38,692
Once I begin intensive training
with my fellow athletes,

218
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,319
who knows when I'll get a break?

219
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,197
If we go home like this tonight,

220
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,075
I might not be able to achieve results
that I can be proud of.

221
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:47,827
You know what they say.

222
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,621
"Ask not
what your country can do for you."

223
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,915
"Ask what you can do for your country."

224
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,251
So I find myself asking
what I can do for this flag.

225
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,796
-What are you trying to say?
-Spend the night with me.

226
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,676
-No way.
-I want to make my country proud.

227
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:08,097
Spend the night with me, will you?

228
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:11,016
Oh, what's that?
What a beautiful building.

229
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,102
- I have to get going.
- Why?

230
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,311
I have to fold my laundry.

231
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,980
I'll fold all your laundry.

232
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,439
That motel looks really nice.

233
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,441
Ah!

234
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,693
So it was that night.

235
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:23,696
That was the fateful night
Hana came to them.

236
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,949
-What about the Olympics?
-Could he focus on his training like that?

237
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,034
He didn't make the cut for the Olympics

238
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:32,037
<i>and immediately started studying
to join the police force.</i>

239
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,873
<i>He had a family to support.</i>

240
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,592
<i>Did they go to France for their honeymoon?</i>

241
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,510
Mm, they sure did.

242
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,554
-By car.
-By car?

243
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:52,057
Here we go.

244
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,268
<i>Un, deux, trois!</i>

245
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,437
We got it.

246
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,440
<i>Petite France in Gapyeong?</i>

247
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:01,525
When was Doona made then?

248
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:05,112
On Junghwan's first day
on the job in the force…

249
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:08,574
Hey, you're home.

250
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,076
Hi, Hana.

251
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,579
- Did you play with Mommy?
- You must be tired, honey.

252
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:16,290
-Did you eat? Okay.
-I did.

253
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,709
What's that smell?

254
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:22,546
I got some donuts from the market.
I know you like these.

255
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,423
- You did?
- Yes, here.

256
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:27,885
Oh! It smells too greasy.
Take it away.

257
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,803
What's wrong?

258
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,942
Yeah, Petite France, baby! Huh?

259
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,694
That's how our petite Doona
was brought into existence.

260
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:49,156
Junghwan seems to hit the mark every time,
as expected of a former shooter.

261
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,784
But why did they have
the third baby right after?

262
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,202
You won't believe it.

263
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:57,581
If this isn't fate,
I don't know what is.

264
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,583
They fell asleep so fast.

265
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,169
- Lower your voice.
- Right.

266
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,089
Gosh, I'm beat.

267
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,844
My whole body aches.

268
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,557
Let's stay like this for a bit.

269
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,519
I'm tired. Don't bother me.

270
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:19,853
Mm.

271
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,148
We can't!

272
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:25,859
Why not? Are you worried?

273
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,988
How could I not be worried?

274
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,949
You don't have to worry.

275
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,493
I underwent a procedure.

276
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,121
A procedure? What do you mean?

277
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,581
A vasectomy.

278
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,043
A vasectomy?

279
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,712
Yes, a vasectomy.

280
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,839
I was offered a discount.

281
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,507
Hold on.

282
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,427
You got a discount on a vasectomy?

283
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:53,554
That sounds sketchy.

284
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,264
No way.

285
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,474
The doctor graduated
from Seoul National University.

286
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,478
We can love as much as we want now.

287
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,857
Go away.

288
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,570
He got a vasectomy?
That should've done the trick, right?

289
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,697
That's what they thought.

290
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,784
Doctor, you said the procedure went well.

291
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,327
That's strange.

292
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:20,581
The procedure really was successful.

293
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:25,586
The chance of pregnancy after a vasectomy
is less than 0.3%.

294
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,254
Less than 0.3%?

295
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:31,341
That means it's nearly impossible.

296
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:34,511
Then how did I become pregnant?

297
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:39,433
Your husband managed to beat

298
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,268
that 0.3% chance.

299
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,228
In other words,

300
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:47,316
his testicles are in the top 0.3%.

301
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:51,236
Throughout my career,
I've never seen testicles like his.

302
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,530
This just doesn't make sense.

303
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:56,950
Seoun University

304
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,453
He went to Seoun University,
not Seoul National University!

305
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,539
No way. I could've sworn
it was Seoul National University.

306
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,958
The Seoun University reunion
is today, right?

307
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,127
-Yes, sir.
-Tell them I'll be 30 minutes early.

308
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,754
- Okay, I will.
- Thanks.

309
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:11,548
There must be
something wrong with my eyes.

310
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:12,966
Those persistent little bastards!

311
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,843
I'll… Youngeun, give me just a second.

312
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,929
I'll set you free once and for all!

313
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:20,432
Junghwan, please don't do this!

314
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:24,186
Your balls didn't do anything wrong!

315
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:29,733
Why do they have to be so damn persistent?

316
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,364
A 0.3% chance?

317
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:37,825
That's absolutely incredible.

318
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,869
What about their fourth kid?

319
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,038
Here's the thing.

320
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,082
Wait, my glass is empty.

321
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,043
Here. Gulp this down…

322
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:49,753
and continue.

323
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:53,423
So how did the man with the top 0.3%
testicles have the fourth baby?

324
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:56,677
Junghwan is scary now too,

325
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,930
but back when he was a new dad
with three kids, he was unstoppable.

326
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,029
Hey, baldy.

327
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,948
-It's all over. Come here.
-Stay away.

328
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:20,325
I have to get home.
Come here while I'm being nice.

329
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,244
Take another step, and I'll jump.

330
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,079
-Come here.
-I'm jumping!

331
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,336
My leg!

332
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,841
My goodness.

333
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:44,057
You should've listened to me.

334
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:50,439
You…

335
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:11,460
Special Promotion Ceremony
for Corporal Jung Junghwan

336
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,795
Salute.

337
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:14,880
At ease.

338
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,853
You're the best!
Stay strong, Daddy!

339
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:38,070
Urologist Ko Chuseon

340
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:47,955
Why are you here?

341
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,290
It's a long story.

342
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:53,418
Anyway, I'm sorry to say this,

343
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:57,130
but you have completely lost
the ability to reproduce.

344
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:58,715
Do you mean…

345
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,843
I've become infertile?

346
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,304
You can't have children anymore.

347
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,599
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

348
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:08,976
Are you positive?

349
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,727
I am.

350
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:12,729
Yes!

351
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:15,023
Yes, yes!

352
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,108
Doctor.

353
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,567
Yes!

354
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:18,652
- Thank you.
- I…

355
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:19,736
Yes!

356
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,948
<i>So he could no longer have children?</i>

357
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:25,534
<i>That's what modern medicine concluded.</i>

358
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,619
<i>But life doesn't always go
according to plan.</i>

359
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:28,954
<i>The thing is,</i>

360
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:33,375
we live in a world full of mysteries!

361
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,377
- You're pregnant.
- What?

362
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,838
But I completely lost
the ability to reproduce.

363
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:41,675
No. In science, nothing's ever 100%.

364
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:45,304
Those few sperm you had left…

365
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,890
…must've made a mad dash for the egg.

366
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,394
And finally, goal!

367
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,521
Miracles do happen.

368
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:57,232
According to research,

369
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:59,067
the chance of pregnancy in this case

370
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:02,654
is only 0.03%,

371
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:03,905
and here we are.

372
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,491
You made it happen.

373
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:07,826
Congratulations.

374
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,161
Let's have a round of applause.

375
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:10,245
Come on, everyone.

376
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:17,836
Amazing.

377
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,004
This is insane.

378
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:20,088
Excellent.

379
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:21,798
I told you.

380
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:26,928
I told you.

381
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,139
I don't believe this.

382
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,516
This isn't happening.

383
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:38,982
Just how strong are they?

384
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:42,569
Sperm

385
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:46,031
Sperm!

386
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,366
Ready!

387
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:48,575
Sperm!

388
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,077
- Stab!
- Sperm!

389
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,537
- Hit!
- Sperm!

390
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:12,057
<i>Junghwan may never have won
an Olympic gold medal,</i>

391
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,936
<i>but his sperm definitely deserve one.</i>

392
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,942
The triumph of the human spirit.

393
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:24,069
More like the triumph of the sperm spirit.

394
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,197
I had given up
on becoming a civil servant,

395
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:28,949
and now I feel so ashamed.

396
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:30,534
I'll give it another try!

397
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:33,120
I was going to give up on Misuk,

398
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:34,413
but I'll ask her out again!

399
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:38,166
I'll quit smoking for good this time!

400
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,961
I was going to close down my bar,

401
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,712
but I've decided to keep it going!

402
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:46,258
With the sperm spirit,
nothing is impossible!

403
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:49,469
Junghwan's sperm…

404
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,014
was the incarnation
of the Olympic spirit itself!

405
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,349
Absolutely!

406
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,941
Seoul Busters

407
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:05,610
Songwon Police Station
has moved to a temporary location

408
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:10,532
What's up? What is it?

409
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:15,495
He decided to look up to you yesterday.

410
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:17,706
I look up to you.

411
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:56,536
Our Kindergarten

412
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,497
- Hello.
- Hello.

413
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:00,707
- Mommy!
- Hey.

414
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,668
- Let's get out now, guys.
- Where's my grandson?

415
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,670
He's here. Come on.

416
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,964
- Hi, sweetie.
- Bye.

417
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,508
Did you have fun at kindergarten?

418
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,759
Watch your step.

419
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,344
- Did you have a nice day?
- Careful.

420
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,804
- Haeun!
- Mommy!

421
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,306
Watch your step.

422
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:18,433
There you go.

423
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:23,855
Yoona!

424
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:25,732
Yoona!

425
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:33,865
Yoona!

426
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:37,619
Yoona!

427
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,960
Hello, this is Violent Crimes Team 2.

428
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,295
What?

429
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:49,589
Listen.

430
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:58,014
She went missing around 3:10 p.m. today

431
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,308
from the apartment complex's
back gate, correct?

432
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:03,853
Yes, I think it was around then.

433
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:08,608
The teacher said Yoona's uncle
picks her up every Thursday.

434
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:11,319
Yes, he lives
in the same apartment complex.

435
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,904
But today,

436
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:17,075
he said he got a call saying
that her class was running late.

437
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:19,578
So he thought
my wife was picking Yoona up.

438
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:22,914
Has he been picking her up
every Thursday so far?

439
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:26,418
My wife is in grad school,

440
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,753
so every Thursday,

441
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:34,384
she gets home
around 30 minutes after Yoona.

442
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,303
It's all my fault.

443
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:37,554
What should we do?

444
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:40,515
When did you receive this name tag?

445
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:43,435
While we were looking everywhere
for our kid,

446
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:47,856
a neighbor brought it
because someone asked them to.

447
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,441
Do you have their phone number?

448
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:50,525
Ah.

449
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,485
Here you go.

450
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:53,862
So you're a used car dealer?

451
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,155
Yes.

452
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:58,617
I've been one for around ten years.

453
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,370
In kidnapping cases,
the parents' cooperation is crucial.

454
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:05,999
Please keep the investigation's progress
confidential for now.

455
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:11,338
- My goodness, our dear Yoona…
- Mother.

456
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,465
I'm sorry, Mother.

457
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:16,468
Will she be okay?

458
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:18,428
Yoona, my baby. Yoona…

459
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:20,597
It's all my fault, Mother.

460
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:24,476
The neighbor didn't remember much.

461
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,478
In kidnapping cases, every second counts.

462
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,647
Detective Moo,
come with me to the kindergarten.

463
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:31,066
-Yes, sir.
-Detective Seo and Jang,

464
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,360
focus on securing
CCTV footage and witnesses.

465
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:34,694
Yes, sir.

466
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:36,071
By the way, where's Junghwan?

467
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,739
He's on standby at the victim's place.

468
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:42,077
<i>Daddy, this is my room, right?
You said so.</i>

469
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,121
No, it's my room! Right, Daddy?

470
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:48,166
The room belongs to both of you.

471
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:50,001
- <i>No, it's mine!</i>
- You promised to share it.

472
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,628
- <i>It's my room!</i>
- I'm on duty.

473
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:52,712
Let's talk at home.

474
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,714
- <i>It's mine!</i>
- See you later. I love you.

475
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:56,383
<i>I said it's mine!</i>

476
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:18,738
Yoona! Yoon…

477
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,117
The magic wand suddenly…

478
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:23,785
I'm sorry.

479
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:27,455
What happened? Is Yoona back?

480
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:31,835
No, the detective touched
Yoona's magic wand.

481
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,586
Why would you…

482
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,547
Yoona! Yoona!

483
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:36,881
-She's not here, Mother.
-Yoona!

484
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:40,218
- The detective touched Yoona's magic wand.
- My goodness.

485
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:44,431
Why would you touch Yoona's magic wand?

486
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,684
- Will you turn that off?
- Yoona, my baby…

487
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:52,313
-Where's my baby? Yoona…
-I'm sorry.

488
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,857
Our Kindergarten

489
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,567
We're baffled too.

490
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,654
I could've sworn it was Yoona's uncle.

491
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:02,198
Was there anything unusual?

492
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,659
No. The man had a similar build.

493
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,662
He looked just like Yoona's uncle.

494
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,873
So you didn't see his face clearly.

495
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:15,170
This kindergarten is
100 times better than ours.

496
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,047
What the…

497
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:19,966
I got you.

498
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:22,802
Why are you here, Donggoo?

499
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,763
Don't tell me you followed us.

500
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:27,557
I didn't. I go to this kindergarten.

501
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,851
Oh, you do?

502
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,145
Yes, I do.

503
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:33,563
So why do you keep coming to us?

504
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:35,148
I go to this kindergarten now,

505
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,650
but I used to go there.

506
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,486
Don't come back again, okay?

507
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:42,030
Whatever. I'll do what I want.

508
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,782
You came here too!

509
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,408
Come here, you little brat.

510
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,035
Hey, what are you doing?

511
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:48,828
Got you!

512
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,539
Go straight home after kindergarten!

513
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:02,967
Donggoo isn't here anymore,

514
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,846
but he was a minute ago.

515
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:09,933
He really was.

516
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,565
The CCTV is facing the wrong way.

517
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:20,985
This is the only route from the back gate

518
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,946
- to the main street, right?
- Yes.

519
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,533
Detective Seo, check out those cars.

520
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,701
- What about them?
- They're all backed in,

521
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,954
but should we take a look
at their dashcams?

522
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:34,415
Nothing here.

523
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:37,919
Oh!

524
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:39,712
Is that one parked head-in?

525
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,340
-Oh, oh!
-It is!

526
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:47,136
It looks pretty old.
The dashcam might not be functioning.

527
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,180
- It's on. Yes.
- It is?

528
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,099
And it's been parked here for a long time.

529
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:53,101
-Let's take a look.
-Okay.

530
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,894
Shit Well Daycare Center

531
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:58,773
We found footage of Yoona being kidnapped.

532
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:01,067
That's Yoona, right?

533
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,236
The headband and the dress match exactly.

534
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:06,739
Judging by the build,
the kidnapper can't be a woman.

535
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,284
That means…

536
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:11,494
…the kidnapper's a man.

537
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,582
Excellent deductive skills.

538
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,835
How did you figure that one out?

539
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:20,169
Isn't it obvious?

540
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:23,006
The kidnapper pretended
to be Yoona's uncle!

541
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,216
Her uncle must be a man.

542
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:27,677
Everything's falling into place.

543
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:32,098
Gosh, I don't know what to do
with that idiot sometimes.

544
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:34,475
They do share a similar build,

545
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,519
but it still doesn't make sense.

546
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:39,731
How could Yoona mistake
someone else for her uncle?

547
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:41,482
It's a common cognitive distortion,

548
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,359
also known as an observational illusion.

549
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:46,654
Often, we believe
we've seen something clearly,

550
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,657
but it's actually
a result of careless assumptions.

551
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:51,993
Is this the only footage we have?

552
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:53,119
Yes, sir.

553
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:55,997
This is all we found around the scene.

554
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,335
The kidnapper must've targeted Yoona
from the beginning

555
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:03,713
and made thorough preparations
for a long time.

556
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:06,007
Yoona was his target from the get-go?

557
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,218
The neighborhood
is full of dashcams and CCTVs.

558
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:11,387
The fact that there's hardly
any footage of him

559
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:14,098
suggests he did his research
on how to avoid them.

560
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:15,850
He also picked Thursday,

561
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,019
when Yoona is picked up by her uncle,
not her mom.

562
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:21,272
It shows he'd been keeping an eye
on Yoona for a while.

563
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,316
But why is it so quiet?

564
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,860
The kidnapper hasn't made any demands yet.

565
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,445
We'll find out soon.

566
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,573
This is hard.

567
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,575
I'm not sure.

568
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:34,118
I don't think I know this person.

569
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:37,830
He might not be someone close to you.

570
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,540
Are you sure you don't know him?

571
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,960
Since I meet a lot of people at work,

572
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:45,213
I'm good at recognizing faces.

573
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:48,341
The kidnapper is likely
holding a grudge against you.

574
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:51,594
We're convinced
he was keeping an eye on Yoona.

575
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,888
He went after Yoona on purpose?

576
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:58,518
I'm not letting that bastard

577
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:00,019
get away with this!

578
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,773
What do we do?

579
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:04,857
Honey.

580
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,610
Honey, we'll catch the scumbag.

581
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:11,823
Captain.

582
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,326
Hello?

583
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,121
<i>Why can't I get a refund?</i>

584
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:20,039
<i>Isn't this a bait-and-switch?</i>

585

Used Car Expert
Jinyong TV

586
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,086
So this is a channel you run?

587
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:26,754
Yes.

588
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:29,882
I wanted to help the victims
of bait-and-switch schemes

589
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:32,343
and improve the used car market
in the long run.

590
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,930
But as you can see,
things often get pretty messy.

591
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,641
That's why I've been keeping it
from my family.

592
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:43,104
Are you suspecting the kidnapper is
one of the bait-and-switch dealers?

593
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:45,857
Many of them must be
holding a grudge against me.

594
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:50,111
I've actually been threatened
by a few of them.

595
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,113
They're the only ones I can think of.

596
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,742
This could lead to something.

597
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:58,661
Do you have a list
of bait-and-switch dealers

598
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,079
you've exposed so far?

599
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,760
What were you doing
around this time yesterday?

600
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,470
I was working, of course.

601
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:17,180
Look, I'm a busy person.

602
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:20,224
Are you really allowed
to call me over without a warrant?

603
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,685
We're busy calling over busy people too!

604
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:25,646
Anyway, is there anyone
who can confirm your alibi?

605
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:29,734
You can't do this to me.
I'm a hard-working taxpayer.

606
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:32,320
Aren't you guys paid with my tax money?

607
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,529
Your tax money?

608
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:36,115
Do you even know how much I get paid?

609
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:39,535
Do you admit to threatening
Mr. Choo Yongjin over text?

610
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,454
I didn't threaten him.

611
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:43,498
He came after us first!

612
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,583
But you committed a crime.

613
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:46,667
A crime?

614
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,712
I'll be blunt.

615
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:53,132
Should he really be stabbing
his fellow dealers in the back like this?

616
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:56,886
Also, we lost 20 million won
because of him!

617
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:59,889
20 million isn't some dog's name!

618
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:03,267
My dog's name is 20 Million.

619
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,937
It's a Maltipoo. Want to see it?

620
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,481
- Your dog's name is 20 Million?
- Yes.

621
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,110
It's so cute.

622
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,820
Sorry, kid.

623
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,531
-Who are you anyway?
-I'm Donggoo.

624
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:17,657
What are you doing here?

625
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,243
I'm waiting for my kindergarten bus.

626

Choo Yoona Kidnapping Case

627

Background Check
Yoon Seohun

628
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:38,386
Don't show the car yet.
Make them sign the contract first.

629
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:41,180
Is this the restroom?

630
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:44,225
There are chicks and everything.
Yes, I'll head back soon.

631
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:49,021
Whatever. It's so annoying.

632
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,482
They should've kept
a closer eye on their kid.

633
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,109
Why put the blame on us?

634
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:56,737
Anyway, serves him right.

635
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,865
Excuse me.

636
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:00,616
Is there a missing kid?

637
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,285
Was there a kidnapping or something?

638
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,204
You can trust me.

639
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,123
I'm a reporter at SBC.

640
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:08,249
Oh!

641
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:10,084
Take it.

642
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,154
These ones have criminal records.

643
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:39,655
These don't.

644
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:42,617
Excluding those with a solid alibi,

645
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:46,829
those fixed with white magnets
are our prime suspects.

646
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:49,665
That guy, Yoon Seohun,
has a rap sheet a mile long.

647
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:52,919
Yeah, he's been convicted of assault too.

648
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:55,254
A typical lowlife.

649
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:58,174
Kim Mungi's the same.

650
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:00,009
He's been in a gang too.

651
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:02,136
Exactly.
You finally said something useful.

652
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,055
- What?
- They're definitely suspicious.

653
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:06,265
- Don't you agree, Captain?
- Hmm…

654
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:10,645
A cake just arrived.

655
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,688
-What cake?
-A birthday cake.

656
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,941
A birthday cake? Is it someone's birthday?

657
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:17,360
It's not mine,
and it's not the captain's either.

658
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:18,945
How do you know the captain's birthday?

659
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:22,073
Come on. We work on the same team.

660
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:23,324
Do you know when <i>my</i> birthday is?

661
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:27,995
Your birthday
is in the middle of summer, isn't it?

662
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,664
It's in the middle of winter!

663
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,667
A cake arrived where?

664
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,961
At Yoona's place.
It seems to be from the kidnapper.

665
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,467
Yoona's birthday is next week, right?

666
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,511
Prepare five billion won
if you want to celebrate it with her.

667
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:46,055
So this arrived with the cake?

668
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:49,517
At first, I didn't understand
why we received a cake.

669
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:52,103
But then I found the note behind it.

670
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:55,022
That lady brought it.

671
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:57,775
She did?

672
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,865
Joongryeok,
you should talk to her.

673
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:06,951
You've had a lot of boxing matches
in the US.

674
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:09,912
What are you talking about?
All I did there was box.

675
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:13,749
Hey, Minseo. You can speak English, right?

676
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:16,043
You majored in English literature,
didn't you?

677
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:19,255
I didn't. I majored in Russian literature.

678
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,465
Rookie, go.

679
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,592
I can't even speak Korean well.

680
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:26,053
And you're proud of that?

681
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,430
Hello, ma'am.

682
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:29,390
We're from the police. Can I just ask you?

683
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,018
Where did you get this cake from?

684
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:35,396
What are you saying?
I can't speak English.

685
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,315
Does anyone here speak our language?

686
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:38,816
"Our language"?

687
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:41,027
Does she mean Russian?

688
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,738
-But how did I understand her?
-She spoke in Korean.

689
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:44,822
Can you speak Korean?

690
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:48,117
I'm Korean, so yes, of course.

691
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,619
My ancestors were independence activists.

692
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:53,497
My family's been settled here
since the Korean Expedition.

693
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,541
So you're from the police?

694
00:38:55,624 --> 00:39:00,129
I went to the supermarket earlier,
and there was a promotion going on.

695
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:03,049
So I ended up buying
way more than I had planned.

696
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:04,300
Let's go back to the case.

697
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,677
Who gave you this cake?

698
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,138
Right. I got a little carried away there.

699
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:12,350
On my way back from the supermarket,
someone asked me for a favor.

700
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:15,519
And Koreans are supposed
to help each other out, aren't they?

701
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:18,272
So I went out of my way
to deliver the cake.

702
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:19,732
What did that person look like?

703
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:22,109
-Nothing really stood out.
-Is that right?

704
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,403
Should I make a sketch?

705
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,530
Can you do that? That'd be very helpful.

706
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:35,623
I can only draw in a caricature style.

707
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:38,250
But the person looked exactly like this.

708
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:42,129
To me, this looks like that guy.

709
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,339
Who?

710
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:45,299
The one with a long rap sheet.
What was his name?

711
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:48,052
Yoon Seohun. Doesn't it look like him?

712
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,470
That's my hunch.

713
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:03,275
Do you think you can pick on me
because I'm an ex-con?

714
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:05,986
I didn't do it, I swear!

715
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,114
You said you were home that day.

716
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,657
Can anyone confirm that?

717
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,785
I mean, who could confirm
I was home alone?

718
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:14,120
Look to your right.

719
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:17,957
What is this all about?

720
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,417
Look straight ahead.

721
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:24,296
Show me your teeth like this.

722
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,841
What the heck are you doing?

723
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:31,053
Go ahead and put a mustache
and a hat on me too while you're it.

724
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,305
Hosang Station Intersection
Assault Case

725
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:34,723
Background Check
Yoon Seohun

726
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,185
Criminal Record
Yoon Seohun

727
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,770
Mob assault, assault,
traffic violation, intimidation…

728
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,107
Seized items from Yoon Seohun

729
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:47,194
Income, Expenses, Receivables

730
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:50,322
Income, Income, Receivables, Expenses

731
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,410
Income, Income, Expenses

732
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:55,911
Income

733
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:58,330
Income

734
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,549
Income, Income, Expenses

735
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:11,677
<i>He marked his income
with two different colors.</i>

736
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:14,763
<i>Some with yellow and others with orange.</i>

737
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,058
<i>Can't he tell the two colors apart?</i>

738
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,936
Intimidation, special violence,
traffic violation

739
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:22,605
Hey.

740
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:25,357
I'll get cramps in my face.

741
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:34,658
Their Almost Twisted Hero

742
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,994
Can you read that out loud for me?

743
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:38,787
-Me?
-Yes.

744
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,331
Hurry up.

745
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:46,712
Their Almost Twisted Hero

746
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:49,381
"Hero."

747
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:51,800
Hmm.

748
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,345
Let him go. It's not him.

749
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:55,554
Captain, you should see this.

750
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:56,680
Just let him go.

751
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:00,643
He told you to let me go!

752
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:08,567
This is going to drag on for a while.
Go home for the day.

753
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:10,569
Captain.

754
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:12,988
Why are you letting him go?
He's our prime suspect.

755
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,615
Yoon Seohun has red-green color blindness.

756
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:18,536
So what? It's not like we're issuing
his driver's license.

757
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,287
Look at this letter here.

758
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:23,082
It's orange against a green background.

759
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:25,543
Yoon Seohun
would've had trouble reading it.

760
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:28,462
It doesn't make sense
for him to have chosen this letter.

761
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,675
There goes our prime suspect.

762
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,219
We're back at square one.

763
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:38,264
That sketch is our only clue then.

764
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:42,101
To me, it just looks like an ordinary man.

765
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:44,270
It may not be…

766
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:47,898
…a man.

767
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,820
What do you see in that sketch?

768
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:57,992
The person looks sad.

769
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,787
Also tired after years of struggle.

770
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:04,623
I also sense loneliness
stemming from isolation.

771
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:09,044
Most of all,
those eyes seem to belong to a woman.

772
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:12,881
To me, it looks like a middle-aged man
who loves his drinks.

773
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:15,759
Maybe you're right.

774
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:18,429
I'm worried about Yoona's parents.

775
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:20,681
They've become so haggard overnight.

776
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,892
But how could the kidnapper
demand five billion won?

777
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:25,352
Is that some kind of joke?

778
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,271
- How does that make sense?
- It doesn't.

779
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:28,480
Right?

780
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:31,567
How would ordinary people like them
prepare five billion won?

781
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:32,776
I know.

782
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,778
I wonder why the kidnapper made
such a demand

783
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:36,739
from ordinary people.

784
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:39,491
Maybe he's a psychopath
who's lost touch with reality.

785
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,368
The kidnapper was meticulous enough

786
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,536
to secure an escape route

787
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,414
and planned out the crime well in advance.

788
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,334
They can't just be a psychopath.

789
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:01,388
You should eat something.

790
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:05,142
We need to pull ourselves together
to find Yoona.

791
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:07,645
You go and eat.

792
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,064
You should eat something too.

793
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:15,110
Are you planning to starve to death?

794
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:17,404
Should we just starve to death together?

795
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:27,998
Sorry. I'm a little on edge.

796
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:37,675
Hello?

797
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,843
<i>Hello? Is this Mr. Choo Yongjin?</i>

798
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:42,596
<i>This is Kim Handu, a reporter at SBC.</i>

799
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:44,598
<i>You must be really concerned--</i>

800
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,270
I'd like to interview you
about your daughter

801
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:51,855
I have questions about the kidnapping case

802
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:54,441
Oh, fuck!

803
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,610
What should we do?

804
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:59,697
<i>It's been 48 hours
since the disappearance of Choo Yoona,</i>

805
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,574
<i>a chatty and hopeful seven-year-old.</i>

806
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:05,160
<i>With her parents in torment…</i>

807
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:06,912
What the heck?

808
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:08,288
Who leaked it?

809
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,876
Why are you looking at me?

810
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,128
It's not me this time!

811
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:16,004
It wasn't me last time either!

812
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:18,632
There are articles
all over the internet too.

813
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:23,971
Yoona's parents are blaming us
for jeopardizing her safety.

814
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:29,059
Hello, Chief. Dongbang Yubin speaking.

815
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:32,980
Understood, sir.

816
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:39,236
We're no longer involved
in the Choo Yoona case.

817
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:45,033
A special investigation team
will be set up at headquarters.

818
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,453
Get ready to hand over the case.

819
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:51,874
What? Are we being removed from the case?

820
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:03,802
Seoul Busters
