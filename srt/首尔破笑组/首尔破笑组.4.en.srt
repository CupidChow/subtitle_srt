00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,543
Seoul Busters

00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:47,547
Athena International Sports Games

3
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,134
Wooo! GO!

4
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,552
Go! Korea!
Joongryeok

5
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:53,887
Moo Joongryeok! Moo Joongryeok!

6
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:57,140
Wooo!

7
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,059
GO, JACK! Wooo!

8
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,560
Go, Moo Joongryeok!

9
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,315
Box!

10
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,817
You can do it! GO, JACK!
Go, Moo Joongryeok! Let's go!

11
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,235
Swoosh

12
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:17,660
Smack!

13
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,882
Moo Joongryeok! Moo Joongryeok!

14
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,690
Stop!

15
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,109
Get in your corner.

16
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,824
Hey, Joongryeok!

17
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,676
Hey, Joongryeok. Joongryeok!

18
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,971
Get it together! You're being cornered.

19
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,472
His punches are too strong.

20
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,474
He has a longer reach than you.

21
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,268
An infighter like you has no chance.

22
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:24,894
Give me a strategy if you're a coach!

23
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,855
-I have an idea.
-What is it?

24
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,106
-Hold your ground.
-What?

25
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:29,691
I said hold your ground!

26
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:32,110
You've gotten this far
by holding your ground.

27
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,405
Listen. Life is all about that one shot.

28
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,031
You're always saying that.

29
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,616
Go now!

30
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,136
Box!

31
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,614
Hold your ground.

32
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,200
Hold your ground, come on!

33
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,163
Now!

34
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,343
- Hey, Jack.
- What?

35
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:39,928
Four.

36
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,680
Fight.

37
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,349
Four punches,
and you're out!

38
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,573
One, two, three…

39
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,200
Come on, Jack, get up.

40
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,826
- …four, five…
- Come on.

41
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,205
- …six, seven, eight…
- Come on.

42
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:09,582
-…nine, ten!
-Come on, Jack! Get up!

43
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,982
Oh… Take that!

44
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:37,402
So you're the legendary KO King of Athens?

45
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,195
It's an honor to meet you. Bow.

46
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:42,115
That's all in the past now.
It was a long time ago.

47
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:44,242
I used to do sports too.

48
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:47,078
-What did you do?
-I did judo in high school.

49
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:49,038
Were you an elite?
Then we're fellow athletes.

50
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,291
No, I was just an amateur.

51
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,085
Anyway, why did you quit boxing?

52
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:55,795
Health issues.

53
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:57,380
Did you get sick?

54
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,090
No, I'm not sick or anything,

55
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,384
but punches hurt.

56
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:03,803
Have you never been punched?

57
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:07,056
Punching someone isn't easy either.

58
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,727
You end up so bruised and aching
that you can't sleep at night.

59
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,062
Try boxing sometime and you'll see.

60
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,564
Here comes the boss!

61
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,026
Correctional facility

62
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,035
Welcome back, Boss!

63
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:28,703
You did well, Boss.

64
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,788
It's not like I did anything in there.

65
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:31,873
Mr. Oh Sangsu.

66
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,502
-Who are you?
-He's the KO King of Athens.

67
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,130
Athens? The karaoke bar?

68
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,758
I'm from the Songwon Police,
not a karaoke bar.

69
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,260
This is your arrest warrant, Mr. Oh.

70
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,012
You're under arrest

71
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:50,058
for unlawful debt collection
and special intimidation.

72
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,726
You have the right to remain silent.

73
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,853
You have the right to become an attorney…

74
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:56,314
That came out wrong.
You have the right to an attorney.

75
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:57,398
Hold on.

76
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,028
I just got released from prison.

77
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,321
I've looked everywhere for you!

78
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,281
I had no idea you were in there.

79
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,325
I've waited so long for you.

80
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:08,785
- Detective.
- Nice to meet you.

81
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,661
-Just a second, Detective.
-What?

82
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,414
Boss!

83
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:14,707
Hey, athlete.

84
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,710
-Leave this life of crime behind.
-Okay.

85
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,004
You look like you love food,
so why not become a cook?

86
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,381
Well… Okay.

87
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,174
Mr. Oh!

88
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,550
Hey, Sangsu!

89
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,178
Get in, Boss!

90
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:28,513
That was close.

91
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:33,226
-Let's go.
-Sure, to the Songwon Police Station.

92
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:34,685
Detective Moo!

93
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,480
Detective Moo! You're the best!

94
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,941
- Let's go!
- That was awesome!

95
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,526
Let's go, move!

96
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,861
Let's go! Let's go!

97
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,613
Go! Go!

98
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,783
So, how's working in the field?

99
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:50,535
Daunting, isn't it?

100
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,703
I wouldn't say that. I'm learning a lot.

101
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:53,996
You're not a student anymore.

102
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,124
If you want to learn, pay tuition.

103
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,292
-Give me the report.
-Yes, sir.

104
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,044
Here you go.

105
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,844
It all looks good.

106
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,555
Ask someone over here to do that.

107
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,849
We all work in the police force.

108
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,684
Don't think you and I are any different.

109
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,396
Here's your lunch, sir.

110
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:21,399
The Chief State Councilor set, right?

111
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:22,525
Yes, thanks.

112
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,068
- Enjoy your lunch.
- Thank you.

113
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,241
-Yubin, hand me that.
-Hand you what?

114
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:31,868
- Behind my jacket.
- Behind your jacket?

115
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,541
What is this?

116
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,626
-You mean this?
-Yes.

117
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:45,965
-Want me to put it on you?
-Forget it.

118
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,593
I have a meeting soon,

119
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:50,761
so I'd rather keep my jacket on.

120
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,891
My daughter got me this

121
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,185
-because she loves bees.
-Ah!

122
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,897
Police standing by the people
with transparency and justice

123
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,982
- Hey, Dongbang!
- Hi.

124
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:05,067
I'll catch up.

125
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,778
- Why are you here?
- To see the commissioner.

126
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,989
-Do you have a minute?
-Yeah.

127
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,283
Thank you.

128
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,495
If the commissioner summoned you

129
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,205
all the way here for a briefing…

130
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,666
…it seems like he hasn't given up on you.

131
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,294
There are others he can rely on.

132
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:26,339
That's my point.
Yet he still insists on working with you.

133
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,510
Don't you want to work at headquarters?

134
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:31,928
What was all that studying for?

135
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,638
I'm happy where I am.

136
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,389
They seem to have a reputation.

137
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:36,474
A bad one.

138
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:38,684
Mm-mm. They're not that bad.

139
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,271
All of them are quite charming
in their own unique ways.

140
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,564
Charming, my foot.

141
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,945
Is this about what happened in the States?

142
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,821
Is that why you prefer fieldwork?

143
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,575
It's time to let go.

144
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,619
It's been a long time,

145
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,454
and the rumor
that the perp is back in Korea…

146
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:02,750
I saw you on TV. Remaking of Crime.

147
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:03,834
It seems quite popular.

148
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:07,380
Who cares? It's just work.

149
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,424
Still, the media sure is a powerful tool.

150
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,802
Some cases are getting a second look
after being featured on the show.

151
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,263
Speaking of which,

152
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,473
come on our show sometime.

153
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,058
You'd do well.

154
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,309
I don't think so.

155
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,230
You don't have to answer now.
Just give it some thought.

156
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,533
-What are you doing?
-I'm thinking.

157
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,034
What?

158
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:39,912
My answer's still no.

159
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,590
Seoul Busters

160
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,467
Episode 4

161
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,386
- Good work!
- Cheers!

162
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,476
Captain!

163
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,816
The warrant for Oh Sangsu's arrest
came through. Good work.

164
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,401
Don't mention it, sir.

165
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:13,696
All we did was wait outside the prison
and pick him up.

166
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,531
We still deserve credit.

167
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:19,535
We looked everywhere for him
with the former captain too.

168
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:23,122
How did you figure out he was in prison
just by going through the papers, sir?

169
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:25,291
He changed his name
and even used aliases,

170
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:26,667
but he didn't change his email address.

171
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:27,752
I got lucky.

172
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:30,046
Wow, email? American style.

173
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,213
You're incredible, sir.

174
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,051
Here's your snow fried chicken.

175
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:37,345
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

176
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:41,807
I jumped through many hoops
to arrange this dinner.

177
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,559
Apparently, this place is super popular.

178
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,520
Oh. Dig in, everyone.

179
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,356
It looks good, although it's not beef.

180
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:49,982
Hey, have some manners.

181
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,360
Captain's treating us to a meal.
I need to capture this.

182
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,487
Let's see here.

183
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,033
I'm done.

184
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,786
Stop making such a fuss,
for crying out loud.

185
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,996
Thank you for the food,
although it's not beef.

186
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,748
Were you grass in your past life?

187
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,917
Why are you so obsessed with eating cows?

188
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,377
Wow, this looks so yummy.

189
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,672
-Unbelievable.
-My goodness.

190
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:16,634
Mmm, chicken.
Mmm, chicken. Mmm, mmm, chicken.

191
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:18,636
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

192
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:21,847
Flavor analysis in progress.

193
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,850
Mm, analysis complete.

194
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,185
It's delicious.

195
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:30,106
Seriously,
AI wouldn't be half as rude as you.

196
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,110
Captain.

197
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,153
Try the drumstick, sir.

198
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:40,658
I prefer lean cuts.

199
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:43,661
Oh, I see you're Team Lean Cuts.

200
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:47,248
No wonder you're so lean, sir.

201
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:48,332
Thank you.

202
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,710
This place is really crowded.

203
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,795
Like I said,
this place was chosen

204
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,755
as one of Seoul's top seven chicken joints

205
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,882
by Chicken Hunter,
a YouTuber with a million subscribers.

206
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,759
Seoul's top seven chicken joints.

207
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,761
Next up is One Shot Chicken!

208
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,304
One Shot Chicken

209
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,514
Isn't it pretty good, sir?

210
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:04,890
-Not really.
-No?

211
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:07,977
The soy sauce flavor is overpowering,
and the batter is too thick.

212
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,397
They jumped on the cheese bandwagon,
but it doesn't go well with the sauce.

213
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,149
Actually,
even the curing has failed.

214
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,650
In other words,

215
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,444
this is prêt-à-porter
pretending to be haute couture.

216
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:17,528
Dongbang Yubin's Encyclopedia

217
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,071
Haute Couture vs Prêt-à-porter

218
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:22,867
Haute Couture: High-end custom clothing
Prêt-à-porter: Mass-produced clothing

219
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,201
In my opinion.

220
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,371
I see.

221
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,291
What would a mere chicken YouTuber
know about chicken anyway?

222
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:32,585
Even if he has
a whopping million subscribers.

223
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,296
You can go ahead with it.

224
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:37,965
Sure, don't worry about it.

225
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,508
Okay, bye.

226
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,016
-Hey.
-Yes? Are you talking to me?

227
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:50,561
Hey!

228
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,522
-Joongryeok, is that you?
-What are you doing here?

229
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,232
Are you the owner of this place?

230
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,234
Yes, one thing led to another,

231
00:12:58,527 --> 00:12:59,737
and I fry chicken these days.

232
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,280
Have you quit coaching completely?

233
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,115
That was a long time ago.

234
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:05,075
I quit ages ago.

235
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,952
Then again, why stay in a sweaty gym

236
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,954
when you can rake in money as the boss?

237
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,247
The boss, my foot.

238
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,208
I'm up to my neck in debt.

239
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,418
Anyway, I heard
you joined the police force.

240
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:15,544
Ah...

241
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,713
-I'm having a team dinner right now.
-Really?

242
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:18,923
Coach Yoon!

243
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:23,552
I'm getting some chicken for the kids.
Can I get a family discount again?

244
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,930
-Are we suddenly family now?
-Please, just this once.

245
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,723
By the way, you know Joongryeok, right?

246
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,725
What about him?

247
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:34,438
-Joongryeok!
-Son Taesung with a runny nose?

248
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,482
I don't have a runny nose anymore.

249
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:39,944
What is this, a reunion?
I can't believe I ran into you guys.

250
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,737
I didn't know you two were in touch.

251
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,323
This guy runs a boxing gym
down the street.

252
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:45,449
He's the owner.

253
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,120
Coach Yoon sometimes gives
special lessons at my gym,

254
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,539
and I buy his chicken.

255
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,668
What are you doing here, Dad?
The orders are piling up.

256
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:56,752
- I'll be right in.
- Hey.

257
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,088
You must be Hyojoo, right?

258
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,841
I knew you looked familiar.
Don't you remember me?

259
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:05,261
-I'm not sure…
-When you were this little…

260
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,720
How old was she back then?

261
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:07,805
She was barely a year old.

262
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,808
Right. I sang
at your first birthday party, remember?

263
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,185
Well…

264
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,770
-Come back in.
-Wait.

265
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,772
Let me give you a little pocket money.

266
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,733
-No, you don't have to.
-I insist.

267
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,110
It's really fine.

268
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,612
Just say thank you and take…

269
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:33,289
- It's okay, Joongryeok.
- Look, give me your account number.

270
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,832
-Sorry?
-Your bank account number.

271
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,876
-It's really fine.
-Well, then.

272
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,961
-See you inside.
-Okay.

273
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,170
It's not fine!

274
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,714
Forget it.

275
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,510
Is your necklace gold? Take it off.

276
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,512
It's just gold-plated.

277
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:51,974
Ugh! You haven't changed a bit, have you?

278
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,309
Let's go in.

279
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,560
Yes, let's go in.

280
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,979
- So you own a gym now?
- I sure do.

281
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,732
Did you enjoy your food?

282
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,483
No, not really.

283
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,776
- Sorry?
- Don't mind him.

284
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,029
We really enjoyed it. Thank you.

285
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,072
Did the owner used to be a boxer?

286
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,449
How did you know that?

287
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:09,700
The gold medal behind you.

288
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,911
That's actually stainless steel.

289
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,204
It's just gold-plated.

290
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,748
But my dad treasures it--

291
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:18,500
Look how shiny it is.
He must wipe it every day.

292
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,337
Of course. I'll be buried with it.

293
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,421
You're being silly.

294
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:24,548
Who here doesn't have a gold medal?

295
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,343
-I don't.
-You don't?

296
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,762
- Not yet.
- What have you been doing?

297
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,096
Goodness. Ring us up now.

298
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,099
Wait, you don't have to pay.
You can just go.

299
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,517
It's our department's credit card.

300
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,977
Go ahead and swipe it.

301
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,395
That's my credit card.

302
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,648
Swipe it already!

303
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:41,732
Rip us off!

304
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:44,068
Hyojoo, ring up a million won
to include your pocket money.

305
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,903
- Okay.
- I said it's fine.

306
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,404
Buy me a drink later.

307
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,031
I'm sorry I'm late.

308
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,366
Hi, Jiwoong.

309
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,076
Take this.

310
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,495
- This is for the delivery?
- Yes. Drive safe.

311
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:55,704
Okay.

312
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:59,541
I saw on Instagram that you're giving out
gifts for your first anniversary.

313
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,168
We're out of stock, so…

314
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,629
Oh! Then what are these?

315
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,756
Those are samples.

316
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,132
I don't mind.

317
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,968
- Then you can take them.
- Thanks.

318
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,095
- I'll write down my number for rewards.
- Sure.

319
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:14,640
Can you please stop?
It's embarrassing.

320
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,392
I know. Stop it.

321
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,476
Minsoo, we'll get going.

322
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:20,270
Take a group photo before you leave.

323
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:23,232
We're taking pictures of our customers
to celebrate our anniversary.

324
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,817
Hyojoo, take a picture of them.

325
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,985
Okay. Just a second, please.

326
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,945
You don't have to. Forget it.

327
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,572
-It does seem unnecessary.
-Let's do it. It's free.

328
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,825
-Please take a picture of us.
-Let's take a picture.

329
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,120
-Here we go.
-Come closer.

330
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:39,289
Three, two, one. Chicken!

331
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:05,441
One Shot Chicken

332
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,597
Songwon Police Station
has moved to a temporary location

333
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,057
Wish-It-Well Daycare Center

334
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:42,936
This is the Violent Crimes Team.

335
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:46,648
I'm not just some kid. I'm Donggoo.

336
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:51,528
-This really is the Violent Crimes Team.
-Hey, what are you doing?

337
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:52,654
Hey, Donggoo!

338
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,032
This is the Songwon Police
Violent Crimes Team.

339
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,867
Hello?

340
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,454
Hey.

341
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,707
Who said you could answer the phone?

342
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,084
The phone was ringing.

343
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,293
That doesn't mean you can answer it.

344
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,879
Do you not answer the phone
when it's ringing?

345
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,297
I do, but…

346
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,091
But…

347
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,885
What's this kid doing here now?

348
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:18,388
Stop coming in here, or else.

349
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,973
I was going to stay outside,

350
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,643
but the weather's too cold for kids.

351
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:24,311
Where's your mom?

352
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:26,313
She told me to play
on the playground for a bit.

353
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:27,815
Goodness,

354
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,775
-we can't even control a little kid.
-Get out.

355
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:32,069
This precinct has gone to the dogs.

356
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:34,238
I'm not a dog. I'm Donggoo.

357
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,614
Fine, I get it!

358
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:38,909
This precinct has gone to Donggoo.

359
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,998
-This is the Violent Crimes Team.
-I missed it.

360
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:46,917
Pardon?

361
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,169
Okay, we'll head over there right now.

362
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:53,090
-What's the matter?
-Someone got injured in a fire.

363
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:54,174
Where was the fire?

364
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,677
At One Shot Chicken.

365
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,263
What?

366
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,098
It was where?

367
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,204
What happened?
I heard someone got injured.

368
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:28,041
Fortunately,
the fire started after business hours,

369
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,836
but the owner's daughter
happened to be here.

370
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,296
- Hyojoo?
- Hyojoo?

371
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:33,380
-Look.
-Who's that?

372
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,090
Yes, her name's Yoon Hyojoo.

373
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,466
How do you know her name?

374
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,676
Is she in serious condition?

375
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,595
Luckily,
she got rescued quickly,

376
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,513
but she's still unconscious.

377
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:48,228
- What's with him?
- He's friends with the owner.

378
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,563
From his boxing days.

379
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:05,329
Burnt power strip

380
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,665
Undamaged plugs

381
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:17,883
The witness said
the fire started around 4 a.m.

382
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,927
If it was an accident,
it could've been the power strip

383
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,720
or the air conditioner short-circuiting.

384
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,055
The power strip isn't the cause.

385
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,806
The plugs are undamaged.

386
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,683
You're right.
Who could've done this…

387
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,185
Could this have been arson?

388
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,437
We don't know yet,
but it's a possibility.

389
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,563
Captain.

390
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:35,275
Mr. Yoon is with his daughter
at the hospital.

391
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,110
Detective Moo is heading there right now.

392
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,197
- Get the CCTV footage from around here.
- Yes, sir.

393
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,615
Watch out!

394
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:46,036
What did you say?

395
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,163
- It's slippery. Watch out.
- Got it.

396
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,415
Oh, dear.

397
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,340
Is walking from here to there
so difficult?

398
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:06,139
It seems like there are
no CCTVs in the restaurant.

399
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,432
Really?

400
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,811
I remember seeing a camera
on the ceiling.

401
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,271
I'll retrieve the footage.

402
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:15,524
If this was an accident,
a fire must've started for some reason,

403
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:19,069
and the daughter must've failed to escape.

404
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,737
No, something doesn't add up.

405
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,573
Why would she have been here
alone at night?

406
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:24,992
That's not strange at all.

407
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,327
It's actually quite plausible.

408
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:32,124
Sehwa University Hospital

409
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,964
She doesn't even like chicken.

410
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,092
But since I struggled to find part-timers…

411
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,762
and keep them…

412
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,724
she volunteered to help.

413
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,227
Joongryeok.

414
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:54,896
Hyojoo will be okay, right?

415
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,733
She means…

416
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,402
everything to me.

417
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:07,951
Remember what you said to me
when I wanted to give up on training?

418
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:10,162
"Everything will be okay in the end."

419
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,582
That's what you told me.

420
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,543
She'll be okay.

421
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,309
I just received Yoon Hyojoo's results
from the hospital.

422
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:34,144
Her injury…

423
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:37,647
…wasn't caused by suffocation.

424
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,400
The back of her head was torn,

425
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,611
and she suffered a concussion.

426
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:48,658
It's likely that someone
attacked her from behind.

427
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,327
Hmm…

428
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,704
The fire department
is still processing the scene,

429
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,539
but this points to arson.

430
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,291
Understood.

431
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,459
Lee Jiwoong, age 19

432
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:01,004
The fire was reported by the part-timer,

433
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,589
Lee Jiwoong.

434
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,466
Why was he there so early?

435
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,885
He works out at the gym every morning.

436
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:10,472
He saw the fire on his way to the gym
and made a report.

437
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:13,141
He also found Hyojoo unconscious
and carried her out.

438
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,060
That's incredible.

439
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:17,687
Not everyone can jump
into a fire like that.

440
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:21,108
-What about the exits?
-There are two doors.

441
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,484
The main entrance

442
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:23,819
and the back door connected
to the kitchen.

443
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,153
But here's the thing.

444
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,696
Both doors have keypad locks.

445
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,491
And they're not damaged at all.

446
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:33,453
If this was arson,
the culprit must've known the passcode.

447
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,247
Maybe they broke in through a window.

448
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,791
All the windows at the scene were broken.

449
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:40,210
The windows showed
signs of thermal stress.

450
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:43,880
They broke due to high air pressure,
not by external force.

451
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:46,925
There must only be a handful of people
who know the passcode,

452
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:48,218
including the owner's daughter.

453
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:50,345
Hey.

454
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,806
What are you implying?

455
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:54,683
I'm not suspecting her.

456
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,893
I'm just stating what I observed.

457
00:23:57,477 --> 00:24:00,272
Minsoo may be frying chicken now,

458
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:04,359
but he was Korea's first
WBA featherweight champion. Got it?

459
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:07,988
Mr. Yoon is one of the suspects for now.

460
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:12,117
He's a victim, not a suspect.

461
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,911
Are you suggesting he harmed Hyojoo?

462
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,123
Don't be ridiculous.

463
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,876
More than half of arson cases
are committed by insiders.

464
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,712
- I'm sure you know that.
- Whatever.

465
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,130
It's not him.

466
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,466
We must always consider all possibilities.

467
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:42,981
Uh…

468
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:45,609
There's one more door.

469
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:47,527
Where?

470
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,821
Right here.

471
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:53,533
-The perp could've entered--
-This marker is dried out.

472
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:55,911
Just a second.

473
00:24:57,954 --> 00:25:01,374
There's supposed to be a wall here.

474
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,084
I'm sorry.

475
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,253
What do we know about Yoon Hyojoo?

476
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,380
Oh, she's the chicken joint owner's…

477
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:12,719
She is the daughter
of a former boxing champion.

478
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:15,430
She started helping out
at the restaurant two months ago.

479
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,390
She's a sophomore in economics
at Yeonju University,

480
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:18,850
currently on a leave of absence.

481
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:20,685
Do we have any CCTV footage?

482
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:23,063
There were no CCTVs at the entrance,

483
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:25,982
but I retrieved footage
from the nearest CCTV,

484
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:27,817
and it captured someone suspicious.

485
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:29,736
Here's the footage.

486
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,783
A man was heading
toward One Shot Chicken

487
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,785
30 minutes before the fire.

488
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,286
Can we identify him?

489
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,579
I'll look into it.

490
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,414
- Send me the file.
- Okay.

491
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:44,918
Detectives Jung and Jang,
find out what Hyojoo did that day.

492
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,253
Yes, sir.

493
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:49,172
We'll keep all possibilities open for now.

494
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:50,966
And Detective Moo.

495
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,136
Please keep your personal feelings
out of the case.

496
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:59,224
Otherwise, I'll have to remove you
from the case.

497
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:02,769
That's all for today.

498
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,615
Does Minsoo come here often?

499
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,826
Every once in a while.

500
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,704
Why did he quit coaching anyway?

501
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:22,414
I thought he wanted to coach for life.

502
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:25,166
It's a long story.

503
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:28,378
Basically, he lost a power struggle.
All he knew was sports.

504
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:31,339
It'd be more accurate to say
he got kicked out.

505
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,300
But you know how he is.

506
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:35,969
He chips in
to support young boxers in need

507
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:37,596
and gives them lessons.

508
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,806
Hey,
are you trying to hammer a nail?

509
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:41,850
Pardon?

510
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,643
Instead of hammering,

511
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,520
think of it as
piercing something with an awl.

512
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,066
That's better.

513
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,152
And instead of using
your shoulder to punch,

514
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:53,945
let your shoulder follow your fist.

515
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,322
Give it a try.

516
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:58,742
Try again.

517
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,911
Good. Are you a southpaw?

518
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:05,540
Yes, but the coach told me
to practice orthodox.

519
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,125
-You mean Minsoo?
-Yes.

520
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,878
Well, it is an advantage
to be a switch-hitter.

521
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:17,510
I heard you reported the fire
and carried Hyojoo out.

522
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:19,763
Um…

523
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:21,097
Are you okay?

524
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,058
Yes.

525
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:28,772
-Thanks.
-It was nothing.

526
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,070
- Keep up the good work.
- I will.

527
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,870
He's probably
having a tough time too.

528
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,081
He lives alone with his sick grandma,

529
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,458
and he used to get
into a lot of trouble at school.

530
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:51,461
Then Coach Yoon turned things around
by teaching him boxing

531
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:53,129
and allowed him to work at his restaurant.

532
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,340
He even won a gold medal
at the National Sports Festival.

533
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:56,966
He's got nice form.

534
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,968
Coach Yoon told me

535
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:02,514
that he reminds him of you
when you were young.

536
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:26,746
Hey, Joongryeok!

537
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:31,209
What are you doing here?

538
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:34,003
Can't you see?
I'm working on a construction site.

539
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:36,506
You little…

540
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:40,009
Excuse me. We'd like a bottle of soju.

541
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,511
No, we don't need it.

542
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,555
What's the matter?

543
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:46,141
Your match is coming up.
You shouldn't be drinking.

544
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:49,227
Don't tell me you're smoking too.

545
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,271
That's a no-no.

546
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:52,605
What's the big deal?

547
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:54,149
You're ready to join the national team.

548
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,775
I don't care. I need money.

549
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,278
Gosh, you're as stubborn as a mule.

550
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:04,743
Jeez, that's spicy!

551
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:06,494
Have some rice.

552
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:14,043
Use this to pay
your father's hospital bills.

553
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,340
I received my severance pay in advance.

554
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,593
I can't accept it, knowing your situation.

555
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:24,763
And I won't be able to pay you back.

556
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:27,098
You don't have to.
Just join the national team.

557
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:31,060
Win a gold medal in the Olympics
and give it to me. That's all I want.

558
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,896
Do you think
I belong on the national team?

559
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:35,273
To be honest, not at all.

560
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:37,108
You're inexperienced
and impatient,

561
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,735
and then there's your looks.

562
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,445
What's wrong with my looks?

563
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:43,031
Still, you've got sharp eyes.

564
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,743
Boxing is all about having sharp eyes.

565
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:48,578
I'm making a bet.

566
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:51,122
I'm putting everything I have on you.

567
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:53,041
I'm going all in!

568
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:57,545
So trust me
and give it another try.

569
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,592
You still have one shot in you.

570
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:15,563
Excuse me.

571
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,858
You just drank from my bottle.

572
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,151
-Is it yours?
-Yes.

573
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,236
Sorry.

574
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:25,073
The towel's mine too.

575
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:26,866
-Is it?
-Yes.

576
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,243
Sorry.

577
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:30,078
Hey, shouldn't you lose some weight?

578
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,581
Get moving. Jump rope.

579
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:34,749
Start!

580
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,211
You've got to be kidding me.

581
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:41,422
Try again!

582
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:07,073
-Goodness me.
-Hey.

583
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,618
- What are the kids doing?
- They're asleep. It's late.

584
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:12,704
-Did you eat?
-I did.

585
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:13,788
Okay.

586
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,124
Don't turn your socks inside out.

587
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:17,959
I'm not.

588
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:21,754
Don't enter the kids' room
and wake them up.

589
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:23,923
I get it. Go back to bed.

590
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:27,218
You know
it's Doona's birthday soon, right?

591
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,303
Is it?

592
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:30,847
Of course, I know that.

593
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,933
She wants a Tyrannosaurus rex.

594
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:36,102
It's the only one missing from the set.

595
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:37,687
"I look forward to meeting you, T-Rex!"

596
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,564
A Tyrannosaurus rex.

597
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,609
I'll make sure to get it for her.

598
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,402
-All right.
-Go back to bed.

599
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:46,237
-Wash up.
-I will. Good night.

600
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:39,457
Come out.

601
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:31,778
Isn't that the owner of the chicken place?

602
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:34,781
From Lucky Chicken.

603
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:35,990
Right, right?

604
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:39,410
You're right. It looks a lot like him.

605
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:40,703
Right, right?

606
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:41,913
Lucky Chicken?

607
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:44,165
Across from the chicken place
that burned down,

608
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,834
there's another chicken spot
called Lucky Chicken.

609
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,377
Right, right?

610
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:50,213
The owners never got along.

611
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:53,174
Lucky Chicken accused One Shot Chicken,
or whatever it's called,

612
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,634
of stealing all their customers.

613
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:56,594
Right, right?

614
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:58,554
I told you.

615
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,518
- Right, right?
- Right, right.

616
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:05,978
Right, right.

617
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:08,397
Right, right?

618
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,024
I told you.

619
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,068
Twin Restaurant

620
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,409
-Is this her?
-Yes.

621
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:22,370
Are you Ms. Nam Jiwon?

622
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,621
No, I'm not.

623
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:25,915
Do you go to this school?

624
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:27,750
-Yes.
-I'm sorry.

625
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,461
Let's go. Follow me.
Pull yourself together.

626
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,089
She said she was at the library,
but she won't reply.

627
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:35,133
Where could she be? Call her again.

628
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,217
Yes, sir.

629
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:43,057
Hello?

630
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,852
This is the Songwon Police.
We talked this morning.

631
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:49,856
-Okay.
-We're at the library right now.

632
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:50,940
Okay.

633
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:52,608
There she is.

634
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,318
-Are you Ms. Nam Jiwon?
-Yes.

635
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,904
We're the officers that contacted you.

636
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,906
-Okay.
-We have a few questions.

637
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,700
Could we talk outside for a moment?

638
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:03,786
I have exams today.
I have to go take them soon.

639
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,371
It'll only take a minute.

640
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,290
A minute?

641
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:11,127
Look, please be quiet.

642
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:18,968
Hello?

643
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:24,932
Lucky Chicken

644
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,188
Isn't that oil?

645
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:47,955
We're not open yet.

646
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:55,379
Uh…

647
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:57,715
I'm from the Songwon Police.

648
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,800
Are you aware of the recent fire?

649
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,719
My goodness.

650
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:04,931
With all those damn fire trucks,
how could I not know about it?

651
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,100
Uh...

652
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,185
Okay.

653
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,354
I have a few questions.

654
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:13,189
It's not my restaurant
that caught on fire.

655
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:14,982
What the hell would I know?

656
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,029
Where were you when the fire started?

657
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:21,864
Why?

658
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:25,701
Are you suspecting me?

659
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:31,374
No. This is just a routine investigation.

660
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:35,336
Go bother the victim instead.

661
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,004
Leave me alone, goddammit.

662
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:38,756
Look.

663
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:42,260
I thought you ran a chicken joint.

664
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:43,386
What?

665
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:45,805
Why are you swearing like a sailor?

666
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:50,184
Mind your language
unless this is some sailor's tavern.

667
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,852
Or should I match your attitude?

668
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:55,064
Is that what you want?

669
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:07,576
No, ma'am.

670
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,913
I apologize for my rudeness.

671
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:16,711
And this really is a chicken joint.

672
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:19,380
I'd like…

673
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,384
…to apologize too.

674
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:31,350
This is a library!
Is someone being noisy?

675
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:32,685
A birthday party?

676
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:34,270
It wasn't exactly a party.

677
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:36,439
Since Hyojoo worked the late shift,

678
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:39,025
we went to pick her up.

679
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:41,902
How long were you with her?

680
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,989
We met pretty late,

681
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,866
so by the time we got to the karaoke,

682
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:48,743
it was a little past 1 a.m.

683
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:50,119
Oh.

684
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:54,040
And you stayed there for about an hour?

685
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,541
Yes.

686
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,960
Did you all go home after that?

687
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:02,173
They were all going to sleep over
at my place,

688
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:04,425
but Hyojoo said she'd study a bit more

689
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,260
at her dad's restaurant

690
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,013
and hit the library in the morning.

691
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:10,306
At her dad's restaurant?

692
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:14,935
Look, if you need to talk, go outside.

693
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:16,604
I'm sorry.

694
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,647
Sorry doesn't cut it. Just go outside.

695
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:20,566
Look.

696
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:22,443
We're carrying out our duties right now.

697
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:25,654
Exactly!
Carry out your duties all you want,

698
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:27,239
but go outside first!

699
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:28,991
Who's being noisy now?

700
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:30,117
What's with him?

701
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,535
Lower your voice, please.

702
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:32,620
I'm sorry.

703
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:37,500
So she slept at the restaurant?

704
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:39,293
Was there anything unusual?

705
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,213
No.

706
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:43,923
For goodness' sake!

707
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:49,845
All that studying
must've driven him crazy.

708
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,472
He's so noisy.

709
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:00,815
Thank you.

710
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,702
I hope you'll ace your exams.
You've got this!

711
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:27,091
Student ID Card
Yoon Hyojoo

712
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:34,265
Evidence
Cell phone

713
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,855
You want to check her cell phone?

714
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:42,022
Oh.

715
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:43,566
Yes, Ms. Jung.

716
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:47,194
-But it's badly damaged.
-Mm-hmm.

717
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:51,240
I'm restoring data from her cloud backup.

718
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,909
Cloud what?

719
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,495
You don't know what that is?

720
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:57,997
Isn't that a beer…

721
00:40:58,914 --> 00:40:59,915
What is it?

722
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:04,587
Since her devices
were connected to the cloud,

723
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:07,089
we can transfer data
from her cell phone to this device.

724
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:09,925
At least up to the latest backup.

725
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,677
Hold on. Let me check her calendar.

726
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,723
Jiwon's birthday party

727
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:19,226
How can I search the internet?

728
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:22,688
-There you go. One step at a time.
-Thanks.

729
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:30,529
Self-defense weapons
Reporting a stalker

730
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:34,450
Fortunately,
the fire started after business hours,

731
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:37,036
but the owner's daughter
happened to be here.

732
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:40,873
If this was arson,
the culprit must've known the passcode.

733
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:43,876
There must only be a handful of people
who know the passcode,

734
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:45,753
including the owner's daughter.

735
00:41:56,347 --> 00:42:01,268
Seoul Busters

736
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,353
Next time on Seoul Busters.

737
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:04,563
Let's summon
all the suspects first.

738
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,691
Four arson suspects
are summoned to the daycare center.

739
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,902
I'm sure
this stalker's the culprit.

740
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:10,986
There you have it.

741
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,739
Nam Junghyun is singled out
as the prime suspect.

742
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:15,241
We don't know for sure yet.

743
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:17,618
Meanwhile,
Junghwan searches for a T-Rex.

744
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,246
-Hey, Donggoo! Donggoo!
-Cool, right?

745
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:22,248
Can you please give me that T-Rex?

746
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:23,582
I don't want to.

747
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:26,835
Will Junghwan manage
to receive the T-Rex from me?

748
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:28,420
Ah!

749
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:30,506
Back at the Violent Crimes Team.

750
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:33,175
I think the culprit is…

751
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,426
Nam Junghyun!

752
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,679
I know you're here, you bastard!

753
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:39,014
I think you should
leave this case to us.

754
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:40,683
Why are you doing this?

755
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:43,435
That's what I should be asking you.

756
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,729
There is always only one truth!

757
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,440
To be continued…

758
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:50,526
