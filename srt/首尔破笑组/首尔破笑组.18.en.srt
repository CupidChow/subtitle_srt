<i>a Korean student was murdered
in the US similarly.</i>

8
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:01,770
Both victims were anesthetized
and then suffocated.

9
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,188
<i>Any substances in the system?</i>

10
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:05,732
Ketaflurane.
It's a general anesthetic.

11
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:08,777
It's not readily available to the public.

12
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,905
As a psychoactive drug,

13
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,364
<i>it's even harder to obtain.</i>

19
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:08,545
{\an8}Hello?

20
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:11,673
It looks like no one's here.

21
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,925
Man, these are super expensive.

22
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,303
They're really hard to come by.

23
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,848
- Hello.
- Hello.

24
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,724
- We're...
- Later.

25
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,434
- Sorry?
- Please carry them inside.

26
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:24,936
- Sure.
- You mean these?

27
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,312
- Lift them, Detective Seo.
- But...

28
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:29,649
"Detective Seo"? Are you detectives?

29
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:32,277
- Yes.
- We're from Songwon Police.

30
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,279
We need to ask you a few questions.

31
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:35,947
So you're detectives.

32
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,323
I thought you were suppliers.

33
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,912
It's true Hyunjoo worked at this bar,

34
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,248
but I don't have much to say about her.

35
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,292
She was quiet and hard-working.

36
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:50,712
Did any customers ever hit on her

37
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:52,422
or get into fights with her?

38
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,507
She got along with the customers.

39
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,426
As you can see,

40
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,470
this bar isn't for just anyone.

41
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:00,972
I see.

42
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:04,559
So you mean your customers are special?

43
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:05,935
They are. Very.

44
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,854
This is a high-end bar after all.

45
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:12,775
What's wrong?

46
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:18,156
Anyway, I don't have anything to say
about our customers either.

47
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:21,492
All right. Thank you for your time.

48
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:22,827
Let's go.

49
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,625
Why were you being so sensitive
back there?

50
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,376
It's what he said.

51
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,129
Does having money
make you more special than others?

52
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,882
Of course. It absolutely does.

53
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:39,302
Anyway, wouldn't it be nice
to grab a drink at a place like this?

54
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,221
You're more of a rice soup and soju
kind of guy.

55
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:42,972
I enjoy a fancy drink
sometimes...

56
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,057
Excuse me.

57
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,351
Did you remember something?

58
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:49,896
That's not it.
This is just a common industry practice.

59
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,689
- What?
- What do you mean?

60
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,818
- My goodness! What are you doing?
- What the...

61
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,780
It's bad luck
to have uninvited guests

62
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:00,198
before business hours.

63
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,742
It can really hurt sales.
So please understand.

64
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:06,204
- This is expensive sea salt though.
- Stop it!

65
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,331
What are you doing?
This is obstruction of justice...

66
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,417
But the next time you stop by,
your drinks are on the house.

67
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,627
Oh, you didn't have to.

68
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,879
- Goodbye.
- Thank you.

69
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,509
Why would you take that?
This is humiliating.

70
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,094
He offered, so I took it.

71
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:22,845
You're completely hopeless.

72
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,764
I'm going to return it. I'm not taking it.

73
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:25,932
Go ahead.

74
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:31,896
Come here for a second.

75
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,901
I have something to tell you
about Hyunjoo.

76
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,156
SHIT WELL DAYCARE CENTER

77
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,368
According to the bartender,
one of the customers

78
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,370
was stalking the late Ms. Jung Hyunjoo.

79
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,997
His name is Choi Jungsoo.

80
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,999
Ms. Jung's call history shows

81
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:54,502
that he persistently called
and messaged her.

82
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:56,212
He often visited the bar too.

83
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,840
If he works
at a pharmaceutical company,

84
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:01,718
he must've been able to easily obtain
Gestapo or whatever it's called.

85
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,220
It's ketaflurane, not Gestapo.

86
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,515
Gestapo, gazpacho, or whatever.

87
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:11,185
Anyway, gazpacho... No, I mean...

88
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,812
You made me confused!

89
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:16,065
Ketaflurane isn't easy to obtain,

90
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,650
but since he's a pharmaceutical salesman,

91
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,528
he must know
a lot of doctors and pharmacists.

92
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:23,281
- That's what I'm saying.
- Everything's falling into place.

93
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:25,283
My hunch says
something's definitely fishy.

94
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:26,951
Listen up.

95
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:30,330
When he couldn't get closer to her,
he lost control and...

96
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,623
I think you're jumping to conclusions.

97
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:35,126
I agree.
You're getting ahead of yourself again.

98
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:36,210
So typical.

99
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,006
Let's go talk to Choi Jungsoo first.

100
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,175
Excellent idea, as always.

101
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:43,718
I knew something was fishy about him.

102
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,262
Since when?

103
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,347
What?

104
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,439
Seriously, aren't you ashamed of yourself?

105
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,066
What do you mean?

106
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,942
Stop buttering up the captain.

107
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,487
I'm so sick of you kissing his ass.

108
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,489
I can't stand the sight of it.

109
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:08,368
I'm not trying to butter him up.
He's just always right.

110
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,119
You're pathetic.

111
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:12,705
You're out of line.

112
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,291
What are you talking about?
Have you no pride?

113
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,877
Then again, if you did,
you wouldn't stoop so low.

114
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,213
If you'd been born
during the Joseon Dynasty,

115
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,715
you'd have spent your life
sucking up to the king

116
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,717
and then sold out our country.

117
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,970
Indeed, Master Joongryeok.

118
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,889
- Cut it out.
- What did I do?

119
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:36,938
What are you looking at?

120
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:38,147
Sorry.

121
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,579
SEOUL BUSTERS

122
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:57,417
I'm sorry I'm late.

123
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,710
What took you so long?
We've been waiting.

124
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:01,712
- Have a seat.
- Yes, sir.

125
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,215
You already know Professor Sim.

126
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:05,675
This is Cpt. Kwak from Yeongdeungpo.

127
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,510
- You've met, right?
- Yes.

128
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,513
You didn't have to do this.
We said we could handle the case.

129
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,890
The jurisdiction
for the Songnae Mountain case

130
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:16,936
is a bit unclear,
so I'll have both teams work on it.

131
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,522
We still need someone in charge,

132
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,442
so I'll have Professor Sim
oversee the profiling

133
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,152
and lead the case.

134
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,612
"Lead the case" is a bit of
an overstatement.

135
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,449
I'll mainly just be a mediator
between the teams.

136
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:30,908
I hope that's all right.

137
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:32,910
It's no problem.

138
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,621
Who cares about jurisdictions?
We're all part of the same force.

139
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,832
Just work together to solve the case.

140
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,713
With the case
getting the spotlight,

141
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,299
the higher-ups seem to want to resolve it
as quickly as possible.

142
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,427
That's why they're having two teams
work on it at the same time.

143
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,889
Did you find anything at the scene?

144
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,099
- Not yet.
- So you did.

145
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,350
What is it?

146
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,437
The MO is similar to that in Jaein's case.

147
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,439
The scene looks similar too.

148
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,108
Do you think
it's the same person?

149
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:06,444
It's possible.

150
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:09,697
If it's the same person,

151
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,407
are you suspecting Junho?

152
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,034
I'm looking into it.

153
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,330
I haven't mentioned this
because I thought it was irrelevant,

154
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,249
but I've been tailing Han Junho

155
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,461
these past few days.

156
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:27,298
I had a feeling he was involved
in the recent kidnapping case.

157
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,885
Maybe it was a coincidence,

158
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,305
but I think he caught on
to the fact that I was tailing him,

159
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:37,058
so I lost him.

160
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,935
Come to think of it,

161
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,604
that was the day the murder happened.

162
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,611
HAN-A BANK

163
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,322
<i>Welcome.</i>

164
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,033
<i>Your card is being read.</i>

165
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,451
Hi, honey.

166
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,787
I just arrived at the bank
to ask about the loan,

167
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,497
but they're closed.

168
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,583
Ah, I'm late again.

169
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:07,755
Yeah.

170
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:10,508
Really?

171
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,094
Okay.

172
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:15,888
You need cash? I'll withdraw some.

173
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,723
Okay.

174
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,559
<i>Welcome.</i>

175
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:27,233
With that much cash,
you should've gone to a teller.

176
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:29,694
What do you care?

177
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,530
<i>Please wait a moment.</i>

178
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,157
You're depositing so much money.

179
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:38,244
- Got a problem with that?
- Not really.

180
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,746
- What's all of that for?
- None of your business.

181
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,708
- It might be.
- It's not, so stay out of it.

182
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,710
- But...
- Wait!

183
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,712
Knock it off, or I'll call the police.

184
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,505
- Do it.
- I will.

185
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,881
Do it right now.

186
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,258
Fine, I will!

187
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,515
Hello, this is Sergeant Jung Junghwan
from the Songwon Police Station.

188
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,102
How can I help you?

189
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:09,734
BANK ACCOUNTS FOR PAYMENT

190
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,777
He's a money mule
for a voice phishing ring.

191
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:15,239
You're under arrest.

192
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,869
<i>On the afternoon of the 28th,
a police officer visited a bank.</i>

193
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:23,706
<i>He spotted and arrested a money mule
involved in a voice phishing ring.</i>

194
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,917
<i>Thanks to his efforts, countless victims</i>

195
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:30,838
<i>were able to recover their money.</i>

196
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:34,467
<i>One of those victims had lost
the funds he had saved up</i>

197
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,177
<i>for his wife's surgery...</i>

198
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,638
You're incredible.

199
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,890
I just got lucky.

200
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,267
It's not just luck.

201
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,353
You were a professional shooter
for a reason.

202
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,563
He's got such a sharp eye.

203
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,025
Jung Junghwan,
the Hawkeye of the Songwon Police.

204
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,778
Stop it.

205
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,571
Swoosh!

206
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,490
Knock it off.

207
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,408
- It's you!
<i>- As a police officer,</i>

208
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,953
<i>I make it a habit to surround my observ...</i>

209
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,373
<i>I mean, I make it a habit
to observe my surroundings.</i>

210
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,917
- I'm so awkward.
<i>- That's why</i>

211
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,296
<i>I was able to spot
the money mule immediately.</i>

212
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:16,801
Jeez, that's a load of bull.

213
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:19,053
I was on camera.
I couldn't say that I just got lucky.

214
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,889
I see everyone's here.

215
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,599
Captain.

216
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:27,937
The voice phishing ring
that Detective Jung rounded up

217
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,940
turned out to be
the most active one as of late.

218
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:35,111
We managed to recover most of the money
using the confiscated phone.

219
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:38,989
It's likely

220
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:42,201
you'll get a special promotion
to the next rank.

221
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,330
A special promotion?

222
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,998
I put in a good word for you.

223
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,667
- Good luck!
- Thank you.

224
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,670
I'll never forget your kindness, Captain.

225
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:55,297
Hold on.
If you're promoted to the next rank,

226
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,050
- you two will be at the same rank.
- Amazing!

227
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,969
- Right?
- Is that right?

228
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,262
Will that make things awkward?

229
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,806
What do you think, buddy?

230
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,433
- Nice.
- Good one.

231
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,435
"Buddy"?

232
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:08,936
I'm just joking.

233
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,938
He's sensitive these days, isn't he?

234
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,899
Hey, buddy.

235
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,902
Lighten up a bit, will you?

236
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:19,530
Hey, cut it out.

237
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:22,283
Whether you get a promotion or not,
we're still at work.

238
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,201
What's with you?

239
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,996
Don't tell me you're sulking. Are you?

240
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,415
- Don't be silly.
- Are you sulking?

241
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:32,376
- Are you?
- He's totally sulking.

242
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,046
- He's sulking, right?
- He definitely is!

243
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:40,843
I'm not sulking. What do you take me for?
Get a grip, will you?

244
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,804
I was just joking.

245
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:46,515
Whatever.

246
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,601
- Jeez. He is sulking.
- Detective Seo.

247
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:51,937
- Let's go talk to Choi Jungsoo.
- You're going to meet with him?

248
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,981
Yes, I am. Let's go.

249
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,065
Okay.

250
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,073
I'm going to the bathroom.

251
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,417
I did it. I really did it.

252
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,051
Over here.

253
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:24,178
We're over here.

254
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:30,434
I'm busy. Cut to the chase.
Keep it short as you promised.

255
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,479
You've heard
about Hyunjoo's murder, right?

256
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,690
Yes, I saw the news.

257
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:42,404
I do feel sorry for her,
but what does that have to do with me?

258
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,865
We heard you were following
and contacting her

259
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,158
against her will.

260
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,869
- So?
- Is that true?

261
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,332
So what if it's true?
What are you trying to say?

262
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:55,835
Where were you on the day of the murder?

263
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:59,713
I think I was at my mother's place.

264
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,298
Where does she live?

265
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,883
She lives in Changwon-dong.

266
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,427
That's near Songnae Mountain.

267
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,762
So what?

268
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,264
Am I the killer

269
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,391
because my mom lives
near Songnae Mountain?

270
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:12,142
Are you not?

271
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:16,063
"Are you not?"
What the hell are you doing?

272
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:21,485
If you want to question me
further, bring a warrant first.

273
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,737
I don't have time for this.

274
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,867
Why is he so worked up?

275
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,785
Does he think
he's the only one with a temper?

276
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,121
This exceeds my expectations.

277
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,707
What do you mean? He's the worst!

278
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,918
The more I drink it, the richer it gets.
Mm.

279
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,630
How can you be so relaxed
in this situation?

280
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:46,343
We're heading to Changwon-dong, right?

281
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,511
No, we're not.

282
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:49,513
We're not?

283
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,098
He lied.

284
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:53,225
He did?

285
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,604
He wasn't at his mom's place
on the day of the murder.

286
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,856
He made that up.

287
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,276
Did the kids see the news?

288
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:07,406
Ah, Captain put in a good word for me
so I can get a promotion.

289
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,534
Honey, once I get promoted,

290
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,871
things will get a lot better for us.

291
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,999
I'm not going for drinks.
I'll be home early.

292
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,043
See you.

293
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,880
So all that kissing up
finally paid off.

294
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,298
It was all worthwhile.

295
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,677
Do you mean that?
I'm starting to think you do.

296
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,138
Did I say anything wrong?

297
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:34,892
Do you really mean that?

298
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,644
Don't be like that.

299
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:38,729
Cut it out.

300
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:41,106
Go ahead and call me "buddy" again.
We're the same rank now.

301
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,360
Are you seriously sulking? For real?

302
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:48,614
Stop saying I'm sulking.
Show some respect!

303
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,240
I mean...

304
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,910
You were busy sucking up to Captain

305
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,411
while I was working my butt off.

306
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,914
How does it feel to win a promotion
by kissing up

307
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:57,998
while I was slaving away?

308
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,501
Why didn't you kiss up more?

309
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:03,045
- What's the point of slaving away?
- Are you done?

310
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:06,590
My apologies, Lieutenant Moo.
Are you happy now?

311
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:10,761
You're just jealous. Stop picking a fight.

312
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,390
My patience has limits!

313
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,433
That little...

314
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,604
It's hot. Damn it.

315
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,692
HONGMYO CHINESE RESTAURANT

316
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:29,822
Damn it.

317
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:32,491
Why can't people leave us alone?

318
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,454
Hey, how much money did we lose
because of that cop?

319
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:40,165
Around five billion won
in total, Boss.

320
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,627
They froze all of our accounts too.

321
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,632
Look into that detective's background.

322
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,092
What for?

323
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,927
We need to get even with him.

324
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,471
I'll make him pay for messing with us.

325
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,684
- Hurry up.
- Yes, Boss.

326
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:13,699
Jung Junghwan, Sergeant

327
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:17,244
I checked the CCTV
around Choi Jungsoo's mother's place,

328
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,163
but he wasn't caught on it.

329
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,166
So he really wasn't there.

330
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,877
If he wasn't caught on the CCTV,
he obviously wasn't there.

331
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,798
Exactly. I already said that.

332
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:33,260
Why act like you're the only one
who figured that out?

333
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:35,054
I'm not.

334
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,306
Exactly. You're not the only one
who knows that.

335
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,851
I was just adding my input.

336
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,853
Why? Are you a commentator or something?

337
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,688
Fine, let's hear from you.

338
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,941
I'm already talking. Stop acting
like you're the only one with ears.

339
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,569
I know you have ears too.

340
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,654
I do. I have two of them.

341
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,324
Guess what? I have two eyes too.

342
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,786
Two eyes? Good for you.
You're being so childish.

343
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,037
Come here.

344
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,831
Are you two going to keep this up?

345
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,336
Are you done?

346
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:14,843
It's a bit fishy
that he lied about his alibi.

347
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,513
Let's keep an eye on him
for the time being.

348
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,098
Yes, sir.

349
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:24,311
<i>We've identified a suspect
in the Songnae Mountain case.</i>

350
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:25,646
<i>I'll tell you more in person.</i>

NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

352
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,440
You've identified a suspect?

00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,734
Skipping the small talk, I see.

354
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:35,030
I looked over the entire case file
after what you told me.

355
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:40,953
You're probably thinking
this too. Our prime suspect

356
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,413
is Han Junho.

357
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,212
While you were struggling
with Jaein's case,

358
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,506
I did what I could to solve the case.

359
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:55,551
People said the TTK had returned,
but it turned out to be incorrect.

360
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,845
Those were the profiling results.

361
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,930
<i>The MO was slightly different
as well.</i>

362
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:04,935
More importantly, the TTK was
a Caucasian salesman in his fifties.

363
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:10,524
That means Jaein's case
was likely just a copycat.

364
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,401
Precisely my point.

365
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:18,157
It seems the culprit
carefully orchestrated his crime

366
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,576
to make it appear
as part of the notorious cold case.

367
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,203
Be honest.

368
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,414
Han Junho is the reason
you came back to Korea, isn't it?

369
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:28,417
You said you believe
Jaein left a dying message.

370
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,501
"Friend."

371
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:34,131
FRIEND

372
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:38,594
It seems like you're relying
more on imagination than evidence.

373
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:44,725
Right. I forgot
how much you love evidence.

374
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:48,896
I found a suspicious number
in Jung Hyunjoo's call history.

375
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,440
- Is it Choi Jungsoo's number?
- There's one more.

376
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,651
Someone regularly called her
late at night.

377
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:56,987
She either rejected the calls

378
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,990
or hung up after just 10 to 20 seconds.

379
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,409
It's clear she didn't want to
talk to this person.

380
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,954
The number belongs
to a missing person in his fifties.

381
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,539
So it's a burner phone?

382
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,416
I tried calling the number.

383
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,923
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

384
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,424
<i>Hello?</i>

385
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:18,926
Jaein.

386
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,940
What do you think?

387
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,149
Do you recognize the voice?

388
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,610
I did right away.

389
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,279
It's Han Junho.

390
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:42,699
I traced the phone just in case,

391
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,244
and it led to his address.

392
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:49,998
It's also suspicious that he worked
at a hospital for a long time.

393
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:54,169
Ketaflurane isn't easy to come by.

394
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:03,220
Ah. How could we have missed
the burner phone?

395
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:05,347
Captain told us to let it go.

396
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,016
We were preoccupied
with finding Choi Jungsoo.

397
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,894
Anyway, I wonder

398
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:14,481
how Professor Sim figured out
the number belonged to a burner phone.

399
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,359
Should I be trained at the FBI too?

400
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,694
Can you speak English?

401
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,280
Yes, I can.

402
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,865
Your English is good!

403
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,743
My English is very, very good.

404
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:30,706
Be quiet. And are you going
to go through that all night?

405
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,124
We have a case to work on.

406
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,084
This is important too.

407
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:37,879
I'm going to go through it all
and make sure this perv rots in prison.

408
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:42,134
If you're tired, I can take over.

409
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,387
Hm, I can take care of it.

410
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:47,681
But can you get me some coffee?

411
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:49,641
I'll make you a really nice cup.

412
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:52,060
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

413
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:54,104
Who's going
to Jungsoo's workplace?

414
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:56,064
Detective Jung is.

415
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,149
When?

416
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,609
- Sorry?
- When is he going?

417
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,821
Just a second.

418
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:10,454
Detective Moo is wondering when
you're going to Choi Jungsoo's workplace.

419
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:11,955
I'm going when I'm going.

420
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,583
Tell him to mind his own business.

421
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:18,670
He's going when he's going.

422
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:20,589
He's not going alone, is he?

423
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:23,884
Who are you going with?

424
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,427
Anyone but him.

425
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:30,932
- "Anyone but him."
- That's just rude.

426
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:35,896
- "That's just rude."
- Why be polite when talking to myself?

427
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:38,398
"Why be polite when talking to myself?"

428
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,567
Tell him to shut his mouth
unless he has a death wish.

429
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,110
"Shut your mouth unless..."

430
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,488
Tell him to shut his mouth,
or I'll make him regret it.

431
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:45,572
What?

432
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:48,492
Stop it, both of you.
Why are you being like this?

433
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,327
Don't cross the line.

434
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,330
You're being ridiculous.
Who's crossing the line here?

435
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:54,873
Are you saying I am?

436
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:56,208
- Come here.
- Fine, I'm coming.

437
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,627
- Stop them!
- What is it?

438
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,796
- Don't do that!
- What do you want?

439
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:01,922
Stop it!

440
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:03,590
What's going on here?

441
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,012
Make up.

442
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,306
I'm at my limit, Captain.

443
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,433
- This rude little brat...
- Who's being rude here?

444
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:18,438
I've been putting up with him
for a long time.

445
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,608
Would you two rather be
officially disciplined?

446
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,904
Go ahead and make up.

447
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:31,034
Detective Jung, since your rank is lower,
you should apologize first.

448
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:32,702
Ah...

449
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:35,622
Detective Jung?

450
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:38,083
Okay.

451
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:45,257
I'm sorry.

452
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,469
Detective Moo?

453
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:57,936
I'm...

454
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:02,107
sorry.

455
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:03,567
Yeah.

456
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,318
- Did you say you were sorry?
- Yes.

457
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:07,779
Shake hands now.

458
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:10,407
Come on.

459
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:27,674
Now, say "I love you" and hug each other.

460
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:28,758
I don't think...

461
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,594
I'm serious.

462
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:35,390
Come on.

463
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,145
I love you.

464
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:42,063
I love you too.

465
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,818
How beautiful.

466
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,154
Until I come back,

467
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:53,533
sit in those thinking chairs
and think about each other.

468
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,785
You have five minutes.

469
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,622
WHEN YOU HAD A FIGHT WITH YOUR FRIENDS

470
00:24:58,705 --> 00:24:59,748
1. APOLOGIZE
2. MAKE UP

471
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,666
3. SAY "I LOVE YOU" AND HUG EACH OTHER

472
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:15,805
I'll head over.

473
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,350
You should go with Detective Moo.

474
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,352
I'll go with the rookie tomorrow.

475
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:21,520
Sounds good.

476
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,731
What do you say?

477
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:28,902
I'll go tomorrow. Rookie, you go with him.

478
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:31,321
Get ready. I'll bring the car around.

479
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:32,405
Okay.

480
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,658
Are you really not going?

481
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,536
I'll go.

482
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:47,295
Is Choi Jungsoo
going home anytime soon?

483
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,964
Maybe he's working late.

484
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:52,092
Everyone seems to work so hard.

485
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,594
What's this?

486
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,054
"TAKE OUR SURVEY FOR A FREE COFFEE"

487
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:57,180
Nice.

488
00:25:58,598 --> 00:25:59,849
You really love free...

489
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,727
- What?
- It's nothing.

490
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,063
It's my lucky day.

491
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,316
DOWNLOADING...

492
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:10,902
Okay.

493
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:13,655
I managed to hack
that cop's phone, Boss.

494
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:16,866
What? Just like that?

495
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,869
What kind of cop is so lax about security?

496
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,454
I know.

497
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:23,540
CONNECTED

498
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,001
<i>Bye, Daddy.</i>

499
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,712
<i>I love you, Daddy.</i>

500
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:30,380
<i>Have a nice day.</i>

501
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,466
<i>- Don't get sick and come home early.
- Come home early.</i>

502
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,468
<i>Come play with us.</i>

503
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:36,928
<i>- I love you.
- I love you.</i>

504
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:39,222
Oh, Detective Jung!

505
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,433
He's looking.

506
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:51,985
Oh. Captain!

507
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,908
There's something you should see, Captain.

508
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,297
That's Jung Hyunjoo, right?

509
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,799
I think so. When was this?

510
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:15,967
The day of the murder.

511
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:36,029
- Wait, what?
- Huh?

512
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:37,113
He's making a turn.

513
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:39,324
That's not the direction
he's supposed to go.

514
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:42,661
I know. He's not headed home either.

515
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:45,413
No?

516
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:49,793
- All right, let's keep following him.
- Okay.

517
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:28,123
OUTDOOR CLOTHING DISCOUNT STORE

518
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,844
What do you think this place is?

519
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:42,345
I have no idea.

520
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,015
I have a feeling it's a gambling ring.

521
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,309
Let's inform Captain.

522
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,394
Hold on.

523
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:52,522
We might be mistaken,
so let's wait until we're sure.

524
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,274
Got it.

525
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:01,823
<i>Delivery.</i>

526
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,283
<i>Here's your meal.</i>

527
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:04,534
<i>You gave us the wrong address,</i>

528
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:06,161
<i>so the food's soggy.
Eat it quickly.</i>

529
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,580
- What idiot ordered food here?
<i>- Orders are piling up.</i>

530
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,382
One more energy drink.

531
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:20,884
Hello.

532
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:25,138
Who are you? What do you want?

533
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,391
Hello.

534
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,977
The food got all soggy.

535
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:33,188
We were lost for a while.

536
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:36,065
I'm not sure who placed the order though.

537
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,693
- The food got soggy.
- Eat it right away.

538
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:39,903
- Here you go.
- Enjoy.

539
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:41,321
Bye.

540
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:43,740
Hold on. Stop right there.

541
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:46,242
Turn around.

542
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,495
I said turn around!

543
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:55,084
We don't order food here.

544
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:58,421
Are you sure you're here to deliver food?

545
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:01,633
- Of course. Why else would we be here?
- Right.

546
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:03,885
- The food's all soggy.
- Enjoy.

547
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:04,969
Bye.

548
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:08,431
- Hey, search them.
- What?

549
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:11,518
- Hold on.
- Come on, stop it.

550
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:12,852
What are you doing?

551
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,145
Wait.

552
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:15,438
- Come on.
- Boss.

553
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:16,940
They're cops.

554
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:18,233
What? Cops?

555
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:22,779
Why the hell would cops
sneak in here?

556
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:24,781
We have no choice.
Detective Jang, request backup.

557
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:25,907
Okay.

558
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,534
How dare you?

559
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,786
- I'll remember your faces.
<i>- The number you dialed</i>

560
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:32,288
<i>- cannot be reached at the moment.</i>
- Detective Jung.

561
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:35,208
<i>- Please try again later.</i>
- I'm calling to request backup!

562
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:37,752
Trace my phone for the location.

563
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,963
- Send in the Special Operations Unit.
- That sounds good.

564
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:43,216
Cut it out.
The Special Operations Unit?

565
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:46,219
We've blocked the signal here,
so you can't make phone calls.

566
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:52,976
You blocked the signal?
That's going to get you in more trouble.

567
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,811
This is why we had a team on standby.

568
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:56,604
Out of the way.

569
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,524
- Move out of the way.
- Just let us through.

570
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:03,027
- Standby team, move in!
- Come in!

571
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,322
Maybe they can't hear us. Standby team...

572
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:10,493
There's no one outside.

573
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:15,832
Calm down and stay seated!
Don't worry, it's no big deal.

574
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:18,585
This day just keeps getting
worse and worse.

575
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:21,004
These cops were putting on a show.

576
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:24,549
You're actually here to deliver food.

577
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:26,217
You're wearing uniforms and everything.

578
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:29,470
And you got into a fight with my customers

579
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,973
and got beaten to a pulp.

580
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:34,434
That's the story
we're going to stick to, okay?

581
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:38,187
I guess we'll have to show them
what we've got.

582
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:43,151
Goodness. Dear customers!

583
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:46,362
We'll get back to business
as soon as we're done with these cops.

584
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,156
- Handle them.
- Tansik.

585
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,240
Detective Jung.

586
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,161
You bastards.

587
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,204
Let's teach them a lesson.

588
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:56,956
Stay where you are.

589
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:59,125
You little bastards.

590
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,961
I said stay where you are!

591
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:32,116
What are you waiting for?
Request backup.

592
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,327
Okay.

593
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:51,219
Hurry up and get in.
Move along. Get in the car.

594
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:55,348
Damn it! Are cops
allowed to fire guns these days?

595
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,141
Are we in Hollywood or something?

596
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:15,535
Are you okay?
That must've scared you.

597
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,913
I'm okay. But Detective Jung...

598
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,916
All kinds of things happen while on duty.

599
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,085
Still...

600
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:26,713
Worst case, I'll face disciplinary action.

601
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,424
I was supposed to be promoted anyway,

602
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,259
so it'll balance out.

603
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:37,974
Don't worry.
Just go and get some witness statements.

604
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,893
- I'll go brief the team.
- Okay.

605
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:55,324
Would you mind dropping me off
at my precinct?

606
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:56,868
All the cars are full.

607
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:58,870
Sure. Get in.

608
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:04,042
Is this the shortcut
you talked about?

609
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,419
Keep going straight.

610
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,839
The road is so rough.

611
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:13,342
It leads to Songnae Mountain,
so yes, it can be a bit rough.

612
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,136
Songun Temple

613
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,305
I didn't know
there was a temple here.

614
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:21,517
Is this the only road
to the Songnae Mountain parking lot?

615
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:25,146
Yes, this is the only road
for cars.

616
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:27,440
I wonder if the temple has CCTVs.

617
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,363
The man who got shot

618
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:37,325
has hired a lawyer
and is formally pressing charges.

619
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,827
That's already bad enough,

620
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,914
but if the press starts accusing us
of using excessive force,

621
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:44,624
we'll be in serious trouble.

622
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:48,544
I'm sure Detective Jung had
a good reason for firing his gun.

623
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,546
Reason, my foot.

624
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:54,634
Do you think the other officers
don't know how to use their guns?

625
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:59,013
The man isn't even a felon.
He just ran a gambling ring.

626
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,601
And here I was,
thinking things were going well for once.

627
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:05,186
What are you going to do?

628
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,813
I'll take responsibility.

629
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:10,775
What do you mean? How?

630
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:12,068
I'll do whatever it takes.

631
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,028
That's easier said than done.

632
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:19,826
You can either follow
formal disciplinary procedures

633
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,369
or keep things simple

634
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:24,163
and suspend him for a month.

635
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:27,375
That's the best solution I can think of.

636
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,253
Let's follow formal procedures.

637
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:33,005
- Hey, Dongbang!
- The Detective Jung I know

638
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:37,426
would never use his weapon
without a good reason.

639
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:43,641
If that's what you insist on doing,
suit yourself.

640
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:46,769
But he's on probation
until a decision is made.

641
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:49,188
Understood.

642
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:52,942
SONGWON POLICE STATION
HAS MOVED TO A TEMPORARY LOCATION

643
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,821
I can finally get some much-needed rest.

644
00:35:58,197 --> 00:35:59,782
Hey, it's not like I'm fired.

645
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:02,243
Why do you look so down?

646
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,537
It's all my fault.

647
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:06,831
I'm so sorry.

648
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:08,833
Don't say that. It's not your fault.

649
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:11,502
Will there be a disciplinary hearing?

650
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:13,504
Yes.

651
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,549
Captain suggested
that I present my side of the story,

652
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:17,800
and I agreed.

653
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:22,805
Use this as a chance
to get some good rest.

654
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,724
Spend plenty of time with your kids.

655
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,899
I just feel bad.
I get to rest while you work.

656
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:36,736
Rookie, you need to work extra hard, okay?

657
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,573
Come on. Don't be like that.

658
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:46,579
I'm off.

659
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:49,123
- Let me carry that.
- Stay here.

660
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:53,920
We'll see you off.

661
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,154
<i>Captain, we're entering
Han Junho's place.</i>

662
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:26,035
Could you sign this, please?

663
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:27,828
Here.

664
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:33,251
Sign here and here.
Sign the next page as well.

665
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:46,389
Sign here too.

666
00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:59,193
I've found the shoes.

667
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:02,029
Well done. Keep him there for now.

668
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,615
What should we do? Seems pretty clear-cut.

669
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,701
- Let's arrest him.
- Okay.

670
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:07,785
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

671
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:14,208
- Han Junho, you're under arrest.
- What?

672
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:19,297
Han Junho, you're under arrest
for the murder of Jung Hyunjoo.

673
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,507
Who the hell is that?

674
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:24,552
- Let's talk at the station.
- Why should I go there?

675
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,178
- Take him away.
- Let go!

676
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:28,973
Wait! Hold on!

677
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,725
You can talk at the station.

678
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,560
Do you have any evidence?

679
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:22,318
<i>The victim was most likely
murdered in her home.</i>

680
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,519
<i>She was wearing loafers earlier that day</i>

681
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:59,939
<i>but was found dead in sneakers.</i>

682
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:02,233
<i>Also,</i>

683
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,568
<i>her necklace disappeared.</i>

684
00:40:56,203 --> 00:41:01,125
"DETECTIVE JUNG JUNGHWAN"

685
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,140
Captain.
I have something to tell you.

686
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:23,564
Detective Jung fired his gun that day...

687
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,067
because of me.

688
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:11,570
Tansik!

689
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:37,054
Come here.

690
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,974
Drop the gun.

691
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:41,850
Drop it!

692
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:44,270
Drop the gun,

693
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:47,690
or I'll kill this woman.

694
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:50,317
Drop the gun!

695
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:09,670
Tansik, get a hold of yourself.

696
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:12,172
Right.

697
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:17,803
What are you waiting for?
Request backup.

698
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:19,847
Okay.

699
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:30,107
<i>It's all my fault.</i>

700
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,987
I'm the one
who should face discipline.

701
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,199
When you lose your weapon,
there's only one possible outcome.

702
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:40,909
Dismissal.

703
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:47,458
Thanks to Detective Jung,
you didn't lose your firearm.

704
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,879
You can't be disciplined
for something that never happened.

705
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:55,299
Focus on the investigation for now.

706
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:58,802
I understand how you feel,
but get back to work.

707
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:17,237
Hello?

708
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,740
<i>Hello, is this
Sergeant Jung Junghwan's home?</i>

709
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:21,784
Yes. Who am I speaking to?

710
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:24,036
<i>This is Cha Taesik
from the Financial Support Team</i>

711
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:25,579
<i>at the Police Mutual Aid Association.</i>

712
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:27,623
I see. Hello.

713
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:31,585
<i>We've been trying to reach Sergeant Jung
regarding refinancing.</i>

714
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:33,504
Refinancing?

715
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:36,173
<i>Yes. You currently have a mortgage
with the bank, correct?</i>

716
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:38,384
If you switch to us,
you can enjoy a grace period

717
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:40,469
of up to seven years
at an extremely low interest rate.

718
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:43,472
<i>His application has been approved,</i>

719
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:45,057
<i>but we couldn't reach him.</i>

720
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,685
<i>If you don't act quickly,
you might miss this opportunity.</i>

721
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:49,645
We need to finalize this
before the bank closes.

722
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:53,023
<i>Before the bank closes?
Let me see.</i>

723
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:55,442
That's soon.

724
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:59,488
Yes, that's why I contacted you.

725
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:02,324
He did mention this the other day.

726
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:05,119
I see. That's probably
why he looked into our program.

727
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:08,038
<i>Do we have to decide today?</i>

728
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:10,082
Yes. As you probably know,

729
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:13,669
the funds aren't sufficient
to meet the demand.

730
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:17,089
What exactly do I need to do?

731
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,299
<i>Go to the bank immediately and...</i>

732
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:20,551
And?

733
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:21,635
Sena.

734
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:24,888
Please go on. I'm sorry.

735
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:31,437
<i>The line is busy.
Please leave a message.</i>

736
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,564
Who is she on the phone with?

737
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:36,859
I wanted to surprise her
by telling her I was going to cook.

738
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:42,531
Oh! What's this?

739
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:45,576
Ah, so this was here.

740
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:47,703
Hana made such a fuss when she lost it.

741
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:52,332
Should I sign her up for shooting lessons?

742
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:56,879
She definitely takes after me.
She loves guns so much.

743
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:06,930
- Hello?
<i>- I'm the head monk of Songun Temple.</i>

744
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:08,640
<i>I read your message.</i>

745
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:10,309
Hello, sir.

746
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:11,977
I actually don't know what to call you.

747
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:15,731
Anyway, I wanted to ask
if the temple has CCTVs.

748
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:17,983
I did see some cameras.

749
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:21,153
I see.

750
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:23,822
Then I'll be right over.

751
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:26,200
Okay. See you soon.

752
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:27,701
Bye.

753
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:33,624
Okay.

754
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:43,717
This kitty is so sweet.

755
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:46,136
It's the friendliest cat I've ever seen.

756
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,555
Don't get too attached though.

757
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:51,683
We're only keeping it for a few days.
Right, kitty?

758
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:53,894
Worry about yourself.

759
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:58,148
<i>A university student was found
dead right in the middle of a trail.</i>

760
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,943
<i>-After much effort,</i>
-What is he saying?

761
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:03,737
<i>The Remaking of Crime team

765
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:15,123
They're revealing the culprit?
