Songwon Police Station
has moved to a temporary location

Is this really the place?

5
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:01,519
It seems so, sir.

6
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,822
Choo Yongjin was involved
in school violence in high school.

7
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,866
The incident was
even reported to the police.

8
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:18,661
By the way, are we really off the case?

9
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:24,459
Yes, for the time being.

10
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,253
Understood.

11
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,672
How can I help you?

12
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:31,257
Who are you?

13
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:32,759
Detectives!

We'd appreciate your cooperation.

18
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:44,646
Let's begin.

19
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:45,855
Yes, sir.

20
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,149
Excuse me.

21
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,484
Please step aside.

22
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,277
Could you make some room?

23
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,446
Out of the way, please.

24
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,657
Please cooperate.

25
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,367
Hand over all the information.

26
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,668
-Step aside, please.
-What if I don't want to?

27
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:09,170
You're risking disciplinary action.

28
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,256
Disciplinary action?

29
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,174
Junghwan, he says
I'll be disciplined.

30
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:14,968
As if that scares me.

31
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,263
If I'd been promoted
every time I was disciplined,

32
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,098
I'd be the commissioner by now!

33
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,475
Just as disrespectful as people say.

34
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,145
What should we do?

35
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:32,152
Detective Moo, please cooperate.

36
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,320
I'm sorry, Captain.

37
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,738
-I'm sorry.
-No problem.

38
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,574
I'll cooperate. Come this way, please.

39
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:38,825
Sure.

40
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,648
-Are you okay?
-Well, yes.

41
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,317
Why can't you guys keep your balance?

42
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,860
I apologize.

43
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:16,863
Collect all the information
related to the case.

44
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,323
Don't leave anything out.

Choo Yongjin

50
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:06,412
He submitted a written apology
under Article 17, Section 1, Clause 1

51
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:09,082
of the Act Against Violence In Schools.

52
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,799
It's your first day off in ages.
Why the gloom?

53
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,842
I'm just upset.

54
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,135
You should be grateful

55
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,845
that you have
one less case to worry about.

56
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:23,972
Why are you upset?

57
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,598
Given you're just a part-timer,

58
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:28,810
it's no surprise that you don't understand
my level of commitment.

59
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,855
Hey, stop buying new clothes
if you're broke.

60
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,440
Your wardrobe is full as it is!

61
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:44,993
Hello, Captain.

62
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,786
Hello, Detective Seo.

63
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:48,663
Can we go somewhere tonight?

64
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:51,207
- Tonight?
<i>- Classic Century Hotel.</i>

65
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,709
I'll meet you there.

66
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:53,960
What--

67
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:56,963
What was that?

68
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,133
Was that the young new captain
you were talking about?

69
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:01,801
Yeah.

70
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,598
Hey, Hyunseo.

71
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,058
Can I borrow that outfit?

72
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,729
It's brand-new. Hell no.

73
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,731
- Let me borrow it.
- No way.

74
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,734
- Please, just this once.
- I don't want to!

75
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:21,070
Oh, just let me borrow it!
I have nothing to wear.

76
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,739
- Please.
- No!

77
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,658
- Please, just this once!
- What's with you?

78
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:26,993
I said no!

79
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,953
What's your problem?

80
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:31,873
Can I borrow it?

81
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,634
Detective Seo, I'm sorry I'm late.

82
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:44,886
There was traffic.

83
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:48,681
Why did you ask me to dress up?

84
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,059
Uh, we're late. Let's go up first.

85
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,685
Hold on. We're going up?

86
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,228
To the hotel? Why?

87
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,731
What do you think
we came all the way here for?

88
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,107
We need to do what we need to do.

89
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,818
- What…
- You were amazing today.

90
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,363
A man needs to do what he needs to do.
Am I right?

91
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:06,824
<i>We need to do what we need to do.</i>

92
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,534
Hmm.

93
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,996
-Shall we go up?
-I can't believe this.

94
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,290
There's no way we're going up there!

95
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,541
What?

96
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,966
Have you lost your mind?

97
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,010
Seorae High School 22nd Class Reunion

98
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,809
I wish you'd told me earlier

99
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,520
that we were here
for Choo Yongjin's high school reunion.

100
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,563
I'm sorry I didn't explain.

101
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,942
Anyway, I didn't know
it was invitation-only.

102
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:43,611
I guess we won't be able to go in.

103
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:48,032
I'll be right back.

104
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,164
I'm sorry.

105
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,424
Huh? Whoa!

106
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,095
You must be
raking in money these days.

107
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,180
Oh, you know.
I'm wearing all designer.

108
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,599
- So fancy.
- From Italy.

109
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:16,477
Uh…

110
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:17,770
Did you all hear about Yongjin?

111
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:20,815
I can't believe what happened.

112
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,733
I was so shocked
when I saw the news.

113
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,611
I know.

114
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,447
I feel so sorry for him.

115
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,658
Tell me about it.
I was looking forward to seeing him.

116
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:36,205
Hey, don't be ridiculous.
Who here actually wants to see him? Ugh.

117
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,292
When I think about
what happened to Changsu, I still--

118
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,418
Changsu?

119
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,547
Are you already drunk?
Why would you bring him up?

120
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,174
What's the deal with you?

121
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,428
By the way,
I don't think I recognize you two.

122
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,222
Which class were you in?

123
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,682
- Class 1.
- Class 2.

124
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,645
- Class 2.
- Class 1.

125
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,443
Weren't both of those boys' classes?

126
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:06,819
Well…

127
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:09,530
Actually…

128
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,951
-You're…
-Me?

129
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,913
Jiyeong. Am I right?

130
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,457
- Yes, I'm Jiyeong.
- Right?

131
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,585
We were both in Class 1 in 11th grade.

132
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,962
- Right, Jiyeong?
- I'm Jiyeong from 11th grade.

133
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,672
Class 1 was a girls' class in 11th grade.

134
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,591
Ah…

135
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,843
- You look amazing.
- You think so?

136
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,221
Did you have some work done?

137
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,390
-Me?
-Did you?

138
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,767
- No way.
- Hey.

139
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,144
Now that I look at you more closely…

140
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,400
I do recognize you.

141
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,277
-<i>All contestants in the dance competition…</i>
-You do?

142
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,696
-<i>…please come on stage.</i>
-Wait, you were in the dance club, right?

143
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,533
-Me?
-There's a talent show.

144
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,743
They're giving out a ton of prizes.
You should enter.

145
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,828
- Uh…
- You should hurry.

146
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,747
-Me?
-Give it a try, Jiyeong.

147
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,332
Everyone's looking forward to it.

148
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:02,875
You used to be our dancing queen.

149
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:05,836
Make sure to win a prize.

150
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,297
Give it a try, Jiyeong.

151
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,633
- Hurry up. Go, Jiyeong!
- Go, Jiyeong!

152
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,093
-I don't think so.
-Go, Jiyeong!

153
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,387
- Go, Jiyeong!
- Stop it.

154
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,806
-Those guys are no match for you.
-I think I'll pass.

155
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,100
- I'm the dancing queen?
- Come on.

156
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:21,602
They may be older now,

157
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:25,815
but these dancers
are still teenagers at heart!

158
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,985
Now, let's get started.

159
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,237
Hit the floor!

160
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,404
Oh no!

161
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,579
That's hilarious.

162
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,331
About Changsu.

163
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,041
What happened
between him and Yongjin?

164
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,419
Uh, did you say you were in Class 1?

165
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,755
-Yes.
-Then maybe you don't know.

166
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:33,424
The thing is…

167
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,593
The Awkward but Awesome Dancer Award
Prize: Massager

168
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,593
The Awkward but Awesome Dancer Award
Prize: Massager

169
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,305
Your dance moves were so unique.

170
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,141
Clumsy but full of potential.

171
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,144
Are you teasing me?

172
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,605
Did you get any leads?

173
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,065
Yes, thanks to you.

174
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,316
Ugh, stop it.

175
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:54,403
I heard the name Changsu mentioned.

176
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,614
The two of them used to be quite close.

177
00:10:57,448 --> 00:11:00,368
Then they fell out
over a minor misunderstanding.

178
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:03,746
After that,
Yongjin harassed Changsu persistently.

179
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,291
Get up, you piece of shit.

180
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,127
Does that hurt? Get it together.

181
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,714
Yongjin.

182
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,633
Please stop.

183
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:21,263
Look, didn't I tell you
not to say my name again?

184
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,599
Yongjin.

185
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,436
Did you not hear what I said?

186
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,274
<i>In the end,
Changsu dropped out of school.</i>

187
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,319
<i>But the bullying didn't stop.</i>

188
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,658
Stop right there!

189
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,368
Stop there, Changsu!

190
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,161
Don't let me catch you!

191
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,263
<i>Changsu got seriously injured
in an accident.</i>

192
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:05,766
After that,
his classmates never heard from him again.

193
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,477
Were they not held responsible
for his injury?

194
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,480
They all tried to sweep it under the rug.

195
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,649
It was also difficult to prove

196
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,402
that his classmates were
directly responsible for the accident.

197
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,822
They were transferred to another school,
and that was it.

198
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,366
Choo Yongjin didn't strike me
as that kind of person.

199
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,579
I guess we'll have to inform
the Special Investigation Team of this.

200
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:29,123
Should I write up a report?

201
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,041
There's no need.

202
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,836
Why not?
We're off the kidnapping case now.

203
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,839
Yes, we are.

204
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:40,718
-Then why not?
-I'm a member of a research group.

205
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:43,637
It's called School Violence Prevention
by Improving the School Police System

206
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,806
through Legislative Measures.

207
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,601
- This will be a good case study.
- Mm.

208
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:51,562
There's a research group like that?

209
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:54,982
You just made that up, didn't you?

210
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,525
What are you talking about?

211
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,695
It really is called
School Violence Prevention

212
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,239
by Improving the School Police System
through Legislative Measures.

213
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,993
How long have you been a member?

214
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,627
Oh! Whoa!

215
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,757
I got you, Nuri!

216
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:23,761
I'm scared!

217
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,140
Jung Doona

218
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:31,185
Choo Yoona

219
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:33,813
Stop running.

220
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,606
The neighbors downstairs
will complain again.

221
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,608
Have they been complaining?

222
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:40,694
Then again, how would you know
what goes on at home?

223
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,071
You're never around.

224
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,657
It's been busy at work.

225
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,201
Why do you always work overtime
for nothing in return?

226
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,287
It's work. What can I do?

227
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:52,706
What are you up to anyway?

228
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,125
I'm writing a script.

229
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,294
A script? What is it for?

230
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:02,466
Remember that video I uploaded on YouTube?

231
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,885
It got more views
than I expected,

232
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,846
so I'm thinking of adding
a voice-over this time.

233
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,265
That sounds like a hassle.

234
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,351
Who cares if it's a hassle?

235
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,895
Every penny counts.

236
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,569
I'll work harder.

237
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,239
What's the point?

238
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,368
Remember my friend Jieun?

239
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,996
The one who works
at the credit card company?

240
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,582
Her husband just got another promotion.

241
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,002
She won't stop bragging
that he's now head of the team.

242
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,087
Any chance you'll get a promotion soon?

243
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:44,425
Promotions are rare in our force.

244
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:46,886
Honey.

245
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:50,556
Didn't you say headquarters
sent a team to your precinct?

246
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,058
How do you know about that?

247
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,311
You get more opportunities
at headquarters, don't you?

248
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,980
We need to find
a daycare center for Sena next year.

249
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,692
Wasn't there a good one at headquarters?

250
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:03,861
There is, but…

251
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,195
Yeah, you're right.

252
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,823
Exactly. You need to make them notice you.

253
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,368
This could be your chance.
Grab it while you can.

254
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:17,499
Buttering people up isn't really my thing.

255
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,668
Do you think this is my thing too?

256
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:24,048
Do you think I'm doing YouTube
because I enjoy it?

257
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:25,758
Ugh.

258
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,429
I don't know why I bother talking to you.
This is going nowhere.

259
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,141
Have you ever seized an opportunity
in your life?

260
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,728
You missed out on the Olympics
at the last minute too.

261
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:38,896
Hey, Nam Youngeun.

262
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,273
Let's just drop it.

263
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,691
Drop what?

264
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:44,902
Did I say something wrong?

265
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:50,950
You blame me and Hana
for not making it to the Olympics.

266
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:56,914
Did you think I didn't know?

267
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:53,447
Songwon Police Station
has moved to a temporary location

268
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,034
Hey.

269
00:17:57,117 --> 00:18:00,037
Oh, actually, can I ask you a question?

270
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:01,914
You can ask two if you want.

271
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,750
It's nothing important,
but I'm looking for a place

272
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,460
that serves good hangover soup.

273
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,379
- Hangover soup?
- We don't do hangover soup.

274
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,673
-You don't? That's unexpected.
-Never touched it.

275
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,968
I see. All right, never mind then.

276
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,933
Why did you do that?
He's a big shot at headquarters.

277
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:24,228
Hey, that doesn't mean
he can be an asshole.

278
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:27,981
Be careful.

279
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,692
If you so much as talk to them,
you're a traitor.

280
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,570
What are you talking about?
Why would I talk to them?

281
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,365
- Come on.
- I'm warning you.

282
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,661
As you know, I'm in a tight spot,
and I was wondering if you could…

283
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,412
You can't?

284
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,374
Is there really no way?

285
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,210
All right.

286
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,419
No, don't apologize.

287
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,547
Hmm?

288
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,007
What do you mean?

289
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,844
<i>Someone asked me
about Changsu at the reunion,</i>

290
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,804
<i>and it's been bothering me.</i>

291
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,180
Changsu?

292
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:05,352
I don't know what happened to him either.

293
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,271
We graduated soon after.

294
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:12,442
Anyway, thanks for your time. Bye.

295
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,577
I think
Changsu told on us to the teacher.

296
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,414
No one else knows about the fight.

297
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,918
- I know you're close with him, but--
- It's not him.

298
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,213
Let me tell you something.

299
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,424
Remember the guy from Sangil High
that we beat up?

300
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,384
His sister is dating Changsu--

301
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:38,468
Damn it.

302
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,470
I said it's not him.

303
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,141
No, I never hang out with those guys.

304
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:48,145
I even told the teachers
about them beating up your brother.

305
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:49,855
All right.

306
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:30,687
Who did this?

307
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,523
Damn it! That bastard!

308
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,529
The kidnapper
sent another message

309
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,114
via courier this time.

310
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,867
I thought you'd like to know.

311
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,828
They used a courier?

312
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,331
-What's wrong?
-Hmm…

313
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:53,418
They changed their way
of sending messages.

314
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:56,463
If you want to save your daughter,
pay double the ransom

315
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,436
Choo Yoona Kidnapping Case

316
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,521
His name is Yoon Seohun.

317
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,690
He has four assault charges on his record.

318
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:18,026
He's been pulling bait-and-switch scams
for the past two years,

319
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,279
stirring up all kinds of trouble.

320
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:24,992
After Choo Yongjin exposed his schemes
in detail on his YouTube channel,

321
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:27,494
he got kicked out
of the used car market for good.

322
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:30,163
It seems like he was already questioned.

323
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:34,001
Yes, the Violent Crimes Team
has questioned him twice.

324
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:35,210
Where is he now?

325
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:38,338
He disappeared without a trace
after the last questioning.

326
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:40,882
Track him down
and bring him in.

327
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,009
Yes, sir!

328
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,182
What is it?

329
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,434
What are you doing here?

330
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:55,147
I'm Sergeant Jung Junghwan
from Violent Crimes Team 2.

331
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:56,523
And?

332
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:59,985
You were looking for
a hangover soup place earlier.

333
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,279
Lee Bokja Hangover Soup

334
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:03,363
Hangover soup?

335
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:06,575
This is from the most popular
spot in the neighborhood.

336
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:09,828
Ms. Lee Bokja with 40 years of experience.
Ever heard of her?

337
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,040
You haven't? She's pretty famous.

338
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:15,917
-Do I need to know about her?
-Of course not.

339
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:18,837
But she's been making
hangover soup for 40 years,

340
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,923
in the same pot, no less.

341
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:26,011
I bet it's the most refreshing
hangover soup in the country.

342
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:32,434
-What was the name again?
-It's Ms. Lee Bokja.

343
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,643
I mean your name.

344
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:37,356
I drove for an hour

345
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:40,901
to get you this soup,
and I'm Sergeant Jung Junghwan.

346
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,111
Salute.

347
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:45,822
All right.

348
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,783
-I hope you enjoy it.
-Thanks.

349
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,036
What were you doing in there?

350
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,622
Me? Nothing. I didn't do anything.

351
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,957
What do you mean?
I just saw you come out of there.

352
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:59,753
I realized it was the wrong room
and came out right away.

353
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,380
Actually, I didn't come out

354
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:02,547
because I didn't even go in.

355
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:03,632
I was about to, but then--

356
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,009
Whatever.
Captain wants to see us.

357
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:10,013
Meeting Room

358
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,268
Oh…

359
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:18,480
So Lee Changsu dropped out of school
and got injured

360
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,565
because of Choo Yongjin?

361
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,692
It's not like he ran him over,

362
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,986
but he's partly to blame.

363
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,072
Is he chasing down con artists
to make up for it?

364
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:28,698
As an act of remorse?

365
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,325
Is there really a connection there?

366
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,618
I doubt it.

367
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:35,497
But what's that smell?

368
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,419
What are you doing?

369
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:43,046
You smell like hangover soup.

370
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,256
Huh?

371
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:47,342
- Uh…
- Let me see.

372
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:48,969
- I smell broth.
- Stop it.

373
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:50,095
Come on.

374
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,806
You smell like
Ms. Lee Bokja's hangover soup.

375
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:55,934
I haven't even been
near her restaurant today.

376
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:58,979
Ah, I knew it.

377
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,399
I did think there was
a hint of green onions in the air.

378
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:04,734
-No…
-Detective Jang, you have a good nose.

379
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,445
People say I have the nose of a dog.

380
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:10,365
The nose of a dog?
You're being ridiculous.

381
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:13,869
Anyway, the Special Investigation Team
has singled out a suspect.

382
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,455
- Which one?
- Yoon Seohun.

383
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:19,583
He disappeared
after we questioned him.

384
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,334
You mean the color-blind one?

385
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:24,171
He can't be the one who sent that letter.

386
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:27,007
Like Captain said,
he's severely color-blind.

387
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:30,260
Color-blind or not,
I got a bad vibe from him.

388
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:34,556
Let's track down Lee Changsu first.

389
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:39,811
We've been taken off the case.
Can we still continue investigating?

390
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:42,355
It worries me too, sir.

391
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,774
One more disciplinary action,
and I'm out.

392
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:48,904
Don't worry.

393
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,281
I'll take full responsibility.

394
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,701
Report directly to me.

395
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,122
I'm a punch king!

396
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,082
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

397
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,752
Come on!

398
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:07,214
You lose!

399
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,007
You lose!

400
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:11,051
That was really harsh.

401
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,512
Look into Yoon Seohun's call history

402
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,305
and request backup from headquarters.

403
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,390
We need to find him today.

404
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,352
Okay.

405
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:23,188
- Hey, you.
- Huh?

406
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:24,481
Detective Jang, right?

407
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:27,067
I'm Detective Jung, not Jang.

408
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,985
Jung as in <i>The Jungle Book.</i>

409
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,820
Right, Detective Jung.

410
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:33,073
I really enjoyed the soup.

411
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:34,824
I can see why it's popular.

412
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:37,702
Of course.
40 years of experience doesn't lie.

413
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,497
Thanks again.

414
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:41,998
Sir.

415
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:43,833
Hmm?

416
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,670
It's about Yoon Seohun.

417
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:48,922
What about him?

418
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:53,301
He turns out to be…

419
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,266
such a lowlife.

420
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,185
Anyway, I'm glad you liked the soup.

421
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:04,896
- Is that it?
- Yes.

422
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,273
That was anticlimactic.

423
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:10,443
Let me know if you find anything
that can help with the investigation.

424
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:12,028
Yes, sir.

425
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:25,709
Songwon Police Station
has moved to a temporary location

426
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:25,709
Songwon Police Station
has moved to a temporary location

427
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:31,047
The Concept and Analysis
of Color Blindness

428
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:10,253
Special Investigation Team

429
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:20,096
Hmm?

430
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,848
- Donggoo?
- Mister?

431
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:22,974
What are you doing here?

432
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:25,226
I heard there were new detectives.

433
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,938
But this room's super boring.

434
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:43,912
Tell me what's bothering you.

435
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,039
They say two hands are better than one.

436
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:48,166
I'll give you a hand.

437
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:52,212
It's "heads," not "hands."

438
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,547
Never mind.

439
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,635
-Donggoo.
-Yes?

440
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:04,224
Let's say you want a compliment
from your teacher.

441
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:05,308
Okay.

442
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:08,186
But to get a compliment,

443
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:11,231
you have to betray your friends.

444
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:14,359
What would you do?

445
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:15,860
What kind of compliment?

446
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,155
It's just a figure of speech,
so it doesn't matter.

447
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,782
What do you mean by "betray"?

448
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:26,371
Again, it's just a figure of speech,
so it doesn't matter.

449
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:28,915
Mister.

450
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:34,212
I've decided to look up to you.

451
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,299
Me? You look up to me?

452
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,301
So please don't disappoint me.

453
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:42,846
By turning your back
on your friends,

454
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,389
you're not just betraying them.

455
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:46,891
You're also betraying yourself
and even me.

456
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:47,976
Got it?

457
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:10,123
Captain, Lee Changsu isn't the kidnapper.

458
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:12,083
He died three years ago.

459
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:16,296
-Does he have any family?
-He has an older sister named Lee Mijeong.

460
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:20,133
We're at Ms. Lee Mijeong's place
right now, sir.

461
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:24,304
The landlord says
she's been away for a long time.

462
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,181
Yes.

463
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,975
Other than that,
she used to work at a nearby restaurant,

464
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:31,853
so we'll drop by on our way back.

465
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:36,232
Hey, Tansik. It's me.

466
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,610
Can you look up some pills for me?
I'll give you the names.

467
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:41,863
I'm not talking about illegal drugs.
These are prescribed pills.

468
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:46,159
Mijeong was kind-hearted and hardworking.

469
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:49,078
She sacrificed her entire youth
for her little brother.

470
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:51,289
It seems like she was on medication.

471
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:55,835
She struggled a lot
after her brother's death.

472
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,337
She couldn't do anything,

473
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,421
and she even started hallucinating.

474
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:01,758
I heard she was hospitalized
for a few months.

475
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:03,676
When she started feeling better,

476
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,762
I told her to come back to work.

477
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:07,555
When did she quit?

478
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:12,143
Was it three months ago?

479
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:16,981
She said she was unwell.
That was the last I heard from her.

480
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:18,149
Ma'am.

481
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:21,611
How long do those cameras
store the footage for?

482
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:23,571
For three months, I think.

483
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,658
Oh, it's a hassle to check it though.

484
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,660
You have to call someone in
and everything.

485
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,204
Too bad.

486
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:35,416
I still want to see it.

487
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,462
Very badly.

488
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:47,804
Ma'am?

489
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,808
Lee Changsu fell into a coma

490
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:54,894
after the car accident in high school.

491
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:57,564
And Lee Mijeong
was the one who took care of him.

492
00:30:58,147 --> 00:30:59,816
The hospital confirmed

493
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:02,110
that he passed away three years ago.

494
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:05,446
After his death, Lee Mijeong
suffered from anxiety, depression,

495
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:09,158
panic attacks, and hallucinations
and was hospitalized for a while.

496
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:11,953
She doesn't seem suspicious.
Everyone says she was nice.

497
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,998
Yes, she does have a good reputation.

498
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:17,792
Also, she hasn't been prescribed
any pills in a year.

499
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:20,003
Um…

500
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:22,589
Did you check the CCTV footage
from the restaurant?

501
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:25,008
Uh,
the owner refused to cooperate,

502
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:27,260
but I'll ask her again.

503
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:29,012
I'm sure she'll bring it.

504
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,390
What makes you so confident?

505
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:34,225
And why would you
flirt with her like that?

506
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:38,730
Someone is here
to see Detective Moo.

507
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:45,862
Ta-da.

508
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,117
Oh my.

509
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:52,744
-Hello.
-Hello.

510
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:53,953
Uh…

511
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,246
Why are you so beautiful?

512
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,748
Oh!

513
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:00,752
Would you like a cup of tea?

514
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,846
She looks nothing like the kidnapper.

515
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:14,515
They're built differently too.

516
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,100
- I know.
- It's not her.

517
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,520
They might be the same person.

518
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,648
What?

519
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:23,524
That's just unreasonable.

520
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,193
They look completely different.

521
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,236
They have nothing in common.

522
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,655
They have the same gait.

523
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:31,866
The same gait?
Might as well say they have the same feet.

524
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,201
Stop being unreasonable!

525
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,621
The face isn't the only way
to identify someone.

526
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:38,247
Send the footage to the KCSI

527
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:40,291
and have their gaits analyzed immediately.

528
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,751
Yes, sir.

529
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:44,212
Who's living
at Lee Mijeong's parents' place?

530
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:45,964
Her parents passed away.

531
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:49,133
Uh, it's going to be redeveloped,
so it's vacant now.

532
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:55,056
There's a 60% chance
they're the same person.

533
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:59,727
Their stride
and spine curvature are quite similar.

534
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,855
Also, they both walk
with their toes inward

535
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:05,233
and are bow-legged.

536
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,735
All in all, their walking styles
are pretty alike.

537
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,697
Is this about the kidnapping case?
Then you don't need it.

538
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,781
Sorry?

539
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:13,908
They found prints.

540
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:17,787
There were some partial prints
on the ransom note.

541
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:19,998
Have they been identified?

542
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,417
They belong to a bait-and-switch dealer.
His name is…

543
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:24,544
What was his name? Oh…

544
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:29,590
Yoon Seohun.
I heard he was a prime suspect.

545
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,555
Hello, Dongbang Yubin speaking.

546
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:38,099
<i>Captain Dongbang,
did you hear what happened?</i>

547
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,727
<i>We're moving out to arrest the suspect,</i>

548
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,854
<i>and we need your team to back us up.</i>

549
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,273
Sure, consider it done.

550
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,169
We're moving in.

551
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:08,546
-Get the kid out first.
-They're moving in.

552
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:10,631
-<i>Watch the escape routes.
</i>-Yes, sir.

553
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:13,426
Yes, sir.

554
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,801
Hello?

555
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:01,432
I'm from the maintenance office.
We need to come in for disinfection.

556
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,108
Hello?

557
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:24,997
I didn't get any notice
about disinfection.

558
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:28,835
Uh, the request came
from the redevelopment contractor.

559
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,419
If you refuse to cooperate,

560
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:33,089
you may face immediate eviction.

561
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:40,388
It won't take long.

562
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,224
Please hurry up.

563
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:46,769
Okay.
Thank you for your cooperation.

564
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:52,525
Oh.

565
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,244
Where's the bathroom?

566
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:04,662
There it is.

567
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,183
Let's see here.

568
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,329
You kidnapped Yoona--

569
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:47,455
Ah!

570
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:51,751
You have a right
to an attorney--

571
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,004
You have the right to remain--

572
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,009
It's all over.

573
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:01,219
Hold on.

574
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:03,512
My head hurts.

575
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:25,201
<i>How's it going, Junghwan? Are you inside?</i>

576
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:28,913
<i>Junghwan!</i>

577
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,132
It wasn't me, I swear!

578
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,592
Stay still!

579
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,469
The kid isn't here.

580
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:46,013
He says all he did
was send the ransom note.

581
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,224
He wanted to give
Choo Yongjin a hard time.

582
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:51,727
Ugh, what the hell is going on?

583
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:52,812
Jeez.

584
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,157
How's it going?

585
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:08,577
I'm going in now. I'll keep you posted.

586
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:14,500
Junghwan. Junghwan.

587
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:16,335
Hey, Junghwan!

588
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,212
Junghwan! Wake up, Junghwan!

589
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,630
What happened?

590
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,716
- What?
- Are you okay?

591
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,843
I'm okay, Joongryeok!

592
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:26,512
Go get the kid! They went that way!

593
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:28,931
Get the kid first! It's that way!

594
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:31,434
Go! Hurry up!

595
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:33,519
Pull it together.

596
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,356
Get the kid first!

597
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,152
We need to save the kid.

598
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:44,739
We need to save her.

599
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,042
Yoona, are you okay?

600
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,877
Ms. Lee Mijeong, you can't do this.

601
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,754
You're putting the kid in danger!

602
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:00,880
Ms. Lee!

603
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,139
Hey! Wait!

604
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:12,224
Give me the kid! Give me the kid!

605
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:13,476
-Ah!
-The kid!

606
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:34,246
Why isn't the car moving?

607
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:43,839
Move! Get out of the way!

608
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:45,591
No way!

609
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:49,303
No!

610
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,356
Joongryeok!

611
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:02,316
Junghwan! Junghwan!

612
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:11,742
Joongryeok!

613
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,829
Junghwan, go get the kid! Quick!

614
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:15,913
-Okay.
-Hurry!

615
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,463
Hey! Hey!

616
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:38,727
<i>Jung Junghwan
lines up his final shot.</i>

617
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:58,873
<i>Sharpshooter Jung Junghwan!</i>

618
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:02,376
We love you, Jung Junghwan!

619
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,713
Sharpshooter Jung Junghwan!

620
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:08,674
<i>We love you, Jung Junghwan!</i>

621
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:10,468
Let's grab a meal sometime

622
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:12,344
<i>Sharpshooter Jung Junghwan!</i>

623
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:15,556
<i>We love you, Jung Junghwan!</i>

624
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:19,018
<i>Sharpshooter Jung Junghwan!</i>

625
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,298
I love you, Daddy.

626
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,260
I love you, Daddy.

627
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:57,056
I love you, Daddy.

628
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:59,058
I love you, Daddy.

629
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,271
I love you, honey.

630
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:00,202
Junghwan, get the kid!

631
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:02,621
Yoona.

632
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:05,541
Lee Mijeong.

633
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:07,751
It's okay.

634
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,087
You must've been scared.

635
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:13,340
I'll take you to your mommy.

636
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,719
It's okay.

637
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,544
I saw that bastard, Yongjin.

638
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,255
Welcome.

639
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:01,930
<i>I recognized him right away.</i>

640
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:07,728
My little brother…

641
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:14,401
was unconscious in the hospital
for 13 years…

642
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:19,865
until he passed away.

643
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,118
My parents…

644
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:26,622
also passed away…

645
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:29,750
from shock after the accident.

646
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,254
My whole life…

647
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:38,550
Everything was ruined.

648
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:46,850
But that bastard Yongjin…

649
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:51,689
seemed so happy.

650
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:56,902
Choo Yongjin

651
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,114
<i>It was so unfair.</i>

652
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:06,120
My entire family died
without doing anything wrong.

653
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:12,126
How could the guy
who harassed my little brother…

654
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,004
live so happily?

655
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:20,592
Is that why you kidnapped Yoona?

656
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:33,647
He needed to know what it was like
to lose a family member.

657
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:41,321
Swoosh! Yay!

658
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,365
What should we go on next?

659
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,409
Want to go on the swings?

660
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:55,377
There you go.

661
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,798
Watch your step. This way.

662
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:02,426
There you go.

663
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:09,391
Hello.

664
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:11,852
- Time to go home.
- Yoona!

665
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:17,608
Let's go.

666
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:19,610
10:10 Grad school class
14:50 Arrives at back gate

667
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:37,628
Is that when you started
planning the crime?

668
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:42,758
There was nothing I wouldn't do
to take revenge for my brother.

669
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:51,767
Our Kindergarten

670
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:54,978
Let's get out, guys.

671
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,480
Time to go home, Yoona.

672
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:02,152
- Take your time. Get out one by one.
- Hi, sweetie.

673
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:04,279
There you go. Watch your step.

674
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:05,948
Haeun!

675
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:08,700
- Mommy!
- Watch your step.

676
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,041
Mommy's over there.

677
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:21,046
My original plan…

678
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:24,591
was to die with Yoona.

679
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:30,138
<i>But once she was with me,</i>

680
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:34,142
<i>I couldn't go through with it.</i>

681
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:46,029
The kid's innocent, after all.

682
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,140
Do you like the teddy bear, Yoona?

683
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,601
Hi, friends.

684
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:19,271
Yoona!

685
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:20,731
Yoona!

686
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:23,692
Yoona!

687
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:28,322
Why are you crying, Mommy? Stop crying.

688
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:29,489
Look at me, Yoona.

689
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,033
Are you okay?

690
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:32,951
She's okay.

691
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:34,369
Let's go home.

692
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:36,872
Thank you. Thank you so much.

693
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:38,749
Thank you.

694
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:41,376
I'm so sorry, Yoona.

695
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:45,255
I'm sorry, Yoona.

696
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:48,091
Everything's okay now.

697
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:55,182
You had curry with Mommy?

698
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:56,892
<i>Yes, it was good.</i>

699
00:48:57,559 --> 00:48:59,311
<i>Daddy,
is there a bump on your head?</i>

700
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:00,938
Oh, you can see it?

701
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:03,440
Isn't it cute?

702
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:05,609
<i>Did you bump into something?</i>

703
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:08,695
Yes, while busting the bad guys.

704
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:11,448
Hurry home so we can blow on it.

705
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:17,079
Daddy's sorry.

706
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:18,413
<i>For what?</i>

707
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:23,502
Just because.

708
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:25,671
- <i>Okay.</i>
<i>- Got it.</i>

709
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:27,839
<i>Okay, honey. Hang in there.</i>

710
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,716
Good night.

711
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,844
<i>We love you, Daddy!</i>

712
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:52,197
Ma'am.

713
00:49:57,744 --> 00:49:59,121
Take this.

714
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:15,387
Detectives Moo and Jang,
please take her away.

715
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:27,190
Stay back.

716
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:30,235
I have something to tell her.

717
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:32,362
I just need a second.

718
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:01,892
Mijeong.

719
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,311
I'm very sorry.

720
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:10,984
I'm really sorry.

721
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:14,946
I shouldn't have done that…

722
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:18,492
…to Changsu.

723
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:21,578
Changsu…

724
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:26,416
didn't deserve it.

725
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:06,915
I'm sorry for all the trouble
we caused you.

726
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:13,380
You're welcome
to cause trouble here anytime.

727
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,926
All right. We'll get going.

728
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:21,471
Keep your balance.

729
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:23,140
And load this up in the car in advance.

730
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:24,432
I'm sorry, sir.

731
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:32,941
Yes!

732
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:41,283
Detective Jung.

733
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:44,661
Yes?

734
00:52:57,048 --> 00:52:58,175
What's this?

735
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,719
It's from Jung Junghwan, Jang Junghwan,
or whatever his name is,

736
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:02,637
from the Violent Crimes Team.

737
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:03,722
Jang Janghwan?

738
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:05,974
Who's that?

739
00:53:06,057 --> 00:53:08,101
Or was his name Wang Joongwang?

740
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:10,145
Anyway, he said you'd know who he is.

741
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:12,939
Okay. What's this here?

742
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:14,399
Black Bean Gift Set

743
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,404
<i>Dear Mr. Choi Hyeonseong.</i>

744
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:25,368
<i>It's been an honor serving you,</i>

745
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:28,455
<i>even if it was brief.</i>

746
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:32,584
<i>I've learned invaluable lessons</i>

747
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:34,961
<i>while serving you.</i>

748
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:39,257
<i>If I get the chance to work with you
at headquarters,</i>

749
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:42,177
<i>I promise to stick by your side</i>

750
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:47,349
<i>and have your back.</i>

751
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:51,394
<i>Until you become commissioner,</i>

752
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:55,440
<i>stay healthy with a full head of hair</i>

753
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:57,275
<i>and be happy.</i>

754
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,361
<i>Hair!</i>

755
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:01,696
<i>That came out wrong.</i>

756
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,116
<i>Hail!</i>

757
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,119
<i>From Jung Junghwan,
the sharpshooter of Violent Crimes Team 2.</i>

758
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:10,789
Is this bastard teasing me?

759
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:14,542
Then I'll throw this away, sir.

760
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:16,503
No, wait.

761
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:20,131
I'm getting a lot of gray hair these days.

762
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:21,841
- Are you losing hair?
- No.

763
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:40,110
Seoul Busters

764
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:41,778
<i>Next time on</i> Seoul Busters.

765
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:44,614
<i>A horrific murder takes place.</i>

766
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:46,533
<i>The victim is Mr. Yoon Haesik.</i>

767
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:48,868
- What's up with Detective Jang?
<i>- He knew the victim.</i>

768
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:52,747
I'll catch the killer with my own hands.

769
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:56,543
<i>Tansik is determined
to catch the killer.</i>

770
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:58,670
<i>There was a fight
right before the incident?</i>

771
00:54:58,753 --> 00:55:00,588
<i>Meanwhile,
the Violent Crimes Team</i>

772
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:01,840
<i>goes into a club undercover.</i>

773
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:03,049
Hold on!

774
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:04,551
You want to bow to me, don't you?

775
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,886
<i>They start looking for leads.</i>

776
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:08,638
I got you dead to rights.

777
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:11,308
<i>But the investigation
hits a brick wall.</i>

778
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:13,601
- Whoa!
<i>- Looks like we got a flat tire.</i>

779
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:16,104
<i>The team is back at square one.</i>

780
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:18,857
<i>You should give it a try,
Detective Jang.</i>

781
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:20,400
<i>Give it a try.</i>

782
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:23,278
<i>Will the Violent Crimes Team
be able to catch the killer?</i>

783
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:26,781
To be continued…
