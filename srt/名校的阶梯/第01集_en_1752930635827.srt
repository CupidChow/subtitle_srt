HIERARCHY

2
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,650
You're crazy.
Everyone here is crazy.

3
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,110
You're crazy.

4
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,150
You're all crazy!

5
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,860
I'm going to expose it all!

6
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,500
You're all crazy!

7
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:10,790
The teachers, the students,

8
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,960
the entire school
are all completely deranged!

9
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,970
I don't care! I have to--

10
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:19,390
I'm… I'm gonna expose everything
that's going on here!

11
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:50,750
EPISODE 1
NEWBIE PARTY: TRUTH OR DARE

12
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,480
The problem can
easily be solved once you graph

13
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,150
the absolute value of x…

14
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,910
The answer…

15
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,580
"I saw thee weep

16
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,620
The big bright tear

17
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:31,290
Came o'er that eye of blue

18
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,460
And then methought it did appear…"

19
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,330
FIRST SEMESTER OPENING CEREMONY

20
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:22,930
A new semester has begun
at the most prestigious school in Korea,

21
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:27,970
Jooshin High, where we take pride
in our time-honored traditions.

22
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,730
In the spirit of those traditions,

23
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:38,820
we're putting Jooshin's motto,
"noblesse oblige," into practice.

24
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,570
To celebrate this new semester,

25
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,860
let's welcome
our new scholarship recipient,

26
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,990
who was hand selected…

27
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,910
out of quite a few applicants.

28
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,620
Kang Ha. Come.

29
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:56,630
Yes, ma'am.

30
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:06,010
Scholarship students never last here.
Why admit them anymore?

31
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,510
Because they wanna give
the poor kids a chance too.

32
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,520
"Noblesse oblige," you know?
They can't forget that.

33
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,230
-Who? The principal?
-Check, check.

34
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,600
No, the school owners.

35
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:16,850
Ri-an's mom and dad.

36
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,560
Good morning,

37
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:22,150
students, seniors, and underclassmen.

38
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,200
My name is Kang Ha.

39
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,870
As the first to ace
the Jooshin High scholarship…

40
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,130
Hey.

41
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,100
As the first student to ace the test…

42
00:04:58,730 --> 00:04:59,940
Check.

43
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,700
-Finally.
-You're late.

44
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,660
Please continue.

45
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,040
Uh, ah. Oh, it's working.

46
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,410
So, uh, where was I?

47
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,460
Um, the exam! Right.

48
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,750
I got the highest grade.

49
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:21,460
-He has such a cute smile.
-How I got here doesn't matter…

50
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,460
He's got this puppy dog energy, right?

51
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,880
…today transferring
to Korea's best private school…

52
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,510
…Jooshin High.

53
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:30,390
To honor that reputation,
I intend to focus on my studies

54
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:33,770
and keep getting good grades
so I can live up to your school's legacy.

55
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,730
I look forward to the year ahead.

56
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,940
JUST TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON

57
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:46,490
ANSWER THE PHONE, JAE-I
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

58
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,240
That concludes
our opening ceremonies.

59
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:55,870
Now, students, I'll ask you to begin
making your way to your classes, please.

60
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,500
-Whoa. Sit down.
-What? What?

61
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,580
Just sit down.

62
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,130
What's wrong?

63
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,050
That crazy fucking dumbass.

64
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,770
What've you been up to?
I was messaging Ye-ji the whole time.

65
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:22,940
Excuse me.

66
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:26,480
Hello. I was just up there.
I'm the new student.

67
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,320
I have English first period,
but I don't know where I'm going.

68
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,450
Could you help me?

69
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:32,320
You're too happy.

70
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,540
You need time to get to know your place.

71
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,490
Hmm?

72
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:39,460
Get to know my what?
You're leaving? Uh, all right.

73
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,590
You lost? They'll show you where to go.

74
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,090
Gimme your number.

75
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,930
What? For…

76
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,470
Well, I didn't expect that.

77
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,640
I figured you might want
someone to help you out.

78
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,180
Like, if you have any questions.

79
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,270
Ah. Right.

80
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,440
Thank you.

81
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,610
-What's your handle?
-We'll follow you back.

82
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,230
-I'm not on anything.
-No social media?

83
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,190
Mm-mm.

84
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,910
There you go.
I should get going. See you, guys.

85
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,240
Wow.

86
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,540
He is such a weirdo.

87
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,790
Wow.

88
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,630
What is this?

89
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,050
Yeah, not there.

90
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,270
Oh, hello.

91
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:44,600
The scholarship student?
You're not allowed in here.

92
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,360
This is English, isn't it?

93
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,400
At the end of the hall. Standard A.

94
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,690
This is Special A.

95
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,360
Ah, so not here.

96
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:56,240
-Hi.
-Fuckin' scholarship kid.

97
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,580
Why's he in here?

98
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,920
I'm so excited.
I can't wait to get tickets.

99
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,470
That's my seat.

100
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,470
Ah, okay.

101
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,350
Uh, sorry.

102
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,310
That's my friend's seat.

103
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,310
Oh, is it?

104
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,870
No bag hook?

105
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,740
Shaved off 1.25 seconds.

106
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,870
Ri-an, how about we grab lunch?

107
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,170
Any classes left?

108
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:35,010
I'm all done. You have one more, right?

109
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,260
At 4:00. Social studies.

110
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,850
Woo-jin's so weird lately.
He dating anyone?

111
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,150
And Jae-i? Still ghosting you?

112
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:14,380
If you two haven't made up
with each other,

113
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,630
then maybe I

114
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:21,640
should make a play for her king
while the queen is away.

115
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,850
How do I get that checkmate?

116
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,180
I worked out the whole break.

117
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:32,400
Take a good look. Did my work pay off?

118
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,860
I don't even need to look.

119
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:41,360
I'm well aware you've got a body
models would kill for.

120
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:43,240
So

121
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,660
stop messing around.

122
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,580
I wasn't though.

123
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,080
You didn't have to be
so direct about it. Damn.

124
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,590
Where you going?

125
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,920
I have plans.

126
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,590
Not fleeing from humiliation.

127
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,660
Jae-i!

128
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,220
What'd you do for three months
in America all alone?

129
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,970
I have cousins in Irvine,
so I had stuff to do.

130
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,730
Wow. I'm still pretty hurt.

131
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:56,650
Always sent me straight to voicemail.
I mean, you can do that to me and Woo-jin.

132
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,900
But don't tell me
you also did that to Ri-an?

133
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,410
Of course. I knew it. Something was up.
Now I know why he's been so moody lately.

134
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,320
You fight or something? What's wrong?

135
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:10,580
I mean, even if you did,
you'll always be inseparable.

136
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,660
How could you ghost him for that long?

137
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,830
I have something to say to everyone.

138
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,750
What is it?

139
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:19,250
I have plans in the morning, but let's do
Sunday afternoon at the track.

140
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,210
The racecourse?

141
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,510
Why there? And why does
she want me to assemble the troops?

142
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,440
Assemblyman Lee.
Over here. Let's take a group photo.

143
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,690
Say "kimchi."

144
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,440
-Kimchi!
-One, two, three.

145
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,450
-Kimchi!
-All right, we got it.

146
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,950
-Give yourselves a round of applause.
-Well done.

147
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:50,280
Bye.

148
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,830
Attention, everyone.
Are you all free Sunday afternoon?

149
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,620
It's been a while. Let's hang out.

150
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:57,790
Thank you!

151
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:02,800
Jooshin Electronics'
cell phone sales have been on the rise.

152
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,470
Especially in Barcelona.

153
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,050
I read that this morning.

154
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,760
What about France?

155
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,220
Jooshin bakery brand
will be launched--

156
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:12,220
Just a moment.

157
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,770
Our Jung Jae-i
has finally come back to us.

158
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,560
Let's meet at the track Sunday.
Don't be late, all right?

159
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,580
And this one?
What do you think?

160
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,250
It complements your complexion.

161
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,210
This one here.

162
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,220
OUR JUNG JAE-I HAS FINALLY COME BACK TO US
LET'S MEET AT THE TRACK SUNDAY

163
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:57,430
I certainly hope
the food is to your liking.

164
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,650
I don't often indulge
in such luxuries.

165
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,190
You spoil me, truly.

166
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,610
Sharing a beautiful meal
in a beautiful garden

167
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,650
and with you, above all people,
Chairman Jung.

168
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:06,780
Thank you.

169
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:10,200
Assemblyman Lee has mentioned
organizing a lunch several times,

170
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,780
but I was busy,
so I hope it was worth the wait.

171
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:15,910
Pardon me, but may I say
you have a beautiful daughter?

172
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,500
I bet she takes after her mother.

173
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:21,750
Oh, do you think so?

174
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:25,000
I appreciate it, but I think Jae-i is…

175
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,340
far, far prettier.

176
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,390
Blessed with both looks
and brains and excels in school.

177
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,140
You must be so proud.

178
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,980
Woo-jin told me that Jae-i is
at the top of her class at Jooshin High.

179
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,400
Well, we've been pretty lucky.

180
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,190
The children study hard
without us having to push them, really.

181
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:46,400
We're proud of our Jae-hyeok as well.

182
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,650
Graduated from Hanguk Middle,
top of his class last year.

183
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,410
I'm just glad to have graduated.

184
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:54,370
You graduated
from Hanguk Middle School?

185
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,740
That's my alma mater!

186
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:58,750
I didn't expect to meet
a fellow alumnus here. Wow!

187
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,840
Jae-i?

188
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,140
Are you not feeling well?

189
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:16,350
I noticed you weren't really eating much.

190
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,930
I'm fine, thank you.

191
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,440
Well, we'll be heading upstairs for tea.
Come up when you're ready.

192
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,310
All right. Be right up.

193
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,190
That outfit…

194
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,280
Did you pick out that dress?

195
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,910
You should go and get changed.

196
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:40,660
I just don't think it suits
an occasion like today's.

197
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,830
People are judging us
on the tiniest details.

198
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,580
Your style.
How tasteful your clothes are. Everything.

199
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:50,300
Try dressing more modestly, classier.
A bit, uh, a bit more like your mother.

200
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,970
And which mother are you referring to?

201
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,140
-Stepmother?
-We're not doing this again!

202
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,940
I mean my wife, and you know that.

203
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,730
The woman you were raised by.

204
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:08,110
Not the one who gave birth to you.

205
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,320
Anyway, I think you'd better
go change that outfit.

206
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,370
I'll go get changed.

207
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,330
And while we're at it…

208
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,420
you need to put on
a different shade of lipstick.

209
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,340
Look at that. The color, it's…

210
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,590
it's vulgar.

211
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,350
Just exactly like your birth mother.

212
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,350
You are my firstborn.

213
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,100
I hope you will start behaving

214
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,860
more like my child

215
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,610
and heir to the Jaeyul Group.

216
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,700
I'll see you upstairs.

217
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,180
JOOSHIN HIGH RECEIVES
MORE APPLICANTS IN 2024

218
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,840
I'm just, um,

219
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,170
working part-time.

220
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,300
A gig, playing piano.

221
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,680
I… was taking a short break,
but it's over now.

222
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,190
Gotta get back.

223
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,820
Do you need this? To wipe off your…

224
00:18:58,690 --> 00:18:59,820
Yeah, no.

225
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,530
You can give me your shirt.

226
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,620
-What?
-Your shirt.

227
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,370
I need to borrow one.

228
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,120
My shirt?

229
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,750
I have to be somewhere,
but I can't go looking like this.

230
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:16,170
Oh. Right. Right.

231
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:21,130
It's just-- I couldn't just walk around
without a shirt on, you know?

232
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:24,340
Okay, wait.

233
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,360
Looks like…

234
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,820
you need this more than I do.

235
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,000
Jeez, it's cold.

236
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,110
Don't they get freaked out?
Why do they do this?

237
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,150
I don't get it either.

238
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,150
For the thrill. To feel alive.

239
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:27,780
Hey, Jae-i!

240
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,620
It's been forever.

241
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:34,370
-I really missed you.
-How are you?

242
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,130
Your outfit today is,
uh, a statement.

243
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:20,750
Hey, since it's been forever,
let's celebrate.

244
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,130
You know, let's go somewhere after this.
Let's have fun.

245
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:24,050
Hello, Jae-i.

246
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:27,470
You've really got nothing to say?

247
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,560
-He-ra.
-Yeah?

248
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,310
I'm gonna play a game with Ri-an.

249
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,980
A game? Like what?

250
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,600
The winner gets their wish granted.

251
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:42,190
What kind of wish?

252
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,230
You'll find out.

253
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,280
Three laps, I take the pole.

254
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,030
When I win, that's it.

255
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,780
Once you agree, no backing out.

256
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,030
You haven't won yet.

257
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,660
Now, if I win,

258
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,870
you'll have to start by explaining

259
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,460
what the hell is going on here.

260
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,620
What's gotten into those two?

261
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:06,290
-Why are they so extra?
-Uh, who knows.

262
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:28,480
♪ Wild ♪

263
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:35,070
♪ I'm wild ♪

264
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:41,700
♪ I'm wild… ♪

265
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:17,070
♪ Now I'm coming for you
Now I'm coming full attack ♪

266
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,450
♪ Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh ♪

267
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:23,120
♪ Now I'm coming full attack ♪

268
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,750
♪ Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh ♪

269
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:30,670
♪ Now I'm coming for you
Now I'm coming full attack ♪

270
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:04,200
Hey, why were you driving like that?
You could have gotten hurt, Jae-i.

271
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:05,540
I won.

272
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,160
I won, so now…

273
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:10,750
now I'll…

274
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,710
tell you my wish.

275
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:17,970
We're finished.

276
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,550
I'm done.

277
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:37,610
He-ra.

278
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:39,240
-Yeah?
-Let's get going.

279
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:46,330
I don't get it. Did something happen
before she went to America?

280
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:49,910
I don't know. I have no idea.

281
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,380
I've never seen them act this way.

282
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,010
Say that again.

283
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:02,840
Let's break up. Let's end it.

284
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,760
But why?

285
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:08,480
I'm talking to you.
Why are you doing this?

286
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,940
You… you acted like a total stranger
before you left,

287
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,520
then you go radio silent
and disappear for three months?

288
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,860
And this is the first thing you say to me?

289
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:21,070
We were six years old when we met.

290
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:24,240
And then the summer we turned 15,

291
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,990
you said you liked me
from the moment you saw me.

292
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:30,160
Why?

293
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,120
What was your reasoning?

294
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:34,710
You don't have to have a reason when--

295
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:35,710
Exactly.

296
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:36,880
There was none.

297
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:42,180
There isn't a good reason
for why you like or dislike someone.

298
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,640
Hey!

299
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,550
Let's be friends.

300
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,060
Just be friends from now on.

301
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,890
I won the bet.

302
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,440
Keep your word.

303
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,230
Hey, Jae-i.

304
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,190
Come on, Jae-i!

305
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,560
He's killing it.

306
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:40,480
Really giving "sexy bad boy"
even more than usual.

307
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:43,400
Did you see the bandage
on his hand? Is he hurt?

308
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:48,370
Jae-i. Rooibos.

309
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,580
Oh, thank you.

310
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,790
Did you… get home all right?

311
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,290
I saw Ri-an got hurt.

312
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:58,210
-Did something happen after--
-He-ra.

313
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,550
Maybe later.

314
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:05,550
All right, then. Well, good chat.

315
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,450
We have no special announcements.

316
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:35,750
If anyone needs to change their classes,
you have until the end of the week.

317
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:39,130
Let's make this semester
an uneventful one, please.

318
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,960
And with that, good luck
with your classes today.

319
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:47,260
Class President, could you and I
have a word, please?

320
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,720
Hey, signing up for cello?
I'm playing flute.

321
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:56,230
Probably stick to cello.
No way I'd have time for both.

322
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:58,350
Sorry, I have a question for you.

323
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,730
Class changes. How do you apply?

324
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,230
What?

325
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,360
I heard there were classes like rowing
and fencing, but none on my schedule.

326
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,070
Why are you asking me that?

327
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,860
You should ask your little friends.

328
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:11,780
"Friends"?

329
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,120
-So, uh…
-What now?

330
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:21,080
Where do I go to change classes?

331
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:25,460
Here's the main event schedule
for the semester.

332
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:28,680
Ju-won.

333
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,050
Can you please
keep an eye on the new student?

334
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:35,220
You're our class president, so I'd like
to make sure his transition goes smoothly.

335
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:37,480
So what happened before

336
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:40,100
doesn't happen again.

337
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,020
Yes, ma'am.

338
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,870
Did you figure out what her problem was?

339
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,700
There was none.

340
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,540
There isn't a good reason

341
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,880
for why you like or dislike someone.

342
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,420
Let's backtrack.

343
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:11,930
I remember you had your falling out
around my birthday,

344
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:13,930
right before she ran to the States.

345
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:15,720
So you don't have any idea at all?

346
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:19,100
No idea what might've upset her?
Come on, think.

347
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,730
No idea.

348
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:25,610
Damn, man. Sounds like you should've
given up trying to figure it out.

349
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:28,990
You can spend years and never figure out
why a girl's mad at you. They're insane.

350
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,070
Hey!

351
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:33,910
You could apologize.
"I don't know what I did, but I'm wrong."

352
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:35,660
That's when she'll come clean.

353
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:38,120
"Actually, okay, this is why I was upset."

354
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,330
And even then, you won't get it.

355
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,920
Yun-seok's kinda got a point.

356
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:48,340
Go to her and say you're sorry.

357
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,340
Girls sometimes
put their men through tests.

358
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,720
What tests?

359
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,760
Just to see if you'll say sorry to her.

360
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,220
Apologize. Say you can't live without her.

361
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:59,140
Girls eat that up. Trust me.

362
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,060
Even Jae-i?

363
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,350
She's a girl, isn't she?

364
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:05,190
Tell you what. Let's have a party.

365
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:07,690
At the vacation home.
He can tell her there.

366
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:09,150
Ooh, that sounds like fun.

367
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,740
-Right?
-Yeah!

368
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,030
I wanna do magic.

369
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:14,740
Um, please tell me
he's not actually going to sit there.

370
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:18,450
You crazy bastard!

371
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,910
Move aside.

372
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,010
A little birdie told me you're having
a hard time learning your place here.

373
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,930
I am?

374
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:38,300
Ri-an hadn't even left the assembly yet,
and you just stood up.

375
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,720
You were snooping around
all the special classrooms.

376
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:42,520
Tried to sit wherever
you damn well pleased.

377
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,600
And today,
trying to sit on the stands, bro?

378
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:48,650
I did. That was wrong?

379
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,400
This guy's clueless, Chan-min.

380
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,110
For a kid who came here on scholarship,
he isn't very smart.

381
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,370
He even asked Ye-ji
about how to change classes earlier.

382
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:59,370
The Jooshin Mart owner's kid.

383
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,040
So what's wrong?
What's wrong with the classes you're in?

384
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:09,250
I just-- I would rather
do fencing and rowing.

385
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:11,670
Fencing and rowing?

386
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,920
There were no classes
like that at my old school.

387
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:15,800
But this school's cool. They even have--

388
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,390
Go to the staff room for that.

389
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:21,890
But can you… even afford
the special class fees?

390
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:24,520
Rowing's around 40 million won a pop.

391
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,350
Fencing's a little bit cheaper.

392
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,850
Forty million?

393
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,900
Oh! Pretty pricey!

394
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,070
Jeez.

395
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,530
All right, newbie. Listen carefully.

396
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,490
This school isn't like
any other school you've been to

397
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:44,080
'cause Jooshin's rules are different.

398
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,200
The rule?

399
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:47,710
Never piss off the wrong people.

400
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:49,580
And who are they?

401
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:53,090
Jae-i, Hera, Woo-jin,
and especially Ri-an.

402
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:54,170
They're the royalty.

403
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,720
Why are they royalty?

404
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,090
What do you mean, "why"?
It's obvious.

405
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:01,350
They're not like us, all right!
We're scholarship kids.

406
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:05,100
They give us different colored ties
based on our status to set us apart.

407
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,600
Scholarship kids get navy.

408
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:08,350
The others get maroon.

409
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,520
Ri-an's great-grandfather
founded the school.

410
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:15,440
His grandfather and his descendants
all went to this school, so he's a given

411
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:18,360
because he was born into a family
who contributed to the school.

412
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:21,740
We're only able to study here
thanks to their generosity.

413
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:25,120
So it's only right we treat him
with respect, don't you think?

414
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:28,920
"Respect."

415
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,420
Dude, come on!

416
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,920
It's not that hard.
Just get it through your thick skull!

417
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,670
Don't snoop where you don't belong.

418
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:37,170
And do your best to stay out of their way.

419
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:40,050
-Why is that so hard to grasp?
-No. It's just…

420
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:42,850
Respect. I got that.

421
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:46,060
But putting them on a pedestal,
treating them like royalty?

422
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,140
You don't think that
might be a little extreme?

423
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:51,350
You can call it
whatever the fuck you want!

424
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,980
Think I'm overreacting, do you?

425
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:55,440
You should be as well.

426
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:03,280
Do you know why you're even here?

427
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,830
There was an opening
for a scholarship student.

428
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,170
Why was there a spot open?

429
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,090
Here's why!

430
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,470
The kid ignored my warnings
and stepped out of line…

431
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,520
and was killed by Ri-an.

432
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:49,910
Uh…

433
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:54,670
I think I understand what you're saying.

434
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:58,500
I should, uh, try to get along with them

435
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,300
if I want my school life
to be a lot easier.

436
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:04,970
I'll keep that in mind. Thank you.

437
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:12,230
You think he got the message?

438
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:14,650
Why is that moron still smiling?

439
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,950
I've been here a few days
but never got to say hi.

440
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:28,620
You guys remember me?

441
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,080
Kang Ha.

442
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,750
Nice to meet you, Kim Ri-an.

443
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,720
Oh my God.

444
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,260
You're slacking off, buddy!

445
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:50,350
-Come get your boy.
-Sorry, Yun-seok.

446
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:52,140
You prick.

447
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:54,600
Oh my God! You pranked him, didn't you?

448
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:55,850
Oh, not a prank.

449
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:58,310
What did they tell you?
We're evil rich kids?

450
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,780
So suck up to us
so we don't eat you alive, right?

451
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,240
Hmm?

452
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,700
Well, they were wrong.
They were pranking you.

453
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:11,040
Yeah, we really should've had your party
before you got hazed.

454
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,370
You're coming, right?

455
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:15,370
It's gonna be your welcome party, okay?

456
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,830
Welcome party?

457
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,670
See you tomorrow. I'll send you a ride.

458
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,300
See you.

459
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:24,920
Better be there. We'll be waiting.

460
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,950
That should do it.

461
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,620
She'll like this? Are you sure?

462
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,410
Jae-i will?

463
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,080
Pretty sure.

464
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:00,460
I'll see if she's on her way.

465
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:05,590
This is totally not her style.

466
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:32,780
Jae-i, girl. I'm serious.

467
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:34,990
I won't start the party
until you get here.

468
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,750
So hurry up!

469
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:11,700
Uh, no electronics past this point.

470
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,660
Your cell phone and other devices

471
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,620
will be stored
and returned when you leave.

472
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:17,830

All right. What do you say
we get this party started?

505
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:03,810
How about a welcome shot?

506
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:05,440
Welcome shots coming up.

507
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,230
A time-honored tradition.

508
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:12,070
We do it with scholarship kids.
Like a lucky draw.

509
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:12,990
How so?

510
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:15,150
Five of these shots
are regular alcohol,

511
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:18,280
but one is something very special.

512
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:20,410
Whoa!

513
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:22,080
"Something special"?

514
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,040
You'll know it if you drink it.

515
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,250
-All right, then. I'll start.
-All right!

516
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,010
Ooh!

517
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,180
Regular booze.

518
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:51,110
I don't drink alcohol.

519
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,860
Drink the shot.

520
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,820
Drink the shot.

521
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:01,530
Drink the shot.

522
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,910
Drink the shot!

523
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:06,210
Drink the shot!
Drink the shot! Drink the shot!

524
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:10,290
We went through all this trouble for you.
You can at least try it.

525
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,920
-Pick a shot!
-You do it!

526
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,840
-Come on.
-Pick one, pick one, pick one.

527
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:25,060
Okay!

528
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:41,910
Yeah!

529
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,290
Yeah!

530
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,840
Let's get this party started!

531
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:02,220
Whoo!

532
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:04,140
It's the weekend!

533
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:15,610
The next magic trick
will be tissue magic!

534
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:19,990
Eat the tissues.

535
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:21,990
Yeah, suck it down.

536
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:27,950
It keeps coming out!

537
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:42,180
Now, begone!

538
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:44,640
-Magic show's over!
-The show is over!

539
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,680
All right, let's make a bet.

540
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:50,270
Between you and Chan-min, who can walk
in a straight line without tripping?

541
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:52,480
Loser pays 500,000 won.

542
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,650
All right!

543
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:54,650
Go!

544
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:59,280
Stop breaking things!

545
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,610
Do you know
how much all of this costs, asshole?

546
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:05,620
Oh no. Jesus. He's screwed.

547
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,660
Dude, you better call your mom.
Not playing.

548
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:11,160
This is fucking serious.
You better get your parents on the phone.

549
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:14,670
-Hey! Come on!
-Ew!

550
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:43,450
Spin the wheel!

551
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:46,070
Spin it!

552
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,160
Spin it!

553
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:52,410
It's Ba-da!

554
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,710
Okay, you're it, Ba-da. You're up.

555
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:56,920
Your question is…

556
00:44:57,580 --> 00:45:00,460
When was the last time you did it?
Truth or dare?

557
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:03,920
Truth. Mmm, nope, dare.

558
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:06,430
-Oh, come on. Don't chicken out.
-Whoa!

559
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:07,890
Tell us anyway.

560
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:10,810
Okay, spill. Was it, like, this morning?

561
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:12,270
-No way.
-Forget it.

562
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:14,140
I'll just take the damn shot.

563
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:15,770
Girl, seriously?

564
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,480
-I'll take it.
-Aw!

565
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:21,900
-Look at this guy.
-You're so sweet!

566
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:24,950
Look at that.
Chivalry is not dead.

567
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:31,240
You're finally back, Jung Jae-i.

568
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:45,630
Do you remember?
October 27th last year.

569
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,430
I was surprised.

570
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:50,350
Do you think your dad
would like this video too?

571
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:56,060
Let's talk.

572
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:01,900
Okay, okay. One more round.

573
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:04,070
-Last time, I promise!
-Better make it count.

574
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:05,900
Spin it!

575
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,740
Come on. Come on, come on.

576
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:52,910
I know

577
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:55,990
it isn't your style.

578
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:57,450
But I…

579
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,250
I mean, I thought I had to do something.

580
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:06,090
I'm sorry.

581
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:09,420
For what?

582
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:10,510
Whatever I did.

583
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,010
I'm sorry for everything.

584
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:14,720
I don't need an apology.

585
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:17,220
But

586
00:47:17,890 --> 00:47:19,770
I do need you to accept that

587
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:21,400
it's over.

588
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,770
And I won't tell you why.

589
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:25,110
Till the day I die.

590
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:27,570
Are you hearing yourself
right now?

591
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:30,320
Just tell me what the hell is going on!

592
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,740
You have to give me a reason, or else--
No, I can't just accept it.

593
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,880
Come on, come on, come on!

594
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:50,130
It's Kang Ha!

595
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:51,760
-Oh!
-Scholarship kid!

596
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:52,760
Your turn, newbie.

597
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:57,430
All right, is there a girl here
you'd wanna sleep with tonight?

598
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:03,270
Choose wisely.
Depending on who you pick,

599
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:04,520
she might let you.

600
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:09,190
-Truth.
-Truth.

601
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,440
Hmm.

602
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:22,410
No. Dare.

603
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:24,630
All right, dare.

604
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:29,550
Hmm. Kiss one of us girls with tongue
for three whole minutes.

605
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:32,260
Oh! French kiss? French kiss!

606
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:34,340
French kiss! French kiss!

607
00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:37,050
-French kiss! French kiss!
-Hey.

608
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,560
Ooh!

609
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:42,520
-Oh, I thought he was angry.
-Oh my gosh.

610
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,690
-Oh!
-Dude.

611
00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:08,000
Where… where you going?

612
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:10,300
Oh, that fucker
already had a girl in mind!

613
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,380
-Come on, let's go!
-Wait for us!

614
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:13,470
Follow him!

615
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:24,140
I hope you haven't forgotten
the promise I made you,

616
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:25,850
In-han.

617
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:32,360
In-Han.

618
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:40,830
I said I'll do whatever it takes

619
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:44,120
to find whoever did that to you.

620
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:49,250
K… K… Kang

621
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:52,460
K… K…

622
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:01,890
The bastard who killed you.

623
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:06,350
Why was there a spot open?

624
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:10,190
The kid ignored my warnings
and stepped out of line

625
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:12,690
and was killed by Ri-an.

626
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:20,570
Why are you here?

627
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,580
To expose everything.

628
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:25,250
Everything that asshole did to you.

629
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:27,160
What the hell do you want?

630
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:44,970
I'll expose it…

631
00:50:45,970 --> 00:50:46,890
no matter what.
