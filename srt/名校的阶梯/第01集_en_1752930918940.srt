HIERARCHY

00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,650
You're crazy.
Everyone here is crazy.

3
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,110
You're crazy.

4
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:34,150
You're all crazy!

5
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,860
I'm going to expose it all!

6
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,500
You're all crazy!

7
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:49,790
The teachers, the students,

8
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,960
the entire school
are all completely deranged!

9
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,970
I don't care! I have to--

10
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,390
I'm… I'm gonna expose everything
that's going on here!

00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:29,750
EPISODE 1
NEWBIE PARTY: TRUTH OR DARE

12
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,480
The problem can
easily be solved once you graph

13
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,150
the absolute value of x…

14
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:03,910
The answer…

15
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,580
"I saw thee weep

16
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,620
The big bright tear

17
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,290
Came o'er that eye of blue

18
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,460
And then methought it did appear…"

19
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,330
FIRST SEMESTER OPENING CEREMONY

20
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:01,930
A new semester has begun
at the most prestigious school in Korea,

21
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:06,970
Jooshin High, where we take pride
in our time-honored traditions.

22
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,730
In the spirit of those traditions,

23
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:17,820
we're putting Jooshin's motto,
"noblesse oblige," into practice.

24
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,570
To celebrate this new semester,

25
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,860
let's welcome
our new scholarship recipient,

26
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,990
who was hand selected…

27
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,910
out of quite a few applicants.

28
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,620
Kang Ha. Come.

29
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:35,630
Yes, ma'am.

30
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:45,010
Scholarship students never last here.
Why admit them anymore?

31
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,510
Because they wanna give
the poor kids a chance too.

32
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,520
"Noblesse oblige," you know?
They can't forget that.

33
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,230
-Who? The principal?
-Check, check.

34
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,600
No, the school owners.

35
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:55,850
Ri-an's mom and dad.

36
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,560
Good morning,

37
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,150
students, seniors, and underclassmen.

38
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,200
My name is Kang Ha.

39
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,870
As the first to ace
the Jooshin High scholarship…

40
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,130
Hey.

41
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,100
As the first student to ace the test…

42
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:38,940
Check.

43
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,700
-Finally.
-You're late.

44
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,660
Please continue.

45
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,040
Uh, ah. Oh, it's working.

46
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,410
So, uh, where was I?

47
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,460
Um, the exam! Right.

48
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,750
I got the highest grade.

49
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,460
-He has such a cute smile.
-How I got here doesn't matter…

50
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,460
He's got this puppy dog energy, right?

51
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,880
…today transferring
to Korea's best private school…

52
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,510
…Jooshin High.

53
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:09,390
To honor that reputation,
I intend to focus on my studies

54
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:12,770
and keep getting good grades
so I can live up to your school's legacy.

55
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,730
I look forward to the year ahead.

56
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,940
JUST TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON

57
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,490
ANSWER THE PHONE, JAE-I
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

58
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:31,240
That concludes
our opening ceremonies.

59
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:34,870
Now, students, I'll ask you to begin
making your way to your classes, please.

60
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,500
-Whoa. Sit down.
-What? What?

61
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,580
Just sit down.

62
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,130
What's wrong?

63
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,050
That crazy fucking dumbass.

64
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:56,770
What've you been up to?
I was messaging Ye-ji the whole time.

65
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:01,940
Excuse me.

66
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:05,480
Hello. I was just up there.
I'm the new student.

67
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:08,320
I have English first period,
but I don't know where I'm going.

68
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,450
Could you help me?

69
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:11,320
You're too happy.

70
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,540
You need time to get to know your place.

71
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,490
Hmm?

72
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,460
Get to know my what?
You're leaving? Uh, all right.

73
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,590
You lost? They'll show you where to go.

74
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,090
Gimme your number.

75
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,930
What? For…

76
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,470
Well, I didn't expect that.

77
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,640
I figured you might want
someone to help you out.

78
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,180
Like, if you have any questions.

79
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,270
Ah. Right.

80
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,440
Thank you.

81
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,610
-What's your handle?
-We'll follow you back.

82
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,230
-I'm not on anything.
-No social media?

83
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,190
Mm-mm.

84
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,910
There you go.
I should get going. See you, guys.

85
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,240
Wow.

86
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,540
He is such a weirdo.

87
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,790
Wow.

88
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,630
What is this?

89
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,050
Yeah, not there.

90
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,270
Oh, hello.

91
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:23,600
The scholarship student?
You're not allowed in here.

92
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,360
This is English, isn't it?

93
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,400
At the end of the hall. Standard A.

94
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,690
This is Special A.

95
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,360
Ah, so not here.

96
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,240
-Hi.
-Fuckin' scholarship kid.

97
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,580
Why's he in here?

98
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,920
I'm so excited.
I can't wait to get tickets.

99
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,470
That's my seat.

100
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,470
Ah, okay.

101
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,350
Uh, sorry.

102
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:59,310
That's my friend's seat.

103
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,310
Oh, is it?

104
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,870
No bag hook?

105
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,740
Shaved off 1.25 seconds.

106
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,870
Ri-an, how about we grab lunch?

107
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,170
Any classes left?

108
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,010
I'm all done. You have one more, right?

109
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,260
At 4:00. Social studies.

110
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,850
Woo-jin's so weird lately.
He dating anyone?

111
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,150
And Jae-i? Still ghosting you?

112
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:53,380
If you two haven't made up
with each other,

113
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,630
then maybe I

114
00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:00,640
should make a play for her king
while the queen is away.

115
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,850
How do I get that checkmate?

116
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,180
I worked out the whole break.

117
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:11,400
Take a good look. Did my work pay off?

118
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,860
I don't even need to look.

119
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:20,360
I'm well aware you've got a body
models would kill for.

120
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:22,240
So

121
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,660
stop messing around.

122
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,580
I wasn't though.

123
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,080
You didn't have to be
so direct about it. Damn.

124
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,590
Where you going?

125
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,920
I have plans.

126
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,590
Not fleeing from humiliation.

127
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,660
Jae-i!

128
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,220
What'd you do for three months
in America all alone?

129
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,970
I have cousins in Irvine,
so I had stuff to do.

130
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,730
Wow. I'm still pretty hurt.

131
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:35,650
Always sent me straight to voicemail.
I mean, you can do that to me and Woo-jin.

132
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:38,900
But don't tell me
you also did that to Ri-an?

133
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,410
Of course. I knew it. Something was up.
Now I know why he's been so moody lately.

134
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,320
You fight or something? What's wrong?

135
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:49,580
I mean, even if you did,
you'll always be inseparable.

136
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,660
How could you ghost him for that long?

137
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,830
I have something to say to everyone.

138
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,750
What is it?

139
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:58,250
I have plans in the morning, but let's do
Sunday afternoon at the track.

140
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,210
The racecourse?

141
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,510
Why there? And why does
she want me to assemble the troops?

142
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,440
Assemblyman Lee.
Over here. Let's take a group photo.

143
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,690
Say "kimchi."

144
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,440
-Kimchi!
-One, two, three.

145
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,450
-Kimchi!
-All right, we got it.

146
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:26,950
-Give yourselves a round of applause.
-Well done.

147
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,280
Bye.

148
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:33,830
Attention, everyone.
Are you all free Sunday afternoon?

149
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,620
It's been a while. Let's hang out.

150
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,790
Thank you!

151
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,800
Jooshin Electronics'
cell phone sales have been on the rise.

152
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,470
Especially in Barcelona.

153
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,050
I read that this morning.

154
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,760
What about France?

155
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,220
Jooshin bakery brand
will be launched--

156
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,220
Just a moment.

157
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,770
Our Jung Jae-i
has finally come back to us.

158
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,560
Let's meet at the track Sunday.
Don't be late, all right?

159
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:11,580
And this one?
What do you think?

160
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,250
It complements your complexion.

161
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,210
This one here.

162
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:28,220
OUR JUNG JAE-I HAS FINALLY COME BACK TO US
LET'S MEET AT THE TRACK SUNDAY

163
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,430
I certainly hope
the food is to your liking.

164
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,650
I don't often indulge
in such luxuries.

165
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,190
You spoil me, truly.

166
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,610
Sharing a beautiful meal
in a beautiful garden

167
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,650
and with you, above all people,
Chairman Jung.

168
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:45,780
Thank you.

169
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:49,200
Assemblyman Lee has mentioned
organizing a lunch several times,

170
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,780
but I was busy,
so I hope it was worth the wait.

171
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:54,910
Pardon me, but may I say
you have a beautiful daughter?

172
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,500
I bet she takes after her mother.

173
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,750
Oh, do you think so?

174
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,000
I appreciate it, but I think Jae-i is…

175
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,340
far, far prettier.

176
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,390
Blessed with both looks
and brains and excels in school.

177
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,140
You must be so proud.

178
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,980
Woo-jin told me that Jae-i is
at the top of her class at Jooshin High.

179
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,400
Well, we've been pretty lucky.

180
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,190
The children study hard
without us having to push them, really.

181
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,400
We're proud of our Jae-hyeok as well.

182
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,650
Graduated from Hanguk Middle,
top of his class last year.

183
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:31,410
I'm just glad to have graduated.

184
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,370
You graduated
from Hanguk Middle School?

185
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,740
That's my alma mater!

186
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:37,750
I didn't expect to meet
a fellow alumnus here. Wow!

187
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,840
Jae-i?

188
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,140
Are you not feeling well?

189
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:55,350
I noticed you weren't really eating much.

190
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,930
I'm fine, thank you.

191
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,440
Well, we'll be heading upstairs for tea.
Come up when you're ready.

192
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,310
All right. Be right up.

193
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,190
That outfit…

194
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,280
Did you pick out that dress?

195
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,910
You should go and get changed.

196
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:19,660
I just don't think it suits
an occasion like today's.

197
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,830
People are judging us
on the tiniest details.

198
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,580
Your style.
How tasteful your clothes are. Everything.

199
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:29,300
Try dressing more modestly, classier.
A bit, uh, a bit more like your mother.

200
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,970
And which mother are you referring to?

201
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,140
-Stepmother?
-We're not doing this again!

202
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,940
I mean my wife, and you know that.

203
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,730
The woman you were raised by.

204
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,110
Not the one who gave birth to you.

205
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,320
Anyway, I think you'd better
go change that outfit.

206
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,370
I'll go get changed.

207
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,330
And while we're at it…

208
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,420
you need to put on
a different shade of lipstick.

209
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,340
Look at that. The color, it's…

210
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,590
it's vulgar.

211
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,350
Just exactly like your birth mother.

212
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:23,350
You are my firstborn.

213
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,100
I hope you will start behaving

214
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,860
more like my child

215
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,610
and heir to the Jaeyul Group.

216
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,700
I'll see you upstairs.

217
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,180
JOOSHIN HIGH RECEIVES
MORE APPLICANTS IN 2024

218
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,840
I'm just, um,

219
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,170
working part-time.

220
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,300
A gig, playing piano.

221
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,680
I… was taking a short break,
but it's over now.

222
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,190
Gotta get back.

223
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,820
Do you need this? To wipe off your…

224
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:38,820
Yeah, no.

225
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,530
You can give me your shirt.

226
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,620
-What?
-Your shirt.

227
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,370
I need to borrow one.

228
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:48,120
My shirt?

229
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,750
I have to be somewhere,
but I can't go looking like this.

230
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,170
Oh. Right. Right.

231
00:18:56,050 --> 00:19:00,130
It's just-- I couldn't just walk around
without a shirt on, you know?

232
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,340
Okay, wait.

233
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,360
Looks like…

234
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,820
you need this more than I do.

235
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,000
Jeez, it's cold.

236
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,110
Don't they get freaked out?
Why do they do this?

237
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,150
I don't get it either.

238
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,150
For the thrill. To feel alive.

239
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,780
Hey, Jae-i!

240
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,620
It's been forever.

241
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:13,370
-I really missed you.
-How are you?

242
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,130
Your outfit today is,
uh, a statement.

243
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:59,750
Hey, since it's been forever,
let's celebrate.

244
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,130
You know, let's go somewhere after this.
Let's have fun.

245
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:03,050
Hello, Jae-i.

246
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:06,470
You've really got nothing to say?

247
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,560
-He-ra.
-Yeah?

248
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,310
I'm gonna play a game with Ri-an.

249
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,980
A game? Like what?

250
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,600
The winner gets their wish granted.

251
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:21,190
What kind of wish?

252
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,230
You'll find out.

253
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,280
Three laps, I take the pole.

254
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,030
When I win, that's it.

255
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,780
Once you agree, no backing out.

256
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,030
You haven't won yet.

257
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,660
Now, if I win,

258
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,870
you'll have to start by explaining

259
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,460
what the hell is going on here.

260
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,620
What's gotten into those two?

261
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:45,290
-Why are they so extra?
-Uh, who knows.

262
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:07,480
♪ Wild ♪

263
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:14,070
♪ I'm wild ♪

264
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:20,700
♪ I'm wild… ♪

265
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:56,070
♪ Now I'm coming for you
Now I'm coming full attack ♪

266
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,450
♪ Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh ♪

267
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:02,120
♪ Now I'm coming full attack ♪

268
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,750
♪ Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh ♪

269
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:09,670
♪ Now I'm coming for you
Now I'm coming full attack ♪

270
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,200
Hey, why were you driving like that?
You could have gotten hurt, Jae-i.

271
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:44,540
I won.

272
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,160
I won, so now…

273
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:49,750
now I'll…

274
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,710
tell you my wish.

275
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:56,970
We're finished.

276
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,550
I'm done.

277
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:16,610
He-ra.

278
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:18,240
-Yeah?
-Let's get going.

279
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,330
I don't get it. Did something happen
before she went to America?

280
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:28,910
I don't know. I have no idea.

281
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,380
I've never seen them act this way.

282
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,010
Say that again.

283
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:41,840
Let's break up. Let's end it.

284
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,760
But why?

285
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:47,480
I'm talking to you.
Why are you doing this?

286
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,940
You… you acted like a total stranger
before you left,

287
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,520
then you go radio silent
and disappear for three months?

288
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,860
And this is the first thing you say to me?

289
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:00,070
We were six years old when we met.

290
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:03,240
And then the summer we turned 15,

291
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,990
you said you liked me
from the moment you saw me.

292
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:09,160
Why?

293
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,120
What was your reasoning?

294
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:13,710
You don't have to have a reason when--

295
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:14,710
Exactly.

296
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:15,880
There was none.

297
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:21,180
There isn't a good reason
for why you like or dislike someone.

298
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,640
Hey!

299
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,550
Let's be friends.

300
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,060
Just be friends from now on.

301
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,890
I won the bet.

302
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,440
Keep your word.

303
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,230
Hey, Jae-i.

304
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,190
Come on, Jae-i!

305
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:16,560
He's killing it.

306
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:19,480
Really giving "sexy bad boy"
even more than usual.

307
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:22,400
Did you see the bandage
on his hand? Is he hurt?

308
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:27,370
Jae-i. Rooibos.

309
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,580
Oh, thank you.

310
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,790
Did you… get home all right?

311
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,290
I saw Ri-an got hurt.

312
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:37,210
-Did something happen after--
-He-ra.

313
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,550
Maybe later.

314
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:44,550
All right, then. Well, good chat.

315
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,450
We have no special announcements.

316
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:14,750
If anyone needs to change their classes,
you have until the end of the week.

317
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:18,130
Let's make this semester
an uneventful one, please.

318
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,960
And with that, good luck
with your classes today.

319
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:26,260
Class President, could you and I
have a word, please?

320
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:32,720
Hey, signing up for cello?
I'm playing flute.

321
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:35,230
Probably stick to cello.
No way I'd have time for both.

322
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:37,350
Sorry, I have a question for you.

323
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,730
Class changes. How do you apply?

324
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,230
What?

325
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,360
I heard there were classes like rowing
and fencing, but none on my schedule.

326
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,070
Why are you asking me that?

327
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,860
You should ask your little friends.

328
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,780
"Friends"?

329
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,120
-So, uh…
-What now?

330
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:00,080
Where do I go to change classes?

331
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:04,460
Here's the main event schedule
for the semester.

332
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:07,680
Ju-won.

333
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,050
Can you please
keep an eye on the new student?

334
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:14,220
You're our class president, so I'd like
to make sure his transition goes smoothly.

335
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:16,480
So what happened before

336
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:19,100
doesn't happen again.

337
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,020
Yes, ma'am.

338
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,870
Did you figure out what her problem was?

339
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,700
There was none.

340
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:38,540
There isn't a good reason

341
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,880
for why you like or dislike someone.

342
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,420
Let's backtrack.

343
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:50,930
I remember you had your falling out
around my birthday,

344
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:52,930
right before she ran to the States.

345
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:54,720
So you don't have any idea at all?

346
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:58,100
No idea what might've upset her?
Come on, think.

347
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,730
No idea.

348
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:04,610
Damn, man. Sounds like you should've
given up trying to figure it out.

349
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:07,990
You can spend years and never figure out
why a girl's mad at you. They're insane.

350
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,070
Hey!

351
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:12,910
You could apologize.
"I don't know what I did, but I'm wrong."

352
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:14,660
That's when she'll come clean.

353
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,120
"Actually, okay, this is why I was upset."

354
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,330
And even then, you won't get it.

355
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:24,920
Yun-seok's kinda got a point.

356
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:27,340
Go to her and say you're sorry.

357
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,340
Girls sometimes
put their men through tests.

358
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,720
What tests?

359
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,760
Just to see if you'll say sorry to her.

360
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,220
Apologize. Say you can't live without her.

361
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,140
Girls eat that up. Trust me.

362
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,060
Even Jae-i?

363
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,350
She's a girl, isn't she?

364
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,190
Tell you what. Let's have a party.

365
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:46,690
At the vacation home.
He can tell her there.

366
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,150
Ooh, that sounds like fun.

367
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:49,740
-Right?
-Yeah!

368
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,030
I wanna do magic.

369
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:53,740
Um, please tell me
he's not actually going to sit there.

370
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:57,450
You crazy bastard!

371
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,910
Move aside.

372
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,010
A little birdie told me you're having
a hard time learning your place here.

373
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,930
I am?

374
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:17,300
Ri-an hadn't even left the assembly yet,
and you just stood up.

375
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:19,720
You were snooping around
all the special classrooms.

376
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:21,520
Tried to sit wherever
you damn well pleased.

377
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,600
And today,
trying to sit on the stands, bro?

378
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:27,650
I did. That was wrong?

379
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,400
This guy's clueless, Chan-min.

380
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,110
For a kid who came here on scholarship,
he isn't very smart.

381
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,370
He even asked Ye-ji
about how to change classes earlier.

382
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:38,370
The Jooshin Mart owner's kid.

383
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,040
So what's wrong?
What's wrong with the classes you're in?

384
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:48,250
I just-- I would rather
do fencing and rowing.

385
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:50,670
Fencing and rowing?

386
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,920
There were no classes
like that at my old school.

387
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:54,800
But this school's cool. They even have--

388
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,390
Go to the staff room for that.

389
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:00,890
But can you… even afford
the special class fees?

390
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:03,520
Rowing's around 40 million won a pop.

391
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,350
Fencing's a little bit cheaper.

392
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,850
Forty million?

393
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,900
Oh! Pretty pricey!

394
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,070
Jeez.

395
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,530
All right, newbie. Listen carefully.

396
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,490
This school isn't like
any other school you've been to

397
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:23,080
'cause Jooshin's rules are different.

398
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,200
The rule?

399
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:26,710
Never piss off the wrong people.

400
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:28,580
And who are they?

401
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:32,090
Jae-i, Hera, Woo-jin,
and especially Ri-an.

402
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:33,170
They're the royalty.

403
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,720
Why are they royalty?

404
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,090
What do you mean, "why"?
It's obvious.

405
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:40,350
They're not like us, all right!
We're scholarship kids.

406
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:44,100
They give us different colored ties
based on our status to set us apart.

407
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,600
Scholarship kids get navy.

408
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,350
The others get maroon.

409
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:50,520
Ri-an's great-grandfather
founded the school.

410
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:54,440
His grandfather and his descendants
all went to this school, so he's a given

411
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:57,360
because he was born into a family
who contributed to the school.

412
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:00,740
We're only able to study here
thanks to their generosity.

413
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:04,120
So it's only right we treat him
with respect, don't you think?

414
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:07,920
"Respect."

415
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,420
Dude, come on!

416
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,920
It's not that hard.
Just get it through your thick skull!

417
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,670
Don't snoop where you don't belong.

418
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:16,170
And do your best to stay out of their way.

419
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:19,050
-Why is that so hard to grasp?
-No. It's just…

420
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:21,850
Respect. I got that.

421
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:25,060
But putting them on a pedestal,
treating them like royalty?

422
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:28,140
You don't think that
might be a little extreme?

423
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,350
You can call it
whatever the fuck you want!

424
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,980
Think I'm overreacting, do you?

425
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,440
You should be as well.

426
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:42,280
Do you know why you're even here?

427
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,830
There was an opening
for a scholarship student.

428
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,170
Why was there a spot open?

429
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,090
Here's why!

430
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,470
The kid ignored my warnings
and stepped out of line…

431
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,520
and was killed by Ri-an.

432
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,910
Uh…

433
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,670
I think I understand what you're saying.

434
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,500
I should, uh, try to get along with them

435
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:39,300
if I want my school life
to be a lot easier.

436
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:43,970
I'll keep that in mind. Thank you.

437
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:51,230
You think he got the message?

438
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:53,650
Why is that moron still smiling?

439
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,950
I've been here a few days
but never got to say hi.

440
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:07,620
You guys remember me?

441
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,080
Kang Ha.

442
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,750
Nice to meet you, Kim Ri-an.

443
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,720
Oh my God.

444
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,260
You're slacking off, buddy!

445
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:29,350
-Come get your boy.
-Sorry, Yun-seok.

446
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:31,140
You prick.

447
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,600
Oh my God! You pranked him, didn't you?

448
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:34,850
Oh, not a prank.

449
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:37,310
What did they tell you?
We're evil rich kids?

450
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,780
So suck up to us
so we don't eat you alive, right?

451
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,240
Hmm?

452
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:44,700
Well, they were wrong.
They were pranking you.

453
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:50,040
Yeah, we really should've had your party
before you got hazed.

454
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,370
You're coming, right?

455
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:54,370
It's gonna be your welcome party, okay?

456
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,830
Welcome party?

457
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:58,670
See you tomorrow. I'll send you a ride.

458
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,300
See you.

459
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:03,920
Better be there. We'll be waiting.

460
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,950
That should do it.

461
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,620
She'll like this? Are you sure?

462
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:35,410
Jae-i will?

463
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,080
Pretty sure.

464
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:39,460
I'll see if she's on her way.

465
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,590
This is totally not her style.

466
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:11,780
Jae-i, girl. I'm serious.

467
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:13,990
I won't start the party
until you get here.

468
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,750
So hurry up!

469
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:50,700
Uh, no electronics past this point.

470
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,660
Your cell phone and other devices

471
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,620
will be stored
and returned when you leave.

472
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:56,830

Tonight is going to be so much fun.

All right. What do you say
we get this party started?

505
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:42,810
How about a welcome shot?

506
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:44,440
Welcome shots coming up.

507
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,230
A time-honored tradition.

508
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,070
We do it with scholarship kids.
Like a lucky draw.

509
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:51,990
How so?

510
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:54,150
Five of these shots
are regular alcohol,

511
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,280
but one is something very special.

512
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:59,410
Whoa!

513
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,080
"Something special"?

514
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,040
You'll know it if you drink it.

515
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,250
-All right, then. I'll start.
-All right!

516
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:12,010
Ooh!

517
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,180
Regular booze.

518
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:30,110
I don't drink alcohol.

519
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,860
Drink the shot.

520
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,820
Drink the shot.

521
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:40,530
Drink the shot.

522
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,910
Drink the shot!

523
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:45,210
Drink the shot!
Drink the shot! Drink the shot!

524
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:49,290
We went through all this trouble for you.
You can at least try it.

525
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:55,920
-Pick a shot!
-You do it!

526
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,840
-Come on.
-Pick one, pick one, pick one.

527
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:04,060
Okay!

528
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:20,910
Yeah!

529
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,290
Yeah!

530
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,840
Let's get this party started!

531
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,220
Whoo!

532
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,140
It's the weekend!

533
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:54,610
The next magic trick
will be tissue magic!

534
00:42:57,690 --> 00:42:58,990
Eat the tissues.

535
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:00,990
Yeah, suck it down.

536
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:06,950
It keeps coming out!

537
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:21,180
Now, begone!

538
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:23,640
-Magic show's over!
-The show is over!

539
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,680
All right, let's make a bet.

540
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:29,270
Between you and Chan-min, who can walk
in a straight line without tripping?

541
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:31,480
Loser pays 500,000 won.

542
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:32,650
All right!

543
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:33,650
Go!

544
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:38,280
Stop breaking things!

545
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,610
Do you know
how much all of this costs, asshole?

546
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,620
Oh no. Jesus. He's screwed.

547
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,660
Dude, you better call your mom.
Not playing.

548
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:50,160
This is fucking serious.
You better get your parents on the phone.

549
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:53,670
-Hey! Come on!
-Ew!

550
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:22,450
Spin the wheel!

551
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:25,070
Spin it!

552
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,160
Spin it!

553
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:31,410
It's Ba-da!

554
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,710
Okay, you're it, Ba-da. You're up.

555
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:35,920
Your question is…

556
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:39,460
When was the last time you did it?
Truth or dare?

557
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:42,920
Truth. Mmm, nope, dare.

558
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:45,430
-Oh, come on. Don't chicken out.
-Whoa!

559
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:46,890
Tell us anyway.

560
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:49,810
Okay, spill. Was it, like, this morning?

561
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:51,270
-No way.
-Forget it.

562
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:53,140
I'll just take the damn shot.

563
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:54,770
Girl, seriously?

564
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:58,480
-I'll take it.
-Aw!

565
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:00,900
-Look at this guy.
-You're so sweet!

566
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:03,950
Look at that.
Chivalry is not dead.

567
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:10,240
You're finally back, Jung Jae-i.

568
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:24,630
Do you remember?
October 27th last year.

569
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,430
I was surprised.

570
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:29,350
Do you think your dad
would like this video too?

571
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:35,060
Let's talk.

572
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:40,900
Okay, okay. One more round.

573
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:43,070
-Last time, I promise!
-Better make it count.

574
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:44,900
Spin it!

575
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,740
Come on. Come on, come on.

576
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:31,910
I know

577
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:34,990
it isn't your style.

578
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:36,450
But I…

579
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,250
I mean, I thought I had to do something.

580
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:45,090
I'm sorry.

581
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:48,420
For what?

582
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:49,510
Whatever I did.

583
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,010
I'm sorry for everything.

584
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,720
I don't need an apology.

585
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:56,220
But

586
00:46:56,890 --> 00:46:58,770
I do need you to accept that

587
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:00,400
it's over.

588
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,770
And I won't tell you why.

589
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:04,110
Till the day I die.

590
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:06,570
Are you hearing yourself
right now?

591
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:09,320
Just tell me what the hell is going on!

592
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:12,740
You have to give me a reason, or else--
No, I can't just accept it.

593
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,880
Come on, come on, come on!

594
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:29,130
It's Kang Ha!

595
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:30,760
-Oh!
-Scholarship kid!

596
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:31,760
Your turn, newbie.

597
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:36,430
All right, is there a girl here
you'd wanna sleep with tonight?

598
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:42,270
Choose wisely.
Depending on who you pick,

599
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:43,520
she might let you.

600
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:48,190
-Truth.
-Truth.

601
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,440
Hmm.

602
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:01,410
No. Dare.

603
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:03,630
All right, dare.

604
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:08,550
Hmm. Kiss one of us girls with tongue
for three whole minutes.

605
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:11,260
Oh! French kiss? French kiss!

606
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:13,340
French kiss! French kiss!

607
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:16,050
-French kiss! French kiss!
-Hey.

608
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,560
Ooh!

609
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,520
-Oh, I thought he was angry.
-Oh my gosh.

610
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,690
-Oh!
-Dude.

611
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:47,000
Where… where you going?

612
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,300
Oh, that fucker
already had a girl in mind!

613
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:51,380
-Come on, let's go!
-Wait for us!

614
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:52,470
Follow him!

615
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:03,140
I hope you haven't forgotten
the promise I made you,

616
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:04,850
In-han.

617
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:11,360
In-Han.

618
00:49:17,950 --> 00:49:19,830
I said I'll do whatever it takes

619
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:23,120
to find whoever did that to you.

620
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:28,250
K… K… Kang

621
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:31,460
K… K…

622
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:40,890
The bastard who killed you.

623
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:45,350
Why was there a spot open?

624
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,190
The kid ignored my warnings
and stepped out of line

625
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:51,690
and was killed by Ri-an.

626
00:49:58,530 --> 00:49:59,570
Why are you here?

627
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,580
To expose everything.

628
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:04,250
Everything that asshole did to you.

629
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:06,160
What the hell do you want?

630
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:23,970
I'll expose it…

631
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:25,890
no matter what.
