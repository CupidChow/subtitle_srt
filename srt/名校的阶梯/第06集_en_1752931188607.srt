00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,960
HIERARCHY

2
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,810
Are you proud of yourselves?

3
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,770
I understand that my feelings
mean nothing to you,

4
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,110
but this is not how
you reject someone, Kim Ri-an.

5
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,280
Remember what I said?

6
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,530
About how if you got in my way,
I wouldn't just stand by and let you?

7
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,120
So what are you gonna do?

8
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,210
You'll just have to wait and see,
won't you?

9
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,790
Just know, whatever happens,

10
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm not the one
who threw respect out the window.

11
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,460
Woo-jin,

12
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:01,970
make sure He-ra gets home safe.

13
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,220
What a bitch.

14
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,850
Yoon He-ra.

15
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,180
I should disappear.

16
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,850
It's best that I do.

17
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,120
You won't get away with this!

18
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,160
You two are done! You hear me? Get off me!

19
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,620
I won't take it anymore!

20
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,470
Let go of me!

21
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,430
What are you stopping me for?

22
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,770
Pick a side.

23
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,270
It's me or Jae-i and Ri-an!

24
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:57,110
Which is it? Are you on my side or not!

25
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,310
EPISODE 6
AN ARROW: TO THE HEART

26
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:51,870
What took you so long, honey?

27
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,870
I was worried
that you might've gotten lost.

28
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,080
It may not be the most comfortable,

29
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,920
but this is where we need to stay
for the time being.

30
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,090
But don't be worried.

31
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,720
I made sure that you have
a suite of your own. How's that sound?

32
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,350
I'm gonna go out and pick up some sushi.

33
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,310
Why don't you go get settled?

34
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,140
-Excuse me.
-Yes, sir.

35
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,850
-Would you show her the room?
-Sure.

36
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,650
Oh, and He-ra?

37
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,940
One more thing. I bought you a new dress

38
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,280
so that you can wear it to
your outing this weekend.

39
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,280
Try it on when you get upstairs.

40
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:38,960
Enjoy your stay.

41
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:09,650
I'll buy you
a nicer dress next time. From Dad.

42
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:26,960
You know,
the chef almost moved to another hotel,

43
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,510
but I convinced him to stay.

44
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,470
I know you love the food here.

45
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,930
You should say sorry to Kang Ha.

46
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:51,280
If I had done something
to warrant one, then I would.

47
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,360
Regardless of your intent,

48
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:57,620
you know that you're a big part
of how the school hierarchy works

49
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,370
and why there's so much violence.

50
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,210
Can't you see that?

51
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,210
And that's all my fault?

52
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:07,590
When I think about everything Kang Ha
has gone through, it makes sense.

53
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,720
Why he acts like this.

54
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,340
It's our fault he lost his brother.

55
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,010
So I'd appreciate

56
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,890
if you would give him a sincere apology.

57
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,190
Can you drop it, Jae-i?

58
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:25,100
We're finally having a meal together.

59
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:29,320
I actually feel good and normal
for the first time in a while.

60
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,320
Let's not ruin it.

61
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,860
Apologizing isn't that hard, is it?

62
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,240
I don't know how.

63
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,370
I've never had to do it before, have I?

64
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,170
Anyway…

65
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,840
let's stop this now.

66
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,510
We haven't been with
one another in so long.

67
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,430
So let's just enjoy it, Jae-i.

68
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:26,250
Judging from that expression,
you weren't exactly studying just now.

69
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:30,920
I'm sketching. Yeah.
Just sketching something.

70
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,970
I wanted to tell you,
your dad made up his mind.

71
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,720
Oh, he's gonna run?

72
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,300
And I think he'll be able to do it
with the full support of the Jaeyul Group.

73
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:42,350
The Jaeyul Group? Not Jooshin?

74
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,240
This hasn't gotten out.

75
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,780
What is it?

76
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,200
It's proof that
Jaeyul Group's only daughter

77
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,660
has been seeking pregnancy care abroad.

78
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,600
Kang Ha.

79
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,480
Let's go. They're all waiting.

80
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,570
You have
a dangerous taste in men.

81
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:47,160
What's so interesting to you
about scholarship students, I wonder?

82
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,540
I'm sure you had good intentions,
but things always seem to end so badly.

83
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,300
I heard you're not moving
to the United States anymore.

84
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,510
As your homeroom teacher,
I have to say, that makes me concerned.

85
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:01,430
I just don't want to see Jooshin
engulfed in yet another tragic accident.

86
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,850
You know what, Ms. Han?

87
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:07,350
Whatever my tastes are, they really aren't
that interesting compared to yours.

88
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,490
What, fight back?

89
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,450
We can't keep putting up with
this unfair treatment, can we?

90
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,660
But if you think about it,
is it that unfair?

91
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:33,000
We attend the most expensive school
in the country without paying a dime.

92
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,460
It's a pretty good deal.

93
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,500
Your point?

94
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,130
"Yeah, this is what we deserve."
"Thanks for walking all over us."

95
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,800
Even so, what can we do?

96
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,390
We can prove the abuse.

97
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:47,220
We need to teach them, once and for all,
they're not as untouchable as they think.

98
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,390
The school won't do it,
and neither will the teachers.

99
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,020
Don't expect them to.

100
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,360
Think about the influence
their parents have on Jooshin High.

101
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,230
You really think
the school will take our side?

102
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,650
Maybe you're right,
but I don't understand.

103
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,400
Why are you doing this, Kang Ha?

104
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,820
Aren't you just using us
to avenge your brother?

105
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,030
You're right.

106
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,490
That's how it started.

107
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,450
But now it's more than that.

108
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,370
If we hold back, it's never gonna stop.

109
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,790
Not after we graduate,
not for the rest of our lives.

110
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,290
Are you willing to live like that?

111
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:21,220
No one's ever tried to change anything.

112
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,890
Let's give it a shot.

113
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,970
Before we do this,

114
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,100
we should make sure
we have the same goals.

115
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,690
Because it won't be easy

116
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:37,440
taking on all the rich kids
and the school.

117
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,650
We can't afford to move too fast
unless you want to attack them directly.

118
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:45,360
"Attack directly"?

119
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,030
The school knows everything.

120
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,030
Every single move the students make.

121
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,580
So we need to be careful.

122
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,710
What are you talking about?

123
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,590
All that private information and videos.
Where'd you get all that?

124
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:02,670
JUNG JAE-I

125
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,260
COPYING 2 ITEMS TO USB

126
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,430
I can't tell you yet.

127
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,720
What matters now is that we are both
on the same page with this.

128
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:13,930
We attack the head first

129
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,440
by releasing the video of
Jung Jae-i and Kim Ri-an.

130
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,690
We can use the press or socials.
It'll destroy them instantly.

131
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:21,320
No, we can't.

132
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:23,400
Why the hell not?

133
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:25,400
Don't tell me
you actually like Jung Jae-i?

134
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,540
I need you to tell me if you and I
are in this together…

135
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,580
or not.

136
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,390
She's not answering?

137
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,020
Who'd you think I was calling?

138
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:01,820
He-ra.

139
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,400
She hasn't been in school
or answered my calls the past few days.

140
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,860
Her feelings must've been hurt pretty bad.

141
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:11,200
Ri-an seems relieved
that you guys are back together.

142
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,120
But how do you feel, Jae-i?

143
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:15,540
Yeah, um,

144
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,330
do I really need to answer that?

145
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,080
I just want you to make things clear.

146
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:23,460
We've all been struggling…
because of your decisions.

147
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,460
You all?

148
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,390
Ri-an, He-ra,

149
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,560
and me too.

150
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,520
If you hadn't pushed Ri-an away
and gone after that scholarship kid, then

151
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,400
He-ra wouldn't have confessed to Ri-an.

152
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,200
Then you two wouldn't have had
any issues, and then…

153
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,450
…I wouldn't be so…
fucking heartbroken now.

154
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,880
-Wow!
-Oh! Nice one!

155
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,010
-Good, right?
-Real good.

156
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:11,180
Hurry, hurry, hurry. Woo-jin…

157
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:15,760
Come on. Get over here.

158
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,680
You're not getting off easy.

159
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:18,850
I mean it.

160
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:21,520
No! Wait a second! Wait a second!
Hold on, hold on.

161
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,310
Ah!

162
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,150
-My turn.
-Oh, come on! Why does he get a turn?

163
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,280
-Those are the rules!
-Why? Ugh!

164
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,150
-Ah!
-You went easy on him!

165
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,080
So you're blaming me for everything, then?

166
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,590
I'm not blaming.

167
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,710
I'm just concerned.

168
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,010
I'm worried it'll amount to nothing.

169
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,640
All the time we spent together.

170
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,470
I'm scared it'll crumble

171
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,350
and fade away.

172
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,360
I want you to try and make sure
that doesn't happen.

173
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:07,900
Hmm?

174
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:14,280
All this time I… I never left
Ri-an's side, not even once.

175
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,750
I only made it seem that way
to make sure he was okay.

176
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,960
I thought it was
the best thing I could do,

177
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,630
and you know what?

178
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,590
I still think I was right.

179
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,380
Honestly, I don't deserve him.

180
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:44,440
I'll do it. I'll try my best.

181
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,560
I wanna protect us.
I want it as much as you do.

182
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:49,900
I'll try.

183
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:52,950
I'll do whatever I can.

184
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,200
And you should too.

185
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,330
You should be clear what side you're on.

186
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,250
He-ra's? Or maybe

187
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:05,750
the woman with the Hermès bag?

188
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,920
When your heart decides, who will it be?

189
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,110
LEE WOO-JIN

190
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,670
Wow, it feels like my birthday!

191
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,300
I must've reread your DM, like, ten times.

192
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,960
I can't believe I'm on a date with you.

193
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,840
Thanks for keeping your promise, Noona.

194
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,680
I don't even wanna blink! Who knows
the next time I'll get this opportunity?

195
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,220
So I'm gonna enjoy everything
while I still can.

196
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,180
You really like me that much?

197
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:08,150
Everyone thinks I'm a nasty snob.
They call me a bitch behind my back.

198
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,480
But that's part of your charm.

199
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,440
Hey, don't ever
let bitches become your type.

200
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,150
You're in for a life of pain.

201
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:15,690
Oh? Is that He-ra?

202
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,070
What brings you here?

203
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,200
I've actually
been meaning to talk to you.

204
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,330
You have?

205
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,410
As you know, my sister's
move to New York fell through.

206
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,920
So I thought that this would be
the absolute perfect moment

207
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,750
to pass a little something on to you.

208
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,170
What is it?

209
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,420
Oh, you know,

210
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,880
just my ace in the hole.

211
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:39,010
The ultimate card I have to play.

212
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,930
Take a look at this.

213
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:48,310
When you see it for yourself,
I think you'll agree.

214
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,190
It's all yours.

215
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:06,870
Jae-hyeok.

216
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:07,910
Yeah?

217
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,210
Watch it all?

218
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:15,000
Hmm?

219
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,460
Great, isn't it?

220
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,600
You fucking asshole.

221
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,350
I knew you sucked,
but you're an evil piece of shit, huh?

222
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,360
This really crosses the line.

223
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,020
Noona!

224
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,200
I did you a favor
since we have so much in common.

225
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,700
This is how you pay me back?
With a slap in the face?

226
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,290
Look, I admit that I am a bitch,

227
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,330
but I'm a bitch with morals,

228
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:53,380
and I think the comparison
to a scumbag monster like you

229
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,460
is a bit unfair.

230
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,960
Don't you think?

231
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,720
You crazy bitch! Seriously?

232
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,600
I mean, wow!
I can't fucking believe this shit!

233
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,390
Jung Jae-i, you idiot.

234
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,610
Is this the shit you were putting up with?

235
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,270
From that little creep?

236
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,340
Okay, ma'am. I'll leave these here.

237
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:43,130
You're always such a help, dear.

238
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,470
Wait right there.

239
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:47,680
-Ta-da!
-Oh wow!

240
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,810
You don't have to thank me.
I get paid for this, remember?

241
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,140
See ya. Have a great day.

242
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,940
My goodness.
What a sweet young man.

243
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,200
Take that! Get him, get him!

244
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,700
Hyung! Hyung!

245
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,740
-I got him, you guys!
-Hey! Gimme that that thing! Huh?

246
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,830
-I told you to be careful, didn't I?
-Hyung! Hyung!

247
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,960
You'd all be dead meat
if I didn't have an ice cream.

248
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,580
-Look at you.
-Your clothes are all wet!

249
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:19,340
Are you laughing at me now?
Oh, so it's a challenge, huh?

250
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,510
-Hey, hey! Hey!
-Hyung! Hyung!

251
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,010
You're dead!

252
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:25,510
-Hey!
-Get him! Get him! Don't stop!

253
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,800
-Hey, I surrender, I surrender! Mercy!
-You get back here!

254
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:30,720
-You can't get away from us!
-Hey, hey, stop, stop, stop!

255
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:32,600
-Look over there!
-Where are you going?

256
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,890
Hey, guys, wait for me! Wait for me!

257
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:37,850
Hello, Kang Ha.

258
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:51,030
Go on, try it. It's really good.

259
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,250
Ah! The weather's great.

260
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,170
The breeze is nice,
and the clouds are pretty too.

261
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:06,930
It's almost unreal.

262
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,510
Hmm?

263
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,390
How are you so happy all the time?

264
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:14,100
To me, the weather looks
exactly the same as it did yesterday,

265
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,270
but you think it's great.

266
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,350
You get into water gunfights

267
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,730
and have fun like a child.

268
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,030
It's like I never let myself
feel that way before.

269
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,580
I'm always on guard and anxious,

270
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:36,870
which is crazy because I have
so much more than you.

271
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,710
How do you find joy in such simple things?

272
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,130
Hmm.

273
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:47,050
On our way home from tutoring,

274
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:49,550
In-han and I would stop for tteokbokki.

275
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,060
An old lady ran the place.
We'd help her carry stuff.

276
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:58,230
And every time, the lady would
buy us both an ice cream cone.

277
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,060
It's the little stuff like that.

278
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,980
Going to the arcade and playing games.

279
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:08,030
Eating ice cream
out on the streets on a nice day.

280
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,820
Running to catch the bus
and snagging an empty seat.

281
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:13,990
I just love things like that.

282
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:17,200
I envy you.

283
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,120
You must have them too.

284
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:24,000
It might not be the breeze or the clouds,

285
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:27,710
but you have things you like,
things that bring you joy.

286
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,680
Find them

287
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,760
and protect them.

288
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:41,270
In my experience, if something
gets between you and those things,

289
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:44,360
it's better to face it head-on
than to try to run and hide.

290
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,030
Even if there's a risk of getting hurt,
try to fight back.

291
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,820
Nothing could be more worthwhile

292
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,160
than protecting the things you like.

293
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:00,710
I just wish you could be happy, Jae-i.

294
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,210
You never know.
You might like a water gunfight.

295
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,650
So what is it?

296
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:34,200
The thing you came out here to tell me.

297
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,080
I want you to tell me
what you're planning.

298
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,960
You said you'd… expose
what happened to In-han.

299
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,130
The person blackmailing you… I found them.

300
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:54,050
What do they want?

301
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:55,640
The same thing I do.

302
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:59,350
The chance to expose the guilty.

303
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,890
Expose everyone
behind the crimes at Jooshin

304
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,100
and to make sure they
pay the price for it.

305
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,610
I plan to join forces with them.

306
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,440
Now I have a bow ready to shoot.

307
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:15,820
And pretty soon, I'm going to
notch an arrow and draw it back.

308
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,620
But when I fire it,

309
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:20,830
I don't want that arrow hurting you.

310
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,750
I'll make sure they don't
threaten you ever again.

311
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:29,170
I can do both. I can protect you and hold
the people who killed In-han responsible.

312
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,840
I told you once before.

313
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:42,060
If there's anything in my life
that's worth protecting, it's Ri-an

314
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,770
and Ri-an alone.

315
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:48,860
So, if you're planning on aiming
that bow at him, look before you shoot.

316
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:51,190
Because that's where I'll be…

317
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,530
standing in your way.

318
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:03,660
Well, I guess that means…

319
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,210
we're enemies now.

320
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:36,280
I'm dating Jae-i. Of the Jaeyul Group.

321
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:38,860
Have been for a while now,

322
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:41,160
and I thought it was time
that you knew about it.

323
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:45,290
There isn't a privilege in the world
without responsibilities, Ri-an.

324
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:48,750
Considering the difficult path
ahead for you as my sole heir,

325
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:51,920
why preoccupy yourself
with such trivial matters?

326
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,500
I'm not interested
in living like you and Dad.

327
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,510
I have no interest in a loveless marriage,

328
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:01,140
exchanging empty pleasantries with
the other person once or twice a year.

329
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,810
I'm going to date someone
that I really care about.

330
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:05,140
I'm going to be happy.

331
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,980
"Someone you care about"?

332
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,520
I understand.

333
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:13,020
That seems so important
for someone your age.

334
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:16,360
But soon, Ri-an, you'll see that feeling
for what it really is.

335
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,950
Emotional trickery and childishness.
Nothing could be more trivial.

336
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:22,280
I don't really care about
what you have to say about it.

337
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:23,580
I can't live without her.

338
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:27,660
I think I've made myself clear.

339
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,830
You kept ignoring my calls.
I couldn't reach you.

340
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,500
It was frustrating.

341
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:17,920
I couldn't stand waiting. I had to come.

342
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:26,220
I went and got the car fixed. You see?

343
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,520
Like new, isn't it?

344
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:48,080
The car did seem fixed.

345
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:50,580
I couldn't find that thing.

346
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,250
I got rid of it already.

347
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,250
It could've put us in real danger.

348
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,630
That car--

349
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,930
I don't know what's gotten into me either.

350
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:07,550
I thought maybe you were avoiding me.

351
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:11,140
My feelings were all over the place.

352
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,640
I didn't know what to do.

353
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:16,230
I thought we agreed
that whatever was between us…

354
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,860
we would never share any emotions
that would get in the way.

355
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,050
I know this isn't love.

356
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,180
And I know that I can never have you.

357
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,970
But I'm still human, aren't I?

358
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,470
I have feelings.

359
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:50,430
No matter how hurt your feelings are…

360
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:55,060
that car isn't something
you can just take out.

361
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,900
-Remember?
-Of course.

362
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,110
How could I forget?

363
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:03,780
That car represents a secret
that neither of us want getting out.

364
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:13,330
It's He-ra, isn't it?

365
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,250
The woman in Lee Woo-jin's heart.

366
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,790
Let's not imagine things.

367
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,590
That gets us nowhere.

368
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,300
Leave the keys.

369
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,600
Why? Worried I might use it for blackmail?

370
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,020
It's not about that.

371
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,730
It's dangerous for you.

372
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:44,610
Maybe so, but it's the only thing
protecting me right now.

373
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,450
If you're worried about protection,

374
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,200
forget the car.

375
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,790
I'm your best shot at safety.

376
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,050
Maybe what we had wasn't love…

377
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,130
but at least it wasn't all a lie.

378
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,300
When I needed someone, you supported me.

379
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,770
But now that's over.

380
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,440
Let's end things here.

381
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:36,410
Very well.

382
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:38,580
See you at school.

383
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:08,320
Eyes, heart, head, neck.

384
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,820
Aim for a spot
that will kill it instantly.

385
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:16,580
When you see its blood spurting,
you'll know you hit true.

386
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,290
With one flick of your hand,

387
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,920
that little rabbit will be
transformed into red mist.

388
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,130
The thrill of the hunt.

389
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:30,920
That's how you'll grow strong.

390
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:38,680
What are you waiting for?
Pull the trigger.

391
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,730
Jae-i.

392
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:44,850
Keep your eyes open.

393
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:49,400
Why aren't you shooting?
End that thing's life this instant.

394
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,280
Shoot. Now!

395
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:02,620
Jung Jae-i.

396
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:04,040
I don't wanna shoot it.

397
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,460
I don't wanna murder anything.

398
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,840
I'm not coming here anymore.

399
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,090
I hate hunting,

400
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,430
your endless demands, all of it.

401
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,220
So it's rebellion, is it?

402
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:22,640
You're saying you intend
to disobey my commands

403
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:23,980
and do as you please.

404
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,310
Is that it?

405
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,980
You only see your daughter,
Jung Jae-i of Jaeyul Group.

406
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:30,020
But underneath, I'm just me.

407
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,570
And that gives me a right.

408
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,320
The right to be true to myself
and protect what I care about.

409
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:36,530
Oh, no.

410
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,240
That's not something you get to decide.

411
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:42,700
I gave you that name myself.

412
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:45,040
My blood runs through your veins.

413
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:49,250
What right could possibly exist

414
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,170
that allows you to give those up?

415
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:58,510
As long as you bear my name,

416
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:00,810
as long as you carry my blood,

417
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:02,640
you decide nothing for yourself.

418
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:07,100
That is your duty and your obligation.

419
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,940
The debt you owe for your life.

420
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:12,980
Your everything.

421
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:17,990
From beginning to end,
you're a part of me.

422
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:19,410
You're my creation.

423
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:47,850
The dynamics of East Asian
international relations were

424
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:50,860
underrepresented
in Eurocentric international law.

425
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:54,320
But the law was evolving over time.

426
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:58,360
But when you see the circumstances
of the political situation,

427
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:00,990
then you will understand
how we changed it.

428
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:02,700
So when you see this paper…

429
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:07,580
…a new branch
of international law has been…

430
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,420
Uh…

431
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,590
Find out who filmed it.

432
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:18,840
Whoever dared to send that to me,
I want you to find out where it came from.

433
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:21,300
-We'll handle it as soon as possible.
-No leaks.

434
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:23,390
Do whatever it takes to keep it contained.

435
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:26,020
This video cannot be seen by anybody.

436
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:29,560
No one finds out. Not the school,
and especially not my mother.

437
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:34,440
Everyone's jobs are on the line,
so keep it from getting out, understand?

438
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:47,500
TRADING FIRM INTERNATIONAL YOON
FACING BANKRUPTCY

439
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:53,630
Did you see this?
Is this for real?

440
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:56,750
It says He-ra's family is bankrupt,
and they're going under.

441
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,130
-Damn.
-What's gonna happen to her now?

442
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,340
Rejected by Ri-an. Enemies with Jae-i.

443
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:04,010
If her family is broke,
our Queen He-ra is done for.

444
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,010
What? Queen He-ra, my ass!

445
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,140
After all the shit she's pulled
at this school?

446
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,600
You bet your ass she's finished!

447
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:21,530
I'm taking attendance now.
Sit down, everyone.

448
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,000
Come with me.

449
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,340
There's something I need to tell you.

450
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,800
What is it?

451
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,180
Last year at the villa,

452
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,890
someone filmed us there.

453
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,310
But don't worry about it.

454
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:51,520
I'm gonna deal with everything. I promise.

455
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,390
Who sent you the video?

456
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,600
I'm finding out.

457
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:56,770
Just stay by my side, Jae-i.

458
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,070
We'll get through this.

459
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,440
Don't run away again.

460
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:00,990
Let me protect you.

461
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:12,370
I'm willing
to give you one last chance.

462
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:16,040
You know better than anyone
what's been going on here at Jooshin High.

463
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:20,250
Follow your own regulations…
and punish the students responsible.

464
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,670
I am giving you one final opportunity

465
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,930
to bring this school
back to its original mission.

466
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:29,560
And where do you get this confidence?

467
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:32,390
Simple.

468
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:36,560
You see, I have a secret weapon
that could blow Jooshin away.

469
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:40,440
What's that?

470
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,690
If you continue to enable abuse,

471
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:45,150
you'll leave us no choice.

472
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:47,620
We'll blow it all up in your face.

473
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,340
Are you crazy? Why the fuck
did you meet with the principal

474
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,710
without telling me about it?

475
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,090
I'm going to do this right.

476
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,800
If you wanna do this right,
we should hit Kim Ri-an, like I said.

477
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,550
You said start at the top.

478
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,510
All the adults who let this happen,

479
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,770
they're at the top.

480
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:14,560
Is this why you wanted to team up?

481
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,020
What are you actually
trying to get from me?

482
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,440
Don't tell me.

483
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,610
You're doing this to protect Jung Jae-i?

484
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:27,280
Nam Ju-won, what are you talking about?

485
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,700
Uh-huh, I'm right, aren't I?
It is for her!

486
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,700
Do you know
what kind of secrets she's hiding?

487
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,910
You haven't seen everything yet.
If you only knew what--

488
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,040
It was you.

489
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,300
The blackmailer.

490
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,690
So that's it.
You've drawn your bow, haven't you?

491
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,530
I told you I'd make them
suffer the consequences.

492
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:07,740
I'm gonna tell my father,
and I'll tell the school.

493
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:10,530
I'll tell them a video like that exists,

494
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:13,080
and there are people
threatening to release it to the world.

495
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:16,250
If I tell them myself,
I can still get ahead of it.

496
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:18,660
No. Why would you?
If you do that, you'll--

497
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,460
My dad would kill me, for a start.

498
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,630
He'd drag me away and hide me in New York.

499
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,250
But even so,

500
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,720
at least they'll be able to stop it.

501
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,760
My dad and the school,

502
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,350
they'll do whatever it takes
to make sure that video never gets out.

503
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:35,220
It's what they do.

504
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:38,810
Then what? Suffer the consequences alone?
Take it all on yourself?

505
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:40,730
What happens to me doesn't matter.

506
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:43,810
As long as I can protect Ri-an.

507
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:48,740
Why?

508
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,240
He's everything.

509
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,620
Exactly! Why?

510
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,700
Why is your everything…

511
00:38:58,330 --> 00:38:59,710
…somebody like him?

512
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,840
Because no matter what,

513
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:08,550
he feels the same way.

514
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:11,010
That's how we grew up.

515
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:13,510
Relying on each other to survive.

516
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,140
If Ri-an falls apart, then so will I.

517
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,480
Well, go ahead, then.

518
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:22,850
But I won't give up.

519
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:27,730
Whether or not you protect Kim Ri-an,
whether or not we all die…

520
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:31,200
I'm going to see this through.

521
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,330
I was pregnant.

522
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,500
Don't turn around.

523
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,710
Just stand and listen.

524
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:54,640
I was scared.

525
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,810
I was scared of my father,
that he'd cast me out like my mom.

526
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:04,100
Afraid that I'd lose
everything I had overnight

527
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,690
and be kicked out of my home.

528
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:09,610
So I went to the United States
to take care of it.

529
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,990
But I couldn't do it.

530
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:20,700
I turned back from the hospital twice.

531
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:23,160
I couldn't figure out what to do.

532
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,580
But then, one day…

533
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,340
I was in so much pain.

534
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,880
I guess it must have known
what I was trying to do.

535
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,470
And so, as fast as it came,

536
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:41,560
it was suddenly gone.

537
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:53,650
And Kim Ri-an?

538
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,320
Does he…

539
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,080
He doesn't.

540
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:07,290
So I…

541
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:11,050
did my best to avoid him.

542
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,930
I couldn't bear to look at Ri-an
and pretend like nothing happened.

543
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:20,510
I told myself, "It's better this way.
Now, things can go back to normal."

544
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,430
That's why I went to the States
in the first place.

545
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:27,770
I really believed
if I just broke up with Ri-an,

546
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:30,310
then I could be free of it all.

547
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,860
And maybe I could've.

548
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,660
Then you showed up and ruined it all.

549
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,500
Yes, you, Kang Ha.

550
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:48,460
You told me to face my fears
instead of running away.

551
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,090
You dug up memories I thought I'd buried.

552
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,130
Awoke a feeling I didn't know I had.

553
00:41:58,090 --> 00:41:58,970
It was you.

554
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:19,740
In fact, from now on…

555
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:23,830
I'll do exactly what you told me to.

556
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:28,290
You're gonna fight back?

557
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:30,710
I'm going to protect the things I like.

558
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:34,250
So, if you need to draw your bow,
go ahead and shoot.

559
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,380
And when you do,
I'll happily stand in your way.

560
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,520
There you are.

561
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,030
How long have you been staying here?

562
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:44,110
You should've told us
things were this bad.

563
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:46,620
Sorry, "us?" Who does that mean?

564
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,120
Kim Ri-an and Jung Jae-i?

565
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,080
Or people like Woo-jin
who refuse to take a side?

566
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,460
Who is this "us" you're referring to?

567
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:56,920
We should at least get you out of here.
I'll find a solution.

568
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,590
You can come with me to my studio for now.

569
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:01,840
What are you? My knight in shining armor?

570
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,390
You're making things worse.
I already feel like trash as it is.

571
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:06,600
-He-ra.
-I'm gonna drop out.

572
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,180
I don't have a place here anymore.

573
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:11,310
Let's just say goodbye
and be done with it.

574
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:13,640
There's no reason for us to stay friends.

575
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:15,230
Hey, what are you talking about?

576
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:16,730
I'm so sick of all of you.

577
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:18,940
Especially Jae-i, for letting herself be--

578
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,280
There's no point explaining it to you.

579
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:29,160
So it's because of us?
We're the reason you're leaving school?

580
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:31,580
I just don't wanna see you guys anymore.

581
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:33,160
Then you're still upset.

582
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:35,250
Well, yeah! How do you think I feel, then?

583
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,880
After all the things that Jung Jae-i did.

584
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,130
That stupid bitch.

585
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:45,680
How could my supposed "best friend"
tell me nothing?

586
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,980
You said to pick a side?

587
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,770
I choose yours, Yoon He-ra.

588
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:03,860
So what?

589
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:06,450
You've chosen,
so then what's in it for me?

590
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,160
Vengeance.

591
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,330
Don't drop out.

592
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,290
I'll take care of it.

593
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:02,170
APPLICATION TO WITHDRAW ENROLLMENT

594
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:04,550
NAME: YOON HE-RA

595
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:06,510
REASON FOR WITHDRAWAL

596
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,350
So that's it? You're running away?

597
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,350
You always make things so extreme.

598
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:19,060
What exactly are you planning to do
after dropping out?

599
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:21,020
God, you guys are so annoying.

600
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:24,980
Is it your turn to bother me now, Jae-i?

601
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:26,530
Take care of yourself first!

602
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:31,070
Jung Jae-i, do you know
what kind of place Jooshin is?

603
00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:33,240
What do you mean?

604
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:35,040
It's a jungle.

605
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:38,660
The kind of place where if you let your
guard down for a second, you get eaten.

606
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:42,670
But there's still one thing
everyone here can agree on.

607
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:46,130
That this school should be a living hell
for anyone too poor or underprivileged.

608
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,920
Isn't that why we look down
on the scholarship students

609
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:50,630
and treat them like they're invisible?

610
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:52,680
Am I wrong?

611
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:55,890
Do you really expect me
to end up like them?

612
00:46:56,850 --> 00:46:58,060
That's not what I said.

613
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:00,890
Well, whatever you meant, forget me.
Worry about yourself.

614
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:02,480
Don't you have bigger fish to fry?

615
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:04,820
What are you trying to say?

616
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:10,360
You've never told me anything
about your own life either!

617
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:12,610
So what gives you
the right to dictate mine?

618
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:18,540
Jung Jae-i, did you ever even
once consider me as your friend?

619
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,810
Hey, it's Yoon He-ra.

620
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,270
-Look.
-Didn't her family go bankrupt?

621
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:47,570
You idiot.

622
00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:50,320
"Idiot"?

623
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,700
That's a bit aggressive
for "good morning," don't you think?

624
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:54,240
Well, it's an insult.

625
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:57,370
What kind of idiot
can't even protect his own girlfriend?

626
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,200
I'm sorry?

627
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:04,500
The recording? The vacation house?

628
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,250
Gee, I wonder who had the chance
to film you guys there.

629
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:12,840
What did you say? Who told you that?

630
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:14,590
It's Jae-i's vacation house.

631
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:18,140
Who's the one other person
who would've been there besides you guys?

632
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:20,350
I hate that class so much, dude.

633
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:22,430
-Get out of the way.
-Beat it, kids.

634
00:48:37,370 --> 00:48:39,620
Hey! Everyone except Jae-hyeok, out!

635
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:40,580
Hey, get out!

636
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:42,870
-Get lost!
-Let's go! Move it, move it!

637
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,620
Hey, you heard him. Get out!

638
00:48:58,550 --> 00:49:00,930
You little piece of shit.

639
00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:02,520
What the hell were you filming us for?

640
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,770
What the fuck were you planning, huh?

641
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:07,600
Oh shit! Yoon He-ra, you bitch.

642
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:11,150
Oh, Ri-an, you got it all wrong.

643
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:17,820
They're just having a conversation.

644
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:20,780
-Get lost, you little pricks!
-What the hell is going on?

645
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:22,700
Wow, this is crazy.

646
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:23,950
Just be quiet.

647
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:49,100
You piece of shit!

648
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:52,690
Do you have any idea
what the hell you've done?

649
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:55,030
Shit.

650
00:49:58,070 --> 00:49:59,110
You fucking…

651
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:05,620
Ri-an! Are you crazy?

652
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,210
-Hey! You get back here!
-Cut it out, man!

653
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:10,290
Goddammit! Get your filthy hands off me!

654
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:12,500
You fucking scholarship trash.

655
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:16,760
-Move.
-Stop it.

656
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:19,260
-Move!
-I said, stop!

657
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:20,510
Damn it!

658
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:26,930
Get outta here
before I kill you too, okay?

659
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,270
-Just cut it out.
-Son of a bitch!

660
00:50:29,350 --> 00:50:30,900
Think before you act!

661
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:34,150
How do you think Jae-i would feel
if she found out you were beating people?

662
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:39,780
How dare you.

663
00:50:41,490 --> 00:50:43,280
How dare you speak her name.

664
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:45,290
You're so pathetic.

665
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:47,370
What?

666
00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:50,500
You have no idea
what Jae-i is going through, do you?

667
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:51,830
All because of you!

668
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:57,050
What she's going through,
or what she's prepared to suffer.

669
00:50:58,470 --> 00:51:00,340
What are you trying to say, huh?

670
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:01,760
And worst of all,

671
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:04,640
she's dealing with it all alone.

672
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,180
Tell me now!

673
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:08,600
Tell me!

674
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:11,940
I'm asking you to tell me
what you're talking about.

675
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:13,730
Hey.

676
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:15,730
Answer me.

677
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,030
What the fuck don't I know about?

678
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:20,780
You protect her from now on.

679
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:24,410
Make sure she doesn't go through it alone.

680
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:34,170
-Hey, give me the ball.
-Pass, pass.

681
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:35,130
Come on, pass.

682
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,000
Come on, tell me.

683
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,800
You can't get this.
Just try. Try to get it.

684
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:47,140
Hey, the bus is here.

685
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,220
Hey, hey, let's go, let's go, let's go.

686
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:52,940
-Hey!
-Hey, you get on first.

687
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:21,460
This is a nice dress.

688
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:26,140
What is this? A victory lap?

689
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:29,010
Are you here to congratulate yourself
on how low I've sunk?

690
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:32,850
I'm not here for any of that.

691
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:36,940
I just wanted to set the record straight.

692
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:43,990
Never… have I thought of you
as anything but a friend.

693
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:48,950
You've always been my best friend

694
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:50,740
from the first time we hung out

695
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:53,250
until right now.

696
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:05,840
What's this, all of a sudden?

697
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:13,390
-Hey, Dad.
-He-ra!

698
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:16,230
It's over.
Everything's going to be all right.

699
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:18,060
The company! We can keep it afloat!

700
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:22,030
-Is this for real?
-Of course. As real as anything!

701
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:24,490
The Jaeyul Group
came through for us after all.

702
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:26,320
There's nothing to worry about.

703
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,910
See you soon, darling. I love you.

704
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Did you do this?

705
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:38,880
Like I said,

706
00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:42,750
I've never thought of you as anything
but my best friend.

707
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:48,340
Jung Jae-i.

708
00:53:51,890 --> 00:53:52,930
Pregnant?

709
00:53:57,390 --> 00:53:58,400
You…

710
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:03,070
You must be trying your hardest
to drive me completely insane!

711
00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:06,820
How is it possible the daughter I raised
bears such a chilling resemblance

712
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:08,070
to her mother?

713
00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:13,450
I'm not waiting for the rumors to start.
You're leaving for New York immediately.

714
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:20,420
Answer.

715
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:22,290
I'll go.

716
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,250
On one condition.

717
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:27,010
He-ra's father's company,
International Yoon,

718
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:28,510
I want you to help them.

719
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,430
He-ra's my best friend in the world.

720
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:34,010
I don't think you're in any position
to make demands.

721
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:38,440
Furthermore, give me one good reason
why I should do what you're asking.

722
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:42,230
I'll do what you want.
I'll go to New York without complaining.

723
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:46,190
After all, I'm the link between
Jaeyul and the Gongseong Group.

724
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:48,070
I'll play along.

725
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,540
I'm going to New York.

726
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,830
Come visit. I'll take you out to eat.

727
00:55:36,370 --> 00:55:37,910
Can we stop for a second?

728
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:02,480
How could you keep that from me?

729
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:04,350
How could you?

730
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:09,650
How could you bear it all alone?

731
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:13,950
So you…

732
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:17,620
you found out.

733
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:20,830
How do you expect me to live
with the guilt of leaving you alone?

734
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:23,160
The guilt of not being there by your side!

735
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:27,290
How?

736
00:56:30,510 --> 00:56:33,300
How, Jae-i? How can I forgive myself?

737
00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:42,350
No matter how I try to run away,

738
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:45,480
it feels like I can't.

739
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:48,110
Why, Jae-i? Why are you running away?

740
00:56:52,190 --> 00:56:54,200
I'm here.
I'm right by your side, aren't I?

741
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:04,080
I never wanted you to get hurt, so…

742
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:09,000
I did my best to shield you from it.

743
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:14,720
I just get so sad
when I look at you that I…

744
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,010
I couldn't bear it
if you looked that way at me.

745
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:23,730
I thought if I ran away,
I could escape it.

746
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,480
But of course…

747
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:31,940
here we are now.

748
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:43,200
You must have been so afraid.

749
00:57:43,830 --> 00:57:46,080
How could you go through that all alone?

750
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,000
I'm sorry.

751
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:53,300
I'm just so sorry for everything, Jae-i.

752
00:58:00,850 --> 00:58:01,930
Can you ever forgive me?

753
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:06,810
I swear, I won't let you go through
anything like that alone ever again.

754
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:08,230
Never again.

755
00:58:09,350 --> 00:58:11,560
I won't let you go ever again.

756
00:58:50,310 --> 00:58:51,770

#VIDEO OF 4TH GENERATION CHAEBOLS

759
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:00,410
SHARE

760
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:09,660
If I knew you'd
weaponize something like this,

761
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:11,670
I never would've joined you.

762
00:59:12,290 --> 00:59:13,630
You have countless videos

763
00:59:13,710 --> 00:59:16,800
of Kim Ri-an and Choi Yun-seok
attacking so many people with their gang.

764
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:21,010
Shouldn't those videos
be more than enough?

765
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:24,050
Roughhousing?

766
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:26,140
That's not a scandal.

767
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:29,480
If it's not a scandal,
it doesn't do any damage.

768
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,020
Give me my phone back.

769
00:59:32,230 --> 00:59:33,060
I can't.

770
00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:37,320
Jung Jae-i knows who I am already.

771
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:40,780
Do you wanna play fair?
We can't win against them by playing fair.

772
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:43,110
We need to destroy them.

773
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,660
Kim Ri-an, Jung Jae-i.

774
00:59:45,830 --> 00:59:47,740
Before they destroy me for this.

775
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:51,710
Give it back. Give it back!

776
00:59:51,790 --> 00:59:53,830
This isn't how we win, Nam Ju-won!

777
00:59:54,790 --> 00:59:58,170
We're trying to get justice for everyone,
not destroy somebody's life!

778
00:59:58,760 --> 00:59:59,800
You bastard!

779
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:01,970
You're still protecting Jung Jae-i?

780
01:00:02,550 --> 01:00:04,720
Yeah? Snap out of it!

781
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,810
Have you forgotten why you're here?
Your brother, Kang In-han!

782
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:14,440
Have you forgotten
what they did to your brother?

783
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:43,300
Ri-an?

784
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:48,100
These tears,

785
01:00:49,930 --> 01:00:51,600
they won't stop, Woo-jin.

786
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:56,350
I really just wish I could stop crying.

787
01:01:02,070 --> 01:01:03,150
And I can't.

788
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:11,990
So, Mr. Woo-jin…

789
01:01:16,830 --> 01:01:19,880
…what is it that you want from me
in exchange for this?

790
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:27,220
Jae-i.

791
01:01:28,510 --> 01:01:29,890
Send her to New York.

792
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,350
Just make her leave.

793
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:38,100
Make sure…

794
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:41,860
that she never comes back.

795
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:48,870
I hope you'll do this for me.

796
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:50,950
Because if you don't,

797
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:54,620
I'm afraid you'll see the story
of your eldest daughter's pregnancy…

798
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:57,960
all over South Korea.
