00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,960
HIERARCHY

2
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,160
Woo-jin.

3
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,410
You didn't have to come.

4
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,540
It's your first birthday
since we've been together.

5
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,710
I wanted a proper celebration so…

6
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:47,920
How so?

7
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,710
Your present.

8
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,670
I'll need more than that.

9
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,060
Here's your second present.

10
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:07,600
Don't be late.

11
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,920
M… Ms. Han?

12
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,800
In-han?

13
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,550
What are you--

14
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:41,340
In-han. It's not like that.

15
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:43,890
Just leave him.
I'll have the guys handle it.

16
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,720
Don't do that. No one can know about this.

17
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,640
In-han!

18
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:48,850
In-han!

19
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,020
No.

20
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:04,780
Woo-jin, hey.
You seen that scholarship kid?

21
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,790
He ran off
right when things were getting fun.

22
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,540
-Where'd he go?
-Hey!

23
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,210
Let's take it easy.

24
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:12,540
It's fun and games till someone gets hurt.

25
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,880
Well? Go back in.

26
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,010
Let's go back.

27
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,800
-Why you so mad, bro?
-The roof.

28
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,760
Or the back.
Let's check out the back.

29
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,220
Just leave him.

30
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,680
He's a scholarship kid.
Why are you chasing that guy?

31
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:30,940
He's my friend.

32
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:31,940
Were you crying?

33
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,190
Why do you look like that?

34
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,770
It's nothing. I'm… I'm good.

35
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,650
No, it's obviously not nothing.
What's going on?

36
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,360
You don't know
what my dad is like.

37
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,120
-We'll figure something out.
-Wait.

38
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,960
I'll talk to the guys
and tell them to get off his back.

39
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,460
Why don't we just go inside?

40
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:01,510
In-han!

41
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,090
In-han!

42
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,350
Kang. Kang Ha. Kang Ha.

43
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,020
LITTLE BROTHER

44
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,540
In-han, listen to me! Huh? In-han!

45
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,590
In-han!

46
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,610
MS. HAN JI-SU

47
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,900
In-han, let's just talk about it.

48
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,150
-You're crazy.
-Where are you?

49
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,280
-You're all crazy!
-Let's talk face-to-face.

50
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,240
…students, the entire school
are all completely deranged.

51
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,540
In-han, hear me out.
Let's talk about this.

52
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,750
-Stop it! Leave me alone.
-Just tell me where you are.

53
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:16,620
-Why are you doing this to me?
-Let's talk face-to-face.

54
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,250
In-han, please listen to me!

55
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:19,840
I don't care!

56
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,590
Come on, In-han!

57
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,840
-I'll expose everything that's going on!
-Let's talk. I'm your teacher.

58
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,480
Hello? Wait. What… what was that?

59
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,360
-What happened, what happened?
-Kang…

60
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,900
-Answer me.
-Kang Ha.

61
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,160
-In-han!
-Kang Ha.

62
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,990
Answer me! Where are you right now? Shit.

63
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,990
Okay. Hold on, hold on. Okay?
Hold on. I'll call you right back, okay?

64
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,000
I'll call you right back!

65
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:21,560
In-han…

66
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,370
In-han?

67
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,370
In-han?

68
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:59,000
EPISODE 7. SPRING TIME:
OUR SHORT, VULNERABLE YET PRECIOUS CHAPTER

69
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:04,630
SEOUL YONGHO POLICE STATION

70
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,680
Bullying?

71
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,060
My friends and I are at the level

72
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,770
where we wouldn't put ourselves
in that situation.

73
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,360
We don't have a need to bully anyone.

74
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,440
I actually find all of this rather rude.

75
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,650
What evidence says
I did anything wrong in this school?

76
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:36,450
Attorney Kim, don't we, you know,
have the right not to answer?

77
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,780
Those drugs were prescribed
by a medical professional.

78
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:40,910
He suffers from anxiety.

79
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,960
If you don't believe me,
test my hair.

80
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,170
Look, I just said I didn't do it, bro!

81
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,460
I'm not a bully!

82
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,920
I never
laid a finger on that kid.

83
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,300
I was just showing off magic tricks.
That's all, you know?

84
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,720
I was just…

85
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,050
I was just trying to be
the best upperclassman that I could

86
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,180
and help him survive through school.

87
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,930
No one ever put me up to anything.

88
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:03,060
I don't know.

89
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,440
We'd just attend some parties

90
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,860
but never bullied or done drugs.

91
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,020
No drugs either.

92
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,360
We're good students.

93
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,990
We weren't involved in any of that.

94
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,320
We were involved.

95
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:20,200
And I take responsibility
for my part in all of it.

96
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,250
You have some nerve.

97
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:35,800
In all my years, I've never
seen a scholarship student like you.

98
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,180
I had no idea
that you would wreak all this havoc

99
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,220
on everyone at Jooshin.

100
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,350
That's what I came here to do.

101
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:51,900
To do everything to make things right
no matter what.

102
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,400
And catch who killed my brother.

103
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,620
I'll never be able to go back
and prevent what they did on that day.

104
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,880
But I can absolutely get revenge
on every one of those bullies.

105
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,880
I'll get justice
by bringing them all down.

106
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,470
Please don't tell me
that you're one of those people.

107
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,600
Are you?

108
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,370
Hey!

109
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,330
You called the cops on me?
Really?

110
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,500
For drugs and bullying?
Got fuckin' evidence?

111
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:53,590
Seriously. You barely even know me.
What gives you the right?

112
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,000
I've done nothing to you!

113
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,920
What'd you hand over to the police?
What was it?

114
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:01,470
I wanna see your little videos.
Come on. Show me.

115
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,640
Actually…

116
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,270
Just leave, and don't think about
coming back here.

117
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,850
I thought I told you before.

118
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,310
I'm the one who decides
whether I stay or not.

119
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,780
You don't have the right to force me,
Choi Yun-Seok.

120
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,360
Why wouldn't he be able to?

121
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,610
You kids don't pay a dime to come here.

122
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,450
We have to pay tuition
and your development fund.

123
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:25,870
Have you ever thought about that?
Who's footing the bill for your benefits?

124
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,750
Seems selfish to me.

125
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:29,910
Right, He-ra?

126
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,710
That's right.

127
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,590
Scholarships are given out
'cause "noblesse oblige" and all that.

128
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,890
But that's all it is,
so don't go getting it backwards.

129
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:49,140
You've never heard of
"don't bite the hand that feeds?"

130
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:52,560
That's a really crappy reason.

131
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,650
-What is his deal?
-What the hell?

132
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:57,570
So it's okay to treat them badly
'cause they don't pay to go to school?

133
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:58,570
What is this shit?

134
00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:59,820
He's right about that!

135
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,030
We shouldn't have to be
marginalized and bullied

136
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,820
just because we're not rich kids.

137
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,950
Have you lost your damn minds?

138
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:10,330
If you don't wanna be reported,
you shouldn't've done anything wrong.

139
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,000
-You don't know when to stop.
-Let go, Choi Yun-seok.

140
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,880
Jae-i.

141
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,010
Please tell me you're not taking his side.

142
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,010
Kang Ha isn't the one who's wrong.

143
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,050
We're in the wrong.

144
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,190
The rest of you shouldn't be afraid
to cooperate with the police.

145
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,650
The mistreatment you faced at school…

146
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:36,940
Go and tell them.

147
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:38,900
About everything.

148
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,450
Make us face what we've done.

149
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:44,910
That way…

150
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,660
no one goes through it again.

151
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,250
Oh my God.

152
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,620
Why don't you get
what I'm saying?

153
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,830
The police came here to the school!

154
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:33,080
But, Mom, I didn't hit anyone.

155
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,250
Well, I did hit some people,
but it's not like that.

156
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,500
And I told you, I didn't do it
'cause I wanted to.

157
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,880
Never mind. We'll talk later.

158
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,010
Oh goddammit.

159
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,730
You think he's being ridiculous?

160
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,110
I mean, you know Chan-min's right.

161
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,820
He never wanted to bully anyone.

162
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,570
He did it 'cause you all said to.

163
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,780
So he could fit in with you.

164
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:16,750
What about it?

165
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,750
Anything else?

166
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:22,340
I mean, you said you were here
to right some wrongs.

167
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,630
So what now?

168
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,300
It was on your birthday.

169
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,220
Right?

170
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:35,100
But you dodged a bullet somehow.

171
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:37,640
You weren't in any of the videos. Lucky.

172
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,480
So what now?

173
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,570
I'm just getting started.

174
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,650
Everyone responsible should be punished.

175
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,410
And I'll make sure
they get what they deserve.

176
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,100
Do you really have to go to New York?

177
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:18,020
It's already been decided.

178
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,150
I don't ever
wanna leave you alone again.

179
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,190
To think of how hard it all must've been…

180
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,530
I can't tell you how sorry I--

181
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:31,820
You don't have to
keep saying sorry, Ri-an.

182
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,200
I know exactly how you feel.

183
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,640
Ri-an, give me a minute.

184
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,640
Mm.

185
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:04,650
WE FOUND OUT WHO SENT THE VIDEO
IT WAS PRINCIPAL PARK HUI-SEON

186
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,530
Nam Ju-won!

187
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:14,030
-I wanna talk to you.
-Let go.

188
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:16,120
The video that you sent me.

189
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,830
I could report it to the police.

190
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,130
Nam Ju-won.

191
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:29,380
I didn't know anything about you
before you blackmailed me.

192
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,010
But even now,
I have trouble understanding.

193
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,140
Why would you do that?

194
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,970
Just think about all you've done.

195
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,480
You had the students
in the palm of your hand.

196
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,140
You even had control of the teachers.

197
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,980
You ruled Jooshin, and I…

198
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,110
despised you.

199
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:56,200
Out of all the videos he gave the cops,

200
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,490
you didn't include the videos
that you were blackmailing me with.

201
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,910
Yeah, he didn't use
the most important videos.

202
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,080
I didn't share those.

203
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:07,960
Does that mean

204
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:10,250
you're holding on to that threat?

205
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,470
Thinking about it.

206
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,390
You know what
I think that sounds like?

207
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,100
You won't actually do it,

208
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,510
and I bet you never will.

209
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,140
Probably because
you're protecting something.

210
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,140
Like I am.

211
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,310
'Cause you know very well
that by making it public, then

212
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,400
your mother will get hurt.

213
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,900
And the reason
I was the one you went after

214
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,870
was because you were afraid of Ri-an.

215
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,630
Jae-i seems so different.

216
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,170
Different? How?

217
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,170
Well, for example, when did she start
speaking up for others?

218
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,880
She's definitely changed.

219
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,930
When do you think she'll come back to us?
Honestly, I kinda miss her already.

220
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,430
The cold Jung Jae-i
I've always known, you know?

221
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,810
Don't know.

222
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,980
But why do you even care?

223
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,440
She's leaving soon.

224
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,070
I should stop caring because she's gone?

225
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,570
But you hated Jae-i.

226
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,780
You wanted her
to leave Jooshin more than anyone.

227
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,280
Yeah. Well, that was just--

228
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,410
That was when
I was extremely pissed at her!

229
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,790
These kinda things happen
between friends, you know?

230
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,830
You said you weren't friends anymore.

231
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,080
And that you'd get your revenge on her.

232
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,090
In the end, it was Jae-i
who saved me from hell.

233
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,590
I guess she's always been that way.

234
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:37,380
Ever since we were little,
she always accepted how bitchy I was.

235
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:40,550
After that, I wanted to start acting
like a real friend from now on.

236
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,430
But now she's leaving us.

237
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,110
That video.

238
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,780
Did you send it, Principal Park?

239
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,490
"Video?" What do you mean by that?

240
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,370
Where and how did you get it?

241
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,200
What the hell are you trying to pull?
Do you have any idea what you've done?

242
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,660
Slow down.

243
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,290
Don't ignore what I asked you.

244
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,000
Now give me an answer.

245
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,670
This is

246
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:20,340
a private institution
affiliated with the Jooshin Group,

247
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,430
and you're its heir.

248
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,590
So what?

249
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,850
I'm telling you that when it comes to you,

250
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:29,480
I don't have any power
to make decisions independently.

251
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,270
My mother?

252
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,820
Were you spying on me?

253
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,950
Seriously, what's the matter with you?

254
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,870
Fine, let's put aside
the fact that you spied on me,

255
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:50,080
even though
you completely crossed the line.

256
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,000
But why would you send me that video?

257
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,130
Because I was concerned.

258
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:00,590
If you were to keep seeing each other,
and she wound up pregnant,

259
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:01,720
it'd be a headache.

260
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,970
It was a reality check.

261
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:08,100
-What the hell?
-How dare you raise your voice at me!

262
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:11,480
You're my only son
and the heir of Jooshin!

263
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,350
But before being all those things,
I'm also a person.

264
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,940
I'm not your pet dog on a chain!

265
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,990
I can't stay. You're suffocating me here.

266
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:21,820
It's miserable.

267
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,370
You know, I almost wish you decided
to throw me away like my father.

268
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,590
All right, I'm done.

269
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:42,590
I can't quit being your son,
but I… I can quit being your heir.

270
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,010
Ri-an!

271
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,350
How could you say something like that?

272
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,150
You are my son.

273
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:00,480
My only son, the owner of Jooshin,
and the center of my entire world.

274
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:02,860
Those things…

275
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,610
I want you to remain all three.

276
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,330
You are my one and only hope, Ri-an.

277
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,770
-Good afternoon! How are you?
-Oh, hello.

278
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:01,590
I didn't think
you would actually go to the police.

279
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,340
A school should protect its students.

280
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,930
And they didn't do their duty.

281
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:10,680
Well, you certainly
found justice for them.

282
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:14,980
You got revenge for your brother.

283
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,640
You righted all those wrongs.

284
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:19,150
He would've done the same.

285
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:23,400
He never would've tolerated
what they were doing.

286
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,480
He wouldn't.

287
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:27,570
I knew In-han.

288
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:29,870
That's exactly who he was.

289
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,240
I don't really think of it as revenge.

290
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:36,660
I think it's just…

291
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,000
us paying for all the things
that we did to him.

292
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,550
So I'm willing to take
whatever it is on the chin.

293
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:48,470
There's a lot of things
that I was never taught.

294
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:52,390
Things I never quite understood
were wrong.

295
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,810
Things that I enabled and let slide.

296
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:04,230
It would've been nice
if we had learned it sooner.

297
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,200
Before we lost In-han.

298
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,540
I apologize…

299
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,210
for not realizing it sooner.

300
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,680
And also for

301
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:35,560
having been selfish
and only trying to protect Ri-an.

302
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,310
I'm sorry too…

303
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,020
for making it hard.

304
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,950
Soon, I'm leaving for New York.

305
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:00,460
To New York?

306
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,290
What'll happen to you then?

307
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:03,670
Oh, nothing.

308
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:08,380
I'll go on as Jung Jae-i of
the Jaeyul Group. That's it.

309
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,760
So, Kang Ha,

310
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,720
take care.

311
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,220
Become top student.

312
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,480
Jae-i.

313
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:30,490
Did you…

314
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,240
ever have feelings for me at any point?

315
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,370
Honestly, no.

316
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,670
Not even a little.

317
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,720
Stop lying.

318
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,280
I'm sorry.

319
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,250
This is all my fault.

320
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,120
Kang In-han.

321
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,160
How are you?

322
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,460
Say hi.

323
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:06,680
I invited Ri-an because I thought
he might have something to say to you.

324
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:10,350
KANG IN-HAN
APR 13, 2007 - OCT 27, 2023

325
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,610
I think we should
take a step back and slow down,

326
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,160
try to make things right, one at a time.

327
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:29,030
I'll do everything I can

328
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,370
right up until I leave for New York.

329
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:35,670
Jae-i.

330
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:43,510
Is this really the end for us?

331
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,850
It's not the end.

332
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,720
The two of us are only 18, Ri-an.

333
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,060
It's just… a little pause.

334
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,400
We'll still be thinking about each other.

335
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,580
I don't think I can go on without you.

336
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,700
And you?

337
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,120
Without me, could…

338
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:17,960
could you go on?

339
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,550
Will Kang Ha get an apology?

340
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:28,640
He will.

341
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,010
I'm begging you, please don't go.

342
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,230
Ri-an,

343
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:39,270
to me, it feels like

344
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,520
this is our punishment.

345
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:45,190
This is how we're paying
for what we've done.

346
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:48,740
Or at least, that's how I think of it.

347
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:52,870
We left people with scars
that will never heal.

348
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,120
We both did.

349
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,380
So we should also

350
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,010
take accountability for it.

351
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,380
Embrace it.

352
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,280
One moment.

353
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,760
How did you get that?

354
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:52,760
Ms. Han Ji-su. This is Jooshin.

355
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:55,560
A relationship with a student…

356
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,390
How could you abuse
your position like that?

357
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:03,400
I'm sure you're well aware of
the position this will put us in.

358
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,150
All that's been going on
has been a blight on this school.

359
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,480
And if this gets out…

360
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,280
I think you can imagine how that'd go.

361
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,580
Mr. Woo-jin's parents
would like to keep this matter quiet,

362
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,410
so I'll be clear about this.

363
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,500
As soon as you leave here today,
you will submit your resignation

364
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,830
and leave the school.

365
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:27,050
E-TICKET CONFIRMATION

366
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:28,880
Principal Park, I'm--

367
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,090
You really should be thankful
that his parents are being

368
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:34,220
as generous and considerate
as they are right now.

369
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:38,600
Remember that generosity
often masks something else, as you know.

370
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:43,940
Was it Woo-jin…

371
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,150
who revealed it?

372
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:51,190
Ms. Han, if it wasn't
for Mr. Woo-jin's intervention,

373
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,280
odds are good

374
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,780
that you'd be in prison
for that hit-and-run.

375
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:59,540
In return, we expect your silence

376
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:02,500
on your inappropriate relationship
and all other matters.

377
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:17,970
Should we all go on a trip together
before she leaves?

378
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,180
We could go somewhere close by.

379
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,350
No, thanks.

380
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,140
I'm good.

381
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,810
Let's not make a fuss.

382
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:29,190
It's not like I'll be
on a different planet or something.

383
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,650
-Hey, Woo-jin?
-Yeah?

384
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,900
Are you all right?

385
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:35,280
Yeah.

386
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:40,540
Can you come back here during breaks?

387
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:43,080
I wouldn't count on it.
I've been told not to return.

388
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,790
Man, he really got his vengeance.

389
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:48,130
What do you mean?

390
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:51,210
That idiot went and exposed everyone here.
Now you have to go to New York.

391
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,670
And you're being torn away
from the three of us.

392
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,010
That's so revenge.

393
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:58,720
After everything that he's been through,
I don't think it's enough.

394
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:14,530
Vengeance.

395
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,040
What did you do?

396
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:26,500
What the hell did you do to Jae-i?

397
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,290
I met with her father.

398
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,040
I thought…

399
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,130
I thought you wanted her to disappear,

400
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:36,380
so I asked him to send her to New York.

401
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:37,630
I said if he didn't,

402
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,720
I would tell everyone her secret.

403
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,180
What secret are you talking about?

404
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:45,390
That she was pregnant.

405
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,350
What?

406
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,520
With Ri-an's child.

407
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,280
Oh my God, how can you be such a jerk!

408
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,820
How could you tell that to Jae-i's father?
How could you do that, huh?

409
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,410
-How could you do something like that?
-It was you!

410
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:03,280
You made it clear I had to choose sides.

411
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,540
I chose you. Don't you get that?

412
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:14,460
Fine, but I still don't understand
how you could do something like that.

413
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,710
How are you ever going to face Ri-an now?

414
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,930
How will you be able
to look Jae-i in the eye?

415
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:21,970
You know how important
you are to them, you idiot!

416
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,350
I'll come clean, then.

417
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,770
I should tell them it was my fault.
That it was my doing.

418
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:28,680
No, are you crazy?

419
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:32,360
You have to keep your mouth shut
if we want them to keep being our friends.

420
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:58,760
I wanted to say goodbye before I go.

421
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,840
I just handed over my resignation.

422
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:10,690
Nothing bad'll happen.

423
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,100
And no one will know.

424
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:15,020
But how can you really know that?

425
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,110
You and I,

426
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,320
we know everything.

427
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:22,740
There's no way this is over.

428
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,880
Wait.

429
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:39,300
But what the hell did she mean by that?

430
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,340
Did she do that to me on purpose?

431
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:17,840
Do you remember
when you asked me who I wanted?

432
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:22,260
You mean
between the Hermès and He-ra?

433
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:25,840
It's He-ra.

434
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,260
The one that I really wanna be with.

435
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,350
I know.

436
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:36,810
You came here at this hour
just to tell me that?

437
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,700
I did something horrible.

438
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,450
And I think all of this started

439
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:50,660
on my birthday.

440
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,790
All my wrongdoings.

441
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,500
And I'm scared to own them.

442
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,960
But there's one I have to tell you.

443
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:01,250
Lee Woo-jin.

444
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:04,170
What are you about to say?

445
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,800
That day, I didn't know

446
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:08,340
what really happened.

447
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,560
I didn't tell anyone…

448
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:16,190
that she was the one driving the car.

449
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,480
My dad's a politician.
I didn't wanna hurt him.

450
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:22,150
So I had it covered up.

451
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,490
Then one day,

452
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,860
I found a small pen in the car.

453
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,700
I didn't know till recently

454
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:34,750
that it was a camera.

455
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,760
I'm sorry, Jae-i.

456
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:08,400
This belongs

457
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:10,950
to In-han.

458
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:35,560
So you're saying the woman
in the video is a teacher at your school?

459
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:41,270
Yeah, start by finding out
the suspect's address, Detective.

460
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:44,440
What was that about the car registration?
It belonged to an assemblyman?

461
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:46,860
Presidential candidate Lee Han-jong.

462
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,870
What would a presidential candidate have
to do with a hit-and-run on a student?

463
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:56,790
I definitely think
we should report this to the chief.

464
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:58,160
Yeah, I think so too.

465
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:05,380
I'm Assistant Inspector Jung Ju-han.
You need to come with us.

466
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,800
Hold on a minute.

467
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:10,170
We have a search and seizure warrant.

468
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:11,880
Please cooperate.

469
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:15,970
Who gave you the permission to do this?
This is Jooshin High!

470
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:24,940
Damn it.

471
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,820
Ms. Han Ji-su? I'm Inspector Jang In-ho,
Seoul Yongo Police.

472
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,780
You're under arrest for hit-and-run
according to Article 5,

473
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:36,490
Paragraph 3 of the Act of
Aggravated Punishment for Specific Crimes.

474
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:41,040
You have the right to remain silent.
You can refuse to give a statement.

475
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,970
Hi. Ms. Han?

476
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:54,300
Thank you for last time.

477
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:56,300
Thank you.

478
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:58,680
Are things better for you yet?

479
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,470
Yes.

480
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,690
You're a very skilled artist, In-han.

481
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:03,940
Keep up the good work.

482
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:05,520
See ya!

483
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:07,650
Appreciate it.

484
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:33,220
The former chairman's purpose
for establishing a private institution

485
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,260
was to nurture students
to become assets to their country.

486
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:39,930
But instead, we have a place that enabled
drugs and bullying to become rampant.

487
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:41,930
And a Jooshin teacher
was behind the hit-and-run

488
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,600
that resulted in the death of a student.

489
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:46,230
I'll take responsibility.

490
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:50,190
The losses suffered can't be replaced
by taking responsibility.

491
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:52,490
We will discuss how this shall be handled

492
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:55,950
with the new principal of Jooshin.

493
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,830
Chairwoman An! Chairwoman An!

494
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:09,040
I hope you're aware
of how hard I have worked

495
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:12,090
to protect the school's reputation
over the years.

496
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,300
I don't understand.

497
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:16,300
How could you treat me like garbage
and just throw me away?

498
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,510
Considering everything you've done,

499
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:21,260
I think "garbage"
is being a little too kind.

500
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:24,770
Do you think I actually bother
to be involved in the school

501
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:26,640
because I care about some institution?

502
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:28,560
No.

503
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:32,190
I'm doing it all for Ri-an.

504
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,070
You should've done everything
in your power to protect my son.

505
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:37,490
That was your one duty.

506
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,120
Protecting the successor of Jooshin.

507
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:04,600
I'm glad you're leaving the school, Mom.

508
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:10,100
I no longer have to be
ashamed of your actions.

509
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:18,400
I gave Kang Ha all those videos
that he showed the police.

510
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,240
I've known for a while
that Jooshin told you

511
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:24,370
to keep an eye on
the student's personal cloud, so…

512
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:28,250
So I wanted to use it
to destroy this place.

513
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:34,040
But I couldn't 'cause I didn't want it
to blow back on you.

514
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:42,510
-Ju-won.
-But it's all over now.

515
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:46,600
And I'm happy you no longer have
to play a part in that.

516
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:52,980
That's all I ever wanted.

517
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:39,280
Is it true there were drug deals…

518
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,490
Can you elaborate
on the eldest daughter's pregnancy?

519
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:43,110
It's come as a huge shock

520
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,530
that the eldest daughter of
the "A" Group family was pregnant

521
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:46,910
and has since had a miscarriage.

522
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:50,410
Even more shocking is that the father
is the heir to the "B" Group fortune.

523
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,500
Yes, and the relationship
between the A and B Groups…

524
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,880
I want this handled.

525
00:43:58,050 --> 00:44:02,010
Make sure the response
does no damage to Jooshin's reputation.

526
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,010
So how are you feeling?

527
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:10,970
I'm asking you how it feels
to live a life exactly like your mother's.

528
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:14,940
And no matter how repulsive I find it,

529
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:18,650
I have to acknowledge
that you take after her.

530
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:20,320
Your behavior makes that clear.

531
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:24,740
Your carelessness has destroyed
any plans I had in place for you.

532
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,120
You serve no purpose to me now.

533
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,500
I guess this was inevitable.

534
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:39,460
You and I
have just wasted our precious time.

535
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:44,260
I was scared…

536
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:48,680
that you'd throw me out
like you did to Mom.

537
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:52,810
Since I was three years old,
you always told me

538
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:55,600
that if I wasn't good,

539
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:58,520
you'd make me disappear too.

540
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:01,480
And I was so scared of that.

541
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:10,660
But I'm not now.

542
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:13,620
Not anymore.

543
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:16,870
Just be aware…

544
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:23,420
I don't see a point in ever going back
when I end something.

545
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:25,220
And that goes even more so

546
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,630
for people.

547
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:47,490
Let's go play some basketball.
Free throw bets.

548
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:49,950
What? I'm never holding us up.
Come on, let's go.

549
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:52,370
-Loser buys drinks, okay?
-Okay. Let's go.

550
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:54,080
Hey, let me join, let me join.

551
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,950
I wanna say I'm sorry.

552
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:41,670
I went to where In-han is.

553
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:44,750
You went to see my brother?

554
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,710
So, uh, just so you know,

555
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:49,880
while I didn't directly cause
what happened,

556
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:52,430
it is true the guys
were bullying him that day.

557
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,010
And it's all my fault.

558
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,980
I should've stepped in
and put a stop to it all.

559
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:07,820
At the time, I just couldn't stand
seeing him hang out with Jae-i.

560
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,860
So I just stood there

561
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:12,320
as they tormented him
and pushed him around.

562
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:17,620
Look, I know

563
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:20,500
I'll probably never be forgiven.

564
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:23,130
Even so…

565
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:27,840
I owe an apology

566
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,720
both to you and to…

567
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:34,220
and to In-han too.

568
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:37,350
I lost my brother, Ri-an.

569
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:42,640
You could apologize a million times,
and still, it won't bring him back.

570
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:46,520
You're sorry, are you?

571
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:54,160
Must be nice.

572
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:00,450
If it wasn't for that accident,

573
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:05,250
my brother would still be here,
laughing and joking with me.

574
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,250
If you guys didn't bully him,

575
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:11,550
if he wasn't driven
into the streets so late…

576
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:14,470
then he'd…

577
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:18,060
he'd still be alive and well.

578
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,350
You're sorry?

579
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:26,020
All right.

580
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:28,190
Just

581
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:31,190
take that guilt and learn to live with it.

582
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:34,950
Because I will never

583
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,660
accept your apology.

584
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:54,760
Everything is a result
of my negligence.

585
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:58,800
Before being the chairperson
and the leader of a group,

586
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:02,270
I am a mother,
and my child has caused trouble.

587
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:05,600
And for that, I apologize.

588
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:08,230
However, the illegal video
currently circulating

589
00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:10,110
is a clear violation of the law.

590
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:13,030
We will take legal actions
to curtail its circulation.

591
00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:15,150
Mr. Choi Yun-seok.

592
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,280
Do you admit
to inflicting acts of violence

593
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,950
on the scholarship students?

594
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,330
And lastly,

595
00:49:21,410 --> 00:49:25,660
I fully acknowledge the magnitude
of the violence and inappropriate behavior

596
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:29,000
by the students
of Jooshin's private institution,

597
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:32,460
and I vow to ensure
all wrongs shall be righted.

598
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:34,510
Choi Yun-seok, Baek Chan-min,

599
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:36,630
Kwon Jae-jun, Cha Ji-seok, Lee Yu-jin.

600
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,680
Do you still deny your actions?

601
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:52,610
I am also

602
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:54,780
an offender.

603
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,920
Maybe I should've just come clean

604
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,960
about visiting Jae-i's father.

605
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,340
You already destroyed
your dad's presidential campaign

606
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:16,010
by handing over that spy pen.

607
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:22,430
And you know there are times
when some things are better left unsaid.

608
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:25,020
Like your betrayal of Jae-i.

609
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:26,980
We'll be taking that to the grave,
all right?

610
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:31,520
Just be sure to treat Jae-i and Ri-an well
till the day you die.

611
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:33,110
Wonder if it'll change.

612
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:34,570
What?

613
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:35,530
Jooshin.

614
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:37,070
Us four.

615
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:44,620
I mean, I just don't see…
any quick fix for things like that.

616
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,000
Whether that's us or Jooshin.

617
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:51,750
I'll see you later?

618
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:59,380
Don't go anywhere, and head straight home.

619
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:00,840
Yeah.

620
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:13,150
Our first time taking the bus together

621
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:15,860
as high schoolers.

622
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:22,320
We always took it together
in the middle school days.

623
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:26,700
I was scared.

624
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,870
And I'm sorry for avoiding you.

625
00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:33,460
I should've been there for you.

626
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:34,920
What?

627
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,920
You've changed so much
since you've become rich.

628
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,380
When did we ever
apologize for stuff like that?

629
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:43,390
We would beat each other up
and just let it slide.

630
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:46,810
Don't you remember?
In-han would always go,

631
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:48,390
"That stuff happens between friends."

632
00:52:01,110 --> 00:52:03,740
See now? Told you it'd look good on you.

633
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:06,030
Yeah, but that's a given.

634
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:07,160
I'm Yoon He-ra.

635
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,040
He-ra.

636
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:11,750
Mm-hmm?

637
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:15,710
I never knew
that you secretly felt that way.

638
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,250
I know that I can be direct
and a bit cold.

639
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:24,220
But I thought you knew
that's just how I communicate.

640
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:28,600
It was never because
I didn't consider you a friend.

641
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:33,520
I know that.

642
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:37,770
And I didn't act any better.

643
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:40,730
Kinda embarrassing, actually.

644
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:45,490
I feel like we've been best friends
for next to forever,

645
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:47,160
but I only just got it.

646
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:48,830
What?

647
00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:52,410
You're not cold naturally,
but you just pretend like you are.

648
00:52:55,330 --> 00:52:57,880
And it was just a way for you
to protect yourself.

649
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:08,180
I'll wait for you, okay?

650
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:17,190
Please hurry back.

651
00:53:22,730 --> 00:53:24,280
My friend, Jung Jae-i.

652
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:29,160
Take care of yourself,

653
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,330
my mean…

654
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:34,790
and beautiful friend.

655
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:41,380
Let's go.

656
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:06,440
Could you pull over?

657
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:20,170
Skip school and spend the day with me.

658
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,340
-You have to hold on, okay?
-Okay.

659
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:32,850
-All right?
-I'll hold on. Now, let's ride.

660
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:35,680
-Ooh!
-So close.

661
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:37,480
-Are you good?
-Let me try again.

662
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:39,560
-I'm going.
-Let's go.

663
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:46,110
-Look at me. How am I doing?
-That's it. Try coming this way.

664
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:57,080
-Whoa!
-Easier than I thought it'd be!

665
00:54:59,710 --> 00:55:01,920
-You're good at this. You are.
-I know, right?

666
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:06,090
What do you think? I'm good, aren't I?

667
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:10,590
Here. Try it.

668
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,760
Oh. This is… what?

669
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:16,470
Toast.

670
00:55:19,770 --> 00:55:21,140
Just try it, all right?

671
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:24,270
Hold on. When did you try this before?

672
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:27,320
I actually haven't yet.

673
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:29,570
I wanted to try it with you.

674
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:39,540
Ooh, it's really good.

675
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:41,080
-Quick. Try it.
-Let's go.

676
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,170
How is it?

677
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:50,050
-Mmm. Really good.
-It's good, isn't it?

678
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:54,050
Does this chef have a Michelin star?
They should be famous!

679
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:57,350
-You're not hungry? I'm taking yours too!
-No! No way, I'm gonna eat it.

680
00:55:57,430 --> 00:55:58,770
Let's get another one.

681
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:11,490
The weather is beautiful.

682
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:13,240
The breeze feels good too.

683
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,200
Yeah, real good.

684
00:56:16,370 --> 00:56:17,240
Ri-an.

685
00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:20,250
Kang Ha once said to me

686
00:56:21,870 --> 00:56:23,580
that I should find and protect

687
00:56:24,210 --> 00:56:26,540
whatever makes me happiest in life.

688
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:29,420
So I thought about it.

689
00:56:31,970 --> 00:56:33,220
And it's you, Ri-an.

690
00:56:34,930 --> 00:56:37,850
From the moment I first saw you
when we were children,

691
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,720
you have always been part of my world.

692
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:44,230
That's how I survived and still survive.

693
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:46,860
Even to the 18-year-old Jung Jae-i,

694
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:50,480
you are her one and only source of light.

695
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:58,160
You're mine as well.

696
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:02,370
If it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't be here either. No way.

697
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:11,420
But, Ri-an,

698
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:14,470
I think it's probably time

699
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:17,590
to stop being so dependent.

700
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:22,600
I'm looking forward to us meeting again

701
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:25,980
when we no longer have
to lean on each other

702
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:28,810
but can share
in each other's happiness individually.

703
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:31,610
Then we can come back together.

704
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:36,030
Let's say goodbye with a smile

705
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:38,620
so that one day we can be together

706
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,490
and smile again.

707
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:57,760
Jae-i, I hope that…

708
00:58:00,850 --> 00:58:02,640
you don't have such a hard time.

709
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:07,390
I only want you to be happy, Jae-i.

710
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,120
Me too.

711
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:27,120
I also hope that…

712
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:35,260
you always smile
and lead a beautiful life.

713
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,250
Moving forward in time,

714
00:59:52,330 --> 00:59:56,500
we'll discover the poetic verses
of William Shakespeare

715
00:59:56,590 --> 00:59:57,880
and delve into the…

716
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:00,470
When you substitute it for five,
it becomes minus two here.

717
01:00:00,550 --> 01:00:02,130
-Do you follow me?
-Right.

718
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:05,680
Hey, this looks nice.
Did your mom buy this for you?

719
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,850
-Two, three. One, two.
-Hey, give me that.

720
01:00:09,350 --> 01:00:12,310
I'll be graduating, so I won't be able
to take care of you like I have been.

721
01:00:12,390 --> 01:00:14,150
You'll take care of everyone now.

722
01:00:14,230 --> 01:00:16,770
Did you get me a gift for graduation?
I'm just…

723
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:18,860
Get off your damn phone!
A senior's talking!

724
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:20,320
Ugh, jeez.

725
01:00:21,030 --> 01:00:22,030
Hey!

726
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:56,730
Jae-i said, "Say sorry."

727
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,070
Um, is it for--

728
01:00:59,150 --> 01:01:00,440
I mean, who else is here?

729
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:05,860
This isn't like you, He-ra.

730
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:10,700
I was wondering
who'd eat this kinda thing.

731
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:12,620
I heard you introduced her to it.

732
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:15,540
Well,

733
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:19,210
she didn't actually eat it,
so she wouldn't know if it was good.

734
01:01:23,090 --> 01:01:24,340
Too sweet.

735
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:25,470
Whoa!

736
01:01:25,550 --> 01:01:26,510
Who is this for?

737
01:01:26,590 --> 01:01:27,890
Ugh.

738
01:02:25,230 --> 01:02:27,110
I didn't know
it would turn out this way.

739
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,990
I tried so many times to stop
and forget everything.

740
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:32,990
I just…

741
01:02:34,330 --> 01:02:35,580
I just wanted…

742
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:37,870
I just wanted to be with you.

743
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:41,040
But I couldn't.

744
01:02:41,790 --> 01:02:42,920
I wasn't able.

745
01:02:44,590 --> 01:02:46,800
I couldn't let
another tragedy happen again.

746
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,090
It's why I was here.

747
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:52,350
Kang Ha.

748
01:02:52,430 --> 01:02:54,100
So I had no other options.

749
01:02:56,470 --> 01:02:58,310
I didn't know it would force you to go.

750
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:01,520
Sorry.

751
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:06,030
I'm sorry for making you leave.

752
01:03:07,530 --> 01:03:09,450
I'm sorry for having a crush on you

753
01:03:10,070 --> 01:03:11,530
and for everything.

754
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:23,080
You said you wanted to see me smile.

755
01:03:24,210 --> 01:03:26,710
You won't be able to see it
through those tears.

756
01:03:33,260 --> 01:03:34,680
Don't worry too much.

757
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:37,640
I'm not going.

758
01:03:38,890 --> 01:03:39,810
You're not?

759
01:03:41,770 --> 01:03:44,730
I'm gonna stand on my own
and follow my heart.

760
01:03:47,610 --> 01:03:51,110
I'm going to a new place to start over
where I'll be happy.

761
01:03:54,990 --> 01:03:57,160
So, Kang Ha…

762
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:01,210
don't worry about me at all

763
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
and take care.

764
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:16,680
Oh yeah.

765
01:04:17,930 --> 01:04:18,930
That day.

766
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:22,440
Do you remember
the last question you asked?

767
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:34,610
You were right about it.

768
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:36,160
I was lying to you.

769
01:07:04,350 --> 01:07:05,390
Hi, Mom.

770
01:12:15,070 --> 01:12:16,660
YOU LOOK SHAKEN UP, KIM RI-AN
