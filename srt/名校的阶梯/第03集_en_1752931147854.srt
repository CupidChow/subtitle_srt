HIERARCHY

2
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:17,590
Why'd you do that?

3
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,310
I could have dealt with it myself.

4
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,270
Because of what you just did for me,
people are going to turn on you.

5
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,020
Kang Ha.

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,070
Why did you really come to this school?

7
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,620
So I guess… you know who I am.

8
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,310
I came here for one reason.

9
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,390
Mm-hmm.

10
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,980
I'm here to take your place.

11
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,400
I'm trying to be number one.

12
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,070
I heard if I'm top student,
Jooshin will pay for me to study abroad,

13
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,240
and when applying to foreign branches,
I'd get priority consideration.

14
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,830
Up till now, you were always
the top student, weren't you?

15
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,830
No scholarship student
has ever received those benefits.

16
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,710
Well, I'll be the first one.

17
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:33,420
So watch out. I'm coming for ya.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,590
They're just grades to you, but

19
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,300
it could be… a life-changing opportunity

20
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:41,850
for me.

21
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,740
Was that little show
really necessary?

22
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,370
The kiss? What I said earlier
should have been enough.

23
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,750
I've been perfectly clear to you.

24
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:12,960
Who I like and what I choose to do
with them has nothing to do with you.

25
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,780
NO SIBLINGS

26
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,960
Why did you really come
to this school?

27
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:00,090
So I guess… you know who I am.

28
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,510
Kang In-han.

29
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,720
Kang Ha.

30
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,420
Let's go together.

31
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,130
You know, if we're gonna do this,
I figure we'd better put on a show.

32
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,260
We should show up at school together.

33
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,220
Make it more… convincing.

34
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:53,020
Or not.

35
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,350
-If you don't want--
-Come down when I call.

36
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,320
I'll be back.

37
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,470
EPISODE 3
HIERARCHY: A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN

38
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,400
Oh. Jae-i?

39
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,320
What? Well, don't just stand there.
Get in.

40
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,580
Stop staring at it. It won't fall off.

41
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,050
Oh, I'm not worried about that.

42
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,510
Then what?

43
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,550
It's cute.

44
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,930
Seeing your car and my bike together.

45
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,150
Ugh, how tacky. What's with the bracelet?

46
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:23,020
Ah! So it's a friendship bracelet
from Seonyul.

47
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,780
-"Seonyul"?
-The orchestra I'm in.

48
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,530
Remember at your place?
On the day that you and I first met?

49
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,820
I was there with other musicians, playing.

50
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:34,080
You all wear the same bracelet
in your music group?

51
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,120
Mm-hmm.

52
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,250
Is it tacky though?

53
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:39,790
I thought it looked pretty cool.

54
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,360
Let's go in. You don't wanna be late.

55
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,910
-Holding hands!
-Is this real? Not a prank?

56
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,830
-Crazy!
-Seriously? For real?

57
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:18,580
Big news.
Jae-i and Kang Ha are holding hands.

58
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,460
-What the heck?
-Wait, wait.

59
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,380
-I need to get this on camera.
-Hold up, hold up, hold up.

60
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,000
Are they actually dating?

61
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,020
What is it? Is there some kind of problem?

62
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,350
Oh, no. No problem here.

63
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:57,370
I've never seen her holding hands
with a boy other than Ri-an.

64
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,210
What does she see in that kid?
What has he got?

65
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,290
Don't you have a class to go teach?

66
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,500
Uh…

67
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,090
Right.

68
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,930
Oh, looks like the gloves are off.

69
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,180
Did you see the photos?

70
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,350
Are those two serious, like, for real?

71
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,600
Guys, let's dial it back a bit.

72
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,060
Everybody's been gossiping about it.

73
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:23,980
She's our friend,

74
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,020
so I think we should keep it down
and support her decision.

75
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,070
Damn! So it's real! Oh my God!

76
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,690
What about our sexy bad boy?

77
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,940
Ri-an.

78
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:34,320
-Are they really over?
-Looks like it.

79
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,740
Otherwise, she wouldn't
go out with someone else.

80
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,660
And who's to say.

81
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,000
Maybe Ri-an has also found someone new.

82
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:43,710
Hey.

83
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:58,930
What's all this?

84
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,140
It's chocolate.

85
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,480
It's for you.

86
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,280
Help yourselves.

87
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,620
I have to go to
a special class this morning.

88
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,620
I feel kinda bad for Kim Seon-u.

89
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,210
That guy falls all over himself for her,
and she doesn't even bat an eye.

90
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,210
I know, right?

91
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:34,130
He's done it since they slept together
at Woo-jin's party, remember?

92
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,220
Hey!

93
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,760
Be quiet. Somebody might hear you.

94
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,850
Who cares. Everyone already knows.

95
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:42,140
It doesn't matter.
You shouldn't be gossiping.

96
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,680
What if He-ra heard you?

97
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,560
She'd kill you.

98
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,770
JOOSHIN HIGH SCHOOL

99
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:47,900
Calm down.

100
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,200
What's up, fam?

101
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,910
That's where Jae-i sits.

102
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,790
I'm being kind.

103
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:09,040
Ri-an wouldn't be able to concentrate
if Jae-i sat here today.

104
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,970
-What is that?
-Oh, well, this is, uh--

105
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,550
It's our seat.

106
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,770
I'm going to take this class with Jae-i
from now on. Good to see you all.

107
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,520
What?
Do you even know what this class is?

108
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,690
This is a special class
just for the four of us.

109
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,400
This isn't something
just anyone can take--

110
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:38,570
"Just anyone"?

111
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,280
He-ra.

112
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,420
I took care of his tuition and schedule.

113
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,550
If you don't like it, I'll make
a separate class for just us two.

114
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,050
Good afternoon.

115
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,310
So are you gonna start?

116
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,270
Right.

117
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:19,110
Today, we'll start by looking
into the literature of the 20th century.

118
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,320
Does anyone know of
any famous poets from this era?

119
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,510
Really?
You're gonna let this happen?

120
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,470
She's even bringing him into our classes!

121
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,390
Shouldn't we do something?

122
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,600
I think you should be upfront
and tell her that we're seeing each other.

123
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,520
You gotta provoke her to get a reaction.

124
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,070
Wait, Ri-an!

125
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,820
Don't be too much, He-ra.

126
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,500
Wha--

127
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:19,050
She's the problem here.
Why is he taking it out on me?

128
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,590
Hello.

129
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:33,980
Kang Ha.

130
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,480
Can we chat?

131
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:43,150
Spit it out. What do you want?

132
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:46,450
It's…

133
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,410
Hey, I'm sorry.

134
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,620
I didn't do it on purpose, Kang Ha.

135
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,250
What are you doing?

136
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,540
You already know my position.

137
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:00,500
I did stuff to you
'cause I felt pressured to do it

138
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,550
against my will. I'm sorry.

139
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,930
And why is that?

140
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,050
'Cause of Jae-i?

141
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,850
Don't treat me differently
'cause I'm dating her.

142
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,600
I'm still a scholarship student.

143
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:18,980
It's kinda silly,
don't you think, Chan-min?

144
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,980
My dad works for Jaeyul.

145
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,530
What if you kick my ass?

146
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,030
Beat the crap out of me, Kang Ha!

147
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,870
Yeah, I'll just, uh,

148
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,160
lie right here.

149
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,040
Do what you want.
Come on. Bring it on. Lay it on me.

150
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,580
What's wrong?

151
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,460
Want a stick? Is that what it is?

152
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,670
I'll find you one.

153
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,010
Here. Take this.

154
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:48,090
Smack me with it
until it breaks, but

155
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,970
please don't tell Jae-i anything bad.

156
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:55,560
I'm starting to notice
that no one here has a spine.

157
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,230
Figures. If you did, you wouldn't have
banded together to bully someone

158
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,690
just 'cause you were terrified
of big, bad Ri-an.

159
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:02,730
Right?

160
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,170
Well, this shit's gonna
be a goddamn headache.

161
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,550
Ow!

162
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,930
Do you think that means
Jae-i and Ri-an are officially over now?

163
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:33,600
Jae-i seems to think so,

164
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,520
but Ri-an… still wants her.

165
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,770
It's all crazy.

166
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,270
Why is she with that scholarship kid
all of a sudden?

167
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,820
She's acting out.

168
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,400
It won't last.

169
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,200
It doesn't mean anything.

170
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,700
I'm kinda worried.

171
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,120
It's riling up the school.

172
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:56,450
We don't want another tragedy to happen.

173
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:09,260
Wait, what are you doing?
What if someone sees us?

174
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,550
Who cares if they see?

175
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,470
Nothing'll happen.

176
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:15,180
Don't worry, Ms. Han. It'll be all right.

177
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,440
Later.

178
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:41,460
DON'T PROVOKE RI-AN, HE'S DANGEROUS
THAT'S HOW IT STARTED FOR IN-HAN TOO

179
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,460
That's mine.

180
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,560
It's getting in my head.

181
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:33,240
She looks at me
with no emotion in her eyes. Nothing.

182
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:41,990
No matter how hard I think,
it has to be you.

183
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,160
You left that note
in my locker… didn't you?

184
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,000
LET'S MEET AND TALK

185
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,300
He's right over there.
Let's go ask him.

186
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,850
Hi. Dude, what's your secret?

187
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,730
-What?
-How'd you get close to her?

188
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:05,640
Oh, yeah.

189
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,730
To us scholarship kids,
you're a role model now.

190
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:10,360
You're dating Queen Jae-i.
So what's your secret?

191
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,150
Also, um, can I get your number?

192
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,500
Okay, focus, focus!

193
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,040
You can do it!

194
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:32,540
Kim Ri-an! Kim Ri-an!

195
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,840
Blue 15! Blue 15!

196
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,640
Ready.

197
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:44,640
Set.

198
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,640
Down! Hut!

199
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,430
Yeah!

200
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,440
Did you see that?
Did you see that?

201
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,560
Let's go!

202
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:37,150
Yeah, let's go, baby!

203
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:41,070
Kim Ri-an! Kim Ri-an!

204
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,160
Kim Ri-an! Kim Ri-an!

205
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,240
Kim Ri-an!

206
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,370
Yeah!

207
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,370
You're amazing, Ri-an!

208
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,990
That was absolutely unbelievable.

209
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,040
The most incredible
touchdown celebration in history.

210
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,420
I know, right? What a man.

211
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,920
So romantic. What a sexy bad boy.

212
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,590
It totally got me
right in the heart.

213
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:41,840
Wait!

214
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,090
So when you suggested
he might already be into someone else,

215
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,800
you meant yourself!

216
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,220
Get it, girl!

217
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:52,310
Well, I'd be lying
if I said I didn't have an idea.

218
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:54,060
But yeah. I kinda figured.

219
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:57,560
And you just kept us in the dark.
I'm disappointed, Queen He-ra.

220
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,730
"Queen He-ra"?

221
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,280
You've advanced to queen.

222
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,070
You're Ri-an's new girlfriend,
who he kissed publicly.

223
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,950
Stop it.

224
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,920
Oh. It's Seon-u again.

225
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,250
You don't quit.

226
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,000
Get on. We need to talk.

227
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You two go ahead.

228
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:34,430
Do you think Seon-u rushed over
after what he saw on the field?

229
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:37,400
-Because Ri-an kissed He-ra?
-Mm-hmm.

230
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,440
Where do you think he took her?
She's okay, right?

231
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,820
By the way,
have you ever been on a motorcycle?

232
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,070
Mm-mm.

233
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,460
He-ra.

234
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,670
"Get on"? "We need to talk"?

235
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,300
How dare you! It's embarrassing.

236
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,510
You like Ri-an?
What happened to… to me and you?

237
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,420
Why are you so curious?

238
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:07,130
I'm warning you, Seon-u.

239
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,720
Don't overstep your boundaries.

240
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,930
Then why did you sleep with me
when you don't even like me?

241
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:24,940
'Cause the girls wanted to know
about the cute new student.

242
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,280
Fit and fresh meat.

243
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:30,280
They were all wondering
what you'd be like in bed. So I found out.

244
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:31,740
Are you happy?

245
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,370
Are you serious right now?

246
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,540
'Cause I'm… I'm really into you.

247
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,210
Ooh, and why is that?
'Cause we slept together?

248
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,750
If that's why, you're awfully selfish.

249
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,420
It was mediocre. That night.

250
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,760
You're a total bitch, He-ra.

251
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,140
You're a good judge of character.
So leave me alone already.

252
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:53,930
I'm gonna let Ri-an know
that we slept together!

253
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:54,850
Do it!

254
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,930
Whatever will make you go away.

255
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:02,360
Are you all right, miss?

256
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,400
Is your GPS broken or something?

257
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,150
You know I left school forever ago.

258
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:09,280
Leave him alone.

259
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:27,920
KIM RI-AN, YOON HE-RA, LEE WOO-JIN,
JUNG JAE-I, CHOI YUN-SEOK

260
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:30,930
DOWNLOADING FIVE FOLDERS
TO YEAR 2, CLASS 2

261
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,970
JOOSHIN HIGH SCHOOL

262
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:41,870
She's waiting for you, ma'am.

263
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:49,880
I don't think you have
anything to be worried about.

264
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:53,430
Rest assured, our staff
keeps a close eye on Ri-an

265
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:57,140
and is carefully overseeing
all aspects of his well-being.

266
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,430
Let's host a parents' night soon.

267
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,770
Will you be in attendance?

268
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:04,230
I wonder if it's a delayed adolescence.

269
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:06,770
Ri-an said the strangest thing to me.

270
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:10,030
He said he wanted
a bit more parental care.

271
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:14,200
I don't know what he's complaining about
with so many people waiting on him.

272
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,320
If it's attention he wants,
I'll give it to him.

273
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:20,370
After all, it's the role of the parent
to meet their child's needs.

274
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:21,790
You're extraordinary.

275
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:26,750
Despite being incredibly busy,
your first priority is still your child.

276
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,540
You have my utmost respect.

277
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:31,210
Let's have
our affiliated companies attend.

278
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,630
We can take care of
any minor business deals while I'm there.

279
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,800
Consider it as good as done, ma'am.

280
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:42,970
Hey, I'm here.

281
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:49,230
Hey, Tae-ho.

282
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,980
How've you been?

283
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:54,950
It's weird. This feels like

284
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:56,780
the old days.

285
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,410
Let's head inside. Hmm?

286
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:02,370
We can catch up over food.

287
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,460
Get your dirty hands off me,
you charity case!

288
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,500
Hey, Tae-ho.

289
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,260
"The only son of Jaeyul Hotel."

290
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,130
That's how they all know me.

291
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:21,100
No one there knows
where I actually come from.

292
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,350
That's why I avoided you.

293
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,390
Well, you

294
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,140
and In-han.

295
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:29,900
Look, I get it.

296
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,820
You still tried to help,
and that's what matters.

297
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:39,360
And I know that you sent
the same note to In-han.

298
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,450
Why'd you come to Jooshin?

299
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,330
And what's going on with Jae-i and you?

300
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,000
Don't do anything dangerous.

301
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,250
I don't know if Jae-i's trying
to rile up Ri-an or what,

302
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:51,380
but those two have been together
for a very long time.

303
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,380
I know.

304
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,840
That's why I wanted
to get up close and personal.

305
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,550
So you're… messing with Ri-an

306
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,340
on purpose.

307
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:04,510
In-han called me, you know.

308
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:08,890
So I know this wasn't an accident.

309
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:13,650
But not even the police
can figure out who did it to him.

310
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,110
Just said it was a hit-and-run.

311
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:20,320
So what can you possibly do if even
the police can't do anything about it?

312
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:21,570
Collect evidence.

313
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,200
Alcohol, drugs, bullying.

314
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,290
The people who did that to In-han,
Kim Ri-an included,

315
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,420
I'm going to expose everything
they're getting away with.

316
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,250
So, Tae-ho, I need your help here.

317
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,340
Wha… what could I do?

318
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:40,090
Get me Kim Ri-an's locker code.

319
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,340
The code?

320
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:44,760
Choi Yun-seok is
supplying drugs to Kim Ri-an.

321
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:47,060
I'm sure there's something
in that locker to prove that.

322
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,600
I can't get close to those guys,
but you can.

323
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,610
Honestly,

324
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:56,230
I know you're right, but I'm just

325
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,110
a little scared.

326
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,400
Please help me out.

327
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:02,530
Help me.

328
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,180
So,

329
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,470
what did you want to say?

330
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,980
What are you doing dragging He-ra into it?

331
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:23,990
If I remember… we are now in a place where

332
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:27,490
who I'm seeing isn't any of
your business anymore, right?

333
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:29,700
Come on, Ri-an.

334
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:30,910
YOON HE-RA

335
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:41,420
Did you get home all right?
I just wanted to talk to you.

336
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:43,510
Are you free right now?

337
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,550
Come over.

338
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,800
We can talk here.

339
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:04,440
You're going to his home? This late?

340
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:07,320
I just called to talk to him.
You know, just to have a little chat.

341
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:10,490
And he said come over.

342
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,660
That's wild.

343
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,910
You don't… you don't think
you're moving too fast?

344
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:15,960
Do I look okay?

345
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,830
I think I'm getting
some nighttime face bloat.

346
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,880
Mm-mm. You're gorgeous.
You're smoking hot.

347
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,880
So pretty.

348
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,880
-Yeah? Mmm.
-Yes!

349
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,970
Meongnyang, isn't He-ra super pretty?

350
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:29,010
Yeah, she's gorgeous. Mmm.

351
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:31,140
Good boy. You're so smart.

352
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,600
I'll call you later, okay?

353
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:53,120
You got here fast.

354
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,750
Jae-i! Hi!

355
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:04,090
Uh, Ri-an invited me over out of the blue.
I needed to talk to him, so…

356
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:07,300
I was gonna call him out about today.

357
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:10,930
I know your relationship has been
on the rocks, but that was uncalled-for.

358
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,310
I mean, especially 'cause
you and I are best friends.

359
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:17,310
Don't worry, Jae-i.
I'll give him a piece of my mind.

360
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,310
Don't play along
with Ri-an's little games.

361
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:34,580
"Little games?"

362
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:05,650
It's been quite a while.

363
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:07,780
I know.

364
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,530
The lobby is a lot nicer
than I remember it.

365
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:12,280
I'll show you inside. Follow me.

366
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:00,040
Are you going
to kill this one too?

367
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:11,920
You're sure you did?

368
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,720
Yes, I'm sure.

369
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:18,180
I checked twice.
No, three times. I'm absolutely sure.

370
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:22,180
When he finds out,
he'll hide me away like my mom.

371
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:27,690
These aren't
just empty threats. I have everything.

372
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:30,320
This and also that.

373
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,780
What do you want from me?

374
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:48,040
What?

375
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:52,510
Dad's looking for you.

376
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,010
Have you decided on what to wear?

377
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,680
You mean for Parents' Night?

378
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,350
Chairman Park of the Gongseong Group
will be there.

379
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,020
Their second child is
a student at Jooshin.

380
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,400
I've heard of him. He's a first-year.

381
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,900
Well, his oldest boy lives in New York.

382
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:15,400
We've been discussing it for a while.

383
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:18,200
I think it's time that the two households
get to know each other.

384
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,070
We'll speak to Chairman Park on the night

385
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,290
and arrange a formal gathering
for the near future.

386
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:25,120
Appa… I'm not ready.

387
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,250
Jae-i.

388
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,170
This has been in the works
since your mother was pregnant.

389
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,550
Since the moment
we found out you were a girl.

390
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:36,550
This isn't just about you.

391
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:41,430
This is going to affect the way
Jaeyul Group's entire business is run.

392
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:45,140
I understand what you're saying.
I do, but--

393
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:48,190
Their scale and
business potential align well with ours.

394
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,360
He's the perfect match, so be careful

395
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,190
to ensure nothing gets
in the way of your role

396
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,400
and its obligations.

397
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:59,200
And be especially careful
of who you associate with.

398
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:03,660
Or anything you might do
that could stir up gossip about you.

399
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,290
'Cause you know…

400
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:09,370
I won't have it.

401
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:39,570
What are you doing here?

402
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:40,860
I was waiting for you.

403
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:42,910
How about I take you today?

404
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,590
Ah! The breeze feels good, right?

405
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:03,640
This reminds me of the Healing Forest
when we rode that bike together.

406
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,380
Let's stop. Grab a bite to eat.

407
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,470
-Thank you.
-Absolutely. Please enjoy.

408
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:53,230
Here.

409
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,520
Trust me. This is gonna blow your mind.

410
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:57,440
It's so good.

411
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:05,160
Don't like me.

412
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,120
What?

413
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,740
I'm not really into you,
so you shouldn't like me either.

414
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:15,040
The time I spend with you
is purely out of goodwill.

415
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:19,840
I don't wanna see
one more person getting hurt.

416
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,050
Not because of me.

417
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:27,890
Everyone targeted by Ri-an
eventually left.

418
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:30,600
You're a target now.
So if I don't save you,

419
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:33,060
you'll be like the others.

420
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:38,020
That's why I'm helping you.
That's all there is.

421
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:40,860
So stick to your role,
and don't overplay your hand.

422
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,490
Don't mistake… my goodwill
as something else.

423
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,160
No, I got it.

424
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,370
I know what my role is.

425
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,250
I won't overplay anything.
But still, can I worry about you?

426
00:36:58,670 --> 00:36:59,630
You worry?

427
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:00,920
Yeah, I'm concerned.

428
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:02,710
You seem vulnerable.

429
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,420
Even now, you seem that way.

430
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:08,050
Your expression is cold and indifferent.

431
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:12,140
But your eyes tell me otherwise.

432
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,730
You're lonely and afraid.

433
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,780
How was that for performing my part?

434
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:31,870
Since my current role is
playing Jung Jae-i's boyfriend.

435
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:36,120
What kind of terrible boyfriend would I be
if I didn't care about your feelings?

436
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,250
Hmm? Don't you think?

437
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:05,110
Good morning, Ms. He-ra.

438
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,570
-Hello, He-ra.
-Hi.

439
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:07,860
Oh, hi, He-ra.

440
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,160
JAE-I

441
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,670
Hi, Jae-i.

442
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:32,300
It's crazy, actually.
'Cause I've been meaning to call you.

443
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,600
What happened with the thing I asked you?

444
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:38,730
What? What thing?

445
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,810
The anonymous account.

446
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:42,690
Ah!

447
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:45,900
Oh. I've found someone
who can track it down.

448
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,610
They said it'd be hard
to figure out the account holder.

449
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:51,740
I told them to track the location
if they couldn't track down the owner.

450
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,530
Spill.

451
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:58,080
-Huh?
-I said spill it.

452
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:02,120
Tell me why you said
you've been "meaning to call."

453
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:10,260
I feel bad. I'm sorry.

454
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,340
Bad? For what?

455
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:14,760
I'm your best friend.

456
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:17,640
I can't be doing this.

457
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,350
I tried convincing him, and I even yelled.

458
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:22,270
I tried everything possible.

459
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,900
But Ri-an is too hardheaded.

460
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,730
He was struggling so much
after your breakup.

461
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:31,200
I just couldn't bring myself
to tell him no.

462
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,910
I'm worried of what he might do
if I refuse him.

463
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,660
I know that you might get hurt, Jae-i.

464
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:41,250
It won't hurt me, He-ra.

465
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,420
I just…

466
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,380
won't allow it.

467
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:51,050
Won't allow what?

468
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:54,390
You can't just start going out
with my ex all of a sudden

469
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,550
now that he's single.

470
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:04,560
I mean, you have to be aware you're not
really a good match for him, are you?

471
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,940
Remember what I told you?

472
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,400
I said not to play along
with Ri-an's little games.

473
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,070
Hopefully, by now,
you'll understand what I meant.

474
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:20,700
Get the anonymous account issue
resolved ASAP.

475
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,590
Not a good match for Ri-an, huh?

476
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,360
Isn't this a gig for your school?
Why are you playing your own event?

477
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,780
Scholarship students aren't invited.

478
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:55,820
They really aren't?

479
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,450
No.

480
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:00,990
I guess… we're just special like that.

481
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:04,330
It's an event for parents and students,
but they invite the rich kids and not you?

482
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:05,620
What kind of school is that?

483
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,500
I think it's good.

484
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:10,880
'Cause those events are awkward,
and I'd rather make money, you know?

485
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,380
I'm good.

486
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:14,420
Your tie is crooked again.

487
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:15,970
-Oh.
-In-han was so tidy.

488
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:17,510
He'd never let this fly.

489
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:20,260
Hey.

490
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:22,600
This is all his fault, you know?

491
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,480
He always did it for me.
How does it look now?

492
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:28,270
There we are. Good!

493
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,690
This is a Valentino dress.

494
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:36,740
A classic minimalist red dress
with a statement zipper.

495
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,240
This mini dress here
is Prada's newest release.

496
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,160
It has an elegant, timeless design

497
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,580
and would be well-suited
to Ms. Jae-i's figure.

498
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,250
That one will be perfect.

499
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:58,970
Yes, I think
these will look really nice on you.

500
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:15,480
There you are.

501
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:17,900
I approve.

502
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,410
Your expression
is cold and indifferent,

503
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:24,120
but your eyes tell me otherwise.

504
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,580
You're lonely and afraid.

505
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,420
I trust that all the preparations
are in order?

506
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:53,860
Sweetheart. Are you seeing someone?

507
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,690
Why are you so dolled up tonight?

508
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,280
Keep your eyes peeled.

509
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:00,400
See if you can figure out
my secret boyfriend.

510
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:03,120
Oh, I'll keep 'em wide open.
I'll find that punk.

511
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:12,420
Is Jae-i's father… also gonna be there?

512
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,500
I think so. Ri-an's mother is as well.

513
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:18,590
And you said
that you and Jae-i are best friends?

514
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:21,680
Well, I'd say we are.

515
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:24,470
Would it be all right

516
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:28,020
if your dad could take advantage
of that connection?

517
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:32,850
What do you mean by that?

518
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,110
Uh… my company was
working on a deal with Jooshin.

519
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:41,740
It didn't go well.

520
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:43,280
You said it was an important deal.

521
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:46,240
That's why I'm thinking
of approaching Jaeyul.

522
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:48,540
Chairman Jung is well-known

523
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:51,500
for not interacting with people
who aren't on his level.

524
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,630
But because he'll be there tonight,
I was hoping you and Jae-i

525
00:43:56,710 --> 00:44:00,170
might be able to arrange
a casual introduction?

526
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:05,470
I'll speak to Jae-i about it.

527
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:21,900
Jae-i.

528
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:28,530
Oh, I came here for some work.

529
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:29,790
Another piano gig.

530
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,330
Wow, you look so incredible tonight.

531
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:36,960
Oh, hold on.

532
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:40,210
You have a stray hair right here.

533
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:46,300
Why are you doing this?

534
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,560
I know my reason for keeping you around.

535
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:52,770
So what's yours?

536
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:56,310
You say I'm pretty,
and you're worried about me.

537
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:00,190
Why say those things
when no one's around to hear them?

538
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:04,780
There is none.

539
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,240
No real reason.

540
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:10,700
Just 'cause.

541
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:14,290
I'm saying those things 'cause
you're pretty, and I worry about you.

542
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:16,540
Whenever I see you smiling, I think,

543
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,630
"What's behind that smile?"

544
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:21,460
"What is he hiding?"

545
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:25,300
Tell me why I think that.

546
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:39,440
Oh my. Chairwoman An. Welcome.

547
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,400
Mrs. An, have you been well?

548
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,030
You're not busy for once?

549
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:44,900
You've never come to
a school event before.

550
00:45:44,990 --> 00:45:46,200
My son said

551
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:49,240
he needed a bit more parental care.

552
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,490
I'm giving it to him.

553
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:56,210
Good evening, Mrs. An.

554
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:58,120
-Welcome, Mrs. An
-Good evening.

555
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:00,830
Do you see it?

556
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:04,300
The depth of love and care
I'm showering you with?

557
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:08,590
All these people here
are our countless affiliates.

558
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:11,850
It's something no other parent
in the world can offer their child.

559
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:15,140
And I will bequeath
every last one to you, Ri-an.

560
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,480
Now and in the future,

561
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:28,900
Jooshin will not only lead the way
putting noblesse oblige into action

562
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:32,570
but also help our students grow
into upstanding young leaders

563
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:35,080
in both character and intellect.

564
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:53,260
All right, then.

565
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:55,930
I propose a toast.

566
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:59,350
To both Jooshin
and to our children's future!

567
00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:01,730
Cheers!

568
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:06,780
That Bulgari necklace
Ri-an's mom is wearing

569
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:08,240
is, like, a hundred million.

570
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,400
A hundred million?

571
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:12,160
Wait, then with her earrings and necklace,
how much is that outfit?

572
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,120
She's on another level.

573
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:17,540
The Van Cleef Yun-seok's mother has,
you couldn't even pay for.

574
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,750
Are you two just gonna stay here
all night stuffing your faces, huh?

575
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:24,880
Why don't you get out there and network?

576
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,250
I mean, they all look kinda busy.

577
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:31,720
Go. Didn't I always emphasize
the importance of making connections?

578
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,180
With who? Ugh.

579
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:34,640
-No, Mom.
-Why are you so clueless?

580
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,220
I really don't want to.

581
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:00,750
He-ra.

582
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,170
Can I have a word?

583
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,420
-Be right back.
-Okay.

584
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:16,050
Have you seen Jae-i? Did you ask her?

585
00:48:17,550 --> 00:48:18,390
Not yet, no.

586
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:20,270
I'll ask her now.

587
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:25,690
Oh, Jae-i.

588
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:32,990
My dad's looking for a second with yours.
He wants to say hi

589
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:35,160
and talk to him about something.

590
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:37,240
It's been a while, Jae-i.

591
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:42,500
I heard Chairman Jung was here,
so I was hoping we could chat.

592
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:44,330
You and He-ra are such close friends,

593
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:47,830
and yet I don't think he and I have ever
gotten the chance to meet.

594
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,090
He's a bit busy.

595
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,300
I'll let him know that you said hello.

596
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:08,560
I'm not asking for anything crazy.

597
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:10,150
It's not crazy.

598
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:13,570
I just have no interest in doing it.

599
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:15,570
What?

600
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:18,990
I have no desire… to do you a favor.

601
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:47,310
Your dress.

602
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:50,610
It's beautiful.

603
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,740
So beautiful, I don't wanna fight you.

604
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,450
At least not today.

605
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:58,360
We're not fighting, Kim Ri-an.

606
00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:00,410
Just broken up.

607
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,340
I have nothing
but admiration for you.

608
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:16,670
That you have
such a passion for education.

609
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,840
The future of our children
is the future of this country.

610
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:22,430
We can't just focus
on growing our business.

611
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:27,430
I believe corporations have an obligation
to create a harmonious society.

612
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,690
And I respect you a great deal too.

613
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:33,610
There are so many far-fetched rumors
surrounding Jaeyul and Jooshin,

614
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:37,110
but you sent Ms. Jae-i to us,
for which I'm very grateful.

615
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:41,950
Well, I'm grateful
you welcomed her.

616
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:44,700
I'm so sorry I'm late.

617
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:47,660
-Long time no see.
-Indeed, Chairman Park.

618
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:49,290
Welcome.

619
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:51,460
You're as glamorous as ever.

620
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:52,380
Thank you.

621
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:54,920
-I trust you're well.
-Yes. You?

622
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,630
It's been far too long.

623
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:22,160
Over here, Jae-i.

624
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,320
Say hello.

625
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:28,410
My name is Jung Jae-i.
It's nice to meet you.

626
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:31,330
Nice to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you, Ms. Jae-i.

627
00:51:32,370 --> 00:51:35,460
Well, seeing such a good-looking
young man and woman together

628
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:37,250
has got my wheels spinning.

629
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:39,130
If the two families were to become one,

630
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:41,720
it would be the union
of Jooshin and Jaeyul.

631
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,720
No one else in Korea
could wield that much power.

632
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:49,600
Is that so? We should consider
our children's desires.

633
00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:52,690
We can't just think about
our business interests.

634
00:51:52,770 --> 00:51:55,110
Don't think
it would make a wonderful story?

635
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:58,570
"Two competing corporations become one
through the love of their children."

636
00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:00,240
It is a great story.

637
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:04,280
But what usually makes stories great
is because they're far from reality.

638
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:06,620
And I know they're rarely ever true.

639
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:10,000
Maybe not, but I've heard rumors
that make me think, never say never.

640
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:14,880
I heard that Mr. Ri-an and Ms. Jae-i here
are in a relationship already.

641
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:24,220
That isn't true.

642
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:26,680
I'm sure it's mere gossip that arose

643
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:29,810
from two high-profile children
attending the same school.

644
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:30,970
Ri-an, isn't that so?

645
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:37,480
It's such preposterous gossip.

646
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:40,150
Above all else, our main intention

647
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:44,200
is to match our son with a family
who shares similar values with Jooshin.

648
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,820
We're committed to upholding traditions
and giving back.

649
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:50,240
Meanwhile,
Jaeyul prioritizes profits overall.

650
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:53,120
In essence, we have very different goals.

651
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:57,170
The two corporations
are like night and day.

652
00:52:57,250 --> 00:53:00,380
If growth potential
was your main priority, for example,

653
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:02,170
there's no reason for the Jaeyul Group

654
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:04,930
to even consider merging
with a stagnating Jooshin.

655
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:09,800
It appears I've broached
a sensitive subject. I apologize.

656
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:10,970
Excuse me.

657
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:12,430
Hope to see you again soon.

658
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:47,720
Ri-an will never let go of Jae-i.
Unlike me, he doesn't get bored.

659
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:51,550
And unlike you, he actually knows
the difference between love and greed.

660
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,600
You're off the rails these days.
I'm worried about you, honestly.

661
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,650
-You still have a thing for me?
-Whoa! What are you--

662
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:00,770
If not, then just stay out of my business.

663
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:14,200
It's been a long time.

664
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:16,250
You remember me, don't you?

665
00:54:16,330 --> 00:54:17,750
Of course. Hello, dear.

666
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:22,380
Well, I have someone who's been waiting
to introduce himself to you,

667
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:23,550
but he's very shy.

668
00:54:24,050 --> 00:54:25,130
And who's that?

669
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:27,050
After all, I'm Jae-i's friend.

670
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:30,680
It's only right to help her out.
Wouldn't you say?

671
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:32,890
Yoon He-ra.

672
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:37,520
Hmm.

673
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:41,060
Meet Jae-i's boyfriend.

674
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:48,280
He's living proof our school motto works.

675
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:51,530
It's noblesse oblige in action.
Carrying on our tradition.

676
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:56,830
The pride of Jooshin. A scholarship kid.

677
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:16,390
Don't be shy. Say hello, Kang Ha.
