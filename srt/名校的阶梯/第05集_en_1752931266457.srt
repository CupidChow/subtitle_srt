1
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,960
HIERARCHY

2
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,210
He was…

3
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:19,970
…my brother.

4
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,190
The person you just said you killed…

5
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,520
was my brother.

6
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,340
You stupid
fucking scholarship kids.

7
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,630
Wait, he hit Ri-an?

8
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,380
Oh yeah. He's dead, for sure.

9
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,050
Are you insane, dude?

10
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,760
You good? You all right?

11
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,930
He must be insane.

12
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,720
Ri-an looks pissed.

13
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:11,270
You nuts, douchebag?
Throwing that ball at Ri-an.

14
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,440
It rolled over here.
So I figured I'd throw it back.

15
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,450
I didn't know that it would hit him.
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:18,820
Are you blind, dude?

17
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:20,820
Are you mental?

18
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:24,660
'Cause if the ball rolled towards you,
you should've brought it over here.

19
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,500
You don't ever throw it at Ri-an, okay?

20
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,960
Are you glaring at me?

21
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:37,590
You should be begging all day,
and you're glaring?

22
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,760
Who the hell
do you think you are?

23
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,850
-Acting up? Piece of shit!
-How dare you!

24
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,390
-Can't stand you, son of a bitch!
-You're a scholarship student!

25
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,730
-Act like one, damn it!
-Stop it!

26
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,480
Little bitch!

27
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,270
You little--

28
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,230
Crazy fucker!

29
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,530
-What are you waiting for?
-Get him!

30
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,110
Out of the way, idiot!

31
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,620
Over there! Get that asshole!

32
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,450
Run faster, douchebags!

33
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,670
Hey, over there. That way, that way!

34
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,180
Every last dime you were gonna inherit.

35
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,060
You're gonna hand it over.

36
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:34,190
This has actually been
way overdue for quite a while now.

37
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:37,360
You should've been kicked out
with your mother.

38
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,570
And so,

39
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:43,110
really, I'm just trying to recover
what was rightfully mine all along.

40
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,530
Why?

41
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,700
Because you don't deserve
any of it.

42
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,120
You're not worthy.

43
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:55,210
Sign the papers and get it notarized.

44
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,630
That's all I want, really.

45
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,550
How could you do such a thing?

46
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,340
Well, if you have a problem with it,

47
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,470
I'll go to Dad
and show him your little video.

48
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,270
-Jeong Jae-hyeok!
-I'm sure Dad would love it, wouldn't he?

49
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,610
You should think it over.

50
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,620
Let me know what you decide.

51
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,450
Keep the phone.

52
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,160
I have backups.

53
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,290
Do you, uh, want this?

54
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:14,330
When you're having a bad day,
candy makes it easier.

55
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,910
Here, have one.

56
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,090
You guys are quite similar,
don't you think?

57
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,720
Huh?

58
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,320
The person you just said you killed

59
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:27,490
was my brother.

60
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,040
You…

61
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,660
lied about who you were.

62
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,540
'Cause I had to find out
what exactly happened here.

63
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,500
What my brother endured at Jooshin High.

64
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,250
Why they covered it up.

65
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,260
Why the school was so obsessed,

66
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:50,010
trying to keep it so quiet.

67
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,520
Jae-i, my brother wasn't killed
in a simple hit-and-run.

68
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,140
There's gotta be a reason.

69
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,310
In-han was in the street.

70
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,850
The night of the accident.

71
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,860
So that's what you really wanted.

72
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,900
More information.

73
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:07,940
That's right.

74
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,620
At first, I did, but not now.

75
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,620
When I first came here, I was thinking
that it could've been anyone.

76
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,450
"Who bullied my brother,
and who killed him?" I really had to know.

77
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:22,580
But in search for my answers,
and as I spent more time with you,

78
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,840
I got to know the real Jae-i.

79
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:29,630
When I said I wanted to make you smile
and be by your side,

80
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,300
I meant every last word.

81
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,510
But don't forget…

82
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,600
he was my family.

83
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:43,100
I need to find out how my one
and only brother was killed.

84
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,280
So, Jae-i, I…

85
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,160
…I need your help.

86
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,910
Jae-i.

87
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,210
Jae-i!

88
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,640
You lay a finger on her again,
and I'll break it.

89
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,810
You're brothers? You and In-han?

90
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,560
Yeah. Now it's all coming together.

91
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:30,490
Now I can see why you kept bothering me
and why you approached Jae-i.

92
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,860
What? Did you want revenge?

93
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,660
So you did something…

94
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,540
that would deserve it, Kim Ri-an.

95
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,840
What?

96
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,340
What do you want?

97
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,800
To end up like your brother?

98
00:07:58,850 --> 00:07:59,760
My what?

99
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,580
-Lower your damn hands!
-Damn scholarship kid!

100
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:29,040
Move your hands,
or I'll move 'em for you! Come on!

101
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:32,090
He deserves way more
than the ass-kicking we're giving him!

102
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:38,840
Did that hurt?

103
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,720
All right, come on. Get up.

104
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,690
What the hell?
Jeez, you ruined the shot!

105
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,480
-Come on.
-In-han!

106
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,840
Stop it.

107
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,760
THE LATE KANG IN-HAN

108
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,270
Stop it.

109
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,520
Stop!

110
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,650
I said, stop!

111
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:40,740
Please. I just…

112
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,870
…I just want you to stop.

113
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:51,250
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

114
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,960
I shouldn't have left you alone.

115
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,920
I should've been here.
Here, right by your side.

116
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,090
I'm sorry.

117
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:16,940
EPISODE 5
OUTSTANDING OUTSIDERS: THE KANGS

118
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:33,250
FROM KANG HA

119
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,170
KANG IN-HAN

120
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,220
I wish you were here…

121
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,260
to help me understand what's…

122
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:45,890
what's going on.

123
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,320
So you're saying Kang Ha is
Kang In-han's younger brother?

124
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,870
Apparently, they're twins.
Yeah, fraternal.

125
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,700
-They were twin brothers?
-Yep.

126
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,700
'Cause they were twins,

127
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:10,580
Kang Ha was adopted by his
childless uncle and lived with him,

128
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,290
which is how it went
over the school's head

129
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:14,750
'cause they lived
at completely different addresses.

130
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,920
Adopted by his uncle?

131
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,260
I thought stuff like that
only happened on TV.

132
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,510
Between us,

133
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:23,840
isn't it weird that
Kang In-han's brother came here?

134
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:26,970
He kept acting clueless
and getting on Ri-an's last nerve.

135
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,680
He also got closer to Jae-i, right?

136
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:31,850
He's up to something.

137
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:32,940
Think so?

138
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:36,270
Maybe he suspected something was up.

139
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:41,150
The accident that day was very bizarre.
A lot of weirdness there.

140
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,830
Go ahead, Ms. Han.

141
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,920
With your current grades,
Hanguk High School has agreed

142
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:04,380
to give you a full scholarship
and monetary support until graduation.

143
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,930
At Daehan High School,

144
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,800
students who graduate
at the top of their class

145
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,760
get complete college tuition.

146
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,690
A school scholarship.

147
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,520
Sorry, but I already
have all of these perks.

148
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,980
Graduating top of class here
has more benefits.

149
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,900
I worked my butt off to come to Jooshin.

150
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,620
Kang Ha, the school cannot stand by

151
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,950
and allow one single student
to disrupt the study environment.

152
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,910
Our duty is to look after
the mental health of our students.

153
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
A duty we take quite seriously.

154
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,250
And in what way am I negatively affecting
their mental health, exactly?

155
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,590
Every time they look at you,

156
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,180
they won't be able to see
anything else but In-han.

157
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:53,270
You would only serve to be
a constant reminder of their trauma.

158
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,350
Bringing up In-han is taboo.

159
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:00,900
Trauma?

160
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:04,860
"Taboo"?

161
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:08,320
If you won't transfer, we'll expel you.
It would be easy to justify.

162
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,490
Scholarship students
are outsiders here at Jooshin.

163
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,580
So getting rid of one outsider…

164
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,700
Well, no one would bat an eye.

165
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,920
The choice is yours.

166
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,710
Transfer or expulsion.

167
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,190
I don't want either.

168
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,610
You see, I'm gonna prove myself by being
the first to graduate with top grades

169
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,320
as a scholarship recipient.

170
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,160
And I'll show these guys

171
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,950
what is truly fair
and prove that they're not special.

172
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,580
And I'll show them what's right and wrong.

173
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,380
Someone has to.

174
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,460
Because not a single adult here

175
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,430
is teaching them that.

176
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,010
Kang Ha.

177
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,100
Scholarship student Kang Ha
of Class Two, Year Two.

178
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,560
Please process his expulsion, Ms. Han.

179
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:23,940
The reasoning? A disruptive student
who threatens the school's well-being.

180
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:26,530
Try it.

181
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,500
It would be easy to justify.

182
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,250
Scholarship students
are outsiders here at Jooshin.

183
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,300
So getting rid of one outsider…

184
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,680
Well, no one would bat an eye.

185
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,090
If you can, I mean.

186
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,520
Jeez.
I can't believe this is happening.

187
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,110
That scholarship dick
really pisses me off.

188
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:07,570
You should've taken care of him
when I told you to.

189
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:09,400
I mean, you know I wanted to.

190
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,030
But, you know, Jae-i was acting weird.

191
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:18,580
Well, she won't be involved from now on.

192
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,370
So make sure you finish the job.

193
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,710
For real? I'd be happy to.

194
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,130
Makes my job way easier.

195
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,500
I've been noticing he's been making

196
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,590
the other scholarship students
get ballsier.

197
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,800
We'll put them in their place.

198
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,010
She couldn't even stand up?

199
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,100
No.

200
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,060
I've never seen her like that.

201
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,770
Her face.
She looked so scared and helpless.

202
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:45,060
Don't you think there's a reason for it?

203
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,110
"A reason"?

204
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:49,610
For Jae-i suddenly leaving the country.

205
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:54,860
For why she broke up with you
and pushed you away.

206
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,580
There has to be a reason for it.

207
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,200
Well, it doesn't really matter why.

208
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:03,460
I'm only focused on one thing from now on.

209
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,710
Protecting her.

210
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm never gonna abandon her.

211
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,460
I'll stay by her side.

212
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,670
What about He-ra?

213
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,180
She asked you to be her boyfriend.

214
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,810
She has you.

215
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:24,270
I can be her friend, and you can be more.

216
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,810
I think that's a pretty good deal,
don't you?

217
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,460
The two of us getting married,

218
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:55,380
it's something I think will benefit both
the Jaeyul Group and the Gongseong Group.

219
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,180
It's not a bad idea. Mm.

220
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,890
Not much longer till we leave.
Are you making it count?

221
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:11,360
Yes. You could say that.

222
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:16,110
Still won't carry a conversation.

223
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:17,780
You'll need to get used to it.

224
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,740
I mean… considering

225
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,120
when we get to New York,

226
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,700
we'll be seeing a lot of each other.

227
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,500
I'm getting out.

228
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,800
See you at the airport.

229
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,570
Why are you here, Ri-an?

230
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,660
Let's walk together.

231
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,870
So do you feel a little better?

232
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:07,960
I do.

233
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,130
From now on,
don't go anywhere without security.

234
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,630
Especially at school.

235
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,630
Don't leave my side for even a moment.

236
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,670
Why? You worried Kang Ha will kill me?

237
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,300
We have no idea…
what kids like that are capable of.

238
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,680
"Kids like that"?

239
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,140
Don't talk about him that way.

240
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:27,680
You know scholarship students aren't
any different than the rest of us.

241
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,940
Have you really not learned anything?

242
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,570
You saw I was with Seon-jun.

243
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,360
We're leaving for New York together.

244
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:43,660
I barely got permission
to go to school until I leave.

245
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:47,240
So don't visit or call out of the blue
like this and mess it up for me.

246
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,160
I don't want any more trouble.

247
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,420
I can't. I won't let you go, Jae-i.

248
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,830
Did you forget? We're not a thing.

249
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,500
I broke up with you.
I don't know why that's not clear to you.

250
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:59,760
Even if I were to stay,

251
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,180
we're not getting back together.

252
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,010
Can you at least tell me why?

253
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,560
When we're together,

254
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,890
everything we touch gets destroyed.

255
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:14,190
I don't know
if it's your fault or mine anymore.

256
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:18,070
At this rate, we'll drag each other down
and mess the other up.

257
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:20,320
And I'm so tired of hurting people.

258
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,240
So just stop it.

259
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,660
No. I won't accept it.

260
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,830
These people?

261
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,910
I don't care what happens to others.

262
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,920
Protecting you is all that matters to me.

263
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:36,540
Kim Ri-an.

264
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:40,010
I thought about it nonstop
while we were separated.

265
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:43,380
Is it even possible for us to stay away?

266
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,640
The answer? Of course not.

267
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,180
So I've concluded…
I need to keep you by my side

268
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,230
through thick and thin,

269
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,810
no matter where it takes us.

270
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,940
I don't care,

271
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,070
even at the end of the world.

272
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,570
I'd rather spend it by your side.

273
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,740
This is way more than "like."

274
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,910
This is "love"

275
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:13,960
Jung Jae-i, I…

276
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,920
I love you.

277
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,460
Well, I don't.

278
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,420
I don't feel the same way.

279
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,610
Wait.
Why are you telling me that now?

280
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,990
Well, I was young back then.

281
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,610
Oh my God! You're ridiculous!

282
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,360
I saw that
you couldn't find it.

283
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:48,530
-But hey, it worked out for me.
-Oh, honestly!

284
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,200
I swear, I'm telling you!

285
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,130
That's hilarious.

286
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,590
Hey, Jung Jae-i!

287
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:12,680
Gosh.

288
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,430
I was so worried
when I heard you passed out.

289
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,600
Are you feeling better now?

290
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,980
I was surprised
when I heard you were leaving.

291
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,440
It was all so sudden.

292
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,280
Wow.

293
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,450
What a beautiful friendship. Really.

294
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,570
All right, you two, have a good time now.

295
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,830
See you, He-ra.

296
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,710
What are you doing here?

297
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,340
Delivering… an invitation.

298
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,590
We're still seen as best friends
by the public.

299
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:50,220
So I should at least
throw you a farewell party.

300
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,760
"Farewell"?

301
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,970
Sure it's not a celebration?

302
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,600
Well, I guess
it could be a celebration, yeah.

303
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:03,940
Depending on Ri-an's answer.
I told him… how I felt.

304
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,190
Congrats. I hope that works out for you.

305
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,490
Are we done here?

306
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:10,360
Don't get in between us.

307
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:12,910
What?

308
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:16,580
I'm saying don't rile him up
or get him confused.

309
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,000
I'm not even asking for your help.

310
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,420
I just want you to
stay out of my way, okay?

311
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,790
You can do that until you fly out, right?

312
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,090
And… you should,
even if you don't want to.

313
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,840
If you don't,
I might have to cause trouble.

314
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,390
What kind of trouble?

315
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:37,640
I do have something
I can give you that you might like.

316
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,140
How do I put it?

317
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:42,650
This is something…
that would give you the upper hand.

318
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:45,230
Now, what on earth
could give me the upper hand?

319
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,480
Call me intrigued.

320
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,940
You'll probably be shocked
when you find out.

321
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,070
Hmm.

322
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,870
But, you know, um,

323
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,040
if I give that to you…

324
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,750
what do I get in return?

325
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,630
No idea. Yeah, I don't know just yet.

326
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:10,760
But whatever it is,
I'll make sure it's worth your while.

327
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,340
Whenever you want,

328
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,640
however you want it.

329
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:22,440
I'm going to do whatever it takes.

330
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,730
I'm not bluffing.

331
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:25,900
I will literally do whatever it takes,

332
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:29,230
whether you, Ri-an,
or all of us get hurt. I don't care.

333
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,120
I forgot to tell you something funny.

334
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:43,830
The day we ended our friendship…

335
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,420
Well, on the way home, I cried.

336
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,340
I guess we really were friends deep down.

337
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:57,510
So, even though our friendship is over,
I hope we can end it on good terms.

338
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,970
Just leave quietly with your dignity

339
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,770
so this doesn't get messy.

340
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,440
Understand me?

341
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,770
See you at the party.

342
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,360
Yoon He-ra.

343
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,290
I wish you well.

344
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:42,060
Would that be enough… to give you closure?

345
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:46,140
The day of your party
is the day I fly out.

346
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,940
Enjoy your celebration.

347
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,730
I'll get out of your way.

348
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,280
"Enjoy your celebration"?

349
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:04,620
She always has to have
the last word, doesn't she?

350
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,290
You never know.
It might've been a sincere goodbye.

351
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:09,960
She wasn't being sincere.
She was taunting me.

352
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,340
Basically saying, "Have fun without me."

353
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,340
I can't stand her.

354
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:16,550
Well then,
I guess I'll teach her a lesson.

355
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:18,550
How dare she annoy my darling He-ra.

356
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,890
Huh?

357
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,060
Hey, Dad.

358
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:28,650
Listen. I want this party
to be the best party ever.

359
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:33,190
Right down to location, DJ, my jewelry.
Everything perfect and beautiful.

360
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:40,240
All right. Tell you what.
I'll get Mr. Park on the line, okay?

361
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,620
Are you serious?

362
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,410
You're my favorite.
What would I do without you?

363
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:01,340
Tae-ho.

364
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,430
This is fucking insane.
You gotta be kidding me.

365
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:13,730
This guy's really the oldest son
of the owners of Jaeyul Hotel?

366
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,360
Is your mother really a prostitute?

367
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,820
You're a bastard?

368
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,860
He even lied
about living in the States.

369
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:22,450
His dad abandoned him.

370
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:23,450
He had nothing.

371
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:25,580
He went to the same school
as the Kang brothers.

372
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,290
He got lucky when his dad took him back.

373
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:28,710
Then take this off.

374
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,120
Why are you wearing it?

375
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:31,460
So he's what?

376
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,960
What do we call his kind?

377
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,880
Mom was a prostitute,
but his father is rich.

378
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,340
We need a new name
to describe someone like him.

379
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:41,680
Instead of half-man, half-beast…
Half-rich, half-slut?

380
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,890
Half-slut.

381
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:47,270
Wait. If he and Kang Ha
both went to the same school,

382
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,600
that means he must've known
everything the whole time.

383
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:52,400
Yeah, he sure did.

384
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,520
So you were trying to trick us all along?

385
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:57,400
Well…

386
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,150
-Well, the thing is--
-Jesus, he's wasting our time.

387
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,160
Stop stuttering and spit it out.
My fucking god.

388
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,490
Did you have fun trying
to make fools of us, slut? Huh?

389
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,580
Yo. I asked you a question.

390
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,160
Did you enjoy it?

391
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:12,250
-Huh? Speak up, scumbag. Was it fun?
-I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

392
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,380
Huh? Come on.

393
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,590
Why so quiet? Put that down, jeez.

394
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:19,420
Spit it out, douchebag. Was it fun?
Why aren't you answering?

395
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,510
Knock it off.

396
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:23,130
Kang Ha.

397
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:25,970
Hey, look who's here now.

398
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:28,930
It's your old middle school bro.

399
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:38,400
That was one hell of a plot twist, huh?

400
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,440
We were trying to find dirt on you
and dug up something else.

401
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,870
If you stay at this school,
this douchebag's done for.

402
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:48,490
So what'll it be? He's your friend, so…

403
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,290
Sounds like you should leave now.

404
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,620
And then we might let him stay.

405
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,670
-Who the hell are you?
-What?

406
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,470
Who are you to decide who gets to stay?

407
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:05,590
-Jeez, he's popping off again.
-What's he saying this time?

408
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,430
You're just a pathetic lapdog
who bullies people for Kim Ri-an.

409
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,040
Ta-da! Pass these around.

410
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,910
Oh my God! It's so pretty!

411
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,750
Invitations to Jae-i's farewell party.

412
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:37,580
-You're throwing a party for her?
-Of course. I'm her best friend.

413
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:40,630
Try to get as many people
as possible to show up.

414
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,270
What are you gonna wear
to the party?

415
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,770
-That dress from before?
-The pink one?

416
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:58,480
No, let's just go shopping later.

417
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,150
Hey.

418
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:03,230
-Let's just go.
-Okay. Let's do it.

419
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:36,600
You all right?

420
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,830
I'm sorry, Tae-ho.

421
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:04,250
I'll do whatever it takes to make sure
that Choi Yun-seok gets off your back.

422
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,380
How?

423
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,970
Are you going to kill him or something?

424
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,470
Even if you did, then what?

425
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:12,350
Woo-jin, Ri-an, He-ra,

426
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:14,260
Jae-i, Chan-min, Ba-da.

427
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:16,560
-Are you gonna kill them all?
-Tae-ho.

428
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,480
Killing one of them won't end this.

429
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,770
They'll just keep being
the monsters they are.

430
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,030
Let's stop.

431
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,860
We should just call it quits.

432
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:32,990
I need to stay at Jooshin High.
It's what my father wants.

433
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,790
I know how you feel.

434
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,290
I understand what you're going through.

435
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:41,460
I get it.

436
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,670
I'm just so scared, Kang Ha.

437
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,350
I can't help you anymore.

438
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:27,170
YEAR 2, CLASS 2

439
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,070
YOON HE-RA

440
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,780
I really said it.

441
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:04,540
LEE WOO-JIN

442
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:09,250
What's going on?
You're not answering my calls or texts.

443
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,960
Avoiding me, huh?

444
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:49,340
Jae-i, enjoy watching
what happens here from New York

445
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,920
once this is made public.

446
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:56,180
People like you and Ri-an are susceptible
to rumors and controversies, right?

447
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:58,260
Look forward to it.

448
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:17,410
It's someone at school,
whoever sent you those messages.

449
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:22,410
Sent them from Jooshin High.

450
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,720
Oh.

451
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,850
I… I'm sorry.

452
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:46,020
Really sorry.

453
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,720
I thought

454
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,430
you weren't coming to school anymore.

455
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:31,560
I'll tell you…

456
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,650
whatever you want to know…

457
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:38,780
about your brother.

458
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:48,040
We were all out partying.

459
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:52,920
It was Woo-jin's birthday,
and they were bullying In-han,

460
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:56,170
so he ran outside.

461
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:00,800
That's when the accident occurred.

462
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:04,100
He was tortured so much
he couldn't take it.

463
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,220
So much

464
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:08,980
he ran out into the street.

465
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,480
It was them, wasn't it?

466
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,860
Choi Yun-seok, Kim Ri-an.

467
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,190
It wasn't.

468
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:17,860
I know you're suspicious of Ri-an, but…

469
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,320
he wasn't behind it.

470
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:27,450
It was my fault.

471
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,830
If he was never friends with me,

472
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:34,330
then In-han wouldn't have been
bullied by everyone at school.

473
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:43,470
So don't blame anyone else.

474
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,850
Take it out on me.

475
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,280
Please help me.

476
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,700
I'm being blackmailed by someone here.

477
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:06,660
I need to find them before I leave.

478
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:09,410
I don't care if
they're just threatening me.

479
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:11,450
But Ri-an…

480
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:15,750
they're trying to bring him down as well.

481
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:17,460
If it's helping Kim Ri-an,

482
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,800
you'll need to find someone else

483
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,420
'cause I have the same goal

484
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,630
as the person threatening you.

485
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:34,640
You said you would help me
get through all this.

486
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:40,820
If Ri-an falls apart, I'll fall apart too.

487
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,450
I don't want him to get hurt.

488
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,080
And me?

489
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,290
I know it's selfish,

490
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,500
but I can't trust anyone else to help me…

491
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,340
except for you, Kang Ha.

492
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:12,350
I never thought…

493
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:17,020
you could be this cruel to me, Jae-i,

494
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,980
of all the people it could've been.

495
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,530
How could you ask that?

496
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,200
That I help Kim Ri-an.

497
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,950
He won't do it because of me.

498
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:17,710
-Let's go.
-Okay.

499
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:19,500
-Just go.
-I'm so curious.

500
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,680
Well, don't just stand there.

501
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:35,770
Waiting for me?

502
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,930
Open the door.

503
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,090
-Who is it?
-Doesn't matter.

504
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:10,130
Are you dating someone?

505
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:12,430
Don't be ridiculous.

506
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,930
I'm on edge lately.
Don't play games with me.

507
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:19,140
Why is that?

508
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:20,480
Because of Ri-an.

509
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:22,940
Or maybe it's Jae-i.

510
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,310
Or because of you.

511
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,070
What are you saying?

512
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:30,990
You're trying to eat the forbidden fruit,
so you brought this on yourself

513
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,280
because you're being greedy.

514
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,990
Why don't you word it differently?

515
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:38,790
Is it so wrong? To want more?

516
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:44,540
Whereas, on the other hand, you do nothing
to go after what you desire.

517
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:45,750
You never make a move.

518
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,130
We should be honest about what we want.

519
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:50,210
Better than lying to yourself.

520
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,880
You're extremely honest.
I respect that, He-ra.

521
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:55,640
But you can be too honest.

522
00:39:58,350 --> 00:39:59,640
I'm worried about you, He-ra.

523
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:04,190
That, 'cause of your greed,
you'll lose everything.

524
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:08,020
Thank you for your concern,
but I don't appreciate what you just said.

525
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:11,030
I don't see anything wrong
with being ambitious with your life.

526
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,830
Thanks for the ride.

527
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:33,090
ON OFFICIAL DUTY

528
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,520
What's going on?

529
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,600
For my darling daughter.

530
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,850
This is for when
you want to look your best.

531
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:31,210
Mom.

532
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:35,300
What's going on?

533
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:45,510
I'm sorry.

534
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,810
What are we gonna do now?

535
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,020
What do we do?

536
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:57,400
My baby.

537
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:02,160
My poor baby.

538
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,620
Oh, He-ra.

539
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,890
Please help me!

540
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:27,430
I'm being blackmailed by someone here.

541
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:35,060
Why do you think they want us
to come to Jae-i's farewell party?

542
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:37,730
I know, right?
They never invite us to their parties.

543
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:39,110
Why do they want us there?

544
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:41,530
Do you think they're planning something?
Like a big prank?

545
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:43,860
-Well, now I'm scared to go.
-I know.

546
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:46,950
I think… we face it.

547
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,910
Are you just gonna avoid them
till graduation?

548
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,540
-We need to fight back.
-Why are you all here?

549
00:43:55,420 --> 00:44:00,010
Scholarship students are not allowed
in Special Teaching Room A.

550
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:02,010
We were waiting
for our next class.

551
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:04,050
We figured the room is empty today, so…

552
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:06,890
Even when there aren't classes in here,
this room is still off-limits.

553
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:11,680
It's reserved exclusively for
the real Jooshin High students.

554
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:15,770
Whereas you're only here due to
the school's charitable desire to help.

555
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,110
How dare you set foot in spaces
meant for the special class students.

556
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:25,950
Clean everything up, then leave.

557
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:27,830
Come on. Clean it.

558
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:30,330
Right now!

559
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:49,810
Preparations are complete,
but are you sure you'll be all right?

560
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,930
If anything goes wrong,
the consequences could be disastrous.

561
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:56,850
-Especially if it gets back to Mrs. An.
-Make sure it doesn't.

562
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,230
And make sure… that none of it goes wrong.

563
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:05,360
And if it does go wrong,
and something were to happen,

564
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:06,860
then…

565
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:09,870
it'll be on me.

566
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:17,620
Be sure to call as soon as you get there.

567
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:18,830
I will.

568
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,590
You have nothing to worry about.

569
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:23,090
I'll make sure I take
good care of your daughter.

570
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:26,680
All right. Well, Seon-jun,
I put my trust in you.

571
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,140
-Oh, uh…
-Yes, sir?

572
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,520
Well, the exchange rate
isn't great right now…

573
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,770
Guess this is goodbye.

574
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:37,940
Safe travels, Noona.

575
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,520
Yes, sir.

576
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:44,650
Don't ever come back here.

577
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:48,200
Besides, you have nothing left here.

578
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:58,920
Well, dear, we don't want them to be late.
They should be going.

579
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,460
Safe travels, all right?

580
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,300
We'll let you know
when we arrive.

581
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:07,260
Goodbye. We'll be on our way now.

582
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:34,620
Later!

583
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:47,090
This is lit!

584
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:28,130
-I'm here.
-Good.

585
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:29,460
-Let's get a drink.
-Okay.

586
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:43,150
-Oh my God!
-Wow! It's so beautiful!

587
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:45,980
-Girl, let's take a quick selfie with it.
-Okay.

588
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:01,870
-Isn't that the class president?
-Guess she invited scholarship kids too.

589
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,330
That's why the venue changed
from her vacation home.

590
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:05,330
Really?

591
00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:10,710
Wonder where she is?
The host is late to her own party.

592
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:14,300
She's allowed to show up late.
She's the guest of honor.

593
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:17,550
Girl, this is a party for Jae-i.
She's not the guest of honor.

594
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:20,430
My gosh, Ba-da. Are you totally oblivious?

595
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:23,310
-What do you mean?
-It's called a farewell party.

596
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:25,100
But it's more like a coronation.

597
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:29,150
"Farewell, Jung Jae-i.
The crown now belongs to Queen He-ra."

598
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:32,440
You know how it goes. Otherwise,
why wouldn't she have thrown it sooner?

599
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:36,160
Oh, you're right! Jae-i flies out today.

600
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:38,780
Think she left yet?

601
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:11,320
-Where's Ri-an?
-He's running a little late.

602
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:14,610
You seem kinda different.

603
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,320
Different how?

604
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:20,280
You look really, uh, normal, kinda.

605
00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:22,910
No more flash. I want normal.

606
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:25,370
And I'm still pretty, even normal.

607
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:28,960
Mm. For sure. You're pretty.

608
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:33,090
By the way, I was thinking about
your advice from before.

609
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:34,090
What?

610
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:35,880
That life's too short.

611
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:39,470
That we have to go for…
for what we want the most.

612
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,020
I figured I should be more like you.

613
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:45,230
And I guess I should be a bit more honest.

614
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:49,770
Just do whatever you want.

615
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:53,730
I'm gonna make Ri-an
give me an answer tonight.

616
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:55,940
Because if I have him,
there won't be any issues.

617
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,320
"Issues"?

618
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:16,130
Hello, He-ra.

619
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:19,430
Thank you for the invite.

620
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:21,340
For inviting us all.

621
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:22,760
Maybe it's the outfit,

622
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,680
but you seem like
you're a different person tonight.

623
00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:31,310
Lay low tonight.

624
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:33,400
We plan to have a good night.

625
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:35,400
Like you, Woo-jin.

626
00:50:48,370 --> 00:50:49,370
What is it?

627
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:51,540
What's different?

628
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:06,310
WHERE DID YOU GET THOSE VIDEOS?

629
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:15,480
DON'T GET FLUSTERED
AND MAKE IT SO OBVIOUS

630
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:35,670
Didn't I tell you
you were being too obvious,

631
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:38,130
class president?

632
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:50,180
I found this while visiting In-han.
It's yours, isn't it?

633
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:53,350
I remember I saw it attached to your bag.

634
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,570
But I wonder.
How'd it wind up at his gravesite?

635
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:03,110
Why would you be visiting my brother?

636
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:06,450
Were you friends with In-han?

637
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,200
I was curious about that,
so I asked Tae-ho,

638
00:52:10,290 --> 00:52:12,080
and he said something kinda weird.

639
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:14,920
And the new kid. Kang Ha is your friend.

640
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,380
Speaking of Kang Ha, don't you think
he looks a lot like the kid who died?

641
00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:22,510
So I sent you that message,
just in case.

642
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:25,010
Your reaction was confirmation.

643
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:31,270
Jae-i said she was being blackmailed
by an anonymous account.

644
00:52:32,810 --> 00:52:34,020
Is that you as well?

645
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:38,480
What do you want from me?

646
00:52:39,070 --> 00:52:40,780
To know why I sent that to you?

647
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:44,150
Or to know why I was blackmailing her?

648
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:46,820
Neither.

649
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:49,700
I just wanna know what else you have.

650
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:54,290
That's all I want from you.

651
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:07,640
We're all out.

652
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:15,060
What?

653
00:53:17,850 --> 00:53:19,150
Where is he?

654
00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:22,690
Look at this. My gosh.

655
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:33,870
GONGSEONG CHAIRMAN'S SON
ARRESTED ON DRUG CHARGES

656
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:46,970
Let's go!
Why is a car coming in here?

657
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:22,790
Park Seon-jun?

658
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:26,920
You are under arrest for
violation of the Narcotics Control Act.

659
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:32,800
Let's go.

660
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:35,560
Don't wanna be late, do you?
It's your party.

661
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:39,350
What is he doing?

662
00:54:39,890 --> 00:54:41,350
Wait, is that Jae-i?

663
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:50,910
Ri-an.

664
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,450
This was your doing.

665
00:54:56,410 --> 00:54:58,160
You stopped her from flying out.

666
00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:01,120
Yoon He-ra, is this
a good enough answer for you?

667
00:55:03,790 --> 00:55:05,130
This is official.

668
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,300
Jae-i and I,

669
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:10,380
we're starting over.

670
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:12,300
We're gonna tell our parents too.

671
00:55:15,970 --> 00:55:17,430
So from now on,

672
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:20,060
no one's gonna mess with Jae-i ever again.

673
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,360
No one.

674
00:55:25,150 --> 00:55:26,520
Especially you.

675
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:33,570
Oh my.

676
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,490
Poor He-ra.

677
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:43,210
You said I could have them all?

678
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:46,750
I want those videos.

679
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,630
Send them over. All of it.

680
01:00:36,130 --> 01:00:37,170
Which is cuter?

681
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,050
-They're both nice.
-But which is better?

682
01:00:41,130 --> 01:00:42,590
We know you're gonna buy both.

683
01:00:42,670 --> 01:00:45,430
Yeah, I know. Move.

684
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:51,770
If she was gonna buy them both all along,
why bother asking me?
