00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,960
HIERARCHY

2
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,240
Mmm.

3
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,250
Good morning. You sleep all right?

4
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,080
Mm-mm.

5
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,380
Time to wake up.

6
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:00,300
Mm-mm.

7
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,480
Did you sleep all right?

8
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,190
Mmm.

9
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,540
Don't be late, okay?

10
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,040
-I'll see you at school.
-See ya!

11
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,650
EPISODE 2
SECRET: WITHIN A SECRET

12
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,450
We're finished.

13
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,660
I'm done.

14
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,100
I trust you've all been well.
Hand out their gifts.

15
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,150
We're very grateful, ma'am.

16
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,980
I didn't think
I'd see you until next month.

17
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,200
Ri-an, my dear son.

18
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,950
You're looking well.

19
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,620
My business in Singapore ended early,
so I thought I'd visit.

20
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,000
How's school? A third-year already!

21
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:16,330
My, how time flies.
You'll be in college before we know it.

22
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,130
A mother gets emotional.

23
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:20,840
They grow up so fast.

24
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,800
I'm a second-year.

25
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,470
Hmm?

26
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,590
I still have a year before I graduate.

27
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:31,810
That's wonderful! Have you thought about
what university you'd like to attend?

28
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:34,680
Perhaps… England would be a good fit?

29
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:35,690
Oh.

30
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,020
Let's get my schedule in order.

31
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,190
Yes, ma'am.

32
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,570
Lunch with the executives at 12:00.

33
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,450
Jooshin Gallery at 2:00.

34
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:50,660
Jooshin Hotel at 4:00.

35
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,040
And… what else was there?

36
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,750
You have a meeting with Director An.

37
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:57,870
-I'll squeeze the director in after lunch.
-Right.

38
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,590
Everything in London
is marvelous, except the weather.

39
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:03,590
Choose somewhere in the UK.
You won't regret it.

40
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,170
You've been gone three months.

41
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,220
We haven't had a real conversation
in over a year.

42
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,180
You could at least ask me how I'm doing.

43
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,100
Like, if I'm eating all right,
or if I've been sick!

44
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,390
I'm not a grown-up.

45
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,640
I still need my parents sometimes.

46
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,900
How many staff members
have I assigned to take care of Ri-an?

47
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,270
Six tutors, two assistants,

48
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,230
three health specialists,
and four nutritionists.

49
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,440
Fifteen total, ma'am.

50
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,320
What kind of attention are you lacking?

51
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:40,580
And let's set something up with CEO Ryu
before the board meeting.

52
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:41,750
Yes, ma'am.

53
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,120
Oh! Tae-ho!

54
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:14,450
Hey!

55
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,710
Jesus Christ.

56
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,870
Get your dirty hands off me,
you charity case!

57
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,550
Hey, Tae-ho.

58
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:33,090
Man,
you really don't have a clue, do you?

59
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,600
-Do you know Tae-ho?
-Of course he doesn't.

60
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,430
Does he look like he's friends
with the heir to Jaeyul Hotels?

61
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,390
Look, scholarship kid,
going here doesn't make you our friend.

62
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,310
He laughed!

63
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,650
-Wow!
-In our faces!

64
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:49,440
This commoner thinks he can just come up
and touch the nobles whenever he wants.

65
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:52,410
Tae-ho should wash
his shoulder. It might start rotting off.

66
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,160
Ooh, look.

67
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,240
Ooh!

68
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,990
No way!
He actually showed his face?

69
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,660
Ri-an's gonna make
an unboxing video with his guts.

70
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,330
He's got nerve, that's for sure.
Seriously, what was going on that night?

71
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:06,210
How could Jae-i just stand there
and let that scholarship kid kiss her?

72
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,420
Maybe she was into it.

73
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,090
Ugh, no way!
Jae-i with a scholarship kid?

74
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,340
She would never! Would she, He-ra?

75
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,220
I wouldn't rule it out.

76
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,770
Scholarship or not,
if Jae-i likes him, that's that.

77
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:20,930
Actually, it's inspiring.

78
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,980
To be attracted to someone without regard
to their status or social class.

79
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:25,980
Really?

80
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,820
So what about you, He-ra?
Does that rule apply to you?

81
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,980
Oh, I'm different.

82
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:33,070
I could never be attracted to a man
that much poorer than I am.

83
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,360
It's just in my DNA.

84
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,410
Oh. Hey, he's coming.

85
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,650
You don't wanna get
on their bad side.

86
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,860
Everything Chan-min said
the other day is true.

87
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,940
The kid who died,

88
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,070
it was because he pissed off Ri-an.

89
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:15,240
They said it was a hit-and-run,
but that's bullshit.

90
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,280
He was so scared of Ri-an's goons,
he ran into traffic.

91
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,200
Or somebody hit him on purpose.

92
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:25,120
But why?
What did he do to piss off Ri-an?

93
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,170
It was because of Jae-i.

94
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,500
He was friends with Jae-i,
and Ri-an didn't like it.

95
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:32,630
-What? You mean, that's all?
-"That's all"? Jae-i's his girlfriend!

96
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:36,180
His Achilles heel.
She's the only thing he cares about!

97
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,460
Tell me something.

98
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,300
Was that little show really necessary?

99
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,630
What do you mean, "show"?

100
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,380
The kiss?

101
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,600
What I said earlier
should have been enough.

102
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,680
I've been perfectly clear to you.

103
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,680
Who I like
and what I choose to do with them

104
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,640
has nothing to do with you.

105
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:29,810
You like that guy?

106
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,770
The scholarship kid?

107
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,190
What's really going on here?

108
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,280
What's the real reason
you're calling it off all of a sudden?

109
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,990
And why are you
bringing the new kid into it?

110
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:44,950
You said you'd die
before you told me the truth,

111
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,620
but I need to know, Jung Jae-i.

112
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,370
Matter of fact,

113
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,670
I'm not letting you get away
without an explanation.

114
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,630
I can promise you right now
I'm willing to do whatever it takes.

115
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:02,090
Whatever it takes to find out
the secret you're keeping from me.

116
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,680
And I won't stop
until you're back were you belong.

117
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,490
I'll take care of that prick. Quietly.

118
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,040
No, not quietly.

119
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,540
I want everybody to know.

120
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,080
He needs to learn
that there are consequences

121
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:34,340
for putting his hands on what's mine.

122
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,630
Don't you think
we should lay low for a little while

123
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,050
when that other kid just died?

124
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,840
Okay, I'll take care of it.

125
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,470
He'll get the message.

126
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,770
From this moment on,

127
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,900
any asshole that speaks
to the new scholarship student,

128
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,360
or even acknowledges him,

129
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,940
will get the same treatment.

130
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,940
Chan-min.

131
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:03,110
I shouldn't have to tell you
how to handle this stuff.

132
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,660
I mean, do I have to
hold your fucking hand through everything?

133
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,700
You're right.
It won't happen again.

134
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,790
I was actually
just in the middle of a plan.

135
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,460
A plan to take care of him!

136
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,550
I'm sorry.

137
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,010
I've never seen anyone make these plans
in front of their target.

138
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,640
-Have you?
-Do you have a death wish, motherfucker?

139
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:33,020
Hey, Yun-seok just told you
not to speak to me.

140
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,350
Or did you not hear him?

141
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,150
You crazy fucker…

142
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:41,780
-Chan-min!
-Hey!

143
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:45,110
If you should be hitting someone now,
it should be him instead of me, right?

144
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,240
Hmm?

145
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,160
Ah! My fingers!

146
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,830
Shit! You son of a bitch!
Why are you all fucking standing there?

147
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,880
Ugh, this is fucking bullshit!

148
00:11:59,130 --> 00:11:59,960
Asshole!

149
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,130
What do you think you're doing?

150
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,010
A third-year?

151
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,260
What are you doing down here?

152
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,600
Shit! So fucking embarrassing!

153
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,610
I have
a brief announcement to make.

154
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:24,610
This year's Healing Forest retreat
will go ahead as planned.

155
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,240
All the details
will be posted in the group chat.

156
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,580
If you're unable to attend,
please notify me in advance.

157
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:32,830
That's all.

158
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,550
Jae-i.

159
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,430
Hang on. Can we talk for a minute?

160
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,680
Yeah.

161
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:53,930
Just say it.

162
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,310
Don't worry about her.

163
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,360
You heard her.

164
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:06,240
I'm sorry… about the other night.

165
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,490
-I'm sorry if what I did offended you--
-Scholarship kid.

166
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,790
Kang Ha. That's my name.

167
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,120
Not "scholarship kid." Kang Ha.

168
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,870
Whatever your name is,
we were just fooling around at a party.

169
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,420
That's it. I hate it when guys get clingy.

170
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:25,010
Oh, do you want some advice?

171
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:27,800
I'm paying you back
for the shirt you lent me the other day.

172
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:34,930
Drop out.

173
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,020
"Drop out"?

174
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,480
Why should I drop out now?

175
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,190
Ri-an hates you, so that's the only thing
you can do to defend yourself.

176
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,360
Ah.

177
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:48,530
If it's about that,
I can take care of myself.

178
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:49,610
And also…

179
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,490
…I liked kissing you.

180
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,370
I liked that it was you.

181
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,790
And I really liked that you didn't

182
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,460
push me away.

183
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,760
I'm rooting for you,

184
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,010
this passionate romance
between the classes.

185
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,020
But what made you choose Jae-i?
There were plenty of girls there.

186
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,270
She was pretty.

187
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,350
What?

188
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,440
She was the prettiest.

189
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:25,940
That night.

190
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:28,820
Out of every girl there.

191
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,700
That's it?

192
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:40,250
You put your life on the line
all because she was… cute?

193
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:57,100
I mean,
I thought I had to do something.

194
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,100
I'm sorry.

195
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,020
Whatever I did,

196
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,560
I'm sorry for everything.

197
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,740
How do I look? Pretty cool, huh?

198
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,330
It suits you.

199
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:23,330
Hop in. I'll give you a ride somewhere.

200
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,210
Shall we?

201
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,140
Got you on camera.

202
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,600
Ah!

203
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,240
What are you eating?

204
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,700
-Ice cream.
-All to yourself? You're not gonna share?

205
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,030
Here. Here, have some.

206
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:00,950
-Ah!
-Ah.

207
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,500
I'm gonna need you a little closer.

208
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,250
-Give it to me.
-Ah!

209
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:07,460
Seriously! Hey!

210
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,500
Enough!

211
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,170
Hey, hey.

212
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,840
Hey!

213
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:18,010
Are you sorry?
Don't mess with people's food.

214
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,600
Ice cream or me?

215
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,600
Ice cream.

216
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,520
Huh? Get back here.

217
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:25,850
Now you're in for it.

218
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,360
Say "ah!"

219
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,320
Come on, open wide!
I can't reach that far.

220
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,990
-Ah!
-Ah-- Hey!

221
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:35,070
That was your fault!

222
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:37,160
-You're right. It's my fault.
-You admit it?

223
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,120
I admit it.

224
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:39,950
-But one thing.
-What?

225
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:43,450
Are you willing
to beat up your boyfriend over ice cream?

226
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,750
-Well, you deserved it.
-Ice cream or me. Choose.

227
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,620
-Well, it's obvious…
-Oh yeah?

228
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:49,290
-I choose…
-Yes?

229
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,170
-Ice cream.
-Not gonna cry, are you?

230
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,710
Come here.

231
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,510
-Seriously, come here!
-Aren't you just a hopeless romantic?

232
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,680
You know, this is a bit of a turnoff.

233
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,980
I saw Jae-i outside the hotel.

234
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:15,780
Are you even listening to me?
Stop moping. It's gross.

235
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,280
Cut it out.

236
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,910
Remember, Jae-i hates it
when guys get too clingy.

237
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:28,920
I know something you can try.

238
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:31,290
What are you thinking?

239
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,800
Try dating someone else.

240
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,630
Since you were 15-- No, even longer.

241
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,970
Ever since you guys were six,

242
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:42,510
you've never given any other girl
so much as a second glance.

243
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,890
Seeing you with someone else
would drive her crazy.

244
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:47,230
I know if it were me, I'd want you back.

245
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,690
So I should date someone else
to lure her back?

246
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:52,020
Yeah. Or pretend to. Just be convincing.

247
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:54,150
Poor girl.

248
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,570
I'm sure she still has feelings for you.

249
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,360
Why else would she drive out here?

250
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:01,910
You need to get smart about this soon
if you're serious about winning her back.

251
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:03,580
This is your only shot.

252
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,580
Well then…

253
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,250
you should

254
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:14,800
look into something.

255
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,590
Look into what, exactly?

256
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,930
The reason that she's leaving.

257
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:23,930
The real reason.

258
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,270
I don't think I can.

259
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:35,690
No one wants you back together
more than I do, but I'm her best friend.

260
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:37,190
I can't start spying on her, can I?

261
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,480
-Been a while.
-Good to see you.

262
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,360
Just tell me, already.

263
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,450
Tell you what?

264
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,200
We both know you have a secret.

265
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:25,910
Why suffer through it alone?

266
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:27,740
You can share.

267
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,170
Let me take this.

268
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,420
Looks like I'm not
the only one with a secret.

269
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,760
What happened to sharing?

270
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,260
I'll be right back.

271
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,480
If you keep ignoring me,

272
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,070
I'll consider sending this
to your father too.

273
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,610
…your father too.

274
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,830
This is the email address
for the secretary's office

275
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,120
at Jaeyul Group, right?

276
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:36,020
You said you took care of it.

277
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,520
You deleted everything, right?
So what's the problem?

278
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,830
You're positive?

279
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:51,870
You're sure you did?

280
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:52,950
Yes, I'm sure.

281
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,290
I checked twice.
No, three times. I'm absolutely sure.

282
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,130
What do I do now?

283
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:00,130
What's gonna happen to me?
What the hell do I do?

284
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,840
Don't worry, we'll find a way.

285
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,420
No, it's too late for that.

286
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,840
I did everything I could.

287
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,260
-Jae-i.
-You have no idea.

288
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,810
You don't know what my dad is like.

289
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:17,060
When he finds out,
he'll hide me away like my mom.

290
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,560
Or he'll just kill me.

291
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:21,610
At this point,

292
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,940
it'd be better if I just…
if I just died before it gets out.

293
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,320
We'll figure something out.

294
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:28,990
I can help you.

295
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,070
I'm so scared

296
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,120
I'll end up like my mom!

297
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,080
I'm scared that my dad will kill me!

298
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,340
Wait.

299
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:53,890
Don't tell me…

300
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:56,140
Jae-i? What? Hey! Hey!

301
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,600
-What are you doing in here?
-Jae-i!

302
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:01,100
-Get out before we beat you.
-Jae-i! Wait, please!

303
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,310
-Jae-i!
-Get out!

304
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:15,160
How about it?
Are you interested in speaking to me now?

305
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,850
-You're leaving?
-Yeah.

306
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:36,720
I'm tired. See you later.

307
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:50,860
You nearly had it!

308
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,030
Close one, Dad.

309
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,340
Chairman Jung.

310
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,340
I said don't disturb me.

311
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,390
What?

312
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,610
What was uploaded?

313
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:31,360
Confirm the details and stand by for now.

314
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,710
Tell me it isn't true, Jung Jae-i.

315
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:50,210
No daughter of mine
could do something like that.

316
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,340
I'd expect this kind of thing
out of your filthy, low-class mother.

317
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,470
But you? There's no way.

318
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:58,810
I refuse to believe
my daughter would humiliate me like this.

319
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,520
Answer me.

320
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,650
Don't stand there gaping like a fool!

321
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:13,450
Answer me right now!

322
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,030
I'm afraid I have to go.

323
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,710
An issue has come up at work.

324
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,750
Oh really? It must be bad news.

325
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,460
Something odd was posted
on the board members' forum.

326
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:33,840
I have to assess the situation.

327
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,550
I feel awful. We haven't been
hunting together for a while.

328
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,510
Now I've gone and ruined it.

329
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,980
Don't rush coming back down.

330
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:03,950
There we go. Now the lemon zest.

331
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,290
Director Jang called.
He's been trying to reach you all morning.

332
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,590
Everything's all right at work?

333
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,750
Of course it is. We're fine.

334
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,220
And have you heard back from Jooshin?

335
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,390
I told you not to worry.

336
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:22,680
Oh. Is it today already?

337
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,640
Only the most special day of the year!

338
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:29,560
The day that I get to prepare
my daughter's breakfast myself!

339
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,280
Come see me at the house later.

340
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,620
Am I your servant now?

341
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,410
That shit is so funny, man.

342
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,620
That's not the craziest part.
Later…

343
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:48,790
Hey.

344
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,670
Let's go.

345
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:22,320
They spiked my drink
with something.

346
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,990
It had to be some kind of drug.

347
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:30,620
I almost died.

348
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:32,380
I'm serious.

349
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:38,050
Wait. In-han. Just try and calm down.
You think high school kids would do that?

350
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,630
You have no idea

351
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,140
what kind of place Jooshin is…

352
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,350
what kind of people they are.

353
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,830
Were your parent's fired
from Jooshin or something?

354
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:09,910
Were they contractors
whose business dried up?

355
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,460
Who the hell are you?

356
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,580
What's your deal, huh?

357
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:16,500
Everyone keeps telling me you're the one
who runs things around here.

358
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:19,460
I'm only doing what I need to survive.

359
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:22,680
If I have to go up against you
to do that, so be it.

360
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,800
That true?

361
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:25,890
You sure?

362
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,400
You see, I wanna know
what you're up to, scholarship kid.

363
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:37,980
Try me.

364
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,780
We'll see how long you last.

365
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,490
In-han was being bullied, assaulted,

366
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:50,910
and Kim Ri-an was behind it.

367
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,580
Could he have spiked In-han's drink too?

368
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,690
We need to deal with him
at the Healing Forest.

369
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:15,650
If we wait any longer, we're dead!

370
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:18,690
But, Chan-min, he didn't even flinch
when you tried to hit him.

371
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:21,400
How do we get
someone like that to drop out?

372
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,240
We just have to kill his spirit!

373
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,950
Either we kick his face in

374
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,700
or deal with him like Kang In-han,

375
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,240
make him disappear.

376
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:32,790
No one would bat an eye
if another lowlife died anyway.

377
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:35,420
Get off your fucking phone
when I'm talking to you!

378
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,830
Ugh! These fucking idiots!

379
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:44,220
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

380
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,860
Ms. Han asked me to bring you this.

381
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,320
Mm-hmm.

382
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:05,070
How's it going?

383
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,450
And how is everyone?

384
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:08,910
Who exactly do you mean by that?

385
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:11,370
Ri-an, Jae-i, Woo-jin, He-ra.

386
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,200
I'm talking about your friends.

387
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:14,700
My friends?

388
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,670
They're all fine.

389
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,830
Don't waste your time
with the wrong people.

390
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,500
The friends you make here
will last a lifetime.

391
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:25,920
They'll be very helpful
when you start your career.

392
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:27,930
You understand what I mean, don't you?

393
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,800
Yes.

394
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,430
One thing, Mom.

395
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:39,810
How did you cover it up?

396
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:44,230
In-han's death, I mean.

397
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,150
You made sure
there wasn't even a single article.

398
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,200
I'm curious how.

399
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,790
I'm afraid I don't know
what you're talking about.

400
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,000
Go on, you'll be late.

401
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,720
You have to open it.

402
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:18,060
I saw Kim Ri-an put drugs
into Choi Yun-seok's locker.

403
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:24,980
It's against school policy
to open a student's personal locker.

404
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,360
It's a breach of privacy.

405
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,780
If you don't open it for me,
I'll file a formal complaint.

406
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,740
A formal complaint? For?

407
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:35,160
You saw me being attacked
in the classroom, and you just ignored it.

408
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:41,420
Kang Ha, a school is a tiny society.

409
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:45,040
At Jooshin, we give students the freedom
to resolve minor issues amongst themselves

410
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:47,090
to help them function within that society.

411
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,840
Help us? Help us how?

412
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:53,800
Help us learn respect for the bosses' sons
since they'll be our bosses in the future?

413
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:55,680
Help us remember we're poor,

414
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,350
and that we'd better get used to
getting walked all over?

415
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:01,350
That doesn't sound much like "help" to me.
Or does it to you?

416
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,270
Kang Ha!

417
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:04,520
Maybe I should let the press know
about my assault,

418
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:06,690
about Jooshin's special rules.

419
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:07,650
Everything.

420
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:56,950
Boo!

421
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,120
Oh, you scared me.

422
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,290
I'm so hungry. Buy me a yogurt?

423
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:01,500
-Yogurt?
-Mm-hmm.

424
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:02,870
Come on.

425
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,960
-Strawberry?
-Sure.

426
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:18,220
Is this it?
Is this what you were talking about?

427
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,600
You see? We need an investigation.

428
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,720
Find out what these are.

429
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:23,980
Find out who is dealing them
to who at school, and also,

430
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,520
who they might have fed them to.

431
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,020
This is Xanax.

432
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,730
They're for anxiety disorders.

433
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:35,200
I don't know if these were prescribed
at your old school, but they are here.

434
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,910
Most kids are under so much pressure,
they need them.

435
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,160
Go check with a police station
or hospital if you don't believe me.

436
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,000
Just put it back before anyone finds out.

437
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,670
And don't cause any trouble.

438
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:07,020
If someone's sending you
anonymous DMs,

439
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,770
can you find out who they are?

440
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:10,650
I'm not sure.

441
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,110
Why do you ask?

442
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:15,360
Well, you said you knew
a good harassment lawyer.

443
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,700
Oh, yes, I do.

444
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,740
Eun-gyeong used this firm
to go after her Internet trolls.

445
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:24,620
But the social media sites
don't like disclosing user info.

446
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,290
So it's hard to find out who's behind it.

447
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:28,920
You know, I don't really care
if it's legal or not.

448
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,670
Just find someone
who can track anonymous accounts.

449
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,880
How would I do that though?

450
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:39,840
I imagine way more people
are in your circle--

451
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:41,720
You remember Woo-jin's birthday?

452
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:44,430
Someone took a video.

453
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,560
Sorry, what?

454
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,480
And that someone still has it too.

455
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,560
Wait.

456
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:52,110
Wait. Who has it?

457
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:54,070
Wait, why? And how? What was recorded?

458
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,490
Was there anything bad in particular?

459
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:58,700
Was there anything
that happened at that party

460
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,110
that you'd want recorded

461
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,280
and shared with everyone?

462
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:10,580
Do whatever it takes.
I need to expose this account.

463
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,050
Hey, how's this one?

464
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:23,890
-Yeah, looks good.
-Should I choose one more?

465
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:26,140
How long is this year's
Healing Forest retreat again?

466
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,350
It's a day, right?

467
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:29,140
What was that guy's name?

468
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:31,310
Kang…

469
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,400
That kid who died?

470
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,610
Kang In-han?

471
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:37,780
He died the day of
Woo-jin's birthday party, didn't he?

472
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,280
Yeah, he did. You're right.

473
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:16,940
This is Yoon He-ra. How have you been?

474
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,360
I need your help with something.

475
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:54,150
Everybody, listen up.

476
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:56,980
We are about to begin
today's floating session.

477
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,530
Relax your body and slowly lay back.

478
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,660
Take a deep breath in.

479
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,290
Inhale.

480
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,170
Good shot!

481
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,810
I haven't seen that kid today.

482
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:35,650
-Have you guys?
-I saw him earlier.

483
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:40,270
What do you think, guys? Is this it?
Kang Ha's last night on earth?

484
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,400
Oh, tonight?

485
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,200
I assume Chan-min
and the scholarship students wanna live.

486
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,740
-So they've got something planned.
-It better be something good.

487
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,820
Let's make it interesting.

488
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:49,330
Hey, Tae-ho, wanna bet on it?

489
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:50,950
Bet what?

490
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,000
I'll bet a million won
on the scholarship kid.

491
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,960
I bet he's stubborn enough to survive.

492
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,170
Me too. A million won
he makes it to tomorrow.

493
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:59,710
Oh. My million won says
he doesn't last the night.

494
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:01,170
A deal is a deal. All right, guys?

495
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:03,550
Park Tae-ho? How do you bet?

496
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:08,300
I also bet a million he doesn't.

497
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:10,850
Okay! That's two million if you lose.

498
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:12,680
-Yeah? Make it five.
-Five?

499
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:14,560
I raise you five more. Now it's ten.

500
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:19,110
Just pretend you're on a normal trip
with a normal school. This is your room.

501
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:22,280
These are more tucked away,
better for the scholarship students.

502
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,190
Okay.

503
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,030
Sign up at the information desk
for any sessions you want.

504
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,070
My advice.

505
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:31,780
Do yourself a favor,
and choose the least popular ones.

506
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:33,660
We'll see. Thanks, man.

507
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:35,960
This doesn't make us friends.

508
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,750
Don't talk to me in front of the others.

509
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,670
There's a reason they call me "Moss."

510
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,960
My existence is barely noticed.

511
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:47,170
-That's a shitty name to call someone.
-I'm not offended by it.

512
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:51,930
I've worked hard for a long time
to earn that nickname.

513
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,760
I'm not about to ruin it.

514
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:56,890
Not for anyone.

515
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,570
Well, thanks for the advice.

516
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,880
I've started looking into your problem.

517
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,210
You know, whoever's behind this account,
if they were at the party with us,

518
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,460
that probably means it's someone we know.

519
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:30,090
You'd think our friends would know better
than to try pulling this shit on us.

520
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,050
What do they want?

521
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:33,180
I don't know.

522
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,760
They never actually said.

523
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:37,640
Maybe they're hoping to make a buck
by threatening to make it public.

524
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:40,310
But who at the party
would be so desperate or stupid enough

525
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:42,100
to try and blackmail us for money?

526
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:46,030
Send me those DMs when you get a chance.
I'll get someone on it.

527
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:52,240
I'll send the messages on my own.

528
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:58,910
You must be
in serious trouble, Jae-i.

529
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:02,830
You weren't the only one filmed doing
something you shouldn't have been doing.

530
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,340
Brunch, anyone?

531
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:20,640
I haven't even touched my food,

532
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:22,940
but my appetite's gone.

533
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,690
-Could it be the vibes?
-Yeah, and I think it's contagious.

534
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:27,940
Because I feel the same way.

535
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:30,780
It's been forever
since we all hung out.

536
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,280
Can't you get along for one day?

537
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,330
I'm gonna head out.

538
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:41,580
Stay. You said you wanted to be friends.

539
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,330
There's no reason to avoid me
if you meant it.

540
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,130
Don't you remember what you told me?

541
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:50,050
That you would do "whatever it takes"
to try and get us back together.

542
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:58,350
That's reason enough, don't you think?

543
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:03,190
Hey, Jae-i!

544
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,940
Wait. I'll walk you back!

545
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,200
So my plan.

546
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:18,830
You thought about it?

547
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:24,170
Forget about the plan, He-ra.
It'll never work.

548
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:27,000
Jae-i would see through
a fake relationship in a second.

549
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:30,300
-She'd know.
-With the right girl, she might not.

550
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:32,590
I'll do it.

551
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,760
You? Why? What makes you
so perfect for the job?

552
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:39,760
It has to be someone Jae-i would believe,

553
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:43,640
but also someone who's willing to back off
the moment she starts to get jealous.

554
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:45,060
Trust me. I'm your only option.

555
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,440
I wasn't going to tell you this,

556
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:52,030
but even though
Jae-i still has feelings for you,

557
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:54,030
she's crushing on the scholarship kid.

558
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,870
I can clearly tell
just from the look in her eyes.

559
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:01,580
If you don't do something fast,

560
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,620
it'll be too late to ever win her back.

561
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:29,150
I thought I packed all the meds,
but I forgot to bring any antacids.

562
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:31,230
Three boxes should be plenty.

563
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:36,740
Kang Ha.

564
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:40,240
I chose you for this
to help you avoid the other students.

565
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,660
Well, thanks, I guess.

566
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:45,450
Call me cowardly if you want,
but that's how this place works.

567
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,750
All I can do
is try to make the best of the situation.

568
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:50,460
You don't need to explain it to me.

569
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:53,710
This place is just cowardly adults
afraid of insane children.

570
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:56,050
I'm not even curious why anymore.

571
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:12,360
Whoa!

572
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,520
Hey.

573
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:16,240
Jesus! You startled me!
I nearly ran you over!

574
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:19,860
-Are you going somewhere?
-Uh-huh.

575
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:22,070
On an errand to the drugstore.

576
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,250
Go on. I need to get more cigarettes.

577
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:28,500
What?

578
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,000
What? You want me to pedal?

579
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,510
Huh? Isn't that Jae-i?

580
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,600
Yep, that's her with the scholarship kid.

581
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:44,600
Hold on.

582
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:25,640
Feels good.

583
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:29,560
Hmm? What's that? I didn't hear.

584
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,850
Ah. You like the beach? Wanna stop by?

585
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:35,770
It's fine. Just keep going.

586
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:38,070
Sure.

587
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:32,910
You want this?

588
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:35,790
No, thanks. I'm fine.

589
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:44,930
I don't think it'll let up anytime soon.

590
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:54,440
Aw.

591
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:57,980
You're so cute.

592
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:05,650
Ah!

593
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:12,540
You're pretty.

594
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:14,750
What?

595
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,080
You know, you're pretty when you laugh.

596
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,840
I've never even seen you smile before.

597
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,100
I don't understand it.

598
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:32,560
You're pretty, smart, popular,

599
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,430
and rich enough to have
whatever you want in your life.

600
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:37,480
You got everything.

601
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,520
But you never smile.

602
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:43,690
That's just the way I was raised.

603
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:48,070
I was taught to conceal my emotions
around others.

604
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:51,030
"Laughter today becomes gossip tomorrow."

605
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:53,120
"And if anyone sees you cry,

606
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:56,250
it's only a matter of time
before they use it against you."

607
00:45:57,290 --> 00:45:59,170
Wait. That's how they raised you?

608
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,170
Mm-hmm. From the age of three.

609
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,010
Wow.

610
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:08,220
The rich really aren't
like the rest of us, are they?

611
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:12,180
What about you?

612
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:14,350
Everyone's always bullying you
for being poor.

613
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:16,230
What do you have to smile about
all the time?

614
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:17,940
What?

615
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:19,730
Who says I'm poor?

616
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,400
That's funny.

617
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,070
I never thought of myself
as being poor or unhappy.

618
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:26,280
At least I didn't…

619
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:33,950
…until I came here.

620
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:50,590
The rain isn't stopping. Let's just go.

621
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:52,760
Hey, Jae-i, wait for me.

622
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:54,510
Oh, right. The bike.

623
00:46:56,890 --> 00:46:57,770
Jae-i.

624
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,390
Hey, Jae-i.

625
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:00,940
One second.

626
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:04,980
Put this on. You'll catch a cold.

627
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:08,690
There you go.

628
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:13,570
Jae-i.

629
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:16,790
Shit!

630
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:29,800
Remember, when you see him,
grab him by the arms.

631
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,220
We'll either beat him up

632
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,470
or light a fire in here
and lock him inside.

633
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:36,180
We're gonna teach him
a lesson he'll never forget.

634
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:38,680
Understand?

635
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:41,140
Answer me.

636
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:47,690
I'll see ya.

637
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,440
Wait.

638
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:54,820
Dry your shirt. I have a closet steamer.

639
00:48:00,830 --> 00:48:03,000
This place is really amazing.

640
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:06,340
I heard the suites here
can cost a few million won a night.

641
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:07,670
I wish they put me up in one.

642
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:09,340
That's nothing. Get this.

643
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:12,300
Ri-an and Jae-i's villas
were close to ten million won each.

644
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:15,390
Wow! Must be nice
to be born with a silver spoon.

645
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:18,680
If only they'd been born
with some manners to go along with it.

646
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:21,220
These kids order their teachers around
like we're housekeepers.

647
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,480
I'm not sure
how much longer I'll last here.

648
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:25,560
You have it the worst!

649
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:29,270
Your class has Ri-an,
He-ra, Jae-i, Woo-jin too.

650
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:31,740
I don't think I would be able
to come to work!

651
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:34,950
Those kids aren't too bad, actually.

652
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:37,950
It's some of the other students
who give me more trouble.

653
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:39,450
Hey.

654
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:50,130
Excuse me, Ms. Han?
The principal wants to see you.

655
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:52,760
Okay.

656
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:55,300
You'll have to excuse me.

657
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:56,760
-Go!
-Of course!

658
00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:01,140
Hang on.

659
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:04,140
What would Principal Park
want with Ms. Han at this hour?

660
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:06,350
Who cares? Let's drink.

661
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:07,310
Okay.

662
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:12,530
Is something wrong?

663
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:15,780
My girlfriend isn't answering the phone.

664
00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:19,950
Ah. Yeah, I left my cell phone behind
in my room to charge.

665
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:25,710
Wait. Did Principal Park
really ask to see me or not?

666
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,500
I've got wine in my room. Let's go back.

667
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:06,620
Where is Kang Ha?

668
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:08,290
What the hell's going on?

669
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:10,830
Does he know we're here?

670
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:11,880
Message the guys.

671
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:14,170
Get them to find out
what happened to this prick.

672
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:16,420
And where the fuck are the others?

673
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:19,550
There are supposed to be
four fucking guys here! I mean, Jesus!

674
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:26,680
Take this. It's a change of clothes.

675
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:29,390
It's fine, really.
I'm not that wet anymore.

676
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:30,980
I'll leave as soon as my shirt's ready.

677
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:34,320
Well, suit yourself.

678
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:42,280
Do you know
if Kang Ha and Jae-i are close?

679
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:44,200
Who?

680
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:45,990
You know, Kang Ha the new student.

681
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:48,080
Ah, the scholarship kid.

682
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:50,500
Why are you asking?

683
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:54,500
DRYING

684
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:55,590
Good evening.

685
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:07,680
Has filming a gangster movie
rubbed off on you?

686
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:10,560
You're not angry, are you?

687
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:13,440
No.

688
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:16,940
If you're tired, go sleep on the bed.

689
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,400
No, no. I'm awake.

690
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:21,950
Why don't we go somewhere
and have a chat?

691
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:27,950
Didn't you just come
from the film set? You must be tired.

692
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,100
I didn't hate it either,

693
00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:50,730
you know?

694
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:52,850
Hmm?

695
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,900
The night of the party,
when you kissed me.

696
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:03,740
Honestly, I didn't hate it either.

697
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,880
Walking together? Where to?

698
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:01,210
Jae-i's villa.

699
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,470
I saw them going in together.

700
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:04,630
You did?

701
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:08,850
Are you sure?

702
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:10,470
Yeah.

703
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:12,470
I saw them when I came back.

704
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:17,900
Just hang on--

705
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:25,450
I need to go out for a bit.

706
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,160
Okay.

707
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,030
I know it's late, Principal Park.

708
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:34,540
But you need to come here now
with the master key.

709
00:54:14,450 --> 00:54:15,410
I can help you.

710
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:45,900
What's going on here?

711
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:49,400
What do you think you're doing?

712
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:31,700
PERSONAL INFORMATION FORM
KANG HA

713
00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:12,110
All of you,

714
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,490
you're worse than I thought.

715
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:17,330
Hmm? I didn't know ghosts could talk.

716
00:56:17,410 --> 00:56:20,540
Why'd you even bother coming?
You're getting expelled today.

717
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:22,040
I can't believe it.

718
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:24,870
A scholarship student
breaking into Jae-i's room?

719
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:28,590
I thought you were just a puppy dog,
but you're a total stalker.

720
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:29,920
Ugh, he's such a creep.

721
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,590
How much did we bet?
Five million?

722
00:56:31,670 --> 00:56:33,430
-Don't remember.
-It was ten million!

723
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:35,930
-Man, I'm hungry.
-Wanna grab a burger?

724
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:38,390
Ri-an, where are you going?

725
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:40,850
You headed
to the disciplinary hearing as well?

726
00:56:41,350 --> 00:56:42,390
Let's do it.

727
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:44,270
The thing.

728
00:56:44,770 --> 00:56:45,650
What do you mean?

729
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:47,400
Your fake relationship idea.

730
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:50,110
Let's do it.

731
00:57:00,870 --> 00:57:03,200
I'm sure you're aware
why we asked you here, Mr. Kang Ha.

732
00:57:03,290 --> 00:57:05,290
You've been accused of
entering Ms. Jung Jae-i's room

733
00:57:05,370 --> 00:57:07,040
without permission
during a school retreat.

734
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:08,460
Do you deny this charge?

735
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:10,880
Answer the question!

736
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,550
There's no need for any questions.

737
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:14,340
I witnessed him there myself.

738
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:18,140
At least try to explain
how it happened, Kang Ha.

739
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:19,050
And if I did?

740
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:23,180
Would anyone believe a word I said?

741
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:24,680
This is Jooshin, Kang Ha.

742
00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:27,350
We demand the utmost standard
of behavior from our students.

743
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:28,860
More than any other school in Korea.

744
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:31,980
And a student who refuses
to show any shred of remorse

745
00:57:32,070 --> 00:57:34,030
cannot hope to be given a second chance.

746
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:37,700
In accordance with Article 12
of the Jooshin High School regulations,

747
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:40,160
tainting the school's honor
and disorderly behavior,

748
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:43,660
we intend to expel Kang Ha
from his second year, class two.

749
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:49,540
He wasn't trespassing. I invited him in.

750
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:51,710
Jae-i.

751
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:54,090
He was just bringing over
something I asked for.

752
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:55,590
That's the only reason he was there.

753
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:57,930
If you really need to punish someone,

754
00:57:59,470 --> 00:58:00,850
then punish me.

755
00:58:01,890 --> 00:58:02,760
Come on.

756
00:58:03,930 --> 00:58:05,640
Wait, you…

757
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:09,310
I don't believe this.

758
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:12,400
I came here
to personally ask the committee

759
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,110
to punish him for what he did to you.

760
00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:16,360
What are you doing?

761
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:20,200
I said, what are you doing?

762
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:26,750
From now on, you leave Kang Ha alone.

763
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,000
What?

764
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:30,330
And before you ask,

765
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:31,830
I'm not using him.

766
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:39,380
I like him, all right?

767
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:46,140
You lay a hand on him, you answer to me.

768
00:58:46,930 --> 00:58:47,980
Stop.

769
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:52,310
This is Jooshin,

770
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:54,230
Jung Jae-i.

771
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:57,740
Don't start something you can't handle.

772
00:58:58,610 --> 00:59:00,110
I don't care where we are.

773
00:59:02,370 --> 00:59:04,870
