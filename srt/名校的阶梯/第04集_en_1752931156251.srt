HIERARCHY

2
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:50,670
You're crazy.

3
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,250
You're all crazy!

4
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,460
I have to…

5
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:57,590
I… I'm gonna expose
everything that's going on here!

6
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,590
EPISODE 4

7
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:37,590
REVENGE, DESIRE, ROMANCE:
THE HEART OF THE MATTER

8
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,140
What about the guard?

9
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,350
I told him I left something behind.
That should buy us ten minutes.

10
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,650
So, what exactly are you looking for?

11
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:54,900
Drugs.

12
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,780
I saw Choi Yun-seok giving pills
to Kim Ri-an, who hid them in his locker.

13
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,950
Ms. Han said it's an antidepressant
like Xanax. I'm sure it's something else.

14
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,700
I've heard about them
dealing drugs before.

15
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,500
Weed, edibles, GHB, stuff like that.

16
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,130
Take a look.

17
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,390
Find anything?

18
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,610
What is it?
Is there something in those photos?

19
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,730
I can't believe it.

20
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,490
I didn't know she could smile like that.

21
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,420
Oh, that's cold!

22
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,800
Okay, you ready? Let's go.

23
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,970
No, wait!

24
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,350
It's so pretty.

25
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,600
Just like you.

26
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,100
Ri-an.

27
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,730
I'm so happy right now.

28
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,900
Usually, I'm so focused
on playing my role…

29
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,370
on how Jung Jae-i of the Jaeyul Group
should be acting.

30
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,120
It's almost etched into my brain.

31
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,910
With you, I don't worry about any of that.

32
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,540
I hear you.

33
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,710
It can feel good to forget who you are,

34
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,090
to forget that I'm Kim Ri-an,
heir to the Jooshin empire.

35
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,270
I like feeling that way with you.

36
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,270
In fact,

37
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:42,900
I like you more than I thought
it was possible to like anyone.

38
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,190
I see you're on your way home.

39
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,440
We just landed, so I thought
I'd call you from the plane.

40
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:27,030
Well, Ri-an,
how did you feel about yesterday?

41
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,990
How'd I feel about what?

42
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,700
About the glimpse into your future.

43
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,700
The things that'll be yours,
the people you'll command.

44
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,750
Does it seem more real to you now?

45
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,960
All this love I've prepared
for you to inherit one day?

46
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,040
You call that "love"?

47
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,130
You're right.

48
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,420
That kind of love can be a burden.

49
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,920
Jooshin Group's reputation,

50
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,680
the future of its employees
and their families,

51
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,800
all of that will be on your shoulders.

52
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:54,970
It's a heavy crown but a valuable one.

53
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,600
You must protect your right
to inherit that crown, Ri-an.

54
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,100
Maintain your aura of nobility.

55
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,400
Don't involve yourself
in any cheap scandals.

56
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,570
Be above it.

57
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,650
Always remind yourself
of how important you are.

58
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,860
I'll talk to you again soon, my successor.

59
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,520
Your tutors are waiting.
Class will begin once you've changed.

60
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,480
Do I at least get a break?

61
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:48,860
You have strategic management with
Professor Cho of Seoul National University

62
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,610
and international trade
with Professor Son of Harvard.

63
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,620
Essential courses for a future leader
of a top company to master.

64
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,620
These tutors were
meticulously chosen for you.

65
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,370
Besides, you have a commitment at
5:00 a.m. tomorrow. We can't reschedule.

66
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,670
I'm only 18.

67
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,040
I'm still just in high school.

68
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:08,210
My schedule is packed
from sunrise until after midnight.

69
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,590
I think I deserve some breathing room
when I get home from school, don't you?

70
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,590
I understand that you must be tired,

71
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:15,970
nonetheless…

72
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:26,940
There you are.

73
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,480
Oh, Woo-jin, sometimes your mom
doesn't have a clue.

74
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:33,200
If I'm trying to run for president,
I'll need Jooshin's heir to support me.

75
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,950
But all we have for him is
some measly seaweed soup?

76
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,990
I'll have you know Ri-an
specifically asked for it.

77
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,620
Ri-an likes seaweed soup.
Thanks a lot, Mom.

78
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,960
-Ah, I think that's our cue to leave.
-Ah!

79
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,500
Sometimes, your mom does have a clue.

80
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,920
-Please enjoy your meal, Ri-an.
-Thank you. I'm sure I will.

81
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,310
It's just seaweed soup.

82
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,900
Why doesn't it taste like this
at my place?

83
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,020
You have the best chefs
in the world on your staff.

84
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,900
-They can make anything you want them to.
-That's not true.

85
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,030
There are some things you can't fake.

86
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,820
The warmth of a home-cooked meal,
for example. Things like that.

87
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,660
You won't be getting that
at my place.

88
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:25,210
Come over anytime.

89
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,710
-You'd help me be a good son.
-I know my parents would love it.

90
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,250
You're a good friend, man.

91
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,510
I really should come more often.

92
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,430
Something came to me recently.

93
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:46,060
Being together felt so natural for us.
Jae-i and me.

94
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,730
Time we spent, she and I,

95
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:53,110
that was the only time
either of us felt anything like comfort.

96
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:57,820
I guess that's why
I've been feeling so anxious lately.

97
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,410
It's like a part of me is missing.

98
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,370
Can Jae-i really be okay with this?

99
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,290
I know how anxious she gets.

100
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,290
No way.

101
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,250
I know she's hurting.

102
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,960
What about you?

103
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:17,090
Let's eat.

104
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,560
Here.

105
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,860
Right before you pull the trigger,
the target senses it.

106
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:41,160
They can feel that a bullet
will soon be passing through their body.

107
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,780
What matters next is how they react.

108
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,660
Either they stand clueless and meet death,

109
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,120
or they're swift enough
to live another day.

110
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,330
The look in their eyes at that moment,

111
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,340
in that brief instant
preceding their death or their escape,

112
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,380
is the most
exhilarating thing in the world.

113
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,510
You're right. Every time
I hit something that's trying to run away,

114
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:03,010
I get this insane rush of adrenaline.

115
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,930
That's why I find hunting enjoyable.

116
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,100
What about you, Jae-i?

117
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,610
Well, I think--

118
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:15,360
"Oh, that poor thing,
so weak and defenseless."

119
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,740
Something along those lines?

120
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:20,610
Does that explain the scholarship boy?

121
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,750
Do you feel the same compassion for him
as you do for the game animals

122
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:31,670
that cower and flee from you
on the hunting grounds?

123
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,590
Because, otherwise,
I can't understand it.

124
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,590
"Scholarship."

125
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,800
Well, I guess
it's like mother, like daughter.

126
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,770
Just something low-class sluts
have in common.

127
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,230
Jae-hyeok?

128
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,360
Yeah, Dad?

129
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,570
Don't ever let me hear you
talk like that again, you brat.

130
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,990
This isn't a subject for you
to babble about like an idiot.

131
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,250
-Get out.
-Yes, sir.

132
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,760
I felt sorry for him.
It was just like you said.

133
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,800
I felt bad for him because
he was a scholarship student.

134
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,770
People at school exaggerated it.

135
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,680
I thought you'd learned your lesson.

136
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,480
You've seen first-hand

137
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,020
where trivial emotions like pity
can lead, haven't you? So why?

138
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,700
What happened
to the last kid wasn't enough?

139
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:53,910
I'm sorry.

140
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,210
You've spent enough time there.

141
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:06,890
Thankfully, the rumors about Jooshin
and Jaeyul being enemies have died down.

142
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,600
You're moving to New York.

143
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,520
Start getting ready.

144
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:31,990
Noona.

145
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,040
That was annoying.

146
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,500
Dad slapped me again,

147
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,090
and it's your fault.

148
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:45,800
I think he slapped you because
you don't know how to shut up.

149
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,470
And by the way,

150
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,640
don't call me "noona" ever again.

151
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,390
It makes my skin crawl.

152
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,230
What? Whoa!

153
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:55,850
Does it?

154
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,730
"Skin crawl." Good one.

155
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:02,690
You sure seem confident, hmm?

156
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:05,610
Just remember,

157
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,200
noona…

158
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,700
that I still have cards I can play here.

159
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,330
Don't forget what you signed.

160
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,110
Kim Ri-an!

161
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:49,570
Let's go together.

162
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,240
-What do you want for lunch?
-Well done, Yoon He-ra.

163
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:55,790
-You might survive this after all.
-What's that again?

164
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,080
Imagine if she tried
to take on Jae-i alone.

165
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,500
We'd be waving "bye"
at her funeral by now.

166
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,420
Mm-hmm.

167
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,880
By sticking next to Ri-an,
she has guaranteed protection.

168
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,420
Ah.

169
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,910
I asked you here to apologize.

170
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,160
My dad…

171
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,410
I'm sure you felt
insulted the other night.

172
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,000
Meet Jae-i's boyfriend.

173
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,290
Nice to meet you, sir. Hi, I'm Kang Ha.

174
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:51,470
What makes you think
you have the right to address me?

175
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,220
Please don't worry about that.
It doesn't affect me at all.

176
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:59,930
I've had to put up with so much crap
here at Jooshin, I'm immune by now.

177
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,060
But thanks anyway.

178
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:03,690
Why are you thanking me?

179
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,110
Plenty of people at this school
have done bad things to me,

180
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,190
but not one of them has apologized.

181
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,610
You're the first person to do that, Jae-i.

182
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,660
Well, if it happens again,

183
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,330
don't wait around
expecting another apology.

184
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:22,540
Don't try to fight.

185
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,830
It's better to just run away.

186
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,380
Jae-i.

187
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,710
Do you still like Kim Ri-an?

188
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:34,260
What?

189
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:37,640
If you still do, can I ask what made you
break up with him and run away?

190
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,060
Did something force you to do it?

191
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,230
If you wanna be with him,

192
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:44,940
what's holding you back?

193
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,110
I thought I already told you.

194
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,360
Remember?

195
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:53,320
The line we don't cross?

196
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,870
I wanna see your smiling face as well.

197
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,080
So how about it?

198
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,000
Let's date for real and stop faking.

199
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,710
Forget Kim Ri-an.

200
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,760
I'll be the one by your side.

201
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,220
You don't have to be
anxious or lonely anymore.

202
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,140
I'll make you smile. Or try, at least.

203
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,690
You don't have to be
anxious anymore.

204
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,450
I'm here to help.

205
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,570
Jae-i, I'll be by your side.

206
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,290
It's strange.

207
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,500
They're so alike.

208
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:56,880
Who cares if it's real or fake.
It's all meaningless to me.

209
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,890
-What do you mean?
-You could never understand.

210
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:02,350
-Why? Because I'm a scholarship student?
-No.

211
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:04,560
I don't think you and I are any different.

212
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:09,190
It's just, we both live
in completely different worlds.

213
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,230
In my world, how I feel doesn't matter.

214
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,190
At all!

215
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,280
That's the world I have to survive in.

216
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,360
At least until I can stand on my own.

217
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,660
What do you mean, "survive"?

218
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,410
I told you you wouldn't understand.

219
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:28,080
I'm gonna pretend you never said that.

220
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,770
Well, Ms. Park?

221
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,230
How do we look?

222
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,690
I will pretend I never saw you.

223
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:03,870
Oh, and Ri-an?

224
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,460
Your mother was so gracious
to attend our school event the other day.

225
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,000
I hope I made that clear.

226
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,750
Would you pass on how truly thankful I am
for her doing us that honor?

227
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,340
Tell her yourself like you always do.

228
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,300
Right.

229
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:27,390
I can't tell who's in charge anymore.

230
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,770
Whoever has the most power.

231
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:31,980
Huh?

232
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,740
Age, gender,

233
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,990
job title… none of it matters.

234
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,700
These days, power is
the only thing that counts.

235
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,450
You must have figured that out by now.

236
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,000
Missed a button, Ms. Han.

237
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,880
Okay. Come to the lounge.

238
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,010
Don't forget to eat lunch.

239
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,550
I'm meeting my friends.

240
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:03,680
You don't really love me…

241
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,720
do you Woo-jin?

242
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:13,560
Jealous?

243
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,400
But I'm not sure of who.

244
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,820
Or maybe…

245
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,490
you're the one in love.

246
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:28,660
Who is she?

247
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,040
The woman in Lee Woo-jin's heart?

248
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,730
I'll see you at the studio.

249
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,190
-Good afternoon.
-Hi, Ms. Han.

250
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,240
Mm-hmm.

251
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,950
Hey, did you see her bag?

252
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:05,490
-Yes, you are.
-Hello.

253
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,410
-It's a secret.
-You are, right? Right? Right?

254
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:16,630
Jae-i?

255
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:22,670
Normally, we apologize to someone
after bumping into them by accident.

256
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:26,260
"Teachers and students are expected
to show mutual respect."

257
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,260
Section 8 of the school regulations.

258
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,390
Respect you?

259
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,640
Do I have to?

260
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,430
Perhaps I should be recommending you
for special counseling now.

261
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,060
"Counseling"?

262
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,310
I don't remember you
having this attitude before.

263
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,730
Plus, you and Kang Ha have been
hanging out an awful lot lately.

264
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:46,570
You're so on edge. It's almost as if
you think you're in danger.

265
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,580
Come by to see me anytime
if you need some help.

266
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,750
We've all been through so much lately,

267
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:59,540
and we can't let a tragedy
like that ever happen again.

268
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,340
An Hermès Birkin bag?

269
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:08,390
You know what, Ms. Han?
I think you're the one who's in danger.

270
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,110
Ju-won, what were you
doing in there alone?

271
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:31,200
I left my house key at home, so--

272
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,950
The passcode is enough
to unlock it, you know that.

273
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,830
Right.

274
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,370
I'm, uh, late for study hall.
I'll get going.

275
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,340
Here's how you get

276
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:50,720
the numerical value
of the average rate of change.

277
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,930
The increase in X is A minus B.

278
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:55,560
That gives you delta X.

279
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,560
Thanks.

280
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:58,730
I'll try solving it from here.

281
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:03,770
Tae-ho, you lived in the States
before coming here, right?

282
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:05,860
Yeah.

283
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,740
So you wouldn't have any friends in Korea.

284
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,910
Mm, you could say that.

285
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:13,080
UNIVERSITY OF MANNHEIM

286
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,330
Mannheim?

287
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:17,620
Not the UK or America?

288
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:21,460
Everyone is going to the UK or America.
I wanted to go somewhere quiet.

289
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,420
Somewhere without any
Jooshin kids, you mean?

290
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,510
Well, not necessarily.

291
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,670
You're different from the others,
aren't you, Tae-ho?

292
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,590
I am?

293
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,300
You're the heir to Jaeyul Hotels,

294
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,390
yet you interact
with the students like me.

295
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,310
And the new kid…

296
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,190
Kang Ha is your friend.

297
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,270
Who says that?

298
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,360
I mean, who says I'm friends
with that scholarship asshole?

299
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,860
I saw you and Kang Ha
eating a burger together.

300
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,700
Wh…what are you saying?

301
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,030
Don't worry.

302
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,280
You know I'm discreet.

303
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:56,910
I won't tell.

304
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,000
Speaking of Kang Ha…

305
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,500
don't you think he looks a lot like
the kid who died?

306
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,660
Hey. Are you crazy?

307
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,580
Are you fucking stupid, asshole?

308
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,960
What the fuck were you doing
with Jae-i, huh?

309
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,910
Huh?

310
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,960
Answer me.
What's this asshole's name again?

311
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,170
Kang In-han?

312
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:50,260
You must think you're tough, huh?
You son of a bitch.

313
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,550
You stupid asshole.

314
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:53,380
Little shit!

315
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:54,930
Hey.

316
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,510
Get up!

317
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:29,960
You scholarship kids
are always hiding in the ugliest places.

318
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:36,180
You should be thanking me,
don't you think?

319
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,470
Thanking you?

320
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:40,720
Even the elite of the elite find it hard
to make eye contact with Jae-i's father.

321
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,890
And thanks to me, you were introduced.
That's quite an accomplishment for you.

322
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,900
You only did that
to put Jae-i on the spot.

323
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:52,320
You should be apologizing
to her and me. Honestly.

324
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,940
You should be apologizing to her.

325
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:57,410
If you think about it,
you're the one who put Jae-i on the spot.

326
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,070
Just by being around her.

327
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,830
Would you like to hear a story?

328
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,880
Honey, there was a kid here
before that was just like you.

329
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,880
He was close with Jae-i too.

330
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:16,380
Have you heard the rest of it yet?

331
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,510
I'm sure you have.

332
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,850
You mean the scholarship kid
Kim Ri-an killed?

333
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:25,810
Ri-an?

334
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,600
Ri-an is Jooshin's heir.

335
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,270
Why would he bother
with a mere scholarship kid?

336
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:39,450
If you're really looking for someone
to blame, I'd say it was actually

337
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,530
Jae-i who was behind it.

338
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,330
Jae-i was behind it?

339
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,420
Whatever sympathy
Jae-i tried to show him,

340
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,090
he never should've accepted it.

341
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,800
If he hadn't, that tragic accident
may never have happened.

342
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,850
Jae-i's the one… who killed him.

343
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:12,860
Don't think this has
nothing to do with you.

344
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,730
You'll be exactly the same.

345
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:18,400
Whenever a scholarship kid
gets mixed up with us, there are issues.

346
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:21,360
In the end, no matter
how bad the consequences get,

347
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,620
they never seem to reach us.

348
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,870
It's people like you who suffer.

349
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:35,840
And why are you telling me this now?

350
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:37,630
Concern?

351
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:39,170
For everyone's sake.

352
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,970
Nobody wants to see
another tragedy happen.

353
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:22,680
Whoo!

354
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,560
No, seriously.
I have to go shopping today.

355
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:35,520
I got my personal
color analysis yesterday.

356
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:37,360
-Oh yeah?
-Guess what I got.

357
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,030
-Summer?
-Not cool winter?

358
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,530
-Right. It's summer.
-Smell.

359
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:42,950
-I need to get new makeup.
-Nice, right?

360
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,160
We have a time limit now?

361
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,830
You're being exiled to New York?

362
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,880
I wanted to have some more fun,
but I guess we won't have time.

363
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:24,510
HAHA

364
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,600
HAHA

365
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,620
Jae-i.

366
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,830
What's wrong? What's going on?

367
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:55,540
Jung Jae-i!

368
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,540
Leave her alone.

369
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:01,040
Don't you get it? This is all your fault!

370
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:02,460
How is this my fault?

371
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,510
She's always been anxious.

372
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,220
But now, her father knows

373
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:10,090
there's a scholarship student
sniffing around his daughter.

374
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,510
Think about that.

375
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:14,430
Think about the pressure
she's under, thanks to you.

376
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:16,600
Do you have any idea
what that's doing to her?

377
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,440
Do you have any idea what we
have to deal with every single day?

378
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:23,570
Of course not. How could you understand?

379
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:28,190
I'm so sick of you
tryhard scholarship pricks.

380
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,990
This must be how he looked at In-han

381
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,450
right before he killed him.

382
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:44,170
Listen to me.

383
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,500
I consider you a threat to Jae-i's safety.

384
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:48,210
Your kind always is.

385
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,220
Always.

386
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,430
Whoa, whoa!

387
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:58,270
Ri-an, Ri-an! You don't need to
waste your time with this prick.

388
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,850
We'll deal with it, okay?

389
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:01,850
-We'll deal with it.
-Let's go.

390
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:06,190
Where the hell do you think you're going?
Come here.

391
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,650
Man, you guys are terrifying.

392
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:13,200
I'm not about to
wind up dead somewhere, am I?

393
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:17,080
You know, like the other
scholarship kid you killed.

394
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,470
Wow, look at your faces.

395
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:35,640
Did I hit a nerve? Am I not supposed to
bring that up in front of Kim Ri-an?

396
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,190
Kang Ha.

397
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:49,980
Who are you?

398
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,210
Parade, riposte. Touche.

399
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,130
Prêts.

400
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:10,590
Allez.

401
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,310
Prêts.

402
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:20,890
Allez.

403
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,690
Attaque, touche, point.

404
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:27,230
Prêts. Allez.

405
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:36,110
Attaque, touche, point.

406
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,000
Thanks.

407
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,920
Can you do a background check for me
on the new kid?

408
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:56,380
Why all of a sudden?

409
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:58,510
From the moment he got to Jooshin,

410
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:01,560
all that scholarship kid can talk about
is how he doesn't want any trouble.

411
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,230
But he still comes after me
every chance he can get.

412
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,600
Like he has nothing to be afraid of.

413
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:09,020
I think you're right about that.

414
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:12,570
Nobody would act like that unless
they thought they had a good reason.

415
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:16,820
I'm suddenly curious about what that is.

416
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,000
You want an apology.

417
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,540
But you won't get one.

418
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:32,550
I don't want your apology.
It wouldn't mean anything anyway.

419
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:38,300
What happened with the thing I asked you?

420
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:42,560
After everything, you only care
if your chore gets done?

421
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:45,220
It's someone at school.

422
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:49,150
Whoever sent you those messages
sent them from Jooshin High.

423
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:51,940
I hope you're happy

424
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:54,400
because that's the last favor
I ever do for you.

425
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:55,990
From now on,

426
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:58,860
we're no longer friends.

427
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,030
You never thought of me
as a friend anyway.

428
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,620
Face it. We've burned our last bridge.

429
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:09,580
What's the point of hanging out
and pretending everything's all right?

430
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:11,960
You done?

431
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:17,300
Since we're not friends,
I'll just come out and say it.

432
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,510
I like Ri-an.

433
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,590
God, I didn't wanna say this.

434
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:24,060
It's so childish and cliché,
but I l liked him first!

435
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,310
Way before you. Since kindergarten.

436
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:30,480
I've been holding back and letting you
have him because we were best friends.

437
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,400
But that's all over.

438
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,150
From now on…

439
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,280
Ri-an is mine.

440
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:47,160
Go ahead.

441
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:50,710
He's all yours.

442
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:54,040
It's better this way.

443
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:57,800
Are you disappointed?

444
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:01,340
What? Were you expecting me
to slap you across the face?

445
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,470
Don't get me wrong.

446
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,770
I'm mad enough
to do a lot worse than that.

447
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:13,650
But like you said,
we're not friends anymore.

448
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,860
Fighting, getting angry…

449
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,450
What would even be the point?

450
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,510
Jae-i,
on the count of three,

451
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,800
let's jump in together!

452
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,680
Okay, He-ra.

453
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,600
One, two, three!

454
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:59,480
-He-ra.
-Jae-i.

455
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:09,740
Hey, wait. I'm gonna take a video.

456
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:15,920
We didn't take a picture of this yet.
Cheese!

457
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:49,580
What's wrong with me?
Why am I crying?

458
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:54,460
Please. He-ra is supposed to
graduate next year.

459
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,000
Can't anything be done?

460
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:59,710
I could send her abroad
to study with your second child.

461
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:02,460
I remember he always liked He-ra,
didn't he?

462
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,930
The whole company is about to collapse.

463
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:09,680
I know you have the connections
to get us with Jooshin. Please, Mr. Kim!

464
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:14,350
It's about survival now,
Yoon He-ra.

465
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,810
Snap out of it.

466
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,370
You'll see a lot of the chairman's son
when you move to New York.

467
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:35,330
Have you ever met him before?

468
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:39,040
I haven't. I've heard about him,
but we've never spoken.

469
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:42,340
We planned tonight's dinner
so you two could get acquainted.

470
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:46,300
But I also plan to discuss Jaeyul Group's
electric car issues with Chairman Park.

471
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,800
You know what you should do.

472
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,050
It's a big night for us,
so don't mess it up, okay?

473
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:52,970
Okay.

474
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,780
There's something
I need to check.

475
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:08,900
Can you get the scholarship kid's
student record for me?

476
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,380
All right.
I'll have it ready for you.

477
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:32,850
There was nothing special about him.

478
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,060
Yeah. You're right.

479
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:40,100
But I still can't shake the feeling
that something isn't right.

480
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,100
He's just a scholarship student.

481
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,230
I mean, why do you care so much?

482
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,440
Good question.

483
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,610
Why does he bother me so much?

484
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:02,710
So an anonymous account
just sent you this video and nothing else?

485
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,710
Yeah. Who could it be?

486
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,670
Whoever sent it to me
knows who my brother is.

487
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,760
Yoon He-ra said she thinks
In-han's accident was Jae-i's fault,

488
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,680
not Kim Ri-an's.

489
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,560
She said that? Why now, all of a sudden?

490
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:21,890
Well, she's not exactly wrong.
They were basically all accomplices.

491
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:22,850
No way.

492
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,020
The Jae-i I know is different.

493
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:26,520
In what way?

494
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:29,150
She isn't mean and selfish
like Kim Ri-an and Yoon He-ra.

495
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:44,210
These two make
a great-looking pair, don't you think?

496
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:48,630
I guess this is what people mean
when they say, "a match made in heaven."

497
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,300
My dear, I'm sorry for the other night.

498
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,840
I was mistaken about Ri-an,
and I apologize.

499
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:57,510
It's alright, really.

500
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,520
You know how these rumors start.
It wasn't worthy of your concern.

501
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,100
I hope you'll understand, Mr. Seon-jun.

502
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:04,940
Oh please. There's nothing to discuss.

503
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,570
With friendships between
people of our caliber,

504
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:09,360
there's always bound to be talk.

505
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,780
I don't pay it any mind.

506
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:13,990
I can see you're destined
for great things.

507
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,950
Rest assured,
when Jae-i comes to New York,

508
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:18,660
I'll take excellent care of her.

509
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:21,290
We should get engaged
right after you graduate,

510
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:23,330
then attend university together.

511
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:26,250
Whose son is this?

512
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:29,420
I've never seen him
rush into anything so fast before.

513
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:32,630
Well, if we're going to do it,
what's the point of waiting?

514
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,720
Besides, there's only so many families
that make a suitable match.

515
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,850
Honestly, I was just hoping
to find somebody pretty.

516
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:42,480
And she's more than that. She's perfect.

517
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,770
I should claim her while I can.

518
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:48,980
I was worried that
they might not get along.

519
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:51,070
I see my concern was misplaced.

520
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:53,280
Please enjoy. Eat up, Jae-i.

521
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:56,610
Thanks.

522
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:14,470
Jae-i?

523
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:17,640
I meant what I said earlier during dinner.

524
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,430
I'm aware for people like us,
marriage can feel…

525
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:23,060
Remember this?

526
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:26,850
Our lives will be
suffocating enough when we're married.

527
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:27,900
JJJ_J_00
HAS SENT A PHOTO

528
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:31,110
-Does Kim Ri-an know?
-I get it. Really.

529
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,320
Do you like dogs?
I have a lot of them in New York.

530
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:49,960
Maybe I should be asking
if Ri-an is involved at all.

531
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,730
Jae-i?

532
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,570
I like you more than I thought
it was possible to like anyone.

533
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:18,110
You don't have to be anxious anymore.
I'll make you smile.

534
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,490
I'll be by your side.

535
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:23,450
Ugh! What the fuck?

536
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:24,540
You psycho!

537
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:26,870
Jesus.

538
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,580
Oh shit.

539
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,720
Out of all of
Shakespeare's sonnets,

540
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:46,350
this is the most famous.

541
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:47,680
"Sonnet 18."

542
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:50,020
"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?"

543
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,150
Published for the first time in 1609.

544
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:55,900
As you all know,
Shakespeare lived 400 years ago.

545
00:42:55,980 --> 00:43:00,610
As such, there are many archaic phrases
from that time seen in this poem too.

546
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:05,780
The poem was written in iambic pentameter,
which means ten syllables in…

547
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:00,760
Hello.

548
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,680
Better keep your promise
about that date.

549
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,720
Of course. You know me.

550
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:06,220
Now move it.

551
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:17,150
I came
because Seon-u asked me.

552
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:20,940
But I have no idea
what you'd wanna see me for.

553
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:24,320
I thought… we could become friends.

554
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,830
But… but you hardly
know me at all.

555
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:30,330
Of course I do!

556
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,200
At the very least,

557
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,370
I know how much
you hate your older sister.

558
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:44,260
Oh.

559
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:52,680
I'm having a party. Wanna come?
Bring Si-u if you can.

560
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:54,850
-Just ask him yourself.
-You ask him!

561
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:06,410
Why hasn't Jae-i been in school?
Why isn't she answering my calls?

562
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:09,950
Did you forget how to talk?

563
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:11,540
I'm asking you what's going on.

564
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:13,080
Whatever it is, it's her business.

565
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:16,830
I don't see any reason
to tell you a thing.

566
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:22,250
You don't know either, do you?

567
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:39,400
-She's been banished.
-She what?

568
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,190
There was a dinner for Seon-jun's family
of the Gongseong Group.

569
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:44,110
I don't know what she said there,

570
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:45,740
but she must've ruined it.

571
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:48,110
And so Jae-i's enraged father
must have said,

572
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,660
"Forget school or anything else,
and get her out of my sight."

573
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:52,450
She's at their vacation house.

574
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:55,160
And when she's unbanished?
She'll be sent to New York City.

575
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:56,370
New York?

576
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:57,830
Just like that?

577
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,670
Hey, don't you dare go
and tell Ri-an where Jae-i went.

578
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:02,800
I'm on fire right now.

579
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,420
Get in my way, and I'll destroy you.

580
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:06,840
"Get in your way"?
What are you plotting now?

581
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:15,100
How do I look?

582
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:16,140
Pretty?

583
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:17,770
I… I… I'm sorry?

584
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:19,940
What are you doing?

585
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:43,000
I must be pretty today.

586
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:44,500
That reaction is all I need.

587
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:47,050
Thanks for the confirmation, Woo-jin.

588
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:13,490
KIM RI-AN

589
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:36,680
RECENT CALLS

590
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,220
JAE-I

591
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:43,020
186 Biseong-ro.
That's Jae-i's vacation house address.

592
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:44,770
Apparently, she's been banished there.

593
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:47,230
Don't you think her boyfriend
should be there for her?

594
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,430
SLIDE TO ANSWER

595
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:00,140
Jae-i.

596
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:03,560
What are you doing here?

597
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:20,450
I was worried. I couldn't reach you,
and you weren't even in school.

598
00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:22,870
What are you doing here?

599
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:28,500
Tell me what's going on.
Tell me what I can do to help you.

600
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:34,550
Go.

601
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,260
You can't help with anything.

602
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:39,050
No, I can help.

603
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:42,890
Whatever it is, it's better
than going through it alone.

604
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:50,400
Why do you keep pushing me away?
You look like you're about to collapse.

605
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:52,820
I can tell how much pain you're in.

606
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:56,110
How do you expect to survive
if you keep shutting me out?

607
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:00,160
Let go.

608
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:01,580
No way.

609
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:05,120
No matter what happens,
I'll stay by your side.

610
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:11,080
Please just leave me alone!

611
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:14,090
What can you do for me?

612
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:18,470
I'm being blackmailed,
and I don't even know who's behind it.

613
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:23,760
So tell me.

614
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:26,930
What could you possibly do to help?

615
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:32,060
Blackmailed?

616
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:36,190
By who?

617
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:39,070
And for what?

618
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:41,110
What could you be blackmailed over?

619
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:45,740
I killed someone.

620
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:54,210
What?

621
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:01,510
I said I killed someone.

622
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:11,940
Kim Ri-an.

623
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:16,730
This is a surprise. Why are you here?

624
00:51:17,610 --> 00:51:19,150
I have something to say.

625
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:25,450
I've thought it over, and this is
the only card I have left to play.

626
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:27,580
Although, just saying it
isn't really my style.

627
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:28,580
What card?

628
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:33,420
Jae-i's off to New York
with Park Seon-jun.

629
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,960
Which means that ship has sailed.

630
00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:41,300
She's at her vacation home. She's gonna
stay there until her move to New York.

631
00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:47,470
So listen carefully
to what I have to say, Kim Ri-an.

632
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:50,980
It's over between you and her.
You can't stop her from leaving.

633
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:55,860
Start a new life with me.

634
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:01,820
I like you, Ri-an.

635
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:04,410
More than that, I love you.
I have for a long time.

636
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,530
So why don't we make it official?

637
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,010
Jae-i.

638
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:23,010
You said she's at her vacation house?

639
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:31,640
KANG IN-HAN, KANG HA
FRATERNAL TWIN BROTHERS

640
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:37,270
You killed someone?

641
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:39,860
Who?

642
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,700
A scholarship kid.

643
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,240
Kang In-han.

644
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:03,300
He was…

645
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:10,010
my brother.

646
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,360
The person you just said you killed…

647
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:26,820
was my brother.
