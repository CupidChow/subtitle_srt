BIG MOUTH

3
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,754
THIS SHOW IS A WORK OF FICTION

4
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:48,965
THE EVENTS AND ENTITIES
THAT APPEAR HEREIN ARE FICTIONAL

CHANGHO: Big Mouse knows everything.

9
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:09,819
He knows how I'm beating the monsters
and what I've gained.

10
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:13,698
(door opens)

11
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:18,328
How fierce the fights were
and how close I came to dying.

12
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,664
(door closes)

13
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,086
OH * CHUL

14
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:31,549
(suspenseful music)

15
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:36,554
If you want conclusive intel
regarding Seo Jaeyoung's paper,

16
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,807
come here by 8 p.m. tomorrow.

17
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:43,019
If you don't show up,
I won't help you anymore.

18
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,396
(footsteps approaching)

19
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:56,324

(music stops)

23
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:26,563
You called me here. Tell me what you want.

24
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:33,319
You're Big Mouse?

25
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:35,446
Think about it.

26
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:39,534
All of the strange things
that happened in here.

27
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,454
If it wasn't me...

28
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,833
there are no explanations for it.

29
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,670
(suspenseful music)

30
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,463
And the guys who died in the mess hall?

31
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:56,176
WARDEN PARK: I gave them cyanide
and told them it was a sedative.

32
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,595
Then they died on their own.

33
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,057
And the person who gave me
the list of real drug users?

34
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,562
Of course, it was me.

35
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,315
OH CHANSOO, HONG SEOKHWAN, CHOO SOOYEON,
PARK GARAM, LUCAS MARTINS

36
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,861
What about the gold found in the ground?

37
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,696
That place had no cameras
or tapping devices.

38
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:18,990
POSITION NO. A-2, GUDAL MOUNTAIN

39
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,617
Was that magic, not a trick?

40
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,829
I didn't come out here
to tell you all my secrets.

41
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,541
WARDEN PARK: Tell me what you know
about Seo Jaeyoung's paper.

42
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,002
What's the conclusive intel?

43
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,591
(music intensifies)

44
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,513
(tense music)

45
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,641
That's for when we don't meet.

46
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:48,186
Tell me yourself.

47
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,316
(music stops)

48
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:57,779
I still have my doubts
that you're the real Big Mouse.

49
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,116
(Warden Park scoffs)

50
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,751
Is this...

51
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:14,754
enough to believe me?

52
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:21,010
(ominous music)

53
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,971

(Changho laughs)

55
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:27,976
You're not Big Mouse.

56
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,061
What?

57
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:32,146
(suspenseful music)

58
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,821
CHANGHO: An owner doesn't wear a leash.

59
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:44,826
He puts one on his dog.
A puppet, like you.

60
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:47,996
Tell Big Mouse

61
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,123
to show up himself.

62
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,293
If he touches my family
or does something stupid,

63
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:56,087
the truth about the paper you guys want

64
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,673
will disappear forever.

65
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,758

(device beeps)

70
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,962
CHANGHO:
Big Mouse. You need to suffer the same.

71
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,465
See how bad it feels.

72
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,384
(ominous music)

73
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,136

74
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:47,430
(chuckles)

75
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,891
What brings you here?

76
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,312
MIHO: Changho was mistaken.

77
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:58,274
MIHO: He thought you met Big Mouse.

78
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:04,322
If it will be helpful,
I'll be a witness at his trial.

79
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:05,406
(chuckles)

80
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,283
I'd be grateful if you did.

81
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,997
Take care of yourself.

82
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,957
JERRY: Okay. Goodbye.

83
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,168

13TH DIVISION COMMANDER

88
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,735
MAN (on TV):
When he retired, Chairman Kang Sunggeun

89
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:47,073
made NK Chemical's first factory
in Gucheon.

90
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,576
He created countless jobs.

91
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:55,206
The godfather of the chemical industry,

92
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:00,253
Chairman Kang always treated his employees
warmly like family.

93
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:01,671

96
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,605
Grandpa...

97
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,274
-Grandpa.
-MAN: Oh, no.

98
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,401
(somber music)

99
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:24,986
Grandpa.

100
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,779
(explosion)

101
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,743
BOY: Grandpa!

102
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:33,870
(crying)

103
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,788
Grandpa. No.

104
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,000
Grandpa. No.

105
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,128
BOY: Grandpa...

106
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,133
(somber music)

107
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:02,940
(associate sighs)

108
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,363
What brings you here, sir?

109
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:12,658
I was passing by,
and I heard Mayor Choi was here...

110
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,203
But why are you asking me that?

111
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,454
I'm sorry, sir.

112
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,331
Is he inside?

113
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,541
I'll tell him you're here.

114
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,419
Why? Is he with someone?

115
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,087
He asked that nobody come in.

116
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,714
Okay.

117
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:33,930
(door closes)

118
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:37,475
NK CHEMICAL'S ENGINEERS
AND THEIR FAMILIES

119
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,436
JIHOON: Why are you watching this?

120
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,856
(sighs)

121
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,360
(ominous music)

122
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,029
That little kid...

123
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,241
I thought this last time,

124
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:56,035
but he looks a lot like you.

125
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,286
(scoffs)

126
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:01,499
That's why I was watching it.
I thought it was interesting.

127
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,668
(ominous music)

128
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:07,380
I looked into him because of that...
(sighs)

129
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:10,091
...and it turns out he died
while playing in the river.

130
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,635
Our newspaper wrote an article about it.

131
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:15,054
What year was it again? It was 1990...

132
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,389
That's sad. He was so young.

133
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,057
(remote beeps)

134
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:19,976
(clanks)

135
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,519
(Jihoon laughs)

136
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,565
Aren't you making it too obvious?

137
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,820
You're here alone,

138
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:34,532
and you're watching that video.

139
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:39,120
Aren't you making it so obvious
you're drooling over the elder's business?

140
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:40,997
(imitates dog panting)

141
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:44,000
Can you get straight to the point?

142
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:48,713
You played a nice joke
with Seo Jaeyoung's paper this time.

143
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,423
(Mayor Choi laughs)

144
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:51,549
(scoffs)

145
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,551
(slurps)

146
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,429
Okay. I admit it.

147
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,681
I underestimated you.

148
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,976
I just thought of you as someone
with an ulterior motive,

149
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:06,814
but you're at a higher level
than I thought.

150
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,316
You should be grateful to me.

151
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,692
(scoffs)

152
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,572
I saved you from being strangled
by the elder.

153
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,742
(ominous music)

154
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:26,208
You should've hidden
who you were until the end.

155
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,377
Things won't go
according to your plan anymore

156
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,255
because I'll put up against you properly.

157
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:34,508
(tense music)

158
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:35,926
You're no match for me.

159
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,471
(chuckles)

160
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,265
(laughs)

161
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:44,810
If I'm not, who is?

162
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,147
(music intensifies)

163
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:55,905
Are you...

164
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,490
(scoffs)

165
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,494
(phone vibrating)

166
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,579
(music stops)

167
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,751
-Hello?
-It's me, Park Changho.

168
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,671
-MAYOR CHOI: Yes, I'm listening.
-(scoffs)

169
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,631
I'm being interrogated tomorrow.

170
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,843
I'm going to give them
important information about Big Mouse.

171
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,221
(tense music)

172
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:21,931
I can't trust Choi Joongrak.

173
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,725
Can you come? I need a witness.

174
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,023
MAYOR CHOI: Okay.

175
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,109
(music intensifies)

176
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,948
(ominous music)

177
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,618
(eerie music)

178
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:46,330
(exhales)

179
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,417
(eerie music)

180
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,547
(exhales sharply)

181
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,133
(tense music)

182
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,560
(clanks)

183
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,234
Hey. What are you doing?

184
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,278
Hey. Those are mine, punk!

185
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,779
(grunting)

186
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,198
(groans)

187
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,700
(panting)

188
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,994
INMATE: Hey. Give it back!

189
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,371
(clattering)

190
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:33,002
-INMATE 1: What are you doing?
-INMATE 2: Why are you fighting?

191
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,087
(grunting)

192
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,465
-INMATE 2: Somebody stop them!
-INMATE 3: Come here.

193
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,341
-Darn it. Move!
-INMATE 1: Stop them.

194
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,093
(clamoring)

195
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,720
INMATE 2: There's a fight in here!

196
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:43,929
GUARD: What are you doing?

197
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,264
(whistle blowing)

198
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,309
Inmate 1708.

199
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,644
Hey.

200
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,063
This is you.

201
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,486
(banging on table)

202
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,280
(banging continues)

203
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:04,116
ROOM LEADER: People are getting
into fights over those supplements.

204
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,701
It's insane.

205
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,369
Look at them.

206
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,289
They're all fighting like cats and dogs.

207
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:12,124
It makes sense.

208
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,295
They were all half-dead,
but those supplements made them better.

209
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:17,838
INMATE: You're right, Boss.

210
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,799
The medicine is really effective.

211
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,592
When they get into a fight,

212
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:24,553
not even the guards can stop them.

213
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,848
(room leader groans)

214
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:32,019
(tense music)

215
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,938
BLOOD TEST RESULTS
(GUCHEON PENITENTIARY INMATE)

216
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,147
NAME: NO HEEWOO

217
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:38,234
WOMAN (over PA):
Please come to Ward 92 immediately.

218
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,404
I think we should change the medication.

219
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,407
The inmates are showing side effects.

220
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,326
Last time this happened, Professor Seo...

221
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:48,452
DR. HAN: Hey.

222
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,621
That was Seo Jaeyoung's prescription.

223
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,375
Are you a doctor?
Why are you making diagnoses?

224
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:57,461
CHAEBONG: You just need to do
what we tell you to do.

225
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,672
You're too experienced to be lectured.

226
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,841
We've been working together
for ten years already.

227
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:02,967
I'm sorry.

228
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,010
By any chance,

229
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:09,306
did Dr. Hyun ask about what
Seo Jaeyoung was doing?

230
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,599
No, never.

231
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,601
(chuckles)

232
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,646
-You can go back to work.
-Yes, sir.

233
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,649
(suspenseful music)

234
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:23,320
See?
Hyun Juhee never gets her hands dirty.

235
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:26,115
Even Choi Doha said
this was a secret from his wife.

236
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:28,659
-But...
-(pills rattle)

237
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:31,120
...do you think there will be problems
if we keep going?

238
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,415
My gosh. Weren't there problems before?
It always fizzled out,

239
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,209
and the elder complimented us.

240
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:42,089
That's true. There have to be problems
for us to have something to do.

241
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,507
That's right.

242
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,634
(Chaebong laughs)

243
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,720
(music intensifies)

244
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,306
(music fades)

245
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,144
Don't you think
about the hospital's image?

246
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,729
Why are you here?

247
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:01,275
He's a doctor, he's your legal counsel,
and I'm a director of the foundation.

248
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,985
How could you ask us that?

249
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:06,530
The three of you will be fired
at the board of directors' meeting.

250
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,991
If we get fired, who will take care
of matters for the center?

251
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,075
Are you going to do it?

252
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,578
There are plenty of people
the elder can replace you with.

253
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:15,205
(ominous music)

254
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,291
Then we'd be upset.

255
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:21,295
We killed a man
to prove our loyalty to the elder.

256
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:27,426
Keep living in the sun
and acting like you're pure and innocent.

257
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:31,096
We'll take care
of everything wet and dark.

258
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,223
Let's go.

259
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,726
How dare you threaten us?

260
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,562
(tense music)

261
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,200
(inmates clamoring)

262
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,285
INMATE 1: Hey. Pass. Nice.

263
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,912
-INMATE 2: That's right.
-INMATE 1: Nice.

264
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,582
GUARD: Inmate 5247. Get ready to go out.

265
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,543
(ominous music)

266
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:11,387
WARDEN PARK: Peter Hong...
I'm sure you know him.

267
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:15,140
He let his mouth run on
and ended up dead from a heart attack

268
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,142
at the Prosecutors' Office.

269
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:22,064
Go and get interrogated,
but don't do anything stupid.

270
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:26,068
Why? Are you afraid I'll drop a bomb?

271
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:29,321
Nobody would believe you
even if you run your mouth.

272
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,073
Do you think so?

273
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,367
You've been doing so well.

274
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,285
Why do you keep taking detours?

275
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,870
That's the edge of a cliff.

276
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,208
Just bring Big Mouse to me.

277
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,794
CHANGHO:
Then our relationship will continue.

278
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,671
If he doesn't like it, we'll be enemies.

279
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:48,424
(suspenseful music)

280
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,894
(door closes)

281
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,233
These are the résumés of the nurses
you'll interview this afternoon.

282
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:13,282
RÉSUMÉ
NAME: JANG HEEJU

283
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,409
RÉSUMÉ
NAME: KO MIHO

284
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,494
(music intensifies)

285
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,835
NAME: KO MIHO

286
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:30,507
JUHEE: It's an important seminar,
so of course, I'll be there.

287
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:36,138
Yes, sir. I'll see you then.

288
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:37,973
(phone beeps)

289
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,558
JUHEE: What are you doing in my office?

290
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:41,018
I was waiting for you.

291
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,145
(Chaebong slurps)

292
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:46,940
Coffee always tasted best
when you made it yourself.

293
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:51,862
I have guests coming.

294
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,697
If you have something to say,
say it and go.

295
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:57,618
I heard you're sending Ms. Park
and Ms. Jang to the penitentiary.

296
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,870
The warden asked. Why?

297
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:02,247
Gosh, you should've talked to me first.

298
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,541
You know I know my way around that prison.

299
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,794
I could've given you
a lot of good information.

300
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:09,296
If you're done with your coffee,
can you leave?

301
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,049
(percussive music)

302
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:15,385
(Chaebong inhales deeply, exhales heavily)

303
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:21,058
Can you stop our dismissal
at the board of directors' meeting?

304
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,436
Think of our past together.

305
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,105
We were as close as family.

306
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:32,361
That issue is out of my hands.

307
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,280
You people could try appealing
to the directors yourselves.

308
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,868
(laughs)

309
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,538
(sighs)

310
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:46,041
(Chaebong panting)

311
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:47,960
(exhales)

312
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,671
How did it seem?

313
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,048
Do you think Hyun Juhee
knows we changed the meds?

314
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,341
No. Not at all.

315
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:56,218
DOOGEUN: You should keep checking.

316
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,220
The moment she finds out, we're dead.

317
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,848
We should talk to Ms. Park
and shut her mouth.

318
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,100
You should meet her tonight.

319
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,643
(sighs)

320
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,520
You do it. I don't have time.

321
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,438
CHAEBONG: Why don't you have time?

322
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,357
Because of Hyejin?

323
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:13,652
Hey. How will you find
someone who left the country?

324
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:15,529
DOOGEUN: What will you do if you find her?

325
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:16,613
You're divorced now.

326
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,491
(breathing heavily)

327
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:23,704
(breathes heavily, sighs)

328
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:25,747
Seriously...

329
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:29,793
(Chaebong slurps)

330
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,004
I'll meet Ms. Park.

331
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,047
He's practically a patient now.

332
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:38,510
(indistinct chattering)

333
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,679

335
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,023
INMATE 1: Who? Is it him?

336
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,107
Don't look at him.

337
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,734
-Don't provoke him.
-INMATE 2: All right.

338
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,485
(psychopath exhales)

339
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,779
(indistinct chattering continues)

340
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:05,871
Hey. Isn't that Big Mouse's wife?

341
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,247
Is she here to see him?

342
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:10,709
Changho's at the Prosecutors' Office.

343
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:17,758
FAITH AND CONSIDERATION, HAPPY GUCHEON

344
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,928
Welcome.

345
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,054
(Warden Park clears throat)

346
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,016
Have a seat.

347
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:33,106
Ms. Ko, are you looking to get a job here?

348
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:36,318
Yes. Did you two also quit the hospital?

349
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,737
No. We came to provide support.

350
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,865
WARDEN PARK: Thank you for applying.

351
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,243
But...
(clears throat)

352
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:48,705
Ms. Ko, you applied
for a full-time position.

353
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:49,790
Yes.

354
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:52,793
I guess I should say this
before things get complicated.

355
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:57,130
We cannot work alongside Ms. Ko Miho.

356
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,175
Oh, is that so?

357
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,470
I don't want to work here
with them either.

358
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,556
(ominous music)

359
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,268
-(scoffs)
-Then I guess I have no choice.

360
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:14,064
(inmates clamoring)

361
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:16,483

362
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,657
(clamoring continues)

363
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,246
INMATE: Stop it. Hey!

364
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,082
(shrieks)

365
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:38,171
Not only have I worked in the ER,
but I've also been a PA for three years.

366
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,340
I am confident
I can handle any emergencies

367
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,967
that may arise in the prison.

368
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,927
WARDEN PARK:
What's the reason why you insisted

369
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,512
on applying here with your experience?

370
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:46,680
Is it...

371
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:49,516
because of your husband?

372
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:55,230
-To be honest...
-(alarm blaring)

373
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,446
(inmates clamoring)

374
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,742
Everyone get on the floor.

375
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,161
(taser guns clicking)

376
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,831
Get on the floor, you punks!

377
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,878
Inmate 1503.
Hands on your head and get on your knees.

378
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:19,463
(psychopath laughs maniacally)

379
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:21,548
ROOM LEADER: Was he always like that?

380
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:22,758
He's a complete lunatic.

381
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,259
(laughing continues)

382
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,803
-Subdue him.
-(guards grunting)

383
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:29,931
(inmates clamoring)

384
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:34,561
I can't help but think that he's on drugs.

385
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:38,607
-Narcotics.
-No way.

386
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,693
How could he get his hands
on drugs in here?

387
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,738
(screaming)

388

413
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:02,649
Inmate 1503 isn't breathing.

414
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:04,234
GUARD: I think he's in cardiac arrest.

415
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:07,028
We need an emergency kit
and a defibrillator.

416
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,488
-Where is it?
-Show her.

(door opens)

418
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,326
Call 911 first.

419
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,786
Which way is the field?

420
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,288
Follow me.

421
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:18,832

Why won't this work? It's not turning on!

432
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:02,417
I think it's out of batteries.

HEAD NURSE:
You brought it without checking?

NURSE: You brought it.

435

Please take care of him.

Hurry up and get in.

Not you.

00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,261
Please.

(chuckles)

451
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,765
Of course. It's my job as a nurse.

452
00:25:58,848 --> 00:25:59,975

EMERGENCY RESCUE

There are a lot of things we must improve
in the medical room.

457
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,246
You can go back.

458
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,208
I'll call you with the results

KIKWANG: Hey.

463
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:44,019
Is Changho really being interrogated
by the Prosectors' Office?

464
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,937
Yes. Didn't Miho tell you?

465
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:49,524
Then you should've told me.

466
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,985
SOONTAE: Are you leaving me out
when I'm his lawyer?

467
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:56,656
My gosh. Mistaking our signs
in a game happens from time to time.

468
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,784
Changho's a lawyer too,
so he can take care of himself.

469
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,286
Don't worry.

470
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:03,622
Did you eat? Have a bite.

471
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:05,999
I'm a bit upset about this.

472
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,668
(ominous music)

473
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,265
PROSECUTOR: You're here, senior.

474
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:25,977
Call me Mayor.
I don't want to hear that from you.

475
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,480
Shall we?

476
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:33,818
PROSECUTOR: Park Changho said he'll plead
the fifth until you come.

477
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,779
It was hard to keep a straight face.

478
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:38,823
I felt bad for him
after seeing how much trust he has in you.

479
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:41,368
(tense music)

480
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,578
I heard from Mr. Gong.

481
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,789
The hidden accomplice
in Seo Jaeyoung's case...

482
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:49,793
A prosecutor wins using evidence.
Not rumors.

483
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,461
I heard you got rid of the evidence.

484
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,505
It'll be fine then.

485
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:09,813
(door closes)

486
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:11,898
(ominous music)

487
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:17,320
I listened to your demands and brought
someone hard to call in. Tell us now.

488
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:21,741
Before that,
why aren't you dropping my drug charges?

489
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,660
Why are you talking nonsense
from the start?

490
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:27,163
You know as well as I do
that Gong Jihoon drugged me.

491
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,666
You're here as a Big Mouse suspect.

492
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:30,917
Not drugs.

493
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,546
That's when my life started falling apart,
so we should fix that first.

494
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,425
MAYOR CHOI: That dashcam video...

495
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:41,386
I'll give it to the prosecutor myself.

496
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:46,266
It won't be good for you to get involved
since you know the suspects.

497
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:47,851
Fine.

498
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,936
(tense music)

499
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,069
WOMAN: Are you leaving already?
Please, drink this on your way.

500
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,197
(groans)

501
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,866
(crashing)

502
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:07,620
You haven't indicted him
for the drug charges yet, right?

503
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,372
PROSECUTOR: No.

504
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:12,709
I'll make sure
you get the charges dropped,

505
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:15,128
so let's move on.

506
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,337
(door creaks open)

507
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:18,798
(door closes)

508
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,345
MAYOR CHOI: Okay. Tell us.

509
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:27,474
What is this important information
you have on Big Mouse?

510
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:34,731
If you're lying to us, I'll hit you
with additional punishment, so be aware.

511
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:36,691
(smirks)

512
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,194
(music intensifies)

513
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:42,447
What in the world are you doing now?

514
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,368
(tense music)

515
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:48,953
(device beeps)

516
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,998
WARDEN PARK: You called me here.
Tell me what you want.

517
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:55,001
CHANGHO: You're Big Mouse?

518
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:57,545
WARDEN PARK: Think about it.

519
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:01,257
All of the strange things
that happened in here.

520
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:04,427
If it wasn't me,
there are no explanations for it.

521
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,888
CHANGHO:
And the guys who died in the mess hall?

522
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:10,642
WARDEN PARK: I gave them cyanide
and told them it was a sedative.

523
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:12,894
Then they died on their own.

524
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:16,147
CHANGHO: And the person who gave me
the list of real drug users?

525
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:18,650
WARDEN PARK: Of course, it was me.

526
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,318
(device beeps)

527
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:21,986
CHANGHO: This is all I'll reveal.

528
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,488
Hey, are you kidding me?

529
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:25,365
I'll play the full version in court.

530
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:27,909
Do you recognize this voice?

531
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,871
It sounds like Park Yoongab.

532
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:34,332
-Park Yoongab?
-Yes, the warden.

533
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:38,545
The warden is Big Mouse?

534
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:40,880
(tense music)

535
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:44,425
He's just one of his puppets.
The real Big Mouse is someone else.

536
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,970
What evidence do you have
that he's a puppet?

537
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:53,434
CHANGHO: The Magician Reversed.

538
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,562
It means, "I'm lying to you."

539
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:57,689
That's for when we don't meet.

540
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,234
Tell me yourself.

541
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:04,904
Big Mouse and I
have been exchanging signs...

542
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,408
and Warden Park couldn't read it.

543
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:11,703
How much did you give Warden Park?

544
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:13,997
PROSECUTOR:
I hear he's obsessed with money.

545
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,499
You gave him money
to falsify that recording, didn't you?

546
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,502
I understand your position.

547
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,881
You became a fool
because of Seo Jaeyoung's case,

548
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:25,341
but you arrested an innocent man
and put him in prison.

549
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,635
How will you handle the criticism?

550
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:30,013
Give me that recording.

551
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:35,643
Can you hold onto it, Mayor Choi?
I can't trust that man.

552
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,106
(prosecutor scoffs)

553
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:42,191
(ominous music)

554
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,069
You'll find out once you hear it,

555
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:47,739
but Big Mouse is very interested
in Seo Jaeyoung's paper.

556
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,284
(music intensifies)

557
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:59,208
MAYOR CHOI: Why is Big Mouse
so interested in that paper?

558
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,294
(tense music)

559
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:04,339
I honestly have no idea.

560
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:07,467
I'm not interested in anything
but catching him and clearing my name.

561
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:13,056
PROSECUTOR: Everything will come out
if we call Warden Park as a testifier.

562
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:16,351
A testifier?
You're not going to arrest him?

563
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:19,520
Do you think we can get a warrant
with an illegal recording?

564
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,858
Do you want me to give you a tip?

565
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:26,861

OPERATOR: Please open the door.

567
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:32,075
CHANGHO: Warden Park has been blackmailing
inmates to extort money.

568
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:35,036
Get an arrest warrant for corruption
and do a search and seizure.

569
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:38,373
CHANGHO: You'll find tons of
hidden cameras and bugs.

570
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:41,125
That's how he acted
as Big Mouse's right-hand man.

571
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,921
Once you get enough evidence on him,
I'll give you the rest of the recording.

572
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:47,382
We'll hit the final nail on the coffin.
It's clean.

573
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,468
If you're so smart,
you should've become a prosecutor.

574
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,179
Get an arrest warrant.

575
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,431
PROSECUTOR: What?

576
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:58,351
I'll provide you
with the support you need.

577
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,981
I didn't give you that recording.

578
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:07,735
You need to cover for me
if you want to catch Big Mouse.

579
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:12,657
I see. So that means Big Mouse
is inside the prison.

580
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,742
(suspenseful music)

581
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:16,995
Is there...

582
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:20,164
anyone you have in mind?

583
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,505

Give me the recording.

00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,485
Take care of Warden Park first.

588
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,112
Senior Choi.

589
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:56,701
Mayor Choi.

590
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:59,412
Don't call me your senior, you punk.

PROSECUTOR: What do you think?

593
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,010
Can we believe Park Changho?

594
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:18,931
He has evidence.
What can we do if we don't trust him?

595
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:21,142
What if we trust him?

596
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:22,977
You want me to overturn our investigation?

597
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:28,316
Just do whatever Choi Doha asks.

598
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,068
I'll step back from now on.

599

Just sit here quietly. Don't act out.

613
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,521
Doing this won't change anything.

614
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:32,607
The dice has been cast.

615
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,025
What dice?

616
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,360
The one with the upper hand will change.

617
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:38,779
The situation has changed.

618
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:42,325
The situation has changed indeed.

619
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,410
It went from a collar to shackles.

DOCTOR: There was nothing noteworthy.

631
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,783
Did he test positive for narcotics
or any other drugs?

632
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:25,660
I tested him, but he's clean.

633
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:29,038
That's strange. He didn't seem like
he was in his right mind.

634
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,666
Take him with you
when the patient wakes up.

635
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:34,710
New narcotics won't test positive.

You can start working tomorrow.

00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:47,760
(room leader chuckles)

660
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,350
What did you do outside?

661
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:57,978
ROOM LEADER:
You were close with Warden Park.

662
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:00,398
Did something happen?

663
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:03,442
He was annoying me, so I spat on him.

664
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,569
ROOM LEADER (chuckles):
I see why you're in solitary.

665
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,781
I'm a porter as of today.
I'm getting paid 30,000 won more daily.

666
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:11,242
Tell me if you need anything.

667
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:12,618
(giggles)

668
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:13,702
ROOM LEADER: Right.

669
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:17,748
Did you know that your wife got a job
here in the medical room?

670
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:19,375
Miho?

671
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:21,961
You didn't know? Today's her first day.

672
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:24,046
(percussive music)

673
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,714
Darn it.

674
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:27,967
CHANGHO: Hey, can I ask for a favor?

675
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:31,762
GUARD: Porter. Don't you know
you're not allowed to talk to inmates?

676
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,556
ROOM LEADER: I didn't talk to him.

677
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,266
He talked on his own.

678
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,017
(clanks)

679
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:40,438
(sighs)
My gosh, Ko Miho.

680
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:43,691
Miho, come on.

681
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,822
(tense music)

682
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:06,338
(suspenseful music)

683
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,092
(door creaks open)

684
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,769
WARDEN PARK: Welcome.

685
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:26,734
This man will be in charge
of all the odd jobs in here.

686
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:29,695
You could just call me Inmate 1420.

687
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:31,197
Okay.

688
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:35,701
I didn't see any doctors.
Do you not have any here full-time?

689
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:37,703
We had a public health physician,

690
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:39,997
but we haven't had any applicants
after he was discharged.

691
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,834
WARDEN PARK: You will have to work
a little harder until we find someone.

692
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,712
I'll show you around while he cleans.

693
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:49,089
(squeaking)

694
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:52,635
(mop screeching)

695
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:54,136
(door creaks open)

696
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:03,604
This place is quite empty when there
are no part-time staff here like today.

697
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:10,069
(slurping)

698
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:13,155
I heard you found an important clue

699
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,366
regarding Seo Jaeyoung's paper.

700
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:19,119
Park Changho told me.

701
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,288
He told me to ask you for the specifics.

702
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:23,958
I heard you're Big Mouse's right-hand man.

703
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,836
Changho told me too.

704
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,421
That's why I applied here.

705
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,757
I'll protect my own husband.

706
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:34,927
(chuckles)

707
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:37,596
I hate calculating,
and I'm bad at testing people.

708
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:41,684
Why don't we both open up
our hidden cards?

709
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,687
I suppose that would work for both of us.

710
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:48,524
Park Changho is in solitary.

711
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:50,609
(suspenseful music)

712
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:54,780
If you tell me about Seo Jaeyoung's paper,
I'll let him out right now.

713
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:01,161
Could you tell me
why you want to know first?

714
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:06,333
You're just asking questions
and not answering any of mine.

715
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:11,547
Let's try to get along.

716
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:20,055
ROOM LEADER: Excuse me. I'm done cleaning.

717
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:22,433
Okay. Thank you.

718
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:25,519
I'm really close with Changho.

719
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:27,313
We're from the same room.

720
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:28,606
(exclaims)

721
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:31,567
If you need anything, tell me.
I'll help you.

722
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:37,197
I would like to consult with the inmates
about their blood tests.

723
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:38,365
How should I do that?

724
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:41,452
It's easy. If I relay that message
to the other porters,

725
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:43,287
this place will be filled in no time.

726
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:46,415
Then could you do that for me?

727
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:48,459
Mister 1420.

728
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,210
ROOM LEADER: Gosh.

729
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,921
It's been ages
since anyone called me "mister."

730
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,214
(giggles)

731
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,633
Mister.

732
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:57,217
(room leader chuckles)

733
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:00,721
(suspenseful music)

734
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:04,600
Sir. Inmate 5247 requested a meeting.
What should I do?

735
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:14,109
WARDEN PARK: Yes?

736
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:22,868
(music stops)

737
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,245
(door closes)

738
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:26,872
I told you not to touch my family.

739
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:29,541
Your wife applied to come here,

740
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:31,877
and I chose her based on her skills.

741
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,337
(clanks)

742
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:37,424
(clatters)

743
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:38,592
Send her out right now.

744
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:41,387
-Or else...
-Do you think she would be safe out there?

745
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:43,931
(Changho grunts)

746
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:47,226
Big Mouse made an offer.

747
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,354
You want to know who Big Mouse is,

748
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:52,314
and we want to know
about Seo Jaeyoung's paper.

749
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:53,941
How about we reveal our cards?

750
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,359
You want to play 21 Questions?

751
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:57,611
Do you think it'll take 21 Questions?

752
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:00,030
We could get everything we need
with just a few questions.

753
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:02,116
(tense music)

754
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:04,493
Let me see Miho first.

755
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:06,578
Let's play the game first.

756
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:08,664
(music intensifies)

757
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,878
(music fades)

758
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:15,963
(Warden Park sighs)

759
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,131
I'll start.

760
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:21,176
Why is Big Mouse obsessed
with Seo Jaeyoung's paper?

761
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:25,305
Someone that Big Mouse cared for the most

762
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,182
died because of the paper.

763
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,269
My turn.

764
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:32,896
What's inside Seo Jaeyoung's paper?

765
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:35,649
Blood.

766
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,610
-Blood?
-The blood they took from inmates

767
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,863
on the premise of blood tests.

768
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:42,698
What about that blood?

769
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:48,120
Just tell Big Mouse that.
This is 21 Questions.

770
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:52,541
(suspenseful music)

771
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:57,713
ROOM LEADER: This place
is more dangerous than you think.

772
00:45:58,297 --> 00:45:59,923
Don't trust the correctional officers,

773
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:03,635
and try to go around with other people
from the medical room...

774
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:07,014
Gosh, my legs.

775
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:10,184
ROOM LEADER: Goodness.

776
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:12,561
(exhales)

777
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:19,276
(solemn music)

778
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:21,195
(Changho exhales)

779
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:32,706
(solemn music)

780
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:46,512
I heard.

781
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:48,972
You were in solitary?

782
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:52,226
Why did you do this without telling me?

783
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:54,645
I didn't have time to tell you.

784
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:56,980
Are you mad about that?

785
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:00,484
Miho, this place is...

786
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:03,654
I know it's dangerous.
I put a lot of thought into it.

787
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:07,199
CHANGHO: Miho.

788
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:10,786
(sighs)
I'm begging you. Quit right away.

789
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:14,081
Okay. I will.

790
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:16,917
In return, I want to hear your plan.

791
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:19,378
Tell me.

792
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,048
You know. First, Big Mouse...

793
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:24,675
MIHO: Not that.

794
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:28,053
How will you get the inmates' blood out?

795
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:32,391
I'll take care of it, so don't worry.

796
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:34,601
I'm not worried. I'm curious.

797
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:36,311
MIHO: To get the results without errors,

798
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:38,522
you have to do the plasmapheresis here.

799
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:41,692
I'm curious as to who is helping you
with such a complicated procedure.

800
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:46,530
I'll quit after I meet them. I'm serious.

801
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:47,739
Hey, Ko Miho!

802
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,199
MIHO: You don't have anyone.

803
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,952
It's obvious from your tough act
and calling me by my full name.

804
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:53,871
You don't. Right?

805
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,956
(solemn music)

806
00:47:57,082 --> 00:48:00,252
Miho. Something huge is about to happen.

807
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:01,962
You could be in real danger.

808
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:03,630
That's why I have to do it.

809
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:06,592
Who else would do something
dangerous for you?

810
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:13,348
(sirens wailing in distance)

811
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:15,434
(tense music)

812
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:18,020
(gasps)

813
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:22,190
(sirens wailing)

814
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:26,987
GUCHEON PENITENTIARY

815
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:30,657
Open up.

816
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:36,580
(music intensifies)

817
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:40,000
HOPE DOES NOT SHUN HE WHO SEEKS IT

818
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,669
I was wondering who it was.

819
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:45,422
What brings you here, Prosecutor Choi?

820
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:46,715
Park Yoongab.

821
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:51,011
You're under arrest
for the blackmail and extortion

822
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:52,638
of inmates.

823
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:54,181
PROSECUTOR: This is a search warrant.

824
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:56,266
(ominous music)

825
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:59,561
-Move.
-Does Mr. Gong know...

826
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,772
you're doing this to me?

827
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:06,485
What does this have to do with Mr. Gong?

828
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:09,988
Why didn't Dr. Han come with you?

829
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:11,823
DOOGEUN:
He's busy looking for Jang Hyejin.

830
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:14,326
She's left the country.

831
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:16,703
Someone said they saw Hyejin in Seoul.

832
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,373
Where?

833
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,249
Was it Itaewon?

834
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:23,168
Did you look at the entry records?

835
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:25,045
I did, but she's not in there.

836
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:26,338
That's why he's going crazy.

837
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:31,760
I think we need to get that Dr. Han
admitted to a mental hospital.

838
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:34,930
(phone vibrating)

839
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:37,099
WARDEN PARK YOONGAB

840
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:40,018
JIHOON: Hello, Warden Park.

841
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:45,691
What? An emergency arrest?
Those damn punks.

842
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,193
Put Prosecutor Choi on the phone.

843
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:50,195
Don't get worked up!

844
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:53,281
(tense music)

845
00:49:58,620 --> 00:49:59,830
Go ahead.

846
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:02,374
JIHOON: Yes. What are you doing there,
Prosecutor Choi?

847
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:04,918
I got a tip about corruption.

848
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:08,797
Corruption?
Stop with the nonsense and go back.

849
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,133
Don't you know that Warden Park
is one of my people?

850
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:15,429
PROSECUTOR: You're on speakerphone.
Watch what you're saying.

851
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:19,975
Right. Who gave you the orders?

852
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:26,857
I think Mayor Choi put pressure
on the upper heads.

853
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:31,778
(scoffs)
I don't know either. I'm sorry.

854
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:34,239
(phone beeps)

855
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:36,867
You have the right to remain silent
and the right to an attorney.

856
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:39,536
PROSECUTOR: You can request habeas corpus,
so keep that in mind.

857
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:41,747
Arrest him.

858
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,832
(tense music)

859
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:49,713
(cuffs clicking)

860
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:54,009
Why would Choi Doha do that
to Warden Park?

861
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,595
I should leave before I hit traffic.

862
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:59,556
Tell us. What's going on right now?

863
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:02,434
(laughing)

864
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,481
I think I'm a genius.

865
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:11,318
Are you the one controlling the situation?

866
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:13,945
(laughing)

867
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:16,573
JIHOON: I'll tell you on our way there.
It'll be fun.

868
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:17,657
(laughs)

869
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,409
-What is it?
-What is it?

870
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:21,453
Mr. Gong.

871

(ominous music)

874
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:40,555
Look at all of them. Don't miss anyone.

875
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:43,350
MIHO: Okay. I'm looking.

876
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:45,685
(clamoring continues)

877
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:48,271
CHANGHO:
The guy that looks flustered or angry...

878
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,858
is Big Mouse.

879
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:53,944

CONTROL ROOM

884
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:32,315
INMATE: I knew he'd get caught.

885
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:35,694
I heard he got caught with all the cash

886
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:37,737
he extorted out of the inmates.

887
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:40,115
INMATE:
That's what we call punitive justice.

888
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,450
Who gave the tip?

889
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:45,245
I'm sure it's someone in here.

890
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:48,081
Warden Park was a jerk,

891
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:51,042
but he was always good to me. Gosh.

892
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:54,629
GUARD: Inmate 5247.
The warden requested a meeting.

893
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:57,090
Is Warden Park out already?

894
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:59,176
The acting warden is here to replace him.

895
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:09,144
I hope the interim warden
has a better personality than Warden Park.

896
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:13,565
A lunatic could leave
for a psycho to come in.

897
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:15,567

898

Are you here to meditate? Open your eyes.

901
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:30,457
Do as the law dictates.

902
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,834
I'm used to prison,

903
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:34,878
so I accept all punishments.

904
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:37,505
Do you think I brought you here

905
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:40,133
just to deal with a small fish like you?

906
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:45,430
WARDEN PARK: You called me here.
Tell me what you want.

907
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:48,558
CHANGHO: You're Big Mouse?

908
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:53,146
WARDEN PARK: All of the strange things
that happened in here.

909
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:56,441
If it wasn't me,
there are no explanations for it.

910
00:53:56,858 --> 00:53:58,693
CHANGHO:
And the guys who died in the mess hall?

911
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:02,697
WARDEN PARK: I gave them cyanide
and told them it was a sedative.

912
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:04,908
Then they died on their own.

913
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:07,494
(tense music)

914
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:10,956

(ominous music)

918
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:28,515
The warden will be here soon.

919
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:32,560
MAYOR CHOI:
Take a seat. Let's have a drink.

920
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:35,063
(chair creaks)

921

Park Changho...

923
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:58,044
What? Park Changho didn't record this.

924
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:01,673
If it wasn't Park Changho, who was it?

925
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:04,175
He said he knows you best
within the prison.

926
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:07,762
He says he's your closest acquaintance.

927
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:09,848
(ominous music)

928
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:13,226
Gan Soochul?

00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:15,312
(music intensifies)

930
00:55:25,196 --> 00:55:26,197
MAYOR CHOI: Have a seat.

931
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:36,833
He's taking over your position as warden.

932
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:39,044
Mayor Choi pushed for him.

933
00:55:41,087 --> 00:55:43,465
(upbeat music)

934
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:50,930
GAN SOOCHUL

935
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:01,399
-That recording...
-GAN SOOCHUL: I sent it.

936
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:04,569
Mayor Choi gave it to me.

937
00:56:10,658 --> 00:56:13,536
Thank you for everything.
I won't forget this.

938
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:16,623
I don't fully trust in you,

939
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:19,376
Mr. Park.

940
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:26,383
Not until...

941
00:56:27,425 --> 00:56:30,220
you bring Big Mouse to me.

REPORTER (on TV): This evening at 7 p.m.,

960
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:10,195
a sedan going from Goksa-dong
to Miyang-dong

961
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:12,655
crossed over the centerline
into oncoming traffic

962
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:15,200
and hit a guardrail on the other side.

963
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:17,202
The police said that the driver seemed

964
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:19,120
to have lost consciousness
while driving...

965
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:21,581
MAYOR CHOI:
He'll help you a lot from now on.

966
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:24,792
You can act freely in here.
And tell me if you need anything.

967
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:28,421
I fought a lonely fight,
but now I feel reassured.

968

ASSOCIATE: Mayor Choi.

969
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:33,593

(ominous music)

971
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:39,224
REPORTER: The driver of the car
who got into the accident

972
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:42,101
is Mayor Choi Doha's wife
and Gucheon Hospital's director,

973
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:44,312
Ms. Hyun Juhee.

974
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:47,857
Ms. Hyun was brought to Gucheon Hospital
immediately after the accident,

975
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:51,402
and luckily,
she was not in critical condition.

976
00:58:51,986 --> 00:58:53,696
According to witness statements,

977
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:58,409
the car was speeding, running the lights,
and crossing through the centerline.

978
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:01,329
The police are suspecting drunk driving.

-Oh, my gosh!

983
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:19,931
My gosh.

984
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:22,934
What was that? You scared me.

985
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:25,436
Don't walk out of here alone
when you go home.

986
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:27,397
I'll walk you to the parking lot.

987
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,358
(scoffs)
Is a prisoner allowed to be so free?

988
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:33,027
I know. It turned out that way.

989
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:35,822
Did you see the news?

990
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:38,032
You mean Dr. Hyun?

991
00:59:38,616 --> 00:59:40,618
That's not a simple car accident.

992
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:42,954
What is it if it's not?

993
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:45,456
Are you saying...

994
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,542
(suspenseful music)

995
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:59,095
I think we hit two birds with one stone
as we planned.

996
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,014
Big Mouse...

997
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:02,515
And Mayor Choi Doha.

998
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:08,438
JIHOON: You still think the accomplice
who killed Professor Seo was me.

999
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:09,856
Then who was it?

1000
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:13,026
Who spoke to Jung Chaebong
after they killed Seo Jaeyoung?

1001
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,986
JIHOON: Find out for yourself.

1002
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:16,863
It really wasn't me.

1003
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,575
(glass shatters)

1004
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:24,203
WARDEN PARK: Why is that off?

1005
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:27,498
Did you say Mayor Choi was with you
when you gave the blood to NFS?

1006
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:29,626
MIHO: Yes. Why do you ask?

1007
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:31,377
CHANGHO: Did the results come out?

1008
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:33,671
I'm at the NFS.
I'm here to check the results.

1009
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:36,674
CHANGHO: The accomplice in killing
Seo Jaeyoung might not be Gong Jihoon.

1010
01:00:38,551 --> 01:00:40,887
If it's not Gong Jihoon, who is it?

1011
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:44,724
If Mayor Choi is the accomplice,
the results will be manipulated.

1012
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:46,643
Just check that.

1013
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:47,894
The blood type has changed.

1014
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:49,062
What do you mean?

1015
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:50,521
MIHO: Look at this.

1016
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:53,191
Nam Kisung's blood type is RH minus B,

1017
01:00:53,274 --> 01:00:56,235
but the results say
his blood type RH plus B.

1018
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:58,363
It was manipulated.

1019
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:00,073
(sighs)

1020
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:02,784
CHANGHO: Okay, Miho.

1021
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:07,372
(suspenseful music)

1022
01:01:07,955 --> 01:01:09,749
Choi Doha, that son of a...

1023
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,126
(phone vibrating)

1024
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:15,004
-Hello?
-It's me, Park Changho.

1025
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:17,298
I'm being interrogated tomorrow.

1026
01:01:17,382 --> 01:01:20,301
CHANGHO: I'm going to give them
important information about Big Mouse.

1027
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:21,969
I can't trust Choi Joongrak.

1028
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:24,555
Can you come? I need a witness.

1029
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:30,103
MIHO: So Big Mouse
has begun attacking Mayor Choi.

1030
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:33,439
Choi Doha will fight back too.

1031
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:36,776
Do you think Big Mouse
will reveal himself?

1032
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:38,403
He won't have a choice.

1033
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:41,447
In order to get Choi Doha, he'll need me.

1034
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:44,158
If he does?

1035
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:45,410
We need to catch him

1036
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:47,453
and get rid of Choi Doha too.

1037
01:01:49,914 --> 01:01:52,375
(suspenseful music continues)

1038
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:56,713
BIG MOUTH

1039
01:01:56,796 --> 01:01:58,798
(closing theme music)

1040
01:02:16,774 --> 01:02:19,569
BIG MOUTH

1041
01:02:19,652 --> 01:02:21,404
CHANGHO: Be aware.

1042
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:24,907
If you don't catch Big Mouse,
you'll lose everything you have at once.

1043
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:28,661
MIHO: Killing Professor Seo wasn't enough?
What is he trying to hide?

1044
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,246
CHANGHO: Nobody can guarantee you'll live.

1045
01:02:30,329 --> 01:02:31,998
-Not even Big Mouse...
-GAN SOOCHUL: Who is it, you jerk?

1046
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:33,458
...can protect you.

1047
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:35,168
Get rid of both of them tonight.

1048
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:37,044
MAYOR CHOI:
Get some guys you trust to start a riot.

1049
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:40,381
We just need to watch and wait.

1050
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:42,508
And get them all at once.

1051
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,177
You're dead!

1052
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,053
-(glass shatters)
-If he doesn't show up...

1053
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:47,680
I'm going to get rid of our plan.
