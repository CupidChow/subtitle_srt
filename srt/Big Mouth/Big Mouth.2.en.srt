29
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,977
in my life is.

30
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,565
In pivotal moments...

31
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:12,859
(pole snaps)

32
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,402

33
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:16,821

00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:02,909
But Miho was always on my side.

42
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,000
Let's get a divorce.

43
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,336

00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,421
(gasps)

45
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,716
Honey, do you know who I am?

(exhales)

47
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,429

Do you remember your accident?

48
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,098
(exhales)

00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,185

50
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:32,313
Oh, right. Prosecutor Cho.

51
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,107
Where's my phone?

52
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,942
How would I know where your phone is?

53
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,402
Your car was totaled.

54
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,988
MIHO'S FATHER: The doctors said
it's a miracle you're alive.

55
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:43,241
Miho, give me your phone.

56
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:49,497
MADAM

57
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,624

BIG MOUTH

64
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:25,616
MIHO'S FATHER: Gosh.

65
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,578
Father-in-law, so where's my car?

66
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:29,871
MIHO'S FATHER: The auto body out front.

67
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:32,165
They must not be open
because they're not picking up.

68
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:34,417
Sure. Can you go with me to the shop?

69
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,169
-MIHO'S FATHER: Sure.
-MIHO: Hey.

70
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,254
Where are you going like that?

71
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,548
I need to get something.

72
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,342
CHANGHO:
I need to meet that prosecutor too.

73
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,219
-I'll be right back.
-(inhales sharply)

74
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,472
OFFICER: Mr. Park Changho?

75
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,350
Who are you?

76
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,019
You're under arrest for drug use.

77
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:57,899
Listen here. He's an attorney.
What do you mean drugs?

78
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:59,901
His blood tested positive for drugs.

79
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:03,404
-What?
-Did you use drugs?

80
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,698
What? I don't use drugs.

81
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,826
OFFICER: You have the right to an attorney
and a chance to defend yourself.

82
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,912
He said he didn't use drugs.
Don't cuff him.

83
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,998
Are you with Dongbu Police?
I was the captain of Criminal Affairs.

84
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,084
MIHO'S FATHER: Give me ten minutes
to talk to my son-in-law.

85
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,336
Gosh. I'm sorry. Come on.

86
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,421
-Hey, let go.
-MIHO: Excuse me.

87
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,006
-CHANGHO: Wait.
-Excuse me!

88
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,091
-CHANGHO: I didn't do it!
-MIHO'S FATHER: Wait.

89
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,759
-Hey. Wait...
-OFFICER: Let's go.

90
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:26,803
CHANGHO: Hey!

91
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,222

92
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,183
(muttering)

93
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,226
I'm sorry.

94
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,436
Hold on. Open the window for a second.

95
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,357
-Miho.
-You need to stay alert.

96
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:43,861
I trust you,
so trust in us and hold out. Okay?

97
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,827
(siren wailing)

98
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,121

(tense music)

103
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,943
Then wield your toy sword all you want.

104
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:28,030
JIHOON: Let's see who gets hurt and how.

105
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,662
Excuse me.

106
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:35,955
Can you call Mayor Choi Doha?

107
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,624
I'll tell you who gave me the drugs
and who used it on me.

108
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,003
(tense music)

109
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:51,053

112
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:57,435
CHANGHO: Mayor.

113
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,650
MAYOR CHOI: I heard the whole story
from the prosecutor-in-charge.

114
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:13,201
I can't even paint my house
because the smell gives me headaches.

115
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:16,245
I've never even seen drugs before,
so how can I be a drug user?

116
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,497
What about the dashcam?

117
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,248
It's gone.

118
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:22,460
CHANGHO: It was in the car,
but the car got scrapped.

119
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,922
Gong Jihoon did this
to get rid of the evidence.

120
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,342
How did he know you had the dashcam?

121
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:33,971
Did you meet Gong Jihoon?

122
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:40,019
I'm sorry. If I get released
after the investigation,

123
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,021
I'll explain the details then.

124
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:44,690
MAYOR CHOI: The court will issue
an arrest warrant soon.

125
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:45,775
CHANGHO: An arrest?

126
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,194
They're going to arrest me
when it's my first offense?

127
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,987
It'll be easy for Gong Jihoon.

128
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,739
Darn it. That punk...

129
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,699
Did you verify on the footage

130
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,078
that Gong Jihoon was the accomplice?

131
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:01,123
No, the name wasn't clearly mentioned,

132
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,875
but they mentioned some paper.

133
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,129
-(car horn honks)
-Just say that you'll withdraw your paper!

134
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:11,175
You can kill me,
but it'll get out eventually.

135
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:17,306
In the end, there's no definitive evidence
that it's Gong Jihoon.

136
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,767
I'll find that paper for you.

137
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,519
Just make sure I get released.

138
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,063
You want my help?

139
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:29,068
It'll be faster to ask Gong Jihoon.

140
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,404
Mayor Choi...

00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:59,307
-(thumping)
-Listen here!

149
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,518
I'm the office manager here. Who are you?

150

We're the Regional Investigation Unit.

151
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:07,815
This is our search warrant.

CHANGHO: Gucheon Penitentiary.

165
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,333
It's the worst prison in Korea
that detains prisoners

a lawyer who is incarcerated
at Gucheon Penitentiary for drug use.

You don't know what it's like in here
even though you're a lawyer?

290
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:04,666
This is the only place in Korea
where lawlessness is allowed.

291

What?

Park Changho, that punk, is Big Mouse,

00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,962
CHAEBONG: Dang.

336
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:30,062
Apparently, Park Changho is Big Mouse,
the guy who emptied Lala Capital.

337
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:32,481
-What?
-What are you talking about?

338
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:33,649
Darn it.

339
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,693
CHAEBONG: What is he saying?

340
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,487
WARDEN PARK: CPR!

341
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,572
(tense music)

342
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,368
Save him. Save him no matter what!

343
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,246
PARAMEDIC: Do it.

344
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,872
-(device beeps)
-(defibrillator crackles)

345
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,167
How can we save him?

346
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:53,835
(Chaebong sighs)

347
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,963
(defibrillator powering up)

348
00:20:58,465 --> 00:20:59,633
PARAMEDIC: Clear.

349
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,301
-(device beeps)
-(defibrillator crackles)

350
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,469
(exhales softly)

351
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,058
He's back.

352
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,105
He's tenacious.

353
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,148
DR. HAN: Good job.

354
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,068
(Chaebong groans)

355
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,280
(Chaebong groans)

356
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,489
GUCHEON PENITENTIARY

357
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:26,034
SOONTAE: He can't even get visitors
from his legal counsel?

358
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,036
OFFICER: The inmate has refused.

359
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,746
(somber music)

360
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,248
We'll change it to a regular visit.

361
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:32,833
Tell him his wife...

362
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,127
The inmate has refused all visitors.

363
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,254
(ominous music)

364
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,553
TRUSTWORTHY LAW, HAPPY GUCHEON

365
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,599
(Soontae sighs)

366
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,185
Do you think something happened to him?

367
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,270
Like what?

368
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,355
There's no reason to refuse visits.

369
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,399
It's weird how they incarcerated him
so quickly.

370
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:58,900
Let's come back tomorrow.

371
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,986
Don't worry, Miho.

372
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:04,114
(phone vibrating)

373
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:06,533
Hello?

374
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:08,035
Is Miho next to you?

375
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:10,078
Can you go somewhere quiet to talk?

376
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:14,207
Oh, right. That?

377
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,500
Just a minute, Miho.

378
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,044
SOONTAE: Yes, go ahead.

379
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:19,046
(car door closes)

380
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,465
Yes, Mr. Ko. Go ahead.

381
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:23,383
MIHO'S FATHER:
Mr. Kim. Did you see the news?

382
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,552
Apparently, Changho is Big Mouse.

383
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:28,513
That's his nickname, but why is that news?

384
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,182
No, not Big Mouth.

385
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:33,101
The notorious criminal, Big Mouse!

386
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,519
What?

387
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,899
(ominous music)

388
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,986
MIHO'S FATHER:
There are reporters waiting outside.

389
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,197
Take Miho somewhere else.

390
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,241
MIHO'S FATHER: She'll get shocked,
so don't let her see the news.

391
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,452
-SOONTAE: Okay.
-Darn it.

392
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,664
(sighs)
What the hell is going on?

393
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,501
(suspenseful music)

394
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:01,630
(exhales)

395
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:10,597
Miho, let's go to my office first...

396
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,890
They're saying...

397
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,393
Changho is Big Mouse.

398
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:16,144
What?

399
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,939
BIG MOUSE REVEALED TO BE
ATTORNEY AT LAW, PARK CHANGHO

400
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:21,525
(chuckles nervously)
This is a mistake.

401
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:23,402
Give me a minute to think.

402
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,495
(suspenseful music)

403
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,880
Are you okay, Miho?

404
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,551
SOONTAE: There are reporters
at your home and the hospital.

405
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:49,928
Mr. Ko said you should stay away
for the time being.

406
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,557
Can they watch TV inside?

407
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:55,892
-SOONTAE: Yes.
-Let's go home.

408
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:00,147
(sighs deeply)

409
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:03,150
REPORTER: The fact that Big Mouse,
known as the king of the underworld,

410
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:06,278
was a lawyer is quite shocking.

411
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,572
Mr. Kim. How was he caught?

412
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:11,908
MR. KIM: Right. As you are aware,
in order to catch Big Mouse,

413
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:14,202
they even created a special unit.

414
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,287
REPORTER: That's right.

415
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:19,040
There was a lot of talk about
whether or not they could catch him.

416
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:22,335
MR. KIM: The police said an anonymous tip
was what helped catch him.

417
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:23,753
-GUARD 1: He's Big Mouse?
-GUARD 2: Yeah.

418
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,756
MR. KIM: We'll have to hear
the official statement to know for sure.

419
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,593
(ominous music)

420
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:31,636
(prisoners clamoring)

421
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,846
GUARD: Quiet.

422
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:34,347
Quiet!

423
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:43,690
(sighs)

424
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:45,525
He was my idol.

425
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:49,446
Gosh. How could a legend
get taken like this?

426
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:51,114
(door opens)

427
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,034
(groans)

428
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,453
(groaning)

429
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:57,537
Your new roommate.

430
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,706
REPORTER: Park Changho
hasn't admitted to his crimes yet...

431
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:00,957
(groans)

432
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,292
ROOM LEADER:
I don't think we can haze him today.

433
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:04,920
Move him to the corner.

434
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:08,173
-PRISONER 1: Yes, sir.
-PRISONER 2: My gosh. How disgusting.

435
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:10,759
-What is this?
-MAN 1 (on TV): It won't be easy.

436
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:14,721
Did you hear anything
from Big Mouse's family?

437
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:19,893
MAN 2: I am currently waiting
in front of Big Mouse's home.

438
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:21,978
(somber music)

439
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:28,652
REPORTER:
Did you know Park Changho was Big Mouse?

440
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:30,570
MIHO: My husband isn't Big Mouse.

441
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:33,657
REPORTER: How will you explain
the money and drugs found in his office?

442
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,784
MIHO (on TV): That's why this is unfair.

443
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,369
My husband is a victim.

444
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:42,165
If the investigation requires it,
I'm willing to reveal private information.

445
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,043
I hope the prosecution reveals

446
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,629
who did such a terrible thing.

447
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:51,841
You're saying Big Mouse is someone else
and Park Changho's being framed.

448
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:55,637
There's something I want to say
to my husband. May I?

449
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:00,725
BIG MOUTH'S WIFE DENIES
ALL ALLEGATIONS AGAINST HUSBAND

450
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:01,935
MIHO: Honey.

451
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,981
(somber music)

452
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:10,610
(camera shutter clicking)

453
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:13,613
(sobs softly)

454
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:17,534
I went to visit you,
but I couldn't get inside.

455
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,954
(sobbing)

456
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:25,625
We're going to fight
until we prove your innocence.

457
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:26,793
So...

458
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:30,630
don't forget that you have family.

459
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,094
(groans)

460
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:38,263
MIHO: And...

461
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:39,806
(exhales)

462
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:44,561
...if you refuse to see me again,
I won't let it go.

463
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:46,855
Okay, Park Changho?

464
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,777
(somber music)

465
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,449
(sobbing softly)

466
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,673
(sobbing)

467
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:16,051
(reporters clamoring)

468
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:19,054
-Can you give us another comment?
-Is there anything else?

469
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:24,934
(siren wails)

470
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:51,628
GUARD: Okay, let's go.

471
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,718
(ominous music)

472
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,973
There were 100,000 of 50,000-won bills,

473
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,601
enough methamphetamine
for 150,000 people to use at once...

474
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,353
(wall rumbles)

475
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:11,272
...six illegal gambling houses
being run in Southeast Asia,

476
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,691
and 12 burner phones...

477
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,609
(camera shutter clicking)

478
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:16,778
...and a Glock 19 handgun.

479
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,697
PROSECUTOR:
We found all of this in your office.

480
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:22,033
If I knew all these things
were inside an office

481
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:25,620
where the deposit was 30 million won,
I would've paid off my back-rent.

482
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:27,580
I'm late three months.

483
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:31,501
Didn't you gamble in Macau six months ago?

484
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:34,379
You're not very good at it.
You lost ten billion won.

485
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,507
PROSECUTOR: Don't bother lying.

486
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,592
The casino verified it for us.

487
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:42,637
My credit card loan limit
is 20 million won.

488
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,057
To lose ten billion won...

489
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:50,019
Gosh, I would need 500 credit cards.

490
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:52,105
(suspenseful music)

491
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,774
PROSECUTOR: Do you feel this is unfair?

492
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,152
Yes.

493
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:02,657
Do you have the 100-billion-won investment
for Lala Capital?

494
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:04,743
(sighs)

495
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:08,079
I don't even know what that is.
Why are you asking?

496
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:12,417
Answer with a yes or a no.

497
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:16,629
Do you have the 100-billion-won investment
for Lala Capital?

498
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:18,339
No.

499
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,842
(music intensifies)

500
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:21,926
(music stops)

501
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,428
Are you Big Mouse?

502
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:26,264
(suspenseful music)

503
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:37,901
-(thumps)
-Answer me.

504
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:40,278
Are you Big Mouse?

505
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:42,238
You know a few of these
are always wrong, right?

506
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:43,823
You can't even use this as evidence.

507
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:45,950
Why are you doing this to me?

508
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,287
I'm not Big Mouse!

509
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,371
PROSECUTOR: Don't get so agitated.

510
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,123
If the graph jumps, it'll only hurt you.

511
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:54,709
(tense music)

512
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:55,794
(exhales sharply)

513
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,296
(sighs)

514
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,432
(sighs deeply)

515
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:15,438
(mice screeching)

516
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,952
EMERGENCY TRANSPORT

517
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:34,791
(suspenseful music)

518
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:43,883
GUNS AND DRUGS FOUND IN LAWYER'S OFFICE

519
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:51,349
CHANGHO: Just wait.

520
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:56,020
You'll see my face everywhere on TV soon.

521
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:04,445
Never in my wildest dreams...

522
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:08,116
did I expect to become famous like this.

523
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:19,294
BIG MOUSE REVEALED TO BE A LAWYER
SHOCKING MANY PEOPLE

524
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,379
CONTROL ROOM

525
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,435
(door locks)

526
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:37,353
You're not Big Mouse. Are you?

527
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:39,981
Stop putting on a show. It makes me sick.

528
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,733
-A show?
-One hundred billion won.

529
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:44,569
You took the money
and framed me to cover it up.

530
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:46,738
Why would we take our own money?

531
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:47,864
-(spits)
-CHAEBONG: Darn it.

532
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:49,324
You losers.

533
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:51,117
GUARDS: Hold on!

534
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,328
-Stop them!
-Do you think I was born yesterday?

535
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:54,537
-DOOGEUN: You punk!
-CHAEBONG: Let go!

536
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:57,665
Hey! You messed with the wrong person!

537
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:00,877
-Just wait and see, you punks!
-GUARD: Let go!

538
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,086
-CHANGHO: Let go of me!
-(Chaebong mutters)

539
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:03,755
Hey.

540
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:05,965
Listen.

541
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:08,343
He's saying that we're the ones
who took the money. Right?

542
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:11,304
See? I told you he wasn't Big Mouse!

543
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:12,764
(inhales sharply)

544
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:15,266
I think he really is.

545
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:20,313
He only said a few words, but both of you
are convinced he's not Big Mouse.

546
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:23,316
Wouldn't it be scary if he really was?

547
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:27,946
-Gosh.
-This is getting complicated.

548
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,783
(suspenseful music)

549
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,471
It's an honor.

550
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:55,473
What is?

551
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:59,185
I'm... a huge fan of yours.

552
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:03,022
I'm so glad I'm in here.
I can't believe I got to meet Big Mouse.

553
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:05,316
I'm not Big Mouse.

554
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,611
Of course, you aren't.
Your trial hasn't even started.

555
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,905
(exhales)

556
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,993
(imitates mouse screeching)

557
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,244
Do you know Tom and Jerry?

558
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:19,747
My nickname is Jerry.
I'm a huge fan of Big Mouse,

559
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,000
so I went with a different mouse.

560
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,751
(laughs)

561
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,837
(lively music)

562
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:30,550
I will serve you with complete devotion.

563
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,220
I'm really not him.

564
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:37,724
Hey. Tell me your birthday.

565
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:39,642
What?

566
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:41,769
He's our room leader.

567
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,522
He's good at reading fortunes,
physiognomy, and Eastern philosophy.

568
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:46,357
-Tell him.
-ROOM LEADER: Tell me.

569
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,860
I'll tell you your fortune for free.

570
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,029
Year of the Rat, Year of the Ox...

571
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:53,489
It's obvious.
I'll live long and be very unlucky.

572
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:56,993
Live long and unlucky? Me too!

573
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:00,580
CHANGHO: Really?

574
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:02,665
(ominous music)

575
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,712
DOOGEUN: Don't you know how determined
the prosecution is?

576
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:10,256
If we don't shut Changho up,
we can't avoid a guilty sentence.

577
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:12,175
We'll all be done for.

578
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:17,180
Then kill Big Mouse
and reimburse the 100 billion won.

579
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:18,264
CHAEBONG: My gosh.

580
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:21,017
You only care about the money
and not if we live or die?

581
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,685
DR. HAN: Listen.

582
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:25,688
You're not caring about us at all.

583
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:30,401
I bet my life that he's not Big Mouse.

584
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:34,989
(bell dinging)

585
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:39,368
(inhales deeply)
That's why...

586
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:45,208
I said I'd look into it
and clear things up.

587
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:47,293
(ominous music)

588
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,840
Don't lay a hand on him
until I give you the sign.

589
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,762
I gave you a warning.

590
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:00,556
(chuckles)

591
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,683
(rattling)

592
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:05,436
(blows)

593
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,274
(munching)

594
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,276
WARDEN PARK:
What an interesting situation.

595
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,612
One side needs to kill him to live,

596
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:17,115
but the other side can't kill him
because of money.

597
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:21,410
(munching)

598
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:27,333
(suspenseful music)

599
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,015
I'm sorry for being late.

600
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:44,892
(door closes)

601
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,227
It's only five minutes.

602
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,311
I'm sorry.

603
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:50,356
I know prosecutors are busy
working for the country.

604
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:53,651
JIHOON: Have a seat.

605
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:04,120
(Jihoon sighs)

606
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:06,956
(muttering)

607
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,921
Are you sure Park Changho is Big Mouse?

608
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,340
The evidence is indisputable but...

609
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:19,969
-But?
-(tea dripping)

610
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:22,346
-(gasps)
-(Jihoon snickers)

611
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:25,057
(laughter)

612
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:26,350
It's Big Mouse.

613
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,144
The most genius conman in history.

614
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:30,438
(suspenseful music)

615
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,064
Oh, right.

616
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,276
JIHOON: You're being careful
because of who your opponent is.

617
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,195
Okay.

618
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,404
(laughs)

619
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:41,657
So... who is it?

620
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,368
Your informant.

621
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:47,705
It was anonymous.

622
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:50,583
What?

623
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:55,922
The great Big Mouse was caught
by an anonymous tip?

624
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:59,926
Don't worry.
I will reveal who Big Mouse is.

625
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,844
JIHOON:
Revealing his identity won't be enough.

626
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,056
You need to find the money.

627
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:08,059
It's no less than 100 billion won.

628
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:11,896
I won't miss a single bill
and return all 100 billion won to you.

629
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,025
Mr. Choi.

630
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:22,990
You have a bright future.
I will prepare a red carpet for you.

631
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,826
-(chuckles)
-JIHOON: Drink up.

632
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,458
(exhales heavily)

633
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,253
Darn it.

634
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,839
They only gave me the royal hot pot.

635
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:39,966
(exclaims)

636
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:42,802
I guess they didn't realize
you were coming.

637
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,387
Hey!

638
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,846
(clanking)

639
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:47,598
Outside!

640
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:50,685
GUKUI

641
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:52,645
(Jihoon sighs)

642
00:37:58,484 --> 00:37:59,902
Do you want a ride home?

643
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:02,238
It's okay. Please go ahead.

644
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:10,955
I'll see you soon.

645
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:17,003
Good night.

646
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:27,930
(suspenseful music)

647
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:37,398
(grunts)

648
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:43,821
PROSECUTOR: It's the list of drug dealers.

649
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:49,952
All of Big Mouse's customers were VIPs.

650
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,412
Did you make copies?

651
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:52,747
You told me not to.

652
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:56,000
Why are you taking this so far?

653
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:58,461
You know how they look down on us.

654
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:02,256
Like we're lowly people who have nothing
and worked hard to get to where we are.

655
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:07,345
They made me mayor,

656
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,930
but they stomp on my head
and brag about it.

657
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,015
Fine.

658
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,559
I can deal with that.

659
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:18,314
But I worked hard to get to this point,

660
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,609
it'd be unfair to lose my life to them.

661
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:25,029
The one holding the sword has changed
thanks to Big Mouse.

662
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:26,572
When will you unsheathe it?

663
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:28,949
If we kill them, they become corpses.

664
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:32,703
If we let them live,
they'll be under our knees.

665
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:35,414
Let's hope
we'll never have to unsheathe it.

666
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:37,625
(inhales deeply)

667
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:40,419
I can't believe
that Park Changho is Big Mouse.

668
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:43,631
Our investigation will reveal
whether he is a peacock or a sparrow.

669
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,552
Don't betray me.

670
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:54,517
You're the only one
who will lay out my red carpet.

671
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:59,021
(ominous music)

672
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,077
Where's the employee from the restaurant?

673
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,579
She left for Southeast Asia
a few days ago,

674
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:16,956
but now she's off the grid.

675
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:20,918
Then Changho's right.
She's the one who drugged his coffee.

676
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:22,753
SOONTAE:
His car got totaled in the accident,

677
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,004
and we don't have the dashcam.

678
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:27,007
This is so complicated
that I don't know where to start...

679
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,175
There's nothing to it.

680
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:33,347
MIHO: We have to find the paper,
the reason why they killed Professor Seo.

681
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:34,765
SOONTAE: Right.

682
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:36,600
Oh, right.

683
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:39,145
SOONTAE: But Miho,

684
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:41,063
we'll do the investigating...

685
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:43,983
(mutters)

686
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:47,319
Miho, can you stay out of it?

687
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,780
MIHO'S FATHER: Those guys kill people.

688
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,198
What if you get put into danger...

689
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,284
If you're scared, you two can back down.

690
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:54,702
I'll do it alone if I have to.

691
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,413
Miho.

692
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:58,873
Wait, Miho.

693
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,792
-(door closes)
-(Miho's father exclaims)

694
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,335
That girl.

695
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:05,754
See? I told you it wouldn't work.

696
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,631
This is really dangerous.

697
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:14,054
ESTABLISHING LAW AND ORDER

698
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,723
I'm telling you he's Big Mouse!

699
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,850
-No way.
-No way.

700
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:19,560
-What is it?
-Hear me out.

701
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:22,313
I heard from the guys in that gang

702
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,690
that Big Mouse works in law.

703
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:26,609
-Right.
-And that guy's a lawyer.

704
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:27,985
-Right.
-Yeah.

705
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,528
Then it has to be him!

706
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:32,364
-He doesn't look like it!
-No way!

707
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:34,992
-I don't see it.
-He's gotta be Big Mouse!

708
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,203
He's a fake.

709
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:43,292
I saw Big Mouse with my own two eyes.

710
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:45,377
(ominous music)

711
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:49,757
PRISONER 1: He's about 180 cm tall.

712
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:53,219
He has a huge rat on his back.

713
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:57,056
He is incredibly charismatic.

714
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,684
All of those are baseless rumors.

715
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,895
The real Big Mouse...

716
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:04,271
Don't be surprised.

717
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,108
It's a woman.

718
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:10,194
(suspenseful music)

719
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:14,198
PRISONER 2: She's really sexy,

720
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:16,575
but totally brutal.

721
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:20,037
That's why nobody can catch her.

722
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:23,499
-(chain clanging)
-(groaning)

723
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:30,047
The Yakuza, Triads, and the Russian Mafia
are all blood brothers with him.

724
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:32,883
If you get on his bad side,
you'll die without anyone knowing.

725
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,635
This is driving me crazy.

726
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:37,972
Why did someone like him
come in here and cause such a mess?

727
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:39,890
-(bangs on table)
-I'm losing my appetite!

728
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:42,059
PRISONERS: I'm sorry, sir!

729
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:45,479
(ominous music)

730
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:48,315
(indistinct chattering)

731
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,242
(ominous music)

732
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:10,629
CHUNSIK: Hey.

733
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:14,341
Are you that famous mouse?

734
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:17,261
(munching)

735
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:22,474
(clatters)

736
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,184
(prisoners murmuring)

737
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:25,894
Darn it.

738
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:27,980
Did they send you?

739
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:31,066
-How dare you speak to me like that?
-Goodness, boss!

740
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:33,819
Damn it, seriously!

741
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:37,823
What's your problem with me?

742
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:40,659
Why you...

743
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,620
Boss!

744
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:46,332
If you are Big Mouse, so you are.

745
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:50,085
But don't you act up on me. You wanna die?

746
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:51,253
(Chunsik grunts)

747
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:53,505
(raspy breathing)

748
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:55,591
(whistle blows)

749
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:57,134
GUARDS: Freeze.

750
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:00,846
-GUARD 1: Freeze.
-GUARD 2: Freeze.

751
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:02,181
GUARDS: Freeze.

752
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:04,475
-GUARD 3: Freeze.
-GUARD 4: Don't move.

753
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:09,730
-(breathing heavily)
-(indistinct chattering)

754
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,231
GUARD 3: Look to the front.

755
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,359
GUARD 2: Eat your food.

756
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:14,443
(exhales sharply)

757
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:16,528
(somber music)

758
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:18,739
(munching)

759
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,993
(suspenseful music)

760
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:24,119
(radio clanks)

761
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:25,829
(beeps)

762
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:29,083
Send 5247 to the special ward.

763
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:32,586
(music intensifies)

764
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:35,255
(music stops)

765
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,220
Eat up.

766
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,305
I made this just for you.

767
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:55,859
(munching)

768
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:58,320
(sighs)

769
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:16,255
(inhales sharply)

770
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:20,551
What Park clan are you?

771
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:23,679
Yangsan Park Clan.

772
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:26,056
Yangsan Park Clan? What branch?

773
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,850
The Jeokseonggun Branch.

774
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:31,478
WARDEN PARK:
Then you must be the 28th generation.

775
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,897
I'm the 27th generation
of Jeokseonggun Branch.

776
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,441
Our names have "gab" in it.

777
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:37,359
PARK YOONGAB

778
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:38,819
(chuckles)

779
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,320
(mutters, clears throat)

780
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:41,822
Then you're like my uncle.

781
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:44,491
Gosh. I can't believe it.

782
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:48,954
I know. It's a rare clan,
so it's hard to meet people in it.

783
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:53,917
I can't call you uncle,

784
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,502
so can I call you by your name?

785
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,546
If you want.

786
00:45:57,629 --> 00:46:02,301
I guess there's always
a way out for people.

787
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:04,470
I didn't know what to do.

788
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:08,599
Are you Big Mouse?

789
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:11,560
(spits, coughs)

790
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:15,522
It's just between us.

791
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,524
I won't tell anyone.

792
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:21,737
Are you...

793
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:24,656
really Big Mouse?

794
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:30,829
No.

795
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:32,206
You're not?

796
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:36,293
I swear on my wife,

797
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:38,629
parents, ancestors, and everyone else.

798
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:40,506
I'm really not Big Mouse.

799
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:42,674
(ominous music)

800
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:44,009
Yoongab.

801
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:46,887
(suspenseful music)

802
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:50,057
How dare you call me by my name.
Want to die?

803
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:52,810
Hey, send him to solitary for five days.

804
00:46:56,313 --> 00:47:00,025
You said you were the 27th generation
of Yangsan Park Clan Jeokseonggun Branch!

805
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:03,737
Wait, Yoongab! Uncle!

806
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:05,531
CHANGHO: What...

807
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:08,242
"Uncle?" How disgusting.

808
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:10,410
Who cares about family lineage these days?

809
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:16,834
(sighs)

810
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:21,046
(door closes, locks)

811
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:22,464
(Changho exhales)

812
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:25,008
(sighs)

813
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:35,060
(breathing heavily)

814
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:41,733
(somber music)

815
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:47,489
(sobbing softly)

816
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:51,159
(exhales shakily)

817
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:54,121
(breathes deeply)

818
00:47:57,082 --> 00:47:58,125
(grunts)

819
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:08,552
(exhales)

820
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:10,929
(water dripping)

821
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:12,347
Miho.

822
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:16,602
I miss you.

823
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:17,769
(water drips)

824
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,066

827
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:36,163
(sighs)

828
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:38,916
MIHO'S FATHER: What are you doing?

829
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:40,334
-Put a bucket down.
-CHANGHO: Okay.

830
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:43,754
MIHO'S FATHER: Gosh, those guys upstairs.
I told them to fix the leak.

831
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:45,631
They never listen.

832
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:49,426
I know. It's really bad today.
Did a pipe burst?

833
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:50,969
They're dead meat!

834
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:53,180
MIHO'S FATHER: Hey, Miho. Let it go!

835
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:55,474
-(door opens)
-They don't look like the type to listen.

836
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:58,393
They looked like a bunch of thugs.

837
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:00,437
(breathes shakily)

838
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,730
Miho.

839
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:03,857
CHANGHO: Miho!

(Miho grunting)

852
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:28,799
I'm from downstairs. How many times
must I tell you there's a leak?

853
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:30,217
This lady's at it again.

854
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,760
We didn't break the pipe.

855
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:35,263
If you caused the damage,
you should reimburse us for it!

856
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:36,682
Give us money for repairs!

857
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:38,517
This is my dad's house.

858
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,310
Go get it from my old man.

859
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:41,728
-MAN 1: So, leave.
-(groans)

860
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:45,732
I'm not leaving
until I get the money for repairs!

861
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:48,485
-MAN 1: How dare you come in...
-Oh, hey!

862
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:50,779
We...

863
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:52,614
Haven't we met before?

864
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:54,074
On the roof.

865
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:56,076
You were screaming.

866
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:59,830

MAN 2: Right?

868
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:05,127
Excuse me. Her husband is right here.
What are you doing?

869
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:06,461
Are you her husband?

870
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:08,380
No way. You're too good for him.

871
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:12,467
My husband's a lawyer.
Do you want to go to prison?

872
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:13,552
A lawyer?

873
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:17,139
If a lawyer lives here,
doesn't that mean he's incorrubably pure?

874
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:19,057
(laughter)

875
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:22,060
-These fools...
-Hey, calm down.

876
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:23,270
MIHO: Hey.

877
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:26,356
It's not "incorrubably."
It's "incorruptibly." Incorruptibly pure.

878
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,067
-MIHO: How ignorant.
-MAN 1: "Ignorant?"

879
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:31,278
How dare you say that? Get out.

880
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:32,946
-MIHO: Hey.
-MAN 1: Leave.

881
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,531
-Get out.
-MIHO: Hey.

882
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:35,866
Don't touch me!

883
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:37,284
-Can you leave?
-MIHO: Let go!

884
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:39,036
-MIHO'S FATHER: Miho.
-Are you serious?

885
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:42,205
What?

886
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:44,458
-(grumbles)
-(Miho squeals)

887
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:47,586
(man 1 exclaiming)

888
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:49,337
Hey! Nice shot!

889
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:51,006
(indistinct screaming)

890
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:52,883
-Hey!
-Hey, you!

891
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:55,218
-Damn you!
-What are you doing?

892
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:57,137
-You're dead!
-Come here!

893
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,848
-Get over here! Hey!
-(shrieks)

894
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:04,686
-Sir. Hold on!
-Seriously.

895
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,313
-Let go!
-Let go of me!

896
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:08,857

-(bones crackle)
-(groans)

898
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:11,693
Let go of this hand!

(screaming in pain)

900
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:17,199
(indistinct shouts)

901
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:18,825
MIHO'S FATHER: Let go at once!

902
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,535
(groaning)

903
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:22,871
(indistinct screams)

904
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:26,958

MAN: Wait!

00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:49,898
(laughter)

912
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:51,566
MIHO'S FATHER: Cheers!

913
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:54,569
(Miho's father grumbles)

914
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:57,280
She's my daughter,
but isn't she incredible?

915
00:51:57,364 --> 00:52:00,033
She got all the money
for the repairs from them.

916
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:01,910
She's our family's troubleshooter.

917
00:52:01,993 --> 00:52:03,954
I give you my respect.

918
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:07,249
(laughs)
You look hilarious. Look in the mirror.

919
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:08,708
You think you look better?

920
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:10,168
You look so funny too, Dad.

921
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:12,462
We need to take a photo of this.

922
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:14,714
-MIHO'S FATHER: Gather around.
-Why would we take a photo like this?

923
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,675
It's not a good idea, sir.

924
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:19,469
Okay. One, two, three.

925
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:21,304

926

(sobs)

929
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:36,862
Don't worry and hold on
a bit longer, Changho.

930
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,865
I'll take care of everything.

-JUHEE: Ms. Ko Miho?
-MIHO: Yes?

938
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:15,192
The hospital you previously worked
was a good place,

939
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:17,235
so why did you apply to our hospital?

940
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:19,738
May I be honest?

941
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:23,617
Of course. It's an interview.

942
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:30,040
I heard your cafeteria had good food.

(suspenseful music)

948
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:48,475
This all started with that murder.

949
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:50,769
Miho...

950
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:54,731
wants to find out what
Seo Jaeyoung's paper was about.

951
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:56,316
Can you stop her?

952
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:00,237
You know how stubborn she is.

953
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,407
Be honest.

954
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:07,994
What's it like outside?

955
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:09,829
The people who killed Professor Seo

956
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:12,082
will be released soon.

957
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:16,002
SOONTAE: The prosecution decided
that you're Big Mouse.

958
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:17,295
You'll be indicted soon.

959
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:22,634
(scoffs)

960
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:27,180
(sighs)
What about Mayor Choi?

961
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:29,182
I can't reach him.

962
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:34,521
He believes you're Big Mouse
and wants to cut ties, I guess.

(sighing)

965
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:49,536
Let me ask you a favor.

966
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:54,207
Fill out divorce papers
on my behalf and submit them.

967
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:56,251
Are you going to divorce Miho?

968
00:54:56,751 --> 00:54:58,628
If I get found guilty, I'll get life.

969
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:00,213
If I'm unlucky, the death penalty.

970
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:03,383
Loan sharks will come at me for money,

971
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:09,014
and I don't know what the guys
who did this to me will do to Miho.

972
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:10,140
Changho.

973
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:13,226
Even still,

974
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:15,395
Miho's doing everything she can
to save you.

975
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:17,230
Those who can live should live.

976
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:22,569
(sighs)

977
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:24,738
(sighs)

978
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:29,326
This is the only thing I can do for her.

979
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,204
Do this for me, Soontae.

980
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:35,874
Please.

981
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:41,087

00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:21,419
Why are you here?

990
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,213
Didn't you get my text to break up?

991
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:27,884
Are you crazy?
Are you blinded from failing the exam?

992
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:31,096
It's my second time.
And there's no guarantee I'll ever pass.

993
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:34,516
(dramatic music)

994
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,818
MIHO:
Look how much I have in my bank account.

995
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:50,156
Go to law school. I'll take care of you.

996
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:54,369
(exhales)

997
00:56:57,288 --> 00:56:59,874
I don't want to spend the money
my girlfriend worked hard to make.

998
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:03,545
If you don't want your girlfriend's money,
let's get married.

999
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:05,630
What?

1000
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:06,840
Let's get married.

1001
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:12,929
Goodbye.

1002
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:15,014
(dramatic music)

1003
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:17,267
Let's get married, Park Changho!

1004
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:20,228
MIHO: I want to get married. Marry me.

1005
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:22,730
Marry me!

1006
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:27,902
You won't meet a better woman than me!
I'll take care of you.

1007
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:30,738
-CHANGHO: Come in.
-(Miho exclaims)

1008
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:34,117
How nice!

1009
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,535
ATTORNEY AT LAW, PARK CHANGHO

1010
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:40,748
Life insurance?

1011
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:43,585
(gasps)
It's a lot of money.

1012
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:45,879
I opened my law firm,
so I should get insured.

1013
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:47,422
(gasps)
Oh, my.

1014
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:50,341
You've all grown up.
You even got insurance.

1015
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:51,759
(chuckles)

1016
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:53,761
MIHO: What?

1017
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:55,972
I'm the recipient of your insurance?

1018
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:58,141
(breathes deeply)

1019
00:57:58,850 --> 00:57:59,934
Let's get married.

(dramatic music)

1021
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:06,441
Are you proposing to me with insurance
I don't know when I'll ever get?

1022
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:08,651
Quit the hospital right now.

1023
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:11,821
I will let you live the good life.

1024
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:13,198
(chuckles)

1025
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:15,116

(exhales)

1028
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:29,130
CHANGHO: I let Miho go,

1029
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:32,967
and now there's only one thing
I can do by myself.

1030
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,930
I'll reveal all those jerks' crimes
in my suicide note

1031
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:39,349
and reveal my innocence through death.

1032
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:44,020

MIHO, MEETING YOU WAS MY GREATEST FORTUNE.
I'M SORRY AND GRATEFUL.

01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:21,075
ESTABLISHING LAW AND ORDER

1043
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:32,503
ROOM LEADER:
You better not dream of killing yourself.

1044
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:39,469
If you try to commit suicide and fail,

1045
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:42,805
you'll suffer with a disability
for the rest of your life.

1046
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:47,810
Your physiognomy says
you'll live a ridiculously long life.

1047
01:00:49,687 --> 01:00:51,606
(sobbing)
I can't even die if I want to?

1048
01:00:51,689 --> 01:00:54,692
What kind of terrible life is that?

1049
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:57,487
ROOM LEADER: There are a lot of people
with terrible lives.

1050
01:00:58,154 --> 01:00:59,489
What can you do?

1051
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:02,909
It's not like you were born
because you wanted to be.

1052
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:07,789
You must live as you were meant to live.

CHANGHO:
This place is filled with murderers.

1061
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,834
I don't need to try to kill myself.

JERRY: His name is Yang Chunsik.
He's the boss of the Chain Gang.

1065
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:13,855
Remember the Dongbang Room Salon Case?
Where gangsters fought and six died?

1066
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:17,817
The Chain Gang used axes
and split open people's skulls,

1067
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,944
and then, blech...

1068
01:02:20,027 --> 01:02:22,697
JERRY: In any case,
the scene of the crime was terrible.

1069
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:26,117
Apparently, Yang Chunsik
was the one who instigated it.

1070
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:28,119
ROOM LEADER:
It was all over the newspapers.

What? Do you have something to say to me?

What? This isn't enough?

1081
01:03:05,698 --> 01:03:08,326
Kill me!

Want an axe? Hey, bring him an axe.

1085
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:17,710
Are you a lumberjack?
You can't kill without an axe?

1086
01:03:18,419 --> 01:03:20,880
I told you to kill me, bastard!

1087
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:23,174
I ought to tear you to pieces.

He beat up Chairman Yang.

1100

JERRY:
The red name tag is a death row inmate.

1107
01:04:21,315 --> 01:04:24,068
He's a serial murderer
who killed nine married women.

1108
01:04:24,151 --> 01:04:25,820
He was diagnosed as a psychopath.

1109
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:29,824
A while back, he got pissed
and bit off the ear of his roommate.

1110
01:04:29,907 --> 01:04:32,493
He chewed on it like gum and swallowed it.

That psychopath...

1155
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:45,478
got slapped by Big Mouse

1156
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:47,605

That's why you have to be careful.

you can die just by making eye contact.
