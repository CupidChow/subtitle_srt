Yes. I was at a cancer center

with a follow-up.

By myself?

We should help each other

Luckily, it wasn't too late...

132
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,365
Did you give him epinephrine
without a doctor's order?

133
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,243
(chuckles)

134
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:34,162
I have an ACLS license.

135
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,747
I can administer epinephrine
based on my assessment...

136

NURSE: Yes, ma'am.

140
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,968
And train your new hires.

141
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,555
So problems like this don't occur again.

142
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,730
MIHO: What do we have to apologize for?

If I hadn't done what I did,
this patient would've died.

It was a code blue but no one came.

145
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,819
This patient's family had...

146
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,071
requested a do-not-resuscitate order.

147

-What?
-HEAD NURSE: It's not just him.

148
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,951
Everyone on the seventh floor is
with a DNR order,

149
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,454
so don't do anything
if they have a cardiac arrest.

150
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:18,039
I understand if they were hopeless...

Yes?

153
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,670
The mood here hasn't been good lately.

154
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,672
Just do what you're told.

(heart monitor beeping)

156

only for patients on the seventh floor

with the late Professor Seo's thesis?

168
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,436
Yes. Absolutely.

169
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:26,107
Once we find that paper,
we'll know why Changho...

170
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,901
Soontae. Are you listening to me?

171
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,570
What?

172
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,738
Why are you so distracted?

173
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,365
You didn't hear a word I said.

174
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,507
What is this?

175
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,055
PETITION FOR UNCONTESTED DIVORCE

176
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:01,559
MIHO'S FATHER: It says right there.
"Petition for uncontested divorce."

177
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,352
MIHO: I can read.

178
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:06,606
Why are you giving this to me?

179
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:09,942
This is what Changho wants.

180
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,028
(dramatic music)

181
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:15,865
I tried to stop him too,
but there's no way we'll win the trial.

182
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,285
It was obvious
life would get even harder for you.

183
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,329
(Miho's father sighs deeply)

184
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:24,498
He would do absolutely anything
for his wife.

185
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:25,833
He must feel hopeless.

186
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,629
Gosh, that poor kid.
(sighs)

187
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:33,549
Was that why
he refused my visit last time?

188
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,343
Miho.

189
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,054
Changho may be right.

190
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,390
SOONTAE: You'll be judged endlessly
for being Big Mouse's wife.

191
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,225
At least one of you should live.

192
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,855
MIHO:
Go right now and request a lawyer's visit.

193
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:49,523
I'll kill him in person.

194
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:52,193
-Miho.
-MIHO: I won't divorce him.

195
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:55,112
I supported him so much
for him to become a lawyer.

196
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:58,074
(sniffles)
Get up. Now.

197
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,158
Changho...

198
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,118
is in solitary confinement,

199
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,120
so he can't have visitors
for the time being.

200
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,289
(exhales sharply)

201
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,505
(sighs)

202
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,052
(sighs deeply)

203
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,267
WARDEN PARK YOONGAB

204
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,108
(ominous music)

205
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,695
(keypad clacking)

206
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:36,904
(beeps)

207
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,784
(suspenseful music)

208
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,293
WARDEN PARK: They're all small fry.

209
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,756
I need at least a large yellowtail
to have sashimi.

210
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:57,633
(knocks on door)

211
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:06,892
-Come in.
-(door opens)

212
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,187
(door closes)

213
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:14,358
You called?

214
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,527
Release Park Changho from solitary

215
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,070
and call an assembly for Ward Two.

216
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,197
Ward Two had one last week...

217
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:25,453
It doesn't harm the ocean
to throw the net an extra time.

218
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,080
Call them, punk.

219
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,248
Yes, sir.

220
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,793
(ominous music)

221
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,551
If Park Changho really is Big Mouse,

222
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,429
he isn't a yellowtail but a whale.

223
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,056
A blue whale.

224
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,023
(Jerry sighs)
Has the warden gone senile?

225
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,691
We already had an assembly this month.

226
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,985
Hey, isn't it obvious?

227
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:00,780
He has a new client.

228
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:05,284
(inmates murmuring)

229
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:06,535
(door opens)

230
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:09,789

231
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,005

232
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,590
(murmuring stops)

233
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:31,018
(inmate coughing)

234
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:38,150
Where you're standing right now
is not a penitentiary.

235
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:42,029
WARDEN PARK: Gangsters. Con artists.
Murderers. Thieves.

236
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:45,199
This is a recycling center that turns
all sorts of garbage from society

237
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,201
into decent human beings.

238
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:51,080
The Messiah came to save humanity,

239
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:54,291
and I've come here to save you.

240
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:58,420
Heaven follows God's laws.
Here, we follow my laws.

241
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,465
I am your god.

242
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,801
(ominous music)

243
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,135
Understood?

244
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,721
INMATES: Yes, sir.

245
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,014
Louder!

246
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:10,975
INMATES (shouts): Yes, sir!

247
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:14,270
What crap is this?

248
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,981
GUARD: Step forward if I call your number.

249
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:20,192
No. 3574, No. 1440, No. 3870,

No. 1346, No. 6051, No. 2279,

255
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,832
-GUARD: No. 8091, No. 2297...
-What is this about?

256
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:37,251
They're sorting us by grade.
Those called now are Grade A.

257
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,506
Grade A? What are we, beef?

258
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,799
What's the standard?

259
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,135
They either do whatever the warden says
like them,

260
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,053
or pay him every month.

261
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:51,265
CHANGHO: The warden takes bribes too?

262
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,808
(sighs)

263
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,810
CHANGHO: What about the room leader?

264
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,228
He's forever Grade A.

265
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,397
He reads the warden's fortune.

266
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,524
His family problems, stocks, his kids...

267
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,984
JERRY: He always calls on him.

268
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,153
There are guys who aren't here right now.

269
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,155
They're VIPs who are beyond grades.

270
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,953
(ominous music)

271
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,290
GUARD: Each to your post.

272
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:18,208
Move.

273
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,169
INMATE: I won't go!

274
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:26,675
Warden Park. You can't do this
after taking all my money.

275
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,761
INMATE: I'll expose you once I get out!

276
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:29,803
Get rid of him.

277
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:33,891
(inmates clamoring)

278
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:36,060

00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,775
You skipped this month, punk.

Treatment of Correctional Institution
Inmates Act, Article Four.

Human rights of inmates
shall be respected to the utmost.

Article Five.
Inmates shall not be discriminated

287
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,598
on the grounds of age, gender, religion...

288

Abide by the law.

294
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,671
Don't discriminate against prisoners.

295
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:48,215
As per the same law that you mentioned,
Article 57,

296
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:49,800
Inmates shall be confined

297
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:52,803
in a suitable correctional facility
based on the classification result

298
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:56,306
and be treated properly according
to the plan for individual treatment.

299
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,434
And who is in charge of their treatment?

300
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,810
I am.

301
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,647
-The international human rights...
-Screw human rights!

302
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:06,734
I'm the law and justice here!

303
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:10,779
How dare a backstabbing con artist talk
about the law?

304
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,073
Hey! Drag him out of here now!

305
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,199
Take him out.

306
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,368

CHANGHO:
French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu said

311
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,644
modern society ranks people
based on interests.

312
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,898
Here, the warden ranks people
as he pleases.

313
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,107
Cigarettes!

314

(cheering)

315
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:51,320
CHANGHO:
Grade A punks receive various benefits

316
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,156
and don't go to solitary
even if they cause trouble.

317
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,242
Darn it. It didn't go in.

318
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,827
Did you buy the stock I mentioned?

319
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,246
I made a good sum of money thanks to you.

320
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,333
The best job is serving the VIPS.

321
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,835
Hey, I have a favor to ask.

322
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,379
Because you can make a lot of money
if they like you.

323
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,381
(whispering)

324

(tense music)

325
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:18,430
Grade C, with no money or connections,
are pretty much slaves.

326
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,891
They are treated like they're subhuman.

327
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,893
It's hell on earth.

328

329
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:41,578
That way. Go on.

330
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:51,964
Did you just laugh?

331
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,758
(inmates clamoring)

(inmates retching)

334
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,140
What are you looking at?

335
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:03,642
Damn it!

336
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,062
INMATE: Here he is.

337
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:14,361
I hear your wife coud die any day.

338
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,948
(murmurs)

339
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,535
You need money for surgery, right?

340
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,246
How much do you need?

341
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,583
(ominous music)

342
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,964

(music intensifies)

347
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,043
Damn it.

348
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,545
Get to the yard.

349
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:18,258
(alarm blaring)

350
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:26,808
Sir! Careful!

00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,394

(inmates clamoring)

00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,314
What's your problem?

354
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,816
(grunting)

355
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:40,989

INMATE: Move!

362
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,470
(inmate exclaims)

-Let go! Get off!
-No.

00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,360
Guards! Hurry!

00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,002
(groans)

377
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,896
HAPPY GUCHEON

378
00:21:56,648 --> 00:22:00,652
(breathing heavily)

379
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,451
CHANGHO: One mystery was resolved.

380
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:10,245
They were not the ones...

381
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,748
who turned me into Big Mouse.

382
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,419
(breathing heavily)

(suspenseful music)

384
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:30,974
Who was it?

385
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,519
Who did it and why?

386
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,356
Why did they frame me for being Big Mouse?

387
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,441
(music intensifies)

388
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,655
Do you know...

389
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,700
(exhales heavily)

390
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,870
...how many times I saved your life?

391
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,040
Should I thank you?

392
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,834
WARDEN PARK:
I like being exact about things.

393
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,837
What's the use of saying thank you
a hundred times?

394
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:03,131
One payment is much better.

395
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:11,556
(slurps)

396
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,350
(exhales heavily)

397
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:18,688
Give me five percent of what you siphoned
from Lala Capital.

398
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:21,483
Five billion won.

399
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:26,780
Do you have the 100-billion-won investment
for Lala Capital?

400
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,119
(ominous music)

(slurps)

402
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:36,206
There's no way you have all that money.

403
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,542
My gut tells me so.

404
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:42,504
WARDEN PARK: Do you know
why you're still breathing nonetheless?

405
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:46,466
Because Gong Jihoon believes
you're Big Mouse.

406
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:51,596
The day your cover is blown
will be your funeral.

407
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:55,392

WARDEN PARK:
You won't go down alone though.

410
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:02,441
Who else watched the dashcam video?

411
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,276
Your wife? Father-in-law?

412
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:07,195
(ominous music)

413
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:12,325
They won't leave your family alone.

414
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:16,371
You know how SUA accidents
happen frequently nowadays.

415
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:17,998
(tires screeching)

416

(groans)

417
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:23,962
They can get rid of them in an instant
without anyone ever finding out.

418
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:26,673
(ominous music continues)

419
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:33,597
What I'm getting at is this...

420
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:37,517
You'll need my help
to pretend to be Big Mouse,

421
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:40,145
so you may want to pay me monthly...

422
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:42,147
Don't touch my wife.

423
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:46,485
The moment you touch her, you're dead.

424
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:49,571
Gong Jihoon, his lackeys, and you.

425
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,408
As well as your families.

426
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:56,036
(suspenseful music)

427
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,245
(laughs)

428
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:04,753
Are you mad? Who do you think you are?

429
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:07,714
Big Mouse.

430
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,841
What?

431
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,886
(exhales heavily)

432
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:14,971
(inhales deeply)

433
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,223
Listen.

434
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,691
I'm really Big Mouse, you moron.

435
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:30,237
(theme music)

436
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:35,450
Pay you?

437
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,036
Then I wouldn't be Big Mouse.

438
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:40,288
CHANGHO: Watch with your own two eyes.

439
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,499
I'll show you...

440
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,253
why I'm Big Mouse.

441
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,886
(music continues)

(music stops)

444
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,400
PROSECUTOR: She's impressive.

445
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:11,486
She's been sitting perfectly still
for two hours.

446
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:15,407
Begin.

447
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,284
Yes, sir.

448
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,369
(ominous music)

449
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:20,579

(door opens)

452
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,252
My apologies.

453
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,797
I was being pulled left and right today.

454
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,090
(sighs)

455
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:36,011
You're here as a witness,
so no need to be nervous.

456
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:38,054
Just answer my questions truthfully.

457
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,392
When did you first meet Park Changho?

458
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:44,394
We were in the same class in high school.

459
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:45,895
PROSECUTOR: It's been a while.

460
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,647
When did you start going out?

461
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:52,193
We were friends for nine years, went out
for four, and were married for three.

462
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,154
It's been 16 years.

463
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:55,947
Who made the first move?

464
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:58,158
PROSECUTOR: Park Changho?

465
00:26:58,241 --> 00:27:01,745
Or did sparks fly instantly
when you first met?

466
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,998
Don't you want to know
about our first kiss?

467
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:06,916
I mean,

468
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,753
why don't you ask
when we first slept together?

469
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:11,838
(suspenseful music)

470
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:14,633
I'll rephrase that
if my question offended you.

471
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:18,011
How long have you known
that Park Changho was Big Mouse?

472
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,722
I'm here as a witness...

473
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:21,931
You may be an accomplice,

474
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:24,267
or aided and abetted in his crimes.

475
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,435
Listen here, prosecutor.

476
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:28,355
We uncover crimes people committed
even in their past lives.

477
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,815
Shall I start digging?

478
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,151
Let's see what I find on you.

479
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:38,948
I'll help in every way I can
to catch Big Mouse.

480
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:41,785
But he's not Big Mouse.

481
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,495
(laughs)

482
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:46,414
How are you so sure?

483
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:51,961
(music fades)

484
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,380
Because he's my husband.

485
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:56,299
(solemn music)

486
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,385
Because I know him...

487
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,596
better than anyone.

488
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,687
(breathes deeply)

489
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,024

WAITER: Welcome.

494

-(chair scrapes)
-(glass thuds)

495
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:17,589
(chuckles)

496
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:20,049
(chewing)

497
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:22,427
Isn't the weather just great
to drink and drop dead?

498
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,678

00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,430
Is something wrong?

500
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,311
I'm free starting today.

501
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:32,729
(chuckles)

502
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:37,442
I dumped that stupid jerk.

503
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:46,159
(dramatic music)

504
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,165
(Miho sobs, sniffles)

505
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:56,503
He said she was super pretty...

506
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:57,670
(sniffles)

507
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:00,757
...and that her family was rich.

(sobbing)

509
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:08,056
So I told him we should break up,

510
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:12,393
because I didn't want to get dumped.

511
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,604
(retches)
I'm gonna throw up.

512
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,610
-Miho.
-MIHO: No. Don't look.

513
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,779
I'll kill you if you look.

Miho.

Let's stop being friends.

518
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:55,979
Want to go out with me?

519
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:00,441
Forget him...

520
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:02,986
and go out with me.

521
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,323
(sighs)

522
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:09,200
He goes to Seoul University, right?

523
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,329
I started studying for the bar exam
because of you.

524
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:18,751
To become much more successful than him
and then ask you out.

What about your face?

527
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,433
He's much better looking.

528
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:37,687
I'll make an effort.

529
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,273
(sniffles)

530
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,692
Don't.

(Miho sobbing)

538
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:06,716
Why are you crying?

539
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,843
Get off. You're annoying me.

671
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:45,067
I'm pretty sure I warned you,

672

The moment you touch her, you're dead.

As well as your families.

676

There are so many eyes on me.

677
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:05,588

Not dog food, but real food!

681
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,524

Pardon?

Are you mad? What are you doing?

694
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:39,056
Park Changho's matter is out of my hands.

695
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:41,433
Warden Park, what do you mean?

696
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:45,062
He confessed to being Big Mouse.

697
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,773
I've already reported it to Mr. Gong.

698

DOOGEUN: Damn it!

699
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:51,360
You believed his bluff?

700
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:54,697
Don't make things difficult for me.

701
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,992
Negotiate with Mr. Gong.

703
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:03,872
That jerk.

704
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,083
What is wrong with him?

00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:10,838
(cheering, applauding)

706
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,478
It's food!

708
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:38,157
-INMATE 1: Is this seaweed?
-INMATE 2: Yes, it is.

709
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:40,951
It must be domestic. It's delicious.

710
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:42,995
(inmate 2 sighs)

711
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:45,497
-INMATE 2: This is amazing, Boss.
-INMATE 1: It's domestic.

712
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:51,503
Inmate 5247, you have a visitor.

713
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:54,840
Your lawyer's here.

00:43:58,552 --> 00:43:59,678

SOONTAE: Okay.

717
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:13,275
I'll let you two talk in private.

00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:35,506

00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:56,694
(sobs)
Miho.

723
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:58,445
Don't say anything.

724
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:04,410
I must stink.

725
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:09,123
Who cares about that right now?

726
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,751
(sobbing)

727
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:21,427
Didn't you hear that I wanted a divorce?

728
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:25,514
I'm breaking up with you.

729
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:27,850
I want nothing to do with you anymore.

730
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:30,436
(sobbing continues)

731
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:32,104
Did you think I'd jump at the chance

732
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:34,481
and divorce you if you sent
that stupid sheet of paper?

733
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:37,860
Miho.

734
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:40,904
You need to face reality.

735
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:42,990
There's no hope for me.

736
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,783
(sobbing)

737
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:47,453
I may rot in prison
for the rest of my life, stupid.

738
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:49,997
What if it were me?

739
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:54,585
If I were wrongly accused
and went to jail,

740
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:56,420
would you abandon me?

741
00:45:58,255 --> 00:45:59,548
(sighs)

742
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:03,427
(sobs)

743
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:04,928
You're not a jerk like that,

744
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,597
and neither am I.

745
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:08,557
A divorce?

746
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,017
(sniffles)

747
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,853
Once you clear your name
and get out of here, I'll divorce you.

748
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:14,104
Will that do?

749
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:18,358
(sobbing)

750
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:20,152
I may die.

751
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:22,821
Then I'll die, too.

752
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,702
We can live together in the afterlife.

753

757
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:48,555

00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,718
(breathes deeply)

832
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,720
You don't believe that I'm Big Mouse.

833
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:40,013
What if I do?

834
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:44,017
Can you really resolve what I want?

835
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:46,978
What do you want?

836
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:50,398
(sighs)

837
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:52,859
I have an only child, a daughter.

838
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,320
She disappeared without a trace one day.

839
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:58,490
ROOM LEADER:
She definitely didn't run away.

840
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:02,244
But no one has a grudge against me.

841
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:06,331
Did you report her missing?

842
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,167
Of course, I did.

843
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:12,087
But the police seemed to give up...

844
00:52:12,754 --> 00:52:14,631
after about a year had passed.

845
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,342
I couldn't sleep a wink...

846
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:20,846
and searched all the corners
of the earth to find her

847
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,849
and caused a car accident.

848
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:26,726
That got complicated,

849
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:29,437
and they called it a hit-and-run.

850
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:32,107
That's why I'm here.

851
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:34,901
(suspenseful music)

852
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:37,904
Please.

853
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,949
Find my daughter.

854
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:47,330
(sighs)

855
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:49,958
Write down her information.

856
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:52,169
HOLY BIBLE

857
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:53,420
(room leader sighs)

858
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:07,184
(music stops)

859
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:18,695
PSYCHOPATH: Will you grant a wish...

860
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:20,447
(scoffs)

861
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:26,328
...to someone on death row like me too?

862
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:30,207
(sighs)

863
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,375
As long as it isn't to avoid execution.

864
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:35,837
PSYCHOPATH: Then...

865
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:43,345
will you save my mom for me?

866
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:46,514
(solemn music)

867
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:53,188
PSYCHOPATH: She has leukemia
and got a bone marrow transplant.

868
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:58,151
But it came back
and she needs another transplant.

869
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:04,824
I don't care if I die, so...

870
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,662
(solemn music)

871
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:13,917
...please save my mom.

872
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:27,555
(solemn music)

873
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:40,527
Write down what hospital she's at
and her information.

874
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:44,114
(sniffles)

875
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:58,837
HAN MALSOOK

876
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,298
GUCHEON UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
BLOOD CANCER TREATMENT WARD

877
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:04,134
You seem to be mistaken.

878
00:55:04,592 --> 00:55:07,512
All of Professor Seo Jaeyoung's papers
have been published already.

879
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:11,016
(solemn music)

880
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:14,644
I worked on every published paper
Professor Seo wrote, so I'd know.

881
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:17,731
Couldn't he have written it alone
without telling anyone?

882
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:20,108
(scoffs)
He didn't have the skills for that.

883
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:22,110
He couldn't even do the research.

884
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,697
I know it may sound like
I'm speaking ill of the dead,

885
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,533
but Professor Seo was infamous

886
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:30,660
for stealing residents' papers.

887
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:35,457
(tense music)

888
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:38,710
MIHO: I think the residents are lying.

889
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:42,630
The nurses said he had
a strong sense of responsibility.

890
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:45,342
I met a few patients
who were previously discharged,

891
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:47,177
and they were very grateful
to Professor Seo.

892
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:50,055
MIHO'S FATHER:
They said he was skillful and kind.

893
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:53,975
I don't think he was the type
to copy someone else's paper.

894
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:56,269
Seeing how the doctors
are sticking to a common story,

895
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:59,314
that paper must have something huge.

896
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:02,233
Ms. Ko. The director wants to see you.

897
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:04,110
The director?

898
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:05,820
See you later.

899
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:07,655
Okay.

900
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:11,910
(ominous music)

901
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:21,378
(keypad clacking)

902
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:32,430
(knocks on door)

903
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:34,015
Come in.

904
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:51,699
Your husband is Park Changho, correct?

905
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:53,535
Big Mouse.

906
00:56:58,373 --> 00:56:59,874
I'll get right to it.

907
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,502
I'd like you...

908
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:05,422
to leave this hospital voluntarily.

909
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:11,594
Have you heard of innocent
until proven guilty?

910
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:15,181
Please don't treat him like a criminal
before a judgment is rendered.

911
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:18,393
Even after a judgment is rendered,
as per labor laws,

912
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:20,186
it's up to me whether or not I resign.

913
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:24,816
(scoffs)

914
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:28,236
Get back to work.

915
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:30,113
I'm done.

916
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:32,449
Professor Seo Jaeyoung...

917
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:35,869
was murdered for his paper.
Did you know that?

918
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:42,125
Mayor Choi Doha was the one
who hired my husband for the case.

919
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:45,170
This case is why my husband
was framed for being Big Mouse.

920
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:48,965
DIRECTOR, HYUN JUHEE

921
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:50,633
What's your point?

922
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:52,218
I want to know who has the paper now,

923
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,804
and what it was about.

924
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:56,139
You're wasting your time.

925
00:57:56,764 --> 00:57:59,350
There was never such a paper.

926
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:01,686
(suspenseful music)

927
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:02,812
Ma'am.

928
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:05,815
Do you know how much his case
harmed the hospital?

929
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:08,526
JUHEE: We're finally recovering.
Why do you want to rehash it now?

930
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:10,320
Because of that case, the victims...

931
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:13,656
What if the hospital fails
to operate normally and patients die?

932
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:17,202
Who will appease them?

933
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:23,875
No one is more important to me
than the patients.

934
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:27,712
Please leave now.

935
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:43,811
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

936
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:47,982
(indistinct PA announcement)

937
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:52,612
WOMAN: Excuse me.

938
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:54,197
Please save my husband.

939
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:57,784
-Pardon?
-I can't trust anyone here.

940
00:58:58,409 --> 00:59:00,578
WOMAN:
They won't let him go to another hospital.

941
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:01,955
They can't do anything for him...

942
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:03,790
HEAD NURSE: Ms. Ko.

943
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:05,875
(suspenseful music)

944
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:08,545
-Excuse me.
-HEAD NURSE: Get ready to make rounds.

945
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:12,257
She's Room 701's guardian, right?

946
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:14,342
She must've talked nonsense again.

947
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:16,386
She seems to be delusional.

948
00:59:17,011 --> 00:59:18,888
HEAD NURSE: Avoid her as much as you can.

949
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:23,268
(music intensifies)

950
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:26,896
You know...

951
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:30,817
that Park Changho is taking wish requests
from inmates, right?

952
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:35,697
He wants to get followers
and act like a cult leader.

953
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:38,116
Did you know? Are you letting him be?

954
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:41,369
Park Changho's matter is out of my hands.

955
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:45,415
If inmates band together under him,

956
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:48,084
it'll become a pain
in the neck for you too.

957
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:50,962
-I have no choice.
-Three large.

958
00:59:51,045 --> 00:59:53,256
(suspenseful music)

959
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:57,135
I know you have a mule account.

960
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:00,013
I'll deposit 300 million won there.

961
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:03,099
DOOGEUN: Three.

962
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:04,350
That's 300 million won.

963
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:06,394
(mumbles)

964
01:00:06,477 --> 01:00:08,605
I can't handle Mr. Gong.

965
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:12,108
Don't worry. This plan is flawless.
No one knows.

966
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:15,028
I'll decide after I hear about the plan.

967
01:00:15,653 --> 01:00:16,779
(Chaebong laughs)

968
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:18,448
What if we fail?

969
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:20,700
We'll suspect you first.
Is that all right?

970
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:25,747
All you have to do
is look the other way once.

971
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,541
We'll find the actors ourselves.

972
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:33,171
Okay. Jot down your account number.

973
01:00:33,254 --> 01:00:35,048
We'll send you one as a down payment

974
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:37,550
and the remaining two once it's done.

975
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:39,093
Two large as down payment.

976
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:41,137
One after it's done.

977
01:00:43,931 --> 01:00:45,391
-Okay.
-Short and sweet.

978
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:46,643
Good.

979
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:48,353
(laughing)

980
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:50,438
(tense music)

981
01:00:54,942 --> 01:00:55,943
GUARD: Go in.

982
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:08,831
(ominous music)

983
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:12,377
That's the jerk who tried to stab you...

984
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,504
GUARD: Don't cause trouble and get along.

985
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:20,843
(door closes)

986
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:28,559
(music stops)

987
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:35,316
I didn't believe
that you were Big Mouse back then.

988
01:01:35,983 --> 01:01:37,026
Please forgive me.

989
01:01:38,444 --> 01:01:41,155
INMATE: I know we're shameless,
but please grant us our wishes, too.

990
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:44,701
If you take us in,
we'll serve you for the rest of our lives.

991
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:49,622
(murmuring)

992
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:52,417
You have a snake brain
and a floating pupil,

993
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:53,793
so you're self-centered.

JERRY: Boss, I may scam people,
but I'm not a traitor.

1024
01:04:19,605 --> 01:04:22,525
Scamming is betraying.
How is it any different?

1025
01:04:22,608 --> 01:04:23,985
That's different.

1026
01:04:24,068 --> 01:04:27,238
A scam is just business.
Do we have a business relationship?

1027

It's just pure respect all the way.

I tried to hurt you for money,

you shouldn't trust the rich.
