00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:43,960
BIG MOUTH

3
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,754
THIS SHOW IS A WORK OF FICTION

4
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:48,965
THE EVENTS AND ENTITIES
THAT APPEAR HEREIN ARE FICTIONAL

5
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:53,970
CHAEBONG: It's not like we'll try
to break out. What is this?

6
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:56,848
WARDEN PARK:
You can't leave the specified area

7
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,475
and you can't go out at night.

8
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:02,062
If you destroy the anklet,
you'll get seven years in prison

9
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,522
and must pay a fine
of up to 20 million won.

10
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:06,149
WARDEN PARK: So be careful.

11
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,735
(ominous music)

12
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,030
(gate opens)

13
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:15,784
(Chaebong sighs)

14
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,243
CHAEBONG: This is so nice.

15
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,328
EPISODE 7

16
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,662
(Chaebong chuckles)

17
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,667
Stay in touch. Good work.

18
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,462
CHAEBONG: Gosh.

19
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,131
INFORMATION

20
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:32,467
(sighs)

21
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,551
You have it on, right?

22
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:35,386
MAN: Yes, sir.

23
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,305
Let's go.

24
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:41,392
TRUSTWORTHY LAW, HAPPY GUCHEON

25
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:53,029
CHANGHO: Confess at the trial.

26
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,865
Why are you sharing the crime?

27
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,952
You were an accessory.
And Gong Jihoon instigated it.

28
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,832
CHUNSIK: No one here is good.
Everyone is a bad guy.

29
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,542
CHANGHO: Want to make a bet?

30
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,628
On which of us gets out of here first.

31
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,174
(inmate murmuring)

32
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:16,845
Oops. My bad. That was my bad.

33
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,848
-JERRY: A ball. It's a ball.
-ROOM LEADER: Hey.

34
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,307
A ball came flying.

35
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,600
(gate opens)

36
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:25,603
(suspenseful music)

37
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,274
(gate closes)

38
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,112
Are you getting off work?

39
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,238
Make sure

40
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:38,575
Park Changho doesn't get close
to Dr. Han while I'm not around.

41
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:40,827
WARDEN PARK: Call me if there's a problem.

42
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,120
GUARD: Yes, sir.

43
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,373
Have a nice weekend.

44
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,422
(music intensifies)

45
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,506
(music stops)

46
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,885
(indistinct background chatter)

47
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,345
(suspenseful music)

48
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:09,647
(tense music)

49
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,816
(inaudible)

50
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,447
(breathes heavily)

51
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:24,287
DR. HAN:
I had no intention of betraying you.

52
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,624
Chairman Yang. You know me.

53
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,709
Look how you're protecting me like this.

54
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:33,046
I will never betray you.

55
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:38,968
So you want me to put in
a good word with Mr. Gong, right?

56
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,512
Yes.

57
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,181
Please clear up the misunderstanding.

58
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:46,184
I'm counting on you. Please, sir.

59
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:48,561
You're the only one I can rely on.

60
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,026
What about the cameras?

61
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,903
They'll be down until lights out.

62
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,030
CHUNSIK:
You know where my restaurant is, right?

63
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:02,909
Take all your colleagues
and relieve some stress.

64
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:04,869
Yes, sir.

65
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,955
(tense music)

66
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,919
Hey. Put down some plastic.

67
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,837
INMATES: Yes, Boss.

68
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,173
(suspenseful music)

69
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,887
(whimpers)

70
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:27,517
DR. HAN: What… are you doing?

71
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,020
Don't resent me.

72
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,399
I'm doing this
because Gong Jihoon told me to.

73
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,402
What? Mr. Gong?
(yelps)

74
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,529
(muffled screaming)

75
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,075
CHUNSIK: It's right here.
Finish it in one blow.

76
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:48,454
If you miss, it'll get really messy.

77
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,415
It'll be a pain to clean up.

78
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,041
(whimpering)

79
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,252
-Here.
-INMATE: Don't you worry, Boss.

80
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:57,046
-You can count on me.
-Show us how it's done.

81
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,673
(muffled whimpering)

82
00:04:58,756 --> 00:04:59,882
INMATE: Stay still.

83
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,011
Let's go.

84
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,679
Into God's embrace, you go.

85
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:07,390
-(muffled screaming)
-INMATE: Don't move. Stay still.

86
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,767
(music intensifies)

87
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,145
(door opens)

88
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:13,521
INMATE: What's going on?

89
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:15,982
(suspenseful music)

90
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:18,901
(whimpering)

91
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,410
(music stops)

92
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,331
WARDEN

93
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,416
(ominous music)

94
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,433
I'll keep it short.

95
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,310
Give me Han Jaeho and disappear quietly.

96
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,395
(whimpers)

97
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,480
(scoffs)

98
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,148
I can't do that.

99
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:01,694
CHUNSIK: You guys should leave
while I'm being nice. Okay?

100
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:04,739
No good will come
of making an enemy of me.

101
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:07,033
Oh, my.
(laughs)

102
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:11,162
You keep stealing the words from my mouth.

103
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,455
(Chunsik chuckles)

104
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,832
If you want to take him,

105
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,585
kill me first.

106
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,421
(Dr. Han sniffles, whimpers)

107
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,300
(tense music)

108
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,429
INMATE: Get them!

109
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:31,474
(inmates clamoring)

110
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,559
(tense music)

111
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:45,655
(Dr. Han groans)

112
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,783
(music intensifies)

113
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,248
(whimpering)

114
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,335
(ominous music)

115
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,881
(ominous music rises)

116
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,933
BIG MOUTH

117
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:18,938
(Dr. Han hiccups)

118
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,733
(breathes heavily)

119
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,278
(hiccups)

120
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,071
(panting)

121
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,239
(hiccups)

122
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:32,827
(breathing heavily)

123
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:36,330
I swear I'll repay you for today...

124
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,874
What's in Professor Seo's paper?

125
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,500
(hiccups)

126
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,962
If Gong Jihoon tried to kill you,

127
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:45,673
it means he wants to blame you
for everything in this trial.

128
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:47,091
Why are you still hiding it?

129
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,762
If Chairman Yang kills me,

130
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,224
whom do you think Gong Jihoon will frame?

131
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,437
You'd get another murder charge tacked on.

132
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,649
As you said,

133
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,860
we ended up sharing a common fate.

134
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:11,073
I have to live for you to live.
Am I right?

135
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:14,952
Damn it.

136
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,788
You have a big head but no brain.

137
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,125
(ominous music)

138
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,920
Do you think I helped you
because I was afraid of that?

139
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,130
Should I just leave?
Want to see what they do?

140
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,674
You'll be found dead by morning.

141
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,135
The moment I talk,

142
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,389
I'll be living in hell.

143
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,145
Gong Jihoon? He's nothing.

144
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,773
There are people
much more frightening involved.

145
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,566
(ominous music)

146
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,818
I see, so there's someone behind him.

147
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:49,946
Who?

148
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,740
I can't say anything more.

149
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,119
DR. HAN:
Don't try to find out about the paper.

150
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:00,790
I'll do everything you ask
other than that. Please?

151
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,922
(indistinct chattering)

152
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:09,799
Lightly.

153
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,884
That hurts. Be gentle.

154
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,761
You're doing that on purpose.

155
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,137
What a crybaby.

156
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,390
You've been stabbed so many times.

157
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:19,267
JERRY: I'm done anyway.

158
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,811
(chattering continues)

159
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,063
What will we do
about the statue of Virgin Mary?

160
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,065
JERRY: The warden will throw a fit.

161
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:30,194
INMATE: I know. Why did Big Mouse
suddenly break the statue?

162
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:33,531
You wanted it to look real
so that Dr. Han wouldn't catch on.

163
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:36,158
ROOM LEADER:
It could happen when you get into it.

164
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,451
All done.
(yelps)

165
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,413
(Jerry laughs)
Anyway, are you sure you fight well?

166
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:43,958
You looked really scared earlier,
cowering like this.

167
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,794
You little punk.
You want me to kick your butt?

168
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:49,714
INMATE: I was just keeping my word.
You want to have a go?

169
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:52,008
Everyone knows now that you can't fight.

170
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,594
-INMATE 1: Give me another one.
-INMATE 2: Hey. He's here.

171
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,012
(chatter stops)

172
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,060
(Changho sighs)

173
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:07,732
I had to be a spy for the first time
in my life because of you.

174
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,818
Thank you, Chairman Yang.

175
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:16,532
You know I'm being released
in three months, right?

176
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,412
If you can't get out of here first,

177
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:26,709
I'll kill you for scamming me.

178
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,794
(pensive guitar music)

179
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,380
Just get out.

180
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,924
I'll take care of you
for the rest of your life.

181
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:37,845
(sighs)

182
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,389
Once I get out this time,

183
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,517
I'm leaving this life.

184
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,481
Just take care of my boys.

185
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,568
They're the reason I did this crap.

186
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,945
(suspenseful music)

187
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,989
INMATES: Good day, Mr. Chairman.

188
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,660
-INMATE 1: The chairman's leaving.
-INMATE 2: Mr. Chairman.

189
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,663
INMATES: Have a nice day.

(inmates murmuring)

191
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,423
Boss. What do you plan to do with Dr. Han?

192
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,593
Seeing how they left him here,

193
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,221
they probably won't let him go
anywhere near the trial.

194
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:33,067
-INMATE 1: Boss!
-INMATE 2: Hey. Are you okay?

196
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,778

CHANGHO: It's your turn now,

199
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:54,714

Ms. Jang Hyejin.

205
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,273
I think she went into hiding.

206
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,776
MIHO'S FATHER: She didn't show up
at school or for her show.

207
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,445
MIHO: Her phone's off as well.

(sighs)

209
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,948
You don't think
Gong Jihoon abducted her, do you?

210
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:23,951
Why would he?
He doesn't know about the necklace.

211
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,828
Only you figured that out.

212
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,372
Check her parents' house
and ask her friends.

213
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:31,459
WOMAN (over PA):
Code blue, CPR. Cancer Ward Room 704.

-We can still save him.
-What are you doing?

219
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,224
He's in a coma.

220
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,684
You know he's a DNR patient.

221
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,437
Follow the rules. Stay out of it.

222

WOMAN: Ms. Ko?

236
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,365
Are you here to pay respects?

237
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:51,372
WOMAN 1: Why would you cremate him
when he has a burial plot?

238
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,499
Is it because the hospital paid you?

239
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,712
MAN: There was nothing in the DNR form
that said he couldn't be buried.

240
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:02,341
It wasn't in the DNR form,

241
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,261
but there was a confidentiality clause.

242
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,763
WOMAN 2: It said we can't get an autopsy

243
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,974
and that he must be cremated.

244
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:14,061
You should've told us sooner.
We chose a burial plot already.

245
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,314
(woman 1 sighs)
Poor Kisung.

246
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:21,652
He caught a terminal illness in prison
and didn't last two months.

247
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:23,737
(ominous music)

248
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,910
They prohibited an autopsy
and demanded cremation.

249
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,579
They must have something to hide.

250
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:34,081
If they had a confidentiality clause,

251
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,791
they really are hiding something.

252
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,168
You have a friend
at the National Forensic Service, right?

253
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,712
The NFS? Why?

254
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,882
I'm going to get Nam Kisung's blood.

255
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,634
We can analyze
if it's within 12 hours of death.

256
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,720
Hey. What if you get caught?

257
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,972
I'll take care of it. See you later.

You can do it. Have faith in yourself.

Must I take it by force?

285

You know it's illegal
to search someone's bag without consent.

286

I lost my appetite.

301
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,275
Because of what just happened?

302
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,486
You're too sensitive about her.

303
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,405

00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:39,751
Can the blood analysis really tell us
what's in the paper?

393
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:43,380
Not all of it, but it'll tell us

That man who attacked you earlier

00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:54,644
(music continues)

502
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,548
(music intensifies)

503
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,562
(ominous music)

504
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:42,650
(suspenseful music)

505
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,702
CONFESSION

506
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:04,964
HOLY BIBLE

507
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,777
(ominous music)

508
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:32,116
(music intensifies)

509
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:49,467
JERRY: Do you know Tom and Jerry?
My nickname is Jerry.

510
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,511
I'm a huge fan of Big Mouse,

511
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:53,596
so I went with a different mouse.

512
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:57,266
CHANGHO: The punk who was the first
to approach me and be good to me.

513
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,519
Big Mouse.
Only people who bet on Big Mouse.

514
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:01,729
The kid who believed without a doubt

515
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,065
that I was Big Mouse.

516
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:09,487
The jerk who was always with me
wherever I went.

517
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,699
(inmates cheering)

518
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:15,910
INMATES (chanting):
Big! Big! Big! Big! Big!

519
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:19,539
(inmates cheering)

520
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:22,542
JERRY: Boss. Wake up.

521
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:25,670
What's wrong? Did you lose something?

522
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:28,589
(tense music)

523
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:35,847
(music stops)

524
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:38,975
-INMATE: Come on! You can do it!
-(inmates cheering)

525
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:41,060
INMATE: You can do it!

526
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:42,603
(cheering continues)

527
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:45,898
It's for 100,000 won.
You can do it, right?

528
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:49,193
Come now.
I've got solid muscle on the inside.

529
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:52,363
(grunting)

530
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:53,531
-INMATE: Let's go!
-Yes!

531
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:56,701
(inmates cheering)

532
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,123
-Here I go!
-INMATE: You got this!

533
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:05,877
INMATES: One! Two!

534
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,463
Three! Four!

535
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:11,799
Five! Six!

536
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,927
Seven! Eight!

537
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,804
-Nine!
-Nine! One more!

538
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,182
-One more?
-ROOM LEADER: Yes! One more.

539
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:21,434
(applause and cheers)

540
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,146
Go to the snack shop

541
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:28,858
and buy some pastries, cookies,
sausages, things like that.

542
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:30,068
-JERRY: Go!
-Count me in!

543
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:33,154
Buy sliced kimchi and stir-fried anchovies
to have with dinner too.

544
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,197
I can't wait.

545
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,907
(muttering)

546
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:39,786
-INMATE 1: Yeah!
-INMATE 2: Hurrah!

547
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,871
(ominous music)

548
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:46,167
INMATE 1: We're feasting tonight!

549
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:49,629
(inmates clamoring)

550
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:53,591
(inmates laughing)

551
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:55,885
-INMATE 1: Stir-fried anchovies.
-INMATE 2: Sliced kimchi!

552
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:59,806
(ominous music)

553
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,899
(water dripping)

554
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,737
It's just the two of us in here.

555
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:16,989
HOT BATH

556
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,116
JERRY: Okay.

557
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,869
What is it? Is something wrong?

558
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:25,706
Even if one of us dies in here,
no one will help.

559
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:30,002
(chuckles)

560
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,923
What's wrong?
You're making me uncomfortable.

561
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:36,008
(foreboding music)

562
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:39,011
I'll give you three tries.

563
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,639
You tell me why I'm doing this.

564
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,063
Well...

565
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:54,819
Boss, I didn't do anything wrong to you.

566
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:55,945
Two left.

567
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:58,489
(water dripping)

568
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:06,414
JERRY: You must be mistaken
about something.

569
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:12,628
Last chance.

570
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,343
(suspenseful music)

571
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,638
Boss, I really don't know.

572
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,766
I didn't do anything wrong, so...

573
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:29,687
Is this because...

574
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:32,815
Is it because I went
into the confession booth?

575
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,693
(ominous music)

576
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,571
I mean... Boss.

577
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:40,948
Was that so bad that I must die for it?

578
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:45,161
You kept going in there,
so I was curious...

579
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:47,914
Why did you take the tarot card?

580
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:52,710
I didn't take it. I left it in the Bible.

581
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:57,465
If it went missing, someone else took it.
It wasn't me.

582
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:05,014
JERRY: If I really did take it, then...

583
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:10,144
I'll give you my life. Please, believe me.

584
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,313
(tense music)

585
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:28,079
(music stops)

586
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,582
-Get out.
-Yes, Boss. Please...

587
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:32,959
Get out!

588
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:39,924
(exhales)

589
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,641
(ominous music)

590
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,149
(breathes deeply)

591
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:58,734
(door closes)

592
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:01,237
(sighs)

593
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:04,865
(phone clicks)

594
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:24,677
(suspenseful music)

595
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,057
CHANGHO: It skipped 30 minutes.

596
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:34,145
That means someone edited the video.

597
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,983
(music intensifies)

598
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,652
-(music fades)
-(phone vibrates)

599
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,656
MIHO: Call me when you get this.
It's urgent.

600
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:47,283
MIHO

601
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,661
-(line ringing)
-(exhales sharply)

602
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:53,039
I received flowers.

603
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:54,707
CHANGHO: Flowers?

604
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,083
What flowers?

605
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,169
White chrysanthemums.
Thirty-three of them.

606
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,213
JIHOON: Did you send them?

607
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,841
Did you send my wife...

608
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:05,801
Thirty-four white chrysanthemums.

609
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,721
She's 34 years old, right?

610
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:12,725
There's a tarot card in here too.
I think it's from Big Mouse.

611
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:14,560
I'll send you a picture of it.

612
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:16,020
(phone vibrates)

613
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,732
THE FOOL

614
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,694
CHANGHO: Tarot card number zero,
the Fool Reversed.

615
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,280
It means a careless, foolish act.

616
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,075
This is a warning.

617
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:32,370
Only four people knew
about the hidden camera.

618
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:35,081
Miho, me, her father, and Soontae.

619
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,000
How did Big Mouse find out?

620
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:41,420
(suspenseful music)

621
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,005
(exhales heavily)

622
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:56,769
(music fades)

623
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:04,819
(exhales sharply)

624
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,654
You're not Big Mouse, are you?

625
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:10,616
(ominous music)

626
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,786
JERRY: Big Mouse uses tarot cards
to send you orders

627
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:15,621
and you just follow them.

628
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,124
Right?

629
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:26,966
(sighs)

630
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:32,972
You made that up
about granting wishes, didn't you?

631
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:35,558
(sighs)

632
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:39,228
Watch your mouth if you don't want to die.

633
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,607
Why did you toy with us?

634
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,235
You're just a fake.
Why did you say you'd grant our wishes

635
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:48,529
and torture us with hope?

636
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,115
(exhales sharply)

637
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:55,453
Just tell me who Big Mouse is.
I really have to meet him.

638
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:01,000
Don't look up to Big Mouse.

639
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:02,793
Your life will be destroyed like mine.

640
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:05,379
My life can't be destroyed
any worse than it is now.

641
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,591
Tell me. Please?

642
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:15,723
Forget everything from today...

643
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:18,851
if you want to live.

644
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:24,565
(breathing heavily)

645
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,367
(door opens)

646
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,453
JIHOON: Hi. Come in, Prosecutor Choi.

647
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:40,122
(chuckles)
You haven't met before, right?

648
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,625
Hello, I'm Lee Doogeun.

649
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:45,836
I'm Jung Chaebong. Nice to meet you.

650
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,217
-JIHOON: Sit down, all of you.
-(Doogeun chuckles)

651
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:56,347
I read over the trial strategy
that you sent.

652
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:01,018
You set it up nicely. You taught me one.

653
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:03,312
Stop that. You're embarrassing me.

654
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:07,149
-The defense attorney would be...
-Me, of course. I set it up.

655
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:09,360
(percussive music)

656
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:10,778
What about the judge?

657
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,696
You know Park Chulsoo.

658
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:16,492
The bastard who thinks
he's the smartest guy in the world.

659
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:19,828
We need to come up with a good plan.
That's why we've gathered after all.

660
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:21,330
MR. CHA

661
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:23,749
Hold on. Give me a minute.

662
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:26,252
(phone vibrating)

663
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:30,089
JIHOON: Hello, Mr. Cha.
To what do I owe the pleasure?

664
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:32,758
MR. CHA: The chairman says to gather
at the theater.

665
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:36,929
The theater?
The elder must be in a good mood.

666
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:39,807
Okay.

667
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,475
-(phone beeps)
-Where's the theater?

668
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,435
The elder's private movie theater.

669
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:45,729
We'll go with you and say hi.

670
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:47,815
Are you sure?

671
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:50,651
He's the reason
we're going through this crap.

672
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,069
This is all because the elder...

673
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:54,280
Hey. Seriously.

674
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:57,908
It's okay. Prosecutor Choi knows enough.

675
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:01,203
He's part of the family now, right?

676
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:03,539
(Jihoon slurps)

677
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:11,880
(gasps)

678
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:13,215
-Doogeun.
-DOOGEUN: Hey.

679
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:15,759
-(laughing)
-SEUNGTAE: You guys came too.

680
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:18,512
-It must've been so hard.
-Not at all.

681
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,139
-Have you been well?
-Of course.

682
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:21,682
DOOGEUN: How could you not come to visit?

683
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:23,892
I was out of the country
on business trips and whatnot.

684
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:26,270
-DOOGEUN: Whatever.
-SEUNGTAE: It's true.

685
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:30,024
Hey. Mayor Choi is here.

686
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:32,693
(jazz music playing)

687
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:38,949
Should you be out like this
while you're out on bail?

688
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,119
Everyone here is a member.

689
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:44,455
No one will report us
if you keep your mouth shut.

690
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:46,123
(laughs)

691
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:48,125
That's why you should be careful.

692
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:51,712
If word gets out, it'll hurt the members.

693
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,089
(groans)

694
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:56,383
How did it go with Judge Park Chulsoo?

695
00:43:57,926 --> 00:43:59,470
You said you'd win him over.

696
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:02,264
You talked big in front of the elder,
remember?

697
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:06,352
I was too busy to meet with him.
You can handle it.

698
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:10,648
(laughs)

699
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,650
(man clapping)

700
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:15,694
The chairman is here. Please come in.

701
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:17,196
Okay. Let's go.

702
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,406
-Shall we?
-CHAEBONG: Let's go.

703
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:22,826
SEUNGTAE: Let's go.

704
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:27,081
MAN (on TV): After the Korean War
that broke out in 1950,

705
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:31,585
Gucheon was in ruins
and in a state of despair.

706
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:34,421
People who had lost their homes

707
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:37,591
and had nowhere to go
ended up on the streets…

708
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:40,052
ASHLEY KIM:
That was what Gucheon used to look like?

709
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:42,680
(gasps)
How terrible.

710
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:44,515
It seemed helpless.

711
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:50,104
However, Gucheon began to recover
at a rapid pace

712
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:53,065
-and came back to life.
-They tore it all down

713
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:55,442
-and developed the area.
-The people came together

714
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,861
and began developing the city.

715
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:02,408
In 1980, before anyone else…

716
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:05,411
ASHLEY KIM:
Hey. That little kid is you, right?

717
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:07,496
(exclaims)
How cute.

718
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:08,914
(Ashley Kim giggles)

719
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:10,624
-In 1960…
-(Seungtae gasps)

720
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,584
-It's my grandfather.
-ASHLEY KIM: Where?

721
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:14,336
Third from the left.

722
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,755
MAN: They gave us convenience.

723
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:22,094
Formed with the best medical staff
to ensure the health of every citizen,

724
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:24,930
Gucheon University Hospital
was established.

725
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:31,603
All of this was possible
because of Chairman Kang Sunggeun,

726
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:35,190
the former division leader.

727
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:37,943
When he retired, Chairman Kang…

728
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:40,696
Look. That's my grandfather.

729
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:42,114
That's my grandfather next to him.

730
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:46,076
He created countless jobs.

731
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,620
-That was not all…
-(Ashley Kim laughs)

732
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:50,289
ASHLEY KIM: But seriously.

733
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:52,082
Why is Mayor Choi here?

734
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:53,667
He has no connection.

735
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,502
CHAEBONG: That's why he's shameless.

736
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,713
He has no idea
when he does and doesn't belong.

737
00:45:58,297 --> 00:46:00,048
-(laughter)
-Also, NK Chemical

738
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:02,885
has been working together

739
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:06,013
on the business that handles waste
from Gucheon City

740
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:08,182
to turn them into clean energy resources.

741
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:10,267
(uplifting music playing)

742
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:16,148
The godfather of the chemical industry,

743
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:21,570
Chairman Kang always treated his employees
warmly like family.

744
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:25,741
The employees followed his vision

745
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:30,788
and helped Gucheon's enormous development.

746
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:37,002
Nice!

747
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:38,754
-Hurray for NK Chemical!
-(applause)

748
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:41,173
Beautiful! Wonderful!

749
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:43,091
Peaceful!

750
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:45,052
(Jihoon cheering)

751
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:47,971
Nice. It's good every time I watch it.

752
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:49,473
(applause continues)

753
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:51,725
(cheering)

754
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:07,783
(ominous music)

755
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:12,120
Most of those people in the photos...

756
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:17,084
who created the Gucheon of today
have passed away.

757
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:21,213
Why is there nothing on the NR Forum?

758
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:24,633
I mean, those of us here
are the main players now.

759
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:27,177
That misconception is exactly
why I've called you kids here.

760
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:35,561
(gasps)

761
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,653
Because I lost a leg,

762
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:47,281
I had to leave the military.

763
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:50,450
ELDER: I created all of those miracles

764
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,786
on a wheelchair with one leg.

765
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:55,080
All you did was meet good parents.

766
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:57,082
How dare you act like the masters?

767
00:47:57,666 --> 00:48:00,210
ELDER: Don't create the ending
of that video you just watched.

768
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:02,296
I'm searching for someone

769
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:05,090
who will succeed me
and continue the glory.

770
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:07,342
That is this old man's final goal

771
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,344
and wish.

772
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:12,306
(suspenseful music)

773
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:14,016
(exhales)

774
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:21,940
(suspenseful music continues)

775
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:29,740
Have a nice day.

776
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:40,375
That means he wants
to choose a successor. Am I right?

777
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:44,129
You know he calls in Juhee every day now.

778
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:46,590
That's only natural. She's his doctor.

779
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:47,925
You're so naive.

780
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:50,761
Mayor Choi's more confident
than he used to be.

781
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:52,262
SEUNGTAE: Why do you think that is?

782
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:54,765
Are you saying Director Hyun
is pulling something

783
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:56,350
to make her husband the successor?

784
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,018
It's totally possible.

785
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:00,979
SEUNGTAE: Stay on your toes.

786
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:03,106
All the members know
that you've been in the doghouse

787
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:06,026
ever since you lost the money
to Big Mouse.

788
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:10,781
You little…

789
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:11,865
(clicks tongue)

790
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:14,952
(rain pouring)

791
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:27,839
(tense music)

792
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:51,363
(suspenseful music)

793
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,622
(singing in distance)

794
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:02,457
♪ So sad ♪

795
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:08,839
♪ Are you as lonely as I am ♪

796
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:11,800
-(music stops)
-What bastard…

797
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:13,135
JIHOON: Hey!

798
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:16,346
You came. You said you couldn't make it.

799
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:17,723
(laughs)

800
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:19,307
Get out, all of you.

801
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:21,643
Why? You don't like them?

802
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,396
-Should I get new girls?
-Get out!

803
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:30,777
(inhales deeply)

804
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,405
(exhales heavily)

805
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:38,994
Why are you doing this here?

806
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:40,787
The trial is just around the corner.

807
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:42,706
(sighs)

808
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:46,752
(feedback)

809
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:47,836
The trial?

810
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:51,506
You'll take care of it for me.

811
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:56,386
I don't render the verdict.

812
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:58,805
Tell me. What's the problem?

813
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,516
Because of Big Mouse,

814
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:04,269
I'm about to get dumped by the elder.

815
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:05,771
(smirks)

816
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:07,105
(clangs)

817
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:09,399
(breathes heavily)

818
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:11,693
Just get the 100 billion back.

819
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:16,531
Even pulling that crap
in prison didn't work. So how?

820
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:21,995
I wish I could drag that Big Mouse
out of there and hang him.

821
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:25,832
-Why can't you?
-(exhales sharply)

822
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:28,293
I'm not in the mood for jokes.

823
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:32,339
(glass clanks)

824
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:36,593
I'll get you
the million-volt electric chair.

825
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:38,553
Do you want to sit him there?

826
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:45,769
Do you have any good ideas?

827
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:49,439
(suspenseful music)

828
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:01,868
(slurps)

829
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:08,917
(slurps)

830
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,503
The food today is kind of…
(clears throat)

831
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:23,682
Hey. Did something happen
between you and Big Mouse?

832
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:25,934
What do you mean?

833
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:29,813
You've been treating him
very differently recently.

834
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:32,357
ROOM LEADER: You don't serve him anymore.

835
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,942
-(thuds)
-Damn it.

836
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:37,154
I'm not his lackey.
I don't have to serve him all the time.

837
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:40,282
Why are you getting mad?
If you're not, you're not.

838
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:42,284
Enjoy your meal.

839
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:45,120
Inmate 2548. You have a visitor.

840
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:46,955
Me?

841
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,126
Clean this up for me.

842
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:52,627
Guard, is it really for me?

843
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:59,134
Gosh, I'm shocked
someone actually came to visit him.

844
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:04,306
ROOM LEADER: Let's eat.

845
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:09,644
-JERRY: Hey, Mutt.
-WOMAN: Hey!

846
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:10,770
JERRY: What…

847
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:14,774
What a surprise.

848
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,943
-JERRY: How have you been?
-I've been well.

849
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:18,528
(exhales heavily)

850
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:20,697
So… How's Grandma?

851
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:25,327
Her dementia got worse,
so she doesn't even recognize me.

852
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,455
Gosh.

853
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:31,958
It must be hard on you.

854
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:34,377
But she's in a nursing home now

855
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:37,005
and I'm returning to school next semester.

856
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:38,298
What do you mean?

857
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:42,510
With what money?
Are you doing something bad?

858
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:44,596
WOMAN: I'm not you.

859
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:48,016
I met someone really nice
who offered to sponsor me.

860
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:51,436
What are you talking about?

861
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:53,438
Who would sponsor you and why?

862
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:55,190
(door opens)

863
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:58,485
(suspenseful music)

864
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:04,658
(door closes)

865
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:19,464
GUARD: Pack your things and come out.

866
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:29,891
-(door closes)
-Why are you packing your things?

867
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:32,519
Are you being transferred?

868
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:40,610
I'm being released.

869
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:42,862
You're getting out?

870
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:45,782
Yes. My sister came with a lawyer.

871
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:48,326
(chuckles)
The victims agreed to settle.

872
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:50,996
Nice. That's great, kid.

873
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:52,872
ROOM LEADER: Congrats, Jerry. Congrats.

874
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:56,042
Gosh. I'm kind of sad to leave.

875
00:54:57,544 --> 00:55:00,714
This isn't much, but please have one each.

876
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:03,300
JERRY: Thank you for everything.

877
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:04,342
INMATE 1: Thank you.

878
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:06,219
-INMATE 2: Thank you.
-JERRY: You're welcome.

879
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:09,180
Here.

880
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:10,473
(inmate sighs)

881
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:12,726
(percussive music)

882
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:16,730
Congrats.

883
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:25,697
(sighs)

884
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:28,241
Thanks for everything.

885
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:35,123
Be good. Don't cause trouble
and end up in here again.

886
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,543
I'll be good.
(scoffs)

887
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:42,505
This is the last jail I'll ever be in.

888
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:50,597
(suspenseful music)

889
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:10,575
(eerie music)

890
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:17,290
(suspenseful music)

891
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:18,875
(gulping)

892
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:26,299
TRUSTWORTHY LAW, HAPPY GUCHEON

893
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:28,551
MAN: Hey, Junsik.

894
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:30,595
I told you not to come.

895
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:33,515
MAN: You must be tired. Are you hungry?

896
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:36,184
(indistinct background chatter)

897
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:42,899
JIHOON: Give this one to Big Mouse.

898
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:48,905
Listen. I may have
stabbed people in the back,

899
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,200
but I don't commit murder.

900
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:57,122
Are you saying your muddy hands
are too clean for the sewer?

901
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:01,376
Your sister already took my money.

902
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:05,547
That money made your victims settle.

903
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,632
(tense music)

904
00:57:07,715 --> 00:57:11,469
And why would I kill Big Mouse?
I need to get my money back.

905
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:16,391
It'll just give him a stomachache.

906
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:19,644
And he'll be in a lot of pain, that's all.

907
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:22,522
-INMATE 1: What's wrong?
-INMATE 2: Hurry.

908
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:24,190
INMATE 1: What do we do?

909
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:25,775
-INMATE 3: Oh, no.
-INMATE 1: Are you okay?

910
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:29,028
-INMATE 2: What's wrong?
-INMATE 1: Go get a guard.

911
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:31,823
Guards! He's dying in here!

912
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:33,616
Please come quickly!

913
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,452
He's dying in here!

914
00:57:36,494 --> 00:57:38,079
He's dying in here!

915
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:40,707
-(groaning)
-(door opens)

916
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:44,002
(clicks tongue, sighs)

917
00:57:44,085 --> 00:57:46,129
Whatever. He said he won't die.

918
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:51,593
(tires screech)

919
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:54,888
-(gate opens)
-(siren wails)

920
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:56,222
AMBULANCE

921
00:57:56,306 --> 00:58:00,059
(siren wailing)

922
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:09,068
-Hello. Do you remember me?
-Yes, hello. Were you released?

923
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:11,446
-Boss is in that ambulance.
-What?

924
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:15,450
He suddenly had a stomachache.
We should go after him.

925
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:16,951
JERRY: We need to hurry.

926
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:18,119
What's going on?

927
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,165
WE BELIEVE IN YOUR NEW BEGINNING

928
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:23,750
(tires screeching)

929
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:27,879
(tense music)

930
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:30,381
(groaning)

931
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:43,311
Why didn't they go
straight to the hospital on the right?

932
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:45,563
MIHO'S FATHER: Maybe their ER is full.

933
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:49,317
MR. KIM, NINE HOSPITAL

934
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:53,780
Hello, Mr. Kim. This is Ko Miho.

935
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:55,865
(tense music)

936
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:58,952
I'll be there in ten minutes. Thank you.

937
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:01,704
-Catch that car.
-Stop the ambulance?

938
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:03,581
There aren't any big hospitals that way.
Hurry.

939
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:05,458
(tires screeching)

940
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:07,544
(tense music)

941
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:17,845
(siren wailing)

942
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:19,389
(tires screeching)

943
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:23,226
(groaning)

944
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:28,982
JERRY: Watch out.

945
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:31,359
(horns honking)

946
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:33,194
(tires screeching)

947
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:35,113
-In front!
-(horn honks)

948
00:59:41,202 --> 00:59:43,496
(tires screeching)

949
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,498
-(clanging)
-(siren wails)

950
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:47,667
(breathing heavily)

951
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:54,465
Are you people insane?

952
00:59:56,884 --> 00:59:58,303
-Changho.
-(sighs)

953
00:59:58,803 --> 01:00:00,388
-Miho.
-MIHO: Don't move.

954
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:02,640
You have a stomachache? Where exactly?

955
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:05,268
-(groans)
-What do you think you're doing?

956
01:00:05,351 --> 01:00:07,979
I'm his wife and a nurse.

957
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:10,273
MIHO: No need to look for a hospital
that will take him.

958
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:13,192
The hospital I used to work at is nearby
and they're waiting for him,

959
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:14,652
so we can take him there.

960
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:16,988
(tense music)

961
01:00:17,071 --> 01:00:18,281
Hurry!

962
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:19,824
(groans)

963
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:31,336
(tense music continues)

964
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:45,183
What did the doctor say? Is he okay?

965
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:48,436
He had an acute stomachache.
They're running tests now.

966
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:50,480
MIHO'S FATHER: It's strange, though.

967
01:00:50,563 --> 01:00:53,066
How could he be the only one
who got food poisoning?

968
01:00:53,858 --> 01:00:56,027
MIHO'S FATHER:
Someone must've slipped him something.

969
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:59,155
The doctor says he doesn't need surgery.

970
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:01,115
(Miho father's sighs)

971
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:03,451
I didn't get a chance to thank you yet.

972
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:04,911
What was your name again?

973
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:06,120
I'm Jer…

974
01:01:06,954 --> 01:01:08,790
I'm Oh Jinchul.

975
01:01:08,873 --> 01:01:11,417
You were released today
and you didn't even get to have tofu yet.

976
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:14,212
It's okay.
I'm just glad I saw the two of you.

977
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:18,216
Here. It's not much, but please take it.

978
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,636
No, no. I didn't do anything.
I can't accept it.

979
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:23,846
Come now. It's okay.

980
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:27,850
But… I shouldn't accept this.

981
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:29,977
You should hurry along.
You must miss your family.

982
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:33,481
It's been a while since you've been home.
Share a nice meal with them.

983
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:34,899
(Miho's father chuckles)

984
01:01:35,566 --> 01:01:38,611
Okay, then. I'll go now.

985
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:41,823
-JERRY: Okay, bye.
-MIHO'S FATHER: Bye.

986
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:48,705

-What about Ko Miho?
-She's still at the hospital.

996
01:02:36,043 --> 01:02:38,796
She's tougher than she seems,
so don't cause trouble.

997
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:41,048
Let's just get through the night.

Yes, sir.

-GUARD: You can't go in.
-Why are you being so strict?

1002
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:54,145
His family wants to see him.

1003
01:02:54,228 --> 01:02:55,813
It's against the rules.

1004
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:57,273
Seriously.

1005
01:02:58,316 --> 01:02:59,400
Open the door.

I'm here as a nurse
as per his doctor's order.

MIHO: Open the door.

1008
01:03:08,075 --> 01:03:09,827
Ten minutes is plenty, right?

1009
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:12,288
Go in. You can't stay longer than that.

1010
01:03:20,421 --> 01:03:21,464
Seriously.

but you really were by my side.

1022
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:17,436
I can only stay for ten minutes.
Let me do what I need to first.

What's wrong with me?

1024
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:30,241
They found drug substances
in your small intestines.

1025
01:04:30,616 --> 01:04:32,410
Did you eat something strange?

You said you didn't have time.
Let's just talk.

1029
01:04:53,014 --> 01:04:54,015
Do you think…

1030
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:57,935
we can live ordinary lives
like we used to?

1031
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:02,607
Watching TV, taking naps,

1032
01:05:03,608 --> 01:05:05,109
talking,

01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:08,362

Do you think we can do that again?

1036
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:24,879
My husband must be exhausted.

1037
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:31,510
I felt a wall...

1038
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:34,388
around Big Mouse.

I can ever break through.

Go home and sleep. You'll be tired.

1050
01:06:34,448 --> 01:06:35,783
I have to replace your IV later.
