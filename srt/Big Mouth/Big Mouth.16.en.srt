THIS SHOW IS A WORK OF FICTION

MODERATOR:
The 8th election to decide by popular vote

9
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:02,854
on the next person to lead Gucheon
for the next four years

10
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,898
is only one month away.

11
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:07,108
Today,
we have invited the three candidates

12
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,902
to discuss their policies and pledges

13
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:12,739
as well as
verify their talent and abilities.

14
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:20,163
Hello. I'm Candidate Number Four,
Park Changho, an independent candidate.

15
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:21,998
CHANGSUB: Hello.

16
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:25,418
I'm Candidate Number One, Lee Changsub,
for the Democratic People's Party.

17
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,421
Hello.

18
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:31,466
I'm Candidate Number Five, Choi Doha,
an independent candidate.

19
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,761
MODERATOR: Okay.
Let's start with your opening statements.

20
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:36,179
Candidate Choi, please start.

21
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:42,143
I would like to start off by apologizing
to the respectable citizens of Gucheon.

22
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,729
When I first became mayor four years ago,

23
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:49,275
I made a pledge to make Gucheon
the best city in all of Korea.

24
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,195
Unfortunately, I failed to make Gucheon
first in a few areas.

25
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,948
I decided to run for mayor again

26
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,991
in order to keep that promise.

27
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:59,160
(tense music)

28
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,124
CHANGHO: Gucheon belongs to its citizens.

29
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,793
It doesn't belong to a few authorities

30
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,962
who claim they made Gucheon
what it is today.

31
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,089
I decided to run for mayor

32
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:14,759
to fight against those people
and return Gucheon to the people.

What is that? Hey, stop them!

-My gosh!
-What is it?

56
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,742
There are gangsters outside
trying to get in!

57
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:04,369
Why would gangsters want to get in here?

00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:05,954
(glass shatters)

59
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,165

00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:45,910
What are you doing?

74
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,662
Why are you doing this? What is this?

75
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,747
Let go of me! Who are you?

76

CHANGHO:
Let me ask Candidate Choi a question.

77
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,836
You know what the NR Forum is. Right?

78
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,255
-Yes.
-CHANGHO: I'm sure you do.

79
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,673
You're one of its key members.

80
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:03,511
While you were mayor, in the process of
licensing government-ordered construction,

81
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:06,472
you gave companies in the NR Forum
a lot of preferential treatment.

82
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,682
There was no such thing.

83
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:10,601
They were chosen
through a fair bidding process.

84
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:13,980
All the companies that participated
in the bid were part of the NR Forum.

85
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,400
They agreed upon a price in advance
and won the bid in order,

86
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,528
and the city didn't restrict
or investigate it. That was fair?

87
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:24,407
I'm disappointed that you doubt
the fairness of the process.

88
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,784
However, do you know how much profit

89
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,746
the city made during my term?

90
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:33,374
All of those funds
were used for the people.

91
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:37,503
Disparaging a successful policy project
without any evidence...

92
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:40,298
The profit the city made was significant.
I acknowledge that.

93
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:42,592
But according
to the documents I received...

94
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,763
the net profit made by the companies

95
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,806
was significantly higher
than what the city...

96
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,516
-MODERATOR: You're out of time.
-Right.

97
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,143
Candidate Lee, please ask your question.

98
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,604
CHANGSUB: Right.

99
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,357
Let me ask Candidate Park Changho.

100
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,817
Gucheon came in first place
in a lot of areas.

101
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,444
But some of them we fell short.

102
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,071
Do you know what they are?

103
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,866
(tense music)

104
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,746
(clanging)

105
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,047
Who's in charge here?

106
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,764
Gosh, I'm not in charge...

107
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:32,725
(man groans)

108
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:39,399
Why are you doing this to us?

109
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,985
It wasn't my intention to go this far.

110
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,362
(bottle cap clicking)

111
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,241
Have some water and calm down.

112
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:50,701

113
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,960

115
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:04,173
Who... sent you people?

116
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,050
Nobody sent us.

117
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,845
We came to find out some things
we're curious about.

118
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,304
Then...

119
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:13,057
You could've talked it over.

120
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,393
-Why did you have to go...
-This fish farm.

121
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:19,605
What's its relationship with NK Chemical?

122
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,275
(clears throat)

123
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:26,779
Give me a thorough answer
to everything I ask you.

124
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,490
What are you talking about?

125
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,576
What kind of connection

126
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,287
does NK Chemical have with us
for you to do this?

127
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,372
(tense music)

128
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,212
MIHO: The groundwater
that they use in the fish farm...

129
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:47,592
Did someone say that water
is from a chemical plant?

130
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,596
Nobody said that.

131
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,268
So, the water is from a chemical plant?

132
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:59,187
I don't know anything about that.

133
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,064
Kill me or let me go.
Do whatever you want to me! Do it.

134
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,650
That groundwater...

135
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:09,197
Just as we call it.
It's water we get from the ground.

136
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,491
It's drinking water!

137
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,078
-(exhales)
-Then you should be fine.

138
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,372
I got that water from there.

00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:34,931
-You said it was drinking water.
-Please save me.

144
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,432
I need to go to the hospital.

(man gurgling)

146
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,403
I brought this water from home.

147
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,156
(Miho grunts)

148
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:54,951
This contains that groundwater.

00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,203
(tense music)

150
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,997
If you don't tell me truthfully

151
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:01,999
what's happening here,

152
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,126
I'll really make you drink this.

You people...

158
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,193
used wastewater in the fish farm.
Didn't you?

159
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,528
(sighs)

160

161
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,121
Yes?

162
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:41,872
YEOM: Gangsters showed up here.

163
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,500
Calm down and tell me what's going on.

164
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,752
Who brought gangsters with them?

165
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,590
A woman? Who is she?

166
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,174
YEOM: I don't know.

167
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:56,053
This woman... knows about the wastewater.

168
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:57,638
What?

169
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,600
MAYOR CHOI: Okay.
Let me ask Candidate Park a question.

170
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:03,269
You know about
the cryptocurrency fraud case. Right?

171
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:07,273
You were in charge
of the plaintiff's counsel.

172
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,485
Yes.

173
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,487
There is a suspicion
that you received money

174
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,698
from the suspect
and lost the case on purpose.

175
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,116
That's fake news.

176
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:21,245
If it's true,
will you withdraw from the election?

177
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:23,706
(exhales)

178
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,876
I don't know who spread
such false rumors, but I will find them

179
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,461
and make them face legal consequences.

180
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:29,920
MAYOR CHOI: Candidate Park.

181
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,047
If true,

182
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:34,508
will you withdraw from the election?

183
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,594
(suspenseful music)

184
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:44,060
Of course.
I will take responsibility and step down.

185
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,813
(tense music)

186
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,412
Who attacked the fish farm?

187
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,164
I'm sure it's Park Changho.

188
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:08,334
Who else would be bold enough
to do such a thing?

189
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,503
Shouldn't we tell Mayor Choi?

190
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,630
How can we do that
during a live broadcast?

191
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,548
It's not like we can do anything about it.

192
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,634
Can you get some guys right now?

193
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,553
-What?
-The guys Mayor Choi uses in an emergency.

194
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:22,515
-I just need to make a call.
-Get them ready.

195
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,392
We need to stop them
before they do anything.

196
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:27,269
Mr. Cho and I will go,
so you stay here. Okay?

197
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,479
CHAEBONG: Let's go.

198
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,315
(exhales)

199
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,401
(tense music)

200
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:34,527
(door closes)

201
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,908
The fish farm?

202
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,078
How did you find out about it?

203
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:45,955
Ms. Ko found out.

204
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,000
JERRY: Hello? Are you listening to me?

205
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:51,669
Yes.

206
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,337
So did you find anything?

207
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,922
This thing is huge.

208
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,299
If we get this out,
Choi Doha will be ruined.

209
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,385
Keep me updated on it.

210
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:01,262
And give me the sign if you need backup.

211
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:04,598
(phone beeps)

212
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,310
-Mr. Ko.
-Yes?

213
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,646
When the sinkhole accident happened,

214
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,982
weren't the drainpipes from a fish farm?

215
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,859
-Yes.
-Are you sure it's groundwater?

216
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,278
Everyone in the neighborhood
knew about it. Why?

217
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:18,946
Never mind.

218
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:21,323
How boring. Let's go inside.

219

223

has over 20 times more cancer patients
than any other city?

224
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,797
Moderator, please change the topic.

225
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,593
Candidate Park, please only ask questions
regarding policies.

226
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,887
This is regarding his policies.
Please hear me out.

227
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:46,640
The Special Substance Management Bill.

228
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:50,352
You are fighting to repeal
the Special Substance Management Bill.

229
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,979
Yes, that's correct.

230
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,439
MAYOR CHOI: If that bill gets passed,

231
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:55,858
tens of thousands
to hundreds of thousands of people

232
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,110
will end up losing their jobs.

233
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:01,322
You should come up with policies
to secure the jobs

234
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:04,200
of those people before you ask me...

235
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,534
If this bill gets passed,

236
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,078
NK Chemical will suffer the biggest loss.

237
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:13,083
You are a major shareholder
with 36 percent shares in the company.

-MODERATOR: Candidate Park.
-I still have time left.

CHANGHO: Are you aware that there
are 20 times more cancer patients here?

241
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:28,641
What do you think about the claims
that NK Chemical is the cause?

242
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,935
(tense music)

243
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,687
You're free to think what you want,

244
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,440
but when you slander someone,
it becomes a crime.

245
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:41,028
I'm sure you're aware of this
since you practice law.

246
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,322
Up until now, NK Chemical

247
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,201
has made profound contributions
in the development of Gucheon.

248
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:48,577
Yes, I'm aware.

249
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,997
It's all thanks
to an innovative new substance called NF9.

(ominous music)

251
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,336
CHANGHO:
I don't deny that with the use of NF9,

252
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:00,130
semiconductors, cars,
and various electronic devices

253
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,842
have made rapid development.

254
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,135
However, there was someone who claimed

255
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:08,055
large doses of radiation were discharged
in the refinement process of NF9.

it says that the first developer
of NF9, Cho Haesoo, committed suicide.

260
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,073
Up until his death, Cho Haesoo made claims

of the danger
of radiation discharge from NF9.

Yes.

How do they pay you?

284
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:55,704
Through a trade company in Hong Kong.

285
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,083
And that company
is obviously a paper company.

Yes.

287
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:06,006
Go through this fish farm
and load up everything

288

No. Let's go to the TV station.

-The TV station?
-They're doing a live broadcast.

00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:46,005
Why?
Are you going to reveal everything there?

Hey. You should go first.

302
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,265
I'll stop them.

303
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,517
Hurry up and go! Go.

304
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,810
Hey. Stop them.

Hey. Go after them!

It's Ko Miho. I saw her myself.

314
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,395
They already went through the fish farm.

315
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,355
What?

316
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:50,486
I think they're going to the TV station.

317
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,113
You have to stop them.
Those are bombs they're bringing.

(panting)

319
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,325
I'll call the police.

320
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,535
But will it be okay?

321
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,872
If those documents get out,
we're totally screwed.

322
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,332
I have connections with the police.

323
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:06,168

Did you get the video?

331
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,060
This video...

332
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:25,896
Choi Doha's people have been
illegally dumping wastewater.

333
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,066
(sighs)

334
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:32,194
I want to reveal this on the live show.
Is there a way to do that?

335
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,737
SOONTAE: Will you do it yourself?

336
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,989
I'm confident I can land a big blow.

337
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,117
Come as a citizen representative.

338
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,619
Aren't all the spots filled?

339
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,454
I can make a spot.

340
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,580
I'll do that.

341
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:46,208
(pensive music)

342
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,836
We're being followed
by Choi Doha's minions.

343
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,587
Can you get rid of them?

344
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,297
Okay. I'll take care of it.

345
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:54,967
(phone beeps)

346
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,971

(line dialing)

349
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,354
Hello, Chief. It's been a while.

350
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,691
(scoffs)
Yes.

351
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,819
I have a favor to ask you.

352
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,155
I need you to do something for me.

353
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,491
Yes.

354
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,911
(indistinct radio chatter)

355
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,539
INSPECTION, PLEASE COOPERATE

356
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,624
(tense music)

357
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,170
The car is coming.

358
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,800
(siren wailing)

359
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,222
(siren wailing)

360
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,065
-(wailing stops)
-(music stops)

361
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:54,776
(tense music)

362
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,033
They've already been dispatched.

363
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,452
Goodness. They're incredibly fast.

364
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,289
My gosh. I can relax now.

365
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:10,083
(laughing)

366
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,004
-(music fades)
-(window whirring)

367
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,424
I'll escort you. Follow me.

368
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:19,509
(upbeat music)

369
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:21,345
(siren wailing)

370
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:22,930
You can relax until we get there.

371
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,986
POLICE, INSPECTION

372

(Chaebong mutters)

375
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:54,544
What...

376
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,468
(music intensifies)

377
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,808
(gasps)

378
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:11,061
What's going on? Darn it.

379
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,939
(upbeat music)

380
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:16,566
Hey! Move the cars!

381
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,485
Okay. Good job.

382
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:24,658
OFFICER: You don't need to worry.

383
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,539

384
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:36,712

DAD

00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,428
(phone vibrating)

388
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:45,846
DAD

389
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,517
Hey, Dad.

390
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,270
Hi, daughter.
I thought you said you were coming.

391
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:55,856
I'm on my way.

392
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:57,274
KIKWANG: Did you watch the debate?

393
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,986
Changho's doing a great job.

394
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,612
KIKWANG: His opponents are good too,

395
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:05,240
but he's doing better than I expected.

396
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,117
(Kikwang laughs)

397
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:09,828
Dad.

398
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:11,913
(somber music)

399
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:14,499
I'm really happy right now.

400
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,626
KIKWANG: So you saw him?

401
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:20,130
Changho looks really good on TV too.

402
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,757
KIKWANG: My son-in-law's so handsome.

403
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,633
(laughs)

404
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,557
Remember this.

405
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,184
Your daughter...

406
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,103
is incredibly happy right now.

407
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,481
Okay.

408
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:40,817
I'm so happy to hear that you're happy.

409
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,611
(Kikwang laughs)

410
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,446
I'll be there soon.

411
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,783
KIKWANG: Okay. Get here safely.

412
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:49,993
Okay.

413
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:52,496
(sniffles)

414
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:55,832
(phone clicks)

415
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,093
(laughs)

416
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,886
What did Miho say to make you laugh?

417
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:10,555
Gosh. She said she's happy.

418
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,182
She never says those things.

419
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:13,767
(Kikwang laughs)

420
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,019
My goodness.

421
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:19,689
(ominous music)

422
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:29,116
STAFF

423
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:32,244
Hey, that's...

424
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:36,123
KIKWANG: Those people...
Isn't that the cryptocurrency scam artist?

425
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:38,458
He's on the citizen representative panel?

426
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,460
That's cheating.

427
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:43,296
Choi Doha had a card up his sleeves.

428
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,882
We can't let this be.
We have to protest and get him out.

429
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:46,967
Mr. Ko.

430
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:50,303
-Let him be.
-Hey. What if he says something stupid?

431
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:53,348
Then the debate will be over.
That's what they're after.

432
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:56,101
We have a card up our sleeves too.

433
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,521
-Sir.
-Do what I say.

434
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:03,442
What if we get disciplinary action
for allowing a candidate's wife to go up?

435
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:06,278
I'll take that punishment. Okay?

436
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,242
(suspenseful music)

437
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:19,541
LIBC DOES ITS BEST IN BROADCASTING
TO EARN THE TRUST OF THE PEOPLE

438
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,297
What happened?

439
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:27,841
She can go on.

440
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:32,053
(tense music)

441
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:40,854
(keypad clacking)

442
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,481
(phone vibrates)

443
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:44,733
ATTORNEY KIM SOONTAE

444
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:48,278
When Ms. Ko Miho speaks, play that video.

445
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:50,155
Okay.

446
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,825
(music intensifies)

447
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:56,870
MODERATOR:
This is the last corner of this debate.

448
00:24:56,953 --> 00:25:01,291
We'll have the citizens
question the candidates themselves.

449
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:03,043
Who will go first?

450
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:05,629
Right. Go ahead.

451
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:07,422
(mic echoes)

452
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,801
I'm Min Byungnam,
a small business owner in Gucheon.

453
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:16,139
Candidate Park. Do you remember me?

454
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,099
(sighs)

455
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,560
I'm not sure.
I'm sorry, but I don't remember...

456
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,604
Right. I'm sure you wouldn't.

457
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:25,815
Do you remember the five billion won
you got from me?

458
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:30,570
-WOMAN: What is he saying?
-MAN: He got money from him?

459
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:32,280
WOMAN: That's a lot of money.

460
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,324
I'm not a good person.

461
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,537
I'm currently under investigation
for running a cryptocurrency scam.

462
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,248
I can get punished for my crimes,

463
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:45,085
but someone who will govern our city
should be different.

464
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:50,090
BYUNGNAM: That's why I came here today.

465
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:54,427
I want to tell the people
who Park Changho really is.

466
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:57,514
I didn't expect Choi Doha
to use him like that.

467
00:25:58,723 --> 00:25:59,891
(Jihoon exhales heavily)

468
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,185
He put up a good fight.

469
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:07,148
Will Park Changho go down like this?

470
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:09,985
Did you say your name was Min Byungnam?

471
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,571
Who gave you orders
to make false claims here?

472
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,867
In this notebook,

473
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:20,328
I have the serial numbers of 10,000
50,000-won bills.

474
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:26,042
That would be 500 million won
out of the five billion I gave you.

475
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,628
(exhales sharply)

476
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:31,381
If you compare it to the five billion won

477
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:33,133
the police seized from your office,

478
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:35,552
it will prove who's lying right now.

479
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:39,014
Zoom into Park Changho.

480
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:44,436
Big Mouse revealed
that the five billion won was his money.

481
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,979
(scoffs)

482
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:48,315
BYUNGNAM: You're Big Mouse's attorney.

483
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:52,319
Isn't that a story
that's easy to agree on?

484
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:56,031
(tense music)

485
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:06,374
Hey, Miho.

486
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,834
-Dad.
-Ms. Ko Miho?

487
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,544
(Miho panting)

488
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,840
What's this about you being a hidden card?

489
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:15,842
An election...

490
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,845
is more about creating rapport
with the people

491
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:21,097
than it is competition among candidates.

492
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:26,978
You said you'd withdraw if the suspicions
about the cryptocurrency scam were true.

493
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,482
I believe this opportunity...

494
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,360
(suspenseful music)

495
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:39,824
I believe this opportunity...

496
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:46,373
is the last chance for Candidate Park

497
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,583
to fulfill his duty to the people.

498
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:52,212
Please withdraw from the election,
Candidate Park.

499
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:57,801
The truth will be revealed,

500
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:01,262
and the decision will be made
by the people.

501
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:03,390
(sighs)

502
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:06,976
MODERATOR: Let's bring up
the next citizen. Who will it be?

503
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:08,520
My name is Ko Miho.

504
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,190
(music fades)

505
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:18,822
I'd like to ask Candidate Choi a question.

506
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:21,116
Sir. That woman is Candidate Park's wife.

507
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,368
Please revoke her right
to participate in the panel.

508
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:25,870
Candidate Park. Is she your wife?

509
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:28,373
I'm not here as Mr. Park Changho's wife,

510
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,543
but as a victim of the radiation

511
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,087
leaked by NK Chemical.

512
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,048
(pensive music)

513
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:39,426
KIKWANG: What is she saying?

514
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:41,594
What do you mean Miho...

515
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:43,847
was exposed to radiation?

516
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:50,311
I haven't told my husband this yet either.

517
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,400
On January 12,

518
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:59,070
an underground drainpipe exploded
due to a sinkhole accident...

519
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,280
(sprinkler pouring)

520
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:01,698
...and there...

521
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:04,701
I was exposed to radiation there.

522
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:10,832
Currently...

523
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,252
(dramatic music)

524
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:19,007
...I've been diagnosed as terminally ill
with acute stage-four lymphoma.

525
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,842
(crowd exclaim)

526
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:26,097
(chuckles)

527
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:28,183
(crowd murmuring)

528
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,357
(inaudible)

529
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,745
(sniffles)

530
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,543
MODERATOR: Ms. Ko Miho. I'm sorry,

531
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:58,129
but this isn't a place to discuss
your personal situation.

532
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,423
(sniffles)

533
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,385
I have also prepared a video.

534
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:09,015
Please play the video.

535
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,350
(music stops)

536
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,060
The groundwater...

537
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,770
NK CHEMICAL ILLEGALLY DUMPS
WASTEWATER INTO FISH FARM

538
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:16,105
...is wastewater

539
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,233
from the chemical plant.

540
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:22,278
The refinement process of NF9
generates wastewater,

541
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:27,075
and a large dose of radiation
is mixed in with it.

542
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,160
(ominous music)

543
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:37,627
MAN: The fish farm was made as a facade
to dispose large amounts of wastewater

544
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,295
into the ocean.

545
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:43,967
We don't distribute the fish
and dispose all of them.

546
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,761
MIHO: NK Chemical must pay you
to get rid of the water.

547
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,263
MAN: Yes.

548
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,806
MIHO: How do they pay you?

549
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:52,183
MAN: Through a trade company in Hong Kong.

550
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,478
MIHO: And that company
is obviously a paper company.

551
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:57,272
MAN: Yes.

552
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,359
(suspenseful music)

553
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,321
(exhales sharply)

554
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:09,742
NK CHEMICAL'S WASTEWATER
CONTAINS RADIATION...

555
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:12,453
MIHO: NF9 was developed in 1992.

556
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:15,039
For the past 30 years, NK Chemical

557
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,459
has been illegally dumping
wastewater with radiation into the ocean.

558
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:22,297
As a result, tens of thousands of citizens

559
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,383
have died or suffered from cancer.

560
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,512
Candidate Choi, isn't this the reason
why you want to repeal

561
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,639
the Special Substance Management Bill?

562
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,434
(exhales sharply)

563
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:35,602
(exhales)

564
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,278
Zoom into Choi Doha.

565
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:51,159
I'd like to make a suggestion.

566
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,453
If the contents of that video are true,

567
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:57,790
I request that the prosecution
investigate this case without sanctuary.

568
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:02,086
MIHO: Choi Doha,
you are behind every case of corruption.

569
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,465
It'll be revealed soon.

570
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:07,550
(tense music)

571
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:10,595
(mic thuds)

572
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,935
(music intensifies)

573
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,278
ON AIR

574
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:29,238
(music fades)

575
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,783
(pensive music)

576
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:32,867
(door closes)

577
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,202
(exhales)

578
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,747
What on earth were you doing

579
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:40,041
while Ko Miho was making that?

580
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:43,836
(phone vibrating)

581
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,048
Hey, Juhee.

582
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:53,346
(sighs)
Don't worry. I can take care of it.

583
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:01,104
Go on in. I'm sorry.

584
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,024
-REPORTER 1: He's coming out.
-REPORTER 2: There he is.

585
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,276
REPORTER 3: Where's Ms. Ko Miho?

586
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,695
Is it true that your wife

587
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:11,531
is preparing a class action lawsuit
with the victims of radiation?

588
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,574
REPORTER 4: Are you sure the wastewater
is from NK Chemical?

589
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:16,035
Do you think this
will help your ratings go up?

590
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,496
-Please give us a statement.
-(reporters clamoring)

591
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,627
OPERATOR: The phone is turned off...

592
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,254
SOONTAE: Is Miho not answering?

593
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,381
Ms. Ko turned off her phone
because of the reporters.

594
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,091
Where is she?

595
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,760
She asked me to bring you to her,
so we're headed there now.

596
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,012
(exhales)

WE WILL JOIN YOU!

LAW OFFICE OF PARK CHANGHO

00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,121

00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:18,056
ATTORNEY AT LAW, PARK CHANGHO

601
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,527
(running footsteps approaching)

602
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:32,737
ATTORNEY AT LAW, PARK CHANGHO

603
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,240
(panting)

604
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,326
(music fades)

605
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:42,997
(breathing heavily)

606
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:47,585
MIHO: This place still has
a lot of traces of our past.

607
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:53,382
We may have been poor,
but we were really happy. Right?

608
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:55,468
(solemn music)

609
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,314
(exhales)

610
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:13,277
I guess I really love Park Changho.

611
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,784
I'm more worried...

612
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:26,457
about how you'll live without me
than about me dying.

613
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:33,589
(music rises)

614
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:40,012
That's why I have a lot of regrets...

615
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,765
for not caring about you more.

616
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:54,777
(sobs)

617
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:58,823
But we still have a lot of time
to love each other.

618
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,160
So...

619
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:05,830
let's be happy
for the rest of our time together.

620
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:08,833
Okay?

621
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,594
Aren't you going to answer me?

622
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,972
(dramatic music)

623
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,981
(sobs softly)

624
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:35,610
I haven't done anything for you
after clearing my name.

625
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:41,949
(sobs)

626
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:44,243
I'll do whatever I can.

627
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:46,454
Anything I can, Miho.

628
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,050
(music rises)

629
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:02,303
(sobs)
I'm sorry.

630
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:05,765
I'm sorry.

631
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:24,033

-MAN: Investigate NK Chemical!
-ALL: Investigate!

REPORTER: Candidate for Gucheon Mayor
Choi Doha and his wife Hyun Juhee

640
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,869
appeared at the prosecution
for investigation.

641
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:12,873
The prosecution will focus
their investigation

642
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:15,543
on the various suspicions
regarding NK Chemical

643
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,628
and their connection
to Choi Doha and Hyun Juhee.

-(music stops)
-(door closes)

647
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,184
I never thought this day would come.

648
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:35,771
(exhales noisily)

649
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:39,734
I'm not jolly about this either.

650
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:42,194
PROSECUTOR:
This investigation is inevitable,

651
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,363
so let's not waste time playing games.

652
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:46,490
Okay?

653
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,744
Are you listening to me?

654
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:53,122
Who's here?

655
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:54,206
What?

656
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,458
Park Changho?

657
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:56,584
Gong Jihoon?

658
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:00,504
(smirks)

659
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:01,756
Or both?

660
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:09,638
(suspenseful music)

661
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:16,312
Go ahead.

662
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:20,775
See if you can get any of it proven.

663
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,072
MAYOR CHOI: The sun will rise tomorrow.

664
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:29,909
When it sets, it'll get dark,
and nothing will change.

665
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:33,496
I will be reelected as mayor,

666
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,831
and you guys will continue...

667
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:37,708
(chuckles)

668
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,460
...to act up saying it's unfair.

669
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,379
(snickers)

670
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:46,967
(tense music)

671
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:50,888
JIHOON: That son of a...

672
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,432
I ought to just...

673
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,811
Did you find Chairman Kang's son?

674
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,312
(exhales)

675
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,397
Not yet.

676
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,482
Let Hyun Juhee go after brief questioning.

677
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:06,028
We have to tighten the screws on her.
We had a hard time getting her here.

678
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:08,197
They're going to blame everything
on Chairman Kang.

679
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:11,492
If we want to tighten the screws,
we need a new trap.

680
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,495
(music intensifies)

681
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,673
(music fades)

682
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,091
CHANGHO: Ms. Hyun Juhee.

683
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:33,347
I thought Chairman Kang was cremated,
but he was buried instead.

684
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:38,352
Gong Jihoon's exhuming the body
for an autopsy tomorrow.

685
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:40,354
To prove his murder.

686
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,480
(scoffs)

687
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,233
What right does Gong Jihoon have?

688
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:46,735
I heard Chairman Kang has a son.

689
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:48,404
He got a call from him.

690
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:51,407
Why are you telling me that?

691
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:54,785
If Choi Doha finds out,
he'll do everything he can to stop it.

692
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,287
Please stop it already.

693
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:58,372
Stop suspecting my husband.

694
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:01,125
JUHEE: He didn't do anything wrong.

695
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,503
It's all Chairman Kang and my fault.

696
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:09,592
I'll take the punishment for it.

697
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:15,890
(pensive music)

698
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:19,185
How will you pay for your sins?

699
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,396
Divine punishment isn't enough.

700
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,191
Don't apologize.

701
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:26,692
You won't be forgiven.

702
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,169
(pensive music)

703
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:48,797
Did you hear?

704
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,300
Tomorrow, Gong Jihoon's...

705
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,637
getting Chairman Kang's body autopsied.

706
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,768
I need to tell Mayor Choi,

707
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:03,354
but there's no way
since he's being investigated.

708
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:08,484
Did you know?

709
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:10,736
(ominous music)

710
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:14,573
How could I not?

711
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:17,701
Mayor Choi and I are one.

712
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:21,455
Don't worry, ma'am. I'll take care of it.

713
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:24,333
(phone clicks)

714
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:25,459
(beeps)

715
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,672
ASSOCIATE: Mr. Cha. Mr. Gong
is getting Chairman Kang autopsied.

716
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:32,841
I'll let Mayor Choi know.

717
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:40,975
REPORTER: He was investigated intensely
for 72 hours,

718
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:45,771
but the prosecution failed to arrest
and charge Candidate Choi Doha.

719
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:47,773
-Good job enduring this.
-Thanks.

720
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:49,692
-DOOGEUN: Right.
-Good job.

721
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:51,986
As the leading candidate for mayor

722
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:55,614
and as a single shareholder myself,

723
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:59,034
I will conduct a thorough investigation
of the crimes

724
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:02,413
that the management
of NK Chemical committed.

725
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:04,456
I sincerely apologize

726
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:09,044
to the citizens of Gucheon
for worrying them.

727
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,879
(camera shutters clicking)

728
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:12,089
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

729
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:14,049
REPORTER:
The court has taken into consideration

730
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,926
that the mayoral election is in two days

731
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,303
and decided to postpone

732
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:20,014
Choi Doha's first trial
to after the elections.

733
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:23,017
According to the last count
that LIBC has conducted,

734
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,728
Candidate Choi Doha
is leading with 45.4 percent,

735
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:29,106
which exceeds the error range
between runner-up, Candidate Park Changho.

736
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:30,774
I'm sure we've surpassed him since then.

737
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:32,776
That's common sense.

738
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,862
Choi Doha's corruption came out.

739
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:38,073
For the next two days,
let's use up every last bit of our energy.

740
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:39,783
A NEW WAVE OF CHANGE, PARK CHANGHO

741
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,869

BALLOT BOX

744
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:59,136
REPORTER 1:
We have 99.9 percent of the votes counted.

745
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:03,766
Independent candidate Park Changho
has 279,771 votes.

746
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:08,687
REPORTER 2: Independent candidate
Choi Doha has 287,652 votes.

747
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,439
With a difference of 7,881 votes,

748
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:12,316
Candidate Choi Doha
has been elected mayor.

749
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:15,194
(cheering)

750
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:18,530
REPORTER 2: We hear cheers coming
from Candidate Choi's campaign office.

751
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:22,618
REPORTER 1: As a result, the newly elected
mayor chosen to lead Gucheon in 2022

752
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:25,079
is Candidate Choi Doha.

753
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:29,124
We're excited to see
Gucheon's bright future with a new mayor.

754
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,502
Once again, congratulations on your win.

(suspenseful music)

756
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:39,677
CHOI DOHA
FOR THE FUTURE, RELIABLE MAYOR

757
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:42,554
-MAN: Finally!
-ALL (chanting): Choi Doha!

JERRY:
Ms. Ko put these in our refrigerator.

765
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:08,288
I bought these to celebrate,
but it's going to comfort us instead.

766
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:12,668
Let's have a refreshing drink
and shake it all off.

767
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:14,628
-(can tab clicks)
-All right.

768
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:17,423
(slurps)

769
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:19,007
(exhales)
This is great.

770
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:20,259
Miho, you're on medication...

771
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:22,177
This is the best medicine
for a day like today.

772
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:23,512
Miho, if you keep this up...

773
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:25,806
My gosh. Come on.

774
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:26,890
Cheers.

775
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:31,603
MIHO: What are you doing? Let's drink.

776
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:35,065
She's right. If we don't drink
on a day like today, when will we drink?

777
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,359
KIKWANG:
You all worked hard. Have a drink.

00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,117

(Miho grunts)

784
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:52,416
If Choi Doha gets imprisoned
after the trial,

785
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:53,792
he can't be mayor.

786
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:56,754
That's right. There's still the trial.
We don't know what'll happen.

787
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:58,505
What do you mean we don't know?

788
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,924
Look at how people voted
for such a bad guy.

789
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:02,259
How can you trust the law?

790
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:03,844

DELIVERY MAN:
Ms. Ko Miho. You have a delivery.

00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,265
JERRY: Right.

793
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:10,350

00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:11,435
JERRY: Thank you.

795
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:14,646
It doesn't say who sent it.

796
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:16,565
Open it.

797
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:17,691
KIKWANG: Hold on.

798
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:21,653
What if it's something like a bomb?

799
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,452
Ms. Ko.

JUHEE: It's me, Hyun Juhee.

804
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:40,297
This is the burner phone my husband uses.

805
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:43,300
It'll be an important piece of evidence
in the trial.

806
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:48,430
This is Choi Doha's burner phone.
Hyun Juhee sent it.

807
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:51,934
Why would she send this to us?

808
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:53,519
Are you sure she isn't conning us?

809
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:56,980
It's Choi Doha's phone.

810
00:46:58,315 --> 00:46:59,566
How do you know?

811
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:02,820
(suspenseful music)

812
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:05,614
MAYOR CHOI: I saw how great
the citizens of Gucheon are...

813
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:07,157
(camera shutters clicking)

814
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:09,243
...through this election.

815
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:12,037
Thanks to your wisdom and courage,

816
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:14,790
I was able to beat the people
who tried to slander me

817
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,125
and be elected mayor.

818
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:19,628
MAYOR CHOI: I will return to my roots.

819
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:24,007
I will repay your trust with results!

820

-ALL (chants): He will repay you!

Choi Doha Choi Doha!

824
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:36,436
Yes?

825
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,938
Can you speak on the phone?

826
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:40,774
Go ahead.

827
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:45,237
I need a testimony saying
this burner phone belongs to Choi Doha.

828
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,698
Can you do it?

829
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:50,117
MAYOR CHOI:
I will prove why I was elected.

830
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,619
I will step up to the challenge
you have given me...

831
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:55,956
Hello? Ms. Hyun?

832
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:58,292
MAYOR CHOI: I will do my best as mayor.

833
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:01,461
With your ardent support and help...

834
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:02,588
I'll testify.

835
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:05,966
MAYOR CHOI: I would like to express
my sincere gratitude once again.

836
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:10,095
Thank you, everyone.

(Kikwang sighs)

844
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:31,199
She was always able to hold her liquor,

845
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,619
but now she's out with a can of beer.

Yes.

I'll bring you your medicine.

Just stay here.

852
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:27,506
I thought about...

853
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:30,425
my last moments.

854
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:40,852
Let's go with me falling asleep

(solemn music)

856
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:53,240
Why would you say that?
What do you mean your last moments?

857
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:57,285
Why? You don't like that?

858
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:00,288
Then I'll ask my dad to do it.

I don't want to.

Why would I do it instead of your husband?

863
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:11,299
Give this to her. It'll help her sober up.

The prosecutor claims that burner phone
belongs to me,

892
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:06,975
but do you have proof?

893
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:09,728
Your Honor.

894
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:13,064
PROSECUTOR: The witness to testify that
the burner phone belongs to the defendant

895
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:14,733
hasn't arrived yet.

896
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:16,234
I ask that you postpone the trial.

897
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:20,322
Your Honor. The defense would like to call
Mr. Cha Daehwan to the stand.

898
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:21,907
PROSECUTOR: We didn't consent to this.

899
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:24,576
He's an important witness
to prove who the owner

900
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:26,286
of that burner phone is.

901
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:28,371
(suspenseful music)

902
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:40,634
This burner phone belongs to me.

903
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:47,891
Chairman Kang Sunggeun
used to use this before me,

904
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:50,769
but after he passed away,
I have been using it.

905
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:52,187
Can you prove that?

906
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:57,984
EVIDENCE 1

907
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:01,404
The last time I used this phone
was on the 16th.

908
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:05,116
CHA: The number was 010-0936-1327.

909
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:08,245
The person I called...

910
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,997
is in this courtroom.

911
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:13,166
(thrilling music)

912
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,422

(phone vibrating)

916
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:31,810
If that burner phone is mine,

917
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:35,897
that would mean that I called myself.

918
00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:40,735
CHA: I remember the text messages
we sent to each other through this phone.

919
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:44,155
If you want,
I will reveal its contents here.

926
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:21,526
There's something I need you to do for me.

927
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:23,653
Tell me what it is.

928
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:28,950
Let us take a recess.

929
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:31,870
(tense music)

930
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:47,510
You got this.

(mutters)

932
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:05,195
I think Hyun Juhee stabbed us in the back.

JUDGE: I will announce the verdict.

940
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:48,905
This bench pronounces the defendant,
Choi Doha,

941
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:51,991
not guilty based on lack of evidence.

942
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:54,077
-MAN 1: Yes!
-MAN 2: Yes!

943
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,246
-Yes!
-MAN 3: That's right!

944
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:58,581
(crowd clamoring)

945
00:56:58,665 --> 00:56:59,958
MAN 4: Choi Doha, you bastard!

946
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:06,840
-Yes!
-CHAEBONG: Mayor Choi. See?

947
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:09,426
(indistinct shouting, cheering)

00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:34,993
(music stops)

950
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:36,619
What about Hyun Juhee?

951
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:38,997
I looked everywhere,
but couldn't find her. Phone's off too.

952
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:41,958
Something must've happened to her.

953
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:44,043
(ominous music)

954
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:47,922
Where's Juhee?

955
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:49,966
Why are you looking for my wife?

956
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:52,552
If Juhee's missing like Hyejin,

957
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:54,637
I won't let you people go.

958
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:57,015
I don't think
that's something you should say.

959
00:57:57,932 --> 00:57:59,058
Stay healthy.

960
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:04,230
She's the woman I love,
so I'll be the one to protect her.

961
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:07,734
(music rises)

KIKWANG: Carry her.

965
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:23,458
Hurry. Let's go to the hospital!

966
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:24,584
Miho.

967
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:28,129
(heart monitor beeping)

968
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:49,359
Changho.

969

(mutters)

970
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:55,657
CHANGHO: Are you up?

971
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:02,413
MIHO: In the past,
I used to be surprised by you.

972
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:05,875
But these days, I've been surprising you.

973
00:59:07,752 --> 00:59:09,212
I know.

974
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:15,760
Don't overdo it and get some rest.

975
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:19,180
(heart monitor beeping)

976

(heart monitor beeping)

979
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:34,237
I'm tired.

980
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,531
I want to go to sleep.

981
00:59:42,036 --> 00:59:44,038
(solemn music)

982

(chuckles)

983
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,590
Let's go to sleep. We can talk tomorrow.

984
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:55,883
CHANGHO: Let's talk tomorrow, Miho.

985
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:02,432
(solemn music)

986
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:14,569
I love you, Changho.

987
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:24,871
(chuckles)

988
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:27,123
Me too.

989
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:30,001
I love you too, Miho.

990
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:38,843
(dramatic music)

991
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:17,882
(heart monitor flatlines)

992
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:25,640
(dramatic music)

993
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:43,157
I'm sorry.

994
01:01:47,578 --> 01:01:48,955
I was happy.

995
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:56,713
I was so happy, Miho.

996
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:03,386
(music rises)

997
01:02:19,652 --> 01:02:20,987
(music fades)

998
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:23,281
(heart monitor flatline)

999
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:30,747
(water rippling)

1000
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:42,967
(muffled background noise)

1001
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:53,936
(door opens)

1002
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:03,863
(Changho scoffs)

1003
01:03:28,095 --> 01:03:29,514
MAYOR CHOI: What are you doing here?

1004
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:34,060
I bought this building in a rush.

1005
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:36,103
(laughs, mutters)

1006
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:37,897
You're the landlord?

1007
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:44,237
(Mayor Choi grunts)

1008
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,072
I guess Big Mouse
gives you a lot of money.

1009
01:03:48,032 --> 01:03:49,283
I'm Big Mouse.

1010
01:03:52,286 --> 01:03:54,288
(suspenseful music)

1011
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:56,207
Congratulations.

1012
01:03:57,416 --> 01:03:59,377
But even if you are Big Mouse,

1013
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:00,878
you're no match for me.

1014
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:03,548
Money? Power?

1015
01:04:04,465 --> 01:04:06,259
What will you beat me with?

1016
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:08,928
You coward.

1017
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:10,012
(scoffs)

1018
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:11,097
What?

1019
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:13,599
You're afraid you'll get stepped on
like your grandfather,

1020
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:16,269
so you did anything you could
and turned into a monster.

1021
01:04:16,811 --> 01:04:18,312
Stepping on others on the way.

1022
01:04:19,772 --> 01:04:20,815
You're right.

1023
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:24,610
I am a coward. I was a coward.

1024
01:04:25,903 --> 01:04:27,572
But now, I've won.

1025
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:29,657
MAYOR CHOI: I have everything.

1026
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:33,077
Didn't you see?
You couldn't even stop me using the law.

1027
01:04:34,078 --> 01:04:36,205
What about the people who died in pain?

1028
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:39,709
Have you ever thought
about the pain they endured?

1029
01:04:40,668 --> 01:04:41,878
(sighs)

1030
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:43,129
I'm sick of this now.

1031
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:46,507
MAYOR CHOI:
Do I have to worry about that too?

1032
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:48,009
They're all losers.

1033
01:04:48,092 --> 01:04:50,094
(pensive music)

1034
01:04:50,177 --> 01:04:51,178
(sighs)

1035
01:04:53,472 --> 01:04:54,599
Thank you.

1036
01:04:55,182 --> 01:04:56,392
What?

1037
01:04:58,102 --> 01:04:59,854
I felt like I was committing a sin.

1038
01:04:59,937 --> 01:05:01,939
(suspenseful music)

1039
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:04,817
I won't think about your pain anymore.

1040
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:08,487
I'll just consider it
cleaning up the trash.

1041
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:09,614
(laughs)

1042
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:12,783
(music intensifies)

1043
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:13,951
(music stops)

1044
01:05:14,702 --> 01:05:18,080
(coughing)

1045
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:23,836
(gurgles)

1046
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,922
(eerie music)

1047
01:05:27,673 --> 01:05:28,674
What is this?

1048
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:36,641
CHANGHO: Lots of people died because of
that radiation-contaminated wastewater.

1049
01:05:37,808 --> 01:05:39,477
You should suffer in the same way.

1050
01:05:45,566 --> 01:05:47,568
(dramatic music)

1051
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:02,083
Do you know why laws were made?

1052
01:06:02,917 --> 01:06:05,586
They were afraid of people
killing one another.

1053
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:09,340
The law was made to save people.

1054
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:11,801
But you don't need the law.

1055
01:06:14,595 --> 01:06:15,680
(exhales)

1056
01:06:16,263 --> 01:06:17,306
Goodbye.

1057
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:24,981
(ominous music)

1058
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:29,110
(music stops)

1059
01:06:29,193 --> 01:06:30,695

01:06:47,795 --> 01:06:49,797

REPORTER 3:
Dr. Hyun Juhee of Gucheon Hospital

1068
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:16,449
has testified that Professor Seo's paper

1069
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:18,826
proves the correlation between NF9

1070
01:07:18,909 --> 01:07:21,954
and cancer patients in Gucheon
over the past 30 years.

1071
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:25,916
REPORTER 4: The defendants
in Seo Jaeyoung's murder case

1072
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,587
received ten years each, a sentence
stronger than their original sentences.

1073
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:31,130
INMATES: You bastards!

1074

has been appointed as president
of the Woojeong Group.

1078
01:07:43,392 --> 01:07:45,895
President Gong Jihoon, hurray!

1079
01:07:45,978 --> 01:07:47,605
ALL: Hurray!

1080

homes, and relief organizations in Gucheon

1081
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:54,445
received a huge anonymous donation,
which caused quite a stir.

1082

(children cheering)

1083
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:58,991

FOR YOUR HEALTH

CHANGHO: A good Big Mouse?

1089
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:57,383
MIHO: Someone who punishes scumbags
who hurt powerless people

1090
01:08:58,092 --> 01:09:00,219
just to better their own lives.

1091
01:09:03,597 --> 01:09:05,850
A kind and righteous Big Mouse.

1092
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:18,154
(tense music)

1093
