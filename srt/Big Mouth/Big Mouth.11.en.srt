THIS SHOW IS A WORK OF FICTION

(heart monitor beeping)

11
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,712
We're from the Traffic Division.

12
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,340
A witness reported she was intoxicated.

13
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,926
What? That's nonsense.

14
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,969
JIHOON:
She was treating patients until she left.

15
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,805
Where could she have gotten drunk?

16
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,723
Did she drink while driving?

17
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,391
OFFICER: We're just following protocol...

18
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:43,269
You should check the car
for defects first.

19
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,897
I saw a lot of those accidents
caused by sudden acceleration.

20
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:51,194
Whatever it was,
please uncover the cause of the accident.

21
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:59,202
JIHOON: Thank goodness
she wasn't seriously injured.

22
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,870
You should count yourself lucky.

23
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,163
What are you doing here?

24
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,666
Don't be like that.
You're hurting my feelings.

25
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:07,252
Of course I would come
hearing that Dr. Hyun was in an accident.

26
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,922
Thanks for your concern.

32
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,427
They do.

33
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,513
Talk to me.

34
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,227
(phone beeps)

35
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,688
You were right.

36
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:11,774
You startled me.

37
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,194

LEE BYUNGKWAN - BUREAU CHIEF

00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:18,948
(line ringing)

40
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:23,286
They'll find drugs in Hyun Juhee's blood.
Report it exclusively.

41
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:27,916
Be just about a half step
ahead of the other papers.

42
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,585
That's up to you.

43
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,795
Blow a horn, beat a drum.

44
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,964
Make as much noise as you can.

45
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,257
You get me, right?

46
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,220
-(phone beeps)
-How'd you know she was drugged?

47
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:42,513
Instincts.

48
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:47,644
It's similar to what Mayor Choi did
to Park Changho.

49
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:53,107
Big Mouse must be somewhere close
to Park Changho.

50
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,276
That means his retaliation has begun.

51
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,862
You planned quite extensively this time.

52
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:03,117
We just need to watch and wait.

53
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,995
And we can get the stork and the clam

54
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:08,373
all at once.

55
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:10,458
Got it?

56
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,584

CHUNSIK: Hey. Where's Big Mouse?

74
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,909
He left early for a meeting
with the new warden.

75
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,662
Whoever he is, he is a clueless idiot.

76
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,581
He should come to our boss

77
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,624
and bow down to him on his first day.

78
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,918
He should do that first. Don't you agree?

79
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,129
What the heck? Why is he up there?

80
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,091
(inmates coughing)

81
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:46,012
I'll be the warden here
for the time being.

82
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,348
(suspenseful music)

83
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,016
INMATE: So the rumors were true.

84
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,977
They say that he was the one
who ratted out Warden Park.

85
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:56,230
Seems true seeing how he beat out people
senior to him and became the warden.

86
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,732
I'm not like Warden Park.

87
00:05:58,649 --> 00:05:59,942
SOOCHUL: There will be no rating system.

88
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,652
Moreover, bribery will not be tolerated.

89
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,738
As a first step to uproot bad habits,

90
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:06,074
we'll install suggestion boxes
throughout the penitentiary.

91
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,076
SUGGESTION BOX

92
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,536
SOOCHUL: Only the warden can check
the suggestion boxes

93
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,288
and I guarantee strict confidentiality.

94
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,083
Write freely.

SOOCHUL: There has been
too much violence among inmates.

98
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,722
In order to track down illegal weapons,

99
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:33,434
we will conduct a body search
on every inmate starting today.

100
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,645
What is he talking about?

101
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,356
I have a bad feeling about this.

00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,479

but they're all in for petty crimes.

135
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,970
But could Warden Park
have controlled the entire penitentiary

with just three men?

Monitor them to see
whom they communicate with.

Why don't we just torture them?

00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,167
HYEJIN: It's called ASR.

171
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,461
It's a new drug
that hasn't been reported yet in Korea.

172
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,338
It's rare here as well.

173
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,716
I had an inkling when I read the symptoms.

174
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,302
The white blood cell count
was three times higher than the norm.

175
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,222
Are you saying this is leukemia?

176
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,391
It's very likely.

177
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,727
(gasps)

178
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,940
MIHO: Most of the cancer patients
in Gucheon Hospital had similar symptoms.

179
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:14,400
What was the cause?

180
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:17,945
They need more blood samples
to get more detailed results.

181
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,156
I'll get them.

182
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:23,492
You'll have to come back to Korea.

183
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:25,619
I will.

184
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:28,664
Thank you, Hyejin.

185
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,292
It makes me uncomfortable
hearing you thank me.

186
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:34,336
If I hadn't kept quiet
about what Choi Doha was really like,

187
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,131
things wouldn't have gotten this bad.

188
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,719
(camera shutter clicking)

189
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:46,015
That was resolved,
so don't worry about it.

190
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,767
-(door opens)
-ROOM LEADER: Ma'am!

191
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,477
You need to get over here!

192
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,978
I need to go. Let's talk later.

193
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,271
(phone beeps)

194
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:57,026
(suspenseful music)

195
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,741
GUARD: Hold on tight.
Hold him down. You hear me?

196
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:07,661
-I told you to hold on tight.
-Hey!

197
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,914
I said, give me my meds.

198
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:12,583
-Stay still, you bastard!
-Give me my medicine!

199
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,169
PSYCHOPATH: Give me my meds!

200
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:18,005
(gasping)
My medicine!

201
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,258
GUARD: This is his prescription.

202
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,260
You can just follow that.

203
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:26,347
He's a serial killer,
so be especially careful.

204
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,766
-GUARD 1: Let's go.
-GUARD 2: Yes, sir.

205
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:32,061
Give me my medicine! My supplements!

206
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,481
You should just give him his medicine.

207
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:36,649
My medicine!

208
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,652
This won't work.
We need to put him to sleep first.

209
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,446
Get me my supplements.

210
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,156
My supplements!

211
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,242
(clattering)

212
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:09,932
CHANGHO: They said they were the same meds
but the model inmates had a separate line.

213
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:14,728
If No. 1503 became addicted to drugs
because of those supplements…

214
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,273
It means they were not the same meds.

215
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:21,777
And it's likely that the other
model inmates are in the same condition.

216
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,780
Why model inmates, though?

217
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:29,326
CHANGHO: Only model inmates
leave the penitentiary on a work release.

218
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:30,995
MIHO: What do they do?

219
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,956
CHANGHO: They supposedly clean rivers
and public areas.

220
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,792
They won't say anything
other than that the pay is good.

221
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,253
I think they were ordered not to speak.

222
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:42,548
They wouldn't get leukemia from cleaning.

223
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:44,884
Their work release
is the only thing that I can think of.

224
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,554
I'll find out their schedule
and ask Soontae to dig into it.

225
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,264
Okay.

226
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:56,395
CHANGHO: You seem down.
Is something wrong?

227
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,607
He's a murderer on death row,

228
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:03,527
but the fact that he's dying
of a disease bothers me.

229
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:07,489
Killing Professor Seo wasn't enough?
What is he trying to hide?

230
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,242
It's so cruel that it angers me.

231
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:14,788
I don't think I can ever forgive
Mayor Choi and his people.

232
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,292
Don't go too deep.

233
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,210
I'm worried about you.

234
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:24,381
Let's do only as much as we need, okay?

235
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,765
LIVE A DILIGENT LIFE
IN A BRIGHT AND ORDERLY MANNER

-Mister.
-Hello.

237
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,736
Remember what I asked last time?

238
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:49,907
Yes. The consultation
about the blood test results…

239
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:56,789
I had the porters relay the message
to the model inmates.

240
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:59,625
Five to six people a day would be perfect.

241
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,251
I got it.

242
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,295
-Thank you.
-Five to six.

243
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,505
ROOM LEADER: Okay.

244
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,008
Five to six.

257
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,178
DR. HAN: Hyejin.

258
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:57,474
I'll forgive you for everything.

259
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,601
Come back to me.

260
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,146
DR. HAN: Hyejin. I miss you.

261

I WILL PAY YOU MORE
SO KEEP MONITORING HER

262
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,149
Hyejin.

263
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:09,445
Hyejin. Come back. Please.

Were you aware of it?

Please say a word to the citizens.

EXCLUSIVE REPORT

269
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:22,166
IS MAYOR CHOI DOHA'S WIFE A DRUG ADDICT?

270
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,793
(tense music)

271
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,927
-(door closes)
-(music stops)

272
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,310
Lie back down. Don't strain yourself.

273
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,561
(breathes deeply)

274
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:44,438
I heard they blocked it
the best they could.

275
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,690
I wondered who broke the news.

276
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,820
MAYOR CHOI: I just met with the team
investigating the case.

277
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,492
I'll do my best
to help you avoid detention,

278
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,118
so don't worry too much.

279
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,329
I thought long and hard...

280
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,916
about why this happened to me.

281
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,335
Because of me.

282
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,547
I had Park Yoongab arrested.

283
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,675
He's Big Mouse's right-hand man,

284
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,511
so he retaliated against me.

285
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,054
JUHEE: I disagree.

286
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:21,308
Big Mouse was looking
for Professor Seo's paper.

287
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:26,146
He probably grouped me together
with the guys who killed Professor Seo.

288
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,441
-MAYOR CHOI: Juhee.
-I know something outrageous is happening

289
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:30,943
at the hospital.

290
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,447
I had ignored it

291
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,117
because I didn't want
to get my hands dirty.

292
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,746
I guess that makes me an accomplice too.

293
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,290
You had nothing to do with it.

294
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,544
That was what I wanted to believe.

295
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,047
But this was what it led to.

296
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,218
It's not your fault.

297
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:58,512
It's my fault.

298
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,686
I'll fix it.

299
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,647
You've done well until now.

300
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:13,944
Just stay as the great doctor
that you are.

306

How much did you give Warden Park?

309
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,663
I hear he's obsessed with money.

310
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,082
You gave him money
to falsify that recording, didn't you?

311
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,836
Park Changho is working with Big Mouse.

312
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,088
She didn't say anything
about Professor Seo's paper?

313
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,423
No, nothing.

314
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:21,637
MAYOR CHOI: The reason why Ko Miho
joined the penitentiary infirmary

315
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,806
was for Seo Jaeyoung's paper.

316

(sighs)

317
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,521
If that's the case,

318
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:39,196
it means Park Changho
already knows everything about me.

319
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:43,909
Thank you for keeping your promise.

320
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:52,167
Call the US and find out
what Jang Hyejin is up to.

(clamoring continues)

332
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,889
A PENITENT ATTITUDE

333
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,769
(suspenseful music)

334
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:55,605
The prison uniform suits you.

335
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,316
-(thuds)
-(thumps)

336
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,900
(inmates gasp)

337
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,445
-INMATE: What happened?
-YOONGAB: How dare you betray me?

338
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,699
Should I kill you and make you disappear?

339
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:07,826
(indistinct chattering)

340
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,460
(inmates exclaim)

341
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:20,547
I was trying to be polite
for old times' sake.

342
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,007
-(groaning)
-SOOCHUL: Hey, you.

343
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,551
Do you still think you're the warden here?

344
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:26,887
-(inmates exclaim)
-(groans)

345
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,014
Why are you acting out? Who has your back?

346
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:31,224
SOOCHUL: Big Mouse? Is it?

347
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:34,144
I asked you a question. Yeah?

348
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,854
-SOOCHUL: Yeah?
-GUARD: Please stop.

349
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:38,148
Please stop it.
Too many people are watching.

350
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:41,318
GUARD: Please stop.
Too many people are watching.

351
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,696
(Soochul exhales)

352
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,324
LEAD OTHERS TO THE RIGHT PATH

353
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:48,533
SOOCHUL: Watch carefully.

354
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,535
I'm the warden here,

355
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:54,247
-and I'm the king. Got that?
-(thuds, clatters)

356
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,333
(music intensifies)

357
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:01,671
Bring me his minions. All of them.

00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:06,468
(inmates clamoring)

359
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:10,514
(inmate shrieks, groans)

360
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:15,435
CRPT
CORRECTIONAL RAPID PATROL TEAM

361
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,646

00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:28,824

(music fades)

367
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:50,095
Big Mouse is in the penitentiary.
Isn't he?

368
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:52,889
(suspenseful music)

369
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:56,726
If you don't say who he is,

370
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,896
you'll watch those guys
who were loyal to you die one by one.

371
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,986
I'll give you five seconds. One.

372
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,904
(whimpers)

373

-Two.
-Please save me, Warden.

375
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,457
-GUARD: Stay still.
-Three.

376
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:22,210
No one has ever seen Big Mouse.
Not me, not them.

377
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:29,134
-Four.
-You're wasting your time, you bastard!

378
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,219
(grunts)

379

(gurgling)

380
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,266
SOOCHUL: Who's Big Mouse?

381
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,643
(shrieking)

382
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,938
Tell me. Who is he?

383
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:44,191
(suspenseful music)

384
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:47,402

(suspenseful music)

390
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:16,139
This isn't the way I want to do this.

391
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,350
Release them and return to your office.

392
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:20,060
Don't get in the way and get lost.

393
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:21,645
Hey. Officer Gan.

394
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:25,148
(music fades)

395
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:27,692
Officer?

396
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,447
(sighs deeply)

397
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,407
Seriously. This little punk.

398
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,327
Get him.

399
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,412
(tense music)

400
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,585
Chairman Yang.

401
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:48,547
You're getting out soon. Choose wisely.

402
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:51,883
Do you want to ruin your final years
because of a bad guy like this?

403
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,301
Our family motto is...

404
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:56,513
"Beat bad guys to death

405
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:58,974
but maul traitors to death."

406
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:00,642
CHUNSIK: But you?

407
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:04,271
You used to serve this bad guy

408
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:08,316
and betrayed him.
You deserve to be mauled to death.

409
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,278
(suspenseful music)

410
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,322
If we fight here, I'll end up in solitary

411
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,325
but you'll lose that title.

412
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:25,208
(eerie music)

413
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,302

(ominous music)

417
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,231
Thank you, Ms. Ko.

418
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:54,404
I never imagined I'd receive help
from this couple.

419
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:06,833
(suspenseful music)

420
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:11,755
YOONGAB:
Why can't Gan Soochul act out against you?

421
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:15,925
It was obviously Mayor Choi
who made him warden.

422
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,887
Are you working with Choi Doha
to catch Big Mouse?

423
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,221
INMATE 1: Hey, Yoongab!

424
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:23,058
-(banging on door)
-Just wait, you bastard!

425
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,684
INMATE 2: You're dead, bastard!

426
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:28,021
INMATE 3: I'll kill you
once I see you in the yard!

427
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:30,357
INMATE 4: Give me back my money!

428
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,651
(inmates shouting)

429
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:35,570
INMATE 1: You damn bastard!

430
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,238
(shouting and banging stop)

431
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,829
(tense music)

432
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:48,083
I'm still Big Mouse in here.

433
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,418
You're lasting longer than I expected.

434
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:52,587
Things have changed drastically.

435
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:55,215
Nobody can guarantee you'll live.

436
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,218
Not even Big Mouse can protect you.

437
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:02,639
So? You want me to betray my master
in exchange for your protection?

438
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,558
You're in no position to worry about me.

439
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:10,188
You'll find out soon enough.

440
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:12,107
That what you saw from the warden's office

441
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,526
and real life here are as different
as heaven and hell.

442
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:19,322
Tell me whenever you change your mind.

443
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,503

444

-(scoffs)

447
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,182
(mutters)

448
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:47,517
Look who's here.

449
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,810
INMATE 1: This is my lucky day.

450
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:52,021
My gosh. Is our warden
here for inspection?

451
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:56,693
-(inmate 2 laughs)
-The warden is here. We need to crown him.

452
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:59,571
(inmates clamoring)

453
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:00,697
INMATE 3: Eat this!

454
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,952
INMATE 2: You damn bastard!
You need to be taught a lesson!

455
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,540
GUCHEON UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

456
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:12,709
(knocks on door)

457
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:18,882
You wanted to see me?

458
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:21,468
I need you to go somewhere with me.

459
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,053
Where are you going at this hour?

460
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:26,765
The underground lab.

461
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:28,933
Why?

462
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,226
What do you mean, why?

463
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,812
I'm someone with the master key.

464
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:37,317
How many employees
go in and out of the lab?

465
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,736
Including Dr. Han Jaeho, myself,
and the researchers,

466
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:42,030
there are six in total.

467
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,615
What about outsiders?

468
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:46,075
Just three. Director Jung Chaebong,
Attorney Lee Doogeun,

469
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,453
and Mr. Gong Jihoon of Woojeong Daily.

470
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:50,538
(ominous music)

471
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:55,710
But...

472
00:29:56,878 --> 00:30:00,632
you've never shown interest
in the lab before. So why…

473
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:02,509
I suddenly became curious.

474
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,637
Hospital employees are one thing.

475
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,306
But what are they doing in there

476
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,768
that even garbage from outside
are gaining access?

477
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:39,003

(dramatic music)

484
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,014
Hello, Mayor Choi.

485
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,349
Where's the director?

486
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:17,602
She went out for a walk
with the head nurse.

487
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,735
(ominous music)

488
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:26,819
HEAD NURSE: Ma'am.

489
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,699
Ma'am?

490
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:37,455
Are you okay? Should I get a wheelchair?

491
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:39,791
I'm fine.

492
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,092
Take me home.

493
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,386
HEAD NURSE:
You want to leave the hospital?

494
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,182
(ominous music continuous)

495
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,106

496
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,274
I want to go home.

497
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:26,546
Should I turn on some music?

498
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:28,673
I went...

499
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,551
to the underground lab.

500
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,345
It's a secret lab

501
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:38,224
that only a handful of people
from the hospital have access to.

502
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:41,436
(tires screech)

503
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:45,732
What did you see there?

504
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,359
Do you know about the lab?

505
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,153
Ms. Ko Miho told me about it before.

506
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:52,488
That she thought there was a secret lab

507
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,866
in the basement of the innovation center.

508
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:59,162
Professor Seo Jaeyoung
was in charge of the lab.

509
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,706
I never even looked at it

510
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:04,542
since I became hospital director.

511
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:09,172
Tell me.

512
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,799
What was in there?

513
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:17,722
You told me to stay a great doctor, right?

514
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:19,766
I want you...

515
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:23,728
to become a good politician
that people respect.

516
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,022
Don't get tainted.

517
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,900
Stay as clean as you are now.

518
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:34,781
Okay. I won't ask anymore.

519
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:38,034
MAYOR CHOI: You fix the sick people.

520
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,953
I'll fix the dirty world.

521
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,332
(suspenseful music)

522
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,546
TRUSTWORTHY LAW, HAPPY GUCHEON

523
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,341
What do you mean? I'm not on the list
of candidates for warden?

524
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,926
GUARD: That was what I heard.

525
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:57,136
I heard directly
from a friend in Personnel.

526
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:01,974
What happened?

527
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,436
He promised me.

528
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,731
Shouldn't you call Mayor Choi
before you lose your chance?

529
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:11,859
(ominous music)

530
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:13,778
GAN SOOCHUL

531
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:16,197
MAYOR OF GUCHEON, CHOI DOHA

532
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:19,742
What is it?

533
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,077
So…

534
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,206
MAYOR CHOI: I can't talk long.
Make it quick.

535
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:28,584
Park Changho is protecting Park Yoongab.

536
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:32,922
What do you mean?

537
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:34,507
I think they're working together.

538
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,591
(scoffs)

539
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:38,052
SOOCHUL: We will lose Big Mouse
if we only rely on Park Changho.

540
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:41,514
Please permit me to do things my way.

541
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,017
(exhales heavily)

542
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,105
SOOCHUL: Mayor Choi?

543
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,484
Do it.

544
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:54,777
Thank you.

545
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:57,947
(phone beeps)

546
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,574
Why didn't you mention your nomination?

547
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,200
I'll just show him results.

548
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:05,454
Bring in Park Yoongab and his minions.

549
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,623
And round up all the inmates.

550
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,794
(indistinct chattering)

551
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:17,133
(suspenseful music)

552
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:28,978
Silence.

553
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:31,063
(chattering stops)

554
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:35,860
SOOCHUL: Look here.

555
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:38,779
Here.

556
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:42,366
Here.

557
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:45,745
And here.

558
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:49,123
This tattoo that they all have

559
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,500
is a symbol
of Big Mouse's secret organization.

560
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:54,128
(tense music)

561
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,422
(inmates murmuring)

562
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:59,842
SOOCHUL:
Inmate 5247 that you believe in is a fake.

563
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,928
(music intensifies)

564
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:05,765
The real Big Mouse…

565
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:10,061
is hiding in here.

566
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:12,772
(inmates murmuring)

567
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:14,982
(tense music)

568
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:18,194
From this moment on,
we'll implement an emergency protocol.

569
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:22,740
You are banned from using all facilities
such as the mess hall and snack shop.

570
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:24,700
SOOCHUL:
Free time except exercise hours

571
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:26,410
will be halved
and work shifts will double.

572
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,248
You will be banned from visitors,
receiving food, or commissary funds.

573
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,958
If you violate the emergency protocol,

574
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,919
you will be punished
as per the warden's judgment.

575
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:39,632
The day Big Mouse is caught,

576
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:42,301
the emergency protocol will be lifted.

577
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:45,972
SOOCHUL: If you find
anyone suspicious, you may notify me...

578
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:49,183
or Number 5247.

579
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,437
Or use the suggestion box.

580
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:57,316
Also, anyone who assists
in catching Big Mouse

581
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,277
will receive a special pardon.

582
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:03,322
(tense music continues)

583
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:11,038
I hope to obtain peace quickly.

584
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:12,873
That is all.

585
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:14,625
GUARD: About face!

586
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:17,086
March forward!

587
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:21,549
(inmates clamoring)

588
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:22,800
INMATE 1: What nonsense!

589
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:27,805
INMATE 2: What do we have to do
with Big Mouse?

590
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:30,516
I can't stand this garbage.

591
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:34,478
INMATE 3: Let's just catch Big Mouse
and live comfortable lives!

592
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:37,064
-INMATE 4: Yeah!
-INMATE 5: Let's do it!

593
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,150
(music intensifies)

594
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,111
(groaning)

595
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:43,988
(inmates murmuring)

596
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:47,575
INMATE 1: Get up. Now.

597
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,578
Hey. You.

598
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:52,747
Where's Big Mouse?

599
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,206
If I knew,

600
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,751
would the warden have issued
an emergency protocol?

601
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,420
Yeah? Then I'll beat you up instead.

602
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,505
(tense music)

603
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:04,842
What's your problem? Let go.

604
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:07,428
He'll need four weeks to recover
if you punch him.

605
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,013
You'll get two years, maybe five,

606
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:10,598
since it was during incarceration.

607
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:16,395
You fraud. Stop running your mouth.

608
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:19,523
INMATE 1: You said you were Big Mouse.

609
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,067
I'm going to kill you, bastard.

610
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,319
CHUNSIK: Don't touch Changho.

611
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,988
(suspenseful music)

612
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:30,910
Boss. This bastard played you
all this time.

613
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:32,661
Aren't you pissed off?

614
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,955
I'm not pissed off

615
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:38,626
because I knew he wasn't Big Mouse
for a while now.

616
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:41,879
INMATE 1:
I'm way too pissed off, so stay out of it.

617
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:43,631
Hey now.

618
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,174
(inmates exclaim)

619
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:46,258
INMATE 2: Boss!

620
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:48,636
CHUNSIK: I told you to stop.

621
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:50,513
Whose boys are they?

622
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:52,098
The Incheon Intersection Gang.

623
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,016
-CHUNSIK: The Intersection Gang?
-INMATE 3: Yes.

624
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,144
Leave Park Changho alone,
or I'll tear down your intersection

625
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,021
and build a four-lane highway.

626
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,731
CHUNSIK: Hey. Take him away.

627
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:04,610
Out of our way! Move! Scram!

628
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:06,695
(tense music)

629
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,157
(mutters)

630
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:13,661
When did you find out
that Changho wasn't Big Mouse?

631
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,287
That? Ten minutes ago.

632
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:21,127
From what I've seen,
you're just as good as Big Mouse.

633
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:25,131
You have to keep your promise
to give me...

634
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:28,426
a life of luxury, okay?

635
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:32,555
I swear I'll keep my promise.
Thank you, Chairman Yang.

636
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:36,684
-Thank you.
-INMATE: Clear a path!

637
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:41,856
(ominous music)

638
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:45,234
What do you think you're doing?

639
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:46,944
Didn't you hear me?
Should I repeat myself?

640
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:53,659
(line ringing)

641
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:54,785
(sighs)

642
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:57,621
This is Park Changho.

643
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,418
Hello? Mayor Choi?

644
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:06,422
I'm in a meeting. Let's talk later.

645
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,383
GUCHEON PENITENTIARY

646
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:12,803
(line busy tone)

647
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,225
The mayor already okayed it.

648
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:19,852
He said he can't trust you.

649
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:24,148
I plan to do things my way now.

650
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,569
(ominous music)

651
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:30,404
Thanks for removing my shackles.

652
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:33,282
But you're wearing them now.

653
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,659
CHANGHO:
You're sitting there thanks to me.

654
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,703
Because I got Park Yoongab locked up.

655
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:45,252
Remember. If you don't catch Big Mouse,

656
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,380
you'll lose everything you have at once.

657
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:51,842
You'll be a mere guard again.

658
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,094
Officer Gan.

659
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:56,847

Is this sewer water?

Hey! You bastards…

673
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:36,428
ROOM LEADER:
The inmates are very disgruntled.

674
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:40,975
They're reporting anyone they dislike
as being Big Mouse,

675
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:45,187
so some guys are put in solitary
without even knowing why.

676
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:50,025
That leads to gang fights to retaliate
for reporting each other.

677
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:54,780
At this rate,
there may be a riot or something.

INMATE: Why you little…

679
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:07,293
ROOM LEADER: They think all of this
is Warden Park's fault.

680
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:11,505
I'm worried that he'll really get stabbed.

without doing anything.

I want to die by your hands.

828
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:55,982
HYEJIN (whimpering):
Stay back. I said stay back.

829
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,400
-Please.
-Stay back!

830
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:59,027
-Please!
-HYEJIN (screams)

831
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:02,197
(knife pierces)

832
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,282
(ominous music)

833
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,326
HYEJIN (pants)

834
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:10,455
(blood dripping)

835
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:17,754
(sobs)

836
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:19,839
(dramatic music)

837
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:27,555
(soft clattering)

838
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:42,529
Thank you.

839
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:46,950
No need to thank me.
It's just a painkiller.

840
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:48,243
(clanks)

841
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:50,495
Am I…

842
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:55,542
dying?

843
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:58,378
(dramatic music)

844
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:01,798
You should ask a doctor.

845
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:04,342
Sorry, ma'am.

846
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:10,849
(Room leader mutters)

847
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:13,268
Excuse me. I've brought the model inmates.

848
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:24,070
(keyboard clacking)

849
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,323
So you vomit and have fevers.

850
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:28,408
Anything else?

851
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:29,951
I've lost a lot of weight.

852
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:32,704
I get so dizzy that I faint at times.

853
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:36,916
I'll be drawing some blood.

854
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:39,127
MIHO: Roll up your sleeve.

855
00:55:57,729 --> 00:56:01,691
HAPPY

856
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:03,777
(percussive music)

857
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:13,328
May I sit here?

858
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:21,294
(Yoongab grunts, mutters)

859
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:23,171
ESTABLISHING LAW AND ORDER, HAPPY

860
00:56:23,254 --> 00:56:24,464
(Yoongab groans)

861
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:30,095
I thought you'd come see me at least once.

862
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:33,765
You gotta climb the tree
if you want the fruit.

863
00:56:33,848 --> 00:56:37,185
Do you know
why he's still letting you live

864
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:40,146
even after you joined Choi Doha
and betrayed us?

865
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:42,107
Because if I die,

866
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:45,193
there will be no one to look for
Seo Jaeyoung's paper.

867
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:47,278
Even if you clear your name
and get out of here,

868
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:49,823
if you stop working on that matter,
you and your family...

869
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:51,825
are dead.

870
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:54,285
I know.

871
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:57,664
That's why I'm pretending
to work with Choi Doha.

872
00:56:58,706 --> 00:57:01,751
Pretending? You didn't betray us?

873
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:03,837
(suspenseful music)

874
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:07,257
I came up with a new strategy
to catch the tiger

875
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:09,300
by entering the tiger's den.

876
00:57:09,884 --> 00:57:12,011
But Big Mouse just won't cooperate.

877
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:15,223
Tell me. What is your new strategy?

878
00:57:15,306 --> 00:57:16,641
Tell Big Mouse

879
00:57:17,308 --> 00:57:20,478
to come to the Catholic church
at 8 p.m. tonight.

880
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:25,233
This is my final notice.

881
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:26,860
If he doesn't show up,

882
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:29,904
regardless of whether you guys
kill me or not,

883
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,948
I'm going to get rid of the plan.

884
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:38,538
(suspenseful music)

885
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:49,174
JERRY: I see.

886
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,510
No good will come from meeting.

887
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:55,346
Okay, will do.

888
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:58,808
(phone beeps)

889
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:01,436
Please process my discharge.

890
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:05,523
(scoffs)

891
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:08,026
Changho, you're an amusing guy.

892
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:13,907
(music stops)

893
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,335
(ominous music)

894
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:33,801

895
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:36,429

896
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:01,412

897
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:18,721
(tense music)

898
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:35,238
(phone vibrating)

899
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:42,620
Yes. I'm on my way now.

900
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:45,665
I understand.

901
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,466
(music fades)

902
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:58,052
-Hi, baby.
-JIHOON: Sweetie, say hi.

903
00:59:58,136 --> 01:00:00,346
Prosecutor Choi from the Gucheon
Prosecutors' Office.

904
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:01,723
It's nice to meet you, ma'am.

905
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:04,559
Same here. When the auction starts later,

906
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:05,935
you'll make me look good, right?

907
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:07,854
-What's your goal?
-Six large.

908
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:10,732
What? Six large? That much?

909
01:00:10,815 --> 01:00:13,484
Even Juhee only raised three last year.

910
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:15,403
That's why it's six.

911
01:00:15,486 --> 01:00:18,865
I need to raise double
to make an impression on the elder.

912
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:22,327
ASHLEY KIM:
Why aren't Mayor Choi and Juhee here yet?

913
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:24,287
They're probably too humiliated.

914
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:26,914
It's a drug abuse scandal after all.

915
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:28,374
(laughs)

916
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:29,459
CHAEBONG: That's right.

917
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:33,212
Hyun Juhee was being all cocky
because the elder had her back.

918
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:36,841
But do you know why the elder
disowned his own grandchild?

919
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:40,094
-It was because of drugs.
-(exclaims)

920
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:44,974
But Juhee isn't even his actual grandkid.
I bet the elder will cut her off for sure.

921
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:47,560
(laughter)

922

-What?

924
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:54,317
(Ashley Kim squeals)

925
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,694
Thank you for coming, Mr. Chairman.

926
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,030
Hello, Mr. Chairman.

927
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:02,867
Send everyone out.

928
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:05,203
What the heck?
You're not kicking out my guests.

929
01:01:05,286 --> 01:01:06,454
Get rid of them as she says!

930
01:01:07,538 --> 01:01:08,498
ASHLEY KIM: Pardon?

931
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:11,125
(Associate mutters, claps)

932
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:12,960
The auction is about to begin.

933
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:16,839
Please go to the auction hall
on the first floor.

KO MIHO

944
01:02:37,211 --> 01:02:38,504
HYEJIN: You're sure that
the inmates' blood

945
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:40,923
is a clue to Professor Seo's paper, right?

946
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:44,177
HYEJIN: They were all technical terms in
English so it was difficult to understand.

947
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,387
But that information was definitely there.

948
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:49,807
MIHO: I'll try to get blood samples
by the day you arrive in Korea.

949
01:02:51,225 --> 01:02:54,479
I'll bring the blood samples
to you by 7 p.m.

SOOCHUL: Yes, Mayor Choi.

952
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:09,744
Listen very carefully.

953
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:14,040
SOOCHUL: Yes, sir. Understood.

954

955
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:22,715

956
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,342
If you join me now,

957
01:03:24,926 --> 01:03:27,053
you can be in the top one percent
of this country.

958
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:29,222
Choose.

959
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:31,974
I'll join you.

Park Changho and Ko Miho.

962
01:03:40,691 --> 01:03:42,276
We have to kill both of them today.

We won't eat this garbage!

972
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:03,107
Refusal to eat is insubordination!

973
01:05:06,444 --> 01:05:07,987
So what if it's insubordination?

974
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:11,240
Should we all die?

(whistle blowing)

998
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:55,761
(hissing)

999
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:01,726
Boss! Come out!

1000
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:21,454
Freedom!

1001
01:07:22,621 --> 01:07:24,248
INMATE 1: Let's go!

1002
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:31,922
INMATE 2: I'm going to get out of here!

1003
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:34,216
INMATE 3: Let's go!

1004
01:07:37,636 --> 01:07:39,430
INMATE 4: Let's go!

1005
01:07:39,513 --> 01:07:42,308
(inmates clamoring)

1006
01:07:44,435 --> 01:07:46,437
(tense music)

1007
01:07:53,861 --> 01:07:54,862
Boss.

1008
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:57,281
Don't do anything stupid.

1009
01:07:58,157 --> 01:08:00,159
Tell our boys to stay put.

1010
01:08:00,618 --> 01:08:01,744
Yes, Boss.

1011
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:09,251
(gun clicking)

1012
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:12,713
The riot must only be in Ward Two.
Close all paths to the medical room.

1013
01:08:13,297 --> 01:08:14,465
And find Park Changho.

1014

(tense music)

1015

(clanks)

1016
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:21,222
Then get rid of our guys.

1017
01:08:21,305 --> 01:08:24,225
The rioters killed Ko Miho
and it was self-defense on your part.

1018
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:29,313
I've turned off the cameras,
so don't worry.

1019
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,361
(tense music continues)

1020
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:45,121
DANGER: HIGH VOLTAGE

1021
01:08:45,496 --> 01:08:46,330
HIGH VOLTAGE

1022
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:56,215
-(music stops)
-(electricity shuts down)

1023
01:08:58,008 --> 01:08:59,510
GUCHEON PENITENTIARY

1024
01:08:59,593 --> 01:09:00,803
GUARD: What happened?

1025
01:09:03,347 --> 01:09:05,599
(clock ticking)

1026
01:09:06,892 --> 01:09:08,894
(ominous music)

01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:21,699
(footsteps)

1030
01:09:30,708 --> 01:09:32,960
(footsteps approaching)

1031
01:09:45,472 --> 01:09:47,474
(clock ticking)

1032
01:09:58,527 --> 01:09:59,695
(lighter clanks)

1033
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:05,701
(ominous music)

1034
01:10:23,677 --> 01:10:24,678
You're...

1035
01:10:25,846 --> 01:10:27,139
Big Mouse?

1036
01:10:29,475 --> 01:10:31,477
(theme music)

1037
01:10:42,988 --> 01:10:45,491
BIG MOUTH

1038
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:47,576
(closing theme music)

1039
01:11:05,552 --> 01:11:08,347
BIG MOUTH

1040
01:11:09,431 --> 01:11:10,641
Promise me...

1041
01:11:10,724 --> 01:11:13,185
you'll let me go if I uncover
the secret behind the paper.

1042
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:16,522
Something huge will happen today.

1043
01:11:16,605 --> 01:11:18,941
MAYOR CHOI: Overdoing something
always brings about a disaster.

1044
01:11:19,858 --> 01:11:21,610
MIHO: I think something happened inside.

1045
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:22,945
I think we were fooled.

1046
01:11:23,028 --> 01:11:24,863
MAYOR CHOI:
Get rid of both of them tonight.

1047
01:11:25,698 --> 01:11:27,533
ROOM LEADER: Your wife is in danger.

1048
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:29,868
CHANGHO: I can only beat them
if we're in the same class.

1049
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:31,120
Let me make an offer as well.

1050
01:11:31,870 --> 01:11:34,206
CHANGHO: It's because I received
another request from Big Mouse.

1051
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:37,459
To uncover the truth
behind Seo Jaeyoung's murder.
