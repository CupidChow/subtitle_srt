00:00:04,754 --> 00:00:06,756
(theme music)

2
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:43,960
BIG MOUTH

3
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,754
THIS SHOW IS A WORK OF FICTION

4
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:48,965
THE EVENTS AND ENTITIES
THAT APPEAR HEREIN ARE FICTIONAL

5
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,051
(suspenseful music)

6
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:59,100
EPISODE 15

7
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:02,979
You must be surprised to see me alive,

8
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,065
Cho Sunghyun.

9
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,201
(music intensifies)

10
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,497
(music stops)

11
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,665
I know you killed him.

12
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:26,294
Just wait.

13
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,255
I'll show the world

14
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,510
how disgusting you truly are
and your evil spirit.

15
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:37,305
(suspenseful music)

16
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,814
(tense music)

17
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:55,615
(music fades)

18
00:01:57,992 --> 00:02:01,121
Did I mishear him?

19
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,705
(Mayor Choi sniffles)

20
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:06,793
I thought I heard him
call you Cho Sunghyun.

21
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,044
(sniffles)

22
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,505
(exhales)

23
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:15,385
I'll explain everything
after we lay the elder to rest.

24
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,762
(ominous music)

25
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:22,350
(Mayor Choi sniffles)

26
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,865
We'll never have to see him again, right?

27
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,449
That's right.

28
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,952
He was arrogant
because the chairman had his back,

29
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:43,580
but he suddenly lost his supporter.

30
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,165
There's no way he'll become mayor now.

31
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:48,960
Of course not.
We have no reason to help him anymore.

32
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,170
(Chaebong laughs)

33
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,422
Hey, Prosecutor Choi. How did it go?

34
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,509
(suspenseful music)

35
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,060
Attorney Jung just arrived.

36
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,354
It was hard to convince him to come.

37
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:11,274
Good work.

38
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,611
(music intensifies)

39
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,781
Please, don't get up. Stay seated.

40
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,366
(Jihoon chuckles)

41
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,452
(grunts)

42
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,455
Goodness. Sorry I'm late.

43
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,916
How's your health?

44
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,959
I heard you were struggling with diabetes.

45
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,295
I'm fine, thanks to you.

46
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:36,382
So? What about what I asked?

47
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,094
It'll be read aloud
after Chairman Kang's funeral...

48
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,554
You didn't bring it?

49
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:44,849
(sighs)

50
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,112
(suspenseful music)

51
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:00,865
ATTORNEY JUNG:
The chairman evenly gave to everyone

52
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,368
so that no one would be hurt.

53
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,746
What's wrong with this old man?

54
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,998
It's like he was rationing meals
at the mess hall.

55
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,751
He said he wanted to change his will,

56
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:14,254
but he passed away so suddenly.

57
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:17,298
About this will...

58
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:22,762
Is there any way
to tweak it just slightly?

59
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:26,224
Are you saying
you'll tamper with the will?

60
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:27,767
(laughs)

61
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,185
No.

62
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:34,148
This was written a while ago, right?

63
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:38,319
There's something
he told me when he was alive.

64
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,531
So, I wouldn't be tampering with it.

65
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,700
Let's say he revised it already.

66
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,160
There's no way to revise it.

67
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:52,500
I'll make it very worth your while,
Attorney Jung.

68
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:53,876
Even if there were a way,

69
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,213
my conscience would never allow it.

70
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,676
(inhales sharply, exhales)

71
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,013
This is slightly disappointing.

72
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:10,143
There's no way
the chairman would be so stingy.

73
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,939
(suspenseful percussive music)

74
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,405
ATTORNEY JUNG:
Enjoy your meal. I'll go now.

75
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:25,116
Sure. I won't walk you out.

76
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,993
JIHOON: Oh, Attorney Jung.

77
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,913
I hope you'll be guiltless and upright

78
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,541
until you grow senile.

79
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,543
Good luck with that.

80
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,297
ATTORNEY JUNG: Have a nice day.

81
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,677
(music fades)

82
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,016
Chairman Kang's estate is huge.

83
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,435
Yes, it is huge,

84
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:55,063
but he's just way too fair.

85
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,939
Fair? Damn it.

86
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,900
JIHOON: How is this fair?

87
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:02,653
After all the crap I did for him
to clean up his messes.

88
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,615
At least Choi Doha didn't get too much.

89
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:08,951
You were worried
that he would've tampered with the will.

90
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,746
(scoffs)

91
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,790
(phone vibrating)

92
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,333
PARK CHANGHO

93
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,044
(exhales loudly)

94
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:19,962
(slurps)

95
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,798
(vibrating continues)

96
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,719
Hey, Mr. Park. What's up?

97
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:31,891
Why would I need to see you?
To talk about what?

98
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,186
Right, the election.

99
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:39,816
Handle it on your own. You're a smart guy.

100
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,152
-(phone beeps)
-Are you cutting him off?

101
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,364
The chairman passed away anyway.

102
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:50,743
Why bother grabbing onto a kite
without its thread?

103
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,204
I should let it drift away.

104
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,831
(mutters)

105
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,333
(tense music)

106
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:01,295
(Jihoon whistling)

107
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,174
(car beeps)

108
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,428
(whistling continues)

109
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:09,720
(engine starts)

110
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,099
(horn honks)

111
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,852
-What the heck? God damn it.
-(honking continues)

112
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,812
Hey, hey.

113
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:20,106
(Jihoon shrieking)

114
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:21,607
(brakes screech)

115
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,155
(mutters)

116
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:31,993
Hey. Where did you learn to drive, punk?

117
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,955
Damn it. Get over here.

118
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:37,999
JIHOON: Hey.

119
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,251
Hey!

120
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,421
Back up. I need to get out, so back up!

121
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:46,841
Hey! Back up.

122
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,426
I said, back up!

123
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,970
(ominous music)

124
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,096
(grunts)

125
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:53,931
Hey.

126
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,562
(muttering)

127
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,148
Hey. You.

128
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,609
JIHOON: Are you blind?

129
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,238
What a diverse-looking group.

130
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:12,492
(inhales sharply)
You look familiar...

131
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,829
Hey. Wait right here, got it?

132
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:19,665
Wait right here, you punks. Wait.

133
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:21,876
JIHOON: You're dead. Wait.

134
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,503
What the hell? Damn it.

135
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,671
-Hey.
-(tires screeching)

136
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,007
Hey.

137
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,969
Hey!

138
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,889
(screaming)

139
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,349
(brakes screech)

140
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,604
(shrieking)

141
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,357
(gurgling)

142
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,237
(mutters)

143
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,617
(muttering)

144
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,702
(suspenseful music)

145
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:58,955
(car door closes)

146
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,673
Damn. So it was you.
(chuckling)

147
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,634
JIHOON: This floor is crazy slippery.

148
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,095
(laughs)

149
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:17,932
What? Do you have business with me?

150
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:26,315
Look. See that? Cameras.

151
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,067
JIHOON: There's a lot of them.

152
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:29,819
Are you here to abduct me?

153
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:41,038
Chairman Kang didn't die
from cardiac arrest.

154
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:43,249
Really?

155
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:45,918
JIHOON: What should I do?

156
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,713
Should I open his casket and ask him?

157
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,841
(scoffing)

158
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,302
(exhales)

159
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:59,682
You'll come to me on your own
once the will is read.

160
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:00,808
(snickers)

161
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:04,437
Don't come crying for help
when the time comes.

162
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,814
You broke our trust first.

163
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,274
(clears throat)
Sure.

164
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:11,235
That won't ever happen,

165
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:15,698
so you and I should just go
our separate ways.

166
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:17,908
(smirks)

167
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:25,207
(suspenseful music)

168
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,715
-(car door closes)
-(engine revving)

169
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,596
(tires screeching)

170
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,222

00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:45,936
Help me? Give me a break!

172
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:51,525
I already read the will, idiot!

173
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,110
Damn it.

174
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:58,074
I get 36 percent of NK Chemical!

175
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:02,286
I'll be a major shareholder!
Me, Gong Jihoon!

176
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,663
(in English) Yes, sir!

177
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,082

00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,735
We're done.
There was a problem with the cable.

184
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,904
I see. Thank you.

185
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,322

00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,870
Oh my gosh. You scared me.

188
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,956
Be careful, will you?

189
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,040
-Sorry.
-DOOGEUN: Are you okay?

190
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,333
Yeah.

191
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:51,752
ASHLEY KIM: Hi.

192
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,255
DOOGEUN:
Looks like we're the first to arrive.

193
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,716
-Where's Jihoon?
-He'll be here soon.

194
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,384
-Have some tea.
-DOOGEUN: Okay.

195
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,177
Did you renovate?

196
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,846
I had something fixed.

197
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,141
CHAEBONG: Let's sit around here.

198
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,475
Goodness.

-WOMAN: Long time no see.

201
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,484

202
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,195

-MAN 3: It's been a while.

203
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,532

Hey. You seem to be in a really good mood.

204
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:24,452
-My heart is about to burst.
-(chuckles)

205
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,912
I feel like I'm opening a treasure chest.

Mr. Gong.
You read the will personally, right?

208
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,295
You guys got much more than you deserve,

209
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:36,255
and I didn't get enough.

210
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:39,550
What do you mean,
it's more than we deserve?

211
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:40,801

(serene music)

215
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,692
Once we finish divvying up the assets,

216
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,736
we should kick them out first.

217
00:12:58,819 --> 00:12:59,862
(chuckles)

218
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,406
If we combine our shares,

219
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,701
we can get rid of them
without breaking a sweat.

ATTORNEY JUNG:
As the executor of the chairman's will,

227
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,851
I shall now read his will.

228
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,604
(applause)

229
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:39,443
I'm Chairman Kang's legal representative,
Attorney Kim Kisoo.

230
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:44,698
KISOO: First, let me announce
that this will is valid

231
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,909
and fully enforceable.

232
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,494
Hold on.

233
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:53,457
He's the attorney, not Attorney Jung?

234
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,710
The chairman wrote a new will
a week before he passed away.

235
00:13:58,212 --> 00:13:59,296
(gasps)

236
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,508
ATTORNEY JUNG: I'll read it now.

237
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:07,930
"I, Kang Sunggeun,
give and bequeath my assets as follows.

238
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,141
I leave my shares of Woojae Construction,
OC Group,

239
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:14,687
Chilbong Foundation,
and Nine Semiconductors..."

(suspenseful music)

241
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,482
"...to Hyun Juhee."

242
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,111
What...

243
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,612
DOOGEUN: What?

244
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,826
ATTORNEY JUNG: "I leave my shares
of NK Chemical's subsidiaries,

245
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,328
Galaxy Electronics,
FT Industry, Gucheon Steel,

246
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:34,665
Royal Hydro, and Big Bang C&C...

247
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,713
to Choi Doha."

248
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,215
What the hell is this?

249
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,509
(tense music)

250
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:55,519
(inhales sharply)

251
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,321
Give me that.

252
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,658
Something's wrong here.

253
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,493
CHAEBONG: This can't be!

254
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,912
Can it?

255
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,038
Let's go.

256
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,707
(tense music)

257
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,209
CHAEBONG: Hold on.

258
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,754
Is this real?

259
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,255
JIHOON: Hey.

260
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,466
What did you do to the will?

261
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,510
Are you saying I tampered with it?

262
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:31,889
If not? That makes absolutely no sense.

263
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,352
Don't tarnish the elder's wishes.

264
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,146
You bastard!

265
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,982
-What are you playing at?
-CHAEBONG: Hey, Choi Doha!

266
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,735
-JIHOON: Let go!
-Get over here, you bastard!

267
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:46,320
-Stop it.
-ASHLEY KIM: Honey!

268
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:49,239
Hey! Honey!

269
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,699
CHAEBONG: You dirtbag!

270
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,494
-Stop it!
-Let go!

271
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:56,914
You louse! Get back here!

272
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:59,083
-Hey. You knew, didn't you?
-CHAEBONG: You bastard!

273
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:02,169
-Stop it!
-Let go!

274
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,712
-You jerk.
-Play a bit more.

275
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,214
You knew, didn't you?

276
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,715
(remote beeps)

277
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,760
Choi Doha took
all of NK Chemical's subsidiaries.

278
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,887
Changho predicted correctly.

279
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,807
He killed Chairman Kang
and tampered with the will.

280
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,934
It's nice watching them
fight among themselves,

281
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:19,853
but Choi Doha is becoming too powerful.
He'll be at Chairman Kang's level.

282
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:23,899
(phone vibrating)

283
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,612
-Hello?
-WOMAN: Is this Ms. Ko Miho?

284
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,948
This is the hospital
where you were admitted before.

285
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:32,825
MIHO: Just a minute.

286
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,335
Okay, I'm here.

287
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:47,631
Your blood test results came back
and they look very bad.

288
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:48,716
(mutters)

289
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,468
What's bad about them?

290
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,554
(solemn music)

291
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:55,848
It's okay. Please tell me.

292
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:59,560
I think you should come in
and get a full check-up.

293
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:00,728
(door opens)

294
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,105
MIHO: I'll call you back.

295
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:04,732
-(phone beeps)
-Hey.

296
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,276
Who was that?

297
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,319
The apartment security office.
We have a delivery.

298
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,363
What is it? I'll pick it up.

299
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:12,948
It's okay. I'll go.

300
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,867
I can drop off
this month's maintenance fee too.

301
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,494
I thought it was something serious.

302
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,163
(laughs)

303
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,999
(solemn music continues)

304
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,970
I had no idea...

305
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,724
the elder would leave us that much.

306
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,020
I can understand
why he left you all of that,

307
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,982
but not what he left me.

308
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,280
You don't look that happy.

309
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:55,991
It feels unreal, to be honest.

310
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,993
I'm offended...

311
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:02,122
that those guys suspect me,
but I understand at the same time.

312
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,875
Don't worry about what others think.

313
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,961
We have to stand tall.

314
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,180
(suspenseful music)

315
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:23,727
(mutters)

316
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,688

317
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,190

318
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,733
(whimpering)

319
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,152
(panting loudly)

320
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,821
(screaming)

321
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:37,116
(breathing heavily)

322
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,617
(tires screeching)

323
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,870
Chairman Kang didn't die
from cardiac arrest.

324
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,956
(breathing heavily)

325
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,041

PARK CHANGHO

327
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:52,172
CHANGHO: You'll come to me on your own
once the will is read.

328
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,051
Don't come crying for help
when the time comes.

329
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,930

00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:20,117
(vibrating continues)

336
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,202
(ominous music)

337
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:32,880
(claps)

338
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,965
(music stops)

339
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,177
(tense music)

340
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,475
(mutters)

341
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:48,478
Can we talk?

342
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,355
I have nothing to say to you.

343
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:55,485
Well... Things are very,
very bad for me right now.

344
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,029
I need your help.

345
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,363
That's your problem.

346
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,448
Hey.

347
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,283
(laughs)

348
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:05,621
I was wrong. I apologize.

349
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,209
Sorry.
(chuckles)

350
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:13,337
I can't stand people who are disloyal.
Get lost.

351
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,255
Wait. Hold up.

352
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:17,799
The mayoral race.

353
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:21,053
I will work my socks off

354
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,971
and do my best to help you.

355
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:24,890
I'm begging you, Park Changho.

356
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:27,142
Please. What do I have to do? Should I...

357
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,436
Should I kneel?

358
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,897
JIHOON: You don't want to see that.
You'd feel awkward, right?

359
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,067
Let's go somewhere quiet.
I'll write an oath in blood.

360
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,861
JIHOON: Let's go. Changho.
You're the only one I can turn to.

361
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:38,946
(breathes shakily)

362
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,157
(ominous music)

363
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,952
So, Cho Sunghyun

364
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:49,373
took on Choi Doha's identity.

365
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,126
JIHOON: That little kid...

366
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,255
It turns out he died
while playing in the river.

367
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,422
That's sad. He was so young.

368
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,507
(remote beeps)

369
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,717
Chairman Kang found out first,

370
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,719
but Choi Doha acted first.

371
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,974
(groaning)

372
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,141
(gasping)

373
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:12,479
CHANGHO: Naturally, the next step
would've been to tamper with the will.

374
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:17,359
Choi Doha, you despicable rat!

375
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,821
Is the NR Forum his now?

376
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:24,449
No. It isn't his yet.

377
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,995
If I tell them who he really is,

378
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:32,708
they'll bare their teeth
and rise up to rebel!

379
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,793
(tense music)

380
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,796
(chuckles)

381
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:40,966
CHANGHO:
It's campaign season now. Help me win.

382
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,801
Once I'm mayor,

383
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,886
I can destroy Choi Doha
with the law and justice

384
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,847
without doing anything shady.

385
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:52,477

(knocks on table)

390
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,493
MAYOR CHOI: You're still up?

391
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,495
JUHEE: I couldn't sleep.

392
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:13,999
Maybe I'll have some wine too.

393
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:20,714
(gulps)

394
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,141
MAYOR CHOI: I need to change my plan.

395
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:35,854
I plan to run for mayor
instead of the National Assembly.

396
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,066
(ominous music)

397
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:42,361
Is it because of Park Changho?

398
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,447
In case he becomes mayor?

399
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:53,705
I thought hard about why he left me
so much more than I deserved.

400
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:57,459
MAYOR CHOI: He wanted me to protect
all of his accomplishments.

401
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,252
That was why.

402
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:05,217
MAYOR CHOI:
I can try for the National Assembly

403
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:07,844
after I'm reelected mayor
and the businesses are stable.

404
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,723
Do everything you want.

405
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,726
Whatever you decide,

406
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,687
I'll follow your lead.

407
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:20,690
Juhee.

408
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,445
How much do you trust me?

409
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:28,365
(chuckles)

410
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:31,201
What the heck? Why would you ask that?

411
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,128
I've never once doubted you,

412
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,381
and I never will.

CHOI DOHA

418
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,194
Why did you suddenly decide
to run for mayor

419
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,572
after saying you'd run for a seat
in the National Assembly?

420
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:10,157
I thought long and hard about it.

421
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,368
If it were for personal gain,
I would've chosen the National Assembly.

422
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,412
But I concluded that Gucheon,

423
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:19,624
which dreams of great progress,
still needs me.

424
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,960
(camera shutters clicking)

425
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,462
MAYOR CHOI: Dear people of Gucheon.

426
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,756
I, Choi Doha, have returned.

427
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:31,011
If my last term served to fortify
the foundation of Gucheon's development,

428
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:34,097
it's time to raise our aspirations

429
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:36,183
to becoming a global city.

430
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,934
I'd like to work with all of you...

431
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,019
(remote beeps)

432
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:41,313
He makes it so obvious.

433
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:43,648
He wants to stop Changho
from becoming mayor.

434
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:47,903
KIKWANG: This is beyond an ambush.

435
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,362
Do you think you stand a chance?

436
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,199
Since it turned out this way,

437
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:54,659
I'll turn this election
into Choi Doha's grave.

00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,585
Let's make my husband, Park Changho...

499
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:15,670
ALL (cheering): Mayor of Gucheon!

500
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,629
(indistinct shouting)

501
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:19,174
ALL (chanting):
Gucheon Mayor Park Changho!

502
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,634
Gucheon Mayor Park Changho!

503
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,928
-MAN 1: Mayor Park Changho!
-MAN 2: Park Changho!

504
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,849
-(searing)
-(all exclaiming)

505
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,559
(applause)

506
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:32,479
(indistinct shouting)

507
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,523
(muffled sigh)

508
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,609
(solemn music)

509
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:54,125
(inaudible)

510
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,892
(music rises)

511
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:24,155
(inaudible)

512
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,209
(Miho pants)

513
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:40,380
(exclaims)

514
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,885
-(Miho exhales)
-CHANGHO: Miho!

515
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:47,762
Ko Miho!

516
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:50,056
Let's go back.

517
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:51,933
You're drunk.

518
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,562
You know how much I can drink.

519
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:58,273
I'm not drunk. I'm not even buzzed.

520
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,525
Hey.

521
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,318
(Changho exhales)

522
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:06,656
See? You're too drunk
to even stand straight.

523
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:08,408
I'm not drunk. I slipped.

524
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:10,577
(mutters)

525
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,579
Want me to carry you?
Want to get on my back?

526
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,710
(Changho mutters)

527
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:21,796
Did I do something wrong again?

528
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:25,008
(dramatic music)

529
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:31,931
Have you...

530
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:37,604
ever lied to me while we were married?

531
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,356
(chuckles)

532
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,608
What?

533
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:45,069
Tell me. Have you ever
hidden anything from me or not?

534
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:48,656
(laughs)

535
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,824
Well...

536
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:55,580
What about you? You've never lied to me?

537
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,667
(scoffs)
I'm not Mother Theresa.

538
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:03,463
How could a person not lie
even once in their life?

539
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:06,716
Right? When you're considerate
of each other,

540
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:10,094
you end up lying now and then
and stuff like that.

541
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,063
You're Big Mouse, aren't you?

542
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:22,148
(music fades)

543
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:30,990
You became Big Mouse
after Mr. No Park died.

544
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:35,620
Does your father know?

545
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:37,038
MIHO: Of course.

546
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,958
How could he not?
Everyone obeys your every command.

547
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:45,004
I really didn't want to do it,
but I had no choice.

548
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:49,092
CHANGHO: I agreed to do it
until Choi Doha pays for his crimes.

549
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,552
It's true, Miho.

550
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:54,472
Once I keep my promise to No Park,

551
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:55,932
-we can...
-MIHO: You know...

552
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:03,272
I want you to be a good Big Mouse.

553
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:05,358
(dramatic music)

554
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:07,026
A good Big Mouse?

555
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:11,489
Someone who punishes scumbags
who hurt powerless people

556
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:15,326
just to better their own lives.

557
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:20,957
A kind and righteous Big Mouse.

558
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,343
(sighs)

559
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,763
I'm tired. Give me a piggyback ride.

560
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:37,932
(mutters)

561
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:39,642
CHANGHO: Here.

562
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:42,979
(exclaims)

563
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:44,564
-(Miho grunts)
-Goodness.

564
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:50,611
MIHO: When's the happiest moment with me
after we started going out?

565
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:53,823
CHANGHO:
I'm not sure. There were too many.

566
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:55,450
What about you?

567
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:58,703
MIHO: Want to play the telepathy game?

568
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,830
We'll each say our happiest moment.

569
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:04,709
CHANGHO:
Okay. One, two, three, and then we say it.

570
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:06,544
After three, okay?

571
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:08,171
One, two, three.

572
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:10,548
-BOTH: Opening the law office.
-(Changho exclaims)

573
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:13,301
(chuckles)
We shared thoughts.

574
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,469
We did.

575
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,680
(sighs)
I miss our old office.

576
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,640
I worked late all the time.

577
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,351
MIHO: Why did you work late all the time
when you had no work?

578
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:25,563
CHANGHO: Just because.
I liked it because it was my first office.

579
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,524
The dinner you'd bring me every night
was delicious too.

580
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,527
MIHO: I thought you'd rake in the money,

581
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,780
but your first month's income
was a measly 580,000 won.

582
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:36,991
Do you know how much
all of that food cost?

583
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,576
(mutters)

584
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:39,869
Yes, but...

585
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:43,331
you said you were happy
seeing the nameplate with my name on it.

586
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:46,167
I was.

587
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:50,004
Because my husband
was the coolest person in the world.

588
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,839
(Changho chuckles)

589
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:54,675
Gosh. Are you okay?

590
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,636
MIHO: Yes, I'm okay.

591
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,887
CHANGHO: Goodness.

592
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,140
Let's hurry home, Miho.

593
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,771
WOOJEONG GALLERY

594
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,942
What's taking them so long?
I thought you talked to them.

595
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:17,073
Hi. You made it.

596
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:19,033
(chuckles)
Traffic's bad, isn't it?

597
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,454
JIHOON: Well... Wait a bit.

598
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,414
Once the others come, we can start...

599
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:26,916
They won't be coming.

600
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:29,836
What do you mean?

601
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:31,254
I told the group chat

602
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:34,298
that Choi Doha was really Cho Sunghyun.
He changed his identity...

603
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,925
They got a call from Choi Doha to meet.

604
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,677
I'm sure they're all there.

605
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,180
(exhales sharply)

606
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,600
Where is it?

607
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:48,980
Where is it?

608
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:51,065
(tense music)

609
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:01,868
(clears throat)

610
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:08,499
(applause)

611
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:09,709
(door closes)

612
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,797
Mr. Gong. Come in.

613
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:20,344
MAYOR CHOI: NR Forum decided
to officially support me in the election.

614
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:23,556
(percussive music)

615
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:26,601
Says who?

616
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,105
Get out if you plan to oppose.

617
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:34,066
(laughs)

618
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:38,446
JIHOON: Aren't you people angry?

619
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,201
I told you what kind of a rat
that bastard is.

620
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:47,288
You were pissed off and belligerent
in the group chat,

621
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:50,166
but you're pulling this garbage here?

622
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:51,250
(line dials)

623
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:54,086
How humiliating!

624
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,464
Hello, Director Yoon.
Are you free to talk now?

625
00:36:57,048 --> 00:37:00,635
JUHEE: The large shareholders
want to call an emergency board meeting.

626
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:04,430
To remove Mr. Gong Jihoon as CEO.

627
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:09,101
JUHEE: His performance as a CEO,
scandals related to his personal life,

628
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:10,519
abuse of power...

629
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:13,314
There are plenty of grounds for removal.

630
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,233
I'll call you back.

631
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:18,361
-(thuds)
-(phone beeps)

632
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:21,989
You'll fire me?

633
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,241
Isn't that what you want?

634
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:27,161
It looks like you're begging to be fired,
from where I'm sitting.

635
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:32,833
You don't know what a scumbag
your husband is, do you?

636
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:36,796
-Choi Doha, this bastard...
-I know...

637
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,382
that his childhood name was Cho Sunghyun

638
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:43,719
and that his grandfather was Cho Haesoo,
NK Chemical's lab director.

639
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:46,055
(suspenseful music)

640
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,309
(glass shatters)

641
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:53,729
(breathing heavily)

642
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:56,941
JUHEE:
Why didn't you tell me that all this time?

643
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,486
I believed all of the elder's
accomplishments

644
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:02,905
and all of the glory he was enjoying

645
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,574
belonged to my grandfather.

646
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:07,827
(suspenseful music)

647
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,626
The only way to reclaim all of that

648
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,671
was to be acknowledged.

649
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:22,800
If he knew I was Cho Haesoo's grandson,

650
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:27,013
the elder wouldn't have given me
that chance.

651
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,184
I realized after the will reading...

652
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:37,732
that he already knew.

653
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,530
And that was why he left me all of that...

654
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:47,950
(tense music)

655
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:49,076
MAYOR CHOI: Juhee.

656
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:52,663
I was afraid I'd lose you.

657
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,627
(tense music)

658
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,094
JIHOON: That's not all.

659
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:13,059
Everything, including marrying you,
was a part of his grand plan.

660
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,729
Even the elder's sudden death may...

661
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:18,189
Say one more word!

662
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:24,695
If you stab at Doha's painful scars
one more time,

663
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,656
it won't end with losing control
over the company.

664
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:29,492
I'll have you...

665
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,953
ostracized from society.

666
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,039
(ominous music)

667
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:37,500
(laughs)

668
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,379
(Jihoon whining)

669
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:45,633
I see you were all threatened
in this manner.

670
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:50,012
JIHOON: You had knelt at the chairman's
feet and served him all your lives.

671
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:52,598
All that changed was your master. Right?

672
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,434
JIHOON: Your leashes are still there.

673
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,186
(laughs)

674
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,732
JIHOON: Losing control over the company?

675
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:04,443
Go right ahead.

676
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,529
(ominous music)

677
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:10,199
I'll show you what I can do

678
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:13,452
when I go completely ballistic
when I'm pushed

679
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:15,871
to the edge of a cliff.

680
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,708
(tongue clicking)

681
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:27,591
JIHOON: You're a bunch of pathetic losers.

682
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,973
That bastard. Why I ought to...

683
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:36,475
-Let go. That little...
-DOOGEUN: Stop it.

684
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:37,643
CHAEBONG: That jerk.

685
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:40,479
(upbeat music)

686
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:46,193
If you finished there, go to Yangjae-dong
and then Seongsu-dong.

687
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,945
MAN: We didn't get it from the studio yet.

688
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:50,364
We'll let you know
when the schedule is ready.

689
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:51,615
Do you have to be so...

690
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,367
MEN: Hello, Boss!

691
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:55,453
Hello, sir!

692
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:56,954
MEN: Hello, sir!

693
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:58,539
Keep it up, sir.

694
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,418
(music stops)

695
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:06,088
The response is good
in the traditional market.

696
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:08,048
You should go back to the college.

697
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,551
Young people love him
as the lawyer who caught Big Mouse.

698
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:11,719
(sighs)

699
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:15,806
WOMAN: These are
for this week's TV debate.

700
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:18,142
This much?

701
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:19,852
WOMAN: These are just the summaries.

702
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:21,145
SOONTAE: Memorize them all.

703
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:23,814
The TV debate will be
the turnaround point of this election.

704
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,316
(phone ringing)

705
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:28,110
GONG JIHOON

706
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,613
(phone vibrating)

707
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,532
What is it?

708
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:38,204
(ominous music)

709
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:39,830
(phone beeps)

710
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,959
(inhales, exhales heavily)

711
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:47,588
I talked big in front of those jerks,

712
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:50,007
but once I walked out of there,

713
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:53,469
I realized I couldn't even take care
of myself.

714
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,812
(suspenseful music)

715
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:07,900
JIHOON: It's the special treatment

716
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:10,986
given to the NR Forum's corporations
by Choi Doha as mayor.

717
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,364
This is as far as I can help you.

718
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:18,577
I'm not betraying you,
I'm just incompetent.

719
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:20,579
So try to understand.

720
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:25,626
Does Chairman Kang have any family?

721
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:28,170
JIHOON: He had a son late in his age.

722
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:29,296
He had a son?

723
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,215
He's complete scum of the earth.

724
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:34,760
JIHOON: That was why he cut off all ties
with his one and only blood kin.

725
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:36,095
Where is he now?

726
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:39,723
I heard he was somewhere
in Texas in the US.

727
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,725
Does he not know that Chairman Kang died?

728
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:45,229
Probably not,
since he didn't come to the funeral.

729
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,190
What about his son?

730
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,526
You've heard of inheritance lawsuits,
right?

731
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:54,280
-I have.
-CHANGHO: If we find his son and sue,

732
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,658
we should be able to get back
a considerable amount of the inheritance.

733
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,661
Meaning Juhee and Doha's
authority decreases by that much.

734
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:02,746
(tense music)

735
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,082
(Jihoon exclaiming)

736
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,376
(mutters)

737
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:10,045
(chuckles)

738
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:12,715
So there was a way.
An awesome one at that.

739
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:14,758
JIHOON: Gosh. Nice.

740
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:18,345
I don't even like talking
to that jerk though.

741
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,014
Why not?

742
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,683
He's just a demon. Enough said.

743
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,644
So? You won't look for him?

744
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:27,021
Of course, I will.

745
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:29,481
I'm on the verge of dying here.

746
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:31,567
(tense music rises)

747
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:49,501
(music stops)

748
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,758
(ice clinking)

749
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:58,052
PROSECUTOR:
You're in better shape than I expected.

750
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:02,056
I thought you'd be wasted
and going crazy by now.

751
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:03,140
(Jihoon sighs)

752
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:04,767
I can't do that.

753
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,354
They say, even if a tiger drags you away,

754
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:10,606
as long as you keep it together...

755
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:12,650
you can live.

756
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:14,568
You'll die even if you keep it together.

757
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,403
You've been mauled by a tiger.

758
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:21,158
(exhales)

759
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:25,329
-PROSECUTOR: What is that?
-Information on a person.

760
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:27,331
Find him.

761
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:28,540
Who is he?

762
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,377
Kang Sunggeun's only son.

763
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,628
PROSECUTOR: Kang Sunggeun?

764
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:36,298
Chairman Kang had a son?

765
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:38,217
He's somewhere in Texas in the US.

766
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:41,220
He was abandoned by the chairman.

767
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,849
If he had a son,
Choi Doha can't get his entire estate.

768
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:46,934
That's right.

769
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:49,728
So we have to find him.

770
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:53,732
When I think about how those bastards
humiliated me...

771
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:57,611
PROSECUTOR: I don't get it.

772
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:01,156
If he's his only son,
why did he cut him off?

773
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:04,159
(exhales heavily)
Because he's a serial killer.

774
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:06,620
A psychopath.

775
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:09,289
-What's his name?
-You wouldn't know.

776
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:12,334
It's in there, so open it.

777
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:16,296
How could I not know a serial killer?

778
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,298
PROSECUTOR:
He must've been all over the news.

779
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:20,300
Because someone else went to jail
in his place.

780
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:22,845
(suspenseful music)

781
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:24,638
And he took off to the US.

782
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,517
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

783
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:31,395
GUCHEON UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

784
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:34,148
(heart monitor beeping)

785
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:42,948
(solemn music)

786
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,591
(serene music)

787
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:11,935
(sighs)

788
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:13,896
(sniffles)

789
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:23,363
(indistinct TV chatter)

790
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:53,685
(serene music)

791
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,775
(camera clicks)

792
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:17,084
DR. HONG

793
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:20,462
-(phone ringing)
-I must've dozed off.

794
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:21,672
Hello, Dr. Hong.

795
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:23,465
MAN: Remember that inmate we discussed?

796
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:25,717
Tak Kwanghyun.

797
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:29,388
He was moved to the palliative care unit
from the isolation unit.

798
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:31,723
I think he'll pass soon.

799
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,102
(solemn music)

800
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:38,397
(heart monitor beeping)

801
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,781
(sighs)

802
00:47:57,499 --> 00:47:58,542
MAN: Hey.

803
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:01,420
Why are you in here?

804
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:04,172
I came to see Mr. Tak.

805
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:05,591
Exactly. Why?

806
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:08,135
Is there a reason why I can't?

807
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:10,721
Don't make trouble and leave.

808
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:12,598
What are you so afraid of?

809
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:13,682
Why you...

810
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:17,311
I'm a nurse
who worked at the penitentiary.

811
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:20,898
Mr. Tak Kwanghyun was my patient
whose blood I personally tested.

812
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:27,154
(door opens)

813
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,743
(dramatic music)

814
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:36,580
Kwanghyun, do you hear me?

815
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:37,664
(door closes)

816
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:42,210
Kwanghyun.

817
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:46,798
Ms. Ko

818
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:50,010
Miho...

819
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,098
My mom...

820
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,311
What happened to my mom?

821
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:02,064
(Miho breathing shakily, sniffles)

822
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:06,360
She got her bone marrow transplant
and doing well now.

823
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,862
(solemn music)

824
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:11,698
I'm so glad.
(chuckles softly)

825
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:15,118
My brother and sister

826
00:49:15,827 --> 00:49:17,204
wouldn't tell me,

827
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:20,165
so I was worried.

828
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:21,875
(gasping)

829
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:25,462
You don't need to worry anymore.

830
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:33,512
Thank you.

831
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:40,310
(breathes deeply)

832
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:43,438
Thank you very...

833
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:46,316
much.

834
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,529
(heart monitor flat lines)

835
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:54,950
WOMAN: Kwanghyun?

836
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:59,246
Kwanghyun.

837
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:00,998
Kwanghyun, wake up.

838
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:02,958
Kwanghyun!

839
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:04,960
No, Kwanghyun.

840
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:07,212
Kwanghyun. Wake up...

841
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:10,424
(sobbing)

842
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,802
WOMAN: Wake up, Kwanghyun.

843
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,055
Please wake up.

844
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:19,933
Kwanghyun...

845
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:22,060
Kwanghyun...

846
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:24,438
(water running)

847
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:26,523
(solemn music rises)

848
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:44,791
(water stops)

849
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:48,712
My brother...

850
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:52,924
isn't a serial killer.

851
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:55,761
What do you mean?

852
00:50:56,344 --> 00:50:58,513
There was a rich psychopath.

853
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:01,725
My brother took the fall for him

854
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:06,563
so that he could get our mom her surgery.

855
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:09,524
(solemn music)

856
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:11,234
Who was that psychopath?

857
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:13,403
I don't know either.

858
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:16,615
He ended up being despised by everyone

859
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:18,533
and dying wrongfully like that.

860
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:21,828
Thank you so much
for making him comfortable...

861
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:26,833
in his final moment. And I'm sorry.

862
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:30,337
(woman sobbing)

863
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,136
(door opens)

864
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:42,140
What are you doing here?

865
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:43,767
The director's inside, right?

866
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:45,310
Do you have an appointment?

867
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:49,856
Look here, Ms. Ko.

868
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:54,653
It's fine. You may go.

869
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:03,870
JUHEE: I can't be mean
since you're a competitor's wife.

870
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:08,125
I don't have time to sit.
Say what you came to say.

871
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:12,045
How many more people must die
for you to stop?

872
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:14,840
You're still hung up

873
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:17,217
on that useless obsession.

874
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,844
Useless?

875
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:22,806
Should I lay it out for you?

876
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:26,143
You people have lost control already.

877
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:29,229
That was why you committed murder,
got rid of the secret lab,

878
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:31,565
and silenced the patients' families
with money.

879
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:33,441
Because it's already out of control.

880
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:35,777
(solemn music)

881
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:37,863
MIHO: You people won't get your way.

882
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:40,657
Because I'll uncover everything...

883
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:45,620
that you people did before I die.

884
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:52,210
(music rises)

885
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:54,087
(music fades)

886
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,465
Do you know what the scariest thing is?

887
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:01,136
Exposing that thing you call the truth,

888
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:04,806
but the world not changing at all.

889
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:07,726
Can you handle...

890
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:10,228
that despair?

891
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:12,772
(solemn music)

892
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:16,526
I'll show you...

893
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:19,321
that you're wrong.

894
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:22,741
You'll see what true despair is...

895
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:28,246
as you cry tears of blood.

896
00:53:38,423 --> 00:53:40,425
(music continues)

897
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:54,689
(music stops)

898
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:02,113
A NEW WAVE OF CHANGE
PARK CHANGHO

899
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:07,786
(door opens)

900
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:09,871
(solemn music)

901
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:20,465
MIHO: Here.

902
00:54:20,548 --> 00:54:21,925
(music stops)

903
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:25,845
Miho. What are you doing here?

904
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:28,890
What else?
It's so hard to see my husband these days,

905
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:30,517
so I brought a late-night snack.

906
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:33,603
MIHO: Okay.

907
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,191
Let's eat.

908
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:39,985
Here.

909
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:44,572
Eat up.

910
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:48,118
Hold on. Let me finish this first.

911
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:50,287
(keyboard clacking)

912
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:53,248
I'm so upset.
You've lost weight in just a few days.

913
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:56,918
Preparing for the debate,
I didn't have time to eat.

914
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:59,629
You're working hard enough.

915
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:02,257
You need to eat and sleep well
to do well on the debate.

916
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:03,758
I'm up against Choi Doha.

917
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:07,470
Without anything substantial, all-nighters
won't be enough to take him down.

918
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:14,686
(dramatic music)

919
00:55:14,769 --> 00:55:16,271
Here. Open up.

920
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:22,736
Isn't it good?

921
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:25,280
Yes, it is.

922
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:29,367
My wife makes the best gimbap
in all of Korea.

923
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:31,119
(chuckles)

924
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:35,040
Are you pulling another all-nighter here?

925
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:37,000
CHANGHO: Yes, I think I'll have to.

926
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:45,550
Let's see each other every day
no matter how busy you are.

927
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:54,726
We were apart for so long
while you were in the penitentiary.

928
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:57,562
It's not like we'll live together
for thousands of years.

929
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:07,572
Miho.

930
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:10,241
I'm sorry.

931
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:13,536
Once we finish what we've planned,

932
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:15,914
I'll stick by your side all the time.

933
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:19,125
CHANGHO: I'll follow you wherever you go.

934
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:25,965
We may not be able to live together
for thousands of years,

935
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:28,301
but we'll live together for about fifty.

936
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:32,597
I'll make it up to you
for everything I couldn't do. So...

937
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:36,184
don't be too upset.

938
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:40,939
(chuckles)

939
00:56:41,022 --> 00:56:42,816
I'm not upset.

940
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,361
Eat up.

941
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:57,789
(music rises)

942
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,844
(paper rustling)

943
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:12,929
(dramatic music)

944
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:16,808
(munching)

945
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:21,521
(sniffles)

946
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:28,820

CHOI DOHA
FOR THE FUTURE, RELIABLE MAYOR

952
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:52,927
CHAEBONG: Hey, Mayor Choi.

953
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:57,474
-Did you look into it?
-Yes.

954
00:57:57,557 --> 00:58:00,268
A few months ago,
there was a cryptocurrency fraud case.

955
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:03,646
We must band together
in times like these...

956
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,190
I hear you're Big Mouth.

957
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:08,276
WOMAN: You fraud. Give me back my money!

958
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:11,905
CHAEBONG: Park Changho represented
the plaintiffs and lost the trial.

959
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:15,825
The guy behind the fraud was caught
and is being investigated.

960
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:17,911
(suspenseful music)

961
00:58:18,953 --> 00:58:20,121
Who's the prosecutor?

962
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:22,582
Jeon Sooil.
He was at the Institute with Lee Doogeun.

963
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:24,042
CHAEBONG: I've met him before too.

964
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:33,718
What brings you here?

965
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:37,055
-DOOGEUN: Hey, Attorney Jeon.
-SOOIL: Hi. Sorry for making you wait.

966
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:40,266
Of course, I should wait.
I'm taking you away from your work.

967
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,393
-You have time to eat, right?
-Sure.

968
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:44,103
I made a reservation at a Japanese place.

969
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:45,605
-Let's go.
-You look good.

970
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:47,690
Are we having some shots then?

971
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:48,983
That's a given.

972
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:52,946
(ominous music)

973
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:55,615
-(door opens)
-(slurps)

974
00:58:57,909 --> 00:58:59,827
Hello, sir. I'm Jeon Sooil.

975
00:59:00,411 --> 00:59:02,539
Nice to meet you. Have a seat.

976
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:10,171
SOOIL:
You must be busy with your campaign.

977
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:11,673
I've ordered already.

978
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:15,385
I have another appointment,
so let's just eat.

979
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:17,387
Sure.

980
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:19,305
MAYOR CHOI: We can get to know each other
another time.

981
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:20,515
(smirks)

982
00:59:21,432 --> 00:59:24,519
-Can you help me?
-Excuse me?

983
00:59:24,602 --> 00:59:26,771
Don't say you'll decide
after you hear what it is.

984
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:28,731
Say whether or not you're willing.

985
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:32,360
If you're with me,
I'm positive you won't regret it.

986
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:37,699
(clears throat)

987
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:42,412
I'll help you.

988
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:43,997
(smirks)

989
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:47,375
You know Candidate Park Changho, right?
Independent and Number Four.

990
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:48,459
SOOIL: I do.

991
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:52,213
I want him to drop out of the race.

992
00:59:52,797 --> 00:59:54,799
-Pardon?
-I don't want him to finish the race,

993
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:57,594
let alone make it to the actual election.

994
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:00,555
What...

995
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:03,308
do I have to do?

996
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:08,229
Looks like
the prosecutor is taken care of.

997
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:09,355
What about the TV studio?

998
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:12,025
Chaebong is there as the representative.

999
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:17,447
MAN: Only the top three in ratings
can partake in the debate.

1000
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:20,867
The order and topics of debate are listed.

1001
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,702
What is this "citizens' representative"?

1002
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:26,456
It's as it says. Citizens will join
the panel and ask questions.

1003
01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:29,083
The questions aren't provided here.

1004
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:34,047
MAN: They will be impromptu questions
at the end of the program.

1005
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:37,258
The candidates should prepare thoroughly.

1006
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:40,386
This wasn't in previous debates.

1007
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:44,349
Do you have something to hide?
Why are you being so snippy?

1008
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:46,684
We have nothing to hide.

1009
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:48,895
SOONTAE: Just prepare your candidate.

1010
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:52,106
You may go bust if you're not careful.

1011
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:54,901
(snickers)

1012
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:58,154
I heard Park Changho's win rate
was less than 10 percent as a lawyer.

1013
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:01,074
How can he survive the debate
if he's so bad with words?

1014
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:04,285
-(Chaebong chuckles)
-MAN: Let's not do this here.

1015
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:07,121
Let your candidates duke it out
in front of the camera.

1016
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:09,624
Thanks for coming today.
See you at the debate.

1017
01:01:09,707 --> 01:01:12,543
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1018
01:01:13,378 --> 01:01:14,379
(door opens)

1019
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:16,547
(footsteps receding)

1020
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:19,676
(keypad clacking)

1021
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:21,010
(line dials)

1022
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:23,179
Hey. We just finished.

1023
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:24,847
(whispers)
Come here.

1024
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:27,767
CHAEBONG: Hold on.

1025
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:29,936
(whispers)
Come here.

1026
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:32,021
Take it. It's Mayor Choi.

1027
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:34,982
(tense music)

1028
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:36,234
Hello, sir.

1029
01:01:36,317 --> 01:01:38,986
You got the list of citizen reps, right?

1030
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:41,781
I did. I set it up as you ordered.

1031
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:43,783
(chuckles)

1032
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:46,536
Let's not even make eye contact
at the studio.

1033
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:48,913
We have to wait until after the elections
to grab a drink.

1034
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:51,332
-I'm counting on you.
-MAN: Understood.

1035
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:55,002
-Here you go.
-Okay. Thanks.

1036
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:56,671
-Good luck.
-Have a nice day.

1037
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:58,840
(exhales heavily)

1038
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:02,051
All I have to do now is pull the trigger.

1039
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:08,558
REPORTER 1: The prosecutor investigating
the five-billion cryptocurrency fraud case

1040
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:10,143
confirmed that the suspect Min

1041
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:13,187
had given a large sum of money
to Park Changho,

1042
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:16,357
who had represented
the plaintiffs at the time.

1043
01:02:17,191 --> 01:02:19,277
Min confessed during his interrogation

1044
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,279
that he gave Park Changho

1045
01:02:21,362 --> 01:02:25,158
five billion won
in exchange for losing the trial.

1046
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:26,492
(reporters clamoring)

1047
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:29,787
REPORTER 2: The controversies
surrounding Park Changho don't end here.

1048
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:33,207
Look at these burly men
bowing to Park Changho.

1049
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:37,170
We've discovered that these men
are members of a gang

1050
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:40,047
who were in the penitentiary with Park.

1051
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:44,427
Park Changho, who had made waves early on
by winning over the younger voters,

1052
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:46,637
being embroiled in these controversies...

1053
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:47,805
(phone beeps)

1054
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:51,851
(phone vibrating)

1055
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:56,147
-Hey.
-JIHOON: Choi Doha's behind this.

1056
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:57,440
I just confirmed it.

1057
01:02:58,524 --> 01:03:02,028
That was how he won the last election too,
by doing something similar

1058
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:04,280
and using a smear campaign.

1059
01:03:04,363 --> 01:03:06,365
(ominous music)

1060
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:09,118
-(phone beeps)
-It really is Choi Doha.

1061
01:03:09,702 --> 01:03:10,995
YOONGAB: No wonder.

1062
01:03:11,078 --> 01:03:13,456
I thought things were too quiet.

1063
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:16,209
He really is a rare breed of evil.

1064
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:19,170
SOONTAE: I'll press charges
for making false accusations.

1065
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:21,881
What's the point
if it is revealed after the election?

1066
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:24,509
KIKWANG: His reputation
would be in the gutter already.

1067
01:03:24,592 --> 01:03:25,885
Can you go on the TV debate?

1068
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:27,845
Isn't it better not to?

1069
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:30,848
The other candidates
will come at you like hounds.

1070
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:33,059
I can't win the election like this anyway.

1071
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:35,812
Do or die, I have to face it head-on.

1072
01:03:41,442 --> 01:03:43,444
(ominous music)

1073
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:50,660
(music stops)

1074
01:04:07,218 --> 01:04:09,220
(dramatic music)

1075
01:04:17,645 --> 01:04:19,313
(water running)

1076
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:23,109
(spits)

1077
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:24,527
(tap water stops)

1078
01:04:25,152 --> 01:04:27,154
(tense music)

1079
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:33,744
(sighs)

1080
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:35,413
CHANGHO: I'm up against Choi Doha.

1081
01:04:35,496 --> 01:04:39,166
Without anything substantial, all-nighters
won't be enough to take him down.

1082
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:41,377
(suspenseful music)

1083
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:43,629
KIKWANG:
I was worried, so I looked into it,

1084
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:46,507
and the pipes belong to a fish farm
in the area.

1085
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:49,218
Why does a fish farm need such big pipes?

1086
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:51,888
They illegally use
underground water there.

1087
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:55,725
Regardless, the chemical factory
has nothing to do with it, so don't worry.

1088
01:04:58,436 --> 01:04:59,604
(sighs)

1089
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,442
(music continues)

1090
01:05:53,115 --> 01:05:55,117
(music fades)

1091
01:06:04,752 --> 01:06:06,837
(muttering)

1092
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:08,297
Let me look at you.

1093
01:06:10,174 --> 01:06:11,175
MIHO: Good luck.

1094
01:06:11,258 --> 01:06:13,761
The people are watching.
Don't be nervous because of the cameras.

1095
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:15,346
You're coming, right?

1096
01:06:15,429 --> 01:06:18,307
You have the rehearsal and a lot to prep.
I'll be there for the debate.

1097
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:19,600
(Kikwang chuckles)

1098
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:23,688
Let's go.

1099
01:06:24,522 --> 01:06:25,898
I'll bring Miho later.

1100
01:06:29,276 --> 01:06:30,319
(door opens)

1101
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:33,698
-(door closes)
-Did you look into it?

1102
01:06:33,781 --> 01:06:37,201
I did, and it really is suspicious
as you said.

1103
01:06:37,284 --> 01:06:39,370
(tense music)

1104
01:06:39,453 --> 01:06:42,123
JERRY: From the outside,
it looks like any other fish farm,

1105
01:06:42,623 --> 01:06:45,459
but security is intense.
It's not like anyone would steal fish.

1106
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:49,296
And the owner is a guy named Mr. Ko.

1107
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:51,674
He was NK Chemical's head of security
until a few years ago.

1108
01:06:53,217 --> 01:06:54,218
NK Chemical?

1109
01:06:54,301 --> 01:06:57,013
Yes. He has
absolutely no connection to fish.

1110
01:06:58,055 --> 01:06:59,557
How many people work there?

1111
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:02,268
Including the guards and workers,
about 15 or so.

1112
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:05,938
I need to get into that fish farm.

1113
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:07,356
Get into it? For what?

1114
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,025
Please gather some people right now.

1115
01:07:10,651 --> 01:07:12,653
(music intensifies)

1116
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:15,656
(tires screeching)

1117
01:07:27,251 --> 01:07:28,711
(music stops)

1118
01:07:32,798 --> 01:07:36,552
We brought our tools
since you said it was an emergency.

1119
01:07:36,635 --> 01:07:39,388
Good. Listen up.

1120
01:07:39,972 --> 01:07:43,100
We'll be doing the most important thing
for this election.

1121
01:07:43,684 --> 01:07:46,187
MIHO: If this mission is a success,
we'll win the election.

1122
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:48,064
If we fail, we'll lose the election.

1123
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:51,317
Don't think about the aftermath.
Focus only on what's in front of you.

1124
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,194
Are we on our way to crushing someone?

1125
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:56,864
Yes, we are. Come with me.

1126
01:07:57,990 --> 01:07:58,949
CHUNSIK: Let's go.

1127
01:07:59,033 --> 01:07:59,992
MEN: Yes, Boss!

1128
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:07,416
(tense music)

1129
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:14,048
MAYORAL DEBATE

1130
01:08:15,966 --> 01:08:17,009
NO. 4, INDEPENDENT
PARK CHANGHO

1131
01:08:29,021 --> 01:08:31,816
Speak in the order
of your candidate ratings,

1132
01:08:31,899 --> 01:08:34,068
and reverse order of ratings
for your introductions.

1133
01:08:34,151 --> 01:08:35,820
Mr. Park, you'll go first.

1134
01:08:36,862 --> 01:08:37,905
MAN: We're going live.

1135

01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:12,273
(closing theme music)

1148
01:09:30,249 --> 01:09:33,043
BIG MOUTH

1149
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:34,503
CHANGHO: That's fake news.

1150
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:37,047
MAYOR CHOI: If it's true,
will you withdraw from the election?

1151
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:39,425
MIHO: Load up everything
that can be used as evidence.

1152
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:41,760
You have to stop them.
Those are bombs they're bringing.

1153
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:42,761
MAYOR CHOI: Go ahead.

1154
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:45,389
See if you can get any of it proven.

1155
01:09:45,472 --> 01:09:46,807
CHANGHO: How will you pay for your sins?

1156
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:49,727
Don't apologize. You won't be forgiven.

1157
01:09:49,810 --> 01:09:51,937
But even if you are Big Mouse,

1158
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:53,898
you're no match for me.

1159
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:55,024
MIHO: It'll all be revealed soon.

1160
01:09:55,107 --> 01:09:57,610
I'm not here as Mr. Park Changho's wife,

1161
01:09:58,194 --> 01:10:00,112
but as a victim of the radiation

1162
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:01,864
leaked by NK Chemical.
