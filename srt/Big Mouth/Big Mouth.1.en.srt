THIS SHOW IS A WORK OF FICTION.

4
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,049
THE EVENTS AND ENTITIES
THAT APPEAR HEREIN ARE FICTIONAL.

17
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:32,694
REPORTER 1: Breaking news.

18
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:34,988
It has been revealed
that the private placement

19
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:37,782
stolen by Big Mouse
belonged to members of NR Forum.

20
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,285
The loss amounted to 100 billion won.

21
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:44,998
REPORTER 2: The head of the Asian
distributor of drugs produced in Colombia

22
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,834
was uncovered to be Big Mouse.

23
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,043
(people clamoring)

24
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:53,131
REPORTER 3: It has been confirmed
that Big Mouse was involved

25
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,550
with the gangsters enforcing
the new city apartments program.

26
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:56,634
(mice chittering)

27
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,178
REPORTER 4:
The Prosecutors' Office and the police

28
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,888
formed a joint bureau to catch Big Mouse.

29
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:02,557
-REPORTER 5: Billions of won...
-REPORTER 6: The organized crime ring

30
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,852
with the largest distribution
of burner phones and unregistered cars

31
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:09,522
turned out to be associated
with Big Mouse.

32
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,399
REPORTER 7:
...distributing illegal drugs...

33

35
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:22,410
REPORTER 9: A large city with nine rivers,
in the top ten for population in Korea.

36
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:26,331
People call it beautiful,
marvelous, and peaceful.

NINE RIVERS FORUM
NEW YEAR'S EVE GALA

39
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,421
(upbeat music)

40
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:35,590
CHANGHO: But did you know?

41
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,593
Most of the people who call it that

42
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:41,471
are the privileged
who were born into money.

43
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:47,560
What looks happy from a distance
may be tragic up close.

44
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:50,855
And that's the case here.

45
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,066
If you look closely,

46
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:56,402
it's rotten to the core
with all sorts of crime and corruption.

47
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,321
MAN: Guarantee our rights!

SAVE GUCHEON IMMEDIATELY

49
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:04,160
CHANGHO: But most of the people
can't tell apart good versus evil.

50
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,038
They're not interested
in social matters at all.

51
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:10,041
Why not? Because they're too busy
trying to make a living.

52
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,086
(upbeat music)

53
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,929
My goal in life is very simple.

54
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,889
Becoming successful

55
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,725
and living a long happy life
with my loving family.

56
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:29,435
Social justice?

57
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:32,522
What a load of bull.

58
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,442
(muffled knock on door)

59
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,613
(serene music)

60
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:45,702
What is this?

61
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:53,835
EPISODE 1

62
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,461
MIHO: I said I wanted pork belly.

63
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,131
We can't afford to eat this crap here.

64
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:00,216
It's our wedding anniversary.
The day we got married.

65
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,387
It's bigger crap to eat pork belly at home
on such a momentous day. Right, Father?

66
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,223
Of course. And he's a lawyer after all.

67
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:11,144
The loan principal is 259 million won,
with 7.8 million per month in interest.

68
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:15,315
Do you realize our debt grows
with every passing minute, Mr. Lawyer?

69
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,652
CHANGHO: Open wide. It's delicious.

70
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,195
Good girl. That's it.

71
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,739
(laughs)

72
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:28,745
Just wait. You'll see my face
everywhere on TV soon.

73
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,913
You're all talk.

74
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,875

75
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,001
PROSECUTOR CHO DONGHWA

76
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:36,711
Hello?

77
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:38,087
Mr. Cho?

78
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,090
I'm Park Changho, defense counsel
for the Gucheon Hospital murder.

79
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:44,594
It's important,
so I'd like to speak with you in person.

80
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,349
Okay, I'll see you there.

81
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,310
You're handling the Gucheon Hospital case?

82
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:55,021
I heard big names were involved.

83
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:58,691
I've already paid the tab including tip,
so make sure to stay for dessert.

84
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,403
-Then give me that.
-Sure.

85
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:05,823
Even so, it's your anniversary.
You should stay a little longer.

86
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,202
Congrats on marrying me, babe.

87
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:13,373
Come home early.
Let's have some wine at home.

88
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:14,999
I will.

89
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:20,129

90
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,214

92
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:25,426
(chuckles)

93
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,303
(Changho sighs loudly)

94
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:34,769
Leaving so soon?

95
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:37,105
(indistinct background chatter)

96
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,732
Drink this on your way.

97
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,026
Thank you.

98
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:45,279
(suspenseful music)

00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,198

BIG MOUTH

108
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:35,037
7 DAYS EARLIER

109
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,249
(alarm blaring)

110
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:39,625
(groans)

111
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,004
I told you to change your alarm.

112
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:45,631
(groans loudly)

113
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:51,262
Why do you set it to that?
It's so annoying.

114
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:53,181
Out of my way. Move.

115
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,725
(groans, grunts)

116
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:56,893
(blaring continues)

117
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,812
Ouch, my back. I hurt my back.

118
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,105
Get up, you have a busy day.

119
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,024
I think I'm really hurt.

120
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,735
Give it up. You can't fool me.

121
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,403
Get up.

122
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,571
(Miho groans)

123
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:10,531
-(groans)
-(door closes)

124
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:13,284
CHANGHO: I slept well.

125
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,119
Miho. Gosh.

126
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,290
(cheerful music)

127
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:21,375
Here.

128
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,296
This stuff for women feel much nicer.

129
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,131
"Eye cream."

130
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,763
(gasps)
Hey!

131
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,474
-(yelps)
-Do you know how much this costs?

132
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:37,892
(mutters)

133
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:41,062
This is eye cream.
How could you use up so much?

134
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:44,065
I only use this much at a time.

135
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,399
I only used a little.

136
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,776
What a waste.

137
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,861
(cheerful music)

138
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,155
(hair dryer whirring)

139
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,701
CHANGHO: Miho. Help me with my tie.

140
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,496
-What?
-My tie. It's weird.

141
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,289
MIHO: I'm busy.

142
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,500
But my tie...

143
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,795
Something's off with this tie.

144
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:08,714
(whirring stops)

00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,846
-What time is the trial?
-At 10am.

147
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,975
You'd better get that money back.
Don't make me turn into a prick about it.

148
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,268
You worry too much.

149
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:23,604
Try to find a lawyer in Korea
who knows this case better than I do.

150
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,690
A lawyer shouldn't brag
about being scammed.

151
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,359
Anyway, if you lose the trial,

152
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,737
don't even think
about coming into my house. Got that?

153
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,031
What's this?

154
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,701
Hey, why is this your house? It's mine.

155
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:39,287
What were you doing
while he was getting scammed, Dad?

156
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,955
What an office manager.

157
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:42,081
We'll be late. Let's go.

158

CHANGHO:
I can't even talk to Miho anymore.

160

She's always under the weather.

161
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,673
MIHO'S FATHER:
Try putting yourself in her shoes.

162
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,466
She worked to death and saved up,

163
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,678
only to have you take it
without her knowledge and get scammed.

164
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,054
Wouldn't you be pissed off?

165
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,889
MIHO'S FATHER: When I was a detective,

00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,350
I even saw a murder case
between spouses over stuff like this.

167
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,519
Don't say something so frightening.

168
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,271
Hey.

169
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,483
You greased up to Judge Yoon, right?

170
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,068
It cost a lot.

171
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:14,780
You absolutely cannot tell Miho
that I borrowed from a loan shark.

172
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,824
It'll be fine if we win the case.

173
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,534
MIHO'S FATHER: Let's just win first.

174
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:21,162
Let's do this.

175
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:25,708
(crowd murmuring)

176
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,835
(whispers)
Hey.

177
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,923
Were they always
the defendant's attorneys?

178
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,635
Right? It looks like
they got a new law firm.

179
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,637
OFFICER: All rise.

180
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,145
Please be seated.

181
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,440
MIHO'S FATHER (whispers): Hey.

182
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,194
That's not Judge Yoon. What's going on?

183
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:54,362
I don't know.

184
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,530
JUDGE: Case number 2021-4576.

185
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:59,075
Judge Yoon Sangsoo was removed
from the case,

186
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,035
so I will take over from here on.

187
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,620
Why was he removed?

188
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,538
Case number 2021-4576.

189
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:07,708
I'll deliver the decision
on the cryptocurrency damages case.

190
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,126
Your Honor, please tell us why...

191
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,211
JUDGE: Counsel.

192
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,173
One more out of you,
and you'll be removed from the courtroom.

193
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,384
(crowd murmuring)

194
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:23,974
OFFICER: Quiet!

195
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,310
(sighs)

196
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,020
WOMAN: Hey! You!

197
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:31,232
-You jerk!
-MAN: Hey!

198
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,901
You said we'd win
and not to trust a big law firm!

199
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,404
WOMAN: What will you do now?
What will you do about our money?

200
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,197
Wait! Hold on!

201
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,408
He's a victim as well.

202
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:43,411
Let's calm down a little and talk it out.

203
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,454
Everyone!

204
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,997
We will appeal. I promise.

205
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,417
We must band together
in times like these...

206
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,210
I hear you're Big Mouth.

207
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:52,670
What?

208
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,964
I hear your nickname is Big Mouth

209
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,758
because you run your mouth
without the skills to back it up!

210
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,094
(scoffs)
That's absurd.

211
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,887
WOMAN: You fraud.

212
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,639
Give me back my money!

213
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,892
-Do you know how hard I worked?
-Please stop!

214
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,562
-WOMAN: What will you do now?
-Don't take my father-in-law away!

215
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,605
-WOMAN: Give me my money!
-Hold on!

216
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,983
-Darn it.
-You're going to kill my son-in-law!

217
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,735
Stop it. You'll kill him.

218
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,653
(clamoring)

219
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:21,657
NURSE: I heard
your husband was a hotshot lawyer.

220
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,325
Is that a big deal?

221
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,618
Of course, it is.

222
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:28,164
If my husband were a lawyer,
I would've quit long ago.

223
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,416
I would've quit already
if I were doing it for the money.

224
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,170
It's a noble job
working with people's lives.

225
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:37,423
What other job is there where
we can call ourselves angels in white?

226
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:40,217
You're so cool. I need to learn from you.

227
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,719
Don't be silly.

228
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,220
(giggles)

229
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,931
The trial should be over by now.

230
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,392
(Changho sighs)

231
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,189
You knew that my nickname was Big Mouth,
didn't you?

232
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,818
MIHO'S FATHER: They're spewing nonsense,
so don't mind them.

233
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,404
Maybe I should quit being a lawyer.

234
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,909
I won't stop you.

235
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:09,288
But you should pay me
my back pay that you owe me.

236
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,749
-Oh, dear.
-(laughs)

237
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,292
I have a call.

238
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,835
(phone vibrating)

239
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,629
MADAM

240
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:20,299
I'm too scared to answer. You do it.

241
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,759
She scares me, too.

242
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:25,304
Don't be silly. She's your daughter.
Hurry up and answer it.

243
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:27,473
-She's just like her mom.
-Please.

244
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:34,605
MIHO: How did the trial go?

245
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:38,025
What? So we can't get
any of our money back?

246
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:44,907
(breathes heavily)

247
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,992
This was why I said
to hire a separate lawyer.

248
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,495
MIHO: How will we pay
this month's interest?

249
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:52,206
How will we fix
the water leaking to the unit below?

250
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:55,376
(clears throat)
Should I switch over to divorce law?

251
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:58,003
-I hear that's lucrative these days...
-Good idea.

252
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,798
Prepare my divorce papers for me.
I'll pay you well.

253
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:03,759
Come on, Miho.
Don't joke like that. That hurts.

254
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,094
MIHO: Want to see how hurt I am?

255
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,263
My heart is tattered because of you.

256
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,348
(sighs deeply)

257
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:13,602
Bring the documents tonight.
I can't live with you any longer.

258
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:18,357
Fine, let's do it.
Let's get divorced. Fine.

259
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,608
Are you insane?

260
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:24,029
If we do, I'm living with Father-in-law,
and that's that.

261
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,407
-What?
-I can break up with you,

262
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,700
but not with him.

263
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,870
He depends on me more than you anyway.

264
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,746
Isn't that right?

265
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,040
Don't drag me into your fight.

266
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,333
MIHO: You want to die?

267
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:39,378
Do you think I'll be scared and back down
if you use my dad as a shield?

268
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,505
Ms. Ko?

269
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,591
(quirky music)

270
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,262
I'll see you at home.
Please bring the documents.

271
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,598
Yes, ma'am.

272
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,099
(phone beeps)

273
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:56,604
Hey. Are you insane?
Why are you bringing up divorce?

274
00:14:57,271 --> 00:15:00,482
(sighs)
I know. Why did I do that?

275
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,027
SEOLLEONGTANG, DOGANITANG

276
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,820
SOONTAE: Divorce? Yeah, right.

277
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:08,032
If you two get divorced,
no couple in Korea would stay married.

278
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,786
CHANGHO: Hey. Do I seem that incompetent
in your eyes too?

279
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,205
I have a high IQ
and I'm pretty confident in my physique.

280
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,625
I know. You were on the track team
throughout high school.

281
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:21,378
Right. So what's wrong with me
to have ended up like this?

282
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,464
Something huge.
You have no money or connections.

283
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:27,468
Does not having money or connections
mean I have to lose my lawsuits?

284
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:29,094
Why is that my problem?

285
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,013
Law and society are what's messed up.

286
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:34,183
I should just... Hey. Listen to me.

287
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:37,186
Should I deceive people
and threaten them like others do?

288
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,687
Will I become successful then?

289
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,607
Don't become pessimistic too.
You'll really be depressed.

290
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,902
-(sighs deeply)
-(phone vibrates)

291
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:52,451
INTEREST OF 15,280,000 WON HAS ACCRUED
ON YOUR LOAN OF 259,000,000 WON.

292
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:56,080
-Shoot.
-SOONTAE: You don't like it?

293
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:57,539
Not eating that?

294
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:01,502
(Changho groans)

295
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:06,048
(phone ringing)

296
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,303
OPERATOR: The person you have reached
is not available.

297
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,764
-(scoffs)
-Please leave a message...

298
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,808
-He's screening my calls now?
-(phone beeps)

299
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:20,729
(sighs)
Mr. Park. You're asking for it.

300
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,315
Seriously.

301
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,195
(gulping)

302
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,116
(exhales)
What is that?

303
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,409
What?

304
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,285
What's in that bag?

305
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:37,371
What? This bag?

306
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:39,415
MIHO'S FATHER: Nothing. It's just a bag.

307
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:43,460
I should throw out what I don't wear.
They take up too much room.

308
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,630
MIHO: Is it me or Changho?

309
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,007
MIHO'S FATHER: What?

310
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,175
Whom will you live with if we break up?

311
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:54,221
How could you talk about things
like breaking up and choosing?

312
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,976
You're tough and will be fine on your own,

313
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,311
but Changho can't live without me.

314
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:04,773
What? Aren't I your daughter?

315
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,442
Was I found on the street or something?

316
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,818
Whatever.

317
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,611
-Dad!
-(door opens)

318
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,696
(door closes)

319
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:12,573
Seriously.

320
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:14,908
(scoffs)

321
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,286
It's like I'm the daughter-in-law.

322
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,082
(quirky music)

323
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,011
Father-in-law!

324
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:39,808
(Miho's father grunts)

325
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,519
-(muttering)
-(zipper rasps)

326
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,063
You packed my underwear, right?

327
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:46,356
What about Miho?

328
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,692
She's waiting to kill you
when you come home,

329
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,360
while drinking soju.

330
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:56,325
I'll stay in the office
for the time being.

331
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,619
If you'd talk to her for me...

332
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:01,288
Whatever. I'm about to get kicked out too
because of you.

333
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,873
Please.

334
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,458
(phone ringing)

335
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,793
Excuse me. Do you mind?

336
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,461
-MIHO'S FATHER: Sure.
-Thank you.

337
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,048
Hello?

338
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,466
MAN: Are you Park Changho?

339
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,635
Yes, I am. Who's this?

340
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:16,637
I'm Choi Doha, the mayor of Gucheon.

341
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,935
Yes, Mayor. How may I help you?

342
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,105
I want to hire you for a criminal case.

343
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:28,440
Can we meet right now?

344
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,318
(mutters)

345
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,531
(ominous music)

346
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,418
(suspenseful music)

347
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,763
(mutters)

348
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:03,016
Why are we meeting here? It's scary.

349
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:04,852
CHANGHO: What was that?

350
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,396
Is this the right place?

351
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,418
(tires screech)

352
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:45,058
(music fades)

353
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,520
(crickets chirping)

354
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,273
(grunts)

355
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,321
Excuse me. Mayor Choi Doha?

356
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,907
MAYOR CHOI: I'm glad you found your way.
Have a seat.

357
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,283
Yes, sir.

358
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,332
Sorry for asking to meet
on such short notice.

359
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,334
It's fine.

360
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:14,671
I got your call as soon as I got done
with an important meeting.

361
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,883
I should have a business card somewhere.

362
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,176
MAYOR CHOI: I don't need one.

363
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,470
Have some coffee.

364
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,434
CHANGHO: Thank you.

365
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,187
I'll get to the point.

366
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:34,399
Have you heard
of the Gucheon University Hospital murder?

367
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,778
Yes, I heard about it on the news.

368
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:41,281
The people involved
are all people that I know.

369
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,367
(ominous music)

370
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,620
(tires screeching)

371
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,998
-(screams)
-MAYOR CHOI: There was a car accident,

372
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,417
and the body of a doctor was in the trunk.

373
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,962
Those in the car
were Han Jaeho, a surgeon,

374
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,880
Lee Doogeun,
the hospital's in-house attorney,

375
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,300
and Jung Chaebong, the son of the chair
of the Gucheon University Foundation.

376
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,636
They were arrested at the scene
as prime suspects.

377
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,305
You killed him.

378
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,266
You were having an affair
with Jaeyoung's wife.

379
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:10,269
Did you see me do anything with her?

380
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,895
INTERROGATOR: You're not here to fight.

381
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:15,107
To be honest, Doogeun,
you were the one who wanted to kill him.

382
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:18,151
Everyone at the hospital knows
you were fighting over medical disputes.

383
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:21,154
I wasn't the one fighting with him,
Dr. Han was.

384
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,532
They were fighting
for the position of hospital director.

385
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,285
And in whose car was the body found?

386
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,078
It was Dr. Han's car!

387
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:29,288
-Hey!
-What?

388
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,956
-DR. HAN: Are you done?
-What?

389
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,291
-You...
-Enough.

390
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,500
-Stop it.
-Hey.

391
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,627
MAYOR CHOI:
They're accusing each other of the murder,

392
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:38,130
and they all had convincing motives.

393
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,592
CHANGHO: But how did you get my number?

394
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:46,263
You're surrounded by lawyers.
Why me? We've never even met before.

395
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:49,266
Your win rate is less than 10%.

396
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,979
MAYOR CHOI: You became a lawyer
but got no offers from law firms.

397
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:56,481
You had to start your own practice,
but you're always in debt.

398
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:57,733
Excuse me.

399
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,320
I'll be honest.

400
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:04,406
When they asked me
to choose a lawyer for them,

401
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:06,116
they had some conditions.

402
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:09,911
The lawyer must be incompetent
and obedient.

403
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:15,375
(ominous music)

404
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:16,585
(scoffs)

405
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,754
I don't quite follow.

406
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,131
They've already
planned out their own trial.

407
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:23,550
They've bought over the judges
to an extent as well.

408
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,218
In other words,

409
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,681
you need a front man, not an attorney.

410
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:33,727
(music stops)

411
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,812
(exhales)
It's not too enticing.

412
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,814
And I feel like
I'd be getting my hands dirty.

413
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:39,691
CHANGHO: I'll go now.

414
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:43,653
MAYOR CHOI: The dashcam video
from the accident disappeared.

415
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,739
(suspenseful music)

416
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:52,829
If we find that,

417
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:56,500
we can figure out
who murdered Professor Seo.

418
00:22:57,334 --> 00:23:00,128
Didn't you want to help them?

419
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,797
They want to be acquitted,

420
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,216
but I want the truth.

421
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,595
Do you believe me now?

422
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:13,809
Well, it sounds like
they have something huge on you.

423
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:20,190
MAYOR CHOI: They played a major role
in getting me elected mayor.

424
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:22,943
But they try to butt in
on every government matter.

425
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,987
I plan to cut them off entirely
through this.

426
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:27,656
In other words,

427
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:32,160
you want me to be a double agent
pretending to help them.

428
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:37,290
This is from me personally.

429
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:43,880
(scoffs)

430
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:48,051
I think my fees are higher than this.

431
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:51,012
A famous American artist once said,

432
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,557
"First, become famous.

433
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:57,227
Then people will applaud
even when you poop."

434
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:01,189
You've heard of NR Forum, right?
Nine Rivers Forum.

435
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:04,234
The late Professor Seo and the suspects

436
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,611
are members there.

437
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,697
(dramatic music)

438
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:13,243
A righteous lawyer
who fights against Goliath.

439
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:16,997
It would look good in my opinion.

440
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:27,382
(water ripples)

441
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:30,093
(dramatic music continues)

442
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:36,224
(rod rattling)

443
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:45,066
(music intensifies)

444
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:52,157
(phone line ringing)

445
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,242

447
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,249
SOONTAE: Hi, Changho.

448
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:02,751
Where are you?

449
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,503
In the office. I'm about to head home.

450
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:06,880
I'm heading your way.
Let's meet for a bit.

451
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,346
NR Forum? They're all big shots.

452
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:18,350
Hey. I'll pay you back nicely
once I become famous, so help me.

453
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,354
There's something I do
to get a big alimony...

462
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:41,141
Excuse me.

463
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:45,854
Sir. Is this really... I don't think...

464
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,939

RÉSUMÉ
PARK CHANGHO

469
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:17,385
(Doogeun scoffs)
He hardly won any cases.

470
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:21,222
How does he survive as a lawyer
with these skills?

471
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:24,100
That twerp Mayor Choi did his research.

472
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,977
It must've been hard
to find someone like that.

473
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:29,439
This is an Italian wine,
Amilano Barolo Liste.

474
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:31,232
It should be to your liking.

475
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,401
Warden Park, cigar.

476
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:34,986
Yes, sir.

477
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:38,156
Okay.

478
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:39,991

(laughs)

486
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:22,158
Your attorney is here.

487
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:25,036
Take your time and speak comfortably.

488
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,579
-Okay.
-DOOGEUN: Thanks.

489
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,214
(distant footsteps receding)

490
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:41,094
Don't just stand there. Have a seat.

491
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:42,387
Yes, sir.

492
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,141
I'm Park Changho.

493
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,853
CHANGHO: Let me give you my card.

494
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:53,022

495
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:00,447
LAW OFFICE OF PARK CHANGHO

00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,741
(Changho sighs)

497
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:07,078
I'm class 37 at the Institute of Justice.
I can speak casually, right?

498
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:10,039
Yes, of course. There's no need
for any of you to be formal.

499
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:13,376
The mayor filled you in, right?

500
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,961
Yes, sir.

501
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:17,714
He said my win rate won't go down
if I do as I'm told.

502
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:22,343
(laughter)

503
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:25,638
Here. It's all in here.

504
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:28,141
The strategy for the trial, our alibis,

505
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:30,101
flaws in the prosecution's case,

506
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:33,229
and even the statements
you'll make in court.

507
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:34,939
Yes, sir.

508
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,816
(suspenseful music)

509
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,027
(sighs)

510
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,570
Aren't you going to read it?

511
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:43,656
You'll probably have many questions.

512
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,909
Why would I?

513
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:48,745
All I need to do is follow the script
that you've prepared.

514
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,664
(laughter)

515
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,249
Do you and Cho Donghwa get along?

516
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:55,585
CHAEBONG: You know he's the prosecutor
on the case, right?

517
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:56,669
CHANGHO: Yes, I do.

518
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:59,130
He's a star prosecutor.
I don't know him personally.

519
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:00,882
I'm a nobody after all.

520
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,676
DOOGEUN: Come on.
It's not hard to become somebody.

521
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,596
Handle a couple of big cases
and go on TV once,

522
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:08,389
and you'll be respected.

523
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:10,642
(sighs)

524
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:13,478
I want to bring honor to my family.

525
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:15,355
Please help me, sirs.

526
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:19,567
CHAEBONG (chuckles): Okay.

527
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,277
He's cute.

528
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:23,571
Sure is.

529
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,698
(phone ringing)

530
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:28,576
Hello?

531
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,079
CHAEBONG: Gosh.

532
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:35,124
To what do we owe the pleasure, Mayor?

533
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,837
(ominous music)

534
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,921
A tip?

535
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,802
SOONTAE: Is this the Prosecutors' Office?

536
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:49,639
I have a tip
about the Gucheon Hospital murder.

537
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:53,184
WOMAN: I need to check your identity.
What is your name?

538
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:56,354
My name is Oh Sungsik. I'm an attorney.

539
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:59,774
CHAEBONG: There was no dashcam in the car.

540
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,151
Who's lying about something
that doesn't exist?

541
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:03,695
Who called in the tip?

542
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,782
What? A lawyer?

543
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:12,078
Okay. I'll check and get back to you.

544
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,791
(chuckles)

545
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:20,795
CHANGHO: Please call me
if you need me to do anything.

546
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:22,672
I'll be off then.

547
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:26,926
(suspenseful music)

-(device beeps)
-(door opens)

551
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:45,236
CHAEBONG: You gave the dashcam video
to your wife, right?

552
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,196
DR. HAN: Why? Is there a problem?

553
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:49,699
CHAEBONG: Call her right now.

554
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:51,784
OFFICER: Let's go.

555
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:52,869
Okay.

556
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,623
DR. HAN: She's filming her cooking show.
I can't reach her.

557
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,959
This is driving me nuts.

558
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,294
Dr. Han.

559
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,838
Did your wife have a change of heart?

560
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,007
DR. HAN:
What the hell are you talking about?

561
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,843
How did a lawyer named Oh Sungsik
know about the dashcam video?

562
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,262
The three of us and your wife
are the only ones who know.

563
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:13,598
So? Does the prosecutor have it?

564
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,308
I don't know.

565
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:17,644
CHAEBONG:
I think it was just a tip as of now.

566
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:20,730
Shouldn't we get rid of the video?

567
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,440
Are you stupid?

568
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:25,318
That's our insurance policy.

569
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:28,196
We're the only ones who'll go down
if that jerk changes his mind.

570
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:30,698
(door closes)

00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,537
Inspectors are here from headquarters.

573
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,872
Please return to your cells.

574
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:43,878
(ominous music)

575
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:50,134
Insurance policy?
Is there another accomplice?

Go on.

580
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,409
Dr. Han's wife has the dashcam video.

581
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,494
(upbeat music)

582
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,413
Are you sure?

583
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,873
Yes. I bugged them and recorded it.

584
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:23,418
She's filming some cooking show right now.

585
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,962
But Mayor.

586
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:29,048
I think there's another accomplice.

587
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,552
Send me the recording.

588
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:34,470
Okay. I'll go to you now.

589
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:35,638
No.

590
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:38,099
I'll go see her myself.

591
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:39,767
(phone beeps)

592
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:51,362
Even children
who don't like vegetables will like this,

593
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,322
so try making it at home.

594
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:56,284
I'll be back
with an even tastier dish next time.

595
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,869
Thank you.

Excuse me. Do you know
where Professor Jang Hyejin is?

607
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,830
Her shoot's over, so she left.

Someone come help!

I haven't thanked the two of you yet.

00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:50,189
You're an attorney? Did my husband...

632
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,817
Where did you hide the dashcam footage
from the accident?

633
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,902
(ominous music)

634
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:57,446
What do you mean? What dashcam footage?

635
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:00,158
Your husband said he gave it to you.

636
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,582
(tense music)

637
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:11,460
You seem to be mistaken. I don't...

638
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,343
CHAEBONG: You gave the dashcam video
to your wife, right?

DR. HAN: She's filming her cooking show...

642
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:29,061
Withholding evidence for a murder case
will get you three years minimum.

Where is the dashcam video?

647
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,974
There's another accomplice, isn't there?

648
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:11,771
That's what it sounded like

Gong Jihoon.

652
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:21,364
Gong Jihoon?

MAYOR CHOI:
He's the president of a newspaper.

and grandson of Chairman Gong Taemin.

You stupid moron!

MAYOR CHOI: He and the late Professor Seo
were on terrible terms.

661
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,230
That's shocking.

662
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:57,566
That the biggest highroller in Korea
is a murderer.

663
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,986
I have an urgent meeting,
so you'll have to go without me.

664
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,989
Bring the dashcam video to me

Yeah. We put the body in the trunk.

745
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:00,726
There will be huge repercussions
if this gets out.

Shoot. These annoying spam texts
come at any time of the day.

752
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:22,748
Why? Are you waiting for Changho to call?

753
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:25,417
Has he lost his mind?
He hasn't even called for days.

754
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:27,127
Does he really want to end it or what?

755
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,546
That's how cornered he feels.

756
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:31,632
He's been eating cup noodles
every day at the office.

757
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,927
(sighs)
He's already so skinny.

758
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,720
What's wrong with you?

759
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:39,807
You're his father-in-law.
You should make sure he eats well.

760
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,726
All I ever eat is rice and water
at home, too.

-Who is it at this hour?
-Who else?

765
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,027
He can't hold out for that long.

Who are you?

00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:06,166
MAN: We're from the Gucheon Court.

773
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,168
The court? What is this about?

774
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:12,381
We will now seize any personal property
as requested by Bobae Capital.

775
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:14,049
Seize property?

776
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:16,135
MIHO'S FATHER: Wait.

777
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:17,845
Who are you?

778
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:20,347
Why are you walking in here
with your shoes on?

779
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:22,975
Hello, sir.

780
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:25,352
MIHO'S FATHER: There are seizure stickers
all over our home.

781
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:26,854
Seizure?

782
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:28,272
That loan shark you borrowed from.

783
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:33,110
These guys just barged in
as soon as we opened the door...

(door opens)

785
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:38,532
MIHO: You borrowed from a loan shark?

786
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,284
Are you trying to ruin our family?

787
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:42,911
-What are you going to do about this?
-(line cuts)

788
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:45,664
Hello? Changho. Hello?

789
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:48,834
Did he hang up?

790
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:52,087
That irresponsible punk.

791
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:54,798
You knew, didn't you?

792
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:56,467
What?

793
00:43:56,550 --> 00:44:00,012
You should've stopped him.
Am I the only normal one here?

794
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:01,889
Why are you both so reckless?

795
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:05,309
He talked big, that he could pay it off
once we won the trial...

796
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:07,895
Whatever. You're equally responsible.

797
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:10,105
MIHO'S FATHER: Hey.

798

799
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:14,026

00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:51,146
MAYOR CHOI DOHA

813
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,315
(upbeat music)

814
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:56,485
MAYOR CHOI: A righteous lawyer
who fights against Goliath.

815
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:59,905
It would look good in my opinion.

816
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:02,991
CHANGHO: It would look good indeed.

817
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:04,993
But why would I do that?

818
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:07,121
Because fame equals cash.

819
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:09,957
It's all about money in the end.

820
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,334
MAYOR CHOI DOHA

821
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:15,504
(phone vibrating)

822
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:17,589
(suspenseful music)

823
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,635
OPERATOR: The person you have reached...

PARK CHANGHO

825
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:32,855
(music fades)

826
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:37,443
-(door closes)
-(alarm chimes)

827
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:42,906
(sighs deeply)

828
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:46,076
(Miho's father exhales)

829
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:49,163
Hey.

830
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:53,250
Are you insane? Why did you come home?
You should be running away.

831
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:55,377
(chuckles)
Is Miho asleep?

832
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:57,713
Miho. Honey.

833
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:05,804
Was my baby crying?

834
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:07,806
(Changho mutters)

835
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:09,975
Don't worry, babe.
I'll take care of this in no time.

836
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:11,059
I'll fix it.

837
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:13,854
You annoying jerk.

838
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:17,024
-Why I...
-Hey. Stop.

839
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:19,151
Hey, that's a criminal offense...

840
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:21,653
It's five years in prison
and a fine of seven million won.

841
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:23,197
-Right?
-Yes, that's right.

842
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:26,658
(pot clangs)

843
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:30,954
Miho, this is chicken.

844
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,164
CHANGHO: And take this.

845
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:34,792
Do you think I want to eat right now?

846
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,878
MIHO'S FATHER: It's money.

847
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:40,255
(smirks)

848
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,470
Where did you get this?

849
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:49,306
Where else would a lawyer get money?
I didn't knock over an ATM.

850
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:51,642
MIHO: How much is all this?

851
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:54,645
That's just the retainer.
Yes, the retainer.

852
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:56,647
What's the case
that the retainer was in cash?

853
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:58,482
It's a huge case.
That's all you need to know.

854
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:00,901
I'm tired. I need to wash up.

855
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:02,194
Here. The chicken.

856
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:03,862
MIHO: Wait.

857
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:06,990
Why did they hire you of all people
for a huge case?

858
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,492
(sighs)
Miho.

859
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:10,744
I may not have connections,
but I've got skills.

860
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:11,829
Right, sir?

861
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:15,332
Yes. He has an exceptional mind.
He just doesn't get a lot of work.

862
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:16,625
Yes, well...

863
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:19,378
Count the money. Let's have
chicken and beer after I shower.

864
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:27,469
Goodness.

865
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:29,429
This...

866
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:31,807
(Miho gasps)

867
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:33,600
How much is all this?

868
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:35,143
(money rustling)

869
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:36,395
(chuckles)

870
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:42,776
(breathes deeply)

871
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,157
Should we have a baby?

872
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:51,493
I want to be called "Daddy."

873
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:55,163
Will the baby raise itself?
We can't even take care of ourselves.

874
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:57,082
Why not?

875
00:47:57,624 --> 00:47:59,960
I'll just make huge money all at once,
that's all.

876
00:48:00,752 --> 00:48:03,881
Let's talk after you make huge money.
You're so full of it.

877
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:06,133
-You really are a Big Mouth.
-(gasps)

878
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:07,718
Where'd you hear about that?

879
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:10,387
Dang it. Father-in-law...

880
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:14,600
Babe, you know what day tomorrow is?

881
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:15,893
I do.

882
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:18,604
(sighs)
Time really flies.

883
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:22,399
I feel like we got married yesterday,
but it's been three years already.

884
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:25,193
Should we go somewhere nice for dinner?

885
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:26,612
Come home early.

886
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:28,906
I'll grill up some nice pork belly.

887
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:35,078
Why? Am I being too cold?

888
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:37,873
MIHO: We need to face reality.

889
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:41,668
When will we pay off the loans
with the bank and the loan shark?

890
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,795
(serene music)

891
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:47,507
Come hither and embrace me.

892
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:48,634
No.

893
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:50,385
No?

894
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:52,971
Am I not your husband
if I don't make good money?

895
00:48:58,852 --> 00:48:59,895
You come hither.

896
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:01,104
(chuckles)

897
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,230
I shall go.

898
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:04,858
There.

899
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:07,736
(Changho grunts)

900
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:09,821
(murmuring)

901
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:14,826
(giggling)

902
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:17,454
CHANGHO: What lotion is that?
You smell great.

903
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:19,164
MIHO: Dad's not asleep yet.

904
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:20,624
CHANGHO: It's okay.

905
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:22,459
He'll be snoring soon.

906
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:24,544
MIHO: Hey. Get off.

907
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:27,381
-CHANGHO: Come on. Hey, you. Stay still.
-(Miho shushes)

908
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:28,465
MIHO: Hey now.

909
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:30,884
You wicked servant. Gosh.

910
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:33,303
(giggling)

911
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:36,390
(suspenseful music)

912
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:47,567
CHANGHO: If it goes well, I'll be rich.
If not, I'll be famous.

913
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:49,820
Is this what it means
to be dealt a good hand?

914
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:58,370
(phone vibrating)

915
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:03,166
(phone clicks)

916
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,086
JIHOON: Hello?

917
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:09,131
Hello, my name is Park Changho.
I'm an attorney.

918
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:13,301
(music intensifies)

919
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:19,057
WOMAN: Who is it? Your wife?

920
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,144
JIHOON: How may I help you?

921
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:24,938
CHANGHO: You know the suspects
of the Gucheon Hospital murder, correct?

922
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,023
(woman gasps)

923
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:28,358
JIHOON: And?

924
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:32,863
I'm heading to your vacation house
right now.

925
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:37,367
(tense music)

926
00:50:56,511 --> 00:50:58,513
(music fades)

927
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:08,065
CHANGHO: It's nice being rich.

928
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:12,903
-Come with me.
-CHANGHO: Of course.

929
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:18,158
(suspenseful music)

930
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:52,025
(tense music)

931
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:55,362
I have the dashcam video
that captured the murder scene...

932
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:03,245
(music stops)

933
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:06,498
(eerie music)

934
00:52:10,418 --> 00:52:12,087
BUTLER: That costs three billion won.

935
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,384

(sighs deeply)

941
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:44,077
I don't have much time,

942
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:45,579
so please make it quick.

943
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:49,040
Are you really a lawyer?

944
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:50,292
(mutters)

945
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:54,129
(pensive music)

946
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:59,134
LAW OFFICE OF PARK CHANGHO

947
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:04,055
What's that important piece of evidence?

948
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:06,057
The dashcam video of the murder scene.

949
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,645
I have it.

950
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:16,610
It shows Jung Chaebong speaking
with someone on the phone.

951
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,740
I have a feeling...
(exhales heavily)

952
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:24,784
...that person ordered the murder.

953
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:27,370
So?

954
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:34,336
Why did you come to see me?

955
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:35,587
(laughs sarcastically)

956
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:38,757
Do you really want to drag this out?

957
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,637
Buy the video from me.

958
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:48,225
Three billion won.

959
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:50,143
Three billion won?

960
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:53,813
I don't think it's an unreasonable price
for helping someone do something bad.

961
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:55,899
(ominous music)

962
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:57,275
(snaps fingers)

963
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:00,987
You're saying I was the one
who ordered them

964
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,198
to kill Seo Jaeyoung.

965
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:05,992
The prosecutors will figure that out.

966
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:08,286
That's what taxpayers pay them for.

967
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:09,829
(snickers)

968
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:13,458
(laughing)

969
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:20,882
Do you even know who I am...

970
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:25,262
to try to blackmail me like this?

971
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:28,682
The owner of a media company
that kill and save people with words.

972
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:33,353
However, this sword that I hold...

973
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:36,273
is tremendous.

974
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:43,822
(Jihoon sighs)

975
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:48,034
Then wield your toy sword all you want.

976
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:52,414
Let's see

977
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:54,332
who gets hurt...

978
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:57,294
and how.

979
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:05,677
You know the story about Goliath, right?

980
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,595
He was killed by pebbles.

981
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:09,139
-Only five of them.
-JIHOON: Hey.

982
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:10,390
You're an idiot, aren't you?

983
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:14,352
Get lost. Now.

984
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:17,605
The moment I walk out of here,
the negotiation is over. Think about it...

985
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:18,898
I...

986
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:20,191
said

987
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:22,569
get lost,

988
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:24,279
you prick.

989
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:29,117
(music intensifies)

990
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:47,093
-(door closes)
-(ice clinking)

991
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:55,101
(music fades)

992
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:57,479
So you want to play hard ball.

993
00:55:58,396 --> 00:56:00,482
Fine. Let's see what happens.

994
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:05,362
MAYOR CHOI DOHA

995
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:08,656
(phone vibrating)

996
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:09,741
Hello, Mayor.

997
00:56:09,824 --> 00:56:11,576
Why weren't you taking my calls?

998
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,579
I'm sorry. My phone died.

999
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:16,581
MAYOR CHOI: Where are you? Let's meet.

1000
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:20,335
Today won't work. How about tomorrow?

1001
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:22,629
(sighs deeply)

1002
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:26,174
That dashcam video...

1003
00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:28,593
I'll give it to the prosecutor myself.

1004
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:32,639
CHANGHO: It won't be good for you to get
involved since you know the suspects.

1005
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:35,892
Fine.

1006
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:38,561
You do that.

1007
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:41,398
(suspenseful music)

1008
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:50,490
(serene music playing)

1009
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:51,658
Ms. Ko Miho?

1010
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:54,577
-Yes.
-Please follow me.

1011
00:56:57,997 --> 00:57:01,709
MIHO'S FATHER: Wow. Aren't places
like this super expensive?

1012
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:04,170
Changho, that punk.

1013
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:07,966
He's showing off without thinking
about the consequences.

1014
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,927
PROSECUTOR CHO DONGHWA

1017
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:19,227
OPERATOR: The person you have reached...

1018
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:25,275
I'm Park Changho, counsel
for the suspects of Seo Jaeyoung's murder.

1019
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:27,444
I have something to share with you.

1020
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:29,529
Please call me when you get this.

1021
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:31,239

PROSECUTOR CHO DONGHWA

CHANGHO: Hello?

1026
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:50,175
Mr. Cho?

1027
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:53,553
I'm Park Changho, defense counsel
for the Gucheon Hospital murder.

1028
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:56,639
STAFF: Please, drink this on your way.

1029
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:58,433
How thoughtful of you.

1030
00:57:58,516 --> 00:57:59,559
Thank you.

1031
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:02,437
(phone line beeps)

1032
00:58:03,354 --> 00:58:05,356
(tense music)

1033
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:10,445
REPORTER 1: The genius con artist.
The king of the dark world.

1034
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:12,155
The godfather of the underground economy.

1035
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:14,908
Shockingly, all of these
are probably one person.

1036
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:16,784
The person called Big Mouse.

1037
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:18,578
Is this person real?

1038
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:21,706
Yes. Some say Big Mouse is made up.

1039
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:24,501
Some say it's a group of people
or even a foreigner.

1040
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:25,585
(laughs)
Right.

1041
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:27,879
REPORTER 2:
There are many hypotheses out there.

1042
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:30,590
REPORTER 1: We've never seen him,
but we know many of his crimes.

1043
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:33,801
Dozens of cases of fraud,
drug distribution, illegal loans,

1044
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:36,304
and illegal gambling sites.

1045
00:58:36,804 --> 00:58:39,641
REPORTER 1: There's a rumor that he's
being protected by the upper class.

1046
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:40,725
What do you think?

1047
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:43,645
Are the cops unable to catch him
or are they just not catching him?

1048
00:58:43,728 --> 00:58:46,814
Please get caught
so that I can defend you.

1049

(panting)

1062
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:52,547

-(music stops)
-(exhales sharply)

1073
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:15,296
CHANGHO: Obviously, I didn't die.

1074
01:01:16,255 --> 01:01:18,091
Miho went to see a fortune-teller once,

1075
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:20,802
and he said I don't have much luck
but I'll live a long life.

1076
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:24,972
But when I woke up,
I was a completely different person.

1077
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:30,019
The most despicable louse in the world.

1078
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:34,190
BIG MOUTH

1079

CHANGHO: The things that will happen.

1083
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:01,384
Are you Big Mouse?

1084
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:03,678
-You need to stay alert.
-(siren wailing)

1085
01:02:03,761 --> 01:02:05,304
CHANGHO: Never in my wildest dreams

1086
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:07,515
did I expect to become famous like this.

1087
01:02:07,598 --> 01:02:08,808
Did you meet Gong Jihoon?

1088
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:11,310
Bravo!

1089
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:13,813
-MAN 1: Welcome, Big Mouse.
-(gasps)

1090
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:17,108
MAN 2: This is the only place in Korea
where lawlessness is allowed.

1091
01:02:17,191 --> 01:02:18,735
What's your problem with me?

1092
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:20,361
CHANGHO: Who and why...

1093
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:22,280
Just kill me, you jerk!

1094
01:02:22,363 --> 01:02:24,240
...did they turn me into Big Mouse?
