(theme music)

2
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:43,960
BIG MOUTH

3
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,795
THIS SHOW IS A WORK OF FICTION

4
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,965
THE EVENTS AND ENTITIES
THAT APPEAR HEREIN ARE FICTIONAL

5
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,051
(upbeat music)

6
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:05,482
JUDGE: Defendants, state your names.

7
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:08,860
(Chaebong clears throat)

8
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:11,071
-I'm Jung Chaebong.
-I'm Lee Doogeun.

9
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:12,697
I'm Han Jaeho.

10
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,825
JUDGE: You have the right
to refuse to testify.

11
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:20,121
CHANGHO: Should I predict something
about the trial today?

12
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:24,417
The court will, without a doubt,
find them not guilty.

13
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,377
PRODUCER NA: The comments are pouring in.

14
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:29,964
CheapPrice says the likelihood
of acquittal is 0.9 percent

15
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,591
and wants to bet one million won.

16
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:34,552
I'll pass on the bet.
You just saved one million won.

17
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,431
MIHO: I'm at the trial right now.

18
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:41,643
RighteousLife.
Can you stream live from the trial?

19
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,478
MIHO: Yes, I can.

20
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,105
Thank you.

21
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:49,651
We'll find out in real-time whether or not
what Big Mouse says is true.

22
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:52,654
Please stay tuned until the end.

23
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:56,116
PRODUCER NA:
You say the court will acquit today.

24
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,910
Is it because
the prosecutor is incompetent?

25
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:02,330
Choi Joongrak is the ace
of the Gucheon Prosecutors' Office.

26
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:04,624
(ominous music)

27
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:06,668
MIHO: Then?
Is this trial a dog and pony show?

28
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:08,169
NEWS MENTAL

29
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:10,421
Bingo. That's a good hunch.

30
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:13,341
CHANGHO: Okay.
Now focus on what I'm about to say.

31
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:17,679
Prosecutor Choi will make three assertions
as proof of guilt.

32
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:20,640
JUDGE:
Prosecution, question your witnesses.

33
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,559
CHANGHO: First proof of guilt

34
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:26,104
will be the group chat room
shared by the defendants and the victim.

35
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:29,440
These were chats shared by the defendants
and the victim on the day of the incident.

36
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,067
(remote clicks)

37
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,111
MIHO: Prosecutor Choi
just submitted their chats

38
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,029
from the group chat room as evidence.

39
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:40,368
It seems that the prosecutor has submitted
the group chat room as evidence.

40
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:42,996
PROSECUTOR: The defendants
planned to meet Seo Jaeyoung

41
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:46,958
at Gucheon Hospital at 17:30
to attend a charity event.

42
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:51,045
Han Jaeho's car exited the garage
at 17:36.

43
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:54,299
You told the police that Han Jaeho,
Jung Chaebong, and Lee Doogeun

44
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,676
were the only ones in the car.
Is that correct?

45
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:57,886
DEFENSE COUNSEL

46
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,095
-(mic beeps)
-Yes.

47
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,431
PROSECUTOR: The person you were supposed
to meet had not come,

48
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,767
but none of you contacted Seo Jaeyoung.

49
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,561
Why was that?

50
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:09,606
-DOOGEUN: It's not that we didn't...
-PROSECUTOR: You didn't have to.

51
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,692
Because you had already stowed
the dead Seo Jaeyoung in your trunk.

52
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:15,445
(crowd murmuring)

53
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,197
Objection.

54
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,657
Prosecution is asking leading questions.

55
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,409
JUDGE: Sustained.

56
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:24,245
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SEEING THIS
IS THIS FOR REAL?

57
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,080
CHANGHO: Don't be shocked already.

58
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,499
That's only one with many more to come.

59
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,878
PRODUCER NA: Please continue.

60
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,922
What will the prosecutor assert next?

61
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,091
What is that?

62
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,760
-Big Mouse.
-Big Mouse?

63
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,136
Big Mouse.

64
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:42,847
BIG MOUSE IS A GOD
HOW DOES HE KNOW THIS?

65
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,475
CHANGHO: The motive for murder
in the police report.

66
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:49,187
PRODUCER NA: Motive for murder?
What was that exactly?

67
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,690
That Jung Chaebong and Seo Jaeyoung's wife
were having an affair.

68
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:55,235
You asserted to the police

69
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,780
that Jung Chaebong and Seo Jaeyoung's wife
were having an affair.

70
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,157
-Yes.
-That Lee Doogeun and Seo Jaeyoung

71
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,576
were in conflict over a medical dispute.

72
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,036
You said that Lee Doogeun

73
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:07,830
and Seo Jaeyoung were arguing
over a medical dispute. Is that right?

74
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:11,376
-That's right.
-That Han Jaeho and Seo Jaeyoung

75
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,087
were rivals to be the next director.

76
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,630
PROSECUTOR: You told the police

77
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:18,758
that Han Jaeho and Seo Jaeyoung
were fighting to be the next director.

78
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,343
That's correct.

79
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:24,931
Defendants had plenty of motivation
to murder Seo Jaeyoung.

80
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:27,600
CHANGHO:
Each defendant's motives for murder

81
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:31,354
were a highly intellectual script
written by Lee Doogeun to claim innocence.

82
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,023
I don't think Big Mouse is making it up.

83
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,900
WOMAN: He knows everything about the case.

84
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,069
Shouldn't we tell the court about this?

85
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:41,572
MIHO: The prosecutor's assertions
match Big Mouse's predictions perfectly.

86
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,158
PRODUCER NA:
Apparently the prosecutor's assertions

87
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,244
match Big Mouse's predictions perfectly.

88
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:49,706
What is the third piece of evidence
that the prosecutor will submit?

89
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,083
PROSECUTOR: This is the DNA analysis

90
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,459
conducted
by the National Forensic Service.

91
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:56,254
As per this analysis,
Seo Jaeyoung's blood and DNA were found

92
00:04:56,337 --> 00:05:00,300
on the defendants' bodies and clothes
at the time of the incident.

93
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:04,637
The defendants' DNA were also found
on the victim's body and clothes.

94
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:09,142
I request that this report be entered
as Exhibit 11.

95
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,476
I'll accept it.

96
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,104
PROSECUTOR: No more questions.

97
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:14,689
(keyboard clacking)

98
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,774
(ominous music)

99
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,778
ASSOCIATE: You need to see this, sir.

100
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,196

101
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,284
NEWS MENTAL

102
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:27,952
Why is this rat on this?

103
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,125
(ominous music)

104
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:38,588
If they have DNA evidence,
the trial should go favorably

105
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:41,174
for the prosecution.

106
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,842
There's a must-do

107
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:45,178
in order to hook a sucker
in a fixed card game.

108
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,221
You lose to them in the beginning.

109
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,598
This son of a...

110

111
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,064
Track their IP address now.

ASSOCIATE: Yes, sir.

113
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:01,235
It's Lee Doogeun's turn to step in
as both defendant and attorney.

114
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,364
JUDGE: Counsel, question your witnesses.

115
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:07,992
-(exhales)
-Since the suckers are ready to believe,

116
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,203
Lee Doogeun will swap out the deck.

117
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:11,371
Swap out the deck?

118
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,790
He'll flip the tables on the DNA report.

119
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,249
How?

120
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,627
CPR.

121
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,923
This is a video that a bystander took
immediately after the car accident.

-Open your eyes!
-DOOGEUN: What's going on?

00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:32,767
What should we do?

00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:33,893

You have to save him!

133
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,452
What's taking the ambulance so long?

134
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:55,123
They say it's coming. Save him, will you?

135

Are you saying you were

00:07:57,226 --> 00:08:01,814
Listen. Let's get out
and give Professor Seo CPR. Okay?

162
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,317
-What?
-DOOGEUN: If the police run a DNA test,

163
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,985
we'll be screwed.

164
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:08,821
Hey. Just do as he says.

165
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,072
-Okay.
-Damn it.

166
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,201
GOOSEBUMPS!
WHERE'S THE DASHCAM VIDEO??

167
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,785
WHO'S THE REAL CULPRIT?
I'M SPEECHLESS

168
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,413
MIHO: Bring the dashcam video
to the court now.

169
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:23,211
Unfortunately,
they took the dashcam video from me.

170
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,296
PRODUCER NA:
They probably destroyed it by now.

171
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:26,255
(groans)

172
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,633
Please let me go.

173
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:31,761
Because it would be detrimental to them.

174
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,430
If we had a dashcam,

175
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:38,226
we could've proven without a doubt
that we are innocent.

176
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:41,145
DOOGEUN:
But sadly, we did not have a dashcam.

177
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,773
-(engine whirring)
-(metallic clanging)

178
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,610
In exchange, I request that this video

179
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,905
be entered into evidence as Exhibit 12.

180
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,073
I'll accept it.

181
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:54,659
(crowd murmuring)

182
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,371
(tense music)

183
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,540
(clears throat loudly)

184
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,296
Your Honor. I'd like to request recess.

185
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,967
JUDGE:
The court will take a 30-minute recess.

186
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,052
(tense music continues)

187
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,640
Where is he going?

188
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,433
(murmuring continues)

189
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,227
(phone lines dialing)

190
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,064
(phone lines dialing)

191
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,910
BIG MOUTH

192
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,458
Darn it!

193
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,169
JIHOON: Get out of my way!

194
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,802
(exhales)

195
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:57,888
MAYOR CHOI: Miho.

196
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,851
What's going on right now?

197
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,693
(suspenseful music)

198
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,654
Keep tracking him
and let me know what's going on.

199
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,364
(phone beeps)

200
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,075
So? Did they find him?

201
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,037
They're masking the IP address using
international servers, so it's hard.

202
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,458
JIHOON: It's not like he is omniscient.

203
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:29,045
How does he know our plan in such detail?

204
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,714
DOOGEUN: It's all in here.

205
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:36,135
The strategy for the trial, our alibis,
flaws in the prosecution's case,

206
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:40,181
and even the statements
you'll make in court.

207
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:41,641
Yes, sir.

208
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:45,394
This is all Mayor Choi's fault.

209
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,439
Because he introduced that jerk to us
to be our attorney.

210
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,858
ASSOCIATE: You can't go in.

211
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,110
What's this with Park Changho?

212
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,280
(grunts)

213
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,493
(groans)

214
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,078
I told you not to let anyone in.

215
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,329
ASSOCIATE: I'm sorry, sir.

216
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,335
Get out. This isn't your place either.

217
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:13,506
Then you can report
directly to the elder. Here.

218
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,259
There's no proof.

219
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,804
JIHOON: He's talking out of his butt.

220
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:23,307
We'll get an acquittal,
so what's the problem?

221
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,101
The problem is the attention it's getting.

222
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,812
You know the elder despises that.

223
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:30,773
CHAEBONG: This is all your fault.

224
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,025
We're cleaning up what you've...

225
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,110
Okay.

226
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,195
Keep talking.

227
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,282
(groans)

228
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,911
(phone vibrating)

229
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,164
RESTRICTED NUMBER

230
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,751
Hyejin?

231
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:53,879
Speak.

232
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,299
DR. HAN: It's Hyejin, right?
Give me the phone.

233
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,593
I'll talk to her!

234
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,345
Do you have the document I requested?

235
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,389
Where are you?

236
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,809
Second floor of the café
across the courthouse.

237
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,562
-Hyejin! Talk to me directly!
-CHAEBONG: Hey.

238
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:12,648
Hyejin, talk to me! Hon...

239
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,442
-(muffled grunting)
-Hey. Calm down.

240
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,070
Will you first tell me where Big Mouse is?

241
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:21,365
I'll give you 20 minutes.
Bring me the document.

242
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:24,910
If you're even one second late,
I'm going to Big Mouse.

243
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:27,955
(phone beeps)

244
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:31,917
DR. HAN: Get off! Damn it!

245
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,127
Bring the divorce papers.

246
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,254
(tense music)

247
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,886
I made myself clear. I won't divorce her!

248
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,097
I'm still alive and well!

249
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:49,143
(sighs)
Just kill me instead.

250
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,270
DR. HAN: Just kill me and...

251
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,691
Hey. Snap out of it, bastard.

252
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,986
You'll die if that gets
into Big Mouse's hands.

253
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:01,697
Don't you know?
Do you choose death over divorce?

254
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:05,493
I'll abduct your wife if I have to
and will bring her to you,

255
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:08,245
so just win this trial, you bastard.

256
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,749
(suspenseful music)

257
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,732
(suspenseful music)

258
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:50,454
-Empty the floor.
-ASSOCIATE: Yes, sir.

259
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,754
(music intensifies)

260
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,221
DIVORCE AGREEMENT

261
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,642
(ominous music)

262
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,895
HUSBAND: HAN JAEHO
WIFE: JANG HYEJIN

263
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,569
(tense music)

264
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,495
(music stops)

265
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,666
Where's Big Mouse?

266
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:40,421
Where is he? Tell me where that prick is.

267
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,510
He's at 17-4 Yongbuk-dong,

268
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,554
in an abandoned factory.

269
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:53,183
-JIHOON: Let Prosecutor Choi know.
-ASSOCIATE: Yes, sir.

270
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,815
(tense music)

271
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,200
HUSBAND: HAN JAEHO
WIFE: JANG HYEJIN

272
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:17,833
(phone chimes)

273
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,710
REPORTER: The fugitive Park Changho
has been located.

274
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,337
An abandoned factory at 17-4 in Yongbuk.

275
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,547
The team in charge should head there now.

276
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,801
PRODUCER NA: Anything useful as evidence
disappeared including the murder weapon.

277
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:31,513
It's impossible to explain
unless this trial is a charade.

278
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,682
JUDGE: The court has come to a decision.

279
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,226
The court finds the defendants,

280
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:40,189
Jung Chaebong, Lee Doogeun,
and Han Jaeho...

281
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,442
CHANGHO:
That's precisely what they're after.

282
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,778
Insufficient evidence.

283
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:48,656
Not guilty on the grounds
of insufficient evidence.

284
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:53,410
-MAN 1: How is this possible?
-WOMAN 1: What's this?

285
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,287
MAN 2: What's going on?

286
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,374
-MAN 3: How could they be acquitted?
-WOMAN 2: This is shocking.

287
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:01,835
MAN 4: This is what you call
equity and justice. This is it.

288
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:07,257
PRODUCER NA: They really were acquitted
as you've predicted, Big Mouse.

289
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,219
(ominous music)

290
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,680
(crowd murmuring)

291
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,601
PRODUCER NA: I'm truly disappointed
in our justice department.

292
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,645
NEWS MENTAL

293
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,730
But we can't shun the truth.

294
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,774
(tires screeching)

295
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,651
-(siren wails)
-PRODUCER NA: We have no choice.

296
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,904
Obviously, the prosecutor won't appeal.

297
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,658
CHANGHO:
The most important fact is missing.

298
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,743
(tense music)

299
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,246
Why did they kill Seo Jaeyoung?

300
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:44,586
OFFICER: Freeze!

301
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,673
PRODUCER NA: The motives for murder
asserted by the prosecutor

302
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,800
were obviously scripted.

303
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,345
Why did they kill him?

304
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,223
His paper.

305
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:57,808
PRODUCER NA: What paper?

306
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,770
The unpublished paper
written by Professor Seo Jaeyoung.

307
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,106
(ominous music)

308
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,778
(scoffs)

309
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,824
(Jihoon exhales deeply)

310
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,285
What are you trying to pull?

311
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,829
That's Professor Seo's paper.

312
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,581
(scoffs)

313
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,794
(breathes deeply)

314
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,964
We thank the judge
for following the letter of the law

315
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,008
and displaying justice and fairness.

316
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:34,511
Moreover, we request the authorities

317
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,680
to catch the real culprit quickly.

318
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,390
REPORTER 1: According to Park Changho,

319
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,226
this was a dog and pony show
that you and the prosecutor put together.

320
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,437
That's not even worthy of a response.

321
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,814
Who would believe
the con man of the century?

322
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,692
REPORTER 2: You haven't seen the video,
have you? It's quite detailed.

323
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,027
CHAEBONG: Is that right?

324
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:53,947
If he knows everything so well,
maybe Big Mouse is the real culprit.

325
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,532
REPORTER 3:
They say this was a dog and pony show.

326
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,743
-REPORTER 4: Prosecutor. Will you appeal?
-REPORTER 3: Is this all true?

327
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:58,827
REPORTER 4: Please give us a statement.

328
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,080
REPORTER 5:
What do you think about the dashcam?

329
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:04,541
We can't appeal without solid evidence.

330
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:07,836
REPORTER 4: But still...

331
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:11,465
-REPORTER 1: What's going on?
-REPORTER 2: What is that?

332
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,178
(ominous music)

333
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,348
(truck brakes hissing)

334
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:21,725
(truck engine stops)

335
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:25,020
What you say
about the paper is interesting,

336
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:28,440
but our viewers are too shocked
to believe you.

337
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:29,691
CHANGHO: That's the problem.

338
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:34,154
Things that you read only in novels
are happening in real life.

339
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:37,116
PRODUCER NA: You don't have the paper.

340
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,785
I don't think you'll persuade the viewers

341
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,704
with just your assertions
without evidence.

342
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:47,126
That is why I want to show you
definitive evidence while I'm here.

343
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,211
(reporters murmuring)

344
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,463
(ominous music)

345
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,967
(camera shutters clicking)

346
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,885
JIHOON: Are you messing with me, Hyejin?

347
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:03,142
This isn't the subject matter
of the paper I'm asking for.

348
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,518
HYEJIN: I don't know about that.

349
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:07,646
But that's all I received
from Professor Seo.

350
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:08,772
(thumps)

351
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,402
This is maddening. Seriously.

352
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,863
I watched...

353
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,532
the dashcam video.

354
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:23,078
I saw my husband,
Jung Chaebong, and Lee Doogeun...

355
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,164
(ominous music)

356
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,875
...choking and killing Professor Seo
because of that paper.

357
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,756
Those guys aren't crazy.

358
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,177
Do you really think
they killed Seo Jaeyoung

359
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,887
just for this academic paper?

360
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:44,433
They killed him
because it was worth killing him for.

361
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:48,228
But this paper is not it,

362
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,230
Jang Hyejin!

363
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,399
What? Is that video real?

364
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:55,068
-REPORTER 1: Please say something.
-REPORTER 2: Is that real?

365
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:58,655
JIHOON: Hyejin. You don't understand

366
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:00,949
how patient...

367
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,869
I'm being right now.

368
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:07,164
So hand it over while I'm being nice.

369
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:12,628
The real paper that Jaeyoung gave you.

370
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,339
ASSOCIATE: Sir!

371
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,638
Did they catch Big Mouse?

372
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,389
ASSOCIATE: There's a camera.

373
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,226
(suspenseful music)

374
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,333
(music intensifies)

375
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,254
(music stops)

376
00:20:56,338 --> 00:21:00,217
You can keep it. We already have a copy.

377
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:03,178
(tense music)

378
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:09,059
(cracking)

379
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,104
(wind hissing)

380
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,941
(clanking)

381
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:18,527
(reporters clamoring)

382
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,612
(suspenseful music)

383
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,615
(clamoring continues)

384
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:32,165
(clamoring stops)

00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,346
(camera shutters clicking)

00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,267
(music intensifies)

00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,198
(tense music)

388
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,837
(upbeat music)

389
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,389
(music stops)

390
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:33,060
I plan to submit this video
as evidence as per Jang Hyejin's request.

391
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,103
Hang in there, prosecutor.

392
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,522
The decision can easily be overturned.

393
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:40,025
CHANGHO: What's with that look?

394
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,944
You didn't plan to forfeit the appeal,
did you?

395
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,363
REPORTER 1: Will you appeal?

396
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,573
REPORTER 2: Please tell us here and now.

397
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:50,869
Of course, we'll appeal.

398
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:55,374
With evidence like this,
I know I can convince the court.

399
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,459
(phone line dialing)

400
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:01,463
PROSECUTOR: I'm at the courthouse.
Park Changho is here. Arrest him.

401
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:03,507
(phone clicks)

402
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,550
Thanks for coming voluntarily.

403
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,803
Especially with this great gift.

404
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:16,061
You poor thing.
You can't fabricate evidence anymore.

405
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,814
You'll end up sending them
to prison yourself.

406
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,066
(tense music)

407
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:31,660
(phone beeps)

408
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,663
Hi, Soontae. How are things over there?

409
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,165
(groans)

410
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:43,004
I trained in martial arts
back in the day, you punks.

411
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,381
MIHO'S FATHER: If you want to eat

412
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:46,550
through a straw for the rest of your life,
come at me.

413
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:47,634
KO MIHO, MR. KO KIKWANG

414
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:51,930
KIKWANG: You punk.

415
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:54,516
(grunting)

416
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,144
KIKWANG: Let go.

417
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,689
(Kikwang grunting, yelling)

418
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:04,609
(Hyejin grunting)

419
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,779
-(grunts)
-(music stops)

420
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:10,991
Let her go and leave quietly.

421
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:12,075
(scoffs)

422
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,078
What's this?
Are you here to stab me in the back too?

423
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:17,080
(Hyejin grunts)

424
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,249
(breathes heavily)

425
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:20,417
(exhales sharply)

426
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,296
JIHOON: Hey.

427
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:28,008
You think I'm done for
just because I was caught on camera?

428
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:31,553
Take a good look at me.

429
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:34,556
I'm Gong Jihoon.

430
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,016
(scoffs)

431
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:37,225
(creaking)

432

(Jihoon groans)

435
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:44,816
Hey.

436
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:46,610
(exhales sharply)

437
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:51,615
Reporters are coming.

438
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:53,950
What?

439
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:59,080
I'll take care of it,
so scram, you bastard.

440
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:02,334
(chuckling)

441
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:09,424
(tense music)

442
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:19,100
(camera shutters clicking)

443
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,645
REPORTER: Was that woman you were with
Professor Seo's mistress?

444
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:23,480
You seem excited.

445
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:25,482
You pop up here and there and everywhere.

446
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:28,777
Thank you for uncovering the truth
in front of the entire nation.

447
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:30,654
It's all thanks to you.

448
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,030
REPORTER 1: Is that true?

449
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:33,823
REPORTER 2:
What do you have to say about it?

450
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:36,660
Let them be. It's fine.

451
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:40,956
Try using my picture in an article.
Let's see what happens.

452
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,123
(chuckles)

453
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,292
WOOJEONG DAILY

454
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,419
Hey. You work for me.

455
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:50,131
Goodness. I'm sorry.
I didn't realize who you were.

456
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:52,634
Don't be sorry. Reporter Sung Bokyung.

457
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,511
Fire him.

458
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:56,638
-REPORTER 1: What? Sir!
-REPORTER 2: Sir!

459
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:59,140
-REPORTER 1: Sir!
-ASSOCIATE: Stay back.

460
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,226
(tense music)

461
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:03,895
Miho.

462
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,232
(Miho exhales sharply)
Thank you, everyone.

463
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:11,152
I could've wiped the floor with them.
Darn it.

464
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,363
Wipe the dirt off the floor instead.

465
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:14,447
KIKWANG: Hey.

466
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:17,325
You would've had to clean up
multiple corpses if the mayor hadn't come.

467
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,494
You would've become a corpse
if the mayor hadn't come.

468
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,539
Whatever.

469
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,417
Thank you for keeping your promise.

470
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,429
(gasps)

471
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:38,638
Please take care of this.

472
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:41,099
It'll be done by the time you return
from the US.

473
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:42,475
SOONTAE: Relax while you're there.

474
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,227
I need to go now.

475
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,104
MAYOR CHOI: I'll take you to the airport.

476
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:47,647
You should go to Changho.

477
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:48,815
(chuckles)

478
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:50,442
Thank you, Mayor Choi.

479
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:55,155
REPORTER: Your family says you were
abducted, and that you didn't escape.

480
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:58,325
When I was locked up in a mental hospital,

481
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:00,744
some people came and tried to kill me.

482
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,370
They abducted me.

483
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,747
Who were they?

484
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,582
Gong Jihoon, who was in the video...

485
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,667
(pensive music)

486
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,086
...and Mr. Choi Joongrak right here.

487
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,006
-REPORTER 1: What?
-REPORTER 2: Is what he says true?

488
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:14,966
REPORTER 3: Please confirm.

489
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,052
Making false accusations was just added.

490
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,511
How dare you frame a prosecutor?

491
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,013
Just wait.

492
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,807
You people's evil deeds
will be open for all to see.

493
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:27,687
Your trial is coming up.
Do you still say you were framed?

494
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:29,773
(suspenseful music)

495
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:32,192
I won't say anything else.

496
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:36,780
I'll bring evidence to the trial
that I am not Big Mouse.

497
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:39,157
(sirens wailing)

498
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:45,330
OFFICER: Step aside.

499
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:49,209
(handcuffs clanking)

500
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,420
OFFICER: Take him.

501
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:54,881
Let's get going.

502
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:58,677
-OFFICER: Make way.
-REPORTER: Please give us one statement.

503
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,429
(clamoring)

504
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:11,189
(music stops)

505
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:12,816
KIKWANG: Stop!

506
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:14,901
(crowd clamoring)

507
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:17,612
(Kikwang grunts)

508
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,572
Excuse me. Sorry.

509
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,616
I'm Park Changho's attorney.

510
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,618
Let me see him for a minute.

511
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,245
SOONTAE: Open the door.

512
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:26,663
(door opens)

513
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:28,832
(camera shutters clicking)

514
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:39,968
Our team is amazing.

515
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:42,137
-I'm proud of you.
-It's moving.

516
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,681
With teamwork like this,
we can save the nation.

517
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:46,266
-(laughs)
-Sorry, but that's pushing it.

518
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:50,228
We just have to catch Big Mouse now.

519
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:52,272
Maybe not the nation,
but we can save the family.

520
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:55,066
This is a fight between a crime ring
and our family.

521
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:01,197
(suspenseful music)

522
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:04,534
(camera shutters clicking)

523
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,846
(suspenseful music)

524
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,349
INCHEON INT'L AIRPORT
TERMINAL ONE

525
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,352
PASSENGER TERMINAL ONE

526
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:36,649
REPORTER: Breaking news.

527
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:39,903
The indictment committee
of Gucheon Prosecutors' Office met today

528
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:42,113
and decided to appeal
the not-guilty verdict

529
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,032
on Seo Jaeyoung's murder trial.

530
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:45,909
The investigation has been transferred

531
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:49,204
from the Criminal Department One
to a special investigation team.

532
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:53,249
The reincarceration of the suspects,
Jung, Lee, and Han

533
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:55,168
are also being discussed.

534
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:58,880
They also plan to investigate
Professor Seo's paper,

535
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,381
the suspected motive of the murder.

536
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,091
DR. HAN: Damn it.

537
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:03,885
(sirens wailing)

538
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:07,430
The recording submitted by Park Changho,
who is known to be Big Mouse,

539
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:10,350
played a very big part.

540
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:13,436
Park Changho's trial
is scheduled for the 15th of this month.

541
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:17,607
Park has been denying being Big Mouse.

542
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,193
He had played a big part
in uncovering the truth

543
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:22,320
in Professor Seo Jaeyoung's murder.

544
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:24,155
All eyes are on him now

545
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:28,034
to see what he does in his trial
regarding the charges against him.

546
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:30,870
(music intensifies)

547
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:35,291
(music fades)

548
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:40,171
SOONTAE: His name is Jerry, right?

549
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,050
(tires screeching)

550
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:45,927
SOONTAE:
The guy who got hurt while saving you.

551
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,221
He's not dead.

552
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,890
He's in the hospital. He's stable.

553
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,436
Jerry might know who Big Mouse is.

554
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,023
Go see him.

555
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:02,318
(suspenseful music)

556
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,890
CHANGHO: Thanks for staying alive, Jerry.

557
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,308
HOPE DOES NOT SHUN HE WHO SEEKS IT

558
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,560
I uncovered what they did thanks to you,

559
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:37,103
and everything went well.

560
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:39,772
I'll repay you for this.

561
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,650
Let's meet in a bright world.

562
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:49,282
OH * CHUL, GENDER: MALE

563
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:57,790
(ominous music)

564
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,709
THANKS FOR STAYING ALIVE, JERRY.

565
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:02,253
LET'S MEET IN A BRIGHT WORLD.
PARK CHANGHO

566
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,631
(eerie music)

567
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,099
PROTECT WHOLEHEARTEDLY
AND LEAD OTHERS TO THE RIGHT PATH

568
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,352
(inmates clamoring)

569
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:24,859
(tense music)

570
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:38,831
The reason I came in here on my own
is simple.

571
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:43,169
Just wait, Big Mouse. You're next.

572
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:46,589
(music continues)

573
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:01,145
(music stops)

574
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,697
(eerie music)

575
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:27,088
(music fades)

576
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,132
CHUNSIK: Good job.

577
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,801
They got crushed big time

578
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:34,554
for abducting the wrong guy.

579
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:37,640
You're so right, Boss.
It makes me so happy, Boss.

580
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:41,686
Let's not celebrate just by ourselves.
The mood hasn't been good lately.

581
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:44,605
Maybe we should have a party
for the whole prison.

582
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:45,898
What's wrong with the mood?

583
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:50,903
There's a ghostly disease
going around here.

584
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:53,031
(ominous music)

585
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,449
A ghostly disease?

586
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:58,453
ROOM LEADER: Guys who were perfectly fine
suddenly throw up blood and faint.

587
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,997
(indistinct screaming)

588
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,542
They suddenly go crazy
and get belligerent.

589
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:08,463
Because of that,
all the doctors and nurses quit

590
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,590
and ran away.

591
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:15,678
This exact thing happened
several years ago.

592
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:18,681
-Did they die?
-No.

593
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:22,894
CHUNSIK: They got treated and came back,
served their sentences and were released.

594
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:25,396
I only know
what the long-term prisoners told me.

595
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,148
-Hey.
-Yes, Boss?

596
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:31,861
Anyway, didn't you say that those
who threw up blood and fainted

597
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:33,571
were all model inmates?

598
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:35,531
INMATE: That's right. Definitely.

599
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,617
ROOM LEADER:
Does the ghost like model inmates?

600
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:40,953
I think we should pool commissary funds

601
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:43,247
and call a shaman
to perform an exorcism...

602
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,916
Oh, my gosh.

603
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,543
Inmate 5247, you have a visitor.

604
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,425
(door opens)

605
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:59,806
(suspenseful music)

606
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:03,684
(door closes)

607
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,686
I'm not here to fight.

608
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,773
Can't you smile a bit?

609
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,742
Would you smile
after being treated like a lab mouse?

610
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:26,999
The one who does the beating forgets,
but the one beaten remembers forever.

611
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:28,918
Isn't it the reverse?

612
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:32,463
I think we were the ones who were beat up.

613
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:36,175
You screwed us over. Big time.

614
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,386
(Jihoon exhales sharply)

615
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:41,430
The back of my neck still aches.

616
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,851
Hey. Just get to the point.

617
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:50,857
You've heard of Buhwa, right?
The tiny village on the outskirts.

618
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,068
We plan to bulldoze it

619
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:57,613
and build a huge housing development.

620
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:00,283
Invest 100 billion won in it.

621
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:04,370
JIHOON:
You'll profit at least double or triple.

622
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:07,081
You can make money by investing,

623
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:10,209
and we get back the money
you stole from us.

624
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:12,044
How nice is that?

625
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:14,422
Isn't development prohibited there?

626
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:17,341
That's why no one else can get in there.

627
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:21,846
Except for the special ones like us.

628
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:26,225
Why?
Because development is prohibited there.

629
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:30,605
Gosh.

630
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:33,024
What a great tip.

631
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:36,736
Of course. Where else would you get
such valuable intel?

632
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:41,073
I'll tack it on to the charges against you
when I have you locked up.

633
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:43,993
(suspenseful music)

634
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:48,497
Accomplice to Professor Seo's murder
and construction rights corruption.

635
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:52,376
Forget the large development.
Look into getting a room in here.

636
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,795
You'll be rotting in here for a while.

637
00:36:56,547 --> 00:37:01,636
JIHOON: You still think that the
accomplice who killed Professor Seo is me.

638
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:06,224
Talk about barking up the wrong tree.

639
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,227
How did you do all that as Big Mouse

640
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,396
with crappy instincts like that?

641
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,732
(ominous music)

642
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:16,275
CHANGHO: Then who was it?

643
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:19,820
Who spoke to Jung Chaebong
after they killed Seo Jaeyoung?

644
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,161
Curious?

645
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:32,458
(chuckles)

646
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:36,212
(laughs)

647
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:40,633
(suspenseful music)

648
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:47,348
Find out for yourself.

649
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,936
It really wasn't me.

650
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:57,149
(door opens)

651
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,568
(door closes)

652
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:01,654
(music intensifies)

653
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:06,534
(exhales)

654
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:12,873
(ominous music)

655
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:31,350
(music intensifies)

656
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:34,770
(music stops)

657
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,862
JUHEE: Why were you in there for so long?
I almost went in after you.

658
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:44,530
I had a lot to think about.

659
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:47,783
That's so peculiar.

660
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,037
I can't think at all
when I'm in the water.

661
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:55,875
I like it because it feels
like time stops when I'm in there.

662
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:59,962
At times, a minute feels like an hour.

663
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:02,048
(ominous music)

664
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:12,308
Please wait here.

665
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,575
JUHEE: What do you have after this?
I'm free the rest of the day.

666
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,953
MAYOR CHOI: Jung Chaebong and the rest
requested a visit with the elder.

667
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,831
I feel like I should be there.

668
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:36,999
I'll go with you.

669
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:39,752
I'll go by myself. Wait for me at home.

670
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:43,672
You had nothing to do with what happened
to Professor Seo, right?

671
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:49,136
Mr. Gong said something strange last time.

672
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:51,222
The elder is involved.

673
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:53,724
How could I not care
just because I wasn't involved?

674
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,726
Don't get too deeply involved.

675
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:59,522
You have to avoid getting your hands dirty
if you want to succeed the elder.

676
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:02,024
I'll make sure those who caused trouble
take responsibility.

677
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,652
It's the only way
to put the elder at ease.

678
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,029
(sighs)

679
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:10,032
MAYOR CHOI:
If you don't like it, neither do I.

680
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,868
Don't worry, Juhee. Okay?

681
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,221
Why are you all standing there?

682
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:33,639
(clears throat)

683
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:37,059
You haven't given us an answer yet.

684
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:39,437
"I'll get the investigation dropped,
so don't worry."

685
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:41,439
Is that the answer that you want?

686
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:44,316
The prosecutors caught wind of the paper.

687
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,610
If we're found guilty,
it'll hurt you too...

688
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,362
(grunts)

689
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:52,450
ASSOCIATE: Sir. Mayor Choi is here.

690
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:53,659
Show him in!

691
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:54,785
(door opens)

692
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:57,204
(suspenseful music)

693
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:07,840
I thought these punks came to ask
for a favor, but they're threatening me.

694
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:10,926
No, sir. We're not. We wouldn't dare.

695
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:14,722
We wanted to consult you
in case we may bring you harm, so...

696
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,682
ELDER:
The nation will punish you for murder.

697
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:20,728
If you harm me,
I will punish you for that.

698
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:24,273
ELDER: There's your answer. Now go.

699
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:28,068
(music intensifies)

700
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:32,656
What is this?

701
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,742
(music fades)

702
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:45,252
(suspenseful music)

703
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:49,924
It's Seo Jaeyoung's secret paper.

704
00:41:58,557 --> 00:41:59,725
This is the original file.

705
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:05,439
There's nothing in this world
that can threaten you now.

706
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,987
(murmuring)

707
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:14,532
CHAEBONG: Choi Doha, that psycho bastard.

708
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:16,367
Damn it.

709
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:20,454
DR. HAN: He totally played with us
and disrespected us.

710
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:22,414
Damn it.

711
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:23,874
(clicks tongue)

712
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,751
(approaching footsteps)

713
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:29,505
Explain yourself.

714
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,758
Why did you have that paper?

715
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:34,385
Does that matter right now?

716
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:39,348
Of course, it does.
That was why we did all of this.

717
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:41,725
DR. HAN: How long did you have it?

718
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:45,354
Were you toying with us this whole time?
Were you?

719
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:47,731
Confess to the Prosecution.

720
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:52,111
I'll try to reduce your sentences
as much as I can. Then it'll be over.

721
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:53,195
(Dr. Han sighs)

722
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:54,655
-Of all the...
-(laughs)

723
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:59,535
Why should we be the only ones
to pay for what happened? Why?

724
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:02,621
You're an accomplice too, bastard.

725
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:05,291
(ominous music)

726
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:07,543
(Jaeyoung shrieking)

727
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:10,337
Yeah. We put the body in the trunk.

728
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:11,714
(breathing heavily)

729
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:14,717
What could we do?
He figured it out and tried to run.

730
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,137
You know my usual fishing spot?
Come meet me here.

731
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:20,681
I'll take care of the body.

732
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:23,392
CHAEBONG: Okay. We'll be right there.

733
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:25,477
(phone beeps)

734
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:27,813
(scoffs)

735
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:31,191
(horn honks)

736
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,613
(suspenseful music)

737
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:38,407
Dr. Han and the others are heading here.
Go and cause a car accident.

738
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:41,577
-Pardon?
-Cut them off,

739
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,704
or ram your car into his,

740
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:46,874
just cause a car accident, you bastard!

741
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,627
-(tires screeching)
-(crashing)

742
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,629
MAYOR CHOI:
You guys caused a car accident,

743
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:53,839
and alerted the world of Jaeyoung's death.

744
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:58,719
Stupid Gong Jihoon
alerted the world of the paper.

745
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:01,138
And I'm the one who sealed it all up.

746
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:04,808
I stopped the wildfire
before it spread into the mountain!

747
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:07,061
That's the point. Don't you get it?

748
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:10,939
You planned to kill Seo Jaeyoung too,
if you couldn't persuade him.

749
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:14,193
We killed him in the heat of the moment
because he figured it out.

750
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:20,157
You set up the whole thing,
but you'll dump it all on us?

751
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,326
(Chaebong laughs)

752
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,912
We won't go down alone.

753
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,997
You need to join us in hell.

754
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:28,374
(laughs)

755
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:29,541
Hell?

756
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:30,793
(laughing continues)

757
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,923
What will you get me for?

758
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,760
(ominous music)

759
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:50,813
MAYOR CHOI: I've already destroyed
the only proof that I was involved.

760
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:56,485
Will the three of you tell on me?

761
00:44:57,069 --> 00:45:01,198
Do you think the prosecution
will believe you without proof?

762
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:05,160
Are your brains incapable of thinking?

763
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:06,745
You stupid idiots.

764
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:12,376
Once the elder dumps you,
you're all done for.

765
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:17,339
Just do as I say.

766
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:22,803
I need to be spotless
for you guys to survive.

767
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,369
JUHEE: I'm here.

768
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:49,371
ELDER: You're here, Juhee.

769
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:50,914
JUHEE: What are you doing?

770
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:52,833
The weather's gotten cold.

771
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:58,255
Is it okay to burn that?

772
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:01,675
They're just scraps of paper.
Completely useless.

773
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,222
(ominous music)

774
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:12,352
Doha said you'd be in a very good mood.

775
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:15,147
When you get to my age,
you can't tell from just looking at me.

776
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:18,275
The wrinkles hide all the emotions.

777
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:20,486
You really are in a good mood.

778
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:23,280
I can read you like a book.

779
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:28,327
Do you remember how I was against it
when you said

780
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:30,621
you wanted to marry Doha?

781
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:32,498
Of course, I remember.

782
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:36,710
I hated you so much back then.

783
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:38,962
I wanted someone...

784
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:42,424
who would be a good supporter
for you and your career.

785
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:43,884
I know.

786
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:49,890
You always said I should bring someone
who was kind and faithful.

787
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:52,309
Because you were my future.

788
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:56,188
I wanted to entrust you with big things.

789
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:02,611
But now,

790
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:07,407
you'll have to support Doha instead.

791
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:22,089
(suspenseful music)

792
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:27,469
(door closes)

793
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:32,015
(clanking)

794
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,351
(keys clacking)

795
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:36,436
(tense music)

796
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,689
(gold bars clanging)

797
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:39,773
(clicks)

798
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:42,025
(thunder rumbling)

799
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,115
(clanks)

800
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:50,200
(thunder rumbles)

801
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:58,083
(rain pouring)

802
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:08,010
(tense music continues)

803
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:16,810
(thunder rumbling)

804
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:25,736
(music stops)

805
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:29,197
MAYOR CHOI: Where's Professor Seo's paper?

806

HYEJIN: Why are you asking me?

807
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:38,081
If you saw the paper,
you'd know just how dangerous it was.

you'll die.

00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,765
Without a trace, without a single witness,

812
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:58,268
you'll disappear from this world.

Give me the paper and go to New York.

No, nothing.
