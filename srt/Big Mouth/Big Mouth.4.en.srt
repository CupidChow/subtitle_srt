BIG MOUTH

3
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,754
THIS SHOW IS A WORK OF FICTION

4
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:48,965
THE EVENTS AND ENTITIES
THAT APPEAR HEREIN ARE FICTIONAL

5
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,176
(ominous music)

6
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,553
(clamoring)

00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:57,932

00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,525

(groans)

12
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,157
Get off!

13
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,784
(gurgling)

14
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,911
(solemn music)

15
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,790
CRPT, proceed!

16
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,461
(guards whistling)

17
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:28,588

(clamoring)

20
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,764
-Come on.
-Hey, get up!

21
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:39,307
-(thumps)
-(music stops)

22
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:42,936
Sir.

23
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:44,646
(sighs)

24
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,731
(ominous music)

25
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,444
WARDEN PARK: Send him to the medical room.

26
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:52,612
PARAMEDIC: Go.

27
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:58,076
You chose the wrong person.

28
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,370
You should've chosen me, not them.

29
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,164
(scoffs)

30
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,708

EPISODE 4

35
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,735
(music stops)

36
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,530
(heart monitor beeping)

37
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,991
(hissing)

38
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:41,327
(door creaks close)

39
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:46,457
WARDEN PARK: This is why they say
you can't scratch your own back.

40
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,084
You can't read your own future?

41
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,545
You didn't see that you'd get stabbed?

42
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,047
(breathing heavily)

43
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,551
WARDEN PARK:
Don't move and just stay still.

44
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,890
Your life in prison would be comfortable
as long as you don't cause trouble.

45
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:05,268
Why did you have to take
Park Changho's side?

46
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,231
(ominous music)

47
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,612

48
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:20,116

BIG MOUTH

(music stops)

51
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,045
(birds chirping)

52
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,552
(suspenseful music)

53
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,318
(exhales sharply)

54
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:03,451
JERRY: Gosh, this is so unfair.
Why did they lock us in here too?

55
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:04,577
We're the victims here.

56
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:05,703
(sighs)

57
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:09,207
Warden Park seemed really mad.

58
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,584
This won't end with solitary. Right, Boss?

59
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,674
Boss. Are you sleeping?

60
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,301
JERRY: Boss?

61
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,436
(lock buzzes)

62
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,272
(door opens)

63
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,691
Come out if your door's open.

64
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,986
(suspenseful music)

65
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,531
PRISONER 1: What? What is this?

66
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:42,740
Long time no see.

67
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:46,244
Are you only letting them out?

68
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,204
Hands on your head.
Leave in a single file now.

69
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,748
PRISONER 2: What about us?
This isn't what you promised!

70
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,250
You should let us out too!

71
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,419
-Move.
-PRISONER 2: Are you listening to me?

72
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:56,129
-Hey!
-PRISONER 1: Let us go!

73
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:57,297
Let us go too!

74
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,424
Warden Park!

75
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:00,758
(prisoner 2 screams)

76
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,678
-(banging on door)
-Guards!

77
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,222
Hey!

78
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,016
(panting)

79
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,687
What a mess.

80
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:18,901
CHAEBONG: It would've been done and dusted
if the warden hadn't done anything.

81
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,571
Here he is.

82
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,656
(ominous music)

83
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,159
(glass shatters)

84
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,164
I told you not to do anything.

85
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,791
Why did you send the CRPT?

86
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:38,463
If you let them be, they would've fought,
and Park Changho would be dead!

87
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:39,672
CHAEBONG: Darn it.

88
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:43,217
I gave it to you on a silver platter,
but you guys messed it up.

89
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,303
WARDEN PARK: Are you blaming me
for cleaning up after you?

90
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,971
Are you saying you've done a good job?

91
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,432
What if it didn't end
with just Park Changho dying?

92
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:55,188
What if others died in the stabbing?
Who's going to be responsible for it?

93
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,483
If the Correctional Services Bureau
starts an investigation,

94
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:01,277
I'm not the only one who goes down.
It'll be over for you three too.

95
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,030
It should be something
I can handle myself,

96
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,823
at the very least.

97
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,701
DR. HAN:
Forget it. It's already in the past.

98
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,578
Just make sure
Mr. Gong doesn't hear about it.

99
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:15,625
Everyone in the prison
already knows about this.

100
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,460
You think he doesn't have
connections in here?

101
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,045
If Gong Jihoon finds out,

102
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,548
we'll never be able to kill Park Changho.

103
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:26,803
Regardless of connections,
stop Gong Jihoon from finding out. Got it?

104
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,806
Silence people and cover their eyes...

105
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,767
(sighs deeply)

106
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,268
There are loads of them, you know.

107
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:37,021
It's not something easy to do.

108
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:40,108
If it was easy, we would've done it.

109
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:43,444
You think we gave you three bills
just for the hell of it?

110
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,282
I'll return that money to you. Okay?

111
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,536
How much more do you need?

112
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,080
CHAEBONG: You don't want to fix it.

113
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,582
You want to renegotiate. Isn't that it?

114
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,669
DOOGEUN: You want more money?

115
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,046
(gasps)

116
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:06,050
Warden Park,
you're a proper thief, aren't you?

117
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:11,472
If I get on Mr. Gong's bad side,
I will lose my job.

118
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,892
I'm risking my life to help you,
but you're calling me a thief?

119
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,436
CHAEBONG: Hey, that's enough.

120
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,023
Warden Park.

121
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:25,778
You need to finish your job
with Park Changho first. Okay?

122
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,364
The door has already been open.

123
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,701
If the conditions are favorable,
I can always open it again.

124
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,204
That's right. I knew it.

125
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,330
(laughter)

126
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,082
CHAEBONG: This guy...

127
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,877
(laughter continues)

128
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,046
-He's so easy to read.
-DR. HAN: Have a drink.

129
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,131
-Sit.
-Let's have a drink.

130
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:46,215
Yes, we should.

131
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:49,093
Sit down and relax, you punk.

132
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,145
(patient gurgling, choking)

133
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:00,313
WOMAN: What's wrong?

134
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,357
Excuse me! Someone help us!

135
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,110
-WOMAN: Honey!
-Are you okay?

136
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,904
Someone help him!

137
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,572
This is urgent. Call the doctor!

138
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:11,824
WOMAN: Oh, no!

139
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,077
Oh, no! Honey.

140
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:18,247
HEAD NURSE: How could you make
such a mistake with your experience?

141
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,750
It wasn't a mistake.
I did what the order said.

142
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,378
Who ordered you
to inject 2mg of dexamethasone?

143
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,672
If you look at the EMR...

144
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,758
(ominous music)

145
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,095
What?

146
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,223
DOCTOR: It says 1mg.

147
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:37,183
It's still not a mistake?

148
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,852
This won't do. Including your attitude!

149
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:43,481
You're unqualified to work as a nurse
who takes care of patients' lives, Ms. Ko.

150
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:44,690
(sighs)

151
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,276
I took this before the rounds.

152
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,861
MIHO: Do you see this?

153
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,404
Dexamethasone 2mg.

154
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,365
What? You're right.

155
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,159
DOCTOR: Why did this change?

156
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,161
MIHO: You should check the CCTV footage.

157
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:00,873
Let's see who is the unqualified one
that plays with patients' lives.

158
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,417
(ominous music)

159
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,713
WOMAN (over PA): The medical device
guest seminar will start at 5 p.m.,

160
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,382
so please go to the conference room.

161
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:10,508
You should all go.

162
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,593
I repeat.

163
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,638
The medical device guest seminar
will start at 5 p.m.,

164
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,099
so please go to the conference room...

165
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,269
Ms. Jang. You did it, right?
And the head nurse told you to.

166
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,480
I don't know anything about it.

167
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,899
(suspenseful music)

168
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:29,944
(scoffs)

169
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,366
DR. KIM: The reality is
that it is still too difficult

170
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:38,578
to catch the minute details
of the state of the cartilage

171
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,913
simply by reading MRI scans.

172
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,874
Telling the difference
between healthy and unhealthy cartilage

173
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,127
is determined by the resolution...

174
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,046
NURSE 1: Did you hear? Ms. Ko's husband...

175
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,090
NURSE 2: I know. I heard he's Big Mouse.

176
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,967
NURSE 1: She's so shameless.

177
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:57,138
How can she keep her head up like that
when her husband is a heinous criminal?

178
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:58,723
Well, she's got a feisty temper.

179
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,267
What an awful fate to have such a husband.

180
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,102
NURSE 2: I know. Seriou...

181
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:04,687
DR. KIM: Thank you.

182
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,190
(applause)

183
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,650
Thank you, Dr. Kim.

184
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,613
We'll have a quick Q and A session.
Any questions?

185
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,078
I'm Ko Miho from the Cancer Ward.

186
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:25,249
(scoffs)
We have someone who's impatient.

187
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,293
Go ahead.

188
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,338
J&J ELECTRONIC MEDICAL DEVICE
GUEST SEMINAR

189
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:33,007
(crowd murmuring)

190
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,343
Ms. Ko?

191
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:42,308
I have the unpublished paper
of the late Professor Seo Jaeyoung.

192
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,852
(ominous music)

193
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,854
(crowd murmuring)

194
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,283
MIHO'S FATHER: Have you lost your mind?

195
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,954
Someone died and Changho ended up in jail
because of that paper.

196
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,957
What if someone tries to hurt you?
What will you do?

197
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,086
What else should I do?
I was at a dead end with no leads.

198
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,712
I don't know.

199
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:15,883
I threw the bait,
so I'm sure someone will get hooked.

200
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,762
(ominous music)

201
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,858
(ominous music continues)

202
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,797
(music intensifies)

203
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,805
(music stops)

204
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,223
(indistinct chatter)

205
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,349
(sighs)

206
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,729
(eerie music)

207
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,673
(suspenseful music)

208
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,900
(tense music)

209
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:04,074
(music stops)

210
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,287
(ominous music)

211
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,922
(music intensifies)

212
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:22,927
-Oh, my gosh!
-Oh, my gosh!

213
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,011
You scared me.

214
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:25,471
What?

215
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,556
Why? Is someone following you?

216
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,352
(exhales sharply)

217
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,062
I must be on edge these days.

218
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,022
My goodness.

219
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,234
(phone vibrating)

220
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,654
Hello?

221
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,239
MAYOR CHOI: Is this Ms. Ko Miho?

222
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,616
Yes, it is.

223
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,493
I'm Mayor Choi Doha.

224
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,704
(ominous music)

225
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:53,666
I heard you have
Professor Seo Jaeyoung's paper.

226
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,919
MIHO: I wanted to meet you regarding that.

227
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,504
Are you free tomorrow?

228
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,507
Yes, I know where that is.

229
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,717
Okay.

230
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,803
-(phone clicks)
-Was that Mayor Choi?

231
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,513
(chuckles)
Yes.

232
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:10,182
See? I told you someone would get hooked.

233
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,767
You were lying about having the paper.

234
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,185
What will you do when you see him?

235
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,937
I have a plan.

236
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,188
My goodness.

237
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,609
I'm so tired because I haven't slept well
the past few days.

238
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,070
Should I get some beer?
Want to have it and get a good sleep?

239
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,406
Let's get soju and make soju bombs.

240
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:27,157
(Miho's father laughs)

241
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,325
MIHO: Let's go.

242
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:33,122
MIHO'S FATHER:
What should we eat with our drinks?

243
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,331
MIHO: What did you buy?

244
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,250
MIHO'S FATHER: Some chicken.
Do you want braised spicy chicken?

245
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,376
MIHO: Sounds great.

246
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,879
-MIHO'S FATHER: Okay. I can do that.
-MIHO: Will you drink too?

247
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,308
You're lucky you didn't get hurt badly.

248
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:55,519
I am unlucky in every way,

249
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:58,439
but I have a long life like you...
(chuckles, groans)

250
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,316
That stings.

251
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,359
(room leader sighs)

252
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,320
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

253
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,571
No.

254
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:08,449
Big Mouse shouldn't apologize
easily like that.

255
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:09,533
(laughs)

256
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:13,787
But are you really Big Mouse?

257
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,790
(chuckles)

258
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:17,917
Why do you ask suddenly?

259
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,171
As the knife went in,

260
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,840
I suddenly got worried.

261
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:29,386
If you're a fake
and you can't make my wish come true,

262
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,056
then I'm dying for no reason.

263
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,310
Hey.

264
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,647
It's okay. Be honest with me.

265
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,650
Are you really Big Mouse?

266
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,112
(laughs)

267
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:48,822
I am Big Mouse.

268
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:51,867
(sighs)

269
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,745
(chuckles)

270
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,332
My name is No Park.

271
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:01,710
My father's surname was No,
and my mother's surname was Park.

272
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,797
That's what they called me
at the orphanage.

273
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,092
I'm introducing myself to Big Mouse.

274
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,677
(both laugh)

275
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,137
(mutters)

276
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,181
I need to find your daughter now.

277
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:16,016
You risked your life
and took a knife for me.

278
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,018
What will you do with those guys?

279
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,562
What should I do?

280
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,147
You said so yourself.

281
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:26,443
Whether it's kindness or evil,
you always repay it tenfold.

282
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,028
(inhales)

283
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,155
Should I kill them?

284
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,616
(laughs)

285
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,328
(chuckles)
Gosh, that stings.

286
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,330
It stings so much.

287
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:40,499
(door opens)

288
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:43,377
PRISONER: You said Warden Park
was on our side. Why are we locked up?

289
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:47,089
You said the VIPs had our backs.
You told me to trust you!

290
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,341
-(banging on door)
-Hey, 5362!

291
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,761
We got stuck in this crap
because we trusted you, bastard!

292
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:53,846
(pants)

293
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,556
Hey, 5362!

294
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:59,309
PRISONER:
Say something, you jerk. Are you sleeping?

295
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,103
Shut the hell up.

296
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,522
(prisoner screaming)

297
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,524
Hey, 5362!

298
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,777
(screaming continues)

299
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,780
(alarm blares)

300
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:15,451
(footsteps)

301
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,620
(suspenseful music)

302
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,212
TRUSTWORTHY LAW, TRUSTWORTHY CORRECTION

303
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,297
(door closes)

304
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:33,802
WARDEN PARK: Stop right there.

305
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,932
(sighs)

306
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:40,893
Was it you?

307
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,896
It wasn't you. Right?

308
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,278
(music intensifies)

309
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:09,129
He hung himself in solitary,

310
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:12,883
but it's not easy to commit suicide there.

311
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,844
Isn't murder even harder?

312
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,222
That's right.

313
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:22,768
But it's strange.

314
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:26,772
The guy who tried to kill you died.

315
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,483
(suspenseful music)

316
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,920
(music stops)

317
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,138
(footsteps approaching)

318
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,222
MAYOR CHOI: Ms. Ko?

319
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,434
Hello.

320
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:08,689
I'm sorry for making you come here.
I had a lunch appointment nearby.

321
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:12,317
Let me introduce myself.
Attorney Park Changho is my husband.

322
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,072
Do you really have Professor Seo's paper?

323
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,117
(chuckles)

324
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,369
I'm looking for it, too.

325
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:28,000
MIHO: I need help, Mayor. Please help me.

326
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,794
MAYOR CHOI:
You speak as though I have an obligation.

327
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,380
You're the one who dragged my husband
into this case.

328
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,842
Do you still trust your husband?

329
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:41,430
Real con artists
scam people closest to them first.

330
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,474
My husband isn't Big Mouse.

331
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:47,144
That's why the word "betrayal" exists.

332
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,522
They betray the trust of those
they treasure most.

333
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,608
(suspenseful music)

334
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,070
MIHO: Have you heard of a DNR request?

335
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,991
It's consent to refuse CPR.

336
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:03,410
The hospital is forcing
cancer patients' families to sign it.

337
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:04,536
They're even paying them.

338
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,121
Why is that important?

339
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,541
I think the DNR requests are related
to Professor Seo's paper.

340
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:11,752
Have you...

341
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,631
heard anything about the paper
from the director?

342
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,634
Are you suspecting my wife?

343
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,219
I'm certain she knows something.

344
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,303
MAYOR CHOI: You're wrong.

345
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,387
She doesn't know.

346
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,017
How are you so sure?

347
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,396
Because he's my husband.

348
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:35,442
Because I know him better than anyone.

349
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,571
MAYOR CHOI: Because she's my wife.

350
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,532
Because I know her

351
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,118
better than anyone.

352
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:52,042
SECRETARY: Sir, it's time to leave.

353
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,335
Get home safely.

354
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,715
(suspenseful music)

355
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:07,975

CHANGHO: After No. 5362 died,

358
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:18,193
more people wanted me
to grant their wishes

359
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:21,071
and more eyes started watching me too.

360
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,160
Ninety-five.

361
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,997
Even though 5362's death
was announced as a suicide,

362
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,582
there was a small bit of fear
that it was a murder.

363
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:33,875
Ninety-seven.

364
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,253
The truth was being eaten away by lies.

365
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,587
Ninety-eight.

366
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,341
Ninety-nine.

367
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:44,594
One hundred.

368
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,513
ESTABLISHING LAW AND ORDER

369
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,598
(upbeat music)

370
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,393
Wasn't that a nice workout?

371
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,562
-Yes, Boss.
-Wipe your sweat.

372
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,441
(sighs)

373
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:05,907
But why did he suddenly commit suicide?

374
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,246
(horn honking)

375
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,456

JIHOON (in English): Hi, Mr. Big Mouse.

379
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,989
(suspenseful music)

380
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,158
JIHOON (in Korean):
What are you doing? Have a seat.

381
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,744
(chair clanks)

382
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:55,749
I heard you've been quite busy.

383
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:58,668
The rumors I hear on the outside
are quite intense.

384
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:00,879
Why are you here?

385
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:09,262
Can you return the 100-billion-won
investment of Lala Capital?

386
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:13,016
Why do you think I have that money?

387
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,102
(suspenseful music)

388
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:18,814
You know who invested that money.

389
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,191
(Jihoon scoffs)

390
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:25,654
How did you come up with the idea
of touching the NR Forum?

391
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:26,988
You're so fearless.

392
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:31,243
(sighs)

393
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,162
Forget everything else.
Just give me the money.

394
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,247
Then I won't...

395
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,124
You won't have a reason to let me live.

396
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:42,879
Let's get to the point.

397
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:46,133
Name five clients that you... No.

398
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:47,801
Scratch that.

399
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,762
Name five clients...

400
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:54,933
that Big Mouse sold drugs to.

401
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,185
JIHOON: Starting with frequent flyers.

402
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,271
(ominous music)

403
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,277
What? You don't remember?

404
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:08,196
No way.

405
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,616
I'm sure you won't say you forgot
when you kept a ledger.

406
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:16,788
My rule is that while I might sell drugs,
I don't sell out my customers.

407
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,081
Seriously.
(laughs)

408
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:21,209
(laughing continues)

409
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,711
My gosh.

410
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:24,629
Okay.

411
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:28,300
JIHOON: I'll come back this weekend,
so make your decision by then.

412
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,387
Keep in mind,

413
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:36,641
if you don't tell me your clients' names,
I'll know that you're fake then.

414
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:42,481
Then you'll really die.

415
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,566

00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:16,097
Hurry up and go in.

00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,557

426
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:36,493
Hello?

427
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:39,204
Did you know that the money Big Mouse took
was Gong Jihoon's funds?

428
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:41,414
Mr. Park Changho?

429
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:42,624
I can't talk long.

430
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,252
The real Big Mouse was the one
who turned me into Big Mouse,

431
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:46,336
not Gong Jihoon.

432
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,130
He touched the NR Forum's money
and couldn't handle it,

433
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,258
so he used me as bait. Do you understand?

434
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,218
MAYOR CHOI: So?

435
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:57,097
Did you know there is a ledger
with Big Mouse's drug deals?

436
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,266
(tense music)

437
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:02,227
CHANGHO: If I don't name five top clients,
he said he'd kill me for real.

438
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,645
Who said that?

439
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,064
Gong Jihoon.

440
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,651
(ominous music)

441
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:11,903
Did you make copies?

442
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,405
You told me not to.

443
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:15,740
(scoffs)

444
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,784
CHANGHO: I need your help.

445
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,996
I'm sure Gong Jihoon
got the list from the prosecution.

446
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:22,956
Can you look into it?

447
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,128
If I don't say five names by this week,
I'll really die.

448
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,922
CHANGHO: Please help me, Mayor Choi.

What are you doing?

456
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,944
I was calling Mayor Choi
to see how he was. Why?

457
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,032
(ominous music)

458
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:02,495
Get someone we can trust
to tail Prosecutor Choi Joongrak.

459
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:05,373
I want you to watch Gong Jihoon yourself.

460
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,127
Find out what kind of connection
there is between them.

461
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:10,754

00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,014
No!

466
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:23,141

What is it?

471
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:33,443
Let us out. Big Mouse is going to kill us.

472
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:36,488
What kind of nonsense is that?
How can Big Mouse get in here?

473
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:37,781
You saw how 5362 died!

474

(bangs on door)

475
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:40,575
I've told you it's suicide.

476
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,118
-Hey.
-It wasn't suicide.

477
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:44,287
It wasn't suicide, you jerks!

478
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:47,332
Big Mouse killed him!

-Calm down!
-Let me out!

484
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:00,762
I need to get out.

485
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:03,431
I can't die like this, you jerks!

486

WARDEN PARK: Is it that bad?

491
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:21,241
GUARD: Their fear and anxiety are extreme,

492
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:23,785
and I suspect they have PTSD too.

Get them treated first
and send them to the General Wing.

00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:29,708
Yes, sir.

495
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,586
ROOM LEADER: It's your turn, Warden Park.

496
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:34,754
(Warden Park mutters)

497
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,005
Where did I put it?

498
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:39,134
ROOM LEADER: Here.

499
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,511
-(door closes)
-I died.

500
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,806
Where did you learn to play Go?

501
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,808
You're just playing tricks.

502
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:49,269
I learned it the traditional way.
(sighs)

503
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:53,398
PRISONER: Gosh, it tastes so bad.

504
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:55,692
(indistinct chattering)

505
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:00,947
(ominous music)

506
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,283
Boss.

507
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,834
PRISONER: They're totally out of it.

508
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,627
I heard they got treatment too.

509
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,796
If they were going to get so scared,

510
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,340
they shouldn't have acted up
and tried to kill Big Mouse.

511
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:23,219
Look at Big Mouse. He's glaring at them.

512
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:28,141
PRISONER: My gosh. Isn't being
in solitary safer for them?

513
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:31,603
You know 5362? He committed suicide.

514
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:33,980
They say he had no reason
to commit suicide.

515
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:36,900
(clanging)

516
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,115
(suspenseful music)

517
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,252
(chair screeches)

518
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,883
Boss. Aren't you going to eat?

519
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,015
(retches)

520
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,475
(thuds)

521
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:13,061
(prisoners clamoring)

522
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,398
(thuds)

523
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,818
(shrieking)

524
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,778
-PRISONER 1: What's going on?
-PRISONER 2: Guard!

525
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,823
(whistle blowing)

526
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:26,950
GUARD 1: Who is that?

527
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:28,618
Send everyone out.

528
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,578
GUARD 2: Call the doctor. Hurry!

529
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,914
(tense music)

530
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,165
CHANGHO: Perhaps...

531
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:37,627
Big Mouse might be in here.

532
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,005
He could be somewhere very close.

533
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:48,429
(music continues)

534
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,937
(music stops)

535
00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:00,692
DO NOT ENTER, POLICE LINE
UNDER INVESTIGATION

536
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,819
FORENSICS OFFICER:
We need to do an autopsy,

537
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:05,405
but it seems he was poisoned
with potassium cyanide.

538
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:07,574
It's the poison,
most commonly known as cyanide.

539
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:10,660
OFFICER:
So there's the possibility of murder.

540
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:12,787
How long has he been out of solitary?

541
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:15,957
About four hours.

542
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,376
OFFICER: Let's check the route
the victims took first.

543
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:19,919
Can we check the CCTV footage?

544
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,047
(tense music)

545
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:26,551
(keyboard clacking)

546
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,601
(keyboard clacks)

547
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,524
Hold on. Rewind it.

548
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,902
(computer rewinds)

549
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,612
Over there. Stop.

550
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,697
(suspenseful music)

551
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,449
GUARD: Isn't that cyanide?

552
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,075
It is.

553
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,953
OFFICER: He committed suicide.
That's clear evidence.

554
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:58,041
GUARD: How did he get it?
Nothing was caught on camera.

555
00:31:58,583 --> 00:31:59,751
OFFICER: True.

556
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:07,008
(music intensifies)

557
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:12,805
(suspenseful music)

558
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,188
Boss.

559
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:23,149
I'm...

560
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,860
really curious.

561
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,153
Earlier,

562
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,698
the guys who died at the mess hall...

563
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,158
-(door lock buzzes)
-(door opens)

564
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:33,910
Nobody move!

565
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,454
Anyone who moves will die.

566
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,165
Everyone, get up and go outside.

567
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:41,709
(tense music)

568
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,213
Get out!

569
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:54,430
(clattering)

570
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,485
TRUSTWORTHY LAW

571
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:09,570
(music intensifies)

572
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:22,667
GUARD: Turn around.

573
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:29,007
(clattering)

574
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,527
(music stops)

575
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:58,995
What are you looking at?
Put your heads back in!

576
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:05,877
You punks have no fear these days. Do you?

577
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,097
(ominous music)

578
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,280
All of the guys
who had started a fight with you

579
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:37,408
all committed suicide.

580
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:42,080
WARDEN PARK: We're lucky the CCTV
caught them taking the poison.

581
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:45,583
Otherwise, the idiots here
would've treated you like a messiah.

582
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:52,423
But what scared them so much
that led them to commit suicide?

583
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,804
I'm just asking because I'm curious.
Why did they do it?

584
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,390
Don't overestimate yourself.

585
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,851
You're not that great.

586
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:07,688
How many criminals do you think
I've seen in the 20 years

587
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,982
I worked
in the Correctional Services Bureau?

588
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,234
There were tons.

589
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:15,321
Whether they're unfairly charged,
heinous, stupid,

590
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:18,366
I can size them up by their smell alone.

591
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,118
(sniffing)

592
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:25,039
(ominous music)

593
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,879
You're Big Mouse?

594
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:36,050
You're just an incompetent
third-rate lawyer who's also unlucky.

595
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:39,637
You're scared you'll get beat up
if you don't pretend to be Big Mouse.

596
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,598
That's why you keep glaring at people
and inciting them.

597
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,559
You're just conning everyone.

598
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,398
It'd be nice
if all detectives were like you.

599
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:52,316
Want to testify for me?

600
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,656
(tense music)

601
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,617
WARDEN PARK: You have four days left.

602
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:05,705
If you can list the names
of people you sold drugs to,

603
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:08,166
I'll really believe in you.

604
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:13,045
But... if you can't provide the names,

605
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:16,507
you will die in here

606
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,760
without a single soul knowing.

607
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,846
(high-pitched tone)

608
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,602
(tense music)

609
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,206
MAN: You're here.

610
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:49,916
How is the elder feeling?

611
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,918
-He's so-so.
-So-so?

612
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,504
Show him to the sitting room.

613
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,466
Please wait. He has a guest.

614
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:00,551
Who?

615
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,140
Why is he leaving
when you asked him a question?

616
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,433
(scoffs)

617
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:09,560
(suspenseful music)

618
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:10,686
(Jihoon sighs)

619
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:14,190
SEUNGTAE:
I get so anxious whenever I come here.

620
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:15,983
Do you feel like that?

621
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:19,111
Anxious?
We're not at a level to get anxious.

622
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:21,155
(Seungtae breathes heavily)

623
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:23,574
Why is it taking so long?

624
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:26,494
Is it an important visitor?

625
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:27,745
-Hey.
-SEUNGTAE: Yes?

626
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,163
I'm going to the bathroom.

627
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:32,750
Again? So you are nervous.

628
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,252
I'm not.

629
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,128
(Jihoon gasps)

630
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:39,715
(music intensifies)

631
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:41,759
Juhee?

632
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:44,762
You were his visitor?

633
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:46,806
Why are you so surprised?

634
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:49,433
I have been visiting him here
since I was young.

635
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:53,938
Do you want to get dinner after?
I need to talk to you about something.

636
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:55,106
Aren't you busy?

637
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:58,192
Our meeting won't take long. Wait here.

638
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:01,487
The elder has refused to see you two.

639
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:06,033
Why?

640
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,245
Is he still mad?

641
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:13,165
He said you're not allowed in
until you get back the 100 billion won.

642
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:14,417
(laughs)

643
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:19,505
JIHOON: Tell him I'm here to report
something about that issue.

644
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:23,551
That I have something I have to tell him.

645
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:26,595
Do you want to get the wooden pillow
thrown at you again?

646
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,973
(laughs)

647
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,018
(exhales heavily)

648
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:34,061
-Seungtae.
-Yes?

649
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:35,730
Let's go.

650
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:39,525
Go to the Chinese restaurant
at Charles Hotel by 6 p.m.

651
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,653
What for?

652
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:47,491
Mayor Choi is meeting the majority
party leader and the secretary general.

653
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,035
He wants you to support him.

654
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:54,040
I guess we won't be having dinner.

655
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:55,708
MAN: Good day.

656
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,753
(footsteps)

657
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:03,883
Support, my foot.

658
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:09,180
Is Mayor Choi finally
getting into politics with the big boys?

659
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:13,309
Doesn't the main dish
usually come after the appetizer?

660
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:15,019
You want me to be his taste tester?

661
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:18,856
Ask the elder.
I don't know anything about it.

662
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:23,652
(Jihoon laughs)

663
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:27,239
(coughs)

664
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:29,658
I guess the elder is planning
to give Mayor Choi his support.

665
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:31,786
Shut up.

666
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,706
Everything's wrong with you,
but your mouth is the biggest problem.

667
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,626
Darn it.

668
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:42,004
(gurgles)

669
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:44,090
Hot!
(coughing)

670
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:47,134
Here. Don't be so nervous.

671
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,220
(coughing)
Who says I'm nervous?

672
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,722
(upbeat music)

673
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,659
(laughter)

674
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:16,914
MAN: Mr. Gong, what brings you here?

675
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:20,459
We came to eat,
and we heard you guys were here.

676
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:21,794
(Jihoon chuckles)

677
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:24,046
Say hello. This is Choi Manho
of the New Nation Party

678
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,631
and Secretary General Kim Gabju.

679
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:29,885
Hello, nice to meet you. I'm Cha Seungtae.

680
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,262
(mutters)

681
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:33,055
(grumbles)

682
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,474
Oh, my.

683
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:39,186
You're OC Group's Chairman Cha's son.

684
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,271
(Seungtae laughs)

685
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:42,940
I'm glad you're here. Have a seat.

686
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:45,317
-SEUNGTAE: Thank you.
-GENERAL KIM: Have a seat.

687
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:49,155
Let me introduce you.
This is the mayor of Gucheon...

688
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:52,408
I know Mayor Choi Doha very well.

689
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:53,617
GENERAL KIM: You do?

690
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:56,370
MAYOR CHOI:
Yes, they're good friends of mine.

691
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,665
I receive a lot of help from them.

692
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:01,625
GENERAL KIM: A press company
and a family-owned business.

693
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:04,753
I thought your wife's family was powerful,

694
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:07,006
-but you have powerful friends, too.
-That's right.

695
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:08,340
JIHOON: Let me pour you a drink.

696
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:09,467
(grunts)

697
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,135
(laughs)

698
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:16,599
Look at this. You came here
for Mayor Choi. Didn't you?

699
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:18,309
(laughter)

700
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:22,480
Please take good care of Mayor Choi Doha.

701
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:25,566
GENERAL KIM: Who would refuse someone
as competent as Mayor Choi?

702
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:28,402
Don't just settle with being mayor.

703
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:31,238
Let's get you a seat
during the next general election.

704
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:35,826
If you give me the chance,
I would gladly take it.

705
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:38,996
We will take good care of you two.

706
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:42,416
If you need anything,
give us a call any time.

707
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,169
Since you're saying this,

708
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:47,338
we must take good care of him.

709
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:48,422
(laughter)

710
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:52,259
Look at this.
A person doesn't find his position.

711
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:56,972
The position recognizes the person.

712
00:41:57,556 --> 00:42:00,476
Don't worry.
I'll find you a great position.

713
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,353
Thank you, sir.

714
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:09,985
(tense music)

715
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:19,620
(water running)

716
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:24,875
(door closes)

717
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:29,922
(water running)

718
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:34,510
MAYOR CHOI: Thank you for today, Mr. Gong.

719
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:39,306
JIHOON:
Are you doing whatever you want now?

720
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,852
I told you not to cross the line.

721
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,981
Advancing in politics?

722
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:49,358
(laughing)

723
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:52,987
Without consulting me?

724
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:56,198
Didn't I tell you
I wasn't going to serve another term?

725
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,997
When did you decide things on your own?

726
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:08,002
Do you think all you need to do
is look good to the elder?

727
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:12,464
You're no better than dog food without us.
You know that.

728
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:14,049
Watch what you're saying.

729
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:18,804
If you think I'm dog food,
aren't you making a mistake?

730
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:20,639
(scoffs)

731
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:24,476
(screams, laughs)

732
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,355
This is the problem.

733
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:32,318
I undoubtedly thought I was your owner.

734
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:34,778
Aren't I?

735
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:41,869
I got the prosecutor without any roots
a job within the central district.

736
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:46,081
I made an organization
and used the press to make him mayor.

737
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:49,043
I completely wrote your profile

738
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,670
using my money and energy.

739
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:55,674
But now that you've grown a little,

740
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:57,926
you act all cocky.

741
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:02,598
(grumbles)

742
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:05,976
You want to cut your leash

743
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:09,521
and act like a lone wolf?

744
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,690
(laughs)

745
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,943
What about everything you got

746
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:17,946
while I have been mayor?

747
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:20,866
-Everything we got?
-The industrial park business license,

748
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:23,911
changing the purpose of using land,
government contracts bidding info.

749
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:27,915
Do you know how much money you took
using me as the mayor figurehead?

750
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:31,210
I'm quitting my job as mayor
because I'm sick of it.

751
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:33,796
Because what you do makes me sick.

752
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:37,591
I see. So...

753
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:39,968
you're...

754
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:42,805
determined to die, aren't you?

755
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:45,849
If we both got here on the same boat,
you should keep rowing.

756
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:48,310
We'll all die if we don't reach land.

757
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:50,020
You're my owner?

758
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:51,897
You're just an oarsman.

759
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:54,191
You'll do what I say and row.

760
00:44:58,195 --> 00:44:59,863
(laughing)

761
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:01,865
(grunts)

762
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,283
(Jihoon groans)

763
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:05,828
(groaning)

764
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:08,789
MAYOR CHOI: Don't cross the line.

765
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:10,040
Be polite.

766
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:12,334
You bastard.

767
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:14,294
(Jihoon grunting)

768
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,004
SEUNGTAE: Hey. What are you doing?

769
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:17,840
Relax.

770
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:19,508
(grunting)

771
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:20,801
SEUNGTAE: Hey.

772
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,511
(grunting)

773
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:23,721
(exhales)

774
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:26,640
SEUNGTAE:
What are you doing? They're right outside.

775
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:29,560
-My gosh.
-(exhales sharply)

776
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:31,061
I'll keep in mind

777
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:34,273
how you helped me today.

778
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:38,318
(door opens)

779
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:41,697
(door closes)

780
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:47,327
SEUNGTAE: You didn't get beat up
by Mayor Choi. Did you?

781
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:52,541
Keep your head held high
for as long as you can.

782
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:54,710
It'll all be over soon.

783
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:58,464
Things won't go as you want it to.
The elder won't allow it.

784
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:03,260
-Seungtae.
-Yes?

785
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:06,263
Would the elder leave a traitor alone?

786
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:07,931
A traitor?

787
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:10,726
Did Mayor Choi betray him?

788
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:12,811
(suspenseful music)

789
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:18,025
(sighs)
If it comes out, that jerk...

790
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:23,697
can kiss politics goodbye.
His life will be over.

791
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:26,533
(laughs)

792
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,869
(laughter)

793
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:31,497
(screams)

794
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:37,628
(train whirring)

795
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:41,381
(ominous music)

796
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:47,513
(suspenseful music)

797
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:56,271
(beeping)

798
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:58,607
(beeps)

799
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,656
(tense music)

800
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:21,755
(ominous music)

801
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,018
(phone beeps)

802
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:44,528
(music stops)

803
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:49,741
MIHO: Dad, I'm being followed.
I'm sure of it this time.

804
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:53,120
Let's catch him.
If we catch him, everything will unravel.

805
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:04,840
(tense music)

806
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:14,057
(ominous music)

807
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:20,647
(keypad clacking)

808
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,405
(tense music continues)

809
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,163
(gasps)

810
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:41,335
MIHO'S FATHER: It's him. Right?

811
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:42,419
I can't tell.

812
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:48,800
(tense music)

813
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,969
Darn it.

814
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:57,893
-(taser crackling)
-(all exclaim)

815
00:48:57,976 --> 00:48:59,645
-My gosh.
-What the heck?

816
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:01,313
(mumbling)

817
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:03,398
(tense music)

818
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:05,859
MIHO'S FATHER: You punk. Who are you?

819
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,653
Take this off, jerk.

820
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:14,368
What? Aren't you Mayor Choi's secretary?

821
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:16,578
What?

822
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:19,581
Right?

823
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,085
(ominous music)

824
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:38,308
(phone vibrating)

825
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:40,477
Talk to me.

826
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:41,770
I'm Ko Miho.

827
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:45,399
If you don't come and explain yourself,
he's going to the police.

828
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:48,360
Where should I go?

829
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:51,655
Okay.

830
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:53,740
(suspenseful music)

831
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:58,495
(lock beeps)

832
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:02,791
(safe door closes)

833
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:12,342
JUNG CHAEBONG, LEE KWANGPYO,
KIM HANUL, PARK KWANGYEOL...

834
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:18,056
(music stops)

835
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:20,142
(Miho sighs)

836
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:23,520
(door opens)

837
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:31,987
(suspenseful music)

838
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:39,828
This is illegal detainment.
Undo the handcuffs.

839
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:41,496
Illegally tailing someone is okay?

840
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:45,792
I'll call the police then.

841
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:49,671
(phone clicks)

842
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:53,425
This will only complicate things.
Undo his handcuffs.

843
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:01,892
(keys jingling)

844
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:06,063
Did you tell him to follow me?

845
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:09,316
Saying that you had Professor Seo's paper
in a public place

846
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:10,650
was dangerous behavior.

847
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:14,905
I asked him to watch you
in case something bad happened to you.

848
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:16,156
(scoffs)

849
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:18,033
You want me to believe that?

850
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:22,120
Are you saying I had him tail you
with bad intentions?

851
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:23,747
Did you not?

852
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,709
(sighs)

853
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:34,341
MAYOR CHOI: Give this to your husband.

854
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:36,802
What is this?

855
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:38,804
MAYOR CHOI:
It's something Mr. Park asked for.

856
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:40,931
You can ask him for the specifics.

857
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:43,850
(solemn music)

858
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:51,399
(door opens)

859
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:57,531
(door closes)

860
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:02,494
(Miho sighs)

861
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,793
-What?
-Get out.

862
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:10,919
Okay.

863
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,008
(door opens)

864
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:19,386
(door closes)

865
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:21,304
Let me look at you.

866
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:25,600
Are you well?

867
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:29,146
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

868
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:35,861
Mayor Choi asked me to give this to you.

869
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:45,287
CHANGHO:
Lee Sangbong, Ko Hakki, Nam Yisoo,

870
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:47,122
Jung Mikyung, Kim Eunsae.

871
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:51,793
The druggies I'm grateful for
as they'll save me from death.

872
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:53,879
(tense music)

873
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:56,173
Miho, give me your phone.

874
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:02,804
(phone line ringing)

875
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:09,686
It's me, Park Changho.
Are you sure about this list?

876
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:11,771
I got it from the prosecution.

877
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:13,773
Why did you change your mind?

878
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,986
If you were really Big Mouse,

879
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:20,280
you wouldn't have asked me for my help.

880
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:26,536
Thank you. I won't forget this kindness.

881
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:32,792
(sighs)
It'll be okay now, Miho.

882
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:34,544
What is this?

883
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:39,716
I'll explain everything
once I take care of urgent matters.

884
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:40,842
But...

885
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:44,512
can we trust Mayor Choi?

886
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:46,681
If something happens, go to him.

887
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:49,476
He's the only person
who will be on our side.

888
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:53,146
(breathes deeply)

889
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,232
(ominous music)

890
00:53:55,315 --> 00:54:00,403
The list that Choi Doha has of people
who bought drugs from Big Mouse.

891
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:01,821
PROSECUTOR: It's not Big Mouse.

892
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:04,241
You wrote that list.

893
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:08,328
JIHOON:
Do you know why I made that fake list?

894
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:13,792
I wanted to see
where Choi Doha uses that list.

895
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,337
I'm kind of excited.

896
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:22,968
I feel like those names will come out
of Park Changho's mouth.

897
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:24,469
PROSECUTOR: No way.

898
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:27,138
Mayor Choi has nothing to gain
from helping Park Changho.

899
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:31,059
Guess who hired Park Changho
as the lawyer?

900
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:33,561
It's Choi Doha.

901
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:38,233
Park Changho called Mayor Choi
from the penitentiary.

902
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:42,570
What if Park Changho says the names
from that fake list?

903
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:49,744
I'll be killing two birds with one stone.

904
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:52,122
(laughs)

905
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:55,917
Both Park Changho and Choi Doha...

906
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:58,461
(laughing)

907
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:00,297
(chuckles)

908
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,506
PROSECUTOR: Have a drink.

909
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,510
Mr. Choi, you should join our club.

910
00:55:05,593 --> 00:55:08,346
I'm not on par with your level.

911
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,724
(sucks teeth, exhales)

912
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:11,850
(fingers snap)

913
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:16,354
During the next cabinet reshuffle,

914
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:20,108
the Secretary of Civil Affairs
will be promoted to Minister of Justice.

915
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:22,360
JIHOON: You know my relationship with him.

916
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:24,696
If he becomes Minister of Justice,

917
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:29,534
I can make you chief prosecutor.

918
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:33,788
With your qualifications

919
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:37,375
and my support,

920
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:40,253
why can't you join our club?

921
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:43,256
My glass is filled with gratitude
and grace from just hearing it.

922
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:45,216
(Jihoon laughs)

923
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,010
Amen.

924
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:50,764
(laughing)

925
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:53,892
CHAEBONG: Are you sure?

926
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:56,102
Thank you, Mr. Gong.

927
00:55:57,479 --> 00:56:00,357
Of course. I'll see you on the weekend.

928
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:05,570
Did Mayor Choi hand over
the list of drug users?

929
00:56:05,653 --> 00:56:08,698
Why else do you think Park Changho
is acting so proud?

930
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:12,702
Mayor Choi, that jerk.
How could he do that to us?

931
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:16,122
He is capable of doing that and more.

932
00:56:20,668 --> 00:56:23,963
PRISONER:
The CCTV caught him eating cyanide.

933
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:25,340
Then why isn't it suicide?

934
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:28,927
Listen, they said he had no reason to die.

935
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:32,639
He made a scene
asking to be let out of solitary.

936
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:36,393
Everyone who started the ruckus
is dead then?

937
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:37,936
Yes, pretty much.

938
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:41,398
What about that psychopath
who stabbed the fortune-telling guy?

939
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:44,776
Why would anyone kill a man on death row?
It'd be a waste of drugs.

940
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:50,073
By the way, did you guys hear that rumor?

941
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:51,741
What rumor?

942
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:55,495
Apparently, Big Mouse
uses some strange sorcery.

943
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:57,038
Strange sorcery?

944
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:59,874
Yes. He controlled their souls

945
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:02,752
and forced them to eat, swallow,

946
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:04,254
and take the cyanide.

947
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:06,089
Boss.

948
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:09,467
I'm sorry.

949
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:12,429
-My gosh, that mouth.
-PRISONER: Come on.

950
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:13,888
(clattering)

951
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:15,181
Darn it.

952
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:16,891
That really hurts.

953
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:23,398
Boss, do you want to make a bet?

954
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:26,192
What kind of bet?

955
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:28,278
(upbeat music)

956
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:55,263
(music continues)

957
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:17,535
(music stops)

958
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:21,039
(high-pitched tone)

959
00:58:21,122 --> 00:58:22,874
Transportation cards?

960
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:24,000
GUARD: Yes, sir.

961
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:27,337
They said 500 cards
with a limit of one million won came in.

962
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:28,880
Two hundred more are coming.

963
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:33,134
It's pretty big this time.
What's the event?

964
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:37,847
Between Big Mouse and the three VIPs,

965
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:40,725
who will win? Have you made a decision?

966
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:44,145
It'll be hard to get rid of the VIPs
within one month.

967
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:49,984
My gosh. Didn't you see Big Mouse
kill three people in a few days?

968
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:51,819
I bet two cards on Big Mouth.

969
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:54,614
I bet three cards on the VIPs.

970
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:58,034
-Three cards?
-They're VIPs. They get special treatment.

971
00:58:58,117 --> 00:59:00,912
There are only ten days left in the month.
It won't be easy.

972
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:02,497
(grunts)

973
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:04,791
-I'm only betting one card.
-On who?

974
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:08,419
On Big Mouse getting rid of the VIPs.

975
00:59:09,462 --> 00:59:10,838
CHAEBONG: Who will get rid of whom?

976
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:13,258
(prisoner grumbles)

977
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:18,805
Who's in charge of it?

978
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:22,141
-PRISONER 1: Hey, get in line.
-PRISONER 2: Get in line. Hey, mister.

979
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:24,143
-One line.
-PRISONER 3: One card for Big Mouse.

980
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:25,687
One card for Big Mouse.

981
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:28,106
Uncle Yangbong, one card for Big Mouse.

982
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:30,608
Spend more next time.

983
00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:33,027
Two cards for the VIPs.

984
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:36,239
Mapo Weasel, two cards for the VIPs.

985
00:59:36,322 --> 00:59:37,949
-PRISONER 4: Gosh.
-PRISONER 5: What the...

986
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:39,409
-Move.
-What is this?

987
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:41,494
(tense music)

988
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:43,204
Four cards on the VIPs.

989
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:46,708
You're betting 4 cards?
Inmate 5710 from Ward 2?

990
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:48,543
No, not me. My boss.

991
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:51,754
Right, the boss of the Chain Gang?

992
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:54,090
JERRY: Four cards for the VIPs. Here.

993
00:59:54,173 --> 00:59:56,759
PRISONER 6:
One hundred cards for the VIPs.

994
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,304
-One hundred cards for the VIPs?
-What?

995
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:00,805
-GUARD: Move!
-What's going on?

996
01:00:00,888 --> 01:00:02,181
Hold on. Wait.

997
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:03,850
JERRY: Hold on! Please!

998
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:06,060
Hold on!

999
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:07,604
-(Jerry screaming)
-(thudding)

1000
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:09,731
GUARD: Come on. Step on him!

1001
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:12,400
JERRY: Wait. Hold on!

1002
01:00:12,483 --> 01:00:14,485
(ominous music)

1003
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:27,248
-(thuds)
-(music stops)

1004
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:33,254
(suspenseful music)

1005
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:35,965
JERRY: I'm sorry, Boss.

1006
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:38,301
I tried to run a business using your name.

1007
01:00:41,512 --> 01:00:43,973
They're saying you're getting rid of us
within the month.

1008
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:46,684
So? Who's winning?

1009
01:00:49,562 --> 01:00:51,022
With the current score

1010
01:00:51,939 --> 01:00:53,941
of six to four,

1011
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:56,152
the VIPs...

1012
01:00:56,235 --> 01:00:58,112
Everyone here knows

1013
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:00,156
that you're fake.

1014
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:03,159
Get up.

1015
01:01:08,956 --> 01:01:10,667
Tell this to everyone who chose Big Mouse.

1016
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:12,919
They'll win big time.

1017
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:14,170
PRISONER: Yes!

1018
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:17,382
(prisoners murmuring)

1019
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:18,800
What a funny guy.

1020
01:01:18,883 --> 01:01:20,134
(Dr. Han mutters)

1021
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:21,719
WARDEN PARK: Take them out.

1022
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:23,096
GUARD: Everyone out.

1023
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:24,972
-Everyone out.
-Everyone out. Go on.

1024
01:01:25,598 --> 01:01:27,558
-GUARD 1: Get out.
-GUARD 2: Hurry up and get out.

1025
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:28,935
GUARD 3: Hurry up.

1026
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:31,020
(suspenseful music)

1027
01:01:36,901 --> 01:01:38,403
Aren't you meeting Mr. Gong tomorrow?

1028
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:41,864
You dug your own grave.

1029
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:45,785
Once word gets out that you're fake,
your followers will get back at you.

1030
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:54,085
You must be sure
that I don't know the drug clients.

1031
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:57,880
Should we gamble too?
I bet 100 million that you don't know it.

1032
01:01:57,964 --> 01:01:59,006
(scoffs)

1033
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:01,217
Are you kidding?
I bet 300 million that I know it.

1034
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:04,762
Deal. We should make this happen.

1035
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:07,432
(laughs)
Hey. Tell everyone in the penitentiary.

1036
01:02:08,015 --> 01:02:09,058
What?

1037
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:11,978
JERRY: Okay.

1038
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:13,104
Be the dealer, Warden Park.

1039
01:02:14,939 --> 01:02:16,774
The payout will be 300 million.

1040
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:18,735
With a 10% commission, of course.

1041
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:19,986
Geez.

1042
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:23,573
(suspenseful music fades)

1043
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:29,871
In order to repay you,
we got a surprising piece.

1044
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:32,331
Do you know this piece?

1045
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:33,833
WOMAN: Do you recognize it?

1046
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:36,210
WOOJEONG GALLERY

1047
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:45,386
(footsteps approaching)

1048
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:57,565
I'm going to see Park Changho.
Do you want to come?

1049
01:02:58,232 --> 01:03:01,027
He agreed to tell me the list
of people who bought drugs.

1050
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:03,404
The one that Big Mouse made.

1051
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:08,326
I'm not interested.

1052
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:11,579
Park Changho and Mr. Jung

1053
01:03:12,538 --> 01:03:16,793
made a 300-million-won bet with that list.

1054
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,420
(Jihoon sucks teeth)

1055
01:03:19,504 --> 01:03:24,091
It seems like that punk
has something he can fall back on.

1056
01:03:25,593 --> 01:03:28,471
If he's really Big Mouse,
he'll give you the list.

1057
01:03:29,722 --> 01:03:32,141
If he's not, he won't say anything.

1058
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:34,977
Probably.

1059
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:36,771
JIHOON: But...

1060
01:03:37,396 --> 01:03:41,400
I'm worried he might say the wrong names.

1061
01:03:42,276 --> 01:03:44,403
The list that you have...

1062
01:03:45,279 --> 01:03:46,989
is fake.

1063
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:51,577
I just wrote a bunch of random names down.

1064
01:03:54,038 --> 01:03:55,206
What do you think?

1065
01:03:56,457 --> 01:03:58,042
Are you interested in it now?

1066
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:01,128
I really hope

1067
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:04,757
he doesn't mention the names I wrote.

1068
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:06,843
(suspenseful music)

1069
01:04:08,052 --> 01:04:09,053
Right?

1070
01:04:12,932 --> 01:04:14,934

01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:17,186

Don't say a word to Miho.
