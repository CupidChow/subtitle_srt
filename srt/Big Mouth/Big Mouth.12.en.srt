THIS SHOW IS A WORK OF FICTION

00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:48,965
THE EVENTS AND ENTITIES
THAT APPEAR HEREIN ARE FICTIONAL

KO MIHO

MAYOR CHOI: Listen very carefully.

11
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,859
Park Changho joined forces with Big Mouse.

12
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,320
I think we were fooled.

13
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,574
Park Changho, Ko Miho...

14
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,786
Get rid of both of them tonight.

15
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,414
Get some guys you trust to start a riot.

16
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,166
It'll be easier to do then.

17
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:25,293
(gun clicking)

18
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:28,755
The riot must only be in Ward Two.
Close all paths to the medical room.

19
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,507
And find Park Changho.

20
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,717
(inmates clamoring)

21
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:36,054
SOOCHUL: Then get rid of our guys.

22
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,516
The rioters killed Ko Miho
and it was self-defense on your part.

23
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:43,770
DANGER: HIGH VOLTAGE

MIHO: The power went out and caused
a problem with the plasmapheresis.

43
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,115
I'm going to be late. What should we do?

44
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:23,494
I CAN'T TALK ON THE PHONE RIGHT NOW.

45

LET'S MEET TOMORROW.
I'LL CALL YOU IN THE MORNING.

I've made myself clear.

70
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,306
If you're lying to me again...

71
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,141
ROOM LEADER: Number one, the Magician.

72
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:11,352
Reversed.

73
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:17,817
I thought Warden Park could handle you,

74
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,237
but when I saw him get totally fooled
with that tarot card,

75
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,572
I came to a conclusion.

76
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,200
The only person
who can go up against you...

77
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,495
was me.

78
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:31,831
(room leader sighs)

79
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:35,376
We only have time for this one drink.

80
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,171
(drink pouring)

81
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:43,343
You won't get another chance
to sit across from me again.

82
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,636
(ominous music)

83
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,223

(exhales)

86
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,562
Why did you have to choose me?

87
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,025
Since when?

88
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,527
Where did it all start?

89
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,905
MAYOR CHOI: I'll get to the point.

90
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,408
Have you heard
of the Gucheon University Hospital murder?

91
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:11,079
Your initial involvement with Choi Doha
had nothing to do with me.

92
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:14,040
But then you invoked their wrath.

93
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,834
Just say that you'll withdraw your paper!

94
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,628
CHAEBONG: Withdraw it, you bastard!

95
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:23,716
ROOM LEADER: You were destined
to die in their hands from that moment.

96
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,095
But someone said that you had to be saved.

97
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,474
The way we chose to save you...

98
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,645
was to turn you into Big Mouse.

99
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,730
(ominous music)

100
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:45,446
At first, I was planning to use you
as my shadow and get rid of you.

101
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,532
But gradually,

102
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,494
the tables started to turn in your favor,

103
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:55,832
and you ended up
dragging me out by the collar.

104
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,258
(sips)

105
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,347
Why are you so obsessed
with Seo Jaeyoung's paper?

106
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:17,228
I need to find the people
who killed my daughter.

107
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,400
I need to find them
and make sure they know

108
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,944
who they dared to mess with.

109
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,238
You only made things harder.

110
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:29,323
If you collected evidence
and let the law take care...

111
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,159
-What?
-(glass shatters)

112
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,535
The law?

113
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,875
Flowers may look beautiful from afar.

114
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,418
But when you get close,

115
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:43,171
they are growing on the edge of a cliff.

116
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:47,592
The moment you grab onto that flower
attempting to survive,

117
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:52,346
you'll fall off the cliff to your death.

118
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:58,227
A vicious flower planted
by those in power.

119
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,146
That's what the law is.

120
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,274
(ominous music)

121
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:04,567
(room leader sobs)

122
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:09,322
The fear and despair
my daughter must've felt...

123
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:15,161
I'm going to return it to them
a thousandfold.

124
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,372
Turning the world they created

125
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,667
into a complete hell

126
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,253
is law and justice...

127
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,257
to me.

128
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,928
(tense music)

129
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,472
Promise me...

130
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,769
you'll let me go if I uncover
the secret behind the paper.

131
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,979
You will take part in it until the end.

132
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,316
Until I destroy all of them.

133
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,694
Why is it me? You have plenty of minions!

134
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:52,156
I can't beat those guys from the shadows!

135
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,537
It needs to be someone
in the same class as them.

136
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,749
I can make that happen for you,

137
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,919
but I can't get there myself.

138
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:11,342
If I refuse?

139
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,720
The world that I created...

140
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,599
is bigger and stronger than you'd think.

141
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,936
The moment you give up...

142
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,943
you'll be dead.

143
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,657
(sobs)

144
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,409
(scoffs)

145
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:42,748
(laughing)

146
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:50,631
(laughing continues)

147
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:01,976
(inhales deeply, exhales sharply)

148
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,190
(music intensifies)

149
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,656
(music stops)

150
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,327
Let me make an offer as well.

151
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,621
(suspenseful music)

152
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,665
SOOCHUL: Did you find Park Changho?

153
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:25,916
(door creaks open)

154
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,670
-GUARD: We're looking for him.
-SOOCHUL: Hurry up and find him!

155
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,339
We're doing this to get rid of him.

156
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:34,550
SOOCHUL:
How long will the generators last?

157
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,177
GUARD: They won't even last an hour.

158
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,387
GUARD (over radio):
It's hard to suppress the rioters.

159
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,264
We'll need police backup.

160
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,811
Make sure to resolve it internally,
so nobody outside finds out.

161
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:49,899
(Soochul sighs)

162
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,317
I told you to cause some smoke,

163
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,611
but you caused a wildfire.

164
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,863
Don't worry about that.

165
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:58,532
We locked down all of Ward Two,
so he won't be able to get out.

166
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,787
Are our men ready?

167
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:04,580
Yes, sir.

168
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,877
We don't have time,
so get rid of Ko Miho first.

169
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,962
(ominous music)

170
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:17,301
(tense music)

171
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,477
(distorted eerie music)

172
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,188

(suspenseful music)

177
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,918
Are you refusing?

178
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,130
(scoffs)

179
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,506
I'm just in awe...

180
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,176
because I'm so surprised.

181
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:04,724
(phone vibrating)

182
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,611
(phone beeps)

183
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:21,073
Go to the medical room.

184
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,160
Your wife is in danger.

185
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,997

(alarm blaring in distance)

188
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:48,142
What's going on?

189
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,810
MIHO: We're looking into it.

190
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,937
It's probably no big deal, so don't worry.

191
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,648
(phone vibrating)

192
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:56,776
Hello?

193
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:59,445
You're in danger, Miho.
Get out of there right now.

194
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,530
(tense music)

195
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,365
Excuse me.

196
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,708
(clanging)

197
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,420
(grunting)

198
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,935
(tense music)

199
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:50,162
(door rattling)

200
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,421
All of the exits are blocked.

201
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,881
(Changho exhales)

202
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,759
Hide in the medical room.
I'll be right there.

203
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,261
(door luck buzzes)

204
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,097
(panting)

205
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,309
GUARD: We found No. 5247.

206
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,394
(exhales)

207
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:17,439
I'll be there soon, Miho.

209
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:27,449

(tense music)

211
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,334
Get off!

212
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,919
(clamoring)

213
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:42,339

(tense music)

219
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,726
Go! Hurry up and go!

220
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,607
Get over here. Come on!

221
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:46,320

(door lock buzzes)

223
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,541
Then get rid of our guys.

224
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:04,004
The rioters killed Ko Miho
and it was self-defense on your part.

225
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:07,424
SOOCHUL: I've turned off the cameras,
so don't worry.

you can get to the medical room.

-(blood dripping)

280

-(gun clicks)
-(Miho whimpers)

292

If you go first and wait,

00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,738
your husband will soon follow.

CHANGHO: You bastard.

301
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,466
How dare you lay a hand on Miho?

302

(grunting)

303
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,264
How dare you?

304
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:50,434
That's enough, Changho! Stop.

305
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:59,151

CHANGHO: Miho. Are you okay?

310
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:15,834
Are you hurt?

311
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:17,961
I'm okay. I am.

312
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:20,589
(breathing heavily)

313
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,717
Thank goodness.

314
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,428
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

315
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,013
I'm sorry.

316
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:32,392

(ominous music)

323
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,589
BIG MOUTH

324
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:50,929
PROSECUTOR: Everyone gathered here

325
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,890
is powerful in their own respect.

326
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:57,018
Who is that old man
for everyone to be groveling at his feet?

327
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,687
You don't know Chairman Kang?

328
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,690
(scoffs)
Makes sense.

329
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:04,860
He never makes an appearance
at events like these.

330
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:08,071
CHAEBONG: Woojeong Daily,
OC Group, Chilbong Foundation...

331
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:11,491
He has shares in every large firm
in Gucheon.

332
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:12,826
He's a major shareholder too.

333
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,953
The person who made Gucheon
what it is now?

334
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:16,997
I've heard about him before.

335
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,292
Just think of him
as the president for life in this area.

336
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,169
SEUNGTAE: I have an announcement.

337
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:25,922
We will now start the charity auction

338
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:29,176
to oppose the special bill!

339
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:31,303
(applause and cheers)

340
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:33,388
(upbeat music playing)

341
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:36,766
Woojeong Daily was the first
to release an exclusive

342
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,019
on the drug scandal.

343
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:42,814
I should've stopped the article
from getting out...

344
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,191
(inhales sharply, exhales)

345
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:47,027
...but I couldn't stop it in time.

346
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:52,532
ELDER: If you used Juhee as a scapegoat,
you must have a reason.

347
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,826
Was it your plan to stop
Doha from getting Big Mouse?

348
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,412
No, sir. Why would I...

349
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,915
ELDER:
I don't believe you are that foolish.

350
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,459
Explain it so I can understand.

351
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:04,377
What's the big picture you have in mind?

352
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:06,838
Well...

353
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:10,926
If you give me some time,
I'll show you with my results.

354
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:14,387
(footsteps approaching)

355
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,893
(tense music)

356
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,103
Can you catch Big Mouse?

357
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,733
ELDER: I'll protect Juhee from now on.

358
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:29,194
Don't worry about Big Mouse retaliating.

359
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:30,612
I'll make sure to catch him.

360
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:34,366
So? You'll show me your results?

361
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:36,660
Yes, sir. Please keep an eye on me.

362
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:40,664
If I don't like those results,
you'll have to give up control

363
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,791
of the company to someone else.

364
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,002
Mr. Chairman, but...

365
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,796
I have a favor to ask.

366
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:50,131
Okay. What is it?

367
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:53,051
I heard Professor Seo's position
as commissioner of the audit committee

368
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:55,387
-was still open.
-ELDER: Yes.

369
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,264
I'll do it.

370
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:59,349
(suspenseful music)

371
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:03,311
Do you know what kind of position that is?

372
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:06,106
Yes, sir. I know it very well.

373
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,861
(laughs)

374
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,531
Then do that.

375
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:16,783
Thank you, sir.

376
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:18,910
No. I should be thanking you.

377
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:21,705
You are finally showing interest
in my business.

378
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,957
(elder laughs)

379
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:26,543
-Let's go.
-ASSOCIATE: Yes, sir.

380
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:42,517
(ominous music)

381
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,687
What are you up to?

382
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:49,441
Why do you want to become
commissioner of the audit committee?

383
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:50,817
After what happened,

384
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,695
I realized I shouldn't stay silent

385
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:56,114
to the dirty things you guys do.

386
00:26:58,366 --> 00:26:59,367
(inhales sharply)

387
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:03,663
Is trying to shake up
my control over the company

388
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,915
your idea too, Hyun Juhee?

389
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:12,213
Don't you dare lay a hand on my company.

390
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:16,384
I'll use every method I can...

391
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:21,348
to make you pay properly--

392
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:22,641
(Jihoon groans)

393
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,022
You bastard.

394
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:30,815
Apologize to Juhee first, jerk.

395
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:32,734
Doha.

396
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:36,863
That's enough, honey.

397
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,325
(Jihoon grunts)

398
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:43,787
-(exhales)
-(breathing heavily)

399
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:46,790
(exhales)

400
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,459
(breathes heavily)

401
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:52,629
You shouldn't have dragged me
into it from the start.

402
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:56,466
Your glory days are all over.

403
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,052
(ominous music)

404
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:03,056
(breathing heavily)

405
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:12,399
Choi Doha.

406
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:15,276
Choi Doha!

407
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:16,820
(grunts)

408
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:29,666
(line dialing)

409
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:40,301
(phone vibrating)

410
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:46,641
(music intensifies)

411
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:52,605
Go outside.

412
00:28:58,528 --> 00:28:59,404
MEDICAL ROOM

413
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:08,830
(gunshot)

414
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,293
(door closes)

415
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,092
We're surrounded by armed forces.

416
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,761
GUARD: You are surrounded.

417
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:25,680
Get rid of your guns
and surrender immediately!

418
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,640
If you resist, we'll shoot to kill!

419
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,225
Get rid of your guns and surrender!

420
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,686
(alarm blaring in distance)

421
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:34,647
Shouldn't we surrender?

422
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:36,107
Do you think they'll kill us?

423
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,358
There's no guarantee we live.

424
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:40,403
Their goal was to kill you from the start.

425
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,948
(sighs)
All we can do is notify outside.

426
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:48,119
The offer...

427
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:50,955
you made earlier.

428
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,501
I'll accept.

429
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:56,711
In return,

430
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,048
you must keep your promise too.

431
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,926
(tense music)

432
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:11,184
I need time. Stall for as long as you can.

433
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:18,066
(line ringing)

434
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:20,860
-Have you lost your mind?
-(feet stomping)

435
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:23,613
ASHLEY KIM: Do you know
how much this costs? Seriously.

436
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,281
(gasps)

437
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,909
-(shatters)
-(Ashley Kim squeals)

438
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,245
-What's wrong with you?
-(Jihoon screams angrily)

439
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,496
(shatters)

440
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,456
-(grunts)
-(Ashley Kim squeals)

441
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,959
The auction didn't even go
as well as I wanted!

442
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:38,378
(phone vibrating)

443
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,005
(exhales)
Who is this?

444
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,340
It's me, Park Changho.

445
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:44,551
I want to give you a present.

446
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:46,970
What kind of present?

447
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,723
I don't have time, so I'll keep it short.

448
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:56,771
(tense music)

449
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:03,152
(laughing)

450
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:05,238
Hey!

451
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:08,324
I love you, Park Changho!

452
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:09,534
(Jihoon laughs)

453
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:13,204
-Damn it! Choi Doha!
-(feet stomping on broken glass)

454
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,623
You're dead!

455
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,750
(laughs maniacally)

456
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:20,169
-What a lunatic.
-JIHOON: Amazing!

00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:27,302
(line ringing)

460
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:30,263
OPERATOR: The call cannot be connected...

461
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,975
-Turn the car around.
-Pardon?

462
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,310
Go to the penitentiary.

463
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,063
(gunshot)

464
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,816
I'm holding Park Changho
and Ko Miho hostage!

465
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,695
If anyone comes in,
I'm going to kill the hostages!

466
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:48,531
They're all in it together.
We must kill them.

467
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:50,408
Do you have evidence?

468
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:52,827
Well, that's...

469
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:53,912
Warden Gan and I...

470
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,997
Who'll be responsible if they're hostages?

471
00:31:57,248 --> 00:32:00,501
If you ignore me now,
you'll be reprimanded.

472

What are you doing here?

478
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,245
What about you?

479
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,083
He's lucky.
(laughs)

480
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,753
Something huge will happen today.

481
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:47,006
(phone vibrating)

482
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,886
Yes. I just got here.

PROSECUTOR: This is the main gate.

The prosecution's
investigation team is here.

489
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:51,320
I'm Prosecutor Choi
from Gucheon Prosecutors' Office.

490
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:54,157
Didn't you hear
from Correctional Services?

491
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,951
We received a report
and came to arrest Big Mouse.

492
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,371
The person who reported it
will bring Big Mouse out.

CHANGHO: Let me make an offer as well.

497
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,868
I can't forgive you.

498
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:42,455
I don't intend on forgiving myself either.

499
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,917
I will pay for my crimes eventually.

500
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,087
No. I would like you to pay
right now by my hand.

501
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:51,839
You...

502
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:54,675
want to catch and lock me up?

503
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,302
You said so yourself.

504
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,222
I can only beat them
if we're in the same class.

505
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:03,768
Big Mouse's power? That's meaningless now.

506
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,853
I need to step over Big Mouse
and go above that

507
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:08,064
to get close to their hearts.

508
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:10,650
You wanted me to do my part in this.

509
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,570
I'll be able to let go
of my grudge against you

510
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:16,072
and end them too.

511
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:18,157
(dramatic music)

512
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:21,410
I'm going to live.

513
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,622
You're going to live?

514
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:33,089
(laughing)

515
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,181
(gulping)

516
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:49,647
Are you refusing?

517
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,527
I'm just in awe...

518
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,864
because I'm so surprised.

519
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,493
(music swells)

520
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,014
(dramatic music continues)

521
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,754
(music fades)

522
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:07,642
JIHOON (sighs):
Goodness. So this is what you look like?

523
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:13,648
I really wanted to meet you, Big Mouse.

524
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,441
(lips squeaking)

525
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,069
(ominous music)

526
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:21,656
Take him away.

527
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,420
PROSECUTOR: Hold on.

528
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:38,756
(Jihoon clapping)

529
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:39,966
Good job.

530
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,510
JIHOON: Amazing.

531
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,470
You're really incredible.

532
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:49,392
I've decided to become an avid fan
of Park Changho as of today.

533
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,769
(screeching)

534
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:54,897
You're so chic.

535
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,357
(Jihoon laughs)

536
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,527
But isn't there something else
you have to give me?

537
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:04,198
(suspenseful music)

538
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:15,167
This is the blood I got
from the model inmates.

539
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,878
I used this as bait to catch Big Mouse.

540
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,262
(music intensifies)

541
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:40,818
It seems like Mayor Choi
desperately wanted this.

542
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,070
But Mr. Gong is taking it all.

543
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:46,574
What do you think? Do you like it?

544
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:53,456
(scoffs)

545
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:11,223
JUDGE: Case number 2022-340929.

546
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:14,268
The prosecutor has decided
to drop charges,

547
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,437
so I declare this a mistrial.

548
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:18,856
(gavel banging on table)

549
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:20,941
(tense music)

550
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,070
REPORTER 1: It's Attorney Park Changho!

551
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:25,988
ASSOCIATE: Step aside.

552
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,656
REPORTER 2: Was Big Mouse involved
in the Seo Jaeyoung case?

553
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,742
-What can you tell us about your case?
-REPORTER 3: Say a word.

554
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:31,619
-REPORTER 4: Will you file a suit?
-ASSOCIATE: Move aside.

555
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:34,205
REPORTER 5:
How do you feel about catching Big Mouse?

556
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:37,083
CHANGHO:
Starting today, my life will change.

557
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,044
I caught Big Mouse,
the king of the underworld,

558
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,588
and proved my innocence.

559
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:46,884
I've become Korea's most competent
and righteous lawyer.

560
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:51,055
ATTORNEY AT LAW, PARK CHANGHO

561
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,312
(music stops)

562
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,022
KIKWANG: Hey, Park Changho!

563
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:02,525
-(confetti pops)
-Hey! Come in!

564
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:03,734
(Kikwang laughs)

565
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:04,819
MIHO: Congratulations.

566
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,571
Welcome, Changho. Have some cake.

567
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,115
(Changho groans)

568
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:10,324
Oh, my.

569
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:12,576
(Kikwang chuckles)

570
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,746
This cake is really made with tofu.

571
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:18,124
CHANGHO: You prepared so much.

572
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:20,251
What do you think?
Do you like your new office?

573
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:21,335
(Changho chuckles)

574
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,337
Isn't this place too nice for us?

575
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,214
I'm sure rent is expensive.

576
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:27,216
SOONTAE:
Hey, rent isn't an issue right now.

577
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:29,093
You're the most trending name right now.

578
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:32,638
KIKWANG: We've already gotten
a ton of calls from potential clients.

579
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:35,433
We need to hire employees first thing.

580
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:38,519
So what are you going to do?
Will you do what Big Mouse proposed?

581
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:42,398
I have to. I made a promise.

582
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:46,444
Let's make a toast.
You've been through a lot, Changho.

583
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,362
-Good job, everyone.
-SOONTAE: Good job!

584
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:51,782
Thanks for everything, Miho.
I'll handle things now.

585
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:54,827
What? You want me to back down now?

586
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:59,623
MIHO: Then what about the blood samples?

587
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,417
Do you have anyone else to handle it?

588
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,502
(ominous music)

589
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:05,171
(sighs)

590
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:29,862
If we're faking it,
do you still need this much blood?

591
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:33,199
MIHO: This is the blood I got
from the model inmates.

592
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:38,078
I used this as bait to catch Big Mouse.

593
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,335
And we have a problem.

594
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:48,088
Jang Hyejin is missing.

595
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:49,965
Missing?

596
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,219
MIHO: Hyejin.

597
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:58,057
MIHO: I haven't been able to reach her.
Her cell phone's off, too.

598
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:00,726
Neither are there records of her
leaving the country.

599
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:04,939
KIKWANG:
Do you think she changed her mind?

600
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:06,690
Or...

601
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:08,484
Or what?

602
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:12,279
Never mind. There's no way.

603
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,365
(music intensifies)

604
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:20,120
MAY YOU REST IN PEACE

605
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:24,833
(ominous music)

606
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:32,925
(people murmuring)

607
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:34,927
CHANGHO: The public's interest?

608
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:36,720
It's a kettle.

609
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,098
It'll cool off
as fast as it comes to a boil.

610
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:43,185
We need to keep it boiling
or add gas to the flames.

611
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:45,938
The real fight starts now.

612
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:50,317
I need to get famous to get applauded
for even the smallest feats.

613
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:53,362
PROSECUTOR:
"Park Changho." "Attorney Park Changho."

614
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:55,573
"Attorney Park Changho's return."

615
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,491
"Location of Attorney
Park Changho's office."

616
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:01,704
It's not a keyword
if Park Changho's name isn't on it.

617
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:05,332
PROSECUTOR: Big Mouse is on the list, too.
It's at number seven.

618
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:06,542
(chuckles)

619
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,920
(upbeat music)

620
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:13,424
PROSECUTOR: What are you doing in here?

621
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:17,678
This isn't the town community center
where anyone can waltz right in.

622
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:22,308
Is there a problem with an attorney
coming to meet his client?

623
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:23,434
Client?

624
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:26,145
You're representing Big Mouse?

625
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,773
(music continues)

626
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:40,200
I would like a different room.

627
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,664
One without any cameras.

628
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:47,750
(suspenseful music)

629
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,156
REPRESENTATION AGREEMENT

630
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,369
Sign the contract.

631
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:25,204
What are you doing?

632
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:27,498
You told me to raise my class
and fight in the light.

633
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:30,417
I need an official reason.

634
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,712
You just became famous.
Do you want to be criticized?

635
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:35,506
You can use notoriety in various ways.

636
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:37,049
It's up to me to handle it.

637
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,428
ROOM LEADER: Your retainer isn't on here.

638
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:42,763
I'll fill that in.

639
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:45,766
You want a blank check?

640
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:49,186
You're the great Big Mouse.

641
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:51,897
You should hire
the most expensive attorney in Korea.

642
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:53,691
(scoffs)

643
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,487
CLIENT NAME: NO PARK

644
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:01,407
You plead the fifth. Right?

645
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,577
Admit to all your charges from now on.

646
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:07,454
And after that?

647
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,164
I'm going to apply for bail.

648
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:10,874
Prepare enough money for bail.

649
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,836
(line ringing)

650
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:16,171
He signed the contract.
Set up a press conference.

651
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:19,174
(sighs)

652
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:27,141
You're relentless.

653
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:31,061
MAYOR CHOI: Overdoing something
always brings about a disaster.

654
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:34,398
Nobody is as relentless as you.

655
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:37,025
A mayor in office committed murder.

656
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:40,529
An attorney should watch what he says.

657
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:43,741
Sharp words will only come back
to stab you.

658
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:46,744
You're the one who ordered
Warden Gan to kill me. Right?

659
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:48,996
Go to his grave and ask.

660
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:51,331
Don't say a word
if you don't have evidence.

661
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:52,416
(scoffs)

662
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:57,379
There are various types
of Big Mouses in this world.

663
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,548
CHANGHO: You're one of them.

664
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:02,092
You're more evil than my client.

665
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:07,181
Do you remember why you hired me
as the attorney for Seo Jaeyoung's case?

666
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:10,476
MAYOR CHOI: I'll be honest.

667
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:13,562
When they asked me
to choose a lawyer for them,

668
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:15,606
they had some conditions.

669
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:18,609
The lawyer must be incompetent
and obedient.

670
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:20,819
CHANGHO: That was your first mistake.

671
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:23,989
Let's see this through.

672
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:27,117
Let's see how David kills Goliath.

673
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:31,371
(tense music)

674
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:41,715
(music stops)

675
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:48,180
(inhales sharply, exhales)

676
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:49,640
(door opens)

677
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,520
He said you can come in now.

678
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:56,104
(clears throat)

679
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:58,982
(camera shutters clicking)

680
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:01,985
(reporters murmuring)

681
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:06,240
BIG MOUSE'S LEGAL COUNSEL,
PARK CHANGHO'S PRESS CONFERENCE

682
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,786
(suspenseful music)

683
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:15,916
(camera shutters clicking)

684
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:21,463
SOONTAE: We'd like to thank
all the reporters who came here today.

685
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:24,758
As we have told you in advance,
we will receive questions first.

686
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:27,302
SOONTAE: Then Attorney Park Changho
will make an announcement.

687
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:28,762
Please ask your questions.

688
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:31,139
(tense music)

689
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:34,017
Is it true that you will be representing
Big Mouse?

690
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:36,395
Yes, it is.

691
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:39,064
I don't think
it's appropriate for the person

692
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:41,024
who caught Big Mouse to represent him.

693
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:43,443
The prosecution's investigation
is currently at a standstill.

694
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:45,320
As long as I'm his legal representative,

695
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:48,448
Big Mouse will soon admit
to all his charges.

696
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:51,243
REPORTER:
As a lawyer who must protect his client,

697
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:52,786
isn't this a violation of your duty?

698
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:56,123
It's not the duty of a lawyer
to cover up a crime.

699
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:58,876
I will clearly break down the truth
behind this case

700
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,502
so that the defendant

701
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:03,005
can receive a proper verdict.

702
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:10,596
This is the bait that Park Changho
used to catch Big Mouse.

703
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:12,764
(inhales sharply)

704
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:14,349
Is this...

705
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:18,312
This is the blood of the model inmates
used in the project.

706
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:21,315
If this was released to the public,

707
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:24,026
it would've caused a problem even bigger

708
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:26,737
than Seo Jaeyoung's paper ever would have.

709
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:28,447
(elder sighs)

710
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:30,574
Why would Big Mouse...

711
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:37,581
His name is No Park.

712
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:46,423
Did you ever make any enemies
in connection to your business?

713
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:49,635
When a big wagon goes a far distance,

714
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,763
there are many bugs that die
under its wheels.

715
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:54,514
JIHOON: You're right.

716
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:57,476
In any case, I'm glad he was caught.

717
00:48:57,559 --> 00:48:59,311
All we need to do is get our money back...

718
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:03,065
I'm satisfied with the results,
so I'm giving you a reward.

719
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:09,404
DONATION OF SHARES AGREEMENT

720
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:11,198
ELDER: It's an agreement
to donate my shares to you.

721
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:15,535
You won't have to worry
about control of the company.

722
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:22,626
Thank you! Thank you so much, sir!

723
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:25,796
ELDER: Put your fingerprint on it.

724
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:27,381
Yes, sir.

725
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,384
-Thank you.
-(knocks on door)

726
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,719
JUHEE: Sir. It's me, Juhee.

727
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,179
ELDER: Right. Come in.

728
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,098
(door opens)

729
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,646
I think you should watch the news.

730
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:47,734
(remote clicks)

731
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,820
CHANGHO: The reason I'm holding
this press conference

732
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:52,447
is because I received
another request from Big Mouse.

733
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:53,532
REPORTER 1: What is that?

734
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:57,911
To uncover the truth
behind Seo Jaeyoung's murder.

735
00:49:58,453 --> 00:50:00,789
(suspenseful music)

736
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:03,500
CHANGHO: The defendants,
who are currently awaiting an appeal,

737
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:06,962
Jung Chaebong, Lee Doogeun, and Han Jaeho,
are nothing more than tails in this case.

738
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:09,923
There is a body, and above them,
there's a boss...

739
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:11,675
(camera shutters clicking)

740
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:13,010
...who is the head.

741
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:16,013
REPORTER 2: And who is that boss?

742
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:20,142
I can only tell you that it is someone
who is a very important figure.

743
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:23,437
REPORTER 3:
Why is Big Mouse interested in this case?

744
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:27,190
This is all I will say for today.

745
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,818
REPORTER 4:
Will you look into Seo Jaeyoung's case?

746
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:31,778
(camera shutters clicking)

747
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:35,198
The only weapon I hold

748
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:38,326
is the continued interest of the people.

749
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:41,329
Please,
stay interested in the matter further.

750
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:44,416
ATTORNEY PARK CHANGHO
TAKES ON SEO JAEYOUNG CASE

751
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:46,668
SOONTAE: This will be the end
of the press conference.

752
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:47,753
Thank you.

753
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:50,005
DONATION OF SHARES AGREEMENT

754
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:51,757
(remote clicks)

755
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,924
(remote clanks)

756
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:57,763
-REPORTER: Who is the head?
-SOONTAE: Hey.

757
00:50:57,846 --> 00:50:59,806
Aren't you provoking them too much?

758
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:02,768
If it hurts, they'll react.
If they react, we'll see it.

759
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:04,895
You said it was Chairman Kang. Right?

760
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:07,898
Jang Hyejin told Miho.

761
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:09,649
He's the head.

762
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:12,861
-REPORTER 1: Who is it?
-REPORTER 2: Reveal who it is!

763
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:14,071
(reporters clamoring)

764
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:18,116
Don't worry about it too much, sir.

765
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:22,245
With Big Mouse arrested,
that mere lawyer can't...

766
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:24,706
The Joint Investigation Bureau
couldn't catch Big Mouse,

767
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:26,583
but he managed to without any ties.

768
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:28,960
ELDER: We can't underestimate him.

769
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:31,588
He might be worse than Big Mouse.

770
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:34,216
(phone vibrating)

771
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:36,593
Yes, Doha.

772
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,262
JUHEE: Should I put him on?

773
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:42,265
Tell him this.

774
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:44,893
I got a tip that Park Changho's
applying for Big Mouse's bail.

775
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:47,687
(phone beeps)

776
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:56,613
Park Changho's applying

777
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,406
for Big Mouse's bail.

778
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:02,327
(suspenseful music)

779
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:07,916
He dares to fight against me head-to-head?

780
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:12,129
I'll take care of it, sir. Don't worry.

781
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:13,713
First,

782
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:16,883
can you put your stamp on this?

783
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:20,554
(music continues)

784
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:26,560
You didn't finish the job.

785
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:28,645
Come back after you've finished it.

786
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:34,734
(music intensifies)

787
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:44,661
(music stops)

788
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:48,623
MIHO: It's been a while, Dr. Han.

789
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:51,126
(suspenseful music)

790
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:54,504
Why are you so surprised?

791
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:56,840
When did you see Ms. Jang Hyejin?

792
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:00,051
What are you talking about?

793
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:04,014
Why would I see her?

794
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:06,933
She's missing.

795
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,310
I don't know anything about it.

796
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:11,146
So stop bothering me.

797
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:13,148
-(car alarm beeps)
-I heard from hospital employees

798
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:15,567
that after your divorce,
you looked for Hyejin.

799
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:20,697
You don't seem concerned
that she's gone missing.

800
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,782
(tense music)

801
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:31,333
(engine starts, revs)

802
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:35,378
(tires screech)

803
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:37,797
(engine revving)

804
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:40,383
(tires screeching)

805
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:52,020
(phone vibrating)

806
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:55,273
Hey, Miho. Did you meet Han Jaeho?

807
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:57,442
I think you're right.

808
00:53:57,525 --> 00:53:59,402
Something happened to Hyejin.

809
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:02,280
KIKWANG: I'll file a missing
person report with the police.

810
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:06,201
Last time, when you were following
the model inmates,

811
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:07,994
you lost them around Mount Haryong, right?

812
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:09,746
Why are you asking?

813
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:12,749
The model inmates are going out
to work today. I'm going to go there.

814
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:14,668
Hey. Why are you going there?

815
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:16,795
KIKWANG: We'll go, so don't go there.

816
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:21,091
They probably already left the prison.
I'll head over there first.

817
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:23,176
(tense music)

818
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:25,178
KIKWANG: Hey, Miho. Mi...

819
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,724
-My goodness. This girl.
-What is it?

820
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:32,102
Miho's going to follow the model inmates.

821
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:34,396
-(sighs)
-SOONTAE: Hey, let's go.

822
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:35,981
-Let's all go together.
-KIKWANG: Okay.

823
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:38,733
JIHOON:
Gosh, you just opened a new office.

824
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:41,903
Should I have brought an orchid?

825
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:44,948
(tense music)

826
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:48,326
You two can go ahead.

827
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:49,577
Okay. Let's go.

828
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:54,749
(door opens)

829
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,585
-(Jihoon inhales sharply)
-(door closes)

830
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:59,254
(exhales heavily)

831
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:03,800
Why would someone so shabby
come to such a precious place?

832
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:06,720
I told you. I'm a fan of Park Changho.

833
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:10,932
Things were good, so why did you do it?

834
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:13,685
Is it money?
Did Big Mouse offer to pay you

835
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:15,145
ten billion won or something?

836
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:17,439
Hey. I'm busy, so get to the point.

837
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:22,902
Our people are going on debating
whether or not to kill you.

838
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:25,947
But I'm still on your side.

839
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:30,243
I'm grateful.
You pulled me out of a ditch.

840
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:31,202
So?

841
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:33,580
Since you're Big Mouse's attorney,

842
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:35,707
can you get our money back too?

843
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:37,959
Then what will you do for me?

844
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:40,253
We'll accept you as a part of our family.

845
00:55:43,631 --> 00:55:45,592
So what that means is...

846
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:48,511
It'll be lame to explain it.

847
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:49,888
In any case,

848
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:52,891
it means that your life will be on

849
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:55,101
the Autoban from now on.

850
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:57,687
(mutters)

851
00:55:58,229 --> 00:55:59,647
It's like you're scouting me.

852
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:02,275
-(fingers snap)
-That's right. Scouting.

853
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,695
JIHOON: Nothing good can come
from making an enemy out of us.

854
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:09,574
Don't take the rough path and do as I say.

855
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:12,285
(Changho sighs)

856
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:15,497
If you want to recruit me,

857
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:18,875
tell Chairman Kang to come here himself
and welcome me.

858
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:21,336
What?

859
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:23,713
I'm the one giving you the chance,
not the other way around.

860
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,173
You still don't get it?

861
00:56:25,256 --> 00:56:27,258
(tense music)

862
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:32,305
(music stops)

863
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:36,518
(footsteps)

864
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:38,603
(ominous music)

865
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:47,529
GUARD: Get moving.

866
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:03,503
(retractable door clangs)

867
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:06,589
(beeping)

868
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:36,286
(clicks)

869
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:42,000
(door clangs)

870
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:47,964
(suspenseful music)

871
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:55,680
There's a big shutter door, but no way in.

872
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:57,265
MIHO: Where are you, Dad?

873
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:09,235
EXIT

874
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:12,489
(blares)

875
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:14,365
(hissing)

876
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:16,451
(suspenseful music)

877
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:21,456
(ground rumbling)

878
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:36,262
(rats squeaking)

879
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:41,643
(rumbling continues)

880
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:44,103
(rats squeaking)

881
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:46,189
(ominous music)

882
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:47,357
(birds chirping)

883
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:50,818
KIKWANG: We're almost there, so just wait.

884
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:54,113
We don't know what that place is for,
so don't go in.

885
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:55,406
Wait until we get there.

886
00:58:56,741 --> 00:58:58,701
Miho, are you listening?

887
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:00,161
-(explosion)
-(shrieks)

888
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:02,247
(tense music)

889
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:06,209
Miho. What's wrong?

890
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:10,004
I think something happened inside.

891
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:12,799
(rumbling)

892
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:19,097
(inmates shouting)

893
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:23,393
INMATE: It's a sinkhole! Get out!

894
00:59:23,476 --> 00:59:26,187
(ground rumbling)

895
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:29,148
No. 1503.

896
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:30,525
KIKWANG: What are you saying?

897
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:35,947
Call 911 for me. I'll call you back.

898
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:38,658
Miho. Miho!

899
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:41,536
My gosh.

900
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:42,829
Why? Did something happen?

901
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:45,540
I think something happened. My gosh.

902
00:59:45,623 --> 00:59:46,708
(line ringing)

903
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:50,503
Yes, is this 911? I'm near Mount Haryong.

904
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:53,631
(indistinct shouts)

905
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:55,758
(music intensifies)

906
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:58,845
(inmates groaning)

907
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,855
(indistinct murmurs)

908
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:13,484
(inmate coughing)

909
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:32,587
(ominous music)

910
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:36,966
(hissing)

911
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:14,003
(hissing continues)

912
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:18,633
(inmate groaning)

913
01:01:18,716 --> 01:01:20,968
MIHO: Are you okay?

914
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:22,553
-Go straight up this way.
-INMATE: Okay.

915
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:25,598
(groaning continues)

916
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:29,644
(ominous music)

917
01:01:41,572 --> 01:01:44,158
(indistinct murmurs)

918
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:46,994
(indistinct shouts)

919
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:49,747
-MIHO: Can you move?
-INMATE 1: Yes.

920
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:52,166
(grunting)

921
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:54,961
INMATE 2: Help me.

922
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:57,505
Help me.

923
01:01:57,588 --> 01:01:59,841
Are you okay? Can you get up?

924
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:00,925
Someone help!

925
01:02:04,345 --> 01:02:06,681
(groaning)

926
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:11,644
(ominous music)

927
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:14,021
(grunts)

928
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:16,482
(Miho breathing heavily)

929
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:19,235
(rocks rattling)

930
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:43,050
(inmate murmuring)

931
01:02:44,677 --> 01:02:45,970
MIHO: Are you okay?

932
01:02:46,053 --> 01:02:47,597
(groaning)

933
01:02:56,272 --> 01:02:57,648
MIHO: Come on.

934
01:02:57,732 --> 01:03:00,234
(grunting)

935
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:02,403
Come on.

936
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:05,823
(inmate gasping)

937
01:03:08,534 --> 01:03:09,869
MIHO: Are you okay?

938
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:12,246
(gasps, whimpers)

939
01:03:13,247 --> 01:03:14,415
No. 1503.

940
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:16,417
MIHO: I'm Ko Miho. Are you okay?

941
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:20,713
Can you get up?

942
01:03:21,672 --> 01:03:23,007
(both grunting)

943
01:03:23,382 --> 01:03:25,009
(sprinklers pouring)

944
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:37,021
(ominous music)

945
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:48,074
MAYOR CHOI: Fortunately,
there were no casualties in this accident.

946
01:03:50,451 --> 01:03:52,036
I'm sure there will be in the future.

947
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:56,415
MAYOR CHOI: I'll take care of it quietly,
so that nobody mentions it.

948
01:03:58,543 --> 01:04:00,545
(ominous music)

949
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:05,091
When I first developed NF9,

950
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:08,302
I had a friend who warned me
that there might be problems.

951
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:13,558
That friend was right.

952
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:17,728
FRIEND: If you continue like this,
the risk is too high.

953
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:19,772
It may seem okay now,

954
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:24,110
but after time, there will come a point
where we can't hide the problems.

955
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:27,280
ELDER: That friend was in charge
of the research center.

956
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:29,782
He said there was a problem with NF9

957
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:32,243
and asked that we push back
applying for a patent by a year.

958
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:34,579
But my decision was different.

959
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:38,708
I thought if we missed our chance,
we'd never get to apply for a patent.

960
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:40,501
Even if we must take a risk,

961
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:42,587
we must grab any chances
that come our way.

962
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:43,588
That's my way.

963
01:04:43,671 --> 01:04:47,341
But you should consider
whether this is for our country's benefit.

964
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:49,594
People will get hurt.

965
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:52,972
No matter how hard you try to persuade me,
my decision has been made.

966
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:55,266
(sighs)

967
01:04:55,808 --> 01:04:58,936
FRIEND:
Let me give you one last piece of advice.

968
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:01,188
You may act like you're a patriot,

969
01:05:01,272 --> 01:05:05,359
but within that hypocrisy,
you don't care for the people at all.

970
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:09,780
In the end, that will only come back
to you as a disaster.

971
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:14,827
ELDER:
He told me not to act like a patriot,

972
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:18,080
and he left the site forever.

973
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:22,460
Grandpa.

974
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:32,094
(suspenseful music)

975
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:41,437
(eerie music)

976
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:45,983
(music stops)

977
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:51,614
What happened to him?

978
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:54,075
He died.

979
01:05:57,536 --> 01:06:00,581
BOY: Grandpa! No!

980
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:02,583
Grandpa. No.

981
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:05,836
Grandpa...

982
01:06:07,421 --> 01:06:09,340
Do you regret losing your friend?

983
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:13,010
Regrets are for the weak.

984
01:06:14,553 --> 01:06:17,682
Even if I were to go back to that time,
I would've made the same choice.

985
01:06:18,683 --> 01:06:21,811
I do not refuse to be the bad guy
for the sake of the country.

986
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:23,437
That is my justice.

987
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:27,066
ELDER: Doha.

988
01:06:27,608 --> 01:06:29,068
What is your justice?

989
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:31,654
(suspenseful music)

990
01:06:32,947 --> 01:06:35,074
Justice holds no importance to me.

991
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:41,163
Justice is something
that's exclusive for winners.

992
01:06:41,914 --> 01:06:44,458
So first, I will become a winner.

993
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:55,261
Release Big Mouse on bail.

994
01:06:57,096 --> 01:07:01,308
I'll finish things
with what I believe justice to be.

995
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:06,147
(sighs)

996
01:07:06,939 --> 01:07:08,941
(tense music)

997
01:07:12,486 --> 01:07:13,571
REPORTER 1: Here they come!

998
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:17,158
REPORTER 2: Why were you released on bail?

999
01:07:17,241 --> 01:07:18,826
REPORTER 3:
Who paid your three-billion-won bail?

1000
01:07:18,909 --> 01:07:19,994
REPORTER 4: Were you pressured into it?

1001
01:07:20,077 --> 01:07:22,371
REPORTER 5: Are you going to reveal
the truth of Professor Seo's case?

1002
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:23,789
(reporters clamoring)

1003
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:26,000
REPORTER (on TV):
Mr. No, who is accused of being Big Mouse,

1004
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:28,461
was released on bail this morning.

1005
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:30,713
About Mr. No's application for bail,

1006
01:07:30,796 --> 01:07:33,132
Gucheon District Prosecutors' Office
Division 7 has stated

1007
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:35,468
that the defendant
has a right to a defense,

1008
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:40,097
and has accepted it on the basis
there was probable cause to do so.

1009
01:07:40,681 --> 01:07:42,683
The conditions set
by the Justice Department

1010
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:44,477
was a three-billion-won bail,

1011
01:07:44,977 --> 01:07:47,563
house arrest,
wearing an electronic anklet,

1012
01:07:47,646 --> 01:07:50,274
an overseas travel ban,
contacting witnesses,

1013
01:07:50,357 --> 01:07:53,235
or doing anything
that could impact a testimony,

1014
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:56,197
and real-time location tracking.

1015
01:07:56,989 --> 01:07:59,867
The Justice Department
also received a written oath

1016
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:02,078
stating that he will attend
all remaining trials

1017
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:04,622
and will not attempt to get rid of
any evidence.

1018
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:08,918
(tense music)

1019
01:08:21,889 --> 01:08:23,891
(music stops)

1020
01:08:24,725 --> 01:08:25,726
(car door closes)

1021
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:29,146
NO PARK TEPPANYAKI

1022
01:08:32,149 --> 01:08:33,234
(No Park gasps)

1023
01:08:33,317 --> 01:08:34,693
You were a chef?

1024
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:38,906
The happiest moments of my life

1025
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:41,700
were when I cooked for my daughter

1026
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:45,412
and made delicious meals
for my customers here.

1027
01:08:46,288 --> 01:08:48,290
(dramatic music)

1028
01:08:54,505 --> 01:08:55,548
(sighs)

1029
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:01,971
(No Park sighs)

1030
01:09:04,181 --> 01:09:05,182
(chuckles)

1031
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:08,769
I should clean first.

1032
01:09:09,895 --> 01:09:11,564
Come for dinner
with your wife this evening.

1033
01:09:13,065 --> 01:09:14,692
I'll cook for you.

1034
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:19,071
What you said to me before...

1035
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:23,617
You said I was destined to die...

1036
01:09:23,701 --> 01:09:26,620
But someone said I had to save you.

1037
01:09:27,746 --> 01:09:31,125
I couldn't stop thinking about it.
Who was it?

1038
01:09:34,753 --> 01:09:36,672
Do you still have something
to hide from me?

1039
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:44,638
NO PARK:
Come here tomorrow night at 9 p.m.

1040
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:47,558
I'll introduce you to them.

1041
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:54,106
(exhales)
Be sure to follow the conditions.

1042
01:09:54,565 --> 01:09:56,025
It'll be trouble if you don't.

1043
01:09:56,108 --> 01:09:57,109
(smirks)

1044
01:09:59,111 --> 01:10:01,322
(dramatic music)

1045
01:10:22,092 --> 01:10:24,094
(foreboding music)

1046
01:10:24,178 --> 01:10:25,304
(door opens)

1047
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:27,306
(faucet running)

1048
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:29,725
-(faucet closes)
-(door closes)

1049
01:10:39,109 --> 01:10:41,278
NO PARK TEPPANYAKI

1050
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:42,655
(car window rustling)

1051
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:46,075
Why aren't you getting in?

1052
01:10:47,451 --> 01:10:48,661
(sighs heavily)

1053
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:50,663
I can't believe it.

1054
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:54,375
He had his gang's sign
on the wall in public,

1055
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:56,794
but nobody figured it out.

1056
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:13,644
(foreboding music)

1057
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:19,275
(music intensifies)

1058
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:22,486
(explosion)

1059
01:11:22,569 --> 01:11:25,155
(suspenseful music)

1060
01:11:41,672 --> 01:11:43,674
(closing theme music)

1061
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:55,728
BIG MOUTH

1062
01:12:15,789 --> 01:12:18,584
BIG MOUTH

1063
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:20,294
NO PARK: It's okay if you fail.

1064
01:12:20,711 --> 01:12:23,505
Just don't give up.

1065
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:25,883
Setting your soul on fire...

1066
01:12:25,966 --> 01:12:27,426
is how I get my revenge.

1067
01:12:27,509 --> 01:12:31,180
Recently, the number of cancer patients
in Gucheon is at least 20 times higher.

1068
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:34,433
-(glass shatters)
-What? Suicide?

1069
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:37,644
MIHO: Use bad guys
to step all over other bad guys.

1070
01:12:37,728 --> 01:12:40,773
He's just as dangerous, if not more,
than Big Mouse.

1071
01:12:40,856 --> 01:12:42,483
You want to collude with me?

1072
01:12:42,566 --> 01:12:45,944
CHANGHO: I'm going to reveal
all the crimes they committed.
