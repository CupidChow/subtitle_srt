Do you believe everything
Mayor Choi is saying?

12
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:32,050
MIHO'S FATHER: Changho is just acting.

13
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,135
You said it yourself.

14
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,346
Four people have died.

15
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:38,640
Three in the prison
and one in the Prosecutors' Office.

34
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,901
He's sleeping. Tiptoe around quietly.

WARDEN PARK (over speakers in English):

-Luck. Luck.
-JERRY (in Korean): My gosh.

39
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:43,663
(in English)
Set!

40
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:46,749
(in Korean)
Geez. I should break those speakers soon.

41
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,918
-Seriously. Boss is sleeping.
-I have an announcement.

42
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,838
Volunteers are visiting us today.

43
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,464
I'll make it simple.

44
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:56,718
I want you to make sure you smile

45
00:02:56,801 --> 00:03:00,305
and say thank you to everyone today.

46
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,557
WARDEN PARK:
If anything unfortunate happens,

47
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,309
you will get one month in solitary

48
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,060
and 100 hours of discipline training.

49
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:09,147
That is all!

(microphone echoes over speakers)

51
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,067
What volunteers?

52
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,444
JERRY: Boss. Are you up?

53
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,863
They're medical volunteers
that come every quarter.

54
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:19,657
They give us special meals,
so it's like Christmas for inmates.

55
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,409
What kind of unfortunate thing can happen?

56
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:23,828
Well, guys that hit on nurses,

57
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:25,622
sending notes asking them out,

58
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,832
guys that throw tantrums
for food and get into fights.

59
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,375
All sorts of things.

60
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,128
I don't need a checkup, so you should go.

61
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:33,922
JERRY: Okay.

62
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,258

VOLUNTEER

65
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,139
Let's review the schedule.

66
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,391
JUHEE: The medical volunteers

67
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,561
will administer flu shots
and give dental care to start with.

68
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,898
It will take anywhere
from three to three and a half hours.

69
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,943
Professor Jang,
will the special meal be ready then?

70
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,194
Yes.

71
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,113
And as always,

72
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,991
don't act rashly and watch what you do.

73
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,580
Ms. Ko. Are you listening to me?

74
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,041
Pardon?

75
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,004
(clears throat)
Yes, ma'am.

76
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:17,882
Let's get on the bus.

77
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:28,142
Dr. Hyun. You have such a difficult life
supporting your mayor of a husband.

78
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,144
What brings you here?

79
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,771
JIHOON'S WIFE: The elder told me to go.

80
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:33,856
He said I should be in the photo.

81
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,735
I guess he has big plans for Jihoon.

82
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,363
Just do what Professor Jang
tells you to do in the cooking team.

83
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,073
They'll need a lot of help.

84
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:43,241
Sure.

85
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,451
(suspenseful music)

86
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:48,997
Why did you invite her?
She'll only cause trouble.

87
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,164
(Jihoon's wife scoffs)

88
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,551
MAYOR CHOI: Park Changho...

89
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,511
He's Big Mouse.

90
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,096
CHANGHO: It's to win the trial.

91
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,139
I just need you to trust me.

92
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:09,642
You're being fooled
just as I was fooled by my father.

93
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:13,021
Your husband really is Big Mouse.

94
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,355
Changho is pretending...

95
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,316
I gave him a fake list of names.

96
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,402
MAYOR CHOI: Park Changho knew
the real names of the druggies

97
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,362
that only Big Mouse knew.

98
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:24,198
He said he was Big Mouse.

99
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,492
Don't say a word to Miho.

100
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,910
He told me not to tell you.

101
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,414
(suspenseful music)

102

Thank you for remembering us and visiting.

107
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,978
No problem.

108
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,606
This is Ashley Kim,
CEO of Woojeong Gallery.

109
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:57,690
It's her first time here.

110
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:00,568
Right, you're Mr. Gong's wife.

111
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,695
-Welcome.

WARDEN PARK: Nice to meet you.

113
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:10,620
You must be tired from the trip out here.

114
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,413
I hope you have a good experience.

119
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,854
Can I request a visit with an inmate?

120
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,606
Go to the Civil Service Office.

121
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,441
(doors creak open)

122
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,738

What hospital came?

128
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,106
Gucheon University Hospital.

129
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,194
Can you open the doors to the showers?

130
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,280
(quirky music)

131
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,199
No, open the door...

JERRY: I just finished ironing it for you.

135
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,269
Tell everyone

136
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:01,022
that I won't forgive anyone
who causes trouble today.

137
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:03,816
I already told the helpers
to tell everyone your wife's here.

138
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,361
Oh, right. Where are the VIPs?

139
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:10,781
(sighs)
I don't know. They said they'd call.

140
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,075
CHAEBONG: We need to...

141
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:17,121
HOPEFUL REFORM TO OPEN DOORS
TO A BRIGHT FUTURE

142
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:18,873
Where you headed?

143
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,043
Why? You collect a toll here?

144
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:24,420
(tense music)

145
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,551
CHAEBONG:
You're going to keep acting like this?

146
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:33,679
Hey. Call the warden.

147
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,395
-Hey.
-Hey. Where are you going?

148
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,897
Hey!

149
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:48,361
-DOOGEUN: Hey! Let us down!
-CHAEBONG: Hey!

150
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,488
-Put us down!
-CHAEBONG: Hey!

151
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,865
-INMATE: Stay still!
-Let go!

152
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,952
-Do you want to die?
-CHAEBONG: Hey! I won't go!

153
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,371
DOOGEUN: Let go! Hey!

154
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:00,498
-You can't do this!
-INMATE: Go on.

-DOOGEUN: Hey.

157
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,044
-Hey.
-Damn.

158
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,797
Just stay here and be quiet for today.

159
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,507
His wife is coming today,

160
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,717
so it'll be uncomfortable
if you guys meet her.

161
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,511
JERRY: So please be understanding.

162
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:14,971
INMATE: Lock it up!

163
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,640
-CHAEBONG: Hey. Park Changho!
-DOOGEUN: Hey! What are you doing?

164
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,350
-DR. HAN: Hey!

You'll get to visit with her too.
My boss is so considerate.

Are you in cahoots with Big Mouse?

What... are you talking about? What?

Seriously.

188
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,659
Why would that jerk
give you special treatment?

189
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,369
How would I know?

190
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,038
Ask him yourself.

191
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,998
When he dragged you out,

192
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:26,042
did you say something to him?

What would I tell him?

194
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,920
Did you betray us and join him...

Hey! My gosh!

with that nonsense. Okay?

199
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,557
He's trying to drive a wedge between us.

It's obvious. Can't you tell?

201
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:46,604
Gosh. When you see your wife,

202
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:49,982
ask her about what's going on
with our sick bail. Okay?

00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,015
or the names on the card?

331
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,184
Hey!

332
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,645
I want to talk to him for one minute.

333
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,316
CHANGHO: When I saw how urgent
Mayor Choi looked, I was certain

334
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,068
that the names on the card were real.

335
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,946
(tense music)

336
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,950
What about the witness dying
at the Prosecutors' Office?

337
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,747
CHANGHO:
He was sending messages through the cards.

338
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,667
(ominous music)

339
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,335
The things he planned and committed.

340
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:57,839
The things that will happen.

341
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,968

(orchestral music continues)

344
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,936
So the person who did this to you
is the real Big Mouse.

345
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,316
Then it has nothing to do
with Professor Seo's case.

346
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,402
(tense music)

347
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:23,865
He sent me tarot card
Number 20, "Judgement."

348
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:25,867
(tense music continues)

349
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,370
MIHO: Judgement? Like a punishment?

350
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,498
He wants me to reveal the truth
about Seo Jaeyoung

351
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,125
and punish them for it.

352
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,210
(music stops)

353
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:38,213
But why do you have to do it?

354
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,095
MIHO: Changho.

355
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,764
Can't you just tell everyone the truth?

356
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,101
(solemn music)

357
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:52,936
(mutters)

358
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,023
Then I'll die.

(ominous music)

360
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:02,404
CHANGHO:
Then I'll really become Big Mouse.

361
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:06,825
That's why he keeps giving me missions
and testing me.

362
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,745
The moment he deems me useless,

363
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,165
he'll kill me.

364
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,718
But you can't be used like this forever.

365
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,847
I'm using him too.

366
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,227
What do you mean?
How are you using Big Mouse?

CONFESSIONAL BIBLE

368
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:40,025
Everyone.
The work of art you see in front of you

369
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:44,237
was made by my boss
after he suddenly received inspiration.

JERRY: So look at it with your eyes
and keep it in your heart.

371
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:49,451

Don't you think?

372
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,536
(suspenseful music)

373
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,005
CHANGHO:
I sent him a message for the first time.

374
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:06,093
I told him I would fight
if he gave me the weapons I needed.

375
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:18,397
CHANGHO: He answered
by giving me tarot card Number One.

CHANGHO: "Magician."

377
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:22,818
He acknowledged my skills.

378
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,406
It also means he got caught in my trap.

379
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,909
MIHO: Your trap? What do you mean?

380
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:33,412
I purposely dragged Big Mouse
into this fight

381
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,414
to find out who he is.

00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,298
I need to find out who Big Mouse is and...

386
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:46,842
I'll find Professor Seo's paper.

387
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,970
I'll catch one of the rabbits.

I'm sorry, Changho.

393
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:12,117
I had no idea what you were going through,
and I doubted you foolishly.

394
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:17,122
I'm the one who's sorry.
You didn't do anything wrong.

395
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:18,582
Neither did you.

396
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,669

00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:46,451
(Dr. Han exhales)

494
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,286
Honey.

495
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,164
I...

496
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:53,082
(exhales sharply)

497
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,293
...will be released on sick bail soon.

498
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,378
(tense music)

499
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,297
I know you're lonely,
but wait a bit longer.

500
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,053
(chuckling)

501
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:11,601
DR. HAN: Honey.
You know you're the only one for me.

502
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:13,645
It's because I love you, honey.

503
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:16,064
Gosh. I missed you so much.

504
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:18,441
(sighs)

505
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:21,528
-INMATE 1: Thank you.
-INMATE 2: I want lots.

506
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:22,654
INMATE 3: It's simple.

507
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:24,197
-It must be home-style.
-INMATE 4: Look at this.

508
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,408
-Thank you.
-INMATE 3: Hurry up. People are waiting.

509
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:32,288
MESS HALL

510
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:34,791
INMATE: Big Mouse is here!

511
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,668
Stop moving!

512
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,670
Everyone stand!

513
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:42,340
-Hello, Boss!
-INMATES: Hello, Boss!

514
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,345
INMATE: Sit down!

515
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:58,857
You're Jang Heeju. Right?

516
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,234
CHANGHO:
You changed your name from Jang Geunsook.

517
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:04,112
JERRY: Hello, Geunsook. Give me some food.

518
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:06,906
Your husband's in Cheongju Penitentiary
for a hit-and-run. Right?

519
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:12,996
Don't criticize Miho too much.
You're in the same position as her.

520
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:19,335
(indistinct chattering)

521
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,672
(suspenseful music)

522
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:33,600
CHANGHO: Congratulations on winning
the Creative Director Award.

523
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:34,684
(chuckles)

524
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,853
-Thanks.
-You spent a lot on the judges.

525
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:39,814
Don't you think you got ripped off
for 350 million?

526
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:42,358
Where did you hear that nonsense?

527
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,611
JERRY: You totally spent that money.
I don't want any.

528
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,363
Hello.

529
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,866
I'm the room leader.

530
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,367
(chuckles)

531
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,456
You do a lot of good work.

532
00:31:57,874 --> 00:32:01,127
I'm not interested
in getting judged by you.

533
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:05,256
Please take care of Miho.

534
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,385
She's very responsible,
and she's good at her job too.

535
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,930
(music intensifies)

536
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,024
INMATE 1:
I am your subordinate starting today!

537
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:25,777
INMATE 2: I will be in your service, Boss.
Enjoy your meal!

538
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,947
-INMATE 1: Enjoy your meal, sir!
-INMATE 2: Attention! Bow!

539
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,657
INMATE 3: I love you, Boss!

540
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,533
-INMATE 1: May you live long, Boss!
-INMATE 3: Thank you!

541
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,118
(music stops)

542
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:45,380
REFORM TO OPEN DOORS
TO A BRIGHT FUTURE

543
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:47,674
Are you hurt?

544
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:50,551
(breathing heavily)
I'm okay.

545
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:51,970
You don't look okay.

546
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,471
Where does it hurt?

547
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,142
(ominous music)

548
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,770
How'd you get that bruise on your neck?

549
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:05,566
Let me see.

550
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,112
It wasn't there this morning.

551
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:12,949
When you went to visit your husband...

552
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:14,409
I'm really fine.

553
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:16,661
Don't worry about it.

554
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:18,746
(suspenseful music)

555
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,016
Report it to 1366.

556
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:43,062
It's a hotline for female victims
of domestic violence.

557
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:47,108
If you can't do it alone, I'll help you.

558
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,609
I can't ignore these things.

559
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:52,196
Just worry about your own husband.

560
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,545
-(microphone echoes)
-(Ashley Kim mutters over microphone)

561
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:11,674
Good job, everyone.

562
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:13,676
If you are all okay,

563
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,971
I'd like to have an afterparty
at my gallery. What do you think?

564
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:19,974
-ASHLEY KIM: Good? Okay?
-(applause)

565
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:24,020
Then we'll go straight there.

566
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,022
ASHLEY KIM: Please go to Woojeong Gallery.

567
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:27,440
MIHO: I'll get off.

568
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:30,735
I would like to go,
but I'm on the night shift today.

569
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:35,490
Sir. Can you drop me off
at the nearest subway station?

570
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,871
Why are you acting out of character?

571
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:44,248
(ominous music)

572
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,501
I thought about it,

573
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:50,546
and we forgot to take a group picture
because of Big Mouse.

574
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,548
I need a photo to show the elder.

575
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,133
You're doing this for a mere photo?

576
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:57,470
We can have a party too.
It's good all around.

577
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:01,599
(yawns)

578
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:08,189
(bus hissing)

579
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,405
(bus door closes)

580
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:19,158
(engine starts)

581
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,244
(ominous music)

582
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:28,668
(sighs)

583
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,383
(line ringing)

584
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,677
Hey, Dad. I'm done.

585
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,679
-Did you see Changho?
-Did you talk to him?

586
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:43,724
I'll give you a short explanation.

587
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:47,687
Park Changho is Park Changho.

588
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,022
(dramatic music)

589
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,233
What does that mean?

590
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,735
(Miho's father chuckles)

591
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,947
Hey. It's too short.

592
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,491
Then do you need more?

593
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,952
You're right. Changho is Changho.

594
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:05,163
Your husband, my son-in-law.

595
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:07,707
-(laughs)
-My friend. Right?

596
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,458
He's not Big Mouse, is he?

597
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,044
I have to go.

598
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,381
(phone beeps)

599
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,967
(dramatic music)

600
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:19,927
(sighs)

601
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,474
(gun fires)

602
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,019
(ominous music)

603
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:29,937
(chuckles)

604
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,647
-(gun cocks)
-(in English) Go.

605
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:33,941
(gun fires)

606
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,070
-Go.
-(gun fires)

607
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:39,697
(gun cocks)

608
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,781
(mutters)

609
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:43,701
(gun cocks)

610
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:44,911
Go.

611
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,287
(gun fires)

612
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,873
(tense music)

613
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:51,125
(gun clicking)

614
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,210
Go.

615
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:53,419
(gun fires)

616
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:55,963
(gun clicking)

617
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:02,637
(in Korean)
Hey! Release the clay target

618
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,473
after I say "go," you idiot!

619
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:06,891
Calm down, Mr. Gong.

620
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:08,601
(mutters)

621
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:10,436
-(gun cocks)
-I'm calm.

622
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:12,605
(in English)
Go.

623
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:14,232
(gun fires)

624
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,316
(mutters angrily)

625
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:19,987
-(gun clicks)
-MAYOR CHOI: Go.

626
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:21,697
(gun fires)

627
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:26,410
JIHOON (in Korean): Why won't it load?

628
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,413
You lost twice.

629
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,582
(music stops)

630
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:35,503
Once to Doha, and once to yourself.

631
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:38,506
Well. It's been a while since I last shot.

632
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:39,966
If you can't do it, don't compete.

633
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,718
Mayor Choi wanted to shoot...

634
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:45,137
Why did you get involved
and complicate things?

635
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,223
I told you to focus on your company!

636
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:50,768
So what happened, sir?

637
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:54,105
The gunpowder smells disgusting.

638
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,523
Let's go inside, sir.

639
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:56,607
Doha, you can push me.

640
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,777
Yes, sir.

641
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:04,740
(ominous music)

642
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:26,929
So... can we get them out on sick bail?

643
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,306
Did you think it'd be easy?

644
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:31,892
But then, you must've asked me
because it was hard.

645
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:33,936
I'm sorry.

646
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,689
Their situation is dire right now.

647
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:38,107
I can't guarantee anything.

648
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,985
The judge in charge is Park Chulsoo.
He and I have bad blood.

649
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:45,865
Do you mean Chief Judge Park Chulsoo from
Criminal Division One of the High Court?

650
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:49,035
ELDER: When I was in the Logistics
Support Group, his father was my adjutant.

651
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:51,996
Park Chulsoo thinks
his father died because of me.

652
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:55,041
I'll meet with him.

653
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:57,543
(tense music)

654
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:00,338
He and I were in the same study group
at college.

655
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:01,964
MAYOR CHOI: We trained together too.

656
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:04,800
ELDER: Doha, you should've been
in charge of this from the start.

657
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:06,427
He shouldn't have gotten involved.

KYUNGSOOK: I'm the guardian for Nam Yisoo,
the patient in room 701.

666
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:41,212
Hello, Ms. Kim Kyungsook.
Why did you call?

667
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:45,341
KYUNGSOOK:
Are you looking for Professor Seo's paper?

668
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:48,344
I know where that is.

669
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:51,972
Where is it?

670
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:54,475
(ominous music)

671
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:57,228
Tell me. Where is that paper?

672
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:01,649
KYUNGSOOK: But I need money right now.
A lot of money.

673
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:06,153
Ms. Ko. I know you have a lot of money
hidden away.

674
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,114
I do?

675
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:10,241
KYUNGSOOK:
Can you give me the amount that I want?

676
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:12,910
(ominous music)

677
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:14,036
(sighs)

678
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,041
I'll give you the money.

679
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:21,585
But before that,
I want to hear about the paper.

680
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:25,131
KYUNGSOOK: I can't trust you.

681
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:27,967
MIHO: How can I trust
that you're telling me the truth?

682
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:31,637
If you give me a reason to believe you,
I can give you money.

683
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,810
It's in the cross necklace.

684
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:42,773
Who has that necklace?

685
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:44,567
That woman...

686
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,862
(music intensifies)

687
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,447
(footsteps approaching)

688
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,865
MIHO: Who is that woman?

689
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:55,536
Hello?

690
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:58,330
Hello? Kyungsook? Do you hear me?

691
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:00,207
-(glass shatters)
-(yelps)

692
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:03,627

693
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,422

(sirens wailing)

697
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,950
MIHO'S FATHER: Miho.

698
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,035
(exhales)

699
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:38,746
Are you okay?

700
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:43,125
MIHO'S FATHER: What happened? Who died?

701
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:47,004
Professor Seo's paper...

702
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,840
is with that woman.

703
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:53,302
Who is that woman?

704
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:55,387
(music intensifies)

705
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:57,723
A woman with a cross necklace.

706
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,359
Dad, give me the car keys.

707
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:09,818
MIHO'S FATHER:
Where are you going? I'll join you.

708
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,028
I don't have time. Hurry.

709
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:13,113
(tense music)

710
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:16,575
You know the program, Hundred Year Health?
It airs in the morning.

711
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:19,912
Can you download the episode
that aired on Thursday?

712
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,790
MIHO'S FATHER: Miho.

713
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:32,216
MIHO: It's the director.

714
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:34,260
She looks good on camera.

715
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:37,179
This show is quite popular these days,
isn't it?

716
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,103
JUHEE: Are you listening to me?

717
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,064
Pardon?

718
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:50,776

00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:58,867

727
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:27,313
Why did you come here?
What about your shift?

728
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:29,231
Where's Dr. Hyun?

729
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:32,401

00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:44,288
What are you doing?

(exhales sharply)

734
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:51,920
Someone died at the hospital.

735
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:54,298
Do you know how many die at our hospital?

736
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:56,300
It was a murder.

737
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:58,385

740
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,106
I didn't get a call.

741
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,524
Ms. Kim Kyungsook

742
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,569
was the guardian for Nam Yisoo,
the patient in room 701.

743
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:16,945
So?

744
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:19,031
She called me right before she died.

745
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,826
She told me Professor Seo's paper
was inside a cross necklace.

746
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:29,583
(scoffs)

747
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:35,089
JUHEE: Didn't you say that you had
that paper, Ms. Ko?

748
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:36,924
A person just died!

749
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,345
Ms. Kim...

750
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:45,849
was murdered, Dr. Hyun.

751
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:50,479

(Miho grunts)

755
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:16,588
Do you intend to break
my mother's heirloom?

756
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:18,674
(music fades)

757
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:28,350
I'm sorry.

758
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,233
(suspenseful music)

759
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:40,696
Was her name Kim Kyungsook?

760
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,198
Did she say it was me?

761
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:46,577
That the cross necklace was mine?

762
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:48,996
No.

763
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:51,290
Then why do you suspect me?

764
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:54,710
I'm sure I'm not the only one
with a cross necklace.

765
00:45:57,671 --> 00:46:00,174
File a request for investigation
with the police.

766
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:03,427
Don't bother people
with your sloppy deductions.

I don't need it.

It was a card company.

Darn it.

787
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:32,015
Why haven't our sick bail been decided?

Call Mr. Gong.

00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:12,973
It means I have to do it myself.

804
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:17,311
Did this jerk figure out my intentions
and take a step back?

805
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:21,815
No. He probably hasn't figured it out yet.

They say the most painful way to die
is to burn to death.

824
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:22,542
What is it this time?

825
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:27,589
You know Peter Hong was poisoned
at the Prosecutors' Office?

826

CHANGHO: He died too comfortably.

827
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:32,010
He should've been burned to death.

828
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:39,685
CHANGHO:
All sorts of garbage are gathered here.

829
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:42,270
People are like that too.

830
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:44,439
There are all sorts of pieces of garbage.

831
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:48,110
Do you know who's the worst of them?

832
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:54,282
Traitors.

833
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:56,952

Hiccups?

CHANGHO: What are you guilty of?

841
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:29,818
Were you going to betray me
once you get out on bail?

842

No. I wasn't.

you'll go in there.

00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:18,784
That's hot.

859
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:20,911
Isn't it hot?

860
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:22,537
Gosh, my ear.

Put your password in. Your password.

00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:33,757
I did.

867
00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:37,094
That's your ID. This is frustrating.

868
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:38,887
(sighs)

869
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:41,765
Why is it so hard to sign up
for the broadcasting station's site?

870
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:45,435
MIHO'S FATHER: So in this box,
I'll type in seven, seven, eight, eight.

871
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:47,104
-Okay.
-(laptop chimes)

872
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:50,232
Why do I have to verify again?

873

SOONTAE: Move over.

874
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:56,279
MIHO'S FATHER:
I got it. Hold on. So I put it in here.

875
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:58,365
-My phone number...
-That necklace

876
00:51:58,448 --> 00:52:00,075
belonged to my late mother-in-law.

877
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:01,701
I'm really sorry.

878
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:04,663
I'll apologize to Dr. Hyun again.

879
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:06,957
With her personality, you don't need to.

880
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,418
Did you visit Park Changho?

881
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:14,798
Yes.

882
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:16,883
(solemn music)

883
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,515
I believe in Changho.

884
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:30,772
That he's real or fake? Which one?

885
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:33,942
Changho...

886
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:37,070
is doing everything he can to endure this.

887
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:43,368
I know what you're thinking.
You probably think I got fooled again.

888
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:44,536
But...

889
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:48,373
I'm going to see it through.

890
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:51,209
I want to see what's at the end.

891
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:58,717
I'll respect that
since it's your decision.

892
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,387
You don't have to help me anymore.

893
00:53:03,054 --> 00:53:06,266
It's shameless,
and I keep feeling bad to you.

894
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,144
I was looking
for Professor Seo's paper too.

895
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:12,522
I'm not helping you.
It's more like cooperation.

896
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,901
MIHO'S FATHER:
I found out. Miho, come here and watch it.

897
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:17,402
KANG JIHOON:
Hello, I'm Hundred Year Health MC,

898
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:18,695
-Kang Jihoon.
-MIHO'S FATHER: Is this it?

899
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:21,740
-Today, we have four experts to discuss...
-This is from last Thursday.

900
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:23,658
-...things we don't want to face...
-This is it.

901
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:24,951
-...but we have no choice...
-MIHO'S FATHER: Right.

902
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:27,871
-KANG JIHOON: Dr. Hyun.
-Colon cancer doesn't have clear symptoms,

903
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:31,750
so it's very important
to get endoscopy regularly.

904
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:35,629
JUHEE: If you're over 50 years old,
you can get one for free every year.

905
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:39,132
I recommend you get a checkup every year.

906
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:43,720
Since your lifestyle
is the main cause of colon cancer,

907
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:46,806
you need to have healthy eating habits
to prevent it.

908
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:48,183
MIHO: Wait.

909
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:51,019
Professor Jang Hyejin
also has a cross necklace...

910
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:53,647
MIHO'S FATHER: You're right.

911
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:55,482
So she does.

912
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:57,567
(suspenseful music)

913
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:05,450
Where's... Kyungsook's design book?

914
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:07,160
That?

915
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,330
I gave it to you, didn't I?

916
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:13,250
MIHO'S FATHER: Where did you put it?

917
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:14,793
Where did I put it?

918
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:17,587
My gosh. Why are you so forgetful?

919
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,011
MIHO'S FATHER: Is it a notebook?

920
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:27,472
(clattering)

921
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:29,891
(tense music)

922
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:32,519
-I found it.
-(Miho's father mutters)

923
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:40,735
(music intensifies)

924
00:54:42,153 --> 00:54:43,571

(scoffs)

926
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:48,660
We found Professor Seo's paper.

927
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:51,621
Professor Jang Hyejin has it.

928
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:53,707

(panting)

937
00:55:33,538 --> 00:55:34,831
MIHO: It was a murder.

938
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:37,500
She called me right before she died.

939
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:41,129
She told me Professor Seo's paper
was inside a cross necklace.

940
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:42,547
JUHEE: Then why do you suspect me?

941
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:44,632
I'm sure I'm not the only one
with a cross necklace.

942
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:54,684

947
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:04,319
Hey, Hyejin. What happened?

948
00:56:04,402 --> 00:56:05,737
(breathing shakily)

949
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:06,988
Help me.

950
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:09,991
DR. HAN: Honey! Where are you?

951
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:11,701
-Come out!
-Help me.

952
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:13,036

00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:16,247
DR. HAN: Honey!

955
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,541
My gosh! Where did she go?

956
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:20,543
You don't love me, do you?

957
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:22,337
Where did you go?

958
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:24,381

(screaming)

962
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:32,430
Where did you go?

963
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:35,183

964
00:56:38,686 --> 00:56:40,688
(solemn music)

965
00:56:54,285 --> 00:56:55,620
JAEYOUNG: It's going to sting.

966
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:04,629
Wait here for a second.

967
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:23,440
(breathing heavily)

968
00:57:26,484 --> 00:57:27,402

(suspenseful music)

970
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:58,057
JAEYOUNG: Think of this as me.

971
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:03,480
HYEJIN: I'll treasure it forever.

972
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:06,107

DOOGEUN: Hey.

977
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:43,228
If we were going to get out,

978
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:46,606
it would've been nice if they investigated
without us having to be detained.

979
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:50,318
There was talk about special treatment,
so it was better not to draw attention.

980
00:58:51,819 --> 00:58:53,530
CHAEBONG: Dr. Han. You're having
sleep paralysis these days?

981
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:55,198
Why do you look so scared?

982
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:56,366
(Dr. Han grumbles)

983
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:58,451
No, I'm just a bit tired.

984
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:02,455
Don't worry about Big Mouse.

985
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:05,959
The precinct will protect us
24 hours a day.

00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:09,796
Peter

988
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:12,799
died in the Prosecutors' Office
filled with investigators.

989
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:15,051
Mr. Gong said he'd hire private bodyguards

990
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:17,387
who were in the Special Forces.
Don't worry.

991
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:19,430
WARDEN PARK: Congratulations.

992
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:21,933
CHAEBONG: Congratulations?

993
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:25,603
Why does that sound
like you're disappointed

994
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:27,605
-that a source of money is gone.
-(laughs)

995
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:32,402
Give me a chance to see you outside.
I'll treat you to a full course.

996
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:35,822
We'll see how you do with Big Mouse.

997
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:38,700
Your tenure's over. What's next?

998
00:59:38,783 --> 00:59:39,951
(Warden Park sighs)

999
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:42,078
I can't seem to find anything
with good terms.

1000
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:44,664
This place has its share of golden eggs,
right?

1001
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:47,542
It's frustrating
since those eggs don't come often.

1002
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:52,422
If I hear the news that Big Mouse is dead,

1003
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:54,674
I'll bring you the goose.

1004
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:56,634
One that lays a lot of golden eggs.

1005
00:59:58,303 --> 00:59:59,846
In here,

1006
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:01,889
I'm the president.

1007
01:00:02,348 --> 01:00:04,017
I'm Big Mouse,

1008
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:07,437
and Park Changho's nothing but a rat.

1009
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:14,944
(laughter)

1010
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:17,822
Let's go.

1011
01:00:18,406 --> 01:00:20,617
(laughter continues)

1012
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:26,372
(tense music)

1013
01:00:28,082 --> 01:00:32,629
TRUSTWORTHY LAW

1014
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:34,672
DOOGEUN: Goodness.

1015
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:36,299
(Chaebong cheering)

1016
01:00:36,382 --> 01:00:38,259
I'm getting excited.

1017
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:54,567
(music stops)

1018
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:00,531
(chuckles)

1019
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:02,909
You can't tell with those suits on.

1020
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:04,744
Nobody would know you were inmates.

1021
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:06,579
WARDEN PARK: Hey, Park Changho.

1022
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:10,541
I'm warning you. Don't cause trouble.

1023
01:01:13,378 --> 01:01:15,838
The sky in here is the same
as the one out there.

1024
01:01:16,255 --> 01:01:17,674
Nothing changes

1025
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:19,175
if you don't confess at trial.

1026
01:01:19,258 --> 01:01:21,260
Aren't you satisfied with Han Jaeho?

1027
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:25,431
I heard Dr. Han agreed to confess.

1028
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:28,976
All he did was drive,
and only the two of us did the killing.

1029
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:33,314
(door lock buzzes)

1030
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:35,858
-(scoffs)
-DR. HAN: Hey. What are you talking about?

1031
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:36,943
When did I say that?

1032
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:38,986
CHUNSIK: Do you want me to remind you

1033
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:41,781
when it was by telling you
the date and time?

1034
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:44,117
(tense music)

1035
01:01:54,836 --> 01:01:55,878
(sighs)

1036
01:01:57,088 --> 01:01:58,089
Chairman Yang.

1037
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:00,133
Didn't I tell you?

1038
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:04,595
I never betray my people. Okay?

1039
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:05,680
(Chunsik laughs)

1040
01:02:05,763 --> 01:02:08,933
Those without any roots
think money is everything.

1041
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:11,644
But real gangsters are different.

1042
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:14,689
Our relationship isn't one
that can end easily.

1043
01:02:14,772 --> 01:02:16,607
CHAEBONG: Don't you agree, Chairman Yang?

1044
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:19,861
Jaeho.

1045
01:02:20,361 --> 01:02:22,739
You won't be able to come to the trial.

1046
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:25,366
What? What are you talking about?

1047
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:26,451
(Chaebong laughs)

1048
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:29,120
He's in solitary until the trial is over.

1049
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:30,997
Right?

1050
01:02:31,664 --> 01:02:33,249
DR. HAN: I got sick bail.

1051
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:36,294
What right does the warden have
to stop that?

1052
01:02:36,377 --> 01:02:38,296
We never even requested it.

1053
01:02:38,379 --> 01:02:40,089
-(bleats)
-(both laughing)

1054
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:41,758
CHAEBONG:
Warden Park, hurry up and take him.

1055
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:43,843
(tense music)

1056
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:46,721
DR. HAN: Hey.

1057
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:50,183
No. He's trying to drive
a wedge between us!

1058
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:51,809
DR. HAN: This isn't right!

1059
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:53,686
I have to go home!

1060
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:57,190
Let go of me! Let go!

1061
01:02:57,857 --> 01:02:59,650
-(door opens)
-(laughs)

1062
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:01,319
(Dr. Han screaming)

1063
01:03:01,402 --> 01:03:03,196
I have to go home!

1064
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:05,281
(tense music)

1065
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:07,909
(groans)

1066
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:11,996
CHAEBONG: Chairman Yang.

1067
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:16,209
Help me,
so I never have to see that rat again.

1068
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:17,502
Can you do it?

1069
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:22,340
Should I?

1070
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:24,258
Okay, then.

1071
01:03:24,842 --> 01:03:26,594
(laughing)

1072
01:03:26,677 --> 01:03:29,305
WARDEN PARK:
I got the car started. Let's go.

1073
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:30,932
Let's go.

1074
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:34,602
BOTH: Bye.

1075
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:36,729
(Chaebong giggles)

1076
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:40,316
(music intensifies)

1077
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:46,781
PROTECT WHOLEHEARTEDLY
LEAD OTHERS TO THE RIGHT PATH

1078
01:03:59,877 --> 01:04:01,879
(music fades)

1079
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:03,256
(sighs)

1080
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:11,013
(laughs)

1081
01:04:16,978 --> 01:04:18,145
(sighs)

1082
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:20,815
(tense music)

1083
01:04:20,898 --> 01:04:22,149
Boss.

1084
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:34,620
You all got fooled, you stupid idiots.

1085
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:36,706
(music intensifies)

1086
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:41,627
BIG MOUTH

1087
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:43,713
(closing theme music)

1088
01:05:01,689 --> 01:05:04,483
BIG MOUTH

1089
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:06,777
CHANGHO: I'm going to start hunting.

1090
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:08,571
What's in Professor Seo's paper?

1091
01:05:08,654 --> 01:05:10,531
MIHO: They must have something to hide.

1092
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:11,616
I'm going to get blood.

1093
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:13,993
We can analyze
if it's within 12 hours of death.

1094
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:17,121
CHANGHO:
Jerry might know who Big Mouse is.

1095
01:05:17,788 --> 01:05:19,290
Why did you take the tarot card?

1096
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:21,459
I might be able to solve

1097
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:22,960
Professor Seo's paper with this.

1098
01:05:23,377 --> 01:05:26,172
MAYOR CHOI: Do you know who it might be?

1099
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:29,425
JERRY: How funny, Changho.

1100
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:32,219
You're Big Mouse?
