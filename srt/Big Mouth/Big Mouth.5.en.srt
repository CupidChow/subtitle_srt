(music stops)

22
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,944
We need to talk alone.

23
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:52,904
They're waiting inside.

24
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:53,905
It'll be brief.

25
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,908
I'll check with the warden first.

26
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,076
Hey!

27
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:02,997
I want to talk to him for one minute.

28
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,208
(door opens, closes)

29
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:07,544
I won't allow it.

00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:11,589

(tense music)

33
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:20,682
I apologize,
but please understand the position I'm in.

(tense music)

36
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:32,402

00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:00,680
Your confidence is through the roof.

40
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:02,265
I have no reason to be scared.

41
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:09,689
Give me five of your clients' names.

42
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,901
How can I trust you?

43
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:15,278

51
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:44,849
Okay, then.

52
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:46,517
Shall we begin?

53
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,603

You will each write down
the names that you know.

00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,904

Park Garam.

69
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,303
The last one is...

70
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:47,889
It's a foreigner.

71
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,686
"Lucas Martin."

72
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,772

74
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,743
This time, it's 5247's list.

00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,632

00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:54,455

83
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:14,183

It's the same as yours.

(classical music)

86
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,085
Seriously, guys.

87
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:43,713
Is this that shocking?

88
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:46,841
(groans)

89
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,469
CHANGHO: Look at this.

90
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:52,847
"Lucas Martin." You spelled it wrong.

91
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,975
CHANGHO: It's not Martin, it's Martins.

92
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,186
You left out the S.

(inmates clamoring)

96
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,996
Inmate 5247, Big Mouse, wins!

97
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:21,292
(inmates cheering)

98
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,711
I told you he'd win.

99
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,554
Bravo!

100
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,311
Welcome, Big Mouse.

101
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,524
I don't want to be welcomed
for something like this.

102
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,442
(Jihoon scoffs)

103
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,944
(exhales heavily)

104
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,696
Okay, the test is over.
It's time to make some progress then.

105
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,992
Our 100 billion won you swiped.

106
00:08:57,286 --> 00:09:01,290
Before moving forward,
bring me proof that I swiped it.

107
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,960
JIHOON: Obviously, I have that.

108
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,379
You know Peter Hong, don't you?

109
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,506
The punk who managed our fund.

110
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:13,344
That punk went off the grid
once the police put out an APB for him

111
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,346
and called a prosecutor.

112
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:18,975
(inhales sharply)

113
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,686
"Big Mouse took it all."

114
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,271
I see.

115
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:27,775
Then we can catch Peter Pan,
or whatever his name is, and ask him.

116
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,779
(ominous music)

(phone vibrating)

118
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:42,123
Speak.

119
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,129
(phone beeps)

120
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,923
WARDEN PARK: Park Changho.

121
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,509
The prosecutor wants you.

122
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,304
Out of the blue? Why?

123
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,306
(inhales sharply)

124
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,807
Because Peter Hong...

125
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,434
was caught...

126
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,227

127
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,062
What? They caught Peter?

128
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,856
Why didn't you tell us?

129
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,275
-Where?
-(laughing)

130
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:12,403
Damn. Prosecutor Choi is so impatient.

131
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:16,407
I guess he wants
to interrogate you right away. Right?

132
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:19,076

When did you first
make contact with Big Mouse?

137
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,557
It was about five years ago.

138
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:45,978
I was tied to a financial fraud case and
got kicked out of the financial district,

139
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,649
so I was about to end my life.

Damn it.

PETER: I got a call from someone
wanting to invest.

149
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:29,271
STOCKS TO RISE
ET ELECTRONICS, JAEO CHEMICAL, OK PHARMA

00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,233
ET ELECTRONICS, JAEO CHEMICAL, OK PHARMA

(exhales heavily)

152
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,656
At first, he sent 500 million won.

153
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,867
But when I did as he said,

154
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,036
it really grew...

155
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,539
to three billion won in two weeks.

156
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,793
PETER: I was flying high ever since

157
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,212
and was put in charge
of NR Forum's private placement fund.

158
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:59,301
You took orders from someone
you never met to manage all that money?

159
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,761
Do you think that's rational?

160
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,431
Prosecutor.

161
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:07,351
Do you know how it feels to meet
your savior the moment before you die?

162
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:11,605
He becomes your god and Buddha.

163
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,985
I had my soul sucked out of me,
and by the time I came to,

164
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:20,906
all of the money I was managing
had gone to Big Mouse.

165
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,534
PETER: This is so unfair.

166
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,120
Those jerks only used me.

167
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:28,205
(ominous music)

168
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,417
You said you met him, right?

169
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,627
Yes, just once.

(ominous music)

172
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,642
PETER: I couldn't see his face
or hear his voice.

173
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,197
(music stops)

174
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:03,783
Who's this?

175
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,952
The man who was in the car that night.

176
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,038
(suspenseful music)

177
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:22,009
PROSECUTOR: You saw Park Changho there
clearly with your own eyes.

178
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,351
You...

179
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,728
want me to give false testimony?

180
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,271
What false testimony?

181
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,607
He really is Big Mouse.

182
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:42,112
PROSECUTOR: We'll be happy
to finally close this annoying case.

183
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:45,574
The world will become a better place
after getting rid of an evil criminal.

184
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,993
I'll let you get off with probation.

185
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,663
You just have to nod in court
when I ask my questions.

186
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,041

-What is it?
-What?

191
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:33,414
Just say it. Stop glancing at me
and making me uncomfortable.

192
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,420
It's not you, is it?

193
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:40,921
Didn't you say...

194
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,133
the list I had was a fake
that you had made up?

195
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,426
(inhales deeply)

196
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:46,635
Exactly.

197
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:51,140
I just don't understand.

198
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:56,437
You chose the lawyer
for the Seo Jaeyoung case.

199
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,106
Someone I know recommended him.

200
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:01,442
Because I was told to find
an incompetent lawyer.

201
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:02,735
But...

202
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:06,614
the guy you hired
happened to be Big Mouse.

203
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:08,741
CHANGHO: Wow.

204
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,870
What an amazing coincidence.

205
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,458
What's your point?

206
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,543
(tense music)

207
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,011

JIHOON: You looked away.

211
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,020
What does that mean?

212
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:43,108
(laughs)

213
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,818
I was just joking.

214
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,154
Why are you taking me seriously?
You're making me feel bad.

215
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:51,450
Be clear what your objective is.

216
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,702
Is it getting the money back

217
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,038
or dragging me down?

218
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,082
(exhales sharply)
Hey.

219
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,043
Obviously, it's the money.
Why would I drag you down?

220
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,127

222
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,715

(spits)

227
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:26,986
That guy Park Changho
really is Big Mouse, right?

228
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,947
How many times do I have to tell you?
Shall I brief you on the case?

229
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,949
What if Big Mouse retaliates?

230
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,743
I hear his organization is frightening.

231
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:39,206
We're the most frightening organization.
The Prosecution Service.

232
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:43,210
Relax and just follow my instructions.

234

MAYOR CHOI: He has never seen Big Mouse.

235
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,388
What did you order him to do?

236
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:55,764
(shushes)

237
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,308
You're just the audience.

238
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,770
You just need to watch and enjoy.

I did.

256
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,125
Look at him.

How could a witness go out

has Seo Jaeyoung's paper, right?

It was a lie. I met her and confirmed it.

What if it wasn't a lie?

295

At Gucheon Penitentiary.

Yes, I heard.

307
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,748
You're working the night shift,
so you're excused.

It's okay. I'll go too.

You're so dense.

on your own time.

313

is an official hospital event.

and get my hair done.

Go do a lot of noble work.

318
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,821
HEAD NURSE: Why is she so proud?

319
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:24,825
Seriously. She's the most thick-skinned
in the entire hospital.

Yes, it is.

336
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:27,095
My name is Gong Jihoon.

337
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:29,890
You may not know who I am, but...

338
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:32,017
I do know you.

339
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,311
What is it?

340
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:41,276
(suspenseful music)

341
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:46,198
(exhales)

342
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,414
(Jihoon mutters)

343
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:02,798
Welcome.

344
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,092
(Jihoon grunts)

345
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,762
I apologize for calling out of the blue.

346
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:12,599
You haven't eaten, have you?
I ordered you a steak.

347
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:16,478
That's a bit much. We just met
and don't plan on being friends.

348
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:19,231
Then you can watch me eat.

349
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,775
(laughs)

350
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:26,405
What I heard about you was true.
I heard you weren't very pleasant.

351
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:29,116
I'm a very busy person.

352
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:33,078
My calendar's full for half the year
with people I have to see.

353
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:35,831
I squeezed you in
despite my hectic schedule

354
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,249
so please be understanding.

355
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,336
Bring everything I ordered.

356
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,800
(ominous music)

357
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:55,976
JIHOON:
I received an amusing piece of intel.

358
00:23:57,018 --> 00:24:00,814
That you have Seo Jaeyoung's paper.

359
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:03,567
Sell it to me.

360
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,446
How much will you give me?

361
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,739
(mutters)

362
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,158
Whatever you ask for.

363
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,284
(munching)

364
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:13,535
Forget it.

365
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:16,621
It's very important to me as well.

366
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:17,664
(utensil clinks)

367
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:21,585
Do you plan to use it
to get a degree somewhere?

368
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:23,336
(laughs)

369
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,755
I need to save my husband

370
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,799
by finding the culprit
who killed Professor Seo.

371
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:30,302
Hmm.

372
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:32,971
(clears throat)

373
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:35,265
I ask out of curiosity.

374
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,685
Do you really not know

375
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,271
that Park Changho is Big Mouse?

376
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:43,356
(ominous music)

377
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:05,128
Park Changho said
the names of drug clients

378
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:08,590
that only Big Mouse would know.

379
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:12,302
Don't you get it?

380
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:16,181
Your husband really is Big Mouse.

381
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,392
(laughs)

382
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:22,187
MIHO: What do you mean?
Why would you become Big Mouse?

383
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,146
CHANGHO: Just for a while.

384
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,023
It's the only way
I can stay alive in here.

385
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,483
What if you're found guilty?

386
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:29,361
What if you get stuck here
living as Big Mouse forever?

387
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,530
It's to win the trial.

388
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:34,616
To clear my name and walk out of here
with my head held high.

389
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:35,909
I just need you to trust me.

390
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,662
We can go back to the way things were.

391
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:42,791
(scoffs)

392
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,418
(laughs)

393
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:48,838
Is this why you called me here?

394
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:52,592
Making time in your busy schedule
that's packed for half a year?

395
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:55,804
MIHO: Enjoy your steak.

396
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,517
You read the paper, didn't you?

397
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:05,397
JIHOON: Then you should know

398
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,440
that if you hold onto it,

399
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:11,319
you'll be in serious danger.

400
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,406
(tense music)

401
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,244
MIHO: Who will be in greater danger?

402
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:21,204
My husband is Big Mouse, remember?

403
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,501
(tense music)

404
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:32,424
(lips squeaking)

405
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,677
(fork clanking)

406
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:45,812
(music stops)

407
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:51,401
(phone vibrating)

408
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,695
KO MIHO

409
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,198
(phone clicks)

410
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,200
It's Ko Miho.

411
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,286
(pensive music)

412
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:02,412
Yes, go ahead.

413
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:07,584
I just met Gong Jihoon.

414
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:11,004
He really believes Changho is Big Mouse.

415
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:16,176
MIHO: It seems the list of names
you gave him saved him.

416
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:17,469
Thank you.

417
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:20,847
Miho.

418
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:27,145
Do you want to tell me something?

419
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:30,732
No.

420
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,026
I'll be in touch.

421
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:37,656
(phone clicks)

422
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:39,741
(tense music)

423
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,083
(music stops)

424
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:51,169
CHOI DOHA, HYUN JUHEE, SEO JAEYOUNG

425
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:54,547
This is Seo Jaeyoung's call history.

426
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:59,135
They were all work-related,
so there's nothing useful.

427
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:02,555
When is his wife coming from the US?

428
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,224
She has no plans to return.

429
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,434
They were on terrible terms,

430
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,396
so they were separated for over a year
before he died.

431
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:11,940
You said he was into fishing.

432
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,733
Was he in any club or anything?

433
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:14,984
Nothing at all.

434
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,695
What, he went fishing alone?

435
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,905
He was infamous for being a loner.

436
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,741
Hold on.

437
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:28,206
Look at this.

438
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:29,833
What are these?

439
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:32,544
His profile pictures. Take a look.

440
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,588
MIHO'S FATHER: These aren't selfies.

441
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:36,840
Someone else took them.

442
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,883
Look at his smile. They were really close.

443
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:42,929
(tense music)

444
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:50,770
YOUNGSAN RESERVOIR
FISHING SPOT

445
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,606
Do you really think
Seo Jaeyoung gave his paper

446
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,108
to the person who took this photo?

447
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:57,235
That's what my gut tells me.

448
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:59,320
(tense music continues)

449
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:02,240
YOUNGSAN RESERVOIR

450
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:05,869
Excuse me. Have you seen this man before?

451
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:10,373
I have. He used to come fish
two to three times a month.

452
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,584
Did he come alone?

453
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:14,753
Yes, at times.

454
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:17,797
MAN: Why do you ask?

455
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:20,049
We're looking for someone.

456
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:22,677
This man was murdered.

457
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,012
MAN: What?

458
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,556
That's why we're searching for the person
who came with him.

459
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:29,768
Do you remember anything that may help?
Like their appearance?

460
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:32,061
I only saw from a distance

461
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:34,564
and he always wore sunglasses.

462
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:37,567
Anyway, whenever they came together,
they never fished.

463
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,360
They were busy being lovey-dovey.

464
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:42,989
-Lovey-dovey?
-He came with a woman?

465
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:45,283
Yes. I doubt she was his wife.

466
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,869
It was obviously an affair.

467
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,041
(tense music)

468
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:57,170
(indistinct chattering)

469
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:59,255
JERRY:
I'll start distributing the winnings.

470
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:01,466
-INMATE 1: Yes.
-INMATE 2: Let's go.

471
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:04,135
Big Mouse.
Only people who bet on Big Mouse.

472
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,012
JERRY: You'll pay for it
if you try to scam me.

473
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,973
Yongsan Butter. He bet three cards.

474
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,642
Three cards.

475
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:13,311
-Room Four's leader. Two cards.
-ROOM LEADER: Two cards.

476
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:14,395
INMATE: Yes!

477
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,939
I'm No. 5914!

478
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:16,940
Okay, 5914.

479
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:18,691
-No. 5914.
-Mr. 5914 bet four cards.

480
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,527
Okay, four cards.

481
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,736
(cheering and laughing)

482
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,905
Yeongdeungpo Sparrow, two cards.

483
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,532
ROOM LEADER: Sparrow, two cards.

484
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:26,866
INMATE: Hey!

485
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,284
Move!

486
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:31,454
-Sir.
-Boss.

487
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:34,290
It's okay. Do what you were doing.

488
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,459
Don't mind me, okay? Go on.

489
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,419
Hey. Go on.

490
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,296
-Okay, Miari.
-Miari, three cards.

491
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,006
Three cards.

492
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,425
-JERRY: Two cards for this guy.
-Two cards.

493
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,262
-ROOM LEADER: Two.
-JERRY: Weasel! Two cards for Weasel.

494
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:48,972
No. 2015 bet six cards.

495
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:51,224
(inmates exclaim)

496
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:52,684
INMATES: Big win!

497
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,019
Is that everyone? Anyone else?

498
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:58,773
Hold on. Moochangpo Mud Octopus?

499
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,442
-INMATE 1: Who's Mud Octopus?
-INMATE 2: Who is that?

500
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,986
-INMATE 3: Mud Octopus?
-INMATE 4: Come out, Mud Octopus!

501
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:05,738
He bet 50 cards on Big Mouse,
but he hasn't shown up yet.

502
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,156
Jerry.

503
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,993
Shouldn't the host keep what's left?

504
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:12,912
-We can't really donate it now, can we?
-(chuckles)

505
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:15,248
Maybe the octopus crawled back
into the mud.

506
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:17,959
After betting a whopping 50 cards. Gosh.

507
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:21,588
(upbeat music)

508
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,802
Chairman Yang. You were Mud Octopus?

509
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,804
-CHUNSIK: What?
-ROOM LEADER: Goodness.

510
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,890
The VIPs will be hurt...

511
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:35,351
(sucks teeth)
...if they find out you bet on Big Mouse.

512
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:38,605
You gamble based on your instinct,

513
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,940
not on human relations.

514
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,109
-(laughs)
-Pay up, punk.

515
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:45,612
Here you go, sir. I wish you prosperity.

516
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:46,988
That's 150 cards.

517

(music stops)

521
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,436
It's 100 bills per bundle,
60 bundles in all.

522
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:21,189
Count it to make sure
it's 300 million won.

523
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:24,233
I'm sure it is.

524
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:27,737
We're done, okay?

525
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:32,825
Thanks a bunch. I'll use it well.

527

I'll take my 10 percent commission.

528
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,098
This is my cut. No complaints, right?

529

(upbeat music)

530
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,567
Let me buy some benefits with this.

531
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:10,196
I can be a VIP like them, right?

532
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,240
Money

533
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:14,534
is always right.

534
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:20,373
CHANGHO: And this is for a free pass.

535
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,918
As long as I don't commit a serious crime,

536
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:25,878
you let me be.

537
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,548
What about the rest?

538
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:32,760
Hold it for me. I have a feeling
I'll be spending it more often.

DOOGEUN:
A solution won't fall on our laps!

570
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,252
CHAEBONG: A solution to what?

571
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:33,089
We have to do something. We've confirmed
that Park Changho is Big Mouse.

572
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:34,882
Exactly. So what would we do?

573
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,009
Peter Hong's dead.

574
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:39,303
DOOGEUN: He was poisoned
in front of Park Changho.

575
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,806
He can kill anyone here
or in the Prosecutors' Office.

576
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:43,474
He won't go easy on us.

00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,600
Damn it!

578
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:48,563
CHAEBONG: Chairman Yang.

579
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,567
Doogeun seems very worried.

580
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:56,070
Do something to comfort him.

581
00:35:56,571 --> 00:36:00,032
If you worry in front of my boys,

582
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,161
that's defamation.

583
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,707
CHUNSIK: My boys rely solely

00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,060
Confess during the trial...

600
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:12,063
that you were accomplices
and killed Seo Jaeyoung.

601
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:15,983
Why would we when we didn't kill him?

602
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:19,070
If you don't, you'll all die in here...

CHAEBONG: Try us.

608
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,336
I'm curious how far
Big Mouse's magic can reach.

By the time your curiosity is satisfied,

What did you do in the bathroom?

675
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,510
How did you end up like this? Geez.

(door closes)

681
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:24,977
I don't need an explanation.

682
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:27,354
Just answer my question.

683
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,440
(tense music)

684
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:36,238
MAYOR CHOI:
I realized there were strings tied to me.

685
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:38,198
How long ago...

686
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:42,578
did you start
controlling me like a puppet?

687
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,914
I don't have to answer
if I don't want to, right?

688
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:51,754
Why did you drag me into the mud?

689
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:54,590
I didn't drag you into the mud.

690
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,635
You dragged me into it, Mayor.

691
00:43:58,177 --> 00:43:59,261
(tires screeching)

692
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:01,972
MAYOR CHOI: A righteous lawyer
who fights against Goliath.

693
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,934
It would look good in my opinion.

694
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:08,979
Who are you?

695
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:13,108
MAYOR CHOI: How much of it were lies
and how much of it was planned?

696
00:44:13,525 --> 00:44:15,569
What are you planning
and how far are you taking it?

697
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,446
What's the reason?

698
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:21,784
They think they're predators
as they run at me,

699
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,913
but I'm going to chew them up
and kill them.

700
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:27,998
(music intensifies)

701
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:32,586
I won't be taking any more questions.

702
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:35,172
Now, choose.

703
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:38,676
Will you help me or not?

704
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:49,311
Don't you... feel sorry for Miho?

705
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:52,523
She doesn't realize how pitiful she is

706
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:55,359
and is running around trying to save you.

707
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:57,444
(pensive piano music)

708
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:02,199
Don't cross the line.

709
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:07,121
Don't say a word to Miho.

710
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:09,665
I will...

711
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,418
take care of my wife.

Hello, ma'am.

752
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:29,276
We were out of surgical masks
and alcohol pads.

753
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:34,573
You came all the way here for that
instead of the supply room in the ward?

754
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:35,866
(chuckles)

755
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:39,119
What brings you here?

756
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:44,166
I stopped by the center
and saw you come in here.

757
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:47,794
Then you must've seen
the head nurse come in as well.

758

(suspenseful music)

(door closes)

760
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:01,933
MIHO: She came in and disappeared.

761
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:06,438
I know I saw her come in here.
I don't know what happened.

762
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:07,981
MIHO: If you know...

763
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:10,984
I was watching the security videos...

764
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:12,778
You saw the head nurse, right?

765
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:14,196
She was the only person...

766
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:16,823
that I saw.

767
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:18,658
(scoffs)

768
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:23,622
Wait. Are you saying I followed a ghost?

769
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:26,041
There is one reason why I pay you.

770
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:27,709
It's simple.

771
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:30,545
To look after patients.

772
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:34,341
If you do something unnecessary again,

773
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:38,512
I'll take that nurse's uniform
off of you myself.

How long have you worked here, Mr. Ham?

778
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:12,754
This is my 31st year.

779
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:16,258
I've worked in the supply room
for 24 years.

780
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,970
Don't go inside.

781
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:24,432
MR. HAM: That's the same thing
the previous director said.

782
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:32,566
(music intensifies)

783
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:41,199
DOOGEUN: You don't know how it is here.
Every day is a living hell.

784
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:43,201
We're dying more and more every day.

785
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:44,703
So what?

786
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:49,499
You'll confess to everything at trial
because you're afraid of that punk?

787
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:53,712
We're not saying we'll talk.
We're asking you to save us!

788
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:57,591
How about getting us transferred?
If we go to another detention center...

789
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:58,758
(Jihoon sighs)

790
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:01,386
You know their organization
is spread nationwide.

791
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:03,430
At least you get protected here.

792
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:04,806
Do you wanna die in the gutter?

793
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:08,143
Then we'll get written medical diagnoses,

794
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:09,936
so get us out on medical leave.

795
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,563
Yes. That's a good idea.

796
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:15,483
That means we can get out
immediately, right?

797
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:18,945
That's up to the judge's discretion,
so grease the judges for us.

798
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:21,323
-Come on.
-DOOGEUN: Do it for us.

-DOOGEUN: Come on, man.

802
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,041
-CHAEBONG: Please. Do this for us.
-Let go.

waiting for me?

807
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:54,898
Did you see my wife?

808
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:56,983
Gosh.

809
00:53:57,442 --> 00:54:00,946
She came running
and tattled on me already?

810
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,073
What did you say to her?

811
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:04,366
(inhales sharply)

812
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:06,660
Well, obviously...

813
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:08,578
it wasn't anything pleasant...

814
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:11,831
when everything she does
is annoying as hell.

815
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:15,252
You may be the king in here,

816
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:18,004
but the outside world is my turf.

817
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:22,801
I heard you bothered my friends.

818
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:26,429
Give it a rest, okay?

819
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:28,181
For your wife's sake.

(suspenseful music)

821
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:32,560
It's cheating to mess with family.

822
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:35,063
JIHOON: Cheating?

823

The Manchu Invasion,
the Japanese Invasion,

824

the Civil War, the Korean War...

00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:43,947
There is no such thing as cheating in war.

What is it?

829
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:53,873
JIHOON'S WIFE: Did you send the flowers?

830
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:55,792
What are you talking about?

831
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:57,794
They came in your name.

832
00:54:57,877 --> 00:54:59,921
Why did you send crap like this?

833
00:55:00,505 --> 00:55:03,049
Are you that thoughtless?
I'm throwing them out.

834
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,176
Do whatever you want. Throw them out.

835
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:08,221
Hold on.

836
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:10,849
What was the flower?

837
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:13,893
JIHOON'S WIFE:
Chrysanthemums. White ones, at that.

838
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:17,439
These were meant for a funeral
and you sent them to me by mistake, right?

839
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:19,524
(suspenseful music)

840
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:23,320
(phone beeps)

841
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:29,117
Did you send them?

842
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,746
Did you send my wife...

843
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:34,706
Thirty-four white chrysanthemums.

844
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:37,500
She's 34 years old, right?

845
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:41,004
(exhales)

846
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:50,430
Should we do this without any rules?

847
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:52,599
That's really my forte.

848
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:58,605
(music intensifies)

849
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:06,154
(music stops)

850
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:10,367
Mess with my Miho one more time,

851
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:14,245
and I'll send you
the most heinous gift in the world.

852
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:17,999
(tense music)

853
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:32,055
Where's Chairman Yang?

854
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:34,516
Why do you want to see
Yang Chunsik suddenly?

855
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:36,768
I'll give him whatever he wants.

856
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:39,896
Tell him to kill that bastard.

857
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:45,318
What about the 100 billion won?
Don't you want your money back?

858
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:48,655
(clears throat)

859
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:53,159
(grumbles)

860
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:55,745
(Jihoon mutters)

861
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:05,588
(music fades)

862
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:06,798
(door closes)

863
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:10,301
CHUNSIK: Six.

864
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:13,513
Seven. Eight.

865
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:16,641
Nine. Ten.

866
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:21,271
Boss, Big Mouse is here.

867
00:57:21,354 --> 00:57:22,564
CHUNSIK: What?

868
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:26,067
(groans, grunts)

869
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:30,488
Would you like to have
a deep conversation with me?

870
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:33,867
Everyone out.

871
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:37,704
(ominous music)

872
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:40,457
What did the VIPs give you?

873
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,835
Why do you care to know?

874
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:46,379
I wondered what great thing you got

875
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:48,506
that you're loyal to those bad guys.

876
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:49,924
(laughs)

877
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:51,968
No one here is good.

878
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:54,137
Everyone is a bad guy.

879
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:55,722
(chuckles)

880
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:57,557
You're being released soon, right?

881
00:57:58,224 --> 00:58:00,685
Did they promise you
a business opportunity?

882
00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:01,853
(inhales sharply)

883
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:07,317
If you're going to tell me to betray them,

884
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:09,986
just leave.

885
00:58:14,407 --> 00:58:16,242
I'm here to talk business.

886
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,204
I'm considering investing in you,
Chairman Yang.

887
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:20,455
Investing?

888
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:23,500
How can I trust you?

889
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:27,879
You're getting life at the bare minimum.

890
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:31,049
Want to make a bet?

891
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:34,677
On which of us gets out of here first.

892
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:37,805
(laughing)

893
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:41,851
(tense music)

894
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:51,611
(Dr. Han whistling)

895
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:53,905
(suspenseful music)

896
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:02,080
What are you doing?

897
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:08,002
Where's Chairman Yang?

898
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:11,506
Geez.

899
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:13,841
(music stops)

900
00:59:14,425 --> 00:59:15,468
What is it?

901
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:17,762
INMATE: Stay still. Don't move!

902
00:59:18,346 --> 00:59:19,347
Shut the hell up!

903
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:21,391
Come on.

904
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:22,850
(muttering)

905
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:24,519
(Dr. Han grunts)

906
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:26,771
INMATE: Does that hurt? Does it?

907
00:59:26,854 --> 00:59:29,357
Get up, you punk. Crazy bastard.

908
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,442
(music intensifies)

909
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:33,987
INMATE: Punk, look at you.

910
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:35,405
(muffled screaming)

911
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:37,240
Let go, you bastards!

912
00:59:37,323 --> 00:59:39,492
INMATE: Get up.

913
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:42,537
(screaming)

914
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:47,083
(breathing heavily)

915
00:59:51,629 --> 00:59:53,631
(suspenseful music)

916
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:55,883
(breathing heaviliy)

917
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:01,264
CHANGHO: You know where this is, right?

918
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:05,226
You guys welcomed me
very enthusiastically here.

919
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:08,563
What should I do with you?

920
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:11,316
You guys hung me up here.

921
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:14,944
(ominous music)

922
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:22,327
Please let me go.

923
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:25,163
Please let me go!

924
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:26,247
(sobs)

925
01:00:33,087 --> 01:00:34,547
CHANGHO: That was what I said.

926
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:38,301
(scoffs)

927
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:43,181
I watched the dashcam video from your car.

928
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:45,475
CHANGHO: All you did was drive.

929
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:47,727
Jung Chaebong and Lee Doogeun
killed Seo Jaeyoung.

930
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:51,606
Why are you sharing the crime?

931
01:00:52,273 --> 01:00:55,735
Murder and accessory to murder
are punished differently.

932
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:57,862
You were an accessory.

933
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:00,365
And Gong Jihoon instigated it.

934
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:09,290
Confess...

935
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:11,834
at the trial.

936
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:14,337
(hiccups)

937
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:17,340
(hiccups)

938
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:18,966
Those who killed him can't do it,

939
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:21,010
but you can since you're not as bad.

940
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:23,930
(hiccups)

941
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:25,640
Why can't you answer?

942
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:33,022
Do you refuse?

943
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:36,025
(breathing nervously)

944
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:39,612
Let's hang him.

945
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:42,490
-INMATE 1: Let's hang him.
-INMATE 2: Let's hang him by the neck.

946
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:44,075
DR. HAN (gasps): No.

947
01:01:44,158 --> 01:01:47,578
-INMATE 1: Get up, bastard.
-No! I have to go home.

948
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:49,664
(suspenseful music)

949
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:52,709
(grunting)

950
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:53,918
No...

951
01:01:54,001 --> 01:01:55,920
(chair creaking)

952
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:02,176
DR. HAN: I'll do it.

953
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:04,137
I'll do it.

954
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:07,598
I'll confess, so don't kill me.

955
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:10,810
Please don't kill me.

956
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:15,815
(groaning)

957
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:18,317
(chair creaking)

958
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:19,861
(clanking)

959
01:02:19,944 --> 01:02:21,946
(music intensifies)

960
01:02:23,322 --> 01:02:24,699
(Dr. Han groans)

961
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:32,290
(choking)

962
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,918
(gurgling)

963
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:40,840
(ominous music)

964
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:49,474
(gasps for air)

965
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:51,225
(groans)

966
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:53,686
(coughing)

967
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,897
(gasping)

968
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:57,982
(suspenseful music)

969
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:01,194
You promised...

970
01:03:02,236 --> 01:03:03,446
to confess.

971
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:05,782
(gurgling, breathing shakily)

972
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:15,082
MIHO: You told me to trust you.

973
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:17,502
You told me to leave it to you.

974
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:21,339
But you've been running in place
for days like a hamster.

975
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:23,591
What happened with you?

976
01:03:23,674 --> 01:03:26,260
You said finding mistresses
was your expertise.

977
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:29,263
Did you pay me or something?

978
01:03:29,347 --> 01:03:31,224
Why do you keep complaining to me?

979
01:03:31,849 --> 01:03:35,144
Finding out that Seo Jaeyoung
had a mistress was huge in itself.

980
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:37,980
Hey. Did you find that out? I did.

981
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:40,650
Forget it.
Go into his social media account

982
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:42,527
and find out everything on Seo Jaeyoung.

983
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:45,988
You'll find a lead on that woman,
be it photos or something else.

984
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:49,325
There's nothing to go into.
He didn't do any social media.

985
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:51,786
Darn it.

986
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:56,082
Hey. What about that innovation center

987
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:58,751
that the head nurse disappeared inside of?

988
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:01,212
Security's tight 24 hours a day,

989
01:04:01,295 --> 01:04:02,964
so it's hard to even get in.

990
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:06,342
What if you were to get
the patients' blood...

991
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:08,594
No, right?

992
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:11,180
We may find something
if we analyzed the blood.

993
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:15,476
There are cameras in every room, too.
Or I would've done it by now.

994
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:17,270
MAYOR CHOI DOHA

995
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:20,147

996
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:25,611
Hello, Mayor.

997
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:28,656
MAYOR CHOI:
I'd like to meet. Where are you?

998
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:32,118
(ominous music)

999
01:04:44,463 --> 01:04:45,631
MIHO: Mayor Choi.

1000
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:48,718
Sorry I'm late.

1001
01:04:58,811 --> 01:05:00,271
When I was a child,

1002
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:02,773
my father ran a dye factory.

1003
01:05:05,776 --> 01:05:09,864
A reporter wrote that the factory
dumped toxic waste without authorization.

1004
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:13,367
My father even got arrested for that

1005
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:16,871
and sued the paper and the reporter.

1006
01:05:16,954 --> 01:05:18,247
The result was...

1007
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:20,458
miserable.

1008
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:23,878
Father suffered from an illness
until he died,

1009
01:05:23,961 --> 01:05:28,215
and I decided to become a lawyer
to help people like him who were wronged.

1010
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:30,301
(pensive music)

1011
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:34,639
Sometime after I became a prosecutor,
I ran into our old factory manager

1012
01:05:35,973 --> 01:05:38,142
and heard the truth from him.

1013
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:41,896
It was true that my father

1014
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:44,315
secretly dumped toxic waste.

1015
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:47,109
MAYOR CHOI:
Whenever it rained for three years.

1016
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:51,906
Right then, I thought I was
the most unfortunate person in the world.

1017
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:53,699
But now,

1018
01:05:55,159 --> 01:05:58,079
Miho, you are the most unfortunate person
in the world.

1019
01:05:58,162 --> 01:06:00,164
(ominous music)

1020
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:05,378
Park Changho...

1021
01:06:07,713 --> 01:06:09,048
He's Big Mouse.

1022
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:11,842
(suspenseful music)

1023
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:15,304
MAYOR CHOI: You're being fooled
just as I was fooled by my father.

1024
01:06:17,056 --> 01:06:19,058
(tense music)

1025
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:23,521
(scoffs)

1026
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:27,108
Not you too.

1027
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:29,068
Changho is pretending...

1028
01:06:29,151 --> 01:06:31,362
I gave him a fake list of names.

1029
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,783
MAYOR CHOI: Park Changho knew
the real names of the druggies

1030
01:06:35,866 --> 01:06:37,952
that only Big Mouse knew.

1031
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:39,787
(gasps)

1032
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:41,789
The witness who knew
what Big Mouse looked like

1033
01:06:41,872 --> 01:06:44,500
was poisoned to death
during the interrogation with Changho.

1034
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:47,962
Everyone who had gone against him
in the penitentiary mysteriously...

1035
01:06:48,045 --> 01:06:49,171
MIHO: Stop it.

1036
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:54,301
I don't care what you say.
I trust my husband.

1037
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:56,971
He said he was Big Mouse.

1038
01:06:59,223 --> 01:07:00,933
He told me not to tell you.

1039
01:07:01,892 --> 01:07:03,894
(tense music)

1040
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:23,539
I'm leaving.

1041
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:49,231
(sighs)

1042
01:07:52,651 --> 01:07:54,653
(music intensifies)

1043
01:07:58,866 --> 01:07:59,909
(exhales)

1044
01:08:03,996 --> 01:08:05,998
(music stops)

1045
01:08:06,832 --> 01:08:09,210
(phone vibrating)

1046
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:11,504
(sighs)

1047
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:13,130
(sniffles)
Hey.

1048
01:08:13,214 --> 01:08:15,132
MIHO'S FATHER: The loan shark called.

1049
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:18,552
Changho paid off his debt
of over 100 million won in cash.

1050
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:21,597
Where do you think he got the money?

1051
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:23,349
Have you heard anything?

1052
01:08:24,266 --> 01:08:25,643
(breathes heavily)

1053
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:28,521
Let's talk when I get home, Dad.

1054
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:30,731
(solemn music)

1055
01:08:30,815 --> 01:08:31,899
(phone beeps)

1056
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:35,861
(sobs softly)

1057
01:08:43,577 --> 01:08:46,247
(sobbing)

1058
01:08:50,751 --> 01:08:52,419
(sobbing)

1059
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:54,505
(solemn music)

1060
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:10,104
(music fades)

1061
01:09:10,187 --> 01:09:14,483
(sobbing continues)

1062
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:21,115
BIG MOUTH

1063
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:23,200
(closing theme music)

1064
01:09:38,674 --> 01:09:40,593
CONFESSIONAL
BIBLE

1065
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:43,971
BIG MOUTH

1066
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:46,932
CHANGHO:
All sorts of garbage are gathered here.

1067
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:48,684
Do you know who's the worst of them?

1068
01:09:48,767 --> 01:09:49,602
Traitors.

1069
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:51,353
WOMAN: Are you looking
for Professor Seo's paper?

1070
01:09:51,437 --> 01:09:52,688
(glass shatters)

1071
01:09:52,771 --> 01:09:53,898
CHANGHO: Watch your mouth

1072
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:55,566
-if you don't want to die.
-JERRY: Boss!

1073
01:09:55,649 --> 01:09:56,984
I found Professor Seo's paper.

1074
01:09:57,067 --> 01:09:58,569
JIHOON: Tell me.

1075
01:09:58,652 --> 01:10:01,488
What do I have to do to get it?

1076
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:04,200
The moment you lie, it's over between us.

1077
01:10:04,283 --> 01:10:05,492
-MIHO: Are you really Big Mouse?
-Hey.

1078
01:10:06,243 --> 01:10:09,413
CHANGHO: Forget everything from today
if you want to live.

1079
01:10:09,496 --> 01:10:11,498
(tense music)
