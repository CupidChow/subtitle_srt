I won't eat! I won't!

40
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,900
You can't let him sleep either.

41
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:56,486
You must wait
until he's completely out of it.

42
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,113

It's a type of truth serum.

Truth serum?

46
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:11,209
He'll tell us everything
without even realizing what he's saying.

47
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:17,548
But I heard truth serums
aren't 100 percent effective.

48
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,008
He won't be able to stop himself.

I brought you

57
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:07,140

58
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:09,892

many people will be at peace.

That's why this is called "Peace."

62
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:25,700
Peace.

63
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,786

JIHOON: Hey.

88
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,395
Can we question him like this?

89
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:20,815
PROSECUTOR: Try it.
He'll answer all of your questions.

(Jihoon mutters)

91
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,069
Hey, Big Mouse.

92
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:31,993
JIHOON: Where did you hide the money
that you took?

93
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,289
I don't know.

94
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,168
JIHOON: What? He doesn't know?

95
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,130
You took 100 billion won.

96
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,177
I don't know.

97
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:55,016
JIHOON: What's going on? He's lying to us.

98
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,392
PROSECUTOR: There's no way.

99
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:03,274
Hey. Are you Big Mouse?

100
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:07,111
Are you Big Mouse, you jerk?

101
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,116
I'm not Big Mouse.

102
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,206
He's lying.

103
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,458
He's saying he's not Big Mouse!

104
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,542
If Peace doesn't work,

105
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,545
his mental strength
is beyond what's humanly possible.

106
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,923
(exhales heavily)

107
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,342
Inject more of that truth serum.

108
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:32,553
If you use this again within 24 hours,
he could die of cardiac arrest.

109
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,472
It doesn't matter, so inject him with it.

110
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,724
He can really die.
Don't you want your money back?

111
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,976
(suspenseful music)

112
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,020
I'm doing this to get it back.

113
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:48,027
JIHOON: If I don't get that money back,
I'll be ousted from the industry.

114
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:49,904
PROSECUTOR: Hold on.

115
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,493
He blacked out.

116
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,290

120
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,718
Big Mouse, you little bastard!
Don't pull a trick!

121
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,387
Wake up!

CHANGHO: There's a pivotal moment

125

A moment that changes their life.

126
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:49,380
A moment

127
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,341
they want to go back to before they die.

128

MIHO'S FATHER: Why you little punks...

131
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,523
You guys are the troublemakers
of Gucheon High School.

132
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:11,485
Come forward for a noogie. Come on.

133
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,780
You guys are students.

134
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,699
Yet instead of studying,

135
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,826
you guys are fighting.

136

(exclaims)

137

-MIHO'S FATHER: Why you...
-Hello.

139
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:26,917
CHANGHO: I didn't hit them.
I just avoided them.

140
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,378
They fell while making a fuss
on their own.

141
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,464
BOY: You hit us first.

142
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:32,882
He's an athlete.

143
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,510
You're from Daehan Orphanage.

144
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:38,804
I don't get into fights.

145
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,140
I don't want kids from my orphanage
to get a bad name.

146
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,019
MIHO: Dad.

147
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:47,813
Hey, you're here. Leave the lunchbox.

148
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,691
I saw them fight.

149
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,444
They were trying to pick a fight,
and they just fell.

150
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,112
-MIHO'S FATHER: You saw them?
-MIHO: Yes.

151
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:57,907
-Get up, Changho.
-You know him?

152
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,159
He's my best friend.
Can I take him with me?

153
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:02,662
MIHO'S FATHER: You just transferred.
How do you already have a best friend?

154
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,997
I got close with him.
I'll take him with me.

155
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,125
-MIHO: Bye.
-MIHO'S FATHER: Hey, Miho.

156

00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,801
It's still warm. Eat some.

(dramatic music)

159
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:20,721
How did you know my name?

160
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,224
It's right there.

161
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:24,308
(mutters)

162
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,689
I made this lunchbox. Taste it.

163
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,441
Are you really a witness?

164
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:36,320
No. But I saw them take money
from kids in front of school.

165
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:39,657
Are you interested in me?

166
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,495
My mom passed away, too.

167
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:46,664
(clears throat)

168
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:49,083
CHANGHO: You feel bad for me

Not really.

-Hey, don't eat it.
-Come on.

175
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:13,607
Hey. You can't take it back. That's cheap.

You're more hotheaded than you look.

177

You said it wasn't good. Don't eat it.

178
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:20,656
It's time to eat, so I'm eating it.

179

Is it good?

CHANGHO: It was the first time
I ate a lunchbox made by someone else.

183

It was the first time
someone took my side.

184
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,215
The moment I first met Miho.

why am I saying this stuff?

Hey. Is your ankle okay?

Why did you run around so carelessly?
You're not a kid.

225

You're in your 30s now.

Gosh. What's so embarrassing?

229

Dig.

Me?

00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,690
Then should I dig?

You're not asking me, are you?

244
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:49,698
That's why I told you to bring
some of the boys.

If we find the gold,

Okay. Fine.
I'll give you three billion won.

264

Use the rest of the Peace on him.

338
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,525
You can't make me talk with that.

339
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,862
-Really?
-I showed you the money.

340
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:41,740
You're just going to have a taste
and not look for the rest?

Hey. Get me some sushi.
With fish that's in season.

-So...

00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:19,851
Really? Okay. I'll go there.

Hey. I'm hanging up now.

427

I'm hanging up too.

We're almost there. Okay.

440
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,452
Jang Hyejin threw out the paper?

441
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,538
If she did,
she would've thrown out the necklace.

She's refusing to talk.

When you went to visit your husband...

I'm really fine.

Don't worry about it.

487
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:50,770
Did you get rid of Professor Seo's paper
to save your husband?

(exhales)

489
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:54,607
Can you please stop harassing me?

490
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:57,152
Why can't you divorce him
despite getting abused?

...who loves me as much as he does.

496
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,413
(whimpers)

497
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:10,206
Hey! Seriously?

498
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,708
-(glass shatters)
-Damn it!

499
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,168
DR. HAN: I'll make you human today.

00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:16,504
(music intensifies)

501
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:19,215
(suspenseful music)

502
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:23,303
Don't make my husband out
to be a bad person.

503
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:25,472
You can't escape him out of fear.

504
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:27,015
Not because of his love.

505
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,522
We'll help you.

506
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,191
You can start anew...

507
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,859
Even if you do this, I can't help you.

508
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:41,905
I won't stand in my husband's trial

509
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:43,990
as a witness either.

510
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,081
-(device beeps)
-(Juhee groans)

511
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:55,502
I told you you can't be stressed.

512
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,420
I can't find a proper vessel.

513
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:02,258
ELDER: I need someone
to take over my business.

514
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:06,054
Anyone who looks good
on paper isn't capable.

515
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,931
And if they seem to be broad-minded,

516
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:10,600
they don't meet my standards.

517
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:13,394
Which one is my husband?

518
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,190
(strap screeches)

519
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,276
JUHEE: You acknowledged
his capabilities already.

520
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:24,405
Does he not meet your standards?

521
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,534
How long will you run your hospital?

522
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,619
What do you mean?

523
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:31,496
Can you put your interest in my business

524
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,749
instead of your husband?

525
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,043
(chuckles)

526
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:43,049
I just want to take care of patients
for the rest of my life.

527
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:46,886
(suspenseful music)

(door opens)

529
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,067
How is he?

530
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,282
Stay by the elder's side tonight.

531
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:11,077
-Juhee.
-Nothing critical will happen.

532
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,745
Just be there to talk with him.

533
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:24,465

There's a fire here!

What? You already left?

558
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:07,879
Who reported it?

559
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:11,174
-FIREMAN 1: Everyone out!
-FIREMAN 2: There's a fire.

Park Changho, that rat.

Aren't you going to tell me?

JERRY: Get off.

645
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:56,876
By myself? What about you?

646
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:59,462
If you go under that bridge,
there will be a black car.

647
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:01,172
Take that and run away.

648
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:05,968
If you're going to lure them, don't.

649
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:10,264
I'm the reason you got a stomachache.

650
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,935
If this is because you feel bad...

651
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,562
Big Mouse paid me.

652
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,315
Did you meet Big Mouse?

00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:29,658
I'll see you later.

656
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:31,786
Thank you.

657
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:33,662

Yes, this is the cancer ward.

00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:51,258
(sighs)
Is Ms. Ko Miho there?

695
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,177
She took the day off today.

696
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,471
NURSE: Should I leave a memo for you?

697
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:56,680
No, it's okay.

CHANGHO:
Jang Hyejin has Seo Jaeyoung's paper.

700
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:03,229
ESTABLISHING LAW AND ORDER

701
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:04,897
SOONTAE: She's gone off the grid.

702
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:08,150
We're looking for her,
so we'll get the paper soon enough.

00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,196

00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:42,661
Park Changho was never in that car.

708
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:45,581
That punk ate sushi and ran away.

709
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:48,500
(inhales deeply, exhales)

710
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:51,378
Put out a public search for a fugitive.

711
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:53,172
We should do that.

712
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:55,633

MIHO: Look at this.

717
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:19,448
What you're doing is a crime.

718
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:22,409
How long will you lock me up in here?

719
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:26,080
If you don't change your mind
after looking at this, I'll let you go.

720
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,666
The choice is yours.

721
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:30,876
Will you live your life running away,

722
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,003
or will you fight and get a new life?

723
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:52,439

WHO KILLED SEO JAEYOUNG?

726

MAN (on video): There is a dead person,

727
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:06,829
but nobody who killed him.

728
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:09,164
The Murder of Gucheon Hospital's
Professor Seo Jaeyoung.

729
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:11,834
Please be excited for this week's
News Mental Live.

730
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:14,169
An incredible informant

731
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:16,797
will disclose a shocking truth.

732
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,133
For a world where justice is served,

733
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:21,885
News Mental
will dig into it until the end.

734
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:26,765
You said they have
800,000 subscribers, right?

735
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:29,059
-If this goes viral...
-(line dialing)

736
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:30,769
...then it'll be amazing.

737
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:33,272
SOONTAE: Yes, we saw the video.

738
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:35,232
I think you can upload it as is.

739
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:38,026
Are you really not going to tell us
who the informant is?

740
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:40,904
I told you it's confidential.

741
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,282
Please understand that.

742
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:46,160
Yes, I'll see you during the livestream.

743
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:48,662
(phone beeps)

744
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:51,874
Do you think you can persuade Jang Hyejin?

745
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:54,418
We have to wait and see.

746
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:56,795
My goodness.

747
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:58,297
(remote clicks)

748
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,550
MAN: Big Mouse, Park Changho, who
was incarcerated at a detention center,

749
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:03,719
-escaped this afternoon.
-MIHO'S FATHER: Isn't that Changho?

750
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:06,638
Park was admitted to a mental hospital
in Gyeonggi Province

751
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:08,015
for sick bail when he escaped.

752
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:09,850
Authorities have put out a public search

753
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:11,810
with a reward for 50 million won.

754
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:13,520
MIHO'S FATHER: What is he saying?

755
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:16,356
-Changho escaped.
-There was a huge fire in said hospital,

756
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,817
so it's presumed that Big Mouse
purposely set the fire

757
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:21,403
and used the commotion to escape.

758
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:23,697
-Since a big-name criminal escape...
-(Chunsik sighs)

759
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:26,450
I was wondering what he meant when he said

760
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:28,160
he'd get out before me.

761
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:31,413
Boss, I never imagined he would escape.

762
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:34,416
That is what true guts look like.

763
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,376
CHUNSIK: Learn what you can.

764
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,587
That's how a person progresses.

765
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,923
Authorities say he's over 180cm tall...

766
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:44,051
Warden Park, the news...

767
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:47,513
What can we do if he escaped
while he was outside?

768
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:50,307
It's not our responsibility,
so don't worry about it.

769
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:53,519
You really don't think
you'll end up being blamed?

770
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:57,147
Hurry up and play. Stop stalling.

771
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,233
Seeing as to how his family
can't be reached,

772
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:01,568
-Should I kill this one?
-...there's a high chance

773
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:02,861
they're hiding him...

774
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:05,864
Should I let this live?

775
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:09,618
DR. HAN:
You said Park Changho's going to die.

776
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:12,579
Why did you even bother getting me out?
You should've left me in there.

777
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:13,664
CHAEBONG: Darn it.

778
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,917
I think we made a huge mistake.

779
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,169
DOOGEUN: We let a lion run loose.

780
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:21,380
He was running things in prison.

781
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:24,424
-What if he comes to kill us?
-(sighs)

782
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:27,344
I should've put you guys
in the mental hospital.

783
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:30,430
PROSECUTOR: Ko Miho's cellphone is off.

784
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,809
His father-in-law and Kim Soontae
are missing too.

785
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:38,897
That means it's highly likely
that he contacted them. Right?

786
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:41,567
The police have opened a search
for those three too,

787
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:42,943
so they won't hold out for long.

788
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:45,112
(upbeat music)

789
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,405
(Chaebong groans)

790
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:48,866
Damn it.

791
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:51,451
MAN (over radio):
The police are adding forces

792
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:54,121
to focus all their energy
in finding Big Mouse.

793
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:57,165
All highways going through
the metropolitan area

794
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:59,126
have inspection stations,

795
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,919
and with people commuting home,

796
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:03,547
-there is extreme traffic.
-(phone vibrates)

797

Please turn the interior light on.

810
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,308
Can you look here? Don't frown.

811

820
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:05,979
Big Mouse paid me.

821
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:08,857
I'm sorry.

822
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,735
(siren wailing)

823
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:25,540
CHANGHO: I won't be as pathetic as Jerry.

824
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:30,295
I won't die like that after being used.

825
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:33,673
Thank you for verifying

826
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,595
that you're truly the bad guy, Big Mouse.

827

I'll be waiting for your call.

831
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:07,415
(footsteps)

832
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:11,962
(car door closes)

833
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:15,423
(ominous music)

834
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:24,474
(engine starts)

835
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:27,561
I don't know
if we're doing the right thing.

836
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:30,355
MIHO'S FATHER:
Do you think we're making a mistake?

837
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:34,276
From where she stands,
she won't be able to refuse our offer.

838
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:40,240
By the way, we did what you said
and we turned off our phones,

839
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:42,325
but then Changho can't reach us.

840
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:46,163
Without Changho, our plan is useless.

841
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:49,207
I know.
The police will definitely look for us,

842
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:51,877
but it's not like we can keep hiding out.

843
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:56,840
-What is it? Do you have a good idea...
-Hold on.

844
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:59,092
Why? Tell us. It might help to talk...

845
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:00,635
Hold on.

846
00:53:01,636 --> 00:53:04,723
A way to avoid the police following us
while meeting Changho.

847
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:07,601
I think we can come up with something.

848
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:10,395
JIHOON: Memorize it.

849
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:13,732
It's the prosecution's argument
and the judge's expected questions.

850
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:17,694
We already filled out the answer sheet,
so why would we do this too?

851
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:19,237
Get your stories straight.

852
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:21,031
-Don't mess up in court.
-(phone vibrating)

853
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:22,365
PROSECUTOR CHOI JOONGRAK

854
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:24,659
Yes, Prosecutor Choi.

855
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:27,204
Ko Miho turned her phone on.

856
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:29,289
(ominous music)

857
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:31,875
Where are they?

858
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:35,170
The police are locating her,
so we'll find out soon.

859
00:53:35,253 --> 00:53:37,714
It's highly likely
that Park Changho's with her.

860
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:40,592
Don't worry.
I'm going to go with the police...

861
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:43,345
SOONTAE (over megaphone):
His wife, Ko Miho, saw it herself.

862
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:45,847
Park Changho
escaped from a mental hospital?

863
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:47,557
This doesn't make any sense.

864
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:50,644
-WOMAN: Right. This must be true.
-Until they investigate his abduction...

865
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:52,562
JIHOON: What's wrong? Hello?
Prosecutor Choi.

866
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:53,939
I'll call you back.

867
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:57,067
MIHO'S FATHER: Everyone!
This is Prosecutor Choi Joongrak!

868
00:53:57,150 --> 00:54:00,528
-WOMAN: That's Prosecutor Choi Joongrak.
-MAN: That's the prosecutor?

869
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:03,281
-Prosecutor Choi, can you confirm this?
-Stop taking photos.

870
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:05,700
It wasn't a jailbreak,
it was an abduction.

871
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:08,078
Find out who abducted him and why.

872
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:11,915
If the prosecution announces
it's an abduction case, you can find him.

873
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:13,583
Come to your senses.

874
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:16,711
Does this look like an issue
that can be resolved by throwing a fit?

875
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:18,964
As long as I could find my husband,
I will cooperate.

876
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:20,757
PROSECUTOR: You'll cooperate?

877
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:24,135
Can you submit your cell phones?

878
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:26,221
(cameras clicking)

879
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:28,014
Here.

880
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:30,183
Dad, give him yours too.

881
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,643
Okay.

882
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:33,812
MIHO'S FATHER: Here.

883
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:37,148
I'm his attorney.
You can look at mine too.

884
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:40,443
Get Forensics to look into
their call history and emails.

885
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:42,988
Since we cooperated,
will you listen to our demands?

886
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:46,408
(tense music)

887
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:48,785
CLAIMS THAT BIG MOUSE DIDN'T ESCAPE
BUT WAS ABDUCTED

888
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:50,203
REVEAL THE TRUTH ABOUT
SEO'S MURDER

889
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:57,711
BIG MOUSE'S WIFE DOING A FASTING
DEMONSTRATION AT GUCHEON PROSECUTION

890
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:03,925
REVEAL THE TRUTH

891
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:11,099
MIHO'S FATHER: No. Let go of me!

892
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:13,893
Prosecutor Choi. You shouldn't do this!

893
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:15,770
You said you'd listen to us
if we cooperated.

894
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:18,023
Park Changho didn't escape.
He was abducted.

895
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:20,108
MIHO'S FATHER:
The prosecution is trying to hide it!

896
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:21,401
Don't let just anybody in.

897
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:29,075
(knocks on door)

898
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:30,452
Yes?

899
00:55:30,535 --> 00:55:31,911
PARK CHANGHO DIDN'T ESCAPE

900
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:35,248
Prosecutor Choi? He didn't escape.
He was abducted.

901
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:36,916
SOONTAE: Keep your promise.

902
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,752
Didn't you look at our cell phones?

903
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:40,879
MIHO'S FATHER: He hasn't called us at all.

904
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:42,047
What's the point?

905
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:43,840
-(knocks on door)
-Don't you agree, Prosecutor Choi?

906
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:45,300
SOONTAE:
He didn't escape. He was abducted.

907
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:48,094
-(knocking continues)
-SOONTAE: Prosecutor Choi?

908
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:51,306
Change the direction of the investigation
and find Park Changho.

909
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:54,017
(upbeat music)

910
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:56,561
PARK CHANGHO DIDN'T ESCAPE
HE WAS ABDUCTED

911
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:58,646
How can you eat right now?

912
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:00,106
Park Changho was abducted!

913
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,400
-Listen! He didn't escape!
-Change the investigation!

914
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:04,361
MIHO'S FATHER: You shouldn't do this!

915
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:06,780
Where are you going instead of eating?
Choi Joongrak!

916
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,742
JIHOON: There was no point of contact?

917
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:14,662
We looked through the call history,
emails, and phones

918
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:17,082
of Ko Miho, Ko Kikwang,
and even Kim Soontae,

919
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:18,750
but they never contacted Park Changho.

920
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:20,919
Do you think he already left the country?

921
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:24,422
The police blocked that first,
so he's in Korea.

922
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:27,425
(exhales heavily)

923
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:32,097
I have a bad feeling about this.

924
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:36,768
I hate that they're causing a public scene
in front of the Prosecutors' Office too.

925
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:38,561
Do you know how many people
are staking out

926
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:40,188
and how many cameras there are?

927
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:45,235
If he shows even a single hair,
Big Mouse will be done for.

928
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:49,614
PARK CHANGHO DIDN'T ESCAPE
HE WAS ABDUCTED

929
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:52,200
(tense music)

930
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,471
PARK CHANGHO'S BEING UNFAIRLY CHARGED

931
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:20,186
(tense music)

932
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:38,121
REVEAL THE TRUTH!

933
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:41,249
(music stops)

934
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:44,335
Don't they ever eat?

935
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:47,589
Did Changho call?

936
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:50,925
No. This is a huge problem.

937
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:53,219
The trial is tomorrow,
so I need to see him today.

938
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:56,264
You said Changho knows
the number to your burner phone.

939
00:57:57,182 --> 00:58:00,768
You said that Changho was smart
and would remember my number.

940
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:02,896
Why do you keep getting mad at me?

941
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:05,899
My goodness.

942
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:07,734
MIHO: Did he call?

943
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:11,279
SOONTAE: No.
You should go in and get some rest.

944
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:13,823
I'll just stay here.

945
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:20,622
My gosh. Why would they run an ad
for insurance all day?

946
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:32,175
YOU'RE THE RECIPIENT OF MY INSURANCE.
LET'S GET MARRIED.

947
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:34,427
ARE YOU PROPOSING TO ME WITH INSURANCE?

948
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,638
I WILL LET YOU LIVE THE GOOD LIFE.

949
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:39,557
(pensive music)

950
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:40,767
CHANGHO: Let's get married.

951
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:45,772
Are you proposing to me

952
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:47,899
with the insurance
I don't know when I'll get?

953
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:51,528
I will let you live the good life.

954
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:54,155
(exhales, sniffles)

955
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:58,993
Can you give me your phone?

956
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:02,497
(pensive music)

957
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:06,376
MY HUSBAND ISN'T BIG MOUSE

958
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:08,836
PROPOSE WITH INSURANCE

959
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,255
CONSULTATION NUMBER
010-738-8519

960
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:12,590
(keypad clacking)

961
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:14,801
(line ringing)

962
00:59:16,594 --> 00:59:17,762
CHANGHO: Miho.

963
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:21,558
(sobs)

964
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:24,185
CHANGHO: It's been hard. Right?

965
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:27,146
It's harder for you.

966
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,356
Where are you?

967
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:31,109
The clock tower next to the ad.

968
00:59:31,192 --> 00:59:33,945
PARK CHANGHO'S BEING UNFAIRLY CHARGED

969
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:40,076
(sniffles)

970
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:42,120
Were you abducted by them?

971
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:44,455
Yes.

972
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:49,460
I'm here now,
so you don't have to worry anymore.

973
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:53,673
(sniffles)

974
00:59:54,507 --> 00:59:56,968
Jang Hyejin agreed to help us.

975
00:59:58,553 --> 01:00:00,054
Give me her number.

976
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:02,724
I'll control everything from now on.

977
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:06,144
(pensive music)

978
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:20,658
The call is taking a long time.

979
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:22,702
This isn't an ordinary strategy.

980
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:25,955
One small mistake,
and it all comes falling down.

981
01:00:27,415 --> 01:00:30,043
You're right. We have to be careful.

982
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:36,132
(phone beeps)

983
01:00:36,215 --> 01:00:37,300
(Changho exhales)

984
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:44,223
THE THREE SUSPECTS
ARRESTED AT THE SCENE

985
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:46,267
For a world where justice is served,

986
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:47,769
-News Mental...
-Darn it.

987
01:00:47,852 --> 01:00:50,021
-We're in trouble.
-...will dig into it until the end.

988
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:53,524
(Chaebong sighs)

989
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:55,276
Hey. Mr. Gong.

990
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,071
Look at this.

991
01:00:58,655 --> 01:00:59,906
JIHOON: What is this?

992
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:01,407
It's a video reporting a case,

993
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:03,159
and they're doing our case today.

994
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:07,705
-So?
-What do you mean, so?

995
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:09,957
They're saying an informant
is coming on today!

996
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:13,628
JIHOON: Gosh. There are still idiots
who believe in this stuff.

997
01:01:13,711 --> 01:01:14,879
(exclaims)

998
01:01:14,962 --> 01:01:17,173
That's probably why these guys
can make a living. Right?

999
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:21,094
Hey. Do you know how much fake news
comes out of things like this

1000
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:22,345
every day?

1001
01:01:22,428 --> 01:01:23,638
My gosh.

1002
01:01:23,721 --> 01:01:25,932
It's almost time.

1003
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:27,809
-(phone vibrating)
-CHAEBONG: Let's get ready to go to court.

1004
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:30,269
DR. HAN: Right. Let's get ready.

1005
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:32,814
Hello?

1006
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:34,065
It's Jang Hyejin.

1007
01:01:34,899 --> 01:01:37,235
Hyejin, why are you calling me?

1008
01:01:37,318 --> 01:01:38,736
Hyejin?

1009
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:40,363
Do you want me to put Dr. Han on?

1010
01:01:40,446 --> 01:01:42,824
He's really anxious
because he can't reach you.

1011
01:01:42,907 --> 01:01:43,991
-(Jihoon laughs)
-Give me the phone.

1012
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:45,785
I have...

1013
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:48,037
Professor Seo's paper.

1014
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:49,706
Give me the phone!

1015
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:52,542
DR. HAN: Give me the phone...

1016
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:55,503
Stay still, you idiot.

1017
01:01:55,586 --> 01:01:57,880
(ominous music)

1018
01:02:01,592 --> 01:02:02,760
And?

1019
01:02:07,598 --> 01:02:11,352
What do you want me to do with this?

1020
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:15,773
You must want something
considering the fact that you called me.

1021
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:17,567
Tell me.

1022
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:21,446
What must I do to get it?

1023
01:02:22,488 --> 01:02:26,325
Get me divorce papers from my husband.

1024
01:02:30,663 --> 01:02:32,582
I'll trade it with this paper.

1025
01:02:33,207 --> 01:02:34,208
(sucks teeth)

1026
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:37,754
Conflict between a couple
is the hardest issue to deal with.

1027
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:40,131
Furthermore, it's not my family.

1028
01:02:41,382 --> 01:02:43,593
If you refuse,
I'm going to give the paper...

1029
01:02:45,344 --> 01:02:47,096
to Big Mouse.

1030
01:02:49,348 --> 01:02:50,892
Did you meet that jerk?

1031
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:55,938
I'll send you the paperwork,
so get my husband to sign them.

1032
01:02:56,814 --> 01:02:58,357
I'll call you again.

1033
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:00,443
(ominous music)

1034
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:05,406
Why? What did Hyejin say?

1035
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:06,991
(phone vibrates)

1036
01:03:07,074 --> 01:03:08,367
What is it?

1037
01:03:09,702 --> 01:03:14,165
DIVORCE AGREEMENT

1038
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:28,012
(tense music)

1039
01:03:43,444 --> 01:03:47,990
Dogok-dong apartment,
Hongdae commercial building...

1040
01:03:49,283 --> 01:03:50,618
DIVORCE AGREEMENT

1041
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:52,662
...two billion won for alimony.

1042
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:59,627
CHAEBONG:
She wants to take every asset you own.

1043
01:04:00,461 --> 01:04:01,921
I won't divorce her.

1044
01:04:04,924 --> 01:04:06,467
I can't.

1045
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:08,678
If you can't?

1046
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:11,764
You don't care if Seo Jaeyoung's paper

1047
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:14,684
ends up in Big Mouse's hand or not?

1048
01:04:14,767 --> 01:04:16,727
How did my wife...

1049
01:04:21,065 --> 01:04:25,820
know Seo Jaeyoung to have his paper?

1050
01:04:25,903 --> 01:04:29,407
She's lying
to get the divorce papers signed.

1051
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:31,200
(exhales, inhales deeply)

1052
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:32,869
That's why...

1053
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:35,955
she's saying

1054
01:04:37,248 --> 01:04:41,377
she'll trade them for the divorce papers!

1055
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:43,462
(ominous music)

1056
01:04:47,341 --> 01:04:50,845
If the paper gets out,
it'll affect the elder directly.

1057
01:04:51,929 --> 01:04:53,514
Can you handle the aftermath?

1058
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:58,477
(Jihoon laughs)

1059
01:04:59,604 --> 01:05:00,730
Hey, Han Jaeho.

1060
01:05:01,772 --> 01:05:04,442
-Han Jaeho!
-CHAEBONG: Hey, Mr. Gong. Calm down.

1061
01:05:04,525 --> 01:05:08,112
I'll calm him down,
so you should calm down too.

1062
01:05:08,195 --> 01:05:11,449
-(glass shatters)
-What the... Hey, Dr. Han!

1063
01:05:11,532 --> 01:05:12,992
CHAEBONG: Dr. Han!

1064
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:15,244
(Dr. Han screams)

1065
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:17,038
CHAEBONG: Dr. Han. Are you okay?

1066
01:05:17,121 --> 01:05:20,124
-My gosh. Look at the blood!
-What did you do?

1067
01:05:20,499 --> 01:05:24,128
Damn. I can't give up on Hyejin.

1068
01:05:24,962 --> 01:05:26,631
DR. HAN: I won't divorce!

1069
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:30,051
-Darn it. Let go of me!
-CHAEBONG: Hey!

1070
01:05:30,134 --> 01:05:33,137
-Calm down. Please.
-DR. HAN: Let go of me! Darn it!

1071
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:35,222
(ominous music)

1072
01:05:40,227 --> 01:05:42,980
CHANGHO: Do you know
where the perfect place to hide lies is?

1073
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:45,191
The truth.

1074
01:05:48,194 --> 01:05:51,614
You get confused about what is the truth
and what are lies.

1075
01:05:51,697 --> 01:05:53,699
(suspenseful music)

1076
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:57,328
Hello, I'm Producer Na from News Mental.

1077
01:05:57,411 --> 01:05:58,496
Please take good care of us.

1078
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:02,625
CHANGHO: In the end,
people choose lies that sound true.

1079
01:06:06,587 --> 01:06:09,715
I will judge you on your crimes,

1080
01:06:10,424 --> 01:06:11,550
instead of a judge.

1081
01:06:12,551 --> 01:06:14,053
You bastards.

1082
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:16,138
(tense music)

1083
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:23,145
-They're here!
-Get ready!

1084
01:06:29,777 --> 01:06:32,488
-Hello.
-What do you think of the trial?

1085
01:06:32,571 --> 01:06:34,156
Do you admit to your crimes?

1086
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:37,118
-GUARD: Please step back.
-Give us a statement.

1087
01:06:37,201 --> 01:06:38,953
-Did you do it?
-Can you give us a word?

1088
01:06:39,036 --> 01:06:40,204
REPORTER: Do you admit to your charges?

1089
01:06:40,287 --> 01:06:43,082
You will be representing yourself
as one of the defendants.

1090
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:44,625
Will you plead not guilty again?

1091
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:45,835
Of course.

1092
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:48,671
I will put my honor on the line

1093
01:06:48,754 --> 01:06:51,465
as a lawyer and as the person involved,
who knows this case best.

1094
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:55,177
Okay. We'll finish the interview
after the trial.

1095
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:57,638
-Hold on.
-Can you say something more?

1096
01:06:57,722 --> 01:06:59,890
-Please tell us more!
-Say another word.

1097
01:06:59,974 --> 01:07:02,143
-What will you say in court?
-Give us another statement!

1098
01:07:02,226 --> 01:07:04,145
What will you say?

1099
01:07:04,228 --> 01:07:05,896
JIHOON: What are you doing here,
Mayor Choi?

1100
01:07:08,065 --> 01:07:10,443
The elder is very angry.

1101
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:13,154
He says you're the one
who released Big Mouse.

1102
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:17,950
Why would you say that now? How annoying.

1103
01:07:18,617 --> 01:07:21,662
Oh, right. You were close
with Seo Jaeyoung. Right?

1104
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:23,122
Fairly close.

1105
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:26,751
What was his relationship
with Jang Hyejin?

1106
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:29,003
What do you mean?

1107
01:07:30,963 --> 01:07:31,964
Never mind.

1108
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:34,050
Professor Seo's paper...

1109
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:37,845
Does Hyejin have it?

1110
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:46,395
Right? She has that paper.

1111
01:07:47,688 --> 01:07:48,856
(scoffs)

1112
01:07:48,939 --> 01:07:51,150
(tense music)

1113
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:53,944
I acknowledge you
for picking up on things quickly,

1114
01:07:54,987 --> 01:07:56,864
but you should watch where you lie.

1115
01:07:56,947 --> 01:07:58,949
JIHOON: Don't get involved
when it's not your place.

1116
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:02,161
♪ Know your place ♪

1117
01:08:02,661 --> 01:08:04,371
♪ Know your place ♪

1118
01:08:07,124 --> 01:08:09,126
(tense music)

1119
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:19,637
Gong Jihoon knows
that Professor Jang has the paper.

1120
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:28,729
(crowd murmuring)

1121
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:30,940
DEFENDANT

1122
01:08:37,029 --> 01:08:39,240

01:08:57,550 --> 01:08:59,468

Please have a seat.

1125
01:09:07,893 --> 01:09:10,062
PRODUCER NA:
For a world where justice is served.

1126
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:13,899
Hello. I'm Producer Na.

1127
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:17,236
Today, we will be looking into
the murder of Seo Jaeyoung.

1128
01:09:17,778 --> 01:09:19,405
As I notified you previously,

1129
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:23,075
we have an incredible informant
here with us.

1130
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:25,161
(suspenseful music)

1131
01:09:25,244 --> 01:09:27,913
(footsteps)

1132
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:34,128
IS THE TRIO THE CULPRIT?

1133
01:09:34,211 --> 01:09:35,337
WHEN ARE YOU STARTING?

1134
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:36,672
WHO'S THE INFORMANT?

1135
01:09:42,887 --> 01:09:44,889
(rap music)

1136
01:09:50,144 --> 01:09:51,187
WHO'S SEO JAEYOUNG?

1137
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:52,646
GO, GO NEWS MENTAL

1138
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:53,689
WHO'S THE INFORMANT?

1139
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:12,708
I'M CURIOUS. IS THERE A DIFFERENT CULPRIT?

1140
01:10:23,594 --> 01:10:25,471
Hello, I'm Big Mouse, Park Changho.

1141
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:30,434
LET'S GET BIG MOUSE!

1142
01:10:30,517 --> 01:10:32,061
FOR REAL? BIG MOUSE IS ON?

1143
01:10:32,144 --> 01:10:34,146
I WANT TO CATCH BIG MOUSE!
A 50-MILLION-WON REWARD!

1144
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:36,148
HOW DO YOU KNOW BIG MOUSE?

1145
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:38,067
NO WAY. HOW DID BIG MOUSE COME ON?

1146
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:41,987
Should I predict something
about the trial today?

1147

BIG MOUTH

1148
01:10:48,327 --> 01:10:50,329
(closing theme music)

1149
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:14,103
WOMAN: I'm hungry.

1150
01:11:14,603 --> 01:11:16,897
MILK

1151
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:19,400
(indistinct background chatter)

1152
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:27,950
This expires today.

1153
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:29,952
Thank you.

1154
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:34,581
-(beeps)
-(door opens)

1155
01:11:34,665 --> 01:11:36,208
VENDOR: I'm sorry for being late.

1156
01:11:40,379 --> 01:11:43,299
These expire today.
You'll sell it to me for half off. Right?

1157
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:45,092
VENDOR: Gosh, you're terrible.

1158
01:11:45,175 --> 01:11:46,552
Take it.

1159
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:47,803
(laughs)

1160
01:11:47,886 --> 01:11:50,931
What? He gave me an expensive one,
so he can buy the cheap one.

1161
01:11:51,348 --> 01:11:54,810
There are 30 in here,
so take it out of my paycheck this month.

1162
01:11:54,893 --> 01:11:57,980
There's nothing left of the nothing left
of your paycheck this month.

1163
01:11:58,063 --> 01:11:59,064
You know that. Right?

1164
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:00,607
So is there anything left or not?

1165
01:12:00,691 --> 01:12:03,319
VENDOR (laughs):
There is. I'm just kidding.

1166
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:04,653
I'll get going. Have a nice day.

1167
01:12:04,737 --> 01:12:06,113
-VENDOR: You too.
-CHANGHO: Thank you.

1168
01:12:06,196 --> 01:12:07,448
VENDOR: Bye.

1169
01:12:11,076 --> 01:12:14,413
WOMAN: Why does he always buy
so much milk every day?

1170
01:12:14,496 --> 01:12:16,040
VENDOR: He's from the orphanage.

1171
01:12:16,123 --> 01:12:18,459
He gives it to his younger siblings,
so they get taller.

1172
01:12:18,542 --> 01:12:21,337
WOMAN: I see. He's a nice boy.

1173
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:22,504
(vendor laughs)

1174
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:27,593

BIG MOUTH

1176
01:12:48,947 --> 01:12:51,450
Where's Big Mouse? Where is he?

1177
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:53,786
CHANGHO: I want to show you
definitive evidence while I'm here.

1178
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:55,579
You can't fabricate evidence anymore.

1179
01:12:55,662 --> 01:12:57,998
You'll end up sending them
to prison yourself.

1180
01:12:58,082 --> 01:13:00,584
JIHOON: You'll die
if that gets into Big Mouse's hands.

1181
01:13:00,667 --> 01:13:01,919
Darn it!

1182
01:13:02,002 --> 01:13:04,088
CHANGHO: The reason I came in here
on my own is simple.

1183
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:09,676
JIHOON: You still think that the
accomplice who killed Professor Seo is me.

1184
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,221
Do you think Big Mouse
will reveal himself?

1185
01:13:12,805 --> 01:13:13,889
Tell Big Mouse...

1186
01:13:14,723 --> 01:13:15,891
to show up in front of me.
