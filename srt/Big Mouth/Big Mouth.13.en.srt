00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:31,943
at approximately 2:00 p.m. today

The police suspect
it was due to a gas leak

Sir.

35
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,007
I'm sure he got the message.

36
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,385
Now that his client's gone,
he has no reason

to butt into our business.

38
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:03,308
He's just as dangerous, if not more,
than Big Mouse.

Did you hear that Big Mouse died?

Why are you here at this hour?

54
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,192
What about you?

55
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,863
You killed Big Mouse, didn't you?

57
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,158

Don't say anything foolish.

I caught Big Mouse, you freaking louse.

00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,425
So? What is the elder giving you?

63
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:22,929
I heard he was going to give you
the company shares.

64
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,013
JIHOON: Hey.

65
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,349
You're not drooling over my company,
are you?

That's not the path for me,
so don't worry.

70
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,818
Just focus on your business.

Do you plan to eliminate Park Changho?

Set up a press conference.

This is the first time in my life
I'm trusting someone.

169
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,248
(tires screeching)

170
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:18,255
(music fades)

171
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:23,719
(car lock beeps)

172
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,268
We're a bit late.

173
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:33,938
Let's go in.

174
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,568
(ominous music)

175
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,710
It's Big Mouse's funeral.

176
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:02,383
The people here are core members
of the organization.

177
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,135
JERRY: They initially received help
from Big Mouse

178
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,721
and developed
a symbiotic relationship since.

179
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,230
Park Yoongab?

180
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,358
JERRY:
He was released on bail two days ago.

181
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,820
Although he has a big-shot lawyer
and was only charged with extortion,

182
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:26,031
he's expected not to be indicted
because the witnesses won't testify.

183
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,374
Is Park Yoongab Number Two?

184
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:37,042
No, he's Number Three.

185
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,735
(somber piano music)

186
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,919
(music swells)

187
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:23,797
-(light switch clicks)
-(music stops)

188
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,303
NO PARK:
This goes out to my loving family.

189
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:37,311
We didn't shy away from breaking laws

190
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,649
or cheating in order to achieve our goals.

191
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,944
We eliminated obstacles in our path

192
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:50,282
using any and all means necessary.

193
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:56,413
Our methods won't work any longer

194
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:02,086
because the entire world knows now
about the existence of Big Mouse.

195
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,339
Now,

196
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:09,551
we need someone to lead our organization
in a different manner.

197
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:14,139
I plan to assign
all of my authority to him.

198
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:17,851
I've thoroughly confirmed his abilities.

199
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,688
He is shrewder and braver

200
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,399
than I am.

201
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:27,069
If all of you are watching this video,

202
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:30,572
it means I've gone to a peaceful place.

203
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:36,495
I hope this video will never be played,

204
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,164
but if it is,

205
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,086
and all of you see this message,

206
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:49,299
I am no longer Big Mouse

207
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,468
as of this moment forth.

208
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,431
Park Changho is.

209
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,976
(epic music)

210
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:05,649
Trust Park Changho and follow his lead.
Submit yourself to him.

211
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,111
This is my dying wish

212
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,947
and my final command.

213
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,414
(light switch clicks)

214
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,708
(music fades)

215
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,305
(suspenseful music)

216
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:46,899
Who filmed that video?

217
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,448
YOONGAB: Nobody?

218
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,584
You filmed it, didn't you?

219
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:07,628
What?

220
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:10,464
You were the last one to see him.

221
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:15,969
How dare you fake a video like that
to take over the organization?

222
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,097
(thumps)

223
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,556
That's crap. Why would I?

224
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,517
-You bastard.
-MAN: I filmed it.

225
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,852
(music intensifies)

226
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,857
(tense music)

227
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,171
(music intensifies)

228
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:57,970
(music stops)

229
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,516
(tense music)

230
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,554
(music stops)

231
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,184
It's Big Mouse's last command.

232
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,436
If you refuse to comply,

233
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,563
please stand.

234
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,983
(dramatic music)

235
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,453
(thumps)

236
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,833
(thumps)

237
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,934
I shall comply.

238
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,776
(suspenseful music)

239
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,155
(door opens)

240
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,574
(door closes)

241
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:45,702
Mr. Park Changho.

242
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:50,707
Decide.

243
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,168
Will you accept or not?

244
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,143
(music swells)

245
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,428
(music stops)

246
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,347
(exhales sharply in slow motion)

247
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,433
(theme music)

248
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:01,695
(exhales sharply)

249
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:03,572
-(knocks on door)
-(door opens)

250
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,115
-(Mayor Choi sighs)
-(door closes)

251
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,783
(running footsteps)

252
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:07,951
ASSOCIATE: Sir.

253
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,288
MAYOR CHOI:
What happened with Park Changho?

254
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:14,291
Waterfowl committed suicide.

255
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,711
What? Suicide?

256
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:21,340
ASSOCIATE:
But his body was found in the building

257
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,633
where No Park died.

258
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:25,594
(scoffs)

259
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:29,139
The police say it looks like
it was impulsive while he was high...

260
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:30,223
What?

261
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:32,726
-(glass shatters)
-Suicide?

262
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:35,979
ASSOCIATE:
They found a suicide note in his pocket.

263
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:37,773
(scoffs)

264
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,776
What if it wasn't suicide,

265
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:44,071
but murder staged as suicide?

266
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:47,699
Are you saying Park Changho killed him?

267
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,327
(exhales)

268
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,293
(suspenseful music)

269
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,544
(exhales heavily)

270
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:06,635
(music stops)

271
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,012
CHANGHO: Hey, Kim Soontae.

272
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,557
You're a despicable rat.

273
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,479
What is this, The Truman Show?

274
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:21,983
Sorry.

275
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,030
But I couldn't bear to watch you die

276
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,950
wrongfully like that.

277
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:34,037
Hey. Don't give me that crap.

278
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,915
You people just used me.

279
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:38,166
All I did...

280
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:41,002
was save my friend.

281
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,304
(scoffing)

282
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:54,975
In other words,

283
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:59,104
there's no one to resent.

284
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:03,191
I'd be dead by now if it weren't for you,

285
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,527
and I became who I am now
from trying to survive.

286
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,237
Choi Doha is the one to blame.

287
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,949
He dragged you into that pit of hell.

288
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:13,034
(suspenseful music)

289
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,627
I was nervous that you'd refuse
to be Big Mouse.

290
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:23,753
How could I?

291
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:27,966
Like you bastards would've let me live
when I knew the organization's secrets?

292
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:33,221
This was a trap too.

293
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,098
As in,

294
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,644
you were forced to become Big Mouse
against your will?

295
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:43,648
Of course. Why would I lead
your dirty, organized crime ring?

296
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,734
(ominous music)

297
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:47,944
CHANGHO: Soontae.

298
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,950
I made Miho cry all my life.

299
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,995
I finally got out of jail.

300
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,040
I need to protect my family.

301
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,709
Becoming Big Mouse isn't right.

302
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:06,463
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

303
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:08,089
You're Number Two.

304
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,594
Isn't there a way you can help me?

305
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:16,515
The leaders in the organization
don't trust you yet.

306
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:20,018
SOONTAE: The moment you show weakness,
it'll give them justification.

307
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:21,853
If they rebel,

308
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:25,982
you'll be in greater danger.

309
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,031
(thumps)

310
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:37,244
I'll wait until tomorrow.
Make up your mind by then.

311
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,375
Don't tell Miho.

312
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,384
(door opens)

313
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:55,720
(door closes)

314
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:58,765
(exhales sharply)

315
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,697
-(door closes)
-(music stops)

316
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,370
(exhales)

317
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:28,253
KIKWANG: Hey. Where have you been?

318
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:30,463
We were worried.
You didn't answer your phone.

319
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:34,426
Big Mouse's people put us up
in this hotel, didn't they?

320
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:37,095
They'll be protecting you
from now on as well.

321
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:38,638
But why?

322
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,600
We need to make a decision.

323
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:45,312
Whether or not to continue
with Big Mouse's request.

324
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:49,274
KIKWANG: What do you mean?
Naturally, we should stop here.

325
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:52,110
Why should we fight on his behalf
when our client is gone?

326
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:53,903
Miho, aren't I right?

327
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,282
I think we should see it through.

328
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:58,742
KIKWANG: What?

329
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:01,369
The patients who were dying
of leukemia in the hospital.

330
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:04,414
The inmates who looked to me for help,
not knowing when they'd die.

331
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:08,126
And Hyejin,
who went missing while helping us.

332
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,920
I just can't turn my back on them.

333
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,297
KIKWANG: Miho.

334
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:15,925
If we give up now,
there will be more victims in the future.

335
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,345
MIHO: The perps will live well
and high on the hog.

336
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:19,512
That angers me.

337
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:22,766
Of course, it does.
But how do we fight them?

338
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:24,893
You know that nothing's on our side,
not even the law.

339
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,978
Big Mouse's people are helping us.

340
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:29,189
KIKWANG: They're bad guys too.

341
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:32,192
MIHO: Use bad guys
to step all over other bad guys.

342
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:33,276
KIKWANG: But...

343
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,444
Anyway,

344
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:37,739
I'm going to see it through,
and that's that.

345
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,952
KIKWANG: Hey. Miho. What...

346
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,748
Changho, talk some sense into her.

347
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:49,876
What could I say to her?
Everything she said was right.

348
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:52,587
Then what, you two are saints
and I'm scum?

349
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,049
KIKWANG: You two are such a headache.

350
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,801
(clicks tongue)

351
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,806
(pensive music)

352
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,984
(music fades)

353
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,575
SOONTAE: Did you think it through?

354
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,664
No Park told me once...

355
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:32,585
NO PARK: The fear and despair
my daughter must've felt...

356
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:36,881
I'm going to return it to them
a thousandfold.

357
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,634
Turning the world they created

358
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,720
into a complete hell

359
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,972
is law and justice...

360
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:47,976
to me.

361
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,563
That law and justice.

362
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:58,737
I'll leave after I establish that.

363
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,490
SOONTAE:
You're up against a tough opponent.

364
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,368
This fight may last your entire life.

365
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:09,664
(sighs)
I know.

366
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,630
What happened to No Park's daughter?

367
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,467
Her name was No Soojin.
She was a freelance reporter.

368
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:25,472
SOONTAE: She went missing while working
on an exposé on the NR Forum.

369
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:30,059
Her skeleton was found
three years after she went missing.

370
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,687
Her notebook was with her body.

371
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:37,108
All they found in that notebook were
"Seo Jaeyoung" and "paper."

372
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,444
(suspenseful music)

373
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:40,528
(brakes screeching)

374
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:44,157
SOONTAE: They were about
to interrogate him when he was murdered.

375
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,117
And the 100 billion won?

376
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:49,579
We planted Peter Hong among them
in order to locate Soojin,

377
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,790
but he took off with the money.

378
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:55,460
We tracked him
and finally located the money,

379
00:29:56,461 --> 00:30:00,340
but he suddenly turned himself in,
so we had to silence him.

380
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,092
So you found the money?

381
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,303
No, we didn't.

382
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:08,014
(truck whirring)

383
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,391
SOONTAE: Someone had already taken it.

384
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:13,228
Did he have an accomplice?

385
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:14,604
SOONTAE: Maybe.

386
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:17,190
To be honest,
we don't care about the money.

387
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:18,817
CHANGHO: I have one more question.

388
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,485
When I was in the mental hospital...

389
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:21,778
The gold bar that they dug up?

390
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,739
We were listening.

391
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:28,076
Park Yoongab bugged Gong Jihoon's phone.

392
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,203
How simple.

393
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:32,747
We're efficient.

394
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:58,648
Okay, then. Let's get down to business.

395
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,943
-How do I control the organization?
-Just give me your commands.

396
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:03,653
I manage the organization.

397
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:06,573
Let's dig into Chairman Kang
and the NR Forum first.

398
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:08,491
We do have material we've gathered, but...

399
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:11,703
That won't do. Have everyone
in the organization dig into them.

400
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:14,122
Include past and present background check,

401
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:17,709
assets, family, personal lives,
down to Chairman Kang's dental implants.

402
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:19,794
(tense music)

403
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:28,469
(music stops)

404
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,180
President of NK Chemical,
CEO of Woojae Construction,

405
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:33,766
CEO of SS Motors,
managing director of HC Law,

406
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,310
chairman of Nine Semiconductors,

407
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:36,811
the second son of OC Group's owner,

408
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,771
the director of Gucheon Hospital,

409
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,815
the Mayor of Gucheon,

410
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,192
and the newest member,
Prosecutor Choi Joongrak.

411
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:45,945
We've identified
a total of 21 NR Forum members.

412
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,406
And their leader is, as you know...

413
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:49,699
(remote clicks)

414
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:50,825
...this bastard.

415
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:53,828
(laughs)

416
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,330
Let's not curse during a meeting.

417
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:56,998
Sorry about that.

418
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:02,045
JERRY: Before we talk about the NR Forum,
you need to know about this man.

419
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:04,422
Kang Sunggeun. Age 85.

420
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:07,342
The first chairman of the NR Forum
and founder of NK Chemical.

421
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,761
He was a major general in the army.

422
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:12,305
He went into business after retiring
and became very successful.

423
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:14,557
They say he was involved in various ways

424
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:17,727
in Gucheon's development
with his immense wealth and connections.

425
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,938
JERRY: But he's very secretive,
so I was unable to confirm.

426
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:23,441
He's the one who turned a poor village
into what Gucheon is today.

427
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:26,361
JERRY: The people here call him
their president for life.

428
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:27,862
(remote clicks)

429
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,364
The handout describes

430
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:32,492
the different businesses
being run by the NR Forum members.

431
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:35,203
Road construction,
apartment construction and sale,

432
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,622
even a large shopping complex...

433
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:40,041
They have their hands in everything
that makes money.

434
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,752
All of the past mayors were scouted
by the NR Forum like Choi Doha.

435
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:44,963
It's a typical alliance.

436
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,464
The rich and powerful take it all.

437
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:48,466
MIHO: I looked into it separately.

438
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,385
Recently, the number of cancer patients

439
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,929
in Gucheon is at least 20 times higher.

440
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,348
And it's mostly blood cancer.

441
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,308
That's the big problem.

442
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,643
This is mass murder.

443
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:01,771
The only companies among them
related to leukemia are...

444
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:05,233
Nine Semiconductors,
NK Chemical, and nuclear power business.

445
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,901
It's most likely NK Chemical.

446
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,737
Gong Jihoon and Choi Doha are enemies,

447
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,656
but they colluded
regarding Seo Jaeyoung...

448
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:12,991
It has to be NK Chemical.

449
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:16,494
And Chairman Kang is the only one
who can control both of them at once.

450
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,788
(ominous music)

451
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,916
-(sprinkler pouring)
-(groaning)

452
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:32,051
Those pipes
from that sinkhole last time...

453
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:33,511
I was worried, so I looked into it,

454
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:36,431
and the pipes belong to a fish farm
in the area.

455
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:39,142
Why does a fish farm need such big pipes?

456
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:41,811
KIKWANG: They illegally use
underground water there.

457
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:45,648
Regardless, the chemical factory
has nothing to do with it, so don't worry.

458
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:47,942
Chairman Kang holds the key to everything.

459
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:51,279
Find out if there's any way
to get close to him.

460
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,321
Got it.

461
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:54,365
I'm sure the secret lab
in Gucheon Hospital

462
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,701
is related to NK Chemical.

463
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:58,369
I'll ask Dr. Hong to look into it.

464
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,041
(tense music)

465
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:13,342
DIRECTOR, HYUN JUHEE

466
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,387
RESULT REPORT
CONFIDENTIAL

467
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:17,889
TOXIC CHEMICAL LEAK
CONFIDENTIAL

468
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,268
(frustrated sigh)

469
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,687
These deplorable snakes.

470
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:27,940
(breathes heavily)

471
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:30,693
(slurps)

472
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:32,779
(faint gentle music playing)

473
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:34,906
How wicked of you.

474
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:39,827
You know my eating habits,
yet you brought me here.

475
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,872
I like Western cuisine.

476
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,250
You need to give in once in a while.

477
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:48,795
I've forced myself to eat many times.

478
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,174
What upset you this time?

479
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:56,302
Don't beat around the bush
and just say it.

480
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:58,054
What do you want from me?

481
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,350
I read through all the secret documents

482
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:04,644
about the business.

483
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:07,438
As you should since you're
the commissioner of the audit committee.

484
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:08,648
It made me so sick

485
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:10,817
that I nearly vomited.

486
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,943
Juhee.

487
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,197
(sighs)

488
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,032
I'll take it as your growing pains.

489
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,160
-So?
-I'd like you to give up

490
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,162
on the chemical company.

491
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:27,291
The side effects of NF9,
which you created,

492
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:30,962
have reached their limit.

493
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:32,964
It was buried for decades,

494
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,715
and it's been fine until now.

495
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,509
It'll become a heavy burden on you soon.

496
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:39,595
Korea developed while I bore that burden.

497
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:43,224
ELDER: Even if my back snaps
and it kills me, I have no regrets.

498
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,017
It has become my joy and legacy.

499
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:48,062
You must get rid of it
to protect that joy and legacy...

500
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,438
-(thumps on table)
-Sir!

501
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,817
That's enough.

502
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:56,654
ELDER: Mr. Cha.

503
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:58,739
(ominous music)

504
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,951
-CHA: Yes, sir.
-I'm done eating. Let's go.

505
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:03,119
CHA: Yes, sir.

506
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,745
(breathing heavily)

507
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,831
(suspenseful music)

508
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,719
You knew from before

509
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:23,514
that the elder wasn't clean.

510
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,683
Too many people have died.

511
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:29,395
And they're still dying.

512
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:36,152
Seo Jaeyoung...

513
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,617
I killed him.

514
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,579
(tense music)

515
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:53,461
What do you mean?

516
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,548
Why would you do that?

517
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:04,597
Do you know how I got
the elder to let me marry you?

518
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,851
I had to agree to do anything,

519
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,147
no matter how vile it was.

520
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:21,864
I've never once regretted

521
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:25,576
marrying you.

522
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,956
(breathing nervously)

523
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,671
(suspenseful music)

524
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:40,925
(sobbing silently)

525
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,639
GUCHEON UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

526
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:49,225
HEAD NURSE: What did you just say?

527
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,269
You'll get rid of...

528
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:52,520
The secret lab.

529
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:55,022
-Ma'am.
-I don't want any trace of it left.

530
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:59,110
It will be done
between midnight and sunrise.

531
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:02,154
JUHEE: It must be completed quickly
without anyone seeing.

532
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:04,407
I don't care how much it costs,

533
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,242
so bring workers
who will keep it a secret.

534
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:08,494
Have you consulted...

535
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:12,081
I'm in charge. Whom do I have to consult?

536
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:13,791
What if there's a problem later?

537
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:16,002
I understand, ma'am.

538
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:23,759
(suspenseful music)

539
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,556
(door closes)

540
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:30,808
(birds chirping)

541
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:33,644
(sighs)

542
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,813
I don't know if this is right,

543
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:40,484
living in a hotel suite,
getting room service, even the bodyguards.

544
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,153
KIKWANG: This treatment is too lavish.

545
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,322
Are you saying you like it or not?

546
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:47,700
I should like it, but I don't. That's why.

547
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,161
(phone vibrating)

548
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:51,329
DR. HONG

549
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:56,500
Hello, Dr. Hong.

550
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:57,668
DR. HONG: We were too late.

551
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,171
Director Hyun Juhee
got rid of the secret lab.

552
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:03,382
What do you mean,
she got rid of the secret lab?

553
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:06,552
(machines whirring)

554
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,972
(tense music)

555
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:23,819
I'll take care of it.

556
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:41,420
WORKER: Get moving. Work faster.

557
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:48,010
(music intensifies)

558
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,224
DR. HAN: This isn't right. Is it?

559
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:56,394
I'm the lab manager.
How could she get rid of it?

560
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,270
CHAEBONG: Calm down.

561
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:01,899
-Hey, you! You little...
-DOOGEUN: Hey. Calm down.

562
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,985
-Calm down.
-DR. HAN: Damn it.

563
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,029
(grunting)

564
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,114
(exhales sharply)

565
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:10,574
It took one night to get rid of the lab.

566
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:13,911
We got blood on our hands
and rolled in the mud,

567
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:15,871
and worked like dogs for ten years.

568
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:19,708
You got blood on your hands
and rolled in the mud,

569
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,710
and that cesspit was all you built?

570
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,796
(ominous music)

571
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,798
Try saying that to the chairman.

572
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:29,385
Then we'll give you props for your drive.

573
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:32,138
Go on in.

574
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:37,643
You'll probably lose everything
except the clothes on your back.

575
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:39,812
(laughing)

576
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:42,106
DR. HAN: Why, you little...

577
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:43,774
(knocks on door)

578
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,151
(door opens)

579
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,247
No individual is above the organization.

580
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:01,375
I know you're like a granddaughter to me,

581
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:04,003
but I can't save you
if you defy the organization.

582
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:08,090
Explain yourself.
Why did you get rid of the secret lab?

583
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,469
I'll leave the hospital.

584
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,764
Are you saying you'll leave me?

585
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:16,932
No.

586
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:20,644
I'll build a new lab.

587
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:26,150
The public became aware
of the existence of Dr. Seo's paper.

588
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:28,444
It's too dangerous
to keep the secret lab...

589
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:31,238
as is.

590
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:33,908
Mm.

591
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,576
So, you'll do it properly?

592
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,328
It's impossible to do it right

593
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:39,580
without getting your hands dirty.

594
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:41,999
(Elder laughs)

595
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:44,585
You're not a fisherman
if you don't smell like fish.

596
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:47,796
But, please do me a favor.

597
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,340
What is it?

598
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:52,968
Give me the shares
that you were planning to give...

599
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:55,387
to Mr. Gong.

600
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:57,264
You crazy...

601
00:41:57,973 --> 00:41:59,183
Hey, Hyun Juhee.

602
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:01,727
Why do you need it?

603
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:03,437
You know

604
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:06,982
that you need power
to do things like this well.

605
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,693
(tense music)

606
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:12,947
-Mr. Cha.
-CHA: Yes, sir.

607
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:20,120
It's an agreement donating
my shares of Woojeong Daily.

608
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:21,830
ELDER: Sign it.

609
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:22,915
Mr. Chairman.

610
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:25,209
I don't have much left to live.

611
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:27,753
I've worked all my life
to build my reputation.

612
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:30,923
You'd better not drag my name
through the mud.

613
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:32,383
I won't, sir

614
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:48,023
(tense music)

615
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:07,334
(music fades)

616
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:14,049
Thank you, Juhee.

617
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:17,803
I've never regretted

618
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,973
marrying you either.

619
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:22,891
(breathes deeply)

620
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:37,197
(ominous music)

621
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:06,977
(running footsteps)

622
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:10,731
(thumps)

623
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,816
(tense music)

624
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,531
(shower stops)

625
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:22,326
(breathing heavily)

626
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:27,331
(grunting)

627
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,837
(grunting)

628
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:38,467
(music intensifies)

629
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:40,928
(shower running)

630
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:44,139
(man shrieks)

631
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:47,935
-(groaning)
-(indistinct shouts)

632
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:53,232
(groaning)

633
00:44:58,529 --> 00:44:59,697
(Mayor Choi groans)

634
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:04,952
(groaning)

635
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:08,080
(breathing heavily)

636
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,794
(suspenseful music)

637
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:18,841
(grunts)

638
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,802
-MAN: Hello, Boss.
-ALL: Hey.

639
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:25,013
Why is there no sign?

640
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:27,141
MAN: A sign?

641
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:28,434
Come now.

642
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:30,644
Really popular local restaurants
don't have signs.

643
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:33,480
-Really?
-Please come in, Boss.

644
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:34,898
(sighs)

645
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:36,734
(Chunsik groans)

646
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:40,946
(exhales heavily)

647
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:42,990
CHUNSIK: Hey.

648
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:45,075
(laughs)

649
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:47,536
-Congratulations on your release.
-Hello, sir.

650
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:50,122
Hi, Jerry. It's good to see you.

651
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:51,331
(laughs)

652
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:54,793
But why did you call me to a restaurant
that didn't even open yet?

653
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:58,505
Right? I wonder why.

654
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:02,384
(breathes deeply)

655
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:05,053
You want me to run this place?

656
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:08,098
You wanted a fresh start.

657
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:10,142
SOONTAE: Don't worry about rent.

658
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:12,102
We'll bring in as much sales as you want.

659
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:14,313
As much as I want?

660
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:19,693
I'm confident in my skills
with knives and fire,

661
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:21,945
but this is too big a gift.

662
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:25,699
I promised to give you
a life of luxury, remember?

663
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:27,993
(laughs)

664
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,081
Choi Doha was attacked.

665
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:34,208
What do you mean?

666
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:35,834
Who was behind it?

667
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:37,711
Warden Park.

668
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:38,921
(sighs)

669
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,637
(upbeat music)

670
00:46:57,898 --> 00:47:00,275
SOONTAE:
Park Yoongab recently bought a junkyard.

671
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:02,152
MEN: Hello, sir!

672
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:04,905
SOONTAE: The Soori Gang in the area
is working for him.

673
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:07,282
They're notorious for being violent.

674
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:11,119
Has he ever acted
on his own like this before?

675
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:12,329
I told you.

676
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:15,082
There are people
who haven't accepted you yet.

677
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:18,377
SOONTAE: Park Yoongab is one of them.

678
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:22,381
If you can't fix this,
the organization will fall apart.

679
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:25,133
(upbeat music)

680
00:47:28,136 --> 00:47:29,429
(indistinct murmuring)

681
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,265
MAN 1: Come on, man.

682
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:33,141
MAN 2: In here.

683
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,023
(music stops)

684
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:44,444
(laughter in background)

685
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,947
You missed.

686
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:49,199
(suspenseful music)

687
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:50,993
MAN 3: Let's see.

688
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:52,619
(balls clanking)

689
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:55,247
(indistinct chattering)

690
00:47:57,624 --> 00:47:59,042
What's this?

691
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:02,921
Wait over there.

692
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:10,470
Why are you here? Because of Choi Doha?

693
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:13,056
(exhales heavily)

694
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,225
There's no need to worry.

695
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:18,437
YOONGAB: The guy that was arrested
won't be able to blab.

696
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:21,648
I never received a command
to attack Choi Doha.

697
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:26,987
Our boss died in broad daylight.
And he died a horrific death.

698
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:29,197
It's obvious who killed him,

699
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:33,035
but no one will step up and punish him.

700
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:36,747
That was why I did it,
instead of the moron Park Changho.

701
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,959
YOONGAB: There are people who worked
their fingers to the bone for Mr. No.

702
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:42,336
It's not fair.

703
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:44,588
If he shows up out of nowhere
and claims the crown,

704
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:46,840
will he automatically have authority?

705
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:51,345
Park Changho is way too weak.

706
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:53,263
He's not like us.

707
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:55,474
Big Mouse?

708
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,729
Tell him to dream on.

709
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:06,401
(groans)

710
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:08,487
(ominous music)

711
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,322
(liquid pouring)

712
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:17,496
(muffled gasp)

713
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:21,083
(muffled whimper)

714
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:25,712
(rattling)

715
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:29,716
(muffled screaming)

716
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:37,724
(muffled scream)

717
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,816
(tense music)

718
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:55,033
(muffled screaming)

719
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,623
(phone vibrating)

720
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:02,916
PARK CHANGHO

721
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:07,838
(muffled whimpering)

722
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:20,308
(clangs)

723
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:25,397
(fire crackling)

724
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:32,946
(footsteps)

725
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:35,282
(grunting)

726
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:36,616
MAN: Kneel!

727
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,760
If Choi Doha had died,
you would've died as well,

728
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:56,470
since you ruined my plan.

729
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:00,724
CHANGHO: The revenge I want
isn't as simple as yours.

730
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:04,644
They're vampires that suck out
and live on the blood of innocent people.

731
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:07,481
You know what vampires fear the most,
don't you?

732
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,443
Burning slowly to death in the sun.

733
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,742
(ominous music)

734
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,704
I'm going to reveal

735
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:25,582
all the crimes they committed
in the brightest place.

736
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:29,544
Setting their soul on fire

737
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:31,421
is how I get my revenge.

738
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:33,507
(ominous music)

739
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:37,427
(whimpers, groans)

740
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:41,306
That's as far as I'll go.

741
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:46,019
I'm not interested in being Big Mouse,
so you people do what you want afterward.

742
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:48,188
I'll leave once I'm done.

743
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:53,235
(music intensifies)

744
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,074
(music stops)

745
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:01,785
(mouse clicks)

746
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:05,122
NK CHEMICAL FINALLY DEVELOPS
NEW SUBSTANCE NF9

747
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:07,207
(suspenseful music)

748
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:09,543
(mouse clicking)

749
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:11,253
GLOBAL ATTENTION ON NF9

750
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:14,214
WILL KOREA EXPORT CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY?

751
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:20,262
KANG SUNGGEUN RECEIVES
PRESIDENTIAL AWARD

752
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:24,850
KIKWANG: Miho.

753
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:26,643
Don't overexert yourself.

754
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:27,811
Did you find anything?

755
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:30,313
No. You?

756
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:33,233
It would be quicker
to find a needle in a haystack.

757
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:35,235
Maybe our approach is too crude.

758
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:37,946
(exclaims)

759
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:39,698
Look at this.

760
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:41,700
NK CHEMICAL'S LAB DIRECTOR
CHO HAESOO COMMITS SUICIDE

761
00:52:41,783 --> 00:52:43,994
Hey. This sounds fishy.

762
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:50,709
Cho Haesoo must've had family.
Can you find them?

763
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:52,377
I'll find them before the library closes.

764
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:54,462
(tense music)

765
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:57,799
NK CHEMICAL'S LAB DIRECTOR
CHO HAESOO COMMITS SUICIDE

766
00:52:57,883 --> 00:53:00,594
JERRY: That family was really cursed.

767
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:04,556
He had a son but he committed suicide
in prison 20 years ago.

768
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:06,016
Why was he in prison?

769
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:08,685
He ran a dye factory
and dumped waste illegally.

770
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:12,522
And Cho Haesoo's grandson

771
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:15,275
drowned in the Haecheon River
30 years ago.

772
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:18,528
His name was Cho Sunghyun or something.

773
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:21,740
What about other family?

774
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:23,575
His daughter-in-law immigrated to the US.

775
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:26,995
His brother-in-law is his only relative,
but he is in a nursing home.

776
00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:29,623
KIKWANG: Gosh. What a sad family.

777
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:35,795
GREEN NARAE NURSING HOME

778
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:39,674
GREEN NARAE NURSING HOME

779
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:47,349
(ominous music)

780
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:53,730
(knocks on door)

781
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:57,567
(music stops)

782
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:00,362
(door closes)

783
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:05,200
WOMAN: This is him.

784
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:10,163
Hello, sir.

785
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:13,041
(sobs)

786
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:20,757
(sobbing)

787
00:54:22,884 --> 00:54:24,928
(sobbing continues)

788
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:26,221
MAN: Save him.

789
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:28,265
My grandson fell in the water.

790
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:30,141
MAN: Please save my grandson.

791
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:32,435
Save precious Doha.

792
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:35,146
MAN: He's drowning.

793
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:36,481
WOMAN: Sir.

794
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:38,275
He's at it again.

795
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:41,069
It'll be hard to have
a real conversation with him today.

796
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:42,988
Who's Doha?

797
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:46,533
It's his grandson who drowned
a long time ago in the Haecheon River.

798
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:48,827
The Haecheon River?

799
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:50,704
MAN (sobbing): Save him.

800
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:53,415
Save my grandson.

801
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,251
Doha.

802
00:54:57,877 --> 00:55:00,714
He's drowning. Save him.

803
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:03,091
WOMAN: Have a nice day.

804
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:13,977
I just checked.
His legal guardian is Mayor Choi Doha.

805
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:16,438
(scoffs)

806
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:19,190
I'm sure the old man said
that his grandson died.

807
00:55:19,774 --> 00:55:23,069
MAYOR CHOI: When I was a child,
my father ran a dye factory.

808
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:28,658
It was true that my father
secretly dumped toxic waste.

809
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,077
Whenever it rained for three years.

810
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,538
(suspenseful music)

811
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:36,666
Cho Haesoo's son ran a dye factory, right?

812
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:39,753
He died in prison.
He was in there for dumping waste.

813
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:44,341
We may be able
to solve this puzzle after all.

814
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:50,138
REPORTER 1: He's coming. Here he is!

815
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:52,015
(camera shutters clicking)

816
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:53,850
How do you feel?

817
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:55,560
I'm fine.

818
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:57,729
I'm sorry for causing concern.

819
00:55:58,396 --> 00:56:02,067
The assailant said he was bitter
about the redevelopment and attacked you.

820
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:04,819
Please, no speculations
until the police finish investigating.

821
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:07,572
What are your plans after your term?
There's a lot of talk about it.

822
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:09,240
Well...

823
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:13,370
I'll announce it now officially
instead of holding a press conference.

824
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:18,583
I will not run for re-election
in the upcoming mayoral race.

825
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:22,253
I plan to join
the Democratic People's Party

826
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:24,297
and run for the National Assembly.

827
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:27,842
I will repay everyone for their support...

828
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,303
How many reporters can you gather?

829
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:31,805
As many as we want.

830
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:34,474
Call a press conference.
Make it as grand as possible.

831
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:36,101
Why do you want a press conference?

832
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:39,104
I thought of a good way
to get close to Chairman Kang.

833
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,983
(glass shatters)

834
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:46,611
What did you just say?

835
00:56:48,029 --> 00:56:50,156
Say that again, you bastard!

836
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,324
(laughs)

837
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:55,203
You lost your shares to Hyun Juhee
and got pushed aside by Choi Doha.

838
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:57,372
Am I wrong, punk?

839
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,749
-JIHOON: Get over here.
-CHAEBONG: Fine, hit me.

840
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:02,293
-After I got you out of jail...
-Hit me. Go ahead.

841
00:57:03,044 --> 00:57:05,088
DOOGEUN: Cut it out already!

842
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:07,924
We need to put our heads together
and come up with a plan!

843
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:10,927
Let go!

844
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:13,638
(breathing heavily)

845
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:15,849
(phone vibrating)

846
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:17,809
(coughing)

847
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:22,021
Yeah, what is it?

848
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:25,775
Okay.

849
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:28,027
(phone beeps)

850
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:30,363
Park Changho's on the move again.

851
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:33,700
He's holding a press conference
to make a big announcement.

852
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:37,579
(phone vibrating)

853
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:40,582
ATTORNEY PARK CHANGHO

854
00:57:40,665 --> 00:57:42,625
(scoffs, spits)

855
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:46,045
(shouts)

856
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:49,299
Hi, Attorney Park.

857
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:53,178
To what do I owe the pleasure?

858
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:56,139
CHANGHO: I'm holding a press conference.
Want to come?

859
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:59,392
Why should I go to your press conference?

860
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:01,311
REPORTER 1: He's here!

861
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:03,938
(camera shutters clicking)

862
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:06,024
(tense music)

863
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:12,780
P&K ATTORNEY PARK CHANGHO'S
EMERGENCY PRESS CONFERENCE

864
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:20,788
REPORTER 2: Is today's announcement
regarding Big Mouse?

865
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:23,374
We will not accept any questions
about Big Mouse today.

866
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,793
REPORTER 3:
Then what is your announcement?

867
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:28,963
I will be running for mayor

868
00:58:30,548 --> 00:58:32,300
in the upcoming election
as an independent.

869
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:34,552
(suspenseful music)

870
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:37,388
Why are you suddenly announcing
your candidacy?

871
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:39,265
Mayor Choi Doha had had
a secret relationship

872
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,518
with a corrupt organization
in the area during his term.

873
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:43,686
I'm willing to bear the cross

874
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:47,065
in order to sever those dirty ties.
That is why I'm here.

875
00:58:47,148 --> 00:58:49,317
REPORTER 4:
What corrupt organization do you mean?

876
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:52,028
(reporters clamoring)

877
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:56,866
(breathes deeply)

878
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:04,123
CHANGHO: I read that Hyun Juhee became the
majority shareholder of Woojeong Daily.

879
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,750
(scoffs)

880
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:07,335
Choi Doha left you in the dirt.

881
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:10,880
You didn't call me all the way here
to taunt me, did you?

882
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:15,677
For someone with no connections to gain
that much trust from Chairman Kang...

883
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:17,929
Is it true...

884
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:21,766
that Choi Doha killed Big Mouse?

885
00:59:24,143 --> 00:59:26,229
Leave if you're going to talk nonsense.

886
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:28,064
Make me mayor.

887
00:59:29,607 --> 00:59:32,110
Whoever the NR Forum supported
has always won.

888
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:34,279
You want to collude with me?

889
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:38,825
Chairman Kang is as powerful
as he is now thanks to the past mayors.

890
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:42,328
I'll do that for you.
I'll make you as powerful as he is.

891
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:45,164
Are you...

892
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:49,085
confident you can become like Choi Doha?

893
00:59:49,168 --> 00:59:53,214
He plays a lot dirtier than you think.

894
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:54,716
Don't you remember?

895
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:58,553
When I first went to see you,
I asked for three billion won.

896
00:59:58,636 --> 01:00:01,889
(laughs)

897
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:04,267
You're right.

898
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:06,436
You're of the same breed.

899
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:10,732
You only live once.
Might as well live in style.

900
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:15,695
Then you shouldn't have held
a press conference.

901
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:18,948
I can't help you
if the chairman dislikes you.

902
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:22,410
I'll take care of that myself,
so set up a meeting with him for me.

903
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:26,080
Are you trying to use me?

904
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:29,834
No, right?

905
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,045
No.

906
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:37,050
Aren't we using each other
for a win-win relationship?

907
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:41,721
(tense music)

908
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:49,771
(music stops)

909
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:51,731
Did you know

910
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:54,734
that Park Changho
was going to run for mayor?

911
01:00:56,861 --> 01:00:58,237
It was unexpected.

912
01:00:59,947 --> 01:01:01,449
Don't worry too much about it.

913
01:01:01,532 --> 01:01:04,827
Even if he is Park Changho,
he won't be able to win the election.

914
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:10,750
Mr. Gong brought Park Changho.

915
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:12,835
(suspenseful music)

916
01:01:16,964 --> 01:01:18,675
-Send him away.
-Bring him in.

917
01:01:22,136 --> 01:01:23,471
(sighs)

918
01:01:25,139 --> 01:01:26,432
(door opens)

919
01:01:27,975 --> 01:01:29,102
CHA: He says to come in.

920
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:35,692
(suspenseful music)

921
01:01:56,754 --> 01:01:57,922
(music stops)

922
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:06,431
It's nice to meet you, sir.

923
01:02:07,181 --> 01:02:08,391
I'm Park Changho.

924
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:18,860
RIDE THE WIND AND CUT THROUGH THE WATER

925
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:22,822
(tense music intensifies)

926
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:36,544
BIG MOUTH

927
01:02:36,627 --> 01:02:38,629
(closing theme music)

928
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:59,400
BIG MOUTH

929
01:02:59,984 --> 01:03:01,152
CHANGHO: Wait a little.

930
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:04,322
I'll show the world
how disgusting you truly are.

931
01:03:04,405 --> 01:03:06,616
Do you remember a boy named Cho Sunghyun?

932
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:09,994
If we're after the same thing,
I'd like to work with you.

933
01:03:10,077 --> 01:03:12,038
SOONTAE:
You should've given me a heads-up.

934
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:13,748
CHANGHO:
I can't miss an opportunity like this.

935
01:03:13,831 --> 01:03:15,291
Everything's been set.

936
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:16,626
JERRY: Boss is in danger.

937
01:03:16,709 --> 01:03:18,169
I'm not the traitor.

938
01:03:18,252 --> 01:03:19,962
YOONGAB: The organization betrayed me.

939
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:23,216
How it feels to lose everything...

940
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:24,342
(gunshot)

941
01:03:24,425 --> 01:03:26,093
(laughing)

942
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:27,512
I'm going to kill you!
