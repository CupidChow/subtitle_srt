1
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:07,173
(theme music)

2
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:43,960
BIG MOUTH

3
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,754
THIS SHOW IS A WORK OF FICTION

4
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:48,965
THE EVENTS AND ENTITIES
THAT APPEAR HEREIN ARE FICTIONAL

5
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,262
It's nice to meet you, sir.

6
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:56,139
I'm Park Changho.

7
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,516
EPISODE 14

8
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,602
(suspenseful music)

9
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:02,937
So you have something to tell me?

10
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:09,277
If you feel uncomfortable,
we could talk privately.

11
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,738
I'll tell you.

12
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:15,450
I am... being blackmailed by Big Mouse.

13
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:18,203
I was told Big Mouse was dead.

14
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:20,538
A new guy is in charge of the gang now.

15
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,874
(tense music)

16
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:25,460
A new Big Mouse has surfaced?

17
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:26,544
CHANGHO: Yes, sir.

18
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:29,964
He's stronger and more vicious
than his predecessor.

19
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:36,096
CHANGHO: He claims to be protecting
my family, but he's holding them hostage.

20
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:41,101
If I don't do what they want,
my family and I will die.

21
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:42,769
Sir.

22
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,147
ELDER: What is it they want from you?

23
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,941
To avenge the late No Park's death.

24
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,777
They wanted me to approach Mr. Gong
under the pretense

25
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,654
of investing the 100 billion they took.

26
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:57,784
Your press conference
was quite provocative.

27
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:03,957
I thought you wouldn't meet me
unless I did something like that.

28
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:08,294
CHANGHO: What they want is for me
to get close to you.

29
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:11,631
If I made the opportunity,
they would kill you.

30
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:18,138
Why are they obsessing
over Seo Jaeyoung's paper?

31
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:21,975
No Park's daughter died
while looking into Seo Jaeyoung's paper.

32
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:24,435
What was her name?

33
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,813
Her name was No Soojin.
She was a freelance reporter.

34
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:31,985
No Soojin...

35
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,529
(suspenseful music)

36
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:43,872
And? How much do they know?

37
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:47,458
They know that Gucheon Hospital
has a secret lab related to radiation

38
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,836
and that the reason why the model inmates
got leukemia

39
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,462
are connected to NK Chemical.

40
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:56,759
My wife and I found out
because of their threats.

41
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,304
That's all. I don't want to know anymore.

42
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,431
(tense music)

43
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:07,395
Do you know who the new Big Mouse is?

44
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,400
You're asking the wrong question first.

45
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:18,323
You should ask why I came to see you.

46
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,408
Did you come to strike a deal with me?

47
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:22,619
No, sir. I came to check.

48
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:27,248
I wanted to see if I could trust you
with me and my family's fate.

49
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,553
CHA: Please wait here for a moment.

50
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,606
(music stops)

51
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:57,737
JIHOON: It doesn't seem like he's lying.

52
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,157
If we use him well, he could be...

53
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,325
MAYOR CHOI: He's dangerous.

54
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,661
We shouldn't trust Park Changho.

55
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:05,870
If we abandon him now,

56
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,790
he'll continue to attack us
from the outside. Is that...

57
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:11,209
It's better to have him as an enemy.

58
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,503
We should keep potential threats at bay.

59
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:18,675
If he's a threat,
we could keep him under our knees.

60
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,678
-Sir.
-You have plenty of time

61
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,430
to investigate him thoroughly
before you decide.

62
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,099
(elder laughs)

63
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,642
What an interesting fellow.

64
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:30,895
I feel uneasy rejecting him,
but I'm uncomfortable accepting him.

65
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:35,900
He's the first person who came to test me
while holding all the cards in his hands.

66
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,694
(laughs)

67
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,533
ELDER: Why did you really come to see me?

68
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,958
Make me mayor of Gucheon.

69
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,711
If you give me the authority,

70
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,921
I'm confident I can remove them
by the roots.

71
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,257
Power is like a knife.

72
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,092
If you use it on fish,
it's a sashimi knife,

73
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:03,094
and if you use it on a human,
it's a weapon.

74
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:06,264
If you give it to me, I'll use it for you.

75
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:11,102
Trying to win favor with big talk
is what swindlers do.

76
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,187
(suspenseful music)

77
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:25,992
This is the list of members

78
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,494
who are executives in Big Mouse's gang.

79
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:32,206
LIST OF EXECUTIVES

80
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,208
CHANGHO:
This is just the tip of the iceberg.

81
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:37,045
They're spread out like cancer
within society.

82
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,548
And Big Mouse?

83
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,800
He's still completely hidden.

84
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:45,428
My job would be to find him.

85
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,139
Are you saying
you'd become a double agent?

86
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:51,434
If you keep it a secret,
I'm confident I can do it.

87
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,315
(exhales)

88
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,111
(exhales heavily)

89
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,490
My birthday is coming up.

90
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:08,368
If it's okay with you,
I'd like to invite you and your wife.

91
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,705
(music fades)

92
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,374
Thank you, Chairman.

93
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,043
(tense music)

94
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,978
RIDE THE WIND AND CUT THROUGH THE WATER

95
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:39,023
BIG MOUSE

96
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,484
(birds chirping)

97
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:46,948
MAYOR CHOI: What are you up to?

98
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,158
What do you think I'm up to?

99
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:52,036
(scoffs)

100
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,372
If you're planning something,
you should quit now.

101
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,375
We're all in the same boat now.

102
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,670
Let's get along.

103
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,508
(scoffs)

104
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,720
(Jihoon laughs)

105
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,308
Gosh. Park Changho, you're something else.

106
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,978
You got invited
to the elder's birthday party.

107
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,439
Not everyone can get invited there.

108
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,566
Well, it's all thanks to you.

109
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,570
Do you want me to give you a gift?

110
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,447
What kind of gift?

111
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:32,034
The 100 billion in funds.
Big Mouse never took it.

112
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,120
(suspenseful music)

113
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:37,081
Are you sure?

114
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:40,293
I'm 100 percent positive.
I checked it myself.

115
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:44,130
If he didn't take it,
where did that money go?

116
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,090
Well...

117
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:49,218
I'm sure it's someone
who knows what's going on internally.

118
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,389
-Are you saying...
-Look for it thoroughly.

119
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:57,018
It could be somewhere
closer than you think.

120
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,604
(music continues)

121
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:03,566
(scoffs)

122
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,164
(door lock buzzes)

123
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,710
(music stops)

124
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,505
VISITATION ROOM

125
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,555
(door closes)

126
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,686
I didn't think you'd come...

127
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,272
to visit.

128
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,317
How are you feeling?

129
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,570
I'm just getting by. But...

130
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,407
are you feeling okay?

131
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,912
Do your gums bleed
when you brush your teeth,

132
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:02,625
or do you suddenly get bloody noses?

133
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,921
You knew, Kwanghyun?

134
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,010
I knew I had leukemia.

135
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:16,305
And that I'm going to die soon.

136
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,808
(ominous music)

137
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:23,437
When the model inmates
went out for work release,

138
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,690
where did you go and what did you do?

139
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,697
It's important.

140
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,616
I need to know,
so that victims like you...

141
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,826
KWANGHYUN: Don't...

142
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,038
Don't do anything.

143
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:45,001
They're scary people.

144
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,795
You'll be in danger.

145
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,549
Don't worry about me and tell me.

146
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,509
What did you do when you went out to work?

147
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,306
(sighs)

148
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,558
I'll go back in now.

149
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:05,980
MIHO: Kwanghyun.

150
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,365
Can I ask you for a favor?

151
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,369
KWANGHYUN:
I can't reach my brother or sister.

152
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,956
Could you find out...

153
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:29,462
if my mom got her...

154
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,091
bone marrow transplant?

155
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,720
(tense music)

156
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:44,810
(door closes)

157
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,408
(pensive music)

158
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,452
(Kikwang sighing)

159
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:04,080
I called from the security office,

160
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,582
and the landlord doesn't know
who Tak Kwanghyun is.

161
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,335
He's his older brother.
The landlord's surname is Tak too.

162
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:12,254
I know. Something's off.

163
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,549
They rented their old place
which was a semi-basement,

164
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,593
but they suddenly moved
to a place like this.

165
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,387
What's the unit number?

166
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,014
It's Unit 2103.

167
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,557
Unit 2103?

168
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:28,145
(suspenseful music)

169
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,064
KIKWANG: What is it?

170
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,696
This is where Unit 2103 parks.

171
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,032
If we wait, he'll come out.

172
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,203
(elevator dings)

173
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:51,627
(car lock beeps)

174
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,131
Dad. Get out.

175
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,841
(grunts)
Okay.

176
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,676
-(car door closes)
-MIHO: Excuse me.

177
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,931
Are you Tak Kwanghyun's family?

178
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:07,643
Hello.
I called you on the intercom earlier.

179
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,729
Damn it.

180
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:13,315
Kwanghyun wanted to know if your mother
had her bone marrow transplant.

181
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,400
Just tell me that.

182
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,446
Do you know how much criticism we endured
because of that psycho?

183
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:21,198
KIKWANG:
We're not here to talk about that.

184
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,117
Just tell us how your mother's doing...

185
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,828
I have nothing to say, so leave.

186
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,123
(scoffs)

187
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,001
MIHO: Wait. Hold on.

188
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,920
Just tell us where the hospital is.
We'll go there ourselves.

189
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,090
My mom passed away.

190
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,634
What?

191
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,553
Just get in!

192
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,473
Don't come here again.

193
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,349
(car door closes)

194
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,893
(engine starts)

195
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,269
(tires screech)

196
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,357
(exhales sharply)

197
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,860
(phone vibrates)

198
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,111
JERRY: Talk to me.

199
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:02,656
They say we're being tailed.

200
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,742
(suspenseful music)

201
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,703
That car wasn't there before.

202
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,581
Yes. They traded places
at the intersection.

203
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,708
SOONTAE: Gosh, those relentless idiots.

204
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,544
They're tailing a car
with three security vehicles watching it.

205
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,171
What should we do?

206
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,924
Let them follow us.

207
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:21,717
Did you hear from Warden Park?

208
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,594
Yes. He's at the store waiting.

209
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,555
SOONTAE: Who do you think sent them?

210
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,350
Choi Doha? Gong Jihoon?

211
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,060
We'll find out soon enough.

212
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,313
(sizzling)

213
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:36,607
MAN 1: Nice.

214
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,734
MAN 2: Gosh.

215
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,654
MAN 3: It smells really great.

216
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,614
MAN 4: Gosh, you look great on camera.

217
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,866
(indistinct chattering)

218
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,284
-MAN 1: Goodness.
-MAN 2: What's this?

219
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,871
(men exclaiming)

220
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,125
(applause)

221
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,795
You're incredible!

222
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,548
Boss, it's so moving.

223
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:04,885
My goodness.
You were born to do teppanyaki, Boss!

224
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,512
(laughter and applause)

225
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:09,515
MEN (chanting): Yang Chunsik!

226
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:12,059
-Yang Chunsik!
-MAN: One more time!

227
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,520
YANG CHUNSIK TEPPANYAKI

228
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,147
(tires screech)

229
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,236
(ominous music)

230
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,320
(car door closes)

231
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,330
(suspenseful music)

232
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,058
(sizzling)

233
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,441
So you want me to eat this?

234
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,067
CHUNSIK: Why?

235
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,695
Well, you're our first.

236
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:07,823
It may look like that,
but it'll taste good. Okay?

237
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:08,908
Try it.

238
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,202
Have a taste!

239
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,248
(playful music)

240
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,343
How does it taste?

241
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,471
-It's good. Right?
-No, no, it's okay...

242
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:31,764
Come here. Isn't it good?

243
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,391
CHUNSIK: Right? Come here. Have some more.

244
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,268
-No, thank you.
-CHUNSIK: Have more.

245
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:39,021
What do you need to talk to me about?

246
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,482
(munching)

247
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,282
(car door closes)

248
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,162
That arrogant jerk.

249
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,708
Park Yoongab just came out.

250
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,711
(keys clacking)

251
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:06,674
(line ringing)

252
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,759
(phone vibrating)

253
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,387
MAYOR CHOI DOHA

254
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,600
What do I owe this pleasure?

255
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,310
I would like to see you.

256
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,438
I have no reason to see you.

257
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,358
It's about Park Changho.

258
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:30,489
If you're not interested, forget it.

259
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,118
Tell me where to go.

260
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,745
I'd like for it to be somewhere discreet.

261
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:39,623
(door closes)

262
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,336
(slurps)

263
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:52,428
Are you drinking in the middle of the day
since your term is almost over?

264
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,139
(suspenseful music)

265
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,475
(drink pouring)

266
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,858
I don't drink.

267
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,901
The people who tried to kill me recently.

268
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,029
Were they sent by Big Mouse?

269
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,281
Did that happen?

270
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,658
I don't watch the news these days.

271
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:15,743
(scoffs)

272
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:16,827
(smacks lips)

273
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,079
Park Changho came to see Chairman Kang.

274
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,382
(tense music)

275
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:36,180
MAYOR CHOI: He said these are
the executives of Big Mouse's gang.

276
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:40,100
Park Changho gave you this?

277
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:44,354
How else would I know the names
of these people aside from you?

278
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,737
(suspenseful music)

279
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:53,697
(gulps)

280
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:55,491
(glass clanks)

281
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:59,828
MAYOR CHOI: The guy who killed the boss
and the guy who betrayed the gang.

282
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,663
You only have one bullet left.

283
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:03,999
Who would you shoot?

284
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,334
I'm not sure.

285
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,712
It's a question that makes me ponder.

286
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:13,717
I would think you would want to put
that bullet into Park Changho's head.

287
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:16,053
If you ask the question
with an answer in mind,

288
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,013
it'll be hard
to continue the conversation.

289
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,265
(laughs)

290
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,976
You came to see me
after hearing Park Changho's name.

291
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,062
Doesn't that mean
you need a reason to kill him?

292
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,024
(paper tears)

293
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,529
YOONGAB: Let me hear the reason.

294
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,155
Why are you doing this to me?

295
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,824
(clicks tongue, inhales sharply)

296
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:39,159
Park Changho keeps getting in my way.

297
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:43,122
If we're after the same thing,
I'd like to work with you.

298
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,875
I'm entering big politics soon.

299
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,129
I believe we'll have a lot
to work on together.

300
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,214
(ominous music)

301
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:01,014
(tense music)

302
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,729
I heard a new guy is Big Mouse.

303
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:09,898
That's Park Changho, right?

304
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,984
(music intensifies)

305
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,530
Due to the first code of the organization,

306
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:19,867
I can never tell you that myself.

307
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,285
(chuckles)

308
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,246
Get rid of Park Changho.

309
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:27,332
I'll watch your back
for the rest of your life.

310
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,419
(Mayor Choi slurps)

311
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,217
GREEN NARAE NURSING HOME

312
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,219
KIKWANG: Sir, look at this photo.

313
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:43,765
Which of these two children
is your grandson?

314
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,645
Sir. Over here.

315
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:51,773
Is this boy on the right Choi Doha?

316
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,778
My gosh.

317
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,198
Words don't get through to him.

318
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:02,910
Dad, do you have floss?

319
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,703
Floss? Why?

320
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:05,996
Give it to me.

321
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:12,294
Sir. Do you want to play
Cat's Cradle with me?

322
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,881
Do you know how to play?

323
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:21,136
(pensive music)

324
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,683
-(Kikwang exclaiming)
-(chuckles)

325
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,144
You're really good at this.

326
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:30,979
It's my turn now.

327
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:34,608
Okay.

328
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,944
Gosh, this one's hard.

329
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,696
(Kikwang exclaims)

330
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:42,115
-(gasps)
-(laughs)

331
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,617
KIKWANG: Goodness.

332
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,119
You're so good.
(laughs)

333
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:47,788
MIHO: Sir.

334
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:51,250
Is your grandson Choi Doha?

335
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,334
(chuckles)

336
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,254
Which boy is it in this photo?

337
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,465
(man muttering)

338
00:20:58,548 --> 00:20:59,883
(chuckles)

339
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,428
MIHO: Then who is this?

340
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,347
Sunghyun.

341
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,431
(laughs)

342
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,766
Cho Sunghyun.

343
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:09,309
(man laughs)

344
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:10,560
Cho Sunghyun?

345
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:13,272
Cho Haesoo,
the lab director of NK Chemical.

346
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:14,731
His grandson was Cho Sunghyun.

347
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:17,317
(gasps softly)

348
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:24,157
Then which one of these boys drowned?

349
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,827
(sobbing)

350
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:27,953
He died.

351
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,707
MAN: My grandson died.

352
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,001
Doha...

353
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,962
drowned.

354
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,797
(sobbing continues)

355
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,550
MAN: Doha.

356
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,970
My grandson.

357
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,724
My poor grandson.

358
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,892
(suspenseful music)

359
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,478
-He died.
-KIKWANG: This boy, Cho Sunghyun,

360
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:56,690
is the grandson of NK Chemical's
lab director, Cho Haesoo,

361
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:58,317
and he apparently drowned to death.

362
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:03,530
But the boy that really died was
Mr. Choi's grandson, Choi Doha.

363
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:06,908
So that means Cho Sunghyun
became Choi Doha.

364
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:08,952
KIKWANG: He changed his identity.

365
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,330
Cho Haesoo and Chairman Kang were friends.

366
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,541
MIHO: He spoke about the dangers of NF9,

367
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:16,752
and he suddenly committed suicide
without a reason.

368
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:19,963
KIKWANG: It's highly likely
that Chairman Kang killed him.

369
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:24,301
The fact that Choi Doha changed his
identity to stay by the Chairman's side...

370
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:25,802
He wants revenge.

371
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:27,721
There's no other reason.

372
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,515
(tense music)

373
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,393
(lock beeps, clanks)

374
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,365
WILL
TESTATOR: KANG SUNGGEUN

375
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,158
Sir.

376
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:49,743
Come in.

377
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:56,333
CHA: Your son...

378
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,170
sent a gift for your birthday
from the States.

379
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,174
There's no need to open it. Throw it out.

380
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:06,259
(suspenseful music)

381
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:12,933
Do you have no intention
of giving your son your inheritance?

382
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,854
(tense music)

383
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,198
(eerie music)

384
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,334
ELDER: That kid...

385
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,170
isn't human. He's the devil.

386
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,761
My biggest regret

387
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,181
is that I couldn't kill him myself
being my own son.

388
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:57,519
Even if I die,
don't let him come to Korea.

389
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:00,313
(tense music)

390
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:05,569
(safe lock beeps)

391
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:10,991
REPORTER: There are two days left
to register as a candidate

392
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:12,784
for the Gucheon mayor election.

393
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:15,704
According to surveys, Democratic People's
Party candidate, Lee Changsub,

394
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:19,249
has an approval rating of close
to 40 percent and is in first place.

395
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:22,836
Park Changho, who became an issue
for defending Big Mouse,

396
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:26,047
is ranked last
among the current candidates.

397
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,800
Experts say that Park Changho
is good for creating an issue,

398
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,260
but that alone isn't enough...

399
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,848
Wait. Why did Big Mouse make Changho
run for mayor and make a fool of himself?

400
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:36,349
He should let him quit.

401
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:38,560
You never know.
He could win since he's famous.

402
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,145
He's in last place.

403
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:42,355
His approval rating is seven percent.
There's no way.

404
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:45,859
It's Warden Park.

405
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,445
Does he have plans with Changho?

406
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:50,822
No, I wasn't told anything.

407
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,700
(suspenseful music)

408
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:57,287
If he changed his identity,
that means Choi Doha

409
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:59,873
is after Chairman Kang's position.

410
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:02,834
From Chairman Kang's position,
he's holding a ticking time bomb.

411
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,920
(ominous music)

412
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:09,174
(phone vibrates)

413
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,011
(phone clicks)

414
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,264
CHANGHO: Go to the nursing home
and bring that old man out.

415
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,557
And do it quietly.

416
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,019
(door opens)

417
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,522
(tense music)

418
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,443
(door closes)

419
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:31,613
(door opens)

420
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,117
(door closes)

421
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,120
Are you going to expose Choi Doha?

422
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,747
It's Chairman Kang's birthday party.

423
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,917
I can't miss an opportunity like this.
Everything's been set.

424
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,128
Warden Park seems disgruntled these days.
Should I go with him?

425
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,881
If we don't trust them,
they won't trust us either.

426
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:51,508
Don't worry.

427
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,219
(suspenseful music)

428
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,571
GREEN NARAE NURSING HOME

429
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,740
(tense music)

430
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,296
(clangs)

431
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,090
(groans)

432
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:36,011
(tense music)

433
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,570
(engine revs)

434
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,532
(music stops)

435
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:04,539
CHANGHO: Miho, are you ready yet?

436
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,041
I'm almost done. Give me a minute.

437
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,546
Can you zip me up?

438
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,842
(dramatic music)

439
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:17,927
(zipper zips)

440
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:22,682
What do you think? Do I look pretty?
I took extra care choosing it.

441
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,978
What is it? Don't leave me hanging.

442
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:28,647
Just spit out that I'm pretty already.

443
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,566
Aren't you showing too much skin?

444
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,818
MIHO (scoffs): You're so frustrating.

445
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:36,946
Everyone who's anyone will be there.
This is the least I could wear.

446
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:39,074
Let's go. We don't have time.

447
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,159
I was a fool to ask you.

448
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,371
(Changho sighs)

449
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:47,540
It's because you're too pretty.
I'm worried everyone will stare at you.

450
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,084
(Miho chuckles)

451
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:53,713
But is it really necessary
for us to act as double agents?

452
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:54,881
(phone vibrating)

453
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:55,965
Hold on.

454
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,762
Hey. What happened?

455
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,223
I'm here.

456
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:05,725
I'll be right there. Wait for me.

457
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:10,313
(ominous music)

458
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,866
(gun clicks)

459
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,035
(tense music)

460
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,756
(music fades)

461
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,676
You want me to go to the party alone?

462
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:42,011
When you get there,
Gong Jihoon will help you.

463
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:43,763
What is it?

464
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:44,973
It's important.

465
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,726
I'm sorry, Miho.
I'll explain everything later.

466
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:53,773
(dance music playing)

467
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:56,526
(indistinct chattering)

468
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:01,698
LIFE STARTS AT 85
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, CHAIRMAN KANG

469
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,159
ASHLEY KIM: Honey. Don't I look pretty?

470
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,660
-Do I look pretty?
-Honey. You do.

471
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,579
-Hi.
-Enjoy your conversation.

472
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:08,705
Hi.

473
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:12,876
How could someone like Park Changho
join the NR Forum?

474
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:16,337
The fact that someone like him
could become mayor of Gucheon

475
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,630
is even worse.

476
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:20,091
If we're going to send out a candidate,

477
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:23,094
isn't Prosecutor Choi a better option?

478
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:28,016
Honestly, I'm confident
that I could do better than Park Changho.

479
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:31,686
It may be mayor, but the position
is nothing more than being a human shield.

480
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:34,147
It's nothing to envy.

481
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,315
(sighs)

482
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:40,487
I heard the audit report was incredible.
Everyone's complimenting you.

483
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,655
JUHEE (chuckles): You're too kind.

484
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:44,866
I'm just starting to get used to the work.

485
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,034
(mutters, laughs)

486
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,828
It's taking too long
to abolish the special bill.

487
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:51,831
Right. It's because the other side
is strongly opposing it.

488
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:54,042
You should put in a good word, Mayor Choi.

489
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,877
He's very upset about it.

490
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,047
You must get it abolished
within the current fiscal year.

491
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,174
Okay.

492
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,385
-JUHEE: Please take good care of it.
-MAN: Of course. Let's do that.

493
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,678
(laughter)

494
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,932
Over there.

495
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,101
(indistinct chattering)

496
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,274
JIHOON (chuckles): Ms. Ko Miho.

497
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:21,861
Hello. Welcome.

498
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,696
Thank you for inviting us.

499
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,324
No problem. Mr. Park called me.

500
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:28,243
-I'll escort you. This way.
-Okay.

501
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,082
MAN: Chairman Kang has arrived.

502
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,167
(indistinct murmurs)

503
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,794
-JIHOON: Here he comes.
-MAN: He's here.

504
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:40,964
(applause)

505
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:45,552
-GUESTS: Happy birthday, Mr. Chairman.
-Happy birthday.

506
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,222
(classical music playing)

507
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:58,314
JIHOON:
This is Attorney Park Changho's wife.

508
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,691
Say hello.

509
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,360
Nice to meet you, sir. My name is Ko Miho.

510
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:06,155
Changho had to take care of something
for a client, so he couldn't come.

511
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,659
Mr. Park is very competent.

512
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:11,744
He has such a beautiful woman for a wife.

513
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:13,329
(chuckles)

514
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:14,414
Thank you.

515
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,499
You're quite handsome too, sir.

516
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,459
(laughs)

517
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:22,213
(phone vibrating)

518
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,131
PARK YOONGAB

519
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:24,799
Give me a minute.

520
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,510
(vibrating continues)

521
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:31,598
Go.

522
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:33,308
YOONGAB: Park Changho will die soon.

523
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,393
(tense music)

524
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,732
(laughing)

525
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:51,117
(music continues)

526
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:04,213
(music stops)

527
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:06,299
(classical music playing)

528
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,928
There's something special about Mr. Park.

529
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:12,722
Thank you for seeing him in a good light.

530
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:16,351
ELDER: How will you support him, Ms. Ko?

531
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:19,854
If you like my answer,

532
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,482
will you be able to help Changho
with his campaign for mayor?

533
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:25,443
I haven't seen any politician get far
without good support from their wife.

534
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,363
(clears throat)

535
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:29,822
This is between us.

536
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:36,079
I was the one who made Changho
who he is today.

537
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,416
What do you mean?

538
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,877
I supported him while he studied
and made him into a lawyer.

539
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,755
He was in prison until recently,

540
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:47,715
but now he's a candidate for mayor.

541
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,926
This is a true story of rags to riches.

542
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:51,844
Wouldn't you agree I made him
who he is today?

543
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:54,931
(laughs)

544
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,060
I guess I asked a silly question.

545
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:01,437
(laughter)

546
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,232
JUHEE: She's so pretentious.

547
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:08,027
Not too long ago, she was digging
into NK Chemical's corruptions.

548
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:10,571
(phone vibrating)

549
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:15,702
What happened?

550
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,623
-Stay here for a bit.
-What's wrong?

551
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:22,667
It's nothing. I'll be back soon.

552
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,671
(suspenseful music)

553
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:28,923
(door opens)

554
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:32,760
(door closes)

555
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:41,978
ASSOCIATE: Everything's ready.

556
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:44,188
(music intensifies)

557
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,405
(exhales sharply)

558
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:54,490
(ominous music)

559
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:55,992
Can you see me clearly?

560
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:59,829
(tense music)

561
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:09,756
(smirks)

562
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:10,882
Wine.

563
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:14,969
(tense music)

564
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,681
-(banging inside trunk)
-(beeps)

565
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:22,518
(music stops)

566
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:24,687
(grunts)

567
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,983
(grunting)

568
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,323
(ominous music)

569
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,033
(grunts)

570
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:48,836
CHANGHO: Who's behind this?

571
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:50,671
Choi Doha?

572
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:52,840
Mayor Choi.

573
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:56,094
Do you have any final words for him?

574
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:00,515
(grunts)

575
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:03,559
(tense music)

576
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,437
(sighs)

577
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,022
You traitor.

578
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,816
I'm not the traitor.

579
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:12,151
The organization betrayed me.

580
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:15,029
YOONGAB:
You have no idea how long I've been loyal.

581
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,864
Choi Doha killed your boss.

582
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,157
Wake up, Park Yoongab!

583
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:22,495
(line ringing)

584
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:23,704
(door handle clicks)

585
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,125
OPERATOR: The call cannot be connected...

586
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:28,668
BOSS

587
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,170
I think that's enough salt.

588
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:33,172
(sizzling)

589
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,644
Here. Try it.

590
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:48,396
Go ahead.

591
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:51,858
No, you're the elder here.
Please, eat first.

592
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:53,901
-Good luck!
-Good luck!

593
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:58,114

595
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,451
Hey, Jerry.

596
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,162
JERRY: Park Yoongab betrayed us.

597
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:05,913
What?

598
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:07,915
Boss is in danger.

599
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:10,126
MAN: He's coming out.

600
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:14,714
YANG CHUNSIK TEPPANYAKI

601
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:15,923
Do you have your gear?

602
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,550
MEN: Yes, Boss!

603

(tense music)

608
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,988
You can't trust Choi Doha.

609
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,741
You'll end up like me too.

610
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,291
Let's end it.

611

YOONGAB: Did you see it?

628
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:11,247
Just as you've requested,
I killed Park Changho by my hand.

629

Hey.

636
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:43,279
The elder is leaving.

Yes, Jerry?

JERRY (panting): Changho...

650

(exhales)

656
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,260

kill Changho.

00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:10,783
(pants)

663
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:21,043
(footsteps approaching)

664
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,089
You bastard...

665
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:29,260
I'm going to kill you!

666
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,554
I'm going to kill you!

667
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:34,306
(sobbing)

668
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,434
(breathing heavily)

669
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,310
You killed my husband.

670
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:41,981
What is that woman doing?

671
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:44,358
MIHO: You killed my husband!

672
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,028
You killed him!

673
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:51,782
You killed my husband!

674
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,075
MIHO (sobbing): You killed him.

675
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:55,453
You killed him!

676
00:40:56,787 --> 00:41:00,583
You killed my husband.

677
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,460
You killed my...

678
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:06,797
You killed him!

679
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,424
(tires screeching)

680
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,474
(somber music swells)

681
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:26,275
JIHOON: Miho. Are you okay?

682
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:29,069
(music stops)

683
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,951
(snickers)

684
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,998
(laughing)

685
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,462
(suspenseful music)

686
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:50,466
(laughing continues)

687
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:02,937
YOONGAB: Welcome.

688
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:08,943
(snickering)

689
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,321
YOONGAB: The old man is somewhere safe.

690
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:14,073
Take him with you when you go.

691
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:15,366
Where's Park Changho's body?

692
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:18,410
It's in the incinerator
behind this building.

693
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,331
Didn't you see the smoke when you came in?

694
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,085
Can I check?

695
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:27,920
YOONGAB: Go ahead.

696
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:31,131
He's nothing more
than a pile of ash by now.

697
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,717
(laughs)

698
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:34,843
Good job.

699
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,763
YOONGAB:
How did you hold it in all this time?

700
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:40,766
Your patience is amazing.

701
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:45,646
I know that it's not something
anyone can do.

702
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:49,942
You hid it deep within your heart
and waited for the right time.

703
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:55,197
If it were me, I would've wanted to kill
Chairman Kang over a hundred times.

704
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:59,034
If that were the case,
I wouldn't have made such a hard decision.

705
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:02,621
That's true. Chairman Kang has a lot,
so just killing him wouldn't...

706
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:05,040
-That's enough.
-Sunghyun, was it?

707
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,460
Cho Sunghyun.

708
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,546
Your name as a child.

709
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,673
You...

710
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:15,134
should watch your mouth.

711
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:18,387
(ominous music)

712
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:23,100
MAYOR CHOI: Be sure to clean everything up
without a trace.

713
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:27,229
YOONGAB:
You don't need to worry about that.

714
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,402
(sighs heavily)

715
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:36,363
Turn it off.

716
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:40,576
(remote beeps)

717
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:42,661
(tense music)

718
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:51,170
Do you remember a boy named Cho Sunghyun?

719
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:53,922
Of course, I do.

720
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,217
He was like my own grandson.

721
00:43:58,469 --> 00:43:59,970
What will you do?

722
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,430
(music stops)

723
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:03,932
I'll take care of it in my own way.

724
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:06,310
Keep this a secret.

725
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:08,312
Yes, sir.

726
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:10,606
You can go.

727
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:14,818
Thank you.

728
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:20,240
Whatever it is you want,
you will get it. I promise you that.

729
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:23,994
Thank you, sir.

730
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:32,044
(door opens)

731
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:35,798
(door closes)

732
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:38,133
(ominous music)

733
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:45,724
Tell Doha to come.

734
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:47,101
Yes, sir.

735
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:57,403
(phone vibrating)

736
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:03,367
Hello?

737
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:12,334
(music stops)

738
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:17,923
CHANGHO: Where's Miho?

739
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:19,174
SOONTAE: What happened to you?

740
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,510
Let's talk later.

741
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:24,930
You should've given me a heads-up.

742
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:27,015
(sighs)
You don't trust Park Yoongab.

743
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:28,434
Would you have agreed if you knew?

744
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:31,103
And if Park Yoongab betrayed you...

745
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:34,148
Choi Doha is done for.
Chairman Kang is on my side.

746
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:35,941
That's all we needed.

747
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:37,484
CHANGHO: Let's talk later.

748
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:39,570
(door opens)

749
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:41,697
Father-in-law.

750
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,282
What happened?

751
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:46,577
She was in shock
after hearing that you died.

752
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:50,706
I'm sorry. I couldn't answer my phone.

753
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:52,332
My gosh, you...

754
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,043
Mr. Ko. Let's go.

755
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:57,087
(Kikwang sighs)

756
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:59,173
(somber music)

757
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:03,427
When Miho wakes up, bring her home.

758
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:05,220
Yes, sir.

759
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,947
(heart monitor beeping)

760
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:30,746
(dramatic music)

761
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:32,539
(gasps)

762
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:36,043
Miho. Are you awake?

763
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:38,837
(whimpers)

764
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:43,842
(breathing shakily)

765
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:45,385
What happened?

766
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:48,472
(Miho exhales)

767
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:51,850
How could you surprise me
over something like this?

768
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:54,978
I'm sorry.
I wanted to take care of it quietly.

769
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:58,690
Jerry didn't have the full story.

770
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:00,776
Do you know how surprised I was...

771
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,904
when I heard that you were dead?

772
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:06,448
How could I die and leave you?

773
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:08,367
(crying)

774
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,327
I'm sorry. I really am.

775
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:14,498
(crying)

776
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:19,795
(Miho exhales)

777
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:23,048
Tell me what happened.

778
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:28,554
It was a ploy.

779
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:34,226
If we're after the same thing,
I'd like to work with you.

780
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:35,519
Get rid of Park Changho.

781
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:38,564
(tense music)

782
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:41,525
PARK CHANGHO

783
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:42,776
(line ringing)

784
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,069
He fell for it.

785
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:45,445
YOONGAB: Resent No Park.

786
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,030
(gunshot)

787
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:48,615
(yelps, laughs)

788
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,033
YOONGAB: Did you see it?

789
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:53,912
Just as you've requested,
I killed Park Changho by my hand.

790
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,455
MAYOR CHOI: What about the body?

791
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,332
Let's discuss the specifics
when you get here.

792
00:47:58,542 --> 00:47:59,543
(phone beeps)

793
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:03,297
(Yoongab sighs)

794
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,506
You can get up now.

795
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:07,509
(tense music)

796
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,304
(bone cracking)

797
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:16,226
(music intensifies)

798
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:21,940
All that's left is getting Choi Doha
up on stage.

799
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:28,739
(music fades)

800
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:31,325
ELDER: Doha's late.

801
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:35,329
CHA: There must be some traffic.

802
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:41,627
Sunghyun's grandfather,

803
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:44,463
Haesoo.

804
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:48,050
He was like a brother to me.

805
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:51,637
ELDER: We ran into a problem

806
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:55,349
just before getting the patent for NF9.

807
00:48:56,433 --> 00:49:00,020
He said he would expose it.

808
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,107
The development of a new substance
was right before our eyes,

809
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,026
so I couldn't back down.

810
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:08,111
(suspenseful music)

811
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:10,405
The future of our nation depended on it.

812
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,242
I chose my country...

813
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,245
over my friend.

814
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:22,376
It remained as a regret.

815
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:27,089
Perhaps, this is my last chance.

816
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:30,801
(groaning)

817
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:33,804
The sin of killing my friend...

818
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:36,682
I would like to...

819
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,685
beg for forgiveness from his bloodline.

820
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:44,022
(elder groaning)

821
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:47,317
(gurgling)

822
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:48,819
MAYOR CHOI: It's too late.

823
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,321
(suspenseful music)

824
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:06,461
Everything you've enjoyed until now.

825
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:10,048
Wealth, fame, honor...

826
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:14,261
None of it was yours from the start.

827
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:20,392
It was something my grandfather, his son,

828
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:23,395
and I should have enjoyed.

829
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:25,355
(gasps)

830
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:28,734

My grandfather passed away more painfully.

00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:01,266
He couldn't even let out a scream
as he died.

My goodness, you...

887
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:35,021
I was told my son-in-law was dead.
Of course, I was enraged.

Why isn't Chairman Kang
doing anything yet?

Good question.
It's about time we heard Doha's screams.

00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:00,463
Hold on. Take a look at that.

passed away this afternoon
at the age of 85.

Let me tell you more specifically...

901
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:15,562
KIKWANG: How could it be a heart attack
at a time like this?

902
00:55:16,354 --> 00:55:19,858
The scream came from Chairman Kang,
not Choi Doha.

903
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:22,068
It was revealed he passed away
from cardiac arrest.

904
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:24,779
He's the first developer
of the substance NF9...

I'm sure he did. He's very thorough.

Legally speaking,
his son in the States will get it.

But knowing the chairman,

953
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:13,615
he'd never leave it
to that serial murderer.

Bingo.

955
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:18,369
There's no way he'd leave it all
to Hyun Juhee. Right?

Gosh, I'm curious.

What do you mean?

963

He was healthy when he was with me.

If he didn't kill him, he'd die himself.

JERRY: From the outside,
it looks like any other fish farm,

1003
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:30,431
but security is intense.

CHANGHO: Since it turned out this way,

1011
01:03:43,736 --> 01:03:46,113
I'll turn this election
into Choi Doha's grave.
