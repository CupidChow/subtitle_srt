"MY STRENGTH COMES FROM MY ABDOMEN."
BRUCE LEE (1940-1973)

2
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:19,552
THE FIRST DAY OF SECOND TRAINING
AT ANCHOVY PHYSICAL CAMP

3
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:25,125
THE FIRST ANCHOVY TO ARRIVE

4
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:29,329
CHOI DANIEL

5
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,031
I didn't feel good after last week.

6
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:32,866
My body ached so much.

7
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:34,901
Did you get an IV?

8
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:38,772
IV therapy? It wasn't that bad.

9
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:40,673
Are you wearing makeup today?

10
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:43,977
Well, I just put on
some foundation by myself.

11
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,211
"SELF-MAKEUP"

12
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:48,381
I stopped by a salon before coming
last time, but it was useless.

13
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:49,816
It's meaningless.

14
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,585
You know, for <i>Anchovy Physical Camp,</i>

15
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:54,721
one's appearances or looks
aren't important.

16
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:56,723
It's raining.

17
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,525
You start by making us laugh
with your face.

18
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:00,827
I'm not wearing any makeup today.

19
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,430
Were you okay
after all the push-ups last time?

20
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:05,932
I was in the worst freaking condition.

21
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,635
It felt like my arm muscles were torn,

22
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:10,437
and it lasted for a week.

23
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,506
You have to raise your arm
when you're showering, right?

24
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,741
Well, I couldn't.

25
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:15,942
So I had to shower like this.

26
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:20,547
I'm telling you, I looked pathetic.

27
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:23,683
You weren't able to win
an anchovy keychain last time.

28
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,751
I will today.

29
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:25,819
Can you guess the mission?

30
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:27,654
LOOKING AROUND

31
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:31,825
THE PLACE FOR TODAY'S MISSION
LOOKS SOMEWHAT SPOOKY

32
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:34,494
Are we burying someone today?

33
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,464
Seriously, I have a bad feeling.

34
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,667
I feel like
we might not be able to leave today.

35
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:43,002
Is this the entrance?

36
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:45,405
-This is the entrance.
-I think you're right.

37
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,174
Do all the villagers know

38
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:49,976
that people are going to die in here?

39
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:53,580
The villagers need to know
that people will be dying here today.

40
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:55,081
WELCOME TO THE ANCHOVY PHYSICAL CAMP

41
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:57,917
Let me explain today's mission.

42
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,286
Here's the second mission

43
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:02,322
of Anchovy Physical Camp.

44
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:03,523
I don't want to hear about it.

45
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:05,358
Today's mission…

46
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:06,893
Please. Come on.

47
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:08,928
…is an individual battle.

48
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:10,296
It's an individual one?

49
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:12,098
So everyone's on their own?

50
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:13,900
You must complete the task
allotted to each of you

51
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,568
to complete the mission.

52
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,370
And even if you complete
your individual task,

53
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:18,972
you cannot go home.

54
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:22,475
The second mission where each of you
has to complete your individual task.

55
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:23,943
Where are we?

56
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,879
-A vacation home.
-A vacation home?

57
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:27,981
A house. The living room.

58
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:31,618
Today's mission is known to be
a home workout exercise for men.

59
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:33,953
A home workout exercise?

60
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:36,623
It's the well-known home workout, sit-ups.

61
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,358
I've never done it.

62
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:40,527
You must do 4,000 sit-ups.

63
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:41,761
-Come on.
-What?

64
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,631
-Come on.
-What?

65
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:48,201
-What?
-Come on. 4,000 sit-ups is impossible.

66
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:49,869
-Are you serious?
-Seriously. I mean it.

67
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:52,105
At this rate, you'll make us do
10,000 in two weeks.

68
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,306
Sit-ups are…

69
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:54,874
-What is this?
-If you do too many sit-ups,

70
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:57,243
-this is what happens when you wake up.
-You can't get up.

71
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,013
You can't get up like this.
You have to roll up like this.

72
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:02,248
"THIS IS HOW
THESE GUYS WILL GET UP TOMORROW"

73
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:04,317
You have to get up like this, you know?

74
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:06,052
-Hold on.
-You can't get up.

75
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,954
First, fix your ankles here.

76
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,722
Don't raise your elbows.

77
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:11,858
Just rest your hands on your shoulders

78
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:13,593
and touch your knees like this.

79
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,495
And when you go down,

80
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,931
just let your shoulder blades
lightly touch the floor.

81
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:21,134
That counts as one sit-up.

82
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,635
You have 12 hours.

83
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:23,937
Your mission begins now.

84
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:27,073
-Okay.
-We got this.

85
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,808
Why don't we just try a few first?

86
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,977
-I'll go first.
-DinDin, just tell us now.

87
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,645
-Are you confident in this?
-I actually am.

88
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,415
-Can you do this better than push-ups?
-I have bad push-up posture.

89
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:37,250
But I have good sit-up posture.

90
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:40,553
IN THE LAST PUSH-UP MISSION

91
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,788
This is bad.

92
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:45,458
DINDIN REACHED HIS LIMIT TOO EARLY

93
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:49,729
I'll make up for
last time's failures today.

94
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:50,997
That'd be good.

95
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,198
Let's give it a try first.

96
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:53,266
One.

97
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:54,667
Two.

98
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,035
-You do it easily.
-Three.

99
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:58,838
-Four.
-Good. You're stable!

100
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,474
-Five. Six.
-We can count on you.

101
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:03,343
Ten.

102
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,844
"HE FINISHED 10 IN NO TIME"

103
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,279
Oh, you're doing more?

104
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:07,714
More?

105
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:09,782
-Two.
-Hey, man.

106
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,351
-Don't overdo it.
-Three.

107
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,253
-He sure is good.
-Four.

108
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:15,922
-Eight.
-He's different from last time.

109
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:16,990
-Damn.
-Nine.

110
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:18,057
Praise me more.

111
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:21,828
He feeds off of attention.

112
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:23,830
I have a good feeling today.

113
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:25,698
-Hey, hey, hey!
-Okay.

114
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,867
-I have a good feeling. I'm confident.
-All right!

115
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:28,935
"DINDIN IS DIFFERENT TODAY"

116
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,737
-I'm confident.
-You've got to do it.

117
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,539
-I'll make up for last time.
-You can do it.

118
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:35,575
Let's do ten sit-ups each.

119
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:37,043
-Ten?
-Okay, let's do it.

120
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,211
-Let's go.
-I'll give it a go.

121
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,280
You see, the thing about working out…

122
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:42,282
-You know those energy boosting foods?
-Yeah.

123
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:43,950
There's no need for that.
You need to boost your mind.

124
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,285
-Boost your mind?
-Yes, the mind.

125
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:46,853
-Okay, okay, okay.
-It's all about your mind.

126

Let's go, let's go.

Let's get it, let's get it.

130
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:59,299
One. Two.

131
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,301
Three.

132
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:04,170
Four. Five.

133
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:05,638

-Ten.

135
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,174

Good!

138
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,945
He's picking up momentum.

139
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:15,248
"THE COUNT STEADILY INCREASES
AS HE SHOUTS"

140
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,349
Why is he so good?

00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,617
Stop. Stop, stop!

142
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:18,685
You did 40!

"POSSESSED"

144
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,693
It's as if
we're visiting one of those tribes.

00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,562

PREPARING FOR A CEREMONY

Let's get it.

149
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:42,775
Four.

150
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:44,577
Five.

151
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:46,145

"HE SEEMS TO BE SEEING THINGS"

You can stop anytime if it gets too tough.

00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:53,152
You can stop anytime.

TONGUE TRILLS

-Good.
-Okay, okay!

161
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,837
You have done 400 sit-ups.

162
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:12,338
That wasn't too bad. We had a good start.

163
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:15,675
In this game, you can have
a maximum of 400 sit-ups deducted.

164
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:17,777
-That means 100 each, right?
-Yeah.

165
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,646
You'll try it one by one,
and only those who succeed

166
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,382
-will get 100 deducted.
-Okay.

167
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:24,317
This game to test your adhesive strength…

168
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,385
-What?
-What?

169
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:27,854
…is par terre.

170
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,955
Par terre?

171
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:31,491
It's a wrestling position

172
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:34,560
where one attacks
the other on the ground from above.

173
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:36,262
The game will be one-on-one.

174
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:39,665
You'll be up against our staff member,
and if you hold for 30 seconds,

175
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:40,733
you succeed.

176
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,034
Okay, okay.

177
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:44,036
Jonathan, the way I see it,

178
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:45,671
you have the biggest chance in this.

179
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,273
Do I just need to lie down?

180
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,875
You need to hold it
so that they can't roll you over.

181
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:51,043
Actually, having long limbs
would work to an advantage.

182
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,745
-Say you're down on the ground like this.
-Okay.

183
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:53,946
If the opponent wants
to roll you over this way,

184
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:55,348
then you have to hold out like this.

185
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,416
-I see.
-Try it.

186
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:58,885
If they try to flip you the other way,
you need to hold out like this.

187
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:00,420
-You get how it works, right?
-Yes.

188
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:01,754
I'll go first and show you.

189
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:04,157
-We're lighter, so we go first.
-Yes, you and me.

190
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:05,691
-Then Daniel and Jonathan.
-Okay.

191
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,961
Now, the staff's player,
Red Boy, please come on out.

192
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:10,129
"Red Boy"?

193
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:11,764
RED BOY?

194
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,901
TAKING IT OFF

195
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:17,904
What?

196
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:26,112
-What?
-Oh no.

197
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,682
Oh, so he's Red Boy?

198
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:30,950
Gosh, this guy.

199
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:32,885
-Wow, look at his body.
-No way.

200
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:34,454
"THICK"

201
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,755
But he's…

202
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:38,524
I think the floor shook
when he walked over.

203
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:40,593
"RED BOY (HE'S ALWAYS RED)"

204
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,229
-His arms…
-Have you ever

205
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,097
-trained judo?
-When I was young.

206
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:46,499
No way. I'm not buying that.

207
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,968
I'm sure he was a judoka, but quit.

208
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:50,903
I'm sure of it.

209
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,338
I'll go first and show you

210
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:53,506
-how it's going to be.
-Okay.

211
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,108
DINDIN, THE WEAKEST ANCHOVY, GIVES IT A GO

212
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,046
STUDYING HIS PREY

213
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:04,750
THE PREY IS NERVOUS

214
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:10,356
Look how big his hands are.

215
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:13,659
Ready.

216
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:14,760
Please.

217
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:15,828
Show us.

218
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:17,597
Set, go!

219
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:24,070
"THROWN IN 5 SECONDS"

220
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:26,272
He's holding on… What?

221
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,406
"DAMN IT"

222
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:29,976
-Fail!
-Don't go easy on him.

223
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:32,311
-He plays dirty.
-What do you mean?

224
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:33,980
-He tried to break my arm.
-How?

225
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:36,215
He put his arm here and put on his weight.

226
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:37,650
I just rolled fearing my arm might break.

227
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:44,323
-You see, he knows his par terre.
-He does.

228
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,492
That's why he was so calm earlier.

229
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:49,262
He threw you effortlessly.

230
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,230
Hold on.

231
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,733
Maybe you're supposed to block him
from putting his arm in.

232
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,335
We shouldn't let him put his arm in.

233
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:59,338
You main players come up with a strategy.

234
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:01,941
You need to block his arm
when he tries to put it in.

235
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,976
Move like a pond skater.

236
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:05,745
"LIKE A POND SKATER?"

237
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:06,812
Ready.

238
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:08,614
Set, go!

239
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,217
Can I crawl this way?

240
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:12,818
Don't let his arm in!

241
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:16,489
THE POND SKATER GETS CAUGHT IN NO TIME

242
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:20,960
DEFENDING WITH HIS RIGHT ARM

243
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:23,195
BUT HE CHANGES DIRECTION RIGHT AWAY

244
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,568
O3OHN FAILS TO GET DEDUCTION

245
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,503
SHOCKED

246
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,272
I told you, he's a professional!

247
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:35,141
I told you he used to be a judoka!

248
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:36,375
Are you okay, O3ohn?

249
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:38,077
-You held out once.
-Yes.

250
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:40,046
But he changed direction really fast.

251
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:41,814
He changed it right away.

252
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:42,882
Goodness.

253
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:44,650
It's not easy.

254
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,419
-You need to hold out.
-I don't think I can.

255
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:49,455
-Tire him out as much as possible.
-Next player, please get ready.

256
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:50,723
Gosh this is…

257
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,493
"IT TURNS SERIOUS WITH DANIEL,
THE HEAVIER PLAYER"

258
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:58,598
Since you're quite heavy,
I think you can hold out for a while.

259
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,435
"I'M JUST AS HEAVY AS HE IS!"

260
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:06,872
Set, go!

261
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,941
-Good. Hold it out!
-He's not giving up.

262
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,476
Don't let his arms in!

263
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:15,581
HE IMMEDIATELY ENGAGES HIS ARMS

264
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:19,919
THEN ENGAGES HIS LEGS

265
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:23,055
BUT DANIEL HOLDS OUT!

266
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,423
Yes, that's it! That's it!

267
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,392
Yes, good! Yes, that's the way!

268
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,760
HE ESCAPES THE FIRST ATTACK!

269
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:29,895
HE STANDS A CHANCE!

270
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,331
-Good!
-Yes, that's the way!

271
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,700
RED BOY ATTEMPTS TO ENGAGE HIS LEGS AGAIN

272
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:36,902
HE PUTS STRENGTH ON HIS LEFT LEG

273
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,271
AND HE CHANGES DIRECTION!

274
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:46,946
Daniel, you did well.

275
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:48,748
"HE HELD FOR 12 SECONDS BUT FAILED"

276
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,316
All right.

277
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,287
WHAT IS HIS DEAL?

278
00:10:58,591 --> 00:10:59,659
WIMPED OUT

279
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,494
We've tired him out a bit.

280
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,429
STRONGMAN JONATHAN, THEIR LAST HOPE

281
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,531
WOW…

282
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:09,168
-What?
-He saw you and was like, "Wow."

283
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,369
He sighed.

284
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:16,942
You got this!

285
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,944
Here we go.

286
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,012
Ready.

287
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,085
Set, go!

288
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:28,721
Good, good! You're doing well, Jonathan!

289
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:29,989
-Good, Jonathan!
-Hold it out!

290
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:34,493
"IT'LL BE OVER THE MOMENT HE GRABS ON!"

291
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:37,697
-That's it, Jonathan!
-Nice! Let's go!

292
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:39,965
-Nice! Let's go!
-That's it, Jonathan!

293
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:45,404
HE TWISTS HIS BODY QUICKLY

294
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:46,906
AND TRIES TO TURN OVER THE CORE

295
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:51,377
-Let's go!
-Good!

296
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:56,215
"JONATHAN COUNTERACTS
RED BOY'S FORCE AND HOLDS OUT"

297
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:57,349
Hold it out!

298
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,319
RED BOY ATTACKS AGAIN

299
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,590
HE TWISTS HIS BODY AND ESCAPES AGAIN!

300
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:07,793
Wow.

301
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:10,763
HE IMMEDIATELY CLIMBS ON TOP

302
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:14,700
BUT JONATHAN HOLDS OUT AGAIN

303
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:17,369

00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,074

Isn't it over? 30 seconds, 30 seconds!

306
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,246
How many seconds?

307
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:31,250
HOLD IT OUT, JONATHAN!

308
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:32,785
OH! OH!

309
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:34,086
Good! Hey!

315
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,700

317
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:52,238
Wow.

318
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:54,507
That was incredible.

319
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,576
This looks like a scene from <i>Get Out!</i>

320
00:12:58,644 --> 00:12:59,645
<i>How did you block him?</i>

321
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:01,147
<i>I'm Jonathan, after all.</i>

322
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:03,215
I read his muscles.
So when his right muscle moved,

323
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,283
I flipped the opposite way.

324
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:07,019
If the left one moved,
I flipped the other way.

325
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:09,722
I kept doing that.

326
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:11,724

It's freaking easy then.

Seriously?

338
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,414

-Let's go, O3ohn.
-Okay, okay.

BAM!

537
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:49,815
I actually smash and eat watermelon
like that every summer.

538
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:52,751
I only found out today that
people use a knife to eat a watermelon.

539
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:54,953
Don't you just hit it like this to eat it?

540
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,657
Well, I use my fist to eat most fruits.

541
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,260
Now, including the deduction,

542
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:03,028
I'll tell you your interim scores.

543
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,997

-Good.
-Jonathan, 389.

547
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:17,542
They're neck and neck.

What was my score?

549
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:19,911
It's 369.

550
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:21,980
Okay, okay. It's good.

551
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:26,184
I need the keychain!

552
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:27,719

Seriously, I'll show you.

557
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,165

Well, I hope Jonathan comes in first,

because he came in third
after so much effort.

562
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,910
So I hope he comes in first.

563
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:55,013
But I'm not sure
if my abs will allow that.

564
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:58,550

-I don't know.

Let's go. Just five more.

00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:48,567

-No.

595
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,388

There must be a condition.

-You wouldn't just give it to us.
-Really?

and you will have a barbecue party
with the ingredients you found.

It might be out there.

701
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:05,323
No, it can't be,
because meat would go bad outside.

702
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:07,926
It can't have been out for long!

Hey, hold on!

709
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:28,847
Your cap!

710
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:30,582
"THEY FINALLY FOUND IT"

711
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,484
Your cap! Excuse me for a moment.

712
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,486
-Rice! My gosh!
-Rice!

713
00:27:34,552 --> 00:27:38,723
I never imagined you'd hide instant rice
inside the cap.

714
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,058
<i>I really had no idea.</i>

715
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:43,662
<i>I will applaud you guys for that.</i>

716
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:46,097
Last minute!

717
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,199
"1 MINUTE LEFT"

718
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:49,567
There's brothless spicy noodles<i>.</i>

719
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:51,803
There is? We need to find it! Excuse me.

720
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,938
Did you look in places like this?

721
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,006
I did.

722
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:56,241
-Please.
-Where are the spicy noodles?

723
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:58,143
You have 30 seconds left.

724
00:27:58,209 --> 00:27:59,344
<i>Where are the spicy noodles</i>?

725
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:01,146
"THE FINAL 30 SECONDS FOR SPICY NOODLES"

726
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:03,148
-Twenty seconds.
-Please.

727
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:06,618
Ten seconds.

728
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,621
Goodness!

729
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:11,589
Hey, I got meat!

730
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:13,191
"MEANWHILE, HE FOUND PORK SHOULDER"

731
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:14,793
Look for the spicy noodles.

732
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,061
-Is it in the microwave?
-Two.

733
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:17,128
-One.
-In the rice cooker?

734
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,329
<i>Time's over!</i>

735
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:20,098
FINDING BARBECUE INGREDIENTS ENDS

736
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:23,134
Were the spicy noodles inside or outside?

737
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:27,672
It was inside a pot
in the kitchen cabinet.

738
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:29,507
-See?
-Did you not look into it?

739
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:30,709
Come on.

740
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:32,644
-You should've looked inside.
-What were you doing?

741
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,913
I opened every pot I saw.
How could you not…

742
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:37,549
"A MOMENT AGO"

743
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:39,017
I did.

744
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:41,920
"HE JUST CLOSED THE DOOR
AFTER LOOKING INSIDE THE CABINET"

745
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:44,289
Oh, it's in here.

746
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,726
Oh, inside this pot.

747
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:51,930
You see this?
You always half-ass everything in life.

748
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:54,499
How could you not open them?

749
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,534
You even bring up my life?

750
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:58,002
How could you not open them?

751
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,070
Hold on.

752
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:01,372
The meat.

753
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:02,607
Who found the meat?

754
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:04,676
I found meat too.

755
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:05,744
I found the long one.

756
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,278
-Who found the <i>ssamjang</i>?
-You did.

757
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:09,314
I found… Did you look up there?

758
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,949
I looked up there too.

759
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:14,085
Then let's only eat what each of us found.
How does that sound?

760
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:16,254
-Shall we?
-You're only eating kimchi then.

761
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:18,523
-Hold on. Shall we do that?
-We'll only eat meat.

762
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,091
I have sausage.

763
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:21,826
You don't get to eat meat.
You're only eating vegetables.

764
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:23,728
Wait, we're a team.

765
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:26,664
We're a team.

766
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:27,999
"A BIG GAP BETWEEN WHAT THEY FOUND"

767
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:29,067
Enjoy your food.

768
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:30,902
Yeah, enjoy your food.

769
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:32,103
"SO CHILDISH"

770
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,571
No, this isn't right.

771
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:35,073
We should share the food.

772
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,341
"HOW WILL IT END FOR THEM?"

773
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:38,977
I don't need salt anyway,
because I have herb salt.
