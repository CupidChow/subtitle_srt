1
00:00:01,544 --> 00:00:02,945
AFTER LUNCHTIME

2
00:00:03,012 --> 00:00:04,614
It was the sweetest lunch I've ever had.

3
00:00:05,181 --> 00:00:06,482
Thank you for lunch.

4
00:00:06,983 --> 00:00:09,752
STATUS CHECK WITH INTERVIEWS

5
00:00:09,819 --> 00:00:11,354
I'm confident we'll win.

6
00:00:11,421 --> 00:00:13,890
Down the stretch,

7
00:00:13,956 --> 00:00:16,359
the other team will most likely struggle.

8
00:00:16,926 --> 00:00:18,127
I'd say

9
00:00:18,194 --> 00:00:20,563
I've used about three-fifths
of my stamina.

10
00:00:21,397 --> 00:00:23,132
-That's a lot.
-Yes, I'm a bit spent.

11
00:00:23,766 --> 00:00:26,502
I think I'm the one
having a blood sugar spike. I feel drowsy.

12
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,071
I'm in trouble.

13
00:00:29,038 --> 00:00:30,606
Let me go home.

14
00:00:32,942 --> 00:00:34,343
I want to go home.

15
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,711
This is exhausting.

16
00:00:37,547 --> 00:00:39,816
I'll have an energy drink
and hang in there.

17
00:00:39,882 --> 00:00:41,317
We're about halfway through.

18
00:00:41,384 --> 00:00:42,485
Still halfway through?

19
00:00:42,552 --> 00:00:43,553
Yes, halfway through.

20
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:44,954
This is driving me nuts.

21
00:00:46,722 --> 00:00:47,790
He didn't even do much.

22
00:00:47,857 --> 00:00:50,226
Why is he getting his neck treated?

23
00:00:50,293 --> 00:00:52,395
I mean, he used his legs,
so why get his neck treated?

24
00:00:52,462 --> 00:00:54,630
What is this, a massage place?

25
00:00:54,697 --> 00:00:56,432
I regret giving him first place in looks.

26
00:00:57,533 --> 00:00:58,935
This is no fun today.

27
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,840
TAPPING

28
00:01:03,906 --> 00:01:04,907
The Virility King.

29
00:01:04,974 --> 00:01:09,779
HE'S LOSING HIS MIND
LITTLE BY LITTLE

30
00:01:09,846 --> 00:01:12,215
I'm in last place in looks
but the Virility King.

31
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:15,918
THE SECOND HALF BEGINS

32
00:01:15,985 --> 00:01:17,253
All right.

33
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,856
Since you completed 1,000 m before lunch,

34
00:01:19,922 --> 00:01:22,458
we'll play a deduction game now.

35
00:01:23,025 --> 00:01:25,495
You can get a maximum of 400 m deducted.

36
00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:27,597
It's called

37
00:01:27,663 --> 00:01:29,365
"Anchovies' Seduction."

38
00:01:29,432 --> 00:01:30,433
-What?
-Anchovies'

39
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,601
-Seduction?
-Seduction?

40
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:33,870
-Seduction?
-Seduction?

41
00:01:33,936 --> 00:01:35,271
Seduction?

42
00:01:35,338 --> 00:01:37,540
You'll sit facing each other one-on-one

43
00:01:37,607 --> 00:01:40,977
and say a seductive line in turn.

44
00:01:41,777 --> 00:01:44,580
What on earth is this game for?

45
00:01:44,647 --> 00:01:48,284
<i>If you laugh at</i>
<i>your opponent's seductive line, you fail.</i>

46
00:01:48,351 --> 00:01:51,420
<i>And for every success,</i>
<i>you get a deduction of 100 m.</i>

47
00:01:51,487 --> 00:01:53,589
<i>You can decide the order of play.</i>

48
00:01:53,656 --> 00:01:54,724
<i>Oh, it's random.</i>

49
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,392
I need a drink to do this.

50
00:01:56,459 --> 00:01:59,028
Oh, no. I laugh so easily.

51
00:01:59,595 --> 00:02:02,398
-Hey, do young people know what IBLK is?
-What is that?

52
00:02:02,965 --> 00:02:04,967
"I'm bored, let's kiss."

53
00:02:05,034 --> 00:02:07,503
Let's do that. It sounds good. You do it.

54
00:02:08,804 --> 00:02:10,673
I think they'll laugh
because it's so lame.

55
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,375
-It's funny.
-Really?

56
00:02:13,042 --> 00:02:14,877
This is so cringe. What do I do?

57
00:02:14,944 --> 00:02:16,078
I can't think of anything.

58
00:02:16,145 --> 00:02:17,180
Do I have to say something?

59
00:02:17,246 --> 00:02:19,348
Can't I just do something like this?

60
00:02:20,449 --> 00:02:22,451
Once they sit down, I'll do this.

61
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:23,920
Like this.

62
00:02:23,986 --> 00:02:25,454
You sure like stuff like this.

63
00:02:26,088 --> 00:02:27,156
So old-fashioned.

64
00:02:27,223 --> 00:02:28,491
I'm aching to do it.

65
00:02:28,558 --> 00:02:30,593
HE'S SO EXCITED

66
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,395
Are the first players ready?

67
00:02:32,461 --> 00:02:33,629
The first one, come out.

68
00:02:36,832 --> 00:02:38,467
-Darn it.
-Is it O3ohn?

69
00:02:38,968 --> 00:02:41,304
Anchovy Team's first player is O3ohn.

70
00:02:41,804 --> 00:02:42,939
Guest Team's first player.

71
00:02:43,005 --> 00:02:44,607
Oh, it's Eunsil.

72
00:02:44,674 --> 00:02:46,442
The National Team athlete.

73
00:02:47,843 --> 00:02:49,478
SHE LOOKS UNUSUALLY NERVOUS

74
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:51,747
<i>"This is bad. What do I do?"</i>
<i>I wasn't confident.</i>

75
00:02:52,448 --> 00:02:54,517
-Just do it.
-The first player, please come out.

76
00:02:54,584 --> 00:02:57,053
SHE WAS GLUED TO HER PHONE
UNTIL THE GAME BEGAN

77
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:00,456
<i>I've never played this kind of game,</i>

78
00:03:00,523 --> 00:03:02,258
<i>so I even asked ChatGPT.</i>

79
00:03:02,325 --> 00:03:03,392
I racked my brain.

80
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,229
<i>I learned flirting lines from AI.</i>

81
00:03:06,295 --> 00:03:08,531
WHAT WOULD HER FLIRTING
COACHED BY AI BE LIKE?

82
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:11,500
-Do rock paper scissors, below this.
-Okay.

83
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:12,868
Rock paper scissors.

84
00:03:12,935 --> 00:03:14,904
All right, then. Eunsil goes first.

85
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:17,273
One, two, three.

86
00:03:20,009 --> 00:03:23,112
<i>You know, I could see his face</i>
<i>as soon as the towel was removed.</i>

87
00:03:23,679 --> 00:03:26,182
<i>His face looked so funny.</i>

88
00:03:26,249 --> 00:03:28,551
<i>So I almost laughed from the start.</i>

89
00:03:28,618 --> 00:03:29,819
<i>I barely held it in.</i>

90
00:03:33,322 --> 00:03:34,757
FUNNY-FACE CHAMPION

91
00:03:39,328 --> 00:03:40,529
You can't laugh.

92
00:03:41,397 --> 00:03:43,232
THE NATIONAL TEAM
ATHLETE HOLDING OUT

93
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:46,102
RELAXED AND READY TO DEFEND

94
00:03:46,168 --> 00:03:47,737
EUNSIL'S ATTACK (FEAT. AI)

95
00:03:47,803 --> 00:03:49,205
-I…
-Yes?

96
00:03:55,711 --> 00:03:57,046
SWALLOWING HER LAUGH

97
00:03:57,113 --> 00:03:58,180
What?

98
00:03:59,115 --> 00:04:00,449
-I…
-Yes.

99
00:04:01,717 --> 00:04:03,152
I'll stop doing cardio now.

100
00:04:03,886 --> 00:04:04,954
Why?

101
00:04:07,857 --> 00:04:09,558
Because you make my heart race.

102
00:04:10,826 --> 00:04:11,827
REALLY?

103
00:04:12,361 --> 00:04:13,362
Hold on.

104
00:04:13,863 --> 00:04:15,531
Is it okay if you don't open your mouth?

105
00:04:20,102 --> 00:04:23,105
FACING CRISIS
AT HIS FIRST COUNTERATTACK

106
00:04:26,108 --> 00:04:27,977
O3OHN'S ATTACK

107
00:04:29,078 --> 00:04:30,146
Eunsil.

108
00:04:31,447 --> 00:04:33,215
What do you want to name our baby?

109
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,718
What do you want to name our baby?

110
00:04:35,785 --> 00:04:36,852
BITING

111
00:04:44,226 --> 00:04:45,227
3RD ATTACK WITH BROWS

112
00:04:48,931 --> 00:04:51,100
Yuck! I'm going to throw up.

113
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:52,168
EUNSIL'S 2ND ATTACK

114
00:04:52,234 --> 00:04:55,037
Do you know who I'll drive with my car
from now on?

115
00:04:59,642 --> 00:05:00,643
Only you.

116
00:05:06,115 --> 00:05:07,516
<i>Only you.</i>

117
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:10,886
<i>I have a soft spot for tough girls.</i>

118
00:05:10,953 --> 00:05:13,622
<i>I was too immersed before I knew it.</i>

119
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:17,026
Only you.

120
00:05:21,731 --> 00:05:23,332
O3OHN LOSES

121
00:05:25,101 --> 00:05:26,469
It worked!

122
00:05:28,838 --> 00:05:31,407
Hey! I can't believe you!

123
00:05:31,474 --> 00:05:32,842
What's with you?

124
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,011
She's good. That was natural.

125
00:05:36,078 --> 00:05:37,480
The first round, Eunsil wins.

126
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,448
1ST ROUND, GUEST TEAM WINS

127
00:05:39,515 --> 00:05:41,283
The second players, please sit.

128
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:47,022
Second players, DinDin.

129
00:05:47,089 --> 00:05:48,591
This is tough.

130
00:05:49,091 --> 00:05:50,659
And Sian.

131
00:05:53,863 --> 00:05:55,464
Why's she crossing her legs?

132
00:05:56,732 --> 00:05:57,833
Anchovy.

133
00:06:05,641 --> 00:06:07,376
<i>Seduction? Flirting?</i>

134
00:06:10,312 --> 00:06:11,414
That's my specialty.

135
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:15,284
THE BEST FLIRTER IN KOREA

136
00:06:15,351 --> 00:06:16,652
Sian attacks first.

137
00:06:17,219 --> 00:06:18,754
SIAN GOES FIRST

138
00:06:20,122 --> 00:06:21,390
Wow.

139
00:06:26,395 --> 00:06:27,396
Babe.

140
00:06:27,463 --> 00:06:28,597
Babe.

141
00:06:28,664 --> 00:06:30,433
-I told you I wanted to see you today.
-What?

142
00:06:30,499 --> 00:06:31,500
Babe.

143
00:06:31,567 --> 00:06:33,335
-I told you I wanted to see you today.
-What?

144
00:06:33,402 --> 00:06:34,503
INTRIGUED

145
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,672
-I missed you.
-Right.

146
00:06:37,173 --> 00:06:38,941
-It's no joke.
-She's coming on strong.

147
00:06:39,008 --> 00:06:40,042
"Babe"?

148
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:41,177
Look at her shoulders.

149
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:43,813
<i>He was bewitched by me.</i>

150
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:45,548
As soon as I said the first line,

151
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:47,082
<i>his eyes started shaking.</i>

152
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:49,919
<i>I got the feeling that he'd fallen for me.</i>

153
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:55,558
DEFENDING SUCCESSFULLY

154
00:06:58,093 --> 00:06:59,328
DINDIN ATTACKS

155
00:06:59,395 --> 00:07:00,996
Are you Wi-Fi by any chance?

156
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,901
What?

157
00:07:07,002 --> 00:07:08,971
Why does my heart keep connecting to you?

158
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:11,574
My God.

159
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,210
AN EMBARRASSING LINE
THAT EVEN SHOCKS HIS TEAMMATES

160
00:07:16,345 --> 00:07:17,947
I'll end up losing so fast.

161
00:07:23,619 --> 00:07:25,321
HIS EXPRESSION'S
EMBARRASSING TOO

162
00:07:30,292 --> 00:07:31,460
What are you saying?

163
00:07:33,696 --> 00:07:35,631
SIAN LOSES

164
00:07:35,698 --> 00:07:36,832
What are you saying?

165
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:39,668
Okay.

166
00:07:39,735 --> 00:07:42,304
HIS EMBARRASSING LINE
CRACKED HER

167
00:07:42,371 --> 00:07:43,439
-It's not easy.
-Really?

168
00:07:43,506 --> 00:07:45,007
2ND ROUND, ANCHOVY TEAM WINS

169
00:07:45,074 --> 00:07:46,108
SCREAMING

170
00:07:47,576 --> 00:07:49,278
<i>His face just looked so funny.</i>

171
00:07:49,345 --> 00:07:50,579
<i>I couldn't resist it.</i>

172
00:07:50,646 --> 00:07:52,047
<i>He was falling in love,</i>

173
00:07:52,114 --> 00:07:55,584
so I pulled back to stop him
from crossing the line.

174
00:07:56,118 --> 00:07:58,020
<i>I'm Lee Sian after all.</i>

175
00:07:58,921 --> 00:08:00,689
DinDin wins and gets a deduction of 100 m.

176

ANCHOVIES 1: 1 GUESTS

00:08:03,092 --> 00:08:04,627
THE THIRD ROUND

178
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:05,694
It's not going to be easy.

179
00:08:05,761 --> 00:08:07,229
Jonathan versus

180
00:08:07,796 --> 00:08:09,098
Jeong Hein.

181
00:08:09,164 --> 00:08:10,866
-Jonathan, show what you got.
-All right.

182
00:08:10,933 --> 00:08:12,468
Ready, action!

183
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,105
JONATHAN ATTACKS FIRST

184
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:18,374
<i>He was a strong opponent.</i>

185
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,909
<i>When I first met his eyes,</i>

186
00:08:19,975 --> 00:08:23,846
<i>I thought they were so big and white.</i>
<i>It wouldn't be easy to hold in a laugh.</i>

187
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,916
TRYING TO SPACE OUT

188
00:08:26,982 --> 00:08:28,384
You see,

189
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:30,653
I got no time,

190
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,956
and I don't really know
how to express how I feel.

191
00:08:36,859 --> 00:08:39,328
So can I just kiss you right now?

192
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:42,698
So can I just kiss you right now?

193
00:08:42,765 --> 00:08:45,134
AT A LOSS

194
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,641
If you say yes, I'll do it right now.

195
00:08:54,677 --> 00:08:57,413
AT A LOSS AGAIN

196
00:08:58,514 --> 00:09:00,382
YOU GOT THIS, HEIN…

197
00:09:00,449 --> 00:09:01,450
Hey!

198
00:09:01,517 --> 00:09:02,718
DESPERATE

199
00:09:02,785 --> 00:09:05,754
<i>It was so tough. I was biting</i>
<i>the inside of my mouth to hold in a laugh.</i>

200
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:09,592
<i>If I didn't do that,</i>
<i>I would've lost right then.</i>

201
00:09:10,392 --> 00:09:11,427
I can't believe this.

202
00:09:12,161 --> 00:09:14,096
HEIN ATTACKS

203
00:09:14,163 --> 00:09:15,864
When you were having lunch,

204
00:09:16,398 --> 00:09:17,666
did you have seaweed too?

205
00:09:18,233 --> 00:09:20,302
-Seaweed?
-No, that's too weak.

206
00:09:20,369 --> 00:09:21,537
GOING FOR THE OLD CLICHÉ?

207
00:09:21,604 --> 00:09:23,238
-I don't like seaweed.
-You got seaweed here.

208
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,808
What… Are you talking about my skin?

209
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:29,445
LETS LOOSE A KILLER JOKE

210
00:09:31,914 --> 00:09:34,550
AT A LOSS AGAIN

211
00:09:39,888 --> 00:09:41,423
HEIN LOSES

212
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:42,791
ANCHOVIES 2: 1 GUESTS

213
00:09:42,858 --> 00:09:44,393
-Okay, the last players.
-All right.

214
00:09:44,994 --> 00:09:47,529
<i>Daniel's quite thick-skinned,</i>
<i>so I think he'll win.</i>

215
00:09:48,564 --> 00:09:49,798
<i>When I flirt,</i>

216
00:09:49,865 --> 00:09:52,201
<i>the other person's heart is</i>
<i>bound to go pit-a-pat.</i>

217
00:09:52,267 --> 00:09:55,471
<i>So I might end up stealing her heart,</i>
<i>though I don't intend to.</i>

218
00:09:55,537 --> 00:09:58,307
<i>That's what I'm afraid of.</i>

219
00:10:00,009 --> 00:10:02,311
<i>I'm so bad at holding in a laugh.</i>

220
00:10:02,378 --> 00:10:03,646
<i>I laugh a lot.</i>

221
00:10:03,712 --> 00:10:05,848
So I was so worried from the start.

222
00:10:05,914 --> 00:10:07,149
And just as I expected…

223
00:10:09,251 --> 00:10:10,486
Eunbi's already laughing.

224
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,621
Ready, go.

225
00:10:12,688 --> 00:10:13,689
DANIEL ATTACKS FIRST

226
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:24,800
Hey, laughing at his face is too harsh.

227
00:10:28,137 --> 00:10:29,938
LOVING GAZE

228
00:10:37,446 --> 00:10:39,515
She's looking at my nose!

229
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:41,750
Instead of my eyes!

230
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:44,586
Eunbi, if you don't wipe the laugh,
it's over.

231
00:10:44,653 --> 00:10:46,889
One, two, three.

232
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:51,593
IBLK?

233
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:55,364
IBLK?

234
00:10:56,999 --> 00:10:58,300
I'm bored.

235
00:10:58,367 --> 00:10:59,635
Let's kiss.

236
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,741
I'm sorry…

237
00:11:06,308 --> 00:11:08,010
EUNBI LOSES

238
00:11:08,577 --> 00:11:09,611
I'm sorry…

239
00:11:10,846 --> 00:11:12,514
Jeez… I'm offended!

240
00:11:12,581 --> 00:11:14,183
I'm so offended right now!

241
00:11:14,683 --> 00:11:16,585
She seriously snickered at me.

242
00:11:21,924 --> 00:11:23,392
Daniel wins!

243
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:25,561
Winning doesn't make me feel better.

244
00:11:25,627 --> 00:11:27,029
I'm sorry.

245
00:11:28,197 --> 00:11:30,265
<i>All right. You can resume climbing now.</i>

246
00:11:30,332 --> 00:11:31,500
<i>-Okay.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

247
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:32,801
<i>Let's go.</i>

248
00:11:33,168 --> 00:11:34,303
EXERCISE RESUMES

249
00:11:34,369 --> 00:11:35,404
Let's do this.

250
00:11:35,971 --> 00:11:37,172
FALLING BEHIND DUE TO THE LOSS

251
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:38,540
Hold on. She's…

252
00:11:38,607 --> 00:11:40,843
STARTING AT THE MAXIMUM SPEED

253
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:42,878
She's going with speed 25 right away.

254
00:11:45,748 --> 00:11:47,349
CHALLENGE ACCEPTED

255
00:11:49,017 --> 00:11:50,352
At speed 25, like her?

256
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:52,621
BOTH TEAMS START AT SPEED 25

257
00:11:53,756 --> 00:11:55,257
Hey, I'm scared now.

258
00:11:55,324 --> 00:11:57,059
Scared of going up there again.

259
00:11:57,626 --> 00:11:59,261
We have our Eunsil.

260
00:11:59,328 --> 00:12:00,596
I'm going with that strategy.

261
00:12:00,662 --> 00:12:01,697
Okay.

262
00:12:02,164 --> 00:12:04,066
WHAT'S THE GUEST TEAM'S STRATEGY?

263
00:12:04,466 --> 00:12:05,467
BEFORE LUNCHTIME

264
00:12:05,968 --> 00:12:07,469
We have to maintain speed 25.

265
00:12:07,536 --> 00:12:09,471
Speed 25? Okay.

266
00:12:09,538 --> 00:12:11,440
You two go 30 m each at speed 25.

267
00:12:12,007 --> 00:12:13,041
Go 30 m each.

268
00:12:14,176 --> 00:12:15,644
<i>"We must keep going with speed 25."</i>

269
00:12:15,711 --> 00:12:18,781
<i>"Run as much as we can</i>
<i>and keep switching." That was our plan.</i>

270
00:12:18,847 --> 00:12:21,250
-You climbed 144 m.
-Wow.

271
00:12:21,316 --> 00:12:23,018
How can she go so much at speed 25?

272
00:12:23,685 --> 00:12:25,587
-They all climb at speed 25.
-Right.

273
00:12:25,654 --> 00:12:26,855
Hein climbed 200 m.

274
00:12:26,922 --> 00:12:28,423
-200 m?
-She's a monster.

275
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:29,925
Climb 200 m at speed 25?

276
00:12:29,992 --> 00:12:31,126
She's climbed 180 m at 25.

277
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,296
She's like the final boss.

278
00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:38,467
EUNBI ALSO RUNS AT SPEED 25

279
00:12:39,034 --> 00:12:40,702
-Wow, Kwon Eunbi!
-Good.

280
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:42,571
Nice!

281
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:43,939
-At speed 25?
-She's doing great.

282
00:12:44,006 --> 00:12:46,141
She's doing much better than I expected.

283
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:48,777
There's 5 m left. Almost there.

284
00:12:48,844 --> 00:12:50,746
-I'll go for 50 m.
-For 50 m, okay.

285
00:12:51,246 --> 00:12:52,581
A little more.

286
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:53,782
Almost there.

287
00:12:53,849 --> 00:12:55,884
<i>Right next to me,</i>

288
00:12:55,951 --> 00:12:57,853
<i>Eunsil kept encouraging me.</i>

289
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,855
<i>I think that helped a lot.</i>

290
00:12:59,922 --> 00:13:02,191
<i>I felt so reassured and encouraged.</i>

291
00:13:03,425 --> 00:13:04,726
Eunbi climbed 50 m.

292
00:13:05,828 --> 00:13:06,895
KNOCKED DOWN

293
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:08,997
Let's go! Sian, you got this.

294
00:13:09,731 --> 00:13:10,799
Good. You're doing great.

295
00:13:11,366 --> 00:13:12,935
Are they all going at speed 25?

296
00:13:14,703 --> 00:13:16,471
If you feel dizzy, look into the distance.

297
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:18,740
YES, MA'AM

298
00:13:18,807 --> 00:13:20,676
<i>With Eunsil helping me a lot beside me,</i>

299
00:13:20,742 --> 00:13:22,945
<i>I was doing it according to plan.</i>

300
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:25,447
<i>And while trying to meet the goal,</i>
<i>I could reach 50 m.</i>

301
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:27,649
<i>I think that made me try harder.</i>

302
00:13:27,716 --> 00:13:30,452
<i>Without my teammates,</i>
<i>I wouldn't have been able to do it.</i>

303
00:13:31,553 --> 00:13:34,790
SIAN'S GIVING IT HER ALL UNTIL THE END

304
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:36,425
She's going so fast.

305
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:41,463
-She's going at 25 without getting tired.
-She's still at 25.

306
00:13:41,997 --> 00:13:42,998
She's incredible.

307
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:45,167
THE TABLES MIGHT BE TURNED

308
00:13:45,234 --> 00:13:46,668
Okay, Daniel!

309
00:13:46,735 --> 00:13:48,837
Let's go, let's go! Let's get it!

310
00:13:48,904 --> 00:13:50,806
DANIEL HAS GREAT ENDURANCE
DOWN THE STRETCH

311
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:53,041
-Let's get Kwon Eunbi.
-Let's get Eunbi.

312
00:13:53,108 --> 00:13:54,810
Let's hit 75, no less.

313
00:13:54,877 --> 00:13:57,412
SHE'S DANIEL'S ONLY ENEMY TODAY

314
00:13:58,213 --> 00:13:59,281
I'll go with 25.

315
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:03,919
DETERMINED TO BEAT EUNBI AND END IT

316
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:06,755
Do you know why you're fourth place?

317
00:14:08,457 --> 00:14:09,892
Because I love you!

318
00:14:11,293 --> 00:14:12,761
Hey, be quiet.

319
00:14:12,828 --> 00:14:15,330
Because I love you,
I made you fourth place!

320
00:14:16,031 --> 00:14:17,499
Stop talking nonsense and be quiet.

321
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,702
EUNBI'S ENDLESS ARTILLERY SUPPORT

322
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:22,571
Quiet!

323
00:14:23,705 --> 00:14:24,706
Please.

324
00:14:26,141 --> 00:14:28,243
You're last place forever!

325
00:14:29,678 --> 00:14:31,847
Darn it. Be quiet.

326
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:34,016
-Stop?
-Okay, I'll stop.

327
00:14:37,486 --> 00:14:38,487
Darn it.

328
00:14:41,356 --> 00:14:43,892
BOTH HIS BODY AND HEART ARE WRECKED

329
00:14:47,162 --> 00:14:49,164
ANCHOVY TEAM: 5,767 M
GUEST TEAM: 5,830 M

330
00:14:49,231 --> 00:14:51,300
GUEST TEAM TAKES THE LEAD BY 63 M

331
00:14:51,366 --> 00:14:54,336
You guys are covering
the distance so fast.

332
00:14:54,403 --> 00:14:57,172
Of course, they're running like crazy
at speed 25.

333
00:14:57,673 --> 00:14:59,374
Why are you going this far?

334
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,711
This is exhausting.

335
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:03,946
DESPERATE FOR A DEDUCTION GAME

336
00:15:04,012 --> 00:15:05,013
All right.

337
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,983
This time, a deduction of 500 m
is on the line.

338
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:09,685
-This is big.
-Let's win this.

339
00:15:09,751 --> 00:15:10,953
No matter what.

340
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:12,387
<i>It's "Sweet Recharge Game."</i>

341
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:15,590
<i>The team that leaves a shorter length</i>
<i>of chocolate sticks in total</i>

342
00:15:15,657 --> 00:15:17,292
<i>wins a deduction of 500 m.</i>

343
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:19,027
Oh, leaving a shorter length?

344
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:22,898
We're at an advantage.
Guys are bad at this, right?

345
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:24,066
You just stay still.

346
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:25,567
-I'll move.
-Okay.

347
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:26,835
I got this.

348
00:15:26,902 --> 00:15:29,838
GUEST TEAM FIRED UP WITH COMPETITIVENESS

349
00:15:29,905 --> 00:15:31,106
Me and Daniel.

350
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:33,075
O3ohn and Jonathan.

351
00:15:34,276 --> 00:15:36,578
They have protruding mouths,
so they'll touch mine.

352
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:39,281
O3ohn, can I kiss you?

353
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:41,216
Yeah, let's just kiss.

354
00:15:42,751 --> 00:15:44,419
We might as well just kiss.

355
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:46,121
It's your first kiss. Is that okay?

356
00:15:46,188 --> 00:15:47,622
-It is, if it's with O3ohn.
-Is it?

357
00:15:47,689 --> 00:15:48,991
Your first kiss with O3ohn?

358
00:15:49,057 --> 00:15:50,492
SACRIFICING HIS FIRST KISS FOR 500 M

359
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:52,494
<i>I was serious about it.</i>

360
00:15:52,561 --> 00:15:53,929
It was 500 m on the line.

361
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:55,230
I gotta do it.

362
00:15:55,297 --> 00:15:56,765
O3ohn, let's just

363
00:15:56,832 --> 00:15:58,567
-think our lips will touch.
-Okay.

364
00:15:58,633 --> 00:16:00,302
-So what if they touch?
-Right. For 500 m.

365
00:16:00,369 --> 00:16:01,970
-It's just work.
-Right. Okay.

366
00:16:02,037 --> 00:16:04,973
THEY REALIZE HOW BIG 500 M IS

367
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,508
Hey, no emotions involved.

368
00:16:07,409 --> 00:16:09,945
Without any emotions. Keep it simple.

369
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:11,813
-Keep it dry? Okay.
-Yes, it's just a game.

370
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,448
THIS IS JUST A GAME…

371
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:15,117
My goodness.

372
00:16:17,552 --> 00:16:21,723
FUNNY-FACE CHAMPION APPEARS AGAIN

373
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,892
JONATHAN BRACES HIMSELF AND APPROACHES

374
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:25,293
-Darn it.
-What…

375
00:16:25,594 --> 00:16:27,929
HE'S JUST AS TERRIFIED

376
00:16:27,996 --> 00:16:29,998
Goodness! Hold on!

377
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:34,803
SCREAMING

378
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,071
It's just work!

379
00:16:36,138 --> 00:16:38,607
I mean, I just felt
the breath from his nose.

380
00:16:39,508 --> 00:16:40,709
It's just work.

381
00:16:40,776 --> 00:16:43,178
-Hold your breath.
-Oh, I should hold my breath?

382
00:16:43,245 --> 00:16:44,613
Hurry. We don't have much time.

383
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:46,948
NOW FOCUS FOR REAL

384
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,453
O3OHN, YOU KNOW 500 M IS
ON THE LINE, RIGHT?

385
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,322
YES, JUST DO IT

386
00:16:56,658 --> 00:16:57,726
He's going for it.

387
00:16:59,461 --> 00:17:01,930
My God. Why are his lips so thick?

388
00:17:07,836 --> 00:17:09,404
BREAKING IT RIGHT BEFORE THEIR LIPS TOUCH

389
00:17:09,471 --> 00:17:11,473
-Oh! You did a great job.
-Good.

390
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,741
-Should I cut it?
-Yes.

391
00:17:15,477 --> 00:17:17,846
O3ohn and Jonathan left 1 cm.

392
00:17:18,613 --> 00:17:20,682
-He's manly. No.
-Your lips didn't touch?

393
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:22,384
I don't think so. I didn't feel it.

394
00:17:22,451 --> 00:17:25,087
-He's good.
-But it was surely his first kiss.

395
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:30,258
My heart fluttered.

396
00:17:30,959 --> 00:17:33,428
THE THRILL OF THE FIRST KISS?

397
00:17:34,062 --> 00:17:35,831
We have to make it really short to win.

398
00:17:35,897 --> 00:17:38,100
WHILE JONATHAN IS BEING TEASED

399
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:41,570
We should decide whether
the one holding it will cut it at the end.

400
00:17:42,137 --> 00:17:44,773
I don't know. I just can't believe
I have to decide such a thing.

401
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,007
It's 500 m.

402
00:17:46,074 --> 00:17:47,109
-Right, 500 m.
-500 m.

403
00:17:47,175 --> 00:17:49,744
A DEDUCTION OF 500 M IS
JUST AS IMPORTANT TO THE GUEST TEAM

404
00:17:49,811 --> 00:17:51,012
Cut it at the end?

405
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:54,249
<i>If we won, it'd be good for me too,</i>
<i>so I decided to follow the plan.</i>

406
00:17:54,316 --> 00:17:56,551
<i>Because 500 m makes a huge difference.</i>

407
00:18:00,422 --> 00:18:03,358
EUNSIL CUTS IT ACCORDING TO PLAN

408
00:18:04,526 --> 00:18:06,194
What? Is that possible?

409
00:18:06,261 --> 00:18:08,029
It's 0.8 cm.

410
00:18:09,097 --> 00:18:11,266
NEXT UP ARE EUNBI &amp; SIAN

411
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:12,601
-See the chocolate here?
-Yes.

412
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:14,536
-Hold it here?
-You should hold it here.

413
00:18:14,603 --> 00:18:16,738
THEIR PLAN IS TO LEAVE THE CHOCOLATE SIDE

414
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:18,273
A little bit more.

415
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,441
You're being so careful.

416
00:18:19,841 --> 00:18:21,176
DETERMINED TO WIN NO MATTER WHAT

417
00:18:21,243 --> 00:18:22,878
Oh, it's like <i>Single's Inferno.</i>

418
00:18:24,379 --> 00:18:26,882
GOING FOR IT WITHOUT HESITATION

419
00:18:26,948 --> 00:18:29,251
Wow.

420
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:36,591
CHARGING AT THE END

421
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:38,593
-Are you okay?
-Oh, shoot.

422
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,794
-They touched.
-Oh, shoot.

423
00:18:39,861 --> 00:18:40,929
Did they touch?

424
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:43,098
Eunbi went for it at the end.

425
00:18:43,598 --> 00:18:45,033
-It's neck and neck.
-I know.

426
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,536
Eunbi and Sian left 1 cm.

427
00:18:48,203 --> 00:18:50,472
ANCHOVY TEAM: 1 CM
GUEST TEAM: 1.8 CM

428
00:18:50,539 --> 00:18:52,107
Hey, this is…

429
00:18:52,174 --> 00:18:54,643
DINDIN AND DANIEL MUST LEAVE
SHORTER THAN 0.8 CM TO WIN

430
00:18:54,709 --> 00:18:55,777
Daniel.

431
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:57,379
Hold it like this.

432
00:18:57,445 --> 00:18:59,481
-Like this? Hey, like this.
-Yes, like that.

433
00:18:59,548 --> 00:19:01,449
WE'RE SERIOUS RIGHT NOW

434
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:02,817
You look like a dachshund.

435
00:19:02,884 --> 00:19:04,152
Like a cartoon character.

436
00:19:06,221 --> 00:19:07,889
Stay still.

437
00:19:07,956 --> 00:19:08,990
Stay still.

438
00:19:09,057 --> 00:19:11,526
Stay still, and I'll eat it all. Okay?

439
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,994
GOT IT

440
00:19:13,061 --> 00:19:14,462
Open it.

441
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:15,864
THE TWO LOOK SO DETERMINED

442
00:19:15,931 --> 00:19:17,232
-Here I go.
-Okay.

443
00:19:17,299 --> 00:19:18,667
<i>It's horrible.</i>

444
00:19:18,733 --> 00:19:21,937
<i>But doing the exercise,</i>
<i>I realized 500 m was a huge difference.</i>

445
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:25,740
IF IT'S FOR 500 M!

446
00:19:26,074 --> 00:19:31,179
THE RECORD THEY MUST BEAT IS 0.8 CM

447
00:19:37,285 --> 00:19:40,422
WHAT DID I JUST SEE?

448
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:42,557
They kissed!

449
00:19:43,325 --> 00:19:45,060
Hey, they absolutely…

450
00:19:45,126 --> 00:19:47,062
UTTERLY SHOCKED

451
00:19:47,128 --> 00:19:49,598
SCREAMING

452
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,867
-They touched.
-They touched?

453
00:19:52,934 --> 00:19:53,935
What…

454
00:19:54,002 --> 00:19:55,670
Are you crazy?

455
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:57,772
Why did your lips…

456
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:59,608
-Why did your lips…
-Where is it?

457
00:19:59,674 --> 00:20:01,243
Why on earth?

458
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:03,144
Where is it?

459
00:20:03,211 --> 00:20:04,746
KISS OR NOT, THE RESULT IS MORE IMPORTANT

460
00:20:04,813 --> 00:20:06,047
No, he has it.

461
00:20:06,114 --> 00:20:07,282
-Spit it out.
-Spit it out.

462
00:20:07,349 --> 00:20:08,783
-Do it there.
-Spit it out.

463
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:11,419
Hey, why did you have to spread this?

464
00:20:12,854 --> 00:20:13,855
They're nuts.

465
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:16,625
This crazy guy suddenly relaxed his lips

466
00:20:16,691 --> 00:20:17,859
and then…

467
00:20:18,393 --> 00:20:19,561
<i>stuck out his lips.</i>

468
00:20:19,628 --> 00:20:22,397
But why did you spread my mouth open?

469
00:20:22,464 --> 00:20:24,099
Because I didn't want to touch them!

470
00:20:24,165 --> 00:20:25,700
I hate this!

471
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:27,435
I hate this too!

472
00:20:27,502 --> 00:20:29,170
I seriously feel like throwing up.

473
00:20:29,671 --> 00:20:31,139
It's just work. Forget about it.

474
00:20:31,673 --> 00:20:32,807
Don't be excited.

475
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:34,876
I'll tell you the result.

476
00:20:35,343 --> 00:20:36,344
Good, good.

477
00:20:36,411 --> 00:20:39,180
WHAT'S IMPORTANT NOW IS THE RESULT

478
00:20:40,582 --> 00:20:42,717
Daniel and DinDin…

479
00:20:42,784 --> 00:20:45,487
"WHAT DID THEY GET
FOR SACRIFICING THEIR LIPS?"

480
00:20:45,553 --> 00:20:47,155
left 0.7 cm.

481
00:20:47,222 --> 00:20:48,223
Anchovy team wins.

482
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,225
CHEERING

483
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:51,293
Go away, darn it.

484
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:53,395
BY A MARGIN OF 0.1 CM

485
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:55,096
That was so close. What a shame.

486
00:20:55,163 --> 00:20:56,331
500 m is huge.

487
00:20:56,931 --> 00:20:57,932
Good job.

488
00:20:57,999 --> 00:21:00,201
GRUNTING

489
00:21:00,268 --> 00:21:01,703
Hey, let's all kiss together.

490
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,538
-Let's kiss.
-Forget it.

491
00:21:03,605 --> 00:21:04,739
KISS CELEBRATION?

492
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:06,141
Forget it. My goodness.

493
00:21:06,207 --> 00:21:07,942
ANCHOVY TEAM GETS 500 M DEDUCTED

494
00:21:08,009 --> 00:21:10,679
<i>-It's a huge difference.</i>
<i>-It's huge.</i>

495
00:21:12,447 --> 00:21:14,215
-But…
-I'm sorry to ask this,

496
00:21:14,282 --> 00:21:16,084
-can I have a smoke?
-but can I have a smoke break?

497
00:21:16,885 --> 00:21:18,820
-Seriously.
-I want to rinse my mouth.

498
00:21:18,887 --> 00:21:19,888
Let's take five, then.

499
00:21:19,954 --> 00:21:21,089
A 5-minute break?

500
00:21:22,123 --> 00:21:23,258
SIGH

501
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:25,560
It feels like… Damn it.

502
00:21:26,061 --> 00:21:27,962
-We still won.
-Yeah, we won.

503
00:21:28,029 --> 00:21:29,030
You liked it, huh?

504
00:21:30,131 --> 00:21:31,466
It kind of felt like salmon.

505
00:21:33,068 --> 00:21:36,171
EXHALING

506
00:21:36,471 --> 00:21:39,074
ANCHOVY TEAM: 6,267 M
GUEST TEAM: 5,830 M

507
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:42,010
THE ANCHOVY TEAM TURNED THE TABLES
BY SACRIFICING THEIR LIPS

508
00:21:42,077 --> 00:21:43,178
Let's go.

509
00:21:43,244 --> 00:21:44,846
WHILE THE ANCHOVY TEAM GETS STARTED

510
00:21:44,913 --> 00:21:46,815
How do we close the 500-meter gap?

511
00:21:46,881 --> 00:21:48,583
We should've been bolder.

512
00:21:49,684 --> 00:21:52,253
They've lost the will to fight.

513
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,788
You think 500 m is small?

514
00:21:54,322 --> 00:21:55,724
The 500 m is big.

515
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,325
It's really huge.

516
00:21:57,826 --> 00:21:59,527
If we also lose the last game,

517
00:21:59,594 --> 00:22:00,795
it's really over.

518
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,531
We should catch up a bit now.

519
00:22:03,598 --> 00:22:05,967
<i>We almost became dispirited,</i>

520
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:08,837
but we got somewhat more motivated
because of the loss.

521
00:22:08,903 --> 00:22:11,172
So we were determined to win
no matter what.

522
00:22:11,239 --> 00:22:12,240
Let's go!

523
00:22:12,307 --> 00:22:13,742
THE GUEST TEAM TRIES TO CHEER UP

524
00:22:13,808 --> 00:22:15,009
How far will you go?

525
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:16,611
Once I reach 100 m,

526
00:22:16,678 --> 00:22:19,114
I'll slow down to speed 20
and go for another 100 m.

527
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,949
<i>It's not over till it's over.</i>

528
00:22:21,516 --> 00:22:23,351
<i>If we gave up here,</i>

529
00:22:23,418 --> 00:22:25,520
<i>what we've done would be for nothing.</i>

530
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:27,155
You climbed 150 m.

531
00:22:27,655 --> 00:22:28,690
Let's go!

532
00:22:28,757 --> 00:22:29,858
You'll climb 50 m?

533
00:22:30,859 --> 00:22:33,895
<i>It was embarrassing to only go for 50 m,</i>

534
00:22:33,962 --> 00:22:36,131
<i>but I did my best not to be a burden.</i>

535
00:22:36,197 --> 00:22:37,499
Eunbi climbed 50 m.

536
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:39,968
Eunsil climbed 120 m.

537
00:22:40,668 --> 00:22:43,271
THE GUEST TEAM CLOSES THE GAP QUICKLY

538
00:22:43,338 --> 00:22:46,007
DINDIN IS ALSO AT SPEED 25

539
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:48,076
You're so adorable, Eunsil!

540
00:22:48,143 --> 00:22:49,277
Darn it!

541
00:22:49,911 --> 00:22:51,613
It worked. You got to her.

542
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,348
PANTING

543
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:55,550
HE'S THE ONE WHO PROVOKED HER FIRST

544
00:22:55,617 --> 00:22:57,819
BUT SLOWS DOWN RIGHT AWAY

545
00:22:57,886 --> 00:22:59,754
-What's the speed?
-23.

546
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:01,423
Now 22.

547
00:23:02,624 --> 00:23:04,759
SLOWING DOWN FAST

548
00:23:04,826 --> 00:23:06,261
You're adorable, DinDin.

549
00:23:08,163 --> 00:23:09,864
God, how do you do this?

550
00:23:11,299 --> 00:23:13,101
Hold on. Make it slower.

551
00:23:13,668 --> 00:23:15,203
PANTING

552
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,371
Are you exhausted?

553
00:23:17,272 --> 00:23:18,273
Yes.

554
00:23:18,339 --> 00:23:20,041
THE ANCHOVY TEAM IS VERY EXHAUSTED

555
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:22,544
Eunsil, we're almost there. Almost there.

556
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:23,812
We will win.

557
00:23:23,878 --> 00:23:24,879
Gosh.

558
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:27,449
-They keep going at 25.
-I know.

559
00:23:28,249 --> 00:23:31,419
So if we go at speed 15 or something,
the gap narrows.

560
00:23:32,987 --> 00:23:34,022
It's 300 m.

561
00:23:34,088 --> 00:23:35,089
That's insane.

562
00:23:35,156 --> 00:23:36,357
REACHING 300 M

563
00:23:36,424 --> 00:23:38,593
-Is that even possible? At 25?
-300 m.

564
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,195
How long are you going for?

565
00:23:40,261 --> 00:23:42,697
-I don't know. Stop talking to me.
-Wow.

566
00:23:42,764 --> 00:23:44,933
Eunsil's reaching her limit too.

567
00:23:44,999 --> 00:23:46,568
-She's feeling it.
-You're annoying!

568
00:23:48,336 --> 00:23:49,671
You're annoying!

569
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:53,608
I'm annoying? What…

570
00:23:53,675 --> 00:23:55,477
What did I do?

571
00:23:55,543 --> 00:23:57,245
She's annoyed whenever she sees me.

572
00:23:57,312 --> 00:23:58,513
FIRED UP THANKS TO HIM

573
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,714
That's hilarious.

574
00:24:01,816 --> 00:24:02,951
-They're done?
-Yes.

575
00:24:03,017 --> 00:24:04,752
EUNSIL HAS REACHED 1,000 M

576
00:24:05,186 --> 00:24:07,822
THIS IS THE STAMINA OF THE NATIONAL TEAM

577
00:24:07,889 --> 00:24:10,058
-She's so good.
-Hey, if we don't win this game,

578
00:24:10,124 --> 00:24:11,125
we're screwed.

579
00:24:11,192 --> 00:24:12,293
Seriously.

580
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,895
-We're done for.
-We are.

581
00:24:13,962 --> 00:24:15,196
-We must win.
-No matter what.

582
00:24:15,263 --> 00:24:16,865
Here's the name of the game.

583
00:24:16,931 --> 00:24:18,166
"Pushing Frog."

584
00:24:18,233 --> 00:24:19,667
-This?
-Pushing while squatting.

585
00:24:19,734 --> 00:24:22,170
A maximum of 400 m is on the line.

586
00:24:22,237 --> 00:24:24,539
<i>Squat facing each other</i>

587
00:24:24,606 --> 00:24:28,142
<i>and push your opponent down</i>
<i>only with your palms. It's one-on-one.</i>

588
00:24:28,209 --> 00:24:30,111
You can only move forward or backward,

589
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:32,580
and the line must stay between your legs.

590
00:24:34,649 --> 00:24:36,784
Then the matchups are random?

591
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:37,986
That's correct.

592
00:24:38,052 --> 00:24:40,188
So luck will play a big role.

593
00:24:40,255 --> 00:24:41,756
But it's so disadvantageous to us.

594
00:24:41,823 --> 00:24:44,959
THE GUEST TEAM HAS
A DISADVANTAGE IN STRENGTH

595
00:24:45,927 --> 00:24:47,929
Women are more flexible.

596
00:24:47,996 --> 00:24:48,997
1. USE FLEXIBILITY

597
00:24:49,063 --> 00:24:50,798
-We can lean forward.
-I'll stick my arms to my legs.

598
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:53,101
We should dodge since they're stronger.

599
00:24:53,167 --> 00:24:54,168
2. CATCH THEM OFF GUARD

600
00:24:54,235 --> 00:24:55,970
-Bam, bam, bam.
-Dodge until they're tired out.

601
00:24:56,037 --> 00:24:58,439
HOW WILL THIS MATCH END?

602
00:24:58,506 --> 00:25:00,441
Let's honeytrap them.

603
00:25:00,508 --> 00:25:02,644
I hope you go against DinDin.

604
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,112
-Right.
-I wonder when he'll play.

605
00:25:04,178 --> 00:25:05,647
The first players.

606
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:07,448
Jonathan for the Anchovy Team.

607
00:25:07,515 --> 00:25:08,550
Okay!

608
00:25:08,616 --> 00:25:10,685
ANCHOVY TEAM'S 1ST PLAYER
JONATHAN

609
00:25:10,752 --> 00:25:13,121
No way!

610
00:25:13,187 --> 00:25:15,456
Sian for the Guest Team.

611
00:25:15,523 --> 00:25:17,625
-Good strategy!
-Let's go!

612
00:25:17,692 --> 00:25:19,227
I bet you thought it'd be me.

613
00:25:20,662 --> 00:25:23,231
1ST ROUND
JONATHAN VS SIAN

614
00:25:23,298 --> 00:25:26,768
But I think we should
move the gym rack away.

615
00:25:26,834 --> 00:25:28,536
WHAT ABOUT THE RACK?

616
00:25:28,603 --> 00:25:30,471
If Jonathan pushes her hard,

617
00:25:30,538 --> 00:25:32,774
she'll get a hole in her body
like a cartoon.

618
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,276
-I'm doomed. I'm so scared.
-You got this.

619
00:25:35,343 --> 00:25:37,278
-Let's go, Sian!
-Let's go!

620
00:25:37,345 --> 00:25:40,181
Let's go. Win this, and we'll
only have 1,000 m left. Let's go.

621
00:25:40,248 --> 00:25:41,783
THE ANCHOVY TEAM
FEELS SO CONFIDENT

622
00:25:41,849 --> 00:25:43,585
Ready, go!

623
00:25:43,651 --> 00:25:45,587
-Let's go, Sian!
-What?

624
00:25:45,653 --> 00:25:47,455
-You don't have to go to her.
-So relaxed!

625
00:25:47,522 --> 00:25:50,325
RELAXED

626
00:25:50,391 --> 00:25:52,627
-I'll just do it, since there are others.
-Okay.

627
00:25:52,694 --> 00:25:53,962
You can push me.

628
00:25:54,028 --> 00:25:55,063
Don't let your guard down.

629
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,398
It seems hard for him to move.

630
00:25:57,465 --> 00:25:58,900
Squatting is hard for him.

631
00:25:58,967 --> 00:26:01,069
JONATHAN'S BALANCE
LOOKS UNSTABLE

632
00:26:01,135 --> 00:26:02,136
But Sian's good.

633
00:26:04,105 --> 00:26:05,139
But Sian's good.

634
00:26:05,206 --> 00:26:07,041
SIAN HOLDS OUT
WITH HER FLEXIBILITY

635
00:26:07,108 --> 00:26:08,343
Nice!

636
00:26:08,876 --> 00:26:10,244
Jonathan, be careful.

637
00:26:10,311 --> 00:26:11,579
Look at Sian's eyes.

638
00:26:11,646 --> 00:26:13,581
-She's waiting for a chance. Right?
-Right.

639
00:26:13,648 --> 00:26:15,750
SIAN'S NEXT STRATEGY

640
00:26:16,417 --> 00:26:17,785
DODGING

641
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:20,655
WHOA

642
00:26:20,722 --> 00:26:23,291
WILL IT WORK?

643
00:26:23,691 --> 00:26:25,360
JONATHAN HOLDS OUT?!

644
00:26:25,927 --> 00:26:27,895
Is it allowed?

645
00:26:27,962 --> 00:26:29,564
I'M SORRY

646
00:26:30,131 --> 00:26:33,501
UNFAIR PLAY BROUGHT
BY EXCESSIVE COMPETITIVENESS

647
00:26:33,568 --> 00:26:34,736
Go head-to-head.

648
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:37,205
NOT GOING EASY ON HER ANYMORE

649
00:26:37,739 --> 00:26:38,740
LIGHT PUSH

650
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:40,908
FINISHING HER WITH ONE BLOW

651
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:41,976
Yes.

652
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:45,513
A MISERABLE END FOR THE CHEATER

653
00:26:46,881 --> 00:26:48,816
PROTECT SIAN'S IMAGE

654
00:26:48,883 --> 00:26:50,585
Hey, celebrate here.

655
00:26:50,652 --> 00:26:52,720
Yes. That's good.

656
00:26:55,657 --> 00:26:57,392
But that was so cruel just now.

657
00:26:57,959 --> 00:27:00,328
-It was so cruel.
-It's just a game.

658
00:27:00,395 --> 00:27:02,330
ANCHOVY TEAM GETS 100 M DEDUCTED

659
00:27:02,397 --> 00:27:03,831
2ND ROUND
DANIEL VS HEIN

660
00:27:03,898 --> 00:27:04,899
Ready, go!

661
00:27:06,934 --> 00:27:08,503
A VERY EASY WIN

662
00:27:08,569 --> 00:27:09,771
Jeez.

663
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:12,674
<i>-It's two-to-nil, right?</i>
<i>-Correct.</i>

664
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,175
If you lose…

665
00:27:14,242 --> 00:27:17,011
Eunbi, you really can't lose this one.

666
00:27:17,078 --> 00:27:18,579
The third round.

667
00:27:18,646 --> 00:27:20,281
O3ohn will play…

668
00:27:20,348 --> 00:27:22,917
ANCHOVY TEAM'S 3RD PLAYER
O3OHN

669
00:27:22,984 --> 00:27:24,052
…against Kwon Eunbi.

670
00:27:24,118 --> 00:27:25,420
GUEST TEAM'S 3RD PLAYER
EUNBI

671
00:27:25,987 --> 00:27:27,188
HOLD ON

672
00:27:27,255 --> 00:27:29,290
-I'm going against Eunsil?
-You're against Eunsil.

673
00:27:29,357 --> 00:27:31,592
-You're against Eunsil.
-For real?

674
00:27:31,659 --> 00:27:33,094
She'll cook you.

675
00:27:33,161 --> 00:27:34,929
No, I'll show her what I got.

676
00:27:34,996 --> 00:27:36,130
HOW WILL DINDIN BE COOKED?

677
00:27:36,197 --> 00:27:37,331
Get ready.

678
00:27:37,398 --> 00:27:38,466
Ready, go!

679
00:27:39,033 --> 00:27:40,868
I'll stay low.

680
00:27:41,436 --> 00:27:43,171
Why is Eunbi so hunchbacked?

681
00:27:43,237 --> 00:27:45,740
-She looks like Gollum.
-I feel sorry for her.

682
00:27:45,807 --> 00:27:47,442
She can't even come to me.

683
00:27:47,508 --> 00:27:49,110
Good strategy.

684
00:27:49,177 --> 00:27:50,378
DOESN'T KNOW IT'S HER STRATEGY

685
00:27:50,445 --> 00:27:51,546
You can just go to her.

686
00:27:51,612 --> 00:27:53,347
I can hit her like this.

687
00:27:53,915 --> 00:27:56,050
HE STARTS MESSING AROUND

688
00:27:56,117 --> 00:27:58,252
FEELING CONFIDENT
GOING AGAINST THE WEAKEST ONE

689
00:27:58,319 --> 00:27:59,854
-"Bang" like this.
-Good!

690
00:27:59,921 --> 00:28:02,090
-Hey, don't mess around.
-One more time!

691
00:28:02,156 --> 00:28:03,658
Hey, 100 m is huge.

692
00:28:03,725 --> 00:28:06,027
JUST AN IMMATURE ADULT

693
00:28:06,627 --> 00:28:07,795
Bang!

694
00:28:07,862 --> 00:28:08,963
Bang!

695
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:13,501
Stop it. Stop messing around!

696
00:28:14,102 --> 00:28:16,237
-Hey, 100 m is big.
-She's not coming at me.

697
00:28:16,304 --> 00:28:18,239
Play with her.

698
00:28:18,306 --> 00:28:22,176
MEANWHILE, EUNBI QUIETLY WAITS
FOR A CHANCE

699
00:28:22,243 --> 00:28:23,377
Bang!

700
00:28:23,878 --> 00:28:25,012
How about that?

701
00:28:27,715 --> 00:28:29,317
How about that? Oh, wait.

702
00:28:29,383 --> 00:28:30,718
SCARED

703
00:28:31,285 --> 00:28:32,553
-O3ohn, use both hands.
-Yes?

704
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,521
Hold on. Hey!

705
00:28:34,822 --> 00:28:36,724
It's because you kept talking to me.

706
00:28:38,426 --> 00:28:39,761
-O3ohn.
-Yes?

707
00:28:40,294 --> 00:28:42,263
WHILE HE LOOKS AT JONATHAN

708
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:44,632
SHE SEES A CHANCE

709
00:28:44,699 --> 00:28:46,334
-Use both hands.
-Hold on. Hey!

710
00:28:48,736 --> 00:28:53,574
KWON EUNBI DID IT!

711
00:28:53,641 --> 00:28:54,842
Wow!

712
00:28:55,843 --> 00:28:57,545
LOOK AT THEM

713
00:28:58,246 --> 00:29:00,348
O3OHN LETS THEM DOWN BIG TIME

714
00:29:01,048 --> 00:29:02,750
-This is bad.
-Seriously, O3ohn.

715
00:29:02,817 --> 00:29:04,252
I mean…

716
00:29:04,318 --> 00:29:05,520
I told you to…

717
00:29:05,586 --> 00:29:06,988
I told you to push her!

718
00:29:07,755 --> 00:29:09,457
What was that?

719
00:29:10,258 --> 00:29:12,126
It's because he kept talking to me!

720
00:29:14,128 --> 00:29:15,229
You distracted me.

721
00:29:15,296 --> 00:29:17,165
So why did you have to mess around?

722
00:29:17,231 --> 00:29:18,566
Why did you do this?

723
00:29:18,633 --> 00:29:21,135
Why did you have to keep doing this?

724
00:29:21,202 --> 00:29:23,137
EUNBI WINS
GUEST TEAM GETS 100 M DEDUCTED

725
00:29:23,204 --> 00:29:24,539
The last round.

726
00:29:24,605 --> 00:29:26,808
DinDin versus Jang Eunsil.

727
00:29:26,874 --> 00:29:28,743
-Do you want me to go easy on you?
-What?

728
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,478
Should we move that thing away?

729
00:29:30,778 --> 00:29:32,713
STRONGER COMEBACK

730
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,915
I think we should.

731
00:29:34,415 --> 00:29:36,050
SCARED

732
00:29:36,117 --> 00:29:37,485
Just in case, you stand here.

733
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:39,787
I MEAN IT

734
00:29:39,854 --> 00:29:41,289
-Stand here.
-Okay. I'll stand here.

735
00:29:41,355 --> 00:29:43,124
Eunsil, I'm sorry to ask this,

736
00:29:43,191 --> 00:29:44,725
but go easy on him. He might get hurt.

737
00:29:44,792 --> 00:29:45,960
You can't do this.

738
00:29:46,027 --> 00:29:48,362
-You can't grab and twist my hands.
-I won't grab you.

739
00:29:48,429 --> 00:29:49,597
No twisting.

740
00:29:49,664 --> 00:29:50,898
Not the neck either, right?

741
00:29:52,533 --> 00:29:55,670
SUDDENLY HIS LIFE
IS BEING THREATENED

742
00:29:55,736 --> 00:29:58,039
I mean, how can he possibly beat her?

743
00:29:58,773 --> 00:30:00,141
All right. Ready…

744
00:30:01,042 --> 00:30:02,109
go!

745
00:30:06,981 --> 00:30:08,783
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS

746
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,651
THE EYES OF A PREDATOR

747
00:30:10,718 --> 00:30:12,086
We should really get his back.

748
00:30:12,153 --> 00:30:14,222
He might really get thrown back.

749
00:30:14,288 --> 00:30:16,657
LOOKING LIKE
SHE'LL REALLY THROW HIM

750
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:18,326
A LITTLE LAMB THAT'S SO SCARED

751
00:30:18,392 --> 00:30:19,560
Hold on.

752
00:30:20,127 --> 00:30:21,529
Eunsil, hold on.

753
00:30:21,596 --> 00:30:23,264
Eunsil, hold on.

754
00:30:23,731 --> 00:30:25,600
LEGS SHAKING

755
00:30:25,666 --> 00:30:27,201
Eunsil, hold on.

756
00:30:27,268 --> 00:30:29,237
Eunsil, hold on.

757
00:30:29,303 --> 00:30:31,405
Hold on.

758
00:30:31,472 --> 00:30:34,108
What?

759
00:30:34,175 --> 00:30:35,576
CALLS TIME-OUT
TO PROTECT THE PLAYER

760
00:30:35,643 --> 00:30:36,878
Hold on. Time-out.

761
00:30:36,944 --> 00:30:38,512
-This is… Hold on.
-Hold on.

762
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:40,882
My God. Seriously,
she's so freaking scary.

763
00:30:40,948 --> 00:30:42,316
My goodness.

764
00:30:43,751 --> 00:30:45,052
-I'm not gonna lie.
-He's so scared.

765
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:47,388
I get the feeling we'll lose, for real.

766
00:30:47,455 --> 00:30:50,091
I'm not lying.
When she came close, it felt like

767
00:30:50,157 --> 00:30:51,459
my neck was going to snap.

768
00:30:53,227 --> 00:30:54,528
<i>He was all mouth</i>

769
00:30:54,595 --> 00:30:55,930
<i>and got so scared.</i>

770
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:57,765
Scared?

771
00:30:57,832 --> 00:30:59,834
DINDIN IS SCARED

772
00:30:59,901 --> 00:31:01,035
Get ready.

773
00:31:01,102 --> 00:31:02,503
-She's incredible.
-Ready, go!

774
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:03,604
Slowly.

775
00:31:03,671 --> 00:31:05,006
Don't step on the line.

776
00:31:05,706 --> 00:31:06,707
Come on.

777
00:31:07,575 --> 00:31:08,776
OH?

778
00:31:09,477 --> 00:31:11,045
You're so cute.

779
00:31:11,445 --> 00:31:12,847
FEARLESS PROVOCATION

780
00:31:13,414 --> 00:31:14,582
You're cute too.

781
00:31:14,649 --> 00:31:15,783
You're cute too.

782
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:21,088
CUTE EUNSIL'S SINGLE BLOW

783
00:31:21,155 --> 00:31:23,858
<i>I never found her cute</i>
<i>for a single moment.</i>

784
00:31:23,925 --> 00:31:25,927
<i>She was just scary. Absolutely scary.</i>

785
00:31:25,993 --> 00:31:29,497
<i>I'm telling you, it was</i>
<i>one of the scariest moments in my life.</i>

786
00:31:29,563 --> 00:31:30,598
Eunsil wins.

787
00:31:30,665 --> 00:31:33,334
CUTE EUNSIL WINS

788
00:31:33,401 --> 00:31:36,671
BOTH TEAMS GET
A DEDUCTION OF 200 M

789
00:31:36,737 --> 00:31:39,540
-There are no games left now, right?
-No games left.

790
00:31:39,607 --> 00:31:42,109
From now on, you have to keep going
until you finish.

791
00:31:42,176 --> 00:31:43,644
It's a battle of endurance now.

792
00:31:43,711 --> 00:31:45,780
I won't tell you how much you have left
from now on.

793
00:31:47,682 --> 00:31:50,151
<i>I thought, "We don't know when it'll end,</i>
<i>so let's keep going.</i>

794
00:31:50,217 --> 00:31:51,953
<i>Let's see this through."</i>

795
00:31:52,853 --> 00:31:55,089
O3ohn, turn the speed up
and switch when you're done.

796
00:31:56,624 --> 00:31:58,626
<i>Now it's all about mentality,</i>

797
00:31:58,693 --> 00:32:00,895
<i>so I thought if we held out,</i>
<i>we'd win for sure.</i>

798
00:32:00,962 --> 00:32:03,364
Jonathan, if it's hard,
switch after reaching 100 m.

799
00:32:03,431 --> 00:32:04,765
TRYING TO KEEP
THE MOMENTUM GOING

800
00:32:04,832 --> 00:32:06,567
You'll win the keychain anyway.

801
00:32:06,634 --> 00:32:08,869
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

802
00:32:08,936 --> 00:32:10,471
<i>I just hate losing.</i>

803
00:32:11,205 --> 00:32:12,206
Last spurt!

804
00:32:12,273 --> 00:32:13,674
Let's go!

805
00:32:13,741 --> 00:32:15,242
<i>We came all this way to win.</i>

806
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:16,844
<i>Isn't that why you brought us here?</i>

807
00:32:17,378 --> 00:32:21,048
COMPETITIVENESS + SKILLS + STAMINA
THE GUEST TEAM'S THE WHOLE PACKAGE

808
00:32:21,115 --> 00:32:22,950
This is practically a war.

809
00:32:23,451 --> 00:32:25,252
-Eunbi. 20 m left.
-Yes!

810
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:27,388
-Eunbi. 20 m left.
-Yes!

811
00:32:28,589 --> 00:32:30,324
-Eunbi's on!
-Yes, ma'am!

812
00:32:30,825 --> 00:32:33,327
DISCIPLINED LIKE
A SOLDIER AT WAR

813
00:32:33,394 --> 00:32:35,563
She's going at speed 25.
That's incredible.

814
00:32:35,629 --> 00:32:39,333
Last three seconds. Three, two, one.

815
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,103
GRUNTING

816
00:32:42,737 --> 00:32:44,739
FALLING HEROICALLY

817
00:32:44,805 --> 00:32:46,140
PANTING

818
00:32:46,207 --> 00:32:48,409
A little more. Stop. Be careful.

819
00:32:48,476 --> 00:32:49,710
Oh, be careful.

820
00:32:49,777 --> 00:32:51,812
SECOND FALLEN SOLDIER

821
00:32:51,879 --> 00:32:54,015
Why on earth are you going that far?

822
00:32:54,081 --> 00:32:55,216
Because we must win.

823
00:32:55,282 --> 00:32:56,484
Beat us for what?

824
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:57,551
I don't know.

825
00:32:57,618 --> 00:32:58,686
THEY DON'T KNOW WHY

826
00:32:58,753 --> 00:33:00,855
Jonathan, we can't lose
after coming this far.

827
00:33:00,921 --> 00:33:02,723
Or else it'll be so disappointing.

828
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:05,826
NO MATTER WHO ENDS UP WINNING

829
00:33:06,827 --> 00:33:09,296
THE LOSERS OF THIS FIERCE BATTLE
WILL BE DISAPPOINTED

830
00:33:10,564 --> 00:33:12,333
<i>-It's over.</i>
<i>-He said we're finished.</i>

831
00:33:13,034 --> 00:33:15,870
-For real?
-You completed 8,848 m.

832
00:33:15,936 --> 00:33:18,973
Before I tell you which team has won,

833
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,943
I'll tell you how much
each of the anchovies climbed.

834
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:24,912
-Okay.
-Okay.

835
00:33:24,979 --> 00:33:26,580
-Fourth place.
-Can we do third place first?

836
00:33:26,647 --> 00:33:27,782
Fourth place in looks.

837
00:33:27,848 --> 00:33:30,785
4TH PLACE: DANIEL, 1,534 M

838
00:33:30,851 --> 00:33:32,853
Coming in fourth in this as well, Daniel.

839
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,954
Third place.

840
00:33:34,021 --> 00:33:35,890
-Three-3ohn.
-Three-3ohn?

841
00:33:35,956 --> 00:33:38,259
He climbed 1,809 m.

842
00:33:38,325 --> 00:33:39,493
Three-3ohn.

843
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,828
First place.

844
00:33:40,895 --> 00:33:42,029
Jonathan.

845
00:33:42,096 --> 00:33:44,532
He climbed 3,026 m.

846
00:33:47,268 --> 00:33:49,170
-Then first place wins the keychain.
-Correct.

847
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:50,905
-If we win.
-Yes.

848
00:33:50,971 --> 00:33:53,307
You guys really climbed so high.

849
00:33:53,374 --> 00:33:57,044
Now, I'll announce the winning team.

850
00:33:57,912 --> 00:33:59,080
It was neck and neck.

851
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,282
I'll tell you the result.

852
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:03,951
The winning team…

853
00:34:05,753 --> 00:34:07,555
won by just 30 m.

854
00:34:07,621 --> 00:34:09,023
-Wow.
-Wow.

855
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:12,159
A DIFFERENT OF JUST 30 M

856
00:34:12,726 --> 00:34:14,261
WHICH TEAM WON?

857
00:34:14,328 --> 00:34:15,329
The winning team…

858
00:34:16,464 --> 00:34:17,832
is the Guest Team.

859
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:19,834
We won?

860
00:34:20,668 --> 00:34:24,238
THE NEWLY FORMED TEAM WON
WITH PERFECT TEAMWORK

861
00:34:24,305 --> 00:34:25,806
This is insane!

862
00:34:26,941 --> 00:34:29,076
Can you believe this?
It doesn't make sense.

863
00:34:29,143 --> 00:34:30,811
Why?

864
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:32,480
Jang Eunsil

865
00:34:32,546 --> 00:34:36,183
<i>kept climbing 200 m and 300 m at speed 25</i>
<i>and kept closing the gap.</i>

866
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:39,019
That played the biggest role
to turn the tables.

867
00:34:40,054 --> 00:34:41,055
She carried us.

868
00:34:41,122 --> 00:34:42,990
-Good job!
-She carried the team.

869
00:34:43,057 --> 00:34:45,259
Eunsil climbed 3,236 m.

870
00:34:45,326 --> 00:34:46,827
-What, 200?
-So she's first place?

871
00:34:46,894 --> 00:34:48,929
210 M MORE THAN JONATHAN

872
00:34:48,996 --> 00:34:50,464
Thank you.

873
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:53,234
<i>-I did my best.</i>
<i>-You're so cool.</i>

874
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,768
<i>That's amazing.</i>

875
00:34:54,835 --> 00:34:56,036
-One, two, three.
-Two, three.

876
00:34:56,103 --> 00:34:58,539
THE PRIZE IS
TOP-QUALITY JUKBANG ANCHOVIES

877
00:34:58,606 --> 00:34:59,740
<i>Jukbang</i>!

878
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:01,041
Thank you!

879
00:35:02,042 --> 00:35:03,043
EVERYONE IS IN GOOD SPIRITS…

880
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,745
-It's <i>jukbang</i> anchovies.
-<i>Jukbang.</i>

881
00:35:04,812 --> 00:35:06,714
…BUT ONE PERSON ISN'T SMILING

882
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,115
-Awesome.
-I love it.

883
00:35:08,182 --> 00:35:09,550
That's not what's important.

884
00:35:09,617 --> 00:35:11,819
It's just a pity for us, but for him…

885
00:35:12,353 --> 00:35:13,821
After climbing 3,000 m,

886
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:16,190
-he can't get the keychain.
-Keychain!

887
00:35:16,857 --> 00:35:19,493
1ST PLACE ON THE TEAM
BUT COULDN'T GET THE KEYCHAIN

888
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,096
<i>I only thought about the keychain.</i>

889
00:35:22,596 --> 00:35:24,798
<i>Keychain.</i>

890
00:35:24,865 --> 00:35:26,066
<i>It gave me strength.</i>

891
00:35:27,434 --> 00:35:30,104
BUT THE GODDESS OF ANCHOVIES
TURNED HER BACK ON HIM

892
00:35:31,105 --> 00:35:33,641
JONATHAN'S CHALLENGE
ENDED IN TRAGEDY

893
00:35:33,707 --> 00:35:36,677
I'm so happy we beat the anchovies.
It feels so rewarding.

894
00:35:36,744 --> 00:35:40,481
With the four of us as a team, I think
we'll beat them at another mission.

895
00:35:40,548 --> 00:35:42,016
Whenever you call us.

896
00:35:43,284 --> 00:35:45,319
I learned a great lesson.

897
00:35:45,386 --> 00:35:48,822
That I should check the contract
thoroughly before I make a decision.

898
00:35:48,889 --> 00:35:50,224
Goodbye.
