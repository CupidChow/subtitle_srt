ANCHOVY PHYSICAL CAMP

2
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,443
Okay.
Let's only eat what each of us found.

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,412
-Okay. I'm okay with that.
-Okay.

4
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:14,280
I only have seasoned salt.

5
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:15,815
We should share the food.

6
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:18,718
Let's grill them well.

7
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:20,053
They look so good.

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,287
Wow, you're good.

9
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:23,890
-I think they're almost done.
-Good.

10
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:25,792
-The stew looks…
-It looks delicious.

11
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,193
Yes, it looks delicious.

12
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:29,763
This feels like a camping trip.

13
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:32,198
It's a camping trip
with just my guy friends.

14
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:35,201
-This actually looks like quite a spread.
-It does.

15
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:37,337
It's quite romantic, with the rain.

16
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:39,406
-Let's dig in!
-Let's dig in!

17
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:45,979
"DIGGING IN AS THEY'RE EXHAUSTED"

18
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,047
It's so good.

19
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:51,785
"BUT WHY IS DANIEL EATING WITH THEM?"

20
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:54,421
<i>I teased them about their contribution,</i>

21
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:57,390
<i>but if they don't eat and have no energy,</i>
<i>I can't go home.</i>

TO GO HOME EARLY"

23
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:01,127
-It's good.
-It's more than enough.

24
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:03,797
We'll finish the mission in no time
after replenishing our energy with this.

25
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,767
By the way,
I think sit-ups are easier than push-ups.

26
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:09,135
For me, sit-ups are much harder.

27
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:10,203
-Really?
-For me too.

28
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,304
I'm already exhausted.

29
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:13,506
Actually, I do it even when I'm eating.

30
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,974
"HE STARTS BLUFFING
NOW THAT HIS BELLY'S FULL"

31
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:20,046
Now that we've had a nice meal
with a nice chat, let's nap and go home.

32
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:22,382
After a nap,
we'll finish the mission in no time.

33
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:23,450
You should eat more.

34
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:25,118
-Yeah, Jonathan. Eat some more.
-No, I'm done.

35
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:26,186
We can clean up after.

36
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,154
AFTER THE RELAXING LUNCH WITH BLUFFING…

37
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,558
THE EXERCISE RESUMES

38
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:33,593
-Our bellies are full. Let's do this.
-Let's go!

39
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,761

00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:36,863
-Physical camp!
-Physical camp!

41
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,098
Okay, let's go.

42
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:40,767
Let's go, DinDin.

43
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:43,236
Okay. I'm confident about my sit-ups.

44
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:44,471
Let's go.

00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,806
"HERE GOES TODAY'S ACE"

46
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:48,274
-Looking great.
-Two.

47
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:49,943
-Good!
-Up, up.

48
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,945
-Let's go!
-Up. Up.

49
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:54,914
Hey, I think he's struggling a bit.

50
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:56,516
Come on, you're our ace!

51
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:57,951
Our one and only ace, DinDin.

00:01:58,017 --> 00:01:59,953
"HIS FACE IS RED AFTER ONLY 6 SIT-UPS"

53
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,921
It's not easy.

54
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:03,890
He's struggling. What's going on?

55
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,391
My body feels so freaking heavy.

56
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,793
-What?
-I feel so heavy.

57
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,561
Oh, no.

58
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:10,463
Let's go.

59
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,933

00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,203
Why do I feel so tired?

62
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,372
-Seriously, your abs give out.
-Really? They give out?

63
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,241
Hey, we might end up
ringing the bell today.

64
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:22,475
Yes, we're very close to ringing it.

"FACING CRISIS IN THE SECOND FILMING"

66
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,580
By the way, when did we lose momentum?

67
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,849
Didn't we do it really fast earlier?

68
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,284
-It's because we're full now.
-Right.

69
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:32,919
Why did we have to eat?

70
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,688
We should've just had
some seasoned salt and continued.

71
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:38,024
Why did you grill the meat?

72
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:39,959
Do you think we're on a camping trip?

73
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,630
This feels like a camping trip.

74
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,865
<i>It's a camping trip</i>
<i>with just my guy friends.</i>

75
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:46,933
IT WAS A PLEASURE WITHOUT RESPONSIBILITY

76
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:50,970
Why did you have to talk about
your celebrity worship syndrome and debut?

77
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:54,340
-Why did you talk about <i>Show Me the Money?</i>
-Damn it.

78
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:57,777

-Okay.
-Hold on. The pork belly…

81
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,018
I still feel it in here.

82
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:07,320

00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,464
One.

87
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:20,733

What? Hey!

91
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:31,844
WHAT WAS THAT

92
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:33,513
JUST NOW?

93
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:41,588
Okay! Okay.

94
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,891
I couldn't help it, you know?

95
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,759
I couldn't help it!

96
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:48,695
I mean, you can't hold in a fart.

I'm so ashamed!

100
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:57,003

-It was so…

103
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:03,176
If I fart three times like this,
will you give me 15 points?

104
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,179
-But what about our lives?
-No, Daniel, it's okay.

105
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,313
-It's okay?
-Yeah.

00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,187
Did he only fart for real?

109
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,888
I'll count those as five, but that's it.

110
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:17,257

-Yes.

113
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,599
-…we'll play an outdoor game.
-Okay.

114
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,168
-What?
-There are 400 deductions on the line.

115
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:30,370
-Okay.
-Okay.

116
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,039
This game will test
how strong your suction power is.

117
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,107
Suction power?

118
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:36,109
-It's called "Human Suction."
-What?

119
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:38,578
Oh, I think it's that game
with a really long straw.

120
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:40,613
-What's that?
-In Human Suction,

121
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,416
we'll put a Mentos
in a 500 ml bottle of Coke,

122
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:46,352
and you'll cover the opening
with your mouth to avoid any leaks.

123
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:47,453
-Come on!
-Come on!

124
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,188
How can we do that?

125
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:51,124
-Is it doable?
-Is it even possible?

126
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,492
There's someone who did it.

127
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:53,726
-In here?
-Yes.

128
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:54,994

"IS IT REALLY POSSIBLE?"

137
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:19,619
I'll give it a try.

138
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:22,622
Now's not the time
to be picky about the game.

139
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:24,123
Let's go. We can do it.

Gosh, it's a lot.

145
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,532
I don't think
I could drink the entire bottle alone.

146
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,100
As soon as you open it,

147
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,202
-put a Mentos in…
-Okay.

148
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,604
…and immediately cover it with your mouth
because it'll explode right away.

-Here I go.
-Okay.

150
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,776
Since you're quite a big guy,
I think you'll take it easily.

-What the hell are you doing?
-It's impossible.

-Daniel.
-It's no joke.

It spills out through here.

169
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:31,624
The sides.

170
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,960

00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,335
You have a suitable mouth for this.

176
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,036
-I do have a big mouth.
-Yes, it's good.

177
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:45,738
Okay.

178
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:47,306
-Right away?
-Yes. Okay.

179
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:48,574
Here I go.

180
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:50,676
-I'll put it in.
-Cover it right away.

181
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:53,746
Hey!

182

"COUGHING"

183
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,018
How was it?

184
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:01,587
You see what I mean, right?

185
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:04,657
-It catches you off guard.
-It went into his nose.

186
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:05,825
It comes out through the nose.

187
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,229
"COMING OUT OF HIS NOSE"

188
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,966
I tried my best to drink it all, but…

189
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,068
-Can't you just drink it?
-No, you can't.

190
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:18,070
"SO YOU CAN'T JUST DRINK IT EITHER…"

191
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:19,138
Jonathan.

192
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,674
Try to block it with your tongue

193
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:24,410
to narrow the gap,
and just drink it like this.

194
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:27,180
-So you should…
-Little by little.

195
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:28,714
-Don't just use the mouth.
-Use your mouth first

196
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:29,782
and then your tongue.

197
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:30,983
Yes, like that.

198
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,819
Try it with your tongue.

199
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,221
-Yes, like that.
-Yes.

200
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,456
-And…
-Otherwise…

201
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:38,825
-…just drink what leaks out.
-…it's impossible.

202
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:41,294
Try to make a vacuum with your mouth.

203
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:43,796
Okay. Here I go.

204
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:45,097
-You can do this!
-Here I go.

205
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:46,232
Here you go.

206
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:48,067
I'll put it in.

207
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:03,282

210
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,498
-Did the tongue not work?
-Hey.

211
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:19,699
-It didn't work?
-Why didn't you use your tongue?

212
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:20,967
My tongue…

213
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:22,935
It just came back up.

214
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:25,304
"SO THAT DIDN'T WORK EITHER…"

215
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:26,973
How are we supposed to succeed?

216
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,407
I think it takes some time

217
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:30,643
for it to come up
after you put in the Mentos.

218
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:31,711
Right.

219
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:34,780
AFTER THE MENTOS IS DROPPED IN,

220
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:37,583
THE BUBBLES COME UP A BIT LATER

221
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,353
So I think it's better to start drinking
as soon as it's in.

222
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:41,454
"OH…?"

223
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,822
Open this for me.

224
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:44,290
Remember, the bubbles come out nonstop.

225
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,725
-Will you swallow it?
-Yes, as soon as it's in.

226
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,093
-So will you drink it?
-Hold on.

228
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:51,297
-Okay.
-You can do this, DinDin.

229
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:53,332
Please, save us all.

230
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:58,738

-DinDin has succeeded,

-How?

00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:48,020
If it went in the wrong way,
it would've come out of my nose.

245
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,922
But I swallowed it right away.

246
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,491
And so, my throat opened.

247
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:55,895
Then it all came pouring in,
whether or not I intended it.

248

-Of course.

351
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,693
he's doing it all in the proper posture.

352
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,761
-Tell me about it.
-Eight.

353
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:50,429
Nine.

354
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,664
-Ten.
-Ten.

355
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,232
-He's done 20?
-How many is he doing?

356
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:54,567
Daniel.

357
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:56,135
-He's so fast.
-Daniel.

358
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:57,736
Four.

359
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:59,205
"DANIEL IS SPEEDING UP"

360
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:01,707
But where is this energy coming from?

361
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:02,942
-Exactly.
-Three.

362
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,144
-There's no rebound either.
-He's doing it properly.

363
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:06,879
-Incredible.
-He's only using his muscles.

364
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,381
-Wow.
-You can do it?

365
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:11,283
"DANIEL GOT A SECOND WIND
DOWN THE STRETCH"

366
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,351
He's got a second wind.

367
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,286
-Wow, doing more right away?
-Wow.

368
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:15,788
Nine.

369
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:17,289
Ten.

370
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,692
Wow, he's incredible. This is insane.

371
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,493
"HE'S STILL GOING?"

372
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,862
I should do more while I can.

373
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,964
WOW…

374
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:27,433
JONATHAN BECOMES 3RD PLACE

375
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:30,703
Wow, Daniel is catching up a lot
down the stretch.

376
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,671
Wow, he's impressive.

377
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:35,407
<i>Last time and this time as well,</i>

378
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:36,976
<i>I think Daniel's pretending.</i>

379
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:41,380
<i>I think he's pretending to be weak</i>
<i>to create tension in the beginning.</i>

380
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,649
<i>In the beginning, I thought,</i>
<i>"Why is he so weak?"</i>

381
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,918
<i>But down the stretch, he looks so cool.</i>

382
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:47,987
<i>He's incredibly persistent.</i>

383
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:50,890
"HE SECURES A SOLID 2ND PLACE"

384
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:51,957
Stop it now.

385
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:55,427
THE GAP BETWEEN HIM
AND DINDIN IN 1ST PLACE IS NOW 30

386
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:57,029
CHOI DANIEL: 825
DINDIN: 856

387
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:58,597
CURRENT COUNT: 3,140

388
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:01,100
A total of 250 sit-ups is on the line.

389
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,269
We'll test how good your reasoning is

390
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:06,572
with the "Ramen Blind Tasting."

391
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,174
Will only one of us do it?

392
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,376
Only one of you will do it.

393
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,011
First, Shin Ramyun.

394
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,779
"A SPICY MUSHROOMY FLAVOR"

395
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:14,947
Second, Jin Ramen Spicy.

396
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,383
"A SPICINESS THAT SPREADS SLOWLY"

397
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:18,450
Third, Yeul Ramen.

398
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:20,586
"A STRONG SPICINESS
THAT IMMEDIATELY KICKS IN"

399
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:21,654
Fourth, Samyang Ramen.

400
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,156
"A UNIQUE HAM FLAVOR"

401
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:25,324
Lastly, Ansungtangmyun.

402
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:27,726
"A SAVORY BROTH WITH A DOENJANG BASE"

403
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:30,429
-Hey, that's easy.
-We prepared five different ramen.

404
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,400
The count of ramen you guess correctly
will be multiplied by 50

405
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,769
to calculate how many sit-ups
will be deducted.

406
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:38,003
This is incredible.

407
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,505
You like ramen, right?

408
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:40,572
I love it.

409
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:42,241
I really like ramen.

410
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:43,475
Have you tried different brands?

411
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:45,277
-I have.
-All right.

412
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:46,412
But…

413
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:48,347
What I'm worried about is

414
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:51,083
that Jonathan's been doing
a terrible job so far today.

415
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,252
-Well…
-Right. It doesn't feel good.

416
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,722
HE FAILED HUMAN SUCTION

417
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:59,658
EATING HOT SWEET POTATO FAST,
WAS ENTIRELY EDITED OUT

418
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:02,928
HE EVEN BURNED THE ROOF OF HIS MOUTH

419
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,366
BUT HE LOST TO IRON TONGUE

420
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,869
I'm really sorry about earlier. I mean it.

421
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:13,072
-I'm so sorry I didn't do well earlier.
-All right, you do it.

422
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,606
-You do it, Jonathan.
-Are you confident?

423
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:15,708
I sure am.

424
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:17,042
-You do it.
-Let's go then.

425
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:18,911
-Okay, let's go.
-You do it.

426
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:21,347
You do it.

427
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:25,417
JONATHAN GAINED THEIR TRUST ONCE AGAIN

428
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,287
A TOTAL OF 860 SIT-UPS REMAIN

429
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:30,689
This is the last game we prepared.

430
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,925
Let's go, Jonathan!

431
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,493
I trust you, Jonathan.

432
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,563
If we fail this, we seriously
need to consider ringing the bell.

433
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:48,040
-Give it to me.
-Here we go.

434
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,541
Set, go.

435
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:51,443
RAMEN BLIND TASTING

436
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,279
THE FIRST RAMEN

437
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:04,757
Gosh, I recognize you, buddy.

438
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:11,830
I've got the answer.

439
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:12,965
This is Shin Ramyun.

440
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:17,236
"HOW DID HE ANSWER SO FAST?"

441
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:19,238
It's Shin Ramyun. Where do I put it down?

442
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:20,339
We'll get it for you.

443
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,207
Line them up in order.

444
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:24,009
He answered the first one as Shin Ramyun.

445
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:28,547
I definitely tasted
the basic taste of Shin Ramyun.

446
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:32,184
And as I always say,
it has the mushroom flavor.

447
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:33,485
It lingers in my mouth.

448
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:34,720
You're so sharp.

449
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,121
Jonathan, get the water.

450
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:38,323
Rinse your mouth.

451
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,493
RINSING HIS MOUTH FOR THE NEXT RAMEN

452
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,563
IS THE 1ST ONE SHIN RAMYUN?

453
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,298
-This is the next one, right?
-Yes.

454
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:47,633
"THE SECOND RAMEN"

455
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:49,034
Why am I so nervous?

456
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:55,541
Oh, this one is Ansungtangmyun.

457
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:57,576
"ANSWERING WITHOUT HESITATION"

458
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:59,078
He knows as soon as he tastes it.

459
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:00,145
Here I go.

460
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:03,882
"THE THIRD RAMEN"

461
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:07,186
<i>My friend forever</i>

462
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,554
This is Samyang Ramen!

463
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,656
"LAUGHING"

464
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:12,157
Are you serious?

465
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:13,425
-He's incredible.
-Are you serious?

466
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:14,760
Great!

467
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,430
It's definitely Samyang Ramen.
I have nothing more to say.

468
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:19,832
Gosh, he's…

469
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:21,400
He's like a master.

470
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:23,368
-He looks so cool right now.
-Right.

471
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,471
It's starting to feel like
those eyes on the sleep mask are his.

472
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,108
Rinse it.

473
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:30,976
Here I go.

474
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,613
"THE FOURTH RAMEN"

475
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,716
-What?
-This one is…

476
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:38,917
Are you feeling it?

477
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:40,385
"WILL HE RECOGNIZE IT WITH A BITE AGAIN?"

478
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,453
My mouth is watering.

479
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:44,957
Hold on a minute.

480
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:46,125
Give him some time.

481
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:50,696
"FIRST BRAKE"

482
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:54,433
-He makes it look so delicious.
-Hold on.

What is this?

484
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,636
What is this?

485
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,438
Hey. Come on.

486
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,976
Put this one on hold.
Let me move on to the next one right away.

487
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:05,144
Put this one on hold.

488
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,780
"THE LAST RAMEN HE ASKED FOR URGENTLY"

489
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:13,018
What?

490
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:16,889
What? Hold on.

491
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,791
-You shouldn't eat too much.
-Try tasting the broth.

"SIGHING"

00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:32,337
This one and the one I put on hold earlier

494
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:34,206
are Yeul Ramen and Jin Ramen Spicy.

495
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:36,742
Jin Ramen Spicy's kick comes slowly.

496
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:37,910
It gets spicy slowly.

497
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:39,244
But with Yeul Ramen,

498
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:40,979
it's spicy as soon as you take a bite.

499
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:44,650
It starts shooting
as soon as it lands on your tongue.

500
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:49,054
I'm sure these two are
Yeul Ramen and Jin Ramen Spicy.

501
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:51,823
Assistant.

502
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,795
-He's enjoying it.
-They're great together.

503
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,163
They look good together.

504
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:01,233
Here's the first one you put on hold.

505
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,302
Right, the first one on hold.
Chopsticks, please.

"Chopsticks."

Recall it.

510
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:12,711
Recall it, Jonathan.
Give me the second one right away.

"FIND THE ONE THAT GIVES THE KICK FASTER"

00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:25,190
This is driving me crazy.

516
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:26,358
This is insane.

517
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:31,430
Jonathan, this is your chance
to be our hero.

518
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:38,203

Let's go, Jonathan.

523
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,478
Trust yourself! Believe in yourself!

524
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:48,814
Wow, it'd be amazing
if he got them all right.

525
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:51,817
Jonathan, please take off the sleep mask.

526
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:53,552
Man, I'm so nervous.

527
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:54,686

Your answer for the first was Shin Ramyun.

532
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:05,697

Since Jonathan played this game

577
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:52,938
he will be allotting

578

But my goal is to win an anchovy keychain,

00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:04,349
I'm so touched.

705
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:07,519
<i>I don't want to admit it,</i>
<i>but he felt really dependable.</i>

706
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,288
You have 13 sit-ups remaining.

707
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,157
O3ohn, we're almost there!

708
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:14,759
"O3OHN TRIES TO BE THE ONE TO FINISH IT"

709
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:15,827
Two!

710
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:17,595
Three!

711
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:19,431
-Three.
-Three.

712
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:21,399
-Four.
-Four.

713
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:22,701
-Five!
-Five!

714
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:24,369
-Six!
-Six!

715
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:26,538
-Two more!
-Seven!

716
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:28,907
-The last one!
-The last one!

717
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:38,349
This is what I was talking about.

718
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:43,221
Good job.

719
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:45,223
DinDin, 1,078.

720
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:48,193
Choi Daniel, 1,047.

721
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:51,029
Jonathan, 975.

722
00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:52,931
O3ohn, 900.

723
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:57,635
Watching Daniel and DinDin, I felt like…

724
00:28:57,702 --> 00:29:00,338
Well, Jonathan actually felt
really dependable too.

725
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,406
I have to say,

726
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:03,108
all of them were so cool today.

727
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:05,977
I'm so sorry and also grateful for today.

728
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:09,581
We had strong teamwork today.
The push-up mission really bonded us.

729
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,082
We still got it.

730
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,818
All of us did a great job.
Everyone did so well.

731
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:15,220
We cleared 4,000 sit-ups, after all.

732
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:18,923
"Man, this is so tough,
but these guys are doing it with me."

733
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:23,762
I felt admiration and respect
from watching them work so hard.

734
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:25,463
How should I put it?

735
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:29,067
I felt a strange feeling inside me.
I was moved.

736
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,936
I think we've formed
some kind of comradeship

737
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:33,471
and a deeper friendship.

738
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:35,006
Good work, everyone.

739
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:39,477
THE 2ND ANCHOVY PHYSICAL CAMP ENDS
