00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,203
THE THIRD DEDUCTION GAME:
1-ON-4 ARM WRESTLING

2
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:15,315
IT ENDED
WITH THE STAFF'S VICTORY

3
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:21,354
1,200 PUSH-UPS LEFT TO DO

4
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:26,292
THEY LOST THEIR FIGHTING SPIRIT
AFTER THE ARM WRESTLING

5
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,362
It's starting to get mentally challenging.

6
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,699
SHOCKED BY TWO LOSSES IN A ROW

7
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:34,634
I need food.

8
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,106
I'm low on sugar.

9
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:42,509
It's actually lunchtime right now.

10
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:43,710
You're right.

11
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:46,679
Since this is the Secluded Training,

12
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:49,115
we weren't going to
provide you with lunch.

13
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:50,784
That's not secluded training.

14
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,218
That's just abuse.

15
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:55,055
I'd rather go to prison
where we'd at least be fed.

16
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:58,425
Instead, if you use your go-out pass,

17
00:00:58,491 --> 00:00:59,659
we'll give you 10 minutes.

18
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,161
You can go to the convenience store.

19
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,996
"A GO-OUT PASS?"

20
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,131
Ten minutes? Ten minutes of free time?

21
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:09,269
Some of our staff members
have unique abilities.

22
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:12,038
You can use the pass
if you win against them.

23
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:13,940
Would you like to use the pass?

24
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:15,175
-Yes!
-Yes!

25
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,876
There are four gatekeepers.

26
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:18,011
Raise your hands, please.

27
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:20,547
I know all of them.

28
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:22,182
Yongjun?

29
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:25,485
WHO IS YONGJUN?

30
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:26,986
RAISING HIS HAND

31
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:29,289
IT'S ME, THE ARM WRESTLER

32
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:32,492
We don't want him.

33
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:33,560
"TRAUMATIZED"

34
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:35,462
-I'll tell you their nicknames.
-Okay.

35
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:37,230
-That's Hellboy.
-He definitely looks like it.

36
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:39,065
-That's Iron Tongue.
-Is it something verbal?

37
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:40,700
-That's Bubble Gun.
-"Bubble Gun"?

38
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:41,768
He's Air Controller.

39
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:43,636
Does he control air?

40
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:46,539
They all copied
something that sounds cool.

41
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,942
-They sound so special.
-Right.

42
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:50,443
-Make your choice.
-Who should we pick?

43
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,812
-We won't choose Hellboy.
-That's for sure.

44
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,547
My wrist still hurts
from the arm wrestling.

45
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:55,815
We're not choosing him.

46
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:59,552
Judging by "Air," it could be something
like enduring strong wind.

47
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,488
"SOMEONE WHO CONTROLS THE AIR?"

48
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:02,789
Could it be whistling?

49
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,258
"GOOD POINT!"

50
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:06,326
Can you whistle?

51
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:07,427
-Not really.
-I can't.

52
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:08,495
I'm good at it.

53
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,432
-Hey.
-Let's do this.

54
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,334
-He's good.
-Should we choose Air Controller?

55
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,770
-Okay. Air Controller.
-We choose Air Controller.

56
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:20,640
Okay. Now, tell them your unique ability.

57
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:22,609
The name Air Controller sounds so special.

58
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:23,977
"WHAT'S HIS ABILITY?"

59
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:27,313
I can burp whenever I want.

60
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:33,453
"WHAT DID HE SAY?"

61
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:35,622
Damn it.

62
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:39,626
So?

63
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:41,227
Will this be all right to air?

64
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,029
What is this nonsense?

65
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:44,864
It's a one-on-four battle.

66
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:47,400
You exchange burps to eliminate the other.

67
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:50,904
What on earth is this game?

68
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:52,572
HE CAN ONLY LAUGH

69
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,407
GO-OUT PASS GAME:
1-ON-4 BURP CONTROL

70
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:55,675
Let's start right away.

71
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:56,776
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

72
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,411
Producer Son Taeho,
please move into position.

73
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:00,446
"HERE COMES AIR CONTROLLER"

74
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,514
Ready, set…

75
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:02,582
AIR CONTROLLER ATTACKS FIRST

76
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:05,485
THE GO-OUT PASS IS ON THE LINE!

77
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,420
FOCUSING HIS ENERGY

78
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:09,589
Go!

79
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,258
Damn it.

80
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,929
-Start right away. One, two, three.
-Right away?

81
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:19,566
"GRUNTING"

82
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:20,633
Jonathan, out.

83
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,734
That doesn't count?

84
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:35,782
O3ohn, out.

85
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:37,250
Damn it, I hate this.

86
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:39,352
Here we go again.

87
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:40,520
Please start right away.

88
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:53,666
FIERCE AIR CONTROLLING

89
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,101
NECK AND NECK

90
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:02,408
GRUNTING

91
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:04,911
All right, all right!

92
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:06,512
-He failed!
-He failed!

93
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:07,847
GRUNTING

94
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:11,818
I COULD DO THIS ALL DAY

95
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:13,753
THEY WIN
THE 10-MINUTE GO-OUT PASS

96
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,954
We won!

97
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,022
-Nice.
-We won.

98
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,657
Even monkeys fall from trees.

99
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:21,761
-You may go now.
-Okay.

100
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,296
-Let's go.
-Ten minutes?

101
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:26,032
"SUCH PRECIOUS 10 MINUTES
THEY WON"

102
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,800
We must hurry.

103
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,103
Hey, there's a convenience store's there!

104
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:31,504
Hurry up and pick what you want.

105
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:32,639
I need biscuits.

106
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:33,940
Where are the instant noodles?

107
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,008
Let's run back.

108
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:36,175
Thank you.

109
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:37,243
"LUNCHTIME"

110
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,745
Let's eat comfortably.

111
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:45,251
It's like an oasis in a desert.

112
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:47,920
"THE ANCHOVIES FILL UP
THEIR STOMACHS"

113
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:49,522
Why is it so good?

114
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:50,757
It's so good.

115
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:53,793
"Sweet after bitter," like they say.

116
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:56,996
-I'm getting sleepy.
-Me too.

117
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:58,264
We can take a nap, right?

118
00:04:58,331 --> 00:04:59,699
My eyelids feel heavy.

119
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,501
You can lie down and get some rest.

120
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,169
"NAP TIME"

121
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:04,737
Let's take a nap.

122
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,811
"THE ANCHOVIES LIE DOWN
ONE BY ONE"

123
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,414
Wow, it feels good.

124
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:15,948
This is surprisingly comfortable.

125
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:17,016
-Right?
-Yes.

126
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,351
It's nice.

127
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,053
Gosh, it feels so good.

128
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:22,121
This is a first for me.

129
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:26,592
THEY PASS OUT UPON LYING DOWN

130
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:34,567
EXERCISE, MEAL, NAP = HEAVEN

131
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:42,909
You know, sometimes I think
that insomnia is…

132
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:46,012
just for show.

133
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,548
Spend one day in this camp,

134
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,818
-Right.
-and they would sleep like a baby.

135
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,756
Your insomnia will go away
if you join <i>Anchovy Physical Camp.</i>

Rise and shine.

142
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:34,594
Nap time's over.
You slept for about an hour.

143
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,597
It was the sweetest sleep
I've had recently.

144
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:40,299
I had such a good nap.

145
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,268
I'm ready.

146
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:43,469
"A TOTAL OF 861 PUSH-UPS SO FAR"

147
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,139
-It's been a while since I took a nap.
-Me too.

148
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,807
-It's nice.
-It is.

149
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:50,410
This feels

150
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:51,978
a bit like a retreat.

151
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:53,980
-A retreat?
-Yeah, like a school retreat.

152
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:55,815
Anyway, this is nice.

153
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:57,950
So now,

154
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:00,052
how many push-ups are left
until another game?

155
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,789
You only have 139 left
until the deduction game.

156
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:04,757
Anyone who can should go first.

157
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:06,526
I'll do nine first then.

158
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,593
"DINDIN GOES FIRST"

00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:10,596

160
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:15,435
My muscles are already complaining.

"ALREADY MAKING A FUSS"

162
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,938
I'm telling them I haven't started.

00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,543
-Goodness.
-We must do it.

164
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,945
-No, this is bad!
-Hey!

165
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:29,382
-No, this is bad!
-Hey!

166

-Come on, you can't be like that.
-No!

167
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:32,985
-No!
-Come on.

168
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:35,855
I'm in trouble.

169
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:37,056
How bad is it?

170
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,558
Are you being serious?

171
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,792
I swear, I'm serious.

172
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:40,860
Seriously?

00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:43,529
"2ND TRY"

174
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:45,665
Try it in all seriousness, DinDin.

175
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:47,767
-No fooling around this time.
-Right.

176
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:51,704
WHAT?

177
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,841
DINDIN'S MUSCLES
JUST STOPPED WORKING

It's really bad.

180
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:02,882
-You can't do it at all?
-I'm serious.

181
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,383
I mean, I can't get back up.

-Really?

We'll do the rest for you.

186
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:11,891
-We'll do it.
-Yeah.

187
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,594

-Hold on.

199
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,552
He's in trouble too.

200
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,621

-Wow, O3ohn's really good.

-Why?

213
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:15,421
When I still had energy left earlier,
I was like, "You do more."

214

But now I can't do any more
because I physically can't.

225

-Yes, I think so.
-Wow, you're so resilient.

00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,005
-That was good.
-You're breaking my heart.

358
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:42,441
Seriously, I used all energy I had left

359
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:44,743
-to do those two push-ups.
-For real.

360
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:45,811
I can't do any more.

361
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:47,913
Just leave it to us now.

362
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,148
We'll finish it.

363
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:51,150
You did your best.

364
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:52,851
You did your best.

365
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:55,654
Hey, I'll do it.

366
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:56,822
-How many?
-Right now?

367
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,157
"THE ELDEST SUDDENLY STEPS UP"

368
00:15:58,223 --> 00:15:59,925
I'll know once I start.

369
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:01,994
DANIEL…

370
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:06,198
WHY BE RECKLESS
WHEN YOU STRUGGLED LIKE THIS?

371
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:11,570
One. Two. Three.

372
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,705
How are you doing this?

373
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:14,640
Wow, how is he doing that?

374
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:16,175
I think he's got a second wind.

375
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:17,576
Seven.

376
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,378
Wow, he's still strong enough.

377
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,247
-Wow.
-You're doing more right away?

378
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,789
Daniel, you're going right away?

379
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:32,057
Yes, I'll do it.

380
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:33,258
What on earth?

381
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,027
How is this possible?

382
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:37,196
<i>Wow, how is that possible?</i>

383
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:38,964
<i>I think he's done more than any of us.</i>

384
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:40,666
<i>He just did 30 by himself.</i>

385
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,301
He's insane.

386
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:48,374
All right. I'll stop for now.

387
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,641
I'll stop for now.

388
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,811
I mean, I thought you were…

389
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:54,913
Weren't you almost done in the beginning?

390
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,048
I feel like I'm gonna cry.

391
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:57,883
"THE ELDEST SHINING
IN THE HOUR OF NEED"

392
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,085
-I think we're ready for the game.
-Yes, we unlocked it.

393
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:01,220
"250 PUSH-UPS LEFT!"

394
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:02,521
How many are there left now?

395
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:03,922
You have 250 left.

396
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:05,190
Just 250 left?

397
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:06,625
-Yes.
-If we win, then it'll be 50.

398
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,061
I'll explain the last game.

399
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:11,296
It's a game that will test your patience.

400
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:16,135
It's called "Endure Finger Flick."

401
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,636
-I can do this.
-I can…

402
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,704
You can do this?

403
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,639
Because it's all about just enduring.

404
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,741
-I can endure it.
-Without batting an eye?

405
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:24,276
I might bat an eye, but I'll do this.

406
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,946
Yes, just put on that annoying look.

407
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:29,448
Everyone.

408
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:32,551
It'll be a four-on-one finger flick
with Hellboy.

409
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:33,619
Okay.

410
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,622
Hellboy will attack first.

411
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:37,923
"LIKE THIS"

412
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,358
-Like this?
-Like this?

413
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,427
Wait, if Hellboy does that…

414
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:44,763
That'll break our necks, seriously.

415
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,098
-I'll explain the rules.
-Okay.

416
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:47,766
-Hellboy will hit you first.
-Right.

417
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,701
If you endure it poker-faced
for three seconds,

418
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:50,769
200 push-ups will be deducted.

419
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:51,870
-Okay.
-Okay.

420
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:54,373
-I'll go first then.
-Okay.

421
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,974
Someone hold his camera for him.

422
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:58,143
We'll count to three next to you.

423
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,311
THE CHIEF CAMERAMAN
HOLDS THE CAMERA

424
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:07,086
HELLBOY LOOKS SOMEWHAT NERVOUS

425
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:09,021
My flicks are weak this way.

426
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:10,856
They're strong.

427
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:14,226
"FLICK"

428
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:15,561
Was that your best?

429
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:16,662
Yes, it was.

430
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:19,231
"CONFUSED"

431
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:23,435
His flicks are weak.

432
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:25,671
-What?
-His flicks are weak.

433
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:28,974
"PRICKING UP THEIR EARS"

434
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,445
Hold on a minute.

435
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:34,513
No, let's do this now.

436
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,747
No, let's do this now.

437
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,349
"AN OPPORTUNITY
THEY DIDN'T EXPECT"

438
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,551
-What's wrong? What is it?
-Hold on.

439
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:40,619
Let's do it now.

440
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,288
-Let us have a short meeting.
-Okay.

441
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:46,058
Do it on me. Let me feel it.

442
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,126
Are you sure?

443
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:48,193
Yes, just do it.

444
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:50,963
-This is not right.
-Why don't you try it?

445
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:53,332
Is Jaehun strong?

446
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:55,601
THE STAFF BECKONS TO SOMEONE

447
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,536

448
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:59,304
-Are your flicks strong?
-Yes.

449
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:00,706
Can I do it this way?

450
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:04,076
If I do that, it's going to hurt a lot.

451
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:08,046
"THE FITNESS BOY IS HERE"

452
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,517
Well…

453
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:13,018
I feel bad.

454
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,454
"HE'S STILL READY TO DO IT"

455
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:18,891
Wouldn't it be better to do it on the arm?

456
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,028
THWACK

457
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,063

458
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,999
This is it. We're good now.

00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,906
"WAKING UP
AT THE THWACKING SOUND"

460
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:35,073
-Hold on.
-Come on.

461
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,743
"THIS ISN'T RIGHT"

462
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,278
He's on our side.

463
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,813
Are you trying to kill us all?

464
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,549
Hellboy should do it as planned.

465
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:45,284
The fitness trainer is on our side.

466
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,319
Come on, that's ridiculous.

467
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:49,221
Did you just hear the sound?

468
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:52,524
I'm not kidding.
It felt like a wooden stick.

469
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:54,426
No way.

470
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:57,095
-This isn't fair.
-He wasn't the original player.

471
00:19:57,162 --> 00:20:00,032
-You can't do this.
-He's our second Hellboy now.

472
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,800
"HE'S THE 2ND HELLBOY NOW"

473
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,902
No way. We're all going to die.

474
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:07,206
Now that I've taken the hit,
if you endure this,

475
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:08,607
I'll gladly deduct all 250 push-ups.

476
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,075
I'll gladly deduct all 250 push-ups.

477
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:11,343
-Seriously?
-Seriously.

478
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:15,247
"WE CAN GO HOME
IF WE ENDURE THIS?"

479
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:17,115
Then I'll try and endure it.

480
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:18,650
I'll endure it
with a poker-face like this.

481
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,485
"Sir, please give me a massage."

482
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:21,553
Bam.

483
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,388
Seriously?

484
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:24,756
Do you want to try it?

485
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:26,825
-Yes.
-Then we'll be generous.

486
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:30,229
-If all four of you can endure it,
-Yes?

487
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:32,164
I'll deduct all 250 push-ups.

488
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,599
-All four of us?
-This is insane.

489
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:36,001
So it'll be 50 deductions
for every success, right?

490
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,469
-Of course.
-Okay.

491
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,338
-He's that strong.
-Okay.

492
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,540
This is the last one,
so let's try and endure it.

493
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:43,508
We must endure it with our lives.

494
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:44,610
I'll go first.

495
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:46,311
-It might be better to suffer first.
-Okay, DinDin.

"THE LAST REDUCTION CAME:
ENDURE FINGER FLICK"

497

Seriously,

498
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:51,984
doesn't it feel like a break
in a men's high school?

499
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:55,520
It's felt like a men's high school
all day long.

500
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,155
It feels like CBR training.

501
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:58,790
If I endure it, 50 reductions, right?

502
00:20:58,857 --> 00:20:59,858
Let's go!

503
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:00,959
I'm so nervous.

We're filming,
and we'll check if you've moved.

506
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:07,099
Now, let's begin.

507
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:09,201
I can't watch this.

508
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,269
I'll do it now.

Three, two,

00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,647
one, pass.

-Hey.

515
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:29,488
-My God, it hurts.
-Hey.

00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:33,058
"OH LORD…"

517
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:39,965
What's it like?

518
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:42,968
It didn't feel like a finger.

519
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:44,202
It's not.

520
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:48,840
It felt like he hit my head
with a wooden sword.

that the pain doesn't come right away.

524
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,182
He hits you,

and then you go, "What?"

526
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:01,286
It comes a bit later?

527
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:03,488
-So it's endurable for three seconds?
-Yes.

528
00:22:03,555 --> 00:22:04,856

533
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:12,464
-Jonathan, keep a poker face, okay?
-Okay.

534
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:14,199
Hold on. Let me rehearse it.

535
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:15,267
Okay.

536
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,504
I'll do it now.

537
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,675
"HE BRIEFLY SAW THE FUTURE"

538
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:25,310
How am I supposed to endure it?

539
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:26,978
Don't close your eyes.

540
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:28,680
It's better to keep your eyes open.

541
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:31,983
That way, you can see it
when he's hitting.

542
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:34,319
Here we go.

543
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:38,957
Three, two…

544
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:40,759
"FLARING"

545
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:41,827
Fail!

546
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:46,365
Why? What's wrong?

547
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:48,533
Why? He endured it well.

548
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,935
He did well.

549
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:52,571
JONATHAN FAILS TO ENDURE
THE FINGER FLICK

550
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:02,781
HE FAILED BECAUSE
OF HIS FLARING NOSTRILS

551
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:05,584
You see what I meant?

552
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:07,319
Did you…

553
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:11,556
Did you also hear the ringing sound?

554
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:13,458
-I hear it on this side.
-Only briefly.

555
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:15,627
-It's ringing.
-Only briefly.

556
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:17,262
God, it's so strong.

557
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:19,564
Who should go, you or me?

558
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:21,466
-I'll go first, as planned.
-Are you sure?

559
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:22,834
Whenever you're ready.

560
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,536
I'll try and endure it too.

561
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,271
-Here we go.
-Okay.

562
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:27,973
I can't watch this.

563
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:30,909
Three, two,

564
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,811
one, pass.

565
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:34,413
-Nice, O3ohn.
-Are you all right?

566
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:35,480
Hey, O3ohn.

567
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:37,516
Are you all right?

568
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:38,583
"THE PAIN FOLLOWS
AFTER 3 SECONDS"

569
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,819
-That was a nice expression on your face.
-Are you all right?

570
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:42,154
Are you all right?

571
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,522
"O3OHN SUCCEEDS,
50 PUSH-UPS DEDUCTED"

572
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:44,956
The look on your face was great.

573
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:46,758
I really hear ringing in my head.

574
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:47,826
-Right?
-Yes.

575
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:49,661
-It rings.
-Yes, it's ringing.

576
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:51,129
We all say the same thing.

577
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:52,364
After you take it…

578
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,834
"LAST UP, CHOI DANIEL"

579
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:57,068
Have a go at it.

580
00:23:58,336 --> 00:23:59,371
Last hit. Here we go.

581
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,973
If you endure this,
we'll have only 100 left. You got this.

582
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,375
Okay, I got it.

583
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:07,746
THEY'VE HAD 100 PUSH-UPS
DEDUCTED SO FAR

584
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:10,916
IF HE ENDURES
FOR 3 SHORT SECONDS,

585
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:14,619
THEY'LL ONLY
HAVE 100 PUSH-UPS LEFT

586
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:21,359
Fail!

587
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:23,395
-Fail!
-No!

588
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,397
-No!
-Fail!

589
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:31,303
"JUMPING UPON GETTING HIT"

590
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:33,505
It felt like my head was cut in half.

591
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:34,940
-I'm sorry.
-Is my head intact?

592
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:36,007
Yes.

593
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:37,309
-It is?
-It is.

594
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:38,376
Hold on.

595
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:39,444
"A TOTAL
OF 100 PUSH-UPS DEDUCTED"

596
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:41,646
Now, the last game has ended.

597
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:43,882
If you do 150 more push-ups, it's over.

598
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:45,183
Let's do this.

599
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:47,819
All right.

600
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:48,887
Let's go!

601
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:50,555
-Let's go, Daniel.
-Daniel!

602
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:52,290
If we don't do it, it never ends.

603
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:55,961
Let's go, Daniel!

604
00:24:56,027 --> 00:24:57,028
He's back.

605
00:24:57,095 --> 00:24:58,263
-Three.
-He's back.

606
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,498
-Four.
-Let's go!

607
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:00,966
-Five.
-Five. Six.

608
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:02,434
Let's go for the MVP!

609
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,935
-That's insane.
-I'll do twelve for now.

"THE STAFF ARE ALSO ROOTING
FOR THEM"

611
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:08,373
-You can do it, O3ohn. Let's go, O3ohn.
-One.

612
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,641
-Good, O3ohn.
-Two.

613
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,109
Three.

614
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,644
-O3ohn, let's go for the MVP!
-Let's go!

615
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:14,579
Nine.

616
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:15,680
-Ten.
-Good.

617
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:16,982
Just 100 left!

618
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:19,518
Just use your shoulders!

-That's right.

621
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:28,927
Good.

622
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:30,362
-Good!
-Two.

623
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:32,564
You can definitely do this.

624
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:33,732
Nine.

625
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:34,866
Ten.

626
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:36,034
Only 70 left now.

627
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:37,569
Only 55 left.

628
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:38,803
You're almost there.

629
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,171
All right.

630
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:41,273
I'll do what I can.

631
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:43,308
We've only got 34 left.

632
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,876
We're nearly there.

633
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:46,044
-One.
-We're so close.

Two.

00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:50,015
-Four.
-Four.

636
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:52,183
-Five.
-What's going on?

637
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,185
-What's with this sudden energy?
-Six.

638
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:55,353
Seven.

639
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,355
I'll stop at seven for now.

640
00:25:57,422 --> 00:26:00,358
-Only 27 left!
-Okay, 27. Let's do this.

641
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:02,260
-O3ohn, you finish it!
-Last spurt.

642
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,296
One.

643
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:05,397
Two.

644
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,065
Six.

645
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:10,635
I really can't do any more.

646
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:13,505
Jonathan.

647
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:16,141
You finish it.

648
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:17,242
Okay.

649
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:18,310
My shoulders hurt.

650
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:19,711
Okay, 20 to go!

651
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:20,845
-Let's go.
-Finish it.

652
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,415
Finish it in one go. You can do it.

653
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:24,649
-Okay.
-Let's go.

654
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:25,717
Come on, everyone!

-Ten more!
-You can take a break.

668
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:51,076
-The world is watching.
-Twenty!

669
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:53,044
The world is watching you, Jonathan!

670
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,512
Ten more!

671
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:56,014
-You can pause.
-Nine!

672
00:26:57,248 --> 00:26:58,550
-Almost there.
-Eight to go!

673
00:26:58,617 --> 00:26:59,818
-Jonathan.
-Eight!

Four to go!

678
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,294
Four left.

679
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:11,129
-Four to go.
-You're incredible.

680
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:13,865
-You can let someone else do it.
-I can do it.

681
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:16,801
-It's four left, so let's do one each.
-Let's do one each!

682
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:18,236
-Okay.
-One each!

683
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,437
You do it last.

684
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:22,273
-You, me, and him.
-Okay.

685
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:23,908
Let's do it like a pro.

686
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:28,446
-Okay!
-Good.

-Good.
-Okay.

-Oh, God.
-I'm sorry.

691
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:38,757
-God, I can't go down.
-Okay.

692
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,358
-Last one!
-I can't do it anymore.

693
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:43,094
Good.

694
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,162
Jonathan!

695
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:45,230
Finish it.

696
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:46,665
-Finish it!
-Good game!

697
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:48,633

-Good game!

698
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,701
Okay!

00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:25,603
Now, we need to pick the MVP.

712
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,972
First, who did the least and how many?

713
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,808
<i>Last place is DinDin.</i>

714
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,009
A TOTAL OF 330 PUSH-UPS

715
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:32,877
<i>Third place is Jonathan.</i>

716
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:33,945
"A TOTAL OF 428"

717
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:37,215
What's interesting is
that O3ohn and Daniel

718
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,384
did exactly the same number of push-ups.

719
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:40,518
-Really?
-Really?

720
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:42,821
You both did 421 push-ups.

721
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:45,323
Wow, O3ohn.

722
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,125
Good work, man.

723
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:49,294
-It's moving.
-It really is.

724
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,628
This feels so nice.

725
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:53,298
By the difference of one deduction game,

726
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:54,432
the MVP is…

727
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,268
O3ohn with 521.

728
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:59,871
O3OHN: 521!

729
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:02,407
1ST PLACE: O3OHN
421 PUSH-UPS

730
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:04,609
A TOTAL OF 521

731
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:06,578
2ND PLACE: CHOI DANIEL
421 PUSH-UPS

732
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:08,313
A TOTAL OF 471

733
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,215
HE'S GIVEN AN ANCHOVY KEY CHAIN

734
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:11,583
Thank you so much.

735
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,184
Thank you.

736
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:17,322
I'm honored to be
the strongest one among us anchovies.

737
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:19,858
I'll work out more
and come back next time in better shape.

738
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:22,026
-Thank you.
-Look how radiant he is.

739
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:24,395
Nice light!

740
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:26,197
Good work!

741
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,266
-Good work, everyone!
-Good work, everyone!

742
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:31,302
THE 1ST
ANCHOVY PHYSICAL CAMP ENDS
