00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:03,069
THIS PROGRAM IS ABOUT
PHYSICALLY WEAK CELEBRITIES

2
00:00:03,136 --> 00:00:04,938
EXERCISING REPEATEDLY AND ENDLESSLY

3
00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:07,874
IF YOU'RE WONDERING
WHY THEY'RE SO EXHAUSTED,

4
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:09,609
PLEASE TRY IT AT HOME

5
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:16,182
<i>In movies,</i>

6
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:20,587
<i>right before they enter the afterlife…</i>

7
00:00:22,889 --> 00:00:23,890
<i>You know how it all fades?</i>

8
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:26,626
<i>All right, last one.</i>

9
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:30,230
-Darn it.
-You can do this.

10
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:39,639
Hey, get up! Get up!

11
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,044
<i>They're not just anchovies.</i>
<i>They're patients.</i>

12
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,513
<i>Come on, how are we</i>
<i>supposed to do this with patients?</i>

ANCHOVY PHYSICAL CAMP

15
00:00:55,855 --> 00:01:00,927
THE FIRST DAY OF ANCHOVY PHYSICAL CAMP

16
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:08,501
FIRST TRAINEE OF ANCHOVY PHYSICAL CAMP

17
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:13,606
FIRST ANCHOVY, CHOI DANIEL

18
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:14,707
What is this?

19
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:18,578
I don't think I'm an anchovy.

20
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:21,815
No one's ever called me
weak like an anchovy.

21
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:24,350
You see the thing is…

22
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:26,519
you may think
that it doesn't quite suit me,

23
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,688
but I'm on the intellectual side.

24
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:30,356
I'm an intellectual.

25
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,492
Wisdom. Yes, wise.

26
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:33,693
"Wise" would be better.

27
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,662
To take <i>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</i>
as an example,

28
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:37,397
I'm like Zhuge Liang.

29
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:39,032
-You know what I mean?
-<i>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</i>?

30
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,567
I'm wise like Zhuge Liang.

31
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:43,369
When I play a game,

32
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:45,972
I see right through
the nature of the game.

33
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:49,742
I grasp the key nature of the game
and what I need to do to win.

34
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,112
But that's not what this show is about.

35
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,515
I think you're mistaking this
for a mystery-solving show.

36
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:58,852
Maybe I am. Why did you cast me then?

37
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:01,387
Honestly, I don't really care
what others think of me.

38
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,456
I think of myself
as an intellectual person,

39
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:04,791
-a wise one.
-Okay.

40
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:06,960
Wisdom! Wise, wise!

41
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:08,027
I'm an intellectual!

42
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:09,829
I'm a very intellectual man.

43
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:14,701
SECOND TRAINEE OF ANCHOVY PHYSICAL CAMP

44
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:18,972
I feel so happy when I run.

45
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:21,774
Seriously, I love exercising.

46
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:23,243
I mean,

47
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,679
I can't ever be considered an anchovy.

48
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:32,252
I can never accept that I'm an anchovy.

49
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:34,654
Most people probably think
I'm weak like an anchovy,

50
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:37,590
but all of my friends will say
that I exercise hard.

51
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,058
I'm sure of it.

52
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,427
I'm serious. You know nothing about me.

53
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,429
My nickname is the Ichon-dong Hammer.

54
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,900
Comparing me to Jonathan, Daniel,
and O3ohn about exercise

55
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:48,168
is absolutely nonsensical.

56
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:49,402
See, this is why

57
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:51,905
Tyson said everyone has a plan
until they get punched in the mouth.

58
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,774
It goes like this and like that.
This is how you do it.

59
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,109
You just got knocked out.

60
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,177
SECOND ANCHOVY, DINDIN

61
00:02:57,644 --> 00:03:00,413
THE THIRD TRAINEE OF ANCHOVY PHYSICAL CAMP

62
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:02,448
Hello.

63
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:09,756
Okay.

64
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:11,991
"Q. DO YOU KNOW THE TITLE OF THE SHOW?"

65
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:15,395
Well, there was one word in the title
that bothered me.

66
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,664
The word "anchovy" got on my nerves.

67
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,098
"ALL OF THE TRAINEES DENY IT"

68
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:20,533
Be careful, be careful, be careful.

69
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,902
How would you rename it if you could?

70
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,337
It'd be "Jonathan and the anchovies."

71
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,873
Something like that would make sense.

72
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:29,876
Seriously, I mean it.

73
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:31,044
THE STAFF / HAHAHA

74
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,814
THE THIRD ANCHOVY, JONATHAN

75
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:35,915
Why are they laughing?

76
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:39,919
What do you think today's mission will be?

77
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:42,255
I have no idea, but I was…

78
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:46,626
asked to take out insurance.

79
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:50,530
It occurred to me that the producer

80
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:53,266
may have some dangerous stuff planned out.

81
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,269
I was a bit scared, but that's no problem.

82
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:58,271
Whatever it is, I'll get it done.

83
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:00,506
AND…

84
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:03,710
THE LAST ANCHOVY ARRIVES

85
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:05,345
Someone arrived.

86
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,413
I smell an anchovy from the car.

87
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,049
He's looking in the mirror
before getting out.

88
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:15,755
-It's O3ohn.
-O3ohn, you have a mirror in your car?

89
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:18,558
-Hey, you look in the mirror?
-Why did you look in the mirror?

90
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,227
-I can see you couldn't sleep a wink.
-You look in the mirror?

91
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:22,795
You didn't get any sleep, did you?

92
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:24,931
I haven't had the chance
to say a word yet.

93
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,032
Hello.

94
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,669
We've wanted to cast you for a long time.

95
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:30,737
"THE LAST ANCHOVY, O3OHN"

96
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:31,804
Let's talk about

97
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:36,276
-when you turned down our first offer.
-Thank you.

98
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:40,613
To be honest, I hesitated because
it's called "Anchovy Physical Camp."

99
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,814
Because I'm not an anchovy.

100
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:43,783
Not anymore, anyway.

101
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,952
So have you been boxing
for two to three years?

102
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,587
-About two years and a half.
-I see.

103
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,455
We have high hopes for you.

104
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:51,257
WELCOME TO THE ANCHOVY PHYSICAL CAMP

105
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:54,527
I have no idea what we'll be doing.

106
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:55,862
What could it be?

107
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:57,864
DinDin, do you know
the purpose of this show?

108
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,365
Any assumptions?

109
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:01,501
Well, it'll probably be us completing

110
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,303
some mission as a team, don't you think?

111
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:04,804
Is today's mission related to basketball?

112
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,806
-I have no idea. We know nothing.
-They didn't tell you?

113
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,341
Have they told you anything?

114
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,343
-No, nothing.
-Me neither.

115
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,446
-Yo, yo, yo.
-I think we can count on Jonathan today.

116
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:16,549
-No, don't.
-Jonathan, you look like an athlete today.

117
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,918
Producer, looking at Jonathan now,

118
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,753
he's far from being an anchovy.

119
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,855
Exactly, that's what I mean.

120
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:24,891
Maybe his mentality's weak
like an anchovy.

121
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:27,293
-Oh, his mentality is?
-Yes, like an anchovy.

122
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,594
You must be in peak condition today.

123
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:35,101
-What could we be doing?
-I should save my energy for later.

124
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,537
Tell me about it.
What on earth could it be?

125
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:39,672
-Hey, look.
-What?

126
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:41,074
It looks like a massage bed.

127
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:45,912
That's a massage table.
Isn't it for manual therapy?

128
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:49,882
Isn't that for treatment or therapy?

129
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,285
-It's not for exercise.
-You're going to…

130
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:54,687
-That's…
-Here's what I think.

131
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:57,123
-There's a timer over there.
-Yes, the timer's the key.

132
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,758
That means this is a speed game.

133
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,994
There are three or four timers over there.

134
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:04,797
How about we pull the line a bit forward
to about here?

135
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,165
"THE ANCHOVIES ARE IN FEAR"

136
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:08,067
Yes, let's come a bit forward.

137
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:09,569
I'm feeling uneasy.

138
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:12,905
Anchovy Physical Camp trainees, welcome.

139
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:14,340
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

140
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,211
-In any case, this is the beginning.
-Yes, whatever we're facing.

141
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:19,679
Welcome. Welcome, everyone.

142
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:21,614
You all represent anchovies.

143
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:24,884
Through this camp,
you'll be transformed from anchovies

144
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:27,487
into physically outstanding men.

145
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:30,323
Today's training is called…

146
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,026
Secluded Training.

147
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:35,194
-"Secluded…"
-What?

148
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:36,596
-Secluded Training.
-"Secluded"?

149
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:38,431
Beginning now,

150
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:41,868
for the next 12 hours,
you cannot leave this place

151
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:43,669
until you complete the mission.

152
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:47,774
What is this?
Why are you pressuring us with the door?

153
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,942
It feels like
everyone's going crazy in here.

154
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,211
You're still giving us food, right?

155
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:53,379
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

156
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:55,148
Excuse me, there's no time!

157
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:58,418
To anchovy that presents
the best performance

158
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:00,286
will be awarded an anchovy keychain.

159
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:02,688
"WHOEVER COLLECTS 3 KEYCHAINS
WILL BE GIVEN A 2-MILLION-WON GIFT PRIZE"

160
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,757
And that bell over there is the GG Bell.

161
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:07,160
The moment you ring the bell,
the game ends.

162
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:09,195
-What?
-No, we don't need it.

163
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,263
We'll never ring it.

164
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:12,298
"A FEW HOURS LATER"

165
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,300
-No, no, no!
-No, don't do it!

166
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,803
-Don't do it.
-We just might succeed.

167
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:19,338
HOW WILL IT END FOR THEM?

168
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:21,507
Here's your mission for the day.
Within 12 hours…

169
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:24,444
This is important.
This is the most important part.

170
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,183
Push-ups are a man's basic exercise.

171
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,688
-Your mission is to do 2,000 push-ups.
-What?

172
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:37,123
-That's…
-What's that?

173
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,928
How can we possibly do 2,000 push-ups?

174
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:43,863
-The muscles will explode.
-Exactly.

175
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,765
-I doubt we can do 1,000.
-Is this a joke?

176
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,167
-We knew you'd all say that.
-All right.

177
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:51,838
Once you finish 200,
the reduction game will unlock.

178
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:53,172
Two hundred?

179
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,608
And you can use it
to reduce your push-up count.

180
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:56,676
-But…
-Okay.

181
00:07:56,742 --> 00:08:00,446
If it's 200 push-ups,
we could just each do 50 right now.

182
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,081
-We could finish before it gets dark.
-In an hour and a half.

183
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:05,384
We invited an expert today
to make it accurate.

184
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:06,519
-What?
-Who?

185
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,221
Who?

186
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:09,322
Gosh.

187
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:11,457
-Hello.
-Hello.

188
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,993
He looks like a fitness trainer.

189
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,228
-Hello.
-Hello.

190
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:16,295
Hello.

191
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:17,530
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

192
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:21,167
I'm Park Solbin,
a physical therapist and fitness trainer.

193
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,235
Nice to meet you.

194
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:24,370
-That's why you brought this.
-Yes.

195
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:28,040
If the situation requires it,
I'll help you on that.

196
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:31,711
But it'd be like forced labor then,
wouldn't it?

197
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:35,414
If I complain about my arms in pain,
I'd get massaged and have to do it again.

198
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:37,250
-That's forced labor.
-Exactly.

199
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:39,218
I mean, in this day and age…

200
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:41,787
These are scary people.

201
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,222
I'll show you how to do a proper push-up.

202
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,391
Spread your hands shoulder-width apart,

203
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,393
and go down until your elbows reach
a 90-degree angle.

204
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,461
Then get back up.

205
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,463
Man, that's the standard way.

206
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,099
The 12 hours begins now.

207
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:54,433
-Okay!
-Let's go.

208
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,936
-Okay!
-All right, let's do this. We got this.

209
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,337
-Jonathan, let's go.
-Yeah.

210
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:00,206
-You can do this easily.
-That's right. Easy.

211
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:03,409
-Do it easy and slow. Don't rush.
-Right, easy and slow.

212
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:06,812
That's good.

213
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,549
One.

214
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:11,517
Two.

215
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:14,353
Three.

216
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:16,722
Four.

217
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:17,957
It's easy for him.

218
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:20,293
-Of course it's easy for him.
-Five.

219
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:22,495
-Six.
-Easy… Wait, he's shaking a bit.

220
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,563
Seven.

221
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,865
-He's shaking a bit.
-Eight.

222
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:27,400
You're doing well.

223
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,569
-Ten.
-Almost there.

224
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:32,338
Almost there.
You're almost there, Jonathan.

225
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:35,775
He's already lost his smile.

226
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:41,480
"HE HAS SUDDENLY GONE QUIET"

227
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:42,582
It's a piece of cake for him.

228
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:45,484
I told you, Jonathan lacks stamina.

229
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,119
-You're right.
-He only gets bursts of power.

230
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,888
Okay, you're done.

231
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:51,157
-Look at him sweating.
-Good job, good job.

232
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:53,993
-Why are you sweating so much?
-You're sweating buckets.

233
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,861
"SWEATING BUCKETS AFTER ONLY 25 PUSH-UPS"

234
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,764
-Are you okay?
-Good. You're all warmed up now.

235
00:09:58,831 --> 00:09:59,832
-Are you okay?
-He's warmed up now.

236
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:00,900
Yes, I'm fine. I'm good.

237
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:03,035
All right. Let me go right away.

238
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,403
I think he'd probably be

239
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,439
-the best at this among us.
-Yes, since he boxes.

240
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:07,740
All right.

241
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,308
I'll start. Is this the right form?

242
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,509
-Start as you are.
-Okay.

243
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:11,978
One.

244
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:13,546
-Two. Three.
-He looks stable.

245
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,614
He does it so effortlessly.

246
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,315
-Man, you're a natural at this!
-You're looking stable and steady.

247
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:17,750
He's light as a feather!

248
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:18,884
Let's get it!

249
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,419

252
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,027

-Yes, it was no sweat.

255
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,633
-Good job. Great job.
-We can definitely clear this.

256
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:36,535
I've got a feeling that we can do 2,000.

257
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:37,603
No doubt.

258
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,006
-You really are a pro.
-Let's get it done and go home.

259
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:41,140
I'll start now.

260
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:43,843
One. Two.

261
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:45,611
-Three. Four.
-You're good, you're good!

262
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,513
-Five. Six.
-He's very fast.

-He's fast. Good!
-Seven.

-He's very fast.
-He's fast.

265
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,886
Eight. Nine. Ten. Just three more.

266
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:55,688
Wait. I'm screwed.

267
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:03,696
I knew I was screwed while doing it.

268
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:05,831
-We're never gonna be able to clear this.
-No, never.

269
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,166
We're never making it to 2,000.

270
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:09,201
-Seriously?
-I think I could do 100.

271
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,437
But while going down,
I felt I couldn't do it.

272
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,072
-You felt it?
-These muscles told me.

273
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,209
-Did they scream at you?
-But we just started.

-It's nothing. You got this.
-All right, let's go.

-That's good.
-Wait.

If you succeed,
200 push-ups will be deducted.

This game to test your grip strength…

348
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:46,192
is cracking an egg with one hand.

349
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:47,660
An egg?

350
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:50,262
Jonathan can do this
since his hands are big.

00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:53,299
Cracking an egg's easy, isn't it?

352
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:54,600
It is, right?

353
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,468
Is it hard to crack a raw egg? Why?

354
00:13:57,536 --> 00:14:00,472
Each person will be given 30 seconds.

355
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:03,509
Even if one person succeeds,
we'll count it as a success.

Wait, is it really that hard?
I think it'll be easy.

You can't press on the egg
with your fingers,

00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,087
since it'll crack easily.

363

-Don't tell them.
-Yeah.

518
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,734
"THEY WERE ALL ACCOMPLICES"

519
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:04,136
I didn't press the egg with it.

520
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,404
-If I'd done that, then…
-What matters is

521
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,272
that they already made the call.

522
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:08,640
-You did?
-Yes, the referee did.

523
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,842
-The call was made.
-All right. I'll repent then.

524
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:12,010
-Yes, you do that.
-That's right.

525
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:14,546
-What you did was wrong.
-He'll repent.

526
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:17,349
-Producer, he'll repent.
-It's all good then.

527
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,750
-Apologize to him properly.
-Apologize to him.

528
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:19,851
I apologize.

529
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:21,386
-He didn't know.
-I'm greatly sorry.

530
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:24,323
-But there are a lot of cameras here.
-Yes, apologize.

531
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,824
-You should do better.
-Jonathan.

532
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:28,660
-Please apologize to everyone properly.
-I really…

533
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,028
-Tell everyone that you're sorry.
-I'm sorry, everyone.

534
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:31,463
-We're sorry.
-I regret it.

535
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,032
Since countries have
their own cultures and ways…

536
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:35,534
Why don't we speed it up?

537
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:37,903
-Let's do another round then.
-Okay, let's do that.

538
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,038
-Should we do 25 each?
-Okay, sounds good.

539
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:42,040
-And then we'll do the mission.
-Sounds good.

540
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:43,642
We'll be done in no time.

541
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,210
One. Two.

542
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:46,345
Three. Four.

543
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,513
Goddammit.

"HE CURSES AFTER ONLY 4 PUSH-UPS"

545
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:55,621
It's tougher on the body after a break.

546
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:56,688
One.

547
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:59,558
-Two.
-Damn, hold on a second.

548
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:01,293
Three.

549
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,928
-You're doing good.
-I'll do three at a time.

550
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:04,296
What are you doing?

551
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:06,698
I'm not kidding. It's so tough.

552
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,734
Guys, you can't be like this!

553
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,002
O3ohn sure is a pro.

554
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:11,436
YOUNG BLOOD TO THE RESCUE

555
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:13,739
-He's our ace.
-Three. Four.

556
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:16,041
-Five.
-All of his abilities

557
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,276
-are in his physicality.
-Let's go, O3ohn.

558
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:19,044
-All his stats went to his physicals.
-Nine.

559
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,346
"DESPITE THE ODD COMPLIMENT,
HE REMAINS CALM"

560
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:24,516
That's it, that's it. Three more.

JONATHAN THE TIRELESS STRONGMAN

562
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:32,257
THANKS TO THE YOUNG ANCHOVIES,
THEY FINISH 200

563
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:34,359
-All right.
-All right.

564
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:36,928
We did 400 in an hour.
We just need to do this five more times.

565
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:38,130
Just like last time,

566
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:40,565
you'll get 200 push-ups deducted
if you win.

567
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,401
-Right.
-In this game,

568
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:43,902
we'll test how strong your punches are.

569
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,170
-That's…
-Come on.

570
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:47,306
-This is for me. I'll go first.
-I'm the Ichon-dong Hammer.

571
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:49,474
-You go last.
-Oh, okay.

572
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,376
This is it. This is my chance.

573
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:55,280
The game is called
"Punch Out the Candles."

574
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:56,715
What?

575
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:58,517
"PUNCH OUT WHAT?"

576
00:21:58,583 --> 00:21:59,785
"Punch Out the Candles."

577
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:01,553
I've tried it and it's impossible.

578
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,621
In this game,

579
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:06,792
you must blow out ten candles
using only your punches.

580
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:08,293
-What?
-It's impossible.

581
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,796
-Like this?
-You'll try it one by one in a relay.

582
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:13,265
If there's even one flame left

583
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,101
or if your fist touches any flames,

00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:19,037
"THE SECOND REDUCTION GAME:
PUNCH OUT THE CANDLES (PRACTICE GAME)"

585
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,075
I can't do it.

586
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:25,110
It's impossible.

587
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:29,181
-Maybe he can.
-Why are you shadowboxing with flames?

588
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:31,283
-Watch me.
-Now he punches.

589
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:33,218
-I didn't actually punch.
-What was that?

590
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:34,286
Give it a go then.

591
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:37,289
What are you doing?

592
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,357
"BLOWS OUT OF HIS NOSE"

593
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:39,725
-What are you doing?
-Watch your nose.

594
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,360
-I can't do that?
-Of course not.

595
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:43,362
But blowing through my nose
is a habit of mine.

596
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:45,230
-I'll give it a try.
-Try it, Jonathan.

597
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:49,401
Did you get your wisdom tooth removed?

598
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,603
-What?
-What's this pose?

599
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,205
Did you get your wisdom tooth pulled out?

600
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:55,006
-What's with the pose?
-I have my ways.

601
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:57,109
Everyone has their own ways.

602
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:04,249
-Hey, we'll check the VAR.
-No, no.

603
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:06,518
-Let's have a cameraman on him
-Come on.

604
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:08,320
-To film only his face.
-I wasn't doing anything wrong.

605
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,088
All right, I'll do it seriously.

607
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,761
Okay.

-How?

614
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:34,813
-Teach us.
-Do it as if you're really punching it.

615
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,914
Really?

616
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:37,616
As if you don't care if you get burned.

617
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:39,684

-No way.
-I didn't even feel the flame.

626
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:00,772
If he did, he would've gotten burned.

-Where? Tell me.
-Hey, Jonathan.

632
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,122
Do you want me to tell you
which parts are burned?

633
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:19,324

00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,647
One.

690
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:26,051
"THEIR LAST HOPE, STRONGMAN JONATHAN"

691
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:28,520
-Let's go.
-Four left!

692
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:32,290
-Jonathan, let's go!
-It's okay if you fail.

693
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:33,358
Just be relaxed.

694
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:36,027
You can do this. Just crush them!

695
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,362
It all depends on me.

696
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:38,430
Here I go.

697
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:41,466
"HE BLOWS OUT 2"

698
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:44,336
-Yes, Jonathan!
-Hey, take your time.

699
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:47,339
-Nice. Let's go, you got this.
-Take your time.

700
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:48,406
You can do this.

701
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:49,507
It's easy for him.

702
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:51,676
-You got this.
-Jonathan, don't be nervous.

703
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:53,144
Blow them off at once.

704
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:55,780
"ONLY TWO MORE TO GO
UNTIL THE 200 PUSH-UP DEDUCTION"

705
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:57,048
Relax, relax.

706
00:26:57,582 --> 00:26:58,683
Just as you've done.

707
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,452
"PLEASE!"

708
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:32,617
Is there any additional chance we can get?

709
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:34,419
"NOPE"

710
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,887
I couldn't control my power.

711
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:39,524
-I just had too much adrenaline in me.
-You failed to get the 200 deduction.

712
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:41,626
-But you see,
-Please, one more chance.

713
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:43,061
-this is a fun game.
-Cameras out.

714
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:44,729
Just one more chance!

715
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,765
We were almost there.

716
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:48,800
We were so close.

717
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,837
We need to do 200 more
to get another chance.

718
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:55,340
Darn it, we were almost there.

719
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:03,982
Well, I think DinDin is

720
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:06,317
monkeying around too much.

721
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:08,486
He really is.

722
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:12,290
<i>I think he and the production staff</i>
<i>might be on the same side.</i>

723
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,025
<i>He just might be a mole.</i>

724
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:15,994
DinDin is a mole.

725
00:28:16,494 --> 00:28:19,164
I strongly suspect that he's their spy.

726
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,132
You look more like a spy than I do.

727
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:24,436
Right now, you look like
a North Korean soldier.

728
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:29,007
-How many have we done?
-How many in total?

729
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:30,542
You've done 400 push-ups.

730
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:33,478
THE ANCHOVIES ARE DISPIRITED
AFTER FAILING THE DEDUCTION GAME

731
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,546
It's tough, isn't it?

732
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:36,314
-Yes, it's gotten…
-It's too tough now.

733
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,849
I'm getting exhausted.

734
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:38,917
This is bad.

735
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:40,452
It's tougher than I thought.

736
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:42,721
Should we try another round now

737
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:45,356
Yes, let's do another round now.

738
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:46,624
Are you sure?

739
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,996
Oh, I think it's not that bad.

740
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:55,066
HIS FACE SAYS OTHERWISE

741
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:56,901
Now it's too much for him.

742
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:59,938
When he goes down,
it's already too much for him.

743
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:02,640
He's like a corpse now.

744
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:06,277
-Then it's just the three of us now.
-He was already gone.

745
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:07,746
So he came back from the dead.

746
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,281
AN ANCHOVY FROM THE AFTERLIFE

747
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:12,383
What do you mean, I was already gone?

748
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,352
-Okay, let's get it!
-Let's go.

749
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:15,653
Let's go. I'll go first.

750
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,088
-Okay.
-I'll go first. Let's go.

751
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:19,023
One.

752
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:21,493
Two. Three.

753
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,363
Goddammit.
Why did I agree to join this show?

754
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:27,932
Four.

755
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:30,135
REGRETTING MORE AND MORE

756
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:31,202
Here I go!

757
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:34,038
He sure is young.

758
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,040
THE YOUNG BLOOD PUSHES AHEAD

759
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:40,211
-Six.
-Four more. Show us what you got.

760
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,279
Seven.

761
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,214
He's shaking a lot.

762
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,382
-Last one!
-Let's go.

763
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,583
One last one.

764
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:47,418
-Okay! Nice!
-Okay, okay.

765
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:49,487
One. Two.

766
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:52,157
Four. Five.

767
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:53,658
Hold on.

768
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:56,060
He's exhausted too.

769
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,228
Two more.

770
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,297
Last one! Okay!

771
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,600
If Daniel does five,
we can have our mission.

772
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:04,369
"ONLY 5 MORE TO GO
UNTIL THE DEDUCTION GAME"

773
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:05,937
-Okay, okay.
-Are you sure?

774
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:07,906
-Can you do it for me?
-Yes.

775
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:08,973
"WHAT?"

776
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,708
I'm a knight in shining armor.
Let's get it!

777
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:12,110
-Let's go.
-Let's get it!

778
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:14,045
One. Two.

779
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:16,314
-Three. Four!
-Last one.

780
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:19,984
200 PUSH-UPS COMPLETED
THANKS TO THE KNIGHT

781
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:22,453
800 PUSH-UPS DONE IN JUST TWO HOURS

782
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,621
Okay!

783
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:25,757
We'll begin the next deduction game.

784
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,860
This time, 100 deductions are on the line.

785
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:31,296
-Just 100? Come on, why?
-Why? It was 200 before.

786
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:33,364
See? They're scared now.

787
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:36,034
-They're scared.
-Come on, let's go for 200.

788
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,671
But it's only been
a bit more than two hours.

789
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:42,941
Listen, guys.
I don't think we need to do it quickly.

790
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,809
-Right. We can…
-Let's take our time.

791
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:45,944
We can take it easy.

792
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,745
If you win,
you'll get 100 push-ups deducted.

793
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:49,647
This game will test
your physical strength.

794
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:54,552
-Egg again?
-It's called "One-on-four Arm Wrestling."

795
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:59,858
In this game, you'll go against
one of our staff one by one.

796
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:01,860
If any of you beats him, you win.

797
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:04,662
There must be someone strong
among the staff.

798
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:05,730
I'm sure of it.

799
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:07,765
You'll only be given one chance.

800
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,834
Are you guys all ready?

801
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:11,102
-Yes. We'll do it.
-Yes.

802
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:14,305
All right.
We'll present to you our player then.

803
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:15,373
Everyone else, step back.

804
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,708
THE STAFF'S PLAYER APPEARS

805
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:21,012
There's no one here.

806
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:22,947
What?

807
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:26,417
"THE STAFF'S PLAYER STANDS SHYLY"

808
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:27,485
What?

809
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:29,787
"SOMEWHAT UNPLEASANT"

810
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:31,956
-This is bad.
-He has long arms.

811
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:34,525
Can I touch your arm?

812
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:35,593
May I?

813
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:39,097
Can I ask about your arm wrestling record?

814
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:41,466
Do you know your stats?

815
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:44,002
My arms aren't that strong.

816
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:46,638
-He's a strong man.
-His bones are…

817
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:49,374
-He would've been loved by noble ladies.
-He's got strong bones.

818
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,843
Noble ladies would've loved him.

819
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,811
It must be in his genes.

820
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:55,380
But…

821
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:58,549
He might not be an actual staff member.

822
00:31:58,950 --> 00:31:59,951
"AN ABSURD WAY OF THINKING"

823
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:01,286
I really am a cameraman.

824
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:02,754
But the way he's holding the camera…

825
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,689
-Is that a fake camera?
-Maybe he was trained today.

826
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,991
They probably told him,
"Just hold the camera like this."

827
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:10,962
"THE THIRD REDUCTION GAME:
1-ON-4 ARM WRESTLING"

828
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:13,631
First, body weight is crucial here.

829
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:15,800
-Since you two are heavier, we two will…
-Right, us two.

830
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:16,935
We'll tire him out.

831
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:18,069
-Right.
-And then you two…

832
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:20,104
You go first, and then O3ohn.

833
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:22,040
And then Jonathan and me.

834
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:26,678
"THE CAMERAMAN GETS READY TOO"

835
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:27,912
Let's go.

836
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:30,982
"THE PLAYER ENTERS"

837
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:38,056
I think he got a tan in a rush
to look like a cameraman.

838
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,123
It's so red.

839
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:43,294
-It's like he got a partial tan.
-He's so red.

840
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:46,097
PLAYER 1: DINDIN

841
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:50,735
JUST HOLDING HANDS MAKES HIM FUSS

842
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:51,803
What was that?

843
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:53,771
Look, I think he's a professional.

844
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:56,507
-He's a professional.
-It hurts so much.

845
00:32:56,574 --> 00:32:57,976
-I'm just holding on lightly.
-Sir.

846
00:32:58,042 --> 00:32:59,644
"HOLDING TIGHT"

847
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:01,512
Come on. Hold on a second.

848
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:02,780
I can't hold his hand properly.

849
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:04,682
Ready, set, go!

850
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:05,883
Hold out!

851
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,018
You have to tire him out.

852
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:08,653
Out.

853
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,022
"DARN IT"

854
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:12,256
No, listen.

855
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:14,993
-He's laughing.
-No, listen. Daniel, just listen to me.

856
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:16,060
I can't hold his hand right.

857
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:17,762
-It's so thick.
-Yeah?

858
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,330
Now, next player, please.

859
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:20,898
-O3ohn.
-I'll do my best.

860
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:22,967
-Ready.
-Wait. Please go easy on me.

861
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:24,469
Wait. Please go easy on me.

862
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:25,536
Set, go!

863
