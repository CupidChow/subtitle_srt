1
00:00:01,644 --> 00:00:04,781
THE PLACE FOR THE SEVENTH ANCHOVY CAMP

2
00:00:05,348 --> 00:00:07,016
It's a valley.

3
00:00:07,083 --> 00:00:08,484
A VALLEY WITH CLEAR WATER IN YANGJU

4
00:00:09,285 --> 00:00:11,287
For God's sake… I can't believe you guys.

5
00:00:11,354 --> 00:00:12,789
You should've given us a heads-up.

6
00:00:13,456 --> 00:00:14,590
DIGGING AT HIS EAR

7
00:00:14,657 --> 00:00:16,192
I mean, seriously,

8
00:00:16,259 --> 00:00:18,127
what are we doing here today? There's…

9
00:00:18,628 --> 00:00:20,863
There's no proper space
for us to exercise.

10
00:00:21,531 --> 00:00:22,532
Maybe here?

11
00:00:22,598 --> 00:00:23,833
NO MATTER WHERE YOU LOOK

12
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,101
IT'S WATER EVERYWHERE

13
00:00:25,168 --> 00:00:27,170
-Is it swimming?
-Oh, no.

14
00:00:27,737 --> 00:00:29,138
If we were doing it here,

15
00:00:29,205 --> 00:00:32,608
you should've told us
to pack our swimwear. Please.

16
00:00:32,675 --> 00:00:34,977
-What do you think you'll do?
-How do I know?

17
00:00:35,311 --> 00:00:37,547
"GETTING MORE AND MORE FRUSTRATED"

18
00:00:37,613 --> 00:00:39,649
Once DinDin's here, you'll cross a river.

19
00:00:39,715 --> 00:00:40,883
-Cross a river?
-River?

20
00:00:41,851 --> 00:00:43,953
-We can't go around it?
-Yes.

21
00:00:44,854 --> 00:00:46,456
"THEY'RE PISSING ME OFF FROM THE START"

22
00:00:46,522 --> 00:00:47,523
It's not the River Styx, is it?

23
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:48,991
-This is insane.
-What?

24
00:00:49,058 --> 00:00:50,159
We're crossing a river?

25
00:00:50,893 --> 00:00:52,395
What do you want to eat the most here?

26
00:00:55,465 --> 00:00:57,467
WHAT IS IT THIS TIME?

27
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:00,136
STARING

28
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:04,707
CAUTIOUS

29
00:01:04,774 --> 00:01:06,175
Why do you ask that?

30
00:01:06,242 --> 00:01:07,977
I was really just curious.

31
00:01:08,945 --> 00:01:10,646
"SINCE WHEN DID YOU ASK
ABOUT SUCH THINGS?"

32
00:01:11,814 --> 00:01:13,182
Wait, are you a newcomer?

33
00:01:13,249 --> 00:01:14,884
"ANCHOVIES NOTICE THE NEW PRODUCER"

34
00:01:14,951 --> 00:01:16,486
-I've never seen him.
-Oh, a producer?

35
00:01:16,552 --> 00:01:18,654
We should do it our way.

36
00:01:19,155 --> 00:01:20,323
Sink him.

37
00:01:20,389 --> 00:01:22,125
Sink him.

38
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:23,860
Sink him. I mean…

39
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,261
"HAZING BEGINS OUT OF THE BLUE"

40
00:01:25,328 --> 00:01:26,829
We don't take it easy on newcomers.

41
00:01:26,896 --> 00:01:28,231
-Sink him now.
-Wait.

42
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:30,700
All right. Just dip his face for now.

43
00:01:30,766 --> 00:01:33,402
-First… I mean, he's new.
-Hands behind your back. Just your face.

44
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:34,537
Okay, just your face.

45
00:01:34,604 --> 00:01:35,671
Just your face.

46
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,041
"WELCOME TO ANCHOVY CAMP"

47
00:01:39,108 --> 00:01:40,109
What…

48
00:01:40,176 --> 00:01:41,844
-How was it?
-How was it?

49
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:44,080
You'll regret this later today.

50
00:01:44,847 --> 00:01:46,649
"A WARNING THAT'S NOT SCARY AT ALL"

51
00:01:46,716 --> 00:01:48,351
I mean, it's his first day.

52
00:01:48,417 --> 00:01:49,852
He's a newcomer.

53
00:01:49,919 --> 00:01:51,487
And he's picking a fight.

54
00:01:51,554 --> 00:01:53,689
He suddenly asked us
what we'd like to eat.

55
00:01:53,756 --> 00:01:55,424
You think we're pushovers?

56
00:01:55,491 --> 00:01:56,559
Who is he?

57
00:01:56,626 --> 00:01:58,094
-He's a newcomer.
-Is that so?

58
00:01:58,161 --> 00:02:00,129
So we broke his spirit a bit.

59
00:02:00,663 --> 00:02:04,100
All right. As for the keychains…
To sum up,

60
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:07,003
except for DinDin,
everyone has one at the moment.

61
00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:08,337
If DinDin wins today,

62
00:02:08,404 --> 00:02:09,972
-he'll be given a gift.
-A gift?

63
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,774
Then my goal today

64
00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:14,677
should be to prevent DinDin from winning
even if I can't win.

65
00:02:14,744 --> 00:02:15,878
We must stop him.

66
00:02:16,245 --> 00:02:17,947
"THESE GUYS ARE SO RELIABLE"

67
00:02:18,014 --> 00:02:20,950
Now, I will reveal the seventh mission.

68
00:02:21,417 --> 00:02:22,552
After the burpees,

69
00:02:23,252 --> 00:02:25,188
we're having
another devilish full-body exercise.

70
00:02:25,254 --> 00:02:26,756
Hold on, full-body exercise?

71
00:02:26,822 --> 00:02:29,192
Short workouts can be highly effective.

72
00:02:29,258 --> 00:02:30,760
It's the most time-efficient exercise.

73
00:02:31,227 --> 00:02:32,595
The rowing machine.

74
00:02:32,662 --> 00:02:33,829
I've never done it before.

75
00:02:35,865 --> 00:02:36,866
Lowing?

76
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,603
-What's a lowing machine?
-You know, crew.

77
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:43,272
-Like paddling. The rowing.
-Have you tried it?

78
00:02:43,339 --> 00:02:44,707
-Yes, I have.
-Really?

79
00:02:44,774 --> 00:02:46,375
God, it'll be tough.

80
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:48,211
You must complete 80 kilometers.

81
00:02:49,111 --> 00:02:51,180
-80 kilometers?
-Yes.

82
00:02:51,647 --> 00:02:52,915
I have no clue.

83
00:02:52,982 --> 00:02:55,618
What's the distance
between Ulleungdo and Dokdo?

84
00:02:55,685 --> 00:02:57,853
It's 200 <i>ri</i> southeast by boat.

85
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,322
That's about 80 km.

86
00:02:59,789 --> 00:03:01,257
If you complete this mission,

87
00:03:01,324 --> 00:03:03,392
it'll be like the four of you
rowing together

88
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:05,027
from Ulleungdo to Dokdo.

89
00:03:05,094 --> 00:03:06,529
Okay.

90
00:03:06,596 --> 00:03:09,065
You'll strap your feet into the pedals.

91
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:11,634
Push with your legs first.

92
00:03:11,701 --> 00:03:13,502
"STRAIGHTEN THE LEGS FIRST"

93
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:15,438
Then lean back and pull with your arms.

94
00:03:15,504 --> 00:03:16,539
Okay.

95
00:03:16,606 --> 00:03:18,007
And then in reverse order.

96
00:03:18,074 --> 00:03:20,042
Straighten your arms and bend your knees.

97
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,478
Tell you what. While explaining to us,

98
00:03:22,545 --> 00:03:24,146
-he went 70 m.
-Right.

99
00:03:24,213 --> 00:03:26,382
-It won't take long to finish it.
-Really?

100
00:03:26,449 --> 00:03:29,218
We'll complete 80 km in no time.
Seriously.

101
00:03:29,285 --> 00:03:31,621
We could even make plans for lunch.

102
00:03:32,288 --> 00:03:33,623
"HERE HE GOES AGAIN…"

103
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:35,524
-Here you go again.
-Seriously.

104
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:36,726
-Let's do it.
-Really?

105
00:03:36,792 --> 00:03:37,860
Shall we begin?

106
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:39,762
It's 12 hours from now.

107
00:03:40,363 --> 00:03:43,766
In this mission, how many kilometers
to get to the deduction game?

108
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,301
Every 10 km, you'll get a game.

109
00:03:45,768 --> 00:03:49,038
DINDIN, THE ONLY ONE WITH EXPERIENCE,
GOES FIRST

110
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:52,842
THE DISTANCE GOING UP FAST

111
00:03:52,908 --> 00:03:55,011
-He's good.
-Wow, doing great!

112
00:03:55,077 --> 00:03:56,279
You're pulling smoothly.

113
00:03:56,345 --> 00:03:58,581
You must pull with your lat.

114
00:03:58,648 --> 00:04:00,750
He sure has some experience.

115
00:04:00,816 --> 00:04:01,917
He wasn't lying.

116
00:04:01,984 --> 00:04:04,220
He is good. I guess it's because…

117
00:04:04,287 --> 00:04:06,188
he's the anchovy in the lead?

118
00:04:06,255 --> 00:04:07,623
Is he doing it properly?

119
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:10,092
-Yes, he's doing pretty well.
-His posture is good.

120
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,994
You passed 500 m.

121
00:04:12,061 --> 00:04:13,529
He's going smoothly.

122
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:17,133
EVEN SMILING WHILE PULLING

123
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,836
HIS BIG TALK BECOMES REALITY?

124
00:04:22,171 --> 00:04:23,706
-Okay.
-You passed 1 km.

125
00:04:24,173 --> 00:04:26,475
"THE ONE WITH EXPERIENCE
HAS REACHED 1 KM IN 5 MINUTES"

126
00:04:26,942 --> 00:04:29,111
You should find your rhythm.
That makes it less tiring.

127
00:04:29,178 --> 00:04:30,746
I've never done this, so I have no clue.

128
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:32,381
But tall people have an advantage.

129
00:04:32,448 --> 00:04:33,849
Because we can pull longer?

130
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:37,119
The taller you are,
the longer your strokes are.

131
00:04:38,421 --> 00:04:39,455
"THE TALLEST GUY TRIES"

132
00:04:39,522 --> 00:04:41,190
Your limbs are so long.

133
00:04:41,257 --> 00:04:42,625
So long.

134
00:04:42,692 --> 00:04:43,893
All right.

135
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,728
Let's go!

136
00:04:46,195 --> 00:04:48,230
He goes almost 10 m every stroke.

137
00:04:49,165 --> 00:04:52,001
He's doing so well.
He's rowed 800 m already.

138
00:04:52,068 --> 00:04:53,135
Already?

139
00:04:53,202 --> 00:04:55,171
Since his limbs are so long…

140
00:04:55,237 --> 00:04:58,307
It must bum DinDin out.
He has just one keychain to go.

141
00:04:58,374 --> 00:04:59,575
"SHORT ANCHOVY IN THE LEAD IS SAD"

142
00:04:59,642 --> 00:05:01,243
That's just his luck.

143
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,479
Will we have to go in the water later?

144
00:05:03,546 --> 00:05:04,580
You might.

145
00:05:04,647 --> 00:05:06,649
Can I make a couple pass out then?

146
00:05:07,249 --> 00:05:09,919
TWO CANDIDATES EXPECTED TO PASS OUT

147
00:05:10,252 --> 00:05:12,321
THE SECOND TALLEST GUY'S TURN

148
00:05:12,788 --> 00:05:14,056
He's good too.

149
00:05:14,123 --> 00:05:16,359
Yes, make your strokes long.

150
00:05:16,425 --> 00:05:18,728
Wow, he's going fast.

151
00:05:18,794 --> 00:05:20,696
Why is everyone so good?

152
00:05:20,763 --> 00:05:22,064
You're not tired at all?

153
00:05:22,131 --> 00:05:24,700
"HE DOESN'T SEEM TIRED AT ALL"

154
00:05:24,767 --> 00:05:27,536
-You just need to pull and lean back.
-Right, lean back.

155
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,238
You're doing great.

156
00:05:29,305 --> 00:05:31,173
GETTING OFF A GOOD START
MAXIMIZING HIS HEIGHT

157
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,641
VROOM

158
00:05:33,476 --> 00:05:35,144
O3ohn's doing good too.

159
00:05:36,178 --> 00:05:37,613
"ANCHOVIES ARE IN TOP FORM!"

160
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,482
And there's even a breeze.

161
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:41,717
-It's nice. It's so nice today.
-It's so good.

162
00:05:41,784 --> 00:05:43,552
And the shade is perfect too.

163
00:05:44,787 --> 00:05:46,655
Gosh, the breeze feels so nice.

164
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:50,359
God, I wish we could just have <i>makgeolli</i>
and lie down here.

165
00:05:50,426 --> 00:05:52,128
"ENJOYING IT AS IF THEY'RE ON A PICNIC"

166
00:05:53,362 --> 00:05:54,797
<i>It's therapeutic today.</i>

167
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,501
REACHING 10 KM IN THE HAPPIEST MOOD

168
00:05:58,567 --> 00:05:59,902
-Okay!
-Okay.

169
00:06:00,369 --> 00:06:02,271
-Here's the first game.
-Okay.

170
00:06:03,205 --> 00:06:06,342
-A maximum of 8 km is on the line.
-Wow.

171
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:08,778
It's "Chicken Soup Fight."

172
00:06:08,844 --> 00:06:09,845
Chicken Fight?

173
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:11,447
<i>It's Chicken Fight in the water.</i>

174
00:06:11,514 --> 00:06:13,883
<i>And you'll go against staff members</i>
<i>one-on-one.</i>

175
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:16,018
<i>Only those who win will get the deduction.</i>

176
00:06:16,085 --> 00:06:18,354
<i>Those who lose will get</i>
<i>an additional 2 km.</i>

177
00:06:18,421 --> 00:06:20,523
You can choose your opponent.

178
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:22,858
But you can only pick
someone of the same gender.

179
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:25,327
I choose Producer Moon Sangdon.

180
00:06:25,394 --> 00:06:27,229
"HE CHOOSES THE MAIN PRODUCER
WITHOUT HESITATION"

181
00:06:27,296 --> 00:06:29,365
-I can't believe you.
-A person of the same gender.

182
00:06:29,432 --> 00:06:31,367
The same gender. What? He's a man.

183
00:06:31,434 --> 00:06:32,802
Hey, he's mine. He's mine.

184
00:06:32,868 --> 00:06:34,603
-What? He's a man!
-He's mine!

185
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:37,273
FIGHTING OVER AN INJURED PERSON

186
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:39,341
THREE GUYS RUSHING OVER

187
00:06:39,408 --> 00:06:40,409
Don't touch him!

188
00:06:40,476 --> 00:06:43,179
He can play. He can hold his injured leg.

189
00:06:43,245 --> 00:06:44,713
Yes, you can hold that leg!

190
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,782
No, please pick someone else.

191
00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:48,250
Anyone except me.

192
00:06:48,717 --> 00:06:50,553
"THE SECOND WEAKEST ONE IS…"

193
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:51,854
All right.

194
00:06:51,921 --> 00:06:53,823
I choose One Seungjae.

195
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:55,524
"DINDIN AND IRON TONGUE"

196
00:06:55,591 --> 00:06:57,326
Oh, Seungjae. All right.

197
00:06:57,393 --> 00:06:58,394
Hey, Jonathan.

198
00:06:58,994 --> 00:07:01,730
You see the slim guy in the back?

199
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:02,798
Okay.

200
00:07:02,865 --> 00:07:05,367
-He's avoiding eye contact.
-I have decided.

201
00:07:10,372 --> 00:07:11,373
You!

202
00:07:12,475 --> 00:07:15,077
-Hey, he looks 20 kg lighter than you.
-Let's go!

203
00:07:15,544 --> 00:07:17,146
Who should O3ohn pick?

204
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,783
"O3OHN'S BEEN SEARCHING FOR SOME TIME"

205
00:07:21,717 --> 00:07:24,053
-Now, please pick your opponent.
-The new producer.

206
00:07:25,488 --> 00:07:26,922
The new producer.

207
00:07:27,356 --> 00:07:31,126
AS FOR THE NEW PRODUCER…

208
00:07:31,627 --> 00:07:35,064
AFTER THE HARSH HAZING

209
00:07:35,531 --> 00:07:36,765
You'll regret this later today.

210
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:38,801
HE GAVE A PATHETIC WARNING

211
00:07:38,868 --> 00:07:40,703
-What's with everyone?
-Good for you.

212
00:07:40,769 --> 00:07:43,038
I had no idea. I envy you.

213
00:07:43,606 --> 00:07:46,008
-It's a free bonus.
-No, no.

214
00:07:46,075 --> 00:07:49,044
"O3OHN AND PRODUCER SEO HYEONGWON"

215
00:07:49,512 --> 00:07:50,846
I'll have to see.

216
00:07:50,913 --> 00:07:52,214
His legs are thick.

217
00:07:52,281 --> 00:07:54,149
Lastly, Daniel.

218
00:07:54,216 --> 00:07:56,185
If I end up going in the water,

219
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,187
I'll bring Coach Solbin.

220
00:07:58,988 --> 00:07:59,989
I choose Coach Solbin.

221
00:08:00,055 --> 00:08:01,690
-For real?
-For real.

222
00:08:01,757 --> 00:08:05,394
"EVERYONE IS SURPRISED
BY THE UNEXPECTED CHOICE"

223
00:08:05,461 --> 00:08:08,197
I think it's because he's realized

224
00:08:08,264 --> 00:08:09,565
his muscles are for fashion.

225
00:08:09,632 --> 00:08:11,200
-Yes. You know, right?
-Yes.

226
00:08:11,267 --> 00:08:12,468
They're just for show.

227
00:08:12,535 --> 00:08:13,903
I'll show you today.

228
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,938
All he does is count

229
00:08:16,005 --> 00:08:18,140
and say, "Your posture is weird."

230
00:08:18,607 --> 00:08:20,042
Okay, let's go to play the game.

231
00:08:20,109 --> 00:08:21,944
Okay, let's do this.

232
00:08:22,011 --> 00:08:23,412
"DANIEL AND COACH SOLBIN"

233
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:25,347
-Got extra clothes?
-Of course.

234
00:08:25,414 --> 00:08:27,316
-You'll be soaked.
-That's okay.

235
00:08:27,383 --> 00:08:30,152
We should push them right away
and bury them.

236
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,820
Hey, Hyeongwon.

237
00:08:32,321 --> 00:08:33,455
Show them what you got.

238
00:08:33,522 --> 00:08:34,957
I can beat O3ohn easily.

239
00:08:35,024 --> 00:08:36,225
You can beat O3ohn?

240
00:08:36,692 --> 00:08:37,693
All right.

241
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:41,196
INTENSE WARM-UP

242
00:08:41,664 --> 00:08:43,399
EVEN HAVING A STRATEGY MEETING

243
00:08:43,465 --> 00:08:46,802
No, if you're right-footed,
you should attack with your right leg.

244
00:08:47,336 --> 00:08:48,637
They're having a meeting.

245
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:52,141
They're determined to win.

246
00:08:52,207 --> 00:08:54,944
He doesn't know how strong I am yet.

247
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:57,446
If I hold out and make some fake moves,

248
00:08:57,513 --> 00:08:58,847
I think he'll fall on his own.

249
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:01,050
I'll make him fall head-first.

250
00:09:02,351 --> 00:09:04,053
I'll hit his leg like this

251
00:09:04,119 --> 00:09:05,754
-so that…
-He thinks he can beat you.

252
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:08,424
INTENSE WAR OF NERVES FROM THE START

253
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:11,694
ORDER OF PLAY
O3OHN, DINDIN, JONATHAN, DANIEL

254
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,597
The first match, a co-main event.

255
00:09:14,663 --> 00:09:17,266
O3ohn and Producer Seo Hyeongwon,
please get ready.

256
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,334
Producer Seo.

257
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,602
Let's go, O3ohn.

258
00:09:20,035 --> 00:09:22,304
He'll get a harsh hazing today.

259
00:09:22,371 --> 00:09:25,107
O3OHN, A BOXER WITH 2 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE

260
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:28,210
A NEW PRODUCER WHO'S BEEN HAZED

261
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:30,879
ALL EYES ON THIS FIRST MATCH

262
00:09:32,648 --> 00:09:34,817
I mean, he can't even stay up properly.

263
00:09:35,651 --> 00:09:36,752
FWOOSH

264
00:09:38,087 --> 00:09:39,421
-Let's go!
-Should I attack?

265
00:09:40,155 --> 00:09:41,657
What was that?

266
00:09:41,724 --> 00:09:42,925
-Let's go!
-Should I attack?

267
00:09:42,992 --> 00:09:44,159
SWEARING

268
00:09:45,894 --> 00:09:47,563
What was that?

269
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,431
What was that?

270
00:09:52,201 --> 00:09:55,170
WHAT THE…

271
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:58,273
HE WAS CONFIDENT HE COULD BEAT O3OHN

272
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:00,042
HOP, HOP

273
00:10:00,109 --> 00:10:02,044
<i>If I hold out and make some fake moves,</i>

274
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,912
<i>I think he'll fall on his own.</i>

275
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:05,981
<i>I'll make him fall head-first.</i>

276
00:10:08,117 --> 00:10:10,486
EVEN THE OPPONENT IS FLUSTERED

277
00:10:10,552 --> 00:10:12,254
What the heck? He's dead!

278
00:10:12,955 --> 00:10:14,923
-Your glasses!
-Your glasses!

279
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:15,991
WOBBLING

280
00:10:16,058 --> 00:10:18,327
Hold on.
I think he did it to make it funny.

281
00:10:18,394 --> 00:10:21,196
-What was that?
-No, I think he planned this!

282
00:10:21,263 --> 00:10:23,332
How could you fall
even before we could cheer?

283
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,467
I was about to jump
when he just fell over.

284
00:10:25,534 --> 00:10:28,904
I think he did it on purpose
trying to be funny. What is this?

285
00:10:28,971 --> 00:10:30,072
COMEDIC TALENT

286
00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:32,808
Thank you. It was a good game.

287
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,677
<i>Anyway, O3ohn won.</i>

288
00:10:34,743 --> 00:10:35,778
<i>Two kilometers deducted.</i>

289
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:37,112
<i>It doesn't feel right.</i>

290
00:10:37,713 --> 00:10:39,114
Round 2
DINDIN VS IRON TONGUE

291
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:40,582
-Are you ready? Okay.
-Yes.

292
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,118
-Go!
-Let's go!

293
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,155
IRON TONGUE ATTACKS FIRST

294
00:10:46,622 --> 00:10:48,924
DINDIN GETS PUSHED BACK A BIT

295
00:10:49,391 --> 00:10:51,260
LOOK AT THAT

296
00:10:51,326 --> 00:10:52,661
Oh, no. DinDin!

297
00:10:52,728 --> 00:10:54,563
-Beat him!
-No!

298
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,132
IRON TONGUE IS LOOKING
FOR A CHANCE TO ATTACK AGAIN

299
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,772
Oh, no. DinDin!

300
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:08,844
-What's up? What's up, boy?
-Your glasses!

301
00:11:10,846 --> 00:11:12,014
What's up?

302
00:11:12,081 --> 00:11:14,083
What's up, boy? Yo, what's up?

303
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:16,418
Seungjae was trying to be funny!

304
00:11:16,485 --> 00:11:19,154
-Seriously. What was that?
-He wants to be funny.

305
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:22,124
HE ENDS UP LOSING AND FAILING TO BE FUNNY

306
00:11:22,191 --> 00:11:23,659
Jonathan, please get ready.

307
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,296
AND EVEN AFTER THAT…

308
00:11:27,362 --> 00:11:29,198
He let go of his leg first!

309
00:11:29,665 --> 00:11:30,699
Jonathan wins!

310
00:11:30,766 --> 00:11:34,203
ANCHOVIES KEEP WINNING

311
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:38,207
WITH 3 CONSECUTIVE WINS,
ANCHOVIES GET 6 KM DEDUCTED

312
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:39,942
COUNTING ON COACH SOLBIN

313
00:11:40,008 --> 00:11:42,377
<i>Today's main event.</i>

314
00:11:42,444 --> 00:11:43,912
<i>Let's go, Solbin!</i>

315
00:11:43,979 --> 00:11:45,614
It's the real main event now!

316
00:11:46,882 --> 00:11:48,150
The blue corner!

317
00:11:48,217 --> 00:11:49,985
-I look forward this the most.
-Solbin!

318
00:11:50,052 --> 00:11:51,120
Our only hope.

319
00:11:51,186 --> 00:11:53,989
CHOI DANIEL

320
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,158
-I'll do my best.
-No, no.

321
00:11:56,225 --> 00:11:57,793
Don't do you best. Don't fall too soon.

322
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,528
Hold out for a while and… You know?

323
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:01,029
-I understand.
-Good.

324
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:03,899
THE TWO SEEM TO BE PLOTTING SOMETHING

325
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,437
WHILE THEY WERE CHOOSING THEIR OPPONENTS

326
00:12:08,504 --> 00:12:10,973
-Let me win. Can you do that?
-What?

327
00:12:11,473 --> 00:12:12,841
I'll try.

328
00:12:12,908 --> 00:12:15,611
Just let me win,
and you can be shown more on the show.

329
00:12:15,677 --> 00:12:16,912
-I understand. Yes.
-Sounds good?

330
00:12:16,979 --> 00:12:18,914
IT FEELS LIKE DÉJÀ VU

331
00:12:19,648 --> 00:12:23,051
-The <i>gopchang</i> restaurant.
-The <i>gopchang</i> restaurant.

332
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:24,353
-It's on me.
-Okay.

333
00:12:24,887 --> 00:12:27,456
DURING LAST SSIREUM MATCH,
HE WON BY BRIBING HIM WITH GOPCHANG

334
00:12:27,923 --> 00:12:31,093
THIS ISN'T HIS FIRST BACKDOOR DEAL

335
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,229
HABITUAL BRIBER

336
00:12:34,696 --> 00:12:36,265
YOU KNOW, RIGHT?

337
00:12:37,032 --> 00:12:38,667
NODDING

338
00:12:38,734 --> 00:12:40,335
Okay. Get ready!

339
00:12:40,402 --> 00:12:41,537
Ready,

340
00:12:41,603 --> 00:12:42,604
go!

341
00:12:43,205 --> 00:12:45,374
I'm sorry, Daniel.

342
00:12:48,177 --> 00:12:49,244
I'm sorry, Daniel.

343
00:12:49,745 --> 00:12:51,547
BETRAYING HIM RIGHT AWAY

344
00:12:56,285 --> 00:12:58,020
FEELING EACH OTHER OUT WITH SPLASHING

345
00:12:58,086 --> 00:12:59,221
Come on, fight!

346
00:12:59,288 --> 00:13:01,123
-Hey, just fight!
-Fight.

347
00:13:01,523 --> 00:13:03,959
JUST GO FOR IT?

348
00:13:04,026 --> 00:13:05,594
One, two, three. No!

349
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,068
LOST IN 3 SECONDS

350
00:13:13,702 --> 00:13:15,938
-What are you doing?
-What was that?

351
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:18,273
-It wasn't even funny. What was that?
-Hold on.

352
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,609
Wait. Hold on a sec.
I have something to say.

353
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:22,110
There's a really big rock here.

354
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:24,079
We all sucked it up and played.

355
00:13:24,146 --> 00:13:26,481
I mean, he didn't even touch him.

356
00:13:26,548 --> 00:13:29,084
-Didn't even touch him.
-I can't believe you.

357
00:13:29,151 --> 00:13:31,453
Anyway, Daniel has lost

358
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,855
<i>and gets an additional 2 km.</i>

359
00:13:32,921 --> 00:13:34,356
ONLY DANIEL GETS AN ADDITIONAL 2 KM

360
00:13:34,423 --> 00:13:36,458
Since you're in the water anyway,

361
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:38,260
how about putting two kilometers at stake

362
00:13:38,327 --> 00:13:41,263
-and doing a 4-on-4 Chicken Fight?
-Okay!

363
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,598
-With 2 km at stake?
-Yes, 2 km.

364
00:13:42,664 --> 00:13:44,132
-Okay.
-If you win,

365
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:46,735
-you'll make up for Daniel's loss.
-Okay.

366
00:13:46,802 --> 00:13:48,604
EXTRA MATCH
4-ON-4 CHICKEN FIGHT

367
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,272
DEDUCTION OF 2 KM ON THE LINE

368
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:51,506
This is sweet.

369
00:13:51,573 --> 00:13:53,342
-Who should we go for first?
-Hey.

370
00:13:53,408 --> 00:13:54,610
We don't have to decide that.

371
00:13:54,676 --> 00:13:57,112
Just stay still, and the three of them
will fall coming over.

372
00:13:57,579 --> 00:13:59,248
THEY'RE LOOKING DOWN ON PRODUCTION TEAM

373
00:13:59,314 --> 00:14:00,315
-Just stay still.
-Okay.

374
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:02,885
This is practically a four-on-one.

375
00:14:02,951 --> 00:14:04,419
SOLBIN AND THE REST

376
00:14:04,486 --> 00:14:06,622
By the way, aren't you ashamed?

377
00:14:06,688 --> 00:14:08,724
You're all hiding behind Coach Solbin.

378
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,226
NOT AT ALL

379
00:14:11,293 --> 00:14:12,694
-Now, get ready!
-Okay!

380
00:14:13,161 --> 00:14:15,264
I think the three will
just fall themselves.

381
00:14:16,131 --> 00:14:18,967
WILL THE PRODUCTION TEAM WIN?

382
00:14:19,501 --> 00:14:22,237
OR THE LUCKY ANCHOVY TEAM?

383
00:14:22,304 --> 00:14:23,872
All right. Ready…

384
00:14:23,939 --> 00:14:24,940
Hold on!

385
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:27,876
Hey…

386
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:31,980
SPINNING

387
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:33,849
PLOP

388
00:14:34,349 --> 00:14:35,918
FALLS WHILE MAKING A RACKET

389
00:14:35,984 --> 00:14:37,252
He fell on his own.

390
00:14:37,319 --> 00:14:38,887
Hey, get out. You're in the way.

391
00:14:39,354 --> 00:14:41,523
"TRUDGING"

392
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,758
I'll go first.

393
00:14:42,824 --> 00:14:44,159
Let's go.

394
00:14:45,227 --> 00:14:46,895
"LIKE BOWLING PINS"

395
00:14:47,663 --> 00:14:48,697
Damn it.

396
00:14:49,531 --> 00:14:51,533
EXTRAS 1 AND 2 TEAMKILLING EACH OTHER

397
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,702
JONATHAN IS OUT TOO

398
00:14:55,237 --> 00:14:58,206
AND ONE MORE FALLS ON HIS OWN

399
00:14:58,674 --> 00:15:00,776
SOLBIN, DINDIN, O3OHN REMAINING

400
00:15:01,243 --> 00:15:02,344
What?

401
00:15:02,411 --> 00:15:03,412
Hold on.

402
00:15:04,313 --> 00:15:06,148
-Wait.
-Hey! What?

403
00:15:06,581 --> 00:15:07,582
I should have at him.

404
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:08,784
One, two, three.

405
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:11,954
NOT INTERESTED

406
00:15:12,254 --> 00:15:13,922
O3OHN AND SOLBIN GO HEAD-TO-HEAD

407
00:15:15,357 --> 00:15:18,193
ANCHOVIES WIN THE GROUP CHICKEN FIGHT

408
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,695
We won!

409
00:15:19,761 --> 00:15:21,029
Okay, okay!

410
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,131
Wow!

411
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:25,133
You have gotten 6 km deducted in total.

412
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,469
Hold on.

413
00:15:27,536 --> 00:15:29,104
What are you guys doing?

414
00:15:30,072 --> 00:15:32,574
The producers are all so pathetic.

415
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:34,042
God, unbelievable.

416
00:15:34,109 --> 00:15:35,811
We just stayed still and still won.

417
00:15:35,877 --> 00:15:37,579
Seriously, I haven't seen

418
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:39,548
such weak guys in a while.

419
00:15:40,882 --> 00:15:43,418
ROWING MACHINE
A TOTAL OF 16,044 M COMPLETED

420
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:46,989
-So, I was cut off during the game.
-Right. You go first.

421
00:15:47,055 --> 00:15:50,125
From now on, after a deduction game,

422
00:15:50,192 --> 00:15:51,860
-let's do rock paper scissors.
-Okay.

423
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:54,296
Rock paper scissors.

424
00:15:55,263 --> 00:15:56,264
I'm going first.

425
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:58,000
"DINDIN GOES FIRST"

426
00:16:03,038 --> 00:16:05,273
Hey, I'm exhausted,
because we were in the water.

427
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:07,476
I give up on the keychain for today.

428
00:16:08,643 --> 00:16:09,644
Why?

429
00:16:09,711 --> 00:16:11,079
I'm quick to give up.

430
00:16:12,381 --> 00:16:14,683
"GRINNING"

431
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,351
Why are you grinning like that?

432
00:16:17,652 --> 00:16:18,720
Take a nap.

433
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:21,223
-He wants to hog it.
-Just sleep.

434
00:16:23,158 --> 00:16:26,128
I think if I row about 5 km in one go,

435
00:16:26,661 --> 00:16:27,662
I'll win.

436
00:16:27,729 --> 00:16:29,264
Determined to win it today?

437
00:16:29,331 --> 00:16:30,799
Yes, no matter what.

438
00:16:32,267 --> 00:16:34,302
"DINDIN IS ENERGETIC"

439
00:16:34,836 --> 00:16:36,038
How much has he rowed?

440
00:16:36,638 --> 00:16:38,373
He's going over 2,800 m.

441
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,708
-That's a lot!
-He'll reach 3 km.

442
00:16:39,775 --> 00:16:40,776
It's the best record.

443
00:16:40,842 --> 00:16:41,910
GOING FOR IT FOR 15 MINUTES

444
00:16:47,949 --> 00:16:50,318
-DinDin, your knee's bleeding.
-No. What?

445
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,822
He's right. You're bleeding.

446
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:55,690
Well, I'm not feeling any pain.

447
00:16:57,659 --> 00:17:00,228
Why is DinDin working so hard today?

448
00:17:00,762 --> 00:17:02,664
<i>I really need the keychain.</i>

449
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:04,332
<i>He's showing his true colors.</i>

450
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:06,568
He's bent on winning it.
We should stop him.

451
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:08,503
<i>He's so determined today.</i>

452
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:10,238
Because if DinDin wins it today,

453
00:17:10,305 --> 00:17:11,540
he gets two million won.

454
00:17:11,606 --> 00:17:12,674
That can never happen.

455
00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:15,377
About the order…

456
00:17:15,977 --> 00:17:18,213
Let's decide it with something
other than rock paper scissors.

457
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,281
-Like what?
-Like what?

458
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:21,116
How about a fistfight?

459
00:17:22,184 --> 00:17:23,585
"SUGGESTING FISTFIGHT-ROWING"

460
00:17:23,652 --> 00:17:25,287
Yeah, fair and square.

461
00:17:25,353 --> 00:17:26,655
DinDin's rowed 5,000 m.

462
00:17:26,721 --> 00:17:28,557
It's 5,015 m to be exact.

463
00:17:28,623 --> 00:17:29,791
Wow, 5,015 m.

464
00:17:29,858 --> 00:17:30,859
Impressive.

465
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:34,696
"O3OHN GOES SECOND"

466
00:17:35,564 --> 00:17:37,766
O3ohn's posture looks so stable.

467
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,634
It's because he looks like

468
00:17:39,701 --> 00:17:41,603
-a boatman from the past.
-Come on.

469
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:48,443
O3OHN KEEPS GOING AS IF IT'S HIS JOB

470
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:54,749
AND THE NEXT PERSON IS
WAITING FOREVER FOR HIS TURN

471
00:17:55,917 --> 00:17:57,319
Hey, stop it already!

472
00:17:57,385 --> 00:17:58,620
Just 800 m to go.

473
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:00,889
-Geez.
-I'm going way faster than you.

474
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:01,957
You're so clueless.

475
00:18:02,424 --> 00:18:03,425
Last stroke.

476
00:18:03,992 --> 00:18:05,560
-Okay.
-You rowed 5,000.

477
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:08,563
-I'm exhausted.
-I didn't do my turn yet.

478
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,499
You know
rock paper scissors decides next turn.

479
00:18:10,565 --> 00:18:12,667
-But I didn't do my turn.
-It can happen.

480
00:18:12,734 --> 00:18:14,503
-Let's do a fistfight!
-It can't be helped.

481
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:16,571
Can I have my ring on?

482
00:18:18,373 --> 00:18:20,408
DINDIN AND O3OHN
COMPLETE 10 KM

483
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:21,476
All right.

484
00:18:22,677 --> 00:18:24,479
This time, the name of the game is

485
00:18:24,546 --> 00:18:25,547
"King of Jokgu."

486
00:18:25,614 --> 00:18:27,516
-I'm good at it. I'm great.
-Oh, <i>jokgu</i>!

487
00:18:27,582 --> 00:18:30,085
-Goodness.
-God, I hate ball sports.

488
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:33,755
It will be a five-on-five match
against the staff members.

489
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:35,557
Four players will play in the court,

490
00:18:35,624 --> 00:18:38,393
and you can substitute players
whenever you want.

491
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,195
And there's a crucial point.

492
00:18:40,262 --> 00:18:41,930
-What?
-The original reward was

493
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:43,365
a deduction of 10 km.

494
00:18:43,431 --> 00:18:44,766
-My God!
-Wow.

495
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:47,969
But it means if you lose,
you'd get an additional 10 km.

496
00:18:48,036 --> 00:18:49,037
That's a lot.

497
00:18:49,104 --> 00:18:51,039
So we've decided to give you a choice.

498
00:18:51,106 --> 00:18:52,974
Will you choose 5 km or 10 km?

499
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,809
Your squad has been decided?

500
00:18:54,876 --> 00:18:56,111
Yes, it has.

501
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:57,913
-Is there any good player?
-To help you decide,

502
00:18:57,979 --> 00:18:59,781
-should I tell you our squad?
-Yes.

503
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:01,516
All right, the first player.

504
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:04,686
Director Minhyeok.

505
00:19:05,921 --> 00:19:07,989
DIRECTOR MINHYEOK IS 194 CM TALL

506
00:19:09,324 --> 00:19:11,560
THE MAN WHO OVERPOWERED JONATHAN

507
00:19:12,294 --> 00:19:14,229
OH…

508
00:19:14,296 --> 00:19:15,764
Now, the second player.

509
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,465
Red Boy, Cho Myeongje.

510
00:19:23,271 --> 00:19:25,640
RED BOY GAVE THEM PAR TERRE HELL

511
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:28,243
-I think he'll be good too.
-He must be so good.

512
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:31,680
You know, Myeongje is
quite good at ball sports.

513
00:19:31,746 --> 00:19:32,747
Is that so?

514
00:19:32,814 --> 00:19:33,982
And the third player.

515
00:19:34,482 --> 00:19:35,483
Producer Seo Hyeongwon.

516
00:19:38,486 --> 00:19:39,487
-We choose 10 km.
-10 km.

517
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:40,889
-We choose 10 km.
-10 km.

518
00:19:41,189 --> 00:19:43,058
"CONVINCED THEY'LL WIN RIGHT AWAY"

519
00:19:43,124 --> 00:19:45,694
-Let me tell you again. If you lose,
-Yes.

520
00:19:46,094 --> 00:19:47,195
you'll get 10 km added.

521
00:19:47,262 --> 00:19:49,197
-No, 10 km. We'll go with 10.
-Let's go.

522
00:19:49,264 --> 00:19:51,166
-Okay, it's officially 10 km.
-Okay!

523
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:53,902
<i>All right, King of Jokgu</i>
<i>with 10 km on the line. Let's go.</i>

524
00:19:58,173 --> 00:19:59,975
-Serve.
-Serve the ball.

525
00:20:02,077 --> 00:20:04,079
Daniel, you get out.
Go be with the staff.

526
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:06,314
-You come in.
-But we need four.

527
00:20:06,381 --> 00:20:07,849
-Yes, Solbin, come in.
-Come here.

528
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,951
-Receive the ball in the back.
-Throw the ball.

529
00:20:10,018 --> 00:20:12,020
SOLBIN JOINS THE ANCHOVY TEAM

00:26:14,382 --> 00:26:15,717
Solbin's so cool.

707
00:26:16,818 --> 00:26:18,086
O3ohn, you're rooting well. Okay.

708
00:26:18,553 --> 00:26:19,887
-Oh, my.
-Okay!

709
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:21,889
"O3OHN JUST DODGES THE BALL NOW"

710
00:26:21,956 --> 00:26:23,358
-Okay!
-Wow.

711
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:26,661
"ANCHOVY TEAM'S TEAMWORK'S GETTING BETTER"

712
00:26:26,728 --> 00:26:27,962
This is insane.

713
00:26:30,765 --> 00:26:32,767
"A LONG RALLY"

714
00:26:32,834 --> 00:26:33,868
Good!

715
00:26:33,935 --> 00:26:34,936
"SAFE RECEIVE"

716
00:26:35,003 --> 00:26:36,037
This is crazy.

717
00:26:37,005 --> 00:26:38,239
Careful. This is a good attack.

718
00:26:39,173 --> 00:26:41,376
"WILL PRODUCTION TEAM SCORE A POINT?"

719
00:26:43,611 --> 00:26:44,712
-Nice!
-Nice!

720
00:26:44,779 --> 00:26:45,913
"SOLBIN'S SUPER PLAY!"

721
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,849
-No way!
-Solbin!

722
00:26:48,249 --> 00:26:50,852
Wow, Solbin's doing great. He's so good.

723
00:26:51,586 --> 00:26:54,122
"IT ALL COMES DOWN TO WHO MAKES A MISTAKE"

724
00:26:57,258 --> 00:26:58,493
-Amazing teamwork.
-What?

725
00:26:58,559 --> 00:26:59,661
-Good!
-It's gonna be on the line.

726
00:26:59,727 --> 00:27:00,728
Jonathan, good!

727
00:27:00,795 --> 00:27:02,063
What's happening?

728
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:03,765
"PRODUCTION TEAM MAKES A MISTAKE FIRST"

729
00:27:05,133 --> 00:27:07,201
-Keep heading it if you can.
-Okay, head.

730
00:27:07,802 --> 00:27:11,472
They're basically one player short,
and still winning. Wow.

731
00:27:12,807 --> 00:27:13,808
Good.

732
00:27:14,308 --> 00:27:15,576
What a serve!

733
00:27:18,312 --> 00:27:19,947
"RED BOY'S MISTAKE THIS TIME"

734
00:27:20,014 --> 00:27:22,016
Okay. Acting all cool, he was like,

735
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:24,318
"All right, I'll toss it to you."

736
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:26,621
PRODUCTION TEAM FALTERS

737
00:27:30,425 --> 00:27:31,926
SLIPS

738
00:27:31,993 --> 00:27:33,494
It's all right. Knees are allowed.

739
00:27:33,561 --> 00:27:34,929
-Out!
-Out.

740
00:27:34,996 --> 00:27:37,265
ANCHOVY TEAM 3 - 0 PRODUCTION TEAM

741
00:27:37,331 --> 00:27:38,633
ANCHOVY TEAM 4 - 0 PRODUCTION TEAM

742
00:27:39,434 --> 00:27:40,368
Good.

743
00:27:41,536 --> 00:27:42,537
It's over.

744
00:27:43,471 --> 00:27:44,906
ANCHOVY TEAM 5 - 0 PRODUCTION TEAM

745
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:49,944
ANCHOVY TEAM WINS

746
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:52,847
-We won.
-Wow, let's go, DinDin.

747
00:27:52,914 --> 00:27:55,016
-What was that? It was amazing.
-I told you.

748
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:56,417
I like football.

749
00:27:56,484 --> 00:27:57,585
I can just feel it.

750
00:27:57,652 --> 00:27:59,654
How should I put it?
Not a high bounce like this.

751
00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:00,888
It should fly straight.

752
00:28:00,955 --> 00:28:03,424
I was in charge of psychological warfare.

753
00:28:03,491 --> 00:28:06,160
Without me as their defender,
they wouldn't have won.

754
00:28:06,227 --> 00:28:08,262
EVERYONE SAYS IT'S ALL THANKS TO THEM

755
00:28:08,963 --> 00:28:12,567
Who was the MVP of the King of Jokgu?

756
00:28:13,768 --> 00:28:15,770
-What? You saw it.
-The MVP…

757
00:28:16,838 --> 00:28:19,006
10 KM DEDUCTED!

758
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:22,009
Hey. How many kilometers left now?

759
00:28:22,477 --> 00:28:24,212
OUT OF 80 KM
36 KM COMPLETED

760
00:28:24,278 --> 00:28:25,413
36 km completed.

761
00:28:26,047 --> 00:28:27,682
I'm shocked again today.

762
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:29,717
Plus, they're doing better
than I expected.

763
00:28:30,118 --> 00:28:32,220
JOKGU WASN'T THE END…

764
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,123
<i>All four of you must flip the pancakes</i>

765
00:28:35,189 --> 00:28:36,858
<i>perfectly in one go.</i>

766
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:38,326
DinDin!

767
00:28:40,695 --> 00:28:42,597
BEHOLD, YOU PRODUCTION PEOPLE

768
00:28:42,663 --> 00:28:45,299
-Good, good! Great.
-Great!

769
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,001
<i>They're doing so well.</i>

770
00:28:50,972 --> 00:28:53,875
ANCHOVIES ARE ON FIRE

771
00:28:54,342 --> 00:28:55,610
Great!

772
00:28:56,844 --> 00:28:58,946
Nothing's going your way.

773
00:28:59,013 --> 00:29:01,349
The producer doesn't look so happy.

774
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:05,119
<i>I thought to myself, "I'm screwed."</i>

775
00:29:06,187 --> 00:29:08,156

776
