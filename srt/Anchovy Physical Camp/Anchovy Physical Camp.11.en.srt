00:00:04,781 --> 00:00:07,550
THE SECOND OUTDOOR TRAINING

2
00:00:07,617 --> 00:00:09,285
It's so well-equipped.

3
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:11,921
I wonder what they'll have us do today.

4
00:00:13,156 --> 00:00:14,357
What's that?

5
00:00:15,158 --> 00:00:16,459
What on earth is that?

6
00:00:18,861 --> 00:00:20,296
Wow, hey, look at that.

7
00:00:20,763 --> 00:00:21,964
Look at that.

8
00:00:22,031 --> 00:00:23,032
Him over there.

9
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:26,402
Everyone's a professional here. Wow.

10
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:28,871
It's not going to be easy today.

11
00:00:28,938 --> 00:00:30,273
But then, when was it ever easy?

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,175
-All right.
-Yes?

13
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:34,544
We're filming outdoors today as well.

14
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:38,881
We're at a 66-year-old mountain gym
in the center of Seoul.

15
00:00:38,948 --> 00:00:40,650
Wow, 66 years old?

16
00:00:40,716 --> 00:00:41,984
-That's correct.
-Wow.

17
00:00:42,485 --> 00:00:45,154
It's so well-equipped,
unlike other mountain gyms.

18
00:00:45,221 --> 00:00:46,389
Tell me about it.

19
00:00:46,456 --> 00:00:48,424
First, we'll do a quick score check.

20
00:00:48,491 --> 00:00:49,492
A score check?

21
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:51,360
We'll check your status of the keychains.

22
00:00:51,427 --> 00:00:52,595
Who won it last time?

23
00:00:52,662 --> 00:00:55,098
In the lead is DinDin, with two keychains.

24
00:00:55,731 --> 00:00:59,535
Tied for second place are
O3ohn and Choi Daniel with one keychain.

25
00:01:00,103 --> 00:01:01,737
There's still someone without it?

26
00:01:02,205 --> 00:01:03,439
And currently in last place

27
00:01:03,906 --> 00:01:04,907
is Jonathan.

28
00:01:04,974 --> 00:01:07,009
He has won no Anchovy Keychain so far.

29
00:01:07,076 --> 00:01:08,878
Shouldn't you drop out if you still

30
00:01:08,945 --> 00:01:10,613
-have none?
-What are you talking about?

31
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,381
-He's a true anchovy.
-I've just been unlucky.

32
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:14,951
The moment you give up, it's gone.

33
00:01:15,017 --> 00:01:16,385
-That's right.
-Yeah.

34
00:01:16,452 --> 00:01:18,254
-You gave up.
-You're a quitter.

35
00:01:18,321 --> 00:01:19,722
Who rang the bell last time?

36
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:21,591
-You did.
-Come on!

37
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:24,527
We didn't give up!

38
00:01:24,594 --> 00:01:25,728
"HE'S NOT WRONG, BUT…"

39
00:01:25,795 --> 00:01:27,163
Are you serious?

40
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,664
-DinDin didn't give up.
-I didn't.

41
00:01:28,731 --> 00:01:29,799
O3ohn didn't, either.

42
00:01:29,866 --> 00:01:32,301
Man, how could you
remember it so differently?

43
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:33,636
You can win one today.

44
00:01:33,703 --> 00:01:36,172
He's right. Don't give up today, okay?

45
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:37,673
It's just the beginning for me.

46
00:01:38,107 --> 00:01:40,543
-I'll show I can do it from now on.
-Right.

47
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:41,811
-That's right.
-Let's go!

48
00:01:42,245 --> 00:01:45,348
Now, I'll reveal the sixth mission.

49
00:01:46,182 --> 00:01:48,885
Today, we'll see
who has the strongest back.

50
00:01:48,951 --> 00:01:50,286
Oh, back strength?

51
00:01:50,753 --> 00:01:51,854
This is bad.

52
00:01:51,921 --> 00:01:53,723
One of the best back workout machines,

53
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,258
the lat pull-down machine.

54
00:01:58,027 --> 00:01:59,061
A hundred tons in total.

55
00:01:59,128 --> 00:02:01,063
A 100-TON LAT PULL-DOWN

56
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,732
100 TONS?

57
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:04,600
What?

58
00:02:05,568 --> 00:02:06,736
What was that?

59
00:02:06,802 --> 00:02:08,237
It's 100,000 kg.

60
00:02:09,405 --> 00:02:11,707
HIS BRAIN HAS STOPPED

61
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:14,410
DID I HEAR WRONG?

62
00:02:15,011 --> 00:02:17,346
How do you even calculate up to 100 tons?

63
00:02:17,413 --> 00:02:18,414
I have no idea.

64
00:02:18,481 --> 00:02:20,149
I can't even imagine it.

65
00:02:20,216 --> 00:02:21,384
Even one ton is a lot.

66
00:02:21,884 --> 00:02:22,985
"HEADACHE"

67
00:02:23,052 --> 00:02:25,421
Now, I'll tell you
how your score will be calculated.

68
00:02:25,488 --> 00:02:27,089
The weight multiplied by the number.

69
00:02:27,156 --> 00:02:29,859
The one who scores highest
will win the keychain.

70
00:02:30,993 --> 00:02:33,095
Doesn't Jonathan have
the strongest muscle power?

71
00:02:33,563 --> 00:02:35,665
I guess it's my time to shine now.

72
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:38,167
<i>The keychain is mine.</i>

73
00:02:38,734 --> 00:02:41,604
When you're on tiptoes,
your legs should be fixed.

74
00:02:41,671 --> 00:02:44,140
And your grip should be a bit wider
than your shoulders.

75
00:02:44,207 --> 00:02:47,877
And then, pull it down to your chin
and let it back up.

76
00:02:47,944 --> 00:02:51,747
THE KEY IS TO PULL IT DOWN WITH YOUR LATS

77
00:02:51,814 --> 00:02:54,250
-All right. Are you all ready?
-Yes.

78
00:02:54,317 --> 00:02:55,918
We'll begin now.

79
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:58,588
All right. I'll try first.

80
00:02:59,055 --> 00:03:01,290
Daniel knows this,
but I have a rack at home.

81
00:03:01,357 --> 00:03:02,358
-Really?
-Yeah.

82
00:03:02,425 --> 00:03:04,360
When I wake up in the morning, I do this.

83
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:06,662
-First, I'll try 10 kg.
-You'll do it now?

84
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:07,830
Yes, 10 kg.

85
00:03:08,598 --> 00:03:10,366
DinDin will go with 10 kg first.

86
00:03:11,033 --> 00:03:12,835
"LAT PULL-DOWN, 100 TONS"

87
00:03:12,902 --> 00:03:15,238
-One.
-Good. What's wrong?

88
00:03:16,172 --> 00:03:18,174
-Is it too light?
-Too light?

89
00:03:19,008 --> 00:03:20,276
No, I feel the weight with 10 kg.

90
00:03:21,143 --> 00:03:22,278
"I KNEW IT"

91
00:03:22,345 --> 00:03:24,814
-He'll go with 5 kg.
-I feel the weight with 10 kg.

92
00:03:25,348 --> 00:03:26,449
He changed it to 5 kg.

93
00:03:28,017 --> 00:03:29,085
-Here I go.
-Okay.

94
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:31,721
One. Two.

95
00:03:32,188 --> 00:03:33,990
-He looks adorable.
-Good.

96
00:03:34,523 --> 00:03:37,026
-Seven.
-It feels nice. I can feel it.

97
00:03:37,526 --> 00:03:39,295
-It's delicious.
-You're doing good.

98
00:03:39,362 --> 00:03:41,864
-It's as good as a Michelin dish.
-You're doing great.

99
00:03:42,331 --> 00:03:43,332
Nine.

100
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:44,934
A hundred.

101
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:48,070
-I've done 510 kg.
-Hey, 510 is great.

102
00:03:48,137 --> 00:03:51,240
-That's good.
-Listen. I just did 100 pull-downs.

103
00:03:51,307 --> 00:03:54,010
But if you do 10 pull-downs with 50 kg,
that's 500 kg.

104
00:03:54,076 --> 00:03:55,278
Just 10 pull-downs.

105
00:03:55,344 --> 00:03:56,979
-All right. I'll go next.
-Okay.

106
00:03:57,513 --> 00:03:59,315
-How heavy?
-I'll go with 50 kg.

107
00:03:59,382 --> 00:04:00,916
-Yes, try it.
-50 kg.

108
00:04:00,983 --> 00:04:02,285
Daniel, 50 kg.

109
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:05,554
You know, I do pull-ups all the time.

110
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:08,758
-My goodness.
-One.

111
00:04:08,824 --> 00:04:10,059
Let's go, Daniel.

112
00:04:10,126 --> 00:04:11,127
-Goodness.
-What?

113
00:04:11,193 --> 00:04:12,361
My gosh.

114
00:04:12,428 --> 00:04:13,496
Three.

115
00:04:13,562 --> 00:04:15,231
-His form is good.
-Four.

116
00:04:16,499 --> 00:04:17,500
Five.

117
00:04:17,566 --> 00:04:19,035
I think we'll be finished early.

118
00:04:19,101 --> 00:04:21,137
-Six.
-It's a piece of cake today.

119
00:04:21,203 --> 00:04:22,438
This is easy-peasy.

120
00:04:22,505 --> 00:04:26,842
-All right, 500 kg for now.
-This saves a lot of time.

121
00:04:26,909 --> 00:04:29,345
All right, then.
I'll go with low weight, high reps.

122
00:04:29,412 --> 00:04:31,013
-Okay.
-Me too.

123
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,081
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

124
00:04:32,148 --> 00:04:34,917
Then Jonathan and I will go
with low reps, high weight.

125
00:04:34,984 --> 00:04:37,687
-Let's go, 50 kg.
-I've never done a lat pull-down before.

Nine.

He has a knack for it.

00:04:47,063 --> 00:04:48,097
Ten.

132
00:04:48,564 --> 00:04:50,299
-It's doable, right?
-Yes. No problem.

133
00:04:50,366 --> 00:04:51,834
-Okay, good.
-Let's go.

134
00:04:51,901 --> 00:04:54,170

Five.

You don't feel the weight
with 10 kg, right?

137
00:04:58,107 --> 00:04:59,275
-Nine.
-Yes, it's doable.

138
00:04:59,342 --> 00:05:00,343
Fifty.

139
00:05:00,409 --> 00:05:01,477
He just did 500 kg.

140
00:05:01,544 --> 00:05:02,678
We've now done two tons.

141
00:05:02,745 --> 00:05:05,715
-Right. This is good.
-It's a piece of cake today.

Look at us. We're all smiling right now.

00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:14,256
One. Two.

00:05:15,157 --> 00:05:16,859

-I did one ton again?

Hold on.
Everyone's going for a ton from now on?

Okay. I got it.

-That's it, right? Okay!
-Okay.

162
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:51,160
To be honest, I don't feel any pressure
with the game either.

163
00:05:51,227 --> 00:05:53,295
Maybe they prepared difficult games?

164
00:05:53,829 --> 00:05:56,632

we've slightly changed the game rules.

-All right.
-Don't do that.

177
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,768
No, three biscuits.

178
00:06:32,835 --> 00:06:34,203
-Three pieces?
-Yes.

179
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,871
Is that hard to do in a minute?

180
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:37,506
-Who can't do it?
-In a minute?

181
00:06:37,573 --> 00:06:39,208
Jonathan would do it easily.

182
00:06:39,275 --> 00:06:40,643
It sounds so easy.

183
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:41,744
Is it hard?

184
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:43,546
-Shall we begin?
-Okay.

185
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:44,947
-A minute?
-Yes, a minute.

186
00:06:45,548 --> 00:06:46,549
Ready.

187
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,286
-Set, go!
-A minute is shorter than you'd think.

188
00:06:50,352 --> 00:06:52,354
-DinDin might not be able to do it.
-How is it?

189
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,291
Okay, okay.

190
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,394
-We only get a minute.
-A minute is shorter than you'd think.

191
00:07:00,296 --> 00:07:01,997
What? What is it?

192
00:07:02,064 --> 00:07:04,600
What's wrong? What do you mean by that?

193
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:06,535
-Is it easy or not?
-He can't swallow it.

194
00:07:06,602 --> 00:07:08,504
Oh, no, he can't eat fast.

195
00:07:08,571 --> 00:07:10,206
He can't eat fast.

196
00:07:10,272 --> 00:07:11,340
How is it?

197
00:07:12,508 --> 00:07:14,610
Do you mean it's easy or what?

198
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:18,447
What is it?

199
00:07:19,515 --> 00:07:20,850
Hey, what do you mean?

200
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,185
WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

201
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:24,920
GROANING

202
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:27,022
-It's impossible.
-It's impossible?

203
00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:29,124
It's too dry. You can't eat it like that.

204
00:07:29,191 --> 00:07:30,693
He's right. It's impossible.

205
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:32,561
"YOU'RE RIGHT… I CAN'T DO IT…"

206
00:07:32,962 --> 00:07:34,096
Gosh.

207
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:35,998
Time's up!

208
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:38,234
Oh, no.

209
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:39,668
How was it?

210
00:07:39,735 --> 00:07:41,470
When I had enough saliva at first,

211
00:07:41,537 --> 00:07:42,838
-it was so easy.
-Right.

212
00:07:42,905 --> 00:07:44,773
But the whole wheat
absorbs all your saliva.

213
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,308
Right, it absorbs it fast.

214
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:49,912
-So it felt like I was chewing sand.
-Really?

215
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:51,514
-Hey, O3ohn.
-Let's go, O3ohn.

216
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,915
You should eat all three at once.

217
00:07:52,982 --> 00:07:54,116
-At once?
-Yeah.

218
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:55,417
Let's go, O3ohn.

219
00:07:55,484 --> 00:07:56,785
I'll put two in at once.

220
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:58,354
All right, here you go.

221
00:07:59,321 --> 00:08:00,789
Set, go!

222
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:02,191
STUFFING

223
00:08:02,258 --> 00:08:03,292
A POWERFUL START

224
00:08:03,359 --> 00:08:05,828
Good. You're doing great.

225
00:08:05,895 --> 00:08:07,496
You see what I meant, right?

226
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:11,100
-You need to drown it in saliva.
-Put it in right away.

227
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:12,601
I can't chew it!

228
00:08:14,336 --> 00:08:16,038
It all gets concentrated.

229
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:17,973
What is it, O3ohn? What's wrong?

230
00:08:19,408 --> 00:08:23,612
ONLY THOSE WHO HAVE DONE IT
SHOW THIS ODD REACTION

231
00:08:23,679 --> 00:08:27,116
ONLY THOSE WHO HAVE DONE IT
SHOW THIS ODD REACTION

232
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:28,851
I can't swallow it!

233
00:08:29,652 --> 00:08:31,453
Four. Three.

234
00:08:31,921 --> 00:08:32,955
You can't do it?

235
00:08:33,022 --> 00:08:34,557
-Come on.
-Fail.

236
00:08:34,623 --> 00:08:35,858
This is impossible.

237
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,160
How is this impossible?

238
00:08:38,794 --> 00:08:40,029
It's impossible.

239
00:08:40,663 --> 00:08:42,031
It's impossible?

240
00:08:42,097 --> 00:08:44,366
-Your mouth gets so dry.
-You can't chew it.

241
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,068
-Really?
-Daniel, putting three in

242
00:08:46,135 --> 00:08:47,903
all at once might be better.

243
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:48,971
I'll do that, then.

244
00:08:49,038 --> 00:08:50,673
-I'll be strategic.
-Daniel.

245
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:51,874
Ready, set,

246
00:08:52,341 --> 00:08:53,342
go!

247
00:09:00,549 --> 00:09:03,485
"HE PUT IN ALL 3 IN JUST 8 SECONDS"

248
00:09:03,552 --> 00:09:05,921
Now it's hard to chew it.
You get it now, right?

249
00:09:06,622 --> 00:09:07,723
Oh, you can do it?

250
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:10,292
I think he'll succeed.

251
00:09:13,162 --> 00:09:15,030
"HOLD ON…"

252
00:09:21,704 --> 00:09:22,905
<i>How is this impossible?</i>

253
00:09:22,972 --> 00:09:24,006
"YES, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE"

254
00:09:29,545 --> 00:09:30,579
You just can't chew it.

255
00:09:30,646 --> 00:09:32,615
My jaw started to hurt later.

256
00:09:32,681 --> 00:09:33,682
Gosh!

257
00:09:35,985 --> 00:09:39,922
"NOW HE CAN UNDERSTAND
THE OTHERS' STRUGGLES"

258
00:09:39,989 --> 00:09:41,256
You can't… What?

259
00:09:42,157 --> 00:09:43,158
Hey, Daniel.

260
00:09:44,093 --> 00:09:45,527
No, there's still a lot left.

261
00:09:45,594 --> 00:09:46,629
-No.
-Five.

262
00:09:46,695 --> 00:09:47,696
Four.

263
00:09:48,197 --> 00:09:49,932
-Three. Two.
-No way.

264
00:09:50,432 --> 00:09:52,067
-One. Time's up.
-He can't.

265
00:09:56,038 --> 00:09:58,173
Man, you're so nasty!

266
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,109
I just couldn't swallow it.

267
00:10:00,175 --> 00:10:01,343
Seriously.

268
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,545
-I just couldn't swallow it.
-Darn it!

269
00:10:03,612 --> 00:10:05,180
-I couldn't swallow it.
-Come on.

270
00:10:05,247 --> 00:10:07,516
-What was that?
-I can't believe this.

271
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,351
-Who will clean this?
-Seriously, man.

272
00:10:09,418 --> 00:10:10,619
Eat it again!

273
00:10:10,686 --> 00:10:11,687
Who will clean it?

274
00:10:11,754 --> 00:10:14,056
He's so nasty. Goodness.

275
00:10:14,123 --> 00:10:15,290
You just can't swallow it.

276
00:10:15,357 --> 00:10:17,459
-It's just impossible.
-It really is.

277
00:10:17,526 --> 00:10:19,461
-Let's see how he does it.
-My jaw hurts.

278
00:10:19,528 --> 00:10:21,430
JONATHAN'S TURN

279
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:23,565
AS FOR THE BISCUITS…

280
00:10:23,632 --> 00:10:25,167
-Biscuits and milk for me.
-Biscuits?

281
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:28,437
An oasis in the desert?

282
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:31,206
"THESE BISCUITS ARE
JONATHAN'S FAVORITE SNACK"

283
00:10:31,273 --> 00:10:33,575
I'll show you
how much I love those biscuits.

284
00:10:33,642 --> 00:10:36,311
The biscuit company
even sent me this as a gift.

285
00:10:36,378 --> 00:10:39,148
I like it so much
that I eat it with bread.

286
00:10:39,214 --> 00:10:40,349
-Without water?
-Yes.

287
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,751
When I was in high school, during classes,

288
00:10:42,818 --> 00:10:44,186
I'd hide it here and…

289
00:10:45,587 --> 00:10:47,456
I'd eat it fast like this.

290
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:49,191
-Wow.
-I'll give it a shot.

291
00:10:49,258 --> 00:10:50,826
"GAME OF JONATHAN,
BY JONATHAN, FOR JONATHAN"

292
00:10:51,326 --> 00:10:52,327
Okay.

293
00:10:52,394 --> 00:10:53,896
-Are you ready?
-I'm ready.

294
00:10:53,962 --> 00:10:54,963
Ready.

295
00:10:55,497 --> 00:10:57,166
Set, go!

296
00:10:59,301 --> 00:11:00,636
"SAVORING IT"

297
00:11:00,703 --> 00:11:02,604
Aren't you taking it too slowly?

298
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:06,942
He's eating it differently from us.

299
00:11:07,476 --> 00:11:09,945
"HE PUTS IN THE SECOND ONE IN 10 SECONDS"

300
00:11:10,012 --> 00:11:12,715
The way he moves his tongue is different.

301
00:11:12,781 --> 00:11:14,216
LIKE THIS

302
00:11:15,117 --> 00:11:17,720
HE PUTS IN THE LAST ONE AT A FAST PACE

303
00:11:20,489 --> 00:11:21,924
Oh, it's different.

304
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:24,059
He's different. He's different from us!

305
00:11:24,126 --> 00:11:25,127
He's using his front teeth.

306
00:11:25,194 --> 00:11:26,195
Use gravity!

307
00:11:26,662 --> 00:11:27,896
-Seriously?
-Wow.

308
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,631
He's swallowing it.

309
00:11:29,698 --> 00:11:31,934
-Ten seconds left!
-What?

310
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,335
Hurry up!

311
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:35,270
I SHOULD SOMEHOW WHISTLE…

312
00:11:35,337 --> 00:11:38,006
YES! JUST WHISTLE!

313
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:47,583
Three, two, one. Time's up.

314
00:11:48,283 --> 00:11:49,418
Fail!

315
00:11:49,485 --> 00:11:51,286
Now, three tons have been added.

316
00:11:52,054 --> 00:11:54,389
Hey, what are you even good at?

317
00:11:54,456 --> 00:11:56,058
You said you could do it!

318
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:57,626
The way I see it,

319
00:11:57,693 --> 00:12:00,596
Jonathan isn't really good at anything.

320
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:06,001
"HE HAS NOTHING TO SAY"

321
00:12:11,206 --> 00:12:12,508
We'll resume with DinDin.

322
00:12:12,574 --> 00:12:13,942
I'll go with 15 kg.

323
00:12:14,843 --> 00:12:15,844
One.

324
00:12:16,345 --> 00:12:17,379
Two.

00:12:19,314 --> 00:12:20,482
Four.

Nine.

328
00:12:22,651 --> 00:12:24,353
-Fifty.
-Okay.

329
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:25,654
Nice.

330
00:12:26,321 --> 00:12:27,756
I should try it this way too.

331
00:12:27,823 --> 00:12:29,224
-With a light weight?
-Yes.

332
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:31,160
I think this will work too.

333
00:12:31,226 --> 00:12:32,427

334
00:12:32,494 --> 00:12:33,762

Six.

00:12:39,067 --> 00:12:41,737
-Fifty. One.
-Oh, now I know how to do it properly.

339
00:12:41,804 --> 00:12:44,106
If I do it this way,
I can feel it in my back.

340
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:47,276
-Eight.
-Look at Jonathan's face.

341
00:12:47,843 --> 00:12:50,112
-He looks gangster.
-Seriously.

342
00:12:50,179 --> 00:12:52,080
There's anger in his eyes.

343
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:54,283
Daniel, how many are you going to do?

344
00:12:54,349 --> 00:12:55,584
Are you doing 100 at once?

345
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:57,786
-Wow.
-Five.

346
00:12:57,853 --> 00:12:58,954
Six. Seven.

-Eight.

00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:02,257
-It's my turn!
-Nine.

349
00:13:02,724 --> 00:13:03,725
Eighty.

350
00:13:03,792 --> 00:13:05,260
He's really going for 100.

351
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:06,628
Three. Straighten your arms.

352
00:13:06,695 --> 00:13:08,463
He doesn't straighten his arms properly.

353
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,566
Five. Six.

His face screams that it's not fair.

356
00:13:15,304 --> 00:13:16,438
Ten.

357
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:17,773
My goal today

358
00:13:18,307 --> 00:13:20,509
is to prevent Jonathan
from winning the keychain.

359
00:13:21,276 --> 00:13:22,611
"PURE EVIL"

360
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:23,779
Let's go!

361
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,415
-Eight.
-He's exhausted.

362
00:13:27,115 --> 00:13:28,116
Two more.

363
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:29,585
Because that'll be fun.

364
00:13:29,651 --> 00:13:32,588
"LAUGHING"

365
00:13:32,654 --> 00:13:35,090
I just find it fun
when you don't win the keychain.

366
00:13:35,591 --> 00:13:36,992
You're showing your true colors.

367
00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:39,628
I heard you cried after I rang the bell.

368
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:41,697
It was just crocodile tears.

369
00:13:41,763 --> 00:13:43,298
That's how life is!

370
00:13:44,132 --> 00:13:46,401
-It's 20 kg now.
-20 kg?

371
00:13:46,969 --> 00:13:48,370
One.

372
00:13:48,437 --> 00:13:49,438
Two.

373
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:52,107
-Ten.
-You have to do 90 more.

374
00:13:52,841 --> 00:13:54,443
-Wow.
-Two.

375
00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:55,611
I'm out of breath just watching him.

376
00:13:55,677 --> 00:13:56,979
-Right?
-Four.

377
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:58,680
Six.

378
00:13:58,747 --> 00:13:59,815
Seven.

379
00:14:00,582 --> 00:14:01,583
Eight.

380
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:04,720
-Sixty. One.
-"I hate the other guys."

381
00:14:04,786 --> 00:14:06,088
Two.

382
00:14:06,655 --> 00:14:09,057
"I hate the guys
for teasing me all the time."

383
00:14:09,124 --> 00:14:10,626
Who are you imitating?

384
00:14:11,126 --> 00:14:12,127
It's Jonathan's inner voice.

385
00:14:12,594 --> 00:14:13,762
No, he must be thinking,

386
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:15,497
"Ha! You think I can't do it?"

387
00:14:16,331 --> 00:14:17,666
"The keychain is mine."

388
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:19,534
"THE PURE EVIL DUO"

389
00:14:20,002 --> 00:14:21,003
What?

390
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:22,971
-More? Wow.
-One. Two.

391
00:14:23,038 --> 00:14:24,907
"HE DOESN'T STOP"

392
00:14:24,973 --> 00:14:27,142
"I can't do it anymore."

393
00:14:27,209 --> 00:14:30,245
"Should I just give up like before?"

394
00:14:30,312 --> 00:14:31,947
Hey!

395
00:14:33,715 --> 00:14:35,150
-Seventy.
-Let's get it!

396
00:14:35,217 --> 00:14:37,786
"NO MATTER HOW MUCH DINDIN YAPS,
JONATHAN KEEPS GOING!"

397
00:14:37,853 --> 00:14:39,321
-Seven.
-Wow.

398
00:14:39,388 --> 00:14:40,722
Eight.

399
00:14:40,789 --> 00:14:41,790
Nine.

400
00:14:42,491 --> 00:14:44,760
"100 PULL-DOWNS (2 TONS) COMPLETED"

401
00:14:44,826 --> 00:14:45,961
-What, more?
-One.

402
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:47,496
Ten.

403
00:14:47,562 --> 00:14:49,264
-More? Wow.
-Wow.

404
00:14:49,331 --> 00:14:51,366
"THANKS TO JONATHAN
WHO OVERCAME THE OLDER GUYS' TEASING…"

405
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:52,434
Let's go!

406
00:14:52,501 --> 00:14:54,303
…30 TONS ARE COMPLETED

407
00:14:54,369 --> 00:14:55,637
<i>-Okay.</i>
<i>-Let's go to the front.</i>

408
00:14:55,704 --> 00:14:58,073
All right! This game is big.

409
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,375
-A deduction of 10 tons is on the line.
-Wow!

410
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:01,777
If we fail, will it get added too?

411
00:15:01,843 --> 00:15:04,012
-That's correct.
-The rule can work against us.

412
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,647
This game to test your delivery ability

413
00:15:05,714 --> 00:15:07,749
is a relay with a 10-kg dumbbell.

414
00:15:07,816 --> 00:15:09,651
-A four-person relay?
-Yes.

415
00:15:10,552 --> 00:15:12,354
<i>With a 10-kg dumbbell as a baton,</i>

416
00:15:12,421 --> 00:15:15,691
<i>you'll play a relay</i>
<i>with four staff members.</i>

417
00:15:15,757 --> 00:15:17,893
<i>-It's about 300 m in total.</i>
<i>-All right.</i>

418
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,962
It's important
which staff members are participating.

419
00:15:20,028 --> 00:15:21,763
You'll see them on the track.

420
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:22,898
Now, decide on the order.

421
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:25,801
You two should run first and last.

422
00:15:26,335 --> 00:15:27,569
Because I'm a slow runner.

423
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:29,538
-Then you run second.
-Okay, second.

424
00:15:29,604 --> 00:15:31,106
You, third. I'll run last.

425
00:15:31,573 --> 00:15:32,808
I think we should win this,

426
00:15:32,874 --> 00:15:35,277
so that they lose their momentum.

427
00:15:35,344 --> 00:15:37,012
We can't lose. It's 10 tons on the line.

428
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:38,880
Tell the next runner if it gets tiring.

429
00:15:38,947 --> 00:15:41,383
Say, "Come to me," and we'll come
and receive the baton earlier.

430
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,451
Okay.

431
00:15:43,051 --> 00:15:44,553
<i>Have you decided on the order?</i>

432
00:15:44,619 --> 00:15:46,054
<i>Yes, we have.</i>

433
00:15:46,121 --> 00:15:47,155
<i>Then let's go.</i>

434
00:15:49,091 --> 00:15:50,826
-The course looks good.
-Yes.

435
00:15:50,892 --> 00:15:52,260
It's nice and flat.

436
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:54,262
-It looks nice for running.
-Right.

437

"A COURSE LOVED BY MANY RUNNERS"

438
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:58,100
It feels heavier than I thought.

439
00:15:59,368 --> 00:16:01,169
Damn it. I'm screwed.

00:16:04,906 --> 00:16:06,008
Stop that.

443
00:16:07,075 --> 00:16:09,611
Stop trying to lower my guard.

Let's go!

448
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:21,723
All right, the dumbbell relay.

449
00:16:22,624 --> 00:16:23,625
Ready.

Six.

534
00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:28,476
Hey, hold on.

535
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:29,711
Is it your turn?

536
00:19:29,778 --> 00:19:30,879
Yes, it's my turn.

537
00:19:30,946 --> 00:19:32,180
What are you saying?

538
00:19:33,181 --> 00:19:35,450
The ranking keeps changing.

539
00:19:35,917 --> 00:19:37,385
WHAT?

540
00:19:37,986 --> 00:19:39,721
DINDIN CUTS IN LINE

541
00:19:40,121 --> 00:19:41,556
How is it your turn?

542
00:19:41,623 --> 00:19:42,691
"GROANING"

543
00:19:42,757 --> 00:19:44,960
Wait, what is it? What's wrong?

544
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:47,495
"WHAT IS THIS SITUATION?"

545
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:51,866
I think my number is
looking good right now.

546
00:19:51,933 --> 00:19:53,501
I'm going to try a bit harder.

547
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:55,170
I'll continue with low weight, high reps.

548
00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:56,938
I'll try my best to win first place,

549
00:19:57,005 --> 00:20:00,175
so that Jonathan doesn't win the keychain.

550
00:20:02,611 --> 00:20:04,980
-Eight. Nine.
-That's enough.

551
00:20:05,046 --> 00:20:08,250
Sixty. One. Two.

552
00:20:08,316 --> 00:20:10,485
<i>I'll try to do as many as I can.</i>

553
00:20:10,552 --> 00:20:12,487
I'll push myself to the limit.

554
00:20:12,554 --> 00:20:14,055
"THEY SUDDENLY SHOW THEIR AMBITIONS"

555
00:20:14,122 --> 00:20:15,657
The anchovy keychain is mine.

556
00:20:16,524 --> 00:20:18,860
And I'll get the gift next week.

557
00:20:21,863 --> 00:20:23,732
1ST PLACE: DINDIN
2ND PLACE: JONATHAN

558
00:20:23,798 --> 00:20:25,634
THE STANDING KEEPS CHANGING

559
00:20:26,134 --> 00:20:27,135
Six.

560
00:20:27,535 --> 00:20:28,536
He's here.

561
00:20:29,337 --> 00:20:30,338
Eight.

562
00:20:30,739 --> 00:20:31,840
THE INJURED MAN IS BACK

563
00:20:31,906 --> 00:20:33,275
Look at him.

564
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:36,544
He looks awful.

565
00:20:37,545 --> 00:20:39,247
Three. Four.

566
00:20:41,016 --> 00:20:43,418
You're also an anchovy. You are.

567
00:20:43,818 --> 00:20:45,153
-You're an anchovy.
-You came to say something.

568
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:48,456
"THE ANCHOVIES WELCOME THE INJURED MAN"

569
00:20:49,257 --> 00:20:51,893
Come on, man. The producer's back.
Is that important?

570
00:20:52,394 --> 00:20:53,962
You're terrible.

571
00:20:54,029 --> 00:20:56,197
You just do it. Just do it.

572
00:20:56,831 --> 00:20:59,167
Well, I know that he got injured.

573
00:20:59,768 --> 00:21:00,769
"NO KEYCHAIN AND NO MANNERS"

574
00:21:00,835 --> 00:21:02,704
I've got a thing to do. I can't help it.

575
00:21:03,338 --> 00:21:06,041
There are a lot of restrictions
in the world.

576
00:21:06,908 --> 00:21:08,076
Let's hurry.

577
00:21:08,543 --> 00:21:10,178
How long will it take to heal?

578
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:12,013
Four weeks at the least?

579
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,682
-Goodness.
-That's a whole month.

580
00:21:13,748 --> 00:21:15,250
-Rehab too?
-I have to rehab too.

581
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:17,185
-Rehab too?
-Man, it must be frustrating.

582
00:21:17,252 --> 00:21:19,254
You should've taken it easy.

583
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:21,756
Good, take your sweet time.

584
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:23,258
Enjoy your conversation!

585
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:26,094
Eight. Nine.

586
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:30,398
I swear, I won't live as Jonathan anymore.

587
00:21:30,465 --> 00:21:31,633
I'll become someone else.

588
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,336
<i>Someone who never compromises with anyone.</i>

589
00:21:34,402 --> 00:21:35,704
<i>Like a villain.</i>

590
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,539
<i>The craziest villain.</i>

591
00:21:38,139 --> 00:21:40,208
<i>One who doesn't have sympathy.</i>

592
00:21:40,842 --> 00:21:42,410
I'll go full dark mode.

593
00:21:42,911 --> 00:21:44,612
You mean you'll turn darker?

594
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:46,047
What do you mean by that?

595
00:21:46,114 --> 00:21:48,316
Oh, you mean I'm already dark enough?

596
00:21:48,383 --> 00:21:50,318
You must be out of your mind too.

597
00:21:50,385 --> 00:21:53,521
40 TONS COMPLETED!

598
00:21:53,588 --> 00:21:54,989
<i>Okay.</i>

599
00:21:55,056 --> 00:21:57,859
Everyone, in this game,
a deduction of 10 tons is on the line.

600
00:21:57,926 --> 00:21:59,661
It's called "Protein Omakase."

601
00:21:59,728 --> 00:22:01,329
-What? How do we play it?
-What's that?

602
00:22:01,396 --> 00:22:02,864
ALL 4 OF THEM MUST FINISH IT TO SUCCEED

603
00:22:02,931 --> 00:22:07,502
<i>In this game, you'll be given</i>
<i>a four-stack lunch box full of protein.</i>

604
00:22:07,569 --> 00:22:09,537
<i>The four of you will decide on the order</i>

605
00:22:09,604 --> 00:22:11,306
<i>and eat one stack each.</i>

606
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:13,174
What kind of protein could it be?

607
00:22:13,241 --> 00:22:15,543
-So we can't see what's inside?
-That's right.

608
00:22:16,978 --> 00:22:17,979
Hold on.

609
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:20,148
I think the protein must be bugs.

610
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:24,052
The protein must be bugs.

611
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:25,120
Bugs are protein.

612
00:22:25,186 --> 00:22:27,722
You know, earthworms are full of protein.

613
00:22:28,356 --> 00:22:30,091
-Bugs?
-That's too much.

614
00:22:30,158 --> 00:22:31,359
To make it clear,

615
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:33,395
you can't spit it out.

616
00:22:33,461 --> 00:22:35,864
-But this is…
-Swallow it?

617
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:38,066
This has nothing to do
with our physical camp.

618
00:22:38,133 --> 00:22:39,534
It does,
because it's about taking protein.

619
00:22:39,601 --> 00:22:40,602
-Protein?
-Yes, protein.

620
00:22:40,668 --> 00:22:42,137
But the problem is,

621
00:22:42,203 --> 00:22:44,139
if we fail to eat it,
we get another 10 tons.

622
00:22:44,205 --> 00:22:45,206
Exactly.

623
00:22:45,273 --> 00:22:47,709
All right. We'll go down from the top.

624
00:22:47,776 --> 00:22:48,977
One, two, three, four.

625
00:22:49,043 --> 00:22:50,712
-I'll take number one.
-Number one?

626
00:22:50,779 --> 00:22:51,913
-Okay, number one.
-I'll take

627
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,248
-number three.
-Number two.

628
00:22:53,314 --> 00:22:54,682
Automatically, I'll take number four.

629
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:56,117
Number four. All right.

630
00:22:56,184 --> 00:22:57,919
You can open number four first.

631
00:22:58,386 --> 00:22:59,921
Just open the last one first.

632
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:06,561
Damn it!

633
00:23:07,195 --> 00:23:09,230
-I knew it.
-What is that?

634
00:23:13,968 --> 00:23:15,804
-Mealworms?
-They're mealworms.

635
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:17,105
They're feed for hedgehogs.

636
00:23:17,172 --> 00:23:19,774
-But I'm not a hedgehog.
-They're dried.

637
00:23:19,841 --> 00:23:23,077
They contain twice as much iron as beef
and are full of digestive enzymes.

638
00:23:23,144 --> 00:23:25,880
They help your body
absorb protein effectively.

639
00:23:25,947 --> 00:23:27,515
Those are dried mealworms.

640
00:23:28,082 --> 00:23:29,884
-He must eat all of them?
-No, not all.

641
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:31,586
-You just need to eat 10.
-Ten?

642
00:23:31,653 --> 00:23:33,755
You guys are so scary.

643
00:23:34,489 --> 00:23:36,791
-Oh, no, you can see the legs.
-The legs.

644
00:23:36,858 --> 00:23:39,160
-Don't look so closely.
-They have legs.

645
00:23:39,227 --> 00:23:41,196
-One first, and use a spoon.
-Just one first.

646
00:23:41,262 --> 00:23:42,330
Close your eyes.

647
00:23:42,764 --> 00:23:44,065
Don't look.

648
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:45,667
Taste it with your eyes closed.

649
00:23:45,733 --> 00:23:47,168
It's just a stick.

650
00:23:48,603 --> 00:23:50,405
"I WON'T WATCH HIM"

651
00:23:55,109 --> 00:23:56,110
What?

652
00:23:56,578 --> 00:23:57,712
It could be quite good.

653
00:23:57,779 --> 00:23:59,214
-And savory.
-It's empty inside.

654
00:23:59,848 --> 00:24:01,583
-It's fine, then.
-There are no guts. It's empty.

655
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:03,585
That's good. Then eat them with a spoon.

656
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:06,488
This is more than 10 worms.

657
00:24:06,554 --> 00:24:07,922
It doesn't taste like a worm.

658
00:24:07,989 --> 00:24:09,390
You're so brave.

659
00:24:11,793 --> 00:24:14,362
It feels like I'm chewing rice hulls.

660
00:24:14,429 --> 00:24:15,563
That's right.

661
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:17,432
-All right. Daniel, success.
-Success!

662
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:19,701
Now, number three. Is it Jonathan?

663
00:24:19,767 --> 00:24:21,636
-Jonathan, please open it.
-Okay, I'll open it.

664
00:24:21,703 --> 00:24:22,704
"OPENING NUMBER TWO"

665
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:24,806
-Oh, my.
-What is it?

666
00:24:27,609 --> 00:24:29,310
"SHOCKED"

667
00:24:29,377 --> 00:24:31,045
-Did you see it?
-I can't eat that.

668
00:24:31,112 --> 00:24:32,580
-Wow.
-What is that?

669
00:24:32,647 --> 00:24:34,449
-What is that?
-What is this?

670
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,351
What is this?

671
00:24:36,417 --> 00:24:39,254
They contain as much protein
as chicken breast

672
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,657
and are rich in essential amino acids
and unsaturated fatty acids.

673
00:24:42,724 --> 00:24:44,359
CHUBBY DRIED SILKWORM PUPAE

674
00:24:44,826 --> 00:24:48,096
SPEECHLESS

675
00:24:49,998 --> 00:24:52,000
-You can't do it.
-Eat just one.

676
00:24:52,066 --> 00:24:53,434
-Just swallow it.
-Listen.

677
00:24:53,501 --> 00:24:54,869
-I'm so sorry.
-Just swallow it.

678
00:24:54,936 --> 00:24:57,739
You guys take a nap,
and I'll do 100,000 kg.

679
00:24:57,805 --> 00:24:59,107
-Just swallow it.
-I'm serious.

680
00:24:59,173 --> 00:25:00,808
I'm sorry, but I can't do it.

681
00:25:06,581 --> 00:25:08,483
They're so big. Look at them.

682
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,617
Could you show us?

683
00:25:10,118 --> 00:25:11,119
Look.

684
00:25:11,686 --> 00:25:12,787
-Wow.
-Wow.

685
00:25:12,854 --> 00:25:15,423
Seriously, it's bigger than my thumb.

686
00:25:17,058 --> 00:25:18,826
Come on, just swallow it.

687
00:25:19,327 --> 00:25:20,628
-The smaller ones might taste good.
-What the heck?

688
00:25:21,095 --> 00:25:22,096
"DRIP"

689
00:25:22,163 --> 00:25:24,265
What the heck? What was that?

690
00:25:24,332 --> 00:25:25,700
-What just dripped?
-Something dripped from it.

691
00:25:25,767 --> 00:25:26,868
What just dripped?

692
00:25:27,769 --> 00:25:29,771
-Something dripped from it.
-No, it's nothing.

693
00:25:29,837 --> 00:25:31,739
-It's juice.
-We bought frozen ones

694
00:25:31,806 --> 00:25:33,942
and boiled them with salt.

695
00:25:34,008 --> 00:25:35,076
It's just salted water.

696
00:25:35,143 --> 00:25:37,879
-Hey, mine was nothing.
-Yours was nothing.

697
00:25:38,446 --> 00:25:42,750
Hey, you came to Seoul from Gwangju
to do things like this.

698
00:25:42,817 --> 00:25:44,385
Now's the time.

699
00:25:44,452 --> 00:25:46,688
-Is this a dream come true?
-It's a dream come true.

700
00:25:47,889 --> 00:25:49,657
Jonathan, just swallow it. Don't chew it.

701
00:25:49,724 --> 00:25:51,626
Yes, this is just a sausage.

702
00:25:52,493 --> 00:25:54,696
-Yes, it's a sausage.
-This is a sausage.

703
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:55,863
"THESE ARE JUST SAUSAGES"

704
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,799
I'm living a life someone's dreaming of.

705
00:25:57,865 --> 00:26:00,335
That's right. So many people dream
of doing things like this.

706
00:26:00,401 --> 00:26:02,170
Yummy.

707
00:26:03,204 --> 00:26:05,573
-Is that feces?
-My goodness.

708
00:26:08,676 --> 00:26:11,546
-Just chew it without breathing.
-Okay, okay!

709
00:26:11,613 --> 00:26:13,581
But you guys distract me by talking to me.

710
00:26:13,648 --> 00:26:15,917
-All right.
-Say random things. Weird things.

711
00:26:15,984 --> 00:26:18,252
-And hit me or something.
-Okay.

712
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:19,320
-Okay.
-Just eat it!

713
00:26:19,387 --> 00:26:20,488
One, two, three!

714
00:26:20,555 --> 00:26:22,323
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

715
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,562
How about this? I'm a gangster.

716
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:29,430
-I'm a gangster!
-How does it taste?

717
00:26:29,497 --> 00:26:30,999
You look cool.

718
00:26:31,065 --> 00:26:33,067
-You've grown bigger.
-I'm a gangster.

719
00:26:33,134 --> 00:26:34,168
You look cool.

720
00:26:34,235 --> 00:26:36,504
-He looks fine.
-Wow, you look so cool.

721
00:26:36,571 --> 00:26:37,605
Swallow it.

722
00:26:37,672 --> 00:26:39,607
It looks like you're filming a commercial.

723
00:26:41,542 --> 00:26:43,311
<i>It burst in my mouth.</i>

724
00:26:43,378 --> 00:26:44,979
<i>As soon as it burst, I felt like…</i>

725
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,016
<i>I wanted to just grind my mouth.</i>

726
00:26:48,082 --> 00:26:51,185
I wanted to rip my mouth off,
including the gums.

727
00:26:54,722 --> 00:26:56,891
Anyway, Jonathan has succeeded.

728
00:26:56,958 --> 00:26:58,426
Wow, you're amazing.

729
00:26:59,694 --> 00:27:02,230
-It seems it's getting worse as we go.
-Next.

730
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,499
DinDin, we'll open number two.

731
00:27:04,565 --> 00:27:05,566
"OPENING THE FRIGHTENING NUMBER TWO"

732
00:27:07,902 --> 00:27:09,070
Lucky guy! What the…

733
00:27:09,137 --> 00:27:10,271
"BAD LANGUAGE"

734
00:27:10,338 --> 00:27:12,707
-What's that?
-What's that? Chili?

735
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:16,277
"STIR-FRIED GRASSHOPPERS"

736
00:27:16,344 --> 00:27:18,012
-They're grasshoppers.
-Oh, grasshoppers.

737
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:19,313
But why are they red?

738
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,549
-They were marinated.
-Oh, they were marinated.

739
00:27:21,616 --> 00:27:22,617
I'll explain.

740
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:25,353
They're rich in minerals
like iron, calcium, vitamins, and so on,

741
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,755
and are considered the new superfood.

742
00:27:27,822 --> 00:27:29,590
-They have eyes!
-They're stir-fried grasshoppers!

743
00:27:29,657 --> 00:27:31,993
We purchased this dish from Daerim-dong,

744
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,362
-where there are many Korean-Chinese.
-Oh, it's a dish?

745
00:27:34,429 --> 00:27:37,732
They're in fact known
for going well with beer.

746
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:39,167
-So I heard.
-Then give me beer.

747
00:27:39,801 --> 00:27:40,802
Have cola instead.

748
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:42,036
You must eat five.

749
00:27:42,103 --> 00:27:43,171
That many?

750
00:27:43,237 --> 00:27:46,641
We brought things that are
considered promising future foods.

751
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:48,009
The future looks so grim.

752
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:51,312
-Here, that's five.
-Okay, that's five.

753
00:27:51,379 --> 00:27:53,614
Give me some soda. I'll chew this.

754
00:27:55,616 --> 00:27:57,251
Let's give this a go.

755
00:28:04,192 --> 00:28:05,727
How is it? Is it tasty?

756
00:28:06,561 --> 00:28:07,829
I guess it's not too bad.

757
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:09,297
-It's a dish, after all.
-Right.

758
00:28:09,363 --> 00:28:11,265
-It must be seasoned.
-Goodness.

759
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:14,001
-How is it?
-He's still chewing.

760
00:28:14,068 --> 00:28:15,236
He's savoring it.

761
00:28:15,303 --> 00:28:17,338
The legs, claws,

762
00:28:17,805 --> 00:28:19,440
eyeballs, and things like that.

763
00:28:19,507 --> 00:28:21,242
It looks a bit spicy.

764
00:28:21,309 --> 00:28:23,311
When I first chewed it,

765
00:28:23,377 --> 00:28:24,846
I could see why they say it's good.

766
00:28:26,748 --> 00:28:28,015
-When I first--
-Gosh, the smell.

767
00:28:28,082 --> 00:28:29,784
You smell like fart. Goodness.

768
00:28:30,485 --> 00:28:32,086
It smells like grasshopper guts.

769
00:28:32,153 --> 00:28:34,388
Yes. At first, it's quite good.

770
00:28:34,455 --> 00:28:36,557
You'd see why they say it's tasty.

771
00:28:36,624 --> 00:28:38,793
Then I thought it'd be okay
if I drank beer right away.

772
00:28:39,494 --> 00:28:40,928
I think the pupa is the worst.

773
00:28:40,995 --> 00:28:42,196
I doubt it.

774
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:44,065
You doubt it?

775
00:28:45,199 --> 00:28:47,668
"WHAT?"

776
00:28:47,735 --> 00:28:49,270
Darn it. What could it be?

777
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:57,111
You can just open it without turning it.

778
00:29:00,248 --> 00:29:01,415
-What is this?
-Is it stinky tofu?

779
00:29:02,416 --> 00:29:03,885
-What is this?
-Is it stinky tofu?

780
00:29:04,385 --> 00:29:05,653
-What the hell?
-What is this?

781
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,921
-What is this?
-It's stinky tofu.

782
00:29:06,988 --> 00:29:09,357
The classic vegetable protein

783
00:29:09,423 --> 00:29:12,727
that's rich in ammonia
which improves your explosive power.

784
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:15,163
-It's stinky tofu.
-Oh, it's no joke.

785
00:29:15,229 --> 00:29:16,531
"DAMN IT…"

786
00:29:16,597 --> 00:29:17,598
Man…

787
00:29:19,734 --> 00:29:21,803
"SHOCKED"

788
00:29:21,869 --> 00:29:23,971
This is my first time smelling it.

789
00:29:24,038 --> 00:29:25,039
Man!

790
00:29:25,106 --> 00:29:27,141
"AS POWERFUL AS ITS REPUTATION"

791
00:29:27,208 --> 00:29:28,409
-What's this smell?
-Goodness.

792
00:29:28,476 --> 00:29:30,244
Gosh, it stinks so much!

793
00:29:33,314 --> 00:29:36,617
That was the worst stench
I'd smelled in my life.

794
00:29:36,684 --> 00:29:38,152
It really smelled rotten.

795
00:29:38,219 --> 00:29:41,355
If I had to eat stinky tofu,
I'd never have done it.

796
00:29:41,422 --> 00:29:42,623
Let me put it this way.

797
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:46,360
Between five billion won and stinky tofu,
I'd choose five billion.

798
00:29:47,061 --> 00:29:48,095
"THE STAFF: ?????"

799
00:29:48,162 --> 00:29:49,797
What do you mean?

800
00:29:50,298 --> 00:29:51,666
What are you talking about?

801
00:29:53,134 --> 00:29:55,970
Oh, gosh. Hey, eat it already!

802
00:29:56,037 --> 00:29:57,471
Come on, hurry up!

803
00:29:57,538 --> 00:29:59,240
Just a sec. I will, but…

804
00:29:59,307 --> 00:30:00,741
Hurry up. Even a fly flew away.

805
00:30:00,808 --> 00:30:02,143
The flies are gathering around it.

806
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:04,111
A FLY FLEW OVER AFTER SMELLING IT

807
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,715
HAND SHAKING

808
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:10,051
His hand's shaking.

809
00:30:13,521 --> 00:30:15,022
<i>Since 10,000 kg was on the line</i>

810
00:30:15,823 --> 00:30:17,525
<i>and it was the last one,</i>

811
00:30:17,992 --> 00:30:20,394
<i>I thought I had to endure it</i>
<i>no matter what.</i>

812
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:23,097
O3OHN, PLEASE…

813
00:30:23,598 --> 00:30:25,600
IF I EAT THIS, 10 TONS WILL GET DEDUCTED

814
00:30:27,168 --> 00:30:29,270
-Right, it's still food.
-It is.

815
00:30:29,337 --> 00:30:30,638
It's food and protein.

816
00:30:30,705 --> 00:30:32,406
Stop talking and eat it!

817
00:30:32,974 --> 00:30:34,041
I'll eat it.

818
00:30:34,609 --> 00:30:36,510
Man, it stinks!

819
00:30:40,381 --> 00:30:42,049
Goodness. Oh, no.

820
00:30:42,116 --> 00:30:43,117
I can't watch this.

821
00:30:43,584 --> 00:30:45,086
<i>I barely endured it once.</i>

822
00:30:46,487 --> 00:30:47,788
<i>Then I felt the smell again.</i>

823
00:30:48,589 --> 00:30:50,358
<i>Gosh, it was seriously…</i>

824
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:52,393
He's speechless.

825
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,629
Close it, please. O3ohn, close it.

826
00:30:54,695 --> 00:30:56,497
Goodness! The stench doesn't go away.

827
00:30:56,564 --> 00:30:57,565
Hold on.

828
00:30:58,065 --> 00:30:59,166
Gosh!

829
00:31:00,501 --> 00:31:02,336
It was an unforgettable experience.

830
00:31:05,506 --> 00:31:07,742
All right, everyone,
10 tons will be deducted.

831
00:31:09,343 --> 00:31:11,979
-Then we have 58 tons left.
-Really?

832
00:31:12,046 --> 00:31:13,848
-Right?
-Yes, 58 tons left.

833
00:31:13,915 --> 00:31:15,483
Hey, blow your breath at me.

834
00:31:15,549 --> 00:31:16,651
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

835
00:31:17,952 --> 00:31:19,220
Gosh!

836
00:31:19,287 --> 00:31:21,088
-Hey! Damn it!
-It really stinks.

837
00:31:21,155 --> 00:31:22,890
-Gosh!
-It really stinks.

838
