00:00:01,444 --> 00:00:04,247
6 P.M.
5 HOURS INTO GOING HOME ON FOOT

2
00:00:04,313 --> 00:00:06,182
-There's a convenience store.
-It's a convenience store.

3
00:00:06,249 --> 00:00:09,986
AN EARLY DINNER

4
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:14,590
You know, this almost feels like

5
00:00:15,258 --> 00:00:17,493
having <i>ramyeon</i>
after marching in the military.

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,028
This is so good.

7
00:00:19,495 --> 00:00:20,763
I ate so much.

8
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,999
-Maybe too much.
-We lost control.

9
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:25,935
6:30 P.M.
EVERYONE IS RECHARGED

10
00:00:26,002 --> 00:00:28,037
Two, four, six, eight.

11
00:00:28,538 --> 00:00:30,773
Ten, twelve, fourteen, sixteen, eighteen.

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,841
Okay.

13
00:00:33,776 --> 00:00:35,645
What? We're playing a game?

14
00:00:35,711 --> 00:00:36,712
What on earth?

15
00:00:36,779 --> 00:00:38,948
This game will test your predictive power.

16
00:00:39,015 --> 00:00:40,483
It's called
"Win Rock Paper Scissors Three Times."

17
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,152
It took the other team an hour
to pass this earlier.

18
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:44,520
Rock, paper, scissors!

19
00:00:44,587 --> 00:00:46,089
Seriously, why is this happening?

20
00:00:46,155 --> 00:00:49,792
THEY FELT SO BETRAYED
BY THE MISCHIEVOUS CITIZENS

21
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:51,694
Those people were so bad.

22
00:00:51,761 --> 00:00:54,797
I told them I'd play scissors,
but they'd counter it and play rock.

23
00:00:55,731 --> 00:00:58,267
I think it'd be better to play
without telling them.

24
00:00:58,334 --> 00:01:01,237
So he told me
we should play fair and square.

25
00:01:01,304 --> 00:01:03,406
-But that might've been a lie.
-Exactly.

26
00:01:03,473 --> 00:01:05,241
DINDIN HAS ZERO CREDIBILITY

27
00:01:05,308 --> 00:01:08,277
WIN ROCK PAPER SCISSORS 3 TIMES
(BEAT 3 CITIZENS IN A ROW)

28
00:01:08,344 --> 00:01:10,680
Who do you want to ask to play with us?

29
00:01:10,746 --> 00:01:11,747
There are people coming out.

30
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:14,550
-Hello.
-Hello.

31
00:01:14,617 --> 00:01:16,085
If you don't mind…

32
00:01:16,152 --> 00:01:18,187
-Yes?
-It won't take long, about three minutes.

33
00:01:18,254 --> 00:01:19,555
Thank you.

34
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:20,723
Thank you so much.

35
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,625
It's nothing special.

36
00:01:22,692 --> 00:01:24,894
-It's just rock, paper, scissors.
-Just rock, paper, scissors.

37
00:01:24,961 --> 00:01:27,997
But before we play,

38
00:01:28,464 --> 00:01:32,201
can you tell us which one is your favorite
among rock, paper, and scissors?

39
00:01:32,268 --> 00:01:34,504
-A man should play rock.
-Right, rock.

40
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:36,105
-Rock for me too.
-Rock?

41
00:01:36,172 --> 00:01:37,940
I'll play scissors.

42
00:01:38,007 --> 00:01:39,008
Scissors?

43
00:01:39,075 --> 00:01:40,743
You two like rock,

44
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,245
and you like scissors.

45
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:44,347
All right. We'll play now.

46
00:01:44,413 --> 00:01:46,149
You said you like rock.

47
00:01:46,215 --> 00:01:47,483
You like rock too.

48
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,851
And you like scissors.

49
00:01:48,918 --> 00:01:50,153
I got it.

50
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,021
All right. Let's go.

51
00:01:52,488 --> 00:01:53,856
-Am I going first?
-Yes.

52
00:01:53,923 --> 00:01:54,991
Rock, paper, scissors!

53
00:02:00,696 --> 00:02:03,432
I told them I'd play scissors,
but they'd counter it and play rock.

54
00:02:05,301 --> 00:02:06,402
I played as I would.

55
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:08,538
"A MISCHIEVOUS CITIZEN
THEY'D HEARD OF"

56
00:02:09,005 --> 00:02:11,140
How could you do that? Come on.

57
00:02:11,607 --> 00:02:13,242
-I'm a big fan.
-I see.

58
00:02:13,309 --> 00:02:15,444
-You'll stay there, right?
-No.

59
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:16,546
I'll run away now.

60
00:02:18,481 --> 00:02:19,482
All right.

61
00:02:19,549 --> 00:02:21,651
Now you have to wait 10 minutes here.

62
00:02:21,717 --> 00:02:22,718
THE FIRST ATTEMPT FAILS

63
00:02:22,785 --> 00:02:24,353
<i>So DinDin was telling the truth.</i>

64
00:02:25,054 --> 00:02:26,756
We have to pick someone honest,

65
00:02:26,822 --> 00:02:27,990
not mischievous,

66
00:02:28,057 --> 00:02:29,358
and mild-mannered.

67
00:02:29,425 --> 00:02:31,761
Anyway, we have to wait
10 minutes to play again.

68
00:02:36,899 --> 00:02:38,467
Why do you keep holding my hand?

69
00:02:38,534 --> 00:02:40,369
-Because it's uncomfortable.
-It's not.

70
00:02:40,436 --> 00:02:42,171
-This is more uncomfortable.
-Then do this.

71
00:02:42,238 --> 00:02:44,373
"LOCKING HIS ARM IN HIS ARMPIT"

72
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,608
I hate this!

73
00:02:45,675 --> 00:02:47,109
Hold on, it's sticky. Damn it.

74
00:02:47,176 --> 00:02:48,744
Hold on, it's sticky. Damn it.

75
00:02:50,012 --> 00:02:51,581
It's so sticky in your pits.

76
00:02:52,181 --> 00:02:53,649
-I hate it.
-All right.

77
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:55,585
You're just disgusting.

78
00:02:55,651 --> 00:02:57,320
A MOMENT AGO

79
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,288
Come on!

80
00:02:59,355 --> 00:03:01,691
"HE KEEPS
SHARING HIS ARMPIT SWEAT"

81
00:03:01,757 --> 00:03:03,292
It's all wet here.

82
00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:04,360
-Hey.
-Damn it.

83
00:03:04,427 --> 00:03:07,496
You're going to be wet one way or another.

84
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:08,998
-It's the same.
-It's different!

85
00:03:09,065 --> 00:03:11,300
Why do I have to get wet
with your armpit sweat?

86
00:03:11,367 --> 00:03:12,768
It's so dirty, seriously.

87
00:03:12,835 --> 00:03:14,337
-I hate it.
-All right.

88
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,839
We should be playing
rock paper scissors, not this.

89
00:03:16,906 --> 00:03:20,209
Even if we find someone to play with,
we'll have to wait four more minutes.

90
00:03:20,276 --> 00:03:21,277
LET'S LOOK FOR A CIVILIAN
IN THE MEANTIME

91
00:03:21,344 --> 00:03:23,312
<i>We've got to leave out</i>
<i>anyone who looks mischievous.</i>

92
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:25,281
THEY SEE MALE STUDENTS
FROM A DISTANCE

93
00:03:25,348 --> 00:03:26,415
No, they're no good.

94
00:03:26,482 --> 00:03:27,717
They're no good?

95
00:03:27,783 --> 00:03:28,985
The one with a kid…

96

NOT MISCHIEVOUS, AND KIND"

98

Are you busy right now?

99
00:03:34,624 --> 00:03:35,891
Could we talk to you briefly?

100
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,560
-Sure.
-Is that okay?

101
00:03:37,627 --> 00:03:38,694
Let me ask you something.

102
00:03:38,761 --> 00:03:42,265
Which one is your favorite
among rock, paper, and scissors?

103
00:03:42,331 --> 00:03:43,933
-Rock?
-You like rock?

104
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,803
O3OHN, SHE LIKES ROCK

105
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:51,540
A CHILD WHO LOOKS INNOCENT
AND UNTAINTED

106
00:03:52,008 --> 00:03:53,342
Rock, paper, scissors!

107
00:03:56,145 --> 00:03:58,748
THEY FORGOT THAT THE
MOST MISCHIEVOUS ONES IN KOREA

108
00:03:59,215 --> 00:04:01,784
WERE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STUDENTS

109
00:04:01,851 --> 00:04:02,852
Come on!

110
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:07,990
Hold on. You said you liked rock.

111
00:04:08,057 --> 00:04:09,058
I'm sorry.

112
00:04:10,826 --> 00:04:11,994
I'm sorry.

113
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:14,563
No, sorry doesn't cut it.

114
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,232
Didn't you say you liked rock?

115
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,901
I can't believe this.

116
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:20,002
I trusted you.

117
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:21,170
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:04:22,104 --> 00:04:23,406
Thank you.

00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:25,107
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

120
00:04:25,174 --> 00:04:27,977
Seriously, why do they all lie?

121
00:04:28,044 --> 00:04:30,780
I'm starting to lose
my love for humanity right now.

122
00:04:30,846 --> 00:04:32,682
She looked so innocent.

123
00:04:33,149 --> 00:04:35,284
SINCE THEY TRUSTED HER

124
00:04:35,818 --> 00:04:39,021

-Yes!
-Thank you!

179
00:06:36,739 --> 00:06:38,374
-Yes!
-Thank you!

180
00:06:38,441 --> 00:06:39,875
-Thank you!
-Thank you so much!

181
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:42,077
ENDLESS THANKS

182
00:06:42,144 --> 00:06:44,647
THEY SUCCEED IN WINNING ROCK
PAPER SCISSORS 3 TIMES IN A ROW

183
00:06:44,713 --> 00:06:47,349
-I think we're ahead of them so far.
-Yeah.

184
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,385
They probably haven't done
the bug hunting yet.

185
00:06:49,452 --> 00:06:50,753
-Okay.
-Bug hunting?

186
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,021
We can just catch that.

187
00:06:52,588 --> 00:06:54,123
"RIGHT THEN,
THEY START BUG HUNTING"

188
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,991
Oh, no, I'm scared of them.

189
00:06:56,058 --> 00:06:58,394
<i>There's no time limit.</i>
<i>You must catch three bugs.</i>

190
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,101
-I caught one.
-Yes, you did.

191
00:07:06,168 --> 00:07:07,970
We must also catch at least one cicada.

192
00:07:08,037 --> 00:07:09,238
You've never caught a cicada?

193
00:07:09,305 --> 00:07:10,973
No, never. Are they catchable?

194
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,508
You can just catch them like this.

195
00:07:16,212 --> 00:07:18,814
I can hear them, but I don't see them.

196
00:07:18,881 --> 00:07:20,449
DinDin, come here for a second.

197
00:07:21,584 --> 00:07:22,585
Amazing.

198
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:25,521
"DID THEY FIND A CICADA?"

199
00:07:25,588 --> 00:07:27,189
DinDin. DinDin!

200
00:07:27,256 --> 00:07:30,426
DinDin, it'll kill you. It'll bite you!

201
00:07:30,493 --> 00:07:31,894
It'll bite!

202
00:07:31,961 --> 00:07:34,129
"IT'S A CICADA'S MOLT SHELL"

203
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:38,000
It'll bite! No!

204
00:07:38,067 --> 00:07:40,269
Don't! Stop it, seriously!

205
00:07:40,336 --> 00:07:41,670
It'll bite. Stop it.

206
00:07:41,737 --> 00:07:42,905
No! Stop it!

207
00:07:42,972 --> 00:07:45,274
It'll bite. Stop it. Seriously.

208
00:07:45,341 --> 00:07:46,809
Stop it. Seriously.

209
00:07:46,876 --> 00:07:48,844
I mean it. Stop it, DinDin.

210
00:07:48,911 --> 00:07:50,012
"A STRAIGHT FACE"

211
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,113
I said stop!

212
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,815
Seriously, DinDin. It'll bite.

213
00:07:52,882 --> 00:07:55,351
Hey, I said to stop it. I mean it.

214
00:07:55,417 --> 00:07:56,952
DinDin, stop it, seriously.

215
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:58,287
-Please.
-All right.

216
00:07:58,354 --> 00:08:00,189
Untie this, just for a minute.

217
00:08:00,256 --> 00:08:02,091
"SCREAMING"

218
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,796
Don't do that ever again. I mean it.

219
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:08,864
"A STRAIGHT FACE"

220
00:08:09,665 --> 00:08:11,600
-Gosh.
-All right.

221
00:08:12,134 --> 00:08:13,802
But we have to catch one.

222
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:16,071
We have no choice. We must catch one.

223
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:17,907
Jonathan, we need to…

224
00:08:19,642 --> 00:08:21,243
<i>He was about to beat me up.</i>

225
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,913
<i>I hadn't seen</i>
<i>such a murderous look in a while.</i>

226
00:08:25,247 --> 00:08:27,583
Jonathan, we need to catch a cicada.

227
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,485
STIFLING A LAUGH

228
00:08:29,552 --> 00:08:31,754
SIGHING

229
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,756
-Wait, Jonathan, over there.
-Where is it?

230
00:08:33,822 --> 00:08:35,124
Do you see that?

231
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,559
-What is it?
-I can't reach it.

232
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:38,427
Up there. Can you see it? It's a cicada.

233
00:08:38,494 --> 00:08:39,962
Hey, we can catch it.

234
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:41,564
-You can catch it with this.
-Yeah.

235
00:08:44,967 --> 00:08:46,068
Catch it.

236
00:08:46,135 --> 00:08:47,469
Catch it, DinDin.

237
00:08:47,536 --> 00:08:48,571
Catch it.

238
00:08:48,637 --> 00:08:49,838
Catch it, DinDin.

239
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:54,243
Oh, no, it fell!

240
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:57,913
"JONATHAN IS SO SCARED!"

241
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,815
Put me down!

242
00:08:59,882 --> 00:09:01,183
-Put me down.
-Sorry.

243
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,621
Where did it go?

244
00:09:05,688 --> 00:09:07,656
Hey, move aside. Producer, move!

245
00:09:07,723 --> 00:09:09,925
FORTUNATELY, IT HASN'T GONE FAR

246
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,194
CLOSE TO CRYING

247
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:15,264
-Oh!
-Look.

248
00:09:15,331 --> 00:09:16,665
It's alive, right?

249
00:09:16,732 --> 00:09:18,233
-I'll let it go now.
-Okay. Success!

"THE STAFF MEMBER SCREAMING"

251
00:09:22,671 --> 00:09:23,939
It flew away.

00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,577
"LAUGHING"

253
00:09:28,644 --> 00:09:30,813
Gosh, he's as much of an anchovy as us.

"WE'RE A TEAM"

255
00:09:32,581 --> 00:09:33,882
How can he be scared of insects?

256
00:09:34,683 --> 00:09:37,620
-Here, I got an ant.
-Okay!

257
00:09:37,686 --> 00:09:38,821
DINDIN / JONATHAN,
DANIEL / O3OHN

258
00:09:38,887 --> 00:09:41,090
6 HOURS
INTO WALKING BY THE HAN RIVER

259
00:09:41,156 --> 00:09:42,758
I wonder where we are.

260
00:09:43,425 --> 00:09:44,927
We're probably by the Yanghwa Bridge.

261
00:09:45,561 --> 00:09:48,364
YANGHWA BRIDGE
TO DANGSAN RAILWAY BRIDGE

262
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,399
TO YEOUIDO

263
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:51,867
WEST FROM YEOUIDO
3 KM

264
00:09:51,934 --> 00:09:54,236
We can cross the bridge
if we go four more kilometers.

265
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:56,672
The staff said
we'd be crossing the Banpo Bridge.

266
00:09:58,907 --> 00:10:00,409
LAUGHING

267
00:10:00,476 --> 00:10:04,313
HE CAN'T HELP BUT LAUGH
FOR SOME REASON

268
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,348
I guess Daniel really is exhausted.

269
00:10:07,182 --> 00:10:08,717
He's stopped talking about his life.

270
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:13,389
Getting rained on near Han River
reminds me of this.

271
00:10:13,455 --> 00:10:14,790
When I was 20,

272
00:10:14,857 --> 00:10:18,994
I biked to the Han River park
with my friends on a rainy day.

273
00:10:19,061 --> 00:10:20,562
With my girlfriend at that time.

274
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:22,464
I used to shadow box a lot with myself

275
00:10:22,531 --> 00:10:23,766
when I was in middle school.

276
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:27,403
Gosh, I've never been constipated
in my life except for this one time.

277
00:10:27,469 --> 00:10:30,706
It was when I was in elementary school.

278
00:10:30,773 --> 00:10:33,409
-Wow, this is seriously…
-Yeah?

279
00:10:33,942 --> 00:10:34,943
It's really exhausting.

280
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,413
It's not easy at all
to walk to Gwanghwamun.

281
00:10:37,479 --> 00:10:40,015
-And our hands are tied at that.
-Right.

"SHOULDERS FEEL STIFF TOO"

283
00:10:44,053 --> 00:10:46,155
And my feet feel so uncomfortable now.

284
00:10:46,622 --> 00:10:47,723
It's driving me crazy.

285
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:51,160
-We're all exhausted because of the rain.
-Right.

286
00:10:51,226 --> 00:10:53,228
I got inner thigh chafing.

287
00:10:53,295 --> 00:10:54,296
Chafing?

288
00:10:54,797 --> 00:10:56,699
Ask the medical team
if there's anything for that.

289
00:10:56,765 --> 00:10:59,535
"LIMPING"

290
00:10:59,601 --> 00:11:01,003

-Listen.
<i>-Yeah?</i>

294
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:08,577
Some of the staff have fallen.

295
00:11:08,644 --> 00:11:10,145
Who is this episode for?

296
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:12,114
It's for the viewers.

297
00:11:12,181 --> 00:11:13,315
I see.

298
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:14,650
What can we say to that?

299
00:11:15,317 --> 00:11:16,652
-Okay.
-Okay.

300
00:11:16,719 --> 00:11:21,757
THE SUN HAS SET IN THE MEANTIME

301
00:11:21,824 --> 00:11:23,959
7 HOURS INTO GOING HOME ON FOOT

302
00:11:24,026 --> 00:11:25,127
Is that it?

303
00:11:25,694 --> 00:11:27,196
-The Jamsu Bridge.
-That's it.

304
00:11:27,262 --> 00:11:29,531
-That's the one we crossed, right?
-Yes.

305
00:11:29,598 --> 00:11:31,600
DINDIN AND JONATHAN
AT YEOUIDO HAN RIVER PARK

306
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:32,668
Gosh, my legs hurt.

307
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,104
This game will test your teamwork.

308
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,171
Teamwork?

309
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:38,841
It's called "Multi-relay of Four."

310
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:39,908
But we're two people.

311
00:11:39,975 --> 00:11:41,944
You'll play with Daniel and O3ohn.

312
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,946
We're not at the same place
but playing together.

313
00:11:44,012 --> 00:11:45,914
-We'll play at the same time.
-I see.

314
00:11:45,981 --> 00:11:48,183
Daniel, you'll play
the coin-flipping game.

315
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,420
O3ohn, you'll have to hold in burps
for 10 seconds after drinking soda.

316
00:11:51,487 --> 00:11:54,256
Jonathan, you'll have to
split an apple in half.

317
00:11:54,323 --> 00:11:57,159
And DinDin, you'll clap your feet
100 times in 30 seconds.

318
00:11:57,226 --> 00:11:59,194
Gosh, it's no joke.

319
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:01,263
THE VIRILITY TEST DANIEL TRIED
IN EPISODE 5

320
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:05,501
DINDIN, WHO MOCKED HIM,
TRIES IT THIS TIME

321
00:12:05,567 --> 00:12:08,403
<i>All four of you</i>
<i>must pass the games in one go,</i>

322
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,472
<i>or neither team will cross the bridges.</i>

323
00:12:10,539 --> 00:12:12,307
We'll all root for both teams,

324
00:12:12,374 --> 00:12:13,542
since we want to go home.

325
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:15,110
"WHETHER THE STAFF CAN GO
HOME OR NOT

DEPENDS ON THE ANCHOVIES"

327
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:18,847
You'll do the feet clapping on the ground.

328
00:12:18,914 --> 00:12:19,915
I'll do it on the bench.

329
00:12:19,982 --> 00:12:21,383
It's easier to do on the ground.

330
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,185
"THEY'VE NEVER BEEN
THIS CONSIDERATE"

331
00:12:23,252 --> 00:12:24,753
Yes, the apple break is ready.

All right.
Everything's ready here as well.

-Ready…

00:12:31,794 --> 00:12:33,428
-Like this. Yes.
-Go!

336
00:12:39,668 --> 00:12:40,736
Split it.

337
00:12:40,803 --> 00:12:42,471
Split it. Is he splitting it?

338
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:46,742
Okay! Jonathan succeeds!

339
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:47,810
Wow.

00:20:20,862 --> 00:20:22,464

00:20:26,034 --> 00:20:27,235
Oh, okay.

541
00:20:27,302 --> 00:20:29,104
You just need to go straight,

542
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:31,239
-and you'll reach the destination.
-Okay.

543
00:20:31,306 --> 00:20:33,008
Now will we take the subway?

544
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:37,279
-That'd be so nice.
-We're right in front of Gongdeok Station.

The hill here is so hellish.

549
00:20:48,256 --> 00:20:50,525
The uphill climb begins now.

550
00:20:50,592 --> 00:20:54,062
Our feet will hurt
since it's uphill from here.

551
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:55,597
I'm so scared.

552
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:58,700
Unbelievable. Namsan is so close now.

553
00:20:59,501 --> 00:21:01,569

It's tougher for them today
because of their stuff.

CHILLY SILENCE

711
00:27:11,706 --> 00:27:13,074
HMM…

712
00:27:15,209 --> 00:27:16,277
Listen.

713
00:27:17,045 --> 00:27:19,514
Is there anyone who wants to do it
instead of Jonathan?

714
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,648
As you know,

715
00:27:21,182 --> 00:27:23,217
I used to be the King of <i>ddakji</i>
back in the day.

716
00:27:23,284 --> 00:27:25,053
Shut your mouth!

717
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:26,220
I'm so sick of it.

718
00:27:26,287 --> 00:27:29,390
You failed at the coin-flipping.
Who drops a coin at a three-coin game?

719
00:27:29,824 --> 00:27:32,460
I thought it was
an eight-coin game or something.

720
00:27:32,527 --> 00:27:33,561
Gosh…

721
00:27:33,628 --> 00:27:35,830
All right, everyone. How about this?

722
00:27:35,897 --> 00:27:37,398
To the one that flips it over,

723
00:27:37,999 --> 00:27:39,967
we'll give the anchovy key chain.

724
00:27:40,668 --> 00:27:42,437
"GETTING UP
AT THE UNEXPECTED REWARD"

725
00:27:42,937 --> 00:27:43,938
I'll do it!

726
00:27:44,005 --> 00:27:46,174
Wait. He's the only one who hasn't won it.

727
00:27:46,641 --> 00:27:48,543
-Then you try it first.
-I'll do it first.

728
00:27:48,609 --> 00:27:49,744
-Yes.
-I'll give you an advantage.

729
00:27:50,244 --> 00:27:51,679
Then I'll do it after Jonathan.

730
00:27:52,447 --> 00:27:53,848
Let's do rock, paper, scissors.

731
00:27:53,915 --> 00:27:55,016
-Just do it in this order.
-No.

732
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:57,151
-He's unbelievable.
-Let's do rock, paper, scissors.

733
00:27:57,218 --> 00:27:59,287
-Rock, paper, scissors!
-Scissors!

734
00:27:59,353 --> 00:28:01,122
THE ORDER:
JONATHAN, O3OHN, DANIEL, DINDIN

735
00:28:01,189 --> 00:28:03,124
The anchovy key chain is mine!

736
00:28:03,191 --> 00:28:04,525
-Let's go.
-Here I go!

737
00:28:04,592 --> 00:28:06,828
-Just do it at once so we can go home.
-You flip it over.

738
00:28:06,894 --> 00:28:09,063
Let's finish it and go home. Be calm.

739
00:28:13,534 --> 00:28:15,737
-Darn it. For goodness' sake!
-Next!

740
00:28:15,803 --> 00:28:16,904
-Next.
-Make it quick.

741
00:28:16,971 --> 00:28:18,439
Okay, let's make it quick.

742
00:28:20,141 --> 00:28:21,709
JUST FLIP IT OVER!

743
00:28:23,177 --> 00:28:24,178
O3OHN FAILS

744
00:28:24,245 --> 00:28:25,480
-Damn it!
-Okay!

745
00:28:25,947 --> 00:28:28,416
-Okay, the King of <i>ddakji.</i>
-It's not easy.

746
00:28:33,721 --> 00:28:35,823
"DANIEL FAILS"

747
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:37,391
We'll have another round at this rate.

748
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:39,761
All right, get ready to go home.

749
00:28:39,827 --> 00:28:41,662
-Please!
-Let's go home.

750
00:28:41,729 --> 00:28:42,830
Let's go home, seriously.

751
00:28:42,897 --> 00:28:43,931
Here I go.

752
00:28:43,998 --> 00:28:45,366
Just flip it over and finish it.

753
00:28:46,134 --> 00:28:47,502
IT FLIES!

754
00:28:54,809 --> 00:28:57,311
DINDIN SUCCEEDS!

755
00:28:57,979 --> 00:28:59,413
WE'RE GOING HOME!

756
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,882
My key chain!

757
00:29:01,883 --> 00:29:03,618
Yes!

758
00:29:03,684 --> 00:29:05,119
"THE FIFTH TRAINING'S MVP
IS DINDIN"

759
00:29:05,186 --> 00:29:08,055
I worked so hard to get here,
but no key chain again.

760
00:29:08,689 --> 00:29:09,857
I quit!

761
00:29:10,725 --> 00:29:12,693
There's no hope. I give up!

762
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,828
I'll quit the show.

763
00:29:13,895 --> 00:29:14,896
All right, everyone.

764
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:17,031
Let's go home now.

765
00:29:17,098 --> 00:29:19,534
-Good work, everyone.
-Good work.

766
00:29:20,168 --> 00:29:21,636
Why can't I do it?

767
00:29:21,702 --> 00:29:22,937
Seriously…

768
00:29:28,576 --> 00:29:30,044
Give me a key chain.

769
00:29:30,878 --> 00:29:32,413
Minhyeok, your back doesn't hurt anymore,

770
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,881
-does it?
-It's fine.

771
00:29:33,948 --> 00:29:35,416
"HIS BACK DOESN'T HURT
AS IT'S OVER"

772
00:29:35,483 --> 00:29:37,018
I'll never ring the bell.

773
00:29:37,084 --> 00:29:38,286
I'll never ring it.

774
00:29:38,352 --> 00:29:39,420
Never. I mean it.

775
00:29:39,487 --> 00:29:40,721
Not ever.
