1
00:00:01,768 --> 00:00:04,904
<i>Anchovy Physical Camp trainees, welcome.</i>

2
00:00:04,971 --> 00:00:06,840
THE SOLE PURPOSE

3
00:00:06,906 --> 00:00:09,275
OF THIS JOURNEY WAS
TO WIN ANCHOVY KEYCHAINS

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,580
WHEN THEY THOUGHT
THEY COULDN'T DO IT ANYMORE

5
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:19,953
THE ONLY THING THAT KEPT THEM GOING WAS

6
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,722
THE ANCHOVY KEYCHAIN

7
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:24,324
I really need the keychain.

8
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:25,392
When I won the keychain.

9
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:29,629
THEY HAVE BEEN SERIOUS ABOUT THE KEYCHAIN
FOR THE PAST 5 MONTHS

10
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:36,069
THE DAYS THEY HAVE STRIVED
TO WIN 3 KEYCHAINS

11
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:41,374
DANIEL: 1, DINDIN: 2
O3OHN: 2, JONATHAN: 2

12
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:44,477
WHO WILL WIN THE LAST KEYCHAIN?

13
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:49,049
It's suddenly become so cold.
Why is it so cold?

14
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:51,284
This place brings back fond memories.

15
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:55,321
But why did you guys come all the way
to my neighborhood today?

16
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,424
Because something unfortunate happened,

17
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,660
we had no choice but to come to
your neighborhood so early in the morning.

18
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,362
Something unfortunate?

19
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:04,130
Something unfortunate? What happened?

20
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:06,599
Before I tell you what happened in detail,

21
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,835
you should see the video evidence.

22
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:10,370
What's this punk doing?

23
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,372
What is this? It's O3ohn.

24
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:16,676
O3OHN IS IN THE VIDEO?

25
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,912
They didn't even turn on the computer.

26
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:21,314
O3OHN IS PROWLING THE MEETING ROOM
IN THE VIDEO

27
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:24,884
What is he doing alone in the office
when no one's around?

28
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:26,419
What's he doing?

29
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:29,022
What's O3ohn doing there alone?

30
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,490
Why is he there?

31
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:34,327
AN HOUR BEFORE FILMING

32
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:39,065
I just entered
the Anchovy Camp headquarters.

33
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,468
I came to rob it.

34
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,904
Gosh, no one's come to work yet.

35
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:49,542
I hurt my back recently,
so I'm at a disadvantage right now.

36
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,113
<i>-We heard you'd gotten hurt.</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

37
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:55,348
<i>Do you have trouble walking now?</i>

38
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:56,850
<i>Yes, a bit.</i>

39
00:01:56,916 --> 00:02:00,220
<i>I'll have to wait until tomorrow morning</i>
<i>to see how serious it is.</i>

40
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,421
<i>Right.</i>

41
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:03,556
<i>"If you can't get it, steal it."</i>

42
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,892
<i>That's the wisdom from our ancestors,</i>
<i>isn't it?</i>

43
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,594
<i>So I came to steal it today.</i>

44
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:12,899
O3OHN, THE ONE CRAZY ABOUT ANCHOVIES

45
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,668
I'm taking this. Don't chase me.

46
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,507
A giant anchovy…
What on earth is he doing?

47
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:24,310
But why does him stealing something
look so natural?

48
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:26,746
A TYPICAL FACE OF A THIEF

49
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,615
All right. Today's mission is…

50
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:32,952
"The Disappearance of O3ohn and Anchovy."

51
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:36,256
From now on, you must chase,

52
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,724
<i>find the fugitive O3ohn,</i>

53
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,126
<i>and obtain the Golden Anchovy.</i>

54
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:44,831
The one who has it in their possession
when the sun sets at 5:38 p.m.

55
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:48,034
will be given the Golden Anchovy.

56
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:51,671
<i>If you fail to take it from him</i>
<i>until then,</i>

57
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:54,174
<i>O3ohn will be the winner</i>
<i>of the Golden Anchovy.</i>

58
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,543
<i>As for your expenses while chasing,</i>

59
00:02:56,609 --> 00:03:00,313
<i>just like last time, you must exercise</i>
<i>to earn money to spend.</i>

60
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,316
<i>And you can only take a bus or a cab.</i>

61
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,818
The fugitive can only move

62
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:09,822
<i>within Mapo-gu, Seodaemun-gu,</i>
<i>Jongno-gu, Jung-gu, and Yongsan-gu.</i>

63
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:11,591
<i>Only these five.</i>

64
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:14,627
Now, you pursuers will be at a loss
to find O3ohn

65
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,896
in the middle of Seoul, right?

66
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:19,933
Of course. It's not even "dong."
It's "gu."

67
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:22,068
There are pursuer chances for you.

68
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:25,972
From the lowest grade to the highest,

69
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,774
there are six chances.

70
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,509
And I have to pay for it?

71
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:30,743
-Correct.
-Geez.

72
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:34,681
<i>You can buy the chances anytime</i>
<i>with the money you earn by exercising.</i>

73
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:38,084
<i>And the details of the chance</i>
<i>will be revealed after you buy it.</i>

74
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:39,152
PRICES OF THE CHANCES

75
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,655
Today's mission is
"The Disappearance of O3ohn and Anchovy."

76
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,692
The fugitive can only move by bus

77
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:49,963
and must use his personal credit card
or cash for expenses.

78
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:52,765
I can only take the bus?

79
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,069
To prevent you
from communicating with the pursuers,

80
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:58,871
we will confiscate your phone now.

81
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:00,707
Well, it might be better without it.

82
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:02,508
I think it's better for me.

83
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,245
And if the Golden Anchovy is
ripped or damaged,

84
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:06,913
it perishes right away.

85
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:11,117
And you can check your location
with this map.

86
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:13,987
"WHAT IS THIS GIANT THING?"

87
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:17,023
Can't you give a small one?
This is so big.

88
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:19,459
Gosh, it's huge.

89
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,562
What do I do with this? What a burden.

90
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:24,931
But I think it'll be easy to catch O3ohn.

91
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,233
You know, he's quite dumb.

92
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,403
I mean, I think he'd be so predictable.

93
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,639
I think it'll be too easy today.

94
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:35,041
Find O3ohn. O3ohn!

95
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,477
The keychain is mine!

96
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:38,845
Then it begins now?

97
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:40,780
-Yes, right now.
-Gosh.

98
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:45,718
<i>Right now, we're here, in Mapo-gu.</i>

99
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,487
Gosh, what should I do?

100
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:49,856
Do the pursuers know where I am right now?

101
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:51,758
Can I know where they are?

102
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:53,626
-Is that possible?
-No.

103
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:56,362
Then we have no clue where each other are.

104
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:59,499
Then I should go to the center first

105
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:01,034
so I can go anywhere.

106
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,370
I should hide somewhere really crowded.
Like Myeong-dong.

107
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:07,040
To make it impossible for them to find me.

108
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:09,309
So I'll head to Myeong-dong first.

109
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:13,680
Then I should kill time there
having some street food.

110
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,483
THE PURSUERS EXERCISE
TO EARN THE EXPENSES FIRST

111
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,286
I wonder what they'd think
watching me on their dashcam footage.

112
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:22,655
I should earn money first.

113
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:25,792
So I can feel confident
when the guys contact me.

114
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:30,963
I bet they're thinking about
how they'll take advantage of me.

115
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,033
I'll never get played today.
There's no way I'll let them.

116
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,536
I'll have my ears shut to them.

117
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:42,141
I WILL NOT LET THEM
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ME ANYMORE

118
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:45,545
If I take this bus…

119
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:48,247
It goes as far as Gwanghwamun.

120
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,117
I should take off at Gwanghwamun.

121
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,554
9:52 A.M. RIDES BUS BOUND FOR GWANGHWAMUN

122
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,189
Let's get on.

123
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:58,391
Gosh, let's get to Gwanghwamun first.

124
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:05,398
3 MINUTES OF RELAXED TRAVEL BY BUS

125
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:09,569
A HIDDEN RULE ACTIVATED

126
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,972
Hidden rules will be activated
here and there.

127
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,040
-Really?
-Yes.

128
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:17,543
And if you violate any of them,
we'll tell you what it is.

129
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:23,216
-O3ohn, there was a hidden rule here.
-Yes. Okay.

130
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:26,652
Since you've been on public transportation
for more than three minutes,

131
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,155
your location is being shared
with the pursuers.

132
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,323
What?

133
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,393
WHEN ON PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION,
BUS NUMBER AND STOP ARE SENT EVERY 3 MIN

134
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,862
<i>I didn't understand what was going on.</i>

135
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:37,697
<i>I had a lot on my mind then.</i>

136
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,266
O3OHN IS ON BUS 4**
PASSING BY SUSAEKGYO BRIDGE

137
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,501
I got a message.

138
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:43,136
Susaek?

139
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,939
If he goes further than Hannam Ogeori,

140
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:48,574
he'll end up in Gangnam.

141
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:50,910
So before he does that,
I bet he'll get off at Jongno.

142
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:52,278
<i>At Jongno or Gwanghwamun.</i>

143
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:53,346
HIS PREDICTION!

144
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,047
Gwanghwamun, Jongno 1-ga.

145
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:57,683
And he's at Gwanghwamun right now.

146
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,751
Let's go.

147
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:00,420
I'm not getting off.

148
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:01,988
Still, I'm faster.

149
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,491
WHILE THE TWO CLOSE IN ON HIM
THANKS TO THE HIDDEN RULE

150
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,294
DINDIN GETS OFF SOMEWHERE

151
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,264
You know why I came to Gwanghwamun?

152
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:13,466
I looked it up on the Internet,

153
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,568
and Gwanghwamun is the center of Seoul.

154
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:18,137
20 MINUTES
BEFORE THE HIDDEN RULE WAS ACTIVATED

155
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:20,306
I'll take Bus 4** and go to Gwanghwamun.

156
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:22,942
Gwanghwamun is the center of Seoul.

157
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,280
PLANNING TO MOVE
FROM THE CENTER OF THE LIMITED AREA

158
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:30,483
Hey, it seems he's coming to Gwanghwamun.

159
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:35,221
O3ohn and I think more alike
than you'd think.

160
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:37,790
Wait a second.

161
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:40,526
If he's on Bus 4** right now,

162
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:43,930
when the bus arrives at Gwanghwamun,
I can just hop on, right?

163
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:47,099
I'll get a message
about the previous stop anyway.

164
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,434
If he doesn't get off.

165
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:51,337
If that happens, it's awesome.

166
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:01,113
FIVE STOPS TO GO UNTIL GWANGHWAMUN

167
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,315
E University Back Gate.

168
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:03,716
He's at E University Back Gate.

169
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:06,219
THREE STOPS TO GO UNTIL GWANGHWAMUN

170
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,387
There are three stops left
until Gwanghwamun.

171
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:10,423
The bus arrives in three minutes.

172
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:17,597
RIGHT THEN

173
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,999
THE BUS ARRIVES

174
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:27,607
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

175
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,477
IT'S THAT BUS!

176
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,646
<i>Getting off.</i>

177
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:35,147
Gosh.

178
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:41,120
Hold on. What?

179
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,922
O3OHN HAS DISAPPEARED

180
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:44,690
This is bad.

181
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:46,259
Why did you get off?

182
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:47,860
Because I might get caught.

183
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:49,695
I mean,

184
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:52,999
I didn't know
even the bus number was being shared.

185
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,535
This is bad.

186
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:58,938
They must know
exactly where I'm headed now.

187
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:01,340
<i>When he suddenly got off the bus,</i>

188
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:03,676
<i>my plan went down the drain</i>
<i>and I was at a loss.</i>

189
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,647
Hold on. It means
he got off at Yeongcheon Market.

190
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,317
Where on earth is this Yeongcheon Market?

191
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:14,220
The Independence Gate, Seodaemun-gu.

192
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,722
He's past Yeongcheon Market.

193
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:18,958
He's going to Gwanghwamun, 100%.

194
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,595
O3OHN IS MOVING
AFTER GETTING OFF AT YEONGCHEON MARKET

195
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:25,064
I'm moving on foot as much as possible.

196
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:28,534
Moving through small alleys

197
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:31,837
to get to Myeong-dong is my goal for now.

198
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:35,474
O3OHN'S EXPECTED ROUTE

199
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,578
DINDIN FEELS BITTER
AFTER HIS FIRST PLAN FAILED

200
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,746
It's so stressful.

201

"MAKING A CALL TO SOMEONE"

202
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:48,020
Jonathan's not picking up.

203
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:53,859
DinDin's making calls
to find out what's going on.

204
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,495
I shouldn't answer it and show my cards.

205
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,398
I shouldn't talk to him right now.

206
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:00,933
HE HAS LEARNED HOW TO SURVIVE

207
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:04,604
ORDEALS THAT HONEST JONATHAN WENT THROUGH

208
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,641
ORDEAL 1: ROBBED OF MONEY
HE SAVED IN HIS UNDERWEAR

209
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:13,112
ORDEAL 2: FORCED TO PAY FOR LUNCH

210
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:16,148
I'm so hurt.

211
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:18,985
Then, who's hurt you the most so far?

212
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:20,586
Lim Cheol.

213
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:23,856
Lim Cheol, who lives in Ichon-dong.

214
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:26,359
He's not answering.

215
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:31,297
LIM CHEOL HAS BEEN ABANDONED
BY JONATHAN THAT HE TRUSTED

216
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:33,866
<i>I felt like I was left all alone,</i>

217
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:36,168
<i>so I just wanted to meet anyone</i>
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

218
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,140
I'm walking in Seodaemun.

219
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,109
National Police Agency.

220
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:46,112
A thief voluntarily coming
to the police station.

221
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:49,482
Should I take a picture here?

222
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:55,388
"WHILE HE IS ENJOYING RUNNING AWAY"

223
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:57,823
-I have to answer it?
-You have to.

224
00:10:58,624 --> 00:10:59,692
I have to answer it?

225
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:02,495

226
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,666

227
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:10,069
JONATHAN IS VIDEO-CALLING?

228
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:13,139
-I'll use the lowest-grade chance.
-Okay.

229
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:15,207
The lowest-grade chance

230
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:17,209
is a one-minute video call.

231
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:18,577
<i>No way. For real?</i>

232
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:20,613
<i>A video call? That's awesome.</i>

233
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,050
After he gets off,
I'll video-call him and ambush him.

234
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:28,287
After he gets off, I'll video-call him
as I get in a cab and ambush him.

235
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,457
<i>It was so disadvantageous to me.</i>

236
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,727
"I CAN'T LET HIM SEE WHEREABOUTS I AM!"

237
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,195
Where are you?

238
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,932
O3ohn, I'm… Right now, I'm…

239
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,000
TAKING A SCREENSHOT FIRST

240
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,569
I miss you, so I'm…
I'm trying to come to you.

241
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:45,504
Hey, do this once for me.

242
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:49,341
<i>My back hurts,</i>
<i>so I can't hold my phone high.</i>

243
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:53,179
Come on, O3ohn,
you can't video-call like that.

244
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:56,215
I'm near the office right now.

245
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:57,817
The production office.

246
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,518
Okay, I got it.

247
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:00,653
<i>Come to Sangam.</i>

248
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,688
-Okay.
<i>-Let's eat together.</i>

249
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:04,490
"Come to Sangam?" I can't believe him.

250
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:06,492
Damn it.

251
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,161
Hold on. Let's start walking.

252
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,130
We must keep moving.

253
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,632
Where he is right now…

254
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:17,169
I took screenshots when he answered it.

255
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:19,672
How am I supposed to find out with this?

256
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,675
God, this is so frustrating.

00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,543
"THE SKY, A BUILDING,
AND HALF OF O3OHN'S FACE"

258
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:25,611
There's a building in it.

259
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:27,747
Yes, there's a building, but it's…

260
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:30,549
It's this building.

261
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:32,685
But its name is not in it.

262
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:35,755
I should ask AI.

263
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:39,658
"Do you know where this building is?"

264
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,827

"Please find out for me."

If it finds out, I'll use this tool
for the rest of my life.

267
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,802
I'll love you so much, seriously.

268
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,440
What? It found it.

269
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:59,478
JUST BY THE SMALL PART OF A BUILDING

270
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:00,880
THE LOCATION WAS FOUND?

271
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,048
He can't know where I am, right?

272
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:05,217
Where?

273
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,987
-KT Gwanghwamun Building West.
-Wow, it really found it.

274
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:13,692

279
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:21,000
We should take a cab.

280
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:22,701
We should take a cab right now.

281
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:25,805
Hello.

282
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:29,241
I should figure out his movement.

283
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:32,111
Looking at the map,
I must figure out where he's going.

I'm so determined.

347
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,187
If it's not enough,

348
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:30,689
I'll bring it out and eat here.

349
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:33,859
<i>It was a great plan.</i>

350
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,662
<i>It was such a sensible move.</i>

351
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,964
No way I'll violate the 3-minute rule.

352
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:46,872
<i>Hold on. I should use the restroom</i>
<i>while I'm here.</i>

353
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:50,442
RESTROOM

354
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,579
A HIDDEN RULE ACTIVATED

355
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:57,216
A hidden rule was activated
by you marking your territory.

356
00:16:57,282 --> 00:17:00,052
-So your location has been sent.
-What? Why?

357
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:01,887
It hasn't been three minutes. What is it?

358
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,489
Because you went to the restroom.

359
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:07,092
That's so harsh. I can't even pee?

360
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:08,594
<i>I have to eat fast.</i>

361
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,762
<i>Hurry up and finish it.</i>

362
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:12,531
A <i>sundaeguk</i> restaurant…

363
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:15,100
A <i>sundaeguk</i> restaurant near City Hall?

364
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:16,301
Hold on.

365
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:18,871
Gosh, he's so laid-back

366
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:20,172
having <i>sundaeguk</i> and all.

367
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:24,209
City Hall?

368
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,745
Let's take a cab.

369
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:28,914
DINDIN STARTS CHASING HIM RIGHT AWAY

370
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:34,253
DINDIN STARTS CHASING HIM
FROM A NEARBY LOCATION

371
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:35,788
IN A RUSH

372
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:36,855
It's hot!

373
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:39,658
What's awesome is that he's near here.

374
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:44,897
AT THE RISK OF BURNING THE ROOF
OF HIS MOUTH, HE SPEEDS UP

375
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,199
DINDIN SPEEDS UP TO AMBUSH O3OHN

376
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,305
HE CAN SEE O3OHN'S SEAT FROM HERE

377
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:02,548
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

378
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:05,184
-Where is the guy with a camera?
-Right.

379
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,318
He left.

380
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:07,719
HE LEFT?

381
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:09,188
How long ago? 10 minutes?

382
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,989
-Yes, about 10 minutes ago.
-I see.

383
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:12,658
Thank you. Did he eat?

384
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:15,094
-Yes, he did.
-Okay, thank you.

385
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:18,797
ABOUT 10 MINUTES AGO

386
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:21,333
Goodness. This is bad.

387
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:24,036
If I don't go inside

388
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,738
or go to the restroom,
I'll win today for sure.

389
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:28,407
No matter what.

390
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:31,677
Unless I do something ridiculous.

391
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:34,113
-Daniel.
<i>-Hey.</i>

392
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:35,514
I was at the restaurant just now.

393
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:36,582
<i>Okay, and?</i>

394
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:38,117
This punk left after eating.

395
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:40,719
Apparently, he left about 10 minutes ago.

396
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,856
<i>If it was 10 minutes ago,</i>
<i>he couldn't have gone far.</i>

397
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:45,991
I think he's heading
for Myeong-dong or Gwanghwamun.

398
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:47,893
<i>Then let's meet by Gwanghwamun.</i>

399
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,261
Okay, okay.

400
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,430
-Let's meet at Gwanghwamun.
<i>-Okay.</i>

401
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:52,798
O3ohn, where are we going?

402
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:54,600
I'm not going to tell you.

403
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,401
I can't trust anyone.

404
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:00,672
MEANWHILE, JONATHAN

405
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,178
That's 15,000 won.

406
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,046
I'll use it for a hint.

407
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:10,415
-Will you use it for a low-grade chance?
-Yes.

408
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,184
It's a 3-minute wiretap chance.

409
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:13,752
-A 3-minute wiretap?
-Yes.

410
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:18,657
<i>For three minutes, you can eavesdrop</i>
<i>on O3ohn's conversations.</i>

411
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:20,559
That's nice. Three minutes is perfect.

412
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:21,827
It begins now!

413
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,399
THE WIRETAP IS
SUCCESSFULLY CONNECTED TO O3OHN

414
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,136
THE CUTTING-EDGE WIRETAP SYSTEM

415
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,005
Say something.

416
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:35,440
Why isn't he saying anything?

417
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,708
"2 MINUTES HAS PASSED BY FRUITLESSLY"

418
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:38,310
Say something.

419
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:39,545
HE'S ABOUT TO WASTE 15,000 WON

420
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:43,115
<i>That's actually why Myeong-dong is good.</i>

421
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,150
<i>There are a lot of clothing stores there.</i>

422
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,654
"Myeong-dong is good,
since there are clothing stores."

423
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,289
HE GETS A BIG HINT WITH "MYEONG-DONG"

424
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,724
Namsan Tunnel 3, City Hall.

425
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:53,959
So that way is…

426
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,028
Why do you keep laughing?

427
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,063
<i>Have you been here before?</i>

428
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,065
No, not in this underpass.

429
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,100
I've come to this area a lot though.

430
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:06,538
<i>Myeong-dong is…</i>
<i>Myeong-dong is just 300 m away.</i>

431
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:08,807
"THE 3-MINUTE WIRETAP ENDS"

432
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:09,975
Let's go to Myeong-dong.

433
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,743
I think that's going to
be the battlefield.

434
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:16,682
CURRENT LOCATIONS

435
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:18,951
Wow, it's been ages since I came here.

436
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:23,922
I always used to go into Myeong-dong
through Exit 6 over there.

437
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:25,657
This is a good place to hide too,

438
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,125
since it's crowded.

439
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:29,494
They'll never be able to catch me.

440
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:30,896
This place is…

441
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:33,165
What is it?

442
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,733
"A CALL FROM SOMEONE"

443
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:36,969
Hello?

444
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:39,271
I'm filming.

445
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:43,075
Well, I'm… You know,

446
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:44,276
I'm in Sangam right now.

447
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:46,845
<i>Anchovy Physical Camp</i>.

448
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,046
"WHO IS HE LYING TO?"

449
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:50,449
I'm filming <i>Anchovy Camp</i>.

450
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,018
O3ohn's close with that guy.

451
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:57,122
Was his name Deokbae?

452
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,258
-Who? Deokbae?
-The rapper.

453
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:01,093
Nucksal. Right, Nucksal.

454
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:05,297
But I don't know him at all.

455
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:06,698
"DOESN'T KNOW HIM NOR HAS HIS NUMBER"

456
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,367
We're complete strangers.

457
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,468
"DMING HIM ANYWAY"

458
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:11,937
Oh, it's Nucksal.

459
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:14,039
Nucksal contacted me. Hold on.

460
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:15,607
<i>Hello?</i>

461
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:17,276
Hello, Nucksal.

462
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:18,877
<i>Oh, yes. Hello.</i>

463
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,746
Hi, this is Choi Daniel.

464
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:21,913
<i>Nice to meet you.</i>

465
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,882
<i>I'd like to ask you to call O3ohn</i>

466
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,984
<i>-and ask where he is.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

467
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:27,819
If he says he's filming,

468
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:30,689
ask where he's filming. Could you do that?

469
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:33,625
-Could you…
<i>-That's it?</i>

470
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:35,027
Yes, just that.

471
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:36,928
I was just wondering what you were doing.

472
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:39,364
I see. Who made you do this?

473
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:41,466
<i>What do you mean?</i>

474
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:44,970
Which writer asked you to do this?
Or which producer?

475
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:47,272
<i>Come on. I don't know anyone there.</i>

476
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:48,340
Really?

477
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,342
<i>I really just called you</i>
<i>because I missed you.</i>

478
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:52,577
All right.

"THE RAPPER'S ACTING WASN'T NATURAL"

00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:55,180
<i>Come on, don't be like that.</i>

481
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:56,815
<i>You're not in Sangam. Where are you?</i>

482
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:59,418
I told you, I'm in Sangam.

483
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:01,520
<i>-Okay, then.</i>
-All right.

484
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:02,688
<i>-Bye.</i>
-Bye.

"O3OHN DIDN'T FALL FOR IT"

Why am I getting nervous?

487
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:09,961
I'm getting so anxious.

488
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:12,464
Since I'm here, should I disguise myself?

489
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:15,467
With this on,
don't I look like a middle-aged woman?

490
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:18,270
And add this, and it's perfect.

491
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:20,539
They won't recognize me, right?

492
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:23,375
"DONE DISGUISING HIMSELF AS PEDESTRIAN 1"

00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:28,613
Gosh, I'm spending too much money today.

495
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,681
It's not good.

496
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:31,316
Can I pay by card?

497
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:32,751
-Thank you.
-Bye.

501
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:41,093
<i>Damn it. The payment details.</i>

502
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:46,031
It shows the location too?

503
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:47,933
So you think he's disguising himself?

504
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:50,369
Yes, he's buying things
to disguise himself.

505
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:52,070
So I should go stop him before he does.

506
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:53,472
What do I do?

Gwanghwamun is pretty close.

Oh, hey!

00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:08,653
So you were telling the truth!

514
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,356
I thought you were lying.

515
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:12,557
It was so hard for me.

516
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:13,892
You were telling the truth!

517
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:16,027
Seriously, I wanted to smash everything.

518
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:20,332
-Hey.
-Let's go. Let's head there first.

519

Then let's hurry.

00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,003
-We should go this way.
-This way?

522
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,805
We're near Myeong-dong. Just over there.

523
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:27,939
JONATHAN IS ALREADY IN MYEONG-DONG

524
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:29,341
All right, from here on,

525
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:32,477
anything can happen all of a sudden,
so be prepared.

526
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:36,882
I think I'll definitely get caught,
since they know I'm in Myeong-dong.

527
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,519
What do I do?

528
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,923
Should I take the headpiece from them?

529
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:47,893
O3OHN

530
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:49,261
O3OHN IS

531
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:50,595
O3OHN IS CLOSE

532
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:02,741
Seriously, talk about
finding a needle in a haystack.

533
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:04,409
Right, how are we supposed to find him?

534
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:06,344
We just need to find this accessory shop.

535
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:08,346
Do you know O3ohn?

536
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:09,548
Singer O3ohn, do you know him?

537
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,283
"SHAKING HEAD"

538
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:12,517
Have you seen O3ohn?

539
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:13,652
-No.
-No?

540
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,387
Hey! It's that shop!

541
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:18,190
"THEY FINALLY FIND THE SHOP"

542
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:19,558
Daniel, look.

543
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:20,792
Let's see his movement.

544
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:22,060
-He went to this place first.
-Yes.

545
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,662
-Then here.
-Right.

546
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:25,363
-Then he must've gone this way.
-Yes.

547
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,631
He must have, right?

548
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:28,300
Let's go in the opposite direction. But…

549
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:30,368
Gwanghwamun is pretty close.

550
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:32,704
EXACTLY THE SAME

551
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:35,273
Darn it, this is bad.

552
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,374
A celeb's car.

553
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:40,312
A celeb's car.

554
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:41,513
It can't be, right?

555
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:44,049
No way.

556
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:45,584
I'm getting nervous.

557
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:47,419
No, it's not.

558
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,987
Gosh, it scared me.

559
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:53,758
Goodness, every time I see a minivan,
it drives me crazy now.

560
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:57,095
I shouldn't have come out
to a main street like this.

561
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:02,133
But Daniel, this is hopeless.

562
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:04,402
Should we use a chance?

563
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:07,138
-A chance? Darn it.
-How much were they again?

564
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:09,274
-The lowest one is 10,000 won.
-10,000 won, 15,000…

565
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,476
And 20,000, 25,000, 50,000, 100,000 won.

566
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:14,779
Darn it. All right, let's use
the 15,000-won one. I'll pay.

567
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,982
-Okay, I'll pay 5,000 won.
-I'll pay 10,000 won.

568
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:18,149
-So 15,000 won.
-Okay.

569
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:19,818
It's a 3-minute wiretap chance.

570
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:21,019
-That's good.
-It's not bad.

571
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:23,822
<i>Now, eavesdropping O3ohn begins now.</i>

572
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:26,091
<i>Do you still want to buy glasses?</i>

573
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:28,260
<i>I want to make my disguise perfect.</i>

574
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:29,694
He's buying glasses.

575
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:31,630
TAPPING DEVICE APPEARS AGAIN

576
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:32,697
What's that?

577
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,401
What do you keep doing with that?

578
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:37,636
Are you recording me?

579
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,004
<i>Is that right?</i>

580
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,639
<i>It's not. That one.</i>

581
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,607
An eyewear store.

582
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:46,111
<i>I made them all come to Myeong-dong.</i>

583
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:48,880
So a big battle will happen here.

584
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,448
What is that?

585
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,685
It sounds like a performance.

586
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:58,490
"A PERFORMANCE IS BEING HELD NEARBY"

587
00:25:58,557 --> 00:25:59,558
It's a performance.

588
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:02,260
HE'S NEAR THE PERFORMANCE!

589
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:05,163
FIND THE SOURCE OF THE MUSIC!

590
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,464
<i>What was great</i>

591
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:08,466
<i>was that there was some event going on.</i>

592
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:11,369
We could hear the noise,
so we could guess whereabouts he was.

593
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,205
Wow, the music is so cool.

594
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:17,342
THE FUGITIVE ENJOYING THE BEAT

595
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:20,545
AND THE PURSUERS CHASING THE BEAT

596
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:24,416
SOMEWHERE NEARBY

597
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:28,019
THEY HEAR THE REPETITIVE BEAT

598
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,157
MIMICKING THE BEAT

599
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:35,193
DINDIN THE SINGER

600
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,129
COMPARES THE BEAT FROM THE PHONE
WITH THE BEAT HE HEARS LIVE

601
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:44,736
THIS WAY!

602
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:51,009
It's so good.

603
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,193
-Hey!
-My God!

604
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:09,394
-What?
-Hey!

605
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,895
-You bastard!
-Hey.

606
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,197
-Hey.
-Hey.

607
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:14,432
-No. Hold on.
-Hey. You little…

608
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:16,267
-You thought you could get away?
-Wait.

609
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:18,603
-Did you think you could get away from us?
-No, no.

610
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:21,306
Jonathan took it from me.

611
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:23,008
-What?
-He already took it from me.

612
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:24,843
-Don't lie.
-For real.

613
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:27,145
He took it about 30 minutes ago.
I don't have it.

614
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,881
So I was just hanging around here.

615
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:32,784
HE DEFINITELY BOUGHT A BAG FOR THE ANCHOVY

616
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:36,021
AND CARRIED IT
AS IF IT WAS A PART OF HIS BODY

617
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:39,858
BUT THE BAG IS GONE?

618
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,926
-Are you serious?
-Yes, look, I don't have it.

619
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:43,828
Where's Jonathan?

620
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:45,330
-Stop lying.
-I'm serious.

621
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:46,731
-Hey.
-Seriously, right now…

622
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:47,799
O3ohn.

623
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:49,601
If you lie, we might kill you.

624
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:52,170
-You don't understand the situation.
-We might break your back.

625
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:54,139
I was about to go buy a gun.

626
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,608
Seriously, tell us the truth now.

627
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,743
I am telling the truth.
About 30 minutes ago,

628
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,912
Jonathan took it and my phone too.

629
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:02,814
-He took your phone?
-Yes.

630
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:05,183
-For real.
-Then tell me this.

631
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,851
How did you and Jonathan meet?

632
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:10,455
Around here, I ordered coffee
and was waiting for it,

633
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:13,658
and he snatched my bag, so I chased him.

634
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:14,793
That's what happened.

635
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,795
We have to go find Jonathan.

636
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:21,499
THEY CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT HE'S SAYING

637
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:24,235
"Damn it, should I kick him in the butt?"

638
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:25,637
I seriously thought that.

639
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,038
Hey.

640
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:28,773
-You punk.
-This place is perfect.

641
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,241
-Come here.
-This is not right.

642
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:32,677
-Come here.
-You're being so violent.

643
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:33,745
-Come here.
-Come on.

644
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:35,246
-You're being so violent.
-Don't scream.

645
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:36,314
-Stand here.
-Be quiet.

646
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,183
-Act friendly.
-I'm traumatized.

647
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:39,317
Stand here.

648
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:41,653
Oh. I'm sorry.

649
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,722
-I don't have it.
-Where did you hide it?

650
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:46,057
-All right. Fine, I get it.
-Jonathan took it.

651
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:47,726
-Hey, then…
-I don't have it. It's just trash.

652
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:50,095
Just tell me this.
Did you really meet Jonathan or not?

653
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:53,064
Be my guest.
I did meet him. He took it from me.

654
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:55,700
God damn it, that little bastard.

655
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:57,969
But seriously, at that time,

656
00:28:58,036 --> 00:28:59,771
<i>I almost lost it, for real.</i>

657
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:02,540
I mean, how on earth
did Jonathan know you were here?

658
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:04,309
He was the first one to find me.

659
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:06,277
He video-called me earlier

660
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:09,914
and asked me if I was at Gwanghwamun,
trying to locate me.

661
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:13,284
You know what?
It might be true that Jonathan has it.

662
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:16,888
I mean, earlier Jonathan told me
not to call him.

663
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:18,823
He said, "Don't call me anymore."

664
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:20,492
Tell him we won't call him ever again.

665
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:23,828
I'll never call him again.
I'm going to unfollow him.

666
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:26,030
Jonathan really might have it.

667
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:27,732
-He does.
-I mean, it felt weird.

668
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,067
He does, not "might."

669
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:30,468
"RIGHT THEN"

670
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:32,337
-My goodness!
-Hey!

671
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:33,404
-My goodness!
-Hey!

672
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:34,539
What the?

673
00:29:35,306 --> 00:29:36,808
"WHY ARE YOU HERE?"

674
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:37,876
Hey.

675
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:38,943
"SWOOSH"

676
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:40,278
What?

677
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:41,513
Hey, you bastard…

678
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,449
"SUSPECT 1 SUDDENLY RUNS"

679
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:56,628
-Hold on.
-Hey.

680
00:29:57,762 --> 00:29:59,631
-Hey…
-Hey, don't hit him.

681
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:00,865
Hey.

682
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:03,701
"THE PATHETIC CHASE LASTED 15 SECONDS"

683
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:04,769
Are you kidding me?

684
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:07,839
-Do you have a death wish?
-This punk really is trash.

685
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:09,174
Do you want to die?

686
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:12,577
-Hey.
-He's so shameless.

687
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:16,614
Where did you hide it?

688
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:19,918
-I didn't hide anything.
-Where did you hide it?

689
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,452
"JONATHAN IS JUST DENYING IT?"

690
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,721
-Let's eat. Let's go eat.
-Let's eat.

691
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:25,924
-Let's take him with us.
-Let's take him.

692
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,759
This won't do. I should hold you.

693
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,861
-Let's go to eat quietly, okay?
-Fine.

694
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:31,529
<i>-Okay.</i>
<i>-If you run while eating?</i>

695
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:32,630
<i>I'll beat you.</i>

696
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:33,898
<i>I won't run while eating.</i>

697
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:35,967
What's with you guys?

698
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:37,669
Hey, so what happened?

699
00:30:37,735 --> 00:30:39,571
Did you meet O3ohn earlier or not?

700
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:41,072
-I didn't.
-This is the first time?

701
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:42,173
It is.

702
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,809
-Then you're lying.
-He's so shameless.

703
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:46,177
"FRUSTRATED"

704
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:49,214
-Why do you believe him and not me?
-Seriously, you…

705
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,616
You've been doing a lot of shows lately,
you've become so brazen.

706
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:52,884
He's lying right now.

707
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:55,620
At this rate,
you'll get star syndrome and get ruined.

708
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,655
No. Seriously, you…

709
00:30:57,722 --> 00:30:59,123
He's so shameless.

710
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,758
What do you mean?

711
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:03,194
If I really did that,
I wouldn't have shown up there.

712
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:06,464
"FIND OUT WHO STOLE THE GOLDEN ANCHOVY"

713
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,066
Where is it, by the way?

714
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:09,300
What do you mean?

715
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:11,469
You took it earlier.

716
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:12,570
When did I?

717
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:15,173
-Earlier in front of the café.
-I never met you.

718
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,241
What are you saying?

719
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:18,343
"CONFUSED"

720
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:19,878
He snatched it right away.

721
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:21,613
After that, I never saw him.

722
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,382
After that, he hid it somewhere and…

723
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:26,851
-I think he hid it somewhere
-You're so adorable.

724
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:29,787
and came back to pretend you didn't.

725
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:31,089
That's so cute.

726
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,625
That's so cute.

727
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:36,294
O3OHN SHOULD BE THE THIEF…

728
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:41,532
BUT THERE'S A STRANGE LOOK IN HIS EYES

729
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:44,969
HIS EYES LOOK ANXIOUS
AND HIS EXPRESSION IS PUZZLING

730
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:47,138
This is your first time meeting O3ohn?

731
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:48,973
-Yes.
-Today.

732
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,843
-Yes, the first time today.
-Come on. Are you lying or not?

733
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,812
You don't seem
to have a strong desire for the keychain.

734
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:57,782
Perhaps you already know where it is?

735
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:03,554
Are you relaxed
because you know where it is?

736
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:05,423
You're right.

737
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,892
Because, you know how you usually are?

738
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:11,062
"If I only do this one thing,
I can win the keychain."

739
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:12,897
"I know you have it!"

740
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:14,933
-You'd be like this.
-"Come on, do it!"

741
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:17,035
You'd be like this, but you're so relaxed.

742
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:19,704
"JONATHAN'S RELAXED COMPOSURE
IS SUSPICIOUS"

743
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,807
Now that I think about it,
he should've asked where the keychain was,

744
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:24,776
-but he just grabbed me.
-He said, "What are you doing?"

745
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,544
"A HIDDEN RULE ACTIVATED"

746
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,546
I'm not suspecting him for no reason.

747
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:31,382
HIDDEN RULE 4
DETAIL: ???

748
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:34,018
A TEXT MESSAGE EXPLAINING THE HIDDEN RULE
HAS ARRIVED

749
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:35,787
What time is it now?

750
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:38,389
We should just stay close to them all day.

751
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:42,060
"CHECKING THE MESSAGE ON HIS SMARTWATCH"

752
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:46,331
What time is it?

753
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:48,533
It's 1:30.

754
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,568
-Where are you going?
-Going out to smoke.

755
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:51,636
-Okay.
-It's 1:30?

756
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:55,473
Go smoke with him.

757
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,541
No.

758
00:32:57,675 --> 00:32:59,177
Who knows what you'll do?

759
00:32:59,677 --> 00:33:01,879
"DINDIN TAKES A PICTURE
WITH A FAN OUTSIDE"

760
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:07,018
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

761
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:09,754
HE STARTS RUNNING RIGHT AWAY

762
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:16,561
WHAT WAS THE RULE THAT DINDIN SAW?

763
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:19,764
WHERE IS THE GOLDEN ANCHOVY?
