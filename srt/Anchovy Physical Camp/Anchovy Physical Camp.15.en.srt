1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,437
THE EIGHTH TRAINING
ON A RAINY AUTUMN DAY

2
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:09,976
THE PLACE FOR TODAY'S TRAINING:
CIRCUIT TRAINING GYM

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,579
-Is this a CrossFit gym?
-Yes.

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,181
Geez… It's going to be so tough.

5
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:17,617
Well, I kind of look forward to it now,

6
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,652
to what we're going to do today.

7
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:23,423
Hold on. I don't think
it's going to be a back exercise, is it?

8
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,692
NOTICING SOMETHING

9
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:27,861
What? What's this?

10
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:30,096
I bet this is it.

11
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:31,831
I know what it is.

12
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:33,099
"Stairway to Heaven."

13
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,635
What? We're doing Stairway to Heaven?

14
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:36,803
DINDIN NOTICES IT TOO

15
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,606
We don't even try to hide it anymore.

16
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:41,908
Yes, it's Stairway to Heaven. So what?

17
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,577
My goodness, this is bad.

18
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:46,713
Is the bell ready?

19
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,649
Where is it? The bell's not here.

20
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:50,917
I don't see it.

21
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:52,085
It's really not here.

22
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:53,787
Hey, why is there no bell?

23
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,590
We have to ring the bell today.

24
00:00:57,657 --> 00:00:58,892
It's really not here.

25
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:02,395
THEY HAVE A BAD FEELING
FROM THE START

26
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:05,565
Hello, Anchovy Physical Camp trainees.

27
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:08,835
Seeing the machines, you already know
what the mission is, don't you?

28
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,004
I noticed them as soon as I came in.

29
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,439
Heaven.

30
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:15,141
A full-body exercise
that lets you get a taste of heaven.

31
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:17,510
It's called "Stairway to Heaven."

32
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:22,515
You must climb 8,848 meters.

33
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,818
What? Eight what?

34
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:27,987
Goodness, how far is that? 8,848 m?

35
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:32,225
It's like the height of a high mountain.

36
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,594
A height of 8,848 meters is the height

37
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:37,764
of the highest peak in the Himalayas,
Mount Everest.

38
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,740
By the way, how many machines
do you see behind you?

39
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:48,808
-Two.
-Two.

40
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,443
2 MACHINES!

41
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:54,214
WE ONLY DID ONE PERSON AT A TIME
FOR BODY WEIGHT EXERCISES

42
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,216
AND FOR MACHINE EXERCISES
AS WELL

43
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,852
SOMEONE ALWAYS TRIED TO HOG IT

44
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:00,353
Hold on.

45
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:02,989
Why two machines?

46
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:05,625
Wait. Is it a team mission today?

47
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:08,361
There must be guests.

48
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:09,929
Do we have guests?

49
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:11,931
We have four guests today.

50
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:13,800
-Really?
-Wow!

51
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,269
Hey, they're dead meat.

52
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:17,937
No one survives this show.

53
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:20,039
They must think we're so weak.

54
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:23,409
Now, I'll introduce them one by one.

55
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,278
First guest, please come out.

56
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:26,613
Who is it?

57
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:30,483
Who could it be?

58
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,819
THE FIRST GUEST SHOWS HERSELF

59
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:34,687
SINGER KWON EUNBI

60
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:36,956
-Hello, friends!
-Is that Eunbi? Eunbi!

61
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:38,358
Oh, it's Eunbi.

62
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,894
GLAD

63
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,095
Hi.

64
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,430
Eunbi will do Stairway to Heaven with us?

65
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,132
This is not going to be easy.

66
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,534
We secured one to beat now.

67
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,070
ANCHOVIES LOOK DOWN ON HER, BUT…

68
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:52,405
Jonathan likes to eat, right?

69
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:54,507
He's easily affected
by blood sugar spikes.

70
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:57,177
<i>I'll make him eat and finish him off.</i>

71
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:59,746
<i>I'll make DinDin talk a lot</i>
<i>to get him exhausted fast.</i>

72
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:00,813
Stop it.

73
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,448
You'll dispirit them.

74
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,250
-Like a constant poison.
-Yes.

75
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:06,152
We got a poisonous spider here.

76
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:07,720
GUEST WHO'S GOOD AT MIND GAMES

77
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:09,856
-Hello.
-Hey, Ms. Kwon.

78
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,591
-Nice to see you here.
-Ms. Kwon.

79
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:14,027
-We met a while ago. We meet again.
-Yes, you're right.

80
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:16,196
JUST HAPPY WITH NO IDEA
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN

81
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:18,097
Wow, I'm a huge fan, for real.

82
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:21,501
Now, let me introduce the second guest.

83
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:23,203
Shouldn't it be someone strong?

84
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:24,704
Could it be an athlete?

85
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:29,075
ACTRESS JEONG HEIN

86
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:30,577
Hello!

87
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:32,879
-Hello.
-What? Is that Hein?

88
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:34,747
UNEXPECTEDLY,
HIS CLOSE FRIEND APPEARS

89
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:38,017
Hello.

90
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:39,652
She climbed 400 m?

91
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,754
<i>Honestly, I'm confident in my stamina.</i>

92
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:45,325
<i>I want to make them think</i>
<i>that I'm tenacious.</i>

93
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,995
GUEST WHO HAS GREAT ENDURANCE

94
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,698
Wow, she's such a good footballer.

95
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:53,833
Really good at football.

96
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,468
Hello, everyone.

97
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:58,571
Many people think I'm a footballer,
but I'm actress Jeong Hein.

98
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:00,540
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

99
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,409
She's taller than us.

100
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:05,411
Her height… Hello.

101
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:07,513
FEELING SLIGHTLY THREATENED

102
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,916
Now, third guest, please come out.

103
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:11,718
Who could it be?

104
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:17,323
Hello.

105
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,958
MODEL LEE SIAN

106
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,094
It's done! One is done!

107
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,830
<i>I expect to do well at games.</i>

108
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:26,199
<i>I can be seriously competitive.</i>

109
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,800
GUEST WHO IS COMPETITIVE

110
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,135
Nice to meet you.

111
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:32,171
I'm sorry, but stop hitting on them, man.

112
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:33,906
-Geez.
-Hey.

113
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:36,809
You hit on every one of them.
What's wrong with you?

114
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:39,445
-It's not like that. I know all of them.
-Really?

115
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:42,048
Hello, everyone. I'm Lee Sian.

116
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:47,353
Now it's the last guest.

117
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,554
Who's the last one?

118
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,290
I think it'll be a dark horse.

119
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:54,294
THE LAST ONE
FINALLY REVEALS HERSELF

120
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:56,462
Maybe it's an athlete?

121
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:58,164
Why are you smiling so ominously?

122
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:01,167
Wow, no way.

123
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:03,770
THE LAST GUEST
WHO MAKES ANCHOVIES FREEZE

124
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,442
JANG EUNSIL,
WRESTLING NATIONAL TEAM

125
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:12,412
Gosh, this is intense!

126
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,448
Jang Eunsil!

127
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:16,949
Last one!

128
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:20,486
<i>I plan to exercise</i>
<i>just as much as I usually do.</i>

129
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:23,856
<i>And I'm determined to</i>
<i>beat the four anchovies no matter what!</i>

130
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:26,259
GUEST WITH A GREAT PHYSIQUE

131
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,362
<i>It seemed they weren't that nervous</i>
<i>when the three guests appeared.</i>

132
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:32,665
<i>So I wanted to keep them on their toes</i>
<i>with my appearance.</i>

133
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:35,234
-Aren't you a professional athlete?
-Nice to meet you.

134
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:37,970
NATIONAL TEAM ATHLETE'S
WAY OF GREETING

135
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:40,406
Oh, my goodness!

136
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:41,941
Her hand is so hard.

137
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:44,544
Our teammate.

138
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,580
Hey, O3ohn, go greet them
with a fist bump.

139
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,415
Nice to meet you.

140
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:51,050
Let's play fair.

141
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:54,253
OUCH!

142
00:05:58,224 --> 00:05:59,158
What was that?

143
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,461
A WAR OF NERVES ALREADY STARTED

144
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:04,764
O3ohn, calm down.
Don't let her get to you.

145
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,933
Mess with her, and she'll kill you.

146
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:08,000
It's not broken?

147
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:09,736
Not yet.

148
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:11,604
She's so…

149
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:16,175
<i>Today, you must beat the other team</i>
<i>for one of you to win the keychain.</i>

150
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:18,177
<i>And a deduction game appears</i>
<i>every 1,000 meters.</i>

151
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:20,213
-The start button is on the right.
-Okay.

152
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,314
-Push it to start.
-Okay.

153
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,283
Today, you need to
climb at speed 7 at least.

154
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,252
-At least?
-How fast is seven?

155
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,321
That's quite fast.

156
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,623
Please make sure
you don't get slower than speed 7.

157
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,493
By the way, do you guys
have any plans tonight?

158
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,161
We'll finish it by then for you.

159
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:36,863
PROVOKING

160
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:39,332
-It's kind of cute you're saying that.
-Me?

161
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:43,736
Don't say I'm cute.

162
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:46,406
All right, 12 hours begins now.

163
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:51,077
-I'll go first, since it's my first time.
-Okay.

164
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,246
Do I go up here first?

165
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:55,214
-Let's go, Eunbi.
-Let's go.

166
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:56,282
EUNBI GOES FIRST

167
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,184
Oh, it's begun.

168
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,019
STARTING AT SPEED 7

169
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:03,523
-Oh, it's just climbing stairs.
-Yes.

170
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,792
This isn't bad.

171
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,795
I mean…

172
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,230
-It's not bad at all.
-You can go faster, then.

173
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,533
I should. I'll go with 10.

174
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:15,768
It's not bad.

175
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:18,171
I'll go with speed 10.

176
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:19,772
Since his legs are so long.

177
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,407
You're really doing well.

178
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:24,744
Let's make plans for tonight.
We'll finish early.

179
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:26,546
I'll finish it.

180
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:27,814
REACHING 80 M IN 3 MINUTES

181
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:31,751
-Eunbi, how is it? Are you even moving?
-Yes.

182
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,053
Is that right?

183
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,423
Hey, Eunbi, have you never
climbed stairs before?

184
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:40,393
I've never seen anyone
climb stairs like this.

185
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:43,196
<i>My endurance isn't that good,</i>

186
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:46,699
<i>so not to become a burden to my team,</i>
<i>I had to try many ways.</i>

187
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,602
Launch the female version of this show
and cast her.

188
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:50,670
Right.

189
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:52,772
She's the true anchovy.

190
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,974
Who climbs it like that?

191
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,776
She seems to be having a hard time.

192
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,812
SIAN WATCHING EUNBI STRUGGLE

193
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,348
<i>She seemed to be getting slower.</i>

194
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,884
<i>I thought I should fill in for her.</i>

195
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,586
<i>I'm very competitive,</i>

196
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,955
<i>so I do whatever it takes to get it done.</i>

197
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,424
GOING FOR SPEED 10 RIGHT AWAY

198
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,359
Well, this is so easy.

199
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,862
-It's so easy.
-How fast are you going?

200
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:17,196
-Speed 10.
-10?

201
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:20,066
-It's 10? Good.
-I mean, it's so easy.

202
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:24,937
REACHING 60 M AT SPEED 10

203
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:35,281
PANTING

204
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:38,484
THE-CROWN-OF-THE-HEAD SHOT

205
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:40,953
Hey, Sian, what's wrong?

206
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,188
You said it was easy.

207
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:43,256
No, it's so tough.

208
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:44,323
-I mean…
-She's tired.

209
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,527
…you said it was so easy earlier.
What are you doing?

210
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:49,061
-This is so tough.
-Hey.

211
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:51,130
Eunbi is already lying on the ground.

212
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:53,366
SHE'S EXHAUSTED WAY TOO EARLY

213
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:55,668
-She came to rest.
-She's done.

214
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:57,570
Is that right?

215
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,940
-She's just leaning forward. What's that?
-Hold on. That's wrong.

216
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:02,808
-Come on.
-She's propping up her body weight.

217
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,477
This is not right.

218
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,679
-You can't do it like that.
-What's wrong?

219
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,281
This is unfair.

220
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:10,683
If I can't do it,
I should use my brain at least.

221
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:14,787
Jonathan.

222
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:16,656
MEANWHILE,
JONATHAN CLIMBS EFFORTLESSLY

223
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,058
-You do Stairway to Heaven, right?
-Yes, a lot.

224
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,159
He's impressive.

225
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,827
Speed 18 is just impossible!

226
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,296
I'm telling you, I can do it.

227
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:25,598
NOW IT'S TIME TO SHOW HOW GOOD HE IS!

228
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:27,967
-Jonathan, how is it?
-Good.

229
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,902
-It's still easy, right?
-Totally.

230
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:32,038
Since I have to last long.

231
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,473
<i>Anyone can climb stairs.</i>

232
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,710
<i>But what's crucial is</i>
<i>how long you can do it.</i>

233
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:40,846
JONATHAN CLIMBS
SLOWLY AND STEADILY

234
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,749
THE NEXT GUEST PLAYER GETS READY

235
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,185
The national player's on.

236
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:52,592
Gosh, Eunsil, we're counting on you.
Let's go!

237
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:54,727
A WHILE AGO

238
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,228
How long can you last?

239
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:58,831
-Honestly, I could go for an hour.
-Wow.

240
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:00,499
TO CATCH UP

241
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:01,567
-Twenty?
-She's pushing it!

242
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:04,837
UP TO THE MAXIMUM SPEED, 25

243
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,072
-Faster!
-Faster.

244
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:08,074
-She's running.
-It's 25.

245
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:12,712
<i>Stair climbing?</i>

246
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:13,779
<i>It's easy.</i>

247
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:16,749
<i>Right now, I'm not even warmed up yet.</i>

248
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:20,519
That's insane.

249
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:24,357
THE CLASS OF A NATIONAL TEAM ATHLETE

250
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:26,525
Jonathan's so stable.

251
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:27,893
-Just until 300.
-Good.

252
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,961
-Stop.
-Okay!

253
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:30,262
-Okay!
-300?

254
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:31,597
It's 1,000 m!

255
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:35,167
ANCHOVY TEAM REACHES 1,000 M
BY A MARGIN OF 49 M

256
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:37,870
-Now, here's the first game.
-Okay.

257
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:39,772
-We must win this.
-Yes, no matter what.

258
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,842
-A deduction of 500 m is on the line.
-Wow.

259
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:44,977
"Guess Rankings of Faces."

260
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,912
"Guess Rankings of Faces."

261
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,014
Hold on.

262
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,148
THEY SEEM TO KNOW

263
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,685
What's that?

264
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:55,454
-You talk about your looks a lot.
-Right.

265
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:58,157
About who's most handsome and ugliest.

266
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:01,661
THE DISPUTE OVER LOOKS STARTED
SINCE THE PREPRODUCTION MEETING

267
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:02,728
I'm third place.

268
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,697
IT'S BEEN GOING ON IN VAIN
SINCE THEN

269
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:08,067
I mean, O3ohn's face was
a total mess today.

270
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:11,203
To make it fair,
before we started filming,

271
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:14,573
we asked the guests to rank your looks.

272
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:17,977
IN THE GREEN ROOM BEFORE FILMING

273
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:21,047
They asked us to rank
the four members' looks.

274
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,952
KWON EUNBI

275
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,955
We only consider their looks, right?
Not their personalities.

276
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,524
I don't know about that.

277
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,759
-Faces only just from the neck up.
-Okay.

278
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:35,594
First place first.

279
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:36,829
It's *** for me.

280
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,964
Oh… Why?

281
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,234
I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT WHY

282
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:46,972
THE DISCUSSION WENT ON
FOR A LONG TIME

283
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,308
THEY BARELY REACHED AN AGREEMENT

284
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,509
It'll be so funny.

285
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:54,413
You can discuss and guess the rankings.

286
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:57,149
<i>If you get all of them right,</i>

287
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:00,886
<i>both teams will get 500 m deducted.</i>

288
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:02,288
IT ALL DEPENDS ON ANCHOVY TEAM

289
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:04,256
-They have to get them right, then.
-Really?

290
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:06,258
Okay! Hey, let's do this.

291
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:08,894
-Hey!
-First of all…

292
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:11,230
-I'm sure of first place.
-No, let's do this.

293
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:14,133
-Each says his own rankings.
-Okay.

294
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,469
Jonathan, you go first.
Who's first place for you?

295
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:18,571
DinDin.

296
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:20,139
-What's up, G?
-What?

297
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:21,474
-Hey.
-What's up, G?

298
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,842
-Yeah!
-He's first place?

299
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,111
Hey, how is he first place?

300
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:26,479
His image is good lately.

301
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:28,314
Yeah!

302
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,381
Who's second place?

303
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:30,649
Second place is…

304
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:33,519
-me.
-Okay!

305
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,955
Okay!

306
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:38,891
This is so funny.

307
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,761
3RD PLACE IS…

308
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:43,896
Hey, are you seriously torn about this?

309
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:45,965
-Hey, if I'm being honest,
-Okay.

310
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:47,266
it's neck and neck.

311
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,903
Hey. This is ridiculous.

312
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,706
Goodness.

313
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,641
O3ohn's third place.

314
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:57,476
Daniel's fourth place.

315
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:59,678
-This is absurd.
-You hit rock bottom.

316
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:02,081
This is so funny. Why are they so serious?

317
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,650
I feel like they gave it a twist.

318
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:06,285
So I think

319
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:07,620
I'm first place.

320
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:09,088
What a load of crap.

321
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:11,924
-No, no. They must've twisted it.
-Hey, that's just impossible.

322
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,426
No, they must've given it a twist, so…

323
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:16,362
-Second place is Jonathan.
-Yeah, bro.

324
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:17,429
Third place is DinDin.

325
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:19,031
Oh, it changed!

326
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:20,432
LAST PLACE AGAIN

327
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,403
For me, third place is O3ohn.

328
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,272
-Yes!
-Seriously.

329
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:27,740
It's O3ohn, seriously.

330
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:28,874
UNANIMOUSLY LAST PLACE

331
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:30,709
-This is ridiculous.
-His image is…

332
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:32,378
I'm speechless.

333
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,915
THEY'RE ARGUING FOR 10 MINUTES
WITHOUT MAKING A DECISION

334
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,417
Now, tell us clearly. Who's first place?

335
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,885
First place is…

336
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,253
-It's DinDin.
-DinDin.

337
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,955
Jonathan for second place?

338
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:44,523
Okay, second place is me.

339
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,825
Please.

340
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:48,527
You're almost there.

341
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:50,596
-Third place is Daniel.
-Yes, right.

342
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,598
-Fourth place is O3ohn.
-Right.

343
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,501
All right, you made your decision.

344
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:59,338
I'll reveal first place first.

345
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,440
First place is…

346
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,543
-DinDin?
-DinDin.

347
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,412
1ST PLACE, DINDIN (CORRECT)

348
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:07,980
I told you.

349
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,283
A SMOOTH START
TO A DEDUCTION OF 500 M

350
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,118
I get it. DinDin's good.

351
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,687
It's important from here.

352
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,823
They had a heated discussion
about second place. I'll reveal it.

353
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:19,458
Second place is…

354
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,827
ANTICIPATING

355
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:24,063
-Jonathan.
-Oh!

356
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:28,067
I told you! I was right!

357
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:31,337
IN A FESTIVE MOOD
AFTER GETTING HALF RIGHT

358
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:33,572
EXCEPT FOR ONE PERSON

359
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,575
-We got it? Really?
-Yes, we guessed he was second place.

360
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,311
Daniel.

361
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:41,680
Wait. No way.

362
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:43,082
His buttons are pushed.

363
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:45,351
-Hold on. No way.
-No way.

364
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:47,219
Now, third place.

365
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:51,123
IF DANIEL IS 3RD PLACE, BOTH
TEAMS GET A DEDUCTION OF 500 M

366
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,225
It's O3ohn.

367
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,628
3RD PLACE, O3OHN (WRONG)

368
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:57,897
Yes! Thank you.

369
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,465
O3OHN'S HAPPY
DESPITE BEING INCORRECT

370
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:02,868
AND ONE MAN IS IN DESPAIR

371
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:04,803
Yes! Thank you.

372
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,206
Fourth place is Daniel.

373
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:08,474
That was so close.

374
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:11,744
WHAT A PITY WE GET NO DEDUCTION

375
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,613
But this is hurting him so much.

376
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,348
Why do I feel so victorious?

377
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:19,752
<i>Anyway, you failed</i>
<i>to get a deduction of 500 m.</i>

378
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:21,387
-Let's…
-Go again.

379
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,622
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

380
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,959
She had to stop midway, so she'll do more.

381
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,193
EUNSIL GETS READY

382
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,596
Eunsil, go for 1,000 m in one go.

383
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,064
Okay.

384
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:36,302
Speed 20.

385
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:37,536
BEGINNING WITH 20

386
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,739
Eunsil, what if you end up
coming in first among everyone?

387
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:43,142
…coming in first among everyone?

388
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:47,913
DINDIN SETS IT AT 20 TOO

389
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,049
-Speed 20.
-Don't overdo it.

390
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:54,053
It's a long shoot,
so tell me if it gets tough.

391
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,189
Go for 25?

392
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:58,991
-25? Tell me it gets tough.
-25?

393
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:00,359
-Go for 25.
-Okay.

394
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:03,362
-Okay!
-The two are rivals now.

395
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:04,430
Okay!

396
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:06,899
-Tell me it gets hard.
-Let's go.

397
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,805
Wow, this is crazy.

398
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:14,707
Tell me if it gets tough.

399
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:16,642
LOOKING PEACEFUL

400
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:18,711
It's tough!

401
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:21,180
DinDin, calm down.

402
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:24,717
EUNSIL KEEPS GOING STEADILY

403
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:26,318
See you next time.

404
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:28,087
See you again.

405
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,657
TAKING ON TWO ANCHOVIES
AT A FAST SPEED

406
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:33,525
He looks tired.

407
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:34,793
This is not easy.

408
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:37,029
Jonathan, open your eyes.

409
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:39,198
-What?
-Open your eyes.

410
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:40,265
They're open.

411
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:42,701
I think it's 320.

412
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:43,902
-320?
-Yes.

413
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:44,970
THE GAP IS 19 M NOW

414
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:48,240
HEIN WILL CLOSE THE GAP
EVEN MORE

415
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:50,876
They're determined.

416
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,313
SHE'S QUIET BUT STRONG

417
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,181
Hein has climbed 100 m.

418
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:59,752
-Hein has climbed 200 m.
-Goodness.

419
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:01,754
JEONG HEIN HAS REACHED 200

420
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:05,424
HEIN KEEPS GOING
EVEN WITH HER OPPONENT CHANGING

421
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:06,759
-You climbed 100.
-But

422
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:10,729
her eyes say
she's not going to stop anytime soon.

423
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:12,197
BRIGHT-EYED

424
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:13,465
She's not going to stop.

425
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,701
Hein is a dark horse.

426
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:18,470
I mean, Eunsil is so fast,

427
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,906
-but Hein's so fast too.
-You're so cool.

428
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:22,808
We might really lose.

429
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:27,880
<i>While playing football for four years,</i>
<i>my stamina has increased a lot.</i>

430
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:29,181
<i>I'm confident.</i>

431
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,150
She's got great stamina.

432
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,985
Hein's climbed 400.

433
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,087
400?

434
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:37,189
It's unexpectedly neck and neck.

435
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:40,225
WHILE THE TWO TEAMS ARE
COMPETING FIERCELY…

436
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:46,031
DANIEL'S STILL STRUGGLING
IN THE SWAMP OF 4TH PLACE

437
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:47,266
<i>I have no motivation now.</i>

438
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:50,035
<i>Today's keychain? If there was the bell,</i>
<i>I'd ring it right away.</i>

439
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:54,273
Whatever. The interview's over.

440
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:56,542
Go away. I want to be alone.

441
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,710
Go. Leave me alone, Director.

442
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:00,345
I want to be alone.

443
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:10,856
REALITY CHECK

444
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:16,228
<i>To tell the truth,</i>
<i>that was what we aimed for.</i>

445
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:17,930
<i>Mentality is also important.</i>

446
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:19,798
<i>So we tried to break them mentally.</i>

447
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:22,801
<i>That's what we hoped for,</i>
<i>and he broke down sooner than expected.</i>

448
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:24,636
<i>I think it worked well.</i>

449
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:28,373
But in truth, we think he's handsome.

450
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,075
You're so handsome.

451
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:31,143
DOESN'T FEEL SINCERE

452
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:34,379
Hey, it happens.

453
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:39,051
How can you be handsome all your life?

454
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:42,588
One day you're handsome,
and you look ugly on another, you know?

455
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:45,624
And you could look handsome again.

456
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:47,126
That's life.

457
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:48,760
Right?

458
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:52,131
SMACKING LIPS AND SNIFFING

459
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,801
THANKS TO DISPIRITED DANIEL…

460
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:58,704
THE GUEST TEAM
HAS TURNED THE TABLES!

461
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,939
-A deduction of 500 m is on the line.
-500?

462
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:03,075
And it's win or lose this time.

463
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,545
It's peeling shrimps with your bare hands.

464
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,013
-Peeling shrimps?
-Shrimp?

465
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,381
-What? Shrimp?
-What?

466
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:11,183
Hot shrimp? I'm so good at it!

467
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,551
-We'll win!
-Hot shrimp?

468
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:14,019
Now,

469
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:17,456
-peeling shrimps is a team battle.
-Great.

470
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,424
They're freshly grilled and hot.

471
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:22,261
You must peel

472
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,464
ten shrimps with your bare hands.

473
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:29,067
<i>You must get rid of all the legs</i>
<i>and the head.</i>

474
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:32,738
<i>We'll allow up to one segment of the shell</i>
<i>at the tail.</i>

475
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:34,706
I'm great at this.

476
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:36,975
I think I can do this well.
I feel confident.

477
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:38,343
I can't touch hot stuff well.

478
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,078
-You can't? Okay.
-I can't.

479
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:41,914
I'll cover for you.

480
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,649
Finally something I actually can do.

481
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:47,186
<i>I felt so confident.</i>
<i>I thought it was my game.</i>

482
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:48,787
It's my flirting secret,

483
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,088
peeling shrimps for a guy.

484
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:52,491
Gosh, I shouldn't have said that.

485
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:55,427
Peel some for them,
and they just fall for me.

486
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:57,663
So I've done it a lot, with my bare hands.

487
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:59,064
A family-minded woman.

488
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:00,832
A family woman.

489
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:03,235
<i>It's my specialty,</i>

490
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,103
<i>so I feel so confident.</i>

491
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:07,105
Use something like a book underneath.

492
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:08,974
SHRIMPS READY

493
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,643
Hey, it looks so hot!

494
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,512
-Look at the steam.
-I mean,

495
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:15,280
it's basically still boiling.

496
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:16,348
LOOKING SCARY ALREADY

497
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:17,616
They look so delicious.

498
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:19,985
THE EXPERIENCED ONE
REACTS DIFFERENTLY

499
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,154
All right, ready…

500
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,722
PEELING STARTS!

501
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:26,825
STEAMING

502
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,694
It's so hot! Geez!

503
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:30,629
It's freaking hot. Gosh.

504
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,397
HURRY-SCURRY

505
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:33,799
SCREAMING

506
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:34,866
It's so hot!

507
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:36,935
MAKING SUCH A BIG FUSS

508
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:39,238
-It's hot! They're too hot.
-Ouch!

509
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:40,939
Seriously, they're so freaking hot!

510
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:42,808
THEY CAN'T EVEN TOUCH
THE SHRIMPS PROPERLY

511
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:44,209
Hold them here.

512
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:45,944
AMIDST CHAOS, THE GUEST TEAM…

513
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,581
Take them all out first.

514
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:52,851
<i>At the beginning,</i>
<i>Sian suggested division of work.</i>

515
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,653
-We should cool them down first.
-Right.

516
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,887
TASK 1
COOL THEM DOWN: HEIN

517
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:59,391
TASK 2
REMOVE HEADS: EUNSIL

518
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,227
TASK 3
REMOVE SHELL: SIAN, EUNBI

519
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:05,864
THE SHRIMP FACTORY OPERATES
FOLLOWING SIAN'S LEAD

520
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:10,969
I peeled it. One is done.

521
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:14,506
WHILE SIAN PEELED ON

522
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:17,843
THEY'RE STILL FIGHTING
WITH HOTNESS

523
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:19,344
It's hot. God!

524
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:20,979
I removed the head.

525
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:23,382
IT'S HARD EVEN TO PEEL
ONE SHRIMP

526
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:25,217
I can only use my hands?

527
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:28,220
Can I use my mouth? No?

528
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:31,390
MEANWHILE, SIAN QUIETLY
COMPLETES THE SECOND ONE

529
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:35,027
THEY'RE SPEEDING UP

530
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:36,995
<i>I can't climb well like my teammates,</i>

531
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:39,631
<i>but I believe I can do well at games.</i>

532
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:43,368
SHRIMP PEELING MASTER

533
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:48,974
-Are they all peeled?
-They're done.

534
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,243
SHE EVEN GETS IN THE WAY
OF THE CAMERA

535
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,211
Whoa, what's with them?

536
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:54,613
Peel it from the tail.

537
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,882
ANXIOUS ANCHOVY TEAM
PUTS ON A SPURT

538
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:59,184
It's done. I peeled one.

539
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:00,252
Okay.

540
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,620
-We're done!
-Done.

541
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:04,589
GAME OVER

542
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:08,427
Now, there are 10,
and I'll count fails first.

543
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:09,695
One fail.

544
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:11,463
Two fails.

545
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,733
-Three fails. What did you even peel?
-It's so hot.

546
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,568
One, two, three, four, five, six…

547
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:18,370
You peeled seven shrimps properly.

548
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:23,408
NEXT IS THE GUEST TEAM'S TURN

549
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:24,476
All right.

550
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:27,079
To be precise, this one's a fail.

551
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:29,915
-I'll exclude this.
-Okay.

552
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:32,818
-All right.
-This one still has a leg.

553
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:34,353
-This one?
-Yes, it's a leg.

554
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:35,487
No, it's not.

555
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:36,722
That's meat.

556
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:39,591
KEEPING EACH OTHER IN CHECK

557
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:42,594
All right. The guest team peeled…

558
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:45,297
"DID THEY PEEL MORE THAN 7?"

559
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,432
Nine shrimps properly.

560
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:48,800
You win.

561
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:51,837
ANCHOVY TEAM: 7
GUEST TEAM: 9

562
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,541
A deduction of 500 m.

563
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:58,877
Oh, it's good.

564
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:01,813
<i>After the shrimp peeling,</i>
<i>my self-confidence was boosted.</i>

565
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,316
I'm proud of myself. I'm an ace.

566
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:11,323
<i>All right, the guest team wins</i>
<i>the deduction of 500 m.</i>

567
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,225
We'll begin now.

568
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:14,326
Let's go.

569
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,062
WE'LL MAKE UP FOR THE LOSS
WITH EXERCISE!

570
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:24,302
Come here.

571
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,573
This is so good.

572
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:32,110
WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU?

573
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,513
JONATHAN, COME ON

574
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:35,580
What?

575
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:37,616
-What?
-Why are you avoiding me?

576
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:39,217
Because I have to do it soon.

577
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:40,552
I'm trying to look after you.

578
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:41,987
Okay, thank you.

579
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:44,456
-Why do you keep coming?
-Well, I…

580
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:47,592
You want to make us eat
and make it harder for us, huh?

581
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:49,728
Eunbi keeps giving us something to eat.

582
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:51,930
She's giving us snacks and drinks.

583
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:54,299
She isn't being kind or anything.

584
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,668
SHADY

585
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:57,903
She's like this.

586
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:59,704
She's looking very suspicious.

587
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,973
JONATHAN WHO ATE SNACKS
EUNBI GAVE HIM…

588
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:04,075
PANTING

589
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:06,278
Hey, I don't think going fast is good.

590
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:08,280
It's not good.

591
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:11,383
-Get out.
-Hey, switch.

592
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,484
He did 35.

593
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:13,952
Hey, 35 m?

594
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:15,153
No, I was…

595
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,294
A WHILE AGO

596
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,964
When Jonathan eats something,
he gets a blood sugar spike right away.

597
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:27,999
So, keep giving him something delicious.

598
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:29,334
So he gets the spike.

599
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:31,002
EUNBI CAME UP WITH
PERSONALIZED SCHEMES

600
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,773
NEXT TARGET IS O3OHN

601
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:36,608
STARING

602
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:37,742
Eunbi.

603
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,044
Gosh.

604
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,378
-Eunbi.
-No, no.

605
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:42,113
-Eunbi, don't.
-What are you? A ghost?

606
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,015
O3ohn's shy.

607
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:48,153
HER STRATEGY PERSONALIZED
FOR EACH ONE SEEMS TO BE WORKING

608
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,621
Oh, no, I'm losing strength.

609
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:52,591
-Hold on.
-Just five.

610
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,059
STARING WITHOUT MOVING

611
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:56,995
KNOCKED OUT IN THE END

612
00:24:57,462 --> 00:25:00,232
IT WAS VERY EFFECTIVE!

613
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:02,200
DANIEL GETS ON RIGHT AWAY

614
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:03,835
-Let's go!
-Here comes fourth place!

615
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:04,903
Let's go--

616
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:08,673
-Fourth place.
-What… Hey.

617
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,643
As for Daniel,
let's keep calling him fourth place

618
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:12,978
to dispirit him.

619
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:15,380
Fourth place Daniel!

620
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,782
THE SCHEME FOR DANIEL
WORKS PERFECTLY TOO

621
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,451
Fourth place Daniel!

622
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:20,719
Hey, stop it!

623
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:22,153
-Hey.
-He's losing strength.

624
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,623
Wait. Hold on.

625
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:25,991
DANIEL TAKEN OUT

626
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:27,993
I forgot about it, but you keep…

627
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:29,394
Eunbi is just

628
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:30,495
evil.

629
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:34,466
THE GUEST TEAM IS IN THE LEAD

630
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,468
Then they're 509 m ahead of us.

631
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,069
I'll explain the game.

632
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:39,771
-A deduction of 500 m is on the line.
-Okay.

633
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:41,873
The game is "Catch the Tail."

634
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,141
-What's that?
-You know.

635
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,309
-"Catch the Tail"?
-Like this?

636
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,477
Isn't it pinning the tails?

637
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,947
You'll move as one
holding the waist of the person ahead

638
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:51,917
<i>and try to steal</i>
<i>the other team's tail first.</i>

639
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:53,018
-Hold the belt here.
-What?

640
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:54,085
Oh, here?

641
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:55,420
Hold on to my underwear.

642
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:56,621
Hold here, right?

643
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,424
Guys, decide on the order.

644
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:00,892
Hey, you be the head.

645
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:02,394
WHO'S THE HEAD FOR EACH TEAM?

646
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,863
ANCHOVY TEAM'S HEAD: JONATHAN

647
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,732
GUEST TEAM'S HEAD: JANG EUNSIL

648
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:08,900
I'll do my best to follow you.

649
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:11,403
-Look at her back.
-It's going to be so tough.

650
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:12,604
We're dead meat.

651
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:14,472
-She looks so strong.
-Look at her back.

652
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,977
That team's so scary.
She's a wrestler on the national team.

653
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:20,045
RELIABLE

654
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:22,047
Okay, ready. Shall we begin?

655
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:24,349
All right. Ready…

656
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,717
Assess them first.

657
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:28,086
-Go for Eunbi.
-Move right. To the right.

658
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:29,988
TENSION GROWS IN THE BEGINNING

659
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:31,122
Assess them.

660
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:33,191
<i>I didn't think it'd be hard.</i>

661
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,026
<i>Because I have long arms</i>

662
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,162
and I believed I could do well at it.

663
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:38,263
Hey, feel them out.

664
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,731
Yes, do it.

665
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:41,633
<i>Since I'm a professional athlete,</i>

666
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,202
<i>I am very competitive and passionate.</i>

667
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,403
I can't lose.

668
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:48,873
-Hey, they're scared.
-They keep looking to the right.

669
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,942
-Hey.
-Good.

670
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:53,111
SWIFT

671
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:54,512
What do we do?

672
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:56,214
-Oh, no.
-What do we do?

673
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,649
FLUSTERED

674
00:26:57,849 --> 00:26:59,584
EUNSIL AND JONATHAN CLASH!

675
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:01,987
<i>When he grabbed my wrists,</i>

676
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:04,756
<i>it was much stronger</i>
<i>than the grips I usually dealt with.</i>

677
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:06,191
<i>I had to avoid it.</i>

678
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:07,859
-Oh, no.
-Jonathan, be careful!

679
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:10,261
<i>When I grabbed her arms,</i>

680
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:11,963
<i>I couldn't overpower her.</i>

681
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,365
<i>I knew she was stronger than me.</i>

682
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:14,866
Turn!

683
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:17,235
-Turn!
-Here we go!

684
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:19,037
HOLD TIGHT!

685
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:22,774
A BEAST WATCHING FOR A CHANCE

686
00:27:23,274 --> 00:27:25,377
AND ANOTHER BEAST
OVERPOWERING HIM

687
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,448
Hey, your pants will come off.

688
00:27:30,515 --> 00:27:32,117
This is so scary!

689
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:33,618
It's so scary!

690
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:35,086
STAY ALERT, OR YOU LOSE

691
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:37,822
I knew I'd never overpower her.

692
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:39,057
Come on!

693
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:40,558
Bring it on!

694
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:43,428
<i>I tried to make feints</i>
<i>like in American football.</i>

695
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:46,364
BODY FEINTING

696
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:47,766
IMPENETRABLE DEFENSE

697
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:51,369
That's it!

698
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:53,905
Hold on. Oh, God.

699
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:55,073
Oh, no.

700
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,141
Jonathan.

701
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:58,777
Come on, this way. Don't go that way.

702
00:27:58,843 --> 00:27:59,844
Jonathan, run now!

703
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:01,446
Run! Run to the right!

704
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:06,284
O3ohn, stick your butt to her.

705
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,952
-Once more.
-Eunsil.

706
00:28:11,222 --> 00:28:12,924
AT THAT MOMENT,
JONATHAN GOES FOR IT

707
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:15,193
THE TAIL FLUTTERS LIKE PAPER

708
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:18,496
SCREAMING

709
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,169
CLENCH

710
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:27,906
DRAGGED ALONG…

711
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:30,742
Okay, stop! Okay. Okay!

712
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,045
It was my wrestler instinct.

713
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:36,781
<i>I shouldn't get pushed back,</i>
<i>or else everyone behind me falters.</i>

714
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:40,351
<i>So I think I held him a bit too tightly.</i>

715
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:41,453
She's so strong.

716
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:43,154
I couldn't move forward. God…

717
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,356
She's like a wall. She's on another level.

718
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:46,791
I wasn't going at full power.

719
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:48,560
About 70%?

720
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,495
Hold on!

721
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,464
JONATHAN DAMAGED
BY HER WRESTLING MOVES

722
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,798
-We have to go.
-Hold on.

723
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,334
THE GUEST TEAM'S GOING TO WIN
LIKE THIS?

724
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,103
Jonathan looks so exhausted.

725
00:28:58,169 --> 00:28:59,738
Jonathan, we have to go!

726
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:01,873
Just go for it. Jonathan, just go!

727
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:05,777
<i>I am going to win three keychains.</i>

728
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:08,079
Go!

729
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:09,914
Hold her!

730
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:12,183
<i>This is my game.</i>

731
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:14,085
<i>I can't lose.</i>

732
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:17,756
JONATHAN CHARGES

733
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:19,791
His arms are so long!

734
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:21,826
-No!
<i>-Since I have long arms,</i>

735
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:23,461
<i>I should make use of that.</i>

736
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:25,563
-Hold her. Go for it.
-Hold her!

737
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,664
Hold her!

738
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:27,732
Good!

739
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:30,135
FIGHTING THE NATIONAL TEAM
WRESTLER UP CLOSE

740
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:34,472
<i>So I let her hold me close on purpose</i>
<i>and grabbed Eunbi's hand.</i>

741
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,841
-Hold her.
-No!

742
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:40,245
Jonathan, that's it!

743
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:47,786
<i>I'll win the keychain.</i>

744
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:50,855
Okay!

745
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:53,158
ANCHOVY TEAM WINS

746
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:56,027
When she held me, it was tough for me too.

747
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:58,663
But we won, and I'm so glad.

748
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,131
What I worried about is,

749
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:01,933
since we're stronger

750
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,334
and we're men,

751
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:05,470
<i>I wondered</i>
<i>if we should really do it seriously.</i>

752
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:06,838
<i>But we almost ended up losing.</i>

753
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:09,440
If I'd worn Jonathan out more,

754
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:11,543
I think I would've been
able to catch the tail.

755
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:12,844
It's a shame.

756
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:16,748
If you were the head instead,
would the result have been different?

757
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,049
No, it would've been the same.

758
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:20,418
But it would've taken less time.

759
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,053
I practiced Jeet Kune Do, you know.

760
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:25,890
ANCHOVY TEAM GETS
A DEDUCTION OF 500 M!

761
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:29,727
KEEPING THE MOMENTUM GOING,
DINDIN GOES FIRST

762
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:31,930
-Oh, my. Is it too fast?
-What?

763
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,698
-How fast?
-Speed 20.

764
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:35,266
She's overdoing it.

765
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:37,101
Should we go with 22?

766
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:39,037
Then I'll go with 25.

767
00:30:39,804 --> 00:30:41,673
I can just run,
like running on the ground.

768
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:42,740
Good!

769
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:44,809
It's getting fierce.

770
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:47,011
But what's important is to win the games.

771
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:49,347
If we lose at the next game again, we'll…

772
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:50,915
-Lose the deduction.
-Yes.

773
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:52,517
SWITCHING AFTER CLIMBING 100 M

774
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:53,885
-I'm done. I did 100.
-Next.

775
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,386
NEXT PLAYERS

776
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:57,322
Wow, Hein's so stable.

777
00:30:57,388 --> 00:30:58,957
-I think she's doing the best.
-Yes.

778
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,425
Hein's good.

779
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:02,760
Hein's climbed 100 m.

780
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:05,530
-Jonathan, can you do more?
-Nope.

781
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:08,299
-O3ohn.
-Okay.

782
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,702
Hein's climbed 200 m.

783
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:11,769
HEIN REACHES 200 M

784
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,807
I think the guys are quite exhausted.

785
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:17,508
Look. They're lying down.

786
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:18,977
O3ohn's legs gave out.

787
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:20,778
And DinDin's exhausted.

788
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:23,414
Daniel's legs gave out too.

789
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:26,017
Jonathan's the ace among them,

790
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:27,685
but I think he's exhausted.

791
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:29,387
He used too much energy at the game.

792
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:32,290
NOW'S THE TIME TO PUSH!

793
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:34,058
-Hey, the legend is on.
-No!

794
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:35,693
-The legend is on.
-No!

795
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:38,596
The boss has come out.

796
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:40,865
<i>It's just the beginning.</i>

797
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:42,333
<i>It's just the beginning.</i>

798
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,401
You know what?

799
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:45,837
Eunsil's upper body doesn't move at all.

800
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,606
-Like she's on parallel bars.
-It doesn't move.

801
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:49,674
STIFF

802
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,175
She's so tough.

803
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:58,316
BEATING ANCHOVY TEAM
WITH THE STEADY POSTURE

804
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:00,218
Eunsil's climbed 400 m.

805
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:02,420
THANKS TO HEIN AND EUNSIL

806
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:04,455
THE GUEST TEAM MAINTAINS
THE LEAD

807
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:07,392
You guys have been working hard,
so we prepared dinner.

808
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:11,296
The reward is something that goes
perfectly with packed meals.

809
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:13,231
-<i>Ramyeon</i>?
-It's <i>ramyeon.</i>

810
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:14,465
Cup noodles?

811
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:15,633
<i>"One Bite of Puffed Rice."</i>

812
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:19,570
<i>Each has a bite, and the team</i>
<i>that leaves less, wins.</i>

813
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:23,107
-It's 7.1 g. You see that?
-Yes.

814
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:26,244
-Just be careful not to break it.
-Okay.

815
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:27,312
You can begin.

816
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:29,314
FIRST PLAYER: KWON EUNBI

817
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,418
Gosh.

818
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:38,690
SMALL

819
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:40,158
What are you doing?

820
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:41,559
She only ate that much?

821
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:43,094
That's so small.

822
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:45,229
PETIT

823
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:47,065
SECOND PLAYER SIAN IS SO PRESSURED

824
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,132
You know what?

825
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:49,834
Sian's mouth is quite big.

826
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:52,403
Oh, Sian's doing well. Wow!

827
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:54,906
-You can't break it.
-Wait, more?

828
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,574
You might end up throwing up.

829
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,344
<i>My image is plunging.</i>

830
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:02,313
<i>But I'm competitive, so I did my best.</i>

831
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:06,985
THIRD PLAYER: JANG EUNSIL

832
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:08,619
-She ate a lot.
-She took a big bite.

833
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:09,687
Just shove it in.

834
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:11,322
-Shove it in? Okay.
-Shove it in.

835
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:12,590
-Like this.
-Slowly.

836
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:15,126
Her mouth isn't that big.

837
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:16,394
But you never know.

838
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:18,363
No, the square footage is actually big.

839
00:33:18,896 --> 00:33:20,631
What do you mean by "square footage?"

840
00:33:20,698 --> 00:33:21,766
Her mouth isn't an apartment.

841
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,368
LEFT AND RIGHT TERRACE ANNEXED

842
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,806
God, she's so competitive.

843
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,775
LAST PLAYER: JEONG HEIN

844
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:31,843
My mouth is small.

845
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:34,379
Hein! Hey!

846
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,081
Hold on.

847
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:39,150
-Hold on.
-What?

848
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:41,519
-Goodness.
-Seriously.

849
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,790
Why are they so determined to beat us?
It's driving me nuts.

850
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:49,927
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS

851
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:53,498
<i>We got so competitive.</i>

852
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:56,567
And the way we tried so hard to win
was so funny.

853
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:58,169
I mean, to win this silly game.

854
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,538
Did you know your mouth was that big?

855
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:03,374
I didn't. I thought my mouth was small.

856
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:06,377
My mouth is small, though.

857
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:09,013
Hold on. There's something
I'm genuinely curious about.

858
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,215
Why are you so determined to beat us?

859
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:13,718
Is there a special reward or something?

860
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:16,187
-Now, it's Anchovy Team's turn.
-Let's begin.

861
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:17,255
Go.

862
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:19,457
-Don't break it.
-Eat a lot.

863
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:20,658
-More.
-That's so cute.

864
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:23,628
-That's so cute.
-That's cute.

865
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:25,063
Are you a squirrel or what?

866
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:27,799
-What?
-It broke!

867
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:28,866
-It broke!
-No!

868
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:29,934
It broke!

869
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:31,235
-It broke!
-No!

870
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:32,470
No, no. This is…

871
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:33,805
-Why?
-Don't take it out.

872
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:35,406
-Why take it out?
-Why take it out?

873
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:38,209
Don't eat that and put it down.
We'll include the weight of it.

874
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,011
TO BE CALCULATED TOGETHER

875
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,612
-It's okay. Right.
-You can finish this.

876
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,047
-Who's next?
-I'll go.

877
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:44,682
His mouth is like a black hole.

878
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:47,318
O3ohn, warm up your mouth.

879
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:48,619
O3OHN-HOLE

880
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:51,422
I'll show you my music pocket.

881
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:55,493
Good. Let's go.

882
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,727
Bite.

883
00:34:57,795 --> 00:34:59,497
-What?
