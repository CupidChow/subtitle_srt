1
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:07,841
THE NINTH PLACE OF TRAINING, A QUIET BEACH

2
00:00:07,907 --> 00:00:10,910
Did you bring us here to sell us off?

3
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:14,180
I wonder what we'll do today.
I feel so nervous. I mean, the beach?

4
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:17,217
Gosh, this is so fake. You made it look…

5
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:19,652
-So fake.
-…like we're on a vacation.

6
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:21,321
This is fake, isn't it?

7
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:23,790
If I knew, I would've brought my swimwear.

8
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,225
RIGHT THEN

9
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,227
-Hello.
-What are you, a tourist?

10
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:28,361
-What's going on?
-What?

11
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:29,829
DRESSED LIKE SOMEONE ON VACATION

12
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:32,165
-What is this?
-Why are you dressed up?

13
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:34,868
-I was told to wear a vacation outfit.
-Really?

14
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:37,404
WHAT'S GOING ON?

15
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,072
Hello, anchovies.

16
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:40,740
-Hello.
-Hello.

17
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:43,543
Judging by the coach's outfit,
can you guess what we'll do?

18
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,445
What could it be?

19
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:47,580
It's obviously a vacation outfit.

20
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:48,648
Vacation?

21
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:50,984
-Maybe we'll rest.
-It looks like a vacation outfit.

22
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,720
Your ninth mission is…

23
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:56,756
Today, you don't have a mission.

24
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:57,824
-What?
-For real?

25
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,025
You don't have a mission.

26
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:00,460
-For real?
-What are you saying?

27
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:01,795
-Don't lie.
-Seriously?

28
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:04,064
-But there's the 12-hour timer.
-I know.

29
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,699
And there's even a massage bed.

30
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:11,137
Muscles damaged by exercise
recover and grow through rest.

31
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:14,374
Yes. That's right.

32
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:16,876
Rest is as important as exercise,
they say.

33
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:18,144
So we prepared this.

34
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:19,446
A self-sufficient vacation.

35
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:21,714
It's Anchovy Retreat.

36
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:22,782
"Retreat"?

37
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:25,518
You said it's a vacation.
Why is it a retreat?

38
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:28,721
You asked earlier why there was a timer.

39
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:32,492
You can enjoy your vacation
for 12 hours from now.

40
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:35,228
-What?
-For real? What's going on?

41
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:36,396
However,

42
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,332
you must earn the expenses yourselves.

43
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,301
Hold on.

44
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:42,769
Of course.

45
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:46,206
But how do we earn the expenses?

46
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:49,609
By doing the bodyweight exercises
you have done so far,

47
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:50,977
you can earn them.

48
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:53,947
We have to exercise after all.

49
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:57,650
<i>Per push-up, sit-up, and squat,</i>

50
00:01:57,717 --> 00:01:58,985
<i>you can earn 20 won.</i>

51
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:01,654
If it's 20 won per one,
it's 200 won if you do 10.

52
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:05,091
<i>Since the burpee test is more difficult,</i>
<i>it's 40 won per one.</i>

53
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:09,729
With the money you earn by doing them,
you can have lunch and dinner.

54
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,531
What is this, <i>Animal Crossing</i>?

55
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:12,999
SELF-SUFFICIENT VACATION, ANCHOVY RETREAT

56
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:14,200
<i>But it is a vacation.</i>

57
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:16,936
<i>The producers will count how many you do.</i>

58
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:18,471
HOW TO WIN THE KEYCHAIN TODAY?

59
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:20,640
<i>We'll give you guys lucky pouches.</i>

60
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:23,176
<i>The one with the most money at the end</i>

61
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:24,677
<i>wins the keychain.</i>

62
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:26,779
So the one who exercises more,

63
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:30,083
earns more, and spends less
than the others wins the keychain.

64
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,719
To make it feel like a vacation,
we prepared outfits for you.

65
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:36,489
They may be in a floral pattern,
but they're prison uniforms.

66
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:38,925
The 12-hour vacation starts now.

67
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:49,969
FEELING AWKWARD TO JUST REST
ALL OF A SUDDEN

68
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:53,506
Gosh, this is pretty awkward.

69
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:55,742
I didn't expect this.

70
00:02:55,808 --> 00:03:00,146
By the way, do you want
to have a big lunch or dinner?

71
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:01,814
No, I want a light one.

72
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:04,350
How about we have a light lunch
at a convenience store?

73
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:05,652
-Like cup noodles.
-Sounds good.

74
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:07,187
-Cup noodles.
-Right, I like that.

75
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:09,455
-So let's say we need 5,000 won each.
-Right.

76
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:12,825
It means we must do at least 250
to have lunch.

77
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:13,993
-For 5,000 won.
-Right.

78
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,129
-250 in total.
-Then first thing,

79
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,564
let's exercise to eat.

80
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,899
All right. Let's each do whatever we want.

81
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:22,602
DANIEL GETS STARTED FIRST

82
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,206
STARTING WITH BURPEES, THE HIGHEST VALUE

83
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:27,307
Forty won.

84
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:28,975
Two.

85
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,443
40 WON PER BURPEE

86
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,511
Three.

87
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:34,447
It's not going to work.
Burpees are too tiring.

88
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:36,883
Five.

89
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,918
-200 won?
-You earned 200 won?

90
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:40,753
-Pay him right away.
-What?

91
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,655
So you pay us right away like this?

92
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,057
-200 won?
-Seriously?

93
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:45,892
Oh, so you earn your money like this.

94
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,260
This isn't bad.

95
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:50,330
If you do some and rest and do some again,
it's doable.

96
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,265
TWINKLING EYES

97
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,033
You guys are all going to be rich today.

98
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,102
A SMILE SPREADS ACROSS HIS FACE?

99
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:58,504
I'll do 10 squats now.

100
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,939
You can do it whenever you want.

101
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:04,444
EVERYONE STARTS EARNING MONEY
BY DOING WHAT THEY'RE CONFIDENT IN

102
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,946
Five. I just earned 500 won.

103
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:08,581
I earned 500 won too.

104
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:10,850
How much did you earn, Jonathan?

105
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,986
-I earned 200 won.
-200 won?

106
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:14,053
600 won.

107
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,121
QUITE GOOD MONEY

108
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,223
Hey, how about we give it our all

109
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,425
-and earn like 10 million won?
-Hey.

110
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:21,894
Why buy a meal with it, then?
I'll just save it

111
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:23,696
and buy a house.

112
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,131
We'll finish it in no time.

113
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,735
I earned 500 won.

114
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,037
WITH A GOOD START, HE RESTS RIGHT AWAY

115
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,840
Seriously, this is not bad.

116
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:36,476
40 MINUTES INTO THE VACATION

117
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,449
Lying on the beach?

118
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:45,184
I haven't done this in ages.

119
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:46,986
LOOKING AROUND

120
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:48,421
I'm going to the restroom.

121
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:49,856
The restroom…

122
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:53,293
JONATHAN IS GOING TOWARD THE RESTROOM

123
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:55,161
How much is it?

124
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,529
It's 2,800 won.

125
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,632
2,800 WON OUT OF NOWHERE?

126
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,301
-Did you wait on purpose?
-Yes.

127
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:02,869
So they wouldn't see it?

128
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:03,936
That's right.

129
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:07,774
WHEN EVERYONE ELSE WAS RESTING

130
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,509
-600 won.
-Yes.

131
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:11,744
JONATHAN LOOKS SUSPICIOUS

132
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:13,246
Let's do this.

133
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,316
-They shouldn't be conscious of me.
-Right.

134
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:18,918
How much I earn, don't tell anyone but me.

135
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,655
To them,
I'm not doing anything, understand?

136
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:28,594
WHILE THE OTHERS WERE AWAY FOR A WHILE

137
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:34,500
HE EXERCISED HARD ALONE

138
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:36,269
Do you have a towel?

139
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:38,905
I don't want them to see me sweat.

140
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:41,374
You can't tell them how much I've earned.

141
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:44,077
<i>If I fail to win the keychain today,</i>
<i>it's over for me,</i>

142
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:45,812
<i>so I had no choice.</i>

143
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:47,947
I earn as much as I sweat.

144
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,882
I'll play fair and square

145
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:52,218
<i>and win the keychain today.</i>

146
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,320
Here,

147
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:56,689
I'll do 100.

148
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,592
PREPARING TO EARN

149
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:00,660
First,

150
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:02,528
to fool them…

151
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:05,765
1,000-WON BILLS IN HIS HANDS

152
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:09,202
GO INTO HIS UNDERWEAR

153
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:11,871
This money is my asset now.

154
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:14,173
I won't lose it unless someone touches it.

155
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:15,808
Depositing it in your underwear?

156
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,176
Yes, an underwear deposit.

157
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:20,179
-That's such a private place.
-Right.

158
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:21,347
Stop doing that.

159
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:24,784
GLANCING AROUND

160
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:28,921
TAKING SO LONG
TO SEE IF ANYONE'S WATCHING HIM

161
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:34,694
THEY HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT'S HAPPENING BEHIND THEM

162
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:38,064
HE'S EARNING MONEY FAIR AND SQUARE

163
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:43,569
DOING SQUATS LIKE A MEERKAT

164
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,206
By the way, what's Jonathan doing?

165
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:49,742
Sleeping? Maybe he's taking a nap?

166
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,646
Hey, he's doing something over there.
Let's go get him.

167
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:56,282
BUSTED

168
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:57,450
Let's get that punk.

169
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:58,985
He's doing something over there.

170
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:00,086
That sly punk.

171
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:02,488
You're doing exercises alone, you bastard.

172
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:05,224
You're doing exercises alone, you bastard.

173
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:08,394
THE MEERKAT GOT BUSTED

174
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:13,833
Hey, this punk's sweating!

175
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,368
He's sweating!

176
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:18,271
INCONCEALABLE EVIDENCE OF EXERCISE

177
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:20,573
-No. It's not like that.
-I can't believe you!

178
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,241
How much did you earn?

179
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:23,910
-Not much, seriously.
-How much?

180
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:25,812
-Show us. How much is it?
-Not much!

181
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:26,879
So how much?

182
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,815
-Hey, follow me.
-Okay, follow us.

183
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,050
-Come here.
-I had a stomachache, for real.

184
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,652
Hey, act friendly.

185
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:35,521
-I wanted to poop. I can't even poop here?
-All right, come here.

186
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:36,656
How much?

187
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:38,124
-How much?
-Tell us honestly.

188
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:42,562
After I went to the restroom,
I did exercises and earned 1,000 won.

189
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:45,198
THE AMOUNT IS OBVIOUSLY TOO SMALL

190
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:47,900
-Geez. Take off your shoes.
-Tell us where your money is.

191
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,602
-Take out the insoles.
-There's nothing there.

192
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,003
-Hey.
-I'm not lying!

193
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,039
Where's your money? Tell us now.

194
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:55,741
-Per 10 won, you get a punch.
-Tell us where your money is.

195
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,477
-I don't have any.
-A punch per 10 won.

196
00:07:57,543 --> 00:07:59,712
-Tell us. Now.
-Seriously.

197
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:01,447
-He's hiding a lot here.
-Take off your underwear.

198
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:03,015
-Where did you hide it?
-No.

199
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:04,517
-Stay still.
-There's nothing there.

200
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,719
-Is it in here?
-Look, he's hiding a lot.

201
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,221
-Where is it?
-Where is it?

202
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,291
-Where? Tell us now.
-I'm not hiding any.

203
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:13,526
Why put your hand in there?

204
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:14,727
Is it in there?

205
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:16,462
We're not taking it away.

206
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,331
Just be honest and put it all in here.

207
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:19,532
Where was it?

208
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,600
TAKING OUT 1,000 WON

209
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,768
Take it out now.
Don't make us put our hands in there.

210
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,304
Hey, why do you have so much?

211
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:26,372
+ 1,000 WON

212
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,441
You punk, how much do you have?

213
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:32,512
<i>They're such bad people.</i>

214
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:36,015
<i>They ganged up on me in the alley</i>
<i>and tried to take my underwear off.</i>

215
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:37,717
EMOTIONAL

216
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:39,018
This is

217
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:42,021
what I got after I played fair and square.

218
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:44,524
-Lift this a bit.
-Is there another pocket in there?

219
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,025
This punk has more!

220
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,561
IN THE END, HIS HAND GOES IN DEEP

221
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,730
Aren't you supposed to be the bank
that protects me?

222
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:52,131
Hey, there's money in here.

223
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,066
PROTECT YOUR MONEY YOURSELF

224
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,369
-Hey.
-Got more?

225
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:57,637
Do you have about 5,000 won?

226
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:58,871
I don't have any more.

227
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:01,173
-I think you have more.
-I don't, honestly.

228
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,309
Guys.

229
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,945
I'll tell you the total sum for now.

230
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:08,414
<i>You have earned 11,640 won in total.</i>

231
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:11,017
<i>We can have a meal</i>
<i>if we put it all together.</i>

232
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,452
Let's have a meeting

233
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,820
about lunch.

234
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,723
SO JONATHAN HAS A LOT OF MONEY?

235
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,992
So Jonathan, sit down.

236
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:21,694
Go ahead.

237
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,696
Let's say you have 7,000 won…

238
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:24,864
-Okay.
-…and I have 1,000 won.

239
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,567
-Then you have much more than us.
-Right.

240
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:30,570
So I'm suggesting you spend
your money for us to eat.

241
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:32,405
That we all eat together.

242
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:35,675
In return, to acknowledge your efforts,

243
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:39,712
we'll support you to make you
win the keychain at the end.

244
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:42,081
How will you do that?

245
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,417
In the end, the one with the most money

246
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:46,686
-wins the keychain today.
-Right.

247
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,422
So I'm saying we'll make sure
you win it today.

248
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:51,757
-I'm suggesting that we all eat equally.
-Right.

249
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:53,693
Like communism.

250
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:57,863
A DEAL THAT SOUNDS SO TEMPTING AND SWEET

251
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:02,768
BUT CAN HE REALLY TRUST THEM?

252
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,805
Then I need something that'll guarantee

253
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:07,106
I won't be betrayed.

254
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,208
Since I only have 1,000 won, I've already

255
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,610
lost the will to compete.

256
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:14,113
Each of you give me 500 won, then.

257
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:16,916
-As a deposit?
-Yes.

258
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:17,984
Put down a deposit.

259
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:21,220
-Why do I have to give it to you?
-What happens then?

260
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,989
-I have much more than you, right?
-Right.

261
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:25,458
If you don't keep your promise, I take it.

262
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:29,862
<i>I was trying to make him spend his money</i>

263
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,297
<i>to eat without exercising.</i>

264
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,432
No deposit, no deal.

265
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:34,667
There's no deal.

266
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:37,403
<i>I'll humor them for now</i>
<i>and raise the deposit later.</i>

267
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,505
<i>What are they going to do</i>
<i>if I lay down the rules?</i>

268
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:42,208
<i>I mean, we can never trust each other now.</i>

269
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,511
THE DEPOSIT IS ONLY 500 WON?

270
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:47,279
Hey, I'll pay the deposit.

271
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,983
-So when we eat, you have to pay for me.
-Okay.

272
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,152
-Give me 500 won. I'll give it to DinDin.
-Open it.

273
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,521
<i>I realized how to make money.</i>

274
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:58,357
"Seriously, I'm going to win
a second keychain," I thought.

275
00:10:58,424 --> 00:10:59,692
Did it feel like easy money?

276
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:00,893
It did.

277
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,196
I'll collect the money and pay for them,
and I'll still have some left.

278
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:06,899
<i>I thought Daniel should pay 2,000 won.</i>

279
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:08,567
Four cup noodles.

280
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:09,635
Kimchi to share.

281
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,070
A big bottle of something to drink.

282
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:13,039
And dumplings to share
with your 2,000 won.

283
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:14,106
Okay, with my 2,000 won.

284
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,307
CURRENT AMOUNT: 11,640 WON

285
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:19,512
DANIEL, DINDIN, O3OHN, JONATHAN

286
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:20,579
Let's get busy.

287
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:22,281
Let's work and earn money.

288
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:27,520
I'm dying for a cup of sports drink.

289
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:29,221
I need sugar.

290
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:33,359
-Where's the convenience store?
-Go out, turn left, and go straight.

291
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:34,794
I really need some sugar.

292
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,262
HE ONLY HAS 2,300 WON

293
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,464
Let's see what they have.

294
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:40,700
Ice cream? Hold on.

295
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:44,804
But ice cream is expensive these days.
How much are they?

296
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,005
Let's see.

297
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:51,444
I don't think
I even have enough to buy a Goo Goo Cone.

298
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,212
I should go check how much it is.

299
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:57,917
Hello. Could you scan this
to see how much it is?

300
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,785
-That's 2,500 won.
-What…

301
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:01,187
It's 2,500 won.

302
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:02,455
-2,500 won?
-Yes.

303
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:03,522
TAKEN ABACK

304
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:06,592
Is there anything
that's "buy one, get one free"?

305
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,160
-Is it "buy two, get one free"?
-Yes.

306
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:11,163
HE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE ENOUGH
TO BUY THIS ONE GOO GOO CONE

307
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:13,733
Gosh, hold on.

308
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:17,403
I need to earn 5,000 won, then.

309
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,105
Just to have that ice cream.

310
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:22,875
<i>I like Goo Goo Cone so much.</i>

311
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:26,178
<i>I like it better</i>
<i>than any other ice cream cone.</i>

312
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:29,582
STARING AT HIS MONEY

313
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:31,383
Goo Goo Cone will definitely sell.

314
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:35,955
<i>I thought I should buy and sell them</i>
<i>to the others.</i>

315
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:37,389
It's 5,000 won for three.

316
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:41,093
If I sell it for 2,000 or 2,500 won,
it's a sweet deal.

317
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,262
Okay, let's do this.

318
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:44,697
WISHFUL THINKING, ON

319
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:48,400
<i>So I did squats like crazy</i>
<i>in front of the store.</i>

320
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,102
Six, seven.

321
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:51,937
Eight, nine.

322
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:53,739
PUZZLED

323
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:56,108
<i>I named the operation "Goo Goo Coin."</i>

324
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:58,944
<i>I'll make money with this "coin"</i>

325
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:00,446
<i>and outdo Jonathan.</i>

326
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:01,514
Three Goo Goo Cones.

327
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,115
HE FINALLY GETS THE SEED MONEY

328
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:04,183
It's so rewarding.

329
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,085
Even if I sell one for 2,000 won…

330
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,721
Since I bought them for 5,000 won…

331
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,323
EXCITED TO THINK THAT HE'LL EARN MONEY

332
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:13,626
Seriously…

333
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,461
-Yes.
-Three Goo Goo Cones.

334
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:17,730
I'll just eat one first.

335
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:21,200
EXCLAIMING

336
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:24,436
SWEET TASTE OF CAPITALISM

337
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:28,140
NOW LET'S MAKE A DEAL

338
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:30,075
Hey, he bought two ice cream cones.

339
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,344
-No, three!
-What?

340
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:35,281
O3ohn, how much is the ice cream?

341
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:36,415
Bro.

342
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,083
-What is this?
-How much is it?

343
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,385
-I'll sell it for 2,000 won.
-What?

344
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:42,021
I bought it for 2,200 won,
but I'll sell it for 2,000 won.

345
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:44,490
-That's too expensive.
-No.

346
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:46,659
-It's 2,200 won.
-No, hold on.

347
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:48,594
If we don't buy them, they'll melt anyway.

348
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:49,929
-Right. I won't buy it.
-No thanks.

349
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:52,631
WHAT?

350
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:53,732
-I won't buy it.
-Not eating.

351
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,367
-As you wish.
-I won't buy it.

352
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:56,836
It's 2,000 won.

353
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:58,037
I won't buy it.

354
00:13:58,103 --> 00:13:59,104
Come on.

355
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,106
-Make it 500 won.
-What?

356
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,775
No, I bought them with my money.

357
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,376
So make it 500 won.

358
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,679
-Jonathan, it's 2,000 won.
-Yes?

359
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:08,948
Jonathan, if we don't buy them,
they'll melt anyway.

360
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,282
Okay.

361
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,685
Besides, I like World Cone better.

362
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:14,320
All right, let's let them melt.

363
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,591
And how much did you say
you bought them for?

364
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:19,658
2,200 won each?

365
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:21,560
-Yes.
-That's "buy two, get one free."

366
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:22,862
Do you take me for a fool?

367
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,565
Hold on, I'll go put them in the freezer.

368
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,634
Gosh, what a fool.

369
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:31,503
Darn it. I should've just bought
something cheap.

370
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,240
That was all for nothing.

371
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,908
No one's willing to buy it.

372
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:38,644
<i>The strategy was wrong.</i>

373
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,746
<i>Gosh, this is so frustrating.</i>

374
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:42,448
Darn it, I'm screwed.

375
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:45,217
A MENTAL STATE OF A PERSON
WITH A FAILED INVESTMENT

376
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:46,485
I'm so screwed.

377
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:47,553
STAGE 1: LETHARGIC

378
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,488
I have another plan.

379
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,323
I'll try again when they crave sugar.

380
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,826
STAGE 2: WISHFUL THINKING

381
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,862
Gosh, I should've
just bought something cheap.

382
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:58,197
Can I get a refund?

383
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:59,265
STAGE 3: REGRETTING

384
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:00,466
You egged me on.

385
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:01,533
STAGE 4: BLAMING OTHERS

386
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,601
Should I just steal it?

387
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:03,669
STAGE 5: CRIMINAL ACTIVITY

388
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,671
They'll want it when they crave sugar.

389
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,706
STAGE 6: MORE WISHFUL THINKING

390
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:12,177
I should do it when they're not doing it.

391
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,213
-Count it for me.
-Okay.

392
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,648
FORTUNATELY, BACK TO EXERCISING

393
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:19,385
I'll work hard

394
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:21,287
and save up.

395
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:24,189
I'll get back on my feet
and make a deal with something else.

396
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:26,525
It won't work like this.

397
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,093
HE HAS 100 WON, BUT HE'S DILIGENT

398
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:31,897
MEANWHILE, JONATHAN SEEMS TO BE RICH

399
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:33,365
-Fifteen?
-I have 15,000 won.

400
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:34,800
The taste of money!

401
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,268
If you have a lot of money?

402
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:38,504
You don't need a plan.

403
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,072
No plan.

404
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,610
Now, I need to earn 3,000 won

405
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:45,978
before lunchtime.

406
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:47,780
I'll buy lunch with the money.

407
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:50,249
-Oh, and put that money aside?
-Yes, I'll put it aside.

408
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:51,951
LUNCH WITH JUST 3,000 WON?

409
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:53,352
What we agreed on

410
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:56,121
are four cup noodles,
a big drink, and kimchi to share.

411
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:58,223
-And dumplings.
-Dumplings.

412
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,391
Okay, that's it.

413
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,893
-Yes.
-Okay.

414
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,629
HE'S RICH BUT BAD AT MATH

415
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:04,863
Okay.

416
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,432
Don't you want ice cream?

417
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:08,133
Will you sell it for 100 won?

418
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,736
Darn it. I won't sell it.
I'll just have it.

419
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,071
Wait a second.

420
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,007
-Aren't you going to have lunch?
-I am.

421
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:17,009
But you didn't pay much.

422
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:18,577
I paid 500 won.

423
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,878
Everyone else paid 2,000 won.

424
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:21,380
Hold on a minute.

425
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:22,448
Pay 1,000 won now.

426
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:23,515
I can't trust you.

427
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:25,184
Those who paid 2,000 won,
what do they get?

428
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,286
Cup noodles, kimchi,

429
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,121
-a big bottle of something to drink.
-Drink?

430
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:30,556
IS THAT SO?

431
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:33,192
-I get to eat the same with 1,500 won?
-Yes.

432
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:35,361
-Deal.
-Yeah.

433
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,696
It's a good deal for me, then.

434
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:38,998
Of course.

435
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:41,433
-Anyway, I got your back, man.
-Okay.

436
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,668
RIPPED OFF BUT STILL GOOD

437
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:47,806
SO EXCITED AFTER EXTORTING JUST 1,000 WON

438
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:51,910
Damn it. What a thug.

439
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:54,913
THE TWO ANCHOVIES START WORKING OUT

440
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:01,053
WHILE SOMEONE WATCHES THEM
FROM A DISTANCE

441
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,189
OBSERVE

442
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:10,662
LOOKING VERY SUSPICIOUS

443
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,203
Let's go.

444
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:21,373
DINDIN HEADS SOMEWHERE

445
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,479
HEADING TOWARD THE PLACE
THAT EVERYONE EXPECTS

446
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:41,994
What if someone steals my ice cream?

447
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,295
What a fool.

448
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:47,866
Someone's eating something in there.

449
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,169
SOMEONE'S RUNNING IN

450
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:54,073
-You came.
-Hey.

451
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,675
No, no. That's an e-cigarette. Gosh.

452
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:58,744
It's prejudice.

453
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:01,213
-You came.
-Hey.

454
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,347
Have an ice cream.

455
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,416
-Where's it? Okay.
-In the freezer.

456
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:07,519
Hey, you should share
something so delicious.

457
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:08,887
I'm keeping an eye out for him.

458
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,592
Damn it. I'm so worried.

459
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:15,627
Should I keep them in another bank?

460
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:19,998
Wow, this is so good.

461
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,968
I must come out of poverty first.
My Goo Goo Cones…

462
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:24,736
HAVING A BAD FEELING

463
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:26,205
I'll go check.

464
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:27,940
Hold on.

465
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:33,645
RUNNING BAREFOOT
AFTER HAVING A BAD FEELING

466
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:38,851
He's coming!

467
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,401
You're barefoot?

468
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,003
Yes. I was in a rush.

469
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,872
MISSED THE TWO THIEVES BY A WHISKER

470
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,175
Damn it!

471
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:04,710
Those crazy bastards.

472
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:06,311
Seriously.

473
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,382
GOO GOO COIN DELISTED

474
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:13,685
Damn it! Those crazy bastards.

475
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:15,654
Seriously.

476
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:20,225
Whose is this?

477
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:23,862
LET'S RUN WITH
THE THIEF'S BELONGINGS FOR NOW

478
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:25,864
Whatever. I'll just take it.

479
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:27,399
Crazy bastard.

480
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:29,234
How dare you eat my ice cream?

481
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,137
SO THRILLING

482
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:34,573
O3ohn's gone.

483
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:37,743
What?

484
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,378
ACTING INNOCENT TILL THE END

485
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:43,282
THE THIEVES CAUTIOUSLY COME OUT

486
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:47,486
Oh, shoot!

487
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,723
He ate it all, but he's busted.

488
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:53,492
That fool.

489
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,628
My God. I can't believe they ate them.

490
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:58,997
<i>I was doomed.</i>

491
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:01,867
I never thought those lunatics
would eat all of my ice cream.

492
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:04,102
<i>I have to survive on my own.</i>

493
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:06,071
<i>I can't expect teamwork.</i>

494
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:09,308
I'm so mad. There's no team today.

495
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:11,210
Give me back my deposit.

496
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:12,744
-What?
-Give me my deposit back.

497
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:13,812
Why?

498
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,114
-Someone ate my ice cream.
-Yeah?

499
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:18,016
There's no team today.

500
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,818
-Give me my 1,500 won back.
-Hold on.

501
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,353
I don't need kimchi or a drink.

502
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,121
-You don't need kimchi?
-No, give it back.

503
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:24,957
-Now.
-Give you your 1,500 won back?

504
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:27,159
I can't. I already received it.

505
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,395
Wait a minute, O3ohn.

506
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:32,898
Hold on. O3ohn, hold on.

507
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:35,267
DESPISING HUMAN BEINGS,
HE REFUSES TO HAVE A CONVERSATION

508
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:38,003
-Listen. Those two…
-Okay.

509
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:41,373
-Give it back!
-Give what back?

510
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:43,508
Give what back?

511
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:44,610
My money.

512
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:46,011
No, that's mine.

513
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,247
Give my money back!

514
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,749
-Your mouth smells sweet.
-What do you mean?

515
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,052
MURDEROUS LOOK

516
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:55,454
Give this back.

517
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,356
Anyway, I'll get my deposit back.

518
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,790
Okay. Give me my 1,000 won back.

519
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:01,627
I'll leave the alliance
and get 1,500 won back.

520
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:03,195
-Seriously?
-I'll do it on my own.

521
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,131
I told you, you already paid,
so you can't get it back now.

522
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:08,166
What kind of team retreat is this?

523
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:09,601
What's wrong?

524
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:12,204
-What's going on?
-You said you'd give it back.

525
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,739
-I'll give it to you.
-Yes, give it.

526
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:16,541
-He's such a fraud.
-Give it to me now.

527
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:17,876
Here.

528
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,144
I've given you 1,500 won.

529
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:20,212
-Okay.
-Let's go.

530
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,546
As we decided,

531
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,582
three cup noodles since he's left.

532
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:24,650
O3ohn's out?

533
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:26,184
-He wants to eat on his own.
-He's out.

534
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:27,519
-Really?
-Yes.

535
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:28,787
-I'll do it on my own.
-Let's go.

536
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:29,855
Let's go.

537
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:31,890
-Okay. Cup noodles, kimchi…
-Kimchi…

538
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:32,958
-…dumplings…
-…dumplings…

539
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:34,026
-…a drink.
-…a drink. Okay.

540
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:36,161
10 MINUTES AFTER THEY WENT
INTO THE CONVENIENCE STORE

541
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:38,964
Goodness, the prices are so…

542
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:40,499
Hold on a second.

543
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,968
Hold on.

544
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:46,438
Are you okay?

545
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:50,108
Why is everything so expensive?

546
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:53,445
In any case, you have to pay 15,800 won.

547
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:58,150
HOW JONATHAN WENT BANKRUPT

548
00:21:58,216 --> 00:21:59,618
<i>I didn't know it'd be like this.</i>

549
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:01,987
<i>It's my fault, because I thought</i>

550
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:04,523
cup noodles would be 800 won each.

551
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:06,658
ACTUAL PRICE: 1,500 WON

552
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:07,893
<i>And 2,000 won for soda.</i>

553
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:09,294
ACTUAL PRICE: 3,800 WON

554
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:10,595
<i>And 2,000 won dumplings.</i>

555
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,364
ACTUAL PRICE: 4,900 WON

556
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:15,634
THE SUM GOES WAY BEYOND HIS EXPECTATIONS

557
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:18,704
It's 15,800 won.

558
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,773
<i>But when I saw it was over 15,000 won,</i>

559
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,176
<i>I thought I've been living all wrong.</i>

560
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:28,180
<i>I realized I was still so clueless</i>
<i>about the ways of the world.</i>

561
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:31,216
Now that I think about it,
it was an absurd deal.

562
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,720
-He suggested something so ridiculous.
-I know.

563
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:35,987
I mean, seriously,

564
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:37,956
what the heck?

565
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:41,226
-What was he talking about?
-I still don't understand.

566
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:43,462
I don't either, now that I think about it.

567
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:47,833
A DISASTER CAUSED BY A BAD DEAL

568
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:51,036
Something went very wrong.

569
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:53,472
-Oh, no.
-How much do you have left?

570
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,141
-Just 1,200 won?
-Yes.

571
00:22:58,176 --> 00:23:00,512
YOUR MISFORTUNE IS MY HAPPINESS

572
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:02,047
Just start exercising now.

573
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,850
I have enough money
to have a meal, actually.

574
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:07,552
-I have more than him.
-Shut up, dude.

575
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,655
AGAIN, YOUR MISFORTUNE IS MY HAPPINESS

576
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,694
Listen, Jonathan.
Let me give you a piece of advice.

577
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:18,864
You listen to DinDin too much.

578
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:22,267
The way it looks,
you'll end up in last place.

579
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,572
<i>It's so hard for me right now.</i>

580
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:28,940
<i>I'm so hurt.</i>

581
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:30,909
<i>He's so, so…</i>

582
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:33,111
<i>He's so mean.</i>

583
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:35,647
He brought this upon himself.

584
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:37,949
He paid over 10,000 won alone.

585
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:39,851
Geez.

586
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,588
I'm better than him, then.
I lost 5,000 won.

587
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:45,424
He lost over 10,000 won.

588
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,092
So I'm better off.

589
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:49,227
Enjoy your lunch.

590
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:50,562
Enjoy.

591
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:51,630
Enjoy, everyone.

592
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:56,334
HAPPINESS FROM 2,000 WON

593
00:23:57,402 --> 00:24:00,071
HAPPINESS FROM 1,500 WON

594
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,943
HAPPINESS FROM PAYING HIS OWN MEAL

595
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:08,447
DEPRESSION FROM PAYING 15,800 WON

596
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:09,781
Wow, it's so good.

597
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,752
It's so meaningful today.

598
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:15,320
I made so many good memories.

599
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:16,688
We talked a lot

600
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:18,156
and got to know each other better.

601
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:19,224
SILENT

602
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,927
Having such a feast with just 1,500 won.

603
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:27,766
Jonathan, smile a little, will you?

604
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:29,167
-It's delicious.
-I know.

605
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:30,335
Enjoy.

606
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:32,637
JONATHAN HAS LOST ALL LAUGHTER

607
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:34,372
-Eat up!
-Okay.

608
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:35,474
You punk.

609
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:38,009
All right. Tell me honestly.

610
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:39,411
How much do you have?

611
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,479
I have zero won.

612
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,581
I have 5,000 won, for real.

613
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,483
-I have zero, honestly.
-5,000 won.

614
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,218
I have 1,000 won.

615
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:48,687
How much do you have?

616
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:51,122
-I have 1,000 won.
-That's a lie.

617
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:52,924
I think he really only has 1,000 won.

618
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:54,559
Let's eat up,

619
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:56,528
-and let's not betray each other.
-Right.

620
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:58,964
Since this is a retreat, let's enjoy it.

621
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,632
Let's make a toast.

622
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:03,969
-All right, to Jonathan!
-To Jonathan!

623
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:05,670
Jonathan, I hope you win today.

624
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:10,075
REMINDING THEMSELVES AGAIN
OF THE MEANING OF THE RETREAT

625
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:11,142
Everyone,

626
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:12,911
while you're enjoying your lunch,

627
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:14,646
I'll just tell you the total sum.

628
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:16,882
-The total sum?
-Yes.

629
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:19,551
It's 12,300 won in total.

630
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,321
Someone has more than what they said.

631
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:26,625
SILENT

632
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:30,195
You guys have 12,300 won in total.

633
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:32,998
Seriously, every word you say…

634
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:34,699
God, I can't believe this.

635
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,737
I called a truce just now,
and you do this?

636
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:40,805
DinDin, tell us right now.
How much do you have?

637
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,707
-Seriously.
-I have 5,000 won.

638
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:45,310
-You have 5,000 won? I really have none.
-Yes.

639
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,678
There's no way.

640
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:47,779
What do you mean?

641
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:51,917
-What? I really have no money.
-He has none.

642
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:53,418
-How much do you have?
-I have 2,000 won.

643
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:55,287
Come on, stop lying.

644
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:01,126
THE RETREAT IS GOING SO WELL

645
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:07,232
Let's take a nap.

646
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:09,834
-I'll nap.
-After getting changed.

647
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,369
Okay, get some rest.

648
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,773
Anyway, how could you not know the prices?

649
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:16,308
Are you an idiot?

650
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:19,511
Let's just take a nap.

651
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:22,380
Let's nap.

652
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:27,552
PEACEFUL NAP TIME

653
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:35,126
FORGETTING REALITY,
HE'S HAVING TIME TO HEAL

654
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:39,130
LAUGHING

655
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:42,367
WEIRD NOISE COMING FROM SOMEWHERE

656
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:48,306
DANIEL IS EXERCISING ALONE

657
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,941
I'm so tired.

658
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:55,380
Okay.

659
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:57,349
Give me the money.

660
00:26:57,415 --> 00:26:59,084
CRAZY ABOUT MONEY, HE GAVE UP ON THE NAP

661
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,151
Give me the money.

662
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:07,726
HE GETS A SUDDEN SURGE OF DOPAMINE

663
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,194
You want the drama-show version?

664
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:13,598
The reality-show version.

665
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,569
The drama-show version.

666
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:21,072
He's good. That's so good.

667
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,140
DANIEL IS IN TOP FORM

668
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,009
But

669
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:26,778
how should I make them spend on dinner?

670
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,413
That's the problem.

671
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:30,749
-Spend what?
-Their money.

672
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,051
LOOKING FOR HIS NEXT DOPAMINE RUSH

673
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:34,119
Seriously.

674
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:36,655
Can I have one of the drinks?

675
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,158
Sangdon.

676
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:42,093
What happens if I have one of them?

677
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,795
All of your money will be confiscated.

678
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:47,198
LAUGHING

679
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,536
There's no drink left in here.

680
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:52,704
POURING WATER IN AN EMPTY CAN

681
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:54,472
Where's Jonathan?

682
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:58,576
JONATHAN'S STILL HEALING HIS WOUND

683
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:03,682
ON HIS WAY TO LET OUT HIS DOPAMINE

684
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,151
Jonathan.

685
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,656
I bought these two for 500 won.

686
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:13,058
-Really? Let me have a sip.
-Have one.

687
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:14,125
-Thanks.
-Sure.

688
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,260
Get some rest.

689
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,196
INTENTIONALLY TAKES A DRINK FIRST

690
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:21,733
GULP

691
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:25,737
Jonathan.

692
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:28,106
-Jonathan.
-Yes?

693
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:29,808
Is the drink good?

694
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:32,744
What? He must've conned him.

695
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,249
For God's sake…

696
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:39,784
HOW COULD YOU BE FOOLED AGAIN?

697
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:41,086
Jonathan.

698
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:42,687
I told you not to trust anyone.

699
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,356
HAVING A BLAST

700
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:49,160
You can just pay the price for it.
Taking all your money would be too harsh.

701
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,595
Shouldn't all his money be taken?

702
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:52,397
That's what you told me earlier, Producer.

703
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:54,265
But you virtually conned him, man.

704
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:56,935
-How much is it?
-1,400 won.

705
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:58,870
This is 1,400 won?

706
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:00,605
That drink is expensive.

707
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:03,274
I'm going to cry.
Stop saying such ridiculous things.

708
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:05,410
I won't pay. I can't.

709
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:06,978
Hold on, you won't pay?

710
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:09,147
I'm not going to pay it. Never.

711
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:10,882
Then, just 1,000 won.

712
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:12,417
Yes, pay 1,000 won.

713
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:14,652
-Take 1,000 won from him.
-Seriously, this is so…

714
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,123
HE GETS CONNED AND GETS 1,000 WON TAKEN

715
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:22,327
DESPISING HUMAN BEINGS TO THE MAX

716
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:25,296
I have 1,000 won left now.

717
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:28,466
I told you not to trust anyone.

718
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:32,537
<i>Jonathan's so naive.</i>

719
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,939
You grow as you get played.

720
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:39,177
In life, a bit of negativity
promotes growth.

721
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:40,812
<i>He will grow.</i>

722
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,716
Oh, go away!

723
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,518
O3OHN COMES OUT

724
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:47,585
All right.

725
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:49,020
-O3ohn.
-Where did you get that?

726
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:50,355
-Did you buy it?
-Yes.

727
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:52,357
-Where? How much is it?
-You're so thirsty.

728
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:53,992
It's 200 won.

729
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:56,227
-It's 200 won per can?
-I'll go buy it.

730
00:29:58,396 --> 00:30:00,732
VICTIM 1 IS SILENT

731
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:04,068
THE PERPETRATOR IS EXCITED AGAIN
TO FOOL ANOTHER ONE

732
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,472
Give me the drink.

733
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:12,010
HIS DOPAMINE NEVER RUNS DRY

734
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:17,415
O3ohn.

735
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:20,218
-A new one? Did you go to the store?
-Yes.

736
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:22,320
-I bought it for 200 won from the staff.
-For real?

737
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:23,955
-Thank you.
-I got it for you.

738
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:25,623
You must have a lot of money.

739
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:26,724
WITHOUT ANY SUSPICION

740
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:32,664
Of course, I can do this much for you.

741
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:37,569
All right. O3ohn.

742
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:39,470
You drank it, right?

743
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:40,972
SMILING AWKWARDLY

744
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:45,877
THE HAPPY CON MAN

745
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:50,081
HOW COULD YOU BE FOOLED AGAIN?

746
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,016
Hey, it's 1,700 won.

747
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:54,152
For God's sake, what's wrong with you?

748
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:01,626
We'll take 1,000 won from you as well.

749
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:04,262
This is so annoying.

750
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:07,966
DinDin and Daniel are villains.

751
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,401
You see, after he ate my ice cream,

752
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:12,837
I started thinking of destroying him.

753
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:16,741
I'll steal his money or whatever it takes.

754
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:19,744
-Then, I'll handle Daniel.
-Yes.

755
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:20,812
Okay.

756
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,313
-You handle DinDin.
-Okay.

757
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,548
Let's shake hands.

758
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:25,383
-A pact?
-Okay.

759
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,485
-A pact without money, okay.
-Okay.

760
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:30,188
Just five more. One…

761
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:32,290
THE DESIRE FOR REVENGE GIVES HIM STRENGTH

762
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:33,391
My friend.

763
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:34,993
Why are you doing it here?

764
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,694
The sand's all over you.

765
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:40,031
To prepare against a con man,
I should work harder.

766
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:42,767
I mean, how else can I beat a con man?

767
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:45,436
All right, Daniel.

768
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,071
Well,

769
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:49,974
do you want to make bigger money?

770
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:51,042
How?

771
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:53,077
We're men, so something physical.

772
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:54,345
No, I don't like physical.

773
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:55,480
Get my question right.

774
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:57,348
I can't trust anything
that comes out of your head.

775
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,583
It's all trash.

776
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,920
All right. Or something from the staff.

777
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:03,054
-A question for both of us?
-Yes.

778
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:04,689
Okay, let's do it.

779
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,891
Then have DinDin join too.
Let's do it together.

780
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:10,328
Hey. How about we all bet our money

781
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:12,263
and the winner takes it all?

782
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:13,898
Okay.

783
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:15,600
-All right.
-Let's do it.

784
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,602
BETTING QUIZ GAME
1,000 WON PER ROUND

785
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,204
So, 1,000 won each?

786
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,240
-Put them in the center.
-Okay.

787
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:23,942
3000-WON PRIZE FOR GUESSING CORRECTLY

788
00:32:24,475 --> 00:32:25,476
Why do you have so much?

789
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:27,278
-When did you save it?
-When?

790
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:29,447
I never saw you exercise.
When did you save this much?

791
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:31,282
Gosh, I can't believe you.

792
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:33,117
WHEN DID DINDIN SAVE UP SO MUCH MONEY?

793
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:34,385
30 MINUTES AGO

794
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,387
What's he doing? Is DinDin really asleep?

795
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,589
-Yes.
-I guess he was really tired.

796
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:42,393
WHERE'S DINDIN WHO WAS TAKING A NAP?

797
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:44,996
HE'S EXERCISING?

798
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,598
<i>I believe there's a mission.</i>

799
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:48,933
<i>I'm sure of it.</i>

800
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,437
<i>I should have some money to compete.</i>

801
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:53,972
EXERCISING TO MAKE MONEY FOR GAMES

802
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:56,474
<i>I should wait for a chance</i>
<i>for me to join the competition.</i>

803
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:58,509
<i>I'll seize it and win.</i>

804
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:00,578
<i>I'll make a good investment and win.</i>

805
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:02,480
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT

806
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:03,982
The first question.

807
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:06,050
The show you're on now,

808
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:07,518
<i>Anchovy Physical Camp,</i>

809
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:08,853
when will it be released?

810
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,921
-DinDin!
-Jonathan!

811
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,656
-DinDin was faster.
-At 8 a.m. on Friday.

812
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,157
Correct.

813
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:14,425
Damn it.

814
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:18,329
Where's your love for the show?

815
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:20,064
Do you guys want to keep going?

816
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:21,833
-We should.
-Of course!

817
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:23,534
Suddenly you have a chance to be rich.

818
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:26,104
-Only those who have the money join.
-I'll go all the way.

819
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,739
-I placed my ante.
-I'm in.

820
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:30,074
-Give me the money!
-This is a rare chance.

821
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:33,478
Who are the five main characters
in <i>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</i>?

822
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:34,545
-DinDin.
-Me!

823
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:35,713
-DinDin.
-Me!

824
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,983
Guan Yu, Zhang Fei,
Liu Bei, Cao Cao, Zhuge Liang.

825
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:40,518
Correct.

826
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,089
GO AGAIN

827
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:47,191
-Okay.
-Do you have money to bet?

828
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:48,826
I have 300 won left.

829
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:50,428
Then you want out, O3ohn?

830
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,231
What a fraud.

831
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:55,433
What the heck? You got some more.

832
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:03,341
The K League 1 standings of 2025.

833
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:05,076
-Say first, second, third places.
-DinDin!

834
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:06,778
DinDin!

835
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:08,479
Jeonbuk, Gimcheon,

836
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:10,648
and Daejeon.

837
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:11,716
Correct!

838
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:15,987
It seems like
your financial status has changed a lot.

839
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,622
I'm so screwed.

840
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,624
I lost everything.

841
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,793
A GAMBLER WHO LOST EVERYTHING

842
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:24,295
THE ONE WHO SUGGESTED THE GAME HAS LOST IT

843
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:27,632
Goodness, he has so much money.

844
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:29,500
I had such a good meal with 1,500 won

845
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,269
and earned good money now.

846
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:33,604
Goodness.

847
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:35,373
DIAL 1366 TO REPORT ILLEGAL GAMBLING

848
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,909
Goodness.

849
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:40,578
Hold on. I got three questions right,

850
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:43,448
-so I earned 9,000 won.
-Yes, 9,000 won.

851
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:46,517
<i>It's amazing it went as planned.</i>

852
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:51,322
<i>To tell the truth, I didn't really</i>
<i>think about winning the keychain today.</i>

853
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:53,458
<i>But I got ambitious</i>
<i>and thought I should go for it.</i>
