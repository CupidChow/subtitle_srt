00:00:01,901 --> 00:00:03,703
All right, guys, have lunch now.

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,305
-Let's go.
-All right!

3
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:08,141
Wow, look at that.

4
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:10,377
Let's dig in.

5
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:11,745
Let's feast on this.

6
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:13,013
Nice, bulgogi.

7
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:18,451
This is <i>doenjang</i>, and that's kimchi.

8
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:22,889
It's so good.

9
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:25,225
"RICE AFTER A WORKOUT IS THE BEST"

10
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:26,326
It's delicious.

11
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:30,096
Wow, this really is so good.

12
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:31,498
All right, everyone.

13
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:34,567
You now have 7 hours and 40 minutes left.

14
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:36,369
Why does time go by so fast these days?

15
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:39,739
No, we've already done
a third of the total count.

16
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:41,007
Right.

17
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:42,509
You can take a nap if you'd like.

18
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:43,843
Would you like to?

19
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,345
-We will.
-Yeah.

20
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:47,614
-And we'll think about whether to ring it.
-The ring?

21
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:50,483
"RING WHAT?"

22
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,685
I'll win the keychain today,
no matter what.

23
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:54,988
He's never been this serious.

24
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,357
Jonathan must really want to
win the keychain.

25
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:59,359
What do you mean, ring it?

26
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:00,994
Daniel, if you ring the bell today,

27
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,729
Jonathan will ring sense into you.

28
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:05,265
-He'll punch you.
-Listen.

29
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:07,634
As soon as he turns around
after ringing it…

30
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:11,204
I'll punch him right away like this.

31
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:12,772
I'll use the move that I've learned.

32
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:15,909
Anyway, we can't do that.

33
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:18,378
How about we nap
for just about 30 minutes?

34
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:20,080
-Let's take a short nap.
-All right.

35
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:21,648
"NAP TIME"

36
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:26,619
My goodness.

37
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:28,388
Oh, my back.

38
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:30,356
It hurts so much.

39
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:32,358
My back is seriously killing me.

40
00:01:33,893 --> 00:01:34,961
I'll ring the bell.

41
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:38,164
I'll really ring it.

A WHILE AGO

52
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:11,764
I don't think I'll be able to do
another burpee if I nap.

53
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:12,832
Then let's do this.

54
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:16,236
Us three will take a nap for an hour
while you keep at it.

55
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,771
How about you do 400 by yourself
while we take a nap?

56
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:21,007
-The keychain will be yours then.
-That's right.

57
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:23,676
I'm not taking a nap in any case.

58
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:25,044

-No.

The keychain is what proves
that you did your best.

Everyone else has one.

64
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:48,468
I'm the only one who doesn't.

65
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:49,636
Just me.

66
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:52,138
So I have a lot on my mind.

He's still doing it.

97
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:56,629
Wait, is he still at it?

00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,266

He's done 190.

-Wow.
-By himself.

102
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:07,774
It'll be nice to make it to 200.

That's his sweat.

-He did 200.

-I'll ring it.
-You're incredible, Jonathan.

116

117
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:51,584
Don't ring it.

118
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:53,486
-Don't do it.
-My back hurts so much.

-Don't ring it, please.
-You're exhausted.

-No, no.
-I'll end it for you.

00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,192
No, please!

123
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:01,494
Jonathan didn't make a fist like this.

124
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:04,997
Because I'm serious.

125
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:07,533
Look at him sweating!

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,668
You know what?

127
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,205
How long did it take me to do 200?

128
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:13,473
About 30 minutes.

129
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:15,641

00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,340
-Wow.
-He's in the lead now.

140
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,641
He did 700 by himself.

141
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,877
-He's so cool.
-Wow.

142
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:53,146
Will the total be 2,500 if we do 200 more?

143
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:55,348
Does that mean we have 3,500 left?

144
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,418
Daniel usually becomes

145
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:00,987
-really positive in the second half.
-Not today.

146
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:02,989
So why has he become so evil today?

147
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:04,123
My back hurts so much.

148
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,925
-Back injury, huh?
-My iliopsoas hurts.

149
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:07,794
Come on, we have to finish it today.

150
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,295
Well, let's do the V4 thing first.

151
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,631
We'll do 200 more,
and play a deduction game.

152
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:13,399
-All right.
-All right.

153
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:14,734
Let's go.

154
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:16,469
-I'll go first.
-Okay.

155
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:19,705
O3ohn and I will go next then.
You go last, Jonathan.

156
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:21,674
Let's go. Let's go, Daniel.

157
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:23,776

-You ready?

158

-Let's go!
-Let's go!

159
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:26,946
I got this!

160
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:31,184
Oh, man, it's so much harder
after the nap.

161
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:35,288
It's no joke.

162
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:37,623
Oh, no.

163
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:41,894
-Two.
-My legs already feel so heavy.

164
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,095
-Three.
-Three.

165
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:45,731
All right.

166
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,567
Let's go, DinDin!

167
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,135
Damn it!

168
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:50,503
You're feeling it, right?

169
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:53,940
-Okay. Two.
-He's feeling it in his muscle.

170
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,741
You can do it!

171
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:56,809
Four.

Seven.

Oh, man. Hold on.

Eight.

00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:15,061
-Nine.
-My legs feel so hot.

180
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,532
Goodness, my back!

181
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,666
Eight.

182
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,270
-Eight.
-You go.

183
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,404
How many are there left?

184
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:26,772
You have 32 left until the deduction game.

185
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:27,907
Okay.

186
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:30,843
"THE ANCHOVIES END UP TIRING OUT"

187
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:38,117
I think it's highly likely
that we'll ring the bell today.

188
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:40,052
You think so too, right?

189
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:42,388
-Seriously, 6,000 burpees are too many.
-Hey.

190
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:44,123
We have 3,500 more left after this.

191
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,691
Man…

192
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:48,861
Damn it, my body's not waking up.

193
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:56,068
Four.

194
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,771
Five.

195
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:01,307
"JONATHAN'S DOING MORE FOR THE OTHERS
WHO ARE EXHAUSTED"

196
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:02,808
Seven.

197
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:04,944
Eight.

198
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:07,313
There we go.

199
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,382
"SHAKING"

200
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:12,418
-I feel so sad.
-Three.

201
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:13,786
His legs are giving out.

202
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:19,592
One.

203
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:21,827
Two.

204
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:23,996
LAUGHING

205
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,408
WHAT NOW?

206
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,478
Why are you laughing?

207
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:41,180
What is it?

208
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:43,616
My heart breaks, but it's so funny.

209
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,384
I just remembered Jonathan saying,

210
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:49,722
"I worked so hard, so why do I always
come in second or third?"

211
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:52,224
It just flashed through my mind.

212
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:54,994
Nine.

213
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:58,831
-Ten.
-How many has Jonathan done?

214
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:00,166
This breaks my heart.

215
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:02,401
So O3ohn's done four less than he has.

216
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:05,571
Seven.

217
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:08,741
"JONATHAN'S WILL REMAINS UNBROKEN"

218
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:10,242
Nine.

219
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,914
<i>I didn't want to give up,</i>

220
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:19,085
<i>but there were so many burpees left</i>
<i>and I was already so exhausted.</i>

221
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:21,787
<i>But watching Jonathan trying so hard</i>

222
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:22,989
<i>truly moved me.</i>

223
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,590
<i>I thought, "Let's give it a try."</i>

224
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:25,658
Two.

225
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:26,892
<i>I feel sorry for him.</i>

226
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,828
<i>He's been working so hard,</i>

227
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:31,564
<i>but he's ended up in third and second.</i>

228
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,367
<i>He didn't want to give up</i>
<i>because he'd worked so hard.</i>

229
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:36,769
<i>I felt bad for him,</i>

230
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:39,005
<i>so I decided to go for it</i>
<i>as much as I could.</i>

231
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:41,440
Just do 20 more.

232
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:42,508
Wow, DinDin.

233
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,778
-This is no joke.
-Nine.

234
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:48,414
Done!

235
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,249
Man, we did our best.

236
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:54,420
"400 BURPEES COMPLETED"

237
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,323
All right, everyone,
you're working so hard.

238
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,991
How many are on the line?

239
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:01,327
-It's a deduction of 400.
-Yes!

240
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:02,528
Let's keep the momentum.

241
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:06,499
This game to test your slapping power
is called "Absolute Ddakji."

242
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:08,300
-Oh, <i>ddakji.</i>
-Oh, <i>ddakji.</i>

243
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:09,468
I'm good at it.

244
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,137
-I used to play it a lot.
-Wow.

245
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:12,705
Now, in this game,

246
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:16,842
you have to flip over
all of the four <i>ddakji</i> we've prepared.

247
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:18,644
You'll try in turn,

248
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:21,213
and anyone who succeeds
will be given additional attempts.

249
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,281
-I see.
-Nice.

250
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:24,316
-Awesome.
-If we fail after flipping three over,

251
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:25,451
what happens then?

252
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,986
Then it would be a failure.

253
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:28,854
So it's 400 or nothing?

254
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:29,955
That's correct.

255
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,057
"ABSOLUTE DDAKJI" FOR A DEDUCTION OF 400

256
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:32,925
<i>But you can make your own </i>ddakji<i>.</i>

257
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:34,126
<i>Really? We can make it ourselves?</i>

258
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,961
Let's see.

259
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,763
You need to make it puffy.

260
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:40,566
It needs to be sturdy and stiff.

261
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:43,769
Just one sheet won't do.
We should make it with several sheets.

262
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,005
Do it like you're folding a box.

263
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:47,840
You know,
like when you're folding a paper box.

264
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:50,142
A packaging box, you know?

265
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:53,012
It shouldn't be too big.
It's not good to hit with.

266
00:11:57,683 --> 00:11:58,951
It's good.

267
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:01,353
He made a bomb.

268
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,922
I think I'm good with this.

269
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:04,423
-Are you done?
-I'm done.

270
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,659
It's nice and puffy,
and the size is perfect.

271
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,528
A TOTAL OF FOUR DDAKJI

272
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:10,996
LEVELS OF DIFFICULTY:
LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, VERY HIGH

273
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,165
-Okay.
-Daniel will go first.

274
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,267
-I'll go first.
-Daniel will go first.

275
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,036
Let's go, Daniel!

276
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:19,505
I used to be the King of <i>ddakji</i>
back in the day.

277
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,441
I was the King of <i>ddakji</i> in Cheonho-dong.

278
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,643
-Wow.
-I dominated. I won them all.

279
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,245
I should watch him closely.

280
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:28,013
Here I go.

281
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,248
You may begin.

282
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,659
"SUCCESS!"

283
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:42,695
Wow!

284
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,130
Yes!

285
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:46,899
"THE KING OF DDAKJI"

286
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,801
There's nothing that can't be done!

287
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:51,470
This reminds me
of the look on Jonathan's face.

288
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,076
"FAIL"

289
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,381
See? Now it's not looking good.

290
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:05,017
This is not good.

291
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:06,585
"CURRENT SITUATION"

292
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:07,653
Let's go, DinDin!

293
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,189
-Let's go!
-Let's go, DinDin!

294
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,091
-You got this.
-Flip it over!

295
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:13,526
One per person.

296
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,466
"SUCCESS"

297
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:24,403
I knew you could do it!

298
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,471
Nice!

299
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:27,840
It flipped twice.

300
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,043
It flips more than once
when you hit it hard.

301
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,344
Right, so it's not easy.

302
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:36,081
-I think it's up to God's will.
-It's a matter of luck.

303
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,117
-But it's more likely…
-Seriously.

304
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,486
-…to flip over when you hit hard.
-Right.

305
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:42,955
So risking it is better
than not flipping it over at all.

306
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:45,191
-It's better to trust God.
-That's right.

307
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:47,626
-Jonathan, pray that it'll flip over.
-We'll have to pray to God.

308
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,500
Let's go.

309
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,635
"FAIL…"

310
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,305
See?

311
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:01,774
-It did flip.
-Yes, it flipped twice.

312
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,743
Jonathan, we STILL flipped over one each.

313
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,178
All right, let's…

314
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:08,547
Let's go, O3ohn.

315
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:10,182
O3ohn, you just need to flip one over.

316
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:11,450
Let's go, O3ohn!

317
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:13,552
Flip it over, please!

318
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:14,887
Okay, I got it.

319
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:18,924
"FAIL…"

320
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:20,626
It went up and flipped.

321
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:21,694
It flipped twice.

322
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:25,965
-Jonathan, your fate is up to you.
-Jonathan.

323
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:30,202
You have to create your own fate.

324
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:32,404
Jonathan, your fate is up to you!

325
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:34,540
O3ohn!

326
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:36,976
I don't think I can do it.

327
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,310
What's this?

328
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,712
I can't do it.

329
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:41,247
-I can't do it.
-Jonathan.

330
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:43,048
Your fate is up to you.

331
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:45,551
I really want him to succeed.

332
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:47,519
Don't do it.

333
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:49,255
-I'll just hold it.
-Don't.

334
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,991
-I want to motivate you to do your best.
-Okay.

335
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,058
"THEY'RE GETTING CLOSE
TO RINGING THE BELL"

336
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,961
-I'll ring it if you fail.
-I don't think I can do it.

337
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:57,463
I'll ring it if you fail!

338
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:59,732
Hey, it's been six hours now.

339
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,101
Here I go!

340
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,344
"SUCCESS!"

341
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:18,117
-Wow!
-Let's go!

342
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,685
Let's go!

343
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:20,886
"THEY REGAIN THEIR HOPE"

344
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:23,489
See? I told you it'd motivate you!

345
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:27,393
But this one looks too hard to flip over.

346
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:29,028
Just do as you did, Jonathan.

347
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:30,562
Hey.

348
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:33,799
-Just do as you did before.
-That's right.

349
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:34,867
Don't let it fool you.

350
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,002
-Don't let the thickness fool you.
-I'm hitting it with this, right?

351
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:39,138
Jonathan, do you want a practice round?

352
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:40,873
-A practice round?
-Do it.

353
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,207
Just try it once.

354
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,909
Okay, I'll go for a practice round.

355
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:45,444
But even if you flip it over,
it won't count…

356
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:51,150
I did it! Doesn't that count as a success?

357
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:53,152
Please say it counts!

358
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,254
-It's a success.
-Just do what you just did.

359
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:56,755
Just hit it as you did.

360
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:58,190
You have nothing else, right?

361
00:15:58,257 --> 00:15:59,892
"WHINING"

362
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:00,960
Hey!

363
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,530
-Don't whine like a loser.
-Okay!

364
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:05,965
-Focus!
-Okay!

365
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:07,466
Stop whining like a kid
and just go for it!

366
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:08,667
But it was a success.

367
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:09,735
Let's go!

368
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:14,273
If I flip this over, promise me
that we'll finish the burpees.

369
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,075
-Okay.
-Okay, I'll think about it.

370
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,142
"DEAD SERIOUS"

371
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:18,444
Okay, I promise.

372
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,678
I won't give up.

373
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:21,747
Seriously, if we win this game,

374
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,849
-let's try until the end.
-Let's do that.

375
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,517
Plus, we've recovered a bit.

376
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:28,087
If you succeed in flipping it over,
then God is on your side.

377
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,154
Seriously.

378
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,093
WHAT WILL BE

379
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,828
JONATHAN'S

380
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:38,030
FATE?

381
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,699
Don't be nervous.

382
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:09,828
"LAUGHING"

383
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:10,963
What is this?

384
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:13,532
It turned mid-air.

385
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,634
I flipped it over in the practice round.

386
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,270
I told you to count it as a success.

387
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,672
I didn't even want a practice round.

388
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,810
I wanted to try right away,
but the producer had to suggest it.

389
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,814
I'm going to be honest.

390
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,283
We still have five hours left,

391
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,185
and the burpees are just
on a different level.

392
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:34,953
<i>I just felt it was impossible.</i>

393
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:38,357
<i>Doing 6,000 burpees was simply impossible.</i>

394
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:41,126
<i>I want to be realistic</i>
<i>than feel bad for Jonathan.</i>

395
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:44,530
Everyone.

396
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:45,597
Listen.

397
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:49,301
We have another big deal waiting for you.

398
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:50,569
A big deal?

399
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:52,004
What kind of big deal?

400
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,238
It's a game with
1,000 deductions on the line.

401
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:54,306
What?

402
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:59,344
But when will we get that big deal?

403
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,612
After you do 200 more.

404
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:01,680
-Okay.
-200 more?

405
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,382
Let's just power through 200 burpees

406
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:04,917
and check out the deduction game.

407
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:06,518
-Right.
-We can think about the game later.

408
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:07,686
-Yeah, let's do it.
-Let's go.

409
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,421
Let's do 200 first and play the game.

410
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:12,157
If we win it, we might get fired up again.

411
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:13,892
-That's right!
-So let's do it.

412
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,494
-You can begin immediately.
-Let's do it.

413
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:17,029
Let's power through 200 burpees first.

414
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,400
When the producer mentioned
the "big deal,"

415
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:23,135
I heard, "Don't give up."

416
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,003
<i>Let's do this.</i>

417
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:27,239
-Daniel, you go first.
-Okay, here I go.

418
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:29,775
Okay, I should kick up the pace now.

419
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:35,147
"THE ANCHOVIES PLUCK UP ENERGY AGAIN"

420
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:42,988
Why are you doing so many, O3ohn?

421
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:44,056
To kick up the pace.

422
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:46,258
We need to finish 200 quickly.

423
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:47,926
<i>I could see hope.</i>

424
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:51,797
I'm winning the keychain today,
no matter what happens.

425
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,302
Eight.

426
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,172
GROANING

427
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:01,874
Nine.

428
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:05,277
DinDin, take it easy.

429
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:10,582
Hey, be careful with your joints.
You might hurt your wrists or ankles.

430
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:20,926
Done!

431
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:24,096
Done. My goodness.

432
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,131
I'm so done.

433
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:28,767
Man, I'm so done with this.

434
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:31,470
Three.

435
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:36,875
My wrists hurt.

436
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:40,345
-Be careful with your wrists and ankles.
-Okay.

437
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:49,721
My knees get swollen easily.

438
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:55,327
Three.

439
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:57,696
Four.

440
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,999
"GROANING"

441
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:04,670
Four.

442
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:07,539
Five.

443
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:18,951
Jonathan, let's get to the game.

444
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:21,353
Give me just a minute.

445
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,089
-I'll take over until then.
-Okay.

446
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,761
One.

447
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:32,798
Four.

448
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:36,835
Five.

449
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:39,137
You can do this.

450
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,575
Six.

451
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:47,579
<i>I could see the exhaustion</i>
<i>written all over their faces.</i>

452
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:50,048
<i>Plus, Daniel got injured.</i>

453
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:54,886
<i>I could feel that everyone was thinking</i>
<i>it was impossible to complete the mission.</i>

454
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:57,489
O3ohn, rest some more.

455
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,157
No, I've recovered.

456
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:00,659
No, just rest.

457
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,361
I'll do it.

458
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:07,332
<i>But they still kept doing their best.</i>

459
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:09,501
<i>I saw a flicker of hope.</i>

460
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:12,504
<i>I'll follow that flicker.</i>

461
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:14,940
200 BURPEES COMPLETED
A TOTAL OF 2,700 COMPLETED

462
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:16,475
All right, everyone.

463
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:19,311
As I said earlier,
the time has come for the big deal.

464
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:21,079
Okay.

465
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:23,382
A deduction of 1,000 is on the line.

466
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,318
This game will test your power.

467
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:28,353
Wasn't it similar earlier?

468
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,289
We already played
the watermelon smashing game last time.

469
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:31,823
Is it a <i>ddakji</i> game again?

470
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:34,693
The four of you
will play four different games

471
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,695
to complete four different missions.

472
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:38,430
-I see.
-The first mission is called

473
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,832
"Break the Double-stick Ice Cream."

474
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:41,900
I'm good at that.

475
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:42,968
Like this?

476
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:46,004
MISSION 1:
BREAK THE DOUBLE-STICK ICE CREAM

477
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:48,440
The second mission is called,
"Light a Match in One Go."

478
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:52,077
MISSION 2: LIGHT A MATCH IN ONE GO

479
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:55,614
The third mission is called
"Punch Out a Candle in One Go."

480
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:58,483
MISSION 3: PUNCH OUT A CANDLE

481
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,986
The fourth mission is called
"Flip over Absolute Ddakji."

482
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:02,454
Come on.

483
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:04,356
I'm confident in the match game.

484
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:06,958
-Oh, yeah?
-You must complete all four missions

485
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:08,560
to get the deduction of 1,000.

486
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:09,628
A 4-EVENT RELAY MISSION

487
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:11,563
<i>I'll give you 10 minutes to practice.</i>

488
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,165
<i>Please begin now.</i>

489
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:15,067
Jonathan, how about
you do the punching mission?

490
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:17,002
Yeah, I'll try punching out the candle.

491
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:18,103
He'll do the double-stick
ice cream mission,

492
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,771
I'll play the candle one…

493
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:21,373
-I'm doing the match.
-The match.

494
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,475
-And then he'll play <i>ddakji.</i>
<i>-Ddakji.</i>

495
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:26,144
One more thing.
Jonathan will do his mission last.

496
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:28,647
"HANDING OVER THE RESPONSIBILITY
WITHOUT FAIL"

497
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:30,349
-Sure.
-Let him go last.

498
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:32,150
Now, give them the practice tools.

499
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:34,853
-Let's win this game first.
-Yes, let's talk after that.

500
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,088
"LET'S GO!"

501
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:38,190
It's frozen quite hard.

502
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:40,359
Is there a time limit?

503
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:42,861
No, you just need to
break the sides evenly.

504
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:51,870
-Wow! He's so good.
-Wow!

505
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:55,507
-All right.
-And after lighting it up…

506
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:57,609
Jonathan, punch it hard.

507
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:58,777
-Okay.
-Okay.

508
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:01,046
-All right, just like that.
-Let's do it.

509
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:02,981
Okay, okay!

510
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,483
Let's win 1,000!

511
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,084
-Let's huddle up for a cheer.
-No fails, okay?

512
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:07,452
-Okay.
-No fails.

513
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:10,021
-We should do this.
-Jonathan, say what you want to say.

514
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:11,823
We're gathered here

515
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,825
-not to ring the bell…
-Right.

516
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,327
…but to win the keychain…

517
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,129
-That's right!
-…and to spread positive energy.

518
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:18,196
-Exactly!
-Yes.

519
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:19,364
We're here to do that.

520
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:20,499
-Okay!
-Okay!

521
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:23,435
<i>-Anchovy Physical Camp!</i>
<i>-Anchovy Physical Camp!</i>

522
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,504
Let's do this.

523
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,406
<i>I seemed like</i>

524
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:31,476
the missions were doable
and we had to clear them at all costs.

525
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:35,680
If we failed at winning the deductions,
it'd practically be over.

526
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:37,182
<i>It was 1,000 burpees on the line.</i>

527
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,350
-Do we start now?
-Are you okay?

528
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,051
-Right away?
-Please go ahead and begin.

529
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:48,960
Okay!

530
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:50,128
-First mission, success!
-Okay.

531
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:51,496
"1ST MISSION, SUCCESS"

532
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:52,764
-Okay.
-Here I go.

533
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:54,699
-Here I go.
-Let's go!

534
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,535
-Go straight away.
-All right.

535
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:57,736
All right.

536
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,604
Here I go.

537
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,199
"THEY FAIL TO GET A DEDUCTION OF 1,000"

538
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:28,266
Fail!

539
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:43,048
I'll ring it!

540
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:54,326
Jonathan.

541
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:55,694
"THE GG BELL RINGS FOR THE FIRST TIME"

542
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,962
Jonathan.

543
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:01,600
I'm sorry, Jonathan.

544
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:02,734
Jonathan…

545
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:05,670
Jonathan…

546
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:07,706
I really tried my best to flip it over.

547
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,342
I hit it as hard as I could.

548
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:11,409
He hit it really hard.

549
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:13,879
I really did.
It almost touched the ceiling.

550
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:17,582
Did he actually ring the bell?

551
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:20,352
I came to win the keychain.

552
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:27,425
Jonathan, this isn't the end for us.

553
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:29,261
We still have six missions left.

554
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:31,963
This is so sad but funny. What do I do?

555
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,332
My heart breaks, but it's so funny.

556
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:37,936
-Come on.
-It breaks my heart too.

557
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:42,307
Man, this is so funny.

558
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:43,808
All right, everyone.

559
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:47,212
We'll wrap it up.
Let's take out the table.

560
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,917
Jonathan, you still did your best.
I'm sure people know that.

561
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,586
The devilish full-body exercise,
the burpee test.

562
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:56,588
Today's training ends in a failure.

563
00:25:57,923 --> 00:25:59,958
Now, you'll each have an interview.

564
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:03,528
My goodness.

565
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:05,297
Ringing the bell is the worst.

566
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:09,334
I don't think I'll ever ring the bell,
not unless it's absolutely necessary.

567
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,802
It's the worst.

568
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,138
Man…

569
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,008
To be honest, this is the worst.

570
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,177
Today's the worst day ever.

571
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:21,980
You know,
this is our first time ringing the bell.

572
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:24,382
I can't really explain it properly,

573
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:26,751
but I think a lot of thoughts
were going through

574
00:26:26,818 --> 00:26:28,787
Jonathan's mind during that short time.

575
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:30,522
He probably couldn't say anything
being the youngest.

576
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:33,458
When we were taking a break
while preparing our <i>ddakji </i>earlier,

577
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:37,896
I saw Jonathan
sitting on the massage table

578
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:40,131
scanning each of us one by one.

579
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:43,168
"RIGHT BEFORE THE GAME
FOR A DEDUCTION OF 1,000"

580
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,184
I understand the situation now.

581
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:01,219
I get it now.

582
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:05,223
What a shame.

583
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:10,195
<i>He seemed to think,</i>
<i>"I get how exhausted you guys are."</i>

584
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:13,832
<i>After that,</i>

585
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:17,469
<i>he rang the bell</i>
<i>as soon as I failed the </i>ddakji<i> mission.</i>

586
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:19,838
<i>Man, I feel bad.</i>

587
00:27:19,904 --> 00:27:22,340
<i>I feel like he rang it</i>
<i>on behalf of everyone else.</i>

588
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:24,509
<i>I had a lot on my mind.</i>

589
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:25,710
<i>I feel bad.</i>

590
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:27,212
<i>It didn't feel right.</i>

591
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:29,981
<i>I feel like it'll be awkward between us</i>
<i>at the next shoot.</i>

592
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:33,051
<i>The reason I really</i>
<i>aimed to finish today is…</i>

593
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:34,953
<i>It was more for a personal reason.</i>

594
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:39,491
You know, everyone faces
some kind of dark phases

595
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:42,494
at one point or another in life.

596
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,764
<i>And by pulling through today,</i>

597
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:49,401
<i>I was hoping to feel</i>
<i>a sense of achievement.</i>

598
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:51,936
<i>It's also why I felt so drawn to this show</i>

599
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,605
<i>and why I've been giving it my best.</i>

600
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:57,175
But I feel like I've become

601
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:02,180
someone who can't accept reality well.

602
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:06,484
<i>I mean, we tried to keep going</i>
<i>because I insisted.</i>

603
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:09,320
<i>The others took pills</i>
<i>and got treated to continue.</i>

604
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:12,223
And since I was the one
who dragged it out,

605
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:14,526
I thought I should be the one
to ring the bell.

606
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,227
It was mostly out of regret.

607
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:18,096
Jonathan rang the bell himself,

608
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,998
and I feel so bad about that.

609
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:24,636
I think he was feeling
somewhat burdened today.

610
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,471
He worked harder than anyone,

611
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,473
<i>but he was feeling burdened</i>
<i>worrying about us.</i>

612
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,809
<i>And I feel so bad about that.</i>

613
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:34,312
He should be praised.
Why'd he have to carry the burden?

614
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,047
He's still so young.

615
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:39,551
He must've had a lot on his mind.

616
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:44,789
I don't know.
Jonathan worked so hard, and that…

617
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,524
makes me feel so bad.

618
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:48,860
He truly put everything out there today.

619
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:56,067
-Why are you crying?
-I didn't feel bad before, but now I do.

620
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:57,902
I feel so bad, seriously.

621
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,671
Damn it.

622
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,042
I feel so bad for him.

623
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:09,314
THE BURPEE TEST MISSION HAS FAILED

624
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,483
AND 2 WEEKS LATER

625
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:12,684
<i>My goodness.</i>

626
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:15,820
Who on earth is this for?

627
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:18,656
Just let us go, please!

628
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:20,458
Man, do you want to die?

629
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:24,496
Are you a sadist or something?
Why are you making us do this?

630
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:26,931
I mean, what exactly are you aiming to do?

631
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:29,901
I've learned from my mistake.
I shouldn't have rung that bell.

632
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:31,436
Everyone is a mess right now.

633
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:32,604
THE CONSEQUENCES OF GIVING UP
COMING SOON
