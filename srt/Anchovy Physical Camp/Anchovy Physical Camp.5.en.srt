00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:14,981
IT'S ALREADY THE DAY OF THE THIRD TRAINING

3
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:16,616
THEY'RE MEETING AT THE OFFICE

4
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,385
Why are we meeting here today?

5
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:20,787
-What will we be doing here?
-I have no clue.

6
00:00:21,654 --> 00:00:25,025
All right, everyone.
We'll reveal the third mission right away.

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,395
I'm so nervous.

8
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:29,496
Where are we today?

9
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:31,331
We're in Sangam,
at the Kakao Entertainment office.

10
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:32,665
We're in the office.

11
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:35,135
We're at the company
our production staff work for.

12
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,369
Right.

13
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:38,138
Today's mission is

14
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:41,441
an exercise that even busy people can do
whenever and wherever.

15
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:43,009
Could it be squats?

16
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:44,511
I don't think so.

17
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:45,678
It's the most classic

18
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:48,648
bodyweight leg exercise.

19
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:50,116
It's squats.

20
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:51,418
Right.

21
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:53,653
Today's mission is

22
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:56,289
to complete 6,000 squats.

23
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,358
-They must be insane.
-Come on.

24
00:00:58,758 --> 00:00:59,759
What?

25
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:01,294
They must be insane.

26
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,865
-The count keeps going up.
-They're seriously crazy.

27
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:08,301
Come on. 2,000, 4,000, and now 6,000?

28
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:09,436
That's insane.

29
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:11,304
I'm so bad at squats.

30
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:12,372
Look.

31
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,340
-Squats…
-Let's just ring this.

32
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:17,177
At this rate, we'll do 20,000 of something
for our last mission.

33
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,344
Gosh, squats…

34
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:22,282
I'm sure you know,
but leg exercises will destroy us.

35
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:23,550
We'll go home crawling like this.

36
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:25,585
-We'll go home crawling.
-Right, exactly.

37
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:26,753
We won't be able to walk.

38
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,254
We'll go home like this, seriously.

39
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:30,290
DANIEL LOOKS ESPECIALLY GRIM

40
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,127
I had knee surgery, so I…

41
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:35,829
HE'S BEEN STRESSING HIS KNEE CONDITION

42
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:38,965
I had knee surgery twice,
so I really can't do squats.

43
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,969

44
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:45,138
-Now, Daniel.
-Me?

45
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:48,308
-You had knee surgery twice, right?
-Oh, yes.

46
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:51,344
Therefore, Daniel will be

47
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,613
exempt from today's mission.

00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:08,361
All right. Carry on.

54
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:09,429
Get to it!

55
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:11,831

-What does that mean?

56

To fill in for Daniel who will be exempt,

57
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:17,403
we've called in another Daniel.

58
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,538
-What?
-What?

59
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:19,939
Kang Daniel?

60
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:23,042
Or maybe Daniel Henney?

61
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:27,947
ANOTHER DANIEL
WHO'S BEEN ON STANDBY FOR QUITE A WHILE

62
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:30,350
Maybe I should've taken some vitamins
before I came.

63
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:33,052
I'm worried.

65
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,457

-Oh, that Daniel!
-Why are you disappointed?

74
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:00,713
-I'm sorry, man.
-Can you welcome me a bit?

75
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,814
Sorry.

00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,286
-Nice to meet you.
-Who is he?

00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,254
He's Daniel from Germany.

79
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,225
I'm Daniel, a TV personality from Germany.

I'm also called Just Daniel these days.
Nice to meet you.

81
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,731
From what I know,

82
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:21,367
Daniel may look skinny,
but he works out a lot.

83
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:22,435
He's in great shape.

84
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:24,137
No, I'm really not.

85
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,739
-Do you do tae kwon do or hapkido?
-I do hapkido.

86
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:28,708
-Right, he does hapkido.
-Oh, really?

00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:36,049
because we struggle too much?

90
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:38,518
We'll give him an extra mission.

91
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:42,121
It's gutting 3 kg of dried anchovies
for 12 hours.

92
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:44,490
Wow, 3 kg of anchovies?

93
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:46,192
Gosh, his hands will stink.

94
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,261
Man, they're so big.

95
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:50,597
-Gutting anchovies?
-Your fingerprints will wear down.

96
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:53,499
-His hands will stink like anchovies.
-I know.

97
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,035
-Can he not go home if he fails?
-No, he can't.

98
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:59,038
Daniel, you can gut the anchovies there.

99
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:00,106
Okay.

100
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:01,541
But wait, Producer.

101
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,076
Did you have to sound so condescending?

102
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:05,812
-Come on.
-Please clean out the anchovies there.

103
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:06,913
All right.

104
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:09,182
First of all, for a standard squat,

105
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,184
your knees should reach a 90-degree angle.

106
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:15,088
This means that your hips and knees
should be parallel.

107
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:16,456
That's a perfect 90-degree angle.

108
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,324
So that's a standard squat.

109
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:19,559
Wow.

110
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:20,927
-I'll go wash my hands.
-Ready.

111
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,162

-Three. Four.

-Six.

00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:40,880
Seven.

00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:43,516
All right, let's get started.

Let's go straight to the deduction game.

-One. Two.
-Wow, O3ohn.

125
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:57,096
-You're doing well.
-Three.

126
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:58,798
-Four.
-He's in good shape.

00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,567
I feel so reassured.

180
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:43,403
"THE SQUAT MACHINE COMPLETES 70"

181
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:45,705
You see, Daniels are always good.

182
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:49,409
We Daniels are cut from a different cloth.

183
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:50,843
-How many have we done so far?
-220.

184
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:51,911
We've done 220?

185
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:53,946
-Let's get to the deduction game quickly.
-Yeah, let's go!

186
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:55,948
"TO 400 WITH THIS MOMENTUM"

187
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:57,650
-Man, DinDin's form is the worst.
-Three.

188
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,385
-Man, DinDin's form is the worst.
-Three.

189
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:00,686
"SO NOSY"

190
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,321
Hey, don't discourage him.

191
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,392
You should use the muscles in the back,
the hip muscles.

192
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:09,195
"RUNNING HIS MOUTH WITHOUT STOPPING"

193
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,964
You're messing
with the audio recording, dude!

194
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:16,335
So that much is acceptable?

195
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:17,570
But that's not 90 degrees.

196
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,238
-What's wrong with you?
-Come on.

197
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:22,008
What's wrong with him?

198
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,544
-Use your hip muscles…
-Hey.

199
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:27,747
Just do your job.

200
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:30,383
Let's not respond to him
as if there's a soundproofing wall.

201
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,818
Okay, okay.

202
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:34,320
Do you think they'll be okay
without their ace?

203
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:36,155
MUTED MOMENTARILY
TO PROTECT THE OTHERS' MORALE

204
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:37,390
400 SQUATS COMPLETED

205
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,692
-All right, you've completed 400 squats.
-Okay!

206
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,394
Today's deduction game

207
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,163
will not be played
by those of you exercising hard.

208
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,799
The one in the corner
who's gutting the anchovies,

209
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:49,135
Choi Daniel, will play it alone.

210
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,071
…Choi Daniel, will play it alone.

211
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,007
I'll be playing the game?

212
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:57,477
You'll be the only player.

213
00:07:57,543 --> 00:07:59,178
It's called King Daniel's Challenge.

214
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:01,914
-"King Daniel"?
-So I'm the king.

215
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,583
I'm the king today.

216
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:04,750
Daniel's Challenge?

217
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:08,521
<i>You'll get one Mercenary Chance</i>
<i>per anchovy trainee.</i>

218
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:10,723
<i>You should make the best use of them.</i>

219
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,625
Now, here's the first game.

220
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:14,293
400 squats deductions are on the line.

221
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,428
-Wow.
-400?

222
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,331
This game will test your muscle strength.

223
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:19,699
-Muscle strength?
-I see.

224
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:21,100
-I think he'll do well.
-Yeah.

225
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:23,169
It's called "One-on-four

226
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:25,271
Thigh Wrestling."

227
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:27,273
One-on-four Thigh Wrestling?

228
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,642
You'll be against four staff members.

229
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:34,180
But you can choose your opponents.

230
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:41,621
The ultimate intention of this game

231
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:45,525
is whether you'll become human garbage
or choose not to get the 400 deduction.

232
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:47,293
-We need to aim for the deduction.
-Right.

233
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,861
It's 6,000 we're talking about.

234
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:53,165
We've got to raise steam
since this is the first game.

235
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:54,467
We need to get 400 squats deducted.

236
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,568
KING DANIEL IS AT A CROSSROADS

237
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:58,604
I think of myself
as an intellectual person, a wise one.

238
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:00,206
I'm wise like Zhuge Liang.

239
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,012
All right. For the first opponent,

240
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:07,513
I choose

241
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,115
-Producer Jeehoon.
-All right.

242
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:10,683
-Producer Jeehoon.
-All right.

243
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,385
The new bride getting married soon.

244
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:13,886
"HE CHOOSES TO BE HUMAN GARBAGE"

245
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,187

246
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:16,689
<i>I knew we'd win,</i>

247
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:19,659
<i>and I didn't feel bad.</i>
<i>I thought we'd stand a good chance.</i>

248
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,929
We didn't choose women over men.

249
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:26,132
We just chose "people"
who we'd play against.

250
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:29,702
We just chose those with longer hair.

251
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:33,272
I thought he was wise like Zhuge Liang.

252
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,375
AND ACCORDING TO DANIEL'S SCHEME…

253
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:39,979
-Okay.
-Out!

254
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:42,515
"HE WINS EASILY"

255
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,649
Yes, right now!

256
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:45,318
<i>It was neck and neck,</i>

257
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:47,653
<i>so I thought it was actually fair.</i>

258
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,822
I spread out.

00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,891

260

BUT IT WASN'T OF ANY FUN

261
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:55,761
It wasn't any fun, so I'm thinking…

262
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:57,363
It was fun!

263
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,864
It was so fun!

264
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,733
How about a one-on-one duel
between the champions?

265
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,302
How about a one-on-one duel
between the champions?

266
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:05,938
Wait, who's best at this among us?

267
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:07,907
-Isn't it Jonathan?
-I think so too.

268
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:09,442
Do you want to give it a try?

269
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:11,510
Look, isn't his attitude so annoying?

270
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:13,913
Come on, let's just do this!

271
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,315
Hey, go crush him, seriously!

272
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:17,917
Let's do this. Come on out.

273
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:19,952
-Are you serious?
-Let's do this.

274
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:21,153
Come on now.

275
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,788
Make him cry like a baby.

276
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:26,092
He's always like this.

277
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:27,927
"What? If it's too tough, you do my job."

278
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:31,764
Jonathan, show us what you've got.

279
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:34,400
If the staff wins,
we'll only get 300 squats deducted.

280
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,369
-If we win, we'll get 500 deducted.
-500.

281
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:37,603
That's right. How does that sound?

282
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,405
I mean, the original deal
was 400 deductions.

283
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,606
So we have 100 at stake?

-All right!
-All right!

289
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,318
This is how you'll walk afterward.

290
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:56,689
Let's go, Jonathan!

291
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:59,025
-Bring it on!
-Show him what you've got!

292
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,793
All right, ready.

293
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,829
You got this, Jonathan.
Your pride's at stake!

"THEIR PRIDE IS AT STAKE"

295
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:09,602
Set, go!

296
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:16,909
HIS FACE IMMEDIATELY TURNS RED

297
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:18,944
THE ONE HOLDING WITH EVERYTHING HE'S GOT

298
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,647
AND THE ONE
TRYING TO PUSH OUT WITH A RED FACE

299
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:23,449
Close your legs! Close them!

300
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:26,352
ATTACKING WITH EVERY DROP OF HIS ENERGY

301
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,254
BUT THE DEFENSE IS AS STRONG

302
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,689
Wow, this is incredible.

303
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:31,924

HE TRIED HIS BEST…

307
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,144
BUT ALL HE GETS IN RETURN IS MOCKERY

308
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:55,581
A WOUNDED, FEEBLE MAN

309
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:58,584
<i>To tell you the truth,</i>
<i>I'd always wanted to teach him a lesson.</i>

310
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,986
<i>He was always so arrogant</i>
<i>and looked down on us.</i>

311
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,422
<i>We finally got the opportunity,</i>

312
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:05,224
<i>and I didn't want to miss it.</i>

313
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,093
I think he should build more muscle.

314
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,061
Just say it to my face.

315
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:11,697
-Why say it to the camera?
-No, no.

316
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,766
-So I should build more leg muscle?
-No, no.

317
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,968
<i>We'll deduct 500 squats.</i>

318
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:17,970
<i>We just started,</i>
<i>and the count's already at 900.</i>

319
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:19,905
Man, this is awesome.

320
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:21,707
Okay, okay. 900 squats, this is good.

321
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:23,175
-Okay, yes.
-This is great.

322
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,711
-All right.
-Let's go, Daniel.

323
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:28,013
One. Two.

324
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,915
Wow, he's got good form.

325
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:31,117
Two.

326
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,619
How does he manage that form?

327
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,789
You can stop if it gets too tough.

328
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,324
Take a break if it gets tiring!

329
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,259
-You can stop if you're tired.
-My pride's on the line.

330
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:42,461
-Good, let's go!
-Let's go.

331
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:44,029
He's gonna win the keychain today.

"ALREADY REACHING 50"

333
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,099
You can stop now.

334
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,869
<i>As I was doing it,</i>
<i>I became determined to beat them.</i>

335
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,004
<i>It was a matter of my pride.</i>

336
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:54,140
<i>I didn't think I'd be able to sleep</i>
<i>if I lost to them.</i>

337
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:55,307
Great form.

338
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,943
It really feels like I'm watching myself.

339
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,579
By the way,
do we get something if we succeed?

340
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,581
"SUDDENLY CURIOUS
WHILE FIGHTING FOR HIS PRIDE"

341
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:04,016
-We get to go home.
-We go home.

342
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,051
-We get to go home?
-Yes, that's right.

343
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,788
-It's about time he was curious.
-Right, right.

344
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:11,857
-"Why am I here?"
-"Why am I doing this?"

345
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:14,693
In my 17 years in Korea,
this is the worst reality check.

346
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,564
"What did you do, honey?"

347
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:20,866
"I did squats."

348
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,636
"And?" "Well, I did squats."

349
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:25,037
"What else did you do?"

350
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:26,405
"I only did squats."

351
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,142
"WHILE EVERYONE IS HAVING A GOOD LAUGH"

352
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:32,278
This is a lot of anchovies.

353
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:36,248
Gutting anchovies isn't any fun.

354
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:41,787
NO ONE RESPONDS TO HIM

355
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:44,323
BORED

356
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:49,695
What people call anchovy feces
is actually the guts.

357
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:52,364
If you pull this off,
you see the black thing, right?

358
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:56,268
"VLOGGING TO RELIEVE HIS BOREDOM"

359
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:59,004
Now, as you can see, it's clean.

360
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:00,439
No guts left, right?

361
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,608
This is how you do it.

362
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,876
SMILING

363
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,778
THERE'S FINALLY A VLOG VIEWER

364
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,379
BAE SANGWOO
CAMERAMAN FOR CHOI DANIEL

365
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:08,447
It's so big.

366
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,384
Isn't this a hairtail? It's so big.

367
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:14,587
All right, two hairtails.

368
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:16,188
"NODDING"

369
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:17,957
Three hairtails.

370
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,262
<i>I realized today</i>

371
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:25,598
<i>that on the set,</i>

372
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:30,336
<i>the only person I really interact with</i>
<i>is Sangwoo the cameraman.</i>

373
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,672
<i>I don't care if the other guys</i>
<i>don't pay attention to me.</i>

374
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:35,608
<i>I'll talk to Sangwoo.</i>

375
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,379
Cameraman Sangwoo, I love you.

376
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:45,784
-<i>How many do we have left?</i>
-<i>110.</i>

377
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:46,852
<i>That's great.</i>

378
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,589
DinDin, since you can't go down properly,
you have to go up all the way.

379
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,691
Okay, good.

380
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,060
Four.

381
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:56,996
-Five.
-Is he doing it right?

382
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:58,631
Six.

383
00:14:58,697 --> 00:14:59,765
-Seven.
-It looks so weird.

384
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:00,833
Eight. Go down a bit more.

385
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,101
-One.
-Okay.

386
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:03,702
"THE FORM DOESN'T QUITE LOOK RIGHT"

387
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,471
-That doesn't look right.
-That's…

388
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:07,139
It could be misunderstood.

389
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:09,208
DinDin, do you have a girlfriend?

390
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:14,179
Wow, I can see that

391
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,148
you are a playboy.

392
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,786
"AS BEFITS THE NICKNAME"

393
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,021
"Look at me!"

394
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,522
Darn, it's addictive.

395
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,861
"ADDICTED TO THE MOVE"

396
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:31,864
One. Two.

397
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,098
Wow.

398
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,235
THUMBS-UP WITHOUT A WORD

399
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:37,403
400 SQUATS COMPLETED

400
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:39,972
-Game? Good, let's play the game.
-Good job.

401
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:42,508
-This time, 200 is on the line.
-200?

402
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:44,143
-Only 200?
-Yes.

403
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:45,444
It must be easy.

404
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:47,613
This game will test your virility.

405
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,814
Gosh, seriously.

406
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,316
Virility?

407
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:51,450
Virility?

408
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:52,584
Virility? Hold on.

409
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:54,820
-Like what?
-Will you use your Mercenary Chance?

410
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,623
Guys like O3ohn are surprisingly strong.

411
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:00,859
-Guys like him are deadly strong.
-All right.

412
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:01,961
Let's ask him first.

413
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:03,562
Have you ever had a girlfriend?

414
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:06,598
Come on, man.

415
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:08,701
Look, when I pee,

416
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:10,703
it has to be somewhere wide open.

417
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,373
"IT'S NOT EASY GETTING USED TO THIS"

418
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,542
When I house-hunt,
I check how high the ceiling is.

419
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:18,444
Because my pee goes up, not straight.

420
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:21,847
You know, in the restroom
at a highway rest stop,

421
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:22,948
I paid for damage many times.

422
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:24,550
"HE'S INDEED STRONGMAN!"

423
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:26,452
-You paid for damage?
-Yes, I broke the toilet.

424
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:27,653
Well, I…

425
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:31,223
The girls who dated me…

426
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,392
"STOP IT, OLD MAN"

427
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:34,927
-I'm confident.
-Then show it to us.

428
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,028
-Yeah, you should do it.
-Should I?

429
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,263
-All right, I'll do it.
-Okay.

430
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,866
This game to test Choi Daniel's virility

431
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,035
is called "Feet Clapping."

432
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,505
In this game,
you'll sit on the edge of a chair,

433
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:48,440
put your heels together,

434
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:51,477
and clap the tips of your feet
for a minute.

435
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,346
If you can do
more than 200 claps in a minute,

436
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:56,348
it's said that you have strong virility.

437
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:57,816
Oh, really?

438
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:01,186
So if you do more than 200,
we'll deduct 200 squats.

439
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:03,322
-Wow.
-But if you do less, you fail.

440
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:04,656
Just do 400.

441
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,593
-Wait, what if I…
-Just do 400.

442
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:10,262
What if I end up doing 600?

443
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,997
I'll be on the news if I do, won't I?

444
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:14,800
If I do more than 600,
I might get a lot of DMs.

445
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,936
You can add this to your profile
in marriage agencies, right?

446
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,705
This is bad.

447
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,173
We'll set up the chair then.

448
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:24,009
Daniel, I'm sure
you'll do it effortlessly.

449
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:27,846
-I think it's doable.
-But what if…

450
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:31,517
What if they fly up
out of speed while I do it?

451
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:34,286
You can do this, Daniel.

452
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,188
-You got this.
-I'll show you.

453
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,956
-Okay, let's aim for 600.
-I'll fly away.

454
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:40,125
Ready.

455
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:41,293
-Let's go!
-Set,

456
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,861
go!

457
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:44,463
It's like a helicopter.

458
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,067
Man, he's good!

459
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:49,468
-He's so fast.
-He's good.

460
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,003
Wow, he's so good!

461
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,337
He'll make it to 600!

462
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,941
He's so good!

463
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:57,776
"THE VIRILITY MACHINE
EVEN KEEPS A POKER FACE!"

464
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:59,144
He'll really fly up at this rate.

465
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:00,712
"WILL 600 BE POSSIBLE AT THIS RATE?"

466
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:02,815
-He's too fast.
-Don't slow down!

467
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:04,383
You're doing well.

468
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,819
"AT FULL POWER!"

469
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:09,421
Hold on, maybe his ex-girlfriends
will contact him after this.

470
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,024
-Hold on.
-"How have you been, Daniel?"

471
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,661
-"I saw you on the show."
-You're making me lose focus!

472
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:16,895
"HE LOSES FOCUS"

473
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:19,531
-Daniel, you need to make it to 600.
-"It made me think of you."

474
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,800
-I'm getting tired.
-30 seconds passed.

475
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:24,670
"HE'S NOTICEABLY SLOWED DOWN"

476
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,907
Wow, I'm getting exhausted!

477
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:31,076
-It's no joke.
-No, Daniel.

478
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:32,978
"Can we meet?"

479
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:34,947
Oh, gosh! My thighs are burning!

480
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:39,918
Gosh, it's no joke.

481
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:41,353
Damn, it burns.

482
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,921
My inner thigh muscles are burning.

483
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:47,726
My goodness!

484
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:50,329
Tone it down!

485
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:51,430
Time over!

486
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:52,631
"1 MINUTE IS OVER"

487
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,970
Gosh, that was painful.

488
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,939
"KNOCKED DOWN AFTER JUST A MINUTE"

489
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:03,375
"Gosh, it's no joke!"

490
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:07,379
Seriously, it's no joke.

491
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:11,917
Now I see why it's related to virility.

492
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:15,187
All right then.
Should we check it with the video?

493
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:16,388
Goodness.

494
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:18,991
Five. Six.

Seventeen. Eighteen.

497
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:28,767
Should I try it while waiting?

498
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:29,835
Yes, you should.

499
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:32,004

Ready, set, go!

00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:38,243
He's like a kid.

502
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,311
It looks like kicking in water.

503
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:40,879

00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:50,756
"I saw you haven't changed."

507
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:58,297
I'll stop there.

508
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:00,666
Wow, Daniel did an incredible job.

509
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,569
What if he did more than 400?

510
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,504
I'll announce the result now.

511
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:06,638
Okay.

512
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:10,075
Virility Feet Clapping,
with a deduction of 200 on the line.

513

Choi Daniel,

514
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:15,681
you successfully did 205 claps.

515
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,584
-What a relief!
-205?

516
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,620
Hold on, that was only 205 claps?

517
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:23,322
It's a lot less than 600…

518
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,457
-Yes.
-…but you're still the Virility King.

-Okay, let's go.

00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,417
He's gotten so much better.

No, Daniel shouldn't do it.

584
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,067
He's far from being humorous.

00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:51,236

aren't very humorous.

Well, German jokes are a bit

588
00:22:57,609 --> 00:22:59,211
like German philosophies.

589
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:02,681

00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:16,595
"Why bother reading a cookbook?
You can't cook."

596
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:17,662
Then the wife goes,

00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:20,766
"What's wrong?
You watch porn all the time too."

00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,194
All right.

00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,795
The staff player for today is…

626
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:26,298

-Old Boy?

00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,067

-Who is it?

00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:41,546

631
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:43,148
He's your anchovy buddy.

632
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:45,350
He's my only friend here.

633
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:47,085
I can't fall out with him.

634
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:49,287
This is so sad.

635
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:54,125
It really feels like
I'm fighting against my only

636
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:55,894
-and best friend.
-You're enemies now.

637
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:58,730
I've never seen him laugh.

638
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:01,867
-He never laughs.
-He does.

639
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,871
-Trust me, he never laughs.
-So when we shoot,

640
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:07,672
and he laughs,

641
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:09,107
then I feel so proud.

642
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,443
-There's always someone like him.
-Yes, you're right.

656
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:38,203
-Because they're shell-fish.
-What? That's not funny.

Isn't it?

665
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:58,490
-It's funny, right?
-No, it's not that funny.

666
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,959
Well, what matters the most
is how you deliver the joke.

667
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:02,394
-I think it's funny.
-It's how you tell it.

668

You can't laugh
at the first three or four jokes, okay?

673
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:22,948
You can't laugh, even if it's funny.

674
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:26,918
-I won't.
-It won't be funny if you laugh.

675
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:28,954
-I won't laugh.
-No, listen.

676
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,655
If you laugh at the start, it's over.

677
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:32,357

00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:35,827
I get it, but what I'm saying is,

680
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,897
you have to hold out
for some time for it to…

681
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:41,066
I won't hold out. I just won't laugh.

682
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:44,502
He said he wouldn't laugh.
Why do you keep reminding him?

683
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:45,870
He says he never laughs.

688
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:56,014
It's already funny.

-We haven't started yet, right?
-We haven't.

690
00:26:58,516 --> 00:27:00,352
Can I laugh before we start?

691
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:02,120
-Sure.
-Can I?

692
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:06,958
It's already so funny.

693
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:08,026
"NOT REACTING AT ALL"

694
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:09,961
Look at him.
He's not even close to laughing.

695
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:11,096
He never laughs.

696
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:14,566
-Let's play fair, Sangwoo.
-Sure.

697
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:15,667
Don't laugh, okay?

698
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:17,736
For the first attack,

699
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:20,071
-I'll go with a weak joke.
-Okay.

700
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,506
"CHOI DANIEL ATTACKS FIRST"

701
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:24,309
You know, Daniel has dad jokes
saved on his phone.

702
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:27,812
What do you say

703
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:31,783
when you confess your love in China?

704
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,987
"THINKING HARD"

705
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:38,456
<i>Wo ai ni.</i>

706
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:43,795
"AN UNEXPECTED COUNTERPUNCH"

707
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:02,514
When you confess your love in China,
you say…

708
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:07,419
"I love China."

709
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,625
"HE'S STRONG"

710
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:16,061
<i>"Wo ai ni."</i>

711
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:21,733
All right.

712
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,867
"CHOI DANIEL'S 2ND ATTACK"

713
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:24,536
I'll go with a simple one.

714
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:27,005
What's a shark's favorite saying?

715
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,577
"JUST LOOKING AT HIS FACE IS FUNNY ENOUGH"

716
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:37,415
Boom Shakaraka.

717
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:40,452
Boom Shakaraka.

718
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:42,821
ANOTHER COUNTERPUNCH THROWN

719
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:45,023
HOLDING IN HIS LAUGH

720
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,506
His wrong answers are so funny.

721
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,176
A shark's favorite saying is…

722
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:06,945
"Man overboard!"

723
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:23,061
"OLD BOY ATTACKS CHOI DANIEL"

724
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,396
-You know cherries, right?
-Cherries?

725
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:26,998
-The fruit, you mean?
-Yes.

726
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:29,801
What do cherries say when you touch them?

727
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:31,970
When you touch cherries?

728
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:37,475
"Don't touch me"?

729
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,544
"HMM…"

730
00:29:40,845 --> 00:29:42,147
"Cherry blossoms!"

731
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,888
EVERYONE HOLDS IN THEIR LAUGHTER

732
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:06,237
SIGHING

733
00:30:08,706 --> 00:30:11,075
DANIEL, NO…

734
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:23,388
You almost held it in!

735
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:24,455
"DEDUCTION OF 200 FAILED"

736
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:26,224
-He sucks at this!
-Fail!

737
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:28,126
Damn it, this is the worst.

738
