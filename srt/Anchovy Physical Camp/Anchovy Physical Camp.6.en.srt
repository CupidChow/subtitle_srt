to get a deduction this time.

-That's the mission.

you can just come back.

-I'm sorry.

-Okay.

100
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,610

00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:05,878

This game to test Choi Daniel's memory

103

-is called the Real Name Quiz.
-What?

104
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,818
There's no way he'll get this.

105
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:15,555
In this game,
you must guess the real names

107
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:18,992
-This is insane.
-There's no way he knows.

108
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:22,262
<i>Please write down</i>
<i>the real names of the other trainees.</i>

109
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:23,763
Do any of them use stage names?

110
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:27,934
Do you seriously think
DinDin was a real name?

111
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,336
Isn't Kim DinDin your real name?

112
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:31,804
Let's just skip this quiz.

113
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,907
If you think back to the first day,

114
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:36,709
you asked each other's real names.

115
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:38,378
Really?

116
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:40,213
O3ohn, what's your real name?

117
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,614
-Junho.
-Oh Junho?

118
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:42,782
-Yes.
-I see.

119
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:43,850
Oh Junho?

120
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:45,551
Jonathan, what's your last name?

121
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,387
-Yiombi.
-Yiombi?

122
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,454
Yiombi?

123
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:51,324
-It's Jonathan Thona Yiombi.
-Tonawayom?

124
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,660
Jonathan Thona Yiombi.

125
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:54,794
Tonayom?

126
00:04:57,897 --> 00:04:59,632
Does it have to be
the full name for Jonathan?

127
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,668
-That's correct.
-Then he'll never get it.

128
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:03,269
I told you. I even explained--

129
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:05,138
Do we have to know your full name?

130
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:07,507
"SHOCKED"

131
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:10,109
-You don't, but we want the coffee.
-Right.

132
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:11,177
Hold on.

133
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,146
Jonathan, did you tell me too?
You didn't, right?

134
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:14,447
I did tell you.

135
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,215
I meant you when I said it earlier.

136
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:17,917
It's already obvious his memory is…

137
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:19,719
I'm telling you, he has dementia.

138
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:24,324
Jonathan Luther King.

139
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,594
I really don't remember.

140
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,597
This will probably get edited out anyway,
so let's get it over with.

141
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:32,999
All right, here.

142
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,133
Let's check your answers.

143
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,768
-Number one, "Park Solbin."
-"Park Solbin."

144
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:38,438
-Number two. Who's Kim Seongcheol?
-"Kim Seongcheol."

145
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,106
-DinDin.
-His name is Kim Seongcheol?

146
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,208
-Yes, Kim Seongcheol.
-Okay. "Seongcheol."

147
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:43,276
-Seongcheol.
-Next, Jonathan.

148
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,744
"Request."

149
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:47,113
-"Jonathan Request."
-"Request."

150
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,881
-And the next one?
-"Kim Ojum."

151
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:50,049
-"Kim Ojum"?
-Yes.

152
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:52,251
This is so hard.

153
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:55,054
From what I remember,
O3ohn's last name is Park.

154
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:56,122
Right?

155
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,193

Coffee is my joy of the day.

162
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:16,442
I need sugar.

163
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,044

Daniel, how does it feel
watching us from the sidelines?

167
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:31,391
Do we look like we're struggling at all?

168
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:32,792
Well, I feel bad

169
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:35,228

170
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:37,130
Right, you should feel bad.

171

I'm sorry. I'm so sorry for that.

You can do this.

173
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,937
To be honest,

174
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,806

<i>without being recognized,</i>

178
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:58,251
<i>and I failed in the quiz.</i>

179
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:00,086
<i>I lost at everything.</i>

180
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,387
<i>I felt so bad.</i>

181
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:03,556
2,600 SQUATS LEFT

182
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,391
Now, in this game,

183
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:07,927
a deduction of 300 squats is on the line.

184
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:09,862
-Okay!
-I feel so stiff.

185
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,298
-It'll test your destructive power.
-Destructive power?

186
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,467
-Destructive power?
-Will you use the Mercenary Chance?

187
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:17,403
Since Daniel does hapkido,

188
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,205
maybe he has
some destructive power in him.

189
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,307
I think I used it all up
while doing the squats.

190
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:23,042
Yeah, I think so too.

191
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,310
What do you want to do?

192
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:26,078
<i>At that moment,</i>

193
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:27,847
<i>I knew I was the only one who could do it.</i>

194
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:29,782
<i>All the others' legs</i>
<i>were already exhausted.</i>

195
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:32,618
<i>And I felt so bad,</i>
<i>so I wanted to win it no matter what.</i>

196
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:34,220
Well, I do have
a lot of energy left in me.

197
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,288
-I have enough to do this.
-Right.

198
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:36,756
I want to move so badly.

199
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:38,324
Right. Then let's…

200
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:40,760
-All right, let's leave it to him.
-We'll do the next one.

201
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:42,495
-I'll do this one.
-All right.

202
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:44,330
Now, I'll explain the game.

203
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:47,467
This game to test
Choi Daniel's destructive power

204
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:49,068
is called "Break the Chopsticks."

205
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:51,270
-Oh, with the buttocks.
-Oh, this?

206
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:52,805
-Yes.
-I think you'll do well.

207
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:55,341
<i>You must break 10 pairs of chopsticks.</i>

208
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,076
<i>All right, we'll set it up.</i>

209
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,245
This game isn't so easy for novices.

210
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:03,216
-What?
-Are you serious?

211
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:05,451
My goodness, this is too many.

212
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:06,752
I'll practice first.

213
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:09,655
Hold on. I should pull my pants up.

214
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:10,857
If the pants are too loose…

215
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,158
Pull it tight.

216
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:15,928
All right.

217
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,697
-You look so smart right now.
-I agree.

218
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:19,699
"TA-DA"

219
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:21,100
-I'll do my best.
-Seriously.

220
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,836
-I mean, I wasn't of much help today.
-Right.

221
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:26,639
I failed at everything, and I feel so bad.

222
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:28,374
All right, here I go!

223
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:29,709
Okay, please begin.

224
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,879
DinDin, put it
in the right position for me.

225
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:34,514
-This is the right position.
-Is it?

226
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,648
-Yes, it is.
-There?

227
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,450
Right below the buttocks
is a good position.

228
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:39,452
All right.

229
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,786
Let's trap it here then.

230
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,822
Let's trap it here.

231
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:44,423
No, no!

232
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,725
"APPALLED"

233
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,194
It's trapped now. Does it look okay?

234
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:50,129
Yeah, it looks quite stable.

235
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:52,365
Okay. Now…

236
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:53,966
TIGHT

237
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,601
ALL SET

238
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:57,103
-That's it.
-Okay.

239
00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:58,871
Here I go.

240
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,212
Damn it!

241
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,381
Wait a minute. I got a cramp.

242
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:10,683
Oh, man. This is no joke!

243
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,151
Man, this is no joke!

244
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:15,187
"BOUNCING"

245
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:16,289
-Did you get a cramp?
-Yeah.

246
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:18,190
-Oh, gosh.
-How do you relieve it there?

247
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:20,693
Come on, this is just impossible.

248
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,261
Hey, listen.

249
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:25,898
The thing is, you need to squeeze at once.

250
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:30,536
-Show us what you got.
-For 300 deductions!

251
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:32,538
-Get us 300 deductions.
-Hold on.

252
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,273
I'll be serious.

253
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,111
One, two.

254
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:43,749
STURDY

255
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:47,587
HIS THING IS CRYING

256
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:49,221
-It hurts so much here.
-Daniel.

257
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:50,890
-It hurts so much.
-Hey, Daniel.

258
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,224
-The chopsticks bent just now.
-They did?

259
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,594
Yeah, so when you first pull…

260
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,696
-Momentary strength is important.
-It must bend.

261
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:58,798
-Okay, that's perfect.
-Oh yeah?

262
00:09:58,864 --> 00:09:59,865
Here I go.

263
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:02,969
You're almost there.

264
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:08,307
-Daniel!
-Just a bit more.

265
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:12,645
I wanted to break the chopsticks
at all costs.

266
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:15,982
Even if my buttocks ended up getting torn,

267
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:17,350
I wanted to break them.

268
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:18,985
Oh, God!

269
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:24,724
I can feel your determination.

270
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:29,028
<i>I didn't even think about shame.</i>

271
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:33,032
<i>All I thought about was breaking them</i>
<i>to get the guys a deduction of 300.</i>

272
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,869
-Damn it.
-Daniel, just a bit more.

273
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:38,471
Oh, God!

274
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:39,805
Lord, please!

275
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:40,906
Lord!

276
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:43,209
Lord, please give me strength!

277
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,254
Where'd the chopsticks go?

278
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,824
"SHOUTING"

279
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:03,629
Wow, that was impressive.

280
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:05,031
I did it?

281
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,500
This is incredible.
I've never seen anything like this.

282
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:08,567
"BREAK THE CHOPSTICKS, SUCCESS!"

283
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:09,969
Wow, that was as nerve-racking
as the Olymp***.

284
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:15,107
"CAN'T HELP BUT
GIVE A STANDING OVATION"

285
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,509
-You're the best.
-That was amazing.

286
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:18,944
-Look at him sweating.
-Goodness.

287
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,515
I could feel your desperation just now.

288
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:24,450
I could see that you wanted to help us

289
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,951
-Yes.
-and that you felt bad.

290
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:28,421
-We felt the sincerity.
-Impressive.

291
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:30,256
-My wrists hurt too.
-His hands are red.

292
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,827
Wow, that was so touching.

293
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,164
At that moment,

294
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,633
<i>I could feel how sincere he was.</i>

295
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,269
<i>He's a man of his word.</i>

296
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:44,904
<i>He's tenacious.</i>

297
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:53,379
BREAK THE CHOPSTICKS, SUCCESS
300 SQUATS DEDUCTED

298
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:54,914
How many squats are there left?

299
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,048
You have 2,300 left.

300
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:57,883
-What? Yes.
-It's doable.

301
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,919
Hold on. We have 2,003 left?

302
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:01,821
We have 2,300 left? That's doable.

303
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,923
We'll do 400 now,
which leaves 1,900 squats.

304
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:04,990
Then we'll play another game.

305
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,093
If we get 400 deducted,
then we'll have 1,500 left.

306
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,428
We'll get another 400 deducted,
which leaves 1,100…

307
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,465
At this rate, we'll finish tomorrow.

308
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:13,599
There, German humor.

309
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,234
"At this rate, we'll finish tomorrow."

310
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,907
"At this rate, we'll finish tomorrow."

311
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:23,109
He made it funny.

312
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:24,376
That was funny.

313
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:25,444
Let's go!

314
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:27,646
One. Two.

315
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:29,115
-Wow.
-Three.

316
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:30,182
Four.

317
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,885
Good! Daniel did his best for us!

318
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:34,754
Wow, we've gained momentum.

319
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,188
Seriously. He's the best.

320
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,890
-Okay.
-One. Two.

321
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:41,961
Three. Four. Five.

322
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:47,133
"40?
YES"

323
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:48,334
Just 10 more.

324
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:51,170
Jonathan, you need to win
the keychain this time.

325
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:53,339
-Of course.
-It's your turn.

326
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:54,640
I'm the only one without it.

327
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:56,709
PUSH-UPS, 3RD PLACE

328
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,245
-What? How many did you do?
-Jonathan's third place?

329
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:00,880
Jonathan, 975.

330
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,014
SIT-UPS, 3RD PLACE AGAIN

331
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:07,052
Six.

332
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:09,421
He must want first place badly.

333
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:10,823
Give me the keychain!

334
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,058
He's done the most so far.

335
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,595
Wow, look at him go.

336
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:17,730
-Ninety.
-Ninety.

337
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:19,165
Just 10 more.

338
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,432
Okay, 100.

339
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:23,636
<i>All I have on my mind today</i>
<i>is winning the keychain.</i>

340
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,171
Last one!

341
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:31,277
-Thona Yiombi!
-That's incredible.

342
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:32,344
A hundred in one go.

343
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:34,013
That was insane.

344
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:37,149
-How many do we have left now?
-Good, good!

345
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:38,717
You have 190 left.

346
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:39,819
We have 190 left.

347
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,388
Jonathan, we have 190 left.

348
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:44,723
-Jonathan, 190 left.
-Do 190 in one go.

349
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,258
You want that first place!

350
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,828
-You'll secure it if you do this.
-Jonatha Thona Yiombi!

351
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:52,898
-One. Two.
-Oh, that's much better.

352
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:54,733
-Three.
-Good.

353
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:58,103
Jonathan, you always work so hard.
Why are you always in third place?

354
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,505
Four.

355
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:01,273
Five.

356
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,641
"I WON'T COME IN 3RD TODAY!"

357
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,044
You'll come in fourth place today.

358
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,046
No, I won't come in fourth.

359
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:09,048
I'm sure they're counting right.

360
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,850
You're in fourth place right now.

361
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,751
-Seriously? Man, I quit.
-Are you serious?

362
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:15,988
I don't want to do it anymore.

363
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:18,591
Are you sure you're counting correctly?

364
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:20,192
Is Jonathan seriously in fourth place?

365
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:21,460
But I did 100.

366
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,063
O3ohn, 647.

367
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:26,298
Daniel, 596.

368
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,133
DinDin, 594.

369
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,436
Jonathan, 563.

370
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:31,670
You're in last place.

371
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:33,539
I'm in last place?

372
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:37,176
Is Jonathan
always in third or fourth place?

373
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:40,746
I feel like I work my butt off,

374
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:42,781
but the result is always like this.

375
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:44,250
He even did 100 in one go.

376
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:46,418
-That's how life is.
-It's hard to swallow.

377
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:47,753
That's how life is.

378
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,922
This is so hard. It's mentally exhausting.

379
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,892
I mean, I try my best each day.

380
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,526
-You can do it.
-I really did my best.

381
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:56,629
-Jonathan, don't give up.
-Why am I in fourth place?

382
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:57,696
Jonathan.

383
00:14:57,763 --> 00:14:58,998
If you give up,

384
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,766
that's just who you are.

385
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:04,270
Do you want to be a quitter?

386
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:05,371
You sound so condescending.

387
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:07,973
If you give up,
you'll be in last place forever.

388
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,342
If you work harder,
you can become third place,

389
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,644
and even second place.

390
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,112
I want to come in first.

391
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:14,413
You can even come in first.

392
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,881
But you have to try.

393
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:18,617
If you give up now,
you'll just end up in last place.

394
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:19,852
<i>I thought I had no chance.</i>

395
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,888
<i>Each of the other trainees' faces</i>
<i>crossed my mind at that moment.</i>

396
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,427
Do you want to come in last like this?

397
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:30,629
Are you going to stop now?

398
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:33,098
Are you going to stop now?

399
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:34,867
-Let's do it.
-Let's go!

400
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,568
I'll be able to win the keychain, right?

401
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,304
I will, right?

402
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,139
-You will.
-Okay. I think I will.

403
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:42,708
-That's it.
-Good!

404
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:45,244
Oh, he's doing it.

405
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:46,879
Two.

406
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,647
-Three. Four.
-You can do this!

407
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:50,416
Twenty.

408
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:51,483
Thirty.

409
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:53,218
Seventy.

410
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,286
Ninety.

411
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:55,554
Just finish 100.

412
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,056
-Just three more.
-Three more.

413
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,158
Eight. Nine.

414
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:00,659
-Last one.
-A hundred.

415
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:02,461
Ten more, with all I've got.

416
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:03,662
I'll do it with all my might.

417
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:06,265
One.

418
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:07,366
-Two.
-Good.

419
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:08,567
-Three.
-Amazing.

420
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,602
-Four. Five.
-Good.

421
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:11,737
Nine.

422
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:12,805
Last one!

423
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,740
-Ten!
-Ten!

424
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,176
"400 SQUATS COMPLETED
WITH JONATHAN COMPLETING 110"

425
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:19,445
Was that 110? Good.

426
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:21,113
A deduction of 400 is on the line.

427
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,383
The name of the game
is "Kibitzing Gomoku."

428
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,451
Gomoku?

429
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:27,419
KIBITZING GOMOKU
OPPONENT OF CHOICE

430
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,054
<i>It's also known as Sabotage Gomoku.</i>

431
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:30,723
"Hey, you should put it there."

432
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:31,790
"LIKE THIS"

433
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:33,625
We'll gladly allow that kind of kibitzing.

434
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,961
-I've never played the game before.
-Really?

435
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,096
-You don't know it?
-No.

436
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,064
-Are you good at it?
-Well, I know the game.

437
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:40,933
-Should I do it? Okay.
-Yes, since you're smart.

438
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,068
-I'll do it.
-All right.

439
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:45,137
Who should we pick then?

440
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:46,872
How about Air Controller?

441
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,007
-The Burp Man?
-Yes.

442
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:49,074
Right.

443
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:50,142
Let's go with him.

444
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:51,643
-I have a good feeling.
-Shall we choose him?

445
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,646
I don't think Air Controller
has the strongest mentality.

446
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:58,250
Okay. Producer Son Taeho will play then.

447
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:01,253
"INHALING IN DOUBT"

448
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,088
Hold on, hold on.

449
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:05,290
Should we pick Air Controller

450
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,092
or Coach Solbin?

451
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:08,560
-What?
-Solbin.

452
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:09,828
We could pick him too.

453
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:11,697
You know, I actually think

454
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,566
-he'll be pretty bad at it.
-Right? That's what I'm saying.

455
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,502
You're saying that to his face?

456
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:18,737
Hey, Daniel. Let's pick him.

457
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:21,173
-The way I see it,
-Right?

458
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,076
his brain must work slowly
because of all those muscles.

459
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:27,446
"WILL THEIR ASSUMPTION
BE RIGHT?"

460
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:29,915
-We pick Coach Solbin! Come on.
-Okay.

461
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:31,316
-Okay.
-We pick Coach Solbin!

462
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:32,885
Okay then.

463
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:36,355
Please move to the set outside.

464
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,490
-Are you good at it?
-In high school,

465
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,293
-Were you good?
-I once beat my math teacher.

466
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,195
Good. It's all good then.

467
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:46,231
-In high school?
-The teacher said he was good at it,

468
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:48,133
-Okay.
-and he really was good.

469
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:49,935
-At least from what I remember.
-We're set.

470
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:51,670
He's trustworthy,
judging by the finger flick.

471
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:58,944
QUIET BUT GOOD

472
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,713
Should I do it seriously?

473
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,948
-What?
-Should I do it seriously?

474
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,249
Come on, Solbin.

475
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:05,984
You know
you don't have to do it seriously.

476
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:07,052
All right.

477
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,620
Okay, let's make his ears bleed.

478
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:13,425
I don't listen to other people anyway.

479
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:14,860

483
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,302
-Good, good!
-Of course!

484
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:25,237
-The victory is ours!
-I'll choose the black stones.

485
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:26,705
-The white stones have an advantage.
-Okay.

486
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:29,074
-What?
-White has an advantage.

487
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:31,677
Don't let him get to you.

488
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:33,512
-He's wrong.
-Is he a wingman?

489
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:34,780
Yes, he is.

490
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:36,849
What he said caught my ear
all of a sudden.

491
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:38,750
No, no. That's all a lie.

492
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:40,352
Time's running out.

493
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,187
There's no time rule. Take your time.

494
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:45,257
Okay.

495
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:48,127
Hey, take your time.

496
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:50,529
I think he just put it there
to pretend he's good.

497
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:52,798
-He doesn't know what he's doing.
-He doesn't.

498
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:55,033
If you knew, you would've
made a base of your own.

499
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,635
Just relax and make your base.

500
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:58,203
Oh, I like that move.

501
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,738
You shouldn't have put it there.

502
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,540
-He's trapped.
-He didn't see it coming.

503
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:02,875
-He's trapped.
-This is it, right?

504
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:04,610
-With that, the game's over.
-That's not good.

505
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:06,278
He's hesitating!

506
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:07,679
You've been blocked!

507
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:09,281
-Daniel, it's over.
-It's over.

508
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:10,649
-It's over.
-Oh, he blocked it.

509
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:13,585
Wait! Hey, you can't move it again!

510
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,554
-It's over.
-Oh, he blocked it.

511
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:18,891
-Hey, you can't move it again!
-No, it's…

512
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:20,559
-He moved it again!
-No, it's not that.

513
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:22,861
-I was about to put it down, but I didn't.
-Then it's okay.

514
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:24,329
-He didn't put it down!
-He did!

515
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:25,564
He didn't!

516
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,032
He didn't put it down!

517
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:28,133
He didn't put it down!

518
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,201
I saw it.

519
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:30,669
I saw it with my own eyes.

520
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,471
It's okay if he was holding it.

521
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,778
-Was he holding it?
-Daniel, just relax

522
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,213
-and do the same.
-What a cheap move.

523
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,548
-Which move would be better?
-Just…

524
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:44,383
-Just keep going in a line.
-Neither of the moves would work.

525
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:45,651
Just form a line for now.

526
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:46,919
Yes, do that.

527
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:47,986
Form a line.

528
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:49,321
-Form a line?
-That's the right move.

529
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:50,756
Gosh, you're such a wimp.

530
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,427
Seriously, that's such a wimpy move.

531
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:56,862
-Should I attack again?
-Yes, go for it.

532
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,630
-There we go.
-He's so timid.

533
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:00,332
-Awesome.
-It's over.

534
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:01,433
-It's over.
-Oh, you win.

535
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,936
-Why's it over? Is it over?
-Put it there!

536
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:05,337
-Put it there!
-Where?

537
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:06,939
-Do you see it too?
-Yes.

538
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:08,440
I can see that you're about to lose.

539
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,978
Why's she so good at sabotaging?

540
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,880
Why does it strike my ears so hard?

541
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,317
"CONCENTRATING ALONE
AMID THE CHAOS"

542
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:21,420
The way I see it, Coach Solbin
has no idea how to play Gomoku.

543
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:22,754
Yeah, it must be his first time.

544
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,726
<i>In high school,</i>
<i>I once beat my math teacher.</i>

545
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:36,668
I've got to block it. I have to.

546
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:40,839
Come on, Daniel.
That's just a meaningless move.

547
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,441
-Really?
-What are you doing?

548
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,676
"CONFIDENT"

549
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,211
See the bigger picture!

550
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:47,279
Here?

551
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,014
Yes, that's good.

552
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:51,750
You have a really good next move.

553

"COACH SOLBIN NEEDS TO DEFEND"

554
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:55,220
No, Daniel, that was a great move.

555
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:01,426
You said three by three
isn't allowed, right?

556
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,295
Both that and four by three are allowed.

557
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,938
"WEREN'T YOU GOING
TO BLOCK THIS?"

558
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:14,573
-Daniel.
-Yes!

559
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,941
No, no. We won.

560
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:17,376
-It's over.
-We won!

00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:21,813
"FLUSTERED"

00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:31,356
Daniel, listen.

564
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:33,492
Coach Solbin acted all tough, asking,

565
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:35,661
"You said three by three
isn't allowed, right?"

566
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:40,332
400 GIVEN AWAY JUST LIKE THAT

567
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:42,567

<i>from Coach Solbin for another round.</i>

568

do you want to give it a go?

569
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:45,837
-As a bonus game?
-I'm certain I'll win.

570
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:47,906
-Go ahead. He says he'll win.
-He's certain he'll win.

571
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,775
-Really?
-They'll play Gomoku.

572
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:51,143
Wow.

573
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:53,011
Everyone came to watch us.

574
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:54,079
What? All of a sudden?

575
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,414
-DinDin, are you playing?
-Yeah.

576
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,848
Is a finger flick
from Coach Solbin the bet?

577
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:58,650
-Yeah, his finger flick.
-Okay, finger flick.

578
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:02,554
Were you really the top Gomoku player
in the Air Force?

579
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:03,989
-Yes, really.
-Really?

580
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:05,057
At a competition too.

581
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:08,226
"WINNER OF THE AIR FORCE

582
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:09,895
Well, I'll beat you today.

00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:11,697
I'm from the Army.

584
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:13,832
You're representing the Army?

585
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:15,801
So it's the Air Force versus the Army?

586
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:17,436
You put it down, right?

587
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,503
Yes.

588
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:23,675
This is fun.

589
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,612
I think DinDin realized something.

00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:36,555
I'll go at full force today.

593
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:38,290
Wasn't it at full force when you hit me?

594
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,125
It was my first shoot, so I was nervous.

595
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,993
You might end up killing someone.

596
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:45,397
I guess he already forgot
how strong it was.

597
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,301
Why put it there?

598
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:55,073

599
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:05,751

00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:09,187
-Good.
-Yes!

602

You know how to play!

603
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:15,594
Well, while thinking about
how I'd come behind his back,

604
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,329
I decided to give him a chance or two.

605
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:19,564
It's over, actually.

606
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:21,733
He said he was a top Air Force player,
but he's dragging it out too much.

607
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,769
-I'm trying to think five moves ahead.
-Okay.

608
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:28,673
Man, the white stone
needs to build a new attack now.

609
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,343
The white stone
doesn't have any good moves to make.

610
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,145
-It doesn't have any attacks to make.
-There…

611
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:34,513
DinDin is good.

612
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:35,947

00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:40,852

-Get ready.
-No.

00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:52,330

-It's over.

You think it's not over?

623
00:23:58,203 --> 00:23:59,504
It's checkmate.

00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:09,581
-DinDin's lost.
-He's good.

628
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:12,751
DinDin's lost. Oh, no.

-Oh, no, DinDin.
-Hey, is your forehead going to be okay?

632
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:22,027
He has to put his forehead out.

633
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:23,862
Oh, no, DinDin.

00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,103
If he does a few more,
he'll beat out O3ohn.

648
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,172
We got the right mercenary today.

649
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:08,373
-You're right.
-Yeah.

Seventy.

00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:11,810
-Come on, that's enough.
-One.

00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:14,913
-No way. I want to come in first.

00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,186
He's done 110.

657
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:23,388
-What? 110?
-That's enough. Stop.

658
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:25,557
Seriously? Daniel, get out.
I'll take it from here.

659

Hey, get out. It's okay.

660
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,095
Stop now. You've done 110.

661
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:31,563
-I'll do 20 more.
-Come on, man.

662
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:32,898
-I'll do 20 more.
-Seriously?

663
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:35,500
What do you mean, 20 more? Stop it, man.

664
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:37,302
Let me win the keychain!

665

We can't stop him now. He's on fire.

666
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,108
You don't have to overdo it, Daniel.

667
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,810
At this rate, he'll do 300 later.

668
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,712
You'll need to do 150 on your next try.

669
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:54,986
Wow, is he actually doing it?

670
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:56,454

I'm finished.

678
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:13,505
I even packed it all.

679
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:15,574
I packed it.

680
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:18,076
-Look.
-The anchovy master.

681
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:20,178
If you do 430 more squats,

682
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,280
you'll reach the 6,000 count

-That's good. Okay!
-Great!

692

Sixty.

700
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:10,729
You're almost there.

701
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:13,164
You're almost there.

702
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:14,633
Twenty.

703
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:16,434
Nine. Eight.

704
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:17,502
Seven.

705
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,206
Ten. Nine.

706
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:22,307
Six.

707
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,442
Five.

708
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:26,077
-Four!
-You're almost there.

709
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,879
-Three!
-Thona Yiombi!

710
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:28,947
Two!

711
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:31,650
Thona Yiombi!

712
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:41,159
Six thousand!

713
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:43,228
Wow, I can't believe we did it.

714
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:44,362
Can you believe it?

715
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:45,964
We did 6,000.

716
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:49,768
<i>All right, everyone.</i>
<i>You successfully finished 6,000 squats.</i>

717
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:52,737
I'll announce the fourth place first.

718
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:54,072
-Who would it be?
-Thona Yiombi!

719
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:56,141
What? I'm not in fourth place.

720
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:59,044
Unfortunately, the fourth place
is O3ohn yet again.

721
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,645
-What? Seriously?
-What?

722
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:03,748
-Really?
-O3ohn did 947, hence fourth place.

723
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:05,950
-And third place is…
-Thona Yiombi?

724
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:08,353
DinDin, who did 974.

725
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,755
"3RD PLACE, DINDIN (974 SQUATS)"

726
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:12,090
-Wow!
-DinDin's third place?

727
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:13,324
Wow.

728
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:14,659
Wait, Jonathan.

729
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:16,594
Wow, is Jonathan in a higher rank?

730
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,764
-I'm not third place for the first time.
-Jonathan is?

731
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:22,033
Now, I'll announce first place.

732
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,270
He's done 1,086 squats by himself.

733
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:28,473
The one who's done 1,086 is…

734
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:31,142
Daniel.

735
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,477
…Daniel Lindemann.

736
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:37,282
"1ST PLACE,
DANIEL LINDEMANN (1,086)"

737
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:38,950
…Daniel Lindemann.

738
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:51,196
Look at that.

739
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:53,898
He can dance lightheartedly like that
since he didn't do squats.

740
00:28:57,702 --> 00:28:59,971
But Jonathan put up
a really good fight today.

741
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,574
He did 993.

742
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,242
Wow, you did a lot.

743
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:06,911
You didn't give up,
so you're second place now, not last.

744
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:07,979
You're right.

745
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:09,547
Was he really in last place earlier?

746
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:10,882
Yes, he was earlier.

747
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:13,151
"JONATHAN CLIMBED UP
FROM LAST TO SECOND PLACE"

748
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:15,086
Wow, good job!

749
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:16,921
Man, my keychain!

750
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:19,824
The Anchovy Keychain
will now be given to the German Daniel.

751
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:24,362
"THE ANCHOVY KEYCHAIN
IS HANDED OVER TO CHOI DANIEL"

752
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:28,433
If my mindset was last place,
I would've ended up in last place.

753
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,701
-But you're not.
-Thanks to DinDin.

754
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:33,138
-The advice helped me come in second.
-Yes, that's it.

755
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:38,009
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T GIVE UP
UNTIL THE END,

756
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:41,813
2ND PLACE IS WORTHY ENOUGH

757
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,717
THE 3RD ANCHOVY
PHYSICAL CAMP ENDS
