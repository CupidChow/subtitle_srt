1
00:00:05,715 --> 00:00:07,683
I love the sound of the water.

2
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,153
Me too. This is so nice eating here,
listening to it.

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,188
TODAY'S MENU

4
00:00:12,255 --> 00:00:15,158
A STEADY-SELLER IN THIS VALLEY
BRAISED SPICY CHICKEN

5
00:00:19,562 --> 00:00:21,030
MMM

6
00:00:21,097 --> 00:00:24,000
CHIT-CHATTING TOGETHER

7
00:00:24,867 --> 00:00:28,104
LUNCH IS OVER

8
00:00:28,171 --> 00:00:29,439
Let's play rock paper scissors.

9
00:00:29,972 --> 00:00:31,340
-What?
-Rock paper scissors.

10
00:00:32,108 --> 00:00:34,310
Daniel's not here, so let us three do it.

11
00:00:34,377 --> 00:00:35,478
-Okay.
-Where did he go?

12
00:00:35,711 --> 00:00:38,815
DANIEL HAS GONE TO DO A NUMBER TWO

13
00:00:39,182 --> 00:00:40,850
-Let's do it without him.
-Okay.

14
00:00:40,917 --> 00:00:42,618
-Rock paper scissors.
-Scissors.

15
00:00:42,685 --> 00:00:44,020
IN THE BATHROOM AT SUCH A CRUCIAL MOMENT

16
00:00:44,087 --> 00:00:45,788
1ST ONE UP, O3OHN

17
00:00:45,855 --> 00:00:47,356
Rock, paper, scissors!

18
00:00:47,857 --> 00:00:49,792
2ND, JONATHAN

19
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:52,562
3RD, DINDIN

20
00:00:52,628 --> 00:00:53,729
4TH, DANIEL

21
00:00:53,796 --> 00:00:56,232
Thank you for lunch. All right.

22
00:00:56,299 --> 00:00:57,567
Let's push forward.

23
00:00:58,234 --> 00:01:00,670
WITH 8,062 M,
O3OHN IS CURRENTLY IN THE LEAD

24
00:01:00,736 --> 00:01:02,138
Let's go, O3ohn.

25
00:01:02,205 --> 00:01:03,639
Let's go. Get some rest.

26
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,875
FEELING GOOD AFTER LUNCH

27
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:07,510
I feel so good.

28
00:01:07,577 --> 00:01:08,578
Let's go.

29
00:01:08,644 --> 00:01:09,645
DEEP IN THOUGHT

30
00:01:09,712 --> 00:01:10,880
Let's burn it off.

31
00:01:11,514 --> 00:01:13,716
JUST LIKE HE DID BEFORE LUNCH

32
00:01:13,783 --> 00:01:16,619
IF O3OHN ROWS 5 KM AGAIN?

33
00:01:17,086 --> 00:01:19,522
THEN IT'LL BE HARDER
FOR ME TO WIN THE KEYCHAIN!

34
00:01:19,589 --> 00:01:21,991
Hey, shouldn't we set some rules?

35
00:01:22,058 --> 00:01:23,826
Or we can set a pace.

36
00:01:23,893 --> 00:01:25,228
-Is there a pace on it?
-Yes.

37
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:28,297
It shows how long it'll take
to row 500 m at your speed.

38
00:01:28,798 --> 00:01:31,167
That sounds good. Hey, let's set the pace.

39
00:01:31,234 --> 00:01:32,869
If your pace gets slower, you stop.

40
00:01:32,935 --> 00:01:34,770
-It's currently about 2 min 30 sec.
-It's 2 min 30 sec.

41
00:01:34,837 --> 00:01:37,373
-I think it's the standard pace.
-Okay.

42
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,409
<i>Okay, if your pace goes over 2 min 30 sec,</i>
<i>your turn is over.</i>

43
00:01:40,877 --> 00:01:42,578
What is this?

44
00:01:42,645 --> 00:01:44,313
What? You were taking a dump.

45
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,715
You should've waited for me.

46
00:01:45,781 --> 00:01:47,316
Hey, we want to take a dump too.

47
00:01:47,783 --> 00:01:49,385
We're all holding it in here.

48
00:01:49,452 --> 00:01:51,154
I'm totally holding it in.

49
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,321
I'm going second, then?

50
00:01:52,388 --> 00:01:53,589
No, you're going last.

51
00:01:53,656 --> 00:01:56,526
Come on, let me do it too!
What happened to my turn?

52
00:01:56,592 --> 00:01:58,694
Our team's got no consideration
for each other.

53
00:01:58,761 --> 00:02:00,930
-We're all holding it in.
-Exactly.

54
00:02:00,997 --> 00:02:03,032
You're the only one who went
to take a dump. That's selfish.

55
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:05,535
THE MAN WHO EMPTIED HIS BOWELS SELFISHLY

56
00:02:05,601 --> 00:02:08,171
Someone opened the door
while I was doing it.

57
00:02:08,237 --> 00:02:09,672
That bothered me so much,

58
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:11,240
I eventually couldn't finish.

59
00:02:11,307 --> 00:02:13,643
I mean, can't I even go to the bathroom
when I want to?

60
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:15,178
IMMATURE FIGHT GOING ON BEHIND HIM

61
00:02:15,478 --> 00:02:17,079
LAUGHING

62
00:02:17,547 --> 00:02:18,548
Hey, you're close.

63
00:02:18,614 --> 00:02:20,383
-You're out!
-Hey! Get out.

64
00:02:20,449 --> 00:02:21,551
-You're out!
-Hey! Get out.

65
00:02:21,617 --> 00:02:23,286
-Damn it!
-This is fun.

66
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,521
PACE
DISTANCE

67
00:02:25,588 --> 00:02:27,356
HE'S OUT BEFORE HE COULD EVEN REACH 1 KM

68
00:02:27,423 --> 00:02:29,759
-Hey, this is so fun!
-Good!

69
00:02:29,825 --> 00:02:31,394
-This is so fun.
-Good.

70
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,563
God, I was distracted by you guys talking.

71
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:34,864
We should've done this earlier.

72
00:02:34,931 --> 00:02:36,332
Right, or you could go on forever.

73
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:39,602
With this rule,
I think you'd row about 1 km on average.

74
00:02:39,669 --> 00:02:41,504
Three. Good, you're in.

75
00:02:41,571 --> 00:02:43,606
Four. Five.

76
00:02:43,673 --> 00:02:45,808
Wow, his pace is like 2 min 5 sec.

77
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,343
He's so strong.

78
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,511
HIS PACE IS INDEED FAST

79
00:02:48,578 --> 00:02:50,213
I need a Nike deal!

80
00:02:50,813 --> 00:02:51,814
It's 500 m.

81
00:02:52,715 --> 00:02:53,749
It's 1,000 m.

82
00:02:55,518 --> 00:02:56,819
You've rowed 1,500 m.

83
00:02:57,653 --> 00:02:59,355
Wow, he's so fast.

84
00:03:00,623 --> 00:03:01,757
Way to go!

85
00:03:01,824 --> 00:03:02,825
HOWEVER

86
00:03:02,892 --> 00:03:05,027
Jonathan, you're getting slow.

87
00:03:05,094 --> 00:03:06,896
-What?
-You're getting slow.

88
00:03:06,963 --> 00:03:09,498
WAS I GOING TOO FAST?

89
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:11,734
Are you okay? Are you exhausted?

90
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,737
He's sweating so much.
He must be so tired.

91
00:03:15,204 --> 00:03:16,539
EXHALING

92
00:03:17,006 --> 00:03:18,908
PANTING

93
00:03:21,177 --> 00:03:22,211
At 2,000 m. Wow.

94
00:03:22,278 --> 00:03:23,779
-Now at 2,012 m.
-Nice.

95
00:03:23,846 --> 00:03:25,548
2,012 M COMPLETED

96
00:03:25,615 --> 00:03:27,650
I felt like my heart was exploding.

97
00:03:28,117 --> 00:03:29,585
Now this is proper exercise.

98
00:03:30,953 --> 00:03:33,222
Rowing 2,000 m like Jonathan
is just impossible.

99
00:03:41,897 --> 00:03:45,034
WHAT'S WITH YOUR EYES, JONATHAN?

100
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:48,771
-Why am I so sleepy?
-You?

101
00:03:48,838 --> 00:03:50,439
-You're worn out.
-No.

102
00:03:50,506 --> 00:03:51,574
Here he goes.

103
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:53,009
Jonathan after a meal.

104
00:03:53,075 --> 00:03:54,777
It's blood sugar. I ate a lot.

105
00:03:54,844 --> 00:03:56,679
-A blood sugar spike?
-It's kicking in.

106
00:03:57,913 --> 00:04:00,883
TRYING TO KEEP HIS EYES WIDE OPEN

107
00:04:01,517 --> 00:04:02,652
Hold on. Well…

108
00:04:04,387 --> 00:04:06,622
HIS EYELID MUSCLES ARE GIVING OUT

109
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:09,058
You normally get more energetic
after a meal, don't you?

110
00:04:09,558 --> 00:04:11,060
But this guy's so unusual.

111
00:04:11,594 --> 00:04:13,095
Every time he eats something,

112
00:04:13,562 --> 00:04:15,097
he becomes listless.

113
00:04:15,164 --> 00:04:16,465
Interesting.

114
00:04:16,532 --> 00:04:18,801
KNOCKED DOWN BY
COLLABORATION BETWEEN LUNCH AND EXERCISE

115
00:04:22,338 --> 00:04:25,007
"MEANWHILE, THEY REACH 10 KM"

116
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:26,842
This time,

117
00:04:26,909 --> 00:04:28,511
it's "Water Pig Ssireum."

118
00:04:29,445 --> 00:04:32,281
<i>You'll play a four-on-four</i>
<i>against the staff members.</i>

119
00:04:32,348 --> 00:04:33,382
5 KM ON THE LINE

120
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:35,718
But one person's knocked down.
Is that okay?

121
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:37,586
He fell asleep.

122
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:38,721
He's gone.

123
00:04:39,221 --> 00:04:40,222
Jonathan.

124
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:44,493
Jonathan, it's over.

125
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,728
Yes, it's over.

126
00:04:46,595 --> 00:04:47,863
Jonathan, let's go home.

127
00:04:48,631 --> 00:04:49,699
We finished it.

128
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,934
We have a winner for the keychain.

129
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:54,737
Who? No way.

130
00:04:55,271 --> 00:04:57,073
Daniel's won the keychain today.

131
00:04:57,139 --> 00:04:58,240
Yay!

132
00:04:59,108 --> 00:05:01,277
-Bam!
-I just closed my eyes for a moment.

133
00:05:01,344 --> 00:05:02,345
That wasn't a moment.

134
00:05:02,411 --> 00:05:03,546
-You fell asleep.
-Yes.

135
00:05:03,612 --> 00:05:04,880
We finished it without you.

136
00:05:04,947 --> 00:05:06,215
But I didn't do my turn.

137
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:08,884
What's the record?

138
00:05:08,951 --> 00:05:10,353
How long did it take?

139
00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:11,754
What do you mean?

140
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:14,957
"TALKING NONSENSE"

141
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:17,026
Shall we do the clap? All right.

142
00:05:17,093 --> 00:05:19,261
"FILMING IS REALLY OVER?"

143
00:05:19,328 --> 00:05:21,564
Okay, slate. One, two, three.

144
00:05:22,631 --> 00:05:23,632
-Good work.
-Good work.

145
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,167
-Why is it over?
-Thank you.

146
00:05:25,768 --> 00:05:27,937
-Hey, is it really over?
-It was so tough.

147
00:05:28,003 --> 00:05:29,572
Why's it over? I slept briefly.

148
00:05:29,638 --> 00:05:30,740
No, you didn't.

149
00:05:31,207 --> 00:05:33,976
You fell asleep,
and we decided to do it without you.

150
00:05:34,043 --> 00:05:35,644
That's a foul. I mean…

151
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:36,979
What do you mean, a foul?

152
00:05:37,046 --> 00:05:38,247
You fell asleep!

153
00:05:38,314 --> 00:05:39,482
IT REALLY LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE DONE

154
00:05:44,854 --> 00:05:45,988
JONATHAN'S MANAGER

155
00:05:46,055 --> 00:05:47,590
Are you asking your manager?

156
00:05:49,191 --> 00:05:50,793
<i>What do I do? I really need to win it.</i>

157
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,462
<i>I need the keychain.</i>
<i>I fell asleep and missed the chance?</i>

158
00:05:53,529 --> 00:05:55,498
<i>I was quite afraid in the moment.</i>

159
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:58,334
-Asking the manager for what?
-He's going to cry. Just tell him.

160
00:05:58,801 --> 00:06:00,136
We're going to play the game.

161
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,071
The game.

162
00:06:02,138 --> 00:06:03,806
God, I was so scared.

163
00:06:03,873 --> 00:06:06,575
<i>Okay, let's move</i>
<i>to play Water Pig Ssireum.</i>

164
00:06:06,642 --> 00:06:08,177
Wow, it feels so cool.

165
00:06:08,677 --> 00:06:09,678
Wow.

166
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:12,181
But they're way heavier than us.

167
00:06:12,248 --> 00:06:13,983
Most of them are heavyweights.

168
00:06:14,049 --> 00:06:15,785
Hey, let's play fair and square.

169
00:06:15,851 --> 00:06:17,453
They're all so big.

170
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,155
-So big.
-How about we change one player?

171
00:06:19,221 --> 00:06:21,123
All right, then. Just one player.

172
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,559
Then, Hell Boy out and the new face in.

173
00:06:26,562 --> 00:06:28,764
You stay still.
We should hold together like this.

174
00:06:28,831 --> 00:06:30,099
-Okay. Daniel, come here.
-All right.

175
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,367
Come closer.

176
00:06:31,434 --> 00:06:32,668
-Bring it on!
-Okay.

177
00:06:32,735 --> 00:06:33,903
-Come on.
-Bring it on!

178
00:06:33,969 --> 00:06:36,105
OPERATION UNITED WE STAND

-Okay!
-Okay!

259
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:30,079
The producer seemed

260
00:09:30,145 --> 00:09:31,880
to be in a very bad mood.

261
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:33,182

We won't lose anything
even if we lose this one, right?

279
00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:07,182
We already won.

280
00:10:07,249 --> 00:10:08,751
If you bet it, you can lose it too.

Let Hell Boy play, and bet another 5 km.

290
00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:28,337
We'll put in Hell Boy.

291
00:10:28,404 --> 00:10:30,105
-And how about 3 km?
-3 km?

292
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:31,373
But are you confident?

293
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,442
I'm so confident. It was so fun.

But Hell Boy looks untouchable
seeing him here.

He's like a water buffalo.

-He's coming.
-Oh, my.

361
00:12:49,912 --> 00:12:51,046
TAKEN ABACK

362
00:12:51,814 --> 00:12:53,248
-Okay, he got him!
-Okay!

363
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:54,349
HELL BOY, OUT!

364
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:55,417
Okay!

365
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:57,319
Out! He's out!

366
00:12:57,386 --> 00:12:59,721
BUT HE'S STILL VERY OUTNUMBERED

367
00:12:59,788 --> 00:13:01,690
STAFF'S LIFTING ATTACK

368
00:13:02,424 --> 00:13:04,193
BUT HE HOLDS OUT THIS TIME TOO!

369
00:13:05,127 --> 00:13:07,362
DUE TO RECOIL, HE'S RETIRED

370
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,932
JONATHAN SURVIVES ANOTHER ATTACK

371
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,100
NOW IT'S 2:1

372
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:14,837
-He survived it.
-You got this!

373
00:13:14,903 --> 00:13:16,238
WHO'S HIS NEXT TARGET?

374
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:18,340
Hey!

375
00:13:18,407 --> 00:13:19,842
Wow, he's so good.

376
00:13:19,908 --> 00:13:21,376
-Okay, okay!
-Good!

377
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:24,213
CHARGING LIKE A BOAR

378
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,814
CAMERA DIRECTOR, OUT

379
00:13:25,881 --> 00:13:27,850
NOW IT'S 1:1

380
00:13:30,452 --> 00:13:31,587
Hit him! Sink him!

381
00:13:31,653 --> 00:13:33,755
Hey, Jonathan, let's go! Hit him!

382
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,658
You got this, Jonathan!

383
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:40,128
That's it! There! Lift that!

384
00:13:42,331 --> 00:13:44,967
Hit him! Sink him! Just sink him!

385
00:13:49,238 --> 00:13:50,839
-Good. You got this.
-You got this.

386
00:13:52,274 --> 00:13:55,944
JONATHAN'S GREAT COMEBACK

387
00:13:56,011 --> 00:13:57,446
My goodness!

388
00:13:57,512 --> 00:13:58,513
Jonathan!

389
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:03,352
"JONATHAN IS VERY STRONG INDEED"

390
00:14:03,418 --> 00:14:05,454
My God. That was insane.

391
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,656
-Are you okay?
-He's the man!

392
00:14:07,723 --> 00:14:08,957
You get a deduction of 8 km.

393
00:14:09,591 --> 00:14:10,726
We were completely defeated.

394
00:14:10,792 --> 00:14:11,793
Okay!

395
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,128
Wow, Jonathan's incredible.

396
00:14:13,195 --> 00:14:15,097
I guess
he got some sleep earlier for this.

397
00:14:15,163 --> 00:14:17,432
<i>Wow, it was a one-on-four,</i>
<i>but he still won.</i>

398
00:14:17,499 --> 00:14:18,500
A TOTAL OF 8 KM DEDUCTED

399
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:19,835
We won,

400
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:21,870
all thanks to Jonathan.

401
00:14:21,937 --> 00:14:23,772
-We should give him the credit…
-Right.

402
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,307
-…so let's let him go first.
-I agree.

403
00:14:25,374 --> 00:14:27,342
-He did such a great job.
-Right.

404
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:28,644
Let's support him this time.

405
00:14:36,184 --> 00:14:38,453
BUT HE LOOKS A LITTLE…

406
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:40,322
EXHALING

407
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:43,458
STARTING TO PANT AFTER A FEW STROKES

408
00:14:43,525 --> 00:14:45,894
Jonathan's completely
different from before.

409
00:14:48,297 --> 00:14:50,699
<i>I beat four guys by myself.</i>

410
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:52,701
<i>I gave it my all,</i>

411
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:55,871
<i>so after the first stroke,</i>
<i>I felt like I couldn't do it anymore.</i>

412
00:14:56,905 --> 00:14:59,241
"EXHAUSTED AFTER VICTORY"

413
00:14:59,308 --> 00:15:01,543
Now even rowing 1 km is so hard.

414
00:15:02,177 --> 00:15:03,412
This is not easy.

415
00:15:06,748 --> 00:15:07,749
What?

416
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:09,618
You can't anymore?

417
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:11,820
I'm used up.

418
00:15:11,887 --> 00:15:14,556
"JONATHAN GIVES UP AFTER ROWING 1 KM"

419
00:15:15,157 --> 00:15:17,693
Could this be what being an oarsmen
in the Joseon era felt like?

420
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,194
This is so tough.

421
00:15:19,261 --> 00:15:21,730
"DINDIN'S EXHAUSTED AS WELL"

422
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:22,798
Goodness.

423
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,668
You rowed 500 m.

424
00:15:28,003 --> 00:15:29,004
Okay.

425
00:15:29,071 --> 00:15:30,639
"HE STOPS AT 500 M"

426
00:15:31,707 --> 00:15:32,708
All right.

427
00:15:32,774 --> 00:15:34,409
THIRD, DANIEL

428
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:36,345
Should I make it neck and neck?

429
00:15:36,411 --> 00:15:38,180
-Or just let you win?
-Make it neck and neck.

430
00:15:38,847 --> 00:15:40,148
All the way.

431
00:15:40,215 --> 00:15:41,583
Wow, he's so long.

432
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,119
-As expected, wow.
-Wow.

433
00:15:44,186 --> 00:15:45,554
His pace is 1 min 40 sec right away.

434
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,689
You could keep going forever at this pace.

435
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:49,925
His every stroke is so long.

436
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:52,461
Don't pull when it's not back completely.

437
00:15:52,527 --> 00:15:53,562
Just let go first.

438
00:15:53,628 --> 00:15:55,430
-Yes, like that.
-Oh.

439
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:56,598
DISTANCE GOING UP QUICKLY

440
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:57,666
One.

441
00:15:59,368 --> 00:16:00,502
Stop.

442
00:16:00,569 --> 00:16:02,037
-No. Yes.
-Keep going?

443
00:16:02,104 --> 00:16:03,772
Wow.

444
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,906
It's 2,000 m.

445
00:16:04,973 --> 00:16:07,175
REACHING 2,000 M

446
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,112
<i>If I get greedy</i>

447
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:11,680
<i>and set my mind to it,</i>

448
00:16:11,747 --> 00:16:13,348
<i>the other boys might not stand a chance.</i>

449
00:16:13,415 --> 00:16:16,318
You know, in anime,
when the final boss is revived,

450
00:16:16,385 --> 00:16:18,387
they can eliminate everyone
even with their breath.

451
00:16:18,453 --> 00:16:19,454
It's like that.

452
00:16:20,122 --> 00:16:22,657
This guy's just coasting,
but it's still 2 min 20 sec.

453
00:16:22,724 --> 00:16:24,059
Tell me about it.

454
00:16:24,126 --> 00:16:25,394
At 2,500 m.

455
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,295
-Whoa.
-Wow.

456
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:28,597
Just passed 3,000.

457
00:16:28,663 --> 00:16:29,931
My gosh.

458
00:16:29,998 --> 00:16:31,033
That's enough.

459
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:33,168
That's enough, dude.

460
00:16:33,235 --> 00:16:35,203
Wow, how does he keep going?

461
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,671
I don't think I can do it.

462
00:16:37,272 --> 00:16:40,108
DANIEL ONLY GETS A SECOND WIND
DOWN THE STRETCH

463
00:16:40,842 --> 00:16:43,445
<i>Daniel tends to work harder</i>

464
00:16:43,512 --> 00:16:44,846
<i>down the stretch.</i>

465
00:16:44,913 --> 00:16:46,715
<i>But today it was dramatically different.</i>

466
00:16:46,782 --> 00:16:48,750
<i>I wonder what his strategy was.</i>

467
00:16:50,986 --> 00:16:52,387
He passed 3,500 m.

468
00:16:52,454 --> 00:16:54,423
Solbin, please keep an eye on the pace.

469
00:16:54,489 --> 00:16:56,425
-Sure.
-He's going for too long.

470
00:16:56,491 --> 00:16:57,993
"REACHING 4,000 M"

471
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,294
Pull long.

472
00:16:59,361 --> 00:17:01,163
Relax and let go.

473
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:04,032
All right.

474
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:06,201
It's 4,312 m.

475
00:17:06,268 --> 00:17:08,603
4,312 M AT A PACE OF 2 MIN 30 SEC

476
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:11,506
DANIEL, DINDIN, O3OHN, JONATHAN

477
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:14,409
Now, 5 km is on the line in this game.

478
00:17:14,476 --> 00:17:15,844
Wow, 5 km?

479
00:17:16,344 --> 00:17:17,312
It's a lot.

480
00:17:17,379 --> 00:17:20,749
It's pork blind tasting.

481
00:17:21,216 --> 00:17:22,517
Is it identifying the cuts?

482
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:24,986
PORK BLIND TASTING

483
00:17:25,053 --> 00:17:27,022
<i>All four of you will cover your eyes</i>

484
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:28,590
<i>and taste pork.</i>

485
00:17:28,657 --> 00:17:30,992
<i>Then you must identify the cut.</i>

486
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:32,861
<i>It's a success if you get all five right.</i>

487
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:34,529
<i>Get one wrong, and it's a fail.</i>

488
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:35,797
<i>The belly.</i>

489
00:17:35,864 --> 00:17:37,399
<i>-You all know the taste.</i>
<i>-Right.</i>

490
00:17:37,466 --> 00:17:38,467
<i>The shoulder.</i>

491
00:17:38,533 --> 00:17:39,801
<i>It's a bit tougher.</i>

492
00:17:40,469 --> 00:17:41,503
<i>The jowl.</i>

493
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:44,039
<i>-The texture is…</i>
<i>-Isn't it like that of sausage?</i>

494
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:45,107
<i>The skirt meat.</i>

495
00:17:45,173 --> 00:17:46,942
<i>It's not fatty. It's lean.</i>

496
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:49,678
<i>-The hock.</i>
<i>-It's used for spicy stir-fried pork.</i>

497
00:17:49,744 --> 00:17:51,546
<i>I'll think about the taste</i>
<i>with my eyes closed.</i>

498
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:52,614
<i>Those five.</i>

499
00:17:53,915 --> 00:17:56,118
-I got all the ramen brands right.
-Right.

500
00:17:56,184 --> 00:17:58,220
-He has a good sense of taste.
-But you know,

501
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:00,789
I can tell the belly, shoulder,
and jowl apart perfectly.

502
00:18:00,856 --> 00:18:01,857
Let's go.

503
00:18:01,923 --> 00:18:03,058
CONFIDENT

504
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,060
REMAINING DISTANCE
15 KM

505
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:07,429
<i>-If you win this one, only 10 km left.</i>
<i>-10 km?</i>

506
00:18:07,496 --> 00:18:09,698
<i>But if you fail, it's 20 km.</i>

507
00:18:10,165 --> 00:18:12,601
<i>What if we fail, row 10 km,</i>
<i>and lose at the game again?</i>

508
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:13,802
<i>Then let's ring the bell.</i>

509
00:18:14,369 --> 00:18:16,838
WHETHER THEY'LL COMPLETE THE MISSION
IS DECIDED IN THIS GAME

510
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,741
PORK BLIND TASTING

511
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:23,678
All right. We'll start with DinDin
and move on to next right away.

512
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:25,780
FIRST CUT

513
00:18:36,925 --> 00:18:37,926
Hey.

514
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,728
This is the hock.

515
00:18:39,794 --> 00:18:41,196
Tastes like stir-fry pork, right?

516
00:18:41,263 --> 00:18:42,297
Yeah, it's the hock.

517
00:18:42,364 --> 00:18:44,099
It tastes like something I had yesterday.

518
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,233
This is the hock.

519
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,569
DINDIN AND JONATHAN ARE SURE IT'S THE HOCK

520
00:18:47,636 --> 00:18:48,670
Carefully feel the texture.

521
00:18:48,737 --> 00:18:49,738
LASTLY, DANIEL

522
00:18:49,804 --> 00:18:51,940
It kind of feels like the shoulder.
Hold on.

523
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,575
Hey, this is the shoulder.

524
00:18:53,642 --> 00:18:55,443
-The shoulder is more…
-It's the shoulder.

525
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,145
I'm 100% sure this is the shoulder.

526
00:18:57,212 --> 00:18:59,181
For me, it feels like
the stir-fry I had yesterday.

527
00:18:59,247 --> 00:19:01,616
Agreed. As a stir-fry expert,
I'm sure of it.

528
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:04,719
-But it feels like the shoulder to me.
-The shoulder to me.

529
00:19:04,786 --> 00:19:06,588
-You know what I mean?
-This has the texture.

530
00:19:06,655 --> 00:19:08,323
-The shoulder for you?
-Yes, the shoulder.

531
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,724
It's the hock. I'm sure.

532
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,526
-It's the shoulder.
-Tastes like stir-fry pork.

533
00:19:11,593 --> 00:19:12,661
Want to try mine?

534
00:19:12,727 --> 00:19:13,795
Definitely the shoulder.

535
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:15,664
Let's put it on hold then.

536
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:18,366
We're not sure,
but it's either the shoulder or hock.

537
00:19:18,433 --> 00:19:19,568
We'll put it on hold.

538
00:19:19,634 --> 00:19:21,369
-But the hock for now.
-Okay.

539
00:19:21,436 --> 00:19:23,338
FIRST CUT ON HOLD

540
00:19:23,405 --> 00:19:25,440
Now, it's the second cut.

541
00:19:30,011 --> 00:19:31,913
Yo, this is the jowl.

542
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,082
-Exactly?
-Exactly.

543
00:19:34,149 --> 00:19:36,518
-Okay.
-Okay. Exactly…

544
00:19:36,585 --> 00:19:39,087
-This is definitely the jowl.
-It screams the jowl!

545
00:19:39,154 --> 00:19:40,855
-This is the damn jowl.
-The jowl.

546
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:43,491
Oh!

547
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,828
This is exactly the jowl, man!

548
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:48,063
-Jowl!
-Everyone agree?

549
00:19:48,129 --> 00:19:49,931
-Yes, the jowl.
-The jowl. Okay.

550
00:19:49,998 --> 00:19:51,066
Definitely the jowl.

551
00:19:51,132 --> 00:19:52,567
I love the jowl.

552
00:19:52,634 --> 00:19:54,202
-Rinse your mouth.
-Right.

553
00:19:54,269 --> 00:19:55,270
Hurry and rinse.

554
00:19:55,337 --> 00:19:58,106
This time, we'll start with Daniel.

555
00:19:58,173 --> 00:20:00,008
THIRD CUT

556
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:01,176
The jowl, 100%.

557
00:20:01,243 --> 00:20:02,244
The jowl.

558
00:20:02,644 --> 00:20:03,645
It's in.

559
00:20:03,712 --> 00:20:05,247
-Hey, this is…
-The belly!

560
00:20:05,313 --> 00:20:06,548
This is definitely the belly.

561
00:20:06,615 --> 00:20:08,950
Hey, this is… Is it really the belly?

562
00:20:09,017 --> 00:20:10,085
Or it's not?

563
00:20:11,152 --> 00:20:12,621
It kind of tastes like stir-fry.

564
00:20:13,722 --> 00:20:15,557
-This is…
-Hold on. Look at this guy.

565
00:20:15,624 --> 00:20:16,625
-No.
-The belly, right?

566
00:20:16,691 --> 00:20:18,026
-Right?
-No.

567
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:19,327
It's not the belly.

568
00:20:19,861 --> 00:20:22,430
"CONFUSED"

569
00:20:22,497 --> 00:20:24,132
Then let's go with the hock.

570
00:20:24,199 --> 00:20:26,334
THEY THOUGHT
THE FIRST CUT MIGHT BE THE HOCK

571
00:20:26,868 --> 00:20:28,870
WHAT COULD THE THIRD CUT BE?

572
00:20:30,639 --> 00:20:31,640
No. Hey!

573
00:20:31,706 --> 00:20:33,174
-Yo, yo, yo!
-What is it?

574
00:20:33,241 --> 00:20:34,476
They made a mistake, yo!

575
00:20:34,542 --> 00:20:36,711
-What? Show me what you got.
-I got cartilage in here.

576
00:20:37,212 --> 00:20:39,881
-This is the belly!
-The belly!

577
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:40,982
Cartilage.

578
00:20:44,252 --> 00:20:45,720
I almost broke my laminates.

579
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:47,589
This is the belly! I can tell.

580
00:20:47,656 --> 00:20:48,690
-Yes.
-Are you sure?

581
00:20:48,757 --> 00:20:49,991
-I'm sure.
-Okay.

582
00:20:50,525 --> 00:20:52,127
Why is cartilage in there?

583
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:55,163
BEWARE OF CARTILAGE WHEN HAVING PORK BELLY

584
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,798
I felt the rinds too.

585
00:20:56,865 --> 00:20:57,966
This is the belly.

586
00:20:58,033 --> 00:20:59,100
Okay.

587
00:20:59,167 --> 00:21:00,502
Now it's the fourth cut.

588
00:21:03,271 --> 00:21:04,272
What?

589
00:21:05,674 --> 00:21:06,875
This is the stir-fry pork.

590
00:21:06,941 --> 00:21:08,176
No, I think this is the belly.

591
00:21:08,243 --> 00:21:09,311
No, not the belly.

592
00:21:11,546 --> 00:21:14,516
Wow, this is crazy. What do we do?

593
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,352
THINKING LONG AND HARD

594
00:21:19,087 --> 00:21:21,790
DANIEL TAKES HIS TIME SAVORING IT

595
00:21:22,424 --> 00:21:24,859
Hey, this is the hock!

596
00:21:24,926 --> 00:21:25,960
The hock!

597
00:21:26,428 --> 00:21:28,096
The hock is the cheapest.

598
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:29,164
-Right.
-Right.

599
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,166
So there was a time
when I only had the hock.

600
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,069
And this feels like
the meat from back then.

601
00:21:34,936 --> 00:21:36,304
I'm sure of it.

602
00:21:36,371 --> 00:21:38,440
-Are you sure it's the hock?
-Yes, the hock.

603
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:40,108
-Positively 100%.
-Then the first one is the shoulder.

604
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:41,609
I'm sure.

605
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:44,779
Because it reminded me of that time
as soon as I chewed it.

606
00:21:45,046 --> 00:21:47,248
IS IT THE HOCK AS DANIEL'S MEMORY SERVES?

607
00:21:47,315 --> 00:21:49,384
Hey, DinDin, let's sum up.
First, the shoulder.

608
00:21:49,451 --> 00:21:51,686
<i>Second is the jowl,</i>
<i>then the belly, then the hock.</i>

609
00:21:51,753 --> 00:21:53,021
And we'll have the skirt now.

610
00:21:53,088 --> 00:21:54,356
-Okay.
-Let's go.

611
00:21:54,422 --> 00:21:55,657
The skirt feels like,

612
00:21:55,724 --> 00:21:57,492
"I don't think I've tried it before."

613
00:21:57,926 --> 00:21:59,461
STRONG FEELING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO WIN

614
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:01,129
We'll start with Daniel.

615
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:02,230
FIFTH CUT

616
00:22:04,966 --> 00:22:05,967
Hey.

617
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:07,268
It tastes like a grilled heart.

618
00:22:07,335 --> 00:22:09,404
-That's accurate!
-Am I right?

619
00:22:09,471 --> 00:22:10,805
-The aroma is rich.
-Yes.

620
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:11,873
The meaty aroma.

621
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,941
It's over.

622
00:22:13,475 --> 00:22:14,943
Now, take off the cover.

623
00:22:16,344 --> 00:22:18,747
Hey, we're practically butchers.

624
00:22:18,813 --> 00:22:20,515
-Are you sure of all of them?
-Yes.

625
00:22:20,582 --> 00:22:23,418
Why don't we check number two first?
The jowl.

626
00:22:23,485 --> 00:22:25,253
The second one is the jowl.

627
00:22:25,887 --> 00:22:28,156
-We won.
-Shall we check number five?

628
00:22:28,223 --> 00:22:30,392
The fifth one is the skirt.

629
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:32,026
The fifth one is the skirt.

630
00:22:32,093 --> 00:22:34,195
NUMBER 5, THE SKIRT, CORRECT

631
00:22:34,262 --> 00:22:35,363
The third one next?

632
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,431
The third one is the belly.

633
00:22:36,498 --> 00:22:37,532
-The belly?
-Yes.

634
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:38,967
The third one is the belly.

635
00:22:39,033 --> 00:22:41,002
-Yes! The cartilage.
-Yes!

636
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:43,138
-Who put in the cartilage?
-Cartilage.

637
00:22:44,172 --> 00:22:45,807
LUCKY DAY

638
00:22:45,874 --> 00:22:47,809
-The fourth one is the hock.
-I'm sure of it.

639
00:22:47,876 --> 00:22:49,177
The hock that brings tears.

640
00:22:49,244 --> 00:22:50,245
The fourth one

641
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:51,946
is the hock.

642
00:22:52,013 --> 00:22:53,748
NUMBER 4, THE HOCK, CORRECT

643
00:22:53,815 --> 00:22:55,583
DEDUCTION OF 5 KM, SUCCESS

644
00:22:58,186 --> 00:22:59,888
A CLEAN SWEEP FOR THE FIRST TIME

645
00:23:00,455 --> 00:23:03,158
HUMILIATING DEFEAT

646
00:23:03,825 --> 00:23:06,094
-We're doing great today.
-It's going so smoothly today.

647
00:23:07,862 --> 00:23:08,863
Geez.

648
00:23:10,165 --> 00:23:11,699
It's seriously a catastrophic day.

649
00:23:13,568 --> 00:23:15,336
It's literally "the Battle of Yangju."

650
00:23:20,175 --> 00:23:22,577
Now 10,978 m is left.

651
00:23:23,478 --> 00:23:25,013
-Let's go again.
-Shall we begin?

652
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,250
DANIEL GOES FIRST

653
00:23:30,218 --> 00:23:31,786
QUIET

654
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,556
WHERE ARE THE OTHER ANCHOVIES?

655
00:23:37,692 --> 00:23:38,827
It sounds like rain.

656
00:23:39,861 --> 00:23:41,329
Wow, it sounds amazing.

657
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:42,831
A BBQ PARTY WITH LEFTOVERS

658
00:23:42,897 --> 00:23:44,032
It smells so good.

659
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,635
Oh, God. The sound…

660
00:23:48,236 --> 00:23:49,237
Goodness.

661
00:23:49,304 --> 00:23:51,706
IT'S GOTTEN TWICE AS HARD TO ROW

662
00:23:54,042 --> 00:23:55,543
GOLDEN

663
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:56,811
It's so good. Have some.

664
00:23:59,214 --> 00:24:00,815
It's so good.

665
00:24:01,883 --> 00:24:03,084
Wow.

666
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:06,287
You rowed 1,500 m.

667
00:24:06,788 --> 00:24:08,923
"DANIEL KEEPS GOING, GIVING UP THE MEAT"

668
00:24:12,927 --> 00:24:15,129
Wow, his pace is amazing.

669
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:20,101
<i>First place or nothing.</i>

670
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:22,370
HIS ONLY GOAL IS 1ST PLACE

671
00:24:22,437 --> 00:24:23,905
Okay, 2,000 m.

672
00:24:23,972 --> 00:24:25,206
You rowed 2,000 m.

673
00:24:25,273 --> 00:24:26,274
What?

674
00:24:26,341 --> 00:24:27,976
-2,000?
-Maintain it.

675
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:31,112
Wow, he's going for 3 km.

676
00:24:31,579 --> 00:24:32,780
He got great endurance.

677
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:35,149
I mean, how can he do it like that
down the stretch?

678
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,385
"WATCHING THE PACE CLOSELY"

679
00:24:37,452 --> 00:24:39,120
It was close just now.

680
00:24:39,587 --> 00:24:42,023
Hey, O3ohn's watching him closely
in the midst of all this.

681
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:43,825
Of course I should.

682
00:24:43,892 --> 00:24:45,059
My goodness.

683
00:24:48,997 --> 00:24:50,665
Whatever. Just take the keychain.

684
00:24:50,732 --> 00:24:52,333
"ANNOUNCING HE'S GIVING IT UP"

685
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,036
-I'll just eat the meat.
-When there's pork belly here…

686
00:24:55,103 --> 00:24:57,238
This is the keychain for today!

687
00:24:59,674 --> 00:25:02,977
"JONATHAN GIVES UP THE KEYCHAIN TOO"

688
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:05,280
Jonathan and I will
just grill and enjoy meat,

689
00:25:05,747 --> 00:25:07,048
and let the two compete.

690
00:25:07,115 --> 00:25:08,383
The gap is too big anyway.

691
00:25:08,449 --> 00:25:10,485
Jonathan, you give up that easily?

692
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:11,886
It's so delicious.

693
00:25:12,987 --> 00:25:15,256
Hey, you can't lose to pork.

694
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:17,992
Since DinDin's not winning
the keychain today…

695
00:25:18,493 --> 00:25:19,794
-It's all good?
-…it's all good.

696
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:23,965
I think he's gone crazy.

697
00:25:25,967 --> 00:25:27,969
I feel at peace now that I've given up.

698
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,539
"I FEEL AT PEACE
NOW THAT I'VE GIVEN UP TOO"

699
00:25:33,341 --> 00:25:35,143
I feel so at ease.

700
00:25:37,712 --> 00:25:40,014
DANIEL FINISHES ROWING

701
00:25:41,516 --> 00:25:43,952
O3OHN GOES RIGHT AFTER

702
00:25:46,955 --> 00:25:50,325
AT A STEADY PACE

703
00:25:50,992 --> 00:25:52,260
You rowed 500 m.

704
00:25:53,061 --> 00:25:54,696
You rowed 1,000 m.

705
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:56,064
So soon?

706
00:25:56,598 --> 00:25:59,267
No wonder O3ohn didn't eat
any meat earlier.

707
00:25:59,334 --> 00:26:01,536
Because he was going to row.

708
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:03,638
WHILE THE TWO WERE BUSY EATING MEAT

709
00:26:04,138 --> 00:26:05,506
HE RESISTED THE TEMPTATION

710
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,142
AND WAITED FOR HIS TURN

711
00:26:08,843 --> 00:26:10,178
One more stroke.

712
00:26:10,645 --> 00:26:12,246
You rowed 1,500 m.

713
00:26:12,313 --> 00:26:13,948
It's 1,500!

714
00:26:16,451 --> 00:26:18,453
<i>I thought it'd be my last turn.</i>

715
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,788
<i>So I thought if I didn't gave my all,</i>

716
00:26:20,855 --> 00:26:21,923
<i>I'd end up losing.</i>

717
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:24,425
<i>To be honest, I was already exhausted,</i>
<i>but I kept at it.</i>

718
00:26:24,492 --> 00:26:26,160
<i>I tried the best I could.</i>

719
00:26:26,861 --> 00:26:29,864
If O3ohn's pace gets slow
and he stops here,

720
00:26:29,931 --> 00:26:32,767
and if Daniel puts on a spurt,
you never know.

721
00:26:33,267 --> 00:26:35,470
NOW IT'S COMPETITION
BETWEEN O3OHN AND DANIEL

722
00:26:37,105 --> 00:26:39,440
O3OHN TRIES HIS BEST TO WIDEN THE GAP

723
00:26:41,109 --> 00:26:43,411
DANIEL CHASES HIM AT A FAST PACE

724
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:46,180
Wow, the sun's shining on the two today.

725
00:26:48,916 --> 00:26:50,418
You rowed 1,500 m.

726
00:26:53,388 --> 00:26:54,889
You rowed 2,000 m.

727
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:56,924
"PERSISTENT DANIEL MAKES A FINAL SPURT"

728
00:26:58,426 --> 00:26:59,827
O3ohn, let's go!

729
00:26:59,894 --> 00:27:02,030
O3OHN TRIES TO WIDEN THE GAP

730
00:27:02,897 --> 00:27:04,565
AND DANIEL TRIES TO CLOSE THE GAP

731
00:27:04,632 --> 00:27:05,867
He's going for more!

732
00:27:05,933 --> 00:27:07,235
Four. One more.

733
00:27:07,301 --> 00:27:09,370
-It's 100. Good.
-Damn it.

734
00:27:09,437 --> 00:27:10,538
Pull!

735
00:27:10,605 --> 00:27:11,839
Hold on. Then…

736
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:15,243
ROWING MACHINE
80 KM COMPLETED

737
00:27:15,309 --> 00:27:17,378
Wow, you're impressive.

738
00:27:17,445 --> 00:27:19,614
It was so fun today.

739
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:22,250
All right, everyone,
you've done a great job.

740
00:27:22,316 --> 00:27:23,451
Let's go!

741
00:27:24,018 --> 00:27:26,821
I'll announce the result
of the rowing machine mission.

742
00:27:27,822 --> 00:27:29,157
Fourth place.

743
00:27:29,223 --> 00:27:30,425
I think it's me.

744
00:27:30,892 --> 00:27:32,460
-Jonathan.
-What?

745
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:35,496
I told you, you didn't even have to try.

746
00:27:36,831 --> 00:27:38,232
He's last place, at that.

747
00:27:38,733 --> 00:27:41,035
You rowed 16.398 km.

748
00:27:42,637 --> 00:27:44,739
He came in last?
But then again, that's nothing new.

749
00:27:44,939 --> 00:27:46,074
HE HAS NOTHING TO SAY

750
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,208
Third place.

751
00:27:47,675 --> 00:27:48,976
-Daniel.
-What?

752
00:27:49,043 --> 00:27:50,178
-I came in third?
-For real?

753
00:27:50,244 --> 00:27:51,412
-Come on.
-What?

754
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,048
-Daniel's third place.
-For real?

755
00:27:54,115 --> 00:27:56,884
You rowed 18,897 km.

756
00:27:57,418 --> 00:27:58,786
DEVASTATED

757
00:27:58,853 --> 00:28:01,556
Then it's like he just did labor work.

758
00:28:01,622 --> 00:28:02,724
It is.

759
00:28:03,691 --> 00:28:05,193
THEN AUTOMATICALLY, 2ND PLACE IS…

760
00:28:05,259 --> 00:28:06,994
-Hey, then you…
-Hold on.

761
00:28:07,628 --> 00:28:09,864
-It wasn't time to grill meat!
-At the beginning,

762
00:28:09,931 --> 00:28:11,399
you two rowed 5,000 m.

763
00:28:11,866 --> 00:28:13,334
Second place, DinDin.

764
00:28:13,835 --> 00:28:16,237
You rowed 19.154 km.

765
00:28:16,304 --> 00:28:17,739
-Wow.
-You two were neck and neck.

766
00:28:17,805 --> 00:28:19,607
I mean, this guy kept…

767
00:28:19,674 --> 00:28:22,577
So, I kept telling DinDin,
"Hey, the meat is so good."

768
00:28:23,344 --> 00:28:24,946
"How about we put in some kimchi?"

769
00:28:25,012 --> 00:28:27,849
-"Goodness, you're so good as I expected."
-And he was so excited.

770
00:28:28,349 --> 00:28:29,350
It's so good.

771
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:30,685
I like grilling meat.

772
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:32,153
My mom is a good cook.

773
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:35,289
But still, you wouldn't be this good
if you hadn't tried to learn.

774
00:28:35,356 --> 00:28:37,158
Hey, the kimchi is so…

775
00:28:37,859 --> 00:28:39,327
It's so juicy!

776
00:28:39,393 --> 00:28:40,528
-Jonathan.
-Yes?

777
00:28:40,595 --> 00:28:41,963
The sun may be shining on them,

778
00:28:42,029 --> 00:28:44,198
but the kimchi's shining on us.

779
00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:46,234
Let's put in some kimchi!

780
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,668
Let's do that.

781
00:28:47,735 --> 00:28:52,039
When I realized I didn't have a chance,
what did I decide to do?

782
00:28:52,106 --> 00:28:53,508
Taking him down with me.

783
00:28:54,509 --> 00:28:56,277
HE GOT ME

784
00:28:56,344 --> 00:28:57,345
Now, first place.

785
00:28:58,312 --> 00:29:00,448
Our first ever champion, O3ohn.

786
00:29:00,515 --> 00:29:02,250
-Wow!
-O3ohn. I'm sorry.

787
00:29:02,316 --> 00:29:03,417
How far?

788
00:29:03,484 --> 00:29:05,953
You rowed 25.569 km.

789
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,455
-Then…
-25 km, and 19 km.

790
00:29:07,522 --> 00:29:09,524
-He was untouchable.
-Right.

791
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:12,660
The winner of the seventh Anchovy Camp
is O3ohn.

792
00:29:12,727 --> 00:29:14,262
Thank you!

793
00:29:14,328 --> 00:29:15,763
THE 7TH MVP, O3OHN

794
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,131
Good job.

795
00:29:18,232 --> 00:29:19,834
HE HAS WON 2 KEYCHAINS IN TOTAL

796
00:29:19,901 --> 00:29:21,435
You're so old-fashioned.

797
00:29:21,502 --> 00:29:23,371
I have to admit, he deserves it.

798
00:29:23,437 --> 00:29:24,639
Good job.

799
00:29:24,705 --> 00:29:25,706
Good work.

800
00:29:25,773 --> 00:29:27,275
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

801
00:29:27,341 --> 00:29:28,609
-Thank you!
-Anchovy Camp!

802
00:29:28,676 --> 00:29:30,745
-You did a great job.
-You too.

803
00:29:30,812 --> 00:29:32,146
DinDin, thank you for the meat.

804
00:29:32,213 --> 00:29:33,314
THE 7TH MISSION ENDS
