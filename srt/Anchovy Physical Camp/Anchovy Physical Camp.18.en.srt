00:00:01,044 --> 00:00:03,546
PREVIOUSLY

2
00:00:03,613 --> 00:00:06,015
THE 1,000-WON BETTING QUIZ GAME
SUDDENLY STARTED

3
00:00:06,082 --> 00:00:07,083
Okay.

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:10,086
Who are the five main characters
in <i>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</i>?

5
00:00:10,153 --> 00:00:11,154
-DinDin!
-Jonathan!

6
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,222
Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Liu Bei,

7
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:14,690
-Cao Cao, Zhuge Liang.
-Correct.

8
00:00:14,757 --> 00:00:16,859
The K League 1 standings.
Say first, second, third places.

9
00:00:16,926 --> 00:00:18,494
DinDin! Jeonbuk, Gimcheon…

10
00:00:18,561 --> 00:00:20,163
-Me!
-…and Daejeon.

11
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:21,297
Correct!

12
00:00:21,364 --> 00:00:22,899
ARGHHHH!!!

13
00:00:23,733 --> 00:00:25,101
DINDIN MADE A CLEAN SWEEP

14
00:00:25,168 --> 00:00:26,202
Can you just give me 1,000 won?

15
00:00:26,269 --> 00:00:27,303
<i>I believed</i>

16
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,039
there would definitely be a mission.
I thought I should play around that.

17
00:00:30,106 --> 00:00:32,075
I'm determined to win without exercising.

18
00:00:32,542 --> 00:00:34,677
JONATHAN EXERCISED A LOT
WHILE DINDIN DIDN'T AT ALL

19
00:00:34,744 --> 00:00:35,978
How did it come to this?

20
00:00:36,446 --> 00:00:38,748
CURRENT CASH

21
00:00:38,815 --> 00:00:40,750
Gosh, you won a lot.
You won about 10,000 won.

22
00:00:40,817 --> 00:00:42,051
I told you.

23
00:00:42,118 --> 00:00:43,753
It was my plan all along.

24
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,823
To do nothing and go all in
when the staff suggests a quiz game.

25
00:00:47,457 --> 00:00:51,194
I had such a good meal with 1,500 won
and earned good money now.

26
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,130
Goodness.

27
00:00:54,197 --> 00:00:55,698
-So jealous.
-Want to do

28
00:00:55,765 --> 00:00:56,766
something with me 1-on-1?

29
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:58,601
How about Chicken Fight?

30
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:02,538
How about diving into the water,
betting everything we got?

31
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,742
We'll count and see
who lasts longer underwater.

32
00:01:07,343 --> 00:01:09,078
Let's dive.

33
00:01:09,145 --> 00:01:11,047
-Arm wrestling?
-Forget it. Deal's off.

34
00:01:11,781 --> 00:01:12,782
DinDin.

35
00:01:15,151 --> 00:01:16,152
What?

36
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,722
Want to bet 4,000 won
to see who lasts longer underwater?

37
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:21,457
The one who wins takes 12,000 won.

38
00:01:21,524 --> 00:01:23,126
-4,000 won each?
-Yes.

39
00:01:24,026 --> 00:01:25,027
A 4,000-won bet.

40
00:01:25,094 --> 00:01:26,229
IT'S TEMPTING

41
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:27,530
-Easy money.
-Do it.

42
00:01:27,597 --> 00:01:29,632
12,000 WON IN ONE GO?

43
00:01:29,699 --> 00:01:31,901
-I can do it.
-Let's do it.

44
00:01:31,968 --> 00:01:33,803
-4,000 won?
-I can bet 4,000 won.

45
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,104
Let's do it, then.

46
00:01:36,005 --> 00:01:37,006
It was a good opportunity.

47
00:01:37,073 --> 00:01:39,175
When I got an MRI lately,

48
00:01:39,242 --> 00:01:40,977
they told me to hold my breath.

49
00:01:41,043 --> 00:01:43,146
And I held my breath
for a minute and 40 seconds.

50
00:01:44,447 --> 00:01:46,215
All right, pour some more water, then.

51
00:01:46,282 --> 00:01:47,283
Just pour it all.

52
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:49,752
-I think it's enough.
-Yes, enough.

53
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:50,820
That's enough.

54
00:01:50,887 --> 00:01:53,222
-So if you pull out, it's over, right?
-Yes.

55
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:55,558
COLD WATER TANK WITH FLOATING ICE IS READY

56
00:01:56,993 --> 00:01:59,061
All right, 4,000 won from me.
Bet all you got.

57
00:01:59,128 --> 00:02:00,763
If you win this, it's over.

58
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,431
You win this, and you win today.

59
00:02:03,466 --> 00:02:05,568
<i>This one game determines it all.</i>

60
00:02:05,635 --> 00:02:06,736
<i>This determines the winner.</i>

61
00:02:06,802 --> 00:02:08,271
Let's do rock paper scissors.

62
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:10,139
Rock, paper, scissors!

63
00:02:10,206 --> 00:02:11,207
"DINDIN GOES LAST"

64
00:02:11,274 --> 00:02:13,309
Rock, paper, scissors!

65
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,410
"DANIEL GOES THIRD"

66
00:02:14,477 --> 00:02:15,478
-Okay, third.
-Third.

67
00:02:15,545 --> 00:02:16,879
Rock, paper, scissors!

68
00:02:16,946 --> 00:02:18,981
-Okay, Jonathan's 4,000 won…
-Okay.

69
00:02:19,048 --> 00:02:20,583
…is practically already gone.

70
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:21,651
MOST DISADVANTAGEOUS

71
00:02:21,717 --> 00:02:23,619
What's your strategy, Jonathan?

72
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:24,687
I don't have any.

73
00:02:24,754 --> 00:02:27,190
I'll just give it my all until I pass out.

74
00:02:27,256 --> 00:02:28,491
Right.

75
00:02:28,558 --> 00:02:31,594
Above all, if I fail to win
the keychain today, it's over for me.

76
00:02:31,661 --> 00:02:33,196
<i>I'm here to win the keychain.</i>

77
00:02:33,262 --> 00:02:35,364
DETERMINED TO PASS OUT

78
00:02:35,865 --> 00:02:36,866
Ready.

79
00:02:38,234 --> 00:02:39,235
Ready.

80
00:02:39,302 --> 00:02:40,336
Set, go!

81
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,705
-Good.
-Okay.

82
00:02:42,772 --> 00:02:43,839
That was all right.

83
00:02:43,906 --> 00:02:46,108
<i>The whole point of this show is</i>

84
00:02:46,175 --> 00:02:47,510
<i>to win the keychain.</i>

85
00:02:47,577 --> 00:02:48,578
<i>What else?</i>

86
00:02:50,179 --> 00:02:53,282
NO WAY

87
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:55,851
<i>Seriously, I'm going to win</i>
<i>a second keychain.</i>

88
00:02:55,918 --> 00:02:59,155
HOLDING BREATH FOR
16 SECONDS

89
00:03:02,325 --> 00:03:04,427
Hey, that was too short!

90
00:03:04,493 --> 00:03:06,095
It was too short!

91
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:08,531
16 SECONDS WAS TOO SHORT TO PASS OUT

92
00:03:08,598 --> 00:03:10,132
It looked like <i>Get Out</i> when he came up.

93
00:03:18,341 --> 00:03:20,276
Hey, why did you come up so soon?

94
00:03:20,343 --> 00:03:21,844
Now, tell us the record.

95
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:23,212
It's 16 seconds.

96
00:03:23,279 --> 00:03:24,280
16 seconds.

97
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:27,049
-The water's so cold.
-Really?

98
00:03:27,116 --> 00:03:29,685
-But if the water's cold, it's tougher.
-It's harder.

99
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:31,754
-It's so cold.
-Because your face hurts.

100
00:03:31,821 --> 00:03:32,922
Now, move aside.

101
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:34,490
I felt it as soon as I went in.

102
00:03:34,557 --> 00:03:35,625
I was like, "Argh!"

103
00:03:35,691 --> 00:03:37,460
I already wanted to come out
after five seconds.

104
00:03:37,526 --> 00:03:39,328
I couldn't hold out until I passed out.

105
00:03:39,395 --> 00:03:40,596
Now, second player.

106
00:03:40,663 --> 00:03:41,664
2ND PLAYER: O3OHN

107
00:03:46,068 --> 00:03:47,536
-Is the water that cold?
-So cold.

108
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:48,604
Is that so?

109
00:03:49,105 --> 00:03:51,707
<i>It's 12,000 won on the line.</i>
<i>Okay, I'll give it my all.</i>

110
00:03:53,743 --> 00:03:55,745
-He's blowing bubbles.
-He's blowing bubbles.

111
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:56,912
Bubble.

112
00:03:58,314 --> 00:04:01,050
HE'S ALSO BAD AT HOLDING HIS BREATH

113
00:04:02,385 --> 00:04:04,887
-This is so tough.
-But why is it so hard? Is it cold?

114
00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:07,323
-It's so cold, you keep swallowing saliva.
-Really?

115
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,125
Thank you.

116
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:10,826
Here I go.

117
00:04:20,336 --> 00:04:21,837
He's already blowing bubbles.

118
00:04:24,106 --> 00:04:25,374
There are bubbles coming up.

119
00:04:25,441 --> 00:04:26,776
WILL DANIEL COME UP SOON TOO?

120
00:04:27,376 --> 00:04:28,711
The blood's rushing to his head.

121
00:04:31,447 --> 00:04:32,648
What?

122
00:04:32,715 --> 00:04:34,083
-Did he pass out?
-Daniel.

123
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,251
BUT HE'S NOT COMING UP

124
00:04:35,318 --> 00:04:36,519
Daniel.

125
00:04:37,286 --> 00:04:38,554
He's holding out this long?

126
00:04:39,422 --> 00:04:40,656
He can hear us.

127
00:04:40,723 --> 00:04:42,024
JUDGING BY HIS ACTING, HE'S STILL FINE

128
00:04:42,858 --> 00:04:45,294
Wow, he's lasting so long.

129
00:04:45,761 --> 00:04:47,263
-Wow.
-So cold.

130
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,364
It's so cold!

131
00:04:52,902 --> 00:04:54,103
What? What is it?

132
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,906
By the way,
your blood vessels are bulging here.

133
00:04:57,473 --> 00:04:58,574
You lasted so long.

134
00:04:58,641 --> 00:05:01,577
Goodness, now I know what you meant.

135
00:05:01,644 --> 00:05:03,079
-Is it that cold?
-How did you hold out?

136
00:05:03,145 --> 00:05:04,714
You feel nothing around here.

137
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,015
You feel numb,

138
00:05:06,082 --> 00:05:08,117
and it feels like
your face has been torn off.

139
00:05:08,184 --> 00:05:09,352
It's the worst, seriously.

140
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:11,454
Let's go, DinDin!

141
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,489
LAST PLAYER: DINDIN

142
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,124
He's in.

143
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:17,893
But his position doesn't look good.

144
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,062
-This is not right.
-It's hard to hold your breath like that.

145
00:05:20,129 --> 00:05:22,198
That's bad.
Your chest is pressed that way.

146
00:05:22,264 --> 00:05:24,834
You'd feel like the water's going
into your nose and brain.

147
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,437
That's bad form.
I did the same, and it was so hard.

148
00:05:29,004 --> 00:05:30,673
DinDin?

149
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,842
You're not dead, are you? Hey.

150
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:35,144
He's good.

151
00:05:35,211 --> 00:05:37,279
I bet he's reaching his limit.

152
00:05:37,747 --> 00:05:39,115
Gosh, he looks peaceful.

153
00:05:39,982 --> 00:05:41,784
-He's lasting long.
-Gosh.

154
00:05:41,851 --> 00:05:44,086
-Is he okay?
-Goodness.

155
00:05:44,153 --> 00:05:45,788
You didn't pass out, right?

156
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,623
Gosh, DinDin's so good.

157
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:50,259
So he suggested this
because he was confident.

158
00:05:50,326 --> 00:05:52,695
<i>In fact, it was most advantageous</i>
<i>to DinDin,</i>

159
00:05:52,762 --> 00:05:55,498
because he's done these kinds of games
a lot on <i>2 Days &amp; 1 Night.</i>

160
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:56,966
Is he drinking the water or what?

161
00:05:57,032 --> 00:05:59,435
Gosh, he has good lung capacity.

162
00:05:59,502 --> 00:06:01,003
He looks peaceful.

163
00:06:01,837 --> 00:06:03,706
Goodness, DinDin is…

164
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:08,344
DINDIN HELD OUT LONGER THAN EXPECTED

165
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:10,679
-I wonder how long he held it.
-All right. First place is

166
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:12,114
-DinDin.
-What?

167
00:06:12,181 --> 00:06:13,449
-For real?
-A minute and 22 seconds.

168
00:06:13,516 --> 00:06:15,151
A minute and 22 seconds?

169
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:17,720
-Wow.
-Daniel, 54.62 seconds.

170
00:06:17,787 --> 00:06:19,188
THE GAP IS A WHOPPING 30 SECONDS

171
00:06:19,255 --> 00:06:20,723
A minute and 22 seconds?

172
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,225
I can stay underwater for two minutes.

173
00:06:24,026 --> 00:06:25,728
Damn it.

174
00:06:26,228 --> 00:06:27,530
12,000 WON IS GONE

175
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:28,998
He was a step ahead.

176
00:06:29,064 --> 00:06:30,833
-We got played.
-Hey, Jonathan.

177
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,168
A 10,000-won bet.

178
00:06:32,234 --> 00:06:33,803
WILL YOU BE PLAYED ONCE MORE?

179
00:06:33,869 --> 00:06:35,304
A 10,000-won bet.

180
00:06:35,371 --> 00:06:36,939
Drinking water faster.

181
00:06:37,006 --> 00:06:38,007
We got played.

182
00:06:39,642 --> 00:06:41,777
Did I say I wasn't going
for the keychain today?

183
00:06:42,578 --> 00:06:44,814
I always aim to win the keychain.

184
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,385
<i>I have more money than</i>
<i>what all of us had in total earlier.</i>

185
00:06:49,452 --> 00:06:51,020
<i>No one will have more than this.</i>

186
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,823
Now I think I might not be able to win.

187
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:55,658
To turn the tables now…

188
00:06:55,724 --> 00:06:57,359
"DANIEL
7,000 WON"

189
00:06:57,426 --> 00:06:59,028
"DINDIN
19,000 WON"

190
00:06:59,094 --> 00:07:00,196
Gosh, it's…

191
00:07:00,262 --> 00:07:01,397
<i>DinDin, that…</i>

192
00:07:01,464 --> 00:07:03,699
<i>that cheeky punk.</i>

193
00:07:03,766 --> 00:07:04,834
What's up?

194
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,570
BEING CHEEKY AFTER GETTING EASY MONEY

195
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:10,406
-Money call, money call.
-I'm totally broke.

196
00:07:11,941 --> 00:07:13,142
<i>What do I do now?</i>

197
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:15,244
<i>What should I do?</i>

198
00:07:15,778 --> 00:07:17,780
So do you want to exercise now

199
00:07:17,847 --> 00:07:19,515
or go to a supermarket?
You can do what you want.

200
00:07:19,582 --> 00:07:20,883
-What do you want?
-Go to a supermarket.

201
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,952
-I don't want to do anything.
-Let's liven up the mood.

202
00:07:23,018 --> 00:07:25,688
-Then let's go buy some meat.
-Okay.

203
00:07:25,754 --> 00:07:27,690
-And let's look around the town.
-Yes.

204
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:32,495
ON THE WAY TO THE SUPERMARKET

205
00:07:33,929 --> 00:07:35,798
This is why you need money.

206
00:07:35,865 --> 00:07:37,266
It makes you feel at ease.

207
00:07:38,367 --> 00:07:41,770
You don't have to do anything else.
It makes you feel happy,

208
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:42,838
just counting it.

209
00:07:42,905 --> 00:07:45,407
But are you seriously trying to win today?

210
00:07:45,474 --> 00:07:48,210
Let's be honest.
Either you or I should win the keychain.

211
00:07:48,277 --> 00:07:50,312
I mean, you should win it
at the next training.

212
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:51,614
Otherwise, what's the point?

213
00:07:52,147 --> 00:07:54,283
-If I win it today…
-Yes.

214
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,651
…then you should

215
00:07:55,718 --> 00:07:57,887
win it next.
Or the keychain will go to waste.

216
00:07:58,454 --> 00:08:00,856
-So you must win it today?
-Yes, I must.

217
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:07,363
But I think I'm going to win it
even if I don't want to.

218
00:08:09,131 --> 00:08:11,033
-There seems to be no game changer.
-Right.

219
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:14,904
WILL DINDIN END UP WINNING LIKE THIS?

220
00:08:15,638 --> 00:08:16,805
Jonathan.

221
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:18,340
<i>I mean what I'm about to suggest.</i>

222
00:08:18,407 --> 00:08:20,476
I really hope you believe me.

223
00:08:21,076 --> 00:08:22,912
-If you trust me…
-Okay.

224
00:08:23,546 --> 00:08:24,713
…we'll set it in motion.

225
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,482
-The train will be in motion.
-Okay.

226
00:08:26,549 --> 00:08:27,950
But if you don't trust me,

227
00:08:28,017 --> 00:08:30,119
this train will crash head-on.

228
00:08:32,488 --> 00:08:33,756
This is getting interesting.

229
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,862
It was actually plan B for me.

230
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:40,963
"Operation

231
00:08:41,597 --> 00:08:42,631
Sacrifice."

232
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,768
-"Sacrifice."
-Sacrifice, I see.

233
00:08:46,268 --> 00:08:47,269
Okay.

234
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,272
We'll all sacrifice ourselves
to make you win.

235
00:08:52,174 --> 00:08:54,410
What on earth are you talking about?

236
00:08:54,476 --> 00:08:55,878
After all you've done?

237
00:08:55,945 --> 00:08:57,112
You don't want to team up?

238
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,148
I mean, how does it help me?

239
00:08:59,214 --> 00:09:00,983
Hey, think about the next training.

240
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:04,353
If I win today,
I'll have no use for another keychain.

241
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,789
-Right.
-I don't want to do something pointless.

242
00:09:07,423 --> 00:09:09,191
-So I'm going to help you win it.
-Okay.

243
00:09:09,825 --> 00:09:13,629
But that only works
when you're going to win today for sure.

244
00:09:13,696 --> 00:09:15,331
So what should we do to make sure of it?

245
00:09:15,397 --> 00:09:18,233
The money you earn,
you should invest it in me.

246
00:09:19,868 --> 00:09:24,073
OPERATION ME FIRST

247
00:09:24,139 --> 00:09:26,875
-I didn't really want to use plan B.
-Okay.

248
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:28,711
But through the game,

249
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:30,512
-DinDin won almost 20,000 won.
-Right.

250
00:09:30,579 --> 00:09:31,947
-19,000 won to be exact.
-Right.

251
00:09:32,014 --> 00:09:33,215
So now,

252
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:34,984
unless we give it our all…

253
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,051
It's over.

254
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:37,553
-We can't turn the tables.
-Right.

255
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,321
-He has the upper hand.
-Okay.

256
00:09:39,388 --> 00:09:41,123
So, to be honest,

257
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,792
I don't want DinDin
to win his third keychain

258
00:09:43,859 --> 00:09:45,361
-and come in first.
-Okay.

259
00:09:45,427 --> 00:09:47,796
-I want two, two, two, one.
-Okay.

260
00:09:47,863 --> 00:09:49,665
-So either me or you should win it today.
-Okay.

261
00:09:49,732 --> 00:09:51,133
But I can't insist I win it,

262
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,869
so I'm going to help you win it today.

263
00:09:54,637 --> 00:09:56,071
Help you win the keychain.

264
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:58,040
GRINNING

265
00:09:58,107 --> 00:09:59,108
Well,

266
00:10:00,009 --> 00:10:01,710
I love the name of the operation.

267
00:10:01,777 --> 00:10:02,878
Operation…

268
00:10:02,945 --> 00:10:04,313
-Sacrifice.
-Sacrifice.

269
00:10:04,847 --> 00:10:06,482
-I'll sacrifice.
-Let's do it.

270
00:10:06,548 --> 00:10:07,549
Deal?

271
00:10:07,616 --> 00:10:08,851
THE DEAL'S BEEN MADE

272
00:10:08,917 --> 00:10:09,918
Let's do this.

273
00:10:11,253 --> 00:10:14,890
I hope that every member of Anchovy Camp

274
00:10:15,357 --> 00:10:19,061
struggles, suffers, and despairs.

275
00:10:19,128 --> 00:10:20,663
I hope no one wins it.

276
00:10:20,729 --> 00:10:23,399
So that it feels like the prize is
somewhere in the future,

277
00:10:23,465 --> 00:10:25,267
like the manga <i>One Piece.</i>

278
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:26,468
No one knows about it.

279
00:10:26,535 --> 00:10:28,137
And in season two,

280
00:10:28,203 --> 00:10:29,438
we try to find it.

281
00:10:29,972 --> 00:10:31,540
To find the "One Piece."

282
00:10:31,607 --> 00:10:34,009
"What was the prize we could've won?"

283
00:10:34,777 --> 00:10:35,778
It's intriguing.

284
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:37,212
I want no one to win it.

285
00:10:37,946 --> 00:10:39,581
Because we're a team.

286
00:10:42,084 --> 00:10:45,721
-Then, should I give you my money…
-Yes.

287
00:10:46,422 --> 00:10:48,290
…in secret at the end?

288
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:50,993
-Yes.
-Okay. So we'll do it like that.

289
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,995
Hold on. I do that

290
00:10:53,062 --> 00:10:54,897
to make sure you win today and…

291
00:10:54,963 --> 00:10:58,200
Then I'll have no reason
not to help you win at the next training.

292
00:10:58,267 --> 00:11:00,335
But if Daniel

293
00:11:01,837 --> 00:11:04,006
-or Jonathan wins today…
-Right.

294
00:11:04,506 --> 00:11:05,941
…then it'll be chaos.

295
00:11:06,775 --> 00:11:10,112
Then, after all we went through
to win two keychains,

296
00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:11,747
we might end up with nothing.

297
00:11:11,814 --> 00:11:13,482
-Yes, that's true.
-Yes.

298
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,751
Then…

299
00:11:15,818 --> 00:11:17,553
<i>I think your plan is legit.</i>

300
00:11:17,619 --> 00:11:19,421
<i>I'm not going to betray you.</i>

301
00:11:19,488 --> 00:11:20,522
<i>Me neither.</i>

302
00:11:21,123 --> 00:11:23,125
CURRENT RELATIONSHIP

303
00:11:23,192 --> 00:11:26,028
SACRIFICE ALLIANCE VS. ME FIRST ALLIANCE

304
00:11:26,095 --> 00:11:28,464
THEY ARRIVE AT THE SUPERMARKET

305
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:29,865
-Let's buy meat first.
-Let's.

306
00:11:29,932 --> 00:11:31,300
-Meat first.
-Let's.

307
00:11:31,366 --> 00:11:33,168
Do we pick meat here?

308
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:34,303
Then, skin-on pork belly…

309
00:11:34,369 --> 00:11:36,305
The staff's paying for this anyway, right?

310
00:11:36,371 --> 00:11:37,406
Buy more.

311
00:11:37,473 --> 00:11:39,508
THEN AS FOR THE REST…

312
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:41,610
Shouldn't we buy some sausage?

313
00:11:41,677 --> 00:11:43,178
Do you have the money to buy it?

314
00:11:43,712 --> 00:11:45,047
No, I don't.

315
00:11:45,114 --> 00:11:46,515
But… All right.

316
00:11:47,116 --> 00:11:49,685
Kimchi's here. Mr. DinDin.

317
00:11:49,752 --> 00:11:51,553
You're not going to buy kimchi?

318
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,788
Will we cook rice?

319
00:11:52,855 --> 00:11:55,758
If you want to have rice, buy it.
I don't want it.

320
00:11:56,692 --> 00:12:00,062
DINDIN'S IMPENETRABLE

321
00:12:00,129 --> 00:12:03,432
Hold on. Do you like soda like Coke?

322
00:12:04,366 --> 00:12:05,434
Don't we need soda?

323
00:12:06,869 --> 00:12:08,637
It's quite expensive.

324
00:12:08,704 --> 00:12:11,673
HE'S GETTING PENETRATED LITTLE BY LITTLE

325
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,475
It's 11,650 won.

326
00:12:14,042 --> 00:12:15,444
Why is it so expensive?

327
00:12:15,511 --> 00:12:16,512
This.

328
00:12:17,346 --> 00:12:18,514
These three.

329
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:21,083
YOU CELEBRITY PUNK

330
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:24,253
DINDIN SPENDS 11,650 WON

331
00:12:24,319 --> 00:12:26,455
Daniel, I think it was more serious

332
00:12:26,522 --> 00:12:27,990
than I thought it was.

333
00:12:28,056 --> 00:12:30,159
-What do you mean?
-He had a lot of money.

334
00:12:30,225 --> 00:12:32,561
-Right. He had more than 20,000 won.
-Yes.

335
00:12:33,028 --> 00:12:35,097
-O3ohn, we really need to team up.
-Yes.

336
00:12:35,164 --> 00:12:38,767
When I told them earlier
that if I or you didn't win,

337
00:12:38,834 --> 00:12:40,269
it'd be pointless,

338
00:12:40,335 --> 00:12:41,837
did you see their faces?

339
00:12:41,904 --> 00:12:42,905
How were they?

340
00:12:43,572 --> 00:12:46,341
-Listen. I thought about it realistically.
-Okay.

341
00:12:46,408 --> 00:12:48,944
-If O3ohn or I don't win today…
-Okay.

342
00:12:49,011 --> 00:12:50,846
-…it'd be pointless.
-I see.

343
00:12:50,913 --> 00:12:53,348
Since there will be only one keychain left
at the next training.

344
00:12:57,653 --> 00:12:59,922
But it could end differently.

345
00:13:01,523 --> 00:13:04,393
It felt like,
"What the hell are you talking about?"

346
00:13:05,127 --> 00:13:07,329
I think they have teamed up.

347
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:09,731
Let's try and win two million each.

348
00:13:09,798 --> 00:13:11,066
You this time and me next time?

349
00:13:11,133 --> 00:13:12,401
Yes, that sounds perfect.

350
00:13:12,467 --> 00:13:13,468
All right.

351
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:15,804
-After we eat…
-Yes.

352
00:13:15,871 --> 00:13:17,039
…exercise when you can.

353
00:13:17,105 --> 00:13:18,707
-Continuously? Okay.
-At your own pace.

354
00:13:18,774 --> 00:13:20,542
-I'll give you my money after we eat.
-Okay.

355
00:13:20,609 --> 00:13:22,744
Like when you did burpees and climbing,

356
00:13:22,811 --> 00:13:24,947
try your best to come in first.

357
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,148
-I'll keep going.
-Good.

358
00:13:26,215 --> 00:13:28,784
DinDin has more money than we think.

359
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:30,018
So…

360
00:13:31,653 --> 00:13:32,988
All three of us must do our best.

361
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,289
"THREE?"

362
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:35,624
Or we won't beat him.

363
00:13:37,092 --> 00:13:38,594
BEFORE LEAVING FOR THE SUPERMARKET

364
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,862
This way? Okay.

365
00:13:41,496 --> 00:13:43,966
I have a plan I really didn't want to use.

366
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:46,602
-What is it?
-I'm telling you off the record.

367
00:13:46,668 --> 00:13:48,237
Let's make Jonathan win today.

368
00:13:48,303 --> 00:13:50,873
-Operation Sacrifice.
-Okay.

369
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:54,509
But we won't stand a chance
even if we three join hands, will we?

370
00:13:54,576 --> 00:13:55,611
-We will.
-We will?

371
00:13:55,677 --> 00:13:57,746
Yes. I have more than 10,000 won.

372
00:13:57,813 --> 00:14:00,182
Well, if we exercise all together,
we might.

373
00:14:00,249 --> 00:14:03,886
If we combine efforts, we might be
able to stab him in the back at the end.

374
00:14:03,952 --> 00:14:04,987
-So…
-This is the only way.

375
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,755
…let's give Jonathan at the end.
Keep it secret.

376
00:14:06,822 --> 00:14:07,823
Keep it secret?

377
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:12,094
TURNS OUT O3OHN SWITCHED SIDES

378
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,029
When you go to wash veggies,
keep exercising.

379
00:14:14,096 --> 00:14:16,198
-Oh, okay.
-Yes, keep exercising.

380
00:14:16,265 --> 00:14:18,066
If we work together, we'll win for sure.

381
00:14:18,133 --> 00:14:19,935
O3OHN'S STILL HOLDING A GRUDGE

382
00:14:20,469 --> 00:14:23,105
I'm just aiming to join hands with someone

383
00:14:23,171 --> 00:14:24,973
and take DinDin down. That's my only goal.

384
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,942
I never imagined he'd eat my ice cream.

385
00:14:27,009 --> 00:14:29,778
Now I have to stab him in the back
to get revenge.

386
00:14:30,612 --> 00:14:31,713
Operation…

387
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,282
-Sacrifice.
-Sacrifice.

388
00:14:34,283 --> 00:14:35,384
CURRENT RELATIONSHIP

389
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:39,288
SECRET ALLIANCE
BETWEEN SACRIFICE ALLIANCE AND O3OHN

390
00:14:40,455 --> 00:14:42,157
A SUDDEN CHANGE IN WEATHER

391
00:14:43,292 --> 00:14:44,459
My goodness.

392
00:14:44,526 --> 00:14:46,161
The rain and wind is no joke.

393
00:14:46,228 --> 00:14:48,196
The oceans winds are so strong.

394
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:50,132
Wow, the rain and wind.

395
00:14:52,801 --> 00:14:56,204
Listen, guys. Since the rain is so heavy,

396
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:57,739
we all came inside to take shelter.

397
00:14:57,806 --> 00:15:00,208
And it's 5:36 now.

398
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:02,377
-Then we should just…
-Now we have

399
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:04,379
about 4 hours and 20 minutes left.

400
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:07,649
We're burning charcoal over there
right now,

401
00:15:07,716 --> 00:15:10,085
so you'll be able to have a barbecue.

402
00:15:10,152 --> 00:15:12,187
And you can exercise in here if you want.

403
00:15:12,254 --> 00:15:14,790
Can I go sleep in that room?

404
00:15:14,856 --> 00:15:16,858
Of course. It's up to you.

405
00:15:16,925 --> 00:15:19,027
-Then I'll go get some sleep.
-Okay.

406
00:15:21,063 --> 00:15:22,197
DinDin must be tired.

407
00:15:22,264 --> 00:15:24,066
-I'll get some sleep.
-And his hips hurt.

408
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:27,469
-Sleep well, DinDin.
-Okay.

409
00:15:30,038 --> 00:15:32,374
THE THREE SIGNAL EACH OTHER SILENTLY

410
00:15:34,109 --> 00:15:36,511
Then shall we grill meat
and start the party now?

411
00:15:36,578 --> 00:15:39,915
Yes. Then I'll go grill the meat first.

412
00:15:43,952 --> 00:15:45,153
What should we prepare first?

413
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,456
-I'll wash the veggies first.
-<i>Ssamjang</i> first…

414
00:15:47,522 --> 00:15:48,757
Yes, wash the veggies first.

415
00:15:48,824 --> 00:15:50,425
We should wash <i>ssamjang</i> first.

416
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:51,793
FAKE AUDIO INTENDED FOR DINDIN

417
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,062
-I'll wash the veggies.
-How do you wash <i>ssamjang</i>?

418
00:15:54,563 --> 00:15:57,199
It's going as planned.

419
00:15:57,265 --> 00:15:59,401
I'm so relieved.
I think I can ruin the game.

420
00:15:59,468 --> 00:16:01,303
<i>That's the only thing I want.</i>

421
00:16:03,772 --> 00:16:07,309
TEAM SACRIFICE STRENGTHENED BY FAKING

422
00:16:08,577 --> 00:16:09,845
-Sacrifice.
-Okay.

423
00:16:09,911 --> 00:16:12,447
If I can have it, I'm going to destroy it.

424
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:22,324
Thirty-five.

425
00:16:22,391 --> 00:16:25,293
BUT HE'S FAKING IT TOO

426
00:16:25,994 --> 00:16:26,995
Thirty-eight.

427
00:16:27,729 --> 00:16:28,730
Thirty-nine.

428
00:16:29,431 --> 00:16:30,432
Forty.

429
00:16:30,499 --> 00:16:32,334
You know what's unbelievable?

430
00:16:32,401 --> 00:16:35,804
You can hear the counting sounds
from inside.

431
00:16:37,239 --> 00:16:39,374
THEN LET THE BEST MAN WIN NOW

432
00:16:40,675 --> 00:16:42,878
Four. Five.

433
00:16:44,112 --> 00:16:47,115
THE ONE TRYING TO RUN AWAY

434
00:16:48,784 --> 00:16:51,586
AND THE ONES CHASING

435
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:53,688
Why's it so noisy? I can't sleep.

436
00:16:53,755 --> 00:16:56,324
Noisy? Then go prepare for a barbecue.

437
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,593
-Hey, what were the counting sounds about?
-What?

438
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,028
That was ASMR.

439
00:17:00,095 --> 00:17:01,830
-We started this after hearing that.
-Really?

440
00:17:02,297 --> 00:17:03,298
Two.

441
00:17:05,867 --> 00:17:06,868
Two.

442
00:17:08,437 --> 00:17:10,238
CURRENT SCORE

443
00:17:10,305 --> 00:17:12,074
TEAM SACRIFICE
TOTAL: 15,200

444
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,909
TEAM ME FIRST
TOTAL: 10,850

445
00:17:13,975 --> 00:17:17,245
MEANWHILE, THE SKY HAS CLEARED UP

446
00:17:18,213 --> 00:17:19,281
It's awesome.

447
00:17:20,015 --> 00:17:21,149
It's a lot.

448
00:17:21,983 --> 00:17:23,085
Is it burning?

449
00:17:23,151 --> 00:17:24,653
THE BEST PART, A BARBECUE PARTY

450
00:17:24,719 --> 00:17:25,854
Yay!

451
00:17:27,022 --> 00:17:28,990
Barbecue party.

452
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:31,927
Come eat, DinDin.

453
00:17:34,162 --> 00:17:35,297
Come eat, DinDin.

454
00:17:37,132 --> 00:17:38,900
-Come eat, DinDin.
-Okay.

455
00:17:39,401 --> 00:17:40,869
-DinDin.
-Did you call me?

456
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:42,471
-Dinner's ready.
-Okay.

457
00:17:42,537 --> 00:17:44,506
HE CAN'T ACT TO SAVE HIS LIFE

458
00:17:44,573 --> 00:17:46,174
Gosh, I fell asleep.

459
00:17:46,975 --> 00:17:49,010
-I saw someone jump.
-Right.

460
00:17:49,478 --> 00:17:50,612
I'm sorry.

461
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:52,714
Why do I feel so tired?

462
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:54,182
Take care of yourself.

463
00:17:54,649 --> 00:17:56,017
Take care of yourself.

464
00:17:56,084 --> 00:17:57,853
MORE TERRIBLE ACTING

465
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:04,059
SEALING THE MONEY
HE EARNED IN SECRET

466
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:05,894
Solbin, will you grill the meat?

467
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:06,995
Sure.

468
00:18:07,062 --> 00:18:09,231
Isn't this the best meal we've had so far?

469
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:10,532
-Yes.
-This is the best.

470
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:12,033
It's a feast.

471
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,035
PUTTING ASIDE THE COMPETITION FOR NOW

472
00:18:14,102 --> 00:18:15,570
He's quite good.

473
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:16,872
"IT'S TIME TO RELAX AND ENJOY"

474
00:18:16,938 --> 00:18:17,939
The quality of the meat is great.

475
00:18:18,006 --> 00:18:20,041
-Wow.
-Why is he so good at grilling?

476
00:18:20,108 --> 00:18:22,043
-Try it.
-Let's dig in.

477
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,712
-Solbin, eat.
-Thank you!

478
00:18:23,778 --> 00:18:25,547
SOLBIN'S PERFECTLY COOKED MEAT

479
00:18:25,614 --> 00:18:27,149
Shouldn't we make a toast, DinDin?

480
00:18:27,215 --> 00:18:28,850
-Of course we should.
-Right.

481
00:18:28,917 --> 00:18:30,051
It's a retreat after all.

482
00:18:30,118 --> 00:18:31,586
-Right.
-Right.

483
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:33,321
If we don't do it at a retreat,

484
00:18:33,388 --> 00:18:34,456
-when else?
-Hear, hear.

485
00:18:34,523 --> 00:18:36,558
-Right.
-We have to do it.

486
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,293
We made many great memories.

487
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,029
Let's do our best until the final episode.

488
00:18:41,096 --> 00:18:43,932
-Anchovy Physical Camp!
-Physical Camp!

489
00:18:46,935 --> 00:18:48,069
MMM

490
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:53,909
MMMMM

491
00:18:53,975 --> 00:18:56,178
MMM! MMM! MMM! MMM!

492
00:18:56,244 --> 00:19:00,048
THEY APPRECIATE SOLBIN'S COOKING

493
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:02,217
The meat is so good.

494
00:19:02,284 --> 00:19:04,319
NOW IT FEELS LIKE A RETREAT

495
00:19:04,386 --> 00:19:07,189
For the first time today,
it's heartwarming.

496
00:19:07,255 --> 00:19:08,890
-One team!
-One team.

497
00:19:08,957 --> 00:19:11,760
We were a team from the start,
and we still are.

498
00:19:11,826 --> 00:19:13,862
You can go fast if you go alone,

499
00:19:14,563 --> 00:19:16,131
but you can go far if you go together.

500
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:17,766
-That's right.
-Let's go!

501
00:19:17,832 --> 00:19:19,034
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

502
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,703
But aren't you trying to go fast today?

503
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,672
-What? Yes.
-DinDin.

504
00:19:23,738 --> 00:19:24,873
You are going too fast.

505
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:27,375
-We're all doing it for 12 hours.
-Is that so?

506
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:30,412
-This is so good, seriously.
-It's addictive.

507
00:19:30,478 --> 00:19:32,847
DINDIN LOOKS SOMEWHAT SUSPICIOUS

508
00:19:32,914 --> 00:19:35,217
To be honest, I couldn't care less.

509
00:19:35,951 --> 00:19:37,986
I was too tired to exercise anymore.

510
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:39,321
I was exhausted,

511
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:40,789
and there was so much time left.

512
00:19:41,256 --> 00:19:43,191
<i>So I was trying to talk to stall.</i>

513
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:46,761
<i>So I tried to keep the conversation going</i>
<i>with various topics.</i>

514
00:19:46,828 --> 00:19:48,196
Do you go camping?

515
00:19:48,263 --> 00:19:49,831
-Camping? I don't really like it.
-Yes.

516
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:51,733
TALK 1. MUNDANE DAILY LIFE

517
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,969
Now, it's almost done.

518
00:19:54,035 --> 00:19:56,771
HE'S CLUELESS AND GETS EXCITED

519
00:19:56,838 --> 00:19:59,507
TALK 2. LOVE LIFE

520
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:01,209
Can you give me a tip?

521
00:20:01,276 --> 00:20:03,311
CLUELESSLY ASKING FOR ADVICE

522
00:20:03,378 --> 00:20:05,213
TALK 3. PART-TIME JOBS

523
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,148
I worked at a restaurant
called Gyeongbokgung.

524
00:20:07,215 --> 00:20:08,717
It was Don Day in my day.

525
00:20:08,783 --> 00:20:10,018
I worked at a <i>gopchang</i> place.

526
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:12,187
-You worked part-time at a gopchang place?
-Yes.

527
00:20:12,654 --> 00:20:14,556
THE CONVERSATION GOES ON AND ON LIKE THAT

528
00:20:15,223 --> 00:20:17,425
<i>To be honest, I wasn't really curious.</i>

529
00:20:17,993 --> 00:20:20,695
THEY SPENT AN HOUR TALKING
WITHOUT EXERCISING

530
00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:23,765
GRUNTING

531
00:20:23,832 --> 00:20:24,833
CLINK

532
00:20:24,899 --> 00:20:26,801
SUSPICIOUS SOUND COMING FROM DARKNESS

533
00:20:26,868 --> 00:20:28,870
Working so hard without a camera?

534
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:32,741
DANIEL IS EXERCISING ALONE?

535
00:20:32,807 --> 00:20:34,776
WHILE THEY WERE TALKING A WHILE AGO

536
00:20:34,843 --> 00:20:36,978
You must be considering Jonathan.

537
00:20:37,045 --> 00:20:38,613
That punk's definitely an anchovy.

538
00:20:40,081 --> 00:20:42,951
DANIEL LEAVES THE ROOM QUIETLY

539
00:20:43,418 --> 00:20:44,719
He talks too much.

540
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:45,954
For God's sake.

541
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:50,625
HE GOT AWAY AND BEGAN EXERCISING
TO EARN MONEY

542
00:20:51,426 --> 00:20:52,527
Twenty, right?

543
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:55,697
Gosh, it hurts!

544
00:20:57,165 --> 00:20:58,199
God, I'm dying.

545
00:20:58,266 --> 00:20:59,467
Hey, where did Daniel go?

546
00:20:59,934 --> 00:21:03,004
<i>Daniel was away for too long,</i>
<i>so I went out.</i>

547
00:21:03,571 --> 00:21:04,606
What are you doing?

548
00:21:04,673 --> 00:21:06,808
-It was never-ending.
-What's wrong with you?

549
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:10,345
We're having a warm conversation together.
How could you do this alone?

550
00:21:10,412 --> 00:21:12,647
-It's never-ending. I didn't do much.
-Just come talk with us.

551
00:21:12,714 --> 00:21:13,715
All right.

552
00:21:13,782 --> 00:21:16,651
<i>DinDin won 19,000 won through the quiz.</i>

553
00:21:16,718 --> 00:21:18,153
<i>How do I catch up?</i>

554
00:21:18,219 --> 00:21:21,122
I thought that
I might not be able to close the gap

555
00:21:21,189 --> 00:21:23,325
if I didn't keep exercising until the end.

556
00:21:23,792 --> 00:21:26,461
DESPERATELY EXERCISING TO CLOSE THE GAP

557
00:21:26,528 --> 00:21:29,264
+2,000 WON

558
00:21:29,331 --> 00:21:30,565
Where's Daniel?

559
00:21:31,099 --> 00:21:32,967
He's such a lunatic.

560
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:34,936
-What's wrong with you?
-What?

561
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:36,237
-Why do this?
-What?

562
00:21:36,304 --> 00:21:37,772
-Why are you being like this?
-What?

563
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:39,207
Why are you going so far?

564
00:21:39,274 --> 00:21:40,875
You'll keep going for two hours?

565
00:21:40,942 --> 00:21:42,444
Yes, I'll do it, without rest.

566
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:46,614
I just did two.

567
00:21:47,482 --> 00:21:48,883
-Hey, get ready!
-Hold on.

568
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,652
You can bring the pizza.

569
00:21:50,719 --> 00:21:52,053
Come on.

570
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,521
CALLED IN THE MIDDLE OF EATING

571
00:21:53,588 --> 00:21:55,090
Hold on. I need some soda.

572
00:21:55,156 --> 00:21:57,092
No, no. I'll count myself, then.

573
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,295
<i>He's so crazy.</i>

574
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:01,529
<i>He's obsessed.</i>

575
00:22:01,596 --> 00:22:04,566
<i>He just hates to see me win so smoothly.</i>

576
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:07,502
<i>Whoever it is, I wanted to stop him</i>
<i>from winning today.</i>

577
00:22:07,569 --> 00:22:08,603
<i>That's it.</i>

578
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:11,039
MADLY WANTING TO STOP ANYONE FROM WINNING

579
00:22:11,106 --> 00:22:13,708
MADLY WANTING TO MAINTAIN THE LEAD

580
00:22:13,775 --> 00:22:15,377
<i>I'll keep going until the end.</i>

581
00:22:15,443 --> 00:22:17,445
+3,200 WON

582
00:22:18,012 --> 00:22:19,581
+3,500 WON

583
00:22:20,415 --> 00:22:22,684
TRYING TO BEAT EACH OTHER

584
00:22:22,751 --> 00:22:25,787
THEY'RE MAINTAINING THE FASTEST PACE EVER

585
00:22:25,854 --> 00:22:26,855
Okay.

586
00:22:28,757 --> 00:22:31,126
-What? Why go this far?
-Why go this far?

587
00:22:31,192 --> 00:22:32,193
Seriously.

588
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,062
-Why go this far?
-Why go this far?

589
00:22:34,629 --> 00:22:36,264
-Geez!
-Geez!

590
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:38,199
-Gosh!
-Gosh!

591
00:22:39,768 --> 00:22:42,570
WHAT'S THIS PERFECT CHEMISTRY?

592
00:22:42,637 --> 00:22:45,573
Our chemistry was good
when we were trying to ruin each other.

593
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,675
-Let's take a five-minute break.
-Let's take five.

594
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:49,210
-A smoke break.
-Let's go.

595
00:22:49,277 --> 00:22:51,212
-Want to go together?
-Yes, let's go.

596
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:52,714
-You go first.
-Okay.

597
00:22:52,781 --> 00:22:54,949
-You go ahead. Don't cheat and squat.
-Okay.

598
00:22:55,016 --> 00:22:56,251
Putting on my shoes. One.

599
00:22:56,317 --> 00:22:57,852
-Don't squat!
-Two.

600
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:58,953
It's eight.

601
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:05,160
BUT THIS FEELS LIKE…

602
00:23:09,564 --> 00:23:12,000
-Hey, it's easier to just give up.
-Look.

603
00:23:12,066 --> 00:23:14,369
I think you're the one who should give up.

604
00:23:15,303 --> 00:23:18,039
I can't. I can't give up now.

605
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:19,841
That's why I'm going to stop you winning.

606
00:23:20,675 --> 00:23:21,843
No matter what.

607
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:24,045
I like betting my life on the impossible.

608
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,881
That's how I've been living.

609
00:23:27,348 --> 00:23:29,384
I don't think I'll have a better chance.

610
00:23:30,151 --> 00:23:31,786
So I have to seize it.

611
00:23:33,254 --> 00:23:35,256
Then let's be cool and give it our all.

612
00:23:36,691 --> 00:23:38,359
-Let's keep going, then.
-Okay.

613
00:23:38,426 --> 00:23:39,461
Perfect.

614
00:23:40,762 --> 00:23:41,763
It's perfect.

615
00:23:45,433 --> 00:23:49,170
MEANWHILE,
THE OTHER GUYS OF TEAM SACRIFICE

616
00:23:49,237 --> 00:23:50,238
Thank you.

617
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:53,608
THEY ARE EARNING MONEY BIT BY BIT

618
00:23:53,675 --> 00:23:54,943
Oh, okay.

619
00:23:55,009 --> 00:23:56,644
I just reached 10,000 won.

620
00:23:56,711 --> 00:23:58,880
-How much have you earned?
-6,000 won.

621
00:23:58,947 --> 00:24:01,916
If we combine our money,
we'll beat DinDin for sure.

622
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:02,984
-Two of us?
-Yes.

623
00:24:03,051 --> 00:24:04,686
-You and me?
-No, you and me

624
00:24:04,752 --> 00:24:06,287
-and Daniel.
-Then, of course.

625
00:24:06,354 --> 00:24:08,823
-If no one has a change of heart.
-Hey, don't you dare.

626
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:11,059
If you do,
you'll end up being a loser anyway.

627
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,561
I mean, seriously.

628
00:24:13,628 --> 00:24:16,197
I will make you king today.

629
00:24:16,264 --> 00:24:18,733
-Good. As long as DinDin doesn't win.
-Right.

630
00:24:20,702 --> 00:24:21,769
Listen.

631
00:24:22,637 --> 00:24:23,938
Can you lend me 1,000 won?

632
00:24:25,273 --> 00:24:26,508
-What for?
-Well,

633
00:24:26,574 --> 00:24:28,476
I have so little, so…

634
00:24:28,543 --> 00:24:30,245
But you pocketed my 500 won earlier.

635
00:24:30,945 --> 00:24:32,981
-The deposit.
-The deposit? Come on.

636
00:24:33,815 --> 00:24:36,417
-Right, you let me drink soda. Okay.
-I did.

637
00:24:36,951 --> 00:24:38,419
-All right.
-Thanks.

638
00:24:38,486 --> 00:24:40,488
DinDin gave me a tip earlier.

639
00:24:41,422 --> 00:24:42,824
Wow, he even gave him a tip?

640
00:24:42,891 --> 00:24:43,892
Goodness.

641
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:46,661
-He still thinks I'm on his side.
-Right.

642
00:24:46,728 --> 00:24:48,162
THEY'RE BACK, RESOLUTE

643
00:24:48,229 --> 00:24:50,465
Come on. Hey.

644
00:24:50,532 --> 00:24:52,367
Let's call it and begin at the same time.

645
00:24:52,433 --> 00:24:53,434
-Okay.
-Good.

646
00:24:53,501 --> 00:24:54,869
Ready.

647
00:24:54,936 --> 00:24:55,937
-Go!
-Go!

648
00:24:56,004 --> 00:24:58,706
ROUND 2 BEGINS RIGHT AWAY

649
00:24:58,773 --> 00:25:01,309
Seven. Eight. Nine.

650
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:04,412
<i>What does this mean?</i>

651
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:07,482
It's "S."

652
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:08,783
It's a secret code.

653
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:10,051
"Sacrifice."

654
00:25:11,152 --> 00:25:12,387
Sacrifice.

655
00:25:12,954 --> 00:25:13,988
Sacrifice.

656
00:25:14,055 --> 00:25:15,657
We're now Team Sacrifice.

657
00:25:16,357 --> 00:25:18,359
-Remember this sign.
-Okay.

658
00:25:18,426 --> 00:25:20,128
A SECRET SIGN OF THEIR ALLEGIANCE

659
00:25:20,194 --> 00:25:23,131
SACRIFICE YOURSELF

660
00:25:23,197 --> 00:25:25,466
TEAM SACRIFICE IS FIRM AND STRONG

661
00:25:25,533 --> 00:25:28,503
MEANWHILE, DINDIN IS ON HIS OWN

662
00:25:29,904 --> 00:25:31,139
O3ohn, close the door.

663
00:25:34,042 --> 00:25:36,077
Hey, how much do you have?

664
00:25:36,144 --> 00:25:37,245
I have 8,000 won.

665
00:25:37,312 --> 00:25:38,479
"HE ACTUALLY HAS 10,000 WON"

666
00:25:38,546 --> 00:25:40,281
-You have to give it to me.
-Okay.

667
00:25:40,348 --> 00:25:42,350
Hey, how much do you have? Roughly.

668
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:43,985
-Almost 30,000 won.
-Almost 30,000 won?

669
00:25:44,852 --> 00:25:46,421
-That might not be enough.
-I know.

670
00:25:46,487 --> 00:25:47,488
PRYING FOR INFORMATION

671
00:25:47,555 --> 00:25:48,690
It'll be okay if I get yours.

672
00:25:48,756 --> 00:25:50,525
Does he still trust you?

673
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:52,126
Does DinDin trust you?

674
00:25:52,193 --> 00:25:54,729
NODDING

675
00:25:56,364 --> 00:25:58,066
I don't know why, though.

676
00:26:00,034 --> 00:26:01,736
<i>I thought it was going well</i>

677
00:26:01,803 --> 00:26:05,873
<i>when something crossed my mind.</i>
<i>Their teamwork.</i>

678
00:26:06,341 --> 00:26:07,909
<i>That could be a game changer.</i>

679
00:26:07,976 --> 00:26:09,477
But I did think that

680
00:26:09,544 --> 00:26:11,813
it was over if O3ohn was on my side.

681
00:26:11,879 --> 00:26:14,148
KINGMAKER O3OHN

682
00:26:14,215 --> 00:26:17,118
TO DINDIN, O3OHN IS SO CRUCIAL

683
00:26:17,185 --> 00:26:19,020
Have a seat. Sit down.

684
00:26:19,087 --> 00:26:20,088
Sit down.

685
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:23,558
Let me make it clear.
Daniel and I are exercising nonstop,

686
00:26:24,058 --> 00:26:25,193
but it's pointless.

687
00:26:25,259 --> 00:26:28,363
Because he and I keep going like this,
it won't make any difference.

688
00:26:28,429 --> 00:26:30,965
But you guys, the ones who support us,

689
00:26:31,032 --> 00:26:33,167
it all depends on

690
00:26:33,234 --> 00:26:34,702
how much you earn.

691
00:26:34,769 --> 00:26:38,206
What I'm saying is, it all depends
on how much you and O3ohn exercise.

692
00:26:39,073 --> 00:26:40,174
Let me tell you clearly.

693
00:26:40,642 --> 00:26:41,809
O3ohn helps me,

694
00:26:41,876 --> 00:26:43,077
and I win this time,

695
00:26:43,144 --> 00:26:45,413
then one, one, two keychains.

696
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,048
And if I help O3ohn next time,

697
00:26:47,582 --> 00:26:49,417
then he'll win next time.

698
00:26:50,118 --> 00:26:51,386
That's right.

699
00:26:51,452 --> 00:26:53,855
So it's only right for him to help me.

700
00:26:53,921 --> 00:26:55,623
All right, let me tell you something.

701
00:26:56,124 --> 00:26:58,793
-We don't know about the next mission.
-No.

702
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,294
We never know

703
00:27:00,361 --> 00:27:02,997
whether it'll be
something he can help you with or not.

704
00:27:03,064 --> 00:27:05,667
No, I can help him.
I can just disturb the others.

705
00:27:05,733 --> 00:27:07,001
-Right.
-I can.

706
00:27:07,068 --> 00:27:08,836
-I can help you that way.
-How about this?

707
00:27:08,903 --> 00:27:10,071
Let's say that happens.

708
00:27:10,138 --> 00:27:11,739
If we get in your way,

709
00:27:11,806 --> 00:27:13,207
then you won't win.

710
00:27:13,274 --> 00:27:15,443
You never know what will happen.

711
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:17,945
-Right.
-One of us might ring the bell.

712
00:27:18,012 --> 00:27:19,547
You never know what will happen.

713
00:27:19,614 --> 00:27:21,082
What's the right bet for you?

714
00:27:21,816 --> 00:27:24,052
-It is me.
-Right.

715
00:27:24,118 --> 00:27:26,120
-You can't go against it.
-Right.

716
00:27:26,187 --> 00:27:27,689
If you choose to help him,

717
00:27:27,755 --> 00:27:29,524
it'll only make it harder for you.

718
00:27:31,125 --> 00:27:33,695
<i>O3ohn's decision is</i>
<i>very crucial here, actually.</i>

719
00:27:33,761 --> 00:27:37,098
Because Daniel and I won't be
enough to beat DinDin.

720
00:27:37,165 --> 00:27:38,866
<i>If O3ohn helps DinDin,</i>

721
00:27:38,933 --> 00:27:40,435
<i>he'll be likely to win.</i>

722
00:27:40,935 --> 00:27:44,005
IT'S TIME TO MAKE A DECISIVE MOVE

723
00:27:44,072 --> 00:27:46,340
Hey, let me say something
for the last time.

724
00:27:46,407 --> 00:27:47,675
-I mean it.
-Okay.

725
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:50,244
You're third place in looks.

726
00:27:51,245 --> 00:27:52,547
And I'm in fourth place.

727
00:27:53,448 --> 00:27:54,849
You're third place in looks.

728
00:27:55,917 --> 00:27:57,018
And I'm in fourth place.

729
00:27:57,952 --> 00:28:00,188
Wow, this is big. Really big.

730
00:28:00,254 --> 00:28:02,156
-Are you admitting it?
-I can make it official.

731
00:28:02,223 --> 00:28:04,025
O3ohn is more handsome than me.

732
00:28:04,092 --> 00:28:06,027
EXCLUSIVE:
DANIEL ADMITS HE'S UGLIER THAN O3OHN

733
00:28:06,094 --> 00:28:08,596
Listen, O3ohn.
I think of you as my brother.

734
00:28:08,663 --> 00:28:10,231
-For real?
-For real.

735
00:28:10,732 --> 00:28:12,567
I just like you.

736
00:28:13,201 --> 00:28:15,002
We're sworn brothers.

737
00:28:16,971 --> 00:28:18,005
<i>I'm confused.</i>

738
00:28:18,072 --> 00:28:20,007
<i>It's like I'm caught up</i>
<i>in a love triangle.</i>

739
00:28:20,074 --> 00:28:23,211
Two guys confessed
their love for me just now.

740
00:28:23,277 --> 00:28:27,882
I feel as if I'm one of those popular guys
on those date shows.

741
00:28:27,949 --> 00:28:30,451
<i>Both say they like me.</i>

742
00:28:30,518 --> 00:28:32,220
I AM AN ANCHOVY

743
00:28:32,286 --> 00:28:34,088
Hey, you guys do it too.

744
00:28:34,589 --> 00:28:35,623
O3ohn, do it here.

745
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:36,891
-O3ohn.
-Yes?

746
00:28:36,958 --> 00:28:38,226
What?

747
00:28:38,793 --> 00:28:40,161
-What is it?
-Hey.

748
00:28:40,228 --> 00:28:42,864
O3ohn. That punk's going to join him.
Damn it.

749
00:28:43,331 --> 00:28:44,665
I love you.

750
00:28:44,732 --> 00:28:45,733
You're my brother.

751
00:28:46,334 --> 00:28:48,803
GIVING IN TO DINDIN SWEET TEMPTATION?

752
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:50,571
While we filmed this show,

753
00:28:50,638 --> 00:28:52,273
DinDin was always like that.

754
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,574
-Right.
-"I'll help you."

755
00:28:53,641 --> 00:28:55,276
-Right.
-"Don't you trust me?"

756
00:28:55,343 --> 00:28:58,579
Right, that's how
I lost 4,000 won to him earlier.

757
00:28:58,646 --> 00:29:02,717
OR TAKING REVENGE ON DINDIN
WITH TEAM SACRIFICE?

758
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,021
To be honest,

759
00:29:07,088 --> 00:29:09,724
Daniel and DinDin are no different

760
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:10,892
to me.

761
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:13,027
Both annoy me and get under my skin.

762
00:29:13,094 --> 00:29:15,329
<i>They both ate my ice cream.</i>

763
00:29:15,396 --> 00:29:18,399
<i>If only one of them did,</i>
<i>I'd lean toward the other.</i>

764
00:29:18,466 --> 00:29:19,467
Those crazy bastards.

765
00:29:20,101 --> 00:29:22,236
<i>Gosh, I'm so torn.</i>

766
00:29:22,303 --> 00:29:25,239
O3OHN AGONIZES

767
00:29:25,306 --> 00:29:27,642
<i>When I heard about Operation Sacrifice,</i>

768
00:29:28,342 --> 00:29:29,911
<i>I completely leaned toward it.</i>

769
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:34,682
I was determined
to stab DinDin in the back at the end.

770
00:29:35,716 --> 00:29:38,653
But I don't know anymore.
I started to think

771
00:29:38,719 --> 00:29:42,523
that maybe it wouldn't be so bad
to join hands with DinDin.

772
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:45,426
WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT?

773
00:29:45,493 --> 00:29:46,694
-Are we good?
-Yes.

774
00:29:47,595 --> 00:29:48,663
Why are you not doing this?

775
00:29:48,729 --> 00:29:49,864
He might see it.

776
00:29:49,931 --> 00:29:51,432
-He keeps looking out.
-Is that so?

777
00:29:51,899 --> 00:29:53,000
<i>I think</i>

778
00:29:53,568 --> 00:29:55,136
O3ohn's on the fence.

779
00:29:55,203 --> 00:29:56,904
I did this, but he didn't.

780
00:29:56,971 --> 00:29:59,607
<i>He didn't show me he was with me.</i>

781
00:29:59,674 --> 00:30:00,975
<i>Then I knew he switched sides.</i>

782
00:30:01,042 --> 00:30:02,043
HE CAUGHT ON RIGHT AWAY

783
00:30:02,109 --> 00:30:04,579
A MOMENT AGO

784
00:30:04,645 --> 00:30:06,547
Look at the wrapper. Show them.

785
00:30:06,614 --> 00:30:09,650
WRAPPER?

786
00:30:10,952 --> 00:30:12,153
GOO GOO CONE WRAPPER

787
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,088
Right, I forgot about the ice cream.

788
00:30:14,555 --> 00:30:15,556
You didn't eat it, right?

789
00:30:15,623 --> 00:30:16,824
I don't like ice cream.

790
00:30:16,891 --> 00:30:18,426
Didn't DinDin eat all two?

791
00:30:18,492 --> 00:30:20,728
So you lost 5,000 won.

792
00:30:21,295 --> 00:30:22,396
Yes.

793
00:30:22,463 --> 00:30:25,633
-I suddenly got curious about this.
-Okay.

794
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,603
O3OHN HAS DECIDED TO ASK HIM DIRECTLY

795
00:30:28,669 --> 00:30:31,005
Did you eat my ice cream or not?
Be honest.

796
00:30:31,806 --> 00:30:32,974
I'm sorry.

797
00:30:34,609 --> 00:30:35,710
I'm so sorry.

798
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:38,212
-So you're telling the truth.
-I am.

799
00:30:39,213 --> 00:30:40,248
Did you eat this?

800
00:30:42,984 --> 00:30:44,018
I ate half.

801
00:30:44,085 --> 00:30:45,086
MAKING AN EXCUSE

802
00:30:45,152 --> 00:30:46,354
-Okay.
-Yes.

803
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,322
So you ate it too, right?

804
00:30:48,389 --> 00:30:51,425
When Daniel admitted he ate it,

805
00:30:51,492 --> 00:30:52,827
he didn't apologize.

806
00:30:53,794 --> 00:30:55,563
He didn't say sorry.

807
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:58,032
That's what hurt me.

808
00:30:58,099 --> 00:31:00,968
You're 33,
but you're hung up on ice cream?

809
00:31:01,035 --> 00:31:03,771
-Two ice creams, not one. Okay?
-Right, two.

810
00:31:03,838 --> 00:31:07,174
It wasn't ice cream that I bought
with an allowance from my mom.

811
00:31:07,241 --> 00:31:10,878
I bought them with the money
I earned by doing hundreds of squats.

812
00:31:10,945 --> 00:31:12,113
TEAM ME FIRST

813
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:15,716
<i>I think it was the end brought about</i>
<i>by the Goo Goo Cones.</i>

814
00:31:16,317 --> 00:31:18,419
<i>Now 19 minutes and 18 seconds is left.</i>

815
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,923
HE'S BEEN EXERCISING NONSTOP
FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF

816
00:31:21,989 --> 00:31:23,157
Gosh, this is…

817
00:31:23,891 --> 00:31:25,159
This is madness.

818
00:31:25,893 --> 00:31:29,130
WHILE THE TWO EXERCISE LIKE CRAZY

819
00:31:29,196 --> 00:31:31,265
<i>Gosh, I'm so torn.</i>

820
00:31:31,332 --> 00:31:32,333
O3OHN IS MORE TORN THAN EVER

821
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,168
<i>If I choose Jonathan,</i>

822
00:31:34,235 --> 00:31:38,606
<i>I'll get revenge on DinDin</i>
<i>for all that he's done to me so far.</i>

823
00:31:38,673 --> 00:31:39,674
O3ohn.

824
00:31:40,474 --> 00:31:41,742
O3ohn, come on!

825
00:31:42,877 --> 00:31:44,245
<i>If I choose DinDin,</i>

826
00:31:44,312 --> 00:31:47,848
<i>I'll have a better chance</i>
<i>of winning my third keychain.</i>

827
00:31:48,582 --> 00:31:49,650
O3ohn!

828
00:31:50,918 --> 00:31:53,854
THE 12-HOUR RETREAT IS OVER

829
00:31:53,921 --> 00:31:57,191
WHAT WILL O3OHN'S DECISION BE?

830
00:31:57,258 --> 00:31:59,760
Now, I'll announce the final result.

831
00:31:59,827 --> 00:32:02,330
I'll tell you how much you've earned,
including the games.

832
00:32:02,863 --> 00:32:03,898
Daniel.

833
00:32:04,765 --> 00:32:05,766
Zero won.

834
00:32:06,334 --> 00:32:07,768
Wow, you're so cool.

835
00:32:08,235 --> 00:32:09,537
I mean it, you're so cool.

836
00:32:10,304 --> 00:32:11,305
O3ohn.

837
00:32:11,372 --> 00:32:13,941
KINGMAKER O3OHN'S BALANCE

838
00:32:14,408 --> 00:32:15,409
Zero won.

839
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:19,947
Now, DinDin.

840
00:32:20,982 --> 00:32:22,416
71,200 won.

841
00:32:22,917 --> 00:32:24,118
Even when he started late?

842
00:32:24,185 --> 00:32:25,853
HE'S SURE HE'LL WIN

843
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,021
Jonathan.

844
00:32:27,088 --> 00:32:29,957
71,200 WON SEEMS TOO HIGH TO BEAT

845
00:32:30,491 --> 00:32:32,827
JONATHAN'S FINAL AMOUNT?

846
00:32:32,893 --> 00:32:34,462
82,200 won.

847
00:32:34,528 --> 00:32:35,596
Congratulations.

848
00:32:39,633 --> 00:32:43,270
Jonathan will be given
his second keychain.

849
00:32:47,708 --> 00:32:50,745
Jonathan, who is this money from?

850
00:32:51,212 --> 00:32:52,646
That money is from

851
00:32:53,147 --> 00:32:55,282
me and Daniel.

852
00:32:56,317 --> 00:32:57,318
And O3ohn.

853
00:32:59,587 --> 00:33:01,989
-What?
-Did O3ohn give money to you too, DinDin?

854
00:33:02,556 --> 00:33:03,924
He gave his pouch to me.

855
00:33:04,625 --> 00:33:06,894
AN EMPTY POUCH…

856
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:11,098
O3OHN CHOSE TEAM SACRIFICE

857
00:33:12,366 --> 00:33:14,702
<i>I didn't know</i>
<i>O3ohn was in on it with them.</i>

858
00:33:16,103 --> 00:33:17,905
-Hold on.
-This is what happiness is.

859
00:33:19,106 --> 00:33:20,841
Let's hear how that bastard feels.

860
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:24,945
-Let's hear how he feels about this.
-Right, let's.

861
00:33:25,012 --> 00:33:26,914
To be honest, when time was up,

862
00:33:26,981 --> 00:33:28,482
as soon as I saw you,

863
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:30,618
I thought I had no regrets.

864
00:33:30,684 --> 00:33:33,120
-That I'd be fine with you winning.
-I felt the same.

865
00:33:33,187 --> 00:33:35,222
But when I heard that Jonathan won,

866
00:33:35,289 --> 00:33:36,657
I felt so betrayed.

867
00:33:36,724 --> 00:33:38,092
Let's hear how he feels.

868
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:42,296
Well, I ended up winning the keychain.

869
00:33:43,431 --> 00:33:45,666
I believe I won this keychain

870
00:33:47,034 --> 00:33:49,136
so that I can

871
00:33:49,537 --> 00:33:51,505
give it my all until the end.

872
00:33:51,572 --> 00:33:53,140
Thank you so much.

873
00:33:53,207 --> 00:33:55,443
And I'm happy that DinDin didn't win.

874
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:58,712
TEAM SACRIFICE HAS ACHIEVED THEIR GOAL

875
00:34:03,017 --> 00:34:04,018
Good job.

876
00:34:04,618 --> 00:34:07,088
<i>To be honest, I thought</i>

877
00:34:07,154 --> 00:34:09,523
<i>Daniel was working so hard for himself.</i>

878
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,959
But when he gave all his money
