00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,670
UNCOMFORTABLE FOUR-PARTY TALK

2
00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:04,938
Hey, so what happened?

3
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,840
Did you meet O3ohn earlier or not?

4
00:00:06,906 --> 00:00:09,409
"ONE OF THE TWO IS LYING"

5
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:12,045
-Then you're lying.
-He's so shameless.

6
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:15,081
What do you mean?

7
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:18,318
If I really did that,
I wouldn't have shown up there.

8
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:22,822
After that, I never saw him.

9
00:00:22,889 --> 00:00:25,592
I think he hid it somewhere

10
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:28,595
and came back to pretend you didn't.

11
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:31,064
We should just stay close to them all day.

12
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:33,133
ONLY DINDIN CHECKS THE MESSAGE

13
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:37,203
A HIDDEN RULE ACTIVATED

14
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:38,938
-Where are you going?
-Going out to smoke.

15
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:40,306
-Okay.
-It's 1:30?

16
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,142
Go smoke with him.

17
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,209
No.

18
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:47,647
THE GOLDEN ANCHOVY HAS BEEN
IN THE SAME PLACE FOR MORE THAN 1 HOUR

19
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,182
IT IS AT 15, MYEONG-DONG 9-GIL, JUNG-GU

20

21
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:53,420
IF THE ANCHOVY IS LEFT UNATTENDED
FOR MORE THAN 1 HOUR, THE LOCATION IS SENT

22
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,022
DinDin's gone.

23
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:57,290
"THEY HAVEN'T CHECKED

24
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,392

00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:04,731
DINDIN ARRIVES
AT 15, MYEONG-DONG 9-GIL, JUNG-GU

26
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:06,566
Hello. By any chance,

27
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:07,934
do you…

28
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:10,370
-Are you keeping a stuffed toy?
-Yes.

29
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:11,504
-Do you want it now?
-Yes.

30
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:13,039
1 HOUR AGO

31
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:14,374
Are there any coin lockers?

32
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:15,842
This is it.

33
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:18,411
-I'd like to leave some luggage here.
-Is that so?

34
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:20,113
Can I pay with cash?

35
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,315
Are you holding on to it for free?
Thank you.

36
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:24,451
I'm free now.

37
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:27,353
From now on, I just need to act

38
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,622
as if someone else took it from me.

39
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:31,624
You took it earlier.

40
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:33,626
"HE FRAMED JONATHAN"

41
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:35,261
That's so cute.

42
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:37,230
"BUT O3OHN DIDN'T KNOW
ABOUT THE HIDDEN RULE"

43
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:38,631
<i>I heard a text alert,</i>

44
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:41,234
<i>so I looked at my smartwatch,</i>

45
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:43,236
<i>But if I suddenly ran,</i>
<i>everyone would run too.</i>

46
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:45,805
<i>So I thought,</i>
<i>"What should I do? Right, I'm a smoker."</i>

47
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:48,374
<i>Then, when O3ohn suddenly asked</i>
<i>what time it was,</i>

48
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,476
<i>it scared me.</i>

49
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:51,744
<i>Then, Daniel was about</i>
<i>to take his phone out, so I said…</i>

50
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:53,513
It's 1:30.

51
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,581
<i>And I went out.</i>

52
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:59,385
But he asked me
not to give it to anyone else.

53
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:02,622
Well, he and I are a team.
He told me to retrieve it and go ahead.

54
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,390
But he said he'd be back around 5 p.m.

55
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:07,594
You can't give it to anyone but me, okay?

56
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:09,095

57
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:10,263
No, it's all right.

58
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,599
You need to give us…
You have to give it to me.

59
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,501
Really?

60
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:16,136
O3ohn and I are a team.

61
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:18,037
-Yes.
-Can we do this?

62
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,174

-I mean… O3ohn.
-So where did it go?

73
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:54,107
O3ohn.

74
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:56,976
Where's the restroom?

75
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:58,711
-It's outside.
-Outside.

83
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:19,299
It's inside. It's over there.

178
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,593
Get him!

00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,030

00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:21,974

182
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:25,678

JONATHAN GETS TIRED FIRST

186
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:40,526
He runs so well.

187
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:42,161
I lost him right in front of my eyes.

00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:50,670
Where are you, Daniel?

192
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:53,873
-You know Jeehoon, DinDin's producer?
-<i>Yeah.</i>

193
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,274
I'm following him.

194
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:58,277
He hasn't taken a bus or anything.

Gosh, I'm at a loss.

198
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,585
The producer's in league with DinDin.

199
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,086
He's going around in circles.

200
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:09,322

201
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:11,791

00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,392

-Where's he?
-You scared me.

206
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:27,073
-Where's DinDin?
-I really don't know where he is.

207
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,140
You don't know?

208
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,209
THE STAFF IS ALSO LOOKING FOR DINDIN

209
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:31,544
DINDIN IS MISSING

Hey.

211
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,480
-Did you get him?
-<i>No.</i>

212
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:38,818
-How can the producer not know?
-Even the producer can't find him.

WHERE ON EARTH IS DINDIN HEADED?

216
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:47,660
DINDIN EVEN LEFT THE STAFF BEHIND
AND DISAPPEARED

00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:49,428
Listen.

218
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,698
I should exercise and earn 20,000 won.

219
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:55,134
Because people like DinDin,

220
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,837
they're not predictable like O3ohn.

221
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,573

I'm by Euljiro 1-ga Station Exit 6.

-15,000 won? Okay.

229
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,592
But let's not betray each other
and run with it.

230
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:20,993
Let's all

00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,296
step on him a few times
and take the anchovy from him together.

00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:24,597
Then rock paper scissors among us.

233
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:25,731
Let's pick the lock.

234
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:27,300
I'll call a locksmith.

235
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:29,035
Let's call the police before we do that.

236
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:30,469
I'll say someone died inside.

237
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:32,271
I mean, the order doesn't matter.

238
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:34,440
Whether we kill him after calling them

239
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:37,710

going past Sungnyemun Gate toward Namsan.

00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,462
Then I think we should go to Yongsan.

Let's go to Yongsan.

261
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:37,536
Hey, how about we take a cab
and go near DinDin's place?

262
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:39,639
He was probably
born and raised in Ichon-dong.

263
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:41,474
-I see.
-Hey, he must be going to his mom.

264
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:43,676
-He's going to his mom.
-In Ichon-dong?

265
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:45,678
He's a mama's boy.

266
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:46,812
He's going to his mom.

267
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:49,382
-You're right.
-He looks for his mom at times like this.

00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:08,334
All right, I'm sure they think
I'm going to Ichon-dong.

271
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:11,470
Let's think again after hiding this.

272
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,974
If I go stay in my mom's place,
how will they get in, right?

273
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,743
No, judging by the look
in Jonathan's eyes earlier,

274
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,046
I'm sure he will get in.

275

he'd shove my mom and get in.

Hey, Bus 6211. Hold on.

277
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,522
Look, I'm sure he's going
to his parents' house.

278
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:31,957
He's going to Ichon-dong.
We have to go now.

-Let's talk after we get there.

-Yes, let's go now.

-Take a cab?

-Okay.

00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,006
And some dessert if you want.

286
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:49,275
And there's a good <i>tteokbokki</i> place.
We can go there.

287
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:53,079
By the way,
when we were eating together earlier,

288
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:54,714
we agreed to call a truce.

289
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,149
I never imagined
he'd suddenly betray us and run.

290
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,484
I'll fold him in half.

291
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,186
I'll beat him up, seriously.

292
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:02,822

-Jonathan, did you fart?
-Jonathan!

296
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,164
No, this kind of smell comes up
around this time.

297
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,066
-I didn't fart.
-Come on, man!

298
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,668
Sir, I'll open the window.

299
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,170
The car's fine.
It's coming from the sewers.

300
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:21,173
Hey, how could you fart
while we're filming?

301
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,842
It smells like a stink bug.

302
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,777
It's from the sewers.

Then he got off at Ichon-dong.

306
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:34,954
I think he got off around here.

307
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,021
He got off.

315
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,174
Let me be honest.

316
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:56,442
They'll never get me.

317
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:59,311
If I escaped from prison and
hid in Ichon-dong, I'd never get caught.

319
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:03,382
I played "Police and Thief"
for more than 10 years here.

320
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:07,019
The game would begin in the morning
and end at midnight.

321
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,387
Because they couldn't catch me.

322
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,056

-Iced Americano for me.

349
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:01,307
"HE FORGOT HE'S THE FUGITIVE"

350
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:02,441
Everyone wants Iced Americano?

351
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,109
Eight Iced Americanos.

352
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,278
And one latte.

353
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:11,016
Seven Iced Americanos and one latte.

354
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:13,652
Hold on. Damn it.

355
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,523
I used my card.

356
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,924
This is bad. What do I do?

357
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:20,793
The location will be sent.

358
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,329
I should've paid later.

359
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,865
It's drip coffee, so it'll take long.

360
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,201
"DRIP COFFEE TAKES QUITE LONG"

361
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,037
No.

362
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:34,273
I'm the king here. I know all the alleys.

363
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,910
PAYMENT APPROVED, LIM CHEOL, 77,000 WON

364
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,778
-He paid 77,000 won.
-What?

365
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:43,048
-What?
-What is this place?

366
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:45,985
It's a coffee place in Ichon-dong.

367
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:48,520
It's right in front
of Yonggang Middle School.

368
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:50,756
There used to be a <i>tteokbokki</i> place
next to it.

369
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:51,824
I know where it is.

370
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,793
-Let us get out at the next crosswalk.
-Yes.

371
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:57,029
If they get me here, I can't do anything.

372
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:01,700
Should I not have ordered drip coffee?

373
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:04,603
HE'S GETTING ANXIOUS

374
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,704
Thank you.

375
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,275
-You see the red-brick building?
-Yes.

376
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:10,776
-It's behind it.
-Right.

377
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:11,844
-You know, right?
-Yes.

378
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,079
-Oh, it's behind that?
-Yes, right behind.

379
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:17,650
THEY GOT OUT OF THE CAB NEAR THE CAFÉ

380
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:19,018
Should we split up?

381
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,487
Then should I and O3ohn go together?
Or what?

382
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:22,888
Then let's meet up there.

383
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,657
-Are you going alone?
-Yes, I'll go this way.

384
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:26,892
-Let's meet at the<i> jjimdak</i> place.
-Okay.

385
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,695
THEY CLOSE IN FROM BOTH SIDES

386
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:30,930
I should go this way.

387
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:33,866
Since he knows this area well,

388
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,434
he'll take a shortcut.

389
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:39,939
THEY SPEED UP THE CHASE

390
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,341
Still, you came to my neighborhood,

391
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,209
so I had to get you good coffee.

392
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:47,279
A MAN WHO TAKES A MOMENT TO ENJOY COFFEE

393
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,983
Do you know where B café is?

394
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,251
-It's here.
-This is it?

395
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:53,585
Downstairs? Thanks.

396
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:55,054
Here's your coffee.

397
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,624
It's around the corner. Careful.

398
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,693
He might be around here.

399
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:01,961
It's there.

400
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:03,729
There, right in front of
the <i>jjimdak</i> place.

401
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,064
"THEY SURROUND THE CAFÉ DINDIN IS IN"

402
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,433
Should we wait in ambush or get him now?

403
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:09,168
Let's get him. You stay here.

404
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:13,072
"HE GOES INTO THE CAFÉ"

405
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:17,142
Hello. Did DinDin come here?

406
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:18,210
-He was just here.
-Yes.

407
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,279
He was just here? He left?

408
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:21,647
Are you sure he left?

409
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,816
But did he pay 7,000 won later too?

410
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:24,950
Yes, he paid himself.

411
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:27,353
-He just left? That's impossible.
-Damn it.

412
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:28,687
Wasn't he in the straight alley?

413
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,155
-You didn't see him?
-He wasn't.

414
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,191
What the heck?

415
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,994
JUST 2 MINUTES AGO

416
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,463
Let's go. Now let's go to a <i>bingsu</i> place.

417
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,933
I graduated from this middle school.

418
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,835
RIGHT WHEN DINDIN LEFT THE CAFÉ
WITH COFFEE

419
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:44,403
Do you know where B café is?

420
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,071
THE PURSUERS WERE VERY CLOSE TO THE CAFÉ

421
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:47,206
Is it this way?

422
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:49,108
"CAFÉ"

423
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,709
It's around the corner. Careful.

424
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:53,245
"ONLY LOOKING AHEAD, THEY DIDN'T SEE HIM"

425
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:54,513
Hello.

426
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,217
JONATHAN AND O3OHN UNDER GREEN ROOF

427
00:16:58,283 --> 00:16:59,852
GREEN ROOF

428
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:02,488
THEY MISSED HIM JUST 80 M AWAY

429
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:04,723
Gosh, this is so nice.

430
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,258
HE ESCAPED THE DRAGNET WITH PERFECT TIMING

431
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,027
We missed him right in front of us.

432
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,262
Have you seen DinDin?

433
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,597
-Yes, I have.
-Where is he?

434
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:13,532
-He was in that alley.
-Just now?

435
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,434
-The market alley?
-Yes.

436
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,469
-Exactly when did you see him?
-About five minutes ago?

437
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:18,537
-Five minutes?
-Yes.

438
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:20,439
Then you go that way.
Let's meet in the market.

439
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:21,673
-Okay.
-Okay.

440
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,443
WHILE THEY LOOK AROUND THE MARKET
DUE TO THE WRONG INFORMATION

441
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,778
This way.

442
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:27,413
CONFIDENT

443
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:30,482
THROUGH THE ALLEYS
OUTSIDERS WOULDN'T KNOW ABOUT

444
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,584
HE AVOIDS BEING SEEN

445
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:35,554
<i>I know my way around the neighborhood,</i>

446
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:37,356
so I was sure I wouldn't get caught.

447
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:39,058
They'll never get me.

448
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:41,093
Now, there are two courses here.

449
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,295
If they come from that side,

450
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:45,497
we'll go straight and go around,

451
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,399
or go to the church…
Oh, let's go to the church.

452
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:48,934
Hangang Church.

453
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,803
Let's pick up some<i> bingsu</i>
and go to the Hangang Church.

454
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:51,937
No one will know.

455
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:54,139
We'll enjoy the <i>bingsu</i> there peacefully

456
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:56,575
and run when the right chance comes.

457
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:58,110
Okay.

458
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,014
HE PLANS TO HIDE AT A PLACE IN THE CORNER

459
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,749
<i>They'll never even imagine it.</i>

460
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:05,617

00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:11,290

465
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:13,792

D Bingsu<i>.</i> Hold on, where is it?

467
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,464
Hey, it's in front of that hospital.

468
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,166
Right. Let's go there first.

469
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:22,935
I know my way around Ichon-dong.

470
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:24,803
-How?
-I used to live there.

471
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,306
-So did I. You've been to the east side?
-Yes.

472
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:29,074
-Across the train tracks.
-Right.

473
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:31,477
JONATHAN STARTS CHASING HIM RIGHT AWAY

474
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:34,079
We have to get to the <i>bingsu</i> place.

475
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:36,482
That punk, he's planning to betray us.

476
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:38,117
-To catch him by himself.
-Yes.

477
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:40,819
But he'll never catch him.
DinDin's so fast.

478
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,654
Let's just use a chance.

479
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:44,590
-Tell me about it.
-After earning enough.

480
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:48,460
MEANWHILE, JONATHAN IS
DETERMINED TO CHASE HIM

481
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:50,462
Let's take a shortcut too.

482
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:51,930
I know a few shortcuts.

483
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:54,566
He's an Ichon-dong Boy, indeed.

484
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:56,335
He knows his way around here.

00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,708

I'm sure of it.

00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:10,616
It's really good.

00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:14,019

00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:19,291
Since both sides are wide open,

00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:20,792
we can run either way.

498
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,694
And we can come back around.

499
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:24,396
What if the three come from both sides?

500
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:25,764
They won't.

He's not taking the main streets anymore.

00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,208
He's taking those small alleys now.

505
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:38,977
So we should chase him through the alleys.

00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,765
Hey, bring the <i>bingsu</i>!

525
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,568
What did I say?

526
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:40,973
THE SECOND CHANCE TO CATCH DINDIN

527
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,577
HE CHASES HIM AS BEST HE CAN

528
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:49,715
BUT DINDIN HAS VANISHED AGAIN

529
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:57,556
Come here!

530
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:58,957
Come here!

531
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:01,860
Get down.

532
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,368
Jonathan's going that way.

533
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:13,205
Jonathan's going that way.

534
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,907
"RIGHT IN FRONT OF DINDIN,
JONATHAN GOES AWAY"

535
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:16,975
He's gone that way.

536
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:19,044
Let's get back to the <i>bingsu.</i> He's gone.

537
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:27,486
They must come together.

538
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:30,455
Or they'll never catch me in Ichon-dong.

539
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:32,691
"ONLY A NATIVE OF ICHON-DONG
CAN PULL THIS OFF"

540
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:33,859
God, he's scary.

541
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:35,494
He didn't come this way.

542
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:38,997
If he did, I would've found him.

543
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,099
He must've gone the opposite way.

544
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,167
"HE'S NOT GIVING UP"

545
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:43,535
He didn't come this way!

546
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:48,674
Oh, there he is!

547
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:52,978
DINDIN SEEN IN THE DISTANCE

548
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:56,915
THE THIRD CHANCE TO CATCH DINDIN

549
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:58,417
Damn it!

550
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:05,724
Get out of the way!

551
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,961
DINDIN GOES STRAIGHT

552
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,665
JONATHAN TURNS RIGHT

553
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,101
Damn it! Turn around!

554
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,272
Get out of the way!

555
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:24,876
"TENACIOUS ICHON-DONG YOUNG BOY"

556
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:27,713
No!

557
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,052
<i>I think I'm pretty fast.</i>

558
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,421
<i>My ancestors came to my mind.</i>

559
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:37,856
<i>And Usain Bolt.</i>

560
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:41,460
AFTER THE TENACIOUS CHASE

561
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:45,597
HE FINALLY CATCHES THE FUGITIVE

562
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:53,238
Why don't we have some <i>bingsu</i> first?
Jonathan.

563
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:54,406
After you hand it over.

564
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:59,478
"SADLY, THE BAG IS EMPTY"

565
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:01,980
Jonathan, let's have some <i>bingsu.</i>

566
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,248
It's not here.

567
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:06,284
Where is it?

568
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:07,619
I bought some for you too.

569
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:09,621
-Where is it?
-I'll tell you after eating the <i>bingsu.</i>

570
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:12,290
BECAUSE WE CAN'T
LET THE BINGSU MELT!

571
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:14,126
Geez, you're impressive.

572
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,595
-How did you know?
-Look.

573
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:18,130
You've been

574
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,766
-running between the blocks.
-Right.

575
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,735
I know which block
comes after which block.

576
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:25,871
They told me to go this way,
but I went around it.

577
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:28,807
Right, I overlooked the fact
that Jonathan used to live here.

578
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:31,076
So, DinDin, what's next?

579
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:32,811
I'll go retrieve the anchovy.

580
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:35,547
Because, if you and I don't retrieve it,

581
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:37,983
-the location will be sent to them.
-Right.

582
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:39,418
Then they'll take it.

583
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:40,886
So we should take it.

584
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:43,054
CURRENT TIME
3:51 P.M.

585
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:45,624
45 MINUTES SINCE
HE HID THE ANCHOVY

586
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,960
15 MINUTES LEFT
UNTIL THE LOCATION IS SENT

587
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:53,098
JONATHAN NEEDS DINDIN UNTIL THEN

588
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:57,035
AND DINDIN MUST
RUN AWAY BEFORE THEN

589
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,236
This is hard.

590
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:07,279
So everyone

591
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:09,080
-You want to go first?
-hides it once.

592
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:10,882
No. Let's go together.

593
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:13,285
But we should clean it up.

594
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:15,554
-Yes. We need wet wipes.
-What should we do?

595
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,621
Do we have wet wipes?

596
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:19,157
LOOKING FOR WET WIPES

597
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:23,995
GET READY

598
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,097
GRINNING

599
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,300
HE TAPS HER

600
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:32,304
DINDIN RUNS AWAY AGAIN

601
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:36,475
If I catch you this time, I'll…

602
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:41,146
THE SHORT GUY RUNS HARD

603
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:45,383
BUT HE CATCHES UP FAST LIKE BOLT

604
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,018
You can't escape me.

605
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:50,922
IT LASTED 10 SECONDS

606
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,859
JONATHAN DOESN'T
HOLD BACK ANYMORE

607
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:55,627
No.

608
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:56,895
I'll throw up, Jonathan.

609
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:57,963
I'll throw up.

610
00:24:58,029 --> 00:24:59,464
Jonathan, I'll throw up.

611
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:02,567
"HE BARELY AVOIDS THROWING UP"

612
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:03,869
All right, I won't run.

613
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:07,272
"HOLDING TIGHT"

614
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,673
I'll make it hard for you.

615
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:10,909
Since you refused freedom yourself.

616
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,478
I should knock him out and carry him.

617
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:14,779
He keeps running.

618
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,382
He might run this way.

619
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:18,750
"WHILE DINDIN'S BEING THREATENED"

620
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:20,652
Let's stop here for a while.

621
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:23,121
A chance has been activated just now.

622
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,556
-<i>A chance?</i>
-<i>Yes.</i>

623
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:25,957
A CHANCE ACTIVATED!

624
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,026
We haven't found him yet.

625
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:30,061
It means DinDin's already gotten away.

626
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:31,596
Let's earn enough money first.

627
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:34,733
"THE TWO FOCUSED ON A CHANCE
INSTEAD OF CHASING HIM"

628
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,968
-We'll use the 25,000-won chance.
-All right.

629
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,603
It's a "The-Mouth-of-Truth" chance.

630
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:42,173
You can ask DinDin one question,

631
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,176
and he must tell the truth.

632
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:47,746
"ASKING A PENETRATING
QUESTION IS THE KEY"

633
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:49,915
What do you want to ask him the most?

634
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:51,283
Let's say you hid it,

635
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:52,651
and we're using a chance.

636
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:56,021
We don't need to ask anything about you,
since our goal is to find the anchovy.

637
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:57,923
So we just need to ask where it is.

638
00:25:57,989 --> 00:25:59,190
-Right?
-You have a point.

639
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:00,392
-Right?
-Yes.

640
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:03,028
WILL O3OHN BE ABLE TO
FIND OUT WHERE THE ANCHOVY IS?

641
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:05,430
I just used a chance.

642
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:07,499
-<i>You must've worked hard.</i>
-You damn bastard!

643
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:09,634
<i>You bastard!</i>

<i>I'll ask a question now.</i>

00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:21,446
Okay.

650
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:24,082
WHAT WILL O3OHN ASK HIM?

651
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:29,788
The exact address of where
you are right now,

652
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:32,457
-tap it on a map app.
-<i>Okay.</i>

653
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:34,492
And send me the exact address.

654
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,561
DINDIN'S EXACT LOCATION,
NOT THE ANCHOVY'S

655
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:38,530
Geez.

656
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,265
He's seriously asking this?

657
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:42,867
"HE CAN'T BELIEVE IT"

658
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,135
Are you sure?

659
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:48,540
Yes, the exact address.
You must send me the full address.

660
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:51,042
-He spent 25,000 won to ask this?
-I understand.

661
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:53,211
-<i>Okay.</i>
-Okay.

662
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,880
-Hey, he's an idiot.
-He spent 25,000 won and…

663
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:59,217
Didn't you say he asked for advice
before he called me?

664
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,652
They scoffed at you.

665
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:02,220
I know.

666
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:04,055
But why?

667
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:08,059
THE CURRENT LOCATION
WORTH 25,000 WON

668
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,127
Let's go.

669
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:11,663
I feel so sorry for him.

670
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,131
THEY MOVE AFTER
SENDING THE ADDRESS

671
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:16,067
AND THEY MOVE SINCE
THEY GOT THE ADDRESS

672
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,103
Why are so many people there?
Are they our staff?

673
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:19,571
Let's see.

674
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:21,773
Are they our staff? I can't see well.

675
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,108
My bad eyes.

676
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:25,577
It's Jonathan.

677
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:26,678
They're together.

678
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:27,912
Hey, they're over there.

679
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:30,315
THE CAMERA WAS MORE EFFECTIVE
THAN THE CHANCE

680
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:32,183
It'll be revealed after an hour anyway,

681
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,718
where it is.

682
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:35,286
I think it's about time.

683
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:37,555
Check your phone. You got it, right?

684
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:39,290
Right?

685
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:42,093
"THE LOCATION OF
THE GOLDEN ANCHOVY IS REVEALED!"

686
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,596

Wait!

THEY RUN AT FULL SPEED
TO WHERE THE ANCHOVY IS KEPT

690
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:05,216
THE ONE TO ARRIVE FIRST

691
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:08,720
GETS THE GOLDEN ANCHOVY

692
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,325
-The anchovy I gave you…
-You want it back?

693
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:16,628
-Give me the anchovy.
-Where did you get it?

694
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:21,199
WHO HAS POSSESSION
OF THE GOLDEN ANCHOVY?

695
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:25,737
JONATHAN HAS ACQUIRED THE GOLDEN ANCHOVY
JONATHAN IS NOW THE FUGITIVE

696
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:27,639
Let me make a suggestion.

697
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:31,109
This place is so crowded
that it's hard for us to run around.

698
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:33,478
So let's go to Hangang Park,

699
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,146
where we can run around as we want.

700
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,849
-<i>Then let's all go to Hangang Park.</i>
-<i>Okay.</i>

701
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:41,786
<i>Right now, we have</i>
<i>about an hour and 20 minutes left.</i>

702
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:44,823
You know what's funny?
The prize of the keychain,

703
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,858
I don't really want that.

704
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:49,728
I just want to hold this at the end
and feel like the king.

705
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:51,296
<i>I want to feel like</i>

706
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:53,965
<i>all these 20 episodes have been for me.</i>

707
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:55,366
Jonathan, let's go together.

708
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:57,102
-I am.
-Don't walk so fast.

709
00:28:57,168 --> 00:28:59,671
<i>I thought of tripping him up</i>
<i>as soon as it started</i>

710
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,573
<i>and taking it from him.</i>

711
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:05,110
But now that it's in Jonathan's hands,

712
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:07,212
<i>it'd be hard to take it from him by force.</i>

713
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:09,447
<i>To be honest, when they suggested</i>
<i>we go to Hangang Park,</i>

714
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:11,416
<i>all I thought about was running with it.</i>

715
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:13,218
AN INTENSE MIND GAME

716
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:15,620
I mean, how are we going to do this?

717
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:21,793
By the way, I really need to go.

718
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,461
-You want to go to the restroom?
-Yes.

719
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:25,330
-I need to go too.
-Me too.

720
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:27,132
-Then let's call a short truce.
-Shall we?

721
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:29,134
-A truce.
-Okay.

722
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,502
-It's a truce. Let's go.
-Okay.

723
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:33,605
A TEMPORARY TRUCE DUE
TO A RESTROOM BREAK?

724
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:37,609
GET READY

725
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:39,811
Get ready. Right now.

726
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,281
MYSTERIOUS HAND SIGNAL?

727
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:45,183
If I signal one,

728
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:48,086
it means I'll run.

729
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,455
<i>If I do this, you must…</i>

730
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:52,590
-<i>We get ready to run?</i>
-<i>Yes, get ready to run.</i>

731
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,594
QUIETLY MOVING TO
WHERE JONATHAN WILL RUN

732
00:29:57,228 --> 00:30:00,431
EVERYONE IN DISARRAY
DUE TO THE TRUCE

733
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:08,506
JONATHAN STARTS RUNNING AWAY

734
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,310
DINDIN STARTS CHASING HIM

735
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:14,212
Damn it. He's running again.

736
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:15,413
We won't catch him.

737
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,315
That goddamn bastard.

738
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:19,050
That punk is seriously…

739
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:22,587
THIS MAY BE HIS LAST CHANCE TO GET AWAY

740
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,422
WE HAVE TO CATCH HIM

741
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,624
Keep running. I'll keep going.

742
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:29,561
DINDIN IS GOOD AT
LONG-DISTANCE RUNNING

743
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:32,630
JONATHAN IS GOOD AT
SHORT-DISTANCE RUNNING

744
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:34,933
Jonathan, keep running.
I'll keep chasing you.

745
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,706
GOING INTO THE PARK

746
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:45,810
DINDIN HAS ALMOST CAUGHT UP

747
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:51,082
JONATHAN HAS GOTTEN TIRED FIRST

748
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,718
You can't run long-distance.

749
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:54,786
HE'S BEEN CAUGHT!

750
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:59,624
THE ONE TRYING TO GET AWAY
AND THE ONE TRYING TO STOP HIM

751
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:02,927
If you push me,
I'll fall down holding this.

752
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:05,263
-Is that so?
-Then it'll rip, I'll make sure of it.

753
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,464
I won't let you hold it.

754
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,999
But I'm already holding it.

755
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,635
<i>I thought, "This won't do.</i>

756
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,271
<i>I must knock him down to get away."</i>

757
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:14,339
DinDin.

758
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:16,808
-I have to warn you.
-Okay.

759
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:19,110
I'm going to come off strong this time.

760
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:20,311
But…

761
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:21,546
If you rip this,

762
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:23,448
-I know.
-I'll have no choice

763
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:24,983
-but to take you down.
-Right.

764
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,418
-Right.
-I'm serious. I'll do it.

765
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:29,621
-Why are you being like this?
-Let go of it.

766
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:30,855
-Let go.
-Why?

767
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:32,123
-You won't?
-What's with you?

768
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,324
DinDin, let go.

769
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,726
Hold on. Sit down for a minute.

770
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:36,494
-Sit down. Just for a moment.
-Let go.

771
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,729
Just sit down.

772
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:38,863
"THEY ARE COMING!"

773
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:39,931
There they are.

774
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:42,400
-Sit down.
-Let go, now.

775
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:45,770
"JONATHAN CHARGES IN THE END"

776
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:47,105
Seriously…

777
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:01,986
<i>The anchovy has been damaged!</i>

778
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:05,690
The anchovy has been damaged!

779
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:07,759
The anchovy has been damaged!

780
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,128
It's damaged?

781
00:32:18,202 --> 00:32:19,237
No, it's not.

782
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:21,606
Did you rip it?

783
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:23,908
-What?
-Isn't it over then?

784
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:26,044
This isn't…

785
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,445
It's not damaged.

786
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:28,880
It's still okay.

787
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:33,284
THE GOLDEN ANCHOVY PERISHES

788
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:35,019
I'll tell you the final score.

789
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:37,255
O3ohn, two anchovy keychains.

790
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:40,124
DinDin, two anchovy keychains.

791
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:42,593
Jonathan, two anchovy keychains.

792
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:44,329
Daniel, one.

793
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:48,499
Anchovy Physical Camp ends. Good work!

794
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:50,735
-What is this?
-What is this?

795
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:51,869
It's really over like this?

796
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:54,038
I clearly notified you beforehand.

797
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:56,274
But can it really end like this?

798
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,510
-Seriously end like this?
-All that we're left with are scars.

799
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:01,079
He worked really hard.

800
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:03,181
-He even hurt his finger.
-I mean, in the first episode,

801
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:04,849
we hugged each other after the push-ups.

802
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:06,617
-It was moving.
-He cried,

803
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:08,252
-What the heck?
-and I cried too.

804
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,989
-How can it end like this?
-I felt sorry for him and cried.

805
00:33:11,856 --> 00:33:14,359
-Was it all for this?
-It's insane.

806
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:16,361
FOR THIS STUPID ANCHOVY?

807
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:22,667
THEY CRIED

808
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:26,404
AND SHOUTED FOR JOY

809
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:28,072
We must do it.

810
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:30,875
-No, this is bad!
-Hey!

811
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:33,745
-You can do it!
-Don't give up!

812
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:37,248
THEY HAVE SWEATED
FOR THE PAST 5 MONTHS

813
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:39,650
I think I'll remember it for a long time.

814
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:41,853
<i>Especially when I work out.</i>

815
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,455
So, I think the end is perfect for us.

816
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,557
<i>We expressed our emotions as is,</i>

817
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:47,759
<i>being ourselves.</i>

818
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:49,093
It's been fun.

819
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,396
I didn't expect
it'd be such a mess, though.

820
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:53,231
Seriously.

821
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:54,632
I think

822
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,902
it ended like that
because we're pure-hearted.

823
00:33:57,969 --> 00:33:59,103
We didn't

824
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,906
<i>start this to try to look cool</i>
<i>or anything.</i>

825
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:06,077
<i>Anchovy Camp </i>has been consistent
from beginning to end.

826
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:09,380
Anchovy Camp <i>has been</i>
<i>like PE classes in high school.</i>

827
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:13,684
Well, I think
that's the spirit of <i>Anchovy Camp</i>.

828
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:18,790
In the end, the day ends like this.

829
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:20,691
I know.

830
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:22,593
For that stupid two million won,

831
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:26,464
I ran like crazy.
I should've just had more <i>dakgalbi.</i>

832
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:28,166
And fried rice.

833
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,500
That would've been better.

834
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,135
-Eating more food.
-Right.

835
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:33,971
-It was all in vain.
-Fried rice…

836
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:35,540
I should've had it.

837
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:36,774
Their fried rice was so good.

838
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:39,844
You should've run
after finishing the <i>dakgalbi</i>, you punks.

839
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,713
-<i>Anchovy Physical Camp!</i>
-<i>Anchovy Physical Camp!</i>

840
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,749
ANCHOVY CAMP ENDS
