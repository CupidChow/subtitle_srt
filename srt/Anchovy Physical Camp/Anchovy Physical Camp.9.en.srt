00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:09,342
THE DAY OF THE FIFTH TRAINING

2
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:12,245
-Hello. Hi.
-Hi.

3
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:13,913
What a good day to exercise.

4
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:16,383
Another has arrived.

5
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:18,752
-Is it Daniel?
-Yes, it is.

6
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:21,855
-It's raining.
-I can't see inside.

7
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:23,056
-What are you doing?
-Hello.

8
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:24,391
For goodness' sake.

9
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:26,893
Come on, it's raining.

10
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:28,928
Hello.

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,133
I mean, it's raining,
so why are we filming outdoors?

12
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:36,903
FILMING OUTDOORS FOR THE FIRST TIME
ON A RAINY DAY

13
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,539
-Oh, you brought your clothes.
-Yes, I brought extra clothes.

14
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:42,208
Come on, man. My goodness.

15
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:44,077
You're so manly
when taking your shirt off.

16
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:45,345
You do that anywhere.

17
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:46,846
I'm a "teto-guy."

18
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:48,548
"A TETO-GUY
WHO LIKES TO TAKE OFF HIS SHIRT"

19
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:49,616
Teto.

20
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:52,452
Hey, Amsa… I used to come here often
when I was little.

21
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:54,421
-I see.
-I grew up around here.

22
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:56,089
Gosh.

23
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:58,158
DinDin's still not here, as always.

24
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,093
-Gosh.
-I bet he'll arrive last.

25
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,795
He's always late.

26
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:03,797
What will we do out here?

27
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:05,165
Aren't we filming outdoors
for the first time?

28
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,332
Yes, we are.

29
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:09,636
Something we could do outdoors
within 12 hours…

30
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:10,770
You know what?

31
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:13,073
Look at the staff.

32
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:16,209
They all have towels
wrapped around their wrists.

33
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:18,078
They're ready to get rained on.

34
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:20,780
I guess we'll be sweating a lot.

35
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:22,549
Now, we'll begin.

36
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:23,850
-All right.
-What, we'll begin?

37
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,118
-Without the rest?
-They're not here.

38
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:27,320
-Yes.
-What's going on?

39
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:30,423
Hold on.

40
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,491
Hey.

41
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,561
We must have different starting points!

42
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:36,196
Hold on.

43
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,531
Where do we go?

44
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,834
"MEANWHILE, ELSEWHERE"

45
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,069
But why is it just the two of us?

46
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:44,404
DinDin, hold on.

47
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:46,339
Hey, maybe we're split into two groups?

48
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:49,309
Well, I don't know.
Maybe they're just not here yet.

49
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:50,577
No, it's not that.

50
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:53,179
Doesn't it seem like
we're separated from them?

51
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:55,181
Oh, are we supposed to
join them somewhere?

52
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:59,452
The other two are somewhere else.

53
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,554
Wow, I didn't expect this at all.

54
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,591
Now, I'll reveal
today's mission right away.

55
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:07,727
You failed the last mission, right?

56
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:08,795
-Yes.
-Yes.

57
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:10,964
I'll ring it!

58
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,367
THEY ENDED UP RINGING THE GG BELL
ON THEIR LAST MISSION

59
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:18,705
HUMILIATION THEY TASTED FOR THE FIRST TIME

60
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:21,374
I'll never ring the bell again.

61
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:22,976
I feel the same.

62
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:25,712
I'll do my best today.
I'm taking it seriously.

63
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:27,514
Today…

64
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:30,917
-Today?
-You don't seem determined.

65
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,452
Since it's raining.

66
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:35,421
I mean, after the bell was rung,

67
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,191
didn't you cry
during the interview last week?

68
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:43,396
HE FORGOT ABOUT THIS
AS SOON AS THE SHOOT ENDED

69
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:45,365
You see,

70
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,134
I erase bad memories
from my head right away.

71
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:51,638
Anyway, since you guys gave up,
we've prepared something special.

72
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:56,209
This training will strengthen
your weakened mentality.

73
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:58,945
It's called "No More Failure."

74
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,013
What?

75
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:02,916
No More Failure… Sounds about right.

76
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:04,517
We should know what it is first.

77
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:05,618
There's no more failure now.

78
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:09,489
It's one of the basic exercises
men and women of all ages can do.

79
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:11,391
It's a steady-state cardio,

80
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:13,426
walking.

81
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:14,594
Walking?

82
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:16,829
It's not running but walking?

83
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:20,633
Actually, I want to run since
the weather is perfect for it. Seriously.

84
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,801
-Walking?
-Walking?

85
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,169
-What a relief.
-Walking is nice.

86
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:26,172
You see, I walk every day.

87
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,340
I walk for about two hours.

88
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:28,641
This one's different.

89
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,778
<i>Currently, you're at</i>
<i>the opposite ends of Seoul.</i>

90
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:33,513
<i>We're currently in Gimpo.</i>

91
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,916
In 12 hours, both teams must arrive

92
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,485
at Gwanghwamun Square,
in the center of Seoul.

93
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:42,121
Hold on, how many kilometers is that?

94
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:44,290
From here?

95
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,228
How long would it take to reach
Gwanghwamun Square from here?

96
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:50,964
<i>It's like going home on foot after work.</i>

97
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,766
<i>I can't even guess</i>
<i>how many kilometers it is.</i>

98
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:57,170
<i>I mean, it would take</i>
<i>at least an hour even by car.</i>

99
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,106
In today's mission,
you two and the staff members

100
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:01,708
are a team.

101
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:03,276
-Gosh, for real?
-For real?

102
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:06,579
Not a single person
is allowed to drop out.

103
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:07,747
How many are we in total?

104
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:09,649
Two, three, four, five…

105
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:10,850
It's 18.

106
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,152
So teamwork is important.

107
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,888
What? Can't we let some drop out?

108
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:17,390
Seriously.

109
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:18,524
Just a few.

110
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,360
Since when were we a team?

111
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:22,028
Since when?

112
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,831
I mean, why do we
have to do this as a team?

113
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:27,800
Before we depart,
for the sake of your teamwork,

114
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:30,003
we'll tie your wrists together.

115
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:31,537
-What?
-And you can't

116
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,573
untie it until the mission is over.

117
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:38,011
When you eat, when you go to the restroom…

118
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:40,246
-Wait, even in the restroom?
-That's too much.

119
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:41,981
-Don't look.
-I won't.

120
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:43,049
Turn around.

121
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,717
Put our hands together. One, two, three.

122
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:47,253
Come on, put our hands together.

123
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,454
I hate this.

124
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:50,390
"THERE WILL BE
COUNTLESS SITUATIONS THEY'LL HATE"

125
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,759
You can't untie it from now on.

126
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:54,494
This is terrible, seriously.

127
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,731
All right. We'll depart now.

128
00:04:58,798 --> 00:04:59,799
Start!

129
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,101
We've started?

130
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:03,670
Let's go!

131
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:05,405
"BOTH TEAMS DEPART"

132
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:08,207
But still, the weather's quite cool today.

133
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:09,909
It's cool.

134
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,077
Gosh.

135
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,378
It's cool.

136
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:14,914
-By the looks of it…
-The weather…

137
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,683
…I think they'll make us eat
while walking.

138
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:18,117
Something like energy bars.

139
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:19,385
Well, I don't think so.

140
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:22,488
I think they'll let us eat
whatever we want,

141
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:25,358
but we'll have to think about the time.

142
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:28,728
Wow.

143
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:30,396
I don't think I've walked this path.

144
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:31,798
Is this the right way?

145
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:35,668
Goodness, it feels like
we're walking across the country.

146
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,305
Gosh, we're going to

147
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:42,375
Gwanghwamun on foot from Gimpo?

148
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,646
The distance is almost 25 km.

149
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:48,314
I've never done something like this.

150
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,184
Our hands

151
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,086
-keep touching.
-Right.

152
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:55,154
-I mean, we have to walk over 20 km…
-Yes.

153
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:56,656
…so if our hands keep brushing,

154
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:58,257
I think we'll get blisters.

155
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:01,260
I think we'll feel attached to each other.

156
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:06,632
I can't believe we have to reach
Gwanghwamun like this.

157
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,668
Suddenly, I don't like our hands brushing.

158
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:10,169
Our arms keep brushing.

159
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:11,537
And it's slippery.

160
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:15,241
If I move my arm,
if I bend my wrist like this…

161
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:16,509
-Oh, bugs!
-Gosh!

162
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,044
FRUIT FLY

163
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,345
Stop! Hey, stop it!

164
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:22,415
MAKING A FUSS

165
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:23,983
I hate bugs.

166
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,785
I'm so afraid of bugs.

167
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,720
He's completely "egen."

168
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:31,991
Guys, you must control your pace.
You see the staff behind you?

169
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,094
By the way,

170
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,898
it'd be harder for the staff members
than for us today.

171
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:40,933
You can take your time.

172
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,736
And if anything happens, shout for help.

173
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:45,905
We'll come to your rescue right away.

174
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:50,410
Who'll come to whose rescue?

175
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:52,378
I hate this kind of stuff.

176
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:53,946
You're so easily frightened.

177
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,016
This is so nice.

178
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,818
It's much nicer than I thought.

179
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:01,921
To be honest,
I've always wanted to have the chance

180
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:03,923
-to make small talk with you.
-You have?

181
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,892
But we've never had the chance.

182
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,860
-Because we had to focus on exercising.
-Yes.

183
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:11,164
Doing this outdoors, I really like it.
It's romantic.

184
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,298
-It's nice.
-It is.

185
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,367
I think you two are romantics.

186
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,035
Gosh, I feel so good today.

187
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,970
-This mission's quite therapeutic.
-Right.

188
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:19,038
I feel good.

189
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:22,742
Wow, look at the roses.

190
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:27,013
They remind me
of a few of my flower gifts.

191
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:29,415
-It was when I went on a blind date.
-Okay.

192
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,517
I thought I'd get a flower for a gift.

193
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,854
-So I bought a flower.
-Okay.

194
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,355
I bought a single rose.

195
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:40,259
And I took it out of my inside pocket
and gave it to her.

196
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:43,196
She was so surprised to see a flower
coming out of my inside pocket.

197
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:45,431
She must've thought I was from
"Now See See Me You."

198
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:47,667
-What's "Now See See Me You"?
-What was it?

199
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:49,502
"Now See See Me You"? "Now Me See You"?

200
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:51,804
-It's <i>Now You See Me</i>.
-<i>Now You See Me</i>.

201
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:54,974
-She was like, "What is he, a magician?"
-A magician?

202
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,676
"Is he like Kim Eungyeol?"

203
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,679
-It's "Lee Eungyeol"!
-Right, Lee Eungyeol.

204
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:00,746
"Is he like Lee Eungyeol?"

205
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,448
You get the point.

206
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,383
Hey, how did I get them all wrong?

207
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,820
In general, you're not very good
with nouns or pronouns.

208
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:09,722
Well, I don't think they're what matter.

209
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,123
You remember them in the abstract.

210
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,327
I focus on the meaning
and what I want to convey.

211
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:16,929
-You watched <i>Attack on Titan</i>, right?
-I did.

212
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,631
-What was his name, "Anal"?
-What?

213
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:20,766
What was it? Tell me.

214
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,602
-"Eren"!
-Right, "Eren."

215
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:23,936
"Anal"? Come on.

216
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:29,041
Who would name the protagonist
"Butthole" in a comic?

217
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:30,409
I was just confused.

218
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:32,078
So it's "Egel"?

219
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:33,513
-"Eren"!
-"Eren"!

220
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,314
"DRAINED"

221
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:37,583
How do you think the others are doing?

222
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,485
It's obvious.
I'm sure DinDin would've said

223
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,988
that he's run a marathon
and something like that.

224
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:43,723
I'm sure he bragged about that.

225
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,858
-It's so obvious.
-You're right.

226
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:48,594
Actually, I need to
prepare for a marathon.

227
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,062
"COMPLETELY SPOT ON"

228
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:51,631
-When is it?
-In November.

229
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,900
-And that he's a good runner.
-Right.

230
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:56,536
Oh, I feel good running.

231
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,639
-Let's run until the bridge.
-Okay.

232
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:00,706
Run!

233
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:03,709
You see, the weather today,

234
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:06,345
it's the perfect weather for runners.

235
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:08,948
I'm going to participate in a marathon
in November anyway.

236
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:10,516
"A SPINE-CHILLING PREDICTION"

237
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,351
Some of the staff will get left behind.

238
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:13,419
Right.

239
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:15,121
This is hell.

240
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:16,889
Outrun him.

241
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,558
Move out of the way.

242
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,093
This is not a team.

243
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,062
-Darn it.
-Gosh, it's nice to run.

244
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,898
I think they're going to
get into an argument.

245
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:30,202
If you could become a pizza topping,
what would you want to become?

246
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,907
I would become pineapple
on a Hawaiian pizza.

247
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:36,809
"CHATTY"

248
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:39,545
What kind of pizza topping
I'd want to become?

249
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:41,647
Why would he ask that?

250
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:45,551
He kept talking nonsense,

251
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:48,921
so I did want him to stop talking.

252
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,023
O3OHN'S PREDICTIONS COME TRUE

253
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,259
-Oh, man, it's raining a lot.
-I know, right?

254
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:56,729
Man, even my underwear
will be soaking wet.

255
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:58,097
Gosh, the rain's no joke.

256
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,499
"IT'S SUDDENLY POURING"

257
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:02,401
-This is…
-Producer!

258
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:04,170
There's nowhere to take shelter.

259
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:05,972
-Be careful, guys.
-Be careful.

260
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:07,607
-Careful.
-My gosh.

261
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:09,208
-It's pouring.
-Goodness.

262
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,111
Gosh, we're all getting wet together.

263
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:14,947
-My shoes got wet in an instant.
-I'm soaking wet.

264
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:16,582
My shoes are all wet.

265
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,751
There's nothing we can do but get wet.

266
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:21,020
I put on sunblock today,

267
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:22,622
-but it was pointless.
-Right.

268
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:25,458
With rain like this,
I should've brought swimming goggles.

269
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,461
-By the way, the weather is…
-Yes?

270
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:31,464
It's suddenly pouring.

00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,500
"DINDIN AND JONATHAN
ALSO GET CAUGHT IN A SHOWER"

272
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,569
-But the problem is…
-Yeah?

273
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,571
…if it keeps raining,
our shoes will get wet.

274
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,639
Mine are already wet.

275
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:41,941
If we walk with wet feet,
we'll get blisters.

276
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:45,177
But let's walk as fast as we can for now.

277
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:46,245

00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,649
BOTH TEAMS REACH 5 KM

00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:52,385
-Hey, the sun is shining again.
-Yes, little by little.

281
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:54,253
The sky's getting clear.

282
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,688
We should dry our clothes.

283
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,156
Oh, it's a dragonfly.

00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:00,626
"INSECTS APPEAR AFTER THE RAIN"

00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:03,362
-What?
-What? What is it?

286
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:06,666
All right. Come onto the grass, please.

287
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,068
Guys,

288
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:11,070
you've arrived at the place
for the first mission.

289
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:12,505
"THERE'S A DEDUCTION GAME TODAY?"

290
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:14,607
What did I say
the name of the mission was?

291
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,208
-"No More Failure."
-"No More Failure."

292
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,678
There's no failure in any game today.

293
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:21,247
-What?
-But if you fail,

294
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:23,582
you must wait 10 minutes and try again.

295
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:24,850
THE NO MORE FAILURE SPECIAL

296
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:27,453
<i>You must keep trying until you succeed.</i>

297
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,188
<i>I'll tell you about the first game.</i>

This game
will test your ability to observe.

299
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:33,392
It's called "Bug Hunting."

300
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:39,098
DANIEL WAS PARTICULARLY SCARED OF BUGS

301
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:40,433
My gosh! What is it?

302
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,136
THE PERFECT GAME
TO GET RID OF HIS FEAR OF BUGS

303
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,471
In this game,

304
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:47,773
you must catch

305
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,809
three different bugs with your bare hands.

306
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,610
Okay, I'll catch them. Don't worry.

307
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:53,512
"LOOKING WORRIED SICK"

308
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:56,248
Cicadas, which are insects
that we can only see in the summer,

309
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:58,250
must be caught under all circumstances.

310
00:11:58,317 --> 00:11:59,318
They must be alive?

311
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,386
They must be alive.

312
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:01,921
They must be alive?

313
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:05,391
Man, we have to catch bugs?

314
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:07,326
We should comb through all the trees.

315
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,262
First, ants.

316
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:11,530
And some other kind.

317
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:12,798
Let's catch a cicada first.

318
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:14,366
-A cicada?
-I know how to catch them.

319
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:16,335
-If you go, I have to go too.
-Yeah.

320
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:18,871
Bug hunting? I can't believe it.

321
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,006
"SHAKING OFF"

322
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,609
It's not easy
since we have to move together.

323
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:25,244
-You're scared of…
-You take the lead.

324
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:26,779
Since you're scared of cicadas.

325
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:28,047
No, I'm okay.

326
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,215
I'm not scared.

327
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:30,716
Damn it.

328
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:33,052
-I'm so scared.
-Nothing's there.

329
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,520
-There is.
-Where?

330
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,988
I'm scared of spiderwebs.

331
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:39,792
What if a spider crawls up my arm
and gets into my ear?

332
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,427
Is a cicada--

333
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:45,030
What? What is it?

334
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,832
-Don't do that!
-A spider was on my arm.

335
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,968
I really hate things like this.

336
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,804
"ACTING CUTE?"

337
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:54,640
How come there's not a single cicada?
Is it because of the rain?

338
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,243
BOTH HANDS HOLDING TIGHTLY

339
00:12:57,843 --> 00:12:59,145
ACTING CUTE

340
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:02,681
I saw a lot of long-headed grasshoppers
on the grass earlier.

341
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:05,718
-There are long-headed grasshoppers?
-Oh, no, I'm scared of them.

342
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,186
-Catch it.
-What is it?

343
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:09,488
"THEY FOUND SOMETHING"

344
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:11,090
Okay.

345
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,460
-I caught one, right, producer?
-Let me see. Put it here.

346
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:15,694
It might fly away.

347
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:17,530
"SCARED EVEN NOW"

348
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:18,898
Okay.

349
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,699
-You caught a grasshopper.
-I caught one.

350
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:22,568
-We caught one.
-How do we catch a cicada?

351

You said you know
how to catch a dragonfly, right?

00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:26,672
Yes, I do, but…

353
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:29,375
I can catch bugs with my bare hands.

These punks.

361
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:46,992
They're flying right by us.

362

-Dragonflies…
-I'll catch them like this.

-It's not easy to catch them flying.
-I won't go easy on them.

-Yeah?

393

We should trust them. What can we do?

526
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,202
-We shouldn't.
-We should.

527
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:05,571
-We should trust them.
-We shouldn't. We should doubt.

-I hear you've been working hard.
-Oh, you know.

538
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,429
Words are going around runner communities.

539
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:32,931
There are social media pages
for us runners.

540

-But they're runners.
-Right.

548
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,049
-We can trust runners…
-Right.

549
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:52,618
…since we have something in common.

550

What will you play?

556
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:04,563
I'll play rock.

557
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,698

THANKS TO A CITIZEN WHO MISUNDERSTOOD,

I mean, what do they get
by winning at this?

582
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:03,555
That's why they don't wanna lose.

AT THE SOUND OF A CICADA

587
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:16,234
Hey, that sounds like a cicada.

588
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:18,603
-Sounds similar.
-I thought it was a cicada.

589
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,871
It sounds like a cicada.

590
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:23,141
You're good. It sounds like a cicada.

591
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:24,676
-Man…
-Hey!

592
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:26,878
It's a cicada!

593
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:29,448
-It's alive.
-A dead one doesn't count.

594
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,450
-It's alive.
-I think it'll move.

595
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,185
-It's alive.
-No, it's not.

596
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:34,553

-Asleep.
-It's asleep.

-It's sleeping.
-It's asleep.

599
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:39,991
It's asleep. Don't wake it up.

600
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,761
-I can even hear it snoring.
-It's dead.

601
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:44,963
If you can hear it snoring,
you should see a doctor.

602
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,665
IT'S DRIVING THEM CRAZY

603
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:49,167
-Let's go find another one.
-Let's move on.

604
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:51,069
-There are definitely some cicadas.
-Right.

605
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,537
We should hurry up.

Come here.

609
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:02,481

Wow!

622
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:35,080
He got it!

623
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:36,782
-Are you okay to catch it?
-I'm okay.

624
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:38,784
-Get it to the ground.
-No.

-Do I have to hold it with my hand?
-Are we done?

626
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,454
You have to show us with your hand.

627
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:43,922
-You do it!
-Put it on the ground.

628
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:45,690
Put it on the ground. I'll do it.

-I'm trying to hold its wings.

-Seriously.
-Why didn't you twist it?

650

-Can I twist you?
-No.

651
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:33,271
Sorry.

00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:10,435
People fooled us so many times.

700
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:11,937
They lied about what they'd play.

701
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:13,471
We've been here for an hour and a half.

702
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:15,006
-Thank you!
-Thank you.

703
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,141
Thank you so much.

704
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:18,143
-Have a nice day.
-I wish you happiness.

705
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:20,045
FINALLY, 2 WINS IN A ROW!

706
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:21,880
ONE MORE WIN, AND IT'S A SUCCESS

707
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:24,482
Hello, sir, I'm singer DinDin.

708
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:25,684
I'm Jonathan.

709
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,486
Would you mind
playing rock paper scissors with us?

710
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:29,888
-We now have…
-Yes?

711
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:33,158
…been here for an hour
because we kept losing.

712
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:35,994
We'll finally be able to move on
if we win against you.

713
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:37,329
-Really?
-Yes.

714
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:38,463
What will you play?

715
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:40,031
I'm a man.

716
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,133
-Wow.
-He's a true man.

717
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,836
Since he's a true man, I'll trust him.

718
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:46,137
You can trust me.

719
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:47,739
-We can trust him!
-I will trust you.

720
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,742
I'll trust you, sir. Thank you.

721
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:52,677
-Thank you.
-Since you're a true man!

722
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:54,713
-Rock, paper…
-Rock, paper…

723
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:57,082
-Scissors!
-Scissors!

724
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:59,150
Sir!

725
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:00,552
We can finally go.

726
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,954
Wow, you're a true man.

727
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:05,056
You're a true man! Thank you, sir!

728
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,658
-Thank you.
-Thank you. Have a nice day.

729
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:08,360
-Thank you.
-Thank you. True man!

730
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:10,295
Man! Wow.

731
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:11,496
We made it simple.

732
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:12,998
Since we're men.

733
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:15,767
"TEARING UP"

734
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:17,969
Yes, it's a harsh world,

735
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:19,971
but we carry on with hopes like this.

736
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:21,606
Gosh, seriously,

737
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:24,576
I almost burst into tears
after meeting such a good person.

738
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,411
It's so moving.

739
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:29,981
<i>Korean citizens are more honest</i>
<i>than you'd think.</i>

740
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:33,752
<i>Seriously, I learn about life</i>
<i>through </i>Anchovy Physical Camp<i>.</i>

741
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:36,221
You've won rock paper scissors
three times in a row.

742
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:37,389
You can move on now.

743
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:39,557
-Let's go already.
-I want to walk so badly.
