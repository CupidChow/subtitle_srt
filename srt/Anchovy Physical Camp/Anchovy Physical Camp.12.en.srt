1
00:00:01,044 --> 00:00:02,879
Let's do another round quickly.

2
00:00:03,813 --> 00:00:04,881
It's 50 kilos.

3
00:00:05,515 --> 00:00:07,517
God, I can still smell it.

4
00:00:08,117 --> 00:00:09,352
It's driving me crazy.

5
00:00:10,653 --> 00:00:12,522
GARGLING

6
00:00:15,158 --> 00:00:17,427
SPITTING

7
00:00:17,493 --> 00:00:19,262
COUGHING

8
00:00:19,328 --> 00:00:21,364
Gosh, this is seriously no joke.

9
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:24,567
STRONG SCENT OF STINKY TOFU

10
00:00:24,634 --> 00:00:25,635
I'll eat it.

11
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,639
It's so strong,
it'll stick around until tomorrow.

12
00:00:31,574 --> 00:00:33,209
The smell just won't go away.

13
00:00:35,011 --> 00:00:38,748
Goodness, I can smell stinky tofu
wherever you go.

14
00:00:38,815 --> 00:00:40,450
I can't help it. Oh, gosh.

15
00:00:40,516 --> 00:00:41,818
For God's sake.

16
00:00:41,884 --> 00:00:43,219
"HIS OWN BREATH'S KILLING HIM"

17
00:00:43,286 --> 00:00:44,454
You stink!

18
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,122
What do I do?

19
00:00:46,589 --> 00:00:48,925
-I'll change it to 15.
-15 kilos?

20
00:00:49,392 --> 00:00:51,561
-Oh, doped up with stinky tofu?
-Let's go.

21
00:00:52,028 --> 00:00:53,629
I'll show you what stinky tofu can do.

22
00:00:54,797 --> 00:00:56,899
I'm doped with stinky tofu. Let's go.

23
00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:01,771
Nine. Seventy.

24
00:01:02,538 --> 00:01:04,340
REACHING 1,050 KILOS IN NO TIME

25
00:01:04,407 --> 00:01:06,609
I guess stinky tofu agrees with you.

26
00:01:06,676 --> 00:01:09,178
Wow, stinky tofu sure made you stronger!

27
00:01:09,245 --> 00:01:10,780
Your face looks like stinky tofu too.

28
00:01:10,847 --> 00:01:12,582
STINKY-TOFU FACE

29
00:01:12,648 --> 00:01:15,184
Hey, that's not because of stinky tofu.

30
00:01:15,251 --> 00:01:17,720
I just showed you how tenacious I am.

31
00:01:19,689 --> 00:01:21,757
The stinky tofu really made him stronger.

32
00:01:21,824 --> 00:01:23,626
Wow, he's doing great.

33
00:01:23,693 --> 00:01:26,028
God, do you own this place or what?

34
00:01:26,095 --> 00:01:27,330
-O3ohn.
-Yes?

35
00:01:28,097 --> 00:01:30,500
Let's follow the direction of the sun.

36
00:01:30,566 --> 00:01:31,901
What do you mean?

37
00:01:31,968 --> 00:01:34,637
The one that the sun shines on,
we should help them win.

38
00:01:35,238 --> 00:01:36,239
Who is that?

39
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:37,306
Jonathan.

40
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:40,776
-Okay. Let's go.
-Fifty.

41
00:01:40,843 --> 00:01:43,179
COMPLETED 2,250 KILOS
THANKS TO STINKY TOFU POWER

42
00:01:43,746 --> 00:01:45,915
Let's go. Stinky tofu power, let's go.

43
00:01:45,982 --> 00:01:47,984
Now, I'll tell you your standing.

44
00:01:48,618 --> 00:01:49,619
Fourth place…

45
00:01:49,685 --> 00:01:50,686
Choi Daniel.

46
00:01:50,753 --> 00:01:52,054
-What?
-What? Really?

47
00:01:52,121 --> 00:01:53,122
Third place…

48
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:54,190
O3ohn.

49
00:01:54,257 --> 00:01:55,725
"3RD PLACE
DOPED WITH STINKY TOFU, O3OHN"

50
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:57,360
Second place, DinDin.

51
00:01:57,426 --> 00:01:59,328
"2ND PLACE
LOW WEIGHT, HIGH REPS, DINDIN"

52
00:01:59,395 --> 00:02:00,463
First place, Jonathan.

53
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:01,964
"1ST PLACE
HIGH WEIGHT, LOW REPS, JONATHAN"

54
00:02:02,031 --> 00:02:03,399
-For real?
-For real.

55
00:02:06,402 --> 00:02:08,571
But the gaps are really small.

56
00:02:08,638 --> 00:02:10,373
It was really neck and neck.

57
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:12,108
Just go for it like crazy.

58
00:02:12,175 --> 00:02:13,676
TAKING THE SEAT FIRST

59
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,278
TRYING TO SECURE THE LEAD

60
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:16,412
One.

61
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:18,314
Two. Three.

62
00:02:19,182 --> 00:02:20,483
Four.

63
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,318
Six.

64
00:02:22,385 --> 00:02:23,419
Seven.

65
00:02:23,886 --> 00:02:27,190
Gosh, it'll be no fun
if Jonathan ends up winning the keychain.

66
00:02:27,924 --> 00:02:30,359
We shouldn't let him win it.

67
00:02:30,426 --> 00:02:31,661
Twenty.

68
00:02:31,727 --> 00:02:32,728
Twenty.

69
00:02:32,795 --> 00:02:33,930
You did 20 with 25 kilos.

70
00:02:33,996 --> 00:02:34,897
"IT'S NOT OVER YET"

71
00:02:35,398 --> 00:02:36,499
What? No way.

72
00:02:36,566 --> 00:02:37,567
50 kilos?

73
00:02:37,633 --> 00:02:39,101
Jonathan's trying to secure the win.

74
00:02:39,168 --> 00:02:40,436
It's 50 kilos.

75
00:02:40,503 --> 00:02:41,637
You really might just win.

76
00:02:43,005 --> 00:02:44,006
All right.

77
00:02:44,073 --> 00:02:45,541
Wow, Jonathan.

78
00:02:45,608 --> 00:02:46,709
-Hey!
-That doesn't count.

79
00:02:47,543 --> 00:02:49,045
HIS BODY WENT UP WITH IT

80
00:02:49,111 --> 00:02:50,379
-It doesn't count.
-It doesn't.

81
00:02:50,446 --> 00:02:51,514
-It doesn't.
-Why not?

82
00:02:51,581 --> 00:02:54,083
"MAKING A FUSS RIGHT AWAY"

83
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,751
Hold on! All right.

84
00:02:56,285 --> 00:02:57,987
-I'll do it again.
-Geez.

85
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:01,958
Okay.

86
00:03:02,024 --> 00:03:03,693
They're all so mean.

87
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:05,795
Trying to close the gap with him.

88
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:07,330
They are not like,

89
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:09,632
"Congrats, Jonathan. Keep it up."

90
00:03:10,132 --> 00:03:11,567
They're determined to beat me.

91
00:03:12,368 --> 00:03:14,437
I've been duped.

92
00:03:15,137 --> 00:03:17,206
<i>They want to win more keychains.</i>

93
00:03:17,273 --> 00:03:19,875
I'm sure they're greedier than me.

94
00:03:19,942 --> 00:03:22,745
<i>Seriously, I'm learning about life</i>
<i>through this show.</i>

95
00:03:22,812 --> 00:03:25,147
<i>I must take what's mine.</i>

96
00:03:25,214 --> 00:03:26,482
"NEVER TRUST ANYONE IN LIFE"

97
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:27,650
It's time for the game.

98
00:03:27,717 --> 00:03:29,552
-We're playing the game? Now?
-Okay.

99
00:03:30,052 --> 00:03:31,354
Five tons are on the line.

100
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,256
All right, this game is

101
00:03:33,322 --> 00:03:35,358
-"<i>Jegichagi</i> with Mountain Grandpa."
-What?

102
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:36,759
What's that?

103
00:03:36,826 --> 00:03:38,127
You'll be playing

104
00:03:38,194 --> 00:03:39,829
against an elderly man

105
00:03:39,895 --> 00:03:42,298
from Jangchung Sports Club
with 66 years of experience.

106
00:03:42,365 --> 00:03:44,934
It's a one-on-one <i>jegichagi</i> match.

107
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,171
<i>Only one player will play.</i>

108
00:03:49,238 --> 00:03:52,875
<i>You must achieve more consecutive kicks</i>
<i>than him to get a deduction of five tons.</i>

109
00:03:53,876 --> 00:03:56,045
RIGHT THEN, SOMEONE APPROACHES

110
00:04:00,182 --> 00:04:03,052
LOOKING CHARISMATIC

111
00:04:03,119 --> 00:04:05,721
<i>He looked like he plays it all the time.</i>

112
00:04:05,788 --> 00:04:07,923
<i>I thought it wouldn't be easy.</i>

113
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:13,596
AMONG ELDERLY MEN
WHO LOOKED EXTRAORDINARY

114
00:04:14,563 --> 00:04:19,001
HE WAS SHOWING OFF HIS JEGI SKILLS

115
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:22,338
His name is Hong Dolhui.

116
00:04:22,405 --> 00:04:23,739
-Hong Dolhui?
-Hong Dolhui.

117
00:04:23,806 --> 00:04:25,074
-Hello.
-Hello.

118
00:04:25,141 --> 00:04:26,442
Are you playing barefoot?

119
00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:28,344
Yes, I'm not wearing anything.

120
00:04:28,878 --> 00:04:30,880
"INTUITIVELY KNOWS THAT HE'S GOOD"

121
00:04:30,946 --> 00:04:32,515
<i>Sir, can we start now?</i>

122
00:04:32,581 --> 00:04:33,983
"THE MATCH BEGINS!"

123
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,018
-Go ahead. You go first.
-Shall we go first?

124
00:04:36,085 --> 00:04:37,086
Okay.

125
00:04:37,153 --> 00:04:38,888
-Are you any good?
-Do you know how to play?

126
00:04:38,954 --> 00:04:40,523
I used to be a master at it.

127
00:04:41,123 --> 00:04:42,291
-Should I do it?
-No.

128
00:04:42,358 --> 00:04:44,527
We shouldn't believe him
when he says stuff like this.

129
00:04:44,593 --> 00:04:46,429
Something like the King of <i>ddakji.</i>

130
00:04:47,463 --> 00:04:50,132
I'm great at this, so I know very well.

131
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:51,400
Let's make up for it.

132
00:04:51,901 --> 00:04:53,903
OUT

133
00:04:53,969 --> 00:04:56,305
I was the King of <i>ddakji</i> in Cheonho-dong.

134
00:04:58,507 --> 00:04:59,742
"FAILED BIG TIME"

135
00:04:59,809 --> 00:05:00,976
-Damn it.
-Fail!

136
00:05:01,777 --> 00:05:04,180
-You can do it.
-Okay, I'll do it.

137
00:05:04,246 --> 00:05:05,247
Of course.

138
00:05:06,148 --> 00:05:08,784
-He looks like he could kick 100 times.
-100 times?

139
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:11,220
Oh, my. I'm suddenly so nervous.
Hey, hold my glasses.

140
00:05:12,021 --> 00:05:13,823
"WARY"

141
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:15,825
He's a bit nervous.

142
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:19,829
"EXHALING"

143
00:05:21,731 --> 00:05:23,232
-Here I go.
-Okay.

144
00:05:27,336 --> 00:05:29,071
HE MIGHT BE GOOD FOR REAL?

145
00:05:32,742 --> 00:05:33,743
Five.

146
00:05:34,744 --> 00:05:35,978
-Five.
-It's five.

147
00:05:36,045 --> 00:05:37,546
-It's five.
-It's five.

148
00:05:37,613 --> 00:05:39,949
"COME ON, MAN…"

149
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:42,451
He always says he's a master and then…

150
00:05:42,918 --> 00:05:44,920
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'VE BEEN FOOLED AGAIN

151
00:05:47,056 --> 00:05:49,358
ANCHOVY TEAM SMELLS DEFEAT IN THE AIR

152
00:05:49,925 --> 00:05:52,027
THE JEGI IS HANDED TO THE MASTER

153
00:05:52,628 --> 00:05:55,030
HE'S A BAREFOOT JEGI MASTER

154
00:05:56,132 --> 00:05:59,402
WILL THEY BE ABLE TO BEAT HIM?

155
00:05:59,468 --> 00:06:00,669
All right. Here I go.

156
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:02,238
-Here you go!
-Here you go!

157
00:06:13,983 --> 00:06:16,786
MOVING LIGHTLY AS IF HE FORGOT HIS AGE

158
00:06:31,867 --> 00:06:33,402
-Four.
-Four?

159
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,471
-Four.
-Four?

160
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:36,972
All right.

161
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,107
FLUSTERED

162
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:43,279
We won.

163
00:06:44,146 --> 00:06:45,147
We just won.

164
00:06:45,648 --> 00:06:48,117
HOLDING THE LAUGH IN
AFTER BEATING THE ELDERLY MAN

165
00:06:48,184 --> 00:06:49,718
It's not like I can shout for joy.

166
00:06:50,252 --> 00:06:52,154
I used to do 200 to 300 kicks.

167
00:06:52,221 --> 00:06:53,322
Sometimes, 500.

168

You won.

00:07:00,496 --> 00:07:02,998
I just thought it'd be fun
to play with you young guys.

00:07:03,065 --> 00:07:04,633
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you.

173
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:08,237
You're all young enough
to be my grandsons.

-Right.

-Let's go, hammer.
-You got this.

-It is.

-Darn it. It wasn't good.

I think he's better at this

389

I told DinDin that it was my turn,

I WILL TRY AND OVERCOME THEM!

541
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:26,895
Eight. Don't stop. Nine.

A hundred.

Two hundred.

545
00:21:33,802 --> 00:21:35,870
He does three tons easily now.

546
00:21:35,937 --> 00:21:37,138
Wow.

00:21:37,806 --> 00:21:40,241
Nine. Three hundred.

548
00:21:40,308 --> 00:21:43,545

-You're really crazy.
-I'll ring the bell right away.

Jonathan normally wouldn't say that,

588
