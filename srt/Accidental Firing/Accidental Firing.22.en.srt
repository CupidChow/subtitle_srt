00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,759

(and even the small gestures.)

101
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:21,839
(To prevent being found out
by those close to him,)

102
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:25,240
(you even killed my entire family.)

103
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,439
You don't deserve what my dad has.

104
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:33,199

106
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,519
You lusted after your stepmother.

107
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:38,240

That's right.

112
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,079
I did promise Changhe to help him.

113

But you are Dong Lin.

114
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,519

115
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,319

116
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,639

here in this place.

121
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,079
Today I will judge you
in the same place.

122
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:33,160
Have you been poor?

123
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:38,360
I have. Even my wife ran away.

124
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,879
Because I'm poor, I deserve to die?

125
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,839

126

159
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,679
you can do or say

160
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,159
whatever you want.

161
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:22,519

00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,200
I just want to be with you.

163
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,159
In these ten years,

164
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,559
I've been living in Dong Lin's shadow.

165
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,480
Until I met you again,

166
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,519
I didn't realize

167
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,320

who mattered most.

170
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,080
Now, I don't want to lose you.

For the past ten years,

175
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:23,679
I thought

176
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:26,039
the only thing left in my life

177
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:28,080
was revenge.

178
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:29,879
But now...

179
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,879
