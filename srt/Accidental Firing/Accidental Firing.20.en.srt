00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:13,563
=Episode 20=

3
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:15,199
Master,

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,000
we've looked everywhere to find

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,559
where Dong Lin hid the evidence.

6
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:20,760
We found nothing.

7
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:22,239
If we continue,

8
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:24,000
it will alert the Haicheng military.

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,039
Let's change

10
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,079
and strike accurately.

11
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:27,839
Back then, Dong Lin knew

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,399
I wouldn't target the ancestral hall,

13
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:31,320
so he hid the evidence there.

14
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,960
Would he choose the new hiding place

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,520
based on the same logic?

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,560
A place where you wouldn't take action.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,679
A place where you couldn't take action.

18
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,479
Or a place you wouldn't go at all.

19
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,079
I'm on it right away.

20
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,159
And Liang Xiao?

21
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:55,479
Wasn't he with you?

22
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,159
He left halfway.

23
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:59,079
He wouldn't go anywhere else
but the mansion

24
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,240
to see Miss Mu.

25
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:03,679
He's here.

26
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:08,799
Mu Lan.

27
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:10,640
What did you do to her?

28
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,519
You promised me

29
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,879
you'd never leave her side.

30
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:14,280
And what now?

31
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,680
You didn't do it.

32
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,040
Then I'll do it.

33
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:18,920
Liang Xiao,

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,000
don't challenge my bottom line.

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,879
Lu Yan,

36
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,560
you've already crossed my bottom line.

37
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,040
Protect her well.

38
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:45,599
Never leave her side.

39
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,680
Xiao.

40
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:52,439
Are you okay?

41
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,359
What happened to me?

42
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,359
Xiao has become
more and more presumptuous.

43
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,560
I didn't expect

44
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:05,799
that he knocked you out

45
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,079
to take you away.

46
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,000
However, Liang Xiao brought you out.

47
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,039
I'm actually

48
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:14,919
quite thankful to him.

49
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:17,439
Mu Lan,

50
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,639
I might know

51
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,879
where Dong Lin moved the evidence to.

52
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:23,680
Where is it?

53
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,400
Xincheng Villa.

54
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,039
Wasn't that
your maternal grandfather's property?

55
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,039
Dong Lin swindled it away before

56
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:35,360
and then donated it.

57
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,520
Nominally he donated it.

58
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:37,879
But in reality,

59
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,520
Dong Lin is still controlling it.

60
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:41,439
It's his means of seeking reputation.

61
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,919
Why would the crime evidence be there?

62
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,960
Ten years ago,

63
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,360
after Dong Lin committed the massacre,

64
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,719
I ran to my maternal grandpa.

65
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,120
Dong Lin chased after me.

66
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,560
I wanted to expose him.

67
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,400
I didn't expect

68
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,479
that not only did he avoid it easily,

69
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,879
but also made my grandpa

70
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,879
think I had a problem with my mind.

71
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,800
To me, Xincheng Villa

72
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,960
is a place I can't look back at.

73
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:17,639
I never wanted to return.

74
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,759
Maybe he took advantage of that

75
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,000
to transfer the evidence there.

76
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:24,840
Are you sure?

77
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:26,976
- Well...
- Young Master.

78
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,439
I just went to Xincheng Villa.

79
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,360
Many people have been placed there,

80
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,479
inside and outside,

81
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:33,439
including his own men

82
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,000
and the Ling family's people.

83
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,000
My guess is probably right.

84
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,240
But this is Haicheng.

85
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,039
As Yuncheng Governor,

86
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,639
you shouldn't go there rashly.

87
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,280
Or it may cause hostility
from Haicheng military.

88
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:52,039
Miss Mu, don't worry.

89
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,199
Before coming,

90
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:54,840
my master had spent a lot of time

91
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,719
secretly connecting
with Haicheng military.

92
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,639
They will turn a blind eye.

93
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:01,560
That's good.

94
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,039
I'll go see Haicheng Governor again

95
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:05,840
to reassure him.

96
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,879
Be careful.

97
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,920
Xiao, what's wrong?

98
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:41,439
Sister,

99
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:43,879
in this life and the next,

100
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:46,240
I want to be with you forever and ever.

101
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,000
Xiao.

102
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,480
But I can't.

103
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:54,000
I can only be with you this way.

104
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,040
Son!

105
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:48,360
Brother, what's wrong?

106
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,319
I dreamt of my woman.

107
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:54,519
I was poor at that time.

108
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:57,040
She ran away, and I didn't care.

109
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:59,399
She seemed to be pregnant back then.

110
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:00,600
Do you think

111
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,720
she was pregnant with a boy?

112
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,399
Brother,

113
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,759
can you recall any other clues?

114
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,160
We can look for her.

115
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:16,560
Wang Xinghua.

116
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:19,439
I only remember her name.

117
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,160
Wang Xinghua?

118
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,600
I already know my place in your heart.

119
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:50,639
So it doesn't matter.

120
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,600
But Xiao is too impulsive.

121
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,720
I'm a bit worried about him.

122
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:02,199
He is an adult,

123
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:03,680
and he is skilled.

124
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:05,199
Don't overthink.

125
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,040
Or I will have to worry about you again.

126
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,680
How did your talk with Governor go?

127
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,680
I made it.

128
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,720
What did you promise him in return?

129
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:19,680
After this matter is settled,

130
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:20,839
I'll help him fight

131
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,079
to take down his arch-enemy.

132
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:27,000
Young Master,

133
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,720
a man sent this over.

134
00:07:30,995 --> 00:07:33,399
(Xincheng Villa)

135
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,399
Xincheng Villa.

136
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,439
How does that man look?

137
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:40,639
Didn't see his face.

138
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,040
But he seemed to be one-armed.

139
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,160
(Could it be Ding Pei?)

140
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:48,639
Could it be the messenger

141
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,160
also found something at Xincheng Villa?

142
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,519
Hello?

143
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,600
Xiao,

144
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:09,480
is that you?

145
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,240
Sister,

146
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,879
you said

147
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:14,839
he'd never

148
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:16,560
be with us after our revenge is taken.

149
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:17,879
After our revenge is taken,

150
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,920
will he still be with us?

151
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,720
Of course not.

152
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:23,680
What will you do?

153
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,120
To find Dong Lin and avenge you.

154
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,480
I've told you many times.

155
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:28,879
This is Haicheng.

156
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,879
It's been managed
by Dong Lin for ten years.

157
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,399
He's a vicious man with many minions.

158
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,639
If you go, you'll die.

159
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:35,440
I know.

160
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,840
Even if I die, I'll drag him along.

161
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,679
Xiao!

162
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,159
If you dare to go,

163
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,559
I will hate you forever.

164
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:45,759
Forever?

165
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,759
Making you remember me forever

166
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:50,120
is worth it.

167
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:50,840
Xiao?

168
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,120
Xiao!

169
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:07,360
What's wrong?

170
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,159
Xiao is risking his life
to kill Dong Lin.

171
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,159
I have to stop him.

172
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,080
Mu Lan, calm down.

173
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,080
Listen to me.

174
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,000
Stay at home.

175
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,960
I will find Xiao.

176
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:19,840
Everything about Dong Lin will be over.

177
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:21,399
Calm down.

178
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,399
Be good.

179
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:23,399
