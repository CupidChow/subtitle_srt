00:00:10,945 --> 00:00:13,467
=Episode 18=

3
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,600
Look at this.

4
00:00:29,715 --> 00:00:34,159
(Household Registration Application
Dong Lin)

5
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:34,840
Dong Lin?

6
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:37,560
I found it.

7
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,280
However,

8
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:42,520
things did not go as I expected.

9
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:44,159
Instead, he took the chance

10
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,399
to slander you and me

11
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:46,920
and the Lu family.

12
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,280
The urgent task now is
to open the secret room.

13
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:54,200
But we've lost the chance
to approach him.

14
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:05,719
Ten years, we waited.

15
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:08,079
Don't rush

16
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,239
and be upset.

17
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:10,840
Mu Lan.

18
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:13,560
I will make him pay with blood.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,799
Well...

20
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,079
What?

21
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,040
The necklace I gave you.

22
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:36,480
You...

23
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:38,719
I...

24
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:42,519
I will wear it.

25
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:56,920
(From Lu Changhe)

26
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,359
(to Lu Yan,)

27
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,159
(the Lu family is skilled in glib talk.)

28
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,879
(She must've been deceived)

29
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:04,239
(to say such things.)

30
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:06,400
(If I leave,)

31
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,319
(Lu Yan's scheme will succeed.)

32
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:12,919
(But I can't just go back.)

33
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,199
(I'll find a way)

34
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:16,000
(to let her trust me and leave with me.)

35
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,719
The Lu ancestral hall.

36
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:22,120
A secret room.

37
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,599
Mechanism.

38
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,120
Are you going to see Dong Lin?

39
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:38,719
I will figure it out myself.

40
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,240
Don't worry.

41
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:51,400
Xiao?

42
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:53,199
Sister.

43
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,080
If I can open the secret room,

44
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,199
will you leave here with me?

45
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:58,120
Xiao.

46
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,560
I have made myself very clear.

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,919
No matter what happens,

48
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:04,400
we can only be siblings.

49
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:05,400
Alright.

50
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:06,960
Siblings.

51
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:08,759
You can't drive me away.

52
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,240
But you are not welcome here.

53
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,919
Please leave, Mr. Liang.

54
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:19,280
Dong Lin's pocket watch?

55
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,240
Dong Lin?

56
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:22,800
So his name is Dong Lin.

57
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:25,400
When he and Li Tian ambushed me,

58
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,599
I accidentally touched the watch chain.

59
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,639
He was very nervous.

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,560
It doesn't look like precious.

61
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:37,800
He must be hiding something.

62
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,560
How did he get it?

63
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:43,360
He followed Dong Lin and snatched it.

64
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,919
Are you so sure?

65
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,159
Then go give it a try.

66
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,840
Alright.

67
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:27,319
Brother.

68
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,000
Didn't you see who hit you?

69
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,160
Whoever it was,

70
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:32,399
he's done for.

71
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,399
What?

72
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:39,600
What happened?

73
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:43,879
Brother.

74
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,279
Lu Yan opened the secret room.

75
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,040
The stuff...

76
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,199
I moved it long ago.

77
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,959
Knowing how scheming they are,

78
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:58,279
how could I just sit and wait?

79
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,560
Sister.

80
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:27,279
He's been lying,

81
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,839
dragging you out,

82
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:31,240
getting you to let go of the evidence,

83
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,720
making you trust him and follow him.

84
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:33,480
But...

85
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,160
Xiao.

86
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:36,240
Lu Yan's parents were killed by him.

87
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,759
That's an undeniable fact.

88
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:38,759
Fact?

89
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,120
Lu Changhe killed your mother.

90
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,959
And he is the son of your enemy.

91
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:44,759
That is the fact.

92
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:45,920
Sister.

93
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:46,959
Let's go.

94
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,519
I trust him.

95
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:06,319
(When did he transfer)

96
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:08,839
(the evidence out?)

97
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,040
(And to where?)

98
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,040
(Ten years.)

99
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,439
(Ten years.)

100
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:17,319
(Is this the outcome?)

101
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,319
(Lu Yan.)

102
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,199
(What are you doing?)

103
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,680
(Why didn't you notice it?)

104
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:25,759
(Why?)

105
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,720
(Why! Why! Why!)

106
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:29,120
Lu Yan.

107
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,600
Don't be like this.

108
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,399
Sorry.

109
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:36,399
I've let you down.

110
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:41,399
Does it hurt?

111
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,399
No.

112
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:44,959
I'm fine.

113
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,639
But my heart aches.

114
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:52,360
On what grounds?

115
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:54,839
As a friend?

116
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,120
A passerby?

117
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,199
Or...

118
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:00,319
The ten-year promise.

119
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:04,439
The one with the ten-year promise.

120
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,360
I ache for you in her name.

121
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:10,759
If it's still here ten years later,

122
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:11,759
I will marry you.

123
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:13,959
Lu Yan.

124
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,480
I am indeed not as brave as you,

125
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,040
nor as frank as you.

126
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,720
I'm even

127
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,079
a little clumsy.

128
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,839
If I do something wrong,

129
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,240
you can tell me.

130
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,680
Because

131
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,879
I like you.

132
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:38,839

(What does he want?)

146
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,360
What's up?

147

Everyone in Haicheng knows it.

149
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:11,080
Yan made it even more popular
a few days ago.

150
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,960
So?

151
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,840
The wedding dress should be done.

152
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,440
I want you to try it on.

153
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:18,960
(What trick does he want to play now?)

154
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:20,440
Alright.

155
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:22,039
The day after tomorrow at 2 PM.

156
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,840
Let's go to Dafu Tailor Shop together.

157
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:26,600
Of course.

158
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,240
Cooperate with me?

159
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,440
Isn't this your proposal?

160
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:42,200
On what?

161
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,519
Kill your fake dad, obviously.

162
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:46,879
Lu Yan.

163
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,559
I owe you a favor.

164
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:50,519
Name it, whatever it is.

165
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:53,480
(After the revenge,)

166
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,120
(you must get away from my sister.)

167
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,960
What are you doing?

168
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:02,399
Nothing.

169
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:04,759
Why did you come down?

170
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:08,120
I have something to tell you.

171
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,840
No way.

172
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:11,639
His voice

173
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:13,159
sounds very different from usual.

174
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,919
He must've been provoked.

175
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,720
But whatever he wants to do,

176
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:18,000
I can act accordingly.

177
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,039
- No way.
- No way.

178
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:24,480
I'm just here to inform you.

179
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,799
Not to seek your opinion.

180
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,240
If you agree,

181
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,600
follow my arrangement.

182
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:29,559
If you don't agree,

183
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:31,440
I won't say it.

184
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:32,240
I'm listening.

185
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,759
Traitor.

186
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,360
This is the perfect chance

187
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:38,360
to get close and gather evidence.

188
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,159
I will act accordingly.

189
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:42,879
