=Episode 14=

3
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:19,000
Xiao!

4
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:20,719
Xiao.

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,120
Sister, hurry and leave.

6
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:37,399
Mu Lan,

7
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,679
going against Mr. Lu

8
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,320
will only bring you death.

9
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,679
What do you want?

10
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,439
Since you came, Lu Yan will come too.

11
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,640
By then,

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,600
this place will be you three's grave.

13
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,680
Don't touch my sister.

14
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:43,239
Do you think Lu Yan still dares to come?

15
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,480
We have so many people.

16
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:46,599
With numerous guts...

17
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,479
Mr. Lu.

18
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:53,919
Let's go.

19
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:23,080
Mr. Lu, we've arrived.

20
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:24,879
It's okay. I got you.

21
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,800
It's okay.

22
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,400
Just some scrapes.

23
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,719
I'll apply medicine.

24
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:36,800
You'll be fine soon.

25
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,240
Getting rid of them all?

26
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,199
The two of us almost died.

27
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,039
Lu Changhe.

28
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,159
Mr. Lu?

29
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,680
Mr. Lu? Mr. Lu?

30
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,879
Mr. Lu?

31
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:09,680
Calm down.

32
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,800
Calm down.

33
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:11,800
Come on.

34
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,360
Mr. Lu.

35
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,240
Come on.

36
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,039
Mr. Lu.

37
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:15,639
Changhe.

38
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:16,360
Mr. Lu.

39
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:17,199
Don't come over.

40
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:17,959
Dong Lin!

41
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,480
Look at me.

42
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,759
Just look at me.

43
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,720
Mr. Lu.

44
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,879
The Lu Changhe is already dead.

45
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,160
You are Mr. Lu now.

46
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,639
Don't scare yourself anymore, okay?

47
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,199
No one is here.

48
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:42,079
Give me the gun.

49
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,439
Mr. Lu.

50
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:46,959
Mr. Lu.

51
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:15,560
Mu Lan,

52
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,480
if you approached me
for glory and wealth,

53
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:25,439
and if your body and heart
both belonged to me,

54
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,240
how wonderful that would be.

55
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:23,439
Mr. Lu,

56
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,600
about that night...

57
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,040
Whenever someone mentions that night,

58
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:28,920
no matter who they are,

59
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,560
they must be killed.

60
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:31,519
Got it.

61
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,399
Mu Lan, I found something.

62
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,439
He is Dong Lin.

63
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,120
You...

64
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:57,000
Are you okay?

65
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,040
I'm fine.

66
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:01,399
I have to boil medicine for him.

67
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Let go of me.

68
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,439
I'll watch Liang Xiao.

69
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,279
Now you need to rest properly.

70
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,680
I don't want to.

71
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,800
But you haven't slept for 48 hours.

72
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,360
If you continue, you won't last.

73
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:28,920
I will wake you up

74
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:30,680
in an hour.

75
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:31,759
I promise.

76
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,480
If Xiao wakes up,

77
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:36,800
call me immediately.

78
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:39,360
