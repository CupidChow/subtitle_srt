00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,519
Sorry.

00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:49,756
♪Until one day I met you♪

♪I remember your dawn-like smile♪

♪That ended my long night♪

8
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,840
It's better now.

9
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:13,920
Mr. Lu,

10
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:16,000
Lu Yan went to Miss Mu's room
in the morning.

11
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,680
I wonder what they plotted.

12
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,560
The dinner party

13
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,159
and the ambush.

14
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,959
Both failed.

15
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,159
And they are getting closer.

16
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,959
What about Zhao Debiao?

17
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,840
Like usual, sometimes

18
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,640
he goes to see you.

19
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:47,599
I guess he wants to find out

20
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,519
when Lu Yan will take over the company.

21
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,799
Useless!

22
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,239
Mr. Lu?

23
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,719
I made bird's nest for you, Mr. Lu.

24
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,919
Why are you here?

25
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:17,319
That man spends most of his time here.

26
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,560
There must be something important here.

27
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:20,199
No.

28
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:25,479
Come with me.

29
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,280
(Mu Lan has been here.)

30
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,159
(Wait.)

31
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,479
(If she were alone,)

32
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,560
(she wouldn't hide like this.)

33
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,759
(Lu Yan is also here.)

34
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:19,480
Quite a strength.

35
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,560
It hurts.

36
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,639
Stop playing fragile.

37
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,360
It was in vain.

38
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:31,480
Yeah.

39
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,600
He saw the bird's nest on the table.

40
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,319
But he didn't react at all.

41
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,160
That means

42
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:43,759
he knows it was you and me who broke in.

43
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,399
Just now, did you

44
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,720
want to ask me something?

45
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,720
Yes.

46
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:58,600
Why do you know
there is nothing unusual here?

47
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:00,120
Not just his study room,

48
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,079
I have checked the whole Lu's mansion.

49
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,000
It's as clean as a blank page.

50
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,120
What about Anhe?

51
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,519
I doubt there'll be anything.

52
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,399
If you want to find out,

53
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,279
I can lend a hand.

54
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:29,000
Forget it.

55
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:32,720
Want some?

56
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,120
Sure.

57
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,000
Mr. Lu, what's the matter?

58
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,759
I didn't want to change.

59
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,399
But I'm getting old.

60
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,399
I can't wait any longer.

61
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,000
Miss Mu,

62
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,160
our wedding date was set
at the end of next year.

63
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:19,759
I've decided to move it

64
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,959
up to the end of this year.

65
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,399
(To use the wedding to kill Lu Yan?)

66
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:26,839
(How could I let you do that?)

67
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,000
(I won't allow you to tarnish)

68
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:31,000
(the girl I hold dear even a bit.)

69
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,319
(But the name of the wedding
is a good opportunity)

70
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,759
(to approach him)

71
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,680
(and look into the hidden room.)

72
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,040
Okay.

73
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,480
But that's in 15 days.

74
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,879
Time is tight.

75
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:43,839
Mr. Lu,

76
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,360
we need to quickly prepare
for the wedding.

77
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,079
(What tricks is this woman
trying to play again?)

78
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,120
Okay.

79
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,000
Let's talk again.

80
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,519
(Where is the hidden room)

81
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,360
(in the ancestral hall?)

82
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:21,040
(Day moved to December 31st.)
What did that wretch do?

83
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,079
She managed to persuade the chairman
to move up the wedding date.

84
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,120
(Mu Lan and Lu Yan
are old acquaintances.)

85
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,480
Liang Xiao?

86
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:26,120
What are you doing in Mr. Lu's office?

87
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,560
Delivering files.

88
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:29,600
I deliver all the files to Mr. Lu.

89
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:32,039
I got lost.

90
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:50,679
Hello?

91
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,360
Sister,

92
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:52,559
I received news.

93
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,496
Lu Changhe is moving up the wedding.

94
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:55,840
That's right.

95
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,440
But it's okay, I...

96
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,799
I don't think it's okay.

97
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,039
Xiao,

98
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,600
wait for me in the back alley.

99
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:05,720
We need to talk.

100
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:06,320
Okay.

101
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,559
Sister.

102
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,240
Leave Anhe as soon as possible.

103
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,960
There isn't the thing we want here.

104
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,960
Who said that?

105
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,399
Lu Yan already checked.

106
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:25,039
How can we trust Lu Yan's words?

107
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,000
His father killed your mother.

108
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,840
He is not.

109
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,080
Xiao,

110
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:31,360
there are

111
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,720
many unexpected things.

112
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,399
But Lu Yan
has locked down enough evidence.

113
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,639
Find a suitable reason

114
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,960
to leave Anhe soon.

115
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:40,919
Okay.

116
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,360
From now on,
you mustn't act impulsively.

117
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,639
Make sure to protect yourself.

118
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,600
Understand?

119
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:46,840
Okay.

120
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,679
I got it, Sister.

121
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,039
Go back quickly.

122
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,320
You were.

123
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:05,799
(Lu Yan,)

124
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:08,159
