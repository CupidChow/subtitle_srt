=Accidental Firing=

2
00:00:10,881 --> 00:00:13,403
=Episode 15=

3
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:24,280
You want to see me?

4
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,440
Spread this out.

5
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,199
(Residential registration: Dong Lin)

6
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:29,760
Young Master,

7
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,120
will this alert him?

8
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,759
Moreover, Dong Lin
will surely suppress the matter.

9
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:36,719
If he suppresses it,
just add more fuel to the fire.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,399
Before he confesses,

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,719
I won't let him
have a single peaceful day.

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,439
Okay.

13
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,320
What?

14
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:49,000
Young Master,

15
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,520
why don't you come with me?

16
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:52,039
Anyway, you're uncomfortable

17
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,280
here, right?

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:53,880
Let's go.

19
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,079
Stand at ease. Attention.

20
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:56,119
Turn left.

21
00:00:56,439 --> 00:00:57,240
March forward.

22
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:09,879
What?

23
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:10,959
Let me do it.

24
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:12,599
No need.

25
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:14,959
Let me do it.

26
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,000
I know what to do by observing you.

27
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,640
Take the medicine in two hours.

28
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:19,840
I got it.

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,879
You go take a rest.

30
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,319
Well, thank you.

31
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,199
(Stay with me tonight.)

32
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,319
(Changhe, after all these years,)

33
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,280
(you finally agreed
to let me be with you.)

34
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,319
Miss Ling?

35
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:18,800
Yes, it's me.

36
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,360
What's wrong, Changhe?

37
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,360
I'm tired. I'm going to sleep.

38
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,680
You should leave.

39
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,240
Changhe?

40
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:29,599
Changhe?

41
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,120
Changhe hugged me.

42
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,759
He must have started liking me.

43
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:51,879
Mu Lan.

44
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,000
Mr. Lu.

45
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:05,919
Have a child with me.

46
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,040
It's the fifth day.

47
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,360
Why hasn't he woken up?

48
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,000
Could it be that he won't wake up?

49
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:48,639
The doctor didn't say that.

50
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,160
Xiao.

51
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:51,639
Xiao.

52
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,519
Wake up, Xiao.

53
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:55,480
Xiao.

54
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:58,639
Mu Lan.

55
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,199
Wake up.

56
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:01,800
Xiao.

57
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,759
Mu Lan.

58
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:06,839
Nothing.

59
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,839
Do you want breakfast?

60
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,759
I don't have an appetite.

61
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,720
Thank you.

62
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,079
Xiao.

63
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:55,120
It hurts.

64
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:57,480
What's wrong?

65
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,360
It hurts.

66
00:05:58,839 --> 00:05:59,519
Where?

67
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,360
There's no bleeding.

68
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,560
It hurts inside.

69
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,759
How can that be?

70
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,560
Could it be an infection?

71
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,600
Right, it's an infection.

72
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,759
Right for what?

73
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,959
An infection is bad.

74
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,040
Let's go.

75
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,399
To the hospital.

76
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,879
No, I won't go.

77
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,480
Why?

78
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:33,360
I...

79
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:35,600
am afraid.

80
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,480
Afraid?

81
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:37,439
Of what?

82
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,079
Of...

83
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,839
the hospital.

84
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:43,040
What?

85
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:44,720
Take a look.

86
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:46,560
Am I infected or not?

87
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:52,800
It hurts.

88
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:53,959
It does?

89
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,600
How about this?

90
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:00,000
It hurts like this too.

91
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,680
Well...

92
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:28,560
I... Well...

93
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,680
D-Don't do that.

94
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,439
Pretending to be sick didn't work.

95
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,360
Young Master,

96
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,199
we spread Dong Lin's information out.

97
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,120
It won't be long

98
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:49,560
before the suspicion
of real and fake Mr. Lu blows up.

99
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,439
At that time,
spread Liang Xiao's assault

100
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,480
and Mr. Ding's ambush

101
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:56,480
as well.

102
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,360
Okay.

103
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,360
Young Master,

104
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,800
what are you doing?

105
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:06,319
I'm relaxing.

106
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,920
He's really relaxed.

107
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:27,800
Sister.

108
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,040
Xiao.

109
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:30,079
Sister.

110
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:32,399
Sister.

111
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,759
Sorry. It's my fault
for dragging you into this.

112
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,600
- Sister.
- Okay.

113
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:36,519
It's okay.

114
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:37,639
It's all over.

115
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,279
