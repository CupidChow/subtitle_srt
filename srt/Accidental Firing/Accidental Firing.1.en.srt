00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:37,520
Miss Mu.

5
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,320
No,

00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,159
Mrs. Lu.

7
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:47,119
Ladies and gentlemen,

now is the auspicious time.

Let's welcome the bride and groom.

10
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,119
First, bow to heaven and earth.

11
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:56,159
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

12
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,359
Second, bow to parents.

13
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,040
Bow to each other.

14
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:27,840
Lu Yan,

15
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,280
you shouldn't be here.

16
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:29,879
Leave.

17
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,439
Why did he

18
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,920
shoot at his father's wedding?

19
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,680
Are you crazy?

20
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,000
This is your father's wedding.

21
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,680
I'm here to attend my father's wedding.

22
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,519
Lu Yan, are you crazy?

23
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,039
This is outrageous.

24
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:18,560
What a scoundrel!

25
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,000
The rumors are true.

26
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,120
You traitorous son!

27
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,680
Master, watch out!

28
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,199
Lu Yan,

29
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,159
you are too presumptuous.

30
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:35,360
You're doing something

31
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,159
so outrageous
at your own father's wedding.

32
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,800
I can no longer tolerate you.

33
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,000
Someone!

34
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,120
Rest assured.

35
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,360
How dare you!

36
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,520
Get him!

37
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,199
Is this the place for you?

38
00:03:18,516 --> 00:03:21,817
(Three months ago)

39
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,680
They're fighting again.

40
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,680
Warlords fighting for territory

41
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,960
won't care about the civilians.

Haicheng is also not peaceful.

44
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,520
Many people died
in the workers' movement recently.

45
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,159
Right.

protected many workers and students.

50
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,879
The chances are rare.

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,560
It's not easy to get into Anhe.

52
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:12,960
What's going on?

53
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:14,479
Fire! It's on fire!

54
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,319
It's because you smoked.

55
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:17,839
How could you smoke on the train?

56
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,600
It wasn't me. It wasn't me.

57
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,879
It wasn't me. It really wasn't me.

58
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,399
I didn't smoke.

59
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:24,839
I don't know what happened either.

60
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:27,279
How dangerous it is.

61
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,519
I didn't smoke.

62
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,439
Believe me. I didn't smoke.

63
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,399
It wasn't me.

I really don't know.

65
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,120
I really don't know.

66
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,519
That's too much.

67
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:45,800
That's too much.

68
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,680
Hand it over.

69
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:53,120
What?

70
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,279
Don't think you can get away
by creating a diversion.

71
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,720
The envelope. Hand it over.

72
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:02,759
I don't know what you're saying.

73
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,639
Stop it.

74
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,879
I saw everything just now.

75
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,000
Fine.

76
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,279
What's this?

77
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:18,720
Since you believe I did it,

78
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:20,199
I might as well strip for you

79
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:21,920
to see if I have what you want.

80
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,160
Look. Look closely.

81
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:49,160
Shameless.

82
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,120
Someone's dead!

83
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,920
How did he suddenly die?

84
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,839
I don't know.

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,040
He was fine just now.

86
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:19,000
Follow her.

87
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,639
Yes.

88

(Haicheng Station)
Mr. Lu,

89
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,680
I heard

90
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,639
you're giving Anhe
to your son completely.

91
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,439
Is it true?

92
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:26,839
Right.

93
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:27,800
It's in the newspaper.

94
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,959
How could it be fake?

95
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:31,279
I haven't seen my son in ten years.

96
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:32,720
Over the years,

97
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,639
I haven't fulfilled

98
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,079
my responsibilities as a father.

99
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,000
I feel very guilty inside.

100
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:39,680
So I've decided

101
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,680
to give all that I've accumulated

102
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,079
to him.

103
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,319
Then, Mr. Lu,

104
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,199
when do you plan

105
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,319
to hand Anhe to your son?

106
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:46,920
Yan.

107
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,519
Yan, you're back.

108
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:28,480
You're willing to give Anhe to me.

109
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:30,639
If I weren't back,

110
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,639
I'd be really ungrateful.

111
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,560
Alright.

112
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,079
Then let's go home first.

113
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,560
Tonight, I will throw a party

114
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,720
to welcome my son.

115
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,480
Mr. Lu, we have a few more questions.

116
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,319
- Let's go.
- Mr. Lu.

117
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:50,920
Wait.

118
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,600
Please answer.

119
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,600
Please answer them.

Yes?

Young Master, our man is missing.

130
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,679
We lost track of that woman.

131

134
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:06,159
We lost it.

What?

136
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,720
The young master and the informant
were on the same train.

137
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,879
Could it be...

138
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,720
It's safer in his hands.

139
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,120

than it falling to someone else.
