00:00:10,784 --> 00:00:13,306
=Episode 4=

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,640
Accident?

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,839
That accident

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,640
said you are very dangerous.

6
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:22,800
(He wants me to kill Lu Yan.)

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,000
(There must be a grudge between them.)

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,519
(That's why Lu Yan
never returned in ten years.)

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,320
(But he is the only son.)

10
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,200
(Would Lu Changhe really kill him?)

11
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,600
Being out of your sight
is a kind of disappearance.

12
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:40,039
Being white bones is another.

13
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:43,399
Mr. Lu, which one do you want?

14
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:45,159
Miss Mu, you are so smart.

15
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:47,000
You must know what I mean.

16
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,280
No matter which one you want,

17
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:50,560
the risk for me is enormous.

18
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,600
So,

19
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:54,159
Mr. Lu,

20
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,039
I need your promise.

21
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,799
I need your full support and trust.

22
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,359
I'm a good choice.

23
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:08,200
Otherwise, you wouldn't have come.

24
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,159
Mr. Lu.

25
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:11,480
Take your time to consider.

26
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:16,959
Alright.

27
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,680
Mr. Lu has been seen with that dancer.

28
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,879
It's all over Haicheng.

29
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,840
A mere dancer dares
to fight me over Changhe?

30
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,439
She must have a death wish!

31
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,879
You wench, open the door!

32
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:41,920
Open the door!

33
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,079
I know you are in there!

34
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:45,359
Open the door!

35
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,680
Open the door!

36
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:49,719
Do you hear me?

37
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:53,920
You wench.

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,280
I'm t-t-too nice to you, huh?

39
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,000
Watch your mouth.

40
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,159
If you dare hurt me,

41
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:01,760
you won't leave here alive.

42
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:04,000
H-hey, don't be rash!

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,719
You should tell that to yourself.

44
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:07,719
If you keep it up,

45
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,280
I won't hold back.

46
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,479
We aren't done.

47
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,039
Look carefully.

48
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,960
Is it that woman who gave you the note?

49
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,000
Yes, it's her.

50
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,479
So smart are you.

51
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,199
Found someone
who was leaving Haicheng that night.

52
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,000
Unfortunately, I found him back.

53
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,439
You wench, dare to use me?

54
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,199
(Wait.)

55
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:49,680
(How did she know
Lu Yan would go to western suburbs?)

56
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,840
You've been showing up
quite a lot lately.

57
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,319
(Just a promise.)

58
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,159
(I can give her.)

59
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,479
(I can't give up such a good knife.)

60
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,879
Such youthful innocence. So beautiful.

61
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,000
Who is it?

62
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,439
When I mentioned Zhu last time

63
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,159
and showed you the photo just now,

64
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,159
your reaction tells me

65
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,199
she must be related to you.

66
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,280
Related to me?

67
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,919
Then I'll deal with it myself.

68
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,080
How dare you?

69
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:55,919
Who is it?

70
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:58,919
Miss Mu, I am Lu Changhe.

71
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,159
The back door. Go!

72
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,080
What's this?

73
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,319
Since you're so eager
to seduce that old man,

74
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,000
I can't let you have your way.

75
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:19,480
Your father will come in at any time.

76
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:21,399
He is not my father.

77
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,360
What?

78
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,199
Miss Mu.

79
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,519
Hold on.

80
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,399
Come again?

81
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,040
He is not my father.

82
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,079
He's just a monster

83
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,759
who looks exactly like my father.

84
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,800
My parents, and your mother,

85
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,800
were all killed by him.

86
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,480
Ridiculous.

87
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,800
If that's the case,

88
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,720
why don't you kill him?

89
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,040
Because I haven't figured out

90
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,199
his true identity.

91
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,600
To outsiders,

92
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,680
killing him would be patricide.

93
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:58,600
Miss Mu.

94
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:00,399
I've thought it through.

95
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:02,600
I can give you a promise.

96
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,040
Make him leave.

97
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,360
Alright, Mr. Lu!

98
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,199
Miss Mu, what did you say?

99
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,680
I didn't catch that.

100
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:31,720
Miss Mu.

101
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,600
May I come in?

102
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:42,399
Make him leave!

103
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,600
Mr. Lu.

104
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,240
I am not properly dressed now.

105
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:53,600
I couldn't see you in person.

106
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,560
What promise will you give me?

107
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:57,519
Marry you.

108
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:58,519
Okay?

109
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:01,639
Reject him.

110
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:17,800
Glad to work with you, Mr. Lu.

111
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,279
Then I'll await your good news.

112
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,519
Young Master.

113
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:26,800
You said he's not your father.

114
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,399
Without solid proof,

115
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,160
I can't believe you.

116
00:06:37,679 --> 00:06:39,231
(Haicheng Station)

117
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,399
Leave Haicheng immediately.

118
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,959
Or I will throw the necklace away.

119
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,959
(Should I go?)

120
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,319
(One yuan)
(Go or stay.)

121
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,759
(Let fate decide.)

122
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:12,896
(Haicheng Station)

123
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,319
Who are you?

124
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,759
May I ask if you're hiring?

125
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,160
At Anhe Industry,

126
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,519
all hiring decisions

127
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,360
require the approval of the chairman.

128
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:09,439
Mr. Lu, are you waiting for me?

129
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,800
Miss Mu.

130
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,480
You are going to become my wife.

131
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:15,399
You shouldn't live in the hotel.

132
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,639
Come to my mansion for a few days.

133
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,519
(Can't wait anymore?)

134
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:21,600
Alright.

135
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,519
Kind sir, please spare some change.

136
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,759
Sir, please!

137
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:32,519
Thank you, sir.

138
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,080
Is it good?

139
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,639
Slow down. There's more.

140
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,279
Don't choke.

141
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:49,440
Here.

142
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:50,440
Thank you, Miss.

143
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:52,399
Mu Lan.

144
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:24,840
Yan,

145
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:26,840
I forgot to tell you.

146
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,360
I invited Miss Mu to stay at our house.

147
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,559
(You shouldn't have come here.)

148
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,320
(What can you do?)

149
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,720
I know why you approached him.

150
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,919
I'll do it for you.

151
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,519
Leave Haicheng.

152
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,840
I know the reason you approached me too.

153
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,519
Lu Yan, stop fooling yourself.

154
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,679
Are you alright?

155
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:21,919
Get out.

156
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,200
Are you okay?

157
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,399
Zhu, what's wrong with you?

158
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:43,840
I just thought of some bad things.

159
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,639
I want to distract myself.

160
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:52,720
You can't distract yourself by that.

161
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,000
Zhu.

162
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,399
