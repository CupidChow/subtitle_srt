=Accidental Firing=

2
00:00:10,913 --> 00:00:13,435
=Episode 19=

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,199
What's this?

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,160
Do you remember the time
you hit me with a dart?

5
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:20,960
Of course.

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,120
If you used a gun,

7
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:23,160
I'd have been dead.

8
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:25,000
Take it.

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,519
It's for your sister.

10
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,880
Young Master, Dong Lin is here.

11
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,200
Why are we here?

12
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,200
Are you scared?

13
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:13,719
I am scared?

14
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:18,760
Didn't we agree
to go to Dafu Clothing Store?

15
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:20,560
A sudden change of plans

16
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,480
will cause severe consequences.

17
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:23,760
Miss Mu,

18
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,159
I worried you'd be too tired traveling.

19
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,920
So I requested dress delivery.

20
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:35,640
Please.

21
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:50,239
Miss Mu,

22
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:52,680
they're our wedding attire.

23
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:54,719
They are made with Suzhou embroidery

24
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,560
and hand-sewn with golden threads.

25
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:59,680
Only two such pieces exist
in all of Haicheng.

26
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,799
What exactly do you want?

27
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:04,079
When I first saw you at the Paradise,

28
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,359
I was deeply captivated by you.

29
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:09,120
If, and I mean if,

30
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,800
I give you everything I have,

31
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,639
can you erase the past

32
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,080
and spend your life with me?

33
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,560
You think everyone's like you,

34
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,960
living only for money?

35
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,560
You've destroyed many people

36
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,479
and families.

37
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,000
And you've twisted so many lives.

38
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,680
How dare you say such things?

39
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,199
But these words need to be said.

40
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:27,919
What if it works?

41
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,479
Miss Mu,

42
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,120
I am serious.

43
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,560
Please consider carefully.

44
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,319
Perhaps

45
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,560
the return I can give you

46
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,759
will be more than you imagine.

47
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,680
Mu Lan,

48
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,960
everything else is negotiable,

49
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,479
but this matter

50
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,080
is not.

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,560
Lu Yan,

52
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,000
I will not marry him.

53
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,439
But since we're here,

54
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,039
we should look for clues.

55
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:13,039
I'm not leaving.

56
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:18,120
I will protect my sister.

57
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,240
I'll support her in whatever she does.

58
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,800
I won't let anyone hurt her.

59
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:31,680
Brother,

60
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,719
do you really have feelings
for that woman?

61
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,520
I do like her.

62
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:36,439
Brother!

63
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:38,800
Mu Lan just wants you dead.

64
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:40,719
She won't spend her life with you.

65
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:42,960
Brother, believe me.

66
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,639
She is a scourge.

67
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:49,439
I know.

68
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,080
Then why you...

69
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:01,199
Tian.

70
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:02,240
Brother.

71
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,000
My wedding with Mu Lan is in two days.

72
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,280
If Mu Lan doesn't show up,

73
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:07,919
will Lu Yan come?

74
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,520
If he doesn't come,

75
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:10,879
how can I get rid of him?

76
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,479
Brother,

77
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,120
I'm sorry.

78
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:16,519
Mu Lan won't be obedient.

79
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,279
Only if I reveal something to her,

80
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:21,839
will she not want to leave me.

81
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:52,639
I've allowed you to stay,

82
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:54,120
but you must stay by my side.

83
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,439
Why are you here alone? Where is Xiao?

84
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:03,399
Why would he be obedient?

85
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:04,639
I let him and Gao Qi

86
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,560
find where Dong Lin's evidence
was moved to.

87
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,079
Why would he listen to you?

88
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,480
He said it himself

89
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,199
that I can make him do anything.

90
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,480
(Why are you here?)

91
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,920
(To eavesdrop.)

92
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,000
(What about you?)

93
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,639
(Same as you.)

94
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:03,079
(Great minds think alike.)

95
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,360
The things in the box
are very important.

96
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:04,079
They must be well guarded.

97
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,800
If you need more manpower,

98
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,560
get support from North City.

99
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,879
North City?

100
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,000
Mobilizing manpower?

101
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,319
It will be quite a stir.

102
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:36,720
I'll keep an eye on it now.

103
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,040
It's a bait.

104
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,199
That man wouldn't be so hasty.

105
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,079
He knew we were listening.

106
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,639
So he deliberately said that

107
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:51,319
only to keep you.

108
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,959
Then we'll just have to play along.

109
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,399
My people have gone to search.

110
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,519
I will try to expand the search area

111
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,360
until we find concrete evidence.

112
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,199
Mu Lan,

113
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:05,560
come back with me.

114
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:09,600
(Dong Lin used me
to lure and kill Lu Yan.)

115
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,199
(His act today)

116
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,720
(is for the same purpose.)

117
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:15,120
(As long as Lu Yan is not with me,)

118
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,720
(he is safe.)

119
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,600
Lu Yan,

120
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:19,839
if you really want to protect me,

121
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,399
leave this place.

122
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:23,399
I'm begging you.

123
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:41,720
Changhe.

124
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:46,320
Well,

125
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,559
I've thought for a long time

126
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:52,480
about who is more suitable
for you, Mu Lan or me.

127
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,399
I think

128
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:56,639
whether it's about appearance
or background,

129
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:58,320
especially background,

130
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,879
I am superior to her.

131
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:03,200
My family is distinguished in Haicheng.

132
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,759
And Mu Lan is just a dancer.

133
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:07,960
If you take her out,

134
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,000
I would be embarrassed for you.

135
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:13,200
Miss Ling,

136
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:15,360
what do you want to say?

137
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,159
Changhe,

138
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,000
marry me.

139
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:21,840
My grandfather said

140
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,039
as long as you marry me,

141
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:25,080
you can deploy our family's forces
as you wish

142
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,759
to take down that unfilial Lu Yan.

143
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:31,879
Okay.

144
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:33,799
Thank Mr. Ling for me.

145
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:37,159
No worries.

146
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,559
We will be a family from now on.

147
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:40,360
Changhe,

148
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:42,360
I will definitely give you a son.

149
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,559
I won't let your line end.

150
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:47,720
I'll share the good news with Grandpa.

151
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:48,879
Changhe,

152
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,320
what name would you like

153
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:52,679
for our future child?

154
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,919
