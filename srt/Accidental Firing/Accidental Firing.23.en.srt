00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,760
How could this happen?

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,239
How could this happen?

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,160
How did it become like this?

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,359
Brother, keep your voice down.

7
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:27,359
Be quiet.

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,440
Brother,

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,280
what do we do next?

10
00:00:37,364 --> 00:00:39,296
(Clinic Room, Ward 1)

11
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,000
Let's go in.

12
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:46,159
I'll not go in.

13
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:50,640
Is ten minutes enough?

14
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,280
Five minutes is enough.

15
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,502
(Ward 1)

16
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:01,799
Sister.

17

Xiao.

18
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,120
- Sister.
- Be careful.

19
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,840
Sister.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,760
Governor Lu.

21
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:28,840
Have we met before?

22
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:30,120
I know you.

23
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,560
My surname is Ding.

24
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,359
Mr. Ding.

25
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:38,560
Feel free to speak your mind.

26
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,799
Dong Lin was caught.
Your revenge was taken.

27
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:41,799
But

28
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:44,159
our country is now in chaos,

29
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,319
plundered wantonly.

30
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,040
I know.

31
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,920
Let's find a time to have a good talk.

32
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,239
Okay.

00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,719
Be careful.

(Lu Changhe, September 20th, 1916)

37
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,240
Yan,

38
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,719
let's go home.

39
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:18,480
Stop.

40
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,279
What are you doing?

41
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,000
I can't.

42
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,959
I can't

43
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:26,639
let him have you.

44
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,839
If you keep this up,

45
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,759
you will exhaust
our ten years of friendship.

46
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:50,160
Brother.

47
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,000
Brother.

48
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,639
Did you get the money?

49
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:55,279
I got an unexpected gain.

50
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:56,439
What is this?

51
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,279
I snatched it from a journalist.

52
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,959
He was bewitched by Lu Yan
and went to Langshan.

53
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,959
He didn't find anything there.

54
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,279
But on his way back,

55
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:05,240
(Wang Xinglin's letter to Liang Xiao)
he met someone

56
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,319
called Wang Xinglin.

57
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,240
Wang Xinglin?

58
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,040
Right.

59
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,480
Learning he was a journalist,

60
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:12,600
Wang gave him a letter

61
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,639
to publish a missing person notice.

62
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,199
This is Wang Xinglin's sister,

63
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:17,920
Wang Xinghua's letter before her death.

64
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:19,759
She had a son

65
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:21,000
named Wang Liangxiao.

66
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,000
His biological dad is Dong Lin.

67
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:26,800
Say it again.

68
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,480
It can't be wrong.

69
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:30,319
You are his biological dad.

70
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,360
It'll make it a lot easier from now on.

71
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,120
Brother.

72
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:47,800
Brother?

73
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,279
(No.)

74
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,120
(I have to go see him.)

75
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:57,560
You're seeking death.

76
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,519
If it weren't for you,

77
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,079
my sister wouldn't seek revenge,

78
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:06,879
and she wouldn't have met Lu Yan.

79
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:09,079
She is mine! Mine!

80
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,439
Wang Xinghua.

81
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,600
How do you know this name?

82
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:18,240
She fled to Langshan 19 years ago.

83
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,879
I saved her.

84
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,120
She gave birth to you later.

85
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,399
But she ran away because I was too poor.

86
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,040
She was my wife.

87
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:32,839
Nonsense!

88
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:34,560
Look. It's your mom's
handwritten letter.

89
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,639
Take a look.

90
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:40,439
Get lost.

91
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,040
I am your dad.

92
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:45,879
I told you to get lost.

93
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,040
Now!

94
00:06:59,904 --> 00:07:06,432
(Wang Xinglin's letter to Liang Xiao)

95
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,240
Brother,

96
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:17,920
family is family.

97
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,160
He won't ignore you.

98
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,040
At that time,

99
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,120
we can leave Haicheng safely.

100
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,399
I have only one son.

101
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,079
- I have only one son.
- Brother.

102
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,480
Brother.

103
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,399
I have...

104
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,120
- Only one son.
- Listen to me.

105
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:33,759
- I have only one son.
- Listen to me!

106
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,600
Listen to me!

107
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:37,160
The priority now is

108
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:38,720
to let him get us out of the city.

109
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:39,759
Otherwise,

110
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,040
we both will die.

111
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:20,360
Young Master,

112
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,439
a man named Ding Pei
has come to see you.

113
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,839
He said you have an appointment.

114
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,160
Let him in.

115
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,319
Okay.

116
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,519
Please sit.

117
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,279
Thank you.

118
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,080
Governor Lu,

119
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:40,679
actually, I've been following you
for a long time.

120
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,080
You are different from other warlords.

121
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,159
As a governor,

122
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:45,879
you don't seize territories,

123
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,919
plunder the people,

124
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,679
or harass the civilians.

125
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:50,480
What do you want?

126
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,600
Our country is now fragmented.

127
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:56,559
The National Revolutionary Army
has secured Guangdong

128
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:57,919
as the Northern Expedition base.

129
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,759
I think we can continue to cooperate

130
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:00,840
in the Northern Expedition.

131
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:03,720
(The Northern Expedition?)

132
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,120
However, the enemy is brutal.

133
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,480
The road ahead is harsh.

134
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:09,399
You can think it over

135
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:10,720
before answering me.

136
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:13,600
Mr. Ding,

137
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:15,679
I lay low for ten years

138
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,200
for my family's revenge.

139
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,200
And you do it for your belief

140
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,279
and the country.

141
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:22,639
I respect you

142
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,360
from the bottom of my heart.

143
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,080
Therefore,

144
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,960
please let me join you.

145
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:38,440
I will leave first.

146
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:40,200
Take care.

147
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:54,879
Lu Yan,

148
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,279
remember.

149
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:58,039
Whatever you want to do,

150
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:00,039
I will unconditionally support you.

151
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:15,399
Xiao.

152
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,600
Did you catch Dong Lin?

153
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:20,440
No.

154
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,200
What's wrong?

155
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,279
I can make Dong Lin

156
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,360
