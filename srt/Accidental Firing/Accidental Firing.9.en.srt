=Episode 9=

3
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:15,720
Don't harm her.

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:16,960
I'm warning you.

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,640
Don't harm her.

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,440
How could I possibly harm Mu Lan?

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,440
She is the first woman in my life

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,160
that I want to marry.

9
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,600
Mr. Lu, what happened?

10
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,079
Still doing business?

11
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,840
Miss Mu, I'm sorry.

12
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:11,359
I just remembered something.

13
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,319
I have to go now.

14
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,719
Last night,

15
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:27,239
my tone was a bit heavy.

16
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,760
I...

17
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:29,480
It's okay.

18
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,079
Wasn't that your usual style, Governor?

19
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,239
As I said,

20
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,159
I can compromise on other things,

21
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,920
but I can't back down

22
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,599
on my father's honor.

23
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:42,640
I respect and understand it,

24
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,120
not accept it.

25
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:47,760
Young Master,

26
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,920
a killer was on the Xinghuo rooftop,

27
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,079
but he was dealt with.

28
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,200
With one slash.

29
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,120
(If it's to kill me,)

30
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,359
(Lu Changhe wouldn't
make such a fuss.)

31
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,920
(His goal)

32
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,120
(is to use me to kill Lu Yan.)

33
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,000
He had murderous intent
at last night's party.

34
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,159
Mu Lan,

35
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,080
be careful.

36
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:17,520
Young Master,

37
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,919
how to deal with the killer's body?

38
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,199
Of course, send it

39
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:26,120
to whoever did it.

40
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:43,879
This is Lu's Mansion.

41
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,960
(Public phone booth)
Sister, you've finally answered.

42
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,879
Are you okay?

43
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm fine.

44
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:49,080
What's wrong?

45
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:53,000
Lu Changhe arranged a killer
on the roof of Xinghuo.

46
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,000
You can't stay in Lu's Mansion.

47
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,199
Leave now.

48
00:02:58,439 --> 00:02:59,120
Xiao,

49
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,879
his target is not me.

50
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,000
You needn't worry.

51
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,360
Ding Pei gave a speech
at the gate of Anhe that day.

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,159
Lu Changhe severely injured him

53
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,400
and broke his arm.

54
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,240
He is so cruel.

55
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,439
How can I not worry?

56
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,039
How did you know

57
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,439
these things?

58
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,560
Ding Pei is my friend
who helped fake my identity

59
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:15,960
since I came back to Haicheng.

60
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,439
I happened to see him that day.

61
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,639
Don't worry.

62
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:20,919
Lu Changhe will only think
it was Ding Pei.

63
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:21,919
He won't know about me.

64
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:22,960
Xiao,

65
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,479
I understand your concern.

66
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:25,520
But I don't want

67
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,240
you to be so impulsive
and stubborn anymore.

68
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:27,840
Understand?

69
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:28,840
I understand.

70
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:30,479
But I can't do it.

71
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:32,039
Learn to do it if you can't.

72
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,439
Sister?

73
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,360
Sister?

74
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,759
(I haven't avenged.)

75
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,879
(But I was used by my enemy)

76
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,439
(and put Lu Yan
in such a dangerous situation.)

77
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:48,439
Today...

78
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,199
Mu Lan,

79
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:50,800
leave Haicheng.

80
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,040
I will take care of the rest.

81
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,800
You?

82
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:02,360
Don't you just want that man
to pay with blood?

83
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:03,079
Yes.

84
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,199
And I definitely will.

85
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,839
I will do that for you.

86
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,759
So,

87
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,000
leave here.

88
00:05:13,472 --> 00:05:14,720
You can't do it for me.

89
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,839
I can do it for you.

90
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,519
His life

91
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,800
is for me to take.

92
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,279
No one can avenge my mother's

93
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:25,680
death for me.

94
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,319
But I just want you to be safe.

95
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:39,879
I'll try my best.

96
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,879
Keep your dirty tricks to yourself.

97
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,360
If there is a next time,

98
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,079
I will put you under house arrest
until you die.

99
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,279
Who is it?

100
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,120
It's me.

101
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,439
Have you thought
about my offer last night?

102
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:57,639
No.

103
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,120
I...

104
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,519
I need to talk to you.

105
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,680
Then come in.

106
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:34,240
Go ahead.

107
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:36,160
These ten years,

108
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:39,000
although I haven't
figured out his real identity,

109
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:41,120
I have grasped his nature completely.

110
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,839
He's petty, calculating,

111
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,920
and highly vindictive.

112
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,439
Every person he harmed

113
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,560
suffered impairment differently.

114
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,879
Ding Pei gave a speech
at the gate of Anhe that day.

115
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:53,639
Lu Changhe severely injured him

116
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:54,680
and broke his arm.

117
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:55,800
I think

118
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,120
those limbs

119
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,800
are likely to be taken
as trophies by him.

120
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,759
He might always carry them

121
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,639
and admire them now and then

122
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,120
to satisfy his inner sickness
and deficiency.

123
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:06,120
Therefore,

124
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,399
there must be a secret room

125
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,839
for him to satisfy
his psychopathic needs.

126
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:11,600
A secret room?

127
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,079
Where?

128
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,199
The Lu family hall.

129
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:20,120
Are you sure?

130
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,199
Every time he gets

131
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:22,720
a trophy, he goes there

132
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,399
and stays for more than an hour.

133
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:25,560
I don't think

134
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,199
he would spend that much time

135
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:28,720
to mourn the Lu ancestors.

136
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:30,600
There must be a secret room.

137
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,039
Lu Yan,

138
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,320
I can't wait for you indefinitely.

139
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,000
You better hurry up.

140
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:38,879
Okay.

141
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,519
I-I need to get changed.

142
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,840
