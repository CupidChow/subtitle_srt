=Episode 13=

3
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:16,359
Since there's no mechanism
to open the secret room,

4
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:18,239
the key must be in his hands.

5
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:20,399
I can only find out
if I get close to him.

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,960
I don't want to go shopping!

7
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:22,960
I know it.

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,239
But,

9
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:26,800
isn't shopping also good?

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,399
I'm not in the mood for that.

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,759
Listen to this.

12
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,000
(Useless!)

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,880
(Not thinking about killing Lu Yan,)

14
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:40,359
(doing the pointless stuff.)

15
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,560
(Forget it.)

16
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:43,200
(It's best he can do it.)

17
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,359
(Or, I won't let Lu Yan live.)

18
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:47,719
(At that time,)

19
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:48,880
(Biao,)

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,560
(you'd be the perfect scapegoat.)

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,719
How did you record

22
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,960
this secret conversation?

23
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,200
Back from Yuncheng,

24
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,399
I started planning it.

25
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:01,119
At first, I wanted
to place it in his study.

26
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,079
But he cleans it himself every day.

27
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:04,760
I can't retrieve it.

28
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:05,760
So

29
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,680
I put it in the table in the courtyard.

30
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,159
How do you plan to use it?

31
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,439
I have an idea.

32
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:17,200
(Anhe Employee Recognition Ceremony)
Let's welcome our Chairman.

33
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:18,159
Applause!

34
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,680
Good.

35
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,599
Respected leaders,

36
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:28,040
fellow colleagues,

37
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,239
good afternoon.

38
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,879
Bravo! Bravo!

39
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:35,760
The recognition ceremony

40
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,239
has been held

41
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,519
for 20 years now.

42
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:40,799
In these 20 years,

43
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:43,239
though it's been chaotic,

44
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,519
our benefits

45
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,560
got better year by year.

46
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,519
The bonuses also increased.

47
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,239
We must thank Chairman for all this,

48
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,920
isn't that right?

49
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:56,920
Yes!

50
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,000
Chairman cares us so much

51
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:03,680
and treats us well.

52
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,640
What should we do in return?

53
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:09,000
We'd do everything for Mr. Lu,

54
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,439
risk life and limb,

55
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,159
and give our all!

56
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,360
Yes!

57
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:15,080
Give our all!

58
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:16,319
Vice Chairman Zhao.

59
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,599
Stop flattering me.

60
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,479
Chairman Lu.

61
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:21,039
This is truly my heartfelt words.

62
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:23,919
Let's start.

63
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,439
Secretary Tao,

64
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:27,439
turn on the music.

65
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,439
Let's get the atmosphere going.

66
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:32,960
Bravo!

67
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:34,840
Bravo!

68
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,039
(Chairman.)

69
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,680
(Biao, sit.)

70
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,000
(Yesterday,)

71
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:49,919
(I saw an anonymous letter
at your door.)

72
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,560
(Worried others would take it,)

73
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:53,520
(so I slipped it through your door.)

74
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,400
(Alright.)

75
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:55,800
(I'll check it later.)

76
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:57,400
(This is today's newspaper.)

77
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,479
(Here you are.)

78
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,639
(I'll leave now.)

79
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,840
(Useless!)

80
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,719
(Not thinking about how to kill Lu Yan,)

81
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,319
(doing the pointless stuff.)

82
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:06,400
(Forget it.)

83
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:07,800
(It's best he can make it.)

84
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,439
(Or, I won't let Lu Yan live.)

85
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,479
(At that time,)

86
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,360
(Biao,)

87
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:14,680
(you'd be the perfect scapegoat.)

88
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:15,719
Who is it?

89
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,080
Who mimicked my voice and Zhao's voice

90
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,120
so well?

91
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,879
Step forward. I'll commend you.

92
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:30,240
Biao,

93
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:32,439
do you believe it?

94
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:35,479
Of course not!

95
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:38,639
It must be rivals trying to sow discord.

96
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,039
They can't stand

97
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:42,159
seeing us

98
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:43,360
united and doing well.

99
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,199
D-Definitely.

100
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:46,960
Everyone,

101
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,280
you all know what kind of person I am.

102
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,319
If you think the recording is real

103
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:53,879
and I'm just a hypocrite,

104
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,719
it doesn't matter.

105
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,400
You can leave.

106
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,439
I'll give you another three months' pay.

107
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:05,960
Biao.

108
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,240
Music.

109
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,240
M-Music.

110
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,600
Come on. Let's dance too!

111
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,199
Come on.

112
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,079
Continue!

113
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,360
Come on.

114
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:33,639
Dance!

115
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:03,480
It's me.

116
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,680
How is it?

117
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,319
Things did not go as I expected.

118
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:10,959
Such direct evidence

119
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:12,160
did not arouse suspicion?

120
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,920
That man has a strong mental fortitude.

121
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,800
Zhao Debiao even won't dare flip.

122
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,519
I planned that
once everyone turned on him,

123
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:20,879
I would uncover his true identity.

124
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:23,079
But...

125
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:25,079
If a single recording
could bring him down,

126
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:27,279
he wouldn't have stood strong
for ten years.

127
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:28,560
Sorry.

128
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,639
I let you down.

129
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,680
It doesn't matter.

130
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,240
I've waited for so many years.

131
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,560
Lu Yan.

132
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:37,240
You need to talk to Zhao Debiao.

133
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,040
Before we take him down,

134
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,399
make sure he won't act rashly.

135
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,360
Search everywhere!

136
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:51,279
Search the whole house and the company!

137
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:52,839
Find the recording devices!

138
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,720
Search!

139
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,600
The courtyard.

140
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:02,519
The courtyard?

141
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:07,079
Speak!

142
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:11,720
Mr. Lu,

143
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,600
we've found Liang Xiao.

144
00:06:17,716 --> 00:06:19,557
(Jinxiu Hotel)

145
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:53,079
Mr. Lu, are you okay?

146
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm okay.

147
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,839
Lucky I didn't take him lightly.

148
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:11,759
Mr. Lu.

149
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,160
He is deeply in love with Mu Lan.

150
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,800
Liang Xiao.

151
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,360
How did you meet Mu Lan?

152
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,000
Kill me or torture me, whatever.

153
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,439
Why talk nonsense?

154
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:49,800
Tian.

155
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,519
Mr. Lu.

156
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,600
Go deliver a letter to Miss Mu.

157
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:53,480
Yes!

158
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,399
If you go find her,

159
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,560
I will kill you.

160
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,000
Kill me?

161
00:07:58,399 --> 00:07:58,959
Kill me.

162
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,040
Kill me!

163
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,399
Liang Xiao.

164
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,879
I respect you as a man,

165
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,560
so I'll give you a dignified death.

166
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:11,439
When you reach the hell,

167
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,360
you should thank me.

168
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,560
Miss Mu, a letter for you.

169
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:29,639
Thank you.

170
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,840
Ten miles west of the city.

171
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:49,960
