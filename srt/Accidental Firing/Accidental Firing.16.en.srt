00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,519
Mu Lan.

4
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,280
What's wrong with your arm?

5
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:27,960
I'm okay.

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:29,640
Sister.

7
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:31,160
Why is he here?

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,560
This is my villa.

9
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,880
This is my home.

10
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:36,079
I don't want to be here.

11
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:38,000
Sister, let's go.

12
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,000
Don't move.

13
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,560
Behave yourself.

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,399
Let go.

15
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,240
Are you okay?

16
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:51,240
I'm fine.

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,479
Xiao.

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,719
Without Lu Yan,

19
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:55,280
we'd have been killed by that man.

20
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:56,399
This is too much.

21
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,240
Consider it a favor I owe you.

22
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,280
He's still injured.

23
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:07,319
Going out now, he'd die.

24
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:08,760
Just stay here.

25
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:11,640
My home will be yours too.

26
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:13,840
Lie down.

27
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:17,319
Sister.

28
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,239
Take good care of yourself now.

29
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,760
Nothing is more important
than your health.

30
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:36,840
Dong Lin,

31
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,599
from Langshan, Qingzhou.

32
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,359
The real and fake Lu Changhe

33
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:44,120
has been a hot topic around the city.

34
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:47,879
Weren't all twenty families in Langshan

35
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,760
burned in a fire?

36
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:54,400
Why did the information leak out?

37
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:55,599
Brother.

38
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,079
It must be Lu Yan.

39
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,239
Don't I know it?

40
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:02,000
The point is how he found out!

41
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,560
Brother.

42
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,680
We can't wait any longer.

43
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,719
Let's send someone
to attack Haitang Villa,

44
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,520
and kill Lu Yan.

45
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:11,280
No way.

46
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:13,879
Attacking him now is asking for trouble.

47
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,840
Then tell me what to do?

48
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:19,479
Even if we can suppress it now,

49
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,639
but as it spreads,

50
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,680
more and more people will believe it!

51
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,520
Don't rush.

52
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,240
Pay him back

53
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,479
in his own coin.

54
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:35,639
Mu Lan

55
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,639
is my future wife.

56
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,560
Now she lives with my son
in Haitang Villa.

57
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:42,840
Ridiculous!

58
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,280
The real and fake Lu Changhe?

59
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,039
This is obviously Lu Yan

60
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,280
framing me

61
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,080
to take his stepmother.

62
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:54,080
Brother, I understand.

63
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,919
I will handle it right now.

64
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,800
You're injured on the head,

65
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:09,000
and you, on the left hand.

66
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,800
Neither affects the right hand.

67
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,719
Eat.

68
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,879
I am left-handed.

69
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,199
My head hurts. I can't hold chopsticks.

70
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,080
I am very hungry.

71
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,319
If I don't eat now,

72
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,319
I'll faint immediately.

73
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,240
Great. Saves us some food.

74
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,680
Sister, I will eat.

75
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:23,919
Grudge unsolved,

76
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,520
acting childish here.

77
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,280
Eat if you want.

78
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,879
If not, leave the table.

79
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,680
I must hold my ground.

80
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,919
Otherwise, someone

81
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:34,599
will not know his place.

82
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:36,879
He said you don't know your place.

83
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,439
Don't eat.

84
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,120
Aren't you unwilling to eat?

85
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,519
Then don't eat.

86
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,839
Don't eat cold food.

87
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,120
I'll do some more.

88
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,759
Sister, noodles with gravy.

89
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,000
Mu Lan, I want steak.

90
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:50,480
Thank you, sister.

91
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,600
I want to eat steak.

92
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,480
Eat something easy to digest at night.

93
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:03,519
I want to eat steak.

94
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,160
Beef is inflammatory.

95
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,160
Xiao's wound hasn't healed yet.

96
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,920
What's it got to do with me?

97
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,120
I don't have time cook separate meals.

98
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:25,439
So you made what he likes?

99
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,360
I will make it for you tomorrow.

100
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:29,800
I want to eat steak right now.

101
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,040
Don't make a fuss.

102
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:32,319
It's just a dish.

103
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,120
I'll make it for you tomorrow.

104
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,000
What if

105
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:40,480
I don't want it tomorrow?

106
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,639
Mu Lan.

107
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,839

I'll make you a steak.

113
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:26,639
No need.

114
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,279
Didn't you want to eat it yesterday?

115
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:32,360
I told you.

116
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,399
