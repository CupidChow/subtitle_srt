=Episode 5=

3
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:14,880
Two years ago,

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,519
Mu Lan arrived in Nanyang.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,359
She lived in seclusion

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,920
with no social contact.

7
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:22,280
But where was she before that

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,600
is untraceable.

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,199
Appear out of nowhere and live alone?

10
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,079
She wiped her past so clean.

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,120
Who is she protecting?

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:30,839
Sir.

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,000
I've had people investigate.

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,759
The report call will come
at 3 p.m. the day after tomorrow.

15
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:36,759
Good.

16
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,280
Changhe!

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,640
Lu Yan and Mu Lan
are cheating behind your back!

18
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:46,799
Go catch them in the act!

19
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:57,280
Go!

20
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:01,719
Hurry up.

21
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,319
Where is Mu Lan?

22
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,120
You have to believe me.

23
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,359
I'm telling the truth!

24
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,400
Changhe!

25
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:35,640
Young Master.

26
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:37,719
Let's go.

27
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:39,120
Go find the antidote.

28
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:40,319
Okay.

29
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:49,120
Changhe.

30
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:50,920
Changhe.

31
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:53,079
I actually saw them go in.

32
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,280
And the aphrodisiac...

33
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,599
I mean,

34
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,599
go back and check again,

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,519
okay?

36
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,439
Miss Ling.

37
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,439
I know you mean well.

38
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:06,040
But they are my son

39
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,799
and my future wife.

40
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,199
If you want me to believe you,

41
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,039
give me solid evidence.

42
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,479
I should've caught them in bed!

43
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,319
I'll leave.

44
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,439
She played a good hand into a mess.

45
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:40,400
But...

46
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,680
After so many years,

47
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:17,120
I thought I would never see you again.

Zhu.

61
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,240
Miss Mu.

62
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,199
Nothing happened last night.

63
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,519
Don't worry.

64
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:07,240
Get out.

65
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,928
We inhaled aphrodisiac incense.

66
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,519
It is very potent.

67
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,800
You must take medicine.

68
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:21,319
It's not hot.

69
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,199
I said get out.

70
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,600
Drink it.

71
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,199
Then I'll leave.

72
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,279
Get out.

73
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,199
I have things to say.

74
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:54,560
Get better,

75
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,079
and I will come.

76
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:04,759
Ling Yao!

77
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,040
(Lu Yan likes Mu Lan.)

78
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,240
(Well,)

79
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,040
(I'll use her to provoke you.)

80
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,800
(Although I'm a bit reluctant,)

81
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:23,040
(if she can help end you,)

82
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:24,560
(it's worth it.)

83
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,639
(Wedding date: December 31st next year)
Miss Mu.

84
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,319
Our wedding date is set.

85
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:38,480
Mr. Lu.

86
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:39,920
Why publish it?

87
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:41,959
I don't want others to hit on you.

88
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:44,399
Miss Mu.

89
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,199
After all,

90
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:49,000
you are so beautiful.

91
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,319
So,

92
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,279
I want everyone in Haicheng to know,

93
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:57,759
you are my woman.

94
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:15,079
You don't have to do anything.

95
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,480
I'll handle it.

96
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,240
Don't waste time on it.

97
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,720
This matter is very important.

98
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:26,759
That day at Paradise,

99
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,759
what you said
about the real and fake Mr. Lu

100
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:29,920
stuck with me.

101
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,800
But I will say it again.

102
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:32,759
Lu Yan,

103
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,759
if you want me to believe you,

104
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,519
give me the evidence.

105
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,976
Where are you going?

106
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,199
Back to the hotel to pack.

107
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:47,959
Governor.

108
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,160
By the dart's material
and forging method,

109
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,240
we've tracked down a shop
near the border

110
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,360
and found the buyer.

111
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:54,000
Who is it?

112
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:57,560
