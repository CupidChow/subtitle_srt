00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:13,499
=Episode 12=

3
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:24,199
Stop!

4
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:43,960
Sister.

5
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:45,119
What's wrong with you?

6
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,039
Why care about him so much?

7
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,479
There's a misunderstanding.

8
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:50,880
Lu Yan is a victim too.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,840
We're the same.

10
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,159
He is not my enemy.

11
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,640
After our revenge is taken,

12
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:01,479
will he still be with us?

13
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,439
Of course not.

14
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,280
Why did you come here?

15
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:14,879
He discovered our relationship.

16
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,200
But I did not admit it.

17
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,439
I won't drag you down.

18
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:18,000
You...

19
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,920
Don't drive me away.

20
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:22,840
Xiao.

21
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,200
Today he used you to kill Lu Yan.

22
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,840
Tomorrow he might use you to kill me.

23
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:27,439
I won't.

24
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:28,719
Then he will kill you.

25
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:32,079
Even if I die,

26
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:34,480
I will take him down with me.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,280
Anyway, don't drive me away.

28
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:37,439
This is my own business.

29
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:38,599
Nothing to do with you.

30
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:39,599
If you get hurt...

31
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:43,959
How would I do?

32
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,000
Sister.

33
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:48,599
If it weren't for you,
I'd be dead long ago.

34
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:49,920
Besides,

35
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:52,079
I know what I am doing.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,959
Do what you should.

37
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,359
Don't do what shouldn't.

38
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:03,239
Don't fantasize about the woman
not belongs to you.

39
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,920
The last one,

40
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,319
you should take to heart.

41
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:08,680
Lu Yan.

42
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,639
Back off my sister.

43
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,599
Or I will kill you.

44
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:12,919
Liang Xiao.

45
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,000
In my eyes, you are nothing.

46
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,400
You should be very grateful for this.

47
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,719
Stop it!

48
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,039
We'll see.

49
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:33,520
You brat.

50
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,319
Dare to challenge me?

51
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,719
When Lu Yan is dead,

52
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:39,919
Mu Lan will be my caged canary.

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,479
Mr. Lu...

54
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,240
Stop.

55
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:42,159
Don't sit there.

56
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:43,479
Have a relax.

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,960
Wait for the result.

58
00:02:53,588 --> 00:02:56,576
(Public phone booth)

59
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,439
I've dealt with the staff in the back.

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,639
Tian.

61
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:10,479
Others may doubt our relationship.

62
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,400
Leave Haicheng first.

63
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,080
In a few years, it will be our world.

64
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,759
(We've worked hard for years
to get this far.)

65
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,080
(If Lu Yan found the room)

66
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,159
(instead of dying...)

67
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:25,039
(No. I have to go check.)

68
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,439
The candlestick dent

69
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,199
could unlock the secret room.

70
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:32,800
Then figure it out.

71
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,280
Mu Lan.

72
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,719
We shouldn't be affected by Liang Xiao.

73
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:42,599
You don't know.

74
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,680
Come out!

75
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,080
Young Master.

76
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:03,000
It's me.

77
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:04,439
What a coincidence.

78
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,360
Check if I am dead for your master?

79
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,280
I'm not.

80
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:11,280
Disappointed?

81
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,960
Young Master,
I don't know what you're saying.

82
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,199
Is the secret room

83
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,480
where that man hid the evidence?

84
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,639
That man?

85
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:19,920
Who, Young Master?

86
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,199
Li Tian.

87
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:23,720
I'm not a good person.

88
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,000
Letting you live this long

89
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:27,920
is already my greatest mercy.

90
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,759
Young Master, even if you kill me,

91
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:30,800
I still don't know.

92
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,639
Lu Yan, you really fired?

93
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,199
How to open the door? Tell me!

94
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,120
I don't know, Young Master.

95
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,000
He never let me into it before.

96
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:43,639
Get lost.

97
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,639
So the evidence is really hidden there.

98
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,800
Do you

99
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:32,639
need anything?

100
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:34,839
Urgency.

101
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:45,959
There's a secret room
in the ancestral hall.

102
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,199
Why did you know?

103
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,800
By some ignoble ways.

104
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:53,160
You better not ask.

105
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:58,360
He set up a secret room
in the ancestral hall

106
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,199
and put the evidence there,

107
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,560
because he thought
you wouldn't touch there.

108
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,879
Although I still don't know

109
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:05,160
how to open the secret room,

110
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,560
another line

111
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:08,040
I planted years ago

112
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:09,000
has new clues.

113
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,199
Another line?

114
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,000
These years I've had people searching

115
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,680
for someone who resembles my father.

116
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,519
I just received clues.

117
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,519
What clues?

118
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,759
Someone saw my father in Qingzhou.

119
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,000
But he has never been there.

120
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:21,959
Qingzhou?

121
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:24,439
I've already sent more people there.

122
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,399
Mr. Lu!

123
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:36,319
Lu Yan is not dead.

124
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,319
He's still alive!

125
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,199
Mr. Lu.

126
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,839
- Mr. Lu.
- Tian?

127
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,759
What's wrong?

128
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,639
Mr. Lu.

129
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,680
The red wine is top-quality.

130
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,560
Have a few with me.

131
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,240
Wait.

132
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:47,959
Let's drink liquor.

133
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,199
Drink until we're wasted!

134
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:49,920
Mr. Lu.

135
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,240
I just saw him alive, Mr. Lu.

136
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:57,279
Still alive?

137
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,959
Yes. I saw it.

138
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,160
Mr. Lu.

139
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:05,279
Is the secret room
in the Lu ancestral hall really secure?

140
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:07,560
No way he can open it

141
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,879
without explosives.

142
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:09,800
More importantly,

143
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,199
it's his family's hall.

144
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,720
Would he dare?

145
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,000
Tian.

146
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:16,959
Mr. Lu.

147
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,079
What's on your mind?

148
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,759
N-Nothing.

149
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,800
Sorry, Mr. Lu.

150
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,360
That's good.

151
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,519
Lu Yan is really lucky.

152
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,920
We still need Liang Xiao.

153
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:37,959
Right!

154
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:40,600
We can catch Liang Xiao first.

155
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,680
Then, Mu Lan will go to save him.

156
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,360
Using her to lure Lu Yan.

157
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,319
Find Liang Xiao.

158
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,720
Keep a close watch on him.

159
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,720
Mr. Lu.

160
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,800
Miss Mu.

161
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,279
The weather is nice today.

162
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,480
Let's go out

163
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,519
and buy something for our wedding.

164
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,079
(Planting assassin somewhere?)

165
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:11,399
Yan.

166
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:13,759
Sorry, Miss Mu.

167
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,120
I have things to do.

168
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:16,199
Let him go with you.

169
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:20,240
Mr. Lu, it's not right
to delegate something like this.

170
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:22,319
After all, it's our wedding.

171
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,000
He'll do just fine.

172
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,319
Mr. Lu.

173
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:31,480
What do you want?

174
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,559
Shopping.

175
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,039
Since there's no mechanism
to open the secret room,

176
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,120
the key must be in his hands.

177
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,080
I can only find out
if I get close to him.

178
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,679
I don't really want to go shopping!

179
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,639
I know it.

180
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:46,879
But,

181
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,679
isn't shopping also good?

182
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:54,120
I'm not in the mood for that.

183
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:56,879
Let me show you something.

00:09:07,348 --> 00:09:11,928
