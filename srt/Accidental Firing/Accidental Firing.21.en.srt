=Accidental Firing=

2
00:00:10,881 --> 00:00:13,403
=Episode 21=

3
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,479
You really don't learn your lesson.

4
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,000
Fell into my hands again.

5
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,719
Want to die together?

6
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:17,599
Don't drag me down with you.

7
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,760
Wait. You can't die yet.

8
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:21,920
You're more useful alive.

9
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,120
But I'm a little reluctant.

10
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,000
Just now,

11
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,400
that smile of yours

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,040
was just like me.

13
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,480
Behave yourself.

14
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,719
Guess what I'm going to do with it?

15
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,319
(If I act rashly,)

16
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:03,319
(it will mess up Lu Yan's plan.)

17
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:04,439
(But...)

18
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:07,920
(What if...)

19
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:10,759
(Lu Yan, I'm sorry.)

20
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,439
(I can't leave Xiao alone.)

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,240
(I must find him.)

22
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:19,800
Miss Mu.

23
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,560
Tomorrow is our wedding day.

24
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:24,159
Come back with me.

25
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:25,159
Dong Lin.

26
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,240
You're still dreaming even now?

27
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:35,919
Xiao.

28
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,000
Can you come back with me now?

29
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,639
You unfilial son.

30
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:45,599
Why are you here?

31
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,479
Mr. Ling.

32
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,240
Tell your people to stay put.

33
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:55,319
Otherwise,

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,520
you will die together with Dong Lin.

35
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,680
Dong Lin? What are you talking about?

36
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,479
I have no patience.

37
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,719
If you dare to harm us...

38
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,199
Yao.

39
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,439
Let me make a phone call.

40
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,120
Where is Xiao?

41
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,960
He is still alive.

42
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,159
But you won't see him
until the wedding ends.

43
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,520
Even now,
you still want me to marry you?

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Why not?

45
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,439
Miss Mu.

46
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,439
Life is but a fleeting mist.

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,319
Nothing can be retained.

48
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,560
Why make life so hard for yourself?

49
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,560
Marry me

50
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,879
and we'll enjoy wealth together.

51
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,439
Even if life is fleeting,

52
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:47,599
it's different for being remembered
with honor or shame.

53
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:49,080
Dong Lin.

54
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,960
You won't end well.

55
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:53,879
Okay.

56
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,039
If you don't agree,

57
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,280
you'll cause Liang Xiao's death.

58
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:02,919
You...

59
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,439
It's Lu Yan.

60
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,279
Young Master.

61
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:58,759
The villa's been taken.

62
00:04:58,959 --> 00:04:59,920
The evidence is in hand.

63
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:02,000
But...

64
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:04,600
What?

65
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,759
Don't be rash.

66
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,000
Governor,
Miss Mu's taken away by Dong Lin.

67
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,199
Miss Mu.

68
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,480
Try on the wedding dress.

69
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,879
What are you scheming now?

70
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,360
Nothing.

71
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:44,480
You want me to exchange
Liang Xiao's life for it?

72
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:55,519
What are you doing?

73
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,879
How dare you be so rude?

74
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:57,920
Get out.

75
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,240
Yes.

76
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,279
Lu Yan.

77
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,240
Go with me.

78
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:06,920
You should be the one leaving.

79
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:08,759
Mu Lan.

80
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,000
Wedding dress try-on time.

81
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:15,199
Try touching her again!

82
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,800
Lu Yan.

83
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:25,600
Trust me.

84
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,759
I will protect myself well.

85
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:30,120
Lu Yan.

86
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,439
You can only save me if you leave.

87
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:35,199
Trust me.

88
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,959
You should go.

89
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,920
You satisfied now?

90
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:25,160
Let go of me.

91
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:28,199
During these ten years,

92
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,759
I have lived in fear every day.

93
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,879
Never dared to spend a night
with a woman.

94
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:35,279
Because I fear one slip in my sleep

95
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:36,600
will cost me everything.

96
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,519
You know what?

97
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:42,360
I can only live on fantasies.

98
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,720
I get satisfaction from fantasies.

99
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,800
Mu Lan.

100
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,079
Be obedient.

101
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,360
That way,

102
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,279
Liang Xiao will suffer less.

103
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:08,480
Look.

104
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:10,439
Aren't they beautiful?

105
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,680
I think we are really a great match.

106
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,399
But I still feel a little regret.

107
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:23,839
That is,

108
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,000
if you want revenge,

109
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,079
you should do it earlier.

110
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,879
Why do you work with Lu Yan?

111
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:30,759
If it weren't for him,

112
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,639
just you and me,

113
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:35,279
would we have been together?

114
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:36,200
Shut up.

115
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:06,240
Remember to attend my wedding tomorrow.

116
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,879
