00:00:06,228 --> 00:00:10,449
=Accidental Firing=

2
00:00:10,881 --> 00:00:13,403
=Episode 8=

3
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:17,480
Mu Lan.

4
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:20,120
You got drunk so quickly.

5
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:21,559
I'll take you to rest.

6
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:26,960
Slow down.

7
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:54,159
What's wrong?

8
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:55,840
Mr. Lu. Young Master Lu.

9
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:58,039
What on earth is happening?

10
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,000
Yan,

11
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:01,159
why did you throw such a tantrum

12
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,560
and kick the door?

13
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,280
I simply brought your mother in to rest.

14
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,200
Young Master Lu,

15
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:08,480
you haven't taken a fancy
to Miss Mu, right?

16
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:10,760
She is the woman your father will marry.

17
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,200
You mustn't lose your mind.

18
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:14,719
Mr. Ling, I'm afraid it's too late.

19
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,799
They looked like a couple on the street.

20
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:18,719
There's definitely something
between them.

21
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,519
Exactly.

22
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,319
Do you have

23
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,760
an affair with your stepmother?

24
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,760
Mr. Lu treats you well.

25
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,560
How can you?

26
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,319
Please answer our question directly.

27
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,079
That's right.

28
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:29,480
Young Master Lu, please answer.

29
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:31,280
(The son covets his stepmother)

30
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,359
(and falls out with his own father.)

31
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:36,239
(When the news spreads citywide,)

32
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:38,280
(it'll only be a matter of course)

33
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:40,120
(for me to "clean house.")

34
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:41,920
(This dinner party)

35
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,319
(is a trap he set up
for Lu Yan using me.)

36
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,640
Ten years ago,

37
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,680
I lost a girl.

38
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,799
That's my eternal pain.

39
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,079
I can't let that happen again.

40
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,079
Come here.

41
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,159
There's no one here.

42
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:05,400
Where is Miss Mu?

43
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,000
Shouldn't Miss Mu be here?

44
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:07,799
(Where is she?)

45
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,800
Nobody. She's not here.

46
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:12,360
Where is Miss Mu?

47
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,159
I don't see her.

48
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,199
She isn't here.

49
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,080
She isn't.

50
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,000
No one is here.

51
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,199
Stop.

52
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,280
It's a fact that you broke the door.

53
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,000
I am still alive.

54
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,639
You unfilial son!

55
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:54,479
Are you okay?

56
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,599
I'm fine.

57
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:00,919
Just speak your mind.

58
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,639
What is that expression?

59
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,599
What expression?

60
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:10,439
You look very smug to me.

61
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,520
You ran out of the lounge.

62
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,319
Were you worried about me?

63
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:17,120
Stop flattering yourself.

64
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,759
You were.

65
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:30,319
Ten years ago, I lost a girl.

66
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,960
That's my eternal pain.

67
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,840
I can't let that happen again.

68
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:43,280
I was worried you'd get in my way.

69
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,240
Thank you.

70
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,560
No matter what the reason was.

71
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,240
Alright, let's get down to business.

72
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:27,399
Mu Lan,

73
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,600
we have the same goal.

74
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,480
There's no doubt about it.

75
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:31,920
So?

76
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,000
Leave it to me.

77
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,279
You need to do nothing.

78
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,079
That man is very dangerous.

79
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,240
Lu Yan,

80
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,519
you must have been busy
these past ten years.

81
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,639
Why not give me what you've found?

82
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,439
So I won't have to approach him.

83
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,240
No.

84
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,160
What did you say?

85
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:47,959
Do you think he knows nothing?

86
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:50,439
Do you think things will go as you wish?

87
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,000
If you do this,

88
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:55,079
you will only put yourself in danger.

89
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,240
I'm back, unafraid.

90
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,399
Then you will die

91
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,959
and die worthlessly.

92
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:05,639
Zhu.

93
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,360
I can't lose you again.

94
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,360
You already

95
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,079
lost me ten years ago.

96
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,759
She managed to escape!

97
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,800
I should have just knocked her out.

98
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,560
Mr. Lu,

99
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:36,279
Miss Mu is waiting for you outside.

100
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,360
I didn't expect her
to dare to come back.

101
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,120
It's getting more and more interesting.

102
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:55,680
You're too polite, Mr. Lin.

103
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,519
I will need your help in the future.

104
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,680
Stop.

105
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,480
I am still alive.

106
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,600
You unfilial son!

107
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,439
Lu Yan,

108
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:33,920
I have let you live for too long.

109
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,199
Miss Mu.

110
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:45,720
Mr. Lu.

111
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,879
Do you remember what you said when you

112
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:48,879
proposed cooperation?

113
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,319
(Since your man)

114
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:53,040
(couldn't get it to you,)

115
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,319
you might as well choose me.

116
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,600
What do you want?

117
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,480
Money.

118
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,680
What?

119
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,680
Are you about to make a big deal?

120
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:03,439
Come.

121
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,759
Let's go and see together.

122
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,560
Alright.

123
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:16,839
Young Master,

124
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,399
that man took Miss Mu away.

125
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,000
Mr. Lu,

126
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:25,000
why have we come so far today?

127
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,240
This spot is great for striking deals.

128
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,480
Search around here thoroughly.

129
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,199
Yes.

130
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,199
Mr. Lu,

131
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,120
are we really talking business here?

132
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,199
Yes.

133
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,720
Just here.

134
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:57,079
Miss Mu, what's wrong?

135
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:58,720
Is there a problem?

136
00:07:59,240 --> 00:07:59,759
No.

137
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,920
Money-making deals
can be made anywhere.

138
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,079
(Our deal)

139
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,399
(was to get rid of Lu Yan.)

140
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,720
(But he's still alive.)

141
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,480
(In this case,)

142
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,879
(I'll have to do it myself.)

143
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,319
Mu Lan!

144
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:23,199
Don't harm her. I'm warning you.

145
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:24,839
Don't harm her.

146
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,120
How could I possibly harm Mu Lan?

147
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:32,320
She is the first woman in my life

148
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,480
that I want to marry.
