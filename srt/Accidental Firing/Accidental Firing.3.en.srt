00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,641
=Accidental Firing=

2
00:00:11,073 --> 00:00:13,595
=Episode 3=

3
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,480
But you still haven't told me

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,839
how this letter

5
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,679
got into your hands.

6
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:27,160
When I was on the train,
I saw someone else.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,759
Young Master Lu.

8
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,159
Yan,

9
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:54,799
what happened?

10
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:58,640
This woman is very dangerous.

11
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,359
Is there some misunderstanding?

12
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:15,799
She even dares to sow discord
between my son and me.

13
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:20,560
This woman is really interesting.

14
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:24,799
I gave the evidence to Mr. Lu.

15
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:25,959
Being after me won't help.

16
00:01:27,496 --> 00:01:28,159
(This afternoon,
Lu Yan will be in the western suburbs.)

17
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:28,920
You wrote this, right?

18
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,319
Words alone are no proof.

19
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,319
Governor,

20
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:36,840
you can't wrong me.

21
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,280
We fought on the train.

22
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,840
The scent on you that day

23
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,840
and the current one

24
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:06,959
are exactly the same as on this note.

25
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:12,639
Your evidence

26
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:14,800
is really ingenious.

27
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,560
(Xiao?)

28
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,319
Whether to repay my rescue

29
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,599
or for my injury today because of you,

30
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,599
you should take responsibility.

31
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:40,719
Let go.

32
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:42,800
Treat my wound.

33
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,879
(I must quickly find Xiao.)

34
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:09,919
How did you know

35
00:03:10,112 --> 00:03:11,719
I'd be in the western suburbs?

36
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:17,560
Governor, you are really persistent.

37
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,560
Do you know Zhu?

38
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,759
Or

39
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:28,639
are you Zhu?

40
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,400
You're not dead?

41
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:43,599
I am Mu Lan. Who is Zhu?

42
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:47,199
I've been looking for her.

43
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,319
When I was young,

44
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,599
my parents were busy.

45
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,360
It was Ms. Wang,
Zhu's mother, who raised me.

46
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,919
Only Zhu was always with me.

47
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,240
I liked her very much.

48
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,159
We went to the western suburbs
to take a photo and bury it

49
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,439
under a tree.

50
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:11,719
We promised to dig it out together

51
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,919
today, ten years later.

52
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,960
In these ten years,

53
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,240
I have been thinking about this day

54
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,120
and Zhu all the time.

55
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:32,279
It's really touching.

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,079
Are you Zhu or not?

57
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:36,360
Only Zhu and I know

58
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:38,079
about the western suburbs.

59
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,800
Enough.

60
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,720
I can't cure your lovesickness.

61
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,079
You should leave.

62
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,839
I will repay this favor.

63
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,800
Let's bury the photo

64
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,639
and dig it up again ten years from now.

65
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,199
Ten years?

66
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:12,879
Will the photo still be there
in ten years?

67
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,720
Definitely

68
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,279
If it's here after ten years,

69
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,399
I will marry you.

70
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,800
Then I better dig it deeper.

71
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,720
Mr. Lu, Zhao Debiao ambushed Lu Yan
in the western suburbs.

72
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:35,759
He acted so quickly.

73
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,680
This woman is very dangerous.

74
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,279
So it was Mu Lan's doing.

75
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,759
(Using Anhe Industry as bait,)

76
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:51,879
(not only did I lure Lu Yan
from his station to Haicheng,)

77
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,000
(but I also provoked Zhao Debiao)

78
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:57,720
(and acquired Mu Lan,
a charming yet dangerous blade.)

79
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,680
(It's three kills with one stone.)

80
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:03,519
Find out more about Mu Lan.

81
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:04,800
Okay.

82
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,920
You're still up this late.

83
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,800
Are you waiting to report to me?

84
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,560
Tell me.

85
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:38,079
What did you say to Miss Mu?

86
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,759
I'm a bit tired.

87
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:43,800
You want a massage?

88
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,480
You're smuggling arms.

89
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:57,000
How dare you engage
in such a dangerous business?

90
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,040
That's because

91
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,560
I have you, a good son and a governor.

92
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:02,959
If you dare
damage my father's reputation,

93
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,639
I will make you disappear
without hesitation.

94
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,240
As long as you are filial to me,

95
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,600
that kind of thing will never happen.

96
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,040
Our family

97
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,560
will only prosper for a long time.

98
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,879
You don't really think

99
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,439
I came back for Anhe Industry, do you?

100
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,120
Sister.

101
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,639
I've been wearing it.

102
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:13,959
There's no anesthesia. Hold on.

103
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,759
Sister,

104
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:24,160
how did you know I was here?

105
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:26,000
You know why.

106
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,000
Press it.

107
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:34,240
This was the place where we first met

108
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,120
when we were kids.

109
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,519
Later,

110
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,039
we often looked at the stars here

111
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,279
and listened

112
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,840
to the wind.

113
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,600
I promised you I would wear it,

114
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,360
and you promised me

115
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:48,200
you would disappear from my life.

116
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:51,080
I did it, but you broke your promise.

117
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:53,120
Why won't you let me stay?

118
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:55,240
That dart will expose you.

119
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,519
Leave Haicheng immediately.

120
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,080
Or I will throw the necklace away.

121
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:01,120
You know what that means.

122
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,279
Let go.

123
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,080
Coming.

124
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:47,480
Mr. Lu.

125
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:48,960
Miss Mu.

126
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,320
Mr. Lu,

127
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,480
are you here to accept my proposal?

128
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,799
Of course, I can agree to your request.

129
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,399
But I'm still a little worried
about you.

130
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,240
Mr. Lu,

131
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,840
what should I do to ease your worries?

132
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:18,080
If it weren't for that accident,

133
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:19,399
that letter

134
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:20,840
would have been delivered to me.

135
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:23,120
But there was an accident.

136
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:24,720
Miss Mu,

137
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,000
if you hope

138
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,879
our future cooperation goes smoothly,

139
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:31,639
you need
to make that accident disappear.

140
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:33,480
Accident?

141
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:35,279
That accident

142
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:39,200
said you're very dangerous.

143
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,960
This woman

144
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,120
is very dangerous.

145
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,440
