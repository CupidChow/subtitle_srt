=Episode 7=

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,480
Mu Lan!

4
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,039
Miss Ling.

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,039
You shameless woman.

6
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:22,440
If you hadn't exploited the loophole,

7
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:24,000
Changhe would have been mine,

8
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:26,199
and you wouldn't flaunt
before me every day.

9
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:28,039
Miss Ling.

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,039
Shut up...

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,120
Ling Yao,

12
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,280
you've gotten used
to being a noble lady.

13
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:34,719
You've never met anyone like me.

14
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,039
I fear nothing since I have nothing.

15
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:38,359
Don't provoke me.

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,320
If anything happens to me,

17
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:42,280
you can forget about living.

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,159
Really,

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,759
Miss Ling?

20
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:49,824
You were behind the attacker
and the aphrodisiac, right?

21
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:53,240
I won't dare again.

22
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,560
I won't dare ever again.

23
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:57,240
Mind your own business from now on

24
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,920
and behave like a young lady.

25
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,319
This is not over.

26
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,680
Why are you staring?

27
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,560
You're good-looking.

28
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:42,840
Does it hurt?

29
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,879
Why are you following me
instead of Xiao?

30
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,120
If it weren't for you,

31
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,000
I wouldn't even glance at him.

32
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,560
This isn't a place you should be.

33
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,840
Don't you have many things to do?

34
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,959
I won't neglect a single thing
I should do.

35
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,560
Lu Yan,

36
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,919
we shouldn't be walking
on the street together.

37
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:15,439
If your father finds out,
I can't explain.

38
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:17,199
It's okay. I can explain.

39
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:21,479
Why are you working with Xiao?

40
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:23,360
Liang Xiao is a time bomb.

41
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,800
With him around,
you're always in danger.

42
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,240
It's not cooperation.

43
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:28,719
It's to control him.

44
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,159
You meddle too much.

45
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:35,479
Sir.

46
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:36,560
Sir,

47
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:39,280
buy a flower for this beautiful lady.

48
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,159
I'll take them all.

49
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:49,439
Thank you, Sir.

50
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,599
Thank you, Lady.

51
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:55,800
Take these.

52
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,680
You bought them.

53
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,759
Why should I take them?

54
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:01,400
They're for you.

55
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,719
No, thanks.

56
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,919
Just chuck them.

57
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:14,680
I don't want them.

58
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:44,199
Go back to the company.

59
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,080
Okay.

60
00:03:48,724 --> 00:03:50,657
(Republic of China currency)

61
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,759
Hello, this is Li Tian.

62
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,360
Mr. Lu,

63
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:06,120
I still couldn't find anything.

64
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:07,560
That woman

65
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,840
managed to appear
without leaving any traces

66
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,840
and approach me.

67
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,759
In my opinion, just kill her.

68
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,040
It'll end all.

69
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,680
Kill her.

70
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,600
Kill her!

71
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,160
But not yet.

72
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,759
We need to do it neatly.

73
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,319
Someone must be behind her.

74
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:25,199
Keep looking.

75
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:26,319
Okay.

76
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,079
And Liang Xiao.

77
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:31,920
Check him too.

78
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,160
Okay.

79
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:49,040
Yan.

80
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,279
There's a charity party tomorrow night.

81
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:54,800
Come with me.

82
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:03,120
Sure.

83
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,079
Tomorrow night,

84
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:06,120
the big names, reporters,
and community leaders

85
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:07,800
of Haicheng are all coming.

86
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,079
Don't embarrass me.

87
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:16,560
Miss Mu.

88
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,319
Mr. Lu.

89
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:22,439
Yan, how do I look?

90
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,120
Since Miss Mu came,

91
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:26,439
don't I look younger?

92
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:28,600
Playing human too long,

93
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:31,560
you don't really think
you are a human being, do you?

94
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,480
(Playing human too long?)

95
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,759
He is not my father.

96
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,240
He is just a vicious criminal

97
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:42,279
who looks like my father.

98
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,120
Miss Mu,

99
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,439
if you hope

100
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:46,199
our future cooperation goes smoothly,

101
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:48,920
you need
to make that accident disappear.

102
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,800
Look at you.

103
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:53,319
Evil spirit possessed you?

104
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,399
Miss Mu,

105
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,680
there is a charity party tomorrow night.

106
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,879
I would like to invite you
to attend with me.

107
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,600
Sure.

108
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,519
Okay.

109
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,320
I have things to do.

110
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:08,839
I'm leaving.

111
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:16,879
After the party,

112
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,279
meet me at the gate.

113
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:26,675
(Paradise)

114
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,000
Mr. Lu is here.

115
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:30,040
Mr. Lu.

116
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,319
Miss...

117
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,160
It's Mrs. Lu.

118
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,399
Mrs. Lu.

119
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:35,000
And Young Master Lu.

120
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:36,959
Your presence

121
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,519
is truly the greatest support

122
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,759
for our charity party.

123
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,399
Young Master Lu,

124
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,800
I have some matters

125
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,000
that Mr. Lu specifically instructed me

126
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,480
to consult with you on.

127
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,480
This way, please.

128
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,360
Mr. Lu, how have you been?

129
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:57,040
Not bad.

130
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,240
Mrs. Lu, I toast to you.

131
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,240
Come on. Together.

132
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,040
Lu Yan needs your support

133
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,000
in Haicheng later.

134
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:11,920
Pleasure.

135
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,759
Yes.

136
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,600
Mr. Lu, you're really a lucky man.

137
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:25,600
(What's going on?)

138
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:26,439
Mu Lan,

139
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,560
is this wine good?

140
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:34,959
What's wrong?

141
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:36,279
It's nothing.

142
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:37,720
I need powder.

143
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:38,839
Excuse me.

144
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,160
Excuse me.

145
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,720
Excuse me.

146
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,040
Okay.

147
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,519
Single for ten years.

148
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,839
Mr. Lu has finally found his beloved.

149
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:59,240
It's just a pity for my granddaughter.

150
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,560
Mu Lan.

151
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:15,000
You got drunk so quickly.

152
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,439
I'll take you to rest.

153
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:21,800
