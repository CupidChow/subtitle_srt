3
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:15,640
Don't you think you're strange lately?

4
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:20,920
Strange?

5
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:22,239
Where?

6
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:24,399
Just...

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,839
You've changed.

8
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:28,359
Changed?

9
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,600
How?

10
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:36,439
Not like this anymore?

11
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:44,439
Or this?

12
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,599
Shameless.

13
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,959
I just don't want to.

14
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,280
I cling to you every day,

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,239
don't you feel annoyed?

16
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:31,439
No, I don't.

17
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:43,120
Sister.

18
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,560

I

want to eat steak.

43
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,280
Is it that delicious?

44
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:36,919
Yes.

45
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,479
I also made it for Xiao before.

46
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,080
He thought it was overcooked.

47
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:57,840
You're right.

48
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,520
I've been quite strange lately.

49
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,479
I don't like Liang Xiao.

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,199
I can tell.

51
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,039
Do you know why?

52
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,479
His look at you

53
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:16,360
is just like mine.

54
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:19,160
He's my brother.

55
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,240
We were together...

56
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,480
Are you explaining to me

57
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,800
or brainwashing yourself?

58
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:30,920
Mu Lan.

59
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,600
You're a clever woman.

60
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,120
You really can't see

61
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:35,480
Liang Xiao's feelings for you?

62
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:38,040
Or you know it well.

63
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:40,600
But to spare your sibling bond

64
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,240
and him,

65
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,160
you tolerate

66
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,040
his overstepping?

67
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:55,560
Right.

68
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:56,920
I am a bit strange.

69
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:58,519
Because I am angry.

70
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,560
I am angry at Liang Xiao, at you,

71
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,240
even at myself.

72
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,360
I'm so angry,

73
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,560
because I don't even have the right to.

74
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,079
Mu Lan,

75
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,240
I really want to ask you a question.

76
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,240
What exactly

77
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,920
are your feelings for me?

78
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:22,360
Okay.

79
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:24,360
I'll go first.

80
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:38,959
I like you.

81
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,560
Mu Lan.

82
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,639
In the past,

83
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,800
I've never clearly said this.

84
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,279
But today I want to tell you plainly.

85
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,920
I like you.

86
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:52,000
Mu Lan.

87
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:53,839
Do you like me?

88
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:57,439
I...

89
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,199
I can't think about this right now.

90
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:03,959
My mind is a mess.

91
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:04,600
I...

92
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,399
I like you.

93
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,639
Mu Lan.

94
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:17,600
I am more honest

95
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,199
and braver than you.

96
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,720
What is so urgent?

97
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:41,759
Son is after stepmom,

98
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:42,800
and frames Dad.

99
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:44,639
Young Master, Dong Lin has fought back.

100
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,399
Things are not looking good.

101
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:49,560
In the end,

102
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,120
the Lu family has
become a laughingstock.

103
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,000
Young Master.

104
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:54,920
If we can open the secret room,

105
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,240
we'll find proof
of Dong Lin replacing Master.

106
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,480
Then, we can handle him.

107
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,800
Don't be sad. I'll leave now.

108
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,680
Sister.

109
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:24,399
We should go.

110
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,800
Let go of me.

111
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,800
Ten years.

112
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,279
I've protected her for ten years.

113
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,120
Who are you?

114
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:48,519
Liang Xiao.

115
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,240
The reason I tolerate you

116
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,279
is because I see you as her brother.

117
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:54,279
How dare you define our relationship?

118
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:55,000
Xiao.

119
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,319
You haven't changed at all.

120
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,360
You promised not to rush.

121
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:12,079
Think about it carefully.

122
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:17,000
Sister.

123
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:19,680
You promised me you wouldn't abandon me.

124
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,800
I did.

125
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:23,199
But you didn't keep yours
from the beginning.

126
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:24,959
What's more, I told you,

127
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,120
we are siblings.

128
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,639
We can only be siblings.

129
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,600
It's fake.

130
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,040
I don't believe it.

131
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,080
If you're worried,

132
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,600
I'll keep an eye on him.
