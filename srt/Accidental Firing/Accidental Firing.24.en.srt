00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,239
Brother. Brother.

4
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:26,239
Does Xiao want to see me?

5
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,519
He's been hospitalized again

6
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:28,760
due to old injuries.

7
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,039
What if something happens to him?

8
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:34,679
Brother, listen to me.

9
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,359
You can't go now.

10
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,880
This is Lu Yan's trap.

11
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,000
If you go now,
it's like going to your death.

12
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:40,520
Brother.

13
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,479
No one can stop me from seeing my son.

14
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:43,960
You can't go.

15
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,679
You can't go.

16
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,759
As long as you are here,

17
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,359
we can make a comeback.

18
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:51,320
Then you'll just need to say it,

19
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:53,359
if you want to see Liang Xiao.

20
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:54,920
I have to go now.

21
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:56,840
You can't go.

22
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,000
This is Lu Yan's scheme.

23
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:03,079
You won't see Liang Xiao.

24
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,239
Why won't you listen to me?

25
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:10,760
No.

26
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,159
No.

27
00:01:16,564 --> 00:01:18,400
(Silence)

28
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,400
Dong Lin, we meet again.

29
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,359
Let me see Liang Xiao.

30
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,040
Please.

31
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,040
You want to see him?

32
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:25,760
He has suffered so much with you

33
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:27,560
that he almost died.

34
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:29,719
You do have the nerve
to want to see him.

35
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,560
Xiao.

36
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:32,120
Xiao.

37
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,319
Xiao.

38
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:35,120
Come out and see me.

39
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:36,480
Xiao,

40
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:37,920
come and see your dad.

41
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,319
Xiao.

42
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:40,599
Xiao.

43
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:42,560
Come and see me.

44
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,840
I'm sorry to you,

45
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:46,040
Xiao.

46
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:48,319
If you're sorry, just go die.

47
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,879
I'm so happy

48
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,239
to have you as my son.

49
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,680
Shut up.

50
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:03,920
Come with me, okay?

51
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:06,799
Shut up!

52
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,800
Give me one more chance.

53
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,240
I told you to shut up!

54
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,039
You and I are really alike.

55
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,759
You look a lot like me when you smile.

56
00:02:58,483 --> 00:03:01,237
(Silence)

57
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:42,840
How is he?

58
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:46,319
Xiao's mom died of illness

59
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,520
when he was 6.

60
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,719
His uncle treated him fairly well,

61
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,919
but his aunt abused him in all ways.

62
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,280
When I met him,

63
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:55,520
he was only 10,

64
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:57,800
but had been wandering for four years.

65
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,520
He was extremely thin

66
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,319
and was running a fever.

67
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,840
He was like a frightened bird.

68
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,759
This incident is a huge blow to him.

69
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,800
It's no less than the four dark years

70
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,879
after his mother died.

71
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,560
But such a child

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
held me back tightly when I witnessed

73
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,639
my mom being killed.

74
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,800
If it weren't for him,

75
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:23,680
I would've died long ago.

76
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,800
Young Master,
Li Tian has brought people in.

77
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,800
Liang Xiao, protect Mu Lan.

78
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:48,360
No.

79
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:50,839
Don't worry.

80
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:54,759
Li Tian is desperate now.

81
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,920
I need to help Lu Yan.

82
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,720
Sister,

83
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,319
I know how much Lu Yan means to you.

84
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:00,519
So I won't

85
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,240
let anything happen to him.

86
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,800
Trust me.

87
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,279
Brother.

88
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,720
Never leave her side.

Can I call you Sister now?

97
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,759
Just Sister.
