=Accidental Firing=

2
00:00:10,816 --> 00:00:13,338
=Episode 11=

3
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:20,600
Chairman Lu.

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,239
Biao, sit.

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,199
Yesterday,

6
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,239
I saw an anonymous letter at your door.

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,879
Worried that others would take it,

8
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:31,760
so I slipped it through your door.

9
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:32,439
Alright.

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,799
I'll check it later.

11
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:36,159
This is today's newspaper.

12
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:37,240
Here you are.

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,840
I'll leave now.

14
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:50,240
Useless!

15
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,079
Not thinking about how to kill Lu Yan,

16
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,759
doing the pointless stuff.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,679
Forget it.

18
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,560
It's best he can make it.

19
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,000
Or, I won't let Lu Yan live.

20
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:03,039
At that time,

21
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,599
Biao,

22
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:07,599
you'd be the perfect scapegoat.

23
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:21,640
(Where is the anonymous letter)

24
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,280
(Zhao Debiao mentioned?)

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,519
Mr. Lu.

26
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,040
We got Liang Xiao's identity.

27
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,519
A paralyzed father, a mad mother,

28
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,840
and no siblings.

29
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:34,760
(Employee visit list)
Nothing unusual.

30
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,439
Why is it with you?

31
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:39,519
Where's Li?

32
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,040
He was missing since yesterday.

33
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:42,920
His family has reported it
to the police.

34
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:45,680
What's wrong?

35
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,640
Someone broke into my office.

36
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,359
Manager Li probably saw it

37
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:53,959
and got silenced.

38
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,760
Mr. Lu.

39
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:57,200
Could it be Mu Lan?

40
00:01:58,879 --> 00:01:59,799
Did you find anything?

41
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,120
Nothing.

42
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,879
It's like she came out of thin air.

43
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:06,599
She cleaned up her past so clean.

44
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,400
What deep grudge does she have?

45
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,719
Could it be her?

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,280
Mr. Lu, who is it?

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,759
Don't ask.

48
00:02:39,136 --> 00:02:43,783
(Employee visit list, 1st, Liang Xiao)

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,840
(Get supplies at Xinghuo)
Isn't this

50
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:48,840
when Mu Lan led Lu Yan to the bridge?

51
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:52,879
Xinghuo is just across the bridge.

52
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,000
Could it be Liang Xiao?

53
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,960
Did he do it for Mu Lan?

54
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,240
It's my failure.

55
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:18,599
I'll send people now

56
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,479
to kill him secretly.

57
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:21,280
Wait.

58
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,599
If Liang Xiao dies just like that,

59
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,680
it would be a waste.

60
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,800
You know the things
between men and women.

61
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,759
If Liang Xiao sees Mu Lan and Lu Yan...

62
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,120
I'll show you a good show later.

63
00:03:44,212 --> 00:03:45,152
(Mu Lan's wedding day)

64
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:49,159
Darn Mu Lan.

65
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:49,800
Darn Mu Lan.

66
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,000
Darn!

67
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:56,439
Hello?

68
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,360
Changhe.

69
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,199
Okay.

70
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:02,240
Okay.

71
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,800
I'll come over right now.

72
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:16,720
Are you Miss Ling?

73
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,040
I am. Who are you?

74
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,319
I am an employee of Anhe Industry.

75
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,199
Chairman had something come up.

76
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,680
He sent me to treat you.

77
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,519
Alright.

78
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,560
What do you think
Ling Yao will say to him?

79
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,079
It must be interesting.

80
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,439
Mr. Lu.

81
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,639
Should we stir things up a bit more?

82
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:47,600
No need.

83
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,439
Imagination is more destructive.

84
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:56,680
Why hasn't Changhe come back yet?

85
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,279
Where did Changhe go?

86
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,480
Was he called away by that Mu Lan?

87
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,160
He didn't mention that.

88
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,800
Just let me entertain you.

89
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,720
You?

90
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,720
Who do you think you are?

91
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,360
Go find Changhe back,

92
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,480
and I'll let this slide.

93
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,720
Otherwise, I'll kill you!

94
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,519
Why standing there?

95
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:22,040
Go now!

96
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:28,040
He must be called away

97
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,160
by that wrench.

98
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,160
I even saw her and Lu Yan kissing,

99
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,319
stripping like crazy.

100
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,199
If I had caught them in bed,

101
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,800
I wouldn't be like this today.

102
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,199
What did you say?

103
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:44,319
What's it got to do with you?

104
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:45,839
Why are you dawdling?

105
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,720
Hurry up and go!

106
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:56,560
(I even saw her and Lu Yan kissing,)

107
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:59,879
(stripping like crazy.)

108
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,759
(If I had caught them in bed,)

109
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:05,199
(I wouldn't be like this today.)

110
00:06:29,317 --> 00:06:30,272
(Public phone booth)

111
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:38,800
Mu Lan.

112
00:07:05,651 --> 00:07:06,848
(Public phone booth)

113
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,360
Liang Xiao.

114
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:16,720
Do something for me.

115
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,600
Chairman Lu.

116
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,439
I made an appointment with Miss Ling.

117
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,079
She will be here in five minutes.

118
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,879
But I have something to deal with now.

119
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,800
Help pick her up?

120
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,199
Okay, Chairman.

121
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,560
Take her to my office.

122
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,240
(The file room isn't
by the road to the office.)

123
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,480
(He knew my connection with my sister.)

124
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,279
(Provoke me with Ling Yao)

125
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,680
(and let me kill Lu Yan.)

126
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,720
(I can't trust)

127
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:44,399
(what Ling Yao says now.)

128
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,399
(Lu Yan.)

129
00:07:56,979 --> 00:07:57,952
(The Lu family tablets)

130
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,360
There's nothing wrong.

131
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:24,519
I've already checked it.

132
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:28,480
But there's a dent here.

133
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,600
I think it's suspicious.

134
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:49,480
Stop!

135
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:05,399
It's done.

136
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,440
