=Episode 6=

3
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:18,719
Sister.

4
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:19,160
You...

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,719
Listen to me first.

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,640
What?

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,719
I did promise you

8
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,119
I'd disappear from your life forever.

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,200
But I can't do it.

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,000
So, you've been following me.

11
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,880
Yes. I know you don't
want people to find me.

12
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:39,840
So...

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,960
I roamed for two years
to erase your traces.

14
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:42,960
Why didn't you listen?

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,799
Any idea how many eyes are on me now?

16
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,399
I miss you, and I want to help you.

17
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,600
Why pushed me away?

18
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,359
What did I do wrong?

19
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:50,479
I don't need you.

20
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:51,719
Leave Haicheng now.

21
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,000
I won't leave.

22
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,560
I know you want to approach Lu Changhe.

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,399
If I become his follower,

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I can help you.

25
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:00,920
I will be very careful.

26
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:31,680
Mr. Lu.

27
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,239
Young Master Lu.

28
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:34,879
You two...

29
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:36,359
I said I can come by myself.

30
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:38,280
But Yan was worried.

31
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:40,120
He insisted on coming too.

32
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,120
Let's go.

33
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:57,680
(It's him.)

34
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:00,799
Are you alright?

35
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,359
I'm fine.

36
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,840
What's your name?

37
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:08,840
Liang Xiao.

38
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:11,000
You're quite skilled.

39
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,439
How should I thank you?

40
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,759
I don't want anything.

41
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,360
I came here to see you, Mr. Lu.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,560
I want to work at Anhe Industry.

43
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,919
The manager said I need your approval.

44
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,759
No problem.

45
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,439
Go and tell the manager

46
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,599
that I want you

47
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,879
to start working tomorrow.

48
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:26,879
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

49
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:32,439
Miss Mu,

50
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,360
I'll find out
the identity of the attacker

51
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,240
for you.

52
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:39,840
Mr. Lu, someone is making trouble
at the company.

53
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,120
Sorry.

54
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:42,319
I need to take my leave now.

55
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:44,120
It's okay. You go ahead.

56
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:44,800
Yan,

57
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,759
escort your mother back.

58
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,319
I will deal with this body.

59
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:57,479
Why are you looking at me like that?

60
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,840
(What is your relationship
with Liang Xiao?)

61
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:02,719
Let's go.

62
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,000
The Beiyang warlords
disregard the country and the people.

63
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,080
It's certainly hateful.

64
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:11,800
But under the guise of charity,

65
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,800
hypocrites who do devilish deeds

66
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,879
cause more harm.

67
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:20,599
Mr. Ding,

68
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,800
why are you making a scene here?

69
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:26,759
Everyone,

70
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,719
here is the solid evidence

71
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,759
of Lu Changhe colluding
with warlords to smuggle arms

72
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,240
and oppress pioneers
from the last three years.

73
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:36,360
Colluding with warlords to smuggle arms?

74
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:36,680
Guys.

75
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,159
Impossible.

76
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:38,960
Lu Changhe is not a philanthropist.

77
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,719
Anhe Industry is a front
for his illicit gains.

78
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:42,919
How is this possible?

79
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,159
I don't believe it.
He must be slandering.

80
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:46,120
Mr. Ding,

81
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,199
you may not know.

82
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,479
Everyone here

83
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,400
has received my help.

84
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,120
We are all family.

85
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,280
- Indeed.
- Yeah.

86
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,280
And you,

87
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,280
why are you spouting lies at my company?

88
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,520
Everyone knows

89
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,840
Mr. Lu's character very well.

90
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,400
As for you,

91
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,560
you don't look
like a good person at all.

92
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,599
The world is in chaos.

93
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:07,479
You want us to starve?

94
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:08,240
Your evidence

95
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,319
is completely fake.

96
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:11,000
How dare you slander Mr. Lu?

97
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,080
Guys, let's beat him.

98
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:12,840
Beat him.

99
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,920
I absolutely believe
in Mr. Ding's character.

100
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,160
He must have been blinded

101
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,800
by some devils.

102
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,680
He didn't mean it.

103
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,160
Mr. Ding,

104
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,879
if you

105
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,279
need something someday,

106
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:30,959
please be sure to tell me.

107
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,480
I will treat you no less

108
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:38,319
and give my full support to you.

109
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:48,879
How could Mr. Lu be a devil?

110
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,639
You won't be smug for long.

111
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:36,879
Is saving me before Lu Changhe

112
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:38,079
what you call being careful?

113
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,040
- But...
- What if

114
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,240
we get caught?

115
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,439
I will pass the blame to Ling Yao.

116
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,519
Leave Haicheng now.

117
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,279
Now!

118
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,160
Can I speak now?

119
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,120
Go ahead.

120
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,360
First of all,

121
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,480
the attacker had nothing to do with me.

122
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,439
It's a coincidence.

123
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,199
Secondly,

124
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:53,399
you're nervous

125
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,480
because you know me.

126
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,680
But outsiders, including Lu Changhe,

127
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:57,560
will all think

128
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:59,639
I just want to find a job
to make some money.

129
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,600
Finally,

130
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,720
I am really happy

131
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,839
that you worry about me.

132
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:06,120
Is Lu Changhe so easy to fool?

133
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,160
He will believe it.

134
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:08,399
After I came here,

135
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:09,560
I met a friend.

136
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,959
He helped fake my identity.

137
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:14,680
Does it hurt?

138
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,279
Sister,

139
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,360
don't push me away anymore.

140
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,079
In short,

141
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,439
don't act impulsively again.

142
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,279
Discuss everything with me in advance.

143
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,920
What do we do next?

144
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:38,040
Find crime evidence of Lu Changhe
and destroy him.

145
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,800
Lu's mansion and Anhe Industry

146
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,839
are the two most likely hiding places.

147
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:43,800
Leave Anhe Industry to me.

148
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,000
(Xiao,)

149
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:51,399
(I hope after we get revenge,)

150
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:54,959
(we can both get out unscathed.)

151
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:27,279
I don't intend to be your enemy.

152
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,600
Why should I trust you?

153
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,480
Because

154
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,079
I've traced the clues and found you,

155
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,519
and you are still alive.

156
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:35,199
What do you want?

157
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:37,399
Cooperation.

158
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:40,319
Between us.

159
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,959
Let me know whenever you decide.

160
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,959
His father killed your mother.

161
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,040
If he wanted to kill us,

162
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,079
he wouldn't wait till now.

163
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,120
Xiao,

164
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,040
his proposal is worth considering.

165
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,600
Anyway,

166
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,839
we can't act impulsively.

167
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,240
This is Haicheng.

168
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,519
There are eyes everywhere.

169
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,839
We must act with utmost caution.

170
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,160
Go.

171
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,639
I have a plan.

172
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,680
Be good.

173
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,600
No umbrella?

174
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,399
Allow me.

175
00:08:47,284 --> 00:08:49,080
(Paradise)

176
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,679
Mu Lan!

177
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,600
Miss Ling.

178
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:55,519
You shameless woman.

179
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,679
If you hadn't taken advantage of him,

180
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:59,240
Changhe would have been mine,

181
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,480
and you wouldn't flaunt
before me every day.

182
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:03,440
Miss Ling.

183
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,679
Shut up...

184
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,600
Let go of me.
