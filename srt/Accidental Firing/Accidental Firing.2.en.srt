=Episode 2=

3
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,159
Who exactly are you?

4
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,799
A person seeking a living.

5
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:56,479
This new dancer

6
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,679
doesn't know the rules.

7
00:00:57,799 --> 00:00:58,719
How can she...

8
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,400
I'll give you another chance.

9
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:29,640
Hand it over.

10
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,879
Governor,

11
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:32,840
I stripped off for you to check.

12
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,439
What are you still suspicious of?

13
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:44,280
You deserve suspicion.

14
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:47,879
Then I have no other way.

15
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:53,040
I advise you to stay away
from the Lu family.

16
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,560
I don't understand what you are saying.

17
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,519
You'd better do.

18
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:22,879
Thank you all

19
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,000
for coming today
to my son Lu Yan's welcome party.

20
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:29,680
He'll take over Anhe Industry.

21
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,800
Please give him your support
at that time.

22
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,960
Stop!

23
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:47,240
Mr. Wang,

24
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:48,800
please stop.

25
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,280
Drop the act.

26
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:53,680
Stop it, Mr. Wang.

27
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,159
Let go.

28
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:04,840
Let go of me.

29
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,199
Mr. Wang.

30
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,319
You are a person of status.

31
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:23,479
Forcing a dancer wouldn't sound nice

32
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,039
if it got out, would it?

33
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,120
Mr. Lu, you're right.

34
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,039
Then I'll leave you.

35
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,199
Young Master,

36
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,439
sorry about that.

37
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,919
Thank you for your help, Mr. Lu.

38
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:58,439
I'm Mu Lan, and I appreciate it a lot.

39
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,080
You're welcome.

40
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:11,000
Tidy up.

41
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,240
Miss, you dance very well.

42
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,120
Then can I ask you for a favor?

43
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,319
Mr. Lu.

44
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,639
Miss Mu.

45
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,000
This is for you.

46
00:05:12,531 --> 00:05:14,838
(Arms Transaction List)

47
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:42,360
Governor, it seems

48
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,560
you're still not assured of me,
a mere dancer.

49
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,639
You killed his informant

50
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,319
and gave the list to him.

51
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,600
With such trouble,

52
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:06,480
what exactly do you want?

53
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,879
To make money and make a living.

54
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:12,920
Governor,

55
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:15,160
when you become

56
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,800
a prominent figure in Haicheng,

57
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:19,199
I will cater to you like this too.

58
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,959
I don't have time
to beat about the bush.

59
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,079
Leave Haicheng tomorrow.

60
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:34,040
Otherwise,

61
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,959
I will personally send you away.

62
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,360
(You want me to leave so badly?)

63
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,600
(Then I'll send you off first.)

64
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:00,439
Being flirty and wanting to play chaste?

65
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,759
Lu Changhe won't take a fancy
to you, a mere dancer.

66
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,040
Mu Lan,

67
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,600
sooner or later, I'll sleep with you.

68
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,199
Which hand touched her?

69
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:20,079
It's not like that.

70
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,839
Mu Lan asked me to act with her.

71
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:22,720
I didn't.

72
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:25,839
It was Lu Yan

73
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,399
and his father, Lu Changhe.

74
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,160
It was them, not me.

75
00:07:55,955 --> 00:07:58,272
(October 30, Saturday,
the 15th year of the Republic of China)

76
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,639
Take it for self-defense.
The bullets are limited.

77
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,560
How do I practice

78
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:31,759
with so few?

79
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:32,559
I promise you

80
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,720
there will be more bullets for you.

81
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,879
(It's been two years.)

82
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:40,159
(You are still by my side.)

83
00:08:46,995 --> 00:08:49,067
(Lu Changhe's only son, Lu Yan,
takes over Anhe.)

84
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,480
I went out to do some errands.

85
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,440
How come things have completely changed?

86
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:55,799
Chairman Lu,

87
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,240
do you really want
to promote me to vice chairman?

88
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,320
Not just that.

89
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,759
Biao,

90
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,200
as you know, my son

91
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,600
risks his life
on the battlefield every day.

92
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,159
If something happens to him,

93
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,639
you are the best choice
to take over Anhe Industry.

94
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,720
Lu Yan,

95
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:21,399
you deserve to die.

96
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,399
Sir, here you are.

97
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:25,799
Get lost.

98
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:26,759
Take it.

99
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:29,039
Even a brat dares to tease me!

100
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,080
(This afternoon, Lu Yan
will be in the western suburbs.)

101
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:41,840
Wait.

102
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,039
What if it's a trap?

103
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,440
I'll just do it.

104
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,679
(Zhu,)

105
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,840
(I'm back.)

106
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:32,759
Go.

107
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:35,279
Go ahead, you brat.

108
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,039
Come in.

109
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:06,679
Mr. Lu.

110
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,960
How did this letter get into your hands?

111
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,440
If this arms transaction list gets out,

112
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:33,440
it would be disastrous
for you, Anhe Industry,

113
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,639
and the Lu family.

114
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:37,960
It would be no exaggeration
to call it a cataclysm.

115
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,679
Since your people couldn't

116
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:41,120
deliver it to you,

117
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:45,200
you might as well choose me.

118
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,519
I am very sincere.

119
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:45,159
D-Don't kill me.

120
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,919
Say it.

121
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,240
Who told you I would be here today?

122
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,000
(What do you want?)

123
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:00,320
Money.

124
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,000
This proposal is very good.

125
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:10,759
But you still haven't told me

126
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,559
how this letter

127
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:15,679
got into your hands.

128
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:18,200
When I was on the train,

129
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,840
I saw someone else.

130
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,799
