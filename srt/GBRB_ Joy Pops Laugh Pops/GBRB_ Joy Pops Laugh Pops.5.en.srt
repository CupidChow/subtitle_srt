(KKPP International Expedition)

7
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:31,459
It's so tasty.

8
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,759
(From various dishes)

9
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,429
(I see.)

10
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,960
(To a new cultural expedition)

11
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,960
(They enjoyed Mexico City to their hearts' content.)

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,629
Even the trees look different.

13
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,630
(They finally arrived in Cancun, the resort city.)

14
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,540
(They rented a car for a road trip...)

15
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,610
(and began the exciting Cancun expedition!)

16
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,780
(They decided to have the first meal at a ramen place Director picked...)

17
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,179
(or so they thought.)

18
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,500
Aren't we going to a ramen place?

19
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:58,850
We'll drop by this place first.

20
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,620
For goodness' sake. Hold on.

21
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,220
He didn't send us the address of a ramen place.

22
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,889
I mean...

23
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,290
- You caught me.
- Why did you...

24
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,460
- This is unbelievable.
- For goodness' sake.

25
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,199
- Are we going to our hotel?
- Look at this.

26
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,900
It's what he has been wanting to eat.

27
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,770
(A month and a half before leaving for Mexico)

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,340
We tend to do...

29
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:24,609
what Kyung Soo wants us to do...

30
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:26,009
throughout the trip.

31
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:27,180
This time as well,

32
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,780
we'll listen to Kyung Soo's opinions a lot.

33
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,080
When it comes to internet searches,

34
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,350
Director Doh is very good.

35
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,659
I'm talking about restaurants and such.

36
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,529
I've looked things up as well,

37
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:44,600
but the places I found were never better...

38
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,360
than the ones Kyung Soo found.

39
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,530
Kyung Soo is good at it,

40
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,169
so I'll...

41
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:53,600
(I'll trust Kyung Soo.)

42
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,840
(The older members trusted Director to make all food-related decisions.)

43
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,949
(Back to the present)

44
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,579
The further we go on, the more expensive it becomes.

45
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:06,420
(While the older members were renting a car)

46
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,389
I want to try that ceviche.

47
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,990
I'm so curious about it.

48
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,219
- It looks like a local gem.
- It definitely looks like it.

49
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,690
It's only open from 1pm to 6pm.

50
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,499
It's this place.

51
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,700
And our hotel is here.

52
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,800
Judging from the photo, it's bound to be tasty.

53
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,470
Let's eat ceviche as a simple meal...

54
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,339
and drop off our bags at the hotel...

55
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,570
to lessen the load.

56
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,540
Then we can travel light.

57
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,639
I like that idea.

58
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,309
(He came up with a secret plan behind the older members' backs.)

59
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,949
- I'm curious.
- I prefer eating three dishes...

60
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,309
to eating two dishes.

61
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,556
(Thus came a scheme to eat ceviche.)

62
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,249
Will you go eat first or...

63
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,950
We'll go eat first.

64
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,290
Seafood ramen.

65
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,790
- A ramen place?
- Yes.

66
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,250
- Kyung Soo found a place.
- Firstly...

67
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,430
Next to the hotel...

68
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,760
Just get in the car.

69
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,769
(Director's mission)

70
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,839
(Go to the ceviche place without the members' knowledge.)

71
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,869
Then I'll send you...

72
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,039
(Then I'll send you the address of the ceviche place.)

73
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,339
the address.

74
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,710
We're going...

75
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,339
to the restaurant, right?

76
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,479
Here's...

77
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,850
- what we're going to do.
- Okay.

78
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,619
I came up with the perfect plan.

79
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,649
That's really great.

80
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,189
(The perfect plan to fool the older members)

81
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,019
Just press "Directions."

82
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,059
- This one?
- Yes.

83
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,219
- Then press "Start." - Start.

84
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,419
(They don't suspect a thing as they type in the address.)

85
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,729
(Maintaining a poker face so that he doesn't get caught)

86
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,029
- Did they honk?
- Yes.

87
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,506
(Maintaining a poker face so that he doesn't get caught)

88
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,299
- You guys are hungry, right?
- I'm hungry now.

89
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,300
- You guys are hungry, right?
- I'm really hungry.

90
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,829
It's 5pm already.

91
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,769
(They have no idea that they're going to a ceviche place.)

92
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:34,099
(They pass by a McDonald's.)

93
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,169
- You want a drive-thru, right?
- Yes.

94
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,740
I want French fries at a McDonald's.

95
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,616
- I want a soft serve cone.
- Seriously.

96
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,040
A soft serve cone sounds delicious.

97
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:43,509
Let's eat a soft serve cone later.

98
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,580
Let's do that.

99
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,320
(He distracts Kwang Soo so that he won't get caught.)

100
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,359
- Ramen sounds delicious.
- Right?

101
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,596
(It seemed like everything was going as the culinary director's plan.)

102
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,959
(CEO Lee studies something intently.)

103
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,730
What's this? Why are we going here?

104
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,600
Is something here?

105
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,170
We'll go there first.

106
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:04,476
Aren't we going to a ramen place?

107
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,770
We'll drop by this place first.

108
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,410
For goodness' sake. Hold on.

109
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,109
He didn't send us the address of a ramen place.

110
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,210
What?

111
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,180
He's absolutely insane.

112
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:16,749
I mean...

113
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,150
- You caught me.
- Why did you...

114
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,779
- This is unbelievable.
- Where are we going?

115
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,019
- Are we going to our hotel?
- Look at this.

116
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,549
It's what he has been wanting to eat.

117
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,619
There's a reason.

118
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,089
- He wants to eat this before ramen.
- Listen.

119
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,289
We'll drop our bags.

120
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:29,159
We'll check in, drop our bags,

121
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,390
and go to the ramen place.

122
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,300
Why do we need to drop our bags?

123
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,160
- I mean...
- Woo Bin.

124
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,499
The ramen place is very far.

125
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,569
(The 1st reason why they must go)

126
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,899
We're hungry right now.

127
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:39,939
(The 2nd reason why they must go)

128
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,969
I mean...

129
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,569
(There were plausible reasons.)

130
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,980
Once we go back to Korea,

131
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,779
we won't see each other again.

132
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,350
(We won't see each other again.)

133
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,179
This makes no sense.

134
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,756
(Woo Bin announces the end of their friendship.)

135
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,319
We need to drop our bags.

136
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,189
They keep making creaking noises.

137
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,549
Those noises shouldn't get included in the audio.

138
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,119
What are you talking about?

139
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,189
(He blames it on the audio.)

140
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,930
I'm so shocked right now.

141
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,090
Seriously.

142
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,200
I didn't know that Kwang Soo would find it.

143
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,269
He sent us the address to a different place...

144
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,329
and made us go there.

145
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,569
(The older members are incredulous.)

146
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:11,970
How did you find it?

147
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,039
I was so hungry that I went to see the menu.

148
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,110
But it wasn't a ramen place.

149
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,040
Please eat it just once, okay?

150
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,480
I can't believe it.

151
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,889
Am I dreaming?

152
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,620
Am I still sleeping on the plane?

153
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,520
You're sleeping right now.

154
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,389
(CEO Lee checks the menu of the ceviche restaurant.)

155
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,589
Please read it out loud.

156
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,059
(CEO Lee checks the menu of the ceviche restaurant.)

157
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,599
"This place should be much more famous."

158
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,599
"It's small, and its decorations and appearances..."

159
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,170
"aren't very impressive."

160
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:48,110
"But its ceviche is outstanding in its taste and portion size."

161
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,239
Aguachile.

162
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,509
Aguachile is a must.

163
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,339
We should order one ceviche...

164
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,810
and one aguachile.

165
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:58,780
- Two?
- Their empanadas are good too.

166
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,350
But if we eat too much,

167
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,420
we won't be able to eat ramen.

168
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:06,160
We should order that empa something too.

169
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,030
- That empa something.
- There you go again.

170
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:10,659
- If we don't eat it now, - This is insane.

171
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,460
- we'll never eat it.
- Kwang Soo, I think...

172
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,699
you're absorbed right now.

173
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,500
That empa something is pretty small.

174
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,099
(He has become worse than Kyung Soo.)

175
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,740
- Then...
- Let's decide...

176
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:24,980
after we eat ceviche and aguachile.

177
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,709
- Yes. We can order it afterward.
- You know,

178
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,249
these dishes are small.

179
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,409
We can order it if we want more food.

180
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:30,709
We don't have much money.

181
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,220
If we eat that much,

182
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,189
we'll need to starve from tomorrow evening onward.

183
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,719
I know. We might need to eat the remaining meals...

184
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,490
at McDonald's.

185
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,089
I like burgers.

186
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,500
I like them too, to be honest.

187
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,270
We're there.

188
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,029
We'll be there once we turn right.

189
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,299
(They arrive at the ceviche place.)

190
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,569
It doesn't look like a restaurant,

191
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:53,839
- but it is.
- It's a restaurant.

192
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,610
Right? It doesn't look like a restaurant.

193
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,880
I suddenly feel so curious.

194
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,710
The chef got up and turned on the stove...

195
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,180
upon seeing us.

196
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,219
Let's go.

197
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,779
Kyung Soo brought us to a ceviche place...

198
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,820
after telling us that we'd eat ramen.

199
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,049
We were supposed to eat ramen,

200
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,690
but he gave us the address to this place.

201
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,529
We don't have much time. Hurry up.

202
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:16,930
(Shameless)

203
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:18,759
I think he's insane.

204
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,530
No matter how hard I think about it, I don't get it.

205
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,540
If he wants to eat something, he has to eat it.

206
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,340
I think it's a condition.

207
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,480
I don't know how I'm supposed to understand it.

208
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,180
(GBRB: Joy Pops Laugh Pops)

209
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,750
- Hello.
- Hello.

210
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,350
Let's sit down.

211
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:45,160
Should we sit there? We should sit here.

212
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,460
(They sit down.)

213
00:07:46,461 --> 00:07:48,330
What was "Excuse me?"

214
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:50,990
- Disculpe.
- Disculpe.

215
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,330
Disculpe.

216
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,530
(He uses abdominal breathing to call for the owner.)

217
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,670
One ceviche.

218
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,209
Clasi... Classic.

219
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:04,580
Classic, fish, shrimp...

220
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,820
Then there's the mixed ceviche with shrimp and fish.

221
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,880
- Mixed ceviche, please.
- Mixed ceviche. Okay.

222
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,419
- And one aguachile.
- Okay.

223
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,580
Rojo.

224
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,089
- Is that all?
- Yes, that's all.

225
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,490
Mixed ceviche, aguachile rojo.

226
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,189
Let's eat these 2 dishes 1st.

227
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,760
Then we can decide if we want empanadas.

228
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,890
Let's do that.

229
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,830
It doesn't look like a restaurant,

230
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,230
but a house kitchen.

231
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:33,640
This view is...

232
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,670
Mexico in my imagination.

233
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,739
- This vibe.
- Yes.

234
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,779
(The quiet and relaxed scenery of Mexico)

235
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,010
The weather is perfect.

236
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,910
- I think this is a good restaurant.
- Thank you.

237
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,480
- Thank you.
- What was that?

238
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,110
I think this is a good restaurant.

239
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,920
- The ratings are high.
- It looks like...

240
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:51,459
The lady seems to have good cooking skills.

241
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,960
I bet she can cook incredibly well.

242
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,730
She's like a grandma in the neighbourhood.

243
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:59,560
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

244
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,129
(The Coke enthusiast drinks Coke first.)

245
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:04,300
You know...

246
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,039
Coke tastes different.

247
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,169
There are different kinds of ceviche.

248
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:11,940
"Clasico" is the classic kind.

249
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,510
The second one is the Peruvian style.

250
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:16,510
Peruvians eat it that way.

251
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,250
The third one is the Mediterranean style.

252
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,820
- I see.
- I don't know what "Nikkei" is.

253
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,649
They contain different ingredients.

254
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:23,720
I think you're right.

255
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,420
Kwang Soo, aguachile...

256
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:31,660
originated from Sinaloa, Mexico.

257
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,800
It's a spicy seafood dish.

258
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,730
Raw shrimp is mostly used.

259
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,239
Lime juice, chillies, salt, cucumber,

260
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,839
- onion, and cilantro...
- That sounds delicious.

261
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,310
Are mixed to create the spicy and refreshing flavours.

262
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,310
Thus, aguachile is a shrimp dish,

263
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,709
and ceviche is a fish dish.

264
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,280
- I guess so.
- Yes.

265
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,320
(Reading intently)

266
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,490
I see.

267
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,919
(He comes to a realisation.)

268
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,390
All right. Let me explain what "Pescado" means.

269
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,230
It's the option for only fish.

270
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,359
- "Mixto" is...
- Only fish?

271
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,030
Only fish. White fish.

272
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,030
"Mixto" is the option for various seafood.

273
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,340
Fish, shrimp, octopus, and clam.

274
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:13,799
I see.

275
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,170
(The nice members give reactions with enthusiasm.)

276
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,009
It's like ordering sundaeguk with just sundae...

277
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,209
- or intestines as well.
- That's right.

278
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:20,810
- It's the same thing.
- I see.

279
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:24,349
I'll ask about empanadas too.

280
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,190
I'm the type to eat it without the intestines.

281
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,420
Kwang Soo, let's have a quick interview.

282
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:31,020
May I explain what an empanada is?

283
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,359
Go ahead.

284
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,419
(Director is crazy about the food-related explanations.)

285
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,890
Empanada is...

286
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,359
a very popular dish...

287
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,399
What's going on?

288
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,129
- In Latin America.
- He's explaining the dishes.

289
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:41,369
- Mu Seong asked...
- It's...

290
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,769
- for an interview, - a crescent-shaped pie...

291
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:44,030
- but...
- with a filling.

292
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,999
(Be quiet.)

293
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,399
In a dough, ingredients like...

294
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,769
meat, cheese, vegetables, or seafood are added.

295
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:51,010
Then it's folded in half and pan-fried or deep-fried.

296
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:52,739
I think it'll be tasty as well.

297
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,910
(The quick briefing ends.)

298
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:55,910
You can go now.

299
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:59,680
(CEO Lee leaves for an interview.)

300
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,289
How did you feel when you got fooled into coming here?

301
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,190
- What?
- When you got fooled.

302
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:06,059
I was honestly annoyed.

303
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,420
(Laughing)

304
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,801
So many annoying things have happened since this morning.

305
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,730
You know, Woo Bin...

306
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,400
didn't doubt me for a second.

307
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:19,900
"Is this where we need to go?"

308
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,120
He pressed "Directions" and hit the road right away.

309
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:23,740
- Yes.
- No.

310
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:25,180
- Yes.
- No.

311
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,609
- Please.
- I finally see you...

312
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,150
for who you are.

313
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,550
You crazy punk.

314
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,450
For this, I've built up my trust...

315
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,319
among them.

316
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,720
That ends today.

317
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,290
What if this place is tasty?

318
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,860
You turned something off.

319
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,289
What if this place is tasty?

320
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:44,130
- If this place is tasty?
- Will I get a pass?

321
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,759
- Will you forgive me?
- I can't forgive you.

322
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,860
You can't forgive me.

323
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,929
- I received an emotional wound.
- Okay.

324
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:52,400
(A betrayal from a trusted brother has made him sullen.)

325
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,270
I thought they'd never know.

326
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,910
(Disappointed)

327
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,910
I wanted this to happen upon arrival.

328
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,840
"Is this the ramen place?"

329
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:02,949
"That's right. Go on in."

330
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:05,050
I was going to eat ceviche that way.

331
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,820
(While the culinary director talks about his disappointment, )

332
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,620
(the chefs are preparing food for the team in the kitchen.)

333
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:11,719
Her knife skills are insane.

334
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,859
(They go closer to check out the fancy knife skills.)

335
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,060
She's very seasoned.

336
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,060
(They get started on the refreshing sauce.)

337
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,499
(Slicing a red onion)

338
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,170
- It looks so tasty.
- It looks tasty.

339
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,270
It looks tasty.

340
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,310
(The ingredients are mixed in a bowl.)

341
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:33,780
(The aguachile and ceviche are complete.)

342
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,379
I'm so curious about the taste.

343
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,649
(Aguachile is a seafood dish from the coastal region...)

344
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,326
(in Northwestern Mexico as the culinary director explained.)

345
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,850
It looks so tasty.

346
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,649
- It looks good.
- This is aguachile,

347
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:42,750
and this is ceviche.

348
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,749
- This is shrimp.
- It smells good.

349
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,889
- It smells fresh.
- This is mixed.

350
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,020
- Woo Bin, try the ceviche first.
- Okay.

351
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,190
- Get some first.
- Firstly...

352
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,229
- I think this is a tortilla.
- This is too spicy.

353
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,600
- Spicy? Habanero?
- Yes.

354
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,399
It's a chilli sauce.

355
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,470
Habanero sauce.

356
00:12:58,570 --> 00:12:59,999
- I know what it is.
- Salsa.

357
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,070
Cancun's salsa.

358
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,240
Here.

359
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,410
- It's spicy.
- It's...

360
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,009
(He tries it right away.)

361
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,819
- It's different.
- It's different.

362
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,119
- It's totally different.
- It's quite spicy.

363
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,890
- Yes, it's quite spicy.
- Here.

364
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,389
- It's different from Mexico City's.
- Is it different?

365
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,989
- Shall we eat it like this?
- It's much thinner.

366
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,060
It looks tasty.

367
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,420
It's much spicier.

368
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,700
Let's eat it like this.

369
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,600
- It looks so tasty.
- I know.

370
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:30,700
- It smells good.
- Yes.

371
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,000
- Let's go.
- One, two, three.

372
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,840
(The crunchy sound rivals that of an ASMR video.)

373
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,710
- It's tasty.
- It's tasty.

374
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:43,509
So that's what it tastes like.

375
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,610
It's tasty.

376
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,190
We haven't had...

377
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,290
- a refreshing dish like this.
- That's right.

378
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,859
- My goodness.
- Is it good?

379
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,359
- It's so tasty.
- It's the taste...

380
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,459
my body really needs.

381
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,560
- Really?
- That's right.

382
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,659
We haven't had such a dish in 4 days and 3 nights.

383
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,099
When it first entered the mouth,

384
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,370
I thought, "Is it a bit salty?"

385
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,830
But as I ate it,

386
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,840
it became incredibly tasty.

387
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,370
I just needed to chew it.

388
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,840
The texture is incredible.

389
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:13,880
I usually don't eat cilantro.

390
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,610
- It's great, right?
- But this dish needs cilantro.

391
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,350
- I got goosebumps.
- It's good.

392
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,319
I got goosebumps for real.

393
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,819
At first, I thought, "It's sour." But as I chewed it...

394
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,290
- It becomes savoury.
- Yes.

395
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,620
You get different flavours as you chew it.

396
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,089
(Ceviche gives them a variety of flavours.)

397
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,090
It's tasty.

398
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,270
- This one.
- Shall we try this one?

399
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,969
(Next comes aguachile.)

400
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:37,470
I bet this one is sour as well.

401
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,470
Is the taste similar to that of ceviche?

402
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,110
I bet it's in the same category.

403
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,910
- Shall we go?
- One, two, three.

404
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:49,050
(The ASMR time is back.)

405
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,350
(Impressed)

406
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,050
- It's tasty.
- The sauce is different.

407
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:56,650
I like this one better.

408
00:14:56,651 --> 00:14:58,371
- Ceviche is tasty too, but...
- Same here.

409
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,689
This dish reminds me of mulhoe.

410
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:01,690
(Classic ceviche, aguachile)

411
00:15:01,691 --> 00:15:04,660
It suits the Korean taste better.

412
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,860
Aguachile.

413
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,829
I think ceviche is a bit tastier.

414
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,399
Here's what I think.

415
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,840
Aguachile suits the Korean taste better...

416
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,970
because ceviche contains cilantro. It'll be too much for those...

417
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,840
who don't like cilantro.

418
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,879
- But both dishes are very tasty.
- I know.

419
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,839
- I really like this dish.
- I can't eat it with cilantro.

420
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,549
- I agree. It's a must.
- I don't really like cilantro,

421
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,780
- but this dish needs it.
- The harmony is very nice.

422
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,620
Thank goodness the dishes are tasty.

423
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,419
When we eat...

424
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,619
jjamppong with shrimp in Korea,

425
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,320
we save the shrimp for last.

426
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,290
But since there are so many shrimp,

427
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,540
I feel like I'm enjoying a luxurious dish.

428
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,190
- Because there are many shrimp?
- Yes.

429
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,899
- It's so tasty.
- I love that it's spicy.

430
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,970
Yes.

431
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,539
It isn't a meal, but a light snack.

432
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,540
Yes.

433
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,410
- It's an appetizer.
- Yes.

434
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:55,610
If we run a restaurant in Seoul,

435
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,180
we should make something like this.

436
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,020
- You know the milk bread, right?
- Yes.

437
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,019
If we sell it inside such bread, it'll be very tasty.

438
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,719
- That sounds delicious.
- It'll be tastier...

439
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,000
- if the bread is soaked.
- Yes.

440
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,519
(The expedition team found a nice business item.)

441
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,590
That's right.

442
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,490
It's so tasty.

443
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,660
Very tasty!

444
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,730
- Thank you very much.
- Yes.

445
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,899
Mexico's best food.

446
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,999
- Yes?
- Yes.

447
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,639
This is the best ceviche in Cancun.

448
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,839
I see.

449
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,609
I know. We know.

450
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:23,670
Yes.

451
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:27,909
When I searched the place, many people were talking about it.

452
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,410
- Yes.
- Yes.

453
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,610
Us too.

454
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:32,819
- We think that too.
- Thank you.

455
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,020
(The owner and CEO Lee's conversation ends.)

456
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:38,050
(His eyes are fixed on something.)

457
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,090
Those are empanadas.

458
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,489
(They hear an appetizing sound.)

459
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:43,530
Did you order them?

460
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,500
They look delicious too.

461
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,200
They look really delicious.

462
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,869
Think of them as dumplings. Spanish dumplings.

463
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,739
- Fried dumplings?
- Yes, fried dumplings.

464
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,420
We couldn't order it because we were poor.

465
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,700
I want to order 1 and split it among the 3 of us.

466
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,580
- You know...
- Seriously.

467
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:03,349
(The owner appears with empanadas.)

468
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:05,049
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

469
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,380
- Did we order this?
- Empanadas.

470
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,019
Fish and shrimp.

471
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,919
(Confused by the sudden empanadas)

472
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,719
- This is...
- Fish.

473
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,919
Fish,

474
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,089
- and this is...
- Okay.

475
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:17,229
- Shrimp?
- shrimp.

476
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,600
Let's do this.

477
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:19,799
One each.

478
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,769
This is another ceviche.

479
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,099
- What's this?
- It's called nikkei.

480
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,500
The production crew ordered it.

481
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,076
- Thank you.
- Why are they giving it to us?

482
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,269
Who ordered it?

483
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,746
(Even serving ceviche that we didn't order)

484
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:32,239
We're being served food that we didn't order.

485
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,140
Those were empanadas.

486
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,110
Fish and shrimp empanadas.

487
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:40,279
Are they on the house?

488
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,650
- Yes, of course.
- They are on the house.

489
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,620
- On the house?
- Thank you.

490
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,220
Thank you.

491
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:50,829
(The expedition team expresses great appreciation.)

492
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:51,899
Thank you.

493
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,530
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

494
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:55,899
(Moved by the generosity)

495
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,030
Thank you.

496
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:59,340
- How heartwarming.
- For real.

497
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,909
Be careful with your hands.

498
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:04,409
(Freshly fried empanadas)

499
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:05,840
It's real dumplings.

500
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,340
It's similar to fried dumplings.

501
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,570
To think there are dumplings even in Mexico.

502
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,920
Be careful with your hands. It's hot.

503
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,720
(Smelling)

504
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,529
It smells like butter-grilled squid.

505
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:24,530
Really?

506
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,160
- It smells good.
- Right?

507
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,159
- You're right.
- Aren't I?

508
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,669
(Putting it straight into his mouth)

509
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:30,770
Is it not hot?

510
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,400
- Is it not hot?
- It's a little hot.

511
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,769
(Stomping)

512
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,240
It's delicious.

513
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,340
(Impressed)

514
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:45,420
(Nodding out of satisfaction)

515
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:47,050
The filling is incredible.

516
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:50,619
In a way, it might taste similar to fish cutlet.

517
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,749
But it's way better.

518
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,259
Does it taste like fish cutlet?

519
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,559
Because it's deep-fried and the filling has fish inside.

520
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,460
You're right. It reminds you of fish cutlet.

521
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,360
It's really delicious.

522
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,999
It's delicious.

523
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,130
Thank you.

524
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,600
This is the best dish.

525
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:04,770
Is it?

526
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,939
What's this?

527
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,440
(A different ceviche from the traditional one)

528
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,579
I thought it'd be hot, but it's cold.

529
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:15,780
- It's good.
- It smells more of coriander.

530
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,149
And it's less sour.

531
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,419
(Greatly satisfied with the ceviche on the house)

532
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,450
I feel relieved that the food is great.

533
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:26,760
After all, we found this place by coincidence.

534
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,430
(It was a pleasant appetizer.)

535
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,790
Excuse me. Check, please.

536
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,500
Can I use a credit card?

537
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,899
That'll be 410 pesos.

538
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,500
(Around 32.25 dollars)

539
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,270
Can I get a receipt?

540
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,309
The receipt...

541
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,780
- Yes?
- is in WhatsApp.

542
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,109
They only give out digital receipts.

543
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:52,349
(The ceviche place has no physical receipts.)

544
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:54,350
Can I take a photo?

545
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,849
Thank you.

546
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:58,589
(The auditor finds another way to keep the receipt.)

547
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,319
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

548
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,459
- Thank you.
- And...

549
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,559
- this is our...
- Tip.

550
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,659
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

551
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,859
(Tipping to show their gratitude)

552
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,260
El mejor restaurant.

553
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:11,330
(He's trying to say it's the best restaurant.)

554
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,069
Thank you very much.

555
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:15,070
The best restaurant, yes?

556
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,809
He understood.

557
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:18,069
(Wrong pronunciation, but the feeling got across.)

558
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:20,039
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

559
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,640
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

560
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:25,850
(Were you surprised by our sudden visit?)

561
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,689
I was pretty surprised.

562
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:32,359
I thought, "Why are there so many people outside?"

563
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,889
"Are they actually coming in here? No way."

564
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:36,490
That's what went through my mind.

565
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:43,529
But I felt happy seeing them enjoy our food.

566
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:44,930
(She was happy during their visit.)

567
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,810
We'll head to our room.

568
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,640
After we unpack in our room,

569
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,980
- it's ramen, right?
- Yes.

570
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:58,650
(Finally on their way to the room in Cancun)

571
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,889
(Glancing around)

572
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,420
What's this? You...

573
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,720
- Did you turn it on?
- Yes.

574
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,329
- The heating function?
- No wonder my back got sweaty...

575
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:10,730
the moment I sat down.

576
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,559
Shouldn't we leave once the production crew arrives?

577
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,600
(Changing the subject)

578
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:18,299
(Checking the heating function again)

579
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,469
(Relieved, he waits for the crew.)

580
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,939
(Greeting)

581
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,239
Shouldn't we stop by the beach?

582
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,710
He just ignored you, didn't he?

583
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,109
(The local ignored CEO Lee's greeting.)

584
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,670
I got embarrassed and asked right away.

585
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:31,550
Shouldn't we stop by the beach?

586
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:32,650
Of course.

587
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,979
There's a beach right next...

588
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,320
to the ramen place.

589
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,860
We can stop by...

590
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,689
before eating.

591
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:43,389
Or after.

592
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:45,089
We should check out...

593
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:46,299
- Okay.
- the beach.

594
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,399
Good.

595
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,460
You little...

596
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,870
(He turned on the heating function again.)

597
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,739
I'm going to pass out from the heat.

598
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,169
(Having fun)

599
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:55,269
I'm seriously going to pass out, okay?

600
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:57,239
You shouldn't take the heat lightly.

601
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,640
(Current temperature: 32°C)

602
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,979
You know that, right?

603
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,510
- When you turn on the AC...
- Yes?

604
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,080
- after the heating function, - Yes?

605
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:06,050
- hot air comes out.
- Really?

606
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:08,219
- Since it's been heated.
- Imagine this happening...

607
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,349
because of the heat.

608
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:11,319
(A passing-out ending)

609
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,790
And I'd be all sweaty.

610
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,860
That'd be the end of our trip.

611
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:16,830
How funny.

612
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,230
It's already past 6pm.

613
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:20,399
You're right.

614
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,046
(It's already dinner time, after lunch once they landed.)

615
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:24,600
Having a car is nice. It's relaxing.

616
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,499
- The car makes it comfortable.
- Right?

617
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,870
The quality of our trip has gone up.

618
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,210
It's like getting a new item in a game.

619
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,880
- A nice item.
- Right?

620
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:36,050
I'm excited.

621
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,550
- About the house?
- Yes.

622
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:40,120
(Getting more excited as they get closer to the place)

623
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:41,780
(Glancing)

624
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:44,520
(Glancing again)

625
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:47,219
Because of you, I'm checking the function every ten seconds.

626
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,360
(On the way to the house)

627
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:49,790
- I've got PTSD now.
- What's that?

628
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:51,960
I think you should turn here.

629
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,729
Do we show him the booking?

630
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:54,860
(They arrive at the house.)

631
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,970
- It must be a secure place.
- You're right.

632
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,770
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

633
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,010
That front gate makes it reassuring.

634
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:06,339
The town itself is cute.

635
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,510
- Right?
- Yes.

636
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,349
Parking seems easy.

637
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,710
I guess we can park anywhere.

638
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:13,180
It must be that house, number 80.

639
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:14,719
That must be the parking lot.

640
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,190
- I can park there, right?
- Yes.

641
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:18,889
(He successfully parks the car.)

642
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:20,459
- All good.
- Thank you, Woo Bin.

643
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,820
- No worries.
- Great job.

644
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:24,330
I'll see if you can open the trunk.

645
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,230
- It'll open.
- Okay.

646
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:30,570
That's our house too, right?

647
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,269
No.

648
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,340
The door is different.

649
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:34,900
There's a line.

650
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,640
It's in different colours.

651
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:39,239
Does that mean it's only this house?

652
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,309
It seems like it.

653
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,540
(CEO Lee is disappointed.)

654
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,610

656
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,950
How is it?

(Laughing)

658
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,730
It's completely different from the photos.

659
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,630
It...

660
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:05,330
It smells quite bad.

661
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:12,070
(The first impression of the house isn't good.)

662
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:16,249
(The remote controller...)

663
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,310
(doesn't work.)

664
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,419
Listen. Imagine opening the drawer...

665
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,350
and cockroaches crawl out.

666
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:27,260
(Imagining useless things)

667
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,290
The bed is...

668
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,459
(Under the dark lighting, )

669
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:36,530
(the room feels like no one manages it.)

670
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:38,429
Won't it crumble down?

671
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:40,040
(There are also traces of time.)

672
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,970
How much did you pay for this place again?

673
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,810
Was it around 230 dollars?

674
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:49,149
How can it be this different...

675
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,610
from Mexico City?

676
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:54,619
(A similar price but a different feeling)

(Kyung Soo heads to the 2nd floor right away.)

683
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,940
The second floor is...

684
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,249
Is it nice?

685
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:25,719
There are two more rooms. Or not?

686
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,450
I knew it. This can't be everything.

687
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:29,820
- The photos...
- It's over 200 dollars.

688
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:31,519
It's different from the photos.

689

(Their hopes are still up.)

690
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,290
It's kind of neat in here.

Let's use the second floor, Kwang Soo.

692
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,829

- One can sleep here,

- while two sleep over there.

697
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:50,009

- What?
- Those things...

700
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:57,110
It's not blood, is it?

701
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,680
Isn't that poop?

702
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:03,090
Why is the toilet paper black?

703
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,890
Let's not use the toilet paper.

704
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,820
We should buy some. I'll write it down.

705
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:10,559
- The owner...
- No one used this place.

706
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,500
It said he was a superhost.

Thankfully, cold air is coming out.

713

What's a relief is that...

714
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,580
the AC is working properly.

715
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,019

- Yes.
- It works.

00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:39,619
To use the hot water, the owner said...

718
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:42,689
to open the heating valve or something outside.

719
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:43,860
Is that so?

720
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:47,399
(Heading to the 1st floor backyard to check the boiler)

721
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,970
Why is the place surrounded by iron bars?

722
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:52,129
This must be the heater.

723
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:53,270
You're right.

724
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:56,640
(Looking around after spotting the heater for the hot water)

725
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:59,310
When I saw...

726
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,410
the place on Airbnb,

727
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,050
I thought about eating out here.

728
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:06,950
Yet another problem.

729
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:09,550
Let's head out now.

730
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:11,649
(Glancing)

731
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:13,289
(He opens the fridge.)

732
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:16,030
(Taken aback)

733
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,330
What is that?

734
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,430
It's mangos.

735
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,600
(Spotted mangos with an unknown expiration date)

736
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:30,240
Those who use hot water have to turn the valve on.

737
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,910
How do I turn it on?

738
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,440
We shouldn't turn it on.

739
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:37,250
Woo Bin, does it say how to open the valve?

740
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,420
It did say something about it.

741
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:44,250
- The message said… - It's plugged in.

742
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,090
This is wild.

743
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,619
"To use hot water,"

744
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,660
"you must turn on the heater in the backyard."

745
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:51,989
We've turned it on just now.

746
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,600
I guess it's on now.

747
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,829
Should it not be making any noise?

748
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,076
Do we have to turn the water on?

749
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,329
- Hold on.
- Try it.

750
00:27:58,330 --> 00:27:59,530
(Checking if the water is hot)

751
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:04,840
It's not working yet.

752
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:07,380
But it's on now.

753
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,080
Yes, we've turned it on.

754
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:13,520
(Even the hot water boiler doesn't work.)

755
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:16,720
Kwang Soo, because it's so hot outside,

756
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:18,530
- Is it lukewarm?
- the water is lukewarm.

757
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,359
We don't need to turn it on.

758
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,189
But I've never washed with cold water.

759
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:23,560
Just do it.

760
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:24,960
I can't, okay?

761
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:27,130
I want to shower under hot water.

762
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:30,500
(Flustered by the house that's not as they expected)

763
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,440
Is it usable?

764
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,110
Wait, what's this?

765
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,609
Why are there so many ants?

766
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:43,180
Hey, it's full of ants.

767
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,830
- Why are there so many here?
- What?

768
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,750
All of these are ants.

769
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,650
- They're ants.
- Over here.

770
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,150
This is full of ants.

771
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,420
Let's get out of here now.

772
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,890
(An eco-friendly house he wants to leave fast)

773
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,230
Are we going to unpack?

774
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,559
What now?

775
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,840
(They must decide on the rooms.)

776
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,800
How about we stay on the second floor?

777
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,169
The second floor is much cleaner.

778
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:10,370
- Let's stay on the second floor.
- Okay.

779
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,409
Let's go.

780
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:14,130
(Betting on the single room or double room)

781
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,950
Can't we sleep together?

782
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,710
- I can't be alone.
- No.

783
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:19,920
First place gets the single room.

784
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,850
Or third place gets the single room.

785
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:24,190
Let's do third place gets the single room.

786
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,820
No.

787
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,220
I think I'll come in last.

788
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,059
Then, first place gets the single room?

789
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,930
Let's decide with rock-paper-scissors.

790
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,476
- Okay.
- Decide by rock-paper-scissors.

791
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,060
Decide who will sleep alone.

792
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,870
- Okay.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

793
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:37,730
(Kwang Soo has won.)

794
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,200
- Third place sleeps alone.
- Okay.

795
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,070
- Hold on.
- Ants, right?

796
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:45,810
I feel itchy.

797
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,110
Wait. Should we change to first place?

798
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:51,079
I'll change it if everyone wants to.

799
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,210
- Change it.
- Okay.

800
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:53,749
- First place, okay?
- Okay.

801
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,549
- First place gets the single room.
- Got it.

802
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,349
- First place is not the winner.
- Okay.

803
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,850
(Starting with Woo Bin)

804
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,490
- Six.
- Six.

805
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:03,729
(It's a high number for Zero Boy.)

806
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:05,560
- You never know.
- Please.

807
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,630
No, there's a method to getting zero.

808
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,669
Six times eight. Forty-eight.

809
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:11,299
This is your first-ever high number.

810
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,400
Right?

811
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,370
It's the first since we played this game.

812
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,610
Who's next?

813
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,680
(You)

814
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,010
(Next is Kwang Soo.)

815
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:25,810
Aren't I the CEO?

816
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,420
Hurry up, Kwang Soo.

817
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,520
Lower is better.

818
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,350
Seriously?

819
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,159
(Flinching)

820
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,190
You little...

821
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:37,689
Shouldn't I go again?

822
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:38,859
- Hurry up.
- Hurry up.

823
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,459
- Quickly.
- You didn't stop it.

824
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,800
(Starting again)

825
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,230
- Okay.
- Yes.

826
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,200
(He got the highest number, 9, on this 1st go.)

827
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,870
You got 48, right?

828
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,760
Six times eight. Forty-eight.

829
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,010
- Get five and I win, right?
- Yes.

830
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,939
(Woo Bin: 6 times 8, 48, Kwang Soo: 9 times...)

831
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:55,979
(Kwang Soo: 9 times 4, 36)

832
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,110
Okay.

833
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,679
Thirty-six.

834
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,880
(Kwang Soo has survived.)

835
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,480
(Last is Kyung Soo.)

836
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:03,920
Six.

837
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:05,589
(Trembling)

838
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:07,019
Get eight, and it's another round.

839
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,159
Don't get nine.

840
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,459
(Kyung Soo: 6 times 6, 36)

841
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,589
Okay.

842
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:12,330
(Woo Bin: 48, Kwang Soo: 36, Kyung Soo: 36)

843
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,799
Woo Bin wins the single room.

844
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,160
(He wins the single room.)

845
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:17,400
Sleeping after spraying the repellent.

846
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:20,140
(Changing from last to 1st place backfired on him.)

847
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,240
Do we unpack?

848
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:25,310
Let's bring the luggage in.

849
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,140
- Going upstairs...
- To use the car,

850
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,580
- we should take out the luggage.
- What is it?

851
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,850
(Sighing)

852
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,150
I sighed,

853
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:40,020
and when I did, a bug went into my mouth.

854
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,060
- No way.
- For real. Something hit my throat.

855
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:47,299
From now on, let's check thoroughly...

856
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,900
Let's invest more in our accommodations.

857
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,500
Were there reviews?

858
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:52,699
The reviews weren't that bad.

859
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,340
I'm sure locals don't use Airbnb.

860
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,769
True.

861
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:57,770
(Walking past)

862
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,910
Oh, gosh.

863
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,179
You startled me.

864
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,780
We might hit you with our elbows on reflex.

865
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,449
If you're passing by,

866
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:07,679
- make a noise like a chef.
- "Passing through."

867
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,750
(The expedition team is on edge now.)

868
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,890
Do we leave after taking these upstairs?

869
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:14,120
Yes.

870
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,059
But...

871
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,260
(They plan to leave after freshening up.)

872
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:21,760
(Spraying)

873
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:23,930
I'm glad we only booked this place for a day.

874
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:25,499
What, Kwang Soo?

875
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,939
It's a relief we only booked for a day.

876
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:27,940
For real.

877
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,470
How about we leave now?

878
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:32,070
Shall we?

879
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:33,910
- You...
- But where do we go?

880
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:35,080
To get ramen.

881
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,210
Get a grip.

882
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:38,480
After ramen...

883
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,580
Check out the beach.

884
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,190
Must we walk on the beach?

885
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,820
We should get back as late as we can.

886
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,960
Right?

887
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:49,860
I might even sleep on the beach.

888
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:56,030
(GBRB: Joy Pops Laugh Pops)

889
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,800
(The expedition heads out after getting changed.)

890
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,370
(Chattering)

891
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:02,670
Why are you laughing?

892
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:05,010
Why did you laugh just now?

893
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:08,540
(CEO Lee is irritated by everything that's been happening.)

894
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,260
Why is everyone getting on my nerves?

895
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:13,680
Let's pack and check out...

896
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,190
as soon as we wake up tomorrow.

897
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,960
Thankfully, we start early tomorrow.

898
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:19,590
It's at 7:30am, right?

899
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,759
- It's 7:10am.
- 7:10am?

900
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,489
- Yes, I'll check it out later.
- Let's do that.

901
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:24,789
- How long it will take.
- It'll take about 30 minutes.

902
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:26,350
(They'll check it on the way to ramen.)

903
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,300
Kyung Soo, send me the address.

904
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,969
Kwang Soo, are we getting ramen first and then going to the beach,

905
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:33,370
or should we hit the beach first and eat ramen after?

906
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,320
- Let's get ramen after the beach.
- Okay.

907
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,739
Beach, eat ramen,

908
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,709
go grocery shopping, and then return.

909
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:41,079
- We should buy some water too.
- Yes.

910
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:44,810
(Heading to the beach first)

911
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:49,319
Tomorrow morning,

912
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,690
- after we pack and check out, - Yes.

913
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:54,030
- we'll take the whale shark tour.
- Good.

914
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,429
I should check the meeting spot...

915
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:57,489
(Woo Bin checks tomorrow's schedule.)

916
00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:58,730
for tomorrow in advance.

917
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:02,200
We leave from Punta Sam.

918
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:06,400
"Once you check in,"

919
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,139
"you must pay 40 dollars per person..."

920
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,510
(About 58,000 won)

921
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,710
"in cash for the federal pier fee."

922
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,210
Where?

923
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,449
- What does that mean?
- The whale shark tour?

924
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:18,510
Yes.

925
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,750
Is it an additional fee?

926
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,520
We have to pay for the pier usage fee in cash.

927
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:24,420
It must be a separate fee.

928
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:25,790
Oh, no.

929
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:29,360
If it's 40 dollars per person,

930
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:31,130
that's about 55,000 won.

931
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,700
- How expensive.
- It's the same as our Airbnb.

932
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:35,929
It's around 150 dollars.

933
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:36,969
(Laughing)

934
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:39,600
(The additional fee is equal to a 1-night stay.)

935
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,509
Tomorrow, was it Playa del Carmen?

936
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:45,639
Yes. I think we should spend two nights there.

937
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,010
- Yes.
- And...

938
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,310
we can search online.

939
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:50,649
Places to check out?

940
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:51,650
- Yes.
- Let's do that.

941
00:34:51,651 --> 00:34:53,149
There are islands.

942
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,220
You're right.

943
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:56,619
Wrapping it up at a place like that sounds nice.

944
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,820
Visiting an island isn't all that bad.

945
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,960
Let's get out of here as soon as possible.

946
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:03,930
(Leaving the Airbnb is the first priority.)

947
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:07,429
- It's huge.
- That place looks nice.

948
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:09,399
- What is it? A resort?
- A resort.

949
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,930
Why is it that big?

950
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:13,140
It's like a palace.

951
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,139
(Glancing)

952
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,069
- That place also looks nice.
- Exactly.

953
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:18,070
(Glancing)

954
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,280
Look at the building on the left.

955
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:23,650
What is that?

956
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:26,780
This street must be full of hotels.

957
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,179
Should I check the prices?

958
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,419
- Let's see how much it costs.
- Okay.

959
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,390
We won't go, but we can still look up the prices.

960
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,960
I'll look into it.

961
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,490
It's 770 dollars for 1 night.

962
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,800
That's expensive.

963
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:45,100
We might not even have 770 dollars left.

964
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:49,569
Only if we were rich would we have experienced such a hotel.

965
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:51,110
Exactly, and we're all the way here.

966
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:55,239
But really, the Airbnb in Mexico City was a nice one.

967
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,310
I know, right?

968
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:57,510
It's like...

969
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,520
we've lost out on a big business deal.

970
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:04,750
Let's spend a generous amount on our house tomorrow.

971
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:07,060
Let's do that. Not just tomorrow.

972
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,460
Even if we must starve...

973
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:10,290
I think spending on our house is better.

974
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,229
- Let's have McDonald's.
- I'm in.

975
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,790
(Decided to spend everything on Airbnb)

976
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:16,470
- It's the sea on the right.
- Can you see it?

977
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:20,169
(The sea is right before them.)

978
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:22,370
The sea is almost level with the land.

979
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:25,410
- No wonder it's the Caribbean Sea.
- Right?

980
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:26,639
- My gosh.
- Oh, gosh.

981
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,640
- It's right in front of the sea.
- I know, right?

982
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,250
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

983
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:32,919
You can walk to the beach.

984
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,080
(Their expectations for the Caribbean Sea have risen.)

985
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,850
The sky is beautiful.

986
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:39,449
- You're right. It's pink.
- Yes.

987
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:43,060
(They're in downtown Cancun.)

988
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:45,929
It's here. Coco Bongo.

989
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:47,599
- You're right. It's here.
- It's over here.

990
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,800
I want to check that place out really badly.

991
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,470
"The Mask."

992
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:53,640
Gosh, how dazzling.

993
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:54,999
The Mask was there.

994
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,910
- There's Madonna...
- He's Freddie Mercury.

995
00:36:57,770 --> 00:36:59,309
- Great job.
- Thank you.

996
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:00,410
I'm in total bliss.

997
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,910
Turn left after going straight.

998
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,519
Right next to here?

999
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,160
(Navigation Doh leads them to the beach.)

1000
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:12,920
It's 8pm, but it's still so bright.

1001
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,320
What is that?

1002
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,120
I think they're all restaurants.

1003
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,930
They look so fancy.

1004
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,376
There are a lot of places that make me want to spend money.

1005
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,476
(They are full of tourists, as expected from a hot spot.)

1006
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,499
We should have saved up when we were in Mexico City.

1007
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,569
I know.

1008
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:28,970
We didn't even overspend there.

1009
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:31,240
The most we spent...

1010
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:33,410
was for the hot-air balloon.

1011
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:36,650
- The hot-air balloon was worth it.
- Right.

1012
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:40,249
I think this is the entrance.

1013
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,419
Yes, this must be it.

1014
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,980
(The arrive at the entrance while enjoying the vibes of Cancun.)

1015
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,560
- It smells like the ocean.
- I know.

1016
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,360
The salty smell.

1017
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,130
The tasty smell.

1018
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:53,660
(The culinary director has a different sense of smell.)

1019
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,730
It’s the Caribbean beach.

1020
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:59,070
(How will their first view of the Mexican ocean look like?)

1021
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,540
(Gosh)

1022
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,240
It’s the Caribbean beach.

1023
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:07,840
Gosh, it's nice.

1024
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,610
You can't see the end at all.

1025
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,209
(It overflows with a sense of ease.)

1026
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:12,849
Even after the sun is down,

1027
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:14,349
there are a lot of people in the water.

1028
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:16,150
(It overflows with a sense of ease.)

1029
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:18,250
It is really different.

1030
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,419
It would have been better in the daytime,

1031
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,520
when it's hot.

1032
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:31,230
(Woo Bin feels the warmth of the sand.)

1033
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,369
Kwang Soo, try walking barefoot.

1034
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:34,499
It feels nice.

1035
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:39,540
(They do nice things together.)

1036
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:43,010
The water is warm.

1037
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:44,880
The water is warm.

1038
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,550
Gosh, it feels nice.

1039
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,920
It’s the Caribbean beach.

1040
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:59,329
(They feel the ocean in Mexico for the first time.)

1041
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:04,329
(They stare out into the water, with the sound of the waves.)

1042
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:06,270
- I like how the water isn't cold.
- I know.

1043
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:09,140
I really want to go in the water here.

1044
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:15,180
(CEO Lee can't easily get away.)

1045
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,749
Let's go out this way,

1046
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,579
go to Coco Bongo,

1047
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:20,749
then go to eat ramen.

1048
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:21,850
Let's do that.

1049
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,050
The ocean...

1050
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,119
(It was short, but they were able to feel the Caribbean beach.)

1051
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,720
- I love the ocean here.
- I know.

1052
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,260
Being here,

1053
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:31,690
- it feels like we're on a vacation.
- It does.

1054
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:33,029
It's really...

1055
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,399
I get why...

1056
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,600
- vacation spots are vacation spots.
- Yes.

1057
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:39,030
We need to enjoy it like this.

1058
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:42,400
- This is how you enjoy Cancun.
- Kwang Soo.

1059
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,410
Let's just sleep here.

1060
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,340
I can do that.

1061
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,140
It could be better that way.

1062
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:50,970
We should have just come here without stopping at the room.

1063
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:52,550
Then I would have been really happy.

1064
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:56,080
The Mask greets you at the entrance.

1065
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,589
- Really?
- He was here.

1066
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:59,420
- He's over there. The Mask.
- Where?

1067
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:01,120
It's the Mask.

1068
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:07,130
(This place was the stage that was featured in "The Mask.")

1069
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:09,970
Where are you from?

1070
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:11,269
Korea.

1071
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:12,599
- Korea?
- Yes, Korea.

1072
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,799
(The Mask greets them welcomingly.)

1073
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,940
Take a picture. Come on.

1074
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,269
(Welcome to Mexico.)

1075
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:19,469
Korea.

1076
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:21,840
(Welcome to Mexico.)

1077
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:23,250
(Leaning over)

1078
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:25,379
(Carrying him)

1079
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:28,319
(Welcome to Mexico again.)

1080
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,480
(Lucky him...)

1081
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:33,190
(Screaming)

1082
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,360
(Welcome to Mexico again.)

1083
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:42,900
- Thank you.
- "Gangnam Style."

1084
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,529
Thank you.

1085
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:47,440
(It’s a pleasant night filled with their warm welcome.)

1086
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,570
- Let's go, now.
- Should we go?

1087
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,510
We saw Coco Bongo.

1088
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,239
We will cross the street here.

1089
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,040
(They will now head to the ramen place.)

1090
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:57,780
The ramen place is in here.

1091
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:00,880
There it is.

1092
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,420
It's here.

1093
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,149
- Hello.
- Hello.

1094
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,990
(They are finally at the ramen place.)

1095
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,259
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1096
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,560
It's lobster ramen.

1097
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:13,259
Don't you think we should have the lobster ramen?

1098
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,130
Let's just check the price first.

1099
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,930
It's 40 dollars.

1100
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:18,269
What?

1101
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:19,400
It's 40 dollars per serving.

1102
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:20,740
Really?

1103
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,399
Why is it so expensive?

1104
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,410
This one has two crabs,

1105
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:27,010
and it's 33.61 dollars.

1106
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,280
This is too expensive.

1107
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:32,410
(It's expensive, but his eyes say he wants it.)

1108
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,719
We're here to eat this,

1109
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,920
so we should have one.

1110
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,450
Should we order these three?

1111
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,850
That sounds good.

1112
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,189
(Raising his hand)

1113
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:41,589
- What was it?
- Excuse me.

1114
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:43,530
"Muscape?"

1115
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:45,459
"Muscate?"

1116
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,059
That's not it.

1117
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,659
- "Disculpe." - "Disculpe."

1118
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,070
(Disculpe!)

1119
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:51,670
- Hello.
- Coke Zero.

1120
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:55,740
- One Hiroya lobster ramen.
- Lobster ramen?

1121
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,570
- And one blue crab miso.
- Blue crab miso.

1122
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:02,040
- And one paitan ramen.
- Paitan ramen. Okay.

1123
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:03,709
- Can you speak Japanese?
- Yes, I can.

1124
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:04,780
Is that so?

1125
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,949
- One fried rice, - Fried rice.

1126
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:08,279
- and one onigiri.
- Okay.

1127
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,320
(Speaking fluently)

1128
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:11,649
- That's it.
- Okay, thank you.

1129
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:13,019
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1130
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:14,696
(The director secretly speaks Japanese fluently.)

1131
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,729
Should we take a look at tomorrow's accommodation?

1132
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:17,959
- Yes, let's do that.
- Let's choose the place.

1133
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,059
I feel like...

1134
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:22,259
It could be the only way to make me feel better.

1135
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,869
Choosing the next place to sleep.

1136
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:25,700
- Let's be careful.
- Okay.

1137
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,069
Are you going to get away from Cancun?

1138
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:28,340
We're done with Cancun.

1139
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:31,746
I don't know anything else, but we're going to get out of here.

1140
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:33,070
Don't stop us.

1141
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,410
I will also look at Agoda.

1142
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,580
- I will look at Airbnb.
- Okay.

1143
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:39,949
Let's check 2 or 3 each,

1144
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:41,149
and then...

1145
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:42,320
- Yes.
- choose from there.

1146
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:44,050
What should we put...

1147
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:45,890
as the price limit?

1148
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,789
- Per night.
- How much was it today?

1149
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:49,959
We stayed at a place that was 150 dollars.

1150
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,360
Let's search above 150 dollars.

1151
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:53,730
That's for sure.

1152
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,530
It doesn't make sense...

1153
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,370
because this place is 170 dollars.

1154
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:01,940
Don't be fooled by the pictures.

1155
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,069
It could be a bit dangerous here.

1156
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:05,339
It's dangerous.

1157
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:06,880
If it has a similar structure...

1158
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:08,740
to our current place, then it's bad.

1159
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:12,880
This is a bit new.

1160
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:15,249
- No.
- No.

1161
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:16,789
- Really?
- This is also similar.

1162
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:18,950
Does it have to be better than this?

1163
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:21,789
This could be like our current place.

1164
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:23,630
We now have the trauma.

1165
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:25,729
So we need to be careful.

1166
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:27,106
(They want to be really careful about choosing the place.)

1167
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:29,330
- This is...
- Just take a look.

1168
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:31,569
- The living room.
- Gosh.

1169
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:32,829
This is a palace.

1170
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:34,140
- Kitchen.
- How much is it?

1171
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,239
Bedroom one.

1172
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,510
(He won't listen.)

1173
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:39,009
Two bathrooms.

1174
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:40,179
But Woo Bin,

1175
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:41,710
can we check how much we have left?

1176
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:45,110
Just a rough check on how much we have left.

1177
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:46,210
First of all...

1178
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,649
- We have about 900 dollars.
- Should we just eat first?

1179
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:50,719
- Since we could lose our appetite?
- For three nights?

1180
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,690
We have 1,200 dollars, right?

1181
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:54,719
We have 1,200 dollars, and...

1182
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,620
Should we have ordered two orders of ramen?

1183
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,290
It's too late.

1184
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,129
(Looking around)

1185
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:02,030
- We have...
- Hye Rin, are you going to eat?

1186
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:03,729
- You're going to eat here, right?
- No.

1187
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:04,906
- Are you going somewhere else?
- Yes.

1188
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:06,870
Why? Do you think it will take a long time here?

1189
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,016
No, I was going to sell one of ours.

1190
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,140
(A new concept of ramen resale)

1191
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:13,339
Three nights.

1192
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:14,660
We have three nights left, right?

1193
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,209
- Three nights.
- Is it three nights?

1194
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:18,779
Then, if we stay at a place that is 300 dollars per night,

1195
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:19,979
and exclude 900 dollars...

1196
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:21,619
- So 1,200 minus 900 dollars.
- It's 300 dollars.

1197
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:22,779
We have 300 dollars left, right?

1198
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:24,689
And now,

1199
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:26,219
we still have six meals...

1200
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:27,720
left to eat.

1201
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:30,730
The meals aren't the problem.

1202
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:33,059
- The meals, but...
- We need to snorkel.

1203
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:34,099
I know.

1204
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:36,559
So, if we stay at a place like that,

1205
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,070
it's the end for us.

1206
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:39,799
- Let's just end it.
- Let's just...

1207
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:40,999
stay at the hotel...

1208
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,900
and order delivery.

1209
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,779
(Out of words)

1210
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:50,780
(They might end up travelling for delivery food.)

1211
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:54,020
But we need to call...

1212
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,780
CEO Ko.

1213
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:57,320
We can do that.

1214
00:44:57,650 --> 00:44:58,920
We can...

1215
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:00,590
stay at a place...

1216
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,319
that is...

1217
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,790
about 100 dollars cheaper...

1218
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:07,030
and eat burgers.

1219
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,600
But then, how can we broaden our perspectives that way?

1220
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:11,430
That's what I'm thinking.

1221
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,439
- We need to...
- I can't stay like this.

1222
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,699
- Not in Cancun.
- Listen.

1223
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:16,939
When we write to CEO Ko,

1224
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:19,270
let's attach the ant video.

1225
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:21,879
Let's attach the pictures...

1226
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,009
- of our room.
- The ants and the mould.

1227
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:26,180
Whether it's in the email or a video.

1228
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,549
- He needs to see it.
- So...

1229
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:29,420
We were this thrifty...

1230
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:32,289
- while exploring the place.
- While exploring the place.

1231
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:33,489
The place was...

1232
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:35,119
That's not it.

1233
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,189
Isn't that the purpose?

1234
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:37,790
- To broaden our perspectives?
- Sure.

1235
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:40,359
We can't broaden our perspectives.

1236
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:41,630
Since we don't have the money.

1237
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:44,170
You do have the purpose.

1238
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:47,070
We need to enjoy ourselves to broaden our perspectives,

1239
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:48,670
but we don't have the money.

1240
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:50,510
So we can't enjoy ourselves.

1241
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:54,110
(Holding back laughter)

1242
00:45:55,610 --> 00:45:57,150
Give us the money.

1243
00:45:57,310 --> 00:46:00,380
(The CEO's miserable cry for not having money)

1244
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:04,290
(And the two employees just think he's funny.)

1245
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:10,190
What should we do? We can't just go on like this.

1246
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:13,429
We were fooled.

1247
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:14,730
To be honest.

1248
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:18,100
My mom will cry when she sees this.

1249
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:20,369
(Right?)

1250
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:21,500
Sure.

1251
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:24,569
(Chuckling)

1252
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:26,810
I can't sleep because of the smell.

1253
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,579
I can't sleep.

1254
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:29,909
(Bursting into laughter)

1255
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:32,580
(He ends up bursting into laughter.)

1256
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:37,350
The ants were making me scratch like crazy.

1257
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:39,589
What am I supposed to do?

1258
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:40,660
This is...

1259
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:42,519
How can we broaden our perspectives?

1260
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,630
What are we supposed to feel after seeing the ants?

1261
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,200
It doesn't fit with the purpose.

1262
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,669
It doesn't match our show.

1263
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:52,629
Putting everything else aside, it doesn’t match our show.

1264
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:53,740
Our show.

1265
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:57,709
What is this? I don't even know the title.

1266
00:46:57,710 --> 00:46:58,940
What is the title?

1267
00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:00,479
(It's a show about an expedition to find joy and laughter.)

1268
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,209
What are we doing?

1269
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:03,810
What is the purpose?

1270
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:04,979
It doesn't match.

1271
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:05,980
What is all this?

1272
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:08,119
We need to tell CEO Ko.

1273
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,150
We do need to tell him.

1274
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:10,919
For now, book a nice place right away.

1275
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,320
(Charismatic)

1276
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:17,060
(The CEO of KKPP Foods is parched from the money crisis.)

1277
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:18,789
(Laughing)

1278
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:20,400
Gosh, order some soju.

1279
00:47:22,030 --> 00:47:23,460
Tell them to give us the ashtray.

1280
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,540
(It's a hard night for the CEO.)

1281
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,040
I should write that down. The ant video.

1282
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:36,640
First, the ant video.

1283
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,249
Second, the tissue mould.

1284
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:40,650
(He writes down the list of proof.)

1285
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:42,120
We already have seven.

1286
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:44,289
I got seven in a minute.

1287
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:45,689
(1. Ant video, 2. Tissue mould, 3. Lights that won't turn on, )

1288
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:47,019
(4. Mystery stains on the sink, 5. Mango left in the fridge, )

1289
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:48,696
(6. Hot water tank outdoors, 7. Torn window screen)

1290
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,929
- We need to call him for sure.
- You'd need a video call.

1291
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:52,630
(The food is here.)

1292
00:47:52,990 --> 00:47:54,059
Thank you.

1293
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:55,159
(Paitan ramen)

1294
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,930
- What?
- It looks good.

1295
00:47:57,470 --> 00:47:58,600
It's white.

1296
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:00,940
I will explain.

1297
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,009
- You're explaining again?
- About paitan ramen...

1298
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:05,286
Do we have to hear the whole thing?

1299
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:06,910
"It's a type of Japanese ramen,"

1300
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,039
- "and the soup..." - Amazing.

1301
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,610
(Blue crab miso ramen)

1302
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:13,310
Gosh, the smell of crabs...

1303
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:15,619
- Gosh.
- It's amazing.

1304
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:17,750
- Kwang Soo, this is...
- Yes?

1305
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:19,949
We eat tonkotsu ramen in Japan, right?

1306
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:23,289
It's made with pork bones.

1307
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:24,629
This is made with chicken bones.

1308
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:26,660
Gosh, that's new.

1309
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:28,899
- This is chicken broth.
- It's chicken broth.

1310
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:30,630
Woo Bin, you drink all of it.

1311
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:31,870
It's protein.

1312
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:34,070
Let's count.

1313
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,070
- The broth, first?
- Yes.

1314
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:40,169
(As always, he smells it first.)

1315
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:42,710
- The broth is thick.
- It smells amazing.

1316
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:44,880
One, two, three.

1317
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:49,750
Gosh.

1318
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,189
- That's good.
- It's good.

1319
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:54,520
(He fainted because it's so good.)

1320
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:56,960
Gosh.

1321
00:48:57,430 --> 00:48:59,260
It's good.

1322
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:02,060
(Deeply moved)

1323
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:03,460
It feels like stepping into...

1324
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:06,130
an outdoor hot spring in the wintertime.

1325
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:07,669
- It's true.
- It's true.

1326
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:09,550
- Doesn't it feel exactly like it?
- It's true.

1327
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:11,339
- Samgyetang extract.
- It's really...

1328
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:13,010
concentrated to the fullest.

1329
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:15,660
You can taste the savoury flavour of the chicken.

1330
00:49:16,610 --> 00:49:17,850
Let's try this one.

1331
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:19,680
This is...

1332
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:21,249
This can't be bad.

1333
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:22,780
(Next is the blue crab miso ramen.)

1334
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:24,789
This must be available since we're by the ocean.

1335
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:26,649
This is only possible in Cancun.

1336
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:27,760
One, two, three.

1337
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:31,130
Gosh.

1338
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:34,540
("It makes you exclaim right away," by Director Doh)

1339
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:38,270
It's blue crab stew.

1340
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:41,691
("It makes you shake your head, then nod in the end," by Auditor Kim)

1341
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:44,339
This is concentrated chickens,

1342
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:46,339
and this is concentrated blue crabs.

1343
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:48,939
There are about 30 chickens in here.

1344
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:50,709
After arriving here in Mexico,

1345
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:52,679
it usually took you about five seconds to react,

1346
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,519
but this took 0.1 seconds.

1347
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,719
- It's so good.
- It's because it's within...

1348
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:57,849
- our knowledge of flavour.
- You know the flavour?

1349
00:49:57,850 --> 00:49:59,290
- Within the data?
- Yes.

1350
00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:00,990
It went straight to the brain.

1351
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:02,920
The flavour.

1352
00:50:04,530 --> 00:50:06,259
(The final ramen)

1353
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:08,030
This is the highlight.

1354
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,600
The most expensive one.

1355
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,200
(Next to the most expensive lobster ramen, )

1356
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:14,940
(there is something shiny.)

1357
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:17,269
(After checking it, )

1358
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:19,470
(Kyung Soo puts it aside.)

1359
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:21,340
What?

1360
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:23,480
(Exchanging glances)

1361
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:24,580
Wait a minute.

1362
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:26,510
The most expensive one.

1363
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:29,250
(Next to the most expensive lobster ramen, )

1364
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:31,990
(there is something shiny.)

1365
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:34,260
(After checking it, )

1366
00:50:34,290 --> 00:50:36,590
(Kyung Soo puts it aside.)

1367
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:38,330
What?

1368
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:40,500
(Exchanging glances)

1369
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:41,660
Wait a minute.

1370
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,200
You...

1371
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,829
If you put that aside after seeing it...

1372
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:48,340
- I mean, where did you get this?
- Kyung Soo.

1373
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:50,539
- Where did you get this?
- Kyung Soo.

1374
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:51,909
(It's the friendship bracelet that Kyung Soo lost.)

1375
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:53,410
What was that?

1376
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,380
Where did you get this?

1377
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:56,640
You...

1378
00:50:56,641 --> 00:50:58,041
(About this friendship bracelet...)

1379
00:50:58,150 --> 00:50:59,179
We got a good one that suits us.

1380
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:03,250
(It's the symbol of friendship for the expedition.)

1381
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,220
(But...)

1382
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:07,520
I lost my bracelet.

1383
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:08,859
(Kyung Soo lost the bracelet after 2 hours.)

1384
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:10,290
Where did it slip off?

1385
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:12,660
You need to find it.

1386
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:14,530
I'll buy another one.

1387
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,160
Something else.

1388
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:18,570
What meaning will it have if it's something else?

1389
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:22,840
(The missing bracelet case remained as a scar to them.)

1390
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,470
(The day after the missing case)

1391
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:26,809
Where was it?

1392
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:29,039
(The staff happened to find the missing bracelet on the street.)

1393
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,240
Our friendship bracelet.

1394
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:33,210
It’s basically a two-hour-long friendship.

1395
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:35,780
(The bracelet was passed on to Woo Bin.)

1396
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:38,750
- Write this down.
- Wait a minute.

1397
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:42,060
(Woo Bin was looking for the right timing for revenge.)

1398
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,429
(Silently)

1399
00:51:44,430 --> 00:51:47,060
(Secretly passing the bracelet to Kwang Soo)

1400
00:51:48,030 --> 00:51:50,360
(Bracelet)

1401
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:53,170
(Kwang Soo got the bracelet.)

1402
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,069
(Gently)

1403
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:58,010
(He hides it under the cup.)

1404
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:01,209
(Watching for the right timing to reveal the bracelet)

1405
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:03,480
(Is it now?)

1406
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:06,849
(Tipping it over on purpose)

1407
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:09,220
(Look at the bracelet here.)

1408
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:11,550
(But Kyung Soo...)

1409
00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:14,020
- There are three crabs in here.
- I know.

1410
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:17,430
(He was so busy with the three crabs...)

1411
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:23,330
(that he didn't notice the bracelet right in front of him.)

1412
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,500
(He even placed it aside.)

1413
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:28,240
(What?)

1414
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,570
(Frozen)

1415
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:33,409
- I...
- You placed it aside...

1416
00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:35,540
- like tissue paper.
- I didn't think this was mine.

1417
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:38,379
Really.

1418
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:40,680
I thought yours fell off while moving these.

1419
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:42,650
Where was it?

1420
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:43,989
(Eyes full of disappointment)

1421
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:46,490
- Where was it?
- When was the last time you saw it?

1422
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:48,519
I really don't remember.

1423
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:50,560
(Eyes shaking in panic...)

1424
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:53,960
(and silence scarier than a roar)

1425
00:52:55,930 --> 00:52:57,800
Let's just end it when we get to Seoul.

1426
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,430
Not Seoul.

1427
00:52:59,830 --> 00:53:01,140
Get out of my sight right now.

1428
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,440
- I can't keep on with you.
- But where was it, really?

1429
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,980
Don't lose it.

1430
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:10,210
(Nodding)

1431
00:53:10,211 --> 00:53:11,310
Where is your ring?

1432
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:13,180
My ring is here.

1433
00:53:13,181 --> 00:53:15,256
- Why did you take it off?
- I was washing my hands.

1434
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,750
Why? Do you have something to hide?

1435
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:19,630
Why did you take your ring off?

1436
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:21,366
Isn't it supposed to be precious?

1437
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:22,750
Am I the stupid one to have it on?

1438
00:53:23,930 --> 00:53:26,090
(Hurriedly searching for the ring)

1439
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:27,759
Why would you take your ring off?

1440
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,660
- The ring...
- Why did you take it off?

1441
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:31,370
What are you going to do?

1442
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:34,450
Why did you take the ring and bracelet off?

1443
00:53:35,270 --> 00:53:37,470
Am I the stupid one to keep them on at home?

1444
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:39,210
Am I?

1445
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:42,279
What is it? Am I the stupid one?

1446
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:44,050
(They look like a couple with a lost ring.)

1447
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:45,850
I'm sorry.

1448
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:47,749
Thank you.

1449
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:49,420
(Hurriedly putting on the bracelet)

1450
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:51,450
(Thank you.)

1451
00:53:51,590 --> 00:53:52,690
Do it with two hands.

1452
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,460
(Thank you very much.)

1453
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:58,160
Broth.

1454
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:00,760
- Kyung Soo. Let's take the broth.
- Yes?

1455
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Let's do that.

1456
00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:04,870
(They take a scoop of the ramen that they forgot about.)

1457
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,470
How much is this? Is it 40 dollars?

1458
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,540
This is actually a really expensive ramen.

1459
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:12,309
But if it's an actual whole lobster, then 40 dollars isn't expensive.

1460
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:14,509
- Sure.
- This is only possible because...

1461
00:54:14,510 --> 00:54:15,539
we're by the ocean in Cancun.

1462
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:17,080
- One, two, three.
- Try it.

1463
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:18,680
Try it.

1464
00:54:18,681 --> 00:54:24,850
(How does the most expensive lobster ramen taste?)

1465
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:27,720
(They are back to the gourmet expedition mode.)

1466
00:54:27,790 --> 00:54:29,260
Gosh, how is it like this?

1467
00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:30,790
I thought it would be similar,

1468
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:31,790
- but it's completely different.
- Totally different.

1469
00:54:31,791 --> 00:54:33,429
- It's different?
- It's completely different.

1470
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:34,430
Really?

1471
00:54:34,431 --> 00:54:36,100
This isn't ramen.

1472
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:38,469
- Try this.
- How should I call this?

1473
00:54:38,470 --> 00:54:39,729
The broth is so thick.

1474
00:54:39,730 --> 00:54:41,339
- You're right.
- It's really thick.

1475
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:42,400
- It's thick.
- Yes.

1476
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:44,210
And the small particles...

1477
00:54:44,370 --> 00:54:46,569
of the lobster are inside.

1478
00:54:46,570 --> 00:54:49,310
The innards from the lobster...

1479
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:51,509
- are all in the broth.
- Right, the innards.

1480
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:54,020
- Oh, the innards are added.
- That's why it's green.

1481
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:55,320
I guess so.

1482
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:56,950
Gosh, it's so good.

1483
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:02,360
(They taste the noodles after the broth.)

1484
00:55:02,361 --> 00:55:03,460
This is so good.

1485
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:06,090
The noodles are different as well.

1486
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,430
- Really?
- Is that so?

1487
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:09,130
The innards from the lobster...

1488
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,470
coat the noodles.

1489
00:55:12,170 --> 00:55:14,569
You can see it floating. It's green.

1490
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:17,570
The oil from the innards coats them.

1491
00:55:17,870 --> 00:55:20,470
(Slurping)

1492
00:55:23,210 --> 00:55:25,110
(Amazed)

1493
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:26,980
Gosh, this is so good.

1494
00:55:37,690 --> 00:55:41,300
(The sound makes you want to start making ramyeon.)

1495
00:55:46,030 --> 00:55:47,740
(Savouring)

1496
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,716
(They express the highly developed taste with just one sound.)

1497
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:54,080
The lobster here...

1498
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:56,809
isn't just any lobster.

1499
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:58,150
It's full of meat.

1500
00:55:59,210 --> 00:56:00,310
It's packed.

1501
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:05,690
Lobsters...

1502
00:56:06,490 --> 00:56:08,320
have a more...

1503
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:11,089
distinct flavour. Right?

1504
00:56:11,090 --> 00:56:13,130
(Kwang Soo focused on removing the lobster meat...)

1505
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:17,870
(and put the extracted flesh on Woo Bin's plate.)

1506
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,999
(This time, he's removing lobster meat for himself.)

1507
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,139
(Focused)

1508
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:26,070
(Taking a bite)

1509
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:29,109
(It's stripped clean.)

1510
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:30,280
It's so good.

1511
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,479
I can see the lobster innards.

1512
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,249
(Meanwhile, he's devouring the lobsters.)

1513
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:38,750
Compared to the noodles,

1514
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:41,990
there are so many lobsters.

1515
00:56:43,790 --> 00:56:45,590
Which dish do you think is the best?

1516
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:48,030
(Waving his hand)

1517
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:49,630
I can't choose one.

1518
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:51,229
All three were the best.

1519
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:52,370
(All three were the best.)

1520
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:54,476
- Is it that good?
- Gosh, this is so good.

1521
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:55,940
Fried rice.

1522
00:56:57,670 --> 00:56:59,110
This looks so good.

1523
00:56:59,210 --> 00:57:00,210
(Their fried rice is here.)

1524
00:57:00,211 --> 00:57:01,809
There are shrimp and meat.

1525
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:03,240
(Their fried rice is here.)

1526
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:07,880
Thank you.

1527
00:57:10,050 --> 00:57:11,150
Thank you.

1528
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:17,059
(The warm-hearted CEO serves his employees first.)

1529
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:18,489
(Gosh)

1530
00:57:18,490 --> 00:57:19,960
- Is it good?
- Yes.

1531
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:25,069
(Gosh)

1532
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:27,970
(The best reaction from the protein lover)

1533
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:31,339
(The CEO takes a bite too.)

1534
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:32,769
(Gosh)

1535
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:35,040
(He can't help but nod at the taste.)

1536
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:36,140
We get a taste of the sea...

1537
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:37,140
- with the shrimp, - Right.

1538
00:57:37,141 --> 00:57:38,210
And meat gives it...

1539
00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:39,780
a rich, meaty aroma as well.

1540
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,150
What do you call that?

1541
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:45,249
A mix of flavours from the sea and the land.

1542
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:46,450
A feast of land, sea, and air?

1543
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:47,890
No.

1544
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:49,959
A mix of flavours from the sea and the land.

1545
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:51,560
I don't think there's a phrase for that.

1546
00:57:51,830 --> 00:57:53,990
- The delicacy from land and sea.
- Yes, that's right.

1547
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:56,830
(The fried rice has a variety of flavours.)

1548
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:59,129
(Pouring soy sauce)

1549
00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:00,169
(Offering Kwang Soo a bite first)

1550
00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:01,200
Try it.

1551
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:05,939
(They share the salmon rice ball.)

1552
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:07,339
The rice itself tastes good.

1553
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:09,409
(They share the salmon rice ball.)

1554
00:58:09,410 --> 00:58:11,680
(Gosh)

1555
00:58:11,850 --> 00:58:12,949
It's been a while since I tasted...

1556
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:14,049
- rice like that.
- Right.

1557
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:16,680
(They finish up eating.)

1558
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,320
We have quite a lot to do today.

1559
00:58:19,350 --> 00:58:21,060
We have to decide where to stay.

1560
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:23,160
We have to stop by the store...

1561
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:26,690
- for toilet paper and water.
- To buy things.

1562
00:58:26,730 --> 00:58:28,729
We have to send that to CEO Ko too.

1563
00:58:28,730 --> 00:58:31,230
- We...
- We should do it here.

1564
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:32,829
I wrote down the list.

1565
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:33,900
(A list of videos)

1566
00:58:33,930 --> 00:58:35,540
Number one, the ant video.

1567
00:58:35,570 --> 00:58:37,769
Number two, mouldy toilet paper.

1568
00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:39,840
Number three, the lights don't work.

1569
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:41,909
Let's attach a video of this too.

1570
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:43,310
Kyung Soo lying on the bed...

1571
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:45,210
with a wet towel on his forehead.

1572
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:46,910
We'll say he's sick.

1573
00:58:47,850 --> 00:58:49,479
(They're now trying to trick CEO Ko.)

1574
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:52,019
Doh Kyung Soo not feeling well.

1575
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:53,350
(Got it.)

1576
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:55,189
(Filming)

1577
00:58:55,190 --> 00:58:57,360
(Kwang Soo is filming another video for evidence.)

1578
00:59:00,330 --> 00:59:03,429
(Title: The auditor is having rice with just water.)

1579
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:05,030
(Pitiful)

1580
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:08,040
(Putting on sunglasses for added effect)

1581
00:59:08,370 --> 00:59:11,069
(Immersed in his role)

1582
00:59:11,070 --> 00:59:13,109
(Sighing)

1583
00:59:13,110 --> 00:59:16,480
(Sighing to add a sense of melancholy)

1584
00:59:17,910 --> 00:59:20,510
(They wrap up filming.)

1585
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:21,919
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1586
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:24,120
(Dinner is over.)

1587
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:25,689
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1588
00:59:25,690 --> 00:59:27,689
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1589
00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:29,020
Thank you.

1590
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:31,729
What should we do about the car?

1591
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:33,660
- We'll stop by the store.
- The store first?

1592
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:35,159
- And then we'll go.
- Are you grocery shopping first?

1593
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:36,200
- Yes.
- Yes.

1594
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:38,699
We don't even have water.

1595
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:39,976
(They're going to the store to buy essentials.)

1596
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,269
The way I see it,

1597
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:43,300
the toilet paper in our Airbnb...

1598
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:45,870
is from a pyramid or something.

1599
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:49,210
It's at least 1,000 years old.

1600
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:53,710
(They're in desperate need for fresh toilet paper.)

1601
00:59:54,820 --> 00:59:56,379
I hope it's cool inside.

1602
00:59:56,380 --> 00:59:57,620
I think it will be.

1603
00:59:58,290 --> 01:00:00,450
Maybe I'll wear workout clothes.

1604
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:02,190
Or a sleeveless shirt.

1605
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:03,690
- It's cool inside.
- Gosh.

1606
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:05,329
This is great.

1607
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:08,030
(A wonderful invention of modern civilization)

1608
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:09,859
I feel soft and dry.

1609
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:11,300
Immediately soft and dry.

1610
01:00:11,830 --> 01:00:15,440
(They enjoy the cool, dry air as they begin grocery shopping.)

1611
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:17,170
Let's get this.

1612
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:18,909
I'll carry it.

1613
01:00:18,910 --> 01:00:22,010
(The first thing they get is water.)

1614
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:24,749
Here it is.

1615
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:26,450
(Next, toilet paper.)

1616
01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:29,680
Should we get that?

1617
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:31,390
This long one is...

1618
01:00:31,950 --> 01:00:33,220
Are those paper towels?

1619
01:00:33,650 --> 01:00:35,459
Where's the toilet paper?

1620
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:36,540
(Woo Bin confused the two.)

1621
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:37,989
Paper towels...

1622
01:00:37,990 --> 01:00:38,990
(Laughing)

1623
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:40,889
They are thick and nice.

1624
01:00:40,890 --> 01:00:42,000
(They are thick and nice.)

1625
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:43,430
Something like this?

1626
01:00:44,570 --> 01:00:45,570
- Is that it?
- Yes.

1627
01:00:45,571 --> 01:00:46,929
- There are four inside.
- Let's get that then.

1628
01:00:46,930 --> 01:00:47,999
How much? Is it 18 pesos?

1629
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,940
It's 18.50 pesos.

1630
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:51,870
That's the cheapest one.

1631
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:55,109
Should we get beach towels?

1632
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:57,480
- For the car?
- Sounds good.

1633
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:01,150
We'll buy three since we'll be getting in the car wet.

1634
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:02,856
- We'll lay them on the seats.
- All right.

1635
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,120
- Let's get cheap ones.
- Okay.

1636
01:01:04,490 --> 01:01:05,820
Check the price.

1637
01:01:06,290 --> 01:01:07,820
It's 289 pesos.

1638
01:01:08,690 --> 01:01:10,319
This one's 199 pesos.

1639
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:11,390
Really?

1640
01:01:11,690 --> 01:01:12,860
That's 14 dollars, right?

1641
01:01:13,390 --> 01:01:15,099
That's the cheapest one.

1642
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:16,130
Really?

1643
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:18,299
How much are those pink ones?

1644
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:19,470
That's 229 pesos.

1645
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,900
(They're strictly looking for the cheapest one.)

1646
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:25,069
Kyung Soo, the bathing suits...

1647
01:01:25,070 --> 01:01:26,269
They're over there.

1648
01:01:26,270 --> 01:01:29,140
I'm buying it with my own money.

1649
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:31,109
This must be a bathing suit.

1650
01:01:31,110 --> 01:01:32,309
I think so.

1651
01:01:32,310 --> 01:01:33,650
The length is...

1652
01:01:34,850 --> 01:01:36,250
not that long, though.

1653
01:01:36,550 --> 01:01:38,390
Doesn't this one look too short, too?

1654
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:40,989
- It's not that long.
- It's too short.

1655
01:01:40,990 --> 01:01:42,060
- Right?
- Yes.

1656
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:43,919
It's pointless, then.

1657
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,830
(Shopping for Kyung Soo without Kyung Soo)

1658
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:48,059
How do you want it to fit?

1659
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:49,329
Do you want it to be tight?

1660
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:50,659
- No, just...
- Then this should be fine.

1661
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:51,729
I'll get this, then.

1662
01:01:51,730 --> 01:01:53,600
I'll get these two.

1663
01:01:53,970 --> 01:01:55,039
All right.

1664
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:57,600
(He chooses the one Woo Bin suggested.)

1665
01:01:58,070 --> 01:02:00,470
It's so cool here. I want to stay a bit longer.

1666
01:02:00,910 --> 01:02:02,110
- To be honest, I...
- What?

1667
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:04,749
To be honest, I want to sleep here.

1668
01:02:04,750 --> 01:02:06,050
It's so hot outside.

1669
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:12,490
Woo Bin is working out right now.

1670
01:02:13,690 --> 01:02:15,460
There's no time for a separate workout.

1671
01:02:16,490 --> 01:02:20,560
(Woo Bin is taking care of himself while they're on the move.)

1672
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:21,899
Anyway, the...

1673
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:23,099
I thought I lost my hat,

1674
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:24,800
but the hat was in the room.

1675
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:26,569
(On top of his bracelet, Kyung Soo had lost his hat too.)

1676
01:02:26,570 --> 01:02:27,940
I must have been out of it.

1677
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:31,640
(Woo Bin is doing a shoulder workout.)

1678
01:02:32,270 --> 01:02:33,940
- Hello.
- Hello.

1679
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:42,680
(He keeps lifting it up and down.)

1680
01:02:44,150 --> 01:02:50,320
(He continued the exercise for quite some time.)

1681
01:02:54,860 --> 01:02:57,299
You know my Spanish song?

1682
01:02:57,300 --> 01:02:58,300
- Yes.
- Yes.

1683
01:02:58,301 --> 01:02:59,729
Apparently, it topped the charts in Mexico.

1684
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:00,829
- Really?
- Yes.

1685
01:03:00,830 --> 01:03:02,169
- Right now?
- That's amazing.

1686
01:03:02,170 --> 01:03:03,850
I don't know if it's right in this moment.

1687
01:03:04,710 --> 01:03:08,079
But since I'm in Mexico, my fans...

1688
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:09,520
They must have listened to it a lot.

1689
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:11,886
(Kyung Soo's song, "Si Fueras Mia," topped the charts in Mexico.)

1690
01:03:11,910 --> 01:03:13,149
The original song...

1691
01:03:13,150 --> 01:03:15,679
is in Spanish.

1692
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:17,279
The original song...

1693
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:18,720
Its lyrics are beautiful.

1694
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:22,059
So the song topped the charts in Mexico.

1695
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:23,060
- Really?
- Yes.

1696
01:03:23,061 --> 01:03:24,490
You must be grateful.

1697
01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:26,660
"Si Fueras Mia."

1698
01:03:27,860 --> 01:03:28,899
(Laughing)

1699
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:30,060
What does that mean?

1700
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:33,299
It means "If you were mine."

1701
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:35,146
(The youngest is talkative as he brags to his older brothers.)

1702
01:03:35,170 --> 01:03:36,540
Sing for your fans.

1703
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,070
Sing for them right now.

1704
01:03:40,540 --> 01:03:42,460
I'll play the song that topped the charts, then.

1705
01:03:42,810 --> 01:03:49,120
("Si Fueras Mia" by Doh Kyung Soo)

1706
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:55,590
(They drive home, listening to the number 1 song.)

1707
01:03:56,060 --> 01:04:02,059
(But I can only see you in my dreams, my love)

1708
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:08,940
(But I can only see you in my dreams, my love)

1709
01:04:11,770 --> 01:04:17,640
(If you were mine)

1710
01:04:18,110 --> 01:04:21,250
(I'd take you to many places)

1711
01:04:21,450 --> 01:04:24,280
(To see you be happy, and to see you smile)

1712
01:04:24,550 --> 01:04:27,450
(There's nothing I can't do)

1713
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:32,160
(I can give you the entire world right now)

1714
01:04:32,490 --> 01:04:36,430
(If you were mine)

1715
01:04:36,530 --> 01:04:39,070
For people like us, who don't know Spanish,

1716
01:04:39,170 --> 01:04:40,906
doesn't he practically sound like he's from Spain?

1717
01:04:40,930 --> 01:04:42,070
Right.

1718
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:46,740
What do Spanish people think about your pronunciation?

1719
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:53,680
They can tell I'm not from Spain,

1720
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:55,979
but they...

1721
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:57,679
They can still understand what you're saying.

1722
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:58,790
Yes.

1723
01:04:58,950 --> 01:05:00,850
That's what I've been told.

1724
01:05:05,130 --> 01:05:07,029
(Kyung Soo feels shy from the compliments.)

1725
01:05:07,030 --> 01:05:10,060
You remember that singer, Chonangang?

1726
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,470
(Laughing)

1727
01:05:12,570 --> 01:05:13,770
I've heard of him.

1728
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:16,940
He used to sing Korean songs,

1729
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:18,710
and he was very popular.

1730
01:05:19,770 --> 01:05:21,740
- There was that band called Y2K.
- Right.

1731
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:23,309
Not being that fluent in Korean...

1732
01:05:23,310 --> 01:05:26,079
- was adorable.
- Had its charms.

1733
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:27,250
Yes, it did.

1734
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:30,500
Maybe that's how Spanish people feel about this song.

1735
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:31,919
There was that incident people loved.

1736
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:33,390
How the guy in Y2K sang off-key.

1737
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:34,959
How he went off-key and apologised?

1738
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:35,960
Yes.

1739
01:05:35,961 --> 01:05:38,090
(Laughing)

1740
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:45,130
(After chatting about this and that, )

1741
01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:50,670
(the song is already coming to an end.)

1742
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:53,910
You're so good.

1743
01:05:55,540 --> 01:05:57,310
You sing so well.

1744
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:00,210
Is everyone in your family a good singer?

1745
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:04,149
- I think they are.
- Really?

1746
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:06,320
- My father's a good singer.
- Is he?

1747
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:07,689
My older brother is a good singer too.

1748
01:06:07,690 --> 01:06:08,860
- Really?
- Yes.

1749
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:13,189
When my brother was in middle school and high school,

1750
01:06:13,190 --> 01:06:14,929
he was good at singing.

1751
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:17,760
- So I copied him.
- You copied him?

1752
01:06:18,370 --> 01:06:20,370
That's how I got into singing.

1753
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:25,440
There's a Starbucks drive-thru.

1754
01:06:25,670 --> 01:06:28,440
(They spot a cafe on their way home.)

1755
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:31,010
- I want a coffee.
- Me too.

1756
01:06:32,650 --> 01:06:34,386
If we had the money, I would have gotten one.

1757
01:06:34,410 --> 01:06:37,220
(The expedition team can barely afford coffee.)

1758
01:06:38,590 --> 01:06:40,590
Let's just get one. Let's just use company funds.

1759
01:06:41,190 --> 01:06:42,990
I didn't do anything wrong.

1760
01:06:44,060 --> 01:06:45,830
I'm getting coffee. I'm getting Starbucks.

1761
01:06:47,830 --> 01:06:49,400
Should we just go? What do you think?

1762
01:06:50,430 --> 01:06:51,699
I think it's going to be expensive.

1763
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:53,646
(The CEO can't think straight in front of coffee.)

1764
01:06:53,670 --> 01:06:55,599
It says...

1765
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,639
(They pull into the drive-thru to check the prices.)

1766
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:58,710
Give me a second.

1767
01:07:00,110 --> 01:07:01,540
Let's take this road.

1768
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:05,026
- We should have gone this way.
- Turn on the hazard lights.

1769
01:07:05,050 --> 01:07:06,809
I think we're supposed to order here.

1770
01:07:06,810 --> 01:07:08,419
(They missed the entrance.)

1771
01:07:08,420 --> 01:07:10,140
That's it, right? Let's just circle around.

1772
01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:11,320
Okay.

1773
01:07:11,490 --> 01:07:12,890
We should have gone this way.

1774
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:14,590
The opposite direction?

1775
01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:17,919
You're right. We can turn around.

1776
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:20,230
(Even buying coffee is hard.)

1777
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:22,160
Should we just head home?

1778
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:24,970
No, we can go that way.

1779
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:27,699
Not the Airbnb. I meant Korea.

1780
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:30,900
(Not the Airbnb. I meant Korea.)

1781
01:07:31,610 --> 01:07:34,780
(They take courage and drive up to the entrance.)

1782
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:39,410
Are they not open?

1783
01:07:41,210 --> 01:07:42,380
I guess they're not.

1784
01:07:43,850 --> 01:07:46,520
(They turn around empty-handed.)

1785
01:07:47,190 --> 01:07:48,220
Gosh.

1786
01:07:50,590 --> 01:07:52,830
It feels like we're heading back to base after vacation.

1787
01:07:53,860 --> 01:07:57,300
(They're nearing the Airbnb.)

1788
01:07:58,130 --> 01:07:59,469
The window is open on the second floor.

1789
01:07:59,470 --> 01:08:02,000
Do you think bugs could have made it inside?

1790
01:08:02,470 --> 01:08:04,140
I'll sleep in the car, then.

1791
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:06,150
Let's just all sleep in the car.

1792
01:08:08,810 --> 01:08:11,280
- Thank you for driving.
- Thank you for driving.

1793
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:12,710
I'm so scared.

1794
01:08:12,910 --> 01:08:14,150
The car is nice and cool.

1795
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:18,690
(They made it back to the Airbnb.)

1796
01:08:20,220 --> 01:08:21,589
It's cooler now.

1797
01:08:21,590 --> 01:08:22,660
It is.

1798
01:08:23,490 --> 01:08:25,330
No one must have stayed here for a while.

1799
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:28,700
But...

1800
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:30,430
it still smells a lot.

1801
01:08:30,630 --> 01:08:33,230
That mouldy smell.

1802
01:08:34,130 --> 01:08:36,269
I just touched the curtains.

1803
01:08:36,270 --> 01:08:39,270
They were tied up, so I untied them.

1804
01:08:39,370 --> 01:08:40,769
A few seconds later, something tickled my arm,

1805
01:08:40,770 --> 01:08:42,690
so I looked down and saw something crawl around.

1806
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:44,580
It was a tiny spider.

1807
01:08:46,610 --> 01:08:47,610
Is this...

1808
01:08:47,611 --> 01:08:49,691
What are those? The water. Are they for us to drink?

1809
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:52,619
The three cases of water.

1810
01:08:52,620 --> 01:08:54,489
- Are these it?
- They must be.

1811
01:08:54,490 --> 01:08:55,990
These are for us to drink.

1812
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:58,760
But there's no water inside. Wait, there is.

1813
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:01,300
It seems like someone already drank from this.

1814
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:03,440
Someone must have already drunk from this.

1815
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:07,330
- That's awful.
- Hey, the three cases of water?

1816
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:09,539
- Kyung Soo.
- These are the drinking water.

1817
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:10,799
- Somebody drank from them.
- Out of the three cases,

1818
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:11,910
someone drank two of them,

1819
01:09:12,110 --> 01:09:13,950
and there's only a third left in the last one.

1820
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:16,510
Take pictures.

1821
01:09:16,910 --> 01:09:18,790
I should keep taking them with my phone, right?

1822
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:20,209
We'll take the pictures...

1823
01:09:20,210 --> 01:09:22,090
- and send them to you.
- Yes, send them to me.

1824
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:24,450
I'll film the ants first.

1825
01:09:26,790 --> 01:09:28,620
Why are there fewer ants than before?

1826
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:30,959
- They must be sleeping.
- They must be asleep.

1827
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:32,660
Should we sprinkle sugar?

1828
01:09:33,790 --> 01:09:35,159
The first thing on the list was ants.

1829
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:36,629
- Hey!
- Do you see them?

1830
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:38,099
Hey!

1831
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:40,770
The ants are living in here.

1832
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:42,340
Gosh.

1833
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:43,599
(Woo Bin's camera)

1834
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:45,969
Gosh, they live in the sugar jar.

1835
01:09:45,970 --> 01:09:48,009
(Woo Bin's camera)

1836
01:09:48,010 --> 01:09:49,040
How is this...

1837
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:52,049
Okay, we got the first evidence.

1838
01:09:52,050 --> 01:09:53,509
(The expedition team is struggling in harsh conditions.)

1839
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:55,079
(They've secured the first piece of evidence.)

1840
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:56,560
Number two is the mouldy toilet paper.

1841
01:09:57,620 --> 01:09:59,140
- The toilet paper.
- Gosh, this is...

1842
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:01,990
I'm going home. I can't do this.

1843
01:10:03,990 --> 01:10:05,030
Gosh.

1844
01:10:05,190 --> 01:10:06,190
Here.

1845
01:10:06,330 --> 01:10:08,300
I'll film the rusty sink.

1846
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:12,700
(The auditor is taking close-ups for the second piece of evidence.)

1847
01:10:12,730 --> 01:10:19,740
(Woo Bin's camera)

1848
01:10:20,110 --> 01:10:21,440
This is broken.

1849
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:25,179
It's broken, so there's no hot water.

1850
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:26,750
- It's broken?
- Say that again.

1851
01:10:27,010 --> 01:10:28,049
(The third footage for reporting purposes)

1852
01:10:28,050 --> 01:10:29,750
This is broken, so there's no hot water.

1853
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:33,680
You didn't film the second floor yet, right?

1854
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:35,160
Not yet.

1855
01:10:35,390 --> 01:10:37,160
Can one of you come upstairs with me?

1856
01:10:37,790 --> 01:10:39,259
Come with me and film the second floor.

1857
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:40,740
(CEO Lee has become much more timid.)

1858
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:44,300
These questionable stains.

1859
01:10:49,540 --> 01:10:51,170
They may be blood.

1860
01:10:51,370 --> 01:10:53,239
(It's highly likely that they're insect droppings.)

1861
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:54,810
- I filmed it. Yes.
- You did?

1862
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:57,810
What did you film?

1863
01:10:57,980 --> 01:10:59,209
- What?
- What did you film?

1864
01:10:59,210 --> 01:11:01,530
The toilet paper. The toilet paper that's 1,000 years old.

1865
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:03,880
The 1,000-year-old toilet paper from the pyramids.

1866
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:09,190
(Meanwhile, Director Doh is doing something with toilet paper.)

1867
01:11:10,490 --> 01:11:11,989
- Wait.
- What?

1868
01:11:11,990 --> 01:11:13,360
Go back upstairs for a second.

1869
01:11:13,830 --> 01:11:14,860
We have to film this.

1870
01:11:17,830 --> 01:11:19,270
- Film what?
- What?

1871
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:26,869
(He's faking being sick to gain sympathy.)

1872
01:11:26,870 --> 01:11:29,480
Kyung Soo, the cushions under you...

1873
01:11:29,540 --> 01:11:31,140
Kyung Soo, let's take those out.

1874
01:11:32,510 --> 01:11:35,880
The colour looks too good.

1875
01:11:37,150 --> 01:11:38,749
Give them to me.

(Woo Bin: Cameraman, Kwang Soo and Kyung Soo: Actors)

1877

Can you tell that I'm frowning?

01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:44,360
You can't tell, right?

1879
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:45,729
Give me a second.

1880

(The actor with 12 years of experience develops his character.)

1881
01:11:47,890 --> 01:11:50,200
Don't speak. I'm filming a video.

(Kyung Soo gets into character.)

1883
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,100
Ready.

1887
01:12:05,410 --> 01:12:06,780
Don't laugh.

1888
01:12:07,610 --> 01:12:08,620
Don't laugh.

(The Bedridden Expedition Team: Take 6)

1952
01:14:34,290 --> 01:14:35,329
(The actor with 15 years of experience is struggling too.)

1953
01:14:35,330 --> 01:14:37,000
- This is impossible to do.
- Just do it.

1954
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:38,399
You lie down.

1955
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:39,629
- This is...
- Show us how you do it.

1956
01:14:39,630 --> 01:14:42,239
No, it has to show the CEO nursing his employee.

1957
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:43,540
No, the CEO should be sick.

1958
01:14:44,540 --> 01:14:47,210
No, but I'm the one sending the email.

1959
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:51,680
I'll be telling CEO Ko that my employees are sick.

1960
01:14:52,410 --> 01:14:54,110
I can't stop laughing.

1961
01:14:54,510 --> 01:14:56,920
I'll tend to him like this...

1962
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:00,000
and when you tilt the camera, I'll do this.

1963
01:15:00,150 --> 01:15:01,689
How can I not laugh at that?

1964
01:15:01,690 --> 01:15:03,320
You can keep your eyes closed.

1965
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:04,790
Okay.

1966
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:07,260
Ready.

1967
01:15:07,990 --> 01:15:09,830

1971
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:16,340
Why won't you follow the plan?

1972
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:17,669
We had an understanding.

1973
01:15:17,670 --> 01:15:18,839
Am I not even allowed to improvise a little?

1974
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:20,640
Don't improvise.

1975
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:23,709
- Just do what we agreed on.
- I'm just tucking you in.

1976
01:15:23,710 --> 01:15:25,910
All right. I'm letting you know I'll be doing this.

1977
01:15:26,010 --> 01:15:27,049
I'll tuck you in and...

1978
01:15:27,050 --> 01:15:28,180
(Woo Bin can't take it.)

1979
01:15:28,310 --> 01:15:29,850
- Don't improvise.
- Okay.

1980
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:31,780
Ready.

1981
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:34,290

(Bursting into laughter)

1985
01:15:40,130 --> 01:15:42,600
Why did you sigh?

1986
01:15:42,630 --> 01:15:43,830
I'm upset.

1987
01:15:44,830 --> 01:15:46,170
I'm supposed to be upset.

1988
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:48,869
Just do what we agreed on.

1989
01:15:48,870 --> 01:15:50,070
I'll sigh.

1990
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:51,470
I'll sigh just once.

1991
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:53,310
- Only once, then.
- Okay.

1992
01:15:53,470 --> 01:15:54,470

1996
01:16:04,150 --> 01:16:05,950
Sorry. I can't do it.

1997
01:16:07,090 --> 01:16:08,119
Forget it.

1998
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:09,619
We can't do it. Lie down.

1999
01:16:09,620 --> 01:16:10,860
Will you lie down for a second?

2000
01:16:10,990 --> 01:16:12,630
- I'm serious. Just go down.
- No.

2001
01:16:12,730 --> 01:16:14,389
- Mu Seong, will you do it?
- I can't.

2002
01:16:14,390 --> 01:16:16,176
- Just once. I won't laugh.
- Just this once.

2003
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:18,259
- But I don't feel confident.
- Hurry up.

2004
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:20,930
- Just keep your eyes closed.
- Just this once.

2005
01:16:21,030 --> 01:16:22,069
Right. CEO Ko...

2006
01:16:22,070 --> 01:16:23,669
You even nosebled yesterday.

2007
01:16:23,670 --> 01:16:24,839
- Right.
- That's true.

2008
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:26,239
- That's true.
- I'm sorry,

2009
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:27,870
but can you put tissues in your nose?

2010
01:16:28,780 --> 01:16:29,939
- But it's true.
- Tissues, please.

2011
01:16:29,940 --> 01:16:31,080
Tissues, please.

- What are you doing?
- Are you crazy?

2015
01:16:39,090 --> 01:16:41,490
Just stay still. Why...

2016
01:16:41,790 --> 01:16:43,760
All you have to do is just stay down, but why...

2017
01:16:43,820 --> 01:16:45,389
It's funny as soon as he approaches, right?

2018
01:16:45,390 --> 01:16:46,929
Hye Rin, can you do it? Help us just this once.

2019
01:16:46,930 --> 01:16:48,089
- This is impossible.
- I can't do it.

2020
01:16:48,090 --> 01:16:50,499
- Just close your eyes and lie down.
- I can never do it.

2021

We're a team, aren't we?

2022

2023
01:16:53,331 --> 01:16:54,811
- to a better accommodation?
- But...

01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:57,039
If we go, you get to go together, no?

2025
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:58,139
I won't last even for a second.

2026
01:16:58,140 --> 01:17:00,069
Hye Rin, am I doing this for myself?

2027
01:17:00,070 --> 01:17:01,939
Am I being greedy? Am I asking for too much?

2028
01:17:01,940 --> 01:17:03,010
Okay.

2029
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:05,086
- Only your upper body will appear.
- Seriously,

2030
01:17:05,110 --> 01:17:07,480
- I'm disappointed in all of you.
- Just lie down.

2031
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:09,619
- Place it.
- Place it.

2032
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:11,020
- Keep your eyes closed.
- Ready.

2033
01:17:11,180 --> 01:17:12,520
Don't laugh. Just don't laugh.

2034
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:14,420
Ready.

2035
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:16,619

2040
01:17:44,650 --> 01:17:46,189
You did it.

2041
01:17:46,190 --> 01:17:47,349
Thanks.

2042
01:17:47,350 --> 01:17:48,519
- Hye Rin, thank you.
- Seriously.

2043
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:50,290
We almost stayed up all night here.

2044
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:53,360
- Don't make me do it again.
- We almost stayed up all night.

2045
01:17:53,530 --> 01:17:55,429
- Let's go now.
- Good. That's good enough.

2046
01:17:55,430 --> 01:17:56,800
That's perfect.

2047
01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:59,430

stand downstairs like a ghost.

2053
01:18:18,050 --> 01:18:19,650
I think this will do.

2054

We got it. Let's write an email.

2055
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:23,760

Hello.

2069
01:18:56,961 --> 01:18:59,360
I'm calling you because...

2070
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:02,130
we're about halfway through our trip to Mexico.

2071
01:19:02,430 --> 01:19:03,700
And we're a little...

2072

- tight on budget.
- Okay...

- We're a little tight.

- It's not something I can...
- If you...

2075
01:19:11,700 --> 01:19:12,910
tell you over the phone.

(CEO Lee calls him and says it's not something to say over the phone.)

2077

01:19:15,940 --> 01:19:18,609
- about the budget...
- Right.

2079
01:19:18,610 --> 01:19:20,880
- last time we met.
- Right.

2080
01:19:20,910 --> 01:19:22,979
I'll take a look, and if there's anything to say,

2081
01:19:22,980 --> 01:19:24,419
I'll leave a comment.

Can you check as soon as possible?

2085
01:19:33,990 --> 01:19:35,360
Okay.

2086
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:36,829
- I'll do that.
- Okay.

2087

- Bye.
- Thank you. Bye.

- I think he'll send us money.
- I know.

"I believe this accommodation is the current situation..."

2098

"of the cultural expedition we, the employees, are going through."

(It sounds pretty resolute.)

2100

Why don't we...

2101
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:09,899
make a sincere approach?

2102
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:11,260
Below that.

2103
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:12,599
- Below this?
- Yes.

2104
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:14,430
"CEO Ko, we'll be honest with you."

2105
01:20:14,470 --> 01:20:15,670
Sounds good.

2106
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,470
"We ran out of money."

"CEO Ko."

2109
01:20:21,310 --> 01:20:22,710
- I'll add two dots.
- Sure.

2110
01:20:22,810 --> 01:20:24,139
Should we say we ran out of money...

2111
01:20:24,140 --> 01:20:25,610
or we're broke?

2112
01:20:26,110 --> 01:20:27,449
- We ran out of money.
- We ran out of money.

2113
01:20:27,450 --> 01:20:28,750
We ran out of money.

2114
01:20:29,850 --> 01:20:31,380
- "However," - "However."

"we swear..."

"we're staying..."

2119
01:20:45,630 --> 01:20:47,569
- "Here is an attachment." - Okay.

2120
01:20:47,570 --> 01:20:49,940
"Here is an attachment of our accommodation."

2121
01:20:50,270 --> 01:20:51,369
I think we should...

2122
01:20:51,370 --> 01:20:53,010
appeal to him at the end.

2123
01:20:53,570 --> 01:20:55,210
- Appeal to him?
- Yes.

2124
01:20:55,470 --> 01:20:56,680
"Actually..."

2125
01:20:56,940 --> 01:20:58,809
"Actually, Writer Hye Rin is very sick."

2126
01:20:58,810 --> 01:21:01,380
(The Expense Report sounds very appealing.)

2127
01:21:01,610 --> 01:21:02,820
I'll add three dots.

2128
01:21:04,450 --> 01:21:06,150
"She's keeping it a secret from everyone."

2129
01:21:08,250 --> 01:21:10,390
"But you cannot cover the sky with your palm."

2130
01:21:11,890 --> 01:21:13,290
"All the production crew..."

2131
01:21:13,890 --> 01:21:15,060
"is aware of it..."

2132
01:21:15,290 --> 01:21:16,900
"and heartbroken by it."

2133
01:21:17,430 --> 01:21:20,370
(One tear jerking expense report)

2134
01:21:20,530 --> 01:21:22,370
Let's add this.

2135
01:21:22,570 --> 01:21:23,640
What?

2136
01:21:23,740 --> 01:21:25,100
"Two staff members..."

2137
01:21:25,470 --> 01:21:26,910
"nosebled yesterday."

2138
01:21:27,570 --> 01:21:29,210
- It's true.
- Yes.

2139
01:21:30,110 --> 01:21:31,979
Do you have a picture of you nosebleeding?

2140
01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:33,380
No.

2141
01:21:34,250 --> 01:21:36,020
Do you want to take it now?

2142
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:38,280
Just put tissues in your nose.

2143
01:21:39,620 --> 01:21:41,120
So we can include the picture.

2144
01:21:41,790 --> 01:21:46,590
(The expedition team nosebleeding from heavy workload)

2145
01:21:47,030 --> 01:21:48,900
Send them to me.

2146
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:50,930
The pictures you took.

2147
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:51,960
Good.

2148
01:21:51,961 --> 01:21:55,070
(Director Doh gathers the data and organises it.)

2149
01:21:55,170 --> 01:21:56,540
I don't think we need this.

2150
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,299
(The Expense Report is almost completed.)

2151
01:21:58,300 --> 01:22:00,140
Even if he reads it...

2152
01:22:00,370 --> 01:22:01,540
Oh, my stomach...

2153
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:04,280
(The auditor doesn't look good.)

2154
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:07,449
- I know.
- He might not know.

2155
01:22:07,450 --> 01:22:08,850
(He's touching his stomach.)

2156
01:22:11,420 --> 01:22:13,490
Can we restart in ten minutes?

2157
01:22:13,990 --> 01:22:15,390
- I have a stomachache.
- Okay.

2158
01:22:16,190 --> 01:22:18,119
(Woo Bin leaves in the end.)

2159
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:19,789
- I'll be right back.
- We'll work on it.

2160
01:22:19,790 --> 01:22:20,859
- What?
- We'll work on it.

2161
01:22:20,860 --> 01:22:21,930
Right. Work on it.

2162
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:23,600
- We'll work on it.
- Sure.

2163
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:24,930
We'll work on it.

2164
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:27,040
Listen and see if there's anything to fix.

2165
01:22:27,230 --> 01:22:29,140
"In the remaining time,"

2166
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:31,999
"we'll experience various cultures and accommodations in Cancun,"

2167
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,970
"and most importantly, the food."

2168
01:22:35,010 --> 01:22:38,210
"By enriching our knowledge, KKPP Foods plans to..."

2169
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:40,079
"try diverse experiences..."

2170
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:41,910
"for our future direction."

2171
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:43,919
"If you send us the requested amount,"

2172
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:46,749
"we will not be extravagant, but look out the world..."

2173
01:22:46,750 --> 01:22:49,190
"and enrich our knowledge by parasailing,"

2174
01:22:49,490 --> 01:22:51,589
"experience the traditional Mexican food..."

2175
01:22:51,590 --> 01:22:53,030
"for the next season,"

2176
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:55,189
"and by snorkelling, we'll enrich our knowledge..."

2177
01:22:55,190 --> 01:22:56,500
"on fresh seafood."

2178
01:22:57,200 --> 01:23:00,570
(An Expense Report like a nitrogen package is completed.)

2179
01:23:01,530 --> 01:23:02,670
Nice.

2180
01:23:02,940 --> 01:23:04,670
I like it.

2181
01:23:08,610 --> 01:23:09,740
Period.

2182
01:23:10,010 --> 01:23:12,170
- The requested amount is 5,000.
- It's 5,000 dollars.

2183
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:14,080
Done?

2184
01:23:14,250 --> 01:23:16,150
Done. I attached all the files.

2185
01:23:19,390 --> 01:23:21,090
That's good.

2186
01:23:21,190 --> 01:23:23,060
Do I save it?

2187
01:23:23,820 --> 01:23:25,389
Then now...

2188
01:23:25,390 --> 01:23:26,890
let's all go to bed.

2189
01:23:26,990 --> 01:23:30,360
- Is it 6:10am tomorrow?
- We leave.

2190
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:32,629
- Then...
- Let's meet at that time.

2191
01:23:32,630 --> 01:23:33,929
Okay.

2192
01:23:33,930 --> 01:23:36,530
(They wrap up the day in a rush to start the day early tomorrow.)

2193
01:23:38,540 --> 01:23:41,670
(Kwang Soo heads downstairs after getting ready for bed.)

2194
01:23:44,580 --> 01:23:47,609
(The medicine the production crew prepared for Woo Bin)

2195
01:23:47,610 --> 01:23:51,980
(He takes it.)

2196
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:58,920
(He also gulps down the sports drink.)

2197
01:24:07,470 --> 01:24:08,630
I have a stomachache.

2198
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:10,720
- You have a stomachache?
- Yes.

2199
01:24:11,740 --> 01:24:13,270
My stomach keeps growling too.

2200
01:24:14,670 --> 01:24:16,479
(Groaning)

2201
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:17,780
Did I eat something wrong?

2202
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:20,710
(The whole expedition team can't get used to the water.)

2203
01:24:22,350 --> 01:24:24,080
(Rustling)

2204
01:24:27,250 --> 01:24:28,420
(Kyung Soo groans.)

2205
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:30,720
There's medicine downstairs.

2206
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:32,320
I'm going to the restroom.

2207
01:24:34,290 --> 01:24:37,000
(Kyung Soo goes to the restroom while sleeping.)

2208
01:24:38,860 --> 01:24:40,670
(Soon)

2209
01:24:47,110 --> 01:24:50,910
(He returns looking somewhat haggard.)

2210
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:53,710
(Soon)

2211
01:24:55,010 --> 01:24:58,780
(Kyung Soo goes back to the restroom.)

2212
01:24:59,390 --> 01:25:01,850
(Soon again)

2213
01:25:04,060 --> 01:25:06,929
(Kwang Soo is laughing.)

2214
01:25:06,930 --> 01:25:10,530
(Kwang Soo is laughing harder.)

2215
01:25:10,860 --> 01:25:15,030
(Kwang Soo finds Kyung Soo becoming haggard funny.)

2216
01:25:16,100 --> 01:25:17,340
Just cover your stomach.

2217
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:18,900
I should.

2218
01:25:20,110 --> 01:25:24,810
(They spent the first night in Cancun with stomachaches.)

2219
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:27,480
(Day 5 of expedition)

2220
01:25:27,510 --> 01:25:31,520
(Current time: 10:30am)

2221
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:38,820
Where is everyone?

2222
01:25:39,660 --> 01:25:41,330
- Guys.
- Yes.

2223
01:25:42,830 --> 01:25:44,100
Are you guys okay?

2224
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:47,530
Hello.

2225
01:25:47,900 --> 01:25:49,800
Where are Kwang Soo and Kyung Soo?

2226
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:51,900
They're here.

2227
01:25:56,840 --> 01:25:57,840
Sorry.

2228
01:25:58,740 --> 01:26:02,580
(The aftereffect of the fierce battle last night)

2229
01:26:02,950 --> 01:26:04,150
Why are you sorry?

2230
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:06,396
It's not your fault that you had traveller's diarrhoea.

2231
01:26:06,420 --> 01:26:08,889
How could that happen to all three of you at the same time?

2232
01:26:08,890 --> 01:26:10,296
(They couldn't go on the whale shark tour in the end.)

2233
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:13,189
When I heard all three of you were having traveller's diarrhoea,

2234
01:26:13,190 --> 01:26:16,199
I gave you the antidiarrhoeal and expected you to be okay.

2235
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:17,330
But the situation...

2236
01:26:17,860 --> 01:26:20,030
The travel guide said...

2237
01:26:20,570 --> 01:26:22,129
- when you brush your teeth, - Right.

2238
01:26:22,130 --> 01:26:23,769
- that's why...
- With drinking water.

2239
01:26:23,770 --> 01:26:25,740
- With drinking water.
- Yes.

2240
01:26:26,010 --> 01:26:27,270
Did you just brush your teeth?

2241
01:26:27,410 --> 01:26:28,470
Yes.

2242
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:31,079
Because that's what we did in Mexico City.

2243
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:32,880
Right. You had no problem there.

2244
01:26:33,550 --> 01:26:35,409
Did diarrhoea stop, though?

2245
01:26:35,410 --> 01:26:36,779
- It stopped around 5am.
- We're okay now.

2246
01:26:36,780 --> 01:26:37,920
- At dawn?
- Yes.

2247
01:26:38,580 --> 01:26:41,050
- I'm better than last night.
- What?

2248
01:26:41,190 --> 01:26:43,619
The stomachache got so much better.

2249
01:26:43,620 --> 01:26:46,330
- It's better.
- But we all...

2250
01:26:46,660 --> 01:26:48,330
There's no more to excrete.

2251
01:26:50,130 --> 01:26:51,200
We...

2252
01:26:51,530 --> 01:26:53,830
- Woo Bin, you look haggard.
- He looks haggard.

2253
01:26:54,100 --> 01:26:55,229
It wasn't easy.

2254
01:26:55,230 --> 01:26:57,500
If we excrete anything, it'd be our intestines.

2255
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:01,339
It'd be our intestines.

2256
01:27:01,340 --> 01:27:03,010
(They emptied themselves.)

2257
01:27:03,810 --> 01:27:04,940
Now we...

2258
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:07,810
About the whale shark tour,

2259
01:27:08,050 --> 01:27:09,949
because we had to film it,

2260
01:27:09,950 --> 01:27:12,220
we made a lot of reservations.

2261
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:14,049
So when we called,

2262
01:27:14,050 --> 01:27:15,749
they told us to call back when we're available.

2263
01:27:15,750 --> 01:27:16,819
Really?

2264
01:27:16,820 --> 01:27:18,259
- Will he do that for us?
- Can we postpone it?

2265
01:27:18,260 --> 01:27:20,541
He told us to call him whether tomorrow or the day after.

2266
01:27:20,930 --> 01:27:22,359
- Tomorrow...
- We can go tomorrow.

2267
01:27:22,360 --> 01:27:23,360
Let's go tomorrow.

2268
01:27:23,361 --> 01:27:25,200
You can do what you want today.

2269
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:26,900
Then I think...

2270
01:27:27,330 --> 01:27:29,100
I should go see flamingos.

2271
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:31,700
Going to see flamingos?

2272
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,520
Kwang Soo, we should discuss it first.

2273
01:27:33,810 --> 01:27:35,840
What... Flamingo out of nowhere?

2274
01:27:35,870 --> 01:27:37,039
(The employees didn't know about the schedule.)

2275
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:39,480
- You didn't discuss it.
- It just came out.

2276
01:27:39,510 --> 01:27:40,949
It just came out.

2277
01:27:40,950 --> 01:27:43,119
I get that you like animals.

2278
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:46,389
- But you need to discuss it first.
- I don't care.

2279
01:27:46,390 --> 01:27:48,449
I'm going. I can't...

2280
01:27:48,450 --> 01:27:49,989
- But you have diarrhoea...
- It's far from here.

2281
01:27:49,990 --> 01:27:52,319
It takes seven hours back and forth to see flamingos.

2282
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:54,480
We have to buy large diapers at the supermarket first.

2283
01:27:55,190 --> 01:27:56,529
I'm serious.

2284
01:27:56,530 --> 01:27:57,959
What if there's no restroom on the way?

2285
01:27:57,960 --> 01:27:59,160
Buy diapers.

2286
01:28:01,700 --> 01:28:04,070
If you can't go, let's turn the wheels.

2287
01:28:04,740 --> 01:28:05,870
Let's turn the wheels.

2288
01:28:05,970 --> 01:28:07,439
Don't push yourselves.

2289
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:09,010
Just in case, in the car...

2290
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:11,439
If we make a mistake,

2291
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:13,650
promise me that you'll edit that out. I'm serious.

2292
01:28:14,410 --> 01:28:16,519
It's not just about editing it out.

2293
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:18,020
Don't disclose it anywhere.

2294
01:28:18,650 --> 01:28:20,120
Don't tell anyone.

2295
01:28:20,620 --> 01:28:21,690
Even to your family.

2296
01:28:24,290 --> 01:28:25,320
Will you do that?

2297
01:28:25,460 --> 01:28:27,390
Or we can't set a foot outside of here.

2298
01:28:27,890 --> 01:28:29,260
No.

2299
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:30,460
Or we can't go.

2300
01:28:31,230 --> 01:28:32,329
We can't even check out.

2301
01:28:32,330 --> 01:28:34,199
(After making a humane promise)

2302
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:35,230
I'll edit it out.

2303
01:28:36,770 --> 01:28:38,469
- Then...
- He'll edit it out.

2304
01:28:38,470 --> 01:28:40,210
- can we have that?
- What?

2305
01:28:40,570 --> 01:28:42,880
- What?
- Can we have a burger now?

2306
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:45,279
That's up to you.

2307
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:47,126
We should be okay because it's traveller's diarrhoea, right?

2308
01:28:47,150 --> 01:28:49,650
I looked it up. There's no Korean porridge place in Cancun.

2309
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:52,019
(Familiar food for breakfast)

2310
01:28:52,020 --> 01:28:53,020
Did you...

2311
01:28:53,850 --> 01:28:55,190
You already looked it up.

2312
01:28:55,450 --> 01:28:56,459
Okay.

2313
01:28:56,460 --> 01:28:59,760
Then I'll reserve it.

2314
01:28:59,860 --> 01:29:01,829
- Because the staff need to go too.
- Reserve it for now.

2315
01:29:01,830 --> 01:29:02,859
- I'll reserve it.
- Yes.

2316
01:29:02,860 --> 01:29:04,029
But you have to pay for it.

2317
01:29:04,030 --> 01:29:06,669
Sure. Woo Bin will talk to Jun Wi...

2318
01:29:06,670 --> 01:29:09,739
and settle it. Don't worry.

2319
01:29:09,740 --> 01:29:11,839
We didn't settle it yesterday.

2320
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:12,939
- We can settle everything together.
- Right.

2321
01:29:12,940 --> 01:29:14,410
- We have to hurry up.
- Let's go.

2322
01:29:14,670 --> 01:29:16,179
Okay. We'll wait outside.

2323
01:29:16,180 --> 01:29:17,180
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:29:25,180 --> 01:29:28,289
If I turn the hazard lights on and pull over,

2326
01:29:28,290 --> 01:29:30,820
just... Turn off all the cameras. I mean it.

2327
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:34,290
(Setting off to the next destination with anxiety)

2328
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:35,390
Everyone!

2329
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:38,430
(It's a 3-hour-long road trip.)

2330
01:29:38,700 --> 01:29:40,470
- One per person?
- Sounds good.

2331
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:43,000
(Buying snacks on the way is the fun of travelling.)

2332
01:29:43,270 --> 01:29:44,646
I've never seen a colour like this before.

2333
01:29:44,670 --> 01:29:45,740
Isn't this a spoon worm?

(CEO Ko's reply arrived.)

2347
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:18,499
It's red. Maybe he denied it?

2348
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:20,639
Turned down means it's rejected.

2349
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:21,769
(The expedition's special expenses were turned down?)

2350
01:30:21,770 --> 01:30:23,880
Why am I crying? What?

2351
01:30:24,410 --> 01:30:25,710
I can't laugh.

2352
