"we moved to 'Blank' in the afternoon..."

12
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,910
"of July 25, 2025."

13
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,910
"To reduce the production cost of eggiscoming,"

14
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:49,020
"we rented a lodging through Airbnb."

15
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,750
"This very lodging brings us..."

16
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:51,790
"to the current situation..."

17
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,690
"where the employees are exploring a different culture."

18
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:57,690
(They're writing a report they'll send to the head office.)

19
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,230

00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,660
at the bottom?

21
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:02,960
- At the bottom?
- Yes.

22
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,760
"CEO Ko, we'll be honest with you."

23
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:06,330
That sounds good.

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,700
"We're out of money."

25
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,100
"CEO Ko."

26
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:12,940
- I'll add two period marks.
- Okay.

27
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:14,570
Which one sounds better,

28
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:15,980
"We're out of money" or "We're broke?"

29
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,740
- "We're out of money." - "We're out of money."

30
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,950
"We're out of money."

31
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,150
"To give you an idea of the lodging..."

32
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,490
"where we're staying at..."

33
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,820
- "We'll attach documents." - Okay.

34
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,320
"We'll attach documents."

35
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,830
Let's write this as well.

36
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,960
What?

37
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,500
"Two staff members..."

38
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,300
"had a nosebleed yesterday."

39
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,630
- It's true.
- You're right.

40
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:43,370
You didn't take any photos of the nosebleed, did you?

41
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,740
We didn't take any photos.

42
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,270
Shall we take them now?

43
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,610
You just need to shove tissue paper up your nostril.

44
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,450
Then we'll be able to attach a photo.

45
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,750

47
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,050
"please be generous."

48
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,890
"If you send us the requested amount,"

49
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,660
"we won't use it for luxury. We'll explore the world..."

50
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,130
"and broaden our knowledge through parasailing..."

51
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,600
"and eating 'Blank' traditional food,"

52
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,000
"and prepare for the next season."

53
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,170
"We'll also broaden our views on fresh seafood..."

54
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,440
"through snorkelling."

55
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,110
(They asked for money in a very long-winded way.)

56
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,580
It's good.

57
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,580
It's good.

59
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,710

- Five thousand.
- Five thousand.

63
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,520

It's my first time entering this room.

77

- It has been a while.
- Really?

78
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,090
- This is my office.
- Of course.

79

80

the CEO of a big company just now.

- It really has been a while.
- Yes.

85
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,200
- It really has been a while.
- Has it been...

86
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,270
- a while?
- Yes.

87
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,240
In Season One, we farmed...

88
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,240
- under the scorching sun.
- That's right.

89
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,910
We filmed for three months.

90
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,540
To be honest, Season One was very hard.

91
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,680
Season One was very hard.

92
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,350
Then we decided to take a break and film a YouTube show.

93
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,450
But it wasn't a break.

94
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,950
- That's right.
- When we got started,

95
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,690
- we wanted to do well.
- Yes.

96
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,490
We cooked 200 servings of food.

97
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:16,460
Talking about such matters ourselves would've been...

98
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,690
a bit...

99
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,990
It would've been a bit unbecoming, so we kept quiet.

100
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,300
But we toiled away.

101
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,570
- Seriously.
- That's right.

102
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,800
Seriously.

103
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,500
You struggled a lot.

104
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,040
We said that you could do...

105
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,210
what you wanted for the next season.

106
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:34,610
We said that we'd listen to your ideas...

107
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:35,640
Yes.

108
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,680
For the production.

109
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,080
At the point...

110
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,650
where you can realise your wish,

111
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,650
you've made a request...

112
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,490
- to go on a trip together.
- Yes.

113
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,050
- Is that right?
- Yes, that's right.

114
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,320
Seriously.

115
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,920
- Does everyone agree?
- Yes.

116
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,060
We've been waiting for this.

117
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,560
- It sounds very nice.
- Hold on.

118
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,300
Which country did you visit recently?

119
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,530
Woo Bin, which country did you guys visit together...

120
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,130
- recently?
- Recently,

121
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,900
we went to Japan.

122
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,470
It's the closest country.

123
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,200
It's hard to come up with a time that works for everyone.

124
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,370
Also,

125
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,510
some people have a schedule in the middle of the trip.

126
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,640
- Then...
- That's right.

127
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,440
- They can go back and forth.
- They can leave early...

128
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,740
- or arrive late.
- Yes.

129
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,710
I also like vacation spots.

130
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,350
I like to lie down on the sandy beach...

131
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,350
and get tanned.

132
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,090
I like to gaze at the sea...

133
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,350
and read books.

134
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,120
Do you read books for real?

135
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,320
I read them for real.

136
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,620
Don't get me wrong.

137
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,060
I've travelled with you many times,

138
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,960
but I've never seen you read books.

139
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,600
- Which book did you read recently?
- Listen.

140
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,030
When I travel with older members...

141
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,570
Don't say "The Old Man and the Sea." Which book did you read?

142
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:33,700
We need to go over this matter.

143
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,140
There's no reason for you to lie from the start.

144
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,840
Which book did you read?

145
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,310
I don't read much.

146
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,470
I knew it.

147
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,480
Isn't it nice to be honest?

148
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,680
We're a family.

149
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,210
(Woo Bin likes to enjoy a vacation without reading.)

150
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:48,680
Kyung Soo, what do you like if it isn't for filming?

151
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,980
I don't really like vacation spots.

152
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:54,020
That kind of a destination doesn't suit me.

153
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:55,460
I'm talking about the sea...

154
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,790
that doesn't have anything.

155
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,430
When I travel,

156
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,130
food is very important.

157
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,760
As long as the food is tasty,

158
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,770
- I don't care where I go.
- So,

159
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,200
you're good as long as the food is tasty.

160
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,140
But even if there's tasty food you like,

161
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,600
- you'll only eat three times a day.
- Right.

162
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,840
I just want to sit and rest.

163
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,070
You want to stay at the hotel.

164
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,110
Yes, I like that.

165
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,710
When I call him, he tells me...

166
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,550
that he's sitting at home.

167
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,650
"You must be doing something."

168
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,450
"I'm just sitting and resting."

169
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:26,820
He just sits there...

170
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,350
like a rock.

171
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,790
At home...

172
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,490
At home, he just sits.

173
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,360
Kwang Soo, I don't sit still.

174
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,500
- I don't sit there like a rock.
- You do that.

175
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,270
Who sits like this...

176
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,200
at home?

177
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,870
- I watch something.
- You do that.

178
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,470
I'm not a rock.

179
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,640
That's ridiculous.

180
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,510
I just sit there...

181
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:50,210
to watch TV and YouTube.

182
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,410
That's what I do.

183
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,880
I don't sit there like a rock.

185
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,820
(They go outside after a brief conversation inside.)

186
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,860
Please take a seat.

187
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,390
- CEO Ko, hello.
- Hello.

188
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,530
My goodness.

189
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,930
- Please take a seat.
- Hello.

190
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,130
- Hello.
- Hello.

191
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,270
- Hello.
- Hello.

192
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,030
- Woo Bin, you haven't met him.
- No.

193
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,500
- He's CEO Ko.
- Nice to meet you.

194
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,070
- Woo Bin hasn't met him?
- Right. Only we've met him.

195
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,610
I didn't get to see him last time.

196
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,270
- I only saw you on TV.
- Yes.

197
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,110
- Seriously.
- Kwang Soo, look at that.

198
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,380
What's that?

199
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,610
(To the world! To the future!)

200
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,410
This is a company event.

201
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:28,580
(Kickoff ceremony for KKPP Foods' international cultural expedition)

202
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,150
- Today, - I love such things.

203
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,190
we'll have a proper ceremony.

204
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,650
- Let's take a seat.
- Okay.

205
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,190
I love such things.

206
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,860
Kyung Soo, please read it out loud.

207
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,560
"To the world! To the future!"

208
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,400
"Kickoff ceremony..."

209
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,830
"for KKPP Foods' international cultural expedition."

210
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,970
After exploring foreign cultures,

211
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,470
you'll come back...

212
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,710
- with broader views...
- Yes.

213
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,140
and experiences.

214
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,350
That way, we'll have another successful season...

215
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:02,350
- by implementing the ideas.
- That sounds good.

216
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,680
- Let's begin the kickoff ceremony.
- Okay.

217
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,450
Someone will be appointed to an important position.

218
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:09,520
- Yes.
- All right.

219
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,160
Auditor Kim Woo Bin, please come forward.

220
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,360
Is there an appointment certificate?

221
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,190
- What's this, Woo Bin?
- I don't know.

222
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,900
- Put on your jacket.
- Please come forward.

223
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,800
- You know...
- He needs to show manners.

224
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,570
He knows what to do.

225
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,710
Woo Bin's position used to be...

226
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,870
- an external auditor.
- Yes.

227
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,210
"Appointment certificate."

228
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,940
"Name, Kim Woo Bin."

229
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,510
"The person above..."

230
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,580
"made outstanding contributions throughout the duration..."

231
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,980
"of the GBRB project..."

232
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,150
"as an external auditor."

233
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,890
"From the second half of 2025,"

234
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:45,860
"he'll be appointed to the position of KKPP Foods' internal auditor."

235
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:49,660
"Ko Joong Seok of eggiscoming, June 5, 2025."

236
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,200
CEO Ko made many preparations.

237
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,540
Congratulations.

238
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:01,370
Thank you.

239
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:04,780
Thus, Auditor Kim Woo Bin...

240
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,680
has become a member...

241
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,550
- of KKPP Foods.
- Yes.

242
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,790
- Please explain what...
- He's an auditor.

243
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,450
- his position entails.
- He used to be an external auditor.

244
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,890
Let me explain what an external auditor does.

245
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,260
Each company gets operating results.

246
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,230
For example, it can be an income statement.

247
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,690
An external auditor studies it with the outside view...

248
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:24,400
to ensure that everything has been done well...

249
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,130
and check the credibility of the company.

250
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,770
By commercial law, an internal auditor...

251
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:33,910
- By commercial law...
- By what?

252
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,980
- What law?
- Commercial law.

253
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,240
- Corporate law.
- CEO Ko,

254
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,910
are you using big words on purpose?

255
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,450
Yes.

256
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,990
By commercial law, any company...

257
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,720
that has the capital of 1,000,000 dollars or more...

258
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,790
or that is publicly traded...

259
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,820
must have an internal auditor.

260
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,500
So, this appointment means...

261
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,230
that we'll grow KKPP Foods...

262
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,700
even further.

263
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,530
I believe we're at that point.

264
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,270
These two will make...

265
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,470
- decisions for the company.
- Right.

266
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,640
You'll see if they adhere to the company policies.

267
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,110
If not, you'll point it out.

268
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,580
- The position suits him well.
- It suits him well.

269
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,750
It suits Woo Bin's style.

270
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,080
- I think I'll do well.
- Also...

271
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,920
Firstly, I love it...

272
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,220
because we gained another person...

273
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,660
who can attack Kwang Soo.

274
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:29,460
The auditor is on my side.

275
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:30,630
He's on my side.

276
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,470
I think CEO Lee will lose to the two of us...

277
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,600
and follow our wishes because he has no other choice...

278
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,970
during this expedition.

279
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,070
(The office politics of KKPP Foods begin.)

280
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:43,410
All right. Now, we'll present the appointment letter.

281
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,480
All three members, please come forward.

282
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,380
"Appointment letter. KKPP Foods."

283
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,220
"The company above will appoint..."

284
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,390
"the group to the international cultural expedition..."

285
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,590
"for KKPP Foods' vision to train global individuals."

286
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:01,360
I'll deliver the appointment letter...

287
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,660
to Lee Kwang Soo.

288
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,770
We'll take a group photo.

289
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,530
One, two...

290
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,140
All done. Now,

291
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,970
congratulatory flowers will be delivered.

292
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,110
- This is...
- You're going abroad.

293
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,680
- This is too much.
- Congratulations.

294
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,280
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

295
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,780
You didn't have to do this.

296
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,450
- Congratulations.
- My goodness.

297
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,190
- Thank you.
- Let's take a group photo.

298
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,820
- Okay.
- It's a good occasion.

299
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,360
Let's go.

300
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,730
- Let's go.
- They're posing with spirits...

301
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,560
as if they're saying, "We'll do this."

302
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,660
Thank you. Please take a seat.

303
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,530
What are we doing?

304
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,170
Now,

305
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,740
we'll listen to the resolution of the employees...

306
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,640
who have been appointed as the expedition members.

307
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,380
From what I've heard so far,

308
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,010
it sounds fun.

309
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,250
So I don't know why I feel anxious.

310
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,890
Well, it's a trip.

311
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,350
Right? It'll be a trip, right?

312
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,520
Well, as long as the food is tasty...

313
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,630
- Okay.
- Any country will do.

314
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,590
"As long as the food is tasty, I don't care."

315
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,000
I don't care.

316
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,870
The internal auditor will tell us how it feels.

317
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:13,900
Okay.

318
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:16,540
I feel a bit pressured.

319
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,440
Still,

320
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:21,610
I'll stay diligent...

321
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,080
and explore cultures.

322
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,050
"I'll explore cultures diligently." Congratulations.

323
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,280
- I can say this with certainty.
- Okay.

324
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,050
Woo Bin isn't removing the flowers...

325
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,890
because the colours suit the jacket.

326
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,890
I'm serious. I'm certain of it.

327
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,620
- You can take them off.
- He likes such things.

328
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,660
We took the group photos already.

329
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,290
He likes them.

330
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,760
- It wasn't intentional, - We took...

331
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,260
- but the colours match.
- the group photos already.

332
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,230
- He likes the look.
- I see.

333
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,270
- Yes.
- He likes the look.

334
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,730
He's satisfied with the look.

335
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,200
- Lastly, we'll hear from the CEO.
- Okay.

336
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,940
You might not be aware, but we filmed "GBRB..."

337
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,080
and "GBRB: Cafeteria Operation..."

338
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,740
with a lot of hardships.

339
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,250
- I'm well aware of it.
- Okay.

340
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,880
So, it moves me to get rewarded for the hard work.

341
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,120
You finally understand how we feel.

342
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,350
Again, I sincerely thank the CEO...

343
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,720
and the employees.

344
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,020
We'll use this opportunity to broaden our views.

345
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,530
There'll be the next season.

346
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:17,100
For that season, we'll run forward without stopping.

347
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,070
(He gives a charismatic resolution for the expedition.)

348
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:22,400
I can tell that you're the CEO!

349
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:26,270
Lastly, we'll read...

350
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,280
the rules of the expedition.

351
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,510
The rules of the expedition.

352
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,810
- Are there rules?
- Let's take a look.

353
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:36,850
- CEO Lee, please read number 1.
- Number 1.

354
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,150
"Number one, the international cultural expedition is..."

355
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,620
"a journey to receive ideas and inspirations..."

356
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,120
"for the future development of KKPP Foods."

357
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,090
"Our expedition is a trip..."

358
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,630
"in which we plan and solve problems ourselves."

359
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:51,230
"For flights, lodgings, destinations, restaurants,"

360
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,300
"public transportation,"

361
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,270
"and additional details and schedules of the trip..."

362
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:03,340
"will be reserved and paid for by our own means."

363
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,610
All right.

364
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,520
- Please read number three.
- What does that mean?

365
00:14:13,556 --> 00:14:15,986
"Will be reserved and paid for by our own means."

366
00:14:17,286 --> 00:14:18,326
All right.

367
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:22,196
- Please read number three.
- What does that mean?

368
00:14:22,626 --> 00:14:25,696
"The production crew will only record and refrain..."

369
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:28,636
"from getting involved in any means."

370
00:14:28,796 --> 00:14:30,166
- That's...
- When a company or a college...

371
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,536
send people on an expedition,

372
00:14:31,606 --> 00:14:33,136
- the participants...
- Do they do everything themselves?

373
00:14:33,136 --> 00:14:35,076
decide on where to go.

374
00:14:35,076 --> 00:14:37,546
It'll be absurd for us to make decisions ourselves.

375
00:14:37,546 --> 00:14:38,906
How about the country?

376
00:14:39,176 --> 00:14:40,916
- You'll decide on...
- It's right here.

377
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,786
the country today...

378
00:14:42,946 --> 00:14:45,586
and book the flight tickets today.

379
00:14:47,056 --> 00:14:49,456
CEO Ko, please explain the situation...

380
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:51,226
with the travel expenses.

381
00:14:51,786 --> 00:14:53,396
There are some internal rules.

382
00:14:53,396 --> 00:14:54,696
(Travel expenses are important.)

383
00:14:55,456 --> 00:14:57,196
"Article One, Purpose."

384
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:59,636
"The purpose of these rules is to decide on..."

385
00:14:59,636 --> 00:15:01,996
"the standards of giving out the travel expenses..."

386
00:15:02,096 --> 00:15:05,066
"when KKPP Foods employees go abroad on business."

387
00:15:05,106 --> 00:15:07,276
"Two. The expenses will be commensurate with the position."

388
00:15:07,276 --> 00:15:08,506
- That's nice.
- Yes.

389
00:15:09,646 --> 00:15:11,276
(CEO: 10,000 dollars Auditor and Director: 4,000 dollars)

390
00:15:11,276 --> 00:15:13,016
There's a big difference.

391
00:15:13,016 --> 00:15:15,576
- Yes.
- It can't be helped...

392
00:15:15,646 --> 00:15:16,646
when you're in a company.

393
00:15:16,646 --> 00:15:18,216
The difference is 6,000 dollars.

394
00:15:18,286 --> 00:15:19,816
Well,

395
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,456
the difference can't be helped...

396
00:15:22,456 --> 00:15:23,986
- due to the positions.
- Okay.

397
00:15:24,026 --> 00:15:27,456
- That's right.
- All companies pay expenses...

398
00:15:27,456 --> 00:15:28,696
that are commensurate with position.

399
00:15:28,696 --> 00:15:30,496
- That's right.
- Thus...

400
00:15:30,626 --> 00:15:33,136
CEO Lee Kwang Soo agrees wholeheartedly.

401
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,196
I do.

402
00:15:34,196 --> 00:15:35,966
- If you look over here, - Okay.

403
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:38,506
the CEO will get about 6,000 dollars...

404
00:15:38,506 --> 00:15:41,776
- to fly business.
- Okay.

405
00:15:41,776 --> 00:15:43,776
The CEO will get 100 dollars for activities,

406
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,576
100 dollars for food, and 200 dollars for lodging.

407
00:15:46,816 --> 00:15:49,846
Thus, the total will be 10,000 dollars.

408
00:15:50,046 --> 00:15:51,486
- Okay.
- Kwang Soo,

409
00:15:51,486 --> 00:15:52,716
give us 1,000 dollars each for the flight.

410
00:15:52,716 --> 00:15:54,556
- Then we have 3,000 dollars each.
- Yes, you should do that.

411
00:15:54,556 --> 00:15:56,426
- But that's...
- That's a good idea.

412
00:15:56,426 --> 00:15:57,456
rude to the CEO.

413
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,626
To be honest, I never thought of you as the CEO.

414
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:00,696
That makes you the bad one.

415
00:16:00,696 --> 00:16:02,096
That's your fault. How is that my fault?

416
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:04,066
What kind of an employee...

417
00:16:04,066 --> 00:16:05,596
- says that directly?
- I...

418
00:16:05,596 --> 00:16:07,936
- cooked and did everything.
- Do you want to get fired?

419
00:16:08,696 --> 00:16:10,836
That's no way to talk to the CEO.

420
00:16:11,506 --> 00:16:14,236
- But this is too...
- Don't be like that.

421
00:16:14,906 --> 00:16:16,876
You'll destroy the morale in the company.

422
00:16:18,446 --> 00:16:19,716
Rules are rules.

423
00:16:20,576 --> 00:16:23,746
I think people should stick to them.

424
00:16:24,486 --> 00:16:26,386
The production crew should get involved.

425
00:16:27,156 --> 00:16:29,386
In soccer games, there are fouls.

426
00:16:29,386 --> 00:16:30,756
Offside is prohibited.

427
00:16:30,886 --> 00:16:32,826
They keep trying to put themselves in an offside position.

428
00:16:33,656 --> 00:16:38,026
I absolutely refuse to give all that money to him.

429
00:16:38,496 --> 00:16:39,696
That was the first thought I had.

430
00:16:39,696 --> 00:16:41,066
We have to split it equally.

431
00:16:42,136 --> 00:16:43,266
We have to split it equally.

432
00:16:45,236 --> 00:16:48,606
Are we not allowed to use...

433
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,376
our own money?

434
00:16:51,376 --> 00:16:52,476
It'd go against the purpose.

435
00:16:52,776 --> 00:16:54,476
- Let's not use our own money.
- That's right.

436
00:16:54,476 --> 00:16:56,146
- Let's stay in this bracket.
- It's best not to use it.

437
00:16:56,586 --> 00:16:59,156
However, it could be unavoidable.

438
00:16:59,156 --> 00:17:01,786
We can request the special expenses.

439
00:17:01,786 --> 00:17:03,326
You can ask CEO Ko directly.

440
00:17:03,326 --> 00:17:05,326
But the name is...

441
00:17:05,326 --> 00:17:06,796
special expenses.

442
00:17:06,796 --> 00:17:07,926
The reason must be special.

443
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:09,796
What if there's special food we want to eat?

444
00:17:10,266 --> 00:17:11,966
What's a special situation?

445
00:17:11,966 --> 00:17:13,466
CEO Ko, how about this?

446
00:17:13,636 --> 00:17:15,066
They arrive at their destination...

447
00:17:15,466 --> 00:17:17,366
and find a Michelin-starred restaurant.

448
00:17:17,866 --> 00:17:19,236
"I want to try their food..."

449
00:17:19,236 --> 00:17:21,936
"and use my experience for the next season."

450
00:17:22,106 --> 00:17:25,176
- "I want to help the show." - That sounds nice.

451
00:17:25,606 --> 00:17:27,276
- Would that work?
- In that case,

452
00:17:27,276 --> 00:17:29,916
- you should give us a written oath.
- A written oath?

453
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,216
Say that you have a meal there.

454
00:17:32,216 --> 00:17:34,086
But what if you don't actually use it in next season?

455
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:35,256
You seem a lot more spiteful...

456
00:17:35,256 --> 00:17:36,556
since we last saw each other.

457
00:17:37,286 --> 00:17:38,386
Even a written oath?

458
00:17:38,386 --> 00:17:39,626
We could just make a verbal promise.

459
00:17:39,696 --> 00:17:41,826
What is considered special...

460
00:17:41,826 --> 00:17:43,726
should be proven objectively.

461
00:17:43,726 --> 00:17:45,166
Here's an example, which I won't do.

462
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,766
For example, skydiving.

463
00:17:47,696 --> 00:17:49,936
- There aren't many opportunities...
- True.

464
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:51,166
- for us to try it.
- Right.

465
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:53,836
It can help broaden our knowledge.

466
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:55,636
How can skydiving...

467
00:17:55,976 --> 00:17:57,106
broaden your knowledge?

468
00:17:57,606 --> 00:17:59,146
Why do you have to say it so coldly?

469
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:01,576
- No, listen.
- Really.

470
00:18:01,576 --> 00:18:02,986
When you broaden your knowledge...

471
00:18:02,986 --> 00:18:04,916
- Did I...
- Couldn't you have...

472
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,056
Did I make it sound a bit petty?

473
00:18:06,056 --> 00:18:07,616
It'll help us become braver and...

474
00:18:07,756 --> 00:18:10,156
- encourage us to try new things.
- I see.

475
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:11,956
This could definitely happen.

476
00:18:11,956 --> 00:18:13,426
Say you have to run KKPP Foods.

477
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,456
But you're an introvert, and you want to overcome that.

478
00:18:15,556 --> 00:18:17,826
So, you decide to go skydiving.

479
00:18:17,966 --> 00:18:20,136
I'd let you do it.

480
00:18:20,136 --> 00:18:21,196
But in return,

481
00:18:21,196 --> 00:18:23,006
your personality would have to change.

482
00:18:23,406 --> 00:18:24,536
Wait.

483
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:26,136
Are you saying we'd have to...

484
00:18:26,136 --> 00:18:28,176
write an oath saying our personalities will change?

485
00:18:28,176 --> 00:18:29,176
No.

486
00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:30,776
How could we write an oath?

487
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:32,376
- I mean...
- An oath...

488
00:18:32,376 --> 00:18:33,576
about our personalities changing?

489
00:18:34,776 --> 00:18:35,986
No, I...

490
00:18:36,146 --> 00:18:37,216
(Thinking)

491
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:38,286
Isn't this...

492
00:18:38,286 --> 00:18:40,386
Just a while ago, you said we were a family.

493
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:42,116
But now you want our personalities to change?

494
00:18:42,156 --> 00:18:43,656
It must be something special.

495
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:44,956
I'm not that...

496
00:18:44,956 --> 00:18:46,556
(I'm not that...)

497
00:18:46,556 --> 00:18:48,056
uptight.

498
00:18:48,696 --> 00:18:50,066
No, you are uptight.

499
00:18:51,366 --> 00:18:52,426
He's right.

500
00:18:53,096 --> 00:18:55,436
In that case,

501
00:18:55,436 --> 00:18:57,036
- I'll leave it to Kim Woo Bin, - Yes?

502
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:59,576
- I see.
- the internal auditor.

503
00:18:59,836 --> 00:19:02,406
I can't make all the decisions...

504
00:19:02,406 --> 00:19:04,506
- and be with you everywhere you go, - No.

505
00:19:04,506 --> 00:19:05,776
- so he'll take charge.
- Okay.

506
00:19:05,946 --> 00:19:07,576
However, receipts.

507
00:19:07,816 --> 00:19:09,146
Please keep the receipts.

508
00:19:09,146 --> 00:19:10,616
- The auditor should...
- Yes.

509
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,046
- handle them.
- The auditor.

510
00:19:12,046 --> 00:19:13,716
- Please collect them.
- You're good at that.

511
00:19:14,216 --> 00:19:15,586
It'll be my first time.

512
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:17,986
Honestly, this will be a first.

513
00:19:17,986 --> 00:19:19,256
Even at gatherings,

514
00:19:19,456 --> 00:19:21,296
I've never been the manager.

515
00:19:21,296 --> 00:19:22,526
- Really?
- Yes.

516
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,066
And these days,

517
00:19:25,066 --> 00:19:27,136
we hardly even get paper receipts.

518
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:29,436
I'm worried...

519
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:31,266
I might lose some.

520
00:19:32,436 --> 00:19:33,676
I'm starting to feel the pressure now.

521
00:19:33,676 --> 00:19:35,536
(He now feels the weight of being an auditor.)

522
00:19:35,536 --> 00:19:37,776
First, we'll deposit 18,000 dollars...

523
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:40,076
into the auditor's bank account, right?

524
00:19:40,076 --> 00:19:41,146
- Really?
- Into the auditor's bank.

525
00:19:41,476 --> 00:19:42,646
- The pressure is immense.
- Woo Bin.

526
00:19:42,646 --> 00:19:44,216
We don't have to comply.

527
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:45,486
- It's your bank account.
- You're right.

528
00:19:45,486 --> 00:19:46,516
But...

529
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:48,956
Can't you just split the money three ways?

530
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:51,486
Is there really a need to...

531
00:19:51,886 --> 00:19:54,426
- As I mentioned earlier, - Really.

532
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:57,366
the CEO will make the decision.

533
00:19:57,366 --> 00:19:59,066
But it's the auditor's job...

534
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:00,466
to use the money efficiently.

535
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:02,166
- Kwang Soo.
- I think it'd be best...

536
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:04,106
- if you split the money.
- Just forget about this.

537
00:20:04,206 --> 00:20:05,536
Just ignore this paper.

538
00:20:06,236 --> 00:20:08,706
No, as the CEO, I'm saying...

539
00:20:08,936 --> 00:20:10,306
you should split the money...

540
00:20:10,946 --> 00:20:12,176
and deposit it into each of our accounts.

541
00:20:12,176 --> 00:20:14,446
Normally, CEOs aren't...

542
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:16,546
How should I put it? A common word would be...

543
00:20:16,546 --> 00:20:18,086
- They aren't that lame.
- Right?

544
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:21,216
Usually...

545
00:20:22,386 --> 00:20:23,456
Listen.

546
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,856
Are you saying he's right?

547
00:20:28,856 --> 00:20:30,366
- No, listen.
- Did I hear him correctly?

548
00:20:30,366 --> 00:20:32,666
No, I...

549
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:35,436
Does "lame" mean something different from what I know?

550
00:20:35,436 --> 00:20:37,536
I may or may not have explained the objective clearly.

551
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,376
To be honest,

552
00:20:39,376 --> 00:20:41,876
the CEO...

553
00:20:42,236 --> 00:20:43,546
should save face.

554
00:20:44,506 --> 00:20:48,346
What kind of CEO asks for the money to be split?

555
00:20:48,646 --> 00:20:49,746
It's absurd.

556
00:20:49,746 --> 00:20:51,446
I'm sure Kwang Soo...

557
00:20:51,446 --> 00:20:53,686
was just trying to be funny.

558
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:55,356
Everyone has their own role.

559
00:20:55,356 --> 00:20:57,386
If...

560
00:20:58,086 --> 00:21:00,196
there are benefits,

561
00:21:00,256 --> 00:21:01,356
I should enjoy them...

562
00:21:01,356 --> 00:21:02,726
on a personal level.

563
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:04,666
I don't think that's lame.

564
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:05,866
(The CEO was serious.)

565
00:21:05,966 --> 00:21:08,366
With this, we'll end the kickoff ceremony.

566
00:21:08,366 --> 00:21:10,906
- Great work.
- Thank you.

567
00:21:10,906 --> 00:21:12,436
- We'll be back safe.
- Okay.

568
00:21:12,436 --> 00:21:13,436
We'll make sure to broaden our knowledge.

569
00:21:13,436 --> 00:21:14,436
Okay. Please do so.

570
00:21:14,436 --> 00:21:16,846
I'm sure you won't regret it, okay?

571
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:19,776
You won't regret spending the money on us.

572
00:21:20,476 --> 00:21:21,476
I'm so embarrassed.

573
00:21:21,476 --> 00:21:22,516
(The kickoff ceremony is over.)

574
00:21:23,146 --> 00:21:24,546
I received the 18,000 dollars.

575
00:21:24,546 --> 00:21:28,386
(GBRB: Joy Pops Laugh Pops)

576
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:30,256
- Let's decide on this first, guys.
- Okay.

577
00:21:30,256 --> 00:21:31,286
So...

578
00:21:32,556 --> 00:21:33,996
Personally,

579
00:21:34,656 --> 00:21:37,396
I don't want us to go to a nearby country.

580
00:21:37,426 --> 00:21:39,966
- Because...
- What a declaration.

581
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:41,596
We've always gone...

582
00:21:41,596 --> 00:21:44,236
- to nearby countries as a group.
- True.

583
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:45,306
- Countries we couldn't go to...
- Okay.

584
00:21:45,306 --> 00:21:47,476
Let's go to a country we can only visit because of this chance.

585
00:21:47,676 --> 00:21:50,006
- I want us to go somewhere far.
- Right.

586
00:21:50,006 --> 00:21:51,106
And...

587
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:52,846
I want us to eliminate countries we've already been to.

588
00:21:53,046 --> 00:21:54,546
Yes, somewhere we haven't been to.

589
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:55,976
- I'm in.
- Nice.

590
00:21:57,646 --> 00:21:59,816
You felt proud of yourself just now, didn't you?

591
00:22:00,756 --> 00:22:02,016
- Because...
- The reaction, right?

592
00:22:02,016 --> 00:22:03,326
That punk...

593
00:22:05,786 --> 00:22:08,896
It felt like forever since he last agreed to what I said.

594
00:22:08,956 --> 00:22:10,466
I don't know why, but I got emotional.

595
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:13,166
It wasn't anything special, so why?

596
00:22:13,896 --> 00:22:16,236
Let's take out the countries we've already been to.

597
00:22:16,236 --> 00:22:17,866
- Okay.
- Give me a pen.

598
00:22:18,106 --> 00:22:21,406
Take out the Philippines. I was there for a month for a shoot.

599
00:22:23,276 --> 00:22:25,446
Take these places out too, like France.

600
00:22:25,446 --> 00:22:26,446
"France?"

601
00:22:26,876 --> 00:22:28,716
It's a bummer to take France out.

602
00:22:28,776 --> 00:22:30,546
How about we ask ChatGPT?

603
00:22:30,586 --> 00:22:32,016
- That's a good idea.
- Yes.

604
00:22:32,746 --> 00:22:35,056
Add to the prompt that we don't have much budget.

605
00:22:36,016 --> 00:22:37,356
Make it give us a list within it.

606
00:22:37,726 --> 00:22:38,986
- Thailand and Vietnam.
- No.

607
00:22:38,986 --> 00:22:40,256
- No Japan.
- No.

608
00:22:40,256 --> 00:22:41,956
We decided to take out Australia.

609
00:22:41,956 --> 00:22:43,166
A different vibe.

610
00:22:43,626 --> 00:22:46,466
- A what?
- Does it have a vibe of some sort?

611
00:22:46,466 --> 00:22:47,466
Is it alive?

612
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:49,366
"An exotic and mysterious country."

613
00:22:49,366 --> 00:22:50,606
- Morocco?
- Morocco?

614
00:22:50,606 --> 00:22:51,766
- "A desert tour?" - "A desert tour?"

615
00:22:52,236 --> 00:22:53,536
That's indeed interesting.

616
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:55,776
Give me another vibe.

617
00:22:57,306 --> 00:22:59,176
It'll give you the whole world.

618
00:23:00,076 --> 00:23:02,316
I like that. "Extreme survival trip for men."

619
00:23:02,346 --> 00:23:04,246
- Norway.
- No way.

620
00:23:04,246 --> 00:23:05,816
- Backpacking the Rocky Mountains.
- No.

621
00:23:05,816 --> 00:23:07,816
How about backpacking the Rocky Mountains?

622
00:23:08,216 --> 00:23:09,886
- No.
- At this rate...

623
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:13,426
You don't even go mountain climbing.

624
00:23:13,426 --> 00:23:15,056
But honestly, this is...

625
00:23:15,056 --> 00:23:16,426
our one and only chance to go.

626
00:23:16,426 --> 00:23:17,866
"The trip for real men,"

627
00:23:17,866 --> 00:23:19,266
"lighting fires and cooking food."

628
00:23:19,426 --> 00:23:22,136
Let's keep that as an option and find a new one.

629
00:23:22,136 --> 00:23:23,136
Let's write it down somewhere.

630
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,166
Where was it again? Norway?

631
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:26,006
- "Wi-fi." - We have this too, Kwang Soo.

632
00:23:26,006 --> 00:23:27,606
- A trip with no wi-fi.
- "Digital detox trip."

633
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:28,936
- Nice.
- Myanmar or Nepal's...

634
00:23:28,936 --> 00:23:30,676
- Himalaya Lodge Resort.
- What's a detox trip?

635
00:23:30,676 --> 00:23:32,146
It's a world without wi-fi.

636
00:23:32,246 --> 00:23:33,576
"A voluntary retreat,"

637
00:23:33,576 --> 00:23:35,246
"morning bells, starlight at night,"

638
00:23:35,246 --> 00:23:37,346
"meditation, reading, and quiet conversations."

639
00:23:37,586 --> 00:23:39,956
How's the food...

640
00:23:40,156 --> 00:23:41,316
in Myanmar?

641
00:23:41,316 --> 00:23:42,786
(Food matters the most for Director Doh Kyung Soo.)

642
00:23:42,786 --> 00:23:43,856
The food.

643
00:23:44,026 --> 00:23:45,426
Honestly, this is...

644
00:23:45,686 --> 00:23:46,996
It's making our hearts pound.

645
00:23:46,996 --> 00:23:48,656
But the whole staff...

646
00:23:48,856 --> 00:23:50,566
is at their wits' end right now.

647
00:23:51,066 --> 00:23:53,266
- What do you think about it?
- The retreat?

648
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:55,336
- There's one you'll like.
- What is it?

649
00:23:55,396 --> 00:23:57,066
- "A trip with animals." - Where?

650
00:23:57,136 --> 00:23:58,666
- It sounds dangerous.
- "A safari tour..."

651
00:23:58,736 --> 00:23:59,836
"in South Africa."

652
00:23:59,976 --> 00:24:01,036
"The big five."

653
00:24:01,036 --> 00:24:03,146
"Elephants, lions, buffalo, leopards, and rhinos."

654
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:05,076
"Sleeping in the wild."

655
00:24:05,476 --> 00:24:07,176
"A morning safari vehicle tour."

656
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:08,846
Let's write that down.

657
00:24:09,546 --> 00:24:11,216
But the flights are expensive.

658
00:24:12,446 --> 00:24:13,756
We can sleep there.

659
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:16,586
You'll end up getting eaten by the lions.

660
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:18,556
That won't happen.

661
00:24:19,556 --> 00:24:21,856
If it's over 6,000 dollars per person,

662
00:24:21,856 --> 00:24:24,366
we'll use up the 18,000-dollar budget on flight tickets.

663
00:24:24,366 --> 00:24:25,796
It'll be the end for you two, but not me.

664
00:24:27,996 --> 00:24:29,136
Seriously?

665
00:24:29,136 --> 00:24:31,366
(The auditor sensed the CEO's risk for a second.)

666
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:32,606
How about this one?

667
00:24:32,606 --> 00:24:33,636
"Not just a friendship trip,"

668
00:24:33,636 --> 00:24:36,006
"but a once-in-a-lifetime big bromance trip."

669
00:24:36,006 --> 00:24:37,106
I'm in.

670
00:24:37,546 --> 00:24:39,206
Big bromance trip?

671
00:24:39,506 --> 00:24:41,546
- It's Mexico. "Eat tacos," - Is that so?

672
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:44,016
- "surf at the Caribbean Sea," - Nice.

673
00:24:44,016 --> 00:24:45,586
"from Mexico City..."

674
00:24:45,586 --> 00:24:47,216
"to Guanajuato to Cancun."

675
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:48,956
Big bromance trip.

676
00:24:49,016 --> 00:24:51,256
I love that phrase.

677
00:24:51,926 --> 00:24:53,596
Don't you want to visit a cold country?

678
00:24:53,596 --> 00:24:54,756
Since it's hot right now.

679
00:24:59,026 --> 00:25:00,066
No cold countries?

680
00:25:00,066 --> 00:25:01,136
No.

681
00:25:02,336 --> 00:25:04,066
(The auditor gives a cold reaction.)

682
00:25:04,066 --> 00:25:05,236
How about this one?

683
00:25:05,236 --> 00:25:06,806
What was that look just now?

684
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,236
But you hate the cold.

685
00:25:09,506 --> 00:25:11,246
- What did you write down?
- What's on our list?

686
00:25:11,446 --> 00:25:12,506
The Rocky Mountains in Canada,

687
00:25:12,506 --> 00:25:13,776
Myanmar, Nepal,

688
00:25:13,776 --> 00:25:15,676
or Mexico's big bromance trip.

689
00:25:16,546 --> 00:25:18,046
Let's find two more places.

690
00:25:18,346 --> 00:25:19,686
There are plenty of countries.

691
00:25:19,686 --> 00:25:21,586
- Only writing down three is...
- Right.

692
00:25:22,456 --> 00:25:23,926
How about Mongolia?

693
00:25:24,186 --> 00:25:25,356
You haven't been to Mongolia, right?

694
00:25:25,586 --> 00:25:27,396
- No.
- Exactly.

695
00:25:28,696 --> 00:25:29,826
Where's your answer?

696
00:25:30,326 --> 00:25:32,466
Acting like you didn't hear me when I'm right beside you.

697
00:25:33,296 --> 00:25:34,836
- What do you think about Mongolia?
- It hurts.

698
00:25:35,736 --> 00:25:38,036
The culture shock when you spend a night in a ger.

699
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:41,506
First, gers, the movable tents used by Mongolian nomads,

700
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:43,106
have shared traditional-style toilets...

701
00:25:43,106 --> 00:25:44,406
and no separate shower facilities.

702
00:25:44,406 --> 00:25:47,276
But thanks to the warm heater...

703
00:25:47,446 --> 00:25:48,546
Let's check out a different country.

704
00:25:48,616 --> 00:25:50,546
(Withdrawing voluntarily due to bathroom issues)

705
00:25:50,616 --> 00:25:51,886
What do you think about Mexico?

706
00:25:52,586 --> 00:25:54,216
- No?
- What about Denmark?

707
00:25:54,516 --> 00:25:55,956
- Where's Denmark?
- Why do you keep avoiding...

708
00:25:55,956 --> 00:25:57,756
- Mexico whenever we bring it up?
- Exactly.

709
00:25:57,756 --> 00:26:00,226
I just want us to make a list and choose from it.

710
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:02,296
But you're not against Mexico, right?

711
00:26:02,296 --> 00:26:03,666
I'm not.

712
00:26:03,666 --> 00:26:05,466
The problem is that there are better places.

713
00:26:05,466 --> 00:26:07,296
Shall I search for Denmark?

714
00:26:08,036 --> 00:26:09,166
Copenhagen.

715
00:26:09,166 --> 00:26:11,306
- Denmark is really expensive.
- It's expensive, Kwang Soo.

716
00:26:11,766 --> 00:26:12,766
(Nerve-racking moment)

717
00:26:12,766 --> 00:26:15,006
(Tagging the credit card)

718
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:16,106
The toll is...

719
00:26:16,106 --> 00:26:18,206
Is it 270 krone? Is it krone?

720
00:26:18,206 --> 00:26:20,216
- How much is that?
- Did you say 270?

721
00:26:20,216 --> 00:26:21,546
That's 55 dollars.

722
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:22,716
No way, Kwang Soo.

723
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,546
The toll is 55 dollars?

724
00:26:26,246 --> 00:26:28,716
Our daily food expenses are 50 dollars.

725
00:26:29,456 --> 00:26:30,886
The food could be good.

726
00:26:30,986 --> 00:26:32,056
Where?

727
00:26:32,056 --> 00:26:33,126
Portugal.

728
00:26:33,796 --> 00:26:35,296
Apparently, it's a food paradise.

729
00:26:35,456 --> 00:26:36,696
- Portugal?
- Yes.

730
00:26:37,726 --> 00:26:39,126
Let's choose from the list.

731
00:26:39,466 --> 00:26:40,766
Let's search for one more country.

732
00:26:41,836 --> 00:26:43,136
How about a cold country?

733
00:26:43,806 --> 00:26:45,806
How cold? Like, completely cold?

734
00:26:45,806 --> 00:26:47,376
Is Finland expensive too?

735
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:48,706
Give me a second.

736
00:26:49,206 --> 00:26:50,676
Search up Norway.

737
00:26:52,046 --> 00:26:53,946
It's Greenland.

738
00:26:54,476 --> 00:26:55,746
"Kayaking on ice,"

739
00:26:55,746 --> 00:26:57,446
"a chance of encountering polar bears..."

740
00:26:57,516 --> 00:26:58,686
Norway is...

741
00:26:59,546 --> 00:27:00,656
- Kwang Soo.
- Polar bears...

742
00:27:00,656 --> 00:27:01,986
- Enough.
- What?

743
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:05,486
How about this country?

744
00:27:05,486 --> 00:27:06,696
The one just below Argentina.

745
00:27:09,826 --> 00:27:11,426
Kyung Soo looks so worn out now.

746
00:27:12,496 --> 00:27:14,396
His eyes are losing focus.

747
00:27:15,496 --> 00:27:16,936
- How about this place?
- Kwang Soo.

748
00:27:16,936 --> 00:27:17,936
(The CEO has been asking for 2 hours.)

749
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:19,106
How about New Zealand?

750
00:27:20,076 --> 00:27:21,136
Okay, let's go to New Zealand.

751
00:27:23,906 --> 00:27:25,346
What's with you?

752
00:27:25,746 --> 00:27:26,776
Seriously.

753
00:27:27,316 --> 00:27:28,676
Do you need to wash your face?

754
00:27:30,846 --> 00:27:32,346
I'm fine with any country now.

755
00:27:32,446 --> 00:27:33,616
Take a look at New Zealand.

756
00:27:33,616 --> 00:27:34,916
Yes, it looks great.

757
00:27:36,356 --> 00:27:38,656
Let's go. They have the aurora.

758
00:27:39,056 --> 00:27:40,356
Let's go to New Zealand.

759
00:27:40,456 --> 00:27:41,496
What do you think?

760
00:27:41,796 --> 00:27:42,796
I'm in.

761
00:27:45,596 --> 00:27:46,636
Is it New Zealand?

762
00:27:48,196 --> 00:27:49,466
Let's decide.

763
00:27:49,496 --> 00:27:51,306
Who goes on a trip like that?

764
00:27:51,766 --> 00:27:53,576
Go take a nap or something.

765
00:27:54,576 --> 00:27:55,636
What about Iceland?

766
00:27:55,876 --> 00:27:57,846
- It's cold.
- Right.

767
00:27:58,646 --> 00:27:59,676
Cuba?

768
00:28:00,516 --> 00:28:01,516
It's hot.

769
00:28:02,346 --> 00:28:04,716
- Yeong Seok, what's with you?
- What?

770
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:05,986
I'm only answering your question.

771
00:28:05,986 --> 00:28:07,786
Tell us something positive.

772
00:28:07,816 --> 00:28:09,786
You were the one asking.

773
00:28:10,426 --> 00:28:11,786
How about this, Kwang Soo?

774
00:28:12,126 --> 00:28:14,326
Let's draw a country and go there.

775
00:28:14,326 --> 00:28:15,726
Who goes on a trip like that?

776
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,626
- I think it's a good idea.
- I'm in.

777
00:28:17,626 --> 00:28:20,066
We should eliminate countries after a discussion.

778
00:28:20,336 --> 00:28:22,136
How long will we continue that discussion?

779
00:28:22,196 --> 00:28:23,806
Let's take out some countries now.

780
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,006
From here?

781
00:28:25,006 --> 00:28:26,506
After we eliminate some countries,

782
00:28:26,506 --> 00:28:28,776
do we draw a country?

783
00:28:28,776 --> 00:28:29,776
Hold on.

784
00:28:29,776 --> 00:28:30,806
(Sighing)

785
00:28:33,716 --> 00:28:36,246
(You've been choosing a country for 2 hours.)

786
00:28:36,516 --> 00:28:37,586
Seriously.

787
00:28:40,016 --> 00:28:41,356
When will we decide?

788
00:28:41,756 --> 00:28:44,686
It's always like this.

789
00:28:45,826 --> 00:28:49,996
In the end, we go where I choose.

790
00:28:51,266 --> 00:28:52,366
I believe...

791
00:28:53,026 --> 00:28:55,636
this is the charm of going on a trip.

792
00:28:55,636 --> 00:28:58,236
Deciding where to go, giving opinions,

793
00:28:58,466 --> 00:29:00,706
combining them, and searching.

794
00:29:01,376 --> 00:29:04,046
Temperatures and such.

795
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:08,676
It's one of the factors that make a trip fun.

796
00:29:09,316 --> 00:29:11,286
(1. The Rocky Mountains in Canada: Backpacking,)

797
00:29:11,286 --> 00:29:12,346
(2. Myanmar or Nepal: No phones, 3. Mexico: Big bromance trip,)

798
00:29:12,346 --> 00:29:13,386
(4. Portugal, 5. Peru, 6. New Zealand)

799
00:29:13,386 --> 00:29:16,216
(GBRB: Joy Pops Laugh Pops)

800
00:29:16,756 --> 00:29:18,156
Let's try this out.

801
00:29:18,526 --> 00:29:20,956
Out of the five countries on the list,

802
00:29:21,196 --> 00:29:23,196
let's each rank them.

803
00:29:23,426 --> 00:29:25,296
- Each of us?
- Yes, rank them.

804
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:26,526
(1. Mexico, 2. Peru, 3. Portugal)

805
00:29:29,496 --> 00:29:32,906
(Ranking them with full honesty)

806
00:29:33,506 --> 00:29:34,776
- Are you done?
- Yes.

807
00:29:35,776 --> 00:29:37,406
In 1, 2, 3.

808
00:29:40,076 --> 00:29:41,616
It's different.

809
00:29:42,116 --> 00:29:43,816
It's all different. Kwang Soo...

810
00:29:44,846 --> 00:29:46,346
"Never Canada."

811
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:49,586
Kwang Soo's first choice is Canada,

812
00:29:49,616 --> 00:29:51,286
but Kyung Soo wrote, "Never Canada."

813
00:29:51,286 --> 00:29:53,226
- "Never Canada?" - We must take it off our list.

814
00:29:53,926 --> 00:29:55,626
It's a must. Take it off our list.

815
00:29:55,626 --> 00:29:57,496
From what I see, you're the problem.

816
00:29:57,766 --> 00:29:59,226
- Why don't the two of you go?
- You read my mind.

817
00:30:00,936 --> 00:30:02,296
Why are we going as three?

818
00:30:03,166 --> 00:30:04,266
You're not being considerate.

819
00:30:05,606 --> 00:30:08,306
How about we ask the staff members?

820
00:30:08,706 --> 00:30:09,976
Like voting.

821
00:30:10,106 --> 00:30:11,776
- Let's reflect that in our ranking.
- Okay.

822
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:13,246
- All right.
- Because...

823
00:30:13,246 --> 00:30:14,976
Either way, we must all go together.

824
00:30:14,976 --> 00:30:16,016
Let's do that.

825
00:30:16,016 --> 00:30:18,086
Why don't we have another vote with those three?

826
00:30:18,486 --> 00:30:19,716
Okay, with three countries.

827
00:30:19,716 --> 00:30:21,116
- Okay?
- Mexico, Portugal...

828
00:30:21,116 --> 00:30:22,416
Let's leave two final countries.

829
00:30:22,886 --> 00:30:23,886
- Okay.
- Two.

830
00:30:23,886 --> 00:30:25,456
Like the World Cup?

831
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:27,296
Yes, after we look into it more.

832
00:30:27,296 --> 00:30:29,156
Let's look into one of the countries more carefully.

833
00:30:29,656 --> 00:30:30,696
Sorry?

834
00:30:32,596 --> 00:30:34,596
- Look.
- By the way,

835
00:30:34,936 --> 00:30:37,206
we don't need to vote, so can we put Canada back in?

836
00:30:37,206 --> 00:30:38,306
No.

837
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:40,036
- Then...
- Will you never visit Canada?

838
00:30:41,336 --> 00:30:43,906
(Mexico, Portugal, Peru, Canada)

839
00:30:43,906 --> 00:30:46,006
(In the end, Canada is back on the list.)

840
00:30:50,946 --> 00:30:52,016
Where's that?

841
00:30:52,086 --> 00:30:53,216
Canada. The Rockies.

842
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:55,286
- Gosh.
- Nice.

843
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:56,986
- Honestly, - It's indeed nice.

844
00:30:56,986 --> 00:30:58,726
if we don't go this time, we'll never go there.

845
00:30:58,726 --> 00:31:00,756
(Now that they see it, it's actually nice.)

846
00:31:01,096 --> 00:31:02,226
Gosh.

847
00:31:02,256 --> 00:31:03,396
Goodness, that's nice.

848
00:31:03,396 --> 00:31:04,466
We get to sleep in...

849
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:05,926
- Kwang Soo.
- Focus.

850
00:31:05,926 --> 00:31:08,296
(The staff who weren't focusing are scolded.)

851
00:31:08,436 --> 00:31:09,636
This is paradise.

852
00:31:11,266 --> 00:31:13,506
I get why you're obsessed with Canada.

853
00:31:13,776 --> 00:31:15,136
Let's watch another country.

854
00:31:16,136 --> 00:31:18,446
(A video of Mexico plays next.)

855
00:31:18,446 --> 00:31:20,276
It's totally different from Canada.

856
00:31:20,876 --> 00:31:22,646
It's not completely nature-friendly.

857
00:31:22,646 --> 00:31:23,816
The city is...

858
00:31:26,316 --> 00:31:27,656
It's a nice country for photos.

859
00:31:27,656 --> 00:31:30,156
(A biased commentary)

860
00:31:30,156 --> 00:31:31,726
(Why are you obsessed with Canada?)

861
00:31:31,726 --> 00:31:32,856
Shall I say that...

862
00:31:33,186 --> 00:31:34,826
it's coming from a mother's heart?

863
00:31:36,296 --> 00:31:39,296
Making my picky eater son eat vegetables...

864
00:31:39,396 --> 00:31:41,136
because it's good for the body.

865
00:31:41,796 --> 00:31:45,066
Telling him he'll understand how good it is later on.

866
00:31:45,366 --> 00:31:47,936
That's how I feel.

867
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:49,376
Even if I must use a can,

868
00:31:50,846 --> 00:31:51,946
I want to experience...

869
00:31:53,176 --> 00:31:54,546
the good together.

870
00:31:54,916 --> 00:31:56,816
I'm sure they'll thank me...

871
00:31:57,546 --> 00:31:58,786
for all the great memories.

872
00:31:59,946 --> 00:32:01,386
In three,

873
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:03,556
raise your hand if you'd like to go to Canada.

874
00:32:03,656 --> 00:32:04,926
One, two, three.

875
00:32:05,086 --> 00:32:06,086
One.

876
00:32:06,456 --> 00:32:07,826
- Are we raising hands too?
- Two.

877
00:32:07,826 --> 00:32:09,056
Three, four. Four in total.

878
00:32:09,056 --> 00:32:10,196
(Canada: 4 people)

879
00:32:10,696 --> 00:32:12,926
Let's vote for Peru. In 1, 2, and 3.

880
00:32:14,296 --> 00:32:15,296
One.

881
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:16,566
Next, Portugal.

882
00:32:16,566 --> 00:32:17,806
One, two, three.

883
00:32:18,206 --> 00:32:19,636
You must vote. Everyone votes for Mexico?

884
00:32:19,636 --> 00:32:21,906
Gosh. Mexico in 1, 2, and 3.

885
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:23,276
I vote for Mexico.

886
00:32:24,246 --> 00:32:25,446
- This is...
- Canada.

887
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:27,376
One more for Canada, so five in total.

888
00:32:28,116 --> 00:32:29,746
Canada got quite a few votes.

889
00:32:29,846 --> 00:32:30,946
- Portugal had no votes.
- Canada.

890
00:32:30,946 --> 00:32:32,486
- Canada.
- Another Canada.

891
00:32:32,716 --> 00:32:34,456
Canada. For real?

892
00:32:35,156 --> 00:32:36,856
Again for Canada.

893
00:32:36,856 --> 00:32:39,626
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Ten people.

894
00:32:40,896 --> 00:32:42,026
Let's go to Canada.

895
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:44,426
- Ten for Canada.
- Don't mind us, okay?

896
00:32:44,426 --> 00:32:46,226
- Don't mind us.
- Write ten down.

897
00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:48,596
Do we have votes for Mexico? In 1, 2, and 3.

898
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,336
- Six.
- Six people.

899
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:53,836
With that, we're going to Canada.

900
00:32:56,676 --> 00:32:58,006
(Mexico: 6, Peru: 1, Canada: 10)

901
00:32:58,106 --> 00:32:59,976
But the staff members'...

902
00:32:59,976 --> 00:33:01,216
- Yes, we don't count.
- opinions...

903
00:33:01,216 --> 00:33:03,216
Our votes are just for reference.

904
00:33:03,616 --> 00:33:05,516
- Between Mexico and Canada?
- Yes.

905
00:33:07,616 --> 00:33:08,786
It's suddenly down to two.

906
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:10,126
We're nervous too.

907
00:33:12,186 --> 00:33:13,226
Kyung Soo.

908
00:33:13,356 --> 00:33:15,696
How would you feel if we said...

909
00:33:15,696 --> 00:33:17,526
- we're going to Mexico?
- I'd be happy.

910
00:33:17,526 --> 00:33:18,766
You will?

911
00:33:19,226 --> 00:33:20,896
- Woo Bin.
- Yes.

912
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:24,166
How would you feel if we said we're going to Canada?

913
00:33:26,736 --> 00:33:28,006
I'd be okay with it.

914
00:33:29,206 --> 00:33:31,876
- Right? It's...
- I wouldn't be happy,

915
00:33:32,676 --> 00:33:34,246
but I wouldn't be unhappy either.

916
00:33:35,716 --> 00:33:36,746
What about Mexico?

917
00:33:37,386 --> 00:33:38,386
I'd be happy.

918
00:33:41,756 --> 00:33:46,056
(For the KKPP Foods employees, it's 2 for Mexico and 1 for Canada.)

919
00:33:46,256 --> 00:33:47,596
Let's do this, okay?

920
00:33:47,596 --> 00:33:49,096
The majority vote between the three of us.

921
00:33:50,366 --> 00:33:51,926
No, hold on.

922
00:33:53,026 --> 00:33:54,366
That's not what a trip is.

923
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:55,996
Let's search more countries.

924
00:33:55,996 --> 00:33:58,406
- My gut is telling me...
- Yes?

925
00:33:59,036 --> 00:34:02,376
we'd get another chance to go to Canada.

926
00:34:02,376 --> 00:34:03,846
We're talking about the Rocky Mountains.

927
00:34:03,846 --> 00:34:04,876
Will you go there?

928
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,646
Everyone goes there if you choose Canada.

929
00:34:07,646 --> 00:34:09,646
But when it comes to Mexico,

930
00:34:09,646 --> 00:34:12,346
it gives off a feeling we won't get a second chance.

931
00:34:12,516 --> 00:34:13,516
- Exactly.
- Right?

932
00:34:13,516 --> 00:34:16,016
And Mexico suits the expedition team more.

933
00:34:16,256 --> 00:34:18,156
- Yes.
- There's a lot we can...

934
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:19,986
- get out of it.
- Nice one.

935
00:34:19,986 --> 00:34:21,956
- Are you sure?
- That was nice.

936
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:23,456
- What I said was right, no?
- Well,

937
00:34:23,456 --> 00:34:24,896
you can learn how to make tacos...

938
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,966
and even make them in Gangwon Province.

939
00:34:25,966 --> 00:34:27,036
Exactly.

940
00:34:27,796 --> 00:34:30,936
We must not lose our identity, Kwang Soo.

941
00:34:30,936 --> 00:34:33,266
- Gosh.
- Good one.

942
00:34:33,266 --> 00:34:35,206
- Aren't I right?
- Canada's honey.

943
00:34:35,276 --> 00:34:37,446
Are you looking down on Canada's maple syrup?

944
00:34:39,476 --> 00:34:41,276
- Maple syrup and...
- Canada...

945
00:34:41,276 --> 00:34:43,516
has nature but also a city right next to it.

946
00:34:43,646 --> 00:34:45,546
- You can experience polar extremes.
- Kwang Soo.

947
00:34:45,546 --> 00:34:47,356
But Canada's prices are expensive.

948
00:34:47,456 --> 00:34:48,656
We have CEO Ko, don't we?

949
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:52,486
He and I are close.

950
00:34:54,126 --> 00:34:55,996
How about we go to Canada, then Mexico?

951
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:00,026
It's not impossible.

952
00:35:00,026 --> 00:35:01,736
I thought it'd be far, but it's not.

953
00:35:01,836 --> 00:35:02,866
It looks far.

954
00:35:03,196 --> 00:35:05,366
- What?
- Because...

955
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:06,766
It takes 4.5 hours.

956
00:35:06,766 --> 00:35:09,276
But it takes about 5.5 hours from Vancouver.

957
00:35:10,906 --> 00:35:12,546
That's like going to Jeju Island.

958
00:35:13,846 --> 00:35:14,916
Almost, okay?

959
00:35:14,916 --> 00:35:17,286
(The CEO's love for Canada has gone beyond space and time.)

960
00:35:17,986 --> 00:35:19,116
Let's just go to Canada.

961
00:35:20,356 --> 00:35:21,756
I don't want to go like that.

962
00:35:23,086 --> 00:35:26,156
Kwang Soo, for real. Don't try to be funny.

963
00:35:26,456 --> 00:35:28,326
I'm not trying to be funny.

964
00:35:29,326 --> 00:35:31,226
I don't want to make anyone laugh right now.

965
00:35:33,566 --> 00:35:35,436
How is this funny? I'm serious.

966
00:35:36,766 --> 00:35:38,566
Is your first choice Canada?

967
00:35:38,736 --> 00:35:40,036
Are you dying to go to Canada?

968
00:35:41,076 --> 00:35:42,406
If we go to Mexico and Canada...

969
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:43,536
That's impossible.

970
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:46,576
Why not go to Mexico first,

971
00:35:46,746 --> 00:35:47,916
and then think about it?

972
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:53,516
Fine. Let's go to Mexico first.

973
00:35:54,286 --> 00:35:56,486
To Mexico City first? Should we book our flights?

974
00:35:56,886 --> 00:35:58,186
- Yes.
- Agreed?

975
00:35:58,256 --> 00:35:59,486
I'm in so much pain right now.

976
00:35:59,856 --> 00:36:02,556
This situation where we can't come to a decision is...

977
00:36:04,166 --> 00:36:06,196
- Agreed?
- Let's book our flights first.

978
00:36:06,196 --> 00:36:07,666
- To Mexico City first.
- Okay.

979
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:08,836
A round of applause.

980
00:36:09,696 --> 00:36:13,166
(Their expedition country is Mexico.)

981
00:36:13,566 --> 00:36:14,736
The sun has set.

982
00:36:15,736 --> 00:36:16,976
Your phone.

983
00:36:16,976 --> 00:36:19,176
It took us four hours to choose a country.

984
00:36:19,176 --> 00:36:20,516
(Why the change of heart?)

985
00:36:20,976 --> 00:36:22,476
Parents have a soft spot for their children.

986
00:36:23,316 --> 00:36:24,916
The two of them were dying to go.

987
00:36:24,946 --> 00:36:28,386
I couldn't be heartless and insist on it.

988
00:36:28,556 --> 00:36:30,426
Everyone being happy is what's best.

989
00:36:31,086 --> 00:36:33,826
It'd be a lie if I said I didn't make any sacrifices.

990
00:36:33,826 --> 00:36:34,856
I don't want to lie to myself.

991
00:36:34,856 --> 00:36:36,026
I made a sacrifice.

992
00:36:37,866 --> 00:36:40,536
Honestly, even if it's alone,

993
00:36:40,996 --> 00:36:42,096
I wish to go...

994
00:36:43,636 --> 00:36:46,636
to the Rocky Mountains and see the glaciers.

995
00:36:47,906 --> 00:36:50,406
We'll take the 11:40am flight from Incheon.

996
00:36:50,646 --> 00:36:52,176
The flight back will be in the evening.

997
00:36:52,346 --> 00:36:53,846
We'll arrive at dawn in Incheon.

998
00:36:53,846 --> 00:36:55,346
- That's why it's plus two days.
- Yes.

999
00:36:55,946 --> 00:36:58,316
Then I'll book these tickets, okay?

1000
00:36:58,986 --> 00:37:00,656
How about this?

1001
00:37:00,856 --> 00:37:02,616
Either way, our staff...

1002
00:37:03,116 --> 00:37:06,186
must look into our flight tickets.

1003
00:37:06,186 --> 00:37:08,396
- Right.
- It's not just you three going.

1004
00:37:08,456 --> 00:37:10,126
It's fine as long as...

1005
00:37:10,126 --> 00:37:12,166
- you give us the flight fees.
- True.

1006
00:37:13,026 --> 00:37:15,536
How many days will we spend...

1007
00:37:15,536 --> 00:37:17,806
in Mexico City after arriving on the 22nd?

1008
00:37:17,806 --> 00:37:19,706
- Two nights and three days?
- Three nights?

1009
00:37:19,706 --> 00:37:20,906
- That sounds good.
- How about three nights?

1010
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:22,376
- Two nights are too short.
- I'm in.

1011
00:37:22,776 --> 00:37:24,006
(Checking Mexico City lodging options)

1012
00:37:24,006 --> 00:37:25,106
It's super cheap.

1013
00:37:25,106 --> 00:37:26,106
Why is it so cheap?

1014
00:37:26,846 --> 00:37:28,446
- How about this place?
- Nice.

1015
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:29,916
- Even the view is nice.
- It is nice.

1016
00:37:30,416 --> 00:37:32,986
There's even a sofa, like this.

1017
00:37:33,586 --> 00:37:34,786
Let's just go there.

1018
00:37:35,116 --> 00:37:36,116
- Let's go here, Kwang Soo.
- What is it?

1019
00:37:36,116 --> 00:37:37,426
What's the name of the hotel?

1020
00:37:37,856 --> 00:37:39,186
What's the name of the hotel?

1021
00:37:39,186 --> 00:37:40,596
Are you going because of the sofa?

1022
00:37:41,196 --> 00:37:42,326
Because Kyung Soo needs a place...

1023
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:44,166
where he can turn into a rock.

1024
00:37:44,966 --> 00:37:46,226
- He needs to sit there?
- Yes.

1025
00:37:46,226 --> 00:37:48,096
Let's check the location on the map.

1026
00:37:48,236 --> 00:37:49,566
It's right in front of the roundabout.

1027
00:37:49,566 --> 00:37:50,606
- What?
- That's good.

1028
00:37:50,836 --> 00:37:52,406
Here,

1029
00:37:52,406 --> 00:37:54,536
if we can save here,

1030
00:37:56,136 --> 00:37:58,246
it will be almost 70 dollars.

1031
00:37:58,346 --> 00:38:00,206
I was also shocked just now.

1032
00:38:00,246 --> 00:38:02,676
- It's actually too good to be true.
- It's such a good price.

1033
00:38:02,676 --> 00:38:04,746
- I'm also wondering if it's a scam.
- Yes.

1034
00:38:05,086 --> 00:38:06,716
And even the location...

1035
00:38:06,716 --> 00:38:08,886
- is right in the middle.
- It's even in a good area.

1036
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:10,586
But it's this price?

1037
00:38:10,686 --> 00:38:12,026
That's so odd.

1038
00:38:12,686 --> 00:38:14,656
It might also be this reason.

1039
00:38:14,696 --> 00:38:15,826
There are times...

1040
00:38:16,156 --> 00:38:18,026
- when it's cheaper sometimes.
- Yes.

1041
00:38:18,026 --> 00:38:19,096
- Right?
- Yes.

1042
00:38:20,096 --> 00:38:21,166
- It's this one, right?
- What? Is it 197 dollars?

1043
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:22,196
It's 197 dollars.

1044
00:38:22,196 --> 00:38:23,196
See?

1045
00:38:23,336 --> 00:38:24,536
What?

1046
00:38:24,706 --> 00:38:26,466
See? It becomes cheaper.

1047
00:38:26,466 --> 00:38:27,906
It's 236 dollars here,

1048
00:38:27,906 --> 00:38:29,236
but it shows as 190 dollars here.

1049
00:38:29,506 --> 00:38:31,246
How much more did we save already?

1050
00:38:31,246 --> 00:38:32,506
That's 40 dollars saved.

1051
00:38:32,506 --> 00:38:34,746
You see, 4 times 3 is 12. We saved 120 dollars with just this.

1052
00:38:35,976 --> 00:38:38,616
I'll look up Michelin-starred restaurants in Mexico.

1053
00:38:38,786 --> 00:38:39,916
(KKPP Foods uses up free money right away.)

1054
00:38:39,916 --> 00:38:41,316
Let's do it right away.

1055
00:38:42,356 --> 00:38:43,416
The payment went through.

1056
00:38:44,626 --> 00:38:45,826
- Did it?
- Yes.

1057
00:38:47,356 --> 00:38:48,556
Just like that?

1058
00:38:48,556 --> 00:38:49,756
We're really going.

1059
00:38:50,566 --> 00:38:52,496
We have to go to Mexico City now.

1060
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:53,596
Did it go through?

1061
00:38:53,596 --> 00:38:54,836
Let's clap, Kwang Soo.

1062
00:38:58,736 --> 00:38:59,936
We really did something huge.

1063
00:38:59,936 --> 00:39:01,506
Hurry up and book that place.

1064
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:02,936
- Yes, we need to book it.
- Book it.

1065
00:39:02,936 --> 00:39:04,106
- Where is it?
- Other rooms.

1066
00:39:04,106 --> 00:39:06,106
(You're going to Mexico?)

1067
00:39:06,106 --> 00:39:07,776
Even if we go to Mexico,

1068
00:39:08,776 --> 00:39:11,116
I think there will be a lot of things...

1069
00:39:11,546 --> 00:39:13,486
that everyone wants,

1070
00:39:13,986 --> 00:39:15,616
like nature, and others.

1071
00:39:15,856 --> 00:39:17,686
I think we should look mainly...

1072
00:39:17,686 --> 00:39:19,486
in the Cancun area.

1073
00:39:19,586 --> 00:39:22,726
I actually used to travel...

1074
00:39:22,726 --> 00:39:24,426
without having a plan,

1075
00:39:24,426 --> 00:39:26,096
other than the food.

1076
00:39:26,096 --> 00:39:29,396
But Kwang Soo wants some nature scenes,

1077
00:39:29,396 --> 00:39:31,566
so I will be looking that up.

1078
00:39:31,906 --> 00:39:33,436
And I know for a fact...

1079
00:39:33,466 --> 00:39:36,576
that the food is good there.

1080
00:39:37,376 --> 00:39:38,776
I want to eat...

1081
00:39:38,846 --> 00:39:40,976
the local tacos there.

1082
00:39:41,076 --> 00:39:43,776
I'm really curious about the taste.

1083
00:39:43,776 --> 00:39:45,546
(The expedition team has some expectations now.)

1084
00:39:45,946 --> 00:39:48,816
I never thought that I'd be able to visit Mexico.

1085
00:39:48,816 --> 00:39:50,416
(United States of America, Mexico)

1086
00:39:50,416 --> 00:39:52,926
(Day of departure)

1087
00:39:53,786 --> 00:39:55,056
What? Kwang Soo.

1088
00:39:55,156 --> 00:39:57,366
- Hey.
- Why are you so early?

1089
00:39:58,866 --> 00:40:00,226
Hello.

1090
00:40:00,996 --> 00:40:02,496
It does feel like I'm going on a trip.

1091
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:05,806
What?

1092
00:40:05,806 --> 00:40:06,966
Hello.

1093
00:40:07,136 --> 00:40:08,236
What's wrong with your teeth?

1094
00:40:08,236 --> 00:40:09,336
Because of another shoot.

1095
00:40:10,006 --> 00:40:11,546
Do you have to keep that on?

1096
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,506
- I have to keep it on.
- Really?

1097
00:40:13,506 --> 00:40:14,746
Seriously?

1098
00:40:15,176 --> 00:40:16,516
It's attached permanently.

1099
00:40:17,446 --> 00:40:19,316
(The CEO's teeth are a bit much.)

1100
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:20,446
You're lying.

1101
00:40:21,416 --> 00:40:23,086
And your shoes are...

1102
00:40:24,426 --> 00:40:26,086
(Even his shoes are a bit much.)

1103
00:40:26,086 --> 00:40:27,156
How could you...

1104
00:40:27,156 --> 00:40:29,396
be so blatant about it? You're making me shy.

1105
00:40:29,396 --> 00:40:31,066
- Your shoes...
- Make it natural.

1106
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:33,426
Well...

1107
00:40:34,796 --> 00:40:36,566
You're even zooming in?

1108
00:40:38,066 --> 00:40:40,406
Are you going to wear that for the trip?

1109
00:40:40,406 --> 00:40:41,506
Yes.

1110
00:40:44,146 --> 00:40:45,546
Don't do that.

1111
00:40:46,146 --> 00:40:47,846
Make it natural.

1112
00:40:50,046 --> 00:40:51,386
Some books.

1113
00:40:51,946 --> 00:40:53,486
- You bought something?
- Really?

1114
00:40:53,686 --> 00:40:55,186
This. "Cancun."

1115
00:40:56,786 --> 00:40:57,926
"Mexico City."

1116
00:40:58,156 --> 00:41:00,926
Since we have quite some time on the plane.

1117
00:41:01,096 --> 00:41:03,626
(While the CEO goes over the educational resources...)

1118
00:41:03,626 --> 00:41:05,226
- Woo Bin.
- Is he here?

1119
00:41:06,026 --> 00:41:10,466
(They go out to greet the auditor.)

1120
00:41:10,466 --> 00:41:11,936
- He's here.
- Hello.

1121
00:41:12,906 --> 00:41:14,106
Are you serious?

1122
00:41:18,006 --> 00:41:19,476
Are you serious?

1123
00:41:19,676 --> 00:41:20,816
No way.

1124
00:41:23,016 --> 00:41:24,116
Hey.

1125
00:41:25,116 --> 00:41:26,846
Since this is a new season,

1126
00:41:28,056 --> 00:41:29,316
for the viewers,

1127
00:41:30,386 --> 00:41:32,586
I wanted to do my best.

1128
00:41:34,126 --> 00:41:35,226
Seriously?

1129
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:36,296
To show respect.

1130
00:41:37,156 --> 00:41:38,396
Thank you.

1131
00:41:38,396 --> 00:41:41,036
(His respect is a bit much.)

1132
00:41:41,036 --> 00:41:42,696
- Are you serious?
- Really...

1133
00:41:42,866 --> 00:41:45,606
(The CEO comes out after hearing that the auditor is here.)

1134
00:41:46,766 --> 00:41:47,806
This is...

1135
00:41:48,336 --> 00:41:49,876
What's wrong with him?

1136
00:41:49,976 --> 00:41:52,206
Hey, this is a new season.

1137
00:41:53,946 --> 00:41:56,346
Give me a heads-up before you do these kinds of things.

1138
00:41:56,546 --> 00:41:58,046
If we go on a trip,

1139
00:41:58,046 --> 00:42:00,416
I thought I wouldn't be able to pay respect to our viewers,

1140
00:42:00,546 --> 00:42:01,716
so I did my best.

1141
00:42:01,716 --> 00:42:03,356
- To show them now?
- Yes.

1142
00:42:03,356 --> 00:42:04,426
Until we get on the plane.

1143
00:42:04,426 --> 00:42:06,656
Up until right before the immigration check.

1144
00:42:07,226 --> 00:42:08,826
Even if it's embarrassing.

1145
00:42:10,256 --> 00:42:12,426
- This shows real effort.
- For sure.

1146
00:42:12,526 --> 00:42:15,936
We should have called the press to the airport.

1147
00:42:15,936 --> 00:42:17,166
You could face...

1148
00:42:17,406 --> 00:42:18,936
a flood of hate comments...

1149
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:20,536
you've never experienced.

1150
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:24,376
You're being desperate to be noticed.

1151
00:42:27,206 --> 00:42:28,516
What's up with your socks?

1152
00:42:28,516 --> 00:42:29,716
- When you walk, - Yes?

1153
00:42:29,716 --> 00:42:31,516
could you not make those click-clack sounds?

1154
00:42:33,316 --> 00:42:34,816
You really look like...

1155
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:37,826
a freshly debuted magician...

1156
00:42:38,726 --> 00:42:40,626
who's struggling to get a show.

1157
00:42:42,696 --> 00:42:45,266
Like you're rushing to Mexico for a last-minute gig.

1158
00:42:46,026 --> 00:42:48,136
Like you're travelling there for three sleepless days.

1159
00:42:48,136 --> 00:42:50,096
That's why you have the outfit on starting here.

1160
00:42:50,906 --> 00:42:51,966
Kyung Soo is here.

1161
00:42:53,306 --> 00:42:54,536
- Hello.
- Hi.

1162
00:42:54,536 --> 00:42:55,736
- Hello.
- Hello.

1163
00:42:56,406 --> 00:42:57,946
- Kyung Soo.
- What?

1164
00:42:58,276 --> 00:42:59,376
Look at him.

1165
00:43:00,246 --> 00:43:01,916
- Look at him.
- Kyung Soo.

1166
00:43:01,916 --> 00:43:03,116
You have no respect today.

1167
00:43:03,116 --> 00:43:04,786
He woke up at 3:30am.

1168
00:43:05,586 --> 00:43:06,646
What happened?

1169
00:43:06,646 --> 00:43:07,956
Woo Bin.

1170
00:43:08,416 --> 00:43:09,956
You came up in your own clothes?

1171
00:43:11,826 --> 00:43:13,656
What's wrong with your eyebrows?

1172
00:43:14,626 --> 00:43:15,926
(Everyone's looks are a bit much today.)

1173
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:18,096
- These are my natural eyebrows.
- What about them?

1174
00:43:18,366 --> 00:43:19,426
I mean...

1175
00:43:19,566 --> 00:43:21,366
- How could you do this?
- Kyung Soo.

1176
00:43:21,366 --> 00:43:22,966
You have no respect at all.

1177
00:43:24,736 --> 00:43:26,436
No respect for the viewers.

1178
00:43:27,306 --> 00:43:29,006
We're going to the airport.

1179
00:43:29,576 --> 00:43:30,946
What are you going to do?

1180
00:43:31,076 --> 00:43:32,676
- Are you really going like this?
- He's changing in the restroom.

1181
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:33,876
He brought clothes to change into.

1182
00:43:33,876 --> 00:43:36,416
Right up until before the immigration check.

1183
00:43:36,416 --> 00:43:37,716
- Seriously?
- Sure.

1184
00:43:38,546 --> 00:43:40,146
You need to show respect, Kyung Soo.

1185
00:43:40,386 --> 00:43:41,516
I'm sorry.

1186
00:43:41,656 --> 00:43:42,786
- Apologise to them.
- Everyone,

1187
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:43,856
I'm sorry.

1188
00:43:44,886 --> 00:43:46,186
It's my fault.

1189
00:43:46,556 --> 00:43:49,196
I woke up 15 minutes earlier.

1190
00:43:50,026 --> 00:43:51,466
Both of you are absurd.

1191
00:43:51,466 --> 00:43:52,766
Both of you are absurd.

1192
00:43:53,766 --> 00:43:55,796
I gave it my best, too, though.

1193
00:43:55,796 --> 00:43:57,966
Before going to bed last night.

1194
00:43:58,336 --> 00:44:00,636
You did put in some effort compared to usual.

1195
00:44:00,636 --> 00:44:02,706
- You even wore long pants.
- Yes.

1196
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:04,576
I heard that it's cold in Mexico.

1197
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,746
I wore long pants in case I get cold.

1198
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:09,546
But seriously,

1199
00:44:09,676 --> 00:44:11,816
are you brave enough to go like that?

1200
00:44:11,916 --> 00:44:13,116
To be honest, I'm not confident.

1201
00:44:13,346 --> 00:44:15,916
(His respect goes up, but his confidence goes down.)

1202
00:44:16,116 --> 00:44:18,086
I really didn't look anything up.

1203
00:44:18,126 --> 00:44:19,256
Good job.

1204
00:44:20,056 --> 00:44:21,226
What's good about that?

1205
00:44:21,396 --> 00:44:23,396
(Nothing is set, as of now.)

1206
00:44:23,456 --> 00:44:25,066
So what are we going to do there?

1207
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:26,766
- There?
- I sent it to you.

1208
00:44:27,996 --> 00:44:29,196
I sent you a YouTube video.

1209
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:30,596
I didn't see it.

1210
00:44:31,566 --> 00:44:32,706
Why, you little...

1211
00:44:33,166 --> 00:44:34,276
I mean...

1212
00:44:34,476 --> 00:44:36,476
I sent it in our group chat.

1213
00:44:36,806 --> 00:44:38,876
You have no respect at all today.

1214
00:44:38,876 --> 00:44:40,306
No way.

1215
00:44:40,306 --> 00:44:42,016
(He upset the guy who is sensitive about respect.)

1216
00:44:42,116 --> 00:44:43,746
I brought some books.

1217
00:44:44,146 --> 00:44:46,216
- Books about Mexico?
- Travel books?

1218
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:47,716
We should see them on the plane.

1219
00:44:48,416 --> 00:44:49,456
I watched that as well.

1220
00:44:49,456 --> 00:44:50,986
"Backpack Travels."

1221
00:44:50,986 --> 00:44:52,886
- I saw that as well.
- Mexico.

1222
00:44:53,226 --> 00:44:54,796
- On the show...
- What did you see?

1223
00:44:54,796 --> 00:44:57,256
They showed the pyramids there.

1224
00:44:57,256 --> 00:44:58,566
- In Mexico?
- Yes.

1225
00:44:58,796 --> 00:45:01,196
- I wanted to see that.
- Right?

1226
00:45:01,196 --> 00:45:04,306
You can also see the pyramids on the ride.

1227
00:45:04,566 --> 00:45:06,006
- The hot-air balloon?
- Yes.

1228
00:45:06,506 --> 00:45:08,306
But if we want to ride the hot-air balloon,

1229
00:45:08,636 --> 00:45:11,076
don't we have to take the car for five hours?

1230
00:45:11,076 --> 00:45:12,406
No, that wasn't the hot-air balloon.

1231
00:45:12,406 --> 00:45:13,606
That was for the hike.

1232
00:45:14,616 --> 00:45:15,616
To go on the hike.

1233
00:45:15,616 --> 00:45:16,976
Let's not go on a hike.

1234
00:45:18,116 --> 00:45:19,716
I'm wearing these shoes for the hike.

1235
00:45:20,146 --> 00:45:21,356
Those are hiking shoes?

1236
00:45:21,386 --> 00:45:22,516
Those are hiking shoes?

1237
00:45:22,516 --> 00:45:25,256
I can use all my toes when I walk.

1238
00:45:25,786 --> 00:45:27,656
- These are trending these days.
- I want to try them on.

1239
00:45:27,656 --> 00:45:29,026
I'm not wearing them for the trend.

1240
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:30,056
Don't lie.

1241
00:45:30,056 --> 00:45:31,926
I'm serious. I didn't even know that they were trending.

1242
00:45:31,926 --> 00:45:33,196
I just heard that here.

1243
00:45:33,966 --> 00:45:35,336
I always had these shoes.

1244
00:45:35,336 --> 00:45:36,466
- Don't lie.
- Even since I was young.

1245
00:45:36,466 --> 00:45:38,066
- No, I'm serious.
- Since you were young?

1246
00:45:38,066 --> 00:45:39,206
I'm serious.

1247
00:45:40,036 --> 00:45:41,776
And we need to watch the wrestling match today.

1248
00:45:41,936 --> 00:45:43,136
- Today?
- Yes.

1249
00:45:43,536 --> 00:45:44,906
- The wrestling match.
- He's like a real CEO.

1250
00:45:44,906 --> 00:45:46,076
What wrestling match?

1251
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,306
Professional wrestling.

1252
00:45:47,476 --> 00:45:49,276
- Did you ever watch wrestling?
- He sent a link.

1253
00:45:49,416 --> 00:45:50,916
You didn't watch wrestling when you were young, right?

1254
00:45:50,916 --> 00:45:51,986
WWE?

1255
00:45:51,986 --> 00:45:53,786
- Do you have space?
- Give it to me.

1256
00:45:53,786 --> 00:45:55,156
I have space.

1257
00:45:55,686 --> 00:45:57,516
It will fit in here.

1258
00:45:58,556 --> 00:46:00,426
- Chicken breasts.
- How many did you bring?

1259
00:46:01,796 --> 00:46:03,226
I brought everything I had at home.

1260
00:46:04,266 --> 00:46:06,166
- Does it fit?
- It fits.

1261
00:46:11,406 --> 00:46:12,566
One, two, three.

1262
00:46:24,416 --> 00:46:25,746
It's annoying to see you sit back there...

1263
00:46:25,746 --> 00:46:26,846
when you're dressed like that.

1264
00:46:28,916 --> 00:46:29,956
Kwang Soo.

1265
00:46:30,016 --> 00:46:32,856
When I saw myself in the mirror in the bathroom,

1266
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:35,556
I thought to myself, "Should I just lose the bowtie?"

1267
00:46:36,496 --> 00:46:38,066
Let's get going.

1268
00:46:40,366 --> 00:46:41,496
See you later.

1269
00:46:42,436 --> 00:46:44,336
I brought the chicken breasts...

1270
00:46:44,336 --> 00:46:45,706
for our ride on the plane.

1271
00:46:45,706 --> 00:46:47,406
- Chicken breasts...
- For the plane ride?

1272
00:46:48,076 --> 00:46:50,076
Why would we want to eat that?

1273
00:46:50,276 --> 00:46:51,906
They give you the in-flight meal.

1274
00:46:51,906 --> 00:46:53,106
Aren't you going...

1275
00:46:53,176 --> 00:46:54,546
to eat them in addition?

1276
00:46:55,076 --> 00:46:56,146
"In addition?"

1277
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:57,276
(At this point, it's excessive.)

1278
00:46:57,476 --> 00:46:59,786
You have to eat them for sure.

1279
00:46:59,786 --> 00:47:00,886
(Gimpo Airport)

1280
00:47:02,016 --> 00:47:04,186
When we get to the airport,

1281
00:47:04,426 --> 00:47:05,786
we need to check again...

1282
00:47:05,786 --> 00:47:07,696
about our daily budget.

1283
00:47:07,896 --> 00:47:09,756
Kwang Soo had 600 dollars.

1284
00:47:10,356 --> 00:47:12,366
We can disregard that now.

1285
00:47:12,366 --> 00:47:14,166
- We need to keep that.
- So...

1286
00:47:14,166 --> 00:47:15,466
- Wasn't it 300 dollars each...
- That was the rule.

1287
00:47:15,466 --> 00:47:17,196
in the end?

1288
00:47:17,196 --> 00:47:18,666
That wasn't the rule, Kwang Soo.

1289
00:47:18,666 --> 00:47:19,736
It was a guideline.

1290
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:20,906
Just give me my money.

1291
00:47:21,336 --> 00:47:22,876
I'm the treasurer.

1292
00:47:24,236 --> 00:47:25,376
You're just the bank.

1293
00:47:28,046 --> 00:47:29,676
Your customer wants to withdraw the money.

1294
00:47:33,046 --> 00:47:35,786
Honestly, I can't quite picture Mexico.

1295
00:47:35,916 --> 00:47:37,686
Since you don't have much information?

1296
00:47:37,886 --> 00:47:40,086
I just looked it up recently since we were going.

1297
00:47:40,086 --> 00:47:42,726
- Right.
- Until now, Mexico was...

1298
00:47:43,396 --> 00:47:44,926
just about the picture...

1299
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:47,766
on those snacks.

1300
00:47:47,936 --> 00:47:49,196
Did they have a picture of Mexico?

1301
00:47:49,196 --> 00:47:50,236
The one with the hat.

1302
00:47:51,006 --> 00:47:52,836
- I don't remember that.
- This hat.

1303
00:47:52,836 --> 00:47:54,006
(The CEO got to know Mexico in a unique way.)

1304
00:47:54,236 --> 00:47:56,336
What kind of animals are famous in Mexico?

1305
00:47:57,106 --> 00:47:58,406
They have these in Mexico.

1306
00:47:59,446 --> 00:48:01,516
Alligators and flamingoes.

1307
00:48:02,216 --> 00:48:03,716
The whale shark tour.

1308
00:48:04,016 --> 00:48:05,346
- In the ocean?
- Yes.

1309
00:48:05,346 --> 00:48:07,186
(They now have things to see in Mexico.)

1310
00:48:07,516 --> 00:48:09,086
We're going to have tacos today, right?

1311
00:48:09,216 --> 00:48:10,316
We have to, for sure.

1312
00:48:10,316 --> 00:48:12,586
The tripe tacos are really famous in Mexico.

1313
00:48:12,826 --> 00:48:14,126
- The intestines?
- Yes.

1314
00:48:14,556 --> 00:48:16,056
And they say the Coke is really good.

1315
00:48:16,196 --> 00:48:17,326
- What?
- Coke.

1316
00:48:18,796 --> 00:48:20,196
Isn't Coke the same?

1317
00:48:20,826 --> 00:48:21,996
Aren't they all the same?

1318
00:48:24,666 --> 00:48:26,836
- How good can Coke...
- Mexican Coke is different.

1319
00:48:26,836 --> 00:48:30,006
They make it with real cane sugar.

1320
00:48:30,076 --> 00:48:31,176
- Really?
- Yes.

1321
00:48:31,176 --> 00:48:32,206
(They now have things to try in Mexico.)

1322
00:48:32,646 --> 00:48:34,616
And what about this?

1323
00:48:34,846 --> 00:48:36,446
They have the package tours...

1324
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:38,316
- in the online app.
- Yes.

1325
00:48:38,316 --> 00:48:39,986
- The day trips.
- Yes.

1326
00:48:40,086 --> 00:48:42,216
We should just do one.

1327
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:45,026
It gets cheaper if you have more people.

1328
00:48:45,026 --> 00:48:46,026
Yes.

1329
00:48:46,386 --> 00:48:48,526
The staff members need to come with us.

1330
00:48:48,526 --> 00:48:49,556
Yes.

1331
00:48:49,726 --> 00:48:51,296
So we can make it cheaper.

1332
00:48:51,466 --> 00:48:52,726
The production crew...

1333
00:48:53,326 --> 00:48:55,266
- will pay their own money.
- Yes.

1334
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:58,036
So we can make use of that.

1335
00:48:58,866 --> 00:49:00,236
Is it the third floor?

1336
00:49:00,866 --> 00:49:01,936
There it is.

1337
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:04,236
I'm too shy to get off like this.

1338
00:49:07,246 --> 00:49:10,316
- Will this...
- Gosh, he's so embarrassing.

1339
00:49:10,316 --> 00:49:12,346
I was so shocked.

1340
00:49:12,346 --> 00:49:13,346
(Sighing)

1341
00:49:13,386 --> 00:49:15,416
- Just go on, okay?
- Let's go.

1342
00:49:15,616 --> 00:49:16,616
I can't go.

1343
00:49:19,986 --> 00:49:23,326
(Auditor Woo Bin takes heavy steps.)

1344
00:49:26,626 --> 00:49:27,696
I keep...

1345
00:49:29,096 --> 00:49:30,336
putting my head down.

1346
00:49:33,166 --> 00:49:34,906
All the foreigners are staring.

1347
00:49:37,176 --> 00:49:38,376
You have to stand tall.

1348
00:49:38,776 --> 00:49:39,976
Since I paid my respect.

1349
00:49:41,176 --> 00:49:43,876
(All eyes are on the auditor.)

1350
00:49:43,916 --> 00:49:44,916
See? They're all...

1351
00:49:45,386 --> 00:49:46,546
- It's...
- Hello, sir.

1352
00:49:49,386 --> 00:49:52,186
Only someone desperate to be noticed can dress like this.

1353
00:49:53,456 --> 00:49:55,026
- We have to go this way.
- Where?

1354
00:49:56,996 --> 00:49:58,926
The whole airport is focusing on you.

1355
00:50:00,966 --> 00:50:02,736
(There's something to watch in the empty airport.)

1356
00:50:02,796 --> 00:50:04,666
- Hello.
- But this is...

1357
00:50:04,966 --> 00:50:07,136
The people who are watching Woo Bin...

1358
00:50:07,136 --> 00:50:08,536
must think it's a penalty.

1359
00:50:09,336 --> 00:50:12,076
Kwang Soo, I will go and change.

1360
00:50:12,646 --> 00:50:14,176
Go on and change.

1361
00:50:14,176 --> 00:50:16,116
My manager...

1362
00:50:16,116 --> 00:50:17,576
- has the luggage.
- Is that so?

1363
00:50:18,246 --> 00:50:20,446
But we can't sit here.

1364
00:50:20,716 --> 00:50:23,556
(They wait as everyone watches them.)

1365
00:50:29,296 --> 00:50:30,756
(Let's go, Kyung Soo!)

1366
00:50:36,296 --> 00:50:37,636
- Woo Bin.
- Come on.

1367
00:50:37,636 --> 00:50:39,866
- What?
- Don't leave me.

1368
00:50:40,136 --> 00:50:41,736
- My manager has to come.
- And...

1369
00:50:41,736 --> 00:50:43,636
Don't be graceful when you walk.

1370
00:50:44,236 --> 00:50:46,446
You're going like this.

1371
00:50:47,776 --> 00:50:48,976
- He's here.
- He's here.

1372
00:50:48,976 --> 00:50:50,116
Hurry.

1373
00:50:50,846 --> 00:50:52,246
I will quickly go and change.

1374
00:51:01,196 --> 00:51:02,226
But...

1375
00:51:02,856 --> 00:51:04,666
Do you think that is...

1376
00:51:04,666 --> 00:51:06,826
paying respect to the viewers?

1377
00:51:06,826 --> 00:51:08,296
He needs to get help.

1378
00:51:09,736 --> 00:51:12,266
He shouldn't be travelling. He needs treatment.

1379
00:51:13,466 --> 00:51:16,276
I think this will be our last trip with Woo Bin.

1380
00:51:16,806 --> 00:51:18,476
We should have a small farewell party...

1381
00:51:18,476 --> 00:51:20,006
when we end.

1382
00:51:20,006 --> 00:51:21,076
This is...

1383
00:51:21,776 --> 00:51:23,016
What I realised today is that...

1384
00:51:23,016 --> 00:51:25,246
Woo Bin is a bit of an attention seeker.

1385
00:51:26,186 --> 00:51:27,386
- Right?
- Extremely.

1386
00:51:31,016 --> 00:51:32,056
He's out.

1387
00:51:34,996 --> 00:51:35,996
Well...

1388
00:51:36,756 --> 00:51:37,826
Let's go.

1389
00:51:37,826 --> 00:51:38,996
(He is still a bit respectful to be boarding a plane.)

1390
00:51:39,726 --> 00:51:40,726
Let's go.

1391
00:51:41,436 --> 00:51:42,666
- You're a bit...
- Why?

1392
00:51:43,096 --> 00:51:44,736
I thought you had a padded jacket on.

1393
00:51:46,006 --> 00:51:48,106
- Your body...
- Your chest is about to burst.

1394
00:51:48,236 --> 00:51:50,276
Did you do push-ups in the restroom?

1395
00:51:51,006 --> 00:51:53,206
He did have them pumped.

1396
00:51:54,046 --> 00:51:55,376
Before we leave,

1397
00:51:55,576 --> 00:51:57,246
do you have any kind of team chant...

1398
00:51:57,246 --> 00:52:00,146
so that you can have a good trip?

1399
00:52:00,586 --> 00:52:01,856
Isn't that too unnatural?

1400
00:52:01,856 --> 00:52:03,416
I just got goosebumps.

1401
00:52:07,086 --> 00:52:09,126
(They try to do an energized chant before heading for the expedition.)

1402
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,126
Why...

1403
00:52:10,756 --> 00:52:12,166
This feels like a dream.

1404
00:52:12,826 --> 00:52:14,966
Seriously, I can't believe this is true.

1405
00:52:15,396 --> 00:52:16,896
- "Go, team?" - You go first.

1406
00:52:16,996 --> 00:52:18,666
- What?
- Say, "KKPP Foods."

1407
00:52:19,006 --> 00:52:20,706
KKP... I can't.

1408
00:52:22,076 --> 00:52:23,306
Do we go up or down?

1409
00:52:23,836 --> 00:52:25,206
- Down.
- Let's go up.

1410
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:27,776
- KKPP Foods.
- Let's go.

1411
00:52:27,776 --> 00:52:29,016
- Let's go.
- Let's go, team.

1412
00:52:29,346 --> 00:52:30,346
Let's get going.

1413
00:52:30,346 --> 00:52:31,846
(And with that, the expedition begins.)

1414
00:52:31,846 --> 00:52:32,886
We'll get going.

1415
00:52:40,126 --> 00:52:43,396
(After a 15-hour flight...)

1416
00:52:43,996 --> 00:52:44,996
(Welcome)

1417
00:52:50,596 --> 00:52:52,336
(Mexico City)

1418
00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:53,566
Okay.

1419
00:52:54,336 --> 00:52:55,336
Okay.

1420
00:52:55,876 --> 00:52:58,006
(Mexico City Airport, This was shot with prior approval.)

1421
00:52:58,006 --> 00:52:59,006
Do we go together?

1422
00:52:59,246 --> 00:53:00,406
- Are you together?
- Yes.

1423
00:53:00,406 --> 00:53:02,916
We are in the same group. We are friends.

1424
00:53:03,946 --> 00:53:05,086
Since...

1425
00:53:05,546 --> 00:53:07,786
- they don't have the glass...
- I know.

1426
00:53:07,916 --> 00:53:09,186
It feels friendlier.

1427
00:53:09,916 --> 00:53:10,986
They are like my friend.

1428
00:53:11,726 --> 00:53:12,786
Nice to meet you.

1429
00:53:14,226 --> 00:53:15,256
Passport.

1430
00:53:16,996 --> 00:53:18,026
Take off your cap.

1431
00:53:18,566 --> 00:53:20,966
(Despite the friendly gestures, the inspection was strict.)

1432
00:53:21,226 --> 00:53:23,436
I'm sorry, but I don't think Kwang Soo will make it through.

1433
00:53:24,336 --> 00:53:26,406
I don't think he likes Kwang Soo very much.

1434
00:53:27,006 --> 00:53:28,176
- Kim?
- Yes.

1435
00:53:28,236 --> 00:53:30,606
(A kind smile)

1436
00:53:31,076 --> 00:53:32,206
Soh?

1437
00:53:34,006 --> 00:53:35,446
Kim Jeo Woo?

1438
00:53:35,546 --> 00:53:36,876
- Your name.
- Kyung Soo.

1439
00:53:36,876 --> 00:53:39,716
- Kyung Soo. Okay.
- Kyung Soo.

1440
00:53:40,786 --> 00:53:42,386
Kyung Soo.

1441
00:53:42,386 --> 00:53:43,816
(He gently whispers his name.)

1442
00:53:43,916 --> 00:53:45,926
Why is he showing interest only in you?

1443
00:53:45,926 --> 00:53:47,956
- Because he's cute.
- It was the first time he smiled.

1444
00:53:49,096 --> 00:53:50,526
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1445
00:53:50,996 --> 00:53:53,466
(After safely going through immigration...)

1446
00:53:53,626 --> 00:53:55,366
(Their original plan was...)

1447
00:53:55,366 --> 00:53:56,666
I was scared.

1448
00:53:56,866 --> 00:53:58,806
They have a good metro system here.

1449
00:53:59,036 --> 00:54:00,206
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1450
00:54:00,206 --> 00:54:01,236
(They were going to take the metro, which is public transportation.)

1451
00:54:01,676 --> 00:54:03,576
(Arrival gate)

1452
00:54:03,706 --> 00:54:05,606
What? There must be fans outside.

1453
00:54:06,806 --> 00:54:11,076
(The camera in front of the arrival gate)

1454
00:54:12,086 --> 00:54:14,716
(The arrival gate is filled with local fans.)

1455
00:54:14,756 --> 00:54:17,856
(They can't take public transportation like this.)

1456
00:54:18,726 --> 00:54:21,026
Then what should we do?

1457
00:54:21,656 --> 00:54:22,756
What do you think?

1458
00:54:23,556 --> 00:54:24,866
Don't go out yet.

1459
00:54:25,326 --> 00:54:26,326
What should we do?

1460
00:54:28,982 --> 00:54:31,752
(The arrival gate is filled with local fans.)

1461
00:54:31,792 --> 00:54:34,852
(They can't take public transportation like this.)

1462
00:54:35,638 --> 00:54:37,908
Then what should we do?

1463
00:54:38,508 --> 00:54:39,638
What do you think?

1464
00:54:40,338 --> 00:54:41,648
Don't go out yet.

1465
00:54:42,148 --> 00:54:43,148
What should we do?

1466
00:54:44,108 --> 00:54:46,318
Let's just go out...

1467
00:54:46,478 --> 00:54:48,178
and do a proper greeting.

1468
00:54:48,588 --> 00:54:49,818
Do a light greeting,

1469
00:54:49,818 --> 00:54:51,418
and then stick close to the crew.

1470
00:54:51,418 --> 00:54:52,458
Great.

1471
00:54:53,588 --> 00:54:55,328
(Arriving)

1472
00:54:59,198 --> 00:55:02,768
- Kwang Soo!
- Kwang Soo!

1473
00:55:03,068 --> 00:55:04,228
Excuse me.

1474
00:55:04,228 --> 00:55:07,298
(There are more people than they expected.)

1475
00:55:07,298 --> 00:55:08,668
Hello.

1476
00:55:09,168 --> 00:55:10,338
Kwang Soo.

1477
00:55:10,968 --> 00:55:12,178
Hello.

1478
00:55:12,178 --> 00:55:13,938
(They calmly greet the Mexican fans...)

1479
00:55:15,148 --> 00:55:18,548
(and head towards the staff car.)

1480
00:55:18,618 --> 00:55:21,218
- There are too many fans, so...
- Yes.

1481
00:55:21,218 --> 00:55:23,248
- Don't look down on us.
- I don't think we can...

1482
00:55:23,248 --> 00:55:24,548
Don't look down on us.

1483
00:55:26,488 --> 00:55:27,518
Okay?

1484
00:55:27,818 --> 00:55:29,388
The people in Mexico are...

1485
00:55:30,388 --> 00:55:32,928
To be honest, I did look down on you.

1486
00:55:33,428 --> 00:55:35,898
Since the fans are over there,

1487
00:55:35,898 --> 00:55:37,668
if we go and shoot at that side,

1488
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:39,468
we will cause commotion in the airport,

1489
00:55:39,468 --> 00:55:41,838
and we might cause trouble.

1490
00:55:42,268 --> 00:55:43,568
So to get to the hotel,

1491
00:55:43,708 --> 00:55:45,708
if we take the bus...

1492
00:55:45,708 --> 00:55:46,708
It will take us to the hotel?

1493
00:55:46,708 --> 00:55:48,478
That will be great,

1494
00:55:49,508 --> 00:55:52,148
but it will be inconsistent with our plan.

1495
00:55:52,478 --> 00:55:54,478
- Since this is an exceptional case, - Yes.

1496
00:55:54,848 --> 00:55:56,248
let's discuss it at the hotel.

1497
00:55:57,048 --> 00:56:00,318
My understanding is that you really hate...

1498
00:56:00,318 --> 00:56:01,388
cheating like that.

1499
00:56:01,388 --> 00:56:03,158
Who? Do you hate cheating?

1500
00:56:03,458 --> 00:56:04,558
I...

1501
00:56:04,788 --> 00:56:06,528
lived my entire life cheating.

1502
00:56:06,858 --> 00:56:07,958
I'm serious.

1503
00:56:09,798 --> 00:56:11,228
It runs in the family.

1504
00:56:11,898 --> 00:56:14,838
(It is Kwang Soo's personal opinion.)

1505
00:56:14,938 --> 00:56:16,038
But still,

1506
00:56:16,038 --> 00:56:18,068
this is the start of your trip, and it was self-planned.

1507
00:56:18,068 --> 00:56:19,308
So, what we thought of was,

1508
00:56:19,708 --> 00:56:21,078
we will take this bus...

1509
00:56:21,438 --> 00:56:24,308
and take you anywhere that is within five minutes' distance.

1510
00:56:24,848 --> 00:56:26,778
So choose the location in five minutes.

1511
00:56:27,018 --> 00:56:28,078
Where you want to be dropped off.

1512
00:56:28,248 --> 00:56:29,818
Can we get to our hotel in five minutes?

1513
00:56:29,818 --> 00:56:31,518
No, it's 20 minutes away.

1514
00:56:32,288 --> 00:56:33,788
Then let's go to this hotel.

1515
00:56:33,788 --> 00:56:34,788
Which one?

1516
00:56:34,788 --> 00:56:35,828
- It's a 4-minute drive.
- It's a 4-minute drive.

1517
00:56:35,828 --> 00:56:37,528
- Sound good. Let's go there.
- Here.

1518
00:56:38,058 --> 00:56:39,498
It's a four-minute drive.

1519
00:56:39,698 --> 00:56:41,098
It feels like we're wasting one minute.

1520
00:56:41,258 --> 00:56:42,868
(The cheater doesn't want to let even a single minute go to waste.)

1521
00:56:43,628 --> 00:56:45,668
Please...

1522
00:56:45,768 --> 00:56:47,568
go here.

1523
00:56:48,268 --> 00:56:50,268
(They start heading to the hotel that's 4 minutes away.)

1524
00:56:50,268 --> 00:56:51,268
Okay.

1525
00:56:59,648 --> 00:57:01,748
(The sentimental type enjoys the view outside.)

1526
00:57:01,748 --> 00:57:03,318
Hey, look at those buildings.

1527
00:57:04,848 --> 00:57:06,658
I've never seen anything like this in my life.

1528
00:57:06,658 --> 00:57:07,818
The overall colour scheme.

1529
00:57:07,918 --> 00:57:09,728
- Right. It's pretty. Yes.
- Right?

1530
00:57:10,488 --> 00:57:11,928
- Right. It's pretty. Yes.
- Right?

1531
00:57:12,628 --> 00:57:14,058
We're two minutes away.

1532
00:57:14,058 --> 00:57:15,168
Already?

1533
00:57:15,768 --> 00:57:17,468
Don't be so mechanical.

1534
00:57:18,068 --> 00:57:19,598
All you're thinking about is food.

1535
00:57:19,838 --> 00:57:21,438
Look out the window.

1536
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,208
(The CEO wants them to be emotionally immersed together.)

1537
00:57:23,838 --> 00:57:25,538
I think we'll be able to have lunch here.

1538
00:57:25,538 --> 00:57:26,608
Perfect.

1539
00:57:26,608 --> 00:57:27,978
(The culinary director uses his professional skills.)

1540
00:57:28,848 --> 00:57:31,078
I think tacos should be the first thing we eat here.

1541
00:57:31,078 --> 00:57:33,248
Of course. We should definitely have tacos.

1542
00:57:33,978 --> 00:57:35,248
Gosh, these look good.

1543
00:57:35,788 --> 00:57:37,088
- Let me see.
- Are those reviews?

1544
00:57:37,948 --> 00:57:39,118
(An authentic local taco place)

1545
00:57:39,118 --> 00:57:40,588
It's an authentic local-style taco place.

1546
00:57:40,588 --> 00:57:41,828
This one looks so good.

1547
00:57:41,928 --> 00:57:43,088
This taco.

1548
00:57:43,358 --> 00:57:44,558
We'll go here.

1549
00:57:44,928 --> 00:57:46,228
- How many stars?
- You said you'll go to the hotel.

1550
00:57:46,228 --> 00:57:47,498
It has 4.4 stars.

1551
00:57:47,498 --> 00:57:48,828
(The taco place has a 4.4 rating on Google.)

1552
00:57:48,828 --> 00:57:51,268
It looks like they don't accept cards.

1553
00:57:51,268 --> 00:57:52,768
(He's worried about how to pay.)

1554
00:57:52,768 --> 00:57:54,438
First things first, I need to have some Coke.

1555
00:57:55,308 --> 00:57:56,908
Coke made with cane sugar.

1556
00:57:56,938 --> 00:57:58,608
(All he's thinking about is Coke.)

1557
00:57:59,208 --> 00:58:00,338
Thank you.

1558
00:58:00,338 --> 00:58:01,478
Thank you.

1559
00:58:02,108 --> 00:58:03,548
- We're here.
- We're here? Is this it?

1560
00:58:03,548 --> 00:58:04,648
Thank you.

1561
00:58:07,678 --> 00:58:09,018
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1562
00:58:09,018 --> 00:58:10,148
(Current time: 1:00pm)

1563
00:58:10,148 --> 00:58:12,058
We still have two hours...

1564
00:58:12,058 --> 00:58:14,558
before check-in.

1565
00:58:14,558 --> 00:58:15,658
That's fine with us.

1566
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:17,288
So I think we should go have lunch first.

1567
00:58:17,328 --> 00:58:18,858
- This way.
- Do you want to get Coke first?

1568
00:58:19,198 --> 00:58:20,858
- Sure. Let's go.
- Coke?

1569
00:58:20,858 --> 00:58:22,368
They should have Coke at the taco place.

1570
00:58:22,768 --> 00:58:25,238
(As they head to the restaurant to get lunch,)

1571
00:58:25,238 --> 00:58:29,708
(the real expedition begins!)

1572
00:58:30,068 --> 00:58:31,468
They're drinking Coke.

1573
00:58:34,738 --> 00:58:35,848
Do you want to get some Coke?

1574
00:58:36,948 --> 00:58:38,848
Why do you keep going on about Coke?

1575
00:58:39,418 --> 00:58:41,178
- There's Coke at the restaurant.
- They sell Coke here.

1576
00:58:42,288 --> 00:58:44,218
(Sighing)

1577
00:58:44,218 --> 00:58:47,958
(He's already tired of hearing about Coke, even before lunch.)

1578
00:58:50,828 --> 00:58:51,928
Over here.

1579
00:58:52,758 --> 00:58:54,298
This must be the restaurant.

1580
00:58:54,298 --> 00:58:55,498
Let's go inside.

1581
00:58:56,268 --> 00:58:58,068
- This is it.
- What?

1582
00:58:58,068 --> 00:58:59,438
- This is it?
- Yes.

1583
00:59:00,238 --> 00:59:01,368
They have Coke.

1584
00:59:02,368 --> 00:59:04,508
(They happen to have Coke.)

1585
00:59:04,508 --> 00:59:05,808
Excuse me.

1586
00:59:05,908 --> 00:59:07,138
Hello.

1587
00:59:08,308 --> 00:59:09,578
Excuse me.

1588
00:59:09,578 --> 00:59:12,148
Can we pay with credit cards?

1589
00:59:12,278 --> 00:59:14,718
(The auditor checks the restaurant's payment methods.)

1590
00:59:14,748 --> 00:59:16,348
They accept credit cards.

1591
00:59:16,388 --> 00:59:17,918
- Really?
- Yes. Good.

1592
00:59:17,918 --> 00:59:18,988
(The auditor seems relieved by the news.)

1593
00:59:19,158 --> 00:59:21,118
We'd like recommendations from the menu.

1594
00:59:22,528 --> 00:59:24,228
- Can you recommend something?
- Yes.

1595
00:59:24,228 --> 00:59:25,228
(She looks up pictures to show them.)

1596
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:26,958
She says this is this.

1597
00:59:27,298 --> 00:59:29,068
- Enchilada. With chicken.
- Okay.

1598
00:59:29,068 --> 00:59:30,628
- Okay, chicken.
- Okay.

1599
00:59:31,128 --> 00:59:32,768
She was talking about this.

1600
00:59:33,598 --> 00:59:35,738
You're very nice.

1601
00:59:36,668 --> 00:59:38,168
(Thank you.)

1602
00:59:38,168 --> 00:59:40,478
It means, "You're very nice."

1603
00:59:41,038 --> 00:59:43,578
(Kwang Soo thanks her with the help of a translation tool.)

1604
00:59:44,378 --> 00:59:45,848
I feel bad.

1605
00:59:45,848 --> 00:59:46,978
Her food is getting soggy.

1606
00:59:47,178 --> 00:59:48,948
- She was eating lunch when...
- Yes.

1607
00:59:48,948 --> 00:59:51,388
(Her lunch is just sitting there.)

1608
00:59:52,118 --> 00:59:55,828
Please have this first.

1609
00:59:56,288 --> 00:59:58,798
It's okay. Thank you.

1610
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:00,358
- What did you say?
- Ea this first?

1611
01:00:00,358 --> 01:00:01,558
You should eat your lunch first.

1612
01:00:02,198 --> 01:00:05,568
(A customer who prioritises the restaurant owner's meal)

1613
01:00:05,568 --> 01:00:07,168
One, two, three.

1614
01:00:07,168 --> 01:00:09,508
Three tacos, three enchiladas,

1615
01:00:10,838 --> 01:00:12,038
and one quesadilla.

1616
01:00:12,038 --> 01:00:13,808
- Isn't that too much food?
- Three Cokes.

1617
01:00:15,378 --> 01:00:16,608
Three Cokes.

1618
01:00:17,108 --> 01:00:18,308
You're so...

1619
01:00:18,578 --> 01:00:20,678
(Kwang Soo is serious about Coke.)

1620
01:00:20,678 --> 01:00:23,518
Which quesadilla should we order? Cheese or chicken?

1621
01:00:24,018 --> 01:00:25,858
- Chicken.
- We're ordering chicken enchilada.

1622
01:00:25,858 --> 01:00:27,958
- Let's do cheese quesadilla.
- Okay.

1623
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:29,028
Cheese quesadilla.

1624
01:00:29,028 --> 01:00:31,388
- Cheese quesadilla.
- Cheese quesadilla, please.

1625
01:00:33,498 --> 01:00:34,598
Why did you sigh?

1626
01:00:34,698 --> 01:00:36,468
Didn't I say chicken quesadilla?

1627
01:00:37,128 --> 01:00:38,598
Those two discussed it...

1628
01:00:40,368 --> 01:00:41,868
- Majority rules.
- and decided on cheese.

1629
01:00:41,868 --> 01:00:43,068
- It's two to one.
- We're...

1630
01:00:43,068 --> 01:00:44,508
Honestly, the same goes for this Mexico trip.

1631
01:00:44,668 --> 01:00:46,278
This? No.

1632
01:00:46,308 --> 01:00:47,408
I kept suggesting Canada by myself.

1633
01:00:47,408 --> 01:00:49,178
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1634
01:00:49,878 --> 01:00:52,218
One Zero Coke, please.

1635
01:00:53,078 --> 01:00:54,448
- I ordered a Coke Zero Sugar too.
- I see.

1636
01:00:54,448 --> 01:00:55,948
- To compare them.
- Okay.

1637
01:00:57,388 --> 01:00:58,788
Thank you.

1638
01:00:58,788 --> 01:00:59,788
(The Cokes they ordered have arrived.)

1639
01:00:59,788 --> 01:01:01,518
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1640
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,288
- Let's drink.
- I'm so curious.

1641
01:01:03,288 --> 01:01:04,488
Apparently, this tastes really different.

1642
01:01:05,398 --> 01:01:09,398
(Mexican Coke is made with cane sugar.)

1643
01:01:09,868 --> 01:01:12,798
(How does it taste?)

1644
01:01:13,938 --> 01:01:16,738
(The culinary director is quiet.)

1645
01:01:16,738 --> 01:01:18,238
(Glancing over at Kwang Soo)

1646
01:01:19,908 --> 01:01:21,038
It's just...

1647
01:01:21,408 --> 01:01:22,848
It's just Coke.

1648
01:01:22,978 --> 01:01:24,308
- Wait.
- It's just...

1649
01:01:24,308 --> 01:01:25,478
It's just Coke.

1650
01:01:25,948 --> 01:01:30,388
(They keep drinking the Coke, amazed by how familiar it tastes.)

1651
01:01:30,518 --> 01:01:32,788
Doesn't this taste exactly the same?

1652
01:01:32,858 --> 01:01:33,858
There's no difference at all.

1653
01:01:33,858 --> 01:01:35,218
It tastes the same as the Coke I'm familiar with.

1654
01:01:36,258 --> 01:01:38,698
(Woo Bin takes another sip.)

1655
01:01:38,828 --> 01:01:39,858
To be honest,

1656
01:01:40,898 --> 01:01:42,128
my expectations might have been too high.

1657
01:01:42,998 --> 01:01:44,198
It's just Coke.

1658
01:01:44,198 --> 01:01:45,198
(Woo Bin doesn't know how to react.)

1659
01:01:45,198 --> 01:01:48,098
I heard Mexican Coke tastes much better.

1660
01:01:48,398 --> 01:01:50,938
We'll keep trying at different restaurants.

1661
01:01:51,638 --> 01:01:53,978
(Disappointed, Kyung Soo orders a beer.)

1662
01:01:53,978 --> 01:01:56,748
I'll have a beer, please.

1663
01:01:57,478 --> 01:01:58,778
Regular beer or dark beer?

1664
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:01,518
(Pardon?)

1665
01:02:02,288 --> 01:02:03,348
- We don't understand.
- We can speak Spanish,

1666
01:02:03,348 --> 01:02:04,548
but can't understand it.

1667
01:02:04,548 --> 01:02:06,518
(What usually happens when you use a translation tool)

1668
01:02:08,188 --> 01:02:09,988
- Do this one.
- Dark beer.

1669
01:02:10,458 --> 01:02:11,888
- This one.
- Thank you.

1670
01:02:12,528 --> 01:02:13,898
Not Mexico, but...

1671
01:02:13,898 --> 01:02:15,098
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1672
01:02:15,098 --> 01:02:17,028
- Let's see how Mexican beer is.
- How much food did you order?

1673
01:02:17,298 --> 01:02:19,538
We ordered four.

1674
01:02:19,538 --> 01:02:21,268
(Will Mexican beer taste different?)

1675
01:02:22,538 --> 01:02:23,668
(Surprised)

1676
01:02:23,668 --> 01:02:24,738
Is it good?

1677
01:02:24,868 --> 01:02:26,938
The beer smells like sesame oil.

1678
01:02:27,438 --> 01:02:28,578
It tastes nutty.

1679
01:02:28,908 --> 01:02:31,048
Seriously.

1680
01:02:31,778 --> 01:02:33,248
- We can order more.
- It's very good.

1681
01:02:34,518 --> 01:02:35,788
Was it that one?

1682
01:02:39,658 --> 01:02:41,358
Right?

1683
01:02:41,358 --> 01:02:43,028
- Seriously.
- Is it good?

1684
01:02:43,158 --> 01:02:45,498
- It's really good.
- I got goosebumps.

1685
01:02:45,528 --> 01:02:46,958
It smells like sesame oil.

1686
01:02:46,958 --> 01:02:48,098
Taste it.

1687
01:02:48,398 --> 01:02:49,528
Now's not the time to be filming us.

1688
01:02:49,528 --> 01:02:51,268
Go get yourselves some beer.

1689
01:02:51,468 --> 01:02:53,568
(Auditing the beer)

1690
01:02:54,238 --> 01:02:55,468
It's different. It's completely different.

1691
01:02:55,468 --> 01:02:56,638
The beer is completely different.

1692
01:02:57,008 --> 01:02:58,008
It's really good.

1693
01:02:58,068 --> 01:02:59,078
(A laugh slipped out)

1694
01:02:59,078 --> 01:03:00,108
Right?

1695
01:03:00,108 --> 01:03:01,778
You can't help but smile.

1696
01:03:02,148 --> 01:03:04,548
- It really smells like sesame oil.
- It smells like sesame oil.

1697
01:03:04,548 --> 01:03:05,878
Maybe the server...

1698
01:03:05,878 --> 01:03:07,148
was touching oil...

1699
01:03:07,148 --> 01:03:09,018
- before he poured the beer.
- I'm serious.

1700
01:03:09,888 --> 01:03:11,318
It finishes with a hint of sesame oil.

1701
01:03:11,318 --> 01:03:14,418
It doesn't taste like an accidental drop of sesame oil.

1702
01:03:14,418 --> 01:03:15,528
It's part of the beer.

1703
01:03:15,528 --> 01:03:16,858
(A non-believer)

1704
01:03:16,858 --> 01:03:18,558
- It tastes nutty.
- Right?

1705
01:03:18,558 --> 01:03:20,258
How can beer taste nutty?

1706
01:03:20,298 --> 01:03:21,458
It's amazing.

1707
01:03:21,458 --> 01:03:22,668
(Returning after dealing with the non-believer)

1708
01:03:23,068 --> 01:03:24,228
One more, please.

1709
01:03:25,228 --> 01:03:26,338
One more, please.

1710
01:03:26,868 --> 01:03:29,468
(The beer tastes so good that they're ordering another.)

1711
01:03:29,708 --> 01:03:31,208
- Or earlier, there was...
- It's here.

1712
01:03:31,868 --> 01:03:32,908
Already?

1713
01:03:33,478 --> 01:03:34,638
(Salsa: A spicy sauce made mainly with tomatoes and peppers)

1714
01:03:34,638 --> 01:03:35,948
- It's salsa.
- It's salsa.

1715
01:03:35,948 --> 01:03:37,708
This is salsa.

1716
01:03:38,108 --> 01:03:39,278
I think we're supposed to dip something in it.

1717
01:03:39,278 --> 01:03:40,318
It's hot.

1718
01:03:42,488 --> 01:03:43,918
- Gosh.
- Why?

1719
01:03:44,448 --> 01:03:46,018
- Is it good?
- It's so good.

1720
01:03:46,158 --> 01:03:49,058
- Most spicy foods in Korea are red.
- Right.

1721
01:03:51,258 --> 01:03:52,398
This is good.

1722
01:03:52,458 --> 01:03:54,298
It's spicy in a tasty way.

1723
01:03:54,298 --> 01:03:56,868
Isn't this what CEO Ko was talking about?

1724
01:03:56,868 --> 01:03:58,798
We bring flavours like these...

1725
01:03:58,798 --> 01:04:00,198
back to Korea.

1726
01:04:00,698 --> 01:04:01,898
And you...

1727
01:04:01,898 --> 01:04:03,238
(He turns to the culinary director for assistance.)

1728
01:04:03,238 --> 01:04:04,238
Have to remember the flavours.

1729
01:04:04,238 --> 01:04:06,538
You have to remember them and recreate them.

1730
01:04:06,578 --> 01:04:07,638
Wait.

1731
01:04:08,278 --> 01:04:09,478
Listen.

1732
01:04:10,048 --> 01:04:11,708
If we make anchovy broth...

1733
01:04:11,778 --> 01:04:14,478
and blend peppers with hot water,

1734
01:04:14,848 --> 01:04:16,688
- I think it would taste like this.
- I think it would taste like this.

1735
01:04:17,818 --> 01:04:19,218
The weather is so nice.

1736
01:04:19,718 --> 01:04:21,418
Mexico feels much more laid-back than I thought.

1737
01:04:21,818 --> 01:04:22,828
I know.

1738
01:04:39,508 --> 01:04:40,738
Gosh.

1739
01:04:40,738 --> 01:04:41,778
(The first dish has arrived.)

1740
01:04:41,778 --> 01:04:43,548
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1741
01:04:43,548 --> 01:04:45,108
- Gosh, what is this?
- What's this?

1742
01:04:45,678 --> 01:04:46,678
- I think this is the four-piece...
- It looks good.

1743
01:04:46,678 --> 01:04:48,648
I think this is the dish with four pieces.

1744
01:04:49,618 --> 01:04:51,418
- It looks good.
- Right?

1745
01:04:53,658 --> 01:04:55,988
(Meanwhile, the tacos are ready too.)

1746
01:05:03,068 --> 01:05:04,098
- Thank you.
- Tacos.

1747
01:05:04,098 --> 01:05:05,598
Thank you.

1748
01:05:06,198 --> 01:05:07,268
I'll try this one.

1749
01:05:07,268 --> 01:05:08,438
This really...

1750
01:05:08,438 --> 01:05:09,438
Me too.

1751
01:05:09,438 --> 01:05:10,838
(Tacos: A Mexican dish with meat and vegetables wrapped in a tortilla)

1752
01:05:10,838 --> 01:05:12,308
These are tacos.

1753
01:05:13,378 --> 01:05:14,678
What are these green things? Peppers?

1754
01:05:14,678 --> 01:05:15,908
Cactus.

1755
01:05:16,008 --> 01:05:17,278
- Cactus?
- Cactus?

1756
01:05:17,278 --> 01:05:18,408
The green things?

1757
01:05:19,848 --> 01:05:21,618
- No way.
- It's true.

1758
01:05:21,618 --> 01:05:22,748
Are you serious?

1759
01:05:23,088 --> 01:05:24,188
People eat cactus?

1760
01:05:24,188 --> 01:05:26,258
I heard tequila is made from cactus.

1761
01:05:26,588 --> 01:05:27,788
Really?

1762
01:05:27,858 --> 01:05:28,888
No, that's agave.

1763
01:05:28,888 --> 01:05:30,058
(Correction)

1764
01:05:31,958 --> 01:05:33,998
(Their first tacos in Mexico)

1765
01:05:33,998 --> 01:05:36,698
(How do they taste?)

1766
01:05:41,738 --> 01:05:43,838
(Glancing at Woo Bin)

1767
01:05:43,838 --> 01:05:45,608
(Reading the room)

1768
01:05:46,078 --> 01:05:48,238
(They exchange a hesitant look)

1769
01:05:48,238 --> 01:05:49,808
- What?
- Now...

1770
01:05:49,808 --> 01:05:51,448
- What is it?
- Be honest.

1771
01:05:51,448 --> 01:05:53,678
(Thinking)

1772
01:05:53,678 --> 01:05:55,378
It's good, but I don't think I'll have more.

1773
01:05:55,588 --> 01:05:56,588
The flavour isn't special.

1774
01:05:56,588 --> 01:05:57,688
- Right.
- Right.

1775
01:05:58,148 --> 01:05:59,518
We can easily find this flavour in Korea.

1776
01:05:59,518 --> 01:06:00,518
It's just ham and...

1777
01:06:01,488 --> 01:06:02,928
And the cactus...

1778
01:06:04,958 --> 01:06:06,528
doesn't have a distinct flavour.

1779
01:06:07,128 --> 01:06:08,558
It tastes like peas.

1780
01:06:09,168 --> 01:06:10,928
Small peas.

1781
01:06:10,928 --> 01:06:12,098
(Kyung Soo: It tastes like small peas.)

1782
01:06:12,298 --> 01:06:13,398
Like green beans.

1783
01:06:13,398 --> 01:06:15,368
- Cooked green beans.
- I get what you mean.

1784
01:06:15,368 --> 01:06:16,538
That's what it tastes like.

1785
01:06:17,468 --> 01:06:18,508
Okay.

1786
01:06:18,508 --> 01:06:20,008
(The next dish has arrived.)

1787
01:06:20,008 --> 01:06:21,078
What's this?

1788
01:06:21,078 --> 01:06:22,138
(Enchilada: A dish consisting of tortillas rolled around...)

1789
01:06:22,138 --> 01:06:23,278
Thank you.

1790
01:06:23,278 --> 01:06:24,608
(a filling of meat and vegetables and covered with a sauce)

1791
01:06:24,608 --> 01:06:26,748
There are tortillas in this too.

1792
01:06:26,748 --> 01:06:28,518
The dishes all have a similar vibe.

1793
01:06:29,188 --> 01:06:31,948
(Kwang Soo takes a bite of the enchilada.)

1794
01:06:33,488 --> 01:06:36,088
(Speechless)

1795
01:06:36,188 --> 01:06:37,188
Try this.

1796
01:06:37,688 --> 01:06:39,058
(Suspicious)

1797
01:06:39,158 --> 01:06:40,158
Try it.

1798
01:06:42,828 --> 01:06:44,328
You have to get the tortilla inside too.

1799
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:48,138
(Speechless)

1800
01:06:48,168 --> 01:06:50,368
(An awkward glance)

1801
01:06:50,468 --> 01:06:51,508
Well...

1802
01:06:52,238 --> 01:06:53,708
It's seasoned...

1803
01:06:54,838 --> 01:06:56,648
just lightly enough...

1804
01:06:57,278 --> 01:06:58,448
to come off as a little bland.

1805
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:01,018
I get why they gave us so much of this sauce.

1806
01:07:01,348 --> 01:07:03,448
But I like it.

1807
01:07:03,448 --> 01:07:04,588
- It's good.
- Yes.

1808
01:07:04,948 --> 01:07:06,588
- With a mild flavour.
- Yes.

1809
01:07:07,188 --> 01:07:08,418
They all taste healthy.

1810
01:07:08,418 --> 01:07:09,758
People usually have it for breakfast.

1811
01:07:10,228 --> 01:07:11,828
- Enchilada?
- I can see that.

1812
01:07:11,828 --> 01:07:13,198
- It feels easy on...
- I can see that.

1813
01:07:13,198 --> 01:07:14,828
It feels easy on the stomach.

1814
01:07:15,968 --> 01:07:17,128
I like this one.

1815
01:07:17,998 --> 01:07:19,038
The cheese.

1816
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:22,838
(Kwang Soo takes a bite of the cheese quesadilla.)

1817
01:07:24,208 --> 01:07:25,778
(Glancing at him)

1818
01:07:25,838 --> 01:07:28,208
(Speechless)

1819
01:07:28,278 --> 01:07:29,748
(Laughing)

1820
01:07:29,748 --> 01:07:30,778
Is it not good?

1821
01:07:31,008 --> 01:07:32,048
It is good.

1822
01:07:33,248 --> 01:07:34,618
- How should I put this?
- Overall, they're all good.

1823
01:07:34,618 --> 01:07:36,918
It's good. They're all good.

1824
01:07:37,648 --> 01:07:38,888
But if I close my eyes...

1825
01:07:39,158 --> 01:07:40,688
and put one of them in my mouth,

1826
01:07:40,888 --> 01:07:42,158
I won't be able to guess what it is.

1827
01:07:43,588 --> 01:07:45,658
They're all corn tortilla-based.

1828
01:07:45,658 --> 01:07:47,098
Right. That's how they taste.

1829
01:07:47,728 --> 01:07:49,428
For us, this isn't what we usually eat.

1830
01:07:49,528 --> 01:07:52,028
- But for locals, this is normal.
- These are their usual meals.

1831
01:07:52,168 --> 01:07:53,268
So it's as if...

1832
01:07:54,668 --> 01:07:57,708
we're eating four bowls with different kinds of rice,

1833
01:07:57,708 --> 01:08:00,238
like brown rice and black rice.

1834
01:08:00,238 --> 01:08:02,108
- That's an accurate comparison.
- So you're just eating rice.

1835
01:08:02,108 --> 01:08:03,378
(Brown rice, black rice, mixed grains, and rice with beans)

1836
01:08:03,708 --> 01:08:05,748
For our first meal here,

1837
01:08:05,948 --> 01:08:07,348
- these feel like healthy options.
- Right, they're not bad.

1838
01:08:07,348 --> 01:08:08,778
Yes. So I'm happy with these.

1839
01:08:09,348 --> 01:08:11,648
- We'll be getting enough protein.
- Right.

1840
01:08:11,648 --> 01:08:13,058
There's protein here.

1841
01:08:13,058 --> 01:08:14,058
- And carbs.
- And carbs.

1842
01:08:14,058 --> 01:08:15,458
There's protein here too.

1843
01:08:16,458 --> 01:08:17,658
That's so nice.

1844
01:08:17,688 --> 01:08:19,798
Cheese is dairy fat too, but it still has protein.

1845
01:08:20,258 --> 01:08:23,328
If the prices were written in pesos,

1846
01:08:23,628 --> 01:08:24,868
they're very cheap.

1847
01:08:25,028 --> 01:08:26,938
- They are.
- So 30 pesos.

1848
01:08:26,938 --> 01:08:28,268
The equivalent of 30 pesos...

1849
01:08:28,438 --> 01:08:30,268
is 2.2 dollars.

1850
01:08:30,608 --> 01:08:32,038
What we ordered cost 2.2 dollars?

1851
01:08:32,038 --> 01:08:33,238
We're rich.

1852
01:08:33,708 --> 01:08:34,878
You're right.

1853
01:08:35,138 --> 01:08:38,578
We'll be able to eat a lot more food than we thought.

1854
01:08:39,178 --> 01:08:41,578
I think we can go to a more upscale restaurant.

1855
01:08:41,718 --> 01:08:43,218
- Tonight?
- Yes.

1856
01:08:43,388 --> 01:08:44,448
Tonight?

1857
01:08:44,618 --> 01:08:45,988
No, whenever.

1858
01:08:46,218 --> 01:08:48,588
Let's wait until we get to Cancun.

1859
01:08:49,088 --> 01:08:51,458
I hear things are expensive in Cancun.

1860
01:08:52,328 --> 01:08:53,958
- I see.
- I think...

1861
01:08:54,128 --> 01:08:56,328
if we spend too much money here,

1862
01:08:56,898 --> 01:08:59,068
- we might not have enough there.
- All right.

1863
01:08:59,068 --> 01:09:01,138
- We should go over the budget.
- Okay.

1864
01:09:01,398 --> 01:09:03,708
- Let's decide on a daily limit.
- Yes.

1865
01:09:04,338 --> 01:09:06,708
Guess how much it would cost for the three of us to take the subway.

1866
01:09:07,508 --> 01:09:08,508
It's 1.1 dollars.

1867
01:09:08,738 --> 01:09:10,078
- For the 3 of us?
- For all 3 of us.

1868
01:09:10,208 --> 01:09:11,378
That's really cheap.

1869
01:09:11,378 --> 01:09:12,618
Then let's take the subway.

1870
01:09:12,618 --> 01:09:13,818
We don't have to transfer.

1871
01:09:13,818 --> 01:09:15,748
We'll be saving a lot of money too.

1872
01:09:16,188 --> 01:09:17,918
It costs five pesos per person.

1873
01:09:18,788 --> 01:09:20,018
That's 0.37 dollars.

1874
01:09:20,488 --> 01:09:21,988
- That's great.
- So then,

1875
01:09:22,828 --> 01:09:23,858
CEO Ko gave us a more generous amount...

1876
01:09:24,358 --> 01:09:26,958
of money than we had realised.

1877
01:09:27,698 --> 01:09:29,428
Let's go. Thank you for the food.

1878
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:30,828
Thank you for the food.

1879
01:09:31,668 --> 01:09:33,638
Yes. Thank you.

1880
01:09:33,768 --> 01:09:35,068
And receipt?

1881
01:09:35,068 --> 01:09:36,108
(Woo Bin secures the receipt.)

1882
01:09:36,138 --> 01:09:37,338
- It was nice meeting you.
- Thank you.

1883
01:09:37,338 --> 01:09:38,938
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1884
01:09:38,968 --> 01:09:41,538
- Welcome to Mexico.
- Thank you.

1885
01:09:42,548 --> 01:09:43,708
Thank you.

1886
01:09:44,508 --> 01:09:47,518
(GBRB: Joy Pops Laugh Pops)

1887
01:09:47,878 --> 01:09:49,218
We have to walk a bit.

1888
01:09:49,448 --> 01:09:51,388
(They decided to take the subway to their hotel.)

1889
01:09:51,388 --> 01:09:52,558
It's a 14-minute walk.

1890
01:09:53,558 --> 01:09:55,688
- Kyung Soo.
- We'll walk to the subway station.

1891
01:09:55,688 --> 01:09:57,858
What if we don't walk for 14 minutes...

1892
01:09:58,858 --> 01:09:59,928
and choose this option instead?

1893
01:09:59,928 --> 01:10:00,958
Transferring?

1894
01:10:01,528 --> 01:10:03,028
Will it be hard?

1895
01:10:03,368 --> 01:10:04,798
- No, it won't.
- Will it be hard?

1896
01:10:04,798 --> 01:10:06,268
- No, it's not hard.
- If we do this,

1897
01:10:06,268 --> 01:10:07,298
we'll only walk four minutes.

1898
01:10:07,538 --> 01:10:09,908
So we'll walk less and be on the subway longer.

1899
01:10:09,908 --> 01:10:12,508
We have to transfer, so we have to make sure...

1900
01:10:12,838 --> 01:10:14,138
we get off at the right stop.

1901
01:10:14,908 --> 01:10:16,278
(He's nervous about having to transfer.)

1902
01:10:16,278 --> 01:10:17,408
- Let's go.
- Do we have to transfer?

1903
01:10:17,408 --> 01:10:18,748
Why don't we just take the direct train?

1904
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:20,848
Because we have to walk for 14 minutes.

1905
01:10:21,678 --> 01:10:23,088
But this one's close by.

1906
01:10:23,088 --> 01:10:24,088
(A 14-minute walk and a direct train or a 4-minute walk and transferring)

1907
01:10:24,248 --> 01:10:25,318
Let's go with the second option.

1908
01:10:25,318 --> 01:10:26,688
I don't think we'll be able to transfer trains.

1909
01:10:27,358 --> 01:10:28,458
Should we just take the direct train, then?

1910
01:10:28,458 --> 01:10:30,258
- We got this.
- Let's just walk for 14 minutes.

1911
01:10:31,358 --> 01:10:32,598
Let's take in the scenery as we walk.

1912
01:10:32,858 --> 01:10:34,098
- What?
- We'll get some tacos too.

1913
01:10:34,458 --> 01:10:35,758
(Speechless)

1914
01:10:35,758 --> 01:10:37,198
It's 14 minutes, which is 850m.

1915
01:10:37,398 --> 01:10:38,728
We can walk 850m in no time.

1916
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:41,738
(With our bags?)

1917
01:10:41,868 --> 01:10:42,968
Seriously.

1918
01:10:43,868 --> 01:10:44,868
Let's go.

1919
01:10:45,638 --> 01:10:46,778
It's not even hot.

1920
01:10:49,348 --> 01:10:50,548
The weather is nice.

1921
01:10:51,248 --> 01:10:53,778
(The employees don't respond.)

1922
01:10:53,778 --> 01:10:55,418
Why were you so adamant on walking?

1923
01:10:56,488 --> 01:10:58,888
I've given them my opinion a few times so far.

1924
01:10:58,888 --> 01:10:59,918
I see.

1925
01:11:01,718 --> 01:11:03,358
But I felt like they hadn't been accepting it.

1926
01:11:03,358 --> 01:11:04,658
So I asserted my opinion this time.

1927
01:11:04,888 --> 01:11:06,098
I wanted to see if they'd ignore me on this too.

1928
01:11:06,558 --> 01:11:08,898
It feels like your opinion is different from the other two.

1929
01:11:08,898 --> 01:11:11,268
They can explain the reason to me.

1930
01:11:11,268 --> 01:11:13,198
I clearly said I wanted the chicken quesadilla,

1931
01:11:13,368 --> 01:11:14,768
but they nonchalantly ordered the cheese.

1932
01:11:14,768 --> 01:11:16,138
They said, "Since this one is chicken, let's order the cheese."

1933
01:11:16,138 --> 01:11:18,168
They discussed among themselves and ordered the cheese.

1934
01:11:18,738 --> 01:11:20,138
I don't know.

1935
01:11:21,738 --> 01:11:23,748
Forget the fact that I'm the CEO.

1936
01:11:25,008 --> 01:11:26,748
I'm also the oldest.

1937
01:11:28,248 --> 01:11:29,718
Also, I don't want to bring up the past,

1938
01:11:30,588 --> 01:11:32,618
and Mexico is so nice. I'm enjoying it.

1939
01:11:33,718 --> 01:11:35,888
But I definitely said I wanted to go to Canada in the beginning.

1940
01:11:37,258 --> 01:11:39,358
Why did you go along with his suggestion?

1941
01:11:40,298 --> 01:11:41,458
He looked a bit pitiful.

1942
01:11:43,328 --> 01:11:44,428
In times like this...

1943
01:11:44,968 --> 01:11:46,568
- Once in a while, - Right.

1944
01:11:47,098 --> 01:11:48,538
we have to do what he says...

1945
01:11:49,198 --> 01:11:50,368
for later.

1946
01:11:51,338 --> 01:11:53,308
Right, so we can make a big deal out of it.

1947
01:11:54,038 --> 01:11:55,438
He said we should walk,

1948
01:11:55,578 --> 01:11:57,278
so we're really just walking.

1949
01:11:57,378 --> 01:11:58,378
That's right.

1950
01:11:58,378 --> 01:12:00,448
(Why did you order the cheese quesadilla?)

1951
01:12:00,518 --> 01:12:01,978
Things we feel like...

1952
01:12:02,178 --> 01:12:04,418
we should do for him, we do.

1953
01:12:05,618 --> 01:12:07,288
But this wasn't the case.

1954
01:12:07,288 --> 01:12:08,718
- So you denied him?
- Of course.

1955
01:12:10,388 --> 01:12:11,628
Look, pancakes.

1956
01:12:12,358 --> 01:12:14,228
(Speechless)

1957
01:12:14,228 --> 01:12:15,528
Let's go straight.

1958
01:12:16,328 --> 01:12:17,328
(Raising his hand)

1959
01:12:17,328 --> 01:12:19,368
(Kyung Soo crosses the street.)

1960
01:12:23,868 --> 01:12:26,438
Did you or did you not hear me shout "pancakes?"

1961
01:12:26,708 --> 01:12:27,908
You heard me, right?

1962
01:12:28,178 --> 01:12:31,148
(Kyung Soo seems to not have heard him.)

1963
01:12:32,078 --> 01:12:33,518
Hey, they're selling pancakes.

1964
01:12:33,978 --> 01:12:35,048
Kwang Soo.

1965
01:12:35,878 --> 01:12:37,888
What? What is it? Are we on a schedule?

1966
01:12:39,658 --> 01:12:40,958
This park is pretty.

1967
01:12:41,488 --> 01:12:43,188
- Should we go inside?
- Let's go.

1968
01:12:45,088 --> 01:12:47,598
(They spontaneously decide to explore the park.)

1969
01:12:47,958 --> 01:12:49,968
- The dogs are all so adorable.
- Right.

1970
01:12:51,068 --> 01:12:52,098
They're so cute.

1971
01:12:53,938 --> 01:12:55,098
Gosh, that dog looks cool.

1972
01:12:56,168 --> 01:12:57,608
It's a shepherd.

1973
01:12:58,108 --> 01:12:59,138
Amazing.

1974
01:13:02,008 --> 01:13:03,348
(Laughing)

1975
01:13:03,348 --> 01:13:04,408
So cute.

1976
01:13:05,048 --> 01:13:06,618
What is that? A chihuahua?

1977
01:13:07,378 --> 01:13:09,618
Chihuahuas are a Mexican breed.

1978
01:13:09,618 --> 01:13:10,918
- Really?
- Yes.

1979
01:13:10,918 --> 01:13:12,048
Look at this one.

1980
01:13:12,318 --> 01:13:13,958
- Which one? So cute.
- This one.

1981
01:13:15,688 --> 01:13:18,028
- Its eyes are kind of gray.
- It's so cute.

1982
01:13:18,458 --> 01:13:19,828
- Look at it wag its tail.
- So cute.

1983
01:13:20,458 --> 01:13:22,128
Right. It must be a baby.

1984
01:13:22,128 --> 01:13:24,298
There's a neighbourhood in Mexico called Chihuahua.

1985
01:13:24,328 --> 01:13:25,468
- Really?
- Yes.

1986
01:13:27,338 --> 01:13:28,368
This way.

1987
01:13:31,968 --> 01:13:33,178
Why don't we buy a bottle of water?

1988
01:13:34,308 --> 01:13:36,248
- Let's buy one here and get change.
- Yes.

1989
01:13:37,448 --> 01:13:38,548
Let's go.

1990
01:13:42,988 --> 01:13:43,988
Hello.

1991
01:13:44,918 --> 01:13:47,218
Receipt, please.

1992
01:13:47,218 --> 01:13:49,458
(While the two older members secure the receipt,)

1993
01:13:50,128 --> 01:13:52,528
(Kyung Soo checks the map again.)

1994
01:13:52,528 --> 01:13:54,558
(You're always checking the map.)

1995
01:13:54,558 --> 01:13:55,858
But if I don't...

1996
01:13:56,828 --> 01:13:57,968
You saw what happened.

1997
01:14:00,398 --> 01:14:01,868
I don't know where someone might end up.

1998
01:14:03,768 --> 01:14:05,168
I don't know what someone might do next.

1999
01:14:08,178 --> 01:14:09,408
I just feel anxious.

2000
01:14:10,178 --> 01:14:11,508
I feel so anxious...

2001
01:14:12,178 --> 01:14:13,278
when Woo Bin and Kwang Soo are leading.

2002
01:14:13,848 --> 01:14:16,148
That's why I'm always acting like the guide.

2003
01:14:17,818 --> 01:14:18,888
Did you get the change?

2004
01:14:19,148 --> 01:14:20,188
Let's cross the street then.

2005
01:14:20,188 --> 01:14:21,718
(Back to guide mode)

2006
01:14:21,788 --> 01:14:22,788
Kyung Soo.

2007
01:14:24,028 --> 01:14:25,058
Thank you.

2008
01:14:25,058 --> 01:14:27,128
(But Kyung Soo is also the person the two take care of first.)

2009
01:14:27,128 --> 01:14:28,198
Are we crossing?

2010
01:14:28,628 --> 01:14:30,368
Is it good?

2011
01:14:30,368 --> 01:14:31,698
(How does their first beverage in Mexico taste?)

2012
01:14:31,728 --> 01:14:33,468
(Speechless)

2013
01:14:35,098 --> 01:14:36,138
How should I put this?

2014
01:14:38,508 --> 01:14:39,838
How should I put this?

2015
01:14:40,408 --> 01:14:42,038
- You've said...
- It's like those tacos.

2016
01:14:42,038 --> 01:14:43,708
You've said "How should I put this?" a lot today.

2017
01:14:45,248 --> 01:14:47,318
Is the flavour hard to describe?

2018
01:14:50,388 --> 01:14:51,988
I think the wheels are broken.

2019
01:14:51,988 --> 01:14:54,658
(Kwang Soo's bag feels so heavy that he thinks the wheels are broken.)

2020
01:14:54,788 --> 01:14:56,928
Your bag seems very heavy. Are you okay?

2021
01:14:56,928 --> 01:14:58,688
Are the wheels broken?

2022
01:15:00,998 --> 01:15:03,698
I did ask if you were okay with walking 15 minutes.

2023
01:15:04,898 --> 01:15:06,498
This is a part of travelling.

2024
01:15:07,638 --> 01:15:08,798
We're making memories.

2025
01:15:09,668 --> 01:15:12,268
(His bag is making noise.)

2026
01:15:12,338 --> 01:15:16,148
(Kwang Soo seems overwhelmed by this part of travelling.)

2027
01:15:16,208 --> 01:15:17,348
Kyung Soo, how much longer?

2028
01:15:17,808 --> 01:15:19,548
- This is a hardware store.
- We're almost there.

2029
01:15:20,248 --> 01:15:21,548
(Silent)

2030
01:15:21,548 --> 01:15:23,048
Is it too late to take the transfer route?

2031
01:15:23,918 --> 01:15:24,948
Did we pass it?

2032
01:15:25,788 --> 01:15:27,458
- Kwang Soo.
- I'm just asking.

2033
01:15:27,658 --> 01:15:28,758
What are we doing?

2034
01:15:28,758 --> 01:15:29,828
Did we pass it?

2035
01:15:30,658 --> 01:15:31,688
Kwang Soo.

2036
01:15:32,228 --> 01:15:33,798
- Yes?
- If we decided to transfer instead,

2037
01:15:33,798 --> 01:15:35,898
we would be halfway there by now.

2038
01:15:36,058 --> 01:15:37,368
But we could have gone the opposite direction.

2039
01:15:38,828 --> 01:15:39,838
That's not possible.

2040
01:15:40,468 --> 01:15:42,368
Don't focus on the trees, but look at the forest.

2041
01:15:42,638 --> 01:15:45,338
(The CEO is trying to rationalize his decision.)

2042
01:15:46,338 --> 01:15:49,138
(After the 14-minute walk)

2043
01:15:49,678 --> 01:15:50,848
This is it.

2044
01:15:51,548 --> 01:15:52,608
We're here.

2045
01:15:52,848 --> 01:15:54,018
- We're here?
- Yes.

2046
01:15:56,018 --> 01:15:57,188
I told you we'd get here quickly.

2047
01:15:59,318 --> 01:16:02,558
(They need tickets to take the subway.)

2048
01:16:03,888 --> 01:16:05,458
- Hello.
- Hello.

2049
01:16:06,798 --> 01:16:07,858
Tickets for three?

2050
01:16:08,598 --> 01:16:10,228
That will be 30 pesos.

2051
01:16:10,228 --> 01:16:13,298
It's 15 pesos for the card and 15 pesos to charge it.

2052
01:16:14,238 --> 01:16:15,338
I see.

2053
01:16:15,468 --> 01:16:16,468
I didn't get that.

2054
01:16:16,468 --> 01:16:17,638
(The fast Spanish got them speechless.)

2055
01:16:17,938 --> 01:16:19,438
Can I use a credit card?

2056
01:16:19,438 --> 01:16:20,708
- No?
- No. Cash only.

2057
01:16:21,178 --> 01:16:22,178
Okay.

2058
01:16:23,808 --> 01:16:25,448
- That's the exact amount.
- Thank you.

2059
01:16:25,448 --> 01:16:26,548
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

2060
01:16:27,678 --> 01:16:29,018
We just have to charge it.

2061
01:16:29,018 --> 01:16:30,848
Is one enough?

2062
01:16:31,048 --> 01:16:32,188
For three people?

2063
01:16:32,858 --> 01:16:33,888
Three.

2064
01:16:34,188 --> 01:16:36,288
You can get three rides with it.

2065
01:16:36,288 --> 01:16:37,358
(I see.)

2066
01:16:37,358 --> 01:16:38,528
I think we can.

2067
01:16:38,628 --> 01:16:39,658
Thank you.

2068
01:16:39,798 --> 01:16:41,958
(Pretending to understand as they leave)

2069
01:16:41,958 --> 01:16:43,128
Is she saying that will do?

2070
01:16:43,628 --> 01:16:45,368
- It's enough for three people.
- Let's go scan it first.

2071
01:16:45,368 --> 01:16:46,468
If it doesn't work...

2072
01:16:49,808 --> 01:16:51,738
- Gosh.
- My goodness.

2073
01:16:51,908 --> 01:16:54,938
(They met something rough.)

2074
01:16:56,548 --> 01:17:00,118
(But it's only a chance to exercise for someone.)

2075
01:17:03,218 --> 01:17:04,518
Do I pass it to you after scanning?

2076
01:17:04,548 --> 01:17:06,288
You go first.

2077
01:17:06,788 --> 01:17:08,218
I think we can talk to her.

2078
01:17:08,458 --> 01:17:09,558
You go first.

2079
01:17:09,558 --> 01:17:10,628
(Will they be able to ride the subway safely?)

2080
01:17:12,828 --> 01:17:13,828
(Shouting)

2081
01:17:13,828 --> 01:17:17,428
(He got locked in the barrier.)

2082
01:17:17,798 --> 01:17:20,698
(A passerby)

2083
01:17:20,838 --> 01:17:23,438
(He approaches Woo Bin.)

2084
01:17:24,068 --> 01:17:25,268
- Over there.
- No.

2085
01:17:25,268 --> 01:17:26,308
(She scans the transportation card instead.)

2086
01:17:26,438 --> 01:17:28,138
- Just leave.
- Do I just leave?

2087
01:17:28,808 --> 01:17:30,608
(Passing safely)

2088
01:17:30,608 --> 01:17:31,678
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2089
01:17:32,378 --> 01:17:36,148
(They got to ride the subway by help.)

2090
01:17:38,018 --> 01:17:39,218
- Here it is.
- Yes.

2091
01:17:39,718 --> 01:17:41,018
We're here.

2092
01:17:41,018 --> 01:17:42,458
We have to go here.

2093
01:17:42,858 --> 01:17:43,958
The direction...

2094
01:17:43,958 --> 01:17:45,058
So the direction...

2095
01:17:45,958 --> 01:17:47,098
Isn't it this way?

2096
01:17:48,128 --> 01:17:51,898
(At the moment, the subway arrives.)

2097
01:17:59,438 --> 01:18:00,578
Is this the one?

2098
01:18:00,608 --> 01:18:03,508
(They're not sure if it's the right direction.)

2099
01:18:03,508 --> 01:18:04,878
(Checking the route)

2100
01:18:04,878 --> 01:18:06,178
I think this is right. This is the one.

2101
01:18:06,718 --> 01:18:07,848
- Get in?
- Get in.

2102
01:18:15,358 --> 01:18:17,888
(They got on the subway first.)

2103
01:18:18,358 --> 01:18:20,028
(Still anxious)

2104
01:18:20,958 --> 01:18:22,328
This is the one. We're on the right subway.

2105
01:18:22,628 --> 01:18:23,698
We're going in the right direction.

2106
01:18:24,268 --> 01:18:25,468
- What's the next station?
- We have to...

2107
01:18:25,468 --> 01:18:27,338
- go 12 stations.
- Is this the right direction?

2108
01:18:27,338 --> 01:18:28,398
Yes.

2109
01:18:29,038 --> 01:18:30,308
Kwang Soo, come here.

2110
01:18:30,308 --> 01:18:33,208
(Relieved when Kyung Soo checks)

2111
01:18:34,208 --> 01:18:36,678
(Checking out the subway)

2112
01:18:36,678 --> 01:18:38,678
I think this subway is pretty new.

2113
01:18:38,678 --> 01:18:39,778
You think so?

2114
01:18:40,218 --> 01:18:41,748
It's pretty pleasant.

2115
01:18:42,988 --> 01:18:45,448
And the window is open.

2116
01:18:46,048 --> 01:18:47,758
The windows are left open.

2117
01:18:48,958 --> 01:18:50,188
It's refreshing.

2118
01:18:50,828 --> 01:18:52,188
- Only the windows are open.
- I know.

2119
01:18:52,188 --> 01:18:54,458
(The Mexican subways ride with windows open)

2120
01:18:56,158 --> 01:18:57,468
The wind is so strong...

2121
01:18:57,468 --> 01:18:58,928
that my eyes are watering.

2122
01:18:58,928 --> 01:19:01,538
(Blinking)

2123
01:19:02,198 --> 01:19:03,768
My eyes are tearing, Kwang Soo.

2124
01:19:05,668 --> 01:19:08,608
(Blocking the wind)

2125
01:19:08,608 --> 01:19:10,208
(Glancing)

2126
01:19:10,208 --> 01:19:12,608
(Laughing)

2127
01:19:12,608 --> 01:19:13,778
Do you get data?

2128
01:19:14,918 --> 01:19:16,648
Type Mexico wrestling. See if it works.

2129
01:19:17,048 --> 01:19:20,618
(Mexican wrestling lucha libre is taking place today.)

2130
01:19:20,918 --> 01:19:22,618
- I'm not getting data in here.
- Right?

2131
01:19:22,618 --> 01:19:24,558
(But no data inside the subway)

2132
01:19:25,488 --> 01:19:28,498
(Writing something)

2133
01:19:28,758 --> 01:19:29,828
Excuse me.

2134
01:19:30,068 --> 01:19:33,298
(Trying to communicate using his phone)

2135
01:19:33,638 --> 01:19:34,898
What did you ask?

2136
01:19:34,898 --> 01:19:36,298
Where the pro wrestling is taking place.

2137
01:19:38,008 --> 01:19:39,778
(They can't get access...)

2138
01:19:39,778 --> 01:19:42,508
(because they don't get data either.)

2139
01:19:43,208 --> 01:19:45,508
(Trying to communicate using the phone)

2140
01:19:48,078 --> 01:19:49,788
Oh, it's on your phone.

2141
01:19:49,788 --> 01:19:50,988
(Yes.)

2142
01:19:50,988 --> 01:19:52,488
I have no choice but to approach her.

2143
01:19:53,058 --> 01:19:54,758
(Giving back the memo)

2144
01:19:54,888 --> 01:19:56,018
Arena...

2145
01:19:56,018 --> 01:19:57,158
(They got the information on the stadium.)

2146
01:19:57,158 --> 01:19:58,588
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2147
01:19:58,588 --> 01:19:59,588
(Kindness opens up the traveller's heart.)

2148
01:19:59,588 --> 01:20:00,628
Where is it taking place?

2149
01:20:02,298 --> 01:20:03,668
We're from Korea.

2150
01:20:04,098 --> 01:20:05,198
Korea.

2151
01:20:05,928 --> 01:20:07,098
- Korean.
- Korean.

2152
01:20:07,098 --> 01:20:09,068
- Korean.
- Oh, Korean.

2153
01:20:09,068 --> 01:20:10,768
(They also reveal their nationality.)

2154
01:20:12,308 --> 01:20:14,338
(Staggering)

2155
01:20:14,338 --> 01:20:15,338
(Grabbing)

2156
01:20:16,208 --> 01:20:17,308
Thank you.

2157
01:20:20,778 --> 01:20:21,948
I felt like...

2158
01:20:22,918 --> 01:20:25,148
I became one with Mexico.

2159
01:20:26,218 --> 01:20:27,788
- I'm serious.
- Why?

2160
01:20:27,888 --> 01:20:28,958
- What?
- Why?

2161
01:20:28,958 --> 01:20:30,888
- He stopped me when I almost fell.
- Really?

2162
01:20:30,888 --> 01:20:32,128
So we made eye contact.

2163
01:20:38,228 --> 01:20:40,138
- Bye.
- Bye.

2164
01:20:40,698 --> 01:20:41,798
- Thank you.
- It was nice meeting you.

2165
01:20:42,398 --> 01:20:45,208
(The other passengers get off first.)

2166
01:20:46,308 --> 01:20:48,338
It feels like my friends are going home first.

2167
01:20:48,338 --> 01:20:49,578
- It's sad.
- Yes.

2168
01:20:50,048 --> 01:20:51,478
It feels like they got off first...

2169
01:20:51,748 --> 01:20:53,078
after school.

2170
01:20:53,778 --> 01:20:54,848
(Bye.)

2171
01:20:54,848 --> 01:20:56,448
- Bye.
- Bye.

2172
01:20:56,448 --> 01:20:57,788
- You can do it.
- I can do it. Thank you.

2173
01:20:57,788 --> 01:20:58,888
(The passenger who scanned their card)

2174
01:20:58,888 --> 01:21:00,218
We're getting off here too.

2175
01:21:00,218 --> 01:21:01,758
(We're getting off here too.)

2176
01:21:01,758 --> 01:21:02,958
Let's get off after her.

2177
01:21:02,988 --> 01:21:04,228
She might be embarrassed.

2178
01:21:09,498 --> 01:21:11,868
(As soon as they get off the subway,)

2179
01:21:12,898 --> 01:21:15,638
(the deadly stairs begin again.)

2180
01:21:19,168 --> 01:21:22,208
(For someone, it's an anaerobic exercise.)

2181
01:21:22,578 --> 01:21:24,378
(Groaning)

2182
01:21:24,378 --> 01:21:27,918
(While someone's just struggling.)

2183
01:21:29,678 --> 01:21:31,218
- I need to lie down.
- What?

2184
01:21:31,218 --> 01:21:32,388
I need to lie down in the hotel.

2185
01:21:35,658 --> 01:21:37,158
This place feels different.

2186
01:21:37,258 --> 01:21:38,928
- It's a big city.
- Yes.

2187
01:21:39,788 --> 01:21:41,098
Check out this building.

2188
01:21:44,228 --> 01:21:45,998
This isn't Mexico I was expecting.

2189
01:21:47,298 --> 01:21:49,768
This is real Mexico City.

2190
01:21:49,838 --> 01:21:50,838
Totally.

2191
01:21:50,938 --> 01:21:51,968
It's downtown.

2192
01:21:51,968 --> 01:21:54,478
(Roma Norte feels like a big city.)

2193
01:21:55,278 --> 01:21:57,148
(Spotting something)

2194
01:21:57,148 --> 01:21:58,448
Woo Bin, get your shoes...

2195
01:21:58,748 --> 01:22:00,178
- What?
- Get your shoes clean.

2196
01:22:01,678 --> 01:22:02,918
(What caught Kyung Soo's attention is...)

2197
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:04,318
They have this.

2198
01:22:06,388 --> 01:22:07,818
They're shoe polishers.

2199
01:22:07,818 --> 01:22:09,958
(Shoe polishers)

2200
01:22:09,958 --> 01:22:11,628
Can they polish my white shoes?

2201
01:22:12,328 --> 01:22:13,858
- They were actually...
- They need to be polished.

2202
01:22:13,858 --> 01:22:15,398
- They got pretty dirty.
- Right.

2203
01:22:15,928 --> 01:22:17,128
- Kwang Soo.
- Want to try the shoe polisher?

2204
01:22:17,128 --> 01:22:18,298
Should I get my shoes polished?

2205
01:22:18,298 --> 01:22:20,068
- Do what?
- Polish my shoes.

2206
01:22:20,368 --> 01:22:22,168
- Where's the shoe polisher?
- They're all shoe polishers.

2207
01:22:22,368 --> 01:22:24,068
- Try it.
- Do they polish white shoes too?

2208
01:22:24,068 --> 01:22:25,168
But I'm afraid...

2209
01:22:25,508 --> 01:22:26,978
they'll become a different colour.

2210
01:22:28,678 --> 01:22:30,648
Even if they become a different colour,

2211
01:22:30,648 --> 01:22:31,708
you have to say thank you and get off the chair.

2212
01:22:31,708 --> 01:22:33,218
I bought them for this trip.

2213
01:22:33,218 --> 01:22:34,378
(Precious)

2214
01:22:34,648 --> 01:22:35,918
Ask if it's possible.

2215
01:22:36,048 --> 01:22:37,518
- Should I ask them at least?
- Let's go.

2216
01:22:39,188 --> 01:22:40,358
- Hello.
- Hello.

2217
01:22:40,358 --> 01:22:41,418
- Hello.
- Hello.

2218
01:22:41,558 --> 01:22:43,388
Can we get our shoes polished?

2219
01:22:43,628 --> 01:22:44,728
They're white.

2220
01:22:44,728 --> 01:22:45,888
- He says yes.
- Yes?

2221
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:47,098
He says yes.

2222
01:22:47,228 --> 01:22:49,158
How much?

2223
01:22:49,698 --> 01:22:50,798
Fifty pesos.

2224
01:22:50,968 --> 01:22:52,068
Fifty?

2225
01:22:52,698 --> 01:22:53,898
Five?

2226
01:22:53,898 --> 01:22:55,468
- How much is it?
- Five pesos.

2227
01:22:55,468 --> 01:22:56,568
- Five pesos?
- Yes.

2228
01:22:56,708 --> 01:22:57,938
(Reducing the price by a 10th)

2229
01:22:57,938 --> 01:22:59,238
Why am I getting nervous?

2230
01:23:00,508 --> 01:23:02,578
He's the master.

2231
01:23:03,908 --> 01:23:05,908
You wore dress shoes for this.

2232
01:23:05,908 --> 01:23:06,978
Right.

2233
01:23:07,678 --> 01:23:08,978
Should I ask him too?

2234
01:23:12,518 --> 01:23:13,618
(Wait.)

2235
01:23:13,618 --> 01:23:14,988
With bubbles?

2236
01:23:14,988 --> 01:23:16,858
He only polishes them.

2237
01:23:17,388 --> 01:23:20,858
(Shoe polishing begins.)

2238
01:23:20,858 --> 01:23:22,598
He only cleans outside.

2239
01:23:22,798 --> 01:23:24,428
He'll start something.

2240
01:23:25,128 --> 01:23:26,298
- He...
- He put something on.

2241
01:23:26,298 --> 01:23:27,598
You got a line.

2242
01:23:28,198 --> 01:23:29,338
I got a line?

2243
01:23:29,338 --> 01:23:30,468
No.

2244
01:23:31,138 --> 01:23:32,238
Wait.

2245
01:23:32,508 --> 01:23:34,178
Was the line that thick?

2246
01:23:34,638 --> 01:23:35,778
Was it there before?

2247
01:23:35,838 --> 01:23:36,978
I don't remember.

2248
01:23:37,778 --> 01:23:40,218
- It wasn't there before.
- I don't know if it's in my head,

2249
01:23:40,578 --> 01:23:42,578
but I feel like my toes are getting wet.

2250
01:23:43,318 --> 01:23:44,348
What's happening?

2251
01:23:44,348 --> 01:23:46,318
- I think it's moist.
- Is it?

2252
01:23:46,318 --> 01:23:48,618
Is the leather getting wet?

2253
01:23:50,288 --> 01:23:51,888
What's that line over there?

2254
01:23:51,888 --> 01:23:53,758
- That line...
- That wasn't there before.

2255
01:23:53,758 --> 01:23:55,198
I'm not sure if it feels moist...

2256
01:23:55,598 --> 01:23:58,028
because I'm nervous.

2257
01:23:58,528 --> 01:24:01,198
Besides, he said he could do it.

2258
01:24:01,338 --> 01:24:02,938
Right. He wasn't flustered.

2259
01:24:04,308 --> 01:24:08,208
(However, they can't stop looking at the shoes.)

2260
01:24:08,538 --> 01:24:09,878
How much are those shoes?

2261
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:11,008
- Five pesos.
- Five pesos.

2262
01:24:11,008 --> 01:24:12,478
No, your shoes.

2263
01:24:12,648 --> 01:24:14,118
- These shoes? A thousand dollars.
- Yes.

2264
01:24:14,618 --> 01:24:15,748
- Really?
- Yes.

2265
01:24:18,548 --> 01:24:19,888
He's straining his fingers more...

2266
01:24:19,888 --> 01:24:21,488
than before.

2267
01:24:21,718 --> 01:24:23,218
- Done.
- Done?

2268
01:24:24,088 --> 01:24:25,358
Thank you.

2269
01:24:25,358 --> 01:24:26,528
But...

2270
01:24:26,958 --> 01:24:28,028
But...

2271
01:24:28,928 --> 01:24:30,528
In the sun,

2272
01:24:31,598 --> 01:24:33,638
they look like the dust is off.

2273
01:24:33,638 --> 01:24:35,138
- Five pesos.
- Five pesos?

2274
01:24:36,068 --> 01:24:37,238
(Inhaling)

2275
01:24:37,238 --> 01:24:38,708
They got wet, though.

2276
01:24:39,068 --> 01:24:40,608
- Right? They're moist.
- Yes.

2277
01:24:40,608 --> 01:24:42,008
The leather got wet.

2278
01:24:43,208 --> 01:24:45,248
- The leather got wet.
- You're right.

2279
01:24:47,648 --> 01:24:48,778
(Paying a 10th the price with confidence)

2280
01:24:48,778 --> 01:24:49,818
That's five pesos.

2281
01:24:51,448 --> 01:24:52,848
- That's five pesos.
- I don't have...

2282
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:54,588
It's five pesos,

2283
01:24:54,588 --> 01:24:55,758
and I only have ten.

2284
01:24:55,988 --> 01:24:57,658
- It's not 5. It's 50.
- I don't have 5 pesos.

2285
01:24:57,888 --> 01:24:59,088
Fifty?

2286
01:24:59,728 --> 01:25:01,398
It's 50, not 5?

2287
01:25:03,668 --> 01:25:05,268
Still, it's only 3.50 dollars.

2288
01:25:05,668 --> 01:25:07,968
(Fortunately, they pay the full price.)

2289
01:25:08,868 --> 01:25:10,208
(He pays 100 pesos and gets 50 pesos back.)

2290
01:25:10,208 --> 01:25:11,368
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2291
01:25:11,508 --> 01:25:12,608
Thank you.

2292
01:25:13,238 --> 01:25:14,278
And...

2293
01:25:15,408 --> 01:25:16,678
It's yours. Thank you.

2294
01:25:16,678 --> 01:25:17,878
- Tip.
- Thank you.

2295
01:25:17,878 --> 01:25:18,908
(Although his feet are wet, he pays a generous tip.)

2296
01:25:18,908 --> 01:25:20,218
But...

2297
01:25:20,448 --> 01:25:21,818
if you look here,

2298
01:25:22,018 --> 01:25:23,178
there's a line.

2299
01:25:24,188 --> 01:25:26,348
No. I got those marks...

2300
01:25:26,718 --> 01:25:29,018
- when I was moving the luggage.
- Really?

2301
01:25:29,018 --> 01:25:30,958
They're not from polishing the shoes.

2302
01:25:30,958 --> 01:25:32,458
It's not that you got them from polishing the shoes.

2303
01:25:32,458 --> 01:25:33,498
They just...

2304
01:25:33,498 --> 01:25:34,698
became clear.

2305
01:25:36,058 --> 01:25:37,528
- Look.
- You're lying.

2306
01:25:37,528 --> 01:25:39,068
No, look. Look here.

2307
01:25:39,068 --> 01:25:40,498
I think they were there before.

2308
01:25:40,498 --> 01:25:41,638
- It's okay.
- Let's go.

2309
01:25:42,368 --> 01:25:44,208
We still have to experience it. Let's go.

2310
01:25:44,208 --> 01:25:47,438
- Yes, it'll all be memories.
- Woo Bin is a curious one.

2311
01:25:47,438 --> 01:25:48,978
(Woo Bin is a curious one.)

2312
01:25:49,478 --> 01:25:51,408
I've seen it...

2313
01:25:51,408 --> 01:25:53,108
- on "Backpack Travels." - Really?

2314
01:25:53,108 --> 01:25:54,378
I saw the shoe polishers.

2315
01:25:55,018 --> 01:25:56,018
I've always wanted to try it.

2316
01:25:56,018 --> 01:25:57,848
It's past the check-in time.

2317
01:25:57,848 --> 01:25:59,418
- We can check in right away.
- That's perfect.

2318
01:25:59,418 --> 01:26:00,788
It begins at 3pm.

2319
01:26:00,788 --> 01:26:01,958
(On their way to the hotel)

2320
01:26:02,658 --> 01:26:03,828
(Glancing)

2321
01:26:05,328 --> 01:26:07,028
I can't stop looking at my shoes.

2322
01:26:07,498 --> 01:26:09,998
(He can't stop looking at the moist presence.)

2323
01:26:11,998 --> 01:26:14,098
I think this restaurant is popular.

2324
01:26:14,938 --> 01:26:16,838
- This one.
- Here?

2325
01:26:16,938 --> 01:26:19,468
- What's that place?
- It's popular.

2326
01:26:19,468 --> 01:26:22,108
Right. I think they sell matcha latte or something.

2327
01:26:22,108 --> 01:26:23,108
(The matcha cafe)

2328
01:26:25,148 --> 01:26:26,678
It's right here.

2329
01:26:26,878 --> 01:26:28,878
- Right. It says Caliza Roma.
- Caliza Roma.

2330
01:26:29,218 --> 01:26:31,048
Our hotel is really nice.

2331
01:26:31,048 --> 01:26:32,618
Right. When we wake up in the morning,

2332
01:26:32,618 --> 01:26:34,458
we can have morning coffee here.

2333
01:26:35,218 --> 01:26:36,788
Every morning,

2334
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:38,658
- Liar. Stop lying.
- I'll buy a latte here...

2335
01:26:38,658 --> 01:26:40,128
and start my day by jogging.

2336
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:41,228
- Really?
- Yes.

2337
01:26:41,228 --> 01:26:42,458
(A hopeful version of a perfect life)

2338
01:26:42,628 --> 01:26:44,698
(Right now, it's 3pm.)

2339
01:26:44,768 --> 01:26:46,998
(They finally enter the hotel.)

2340
01:26:47,068 --> 01:26:48,068
Hello.

2341
01:26:50,908 --> 01:26:54,438
- I made a reservation under Kim.
- Yes.

2342
01:26:55,908 --> 01:26:57,148
This is your receipt.

2343
01:26:57,148 --> 01:26:58,148
It's the information...

2344
01:26:58,148 --> 01:26:59,148
- of your reservation.
- Yes.

2345
01:26:59,378 --> 01:27:00,378
Yes.

2346
01:27:00,378 --> 01:27:03,378
You're going to find your name, check-in, and check-out dates.

2347
01:27:03,718 --> 01:27:05,588
And the full amount has already been paid.

2348
01:27:05,948 --> 01:27:08,258
I need a signature on that invoice, please.

2349
01:27:08,258 --> 01:27:09,288
Okay.

2350
01:27:09,888 --> 01:27:11,388
So three nights, right?

2351
01:27:11,388 --> 01:27:12,388
- Yes.
- Yes.

2352
01:27:13,188 --> 01:27:15,098
It's 730 dollars for 3 nights.

2353
01:27:15,098 --> 01:27:16,728
- It's really cheap.
- That's a very good price.

2354
01:27:17,168 --> 01:27:18,468
You found a nice spot.

2355
01:27:20,128 --> 01:27:21,568
But I wonder what it's like inside.

2356
01:27:21,668 --> 01:27:23,808
It's 80 dollars per person for a night.

2357
01:27:25,538 --> 01:27:26,638
This way.

2358
01:27:26,808 --> 01:27:30,648
(How's the room they were doubting?)

2359
01:27:30,708 --> 01:27:32,478
- Nice.
- Nice.

2360
01:27:32,478 --> 01:27:34,378
What? Kwang Soo, the room is so nice.

2361
01:27:34,378 --> 01:27:35,748
This is unbelievable.

2362
01:27:36,078 --> 01:27:37,418
Nice.

2363
01:27:37,718 --> 01:27:39,488
I guess this building is pretty new.

2364
01:27:39,488 --> 01:27:40,688
I guess so.

2365
01:27:41,888 --> 01:27:43,088
There's even a washer.

2366
01:27:43,528 --> 01:27:46,258
(Unlike their worries, the room is satisfactory.)

2367
01:27:47,128 --> 01:27:48,458
How is this possible?

2368
01:27:49,658 --> 01:27:50,898
I mean, look at the room.

2369
01:27:50,998 --> 01:27:52,368
There are four beds.

2370
01:27:52,428 --> 01:27:53,568
Really?

2371
01:27:54,238 --> 01:27:55,598
Four beds?

2372
01:27:55,898 --> 01:27:57,268
We found a perfect place.

2373
01:27:57,638 --> 01:27:58,938
- Wait.
- There's also a terrace.

2374
01:27:58,938 --> 01:28:00,208
Let me dry my shoes.

2375
01:28:02,478 --> 01:28:06,208
(Spending time to polish himself)

2376
01:28:06,608 --> 01:28:08,078
Gosh.

2377
01:28:08,118 --> 01:28:09,878
- Isn't the room nice?
- It's so nice.

2378
01:28:10,218 --> 01:28:11,418
Did you check inside?

2379
01:28:11,448 --> 01:28:12,888
My room is very nice too.

2380
01:28:13,288 --> 01:28:15,418
If you see a room like this,

2381
01:28:15,418 --> 01:28:16,658
- you're very happy.
- Yes.

2382
01:28:16,658 --> 01:28:19,328
(He sits next to Auditor Kim as if he has something to say.)

2383
01:28:21,058 --> 01:28:23,198
When the auditor's here,

2384
01:28:23,198 --> 01:28:25,228
- let's settle the balance.
- Sure.

2385
01:28:25,428 --> 01:28:28,438
We need to get paid for the flight first.

2386
01:28:29,038 --> 01:28:30,268
- He...
- What?

2387
01:28:30,608 --> 01:28:32,238
- followed us from the head office.
- Really?

2388
01:28:32,238 --> 01:28:33,308
Hello.

2389
01:28:34,008 --> 01:28:35,478
He's right below CEO Ko.

2390
01:28:35,478 --> 01:28:37,648
- He's in charge of finance.
- Yes.

2391
01:28:37,648 --> 01:28:39,408
You always had meals with CEO Ko.

2392
01:28:39,408 --> 01:28:40,648
Right.

2393
01:28:41,418 --> 01:28:43,518
To tell you about him, he studied abroad.

2394
01:28:43,518 --> 01:28:44,648
Yes, he looks like one.

2395
01:28:44,648 --> 01:28:46,418
He majored in math at UC Berkeley.

2396
01:28:46,648 --> 01:28:48,418
- He must be good at math.
- So you can't even rip him off...

2397
01:28:48,418 --> 01:28:50,158
even for a penny.

2398
01:28:50,528 --> 01:28:52,558
- Really?
- How do we...

2399
01:28:53,088 --> 01:28:54,258
How do we pay?

2400
01:28:54,358 --> 01:28:56,968
How much can they spend?

2401
01:28:57,568 --> 01:29:01,668
The amount we paid in advance for you is...

2402
01:29:01,668 --> 01:29:06,538
- about 10,738.80 dollars.
- What?

2403
01:29:07,008 --> 01:29:08,578
- Why?
- What did we do?

2404
01:29:09,038 --> 01:29:10,778
- You took the flight.
- Oh, the flight.

2405
01:29:10,778 --> 01:29:11,778
You think you got here by ship?

2406
01:29:11,778 --> 01:29:13,048
(Speechless)

2407
01:29:13,108 --> 01:29:14,648
- Jun Wi?
- Yes.

2408
01:29:14,648 --> 01:29:15,778
How old are you?

2409
01:29:16,048 --> 01:29:17,518
I was born in 1991.

2410
01:29:17,518 --> 01:29:18,988
You're six years younger.

2411
01:29:21,118 --> 01:29:22,158
Jun Wi, come sit here.

2412
01:29:22,158 --> 01:29:23,758
(CEO Lee tries to get the drop.)

2413
01:29:24,588 --> 01:29:26,528
- Then...
- Let's first send them the money.

2414
01:29:26,888 --> 01:29:30,128
(Delivering the account number and the amount to be received)

2415
01:29:30,158 --> 01:29:31,598
Why are you so heartless?

2416
01:29:32,728 --> 01:29:35,298
(Send 10,738.80 dollars!)

2417
01:29:35,738 --> 01:29:37,608
- Wait.
- We should...

2418
01:29:37,768 --> 01:29:38,868
But...

2419
01:29:40,478 --> 01:29:41,608
there's a limit.

2420
01:29:42,638 --> 01:29:44,108
To prevent financial fraud,

2421
01:29:44,108 --> 01:29:46,048
I can only send 2,000 dollars a day.

2422
01:29:46,048 --> 01:29:47,448
We'll send it later.

2423
01:29:49,018 --> 01:29:50,248
We'll send 2,000 dollars first.

2424
01:29:50,248 --> 01:29:51,888
There's a limit.

2425
01:29:52,548 --> 01:29:54,718
Then you can get up...

2426
01:29:54,718 --> 01:29:57,088
and start your day by sending 2,000 dollars.

2427
01:29:57,158 --> 01:29:58,358
(The production crew would never let that slide.)

2428
01:29:58,358 --> 01:29:59,428
Seriously...

2429
01:30:00,528 --> 01:30:02,228
- I sent 2,000 dollars first.
- Okay.

2430
01:30:02,828 --> 01:30:04,328
You can send that for five days,

2431
01:30:04,798 --> 01:30:07,798
and on your 6th day, send me 738.80 dollars.

2432
01:30:07,798 --> 01:30:08,868
Jun Wi, we know.

2433
01:30:10,268 --> 01:30:12,568
I'm sorry, but we'll take care of that.

2434
01:30:12,808 --> 01:30:15,038
You have more than enough time before you go back to Korea.

2435
01:30:16,078 --> 01:30:18,748
While we have money in this account,

2436
01:30:19,648 --> 01:30:22,118
we get ten dollars a day for interest.

2437
01:30:23,648 --> 01:30:25,788
- Did we get interest?
- We got interest.

2438
01:30:26,588 --> 01:30:28,058
- Nice.
- So...

2439
01:30:28,218 --> 01:30:30,758
- it's a gain for us.
- Right.

2440
01:30:31,228 --> 01:30:34,058
If it's the company money,

2441
01:30:34,598 --> 01:30:36,658
the interest also belongs to the company.

2442
01:30:36,828 --> 01:30:38,368
You should give it to us for free.

2443
01:30:38,368 --> 01:30:39,528
Not for free.

2444
01:30:39,528 --> 01:30:41,168
- That's...
- It's our investment technique.

2445
01:30:41,668 --> 01:30:43,538
It's our account.

2446
01:30:44,508 --> 01:30:46,008
Right, the account...

2447
01:30:46,008 --> 01:30:48,138
- You're right.
- It's my account.

2448
01:30:49,278 --> 01:30:52,708
That means the interest is ours.

2449
01:30:52,778 --> 01:30:54,918
Yes, this doesn't even need to be discussed.

2450
01:30:55,118 --> 01:30:57,548
With ten dollars,

2451
01:30:57,548 --> 01:30:58,818
- Yes, ten dollars.
- we can get a taco.

2452
01:30:58,818 --> 01:30:59,888
Okay. You can keep it.

2453
01:31:01,188 --> 01:31:02,588
It's not that we can keep it.

2454
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:05,128
- You're not giving it to us.
- No.

2455
01:31:05,128 --> 01:31:07,128
- Look.
- You said you received it.

2456
01:31:07,128 --> 01:31:10,128
He got that interest for his personal account.

2457
01:31:10,128 --> 01:31:11,928
Sure. You can use it.

2458
01:31:12,098 --> 01:31:15,398
(Ten dollars could lead to a big fight.)

2459
01:31:15,468 --> 01:31:16,938
Hold on.

2460
01:31:17,038 --> 01:31:20,578
We need to look up how much it costs to go to Cancun from here.

2461
01:31:20,578 --> 01:31:22,208
(They're suddenly worried if they have enough budget.)

2462
01:31:22,838 --> 01:31:25,608
(Writing down the expected expenditures)

2463
01:31:25,808 --> 01:31:27,918
We have to rent a car to go to Cancun.

2464
01:31:28,378 --> 01:31:29,918
Because the traffic is too heavy.

2465
01:31:29,918 --> 01:31:30,918
(Expenditure 1, rent-a-car to Cancun)

2466
01:31:31,018 --> 01:31:34,118
We need to rent a car to check out Cancun.

2467
01:31:34,258 --> 01:31:36,888
For the rent-a-car,

2468
01:31:36,988 --> 01:31:38,528
we have to exclude 560 dollars.

2469
01:31:39,088 --> 01:31:40,258
The flight to Cancun.

2470
01:31:40,258 --> 01:31:41,658
(Expenditure 2, flight to Cancun)

2471
01:31:42,098 --> 01:31:43,558
How much is the flight?

2472
01:31:43,628 --> 01:31:45,528
It's 300 dollars per person.

2473
01:31:45,528 --> 01:31:46,728
- Nine hundred?
- Nine hundred?

2474
01:31:47,298 --> 01:31:48,568
Anything else?

2475
01:31:49,268 --> 01:31:50,768
We should stay in the hotel on the beach.

2476
01:31:50,768 --> 01:31:52,508
But it's pretty cheap if we find a place through Airbnb.

2477
01:31:52,608 --> 01:31:53,638
Even on the beach?

2478
01:31:54,108 --> 01:31:56,308
Are we going there for five days?

2479
01:31:56,478 --> 01:31:58,378
That's 1,200 dollars.

2480
01:31:58,378 --> 01:31:59,648
(Additional 1,200 dollars for the hotel)

2481
01:31:59,648 --> 01:32:00,648
Exclude 1,200 dollars.

2482
01:32:00,648 --> 01:32:03,048
Wait. Think about it.

2483
01:32:03,048 --> 01:32:05,648
- We...
- We have to pay for the tickets.

2484
01:32:06,348 --> 01:32:10,628
To play in the water also costs money.

2485
01:32:11,728 --> 01:32:14,458
(The expenditures give him a headache.)

2486
01:32:14,558 --> 01:32:15,728
What is this?

2487
01:32:16,458 --> 01:32:18,768
Jun Wi, I'm sorry, but you need to leave my house.

2488
01:32:20,268 --> 01:32:22,838
We need to include the money we're going to spend.

2489
01:32:22,938 --> 01:32:25,038
These two are most urgent.

2490
01:32:25,668 --> 01:32:27,808
Let's resolve these first.

2491
01:32:28,608 --> 01:32:31,208
Then spend the rest on food.

2492
01:32:31,208 --> 01:32:32,908
(Is KKPP Foods culture expedition going to be okay?)

2493
01:32:34,101 --> 01:32:37,501
(The perfect night to begin the Mexico expedition)

2494
01:32:37,530 --> 01:32:39,260
It was my childhood dream.

2495
01:32:39,990 --> 01:32:42,630
(Watching Mexican pro wrestling in person)

2496
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:44,770
- Over here.
- It's so crowded.

2497
01:32:44,795 --> 01:32:45,825
Let's try this.

2498
01:32:45,850 --> 01:32:47,650
- This is a real taco.
- Let's do that.

2499
01:32:48,101 --> 01:32:50,771
(Trying the real local taco)

2500
01:32:51,071 --> 01:32:52,701
Oh, yes. I wanted to play this.

2501
01:32:52,771 --> 01:32:55,171
Finally, it feels like we're travelling.

2502
01:32:55,871 --> 01:32:56,971
One, two, three.

2503
01:32:56,971 --> 01:33:01,011
(Building precious memories with best friends)

2504
01:33:01,551 --> 01:33:03,181
(This is what I expected from Mexico.)

2505
01:33:03,751 --> 01:33:06,421
(This is for girls.)

2506
01:33:07,651 --> 01:33:09,021
We can't even spend 25 dollars?

2507
01:33:09,151 --> 01:33:10,921
We have to share even one can of energy drink.

2508
01:33:10,921 --> 01:33:11,991
What are you talking about?

2509
01:33:11,991 --> 01:33:14,131
(But how can I wear this when I'm 40?)

2510
01:33:14,431 --> 01:33:16,561
- Can I have one more sip?
- No more.

2511
01:33:16,691 --> 01:33:18,601
It's 2 sips for a person, and you had 3 sips already.

2512
01:33:18,601 --> 01:33:19,661
Okay.

2513
01:33:19,661 --> 01:33:23,101
(The expedition is losing composure due to the tight budget.)

2514
01:33:23,231 --> 01:33:24,541
Get a beer.

2515
01:33:24,771 --> 01:33:25,841
I will.

2516
01:33:25,901 --> 01:33:26,941
I'm sorry.

2517
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:29,220
We spent 20 to 30 dollars on lunch.

2518
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:30,650
We spent four times more.

2519
01:33:30,650 --> 01:33:33,750
(The tight budget causes tension in the expedition.)

2520
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:34,960
Hold on.

2521
01:33:35,460 --> 01:33:36,990
(Do we have to travel like this?)

2522
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:38,430
We're poor.

2523
01:33:38,660 --> 01:33:40,190
Okay.

2524
01:33:40,660 --> 01:33:43,030
(The CEO who's given up on protecting his pride)

2525
01:33:43,130 --> 01:33:45,200
A discount, please.

2526
01:33:45,330 --> 01:33:48,540
(And the auditor who whispers a discount with his sweet low voice)

2527
01:33:48,970 --> 01:33:50,200
Hey, wake up.

2528
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:53,110
Will you? Go wash your face.

2529
01:33:53,470 --> 01:33:56,380
(And the director who's dazed due to the jet lag)

2530
01:33:56,580 --> 01:33:57,750
I need to talk to him.

2531
01:33:57,750 --> 01:33:59,750
I don't know.

2532
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:04,390
He needs physical contact.

2533
01:34:04,490 --> 01:34:05,590
A slap.
