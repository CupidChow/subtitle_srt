(Course 2, Mexican-style breakfast buffet)

12
00:00:46,352 --> 00:00:47,562
I want to try it.

How many tons of rocks were used for these pyramids?

17
00:00:59,272 --> 00:01:00,772
The answer is 2.5 million tons, right?

18
00:01:01,042 --> 00:01:03,442

00:01:09,042 --> 00:01:10,542
Woo Bin, aren't you hungry?

21
00:01:10,782 --> 00:01:12,712
You're a bit hungry, right? Let's eat something before we leave.

22
00:01:13,082 --> 00:01:14,951
We should try that nogada dish, right?

23
00:01:14,952 --> 00:01:16,652
- You're hungry, right?
-  A little bit.

24
00:01:18,092 --> 00:01:19,952
Let's go and eat that nogada dish.

25
00:01:20,392 --> 00:01:21,561
- Thank you for your hard work.
-  Thank you.

00:01:21,562 --> 00:01:22,691

- Kyung Soo.
-  Yes?

28
00:01:23,822 --> 00:01:25,031
Kwang Soo, come here for a second.

29
00:01:25,032 --> 00:01:27,702
How much should we tip our friend Nan Do?

30
00:01:28,002 --> 00:01:29,301
- What?
-  How much should we tip him?

31
00:01:29,302 --> 00:01:30,531
- Our guide?
-  Yes.

32
00:01:30,532 --> 00:01:31,532
(They begin having a meeting to decide on the tip.)

33
00:01:32,202 --> 00:01:33,272
How about 100 pesos?

34
00:01:33,432 --> 00:01:34,802
That's too little.

35
00:01:35,472 --> 00:01:36,602
How about 500 pesos?

36
00:01:37,612 --> 00:01:38,942
How much is 500 pesos?

37
00:01:39,472 --> 00:01:41,242
I don't really understand pesos.

38
00:01:41,282 --> 00:01:43,111
The amount of 500 pesos is about 35 to 40 dollars.

39
00:01:43,112 --> 00:01:44,282
Isn't it too little?

40
00:01:44,812 --> 00:01:46,052
How much do you tip a guide?

41
00:01:46,112 --> 00:01:48,382
How much do you tip a guide? How much should we give him?

42
00:01:48,652 --> 00:01:50,321
- About ten percent.
-  What?

43
00:01:50,322 --> 00:01:51,651
- It's ten percent, right?
-  Ten percent.

44
00:01:51,652 --> 00:01:53,192
The cost of the tour was...

45
00:01:53,652 --> 00:01:55,591
about 2,000 dollars.

46
00:01:55,592 --> 00:01:56,662
(Including 3 staff members)

47
00:01:57,362 --> 00:01:58,961
Shouldn't we give him 2,000 pesos?

48
00:01:58,962 --> 00:02:00,292
That's right. The amount of 2,000 pesos is...

49
00:02:00,492 --> 00:02:01,602
How much is 2,000 pesos?

50
00:02:02,302 --> 00:02:03,501
It's about 15 dollars.

51
00:02:03,502 --> 00:02:04,832
- We should give him that much.
-  That's right.

52
00:02:05,232 --> 00:02:06,902
We need to give him more.

53
00:02:06,932 --> 00:02:09,472
- But right now...
-  We're short on money.

54
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,171
Shall we give him 2,000 pesos then?

55
00:02:12,172 --> 00:02:13,342
- That sounds good.
-  Okay.

56
00:02:13,412 --> 00:02:16,912
(Through a meeting, they decide on the amount to show their gratitude.)

57
00:02:18,212 --> 00:02:20,782
I didn't know that pack tours were this great.

58
00:02:21,582 --> 00:02:23,282
- Isn't it so convenient?
-  I know.

59
00:02:23,622 --> 00:02:25,222
I go on a package tour sometimes when I travel.

60
00:02:25,652 --> 00:02:29,461
If you're unlikely to visit the place again,

61
00:02:29,462 --> 00:02:30,622
it's better...

62
00:02:31,032 --> 00:02:32,932
- to listen to the commentary.
-  That's right.

63
00:02:33,562 --> 00:02:36,432
It's much better to enjoy the sight after listening to the information.

64
00:02:36,602 --> 00:02:38,232
It was nothing.

65
00:02:38,732 --> 00:02:40,972
I simply told you what I knew.

66
00:02:41,572 --> 00:02:42,971
The man from Gyeongsan is the best.

67
00:02:42,972 --> 00:02:44,471
(The tour was physically draining, but informative.)

68
00:02:44,472 --> 00:02:45,872
He knows what Orange Street is.

69
00:02:46,872 --> 00:02:49,911
(Counting)

70
00:02:49,912 --> 00:02:52,111
(Recording their expenses)

71
00:02:52,112 --> 00:02:54,782
(Even on the road, the auditor worries about the balance.)

72
00:02:55,622 --> 00:02:57,382
I'm so stressed out.

73
00:02:57,582 --> 00:02:58,891
(He talks about his hardships to the head office.)

74
00:02:58,892 --> 00:03:00,052
Seriously.

75
00:03:01,092 --> 00:03:03,192
I'm under so much pressure.

76
00:03:05,132 --> 00:03:07,592
I didn't get any receipts today.

77
00:03:09,662 --> 00:03:11,472
That'll be a problem.

78
00:03:12,202 --> 00:03:13,432
We're practically ruined.

79
00:03:15,172 --> 00:03:18,542
(The auditor looks out the window sadly.)

80
00:03:18,972 --> 00:03:20,211
(They enter Mexico City.)

81
00:03:20,212 --> 00:03:22,042
We entered Mexico City.

82
00:03:24,012 --> 00:03:25,282
It makes me feel at ease.

83
00:03:27,822 --> 00:03:28,982
I see a gym.

84
00:03:29,252 --> 00:03:30,982
(Woo Bin spots a gym in the city.)

85
00:03:31,152 --> 00:03:32,752
Are you guys going to go to a gym today?

86
00:03:33,692 --> 00:03:35,022
We were going to do that, but...

87
00:03:36,222 --> 00:03:37,892
While you guys exercise,

88
00:03:39,092 --> 00:03:40,592
I'm going to go and eat tripe tacos one more time.

89
00:03:41,832 --> 00:03:43,062
Are you saying that you aren't going to exercise?

90
00:03:43,132 --> 00:03:44,732
(Nodding)

91
00:03:45,002 --> 00:03:46,172
What's wrong with you?

92
00:03:46,872 --> 00:03:48,872
How could you resist those tacos, Kwang Soo?

93
00:03:49,672 --> 00:03:51,672
- We can do both.
-  What?

94
00:03:52,012 --> 00:03:53,672
How could you exercise right now?

95
00:03:54,242 --> 00:03:55,612
How could you eat tacos right now?

96
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:58,211
So that's what it sounds like.

97
00:03:58,212 --> 00:04:00,181
(The cool-headed mirror therapy from the gentle older member)

98
00:04:00,182 --> 00:04:01,851
There's no way you can exercise.

99
00:04:01,852 --> 00:04:04,122
Let's go and see. Think about it after eating.

100
00:04:04,252 --> 00:04:05,652
Don't make a rash decision.

101
00:04:06,252 --> 00:04:08,122
That's right. After eating, you might have strength.

102
00:04:08,722 --> 00:04:09,762
But...

103
00:04:13,492 --> 00:04:15,532
will I be able to lift weights?

104
00:04:17,332 --> 00:04:19,901
- It'll be impossible.
-  To go to a gym,

105
00:04:19,902 --> 00:04:21,302
we need to take a quick nap.

106
00:04:22,072 --> 00:04:24,041
- It'll be impossible.
-  We can't go right away.

107
00:04:24,042 --> 00:04:26,772
- It'll be bad for your health.
-  That's right.

108
00:04:27,982 --> 00:04:29,482
I don't think I can lift a block of toilet paper.

109
00:04:30,782 --> 00:04:31,912
That's how I'm feeling.

110
00:04:35,422 --> 00:04:37,622
Even when I think about them now, tripe tacos were so tasty.

111
00:04:39,092 --> 00:04:40,952
Thinking about them makes my mouth water.

112
00:04:42,222 --> 00:04:44,162
Shall I go and buy them after lunch?

113
00:04:44,862 --> 00:04:46,062
- Buy what? Tacos?
-  Yes.

114
00:04:46,762 --> 00:04:50,331
But tripe tacos should be eaten on the spot.

115
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:51,932
That's right. They're tasty when they're eaten right away.

116
00:04:52,332 --> 00:04:54,872
(They can taste the tripe tacos in their mouths.)

117
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:57,501
- Their tacos are very tasty too.
-  That stall?

118
00:04:57,502 --> 00:04:59,611
Their tacos are very tasty.

119
00:04:59,612 --> 00:05:00,672
Right now...

120
00:05:01,312 --> 00:05:02,911
Which tacos are tasty there?

121
00:05:02,912 --> 00:05:05,211
All the tacos they have are tasty.

122
00:05:05,212 --> 00:05:07,351
That taco stall is very popular.

123
00:05:07,352 --> 00:05:09,082
Is it a taste you must try?

124
00:05:10,682 --> 00:05:13,392
They'll be a bit different from the tripe tacos you had.

125
00:05:13,622 --> 00:05:15,722
Tacos you get on the street are always the tastiest.

126
00:05:15,922 --> 00:05:17,161
- Really?
-  They're tasty in a different way.

127
00:05:17,162 --> 00:05:20,261
- We had tacos on the street, - Okay.

128
00:05:20,262 --> 00:05:21,701
but they didn't suit our tastes.

129
00:05:21,702 --> 00:05:22,731
Really?

130
00:05:22,732 --> 00:05:23,862
(They haven't been successful with street tacos.)

131
00:05:23,962 --> 00:05:26,502
At that stall, you pick the meat first.

132
00:05:26,732 --> 00:05:29,172
Then they fry the meat and put it on the top.

133
00:05:29,372 --> 00:05:33,072
You can add sauces and other ingredients of your choice.

134
00:05:33,272 --> 00:05:35,312
Then it'll be tasty.

135
00:05:36,212 --> 00:05:37,342
Let's go and eat one.

136
00:05:37,852 --> 00:05:38,912
I'm for that idea.

137
00:05:39,782 --> 00:05:41,652
Let's only eat one each.

138
00:05:42,952 --> 00:05:44,692
Do they accept cards?

139
00:05:45,092 --> 00:05:46,391
It's cash only.

140
00:05:46,392 --> 00:05:47,492
- Is it cash only?
-  Yes.

141
00:05:48,622 --> 00:05:49,762
Things aren't easy.

142
00:05:50,992 --> 00:05:53,232
But since we have Nan Do with us,

143
00:05:53,762 --> 00:05:55,132
we should ask for a receipt.

144
00:05:55,502 --> 00:05:57,932
(They decide to eat street tacos before going to the restaurant.)

145
00:06:00,232 --> 00:06:02,742
We're eating tacos on our way to the restaurant.

146
00:06:04,542 --> 00:06:06,371
A place like this makes me excited, to be honest.

147
00:06:06,372 --> 00:06:08,582
That's right. You feel great when such food tastes good.

148
00:06:09,312 --> 00:06:10,612
I think it'll be tasty.

149
00:06:12,012 --> 00:06:13,552
That one looks very tasty.

150
00:06:13,982 --> 00:06:14,982
It's minced meat.

151
00:06:14,983 --> 00:06:17,052
(The tacos are made to order.)

152
00:06:17,722 --> 00:06:19,452
The popular menu is...

153
00:06:20,022 --> 00:06:22,422
arrachera, which is...

154
00:06:23,062 --> 00:06:24,732
the Mexican-style cured beef.

155
00:06:24,962 --> 00:06:27,432
The texture is similar to that of ham.

156
00:06:28,432 --> 00:06:29,962
- One.
-  I want this one.

157
00:06:30,162 --> 00:06:31,162
Same here.

158
00:06:31,532 --> 00:06:33,271
- Arrachera.
-  Yes.

159
00:06:33,272 --> 00:06:34,572
Let's order the same one.

160
00:06:35,142 --> 00:06:36,942
- Let's not give a bite.
-  Okay.

161
00:06:37,372 --> 00:06:39,112
Three arrachera tacos, please.

162
00:06:39,172 --> 00:06:41,482
I think they accept cards.

163
00:06:41,682 --> 00:06:43,312
- Do you accept cards?
-  Yes.

164
00:06:43,482 --> 00:06:45,312
For 3 tacos, it's 123 pesos.

165
00:06:45,352 --> 00:06:46,882
(Relieved)

166
00:06:47,652 --> 00:06:49,151
Only this stall has so many customers.

167
00:06:49,152 --> 00:06:50,552
(The auditor feels much more at ease.)

168
00:06:52,192 --> 00:06:53,351
I can't wait.

169
00:06:53,352 --> 00:06:55,062
Thank goodness we decided to eat here.

170
00:06:55,222 --> 00:06:56,522
I would've regretted it so much.

171
00:06:57,492 --> 00:06:58,831
Do we add ingredients as we want?

172
00:06:58,832 --> 00:07:01,502
Yes. These are beans.

173
00:07:01,862 --> 00:07:03,031
You can add beans.

174
00:07:03,032 --> 00:07:04,462
These two are sauces.

175
00:07:04,502 --> 00:07:05,801
- What kind of sauces are they?
-  Salsa.

176
00:07:05,802 --> 00:07:08,171
Both contain chilis.

177
00:07:08,172 --> 00:07:10,171
This one contains avocados...

178
00:07:10,172 --> 00:07:11,541
- and cilantro.
-  I want this one.

179
00:07:11,542 --> 00:07:13,111
This one contains tomatoes.

180
00:07:13,112 --> 00:07:14,142
I want this one.

181
00:07:15,212 --> 00:07:17,282
(Arrachera tacos come out quickly.)

182
00:07:20,282 --> 00:07:21,352
It looks tasty.

183
00:07:21,422 --> 00:07:22,721
(Arrachera taco: A juicy taco made with tender beef...)

184
00:07:22,722 --> 00:07:24,081
(that was marinated in lime juice)

185
00:07:24,082 --> 00:07:26,192
Let's add a bit at a time.

186
00:07:26,452 --> 00:07:27,592
Why don't we eat half each?

187
00:07:28,362 --> 00:07:29,392
Like this.

188
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:33,361
(It's complete once you add the fillings and sauces.)

189
00:07:33,362 --> 00:07:36,362
- You can add more.
-  The sauces are very...

190
00:07:36,862 --> 00:07:38,132
I'm so curious.

191
00:07:40,932 --> 00:07:44,712
(How is the taste of the street stall taco?)

192
00:07:46,312 --> 00:07:49,812
What exactly did we eat on the street earlier?

193
00:07:50,242 --> 00:07:51,411
- Is it tasty?
-  It's so tasty.

194
00:07:51,412 --> 00:07:52,582
- Really?
-  Yes.

195
00:07:53,352 --> 00:07:55,081
The meat is so tasty.

196
00:07:55,082 --> 00:07:56,082
(Chewing)

197
00:07:57,282 --> 00:08:02,122
(The man who isn't greedy about food, Woo Bin, takes a bite.)

198
00:08:02,762 --> 00:08:04,162
- It's tasty.
-  Yes.

199
00:08:04,462 --> 00:08:05,662
- Is it tasty?
-  Yes.

200
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:08,961
Did we eat the wrong tacos so far?

201
00:08:08,962 --> 00:08:10,032
Yes.

202
00:08:11,062 --> 00:08:13,202
This is what Mexicans eat.

203
00:08:14,632 --> 00:08:16,872
- Seriously.
-  It's really tasty.

204
00:08:19,342 --> 00:08:20,811
You have to add salsa.

205
00:08:20,812 --> 00:08:22,542
(My goodness)

206
00:08:22,812 --> 00:08:24,482
It's the Mexican taco I've always imagined.

207
00:08:25,012 --> 00:08:27,181
That's right. This is the taste I've imagined.

208

(The taste of a Mexican taco)

209
00:08:28,452 --> 00:08:29,821
It's so tasty.

210
00:08:29,822 --> 00:08:32,552
(He's about to eat the plate.)

211
00:08:32,592 --> 00:08:35,462
Your eyes didn't shine this much at Teotihuacan.

212
00:08:36,922 --> 00:08:39,862
(No civilization can beat tacos in the director's opinion.)

213
00:08:40,892 --> 00:08:44,462
I want to try other things because this taco is so tasty.

214
00:08:45,732 --> 00:08:48,171
But I think I'll be too full if I eat more.

215
00:08:48,172 --> 00:08:49,172
(His mouth wants more, but he suppresses the urge.)

216
00:08:49,173 --> 00:08:50,902
(His eyes are fixed on Woo Bin's plate.)

217
00:08:51,002 --> 00:08:52,242
How are these beans?

218
00:08:52,572 --> 00:08:54,041
(His hands move faster than his rationality.)

219
00:08:54,042 --> 00:08:55,141
Beans are tasty too.

220
00:08:55,142 --> 00:08:56,342
(His hands move faster than his rationality.)

221
00:08:56,842 --> 00:08:59,512
- There's the savory taste of beans.
-  They're tasty.

222
00:09:00,212 --> 00:09:01,782
- It's a bit different.
-  You know,

223
00:09:01,952 --> 00:09:04,281
- we can't call it the same dish.
-  It's a bit different.

224
00:09:04,282 --> 00:09:05,551
The two kinds are different.

225
00:09:05,552 --> 00:09:07,092
Both are very tasty,

226
00:09:07,152 --> 00:09:09,161
but they're completely different.

227
00:09:09,162 --> 00:09:10,762
(You can't say which taco is better.)

00:09:11,962 --> 00:09:15,102
(GBRB: Joy Pops Laugh Pops)

229
00:09:15,632 --> 00:09:18,202
(It's time to say goodbye to Guide Nan Do.)

230
00:09:18,232 --> 00:09:20,701
- This comes from our hearts.
-  You don't need to do that.

231
00:09:20,702 --> 00:09:22,871
- I've gotten enough.
-  Please take it.

232
00:09:22,872 --> 00:09:24,242
(They deliver the tip with gratitude.)

233
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,471
- Thank you so much.
-  Thank you.

234
00:09:26,472 --> 00:09:28,312
Thank you for enjoying my commentary.

235
00:09:28,382 --> 00:09:30,742
- You enriched our trip to Mexico.
-  Thank you.

236
00:09:30,912 --> 00:09:32,752
- Good luck with the remaining trip.
-  Okay.

237
00:09:32,782 --> 00:09:34,382
Shall we have a hug, my friend Nan Do?

238
00:09:34,512 --> 00:09:35,922
My friend from Gyeongsan.

239
00:09:36,352 --> 00:09:38,052
Thank you. Safe travels.

240
00:09:39,222 --> 00:09:40,351
Thank you.

241
00:09:40,352 --> 00:09:41,591
- Thank you for your hard work.
-  Thank you for your hard work.

242
00:09:41,592 --> 00:09:42,991
- Have a nice meal.
-  Stay healthy.

243
00:09:42,992 --> 00:09:44,362
- Thank you.
-  Thank you.

244
00:09:45,332 --> 00:09:46,431
We'll enter when it opens.

245
00:09:46,432 --> 00:09:48,601
We didn't know that this restaurant was right by the hotel.

246
00:09:48,602 --> 00:09:49,602
Seriously.

247
00:09:50,262 --> 00:09:51,301
What?

248
00:09:51,302 --> 00:09:52,571
(The restaurant is near the hotel.)

249
00:09:52,572 --> 00:09:53,572
That's the place.

250
00:09:54,232 --> 00:09:56,172
You're right. That's the place.

251
00:09:56,442 --> 00:09:57,471
The nogada dish.

252
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:59,042
Those are pomegranate seeds.

253
00:10:00,212 --> 00:10:01,481
- Hello.
-  Hello.

254
00:10:01,482 --> 00:10:03,642
(A restaurant that was recommended by Guide Nan Do)

255
00:10:04,582 --> 00:10:05,851
Shall we sit here?

256
00:10:05,852 --> 00:10:06,852
- That's a good idea.
-  Let's do that.

257
00:10:07,312 --> 00:10:09,651
We know what we'll get.

258
00:10:09,652 --> 00:10:10,682
Yes.

259
00:10:10,752 --> 00:10:12,351
- The nogada dish...
-  The nogada dish...

260
00:10:12,352 --> 00:10:13,691
- Mole.
-  and mole.

261
00:10:13,692 --> 00:10:14,752
Mole.

262
00:10:15,762 --> 00:10:17,462
Let's order one traditional dish.

263
00:10:17,722 --> 00:10:18,831
"Seasonal chilies."

264
00:10:18,832 --> 00:10:21,332
"Red tomato sauce that was made with the 1,000-year-old meat."

265
00:10:22,532 --> 00:10:23,802
It's 1,000 years old?

266
00:10:25,532 --> 00:10:26,931
Isn't the translation wrong?

267
00:10:26,932 --> 00:10:28,002
Right?

268
00:10:28,442 --> 00:10:30,172
That means it's as old as the pyramids we just saw.

269
00:10:30,272 --> 00:10:33,071
(The meat is as old as the pyramids.)

270
00:10:33,072 --> 00:10:34,112
Seriously.

271
00:10:34,712 --> 00:10:36,381
Shall we ask for a recommendation?

272
00:10:36,382 --> 00:10:37,541
That might be better.

273
00:10:37,542 --> 00:10:40,711
Excuse me. Chili en nogada?

274
00:10:40,712 --> 00:10:42,121
- Chiles en nogada?
-  Yes.

275
00:10:42,122 --> 00:10:45,752
Right now, it's the season of chiles en nogada. Okay?

276
00:10:45,892 --> 00:10:47,452
I have six options.

277
00:10:47,752 --> 00:10:51,362
The regular options are pork and beef.

278
00:10:51,762 --> 00:10:55,662
And seasonal fruits...

279
00:10:56,202 --> 00:10:59,502
And there's one more. This is the last one.

280
00:10:59,572 --> 00:11:00,701
- Okay.
-  It's different.

281
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:02,442
It isn't a fruit. It isn't sweet.

282
00:11:02,702 --> 00:11:04,772
(Kwang Soo's ears catch the last chiles en nogada option.)

283
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,972
Let's order this one and the traditional one.

284
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:09,841
- Those two?
-  No.

285
00:11:09,842 --> 00:11:10,842
That one.

286
00:11:10,843 --> 00:11:12,152
No sugar.

287
00:11:12,452 --> 00:11:15,022
- One.
-  Okay.

288
00:11:15,152 --> 00:11:16,782
- Traditional.
-  Okay.

289
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:18,291
One. Okay.

290
00:11:18,292 --> 00:11:19,522
- One.
-  Okay.

291
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:21,661
Mole poblano.

292
00:11:21,662 --> 00:11:22,861
Okay. One.

293
00:11:22,862 --> 00:11:24,192
- Thank you.
-  Thank you.

294
00:11:25,032 --> 00:11:26,631
(Salsa appears.)

295
00:11:26,632 --> 00:11:28,202
- Thank you.
-  House salsa.

296
00:11:28,302 --> 00:11:29,302
- Salsa.
-  Salsa.

297
00:11:29,303 --> 00:11:32,071
It's a combination of chilies and peanuts.

298
00:11:32,072 --> 00:11:33,171
- I see.
-  Enjoy.

299
00:11:33,172 --> 00:11:34,571
Their salsa is unique.

300
00:11:34,572 --> 00:11:36,471
It's salsa made with chilies and peanuts.

301
00:11:36,472 --> 00:11:39,442
- It's different in each restaurant.
-  You're right.

302
00:11:41,042 --> 00:11:42,442
It's very thick.

303
00:11:45,382 --> 00:11:47,252
(He smells it carefully.)

304
00:11:48,152 --> 00:11:51,422
(Taking a bite)

305
00:11:51,822 --> 00:11:54,021
(Copying the director)

306
00:11:54,022 --> 00:11:57,022
(The CEO takes a bite as well.)

307
00:11:58,232 --> 00:11:59,831
How should I describe it?

308
00:11:59,832 --> 00:12:01,332
Is it like peanut butter?

309
00:12:01,492 --> 00:12:03,331
There's no sweetness whatsoever.

310
00:12:03,332 --> 00:12:05,332
- Sour?
-  It's sour and salty.

311
00:12:05,672 --> 00:12:07,672
There's the aroma of sesame.

312
00:12:09,342 --> 00:12:10,742
It's definitely tasty.

313
00:12:11,612 --> 00:12:12,872
What's this taste?

314
00:12:14,112 --> 00:12:15,481
(Woo Bin is silent.)

315
00:12:15,482 --> 00:12:17,712
- I can't describe the taste.
-  It's hard, right?

316
00:12:18,082 --> 00:12:19,182
Are you guys loading data again?

317
00:12:19,682 --> 00:12:21,481
It definitely tastes like peanut butter.

318
00:12:21,482 --> 00:12:23,682
(Kwang Soo's description gets loaded first.)

319
00:12:24,122 --> 00:12:25,822
It tastes like peanut butter, right?

320
00:12:26,852 --> 00:12:29,091
- Sour peanut butter.
-  Be quiet.

321
00:12:29,092 --> 00:12:30,822
- My goodness.
-  I can't think.

322
00:12:32,762 --> 00:12:34,391
Sour peanut butter and...

323
00:12:34,392 --> 00:12:35,431
(He keeps going.)

324
00:12:35,432 --> 00:12:39,502
Spicy... Sour and spicy peanut butter.

325
00:12:39,632 --> 00:12:42,942
You know, he isn't wrong.

326
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:45,371
- Seriously.
-  Describe it better if you can.

327
00:12:45,372 --> 00:12:46,972
Describe it better if you can.

328
00:12:47,742 --> 00:12:49,341
Peanut butter.

329
00:12:49,342 --> 00:12:50,642
It's a bit like...

330
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,381
It's like gruel.

331
00:12:52,382 --> 00:12:53,382
(The director steps in amidst the confusing description.)

332
00:12:53,383 --> 00:12:54,512
It has the texture of gruel.

333
00:12:54,782 --> 00:12:57,152
We eat gruel made of pine nuts.

334
00:12:57,422 --> 00:12:59,852
It has that texture.

335
00:13:00,852 --> 00:13:03,222
The taste is a mix of majiang sauce and Tabasco.

336
00:13:03,822 --> 00:13:05,231
It tastes like majiang sauce.

337
00:13:05,232 --> 00:13:07,992
A mix of majiang sauce and Tabasco.

338
00:13:09,462 --> 00:13:11,971
(Touching his ring)

339
00:13:11,972 --> 00:13:13,471
Doesn't it feel good?

340
00:13:13,472 --> 00:13:14,802
I can't help but touch it.

341
00:13:15,702 --> 00:13:17,202
It feels nice.

342
00:13:17,442 --> 00:13:18,641
Did you guys buy rings?

343
00:13:18,642 --> 00:13:19,712
Yes, we did.

344
00:13:19,812 --> 00:13:21,542
In front of the pyramid.

345
00:13:22,182 --> 00:13:23,211
Kyung Soo lost...

346
00:13:23,212 --> 00:13:25,112
our friendship bracelet almost right away yesterday.

347
00:13:26,452 --> 00:13:28,011
(Quickly hiding his empty wrist)

348
00:13:28,012 --> 00:13:29,051
- Where did it go?
-  If...

349
00:13:29,052 --> 00:13:30,581
you lose this ring,

350
00:13:30,582 --> 00:13:31,822
let's just end our friendship.

351
00:13:32,552 --> 00:13:34,121
- Let's stop shooting.
-  I will never lose it.

352
00:13:34,122 --> 00:13:35,122
(I will never lose it.)

353
00:13:35,592 --> 00:13:37,321
We found a delicious taco place.

354
00:13:37,322 --> 00:13:39,062
(Bragging about the taco place.)

355
00:13:39,332 --> 00:13:41,392
Woo Bin said it was even better than the tripe tacos.

356
00:13:41,532 --> 00:13:43,101
(It's Woo Bin's holy taco place.)

357
00:13:43,102 --> 00:13:44,161
For real.

358
00:13:44,162 --> 00:13:45,602
Woo Bin...

359
00:13:45,832 --> 00:13:47,772
likes it when...

360
00:13:48,102 --> 00:13:49,342
there's a bit more protein.

361
00:13:49,742 --> 00:13:50,942
It's important.

362
00:13:51,342 --> 00:13:53,312
- It definitely had more protein.
-  Yes.

363
00:13:53,772 --> 00:13:55,442
No wonder I felt at ease.

364
00:13:55,982 --> 00:13:59,052
(Protein Pops, Joy Pops)

365
00:13:59,152 --> 00:14:00,382
We can't find the place.

366
00:14:00,782 --> 00:14:03,252
You guys can't try it.

367
00:14:04,322 --> 00:14:06,052
We don't know where it is, but really...

368
00:14:06,452 --> 00:14:08,192
They were amazing street tacos.

369
00:14:08,662 --> 00:14:09,792
You want to try them, right?

370
00:14:10,922 --> 00:14:12,092
Sorry.

371
00:14:13,932 --> 00:14:16,762
(Will they be able to find good food here too?)

372
00:14:17,262 --> 00:14:18,601
It's here.

373
00:14:18,602 --> 00:14:19,671
Okay, you guys.

374
00:14:19,672 --> 00:14:21,202
(Their orders are here.)

375
00:14:21,432 --> 00:14:23,141
This is the salty one,

376
00:14:23,142 --> 00:14:24,472
the chile salado.

377
00:14:24,942 --> 00:14:26,871
This is another chiles en nogada.

378
00:14:26,872 --> 00:14:28,341
It's a traditional dish.

379
00:14:28,342 --> 00:14:29,611
This is traditional.

380
00:14:29,612 --> 00:14:30,941
Okay?

381
00:14:30,942 --> 00:14:32,351
This one is sweeter.

382
00:14:32,352 --> 00:14:34,382
This is sweet. This one isn't sweet.

383
00:14:34,482 --> 00:14:35,882
This is the sweet one.

384
00:14:36,222 --> 00:14:37,482
- The mole sauce.
-  Did we order it?

385
00:14:37,682 --> 00:14:39,052
The mole sauce.

386
00:14:39,622 --> 00:14:41,052
This must be it.

387
00:14:41,552 --> 00:14:43,662
- This is the tortilla for the mole.
-  I know what this is.

388
00:14:43,722 --> 00:14:44,722
- Tortilla.
-  Thank you.

389
00:14:44,723 --> 00:14:45,791
- Together with the mole.
-  I know.

390
00:14:45,792 --> 00:14:47,731
(I know.)

391
00:14:47,732 --> 00:14:49,332
- It looks pretty.
-  Right?

392
00:14:50,102 --> 00:14:51,161
These right here.

393
00:14:51,162 --> 00:14:53,031
The green, red, and white colors are...

394
00:14:53,032 --> 00:14:54,232
The Mexican flag.

395
00:14:54,632 --> 00:14:56,941
To think it'd be served as a whole.

396
00:14:56,942 --> 00:14:57,971
- It's really pretty.
-  Let's...

397
00:14:57,972 --> 00:14:59,141
try the sauce on three.

398
00:14:59,142 --> 00:15:00,142
Okay.

399
00:15:02,312 --> 00:15:03,441
One, two...

400
00:15:03,442 --> 00:15:04,582
(Woo Bin ate it already.)

401
00:15:04,842 --> 00:15:05,912
One, two...

402
00:15:06,312 --> 00:15:07,882
(Trying it in a rush)

403
00:15:09,822 --> 00:15:10,822
(Impressed)

404
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:16,491
It's good, but...

405
00:15:16,492 --> 00:15:18,561
(Trying to explain the taste, but buffering again)

406
00:15:18,562 --> 00:15:20,491
It reminds me of pine nut porridge.

407
00:15:20,492 --> 00:15:21,832
Isn't it pine?

408
00:15:22,632 --> 00:15:23,902
- It's pine, right?
-  Yes.

409
00:15:24,002 --> 00:15:25,631
It's good, but I've never had...

410
00:15:25,632 --> 00:15:27,171
- a dish like this before.
-  Right?

411
00:15:27,172 --> 00:15:28,302
Shall I cut it?

412
00:15:29,572 --> 00:15:30,702
Is it moist?

413
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:32,972
It's not crispy.

414
00:15:33,472 --> 00:15:35,481
(He cuts the chili.)

415
00:15:35,482 --> 00:15:37,041
- The inside is stuffed.
-  What?

416
00:15:37,042 --> 00:15:38,912
- Meat.
-  It's stuffed with meat.

417
00:15:39,252 --> 00:15:42,621
Meat, onions, mushrooms, and more.

418
00:15:42,622 --> 00:15:43,651
(Stuffed with stir-fried ingredients)

419
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:46,391
The chili has been stuffed with ingredients,

420
00:15:46,392 --> 00:15:47,521
just like dumplings.

421
00:15:47,522 --> 00:15:48,822
Just like during Chuseok.

422
00:15:48,962 --> 00:15:50,421
- Right?
-  It's like fried chili peppers.

423
00:15:50,422 --> 00:15:51,721
- Even the meat inside.
-  Exactly.

424
00:15:51,722 --> 00:15:52,762
(Similar to Korea's fried chili peppers)

425
00:15:52,962 --> 00:15:54,762
- Shall we try it?
-  Yes.

426
00:15:57,962 --> 00:15:59,602
It reminds me of a cake.

427
00:16:00,972 --> 00:16:02,872
I think we should try it all at once.

428
00:16:03,472 --> 00:16:06,812
(Trying a mouthful)

429
00:16:10,142 --> 00:16:14,611
(The employees also take a bite)

430
00:16:14,612 --> 00:16:15,652
Wait.

431
00:16:16,382 --> 00:16:17,851
(Amazed)

432
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:19,191
This itself is sweet.

433
00:16:19,192 --> 00:16:20,492
It's sweet.

434
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:22,622
Even the filling is sweet.

435
00:16:22,662 --> 00:16:24,661
They must've added sugar to the filling too.

436
00:16:24,662 --> 00:16:26,162
But the sweetness isn't like regular sugar.

437
00:16:26,262 --> 00:16:28,292
It's sweet like braised short ribs.

438
00:16:28,332 --> 00:16:29,602
It tastes like one.

439
00:16:30,132 --> 00:16:32,002
You can occasionally taste bits of pomegranate.

440
00:16:32,832 --> 00:16:35,242
You can taste the pomegranate and nuts, right?

441
00:16:35,672 --> 00:16:36,801
But it's good.

442
00:16:36,802 --> 00:16:38,812
What is the main ingredient of the white sauce?

443
00:16:39,742 --> 00:16:40,942
- Is it a quiz?
-  Yes.

444
00:16:41,572 --> 00:16:42,642
Sesame.

445
00:16:43,382 --> 00:16:44,842
- Sesame?
-  I don't think it's sesame.

446
00:16:45,882 --> 00:16:47,811
(What's the white sauce called "nogada?")

447
00:16:47,812 --> 00:16:49,151
- I don't know.
-  It tastes...

448
00:16:49,152 --> 00:16:51,052
too mild to be pine nuts.

449
00:16:51,122 --> 00:16:52,351
- It's weaker than pine nuts.
-  Oatmeal.

450
00:16:52,352 --> 00:16:54,252
- Isn't it oatmeal?
-  Oatmeal?

451
00:16:54,752 --> 00:16:56,822
What has a weaker taste than pine nuts?

452
00:16:58,362 --> 00:17:00,131
(The taste buds are figuring it out.)

453
00:17:00,132 --> 00:17:01,861
- Walnuts.
-  Correct.

454
00:17:01,862 --> 00:17:03,202
- Really?
-  Nice.

455
00:17:03,262 --> 00:17:05,571
(He's impressed by his sharp taste buds)

456
00:17:05,572 --> 00:17:06,771
- Walnuts.
-  So, ground walnuts...

457
00:17:06,772 --> 00:17:07,932
are used for the sauce.

458
00:17:08,332 --> 00:17:09,941
- It's good.
-  Yes, it's delicious.

459
00:17:09,942 --> 00:17:11,941
It gives off a dessert vibe.

460
00:17:11,942 --> 00:17:13,071
- Yes.
-  Totally.

461
00:17:13,072 --> 00:17:14,172
(Chiles en nogada means chili covered in walnut sauce.)

462
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:16,111
How is it? Would you recommend it?

463
00:17:16,112 --> 00:17:17,241
- It's good.
-  Yes, for real.

464
00:17:17,242 --> 00:17:18,781
- People should try it.
-  It's delicious.

465
00:17:18,782 --> 00:17:20,711
It's not something you'd be repulsed by.

466
00:17:20,712 --> 00:17:21,781
After trying this dish,

467
00:17:21,782 --> 00:17:23,352
I'm more excited about the next one.

468
00:17:23,522 --> 00:17:25,052
The staff said it wasn't sweet.

469
00:17:25,122 --> 00:17:27,191
- I bet this tastes better.
-  Yes, you're right.

470
00:17:27,192 --> 00:17:28,252
This one.

471
00:17:29,322 --> 00:17:33,292
(How's the unsweet chiles en nogada?)

472
00:17:35,832 --> 00:17:36,902
This is...

473
00:17:37,562 --> 00:17:38,601
made...

474
00:17:38,602 --> 00:17:39,932
with pistachio.

475
00:17:40,832 --> 00:17:42,441
Did they use pistachios instead of walnuts?

476
00:17:42,442 --> 00:17:43,502
Yes.

477
00:17:44,002 --> 00:17:46,111
This is pistachio sauce.

478
00:17:46,112 --> 00:17:48,142
No wonder the color is slightly different.

479
00:17:48,342 --> 00:17:49,942
That one's sweet, while this one's salty.

480
00:17:50,012 --> 00:17:51,281
Yes, this one is...

481
00:17:51,282 --> 00:17:52,282
(The unsweetened sauce is salty.)

482
00:17:53,282 --> 00:17:55,211
This one also tastes a bit like pine nut porridge.

483
00:17:55,212 --> 00:17:57,022
- Yes, it's like pine nut porridge.
-  Pine nut porridge.

484
00:17:57,282 --> 00:17:58,751
The filling is different.

485
00:17:58,752 --> 00:18:00,022
- Is it?
-  Yes.

486
00:18:00,692 --> 00:18:02,661
It reminds me of a ragu sauce.

487
00:18:02,662 --> 00:18:03,961
- I see.
-  Tomato-based.

488
00:18:03,962 --> 00:18:05,122
It sounds good.

489
00:18:05,832 --> 00:18:06,991
- You're right.
-  Right?

490
00:18:06,992 --> 00:18:08,662
- It's completely different.
-  Exactly.

491
00:18:09,932 --> 00:18:11,432
This tastes like pizza.

492
00:18:12,202 --> 00:18:13,932
It gives off lasagna vibes.

493
00:18:14,402 --> 00:18:15,872
Yes, lasagna.

494
00:18:16,272 --> 00:18:17,272
- I prefer this one.
-  Me too.

495
00:18:17,273 --> 00:18:18,772
I like this one more.

496
00:18:18,912 --> 00:18:20,841
The traditional one tastes better.

497
00:18:20,842 --> 00:18:22,442
If you were to recommend one...

498
00:18:23,312 --> 00:18:25,651
The dish is filled with different ingredients...

499
00:18:25,652 --> 00:18:27,082
and tastes different.

500
00:18:27,952 --> 00:18:29,522
Here's what it's like.

501
00:18:29,582 --> 00:18:31,522
You attend a wedding...

502
00:18:32,122 --> 00:18:33,722
and eat at the buffet.

503
00:18:34,152 --> 00:18:36,292
- You get everything on one plate, - It's all mixed?

504
00:18:37,062 --> 00:18:38,422
- Mixed?
-  the braised short ribs...

505
00:18:39,162 --> 00:18:41,061
and the dessert end up...

506
00:18:41,062 --> 00:18:42,801
- mixed together.
-  Exactly.

507
00:18:42,802 --> 00:18:43,962
- Right?
-  You're on the mark.

508
00:18:44,162 --> 00:18:46,371
Without a choice, you have them together.

509
00:18:46,372 --> 00:18:47,531
- But it's good.
-  Yes.

510
00:18:47,532 --> 00:18:48,871
- That's how this tastes.
-  Not to waste food.

511
00:18:48,872 --> 00:18:50,042
- Yes.
-  Right.

512
00:18:50,242 --> 00:18:52,211
And you accidentally poured...

513
00:18:52,212 --> 00:18:53,971
- too much sauce on the salad.
-  Yes.

514
00:18:53,972 --> 00:18:56,281
The sauce dripped down and added to the taste.

515
00:18:56,282 --> 00:18:57,981
But you also had stir-fried spicy pork,

516
00:18:57,982 --> 00:18:59,052
hence the spiciness.

517
00:18:59,652 --> 00:19:00,652
So...

518
00:19:00,653 --> 00:19:02,981
What did you put on that wedding buffet plate?

519
00:19:02,982 --> 00:19:04,521
Braised short ribs, for sure.

520
00:19:04,522 --> 00:19:05,591
Braised short ribs.

521
00:19:05,592 --> 00:19:06,751
Stir-fried spicy pork.

522
00:19:06,752 --> 00:19:08,192
The sauce...

523
00:19:09,122 --> 00:19:10,622
- from the stir-fried spicy pork.
-  Yes.

524
00:19:10,992 --> 00:19:13,631
And I think there was some kind of cake.

525
00:19:13,632 --> 00:19:15,961
- Yes, for sure.
-  Right? There was cake.

526
00:19:15,962 --> 00:19:18,231
- Like pecan pie.
-  Also,

527
00:19:18,232 --> 00:19:20,801
don't we also get fruit on the side?

528
00:19:20,802 --> 00:19:22,102
You can also taste the fruit.

529
00:19:22,672 --> 00:19:23,742
In short,

530
00:19:23,772 --> 00:19:25,611
the sauce from the stir-fried spicy pork...

531
00:19:25,612 --> 00:19:26,812
soaked...

532
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:28,941
- into the fruit.
-  Stop.

533
00:19:28,942 --> 00:19:31,241
When you put it that way, it sounds bad.

534
00:19:31,242 --> 00:19:32,752
No, it's delicious.

535
00:19:32,952 --> 00:19:34,711
It may sound weird,

536
00:19:34,712 --> 00:19:37,152
but fruit and stir-fried spicy pork together are really good.

537
00:19:38,622 --> 00:19:40,621
Either way, that buffet was a good one.

538
00:19:40,622 --> 00:19:41,822
- A famous one.
-  Yes.

539
00:19:42,262 --> 00:19:43,591
That's the main point.

540
00:19:43,592 --> 00:19:45,391
It's a delicious place.

541
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:47,532
- It's a good buffet.
-  Yes, a good buffet.

542
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:49,061
That's why, even if they're mixed,

543
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,101
it's not off-putting.

544
00:19:50,102 --> 00:19:52,072
You actually want to go back for seconds.

545
00:19:53,172 --> 00:19:55,401
The staff said the mole was also sweet.

546
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:56,542
- She did?
-  Yes.

547
00:19:56,602 --> 00:19:59,272
This looks a lot like curry.

548
00:20:00,112 --> 00:20:01,472
I'll count to three.

549
00:20:02,112 --> 00:20:03,282
One, two, three.

550
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:05,342
(This time, the three tried it together.)

551
00:20:08,782 --> 00:20:10,852
(Surprised)

552
00:20:11,182 --> 00:20:13,191
- Doesn't it taste a bit like curry?
-  Curry...

553
00:20:13,192 --> 00:20:14,452
and sweet bean sauce.

554
00:20:14,752 --> 00:20:16,791
- How do I put it?
-  It's not what I expected.

555
00:20:16,792 --> 00:20:17,861
I feel like a bit of barbecue sauce...

556
00:20:17,862 --> 00:20:18,931
- was added.
-  Exactly.

557
00:20:18,932 --> 00:20:20,062
Yes.

558
00:20:20,192 --> 00:20:22,501
- It's sweet like barbecue sauce.
-  Exactly.

559
00:20:22,502 --> 00:20:23,532
(Sweet like barbecue sauce)

560
00:20:23,902 --> 00:20:25,061
- It looks good.
-  Right?

561
00:20:25,062 --> 00:20:26,531
It's hard for it not to be good.

562
00:20:26,532 --> 00:20:28,532
This sauce will go perfectly with meat.

563
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:32,241
There are five main ingredients that go into mole.

564
00:20:32,242 --> 00:20:33,311
Curry.

565
00:20:33,312 --> 00:20:34,312
No.

566
00:20:34,313 --> 00:20:35,811
- There's no curry in here?
-  No.

567
00:20:35,812 --> 00:20:37,881
- It must be some kind of spice.
-  Yes.

568
00:20:37,882 --> 00:20:39,711
A lot of the spices used in curry...

569
00:20:39,712 --> 00:20:41,581
are also used in mole.

570
00:20:41,582 --> 00:20:45,021
Cinnamon, cumin, star anise, pepper, and more.

571
00:20:45,022 --> 00:20:46,091
Onions.

572
00:20:46,092 --> 00:20:47,691
(Wide-eyed)

573
00:20:47,692 --> 00:20:49,591
Correct. Roasted or stir-fried...

574
00:20:49,592 --> 00:20:51,461
tomatoes and onions are used.

575
00:20:51,462 --> 00:20:54,162
That must be where the sweetness comes from.

576
00:20:55,062 --> 00:20:56,862
We've got two right so far, Woo Bin.

577
00:20:56,962 --> 00:20:58,132
Out of five.

578
00:20:58,402 --> 00:21:01,072
There are three other main ingredients.

579
00:21:01,902 --> 00:21:04,071
What is it that makes...

580
00:21:04,072 --> 00:21:05,371
the sauce brown?

581
00:21:05,372 --> 00:21:06,541
That's the main ingredient.

582
00:21:06,542 --> 00:21:07,772
If you get that right...

583
00:21:07,812 --> 00:21:08,941
What food is brown in color?

584
00:21:08,942 --> 00:21:10,082
Wine.

585
00:21:10,282 --> 00:21:11,311
Incorrect.

586
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:12,482
Coffee.

587
00:21:12,682 --> 00:21:13,782
- No?
-  Incorrect.

588
00:21:14,452 --> 00:21:15,752
I'll get it right.

589
00:21:16,622 --> 00:21:18,221
It's brown but not curry?

590
00:21:18,222 --> 00:21:19,352
Incorrect.

591
00:21:19,692 --> 00:21:20,891
I really want to get it right.

592
00:21:20,892 --> 00:21:23,162
(The Incorrect Boy has become competitive.)

593
00:21:23,192 --> 00:21:25,421
It's almost impossible to get it right.

594
00:21:25,422 --> 00:21:26,732
- It's a hard question.
-  Isn't it...

595
00:21:26,962 --> 00:21:29,332
What is it that Kwang Soo eats when he's tired?

596
00:21:29,402 --> 00:21:31,032
- You said it wasn't coffee.
-  No.

597
00:21:31,102 --> 00:21:32,202
Monster.

598
00:21:32,572 --> 00:21:35,232
(Just blurting out what he eats when he's tired)

599
00:21:35,572 --> 00:21:37,871
Isn't it slightly sweet yet bitter?

600
00:21:37,872 --> 00:21:39,042
Yes.

601
00:21:40,142 --> 00:21:41,772
- Wait.
-  Slightly sweet yet bitter.

602
00:21:42,542 --> 00:21:44,842
(Did the culinary director figure it out?)

603
00:21:45,312 --> 00:21:47,252
- Gongjindan?
-  I was going to say that.

604
00:21:47,412 --> 00:21:48,782
I was about to say that.

605
00:21:48,952 --> 00:21:50,781
- But it smells like one.
-  Right?

606
00:21:50,782 --> 00:21:52,021
- It smells of herbal medicine.
-  Yes.

607
00:21:52,022 --> 00:21:53,391
I was going to bring that up.

608
00:21:53,392 --> 00:21:54,452
(It tastes like herbal medicine?)

609
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:57,522
We never use this in food,

610
00:21:57,562 --> 00:21:59,762
- Is that so?
-  but it's something we often eat.

611
00:22:00,132 --> 00:22:02,662
People often buy it at convenience stores.

612
00:22:03,332 --> 00:22:04,961
I think I can get the answer.

613
00:22:04,962 --> 00:22:06,201
What do we eat when we're tired?

614
00:22:06,202 --> 00:22:08,301
- I seriously want to get it right.
-  Something sweet and bitter.

615
00:22:08,302 --> 00:22:09,442
(Throbbing)

616
00:22:10,102 --> 00:22:11,401
We eat it when we're tired?

617
00:22:11,402 --> 00:22:12,711
- Woo Bin.
-  Herbal tonic tea?

618
00:22:12,712 --> 00:22:13,812
Chocolate.

619
00:22:14,072 --> 00:22:15,112
Correct.

620
00:22:15,682 --> 00:22:16,841
For real?

621
00:22:16,842 --> 00:22:17,981
(A self-celebration ceremony)

622
00:22:17,982 --> 00:22:19,382
Chocolate is an ingredient in this?

623
00:22:19,852 --> 00:22:25,522
The main ingredient that brings out the taste of that dish is...

624
00:22:25,822 --> 00:22:27,691
chocolate. In other words, cocoa beans.

625
00:22:27,692 --> 00:22:29,422
(Chocolate)

626
00:22:29,922 --> 00:22:31,691
- The sauce is made...
-  That's why it's dark.

627
00:22:31,692 --> 00:22:33,461
with traditional Mexican dark chocolate.

628
00:22:33,462 --> 00:22:35,391
No wonder it's slightly bitter.

629
00:22:35,392 --> 00:22:36,601
And it's sweet.

630
00:22:36,602 --> 00:22:38,032
Do we still have two ingredients left?

631
00:22:38,262 --> 00:22:40,101
But those two...

632
00:22:40,102 --> 00:22:42,302
are commonly used in Mexican dishes.

633
00:22:42,442 --> 00:22:43,841
Now that I know what's in it,

634
00:22:43,842 --> 00:22:45,502
I can taste it.

635
00:22:45,912 --> 00:22:47,341
- That was beyond my imagination.
-  Kwang Soo.

636
00:22:47,342 --> 00:22:49,742
Try it while imagining it's gongjindan.

637
00:22:50,042 --> 00:22:51,711
For real. It tastes like it.

638
00:22:51,712 --> 00:22:53,351
- Then it's completely gongjindan.
-  Yes.

639
00:22:53,352 --> 00:22:54,352
Totally.

640
00:22:54,353 --> 00:22:56,481
If you imagine it as gongjindan, it's like you just ate one.

641
00:22:56,482 --> 00:22:57,721
Try it tomorrow,

642
00:22:57,722 --> 00:22:58,952
and it'll taste even more like it.

643
00:23:01,292 --> 00:23:02,961
- Are you finished?
-  Yes, finished.

644
00:23:02,962 --> 00:23:04,662
- Thank you.
-  Thank you.

645
00:23:04,962 --> 00:23:07,692
(After a satisfying meal)

646
00:23:07,732 --> 00:23:09,802
Shall we check out the flights?

647
00:23:10,202 --> 00:23:11,261
Flight tickets.

648
00:23:11,262 --> 00:23:12,332
(Using the chance to check flight tickets)

649
00:23:12,902 --> 00:23:14,602
Cancun International Airport.

650
00:23:15,742 --> 00:23:17,971
We're leaving tomorrow, right? On the 25th.

651
00:23:17,972 --> 00:23:19,442
- Is it the 25th tomorrow?
-  Yes.

652
00:23:19,712 --> 00:23:21,611
It takes 2 hours and 40 minutes.

653
00:23:21,612 --> 00:23:22,842
(Booking flight tickets the day before)

654
00:23:23,582 --> 00:23:26,281
The flights are at 7:55am, 9:10am, 12:50pm,

655
00:23:26,282 --> 00:23:28,151
1:50pm, and 3:05pm.

656
00:23:28,152 --> 00:23:29,252
We have plenty of options.

657
00:23:29,882 --> 00:23:31,682
But the prices...

658
00:23:32,322 --> 00:23:33,491
vary a lot.

659
00:23:33,492 --> 00:23:34,722
This one's the cheapest.

660
00:23:35,422 --> 00:23:36,792
The later the flight, the cheaper it is.

661
00:23:37,062 --> 00:23:38,492
The later flights are cheaper.

662
00:23:38,892 --> 00:23:40,832
The price difference is almost 300 dollars.

663
00:23:41,062 --> 00:23:43,001
If we take the 9am flight,

664
00:23:43,002 --> 00:23:44,462
it's 500 dollars per person.

665
00:23:45,002 --> 00:23:48,872
But if we take the 3pm or 7pm flight, it's 240 dollars.

666
00:23:49,072 --> 00:23:50,842
Isn't that a bit too late?

667
00:23:51,102 --> 00:23:53,241
- Right?
-  It's best to get there early...

668
00:23:53,242 --> 00:23:54,712
to check in and everything.

669
00:23:54,812 --> 00:23:56,682
- Then...
-  He's right.

670
00:23:56,842 --> 00:23:58,742
(He has a good idea.)

671
00:23:58,842 --> 00:24:01,352
We should make a deal first and then book them right away.

672
00:24:01,412 --> 00:24:03,221
(Planning to make a deal with the production crew)

673
00:24:03,222 --> 00:24:05,482
And we got the chocolate right.

674
00:24:06,252 --> 00:24:09,692
There's quite a price difference.

675
00:24:09,992 --> 00:24:13,362
The 5pm flight is 240 dollars.

676
00:24:13,892 --> 00:24:15,492
You're taking the 5pm flight?

677
00:24:15,562 --> 00:24:18,031
If it's a 2.5-hour flight, we'll get there around 7:30pm.

678
00:24:18,032 --> 00:24:20,301
With the time difference, it'd be 8:30pm.

679
00:24:20,302 --> 00:24:23,502
Either way, this is the cheapest flight.

680
00:24:23,642 --> 00:24:26,011
If we can take an earlier one, that'd be fine.

681
00:24:26,012 --> 00:24:27,212
But it's more expensive.

682
00:24:27,512 --> 00:24:29,081
There's a price difference.

683
00:24:29,082 --> 00:24:31,782
Are we expected to cover that 100 percent,

684
00:24:32,812 --> 00:24:34,882
or will you be a bit lenient?

685
00:24:35,922 --> 00:24:37,581
We're all taking the earlier flight because...

686
00:24:37,582 --> 00:24:38,681
- it's better for everyone.
-  Exactly.

687
00:24:38,682 --> 00:24:42,292
Isn't it best to let us pay the lowest price?

688
00:24:43,222 --> 00:24:45,292
We don't mind taking the 5pm flight.

689
00:24:46,032 --> 00:24:47,791
We don't mind going at 5pm either.

690
00:24:47,792 --> 00:24:49,632
Is that so? Then let's take the 5pm flight.

691
00:24:49,962 --> 00:24:51,401
And the rental car...

692
00:24:51,402 --> 00:24:52,672
Are you trying to start a fight?

693
00:24:54,402 --> 00:24:56,041
- But a deal like this...
-  Listen.

694
00:24:56,042 --> 00:24:57,801
- It's only a few bucks.
-  You're asking...

695
00:24:57,802 --> 00:24:59,241
for the impossible.

696
00:24:59,242 --> 00:25:01,341
We brought it up because we're in a tough spot.

697
00:25:01,342 --> 00:25:02,841
Honestly, it doesn't matter to us.

698
00:25:02,842 --> 00:25:04,111
For the production crew,

699
00:25:04,112 --> 00:25:05,581
- those three...
-  It's not for the production crew.

700
00:25:05,582 --> 00:25:07,111
- are leaving earlier.
-  That's not true.

701
00:25:07,112 --> 00:25:08,452
- But that's being impossible.
-  Excuse me.

702
00:25:08,512 --> 00:25:10,082
We never said that.

703
00:25:11,652 --> 00:25:12,851
(Laughing)

704
00:25:12,852 --> 00:25:15,491
I only gave them advice that suited...

705
00:25:15,492 --> 00:25:17,892
their situation since we can't help them out.

706
00:25:18,422 --> 00:25:20,962
But we brought it up because we're in a bind.

707
00:25:21,132 --> 00:25:23,731
We've got a lot planned for Cancun,

708
00:25:23,732 --> 00:25:26,002
but everything turned out more expensive than expected.

709
00:25:27,002 --> 00:25:28,702
We even got the chocolate right.

710
00:25:28,932 --> 00:25:30,702
(Making a pitiable expression)

711
00:25:30,742 --> 00:25:32,342
Help us out a little.

712
00:25:32,872 --> 00:25:36,442
Don't talk to people like us.

713
00:25:36,742 --> 00:25:38,811
Shouldn't you discuss it with the head office CEO,

714
00:25:38,812 --> 00:25:40,852
the one who can actually make decisions?

715
00:25:41,482 --> 00:25:42,652
Well...

716
00:25:43,122 --> 00:25:45,052
You know the saying, better use it than lose it?

717
00:25:45,282 --> 00:25:47,021
We're saving...

718
00:25:47,022 --> 00:25:48,792
- our chance to use it...
-  Right.

719
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,592
- on something bigger.
-  Exactly.

720
00:25:50,822 --> 00:25:53,492
- No, but this isn't worth it.
-  Okay.

721
00:25:53,592 --> 00:25:55,232
Then let's just use our own money.

722
00:25:55,492 --> 00:25:57,461
We'll call CEO Ko after we spend our money.

723
00:25:57,462 --> 00:25:58,501
Okay.

724
00:25:58,502 --> 00:26:00,571
Since CEO Ko is a CEO,

725
00:26:00,572 --> 00:26:02,372
you have to submit a request form.

726
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:04,771
You have to explain why you need to use...

727
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:06,412
- that amount.
-  CEO Ko is too much for me.

728
00:26:08,242 --> 00:26:10,241
- Anyway...
-  Having to fill out a fixed form...

729
00:26:10,242 --> 00:26:11,242
(Already sick of it)

730
00:26:11,312 --> 00:26:13,112
You must include the word "therefore."

731
00:26:13,452 --> 00:26:15,882
- Exactly.
-  We should text him at night,

732
00:26:16,352 --> 00:26:18,322
when he's mellowed out.

733
00:26:19,022 --> 00:26:20,421
- True.
-  People usually make...

734
00:26:20,422 --> 00:26:21,852
confessions in the evening.

735
00:26:21,892 --> 00:26:23,862
(Taking advantage of his mellow evening mood)

736
00:26:23,922 --> 00:26:26,032
Let's text him after 7pm Korean time.

737
00:26:26,262 --> 00:26:27,862
Between 7pm and 11pm.

738
00:26:28,232 --> 00:26:29,432
What's the time...

739
00:26:30,062 --> 00:26:31,962
- here?
-  Almost the middle of the night.

740
00:26:33,532 --> 00:26:34,601
We'll send it around then.

741
00:26:34,602 --> 00:26:36,171
Let's book the flight tickets first.

742
00:26:36,172 --> 00:26:38,042
- Book it.
-  The one at 11:50am?

743
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:41,412
- But...
-  We'll arrive at 3:30pm.

744
00:26:41,972 --> 00:26:43,611
- You can book the flights...
-  In our room.

745
00:26:43,612 --> 00:26:44,882
- yourselves.
-  Got it.

746
00:26:45,882 --> 00:26:50,722
(GBRB: Joy Pops Laugh Pops)

747
00:26:51,922 --> 00:26:52,951
Okay.

748
00:26:52,952 --> 00:26:56,192
(The expedition team has returned to their room.)

749
00:26:56,522 --> 00:26:58,362
How long will you rest?

750
00:27:00,092 --> 00:27:01,132
Forever.

751
00:27:02,092 --> 00:27:04,202
We're going to end the day here.

752
00:27:06,402 --> 00:27:09,072
We'll book our hotel rooms and everything.

753
00:27:09,272 --> 00:27:11,741
Okay. Let us know...

754
00:27:11,742 --> 00:27:12,911
after you pay for it.

755
00:27:12,912 --> 00:27:14,771
- Give us the link to the room.
-  Please.

756
00:27:14,772 --> 00:27:16,011
- The link? Okay.
-  Yes.

757
00:27:16,012 --> 00:27:17,042
(They'll book the flight tickets and room.)

758
00:27:18,212 --> 00:27:20,312
I got five spending vouchers, Kwang Soo.

759
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:21,752
How much is it?

760
00:27:23,322 --> 00:27:24,351
Got it.

761
00:27:24,352 --> 00:27:25,522
1.1 cents.

762
00:27:26,352 --> 00:27:27,722
But we got 2.6 cents yesterday.

763
00:27:29,962 --> 00:27:31,462
Don't get our hopes up.

764
00:27:32,962 --> 00:27:34,762
At least we got 1.1 cents.

765
00:27:35,592 --> 00:27:38,562
(Woo Bin is grateful for the 1.1 cents.)

766
00:27:39,902 --> 00:27:42,842
(Snack time)

767
00:27:43,742 --> 00:27:44,902
Anyone want some protein?

768
00:27:48,742 --> 00:27:50,012
Nice packaging.

769
00:27:50,242 --> 00:27:51,582
It looks like an egg.

770
00:27:53,012 --> 00:27:54,552
There are two egg whites.

771
00:27:54,812 --> 00:27:56,052
No need to keep them in the fridge.

772
00:27:58,222 --> 00:27:59,252
It's very convenient.

773
00:28:00,422 --> 00:28:01,721
It tastes just like egg whites.

774
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:02,722
Is that so?

775
00:28:03,562 --> 00:28:05,191
I actually don't really eat egg yolks.

776
00:28:05,192 --> 00:28:06,192
Me neither.

777
00:28:06,732 --> 00:28:08,131
I can't because of the smell.

778
00:28:08,132 --> 00:28:10,161
(Protein, taken quickly and easily!)

779
00:28:10,162 --> 00:28:11,232
It's good.

780
00:28:14,572 --> 00:28:16,301
I'll book it through Agoda.

781
00:28:16,302 --> 00:28:17,601
(Booking tomorrow's flight tickets)

782
00:28:17,602 --> 00:28:19,142
I'm booking it.

783
00:28:19,642 --> 00:28:23,512
(Checking Mexico's airline website)

784
00:28:24,682 --> 00:28:26,052
Why can't I book it?

785
00:28:26,412 --> 00:28:27,552

786
00:28:27,652 --> 00:28:28,682
Yes.

787

792

- Yes?
-  It's...

the flight tickets.

794
00:28:50,442 --> 00:28:51,841
You can't book them?

795
00:28:51,842 --> 00:28:53,542
(Asking for the production crew's help)

796
00:28:54,542 --> 00:28:55,672
(Knocking)

797
00:28:56,542 --> 00:28:57,581
- Yes?
-  Yes?

798
00:28:57,582 --> 00:29:00,852
(The production crew has come to fix the problem.)

799
00:29:01,512 --> 00:29:05,481
We also looked into the flight tickets.

800
00:29:05,482 --> 00:29:08,622
Even the production crew can't go as one team.

801
00:29:08,692 --> 00:29:12,322
We have to go in groups.

802
00:29:12,562 --> 00:29:14,291
Like when we came here,

803
00:29:14,292 --> 00:29:17,002
we'll also book your flight tickets.

804
00:29:17,662 --> 00:29:21,472
There's another bit of bad news amid all this chaos.

805
00:29:21,702 --> 00:29:24,572
According to Aeromexico,

806
00:29:24,742 --> 00:29:26,212
that price...

807
00:29:27,172 --> 00:29:30,642
doesn't include checked baggage.

808
00:29:30,882 --> 00:29:32,082
In total,

809
00:29:32,682 --> 00:29:35,382
it's 1,702.50 dollars.

810
00:29:36,522 --> 00:29:39,222
(The price has gone up by 200 dollars since the restaurant.)

811
00:29:39,292 --> 00:29:40,322
Wait.

812
00:29:41,052 --> 00:29:43,792
(Hit with an unexpected additional amount)

813
00:29:46,532 --> 00:29:50,362
(The auditor checks their remaining balance.)

814
00:29:50,532 --> 00:29:52,332
At this rate, we can't go to Cancun.

815
00:29:54,702 --> 00:29:58,602
(The financial squeeze is closing in.)

816
00:29:59,372 --> 00:30:01,542
How about booking the cheapest room?

817
00:30:02,412 --> 00:30:05,742
The further we are from the beach, the cheaper the room.

818
00:30:06,852 --> 00:30:08,051
Let's see.

819
00:30:08,052 --> 00:30:09,922
(Looking into cheap rooms)

820
00:30:10,282 --> 00:30:13,592
With 3 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms, it's 200 dollars.

821
00:30:14,152 --> 00:30:16,662
But a 150-dollar house is also really nice.

822
00:30:17,662 --> 00:30:20,492
There are 3 bedrooms, 3 beds, and 2 bathrooms.

823
00:30:21,332 --> 00:30:22,701
It'll just be us using it.

824
00:30:22,702 --> 00:30:23,731
There's even a parking space.

825
00:30:23,732 --> 00:30:25,232
I've shared the link. Check it out.

826
00:30:26,672 --> 00:30:28,031
It's very neat.

828
00:30:30,142 --> 00:30:32,042
- It's really nice.
-  Right?

830
00:30:36,712 --> 00:30:38,111
How about booking one night here?

831
00:30:38,112 --> 00:30:39,242
Yes.

832
00:30:39,952 --> 00:30:43,922
(They've booked a nice-looking place.)

833
00:30:44,882 --> 00:30:46,292
We'll swim with whale sharks, right?

834
00:30:47,252 --> 00:30:49,392
I can't back down on this one.

835
00:30:50,022 --> 00:30:51,661
- Swimming with whale sharks.
-  Kwang Soo,

836
00:30:51,662 --> 00:30:52,691
can you go underwater?

837
00:30:52,692 --> 00:30:54,191
Yes. Isn't it snorkeling?

838
00:30:54,192 --> 00:30:57,362
I mean, can you scuba dive?

839
00:30:58,232 --> 00:30:59,232
Yes.

840
00:30:59,632 --> 00:31:01,232
It does sound fun.

841
00:31:01,872 --> 00:31:03,102
We get to see whale sharks,

842
00:31:03,302 --> 00:31:04,971
snorkel in clear water,

843
00:31:04,972 --> 00:31:06,212
and eat ceviche.

844
00:31:07,772 --> 00:31:09,141
Let's do it.

845
00:31:09,142 --> 00:31:12,141
If we book it, we'll be in groups of ten.

Our schedule today was tightly packed.

870

- True.
-  and hardly got any rest.

00:33:11,602 --> 00:33:13,431
- Hello.
-  Welcome to Mexico.

891
00:33:13,432 --> 00:33:14,572
Thank you.

892
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:18,371
Mexico is blazing.

893
00:33:18,372 --> 00:33:21,272
(Mexico's blazing hospitality)

894
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:24,381
(He is showing his gratitude.)

895
00:33:24,382 --> 00:33:27,382
What if we got it wrong?

896
00:33:27,512 --> 00:33:29,681
Even while I'm doing it, it feels...

897
00:33:29,682 --> 00:33:32,322
It feels somewhat...

898
00:33:33,152 --> 00:33:34,321
Is this it?

899
00:33:34,322 --> 00:33:36,092
- What?
-  It was right in front.

900
00:33:37,222 --> 00:33:40,432
(The shop is hidden between classic buildings.)

901
00:33:41,032 --> 00:33:42,561
(They arrived at a vintage shopping paradise.)

902
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,602
Even this building feels vintage.

903
00:33:45,432 --> 00:33:48,302
(They have different kinds of clothing and accessories.)

904
00:33:48,572 --> 00:33:49,701
Let's go.

905
00:33:49,702 --> 00:33:51,172
- Hello.
-  Hello.

906
00:33:51,902 --> 00:33:53,242
This is cute.

907
00:33:55,472 --> 00:33:56,712
It smells vintage.

908
00:33:58,182 --> 00:34:00,581
(He checks out the shirt that Kyung Soo picked for him.)

909
00:34:00,582 --> 00:34:01,752
It's 440 pesos.

910
00:34:04,482 --> 00:34:06,422
This place is nice.

911
00:34:06,722 --> 00:34:08,721
- It's managed well.
-  Yes.

912
00:34:08,722 --> 00:34:12,462
(They begin shopping in comfort.)

913
00:34:13,432 --> 00:34:15,191
Kwang Soo, this hand...

914
00:34:15,192 --> 00:34:16,832
I'm going to get this hand, for sure.

915
00:34:17,202 --> 00:34:18,361
- That's cute.
-  This necklace.

916
00:34:18,362 --> 00:34:20,302
- Is this that?
-  Then I can do that.

917
00:34:21,132 --> 00:34:23,341
- It is.
-  Is that what it means?

918
00:34:23,342 --> 00:34:24,841
(The director found a necklace with the hand greeting.)

919
00:34:24,842 --> 00:34:25,942
It must be it.

920
00:34:26,872 --> 00:34:29,782
Then, if that's what it means,

921
00:34:30,412 --> 00:34:32,812
then the fingers would have been facing up.

922
00:34:33,012 --> 00:34:34,481
We can leave it like this,

923
00:34:34,482 --> 00:34:35,811
- Then bring it up.
-  and go like this.

924
00:34:35,812 --> 00:34:37,022
Or like this.

925
00:34:37,222 --> 00:34:39,321
Like this. We can bring it up.

926
00:34:39,322 --> 00:34:40,822
(Or like this.)

927
00:34:40,952 --> 00:34:42,651
What is the meaning of this necklace?

928
00:34:42,652 --> 00:34:43,821
It's a Mexican uniform.

929
00:34:43,822 --> 00:34:45,491
And this whole store is...

930
00:34:45,492 --> 00:34:47,192
(They try to check the facts with the store staff.)

931
00:34:47,392 --> 00:34:50,702
One of the designers...

932
00:34:50,762 --> 00:34:54,031
works with hands.

933
00:34:54,032 --> 00:34:55,802
It doesn't mean "Thank you?"

934
00:34:56,032 --> 00:34:58,271
What does this mean?

935
00:34:58,272 --> 00:35:00,012
Do you understand?

936
00:35:00,072 --> 00:35:01,641
- In Mexico?
-  Yes.

937
00:35:01,642 --> 00:35:02,772
Thank you.

938
00:35:03,742 --> 00:35:04,912
It's right.

939
00:35:05,682 --> 00:35:07,312
- He went like this right away.
-  He did.

940
00:35:08,252 --> 00:35:09,382
Do you want to see it?

941
00:35:09,512 --> 00:35:10,982
- Hai.
-  Tell him to show you.

942
00:35:11,122 --> 00:35:12,582
- What was that?
-  What?

943
00:35:12,682 --> 00:35:14,121
- Where are you?
-  Wait a minute.

944
00:35:14,122 --> 00:35:15,992
Stay focused, Kyung Soo.

945
00:35:16,762 --> 00:35:18,362
He said it so clearly.

946
00:35:18,492 --> 00:35:19,561
"Hai."

947
00:35:19,562 --> 00:35:21,232
(Hai.)

948
00:35:21,432 --> 00:35:22,492
How much is it?

949
00:35:23,332 --> 00:35:25,261
But we can just think of it...

950
00:35:25,262 --> 00:35:27,832
as the "thank you" necklace from Mexico.

951
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:29,002
Sure.

952
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,042
We can wear it like this, and...

953
00:35:34,712 --> 00:35:35,712
(Thank you.)

954
00:35:35,713 --> 00:35:36,811
That's cute.

955
00:35:36,812 --> 00:35:37,942
That's cute.

956
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:39,882
- And we can go.
-  That's smart.

957
00:35:39,982 --> 00:35:42,381
- The necklace itself is cute.
-  Yes.

958
00:35:42,382 --> 00:35:45,022
- I love it.
-  Isn't it pretty?

959
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:46,891
- I'll take it.
-  You'll take it?

960
00:35:46,892 --> 00:35:49,022
(He decides to buy the necklace.)

961
00:35:49,252 --> 00:35:50,822
I knew you would be excited.

962
00:35:52,022 --> 00:35:53,532
How great is this?

963
00:35:54,062 --> 00:35:55,432
It's actually nice here.

964
00:35:57,132 --> 00:35:58,332
Thank you.

965
00:35:58,462 --> 00:35:59,771
Do you want to try it on?

966
00:35:59,772 --> 00:36:01,271
No. I'll take it.

967
00:36:01,272 --> 00:36:02,472
You'll take it? Okay.

968
00:36:03,072 --> 00:36:05,302
But the size of it is...

969
00:36:05,342 --> 00:36:07,442
- Does it fit well?
-  Yes, it's perfect.

970
00:36:07,912 --> 00:36:09,442
I think it's a bit tight.

971
00:36:11,982 --> 00:36:13,852
You're a model, for sure.

972
00:36:14,012 --> 00:36:17,422
(He can pull off anything.)

973
00:36:18,752 --> 00:36:20,192
Then I will take this.

974
00:36:20,292 --> 00:36:22,422
I think it's for this one.

975
00:36:24,792 --> 00:36:26,862
- Doesn't this go well with Woo Bin?
-  Does it?

976
00:36:28,632 --> 00:36:29,902
- This one is pretty, too.
-  Yes.

977
00:36:30,332 --> 00:36:32,532
That seems like it's yours.

978
00:36:33,932 --> 00:36:35,031
It's nice.

979
00:36:35,032 --> 00:36:36,202
I think it's nice.

980
00:36:37,572 --> 00:36:38,702
Is this too small for me?

981
00:36:39,142 --> 00:36:40,271
It's a bit small for you.

982
00:36:40,272 --> 00:36:41,571
It's a bit small for you.

983
00:36:41,572 --> 00:36:42,941
It's a bit small.

984
00:36:42,942 --> 00:36:43,982
(It's a bit small for you.)

985
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:47,581
- Why are you laughing?
-  It's because...

986
00:36:47,582 --> 00:36:50,281
Woo Bin wore it tight for style,

987
00:36:50,282 --> 00:36:51,382
but yours is just small.

988
00:36:52,952 --> 00:36:55,052
(It feels somewhat different.)

989
00:36:55,152 --> 00:36:56,291
Kwang Soo.

990
00:36:56,292 --> 00:36:57,462
It's small.

991
00:36:57,862 --> 00:36:59,862
Hurry up and take it off. It's too small.

992
00:37:02,062 --> 00:37:03,301
(He can't help but comment.)

993
00:37:03,302 --> 00:37:05,662
- You should get that.
-  This is the size.

994
00:37:05,802 --> 00:37:07,402
He will get it for sure if I say this.

995
00:37:07,472 --> 00:37:09,131
"That makes your shoulders look so wide."

996
00:37:09,132 --> 00:37:10,342
(That makes your shoulders look so wide.)

997
00:37:10,902 --> 00:37:12,242
"It makes your body look great."

998
00:37:14,142 --> 00:37:17,442
(He goes off to remove the shirt.)

999
00:37:18,042 --> 00:37:19,441
For this kind of fit,

1000
00:37:19,442 --> 00:37:21,681
I think this looks better at vacation spots.

1001
00:37:21,682 --> 00:37:23,521
(The director chose something.)

1002
00:37:23,522 --> 00:37:24,522
That makes your shoulders look really wide.

1003
00:37:24,523 --> 00:37:26,822
Who do you think will like this?

1004
00:37:27,022 --> 00:37:28,051
Kwang Soo.

1005
00:37:28,052 --> 00:37:29,152
For sure.

1006
00:37:29,452 --> 00:37:31,061
He has this type of style.

1007
00:37:31,062 --> 00:37:32,161
(It's a daring type of vest style.)

1008
00:37:32,162 --> 00:37:34,391
Come on, he can't really like that.

1009
00:37:34,392 --> 00:37:35,562
Try to sell it to him.

1010
00:37:35,592 --> 00:37:36,731
He really likes it.

1011
00:37:36,732 --> 00:37:38,061
If Kwang Soo buys it,

1012
00:37:38,062 --> 00:37:39,501
dinner will be on me.

1013
00:37:39,502 --> 00:37:40,772
Let's all...

1014
00:37:41,272 --> 00:37:43,142
(They start scheming the plot.)

1015
00:37:43,272 --> 00:37:44,502
He will buy it, for sure.

1016
00:37:45,372 --> 00:37:47,472
- Come on.
-  Seriously.

1017
00:37:51,212 --> 00:37:52,582
Kwang Soo.

1018
00:37:53,212 --> 00:37:55,251
Put this on...

1019
00:37:55,252 --> 00:37:56,952
- and show us.
-  Which one?

1020
00:37:57,122 --> 00:38:01,152
(He tries to trick the gullible CEO.)

1021
00:38:02,422 --> 00:38:03,822
Kwang Soo.

1022
00:38:04,392 --> 00:38:06,461
Put this on...

1023
00:38:06,462 --> 00:38:08,132
- and show us.
-  Which one?

1024
00:38:08,292 --> 00:38:12,262
(He tries to trick the gullible CEO.)

1025
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,232
Is this really for men?

1026
00:38:16,742 --> 00:38:17,842
Is it for men?

1027
00:38:18,502 --> 00:38:20,742
Your body looks great in that.

1028
00:38:20,772 --> 00:38:22,671
- It does look fashionable.
-  Right?

1029
00:38:22,672 --> 00:38:23,742
It's quite nice.

1030
00:38:24,542 --> 00:38:26,912
But the upper part...

1031
00:38:27,912 --> 00:38:29,822
looks like my mom's.

1032
00:38:30,382 --> 00:38:31,722
Is this part okay?

1033
00:38:33,022 --> 00:38:35,451
Yes. It's quite nice.

1034
00:38:35,452 --> 00:38:39,122
(The CEO became shy.)

1035
00:38:39,422 --> 00:38:40,631
You look like a model.

1036
00:38:40,632 --> 00:38:42,192
He sure is a model.

1037
00:38:42,392 --> 00:38:44,161
I forgot that he was a model.

1038
00:38:44,162 --> 00:38:45,732
- He used to be a model.
-  Right.

1039
00:38:46,832 --> 00:38:49,802
(Posing like a model)

1040
00:38:50,142 --> 00:38:51,142
Why?

1041
00:38:51,143 --> 00:38:52,642
(He used to be a model, for sure.)

1042
00:38:52,702 --> 00:38:54,472
Are you serious? Is it really nice?

1043
00:38:55,142 --> 00:38:56,272
Nice enough to buy?

1044
00:38:57,512 --> 00:38:59,112
Will it look okay if you meet me on the street?

1045
00:39:01,352 --> 00:39:02,452
I mean...

1046
00:39:02,782 --> 00:39:04,682
Let's try doing a skit.

1047
00:39:04,922 --> 00:39:06,691
Imagine that this is Cheongdam-dong.

1048
00:39:06,692 --> 00:39:08,321
- Or...
-  Come back out from there.

1049
00:39:08,322 --> 00:39:09,992
- It's a very busy street.
-  Okay.

1050
00:39:10,562 --> 00:39:12,591
- "Hey, Woo Bin." - "Kwang Soo."

1051
00:39:12,592 --> 00:39:13,731
"Hey."

1052
00:39:13,732 --> 00:39:14,962
"Are they your friends?"

1053
00:39:15,432 --> 00:39:16,662
- "Hello." - "Well..."

1054
00:39:16,902 --> 00:39:18,202
- "Hello." - "Yes."

1055
00:39:18,702 --> 00:39:20,001
"Kwang Soo."

1056
00:39:20,002 --> 00:39:21,132
"Where have you been?"

1057
00:39:21,502 --> 00:39:22,772
You're stepping away.

1058
00:39:24,502 --> 00:39:27,642
(The retreat of truth)

1059
00:39:28,342 --> 00:39:30,412
You should ask them.

1060
00:39:30,882 --> 00:39:32,242
- I'll...
-  Is that vintage?

1061
00:39:33,652 --> 00:39:34,982
Excuse me.

1062
00:39:35,352 --> 00:39:37,981
Does this look good?

1063
00:39:37,982 --> 00:39:39,681
(He asks other customers nearby.)

1064
00:39:39,682 --> 00:39:40,792
Yes.

1065
00:39:41,622 --> 00:39:43,292
What do you think of this shirt?

1066
00:39:43,562 --> 00:39:45,062
I like it.

1067
00:39:45,662 --> 00:39:46,992
- She likes it.
-  I like it.

1068
00:39:47,032 --> 00:39:48,361
I like it. Yes.

1069
00:39:48,362 --> 00:39:49,432
(She likes it?)

1070
00:39:49,532 --> 00:39:50,632
She likes it.

1071
00:39:51,702 --> 00:39:52,732
Should I buy it?

1072
00:39:53,102 --> 00:39:54,132
How much is it?

1073
00:39:54,832 --> 00:39:56,671
What about you? Do you like it?

1074
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,871
Or...

1075
00:39:57,872 --> 00:40:00,172
- I'm not sure.
-  Is it because we said it's nice?

1076
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:02,511
About 60 percent of what I own was bought...

1077
00:40:02,512 --> 00:40:04,412
because others said it was nice.

1078
00:40:05,842 --> 00:40:07,482
Because the store staff said it was nice.

1079
00:40:08,182 --> 00:40:09,681
Do you like it a bit?

1080
00:40:09,682 --> 00:40:10,751
What percent?

1081
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,881
(Does it really suit me?)

1082
00:40:12,882 --> 00:40:16,252
(He is seriously in deep thought.)

1083
00:40:16,522 --> 00:40:17,662
Kwang Soo.

1084
00:40:17,892 --> 00:40:19,222
Isn't this his length?

1085
00:40:20,162 --> 00:40:22,132
This is cute.

1086
00:40:23,832 --> 00:40:25,231
This is actually what I like.

1087
00:40:25,232 --> 00:40:26,232
(This is actually what I like.)

1088
00:40:26,402 --> 00:40:28,502
That's the best size, actually.

1089
00:40:29,502 --> 00:40:30,701
It's okay, since it's Cancun, right?

1090
00:40:30,702 --> 00:40:31,771
It suits you well.

1091
00:40:31,772 --> 00:40:32,902
- It suits you well.
-  Yes.

1092
00:40:32,942 --> 00:40:34,212
It's great for Cancun.

1093
00:40:36,012 --> 00:40:37,442
- She doesn't like it.
-  What?

1094
00:40:38,342 --> 00:40:39,512
Why?

1095
00:40:40,252 --> 00:40:41,351
No?

1096
00:40:41,352 --> 00:40:42,782
(He is confused again at her comment.)

1097
00:40:43,012 --> 00:40:44,021
What about this?

1098
00:40:44,022 --> 00:40:45,252
(What about this?)

1099
00:40:45,352 --> 00:40:48,091
(I like it.)

1100
00:40:48,092 --> 00:40:50,491
Those pants don't match the shirt.

1101
00:40:50,492 --> 00:40:51,621
But it will be nice if you change the pants.

1102
00:40:51,622 --> 00:40:53,961
She says you need to change the pants.

1103
00:40:53,962 --> 00:40:55,162
(She seriously recommends it.)

1104
00:40:55,862 --> 00:40:57,831
(Confused)

1105
00:40:57,832 --> 00:40:59,532
Is it really cool or not?

1106
00:40:59,702 --> 00:41:01,002
Do I really look cool?

1107
00:41:01,072 --> 00:41:02,172
It's nice.

1108
00:41:03,072 --> 00:41:05,742
(The scam gained unexpected momentum.)

1109
00:41:06,002 --> 00:41:08,012
How much do you think he's fallen for it?

1110
00:41:08,312 --> 00:41:09,512
Do I really look cool?

1111
00:41:09,612 --> 00:41:10,642
It's nice.

1112
00:41:11,582 --> 00:41:14,481
(Success is near.)

1113
00:41:14,482 --> 00:41:15,551
It's nice.

1114
00:41:15,552 --> 00:41:17,081
But she's saying that...

1115
00:41:17,082 --> 00:41:19,552
it will be better with different pants.

1116
00:41:20,492 --> 00:41:21,921
- I think so.
-  Yes.

1117
00:41:21,922 --> 00:41:23,221
We think so, too.

1118
00:41:23,222 --> 00:41:24,291
- Yes.
-  The pants.

1119
00:41:24,292 --> 00:41:26,792
(It's because of the pants?)

1120
00:41:27,162 --> 00:41:28,432
Then I should buy all three.

1121
00:41:29,032 --> 00:41:30,431
You're going to buy all three?

1122
00:41:30,432 --> 00:41:31,432
(He fell for it.)

1123
00:41:31,433 --> 00:41:32,802
I have to buy this one.

1124
00:41:32,962 --> 00:41:34,802
Yes, that's nice.

1125
00:41:35,672 --> 00:41:37,102
Buy it if you like it.

1126
00:41:38,002 --> 00:41:39,141
Did you pay?

1127
00:41:39,142 --> 00:41:40,211
(It's going as the director expected.)

1128
00:41:40,212 --> 00:41:41,612
Then...

1129
00:41:42,012 --> 00:41:43,942
- Woo Bin chose this one, - Yes.

1130
00:41:44,012 --> 00:41:45,312
and Kyung Soo chose the necklace.

1131
00:41:45,612 --> 00:41:47,682
How many are you getting?

1132
00:41:48,512 --> 00:41:50,522
But mine costs the least amount.

1133
00:41:51,352 --> 00:41:53,751
Then I will pay for these.

1134
00:41:53,752 --> 00:41:54,851
This one.

1135
00:41:54,852 --> 00:41:55,921
I will pay.

1136
00:41:55,922 --> 00:41:57,062
Woo Bin.

1137
00:41:57,422 --> 00:42:00,192
I was so stressed out as the treasurer.

1138
00:42:00,262 --> 00:42:02,292
I need to relieve my stress through shopping.

1139
00:42:02,362 --> 00:42:03,431
(He is relieving his auditor stress through shopping.)

1140
00:42:03,432 --> 00:42:04,662
With your own money?

1141
00:42:04,762 --> 00:42:07,501
Are you paying together or separately?

1142
00:42:07,502 --> 00:42:10,101
I'm going to pay together.

1143
00:42:10,102 --> 00:42:11,671
I won't get this. I'll just get this.

1144
00:42:11,672 --> 00:42:13,172
- Okay.
-  These three?

1145
00:42:13,472 --> 00:42:14,811
- Four.
-  Four.

1146
00:42:14,812 --> 00:42:15,972
(He decides to hold back, since the younger one is paying.)

1147
00:42:17,382 --> 00:42:19,982
(The CEO goes back to take the vest off.)

1148
00:42:21,952 --> 00:42:23,552
- Are you not going to get that?
-  No.

1149
00:42:24,282 --> 00:42:26,252
I feel like I'm going to regret it when I watch the show.

1150
00:42:27,452 --> 00:42:28,952
That’s some solid thinking.

1151
00:42:32,092 --> 00:42:33,092
Right?

1152
00:42:33,492 --> 00:42:34,992
I was confused.

1153
00:42:35,562 --> 00:42:36,732
I was really confused.

1154
00:42:37,302 --> 00:42:40,732
Even the Mexican lady was saying so.

1155
00:42:42,772 --> 00:42:45,272
I went like this in the mirror for such a long time.

1156
00:42:46,842 --> 00:42:48,272
I even did this.

1157
00:42:49,112 --> 00:42:50,742
The lady went like this,

1158
00:42:51,042 --> 00:42:52,812
but did this for the shirt that I wanted to buy.

1159
00:42:54,082 --> 00:42:55,082
The one Woo Bin liked.

1160
00:42:55,083 --> 00:42:56,382
- Thank you.
-  Thank you.

1161
00:42:57,782 --> 00:42:59,752
I pushed you too hard.

1162
00:43:01,752 --> 00:43:03,292
Were you under a lot of stress?

1163
00:43:04,262 --> 00:43:07,391
Yes. I was so stressed about the situation that I had...

1164
00:43:07,392 --> 00:43:09,092
no choice but to pressure Kwang Soo and Kyung Soo.

1165
00:43:11,432 --> 00:43:12,662
It's a good opportunity...

1166
00:43:12,902 --> 00:43:13,932
to give them gifts.

1167
00:43:14,202 --> 00:43:16,402
Do you think they know how you feel?

1168
00:43:17,542 --> 00:43:19,001
It would be nice if they did,

1169
00:43:19,002 --> 00:43:20,642
but even if not, it's fine.

1170
00:43:24,812 --> 00:43:27,752
(They arrived at the Korean restaurant for dinner.)

1171
00:43:28,182 --> 00:43:29,282
I love it.

1172
00:43:29,912 --> 00:43:31,652
- This is nice.
-  I love it.

1173
00:43:33,752 --> 00:43:36,222
Yukgaejang, kimchi jjigae,

1174
00:43:37,192 --> 00:43:38,221
and cheonggukjang.

1175
00:43:38,222 --> 00:43:40,762
(There are different kinds of Korean dishes.)

1176
00:43:41,392 --> 00:43:42,832
Ramyeon sounds good.

1177
00:43:42,992 --> 00:43:44,101
- I want ramyeon.
-  Me, too.

1178
00:43:44,102 --> 00:43:45,561
Seafood jjamppong ramyeon.

1179
00:43:45,562 --> 00:43:46,801
That sounds good.

1180
00:43:46,802 --> 00:43:48,071
(They crave ramyeon the most.)

1181
00:43:48,072 --> 00:43:49,372
They have seafood ramyeon.

1182
00:43:50,372 --> 00:43:51,702
Are you not going to have sundaeguk, then?

1183
00:43:52,842 --> 00:43:55,811
Should we do one kimchi jjigae, one sundaeguk, and one ramyeon?

1184
00:43:55,812 --> 00:43:57,242
What about stir-fried squid?

1185
00:43:57,782 --> 00:43:59,011
Stir-fried spicy pork and squid?

1186
00:43:59,012 --> 00:44:00,752
- I'm good with everything.
-  Do they have that?

1187
00:44:01,552 --> 00:44:03,582
(The waiter is talking.)

1188
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:07,852
One minute.

1189
00:44:08,422 --> 00:44:09,452
Wait a minute...

1190
00:44:10,092 --> 00:44:11,962
If he knows how to speak Korean, why did he...

1191
00:44:13,322 --> 00:44:14,531
(He means that he will take the order first.)

1192
00:44:14,532 --> 00:44:15,932
- Sundaeguk?
-  sundaeguk.

1193
00:44:16,032 --> 00:44:17,062
Okay.

1194
00:44:17,162 --> 00:44:18,202
One.

1195
00:44:18,632 --> 00:44:19,832
Kimchi jjigae.

1196
00:44:20,402 --> 00:44:21,532
- One?
-  One.

1197
00:44:22,302 --> 00:44:23,302
Ramyeon.

1198
00:44:23,602 --> 00:44:25,072
Ramyeon with dumplings?

1199
00:44:26,042 --> 00:44:27,312
Ramyeon with bulgogi?

1200
00:44:29,072 --> 00:44:30,511
- Ramyeon with seafood?
-  Ramyeon with seafood?

1201
00:44:30,512 --> 00:44:33,241
- Plain ramyeon.
-  Original ramyeon.

1202
00:44:33,242 --> 00:44:34,881
- Okay.
-  Original ramyeon.

1203
00:44:34,882 --> 00:44:35,882
Okay, good.

1204
00:44:35,912 --> 00:44:37,052
(Thank you.)

1205
00:44:39,322 --> 00:44:41,522
- Stir-fried spicy pork.
-  Stir-fried spicy pork.

1206
00:44:41,622 --> 00:44:43,392
Stir-fried squid.

1207
00:44:43,622 --> 00:44:44,892
- One.
-  Okay.

1208
00:44:45,492 --> 00:44:46,492
That's it.

1209
00:44:46,493 --> 00:44:47,562
(They finish ordering with a big appetite.)

1210
00:44:47,992 --> 00:44:50,162
We were just notified that...

1211
00:44:50,262 --> 00:44:51,531
- the whale shark tour...
-  Yes?

1212
00:44:51,532 --> 00:44:53,331
reservation that you made...

1213
00:44:53,332 --> 00:44:54,501
- What?
-  was doubled.

1214
00:44:54,502 --> 00:44:55,631
What does that mean?

1215
00:44:55,632 --> 00:44:58,972
You said you would buy ten tickets, right?

1216
00:44:59,072 --> 00:45:00,671
But 20 tickets were reserved.

1217
00:45:00,672 --> 00:45:02,541
- What?
-  So we need to check.

1218
00:45:02,542 --> 00:45:04,112
(A reservation error?)

1219
00:45:07,082 --> 00:45:08,912
- Two?
-  But why...

1220
00:45:10,112 --> 00:45:12,182
But it doesn't say 20.

1221
00:45:12,922 --> 00:45:14,492
This is ten,

1222
00:45:15,352 --> 00:45:16,651
and this is ten.

1223
00:45:16,652 --> 00:45:17,991
We bought two.

1224
00:45:17,992 --> 00:45:20,332
We bought 2 of the 10-ticket packages.

1225
00:45:20,492 --> 00:45:22,131
Then, to sum it up...

1226
00:45:22,132 --> 00:45:25,002
We actually do need two boats.

1227
00:45:25,102 --> 00:45:27,031
We were going to rent one more boat.

1228
00:45:27,032 --> 00:45:29,471
- Really?
-  We do actually need two boats.

1229
00:45:29,472 --> 00:45:30,842
Then it actually worked out well.

1230
00:45:30,872 --> 00:45:33,502
We’ll be extending great generosity to you.

1231
00:45:34,272 --> 00:45:35,471
- Wait a minute...
-  No,

1232
00:45:35,472 --> 00:45:37,181
- I can just cancel it.
-  We will get a refund.

1233
00:45:37,182 --> 00:45:39,012
If you're going to say it like that, I will cancel it.

1234
00:45:42,012 --> 00:45:43,281
(They are so thankful.)

1235
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:44,551
Should I cancel it?

1236
00:45:44,552 --> 00:45:46,881
Then we will have to pay them...

1237
00:45:46,882 --> 00:45:48,492
- for the 17 tickets.
-  Yes.

1238
00:45:48,652 --> 00:45:50,921
Then you need to get the settlement.

1239
00:45:50,922 --> 00:45:52,092
Okay.

1240
00:45:53,422 --> 00:45:55,892
- The Airbnb that we booked...
-  Yes?

1241
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:58,101
- Did they contact you?
-  just sent me a message.

1242
00:45:58,102 --> 00:45:59,562
- Did they?
-  Did it go through?

1243
00:45:59,762 --> 00:46:02,772
I asked if the booking went through,

1244
00:46:04,172 --> 00:46:06,801
and they said, "Hello, I am checking."

1245
00:46:06,802 --> 00:46:08,241
I think it was translated.

1246
00:46:08,242 --> 00:46:09,942
They must be the chill type.

1247
00:46:11,142 --> 00:46:12,282
"Thank you."

1248
00:46:12,712 --> 00:46:13,812
"See you tomorrow."

1249
00:46:15,252 --> 00:46:16,582
Could you make it sound cute?

1250
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:18,752
It's an automatic translation.

1251
00:46:19,482 --> 00:46:21,652
Maybe the translation will be cuter.

1252
00:46:22,492 --> 00:46:24,422
(The reservation for Cancun has been confirmed.)

1253
00:46:25,022 --> 00:46:27,261
There are a lot of people, so it's taking longer.

1254
00:46:27,262 --> 00:46:28,531
It will be out soon.

1255
00:46:28,532 --> 00:46:29,662
It's okay.

1256
00:46:30,432 --> 00:46:31,462
Thank you.

1257
00:46:32,062 --> 00:46:33,432
(Thank you.)

1258
00:46:33,772 --> 00:46:36,072
(They have become more polite after coming to Mexico.)

1259
00:46:36,132 --> 00:46:37,441
Isn't that...

1260
00:46:37,442 --> 00:46:38,841
Since it's taking so long,

1261
00:46:38,842 --> 00:46:41,612
should we go over the receipts here?

1262
00:46:43,072 --> 00:46:47,182
(Day 3, tour expense settlement)

1263
00:46:47,952 --> 00:46:49,282
But the tip...

1264
00:46:49,982 --> 00:46:51,022
The zip-lock bag.

1265
00:46:51,552 --> 00:46:53,252
- In case it runs away.
-  That's meticulous.

1266
00:46:56,092 --> 00:46:59,222
The first thing on our itinerary today.

1267
00:46:59,722 --> 00:47:01,932
We went for the hot-air balloon tour.

1268
00:47:02,592 --> 00:47:07,072
We gave the pilot a tip,

1269
00:47:07,232 --> 00:47:09,702
and this is the receipt.

1270
00:47:09,732 --> 00:47:11,372
After the hot-air balloon tour,

1271
00:47:11,642 --> 00:47:13,441
we went for the breakfast buffet,

1272
00:47:13,442 --> 00:47:15,912
and they had a tip per table.

1273
00:47:16,342 --> 00:47:18,482
This is the tip.

1274
00:47:18,812 --> 00:47:20,112
I wrote it down.

1275
00:47:20,882 --> 00:47:23,382
And there,

1276
00:47:23,922 --> 00:47:25,451
we paid 150 pesos...

1277
00:47:25,452 --> 00:47:28,752
for our friendship ring.

1278
00:47:28,922 --> 00:47:31,862
We had an issue yesterday,

1279
00:47:32,062 --> 00:47:33,322
so we got another one.

1280
00:47:34,392 --> 00:47:36,291
How should we handle this?

1281
00:47:36,292 --> 00:47:39,031
We used cash,

1282
00:47:39,032 --> 00:47:40,202
but we could not...

1283
00:47:40,532 --> 00:47:43,102
get the receipt.

1284
00:47:43,272 --> 00:47:44,542
This is obsidian.

1285
00:47:44,602 --> 00:47:45,642
Yes.

1286
00:47:46,302 --> 00:47:47,312
Okay.

1287
00:47:47,442 --> 00:47:48,811
He doesn't care about that.

1288
00:47:48,812 --> 00:47:50,382
(He only cares about numbers.)

1289
00:47:50,542 --> 00:47:52,912
What should we do about the receipt?

1290
00:47:53,012 --> 00:47:55,381
If you say that we won't be able to process it,

1291
00:47:55,382 --> 00:47:57,821
- Yes.
-  then I will use my own money.

1292
00:47:57,822 --> 00:47:58,882
Or...

1293
00:47:58,922 --> 00:48:01,451
You don't have to use your own money...

1294
00:48:01,452 --> 00:48:03,351
if it's within the difference range.

1295
00:48:03,352 --> 00:48:05,061
- The 400 dollar range.
-  Yes.

1296
00:48:05,062 --> 00:48:07,262
It's just included in that amount.

1297
00:48:07,532 --> 00:48:09,431
- Yes.
-  We will consider it as that.

1298
00:48:09,432 --> 00:48:11,362
- Within the range?
-  Will you put it in?

1299
00:48:12,162 --> 00:48:14,101
- Yes.
-  But it wasn't...

1300
00:48:14,102 --> 00:48:15,672
going in that direction.

1301
00:48:15,732 --> 00:48:17,871
What do you mean? The obsidian?

1302
00:48:17,872 --> 00:48:18,872
The obsidian...

1303
00:48:19,642 --> 00:48:21,112
Why do you have an attitude?

1304
00:48:22,012 --> 00:48:23,141
Why would you mention the obsidian?

1305
00:48:23,142 --> 00:48:25,641
I mean the direction of our conversation.

1306
00:48:25,642 --> 00:48:26,682
I see.

1307
00:48:27,612 --> 00:48:29,311
Are you going to add that in since we didn't get the receipt?

1308
00:48:29,312 --> 00:48:30,422
Yes.

1309
00:48:30,522 --> 00:48:33,752
Then I think I will need to put on my gear.

1310
00:48:34,722 --> 00:48:35,922
(Combat power added)

1311
00:48:37,022 --> 00:48:38,692
What are you taking out?

1312
00:48:39,662 --> 00:48:40,831
Do you have gear?

1313
00:48:40,832 --> 00:48:42,062
I need my cap...

1314
00:48:44,062 --> 00:48:45,102
Why do you need the cap?

1315
00:48:47,532 --> 00:48:49,572
He can't see your eyes with that cap on.

1316
00:48:50,002 --> 00:48:51,072
Seriously.

1317
00:48:51,642 --> 00:48:53,542
When I put my cap on,

1318
00:48:53,872 --> 00:48:58,242
I could get protected from his glare,

1319
00:48:58,782 --> 00:49:03,612
and I could hide my anxious eyes.

1320
00:49:05,052 --> 00:49:07,192
I think I will keep taking it with me.

1321
00:49:09,622 --> 00:49:12,792
If you can tell me the price...

1322
00:49:13,192 --> 00:49:14,531
for the whale shark tour,

1323
00:49:14,532 --> 00:49:15,832
we will pay you back.

1324
00:49:16,632 --> 00:49:18,061
We have money that needs to be taken back.

1325
00:49:18,062 --> 00:49:20,432
- Yes.
-  We need to settle that.

1326
00:49:20,932 --> 00:49:22,672
This is the whale shark tour.

1327
00:49:23,172 --> 00:49:24,941
Is that the amount...

1328
00:49:24,942 --> 00:49:26,202
- for all 20 tickets?
-  This isn't it.

1329
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:28,341
It was 400.

1330
00:49:28,342 --> 00:49:29,442
What is this?

1331
00:49:29,872 --> 00:49:30,941
"Yesterday?"

1332
00:49:30,942 --> 00:49:33,112
(The calculation is off?)

1333
00:49:33,712 --> 00:49:35,582
- Did we spend 200 yesterday?
-  The hot-air balloon?

1334
00:49:36,352 --> 00:49:38,182
Why is this on my own credit card?

1335
00:49:39,582 --> 00:49:40,851
I must have used my own credit card...

1336
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:42,552
for the hot-air balloon tour.

1337
00:49:43,892 --> 00:49:46,391
Is that the extra money you mentioned yesterday?

1338
00:49:46,392 --> 00:49:48,592
(About 2,000 dollars was spent on his credit card.)

1339
00:49:48,692 --> 00:49:50,701
You said, "Why is there so much?"

1340
00:49:50,702 --> 00:49:53,102
(They found out why there was so much money left.)

1341
00:49:53,402 --> 00:49:55,101
Then I'll take this out for my bank account.

1342
00:49:55,102 --> 00:49:56,171
- Okay.
-  This amount.

1343
00:49:56,172 --> 00:49:57,842
Then...

1344
00:49:58,372 --> 00:49:59,742
So that's why.

1345
00:50:00,172 --> 00:50:01,242
Then...

1346
00:50:01,912 --> 00:50:03,442
Doesn't that mean we don't have any money left?

1347
00:50:04,312 --> 00:50:06,081
That was before the whale shark tour.

1348
00:50:06,082 --> 00:50:07,252
(They are worried about the balance.)

1349
00:50:07,882 --> 00:50:11,022
This is for 20 people, and we will have to give you back...

1350
00:50:11,152 --> 00:50:12,422
the amount for 17 people.

1351
00:50:12,682 --> 00:50:16,952
That's 3,802.8048 dollars.

1352
00:50:17,192 --> 00:50:18,762
I will round that up.

1353
00:50:21,562 --> 00:50:22,932
You're rounding up...

1354
00:50:24,102 --> 00:50:25,462
the 0.02 cents?

1355
00:50:25,762 --> 00:50:27,062
What is that for?

1356
00:50:27,632 --> 00:50:30,902
That's not even money.

1357
00:50:30,972 --> 00:50:32,901
That's not even 0.1 cents, right?

1358
00:50:32,902 --> 00:50:34,812
Yes.

1359
00:50:34,872 --> 00:50:36,972
It will be 0.1 cents if we have 5 of the 0.02 cents, right?

1360
00:50:38,612 --> 00:50:40,412
And he's taking credit for that.

1361
00:50:41,752 --> 00:50:46,721
So we need to give you 3,802.805 dollars.

1362
00:50:46,722 --> 00:50:47,722
Yes.

1363
00:50:47,723 --> 00:50:50,492
The money that we need to take is...

1364
00:50:50,592 --> 00:50:52,291
2,000 dollars for the flight.

1365
00:50:52,292 --> 00:50:53,362
(The 2,000-dollar daily payment for the flight)

1366
00:50:53,562 --> 00:50:55,431
And we paid for the transportation...

1367
00:50:55,432 --> 00:50:57,091
to Cancun tomorrow,

1368
00:50:57,092 --> 00:51:01,472
so it's 1,647.90 dollars for the flight.

1369
00:51:01,572 --> 00:51:07,072
Then we need to give you 154.905 dollars.

1370
00:51:07,812 --> 00:51:09,341
Jun Wi,

1371
00:51:09,342 --> 00:51:11,981
since the limit is 2,000 dollars a day,

1372
00:51:11,982 --> 00:51:14,412
I will give you 2,000 dollars today.

1373
00:51:14,652 --> 00:51:17,111
Tomorrow's amount...

1374
00:51:17,112 --> 00:51:18,582
- Yes.
-  in advance?

1375
00:51:18,752 --> 00:51:20,652
Then how much is left?

1376
00:51:20,852 --> 00:51:23,961
- About 2,680 dollars.
-  Is that so?

1377
00:51:23,962 --> 00:51:25,592
Why are we always in debt?

1378
00:51:27,162 --> 00:51:28,291
It's almost over.

1379
00:51:28,292 --> 00:51:30,162
That's why you shouldn't be in debt.

1380
00:51:30,562 --> 00:51:32,402
Seriously.

1381
00:51:32,662 --> 00:51:34,072
I don't think we have money.

1382
00:51:34,332 --> 00:51:36,172
We didn't use that much.

1383
00:51:36,672 --> 00:51:38,672
Because Jun Wi keeps taking.

1384
00:51:41,172 --> 00:51:43,442
He's like a loan shark.

1385
00:51:45,212 --> 00:51:46,212
We have...

1386
00:51:46,213 --> 00:51:48,982
We have four nights left, right?

1387
00:51:49,252 --> 00:51:50,351
(They still have 5 more days to go.)

1388
00:51:50,352 --> 00:51:52,521
- That's 29 dollars...
-  Is this our 3rd day?

1389
00:51:52,522 --> 00:51:53,522
two times.

1390
00:51:55,092 --> 00:51:58,122
We have this much left.

1391
00:51:58,562 --> 00:52:00,792
It's 4 nights, and we have 1,900 dollars left.

1392
00:52:02,192 --> 00:52:04,062
The things we paid off are...

1393
00:52:04,232 --> 00:52:06,161
- the flight tickets, - That's it?

1394
00:52:06,162 --> 00:52:07,671
- and the Airbnb for tomorrow.
-  And our room.

1395
00:52:07,672 --> 00:52:08,732
- We have three nights left.
-  Three nights.

1396
00:52:08,832 --> 00:52:10,101
- And the rental car.
-  Right.

1397
00:52:10,102 --> 00:52:11,772
Right, the rental car.

1398
00:52:11,802 --> 00:52:12,871
That's the biggest thing.

1399
00:52:12,872 --> 00:52:14,971
The rental car costs 100 dollars per day.

1400
00:52:14,972 --> 00:52:17,072
And then there's driver's insurance.

1401
00:52:17,442 --> 00:52:19,611
- We have to cover the gas cost too.
-  The gas cost.

1402
00:52:19,612 --> 00:52:22,651
We'll be driving for about 1.5 to 2 hours.

1403
00:52:22,652 --> 00:52:24,181
The place...

1404
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:27,022
we made a reservation at today costs 150 dollars per night.

1405
00:52:27,452 --> 00:52:30,022
Let's say it's 200 dollars per night.

1406
00:52:30,052 --> 00:52:31,491
That's 600 dollars.

1407
00:52:31,492 --> 00:52:33,461
(Subtract the cost of 3 nights’ stay as well and...)

1408
00:52:33,462 --> 00:52:35,962
- That's 923 dollars.
-  That's 920 dollars.

1409
00:52:36,062 --> 00:52:38,502
So most of this would be for food.

1410
00:52:38,702 --> 00:52:39,762
Most of this money.

1411
00:52:39,832 --> 00:52:42,072
About 15 meals.

1412
00:52:42,132 --> 00:52:44,441
- Roughly.
-  But food is expensive in Cancun.

1413
00:52:44,442 --> 00:52:45,442
Right.

1414
00:52:45,842 --> 00:52:47,671
- Food and...
-  Entrance fees.

1415
00:52:47,672 --> 00:52:49,512
Entrance fees and leisure activities.

1416
00:52:49,672 --> 00:52:53,412
After the leisure activities and food,

1417
00:52:53,642 --> 00:52:56,112
we'll go broke.

1418
00:52:57,382 --> 00:52:59,151
- Food and...
-  Entrance fees.

1419
00:52:59,152 --> 00:53:01,052
Entrance fees and leisure activities.

1420
00:53:01,222 --> 00:53:04,922
After the leisure activities and food,

1421
00:53:05,162 --> 00:53:07,592
we'll go broke.

1422
00:53:08,432 --> 00:53:09,632
Really broke.

1423
00:53:09,992 --> 00:53:12,602
The rain matches this situation.

1424
00:53:13,632 --> 00:53:15,271
I suddenly lost my appetite.

1425
00:53:15,272 --> 00:53:18,102
We might just have to stay in our rooms.

1426
00:53:18,542 --> 00:53:21,472
(Poverty hit them suddenly, like a downpour.)

1427
00:53:21,742 --> 00:53:24,781
I'm so worried that we might have forgotten something.

1428
00:53:24,782 --> 00:53:25,881
- We didn't forget anything.
-  We accounted for everything.

1429
00:53:25,882 --> 00:53:27,751
What if there's more to be deducted?

1430
00:53:27,752 --> 00:53:29,181
- We got everything.
-  Jun Wi.

1431
00:53:29,182 --> 00:53:31,022
We accounted for everything, right?

1432
00:53:31,852 --> 00:53:35,521
Yes. Nothing has been left out.

1433
00:53:35,522 --> 00:53:38,791
I did make a mistake with the flight cost earlier.

1434
00:53:38,792 --> 00:53:40,321
- Gosh.
-  You can't do that.

1435
00:53:40,322 --> 00:53:41,491
It's already been paid for.

1436
00:53:41,492 --> 00:53:43,932
It's 2,738 dollars.

1437
00:53:44,032 --> 00:53:46,501
About 50 dollars more.

1438
00:53:46,502 --> 00:53:48,531
So do you owe us, or do we owe you?

1439
00:53:48,532 --> 00:53:50,032
You owe us.

1440
00:53:50,232 --> 00:53:53,102
But we already finalized the amount.

1441
00:53:53,702 --> 00:53:56,112
Why did you make the mistake?

1442
00:53:56,812 --> 00:53:57,981
I got confused.

1443
00:53:57,982 --> 00:53:59,182
I'm sorry.

1444
00:53:59,382 --> 00:54:01,111
An apology won't fix this.

1445
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:02,812
- I'm sorry.
-  You have to take accountability.

1446
00:54:03,412 --> 00:54:04,681
A simple apology...

1447
00:54:04,682 --> 00:54:05,721
- won't fix this.
-  If Woo Bin apologizes...

1448
00:54:05,722 --> 00:54:07,822
for not getting the receipt, will you...

1449
00:54:08,452 --> 00:54:10,422
We'll have to discuss this.

1450
00:54:10,692 --> 00:54:13,962
(There was a mistake.)

1451
00:54:15,292 --> 00:54:16,462
Yes.

1452
00:54:18,102 --> 00:54:19,332
That is correct.

1453
00:54:19,432 --> 00:54:20,562
Let's eat first.

1454
00:54:23,202 --> 00:54:25,301
It's been so long since I saw these.

1455
00:54:25,302 --> 00:54:26,302
Right.

1456
00:54:31,012 --> 00:54:33,542
Why did you all suddenly lose your appetite?

1457
00:54:37,212 --> 00:54:38,481
(Sighing)

1458
00:54:38,482 --> 00:54:40,852
There's Korean food in front of you. Why aren't you eating?

1459
00:54:42,692 --> 00:54:45,892
Should we each order another beer?

1460
00:54:46,662 --> 00:54:48,692
This is the first time I'm seeing you drink beer.

1461
00:54:51,032 --> 00:54:53,062
- Thank you for the food.
-  Thank you for the food.

1462
00:54:55,172 --> 00:54:57,902
(They start eating the ramyeon, which was served first.)

1463
00:55:01,572 --> 00:55:03,912
- It's been so long.
-  Right.

1464
00:55:04,142 --> 00:55:05,582
It tastes like Neoguri.

1465
00:55:09,452 --> 00:55:11,721
It tastes like Neoguri, but the noodles aren't from the packet.

1466
00:55:11,722 --> 00:55:12,852
(Enjoying the ramyeon)

1467
00:55:14,022 --> 00:55:15,252
It's good.

1468
00:55:17,122 --> 00:55:18,461
- It's not spicy.
-  It's not spicy...

1469
00:55:18,462 --> 00:55:19,822
and it's not too salty. It's nice.

1470
00:55:20,022 --> 00:55:22,191
So foreigners can enjoy it.

1471
00:55:22,192 --> 00:55:23,362
I think you're right.

1472
00:55:28,032 --> 00:55:30,372
Ramyeon is good no matter when you eat it.

1473
00:55:31,442 --> 00:55:33,501
- This is...
-  Ramyeon?

1474
00:55:33,502 --> 00:55:34,642
- Neoguri?
-  Neoguri?

1475
00:55:35,512 --> 00:55:36,812
It's one neoguri?

1476
00:55:37,642 --> 00:55:38,642
Yes.

1477
00:55:38,782 --> 00:55:39,942
- Yes?
-  Yes.

1478
00:55:40,952 --> 00:55:42,182
The brand of ramyeon.

1479
00:55:42,982 --> 00:55:44,011
(I see!)

1480
00:55:44,012 --> 00:55:45,582
Your sundaeguk will be out soon.

1481
00:55:45,882 --> 00:55:48,652
Your sundaeguk. Yes.

1482
00:55:48,792 --> 00:55:51,822
(Thank you.)

1483
00:56:03,202 --> 00:56:05,672
(The weight of the expedition can be felt in that sip.)

1484
00:56:05,902 --> 00:56:08,212
You three rarely drink beer.

1485
00:56:09,312 --> 00:56:11,842
This is the first time I'm seeing all three of you drink together.

1486
00:56:13,542 --> 00:56:14,682
What do you think...

1487
00:56:15,182 --> 00:56:16,712
about getting some food to-go?

1488
00:56:17,112 --> 00:56:19,122
For tomorrow's meal.

1489
00:56:20,382 --> 00:56:21,852
Right. Sundaeguk is something...

1490
00:56:22,222 --> 00:56:23,592
we can keep in the freezer.

1491
00:56:23,652 --> 00:56:26,261
We have a microwave too.

1492
00:56:26,262 --> 00:56:27,262
Right.

1493
00:56:27,263 --> 00:56:30,862
(Food expenses are the first to be cut.)

1494
00:56:31,332 --> 00:56:33,101
- Stir-fried squid?
-  Yes.

1495
00:56:33,102 --> 00:56:34,701
(Their next dish is served.)

1496
00:56:34,702 --> 00:56:35,771
- That looks good.
-  That looks good.

1497
00:56:35,772 --> 00:56:36,832
That looks good.

1498
00:56:38,372 --> 00:56:39,502
What's this?

1499
00:56:43,242 --> 00:56:44,512
It's really good.

1500
00:56:44,542 --> 00:56:45,642
You like it?

1501
00:56:46,042 --> 00:56:47,442
The seafood is of good quality.

1502
00:56:47,682 --> 00:56:49,382
I can tell the squid itself is good.

1503
00:56:50,812 --> 00:56:53,452
The spicy flavor is different from Korean spiciness.

1504
00:56:54,322 --> 00:56:55,592
Maybe they used a different chili powder.

1505
00:56:55,622 --> 00:56:56,652
Maybe.

1506
00:56:57,222 --> 00:56:58,792
- Right? Isn't it good?
-  It is.

1507
00:56:59,922 --> 00:57:01,732
- It's the squid firm and juicy?
-  Yes.

1508
00:57:08,172 --> 00:57:09,701
- Gosh, it's really good.
-  It is.

1509
00:57:09,702 --> 00:57:10,772
It's really good.

1510
00:57:11,172 --> 00:57:12,772
- Stir-fried squid?
-  You must try it.

1511
00:57:14,172 --> 00:57:17,242
(A bite of stir-fried pork)

1512
00:57:18,712 --> 00:57:19,982
It has glass noodles in it.

1513
00:57:20,242 --> 00:57:21,781
It kind of tastes like stir-fried pork tripe.

1514
00:57:21,782 --> 00:57:22,952
It does.

1515
00:57:23,452 --> 00:57:24,622
It's so good.

1516
00:57:27,422 --> 00:57:28,522
- Sundaeguk?
-  Yes.

1517
00:57:29,052 --> 00:57:30,192
Thank you.

1518
00:57:30,252 --> 00:57:31,422
Over here.

1519
00:57:31,762 --> 00:57:33,092
Put it down here.

1520
00:57:35,332 --> 00:57:36,562
Thank you.

1521
00:57:38,002 --> 00:57:39,302
Let's taste it on the count of three.

1522
00:57:43,202 --> 00:57:44,232
One, two, three.

1523
00:57:45,102 --> 00:57:46,342
One, two, three.

1524
00:57:46,542 --> 00:57:49,272
(They try the Mexican sundaeguk at the same time.)

1525
00:57:49,612 --> 00:57:51,112
(In awe)

1526
00:57:51,282 --> 00:57:52,842
- That's a rich flavor.
-  It's good.

1527
00:57:54,282 --> 00:57:55,482
It's good.

1528
00:57:56,052 --> 00:57:57,211
Gosh.

1529
00:57:57,212 --> 00:58:00,622
I think the chef is really good.

1530
00:58:02,292 --> 00:58:03,592
It's really good.

1531
00:58:04,492 --> 00:58:05,592
Something tells me...

1532
00:58:06,462 --> 00:58:08,362
that even this chili pepper would taste good.

1533
00:58:09,592 --> 00:58:11,662
They could successfully sell these in Korea.

1534
00:58:12,202 --> 00:58:13,332
Definitely.

1535
00:58:15,772 --> 00:58:17,271
The chili pepper is really good.

1536
00:58:17,272 --> 00:58:18,442
- Right?
-  Yes.

1537
00:58:18,502 --> 00:58:20,372
The lettuce is good too.

1538
00:58:23,842 --> 00:58:25,012
Korean food...

1539
00:58:27,142 --> 00:58:28,982
tastes so good, especially after...

1540
00:58:31,152 --> 00:58:32,282
not having it for a while.

1541
00:58:34,422 --> 00:58:36,792
We'll have to pack as soon as we get back.

1542
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:39,021
Right.

1543
00:58:39,022 --> 00:58:41,032
(The taste of home made them forget reality for a moment.)

1544
00:58:41,932 --> 00:58:44,192
It feels like we always have something to do.

1545
00:58:46,462 --> 00:58:50,872
(GBRB: Joy Pops Laugh Pops)

1546
00:58:53,472 --> 00:58:58,942
(This is their last night in Mexico City.)

1547
00:59:00,682 --> 00:59:03,482
(They have to pack their bags now.)

1548
00:59:04,982 --> 00:59:07,722
(Kwang Soo stops packing for a moment to look in the mirror.)

1549
00:59:09,852 --> 00:59:11,822
Don't forget to pack the jaguar whistle.

1550
00:59:13,122 --> 00:59:15,032
Blow it for us.

1551
00:59:15,532 --> 00:59:18,002
Softly, like before.

1552
00:59:21,502 --> 00:59:24,132
(A sound as weak as the expedition team's reality)

1553
00:59:25,442 --> 00:59:27,872
(He tries one more time.)

1554
00:59:28,742 --> 00:59:32,941
(The jaguar whistle is quite weak.)

1555
00:59:32,942 --> 00:59:34,652
How is this the sound of a jaguar?

1556
00:59:36,112 --> 00:59:37,952
(He blows the whistle again.)

1557
00:59:38,722 --> 00:59:43,992
(At least it made Woo Bin laugh for a second.)

1558
00:59:45,462 --> 00:59:49,432
(Looking around)

1559
00:59:50,132 --> 00:59:51,701
- I don't know where to begin.
-  Right?

1560
00:59:51,702 --> 00:59:53,702
Gosh, I don’t even know where to start.

(Different types of people when packing)

1562
00:59:59,772 --> 01:00:04,482
(Type 1. Someone who lays everything out)

1563
01:00:11,882 --> 01:00:15,491
(They usually try things on instead of packing.)

1564
01:00:15,492 --> 01:00:19,122
(They usually try things on instead of packing.)

1565
01:00:19,392 --> 01:00:21,862
(And then,)

1566
01:00:22,732 --> 01:00:25,101
(they end up lying down.)

1567
01:00:25,102 --> 01:00:27,972
(It takes them forever to pack.)

1568
01:00:29,472 --> 01:00:33,472
(Type 2. Someone who didn't bring a lot of things)

1569
01:00:33,872 --> 01:00:37,242
(They keep their things organized from the start.)

1570
01:00:40,782 --> 01:00:45,852
(They also have precise folding and organizing skills.)

1571
01:00:53,522 --> 01:00:58,462
(This one starts by steam ironing his clothes.)

1572

(Type 3. The polite maximalist)

1573
01:01:04,772 --> 01:01:06,671
I for sure had room in my bag.

1574
01:01:06,672 --> 01:01:07,971

(Politeness essentials)

1576

How did I pack my things? I can't fit everything in here.

1577
01:01:16,152 --> 01:01:17,182
This is driving me insane.

1578
01:01:18,852 --> 01:01:22,622
(There are still a ton of things he hasn’t packed in his suitcase.)

1579
01:01:24,252 --> 01:01:25,892
(Gosh)

1580
01:01:26,992 --> 01:01:31,362
(He narrowly prevented a disaster.)

(He gazes at the unpacked items, deep in thought.)

1583
01:01:40,542 --> 01:01:43,042
(Then he carries his things somewhere.)

(Woo Bin enters Kyung Soo's room.)

1585
01:01:46,542 --> 01:01:48,551
I'll put these in Kyung Soo's bag.

1587

Won't he mind?

1588
01:01:52,082 --> 01:01:54,482
He already has my leather jacket too.

- Kwang Soo.
-  Yes?

1591
01:02:04,232 --> 01:02:05,232
Go wash up.

(He is asleep 20 minutes later. Kyung Soo comes over,)

1597
01:02:36,992 --> 01:02:41,802
(takes the mask off his face, and holds out the lotion on his hand.)

1598
01:02:46,242 --> 01:02:51,682
(It comes naturally to them, as if this isn't the first time.)

1599
01:02:52,912 --> 01:02:56,152
(Kyung Soo rubs the lotion on his hand onto Kwang Soo’s face.)

1600
01:02:57,512 --> 01:02:59,352
- Goodnight.
-  Goodnight.

1601
01:03:01,452 --> 01:03:05,262
(Kyung Soo is the secret to Kwang Soo's nice skin.)

1602
01:03:06,262 --> 01:03:09,691
(After finishing his tasks,)

1603
01:03:09,692 --> 01:03:13,102
(Kyung Soo returns to his room and goes to sleep.)

1604
01:03:14,802 --> 01:03:19,702
(Current time: 4am)

1605
01:03:20,972 --> 01:03:22,511
(Tossing and turning)

1606
01:03:22,512 --> 01:03:25,942
(Kwang Soo and Woo Bin woke up early because of jet lag.)

1607
01:03:27,942 --> 01:03:29,352
(What is meditation?)

1608
01:03:29,412 --> 01:03:31,352
- What?
-  What is meditation?

1609
01:03:31,552 --> 01:03:34,022
Do you just not think about anything? Or...

1610
01:03:34,122 --> 01:03:35,792
I don't think about anything.

1611
01:03:36,552 --> 01:03:38,722
You know how you keep having thoughts.

1612
01:03:39,492 --> 01:03:42,162
So you practice stopping your thoughts.

1613
01:03:44,232 --> 01:03:45,762
Meditating is really good...

1614
01:03:46,332 --> 01:03:49,432
because you gain...

1615
01:03:50,572 --> 01:03:52,272
a stronger sense of self-awareness.

1616
01:03:53,502 --> 01:03:56,512
Sensing yourself quickly helps with acting too.

1617
01:03:56,672 --> 01:03:58,342
The emotions.

1618
01:03:59,142 --> 01:04:01,412
Being aware of them and expressing them.

1619
01:04:02,082 --> 01:04:03,882
I think meditating helps with that.

1620
01:04:04,182 --> 01:04:05,421
It helps with your daily life too.

1621
01:04:05,422 --> 01:04:08,852
(The older brothers are deep in conversation.)

1622
01:04:10,292 --> 01:04:12,892
(Meanwhile, Kyung Soo already has his light on.)

1623
01:04:13,922 --> 01:04:17,992
(He also couldn't get over his jet lag.)

1624
01:04:18,502 --> 01:04:24,872
(He's looking things up on his phone in different positions.)

1625
01:04:27,702 --> 01:04:31,612
(The sun comes up on their last morning in Mexico City.)

1626
01:04:31,782 --> 01:04:33,381
- Hello.
-  Hello.

1627
01:04:33,382 --> 01:04:34,582
Did you get some good sleep?

1628
01:04:34,752 --> 01:04:36,311
- This is nice.
-  Are you ready?

1629
01:04:36,312 --> 01:04:37,352
We should.

1630
01:04:38,482 --> 01:04:39,922
He found restaurants to go to in Cancun.

1631
01:04:41,182 --> 01:04:42,892
I spent three hours looking up restaurants.

1632
01:04:43,352 --> 01:04:46,062
There are so many good restaurants in Cancun.

1633
01:04:48,832 --> 01:04:51,462
I found a restaurant...

1634
01:04:51,802 --> 01:04:53,262
that's unknown to Korean tourists.

1635
01:04:54,032 --> 01:04:56,971
Only the locals know...

1636
01:04:56,972 --> 01:04:58,172
about this ceviche place.

1637
01:04:59,272 --> 01:05:01,512
Can't we go to restaurants that are tourist-approved?

1638
01:05:02,572 --> 01:05:04,211
Not ones that only locals like.

1639
01:05:04,212 --> 01:05:06,111
We did this last time. We might not like the food.

1640
01:05:06,112 --> 01:05:07,982
That's why I came up with this idea.

1641
01:05:08,042 --> 01:05:10,381
I don't think we can trust you anymore.

1642
01:05:10,382 --> 01:05:12,581
- We're not Mexican, Kyung Soo.
-  That's right.

1643
01:05:12,582 --> 01:05:15,322
- We're Korean.
-  Take our preferences into account.

1644
01:05:15,422 --> 01:05:16,692
Listen.

1645
01:05:16,792 --> 01:05:19,092
The ceviche place is a minute away.

1646
01:05:19,262 --> 01:05:20,762
We'll order the ceviche,

1647
01:05:21,022 --> 01:05:22,292
and I'll taste it first.

1648
01:05:22,962 --> 01:05:24,231
You'll taste-test it?

1649
01:05:24,232 --> 01:05:26,231
Yes, I'll taste-test it. If it's not good,

1650
01:05:26,232 --> 01:05:28,102
we'll go to a burger place that is a minute away.

1651
01:05:28,932 --> 01:05:29,971
- So you'll order just one?
-  Yes.

1652
01:05:29,972 --> 01:05:31,701
- He'll order one first.
-  Yes, one ceviche.

1653
01:05:31,702 --> 01:05:33,372
- That's such an inconvenience.
-  What?

1654
01:05:33,672 --> 01:05:36,312
Okay, then. I'll leave five minutes early...

1655
01:05:36,642 --> 01:05:38,012
and go to the ceviche place.

1656
01:05:38,212 --> 01:05:40,341
They have 1,422 reviews...

1657
01:05:40,342 --> 01:05:41,582
with a rating of 4.8 stars.

1658
01:05:41,712 --> 01:05:42,781
This place is good for sure.

1659
01:05:42,782 --> 01:05:44,552
The place we went to on the first day had 4.5 stars too.

1660
01:05:44,822 --> 01:05:46,581
(The auditor isn't letting him get away easily.)

1661
01:05:46,582 --> 01:05:49,221
- For Mexican locals, that...
-  We're getting mad.

1662
01:05:49,222 --> 01:05:50,552
We're going to start getting mad at you.

1663
01:05:50,922 --> 01:05:52,762
I'll leave five minutes early...

1664
01:05:52,892 --> 01:05:53,961
and try this.

1665
01:05:53,962 --> 01:05:55,861
- It has 4.8 stars.
-  I saw the pictures,

1666
01:05:55,862 --> 01:05:57,261
and the food looked so fresh.

1667
01:05:57,262 --> 01:05:58,361
What is this?

1668
01:05:58,362 --> 01:05:59,901
- Shrimp.
-  It's shrimp ceviche.

1669
01:05:59,902 --> 01:06:01,732
Gosh. The seafood here is...

1670
01:06:02,202 --> 01:06:03,501
They're definitely great quality.

1671
01:06:03,502 --> 01:06:05,571
Because it's by the sea.

1672
01:06:05,572 --> 01:06:06,702
They have that.

1673
01:06:08,002 --> 01:06:09,612
- All right. Let's go.
-  Let's go.

1674
01:06:12,642 --> 01:06:13,812
- Do you have everything?
-  Yes.

1675
01:06:14,112 --> 01:06:15,211
We have everything.

1676
01:06:15,212 --> 01:06:18,982
(The restaurant briefing is over. It's time to head to the airport.)

1677
01:06:19,282 --> 01:06:21,021
- Hello.
-  Hello.

1678
01:06:21,022 --> 01:06:22,751
- Hello.
-  Hello.

1679
01:06:22,752 --> 01:06:23,991
- Bye.
-  Come again.

1680
01:06:23,992 --> 01:06:25,421
- Yes, thank you.
-  Hello.

1681
01:06:25,422 --> 01:06:26,992
(They check out of the hotel they've stayed in for 4 days.)

1682
01:06:28,092 --> 01:06:29,392
- This is it. It's here.
-  Is this it?

1683
01:06:30,092 --> 01:06:31,601
(Their taxi has arrived.)

1684
01:06:31,602 --> 01:06:33,702
- It's a big car. I'm relieved.
-  I'm sad to leave.

1685
01:06:34,532 --> 01:06:35,772
- Thank you.
-  We'll get on the road, then.

1686
01:06:36,272 --> 01:06:38,032
To Cancun? We'll see you at the airport.

1687
01:06:38,572 --> 01:06:39,902
- I thought he meant Cancun.
-  Safe travels.

1688
01:06:41,172 --> 01:06:42,212
Goodbye.

1689
01:06:43,772 --> 01:06:45,511
- I'm sad to leave.
-  Me too.

1690
01:06:45,512 --> 01:06:46,582
(They head to the airport.)

1691
01:06:47,012 --> 01:06:49,212
I looked up restaurants...

1692
01:06:49,282 --> 01:06:51,352
that are near our hotel.

1693
01:06:51,982 --> 01:06:53,482
I found a few places we could go to.

1694
01:06:54,452 --> 01:06:58,822
(The director briefs them on Cancun restaurants during the ride.)

1695
01:06:59,322 --> 01:07:01,021
- Japanese ramen?
-  Yes, ramen.

1696
01:07:01,022 --> 01:07:02,191
- Gosh, we should go.
-  That sounds good.

1697
01:07:02,192 --> 01:07:03,631
- It has good reviews.
-  I'm curious.

1698
01:07:03,632 --> 01:07:05,362
- That's an option.
-  Let me see the pictures.

1699
01:07:05,602 --> 01:07:07,101
Since it's by the sea,

1700
01:07:07,102 --> 01:07:08,971
- there are lots of seafood places.
-  Right.

1701
01:07:08,972 --> 01:07:10,572
This one's famous for guacamole.

1702
01:07:10,702 --> 01:07:12,642
- We should eat guacamole.
-  We haven't had it so far.

1703
01:07:12,802 --> 01:07:14,911
- I love guacamole.
-  But Kwang Soo, we're...

1704
01:07:14,912 --> 01:07:17,672
We can eat two meals out today.

1705
01:07:17,972 --> 01:07:19,041
Why?

1706
01:07:19,042 --> 01:07:20,812
- We'll have a meal when we land...
-  I see.

1707
01:07:21,042 --> 01:07:22,612
and another one before we go to bed.

1708
01:07:24,182 --> 01:07:25,782
I really want to eat ramen.

1709
01:07:26,682 --> 01:07:28,251
This is a chicken place.

1710
01:07:28,252 --> 01:07:30,691
Their chicken is like the grilled chicken...

1711
01:07:30,692 --> 01:07:32,892
- that's sold at Korean markets.
-  Those are good.

1712
01:07:32,992 --> 01:07:34,792
And these two places...

1713
01:07:35,032 --> 01:07:36,462
are for me to go by myself.

1714
01:07:36,862 --> 01:07:38,032
I'm going to go, even if you try to talk me out of it.

1715
01:07:38,232 --> 01:07:39,262
They're taco places.

1716
01:07:39,432 --> 01:07:40,761
- Stop.
-  What's wrong with you?

1717
01:07:40,762 --> 01:07:42,102
Apparently, their tacos are really good.

1718
01:07:42,802 --> 01:07:44,471
These are different tacos.

1719
01:07:44,472 --> 01:07:45,872
Seriously, though. What's wrong with you?

1720
01:07:46,072 --> 01:07:47,102
I mean...

1721
01:07:47,242 --> 01:07:48,312
You...

1722
01:07:48,842 --> 01:07:50,641
You know what I've been through.

1723
01:07:50,642 --> 01:07:52,211
You should get some treatment.

1724
01:07:52,212 --> 01:07:53,312
No, that's not it.

1725
01:07:53,612 --> 01:07:55,012
I've been fooled a lot here.

1726
01:07:55,352 --> 01:07:57,312
(Putting on sunglasses)

1727
01:07:57,412 --> 01:07:59,722
Take those off.

1728
01:08:00,552 --> 01:08:02,152
I've received a lot of treatment.

1729
01:08:02,822 --> 01:08:05,122
- Wait, no.
-  Treatment?

1730
01:08:05,222 --> 01:08:06,961
You do need treatment.

1731
01:08:06,962 --> 01:08:08,892
I've been fooled a lot by the ratings here.

1732
01:08:09,162 --> 01:08:10,362
I'm so frustrated...

1733
01:08:10,932 --> 01:08:12,632
that the...

1734
01:08:12,802 --> 01:08:15,871
standards I use to choose restaurants...

1735
01:08:15,872 --> 01:08:16,902
are really high right now.

1736
01:08:18,472 --> 01:08:20,972
Just trust me one last time. Please?

1737
01:08:21,972 --> 01:08:23,272
Let's think about it later.

1738
01:08:23,712 --> 01:08:25,741
- We don't have to decide now.
-  There are so many options.

1739
01:08:25,742 --> 01:08:27,581
- Right.
-  The chicken place...

1740
01:08:27,582 --> 01:08:29,182
happens to be right next to the taco place.

1741
01:08:29,482 --> 01:08:31,681
So while you're eating the chicken,

1742
01:08:31,682 --> 01:08:33,351
I'll go get a taco for myself.

1743
01:08:33,352 --> 01:08:35,321
Then what's the point of traveling together?

1744
01:08:35,322 --> 01:08:37,122
I'm eating the chicken too.

1745
01:08:37,322 --> 01:08:39,222
It's less than five minutes away.

1746
01:08:39,492 --> 01:08:42,031
The taco place is only a few steps away.

1747
01:08:42,032 --> 01:08:43,631
So I'll go get a taco from there...

1748
01:08:43,632 --> 01:08:45,602
- Okay, then...
-  and eat it on my way back.

1749
01:08:45,862 --> 01:08:48,102
It's only morning, and you're being annoying.

1750
01:08:48,232 --> 01:08:51,642
(The auditor isn't someone to mess with.)

1751
01:08:52,242 --> 01:08:55,111
We can do this.

1752
01:08:55,112 --> 01:08:56,112
If we...

1753
01:08:57,542 --> 01:08:58,712
Wait, I'm not sure if this would be possible.

1754
01:08:59,082 --> 01:09:01,311
Seeing the whale sharks and having dinner there too...

1755
01:09:01,312 --> 01:09:03,012
before we come back. Is that doable?

1756
01:09:03,712 --> 01:09:06,051
There's no other choice. That's what happens on trips.

1757
01:09:06,052 --> 01:09:07,382
We're seeing the whale sharks tomorrow.

1758
01:09:07,952 --> 01:09:09,491
We have to check out before we leave anyway.

1759
01:09:09,492 --> 01:09:10,552
I'm talking about after the whales.

1760
01:09:11,052 --> 01:09:12,362
After the whale sharks, we're...

1761
01:09:12,592 --> 01:09:13,621
I see.

1762
01:09:13,622 --> 01:09:15,131
- After seeing the whale sharks, - Because we're...

1763
01:09:15,132 --> 01:09:16,562
- checking in late?
-  we can eat in Cancun.

1764
01:09:16,792 --> 01:09:18,701
What about riding the boat with the parachute?

1765
01:09:18,702 --> 01:09:20,732
(What about parasailing?)

1766
01:09:20,902 --> 01:09:22,272
Let's not do that.

1767
01:09:22,472 --> 01:09:23,472
What?

1768
01:09:23,772 --> 01:09:24,772
Are you insane?

1769
01:09:25,872 --> 01:09:26,902
What are you talking about?

1770
01:09:27,342 --> 01:09:28,672
- I mean...
-  What are you talking about?

1771
01:09:29,472 --> 01:09:30,511
Why can't we...

1772
01:09:30,512 --> 01:09:32,541
Tomorrow is whale shark day.

1773
01:09:32,542 --> 01:09:33,642
The whale shark day.

1774
01:09:33,782 --> 01:09:35,881
Are you saying we should see the whale sharks...

1775
01:09:35,882 --> 01:09:37,652
- and go straight to do parasailing?
-  That's right.

1776
01:09:37,952 --> 01:09:40,022
How will we do both in one day?

1777
01:09:43,092 --> 01:09:44,291
- Right?
-  The whale sharks...

1778
01:09:44,292 --> 01:09:45,622
You can do it.

1779
01:09:47,122 --> 01:09:49,092
- The whale sharks are...
-  Or we can do this.

1780
01:09:49,262 --> 01:09:51,562
Seeing the flamingos and...

1781
01:09:52,062 --> 01:09:54,161
We have to drive 3.5 hours for that.

1782
01:09:54,162 --> 01:09:55,272
I'll drive.

1783
01:09:55,772 --> 01:09:58,601
Don't go back on your words.

1784
01:09:58,602 --> 01:10:00,171
I won't. I'll drive.

1785
01:10:00,172 --> 01:10:01,601
- But we have to see the flamingos.
-  All of them?

1786
01:10:01,602 --> 01:10:03,641
And you have to let me go everywhere...

1787
01:10:03,642 --> 01:10:05,041
- I want to go.
-  Never mind, then.

1788
01:10:05,042 --> 01:10:06,611
But the two of you can...

1789
01:10:06,612 --> 01:10:08,652
just hang out in the backseat...

1790
01:10:09,012 --> 01:10:10,182
and take a nap too.

1791
01:10:10,552 --> 01:10:12,181
It's one of the very few pink salt lakes in the world.

1792
01:10:12,182 --> 01:10:13,481
"You're not even allowed to touch the water."

1793
01:10:13,482 --> 01:10:15,721
"The experience was underwhelming. I was a bit disappointed."

1794
01:10:15,722 --> 01:10:17,052
What does he know?

1795
01:10:19,062 --> 01:10:21,292
I don't care about filming. I have to go there.

1796
01:10:22,892 --> 01:10:25,962
(The CEO has a ton of things he wants to do.)

1797
01:10:26,132 --> 01:10:27,132
We're here.

1798
01:10:28,732 --> 01:10:30,771
(After talking about all sorts of things,)

1799
01:10:30,772 --> 01:10:32,802
(they arrived at the airport.)

1800
01:10:32,972 --> 01:10:35,001
- Thank you.
-  Thank you.

1801
01:10:35,002 --> 01:10:37,812
(Benito Juarez International Airport)

1802
01:10:39,042 --> 01:10:40,282
I want coffee.

1803
01:10:40,412 --> 01:10:41,481
Me too.

1804
01:10:41,482 --> 01:10:43,452
- Let's get coffee after we eat.
-  Okay.

1805
01:10:44,282 --> 01:10:46,022
There it is. "Aeromexico."

1806
01:10:48,082 --> 01:10:51,152
(The director goes straight to self check-in.)

1807
01:10:54,592 --> 01:10:57,862
(He goes through self check-in with ease.)

1808
01:10:58,532 --> 01:11:02,772
(He prints out the baggage tag...)

1809
01:11:02,832 --> 01:11:05,902
(and sticks it on his suitcase.)

1810
01:11:06,202 --> 01:11:07,202
All done.

1811
01:11:07,203 --> 01:11:09,612
(Checking in so easily)

1812
01:11:09,942 --> 01:11:11,612
- You can self-check in.
-  Are you done?

1813
01:11:12,312 --> 01:11:14,912
It's my first time. It's my first time printing this.

1814
01:11:15,212 --> 01:11:16,281
It's convenient.

1815
01:11:16,282 --> 01:11:17,312
(Director Doh is quick-witted.)

1816
01:11:17,652 --> 01:11:18,721
I can't do it.

1817
01:11:18,722 --> 01:11:19,851
Did you do it?

1818
01:11:19,852 --> 01:11:20,951
It doesn't exceed the weight limit.

1819
01:11:20,952 --> 01:11:22,991
(Nodding)

1820
01:11:22,992 --> 01:11:24,392
Is this working?

1821
01:11:25,722 --> 01:11:26,922
I can put it down, right?

1822
01:11:27,062 --> 01:11:28,121
You have to put it up.

1823
01:11:28,122 --> 01:11:29,232
- But it already went through.
-  Kwang Soo.

1824
01:11:29,662 --> 01:11:30,761
Put it up here.

1825
01:11:30,762 --> 01:11:33,161
(Director Doh comes forward in the end.)

1826
01:11:33,162 --> 01:11:35,772
(Obedient)

1827
01:11:40,502 --> 01:11:44,911
(He's taking care of other members as usual.)

1828
01:11:44,912 --> 01:11:46,481
Kyung Soo always does this for us.

1829
01:11:46,482 --> 01:11:47,482
(Kyung Soo always does this for us.)

1830
01:11:47,483 --> 01:11:49,052
So I always stand behind him.

1831
01:11:51,822 --> 01:11:55,652
(You seem used to helping other members.)

1832
01:11:55,722 --> 01:11:57,322
Because I want to rush.

1833
01:11:58,422 --> 01:12:00,062
It's not my will to help them.

1834
01:12:00,122 --> 01:12:01,222
They're slow.

1835
01:12:01,932 --> 01:12:03,292
So it's frustrating.

1836
01:12:03,832 --> 01:12:05,062
You know what I mean.

1837
01:12:05,532 --> 01:12:09,502
(They feel like children by water to Kyung Soo.)

1838
01:12:10,632 --> 01:12:13,972
(GBRB: Joy Pops Laugh Pops)

1839
01:12:15,342 --> 01:12:16,411
Check this out.

1840
01:12:16,412 --> 01:12:17,471
(The expedition team enters the departure area.)

1841
01:12:17,472 --> 01:12:18,711
Their bread looks good, right?

1842
01:12:18,712 --> 01:12:19,741
Yes, it looks good.

1843
01:12:19,742 --> 01:12:21,381
- This place looks good.
-  Do you want to try it?

1844
01:12:21,382 --> 01:12:23,312
- Bread and coffee look good, right?
-  Have bread and coffee?

1845
01:12:24,212 --> 01:12:25,481
They have this too.

1846
01:12:25,482 --> 01:12:27,182
- Yes.
-  That looks good.

1847
01:12:29,152 --> 01:12:30,351
- One of these and...
-  One croissant,

1848
01:12:30,352 --> 01:12:31,752
one mocha bread, and one of that?

1849
01:12:32,122 --> 01:12:34,121
- It won't be enough.
-  Right?

1850
01:12:34,122 --> 01:12:36,162
This looks good. Do you want to try it?

1851
01:12:36,332 --> 01:12:37,632
- Let's get garlic bread.
-  Let's get the chocolate chips.

1852
01:12:38,192 --> 01:12:39,402
This is huge.

1853
01:12:40,002 --> 01:12:41,232
- This too?
-  Yes.

1854
01:12:41,702 --> 01:12:44,902
(Ordering quickly)

1855
01:12:46,042 --> 01:12:47,841
If bread and coffee cost 60 dollars,

1856
01:12:47,842 --> 01:12:48,942
it's not that cheap.

1857
01:12:50,242 --> 01:12:51,772
But then we did order a lot.

1858
01:12:53,512 --> 01:12:55,211
Until we can eat again,

1859
01:12:55,212 --> 01:12:57,311
it takes a long time.

1860
01:12:57,312 --> 01:12:58,381
(Flexing on bread to save energy)

1861
01:12:58,382 --> 01:12:59,522
You're right.

1862
01:12:59,952 --> 01:13:02,822
(Sitting in front of the gate after purchasing bread)

1863
01:13:03,452 --> 01:13:05,322
This isn't mocha. This is chocolate.

1864
01:13:08,762 --> 01:13:12,461
(Substantial breakfast before moving a long distance)

1865
01:13:12,462 --> 01:13:13,631
- It's tasty.
-  Yes.

1866
01:13:13,632 --> 01:13:14,802
We have one.

1867
01:13:15,372 --> 01:13:16,502
Eat a lot.

1868
01:13:16,532 --> 01:13:17,902
You nosebled yesterday.

1869
01:13:18,902 --> 01:13:20,541
(The production staff nosebled the night before.)

1870
01:13:20,542 --> 01:13:22,012
It's such a tight schedule.

1871
01:13:22,372 --> 01:13:23,711
It's a self-guided tour,

1872
01:13:23,712 --> 01:13:25,312
but it's a tight schedule.

1873
01:13:26,242 --> 01:13:28,242
- Due to the time difference.
-  That's true.

1874
01:13:28,752 --> 01:13:30,282
Two people nosebled.

1875
01:13:31,582 --> 01:13:32,851
It's high in the mountains.

1876
01:13:32,852 --> 01:13:34,121
(Nosebleeder 1, nosebleeder 2)

1877
01:13:34,122 --> 01:13:35,122
And...

1878
01:13:35,123 --> 01:13:36,951
they happen to be sitting together.

1879
01:13:36,952 --> 01:13:38,322
Two people who nosebled.

1880
01:13:40,692 --> 01:13:43,462
How much bread are you having in the morning?

1881
01:13:45,132 --> 01:13:47,362
It's actually not enough for us, but we still shared it.

1882
01:13:48,462 --> 01:13:49,971
(Eating a lot until they reach Cancun)

1883
01:13:49,972 --> 01:13:51,771
- You're tight on budget.
-  Trust me. It's good.

1884
01:13:51,772 --> 01:13:55,072
It's been a while. I'm trying to eat a lot when I can.

1885
01:13:56,212 --> 01:13:57,711
I'm not that gluttonous,

1886
01:13:57,712 --> 01:13:59,812
but when I'm with them, I become greedy.

1887
01:13:59,942 --> 01:14:01,782
I want to eat a lot fast.

1888
01:14:02,212 --> 01:14:04,882
And when we cut it, I take the big piece.

1889
01:14:05,282 --> 01:14:06,481
I think it's been like 30 years.

1890
01:14:06,482 --> 01:14:08,752
(His voracious appetite returns after 30 years.)

1891
01:14:09,892 --> 01:14:11,022
This is so good.

1892
01:14:11,392 --> 01:14:12,662
- What is it?
-  It's tasty.

1893
01:14:13,192 --> 01:14:14,222
What is it?

1894
01:14:14,962 --> 01:14:18,031
(It's the expedition team's potato doll.)

1895
01:14:18,032 --> 01:14:19,362
I thought it was real bread.

1896
01:14:21,902 --> 01:14:23,632
So I received it carefully.

1897
01:14:24,402 --> 01:14:27,242
It's kind of soft.

1898
01:14:28,172 --> 01:14:29,371
I'm feeling great.

1899
01:14:29,372 --> 01:14:32,842
(Even a rolling fallen leaf is enough to make them laugh.)

1900
01:14:33,512 --> 01:14:35,852
Boarding has begun.

1901
01:14:36,582 --> 01:14:40,052
(You're finally going to Cancun. How does it feel?)

1902
01:14:40,422 --> 01:14:44,752
I really want to go back...

1903
01:14:45,022 --> 01:14:47,362
to have tripe tacos.

1904
01:14:47,422 --> 01:14:49,232
But I've found a new place.

1905
01:14:50,592 --> 01:14:51,762
There's one in Cancun too.

1906
01:14:52,462 --> 01:14:53,761
In a way,

1907
01:14:53,762 --> 01:14:56,602
this is the beginning of my trip.

1908
01:14:57,932 --> 01:14:59,241
- That's what I think.
-  Didn't you...

1909
01:14:59,242 --> 01:15:00,772
say that a few days ago?

1910
01:15:01,102 --> 01:15:03,272
There's so much to do when we get there.

1911
01:15:03,372 --> 01:15:04,972
We have to rent a car.

1912
01:15:05,072 --> 01:15:08,612
Airbnb has a different way of checking in.

1913
01:15:09,012 --> 01:15:10,351
I'll have to do that.

1914
01:15:10,352 --> 01:15:13,052
We're also tight on budget.

1915
01:15:13,582 --> 01:15:14,751
It's not easy.

1916
01:15:14,752 --> 01:15:16,552

- So many mosquitoes.
-  If you rent a car,

01:15:40,942 --> 01:15:43,051
- no more complex work.
-  Right.

1927
01:15:43,052 --> 01:15:44,652
Going there is a piece of cake.

1928
01:15:44,712 --> 01:15:46,652
You have Doh Kyung Soo, the GPS.

1930

(you don't need to worry about finding a way.)

1931
01:15:50,722 --> 01:15:52,561
I think they're all rent-a-car.

1932
01:15:52,562 --> 01:15:53,722
Right.

1933
01:15:55,192 --> 01:15:56,432
Then,

1934
01:15:57,292 --> 01:15:58,561
do you want to rent a car first?

1935
01:15:58,562 --> 01:15:59,831
- I'll get our luggage.
-  Should I?

1936
01:15:59,832 --> 01:16:01,432
- To save time.
-  Sure.

1937
01:16:01,532 --> 01:16:02,702
See you.

01:16:11,572 --> 01:16:13,182
The most crowded one is...

1941
01:16:13,742 --> 01:16:16,182
Hertz is the most common.

1942
01:16:16,382 --> 01:16:17,551
That one...

1943
01:16:17,552 --> 01:16:20,282
- Should we go with that?
-  and that is also popular.

1944
01:16:20,582 --> 01:16:21,752
Should we rent it here?

1945
01:16:22,292 --> 01:16:24,022
- This is the most crowded.
-  I know.

1946
01:16:25,962 --> 01:16:27,121
Let's check it out.

1947
01:16:27,122 --> 01:16:28,932
(They decide to rent a car from the closest company.)

1948
01:16:30,062 --> 01:16:31,761
- Spanish? English?
-  English.

1949
01:16:31,762 --> 01:16:33,661
All right. How many days do you need a car?

1950
01:16:33,662 --> 01:16:35,501
We need four days.

1951
01:16:35,502 --> 01:16:37,372
- Four days? Yes. All right.
-  Yes.

1952
01:16:37,402 --> 01:16:39,071
Give me a second, please.

1953
01:16:39,072 --> 01:16:42,001
We have three big luggage.

1954
01:16:42,002 --> 01:16:44,242
I think an SUV is better.

1955
01:16:45,782 --> 01:16:47,381
Or you want an SUV?

1956
01:16:47,382 --> 01:16:49,312
- Yes, an SUV is better.
-  All right.

1957
01:16:49,712 --> 01:16:52,682
It is for five people.

1958
01:16:52,782 --> 01:16:54,521
- That won't be easy.
-  It's 340 dollars.

1959
01:16:54,522 --> 01:16:56,722
- It's your price for an SUV.
-  wenty-four hours times...

1960
01:16:57,352 --> 01:16:58,991
- US dollar?
-  US dollar, yes.

1961
01:16:58,992 --> 01:17:01,661
The final price with the tax and insurance included.

1962
01:17:01,662 --> 01:17:02,962
- One second.
-  Yes.

1963
01:17:03,362 --> 01:17:05,662
If it's 340 US dollars,

1964
01:17:05,802 --> 01:17:07,631
that's 469,000 won.

1965
01:17:07,632 --> 01:17:09,172
(That's 469,000 won.)

1966
01:17:10,832 --> 01:17:12,501
Okay. We're going to come back. Thank you.

1967
01:17:12,502 --> 01:17:14,372
- All right. What do you need?
-  What?

1968
01:17:14,572 --> 01:17:15,871
What do you need?

1969
01:17:15,872 --> 01:17:17,341
(The rent-a-car employee stops the expedition team.)

1970
01:17:17,342 --> 01:17:19,812
We need a cheaper and bigger car.

1971
01:17:20,712 --> 01:17:22,282
- Give me a second.
-  To save money. Yes.

1972
01:17:23,112 --> 01:17:25,452
(The boss, who was listening in the back, appears.)

1973
01:17:25,652 --> 01:17:26,721
Do you need one car?

1974
01:17:26,722 --> 01:17:28,022
- Just one car.
-  One car?

1975
01:17:28,122 --> 01:17:29,392
All right.

1976
01:17:29,492 --> 01:17:32,992
(An emergency meeting takes place.)

1977
01:17:33,792 --> 01:17:35,732
This is how we haggle.

1978
01:17:35,962 --> 01:17:38,092
- Good.
-  We can haggle over the rent-a-car?

1979
01:17:38,332 --> 01:17:39,931
Sir, for the SUV...

1980
01:17:39,932 --> 01:17:41,662
He's the master of bargains.

1981
01:17:42,902 --> 01:17:47,341
(He begins bargaining.)

1982
01:17:47,342 --> 01:17:48,841
I've never seen anyone haggling over the rent-a-car.

1983
01:17:48,842 --> 01:17:50,572
Kwang Soo, don't let them discourage you.

1984
01:17:51,642 --> 01:17:53,541
For my final means,

1985
01:17:53,542 --> 01:17:54,841
- Sir.
-  in Spanish...

1986
01:17:54,842 --> 01:17:56,611
Sir. For this one. SUV.

1987
01:17:56,612 --> 01:17:57,852
- This one?
-  Yes.

1988
01:17:59,622 --> 01:18:02,651
(The rent-a-car price became 20 dollars cheaper.)

1989
01:18:02,652 --> 01:18:03,691
One second.

1990
01:18:03,692 --> 01:18:05,252
- It's 440,000 won?
-  With taxes and insurance included.

1991
01:18:05,292 --> 01:18:07,562
(I see.)

1992
01:18:08,522 --> 01:18:10,591
Give me a discount.

1993
01:18:10,592 --> 01:18:12,762
Amigo, I already did it.

1994
01:18:13,032 --> 01:18:14,631
- How about...
-  Yes, I showed you.

1995
01:18:14,632 --> 01:18:16,231
(Woo Bin took his final means, but the employee is firm.)

1996
01:18:16,232 --> 01:18:19,372
(CEO Lee was watching.)

1997
01:18:19,702 --> 01:18:21,102
We're poor.

1998
01:18:21,742 --> 01:18:23,171
- We're poor.
-  Me too.

1999
01:18:23,172 --> 01:18:24,771
- Really?
-  For you, now...

2000
01:18:24,772 --> 01:18:25,981
it's only 80.

2001
01:18:25,982 --> 01:18:27,381
- When I said we're poor, - So...

2002
01:18:27,382 --> 01:18:28,482
- he said, "Me too." - So, 80...

2003
01:18:29,082 --> 01:18:31,352
- I don't know what to say to that.
-  Yes, times four.

2004
01:18:32,082 --> 01:18:34,121
It's 100 dollars a day.

2005
01:18:34,122 --> 01:18:36,952
But I think he's offering it for 80 dollars.

2006
01:18:37,422 --> 01:18:39,592
- We need that size, though.
-  Yes.

2007
01:18:39,922 --> 01:18:41,092
But...

2008
01:18:41,422 --> 01:18:42,661
- What should we do?
-  Let's go with this.

2009
01:18:42,662 --> 01:18:43,991
- Go with this?
-  Yes.

2010
01:18:43,992 --> 01:18:45,292
I think this is the best.

2011
01:18:47,162 --> 01:18:48,661
Okay. We'll go with that.

2012
01:18:48,662 --> 01:18:50,832
I'll need your credit card and driver's license, please.

2013
01:18:50,902 --> 01:18:52,001
All right.

2014
01:18:52,002 --> 01:18:53,972
(The rent-a-car employee and the auditor agreed on 320 dollars.)

2015
01:18:55,102 --> 01:18:56,872
I need your signature, please.

2016
01:18:59,682 --> 01:19:01,042
- Give me a second, please.
-  Yes.

2017
01:19:01,312 --> 01:19:03,282
- And we finish in the main office.
-  Where's the car?

2018
01:19:03,682 --> 01:19:05,411
I think he's telling us to wait.

2019
01:19:05,412 --> 01:19:07,051
- You wait and pick up.
-  Okay.

2020
01:19:07,052 --> 01:19:10,322
He's asking if you're a YouTuber or...

2021
01:19:10,792 --> 01:19:11,792
- We...
-  an actor?

2022
01:19:11,793 --> 01:19:13,662
- What we need is a...
-  Are you an actor?

2023
01:19:14,022 --> 01:19:15,832
We're farmers in Korea.

2024
01:19:16,332 --> 01:19:18,962
(The former farmers are visiting Cancun.)

2025
01:19:19,062 --> 01:19:20,402
They rented it. I think they rented a car.

2026
01:19:20,562 --> 01:19:21,702
What?

2027
01:19:22,272 --> 01:19:24,272
Did you do it?

2028
01:19:24,732 --> 01:19:26,541
I have to go with him.

2029
01:19:26,542 --> 01:19:27,571
- Okay.
-  I have to go register it.

2030
01:19:27,572 --> 01:19:29,312
Our luggage will be here soon.

2031
01:19:29,772 --> 01:19:30,972
- Kwang Soo.
-  Yes?

2032
01:19:31,042 --> 01:19:33,182
- I got a message from Airbnb.
-  Okay.

2033
01:19:33,282 --> 01:19:35,511
I don't need to check in.

2034
01:19:35,512 --> 01:19:37,912
I just need to unlock the safe by the window.

2035
01:19:38,652 --> 01:19:39,851
(The one in charge of the luggage is picking up the luggage.)

2036
01:19:39,852 --> 01:19:41,281
I didn't know that still exists.

2037
01:19:41,282 --> 01:19:43,992
(The one in charge of the luggage is picking up the luggage.)

2038
01:19:44,122 --> 01:19:46,121
To use hot water,

2039
01:19:46,122 --> 01:19:47,561
we have to turn on the heater outside the garden.

2040
01:19:47,562 --> 01:19:48,692
Let's go.

2041
01:19:48,762 --> 01:19:50,162
There was a reason it was cheap.

2042
01:19:50,362 --> 01:19:51,932
Maybe the translation is wrong?

2043
01:19:52,902 --> 01:19:54,631
That's funny. Let's go find out what it's like.

2044
01:19:54,632 --> 01:19:55,701
There is still a place like that...

2045
01:19:55,702 --> 01:19:57,002
- in 2025?
-  Even if it's poor, it'll be funny.

2046
01:19:58,572 --> 01:20:00,502
It's hot. It's humid.

2047
01:20:01,872 --> 01:20:03,471
It's a completely different city.

2048
01:20:03,472 --> 01:20:06,311
Hey, this is different from Mexico City.

2049
01:20:06,312 --> 01:20:08,781
Even the trees are different.

2050
01:20:08,782 --> 01:20:09,811
I know.

2051
01:20:09,812 --> 01:20:11,052
There are palm trees.

2052
01:20:12,282 --> 01:20:14,852
Because the weather is different,

2053
01:20:15,022 --> 01:20:17,222
- it feels like a new trip.
-  I know.

2054
01:20:18,122 --> 01:20:20,722
It's more exciting here.

2055
01:20:21,192 --> 01:20:22,861
It feels like...

2056
01:20:22,862 --> 01:20:24,461
- everyone's chilling.
-  I know.

2057
01:20:24,462 --> 01:20:26,002
Do we have to take the car?

2058
01:20:26,302 --> 01:20:28,832
I think so. I think we're moving to the main office.

2059
01:20:29,102 --> 01:20:30,531
How many people are there?

2060
01:20:30,532 --> 01:20:31,971
(They keep moving all day.)

2061
01:20:31,972 --> 01:20:33,442
- This is all.
-  All right.

2062
01:20:34,172 --> 01:20:35,271
- Thank you.
-  Thank you.

2063
01:20:35,272 --> 01:20:36,572
Thank you.

2064
01:20:38,312 --> 01:20:42,752
(Moving to the rent-a-car office)

2065
01:20:42,812 --> 01:20:45,751
Now that I'm here,

2066
01:20:45,752 --> 01:20:47,982
I suddenly wish to be fluent.

2067
01:20:48,622 --> 01:20:50,292
You're fluent in Japanese.

2068
01:20:50,892 --> 01:20:52,892
But they don't speak Japanese here.

2069
01:20:53,022 --> 01:20:55,192
We have that thought every time we go on a trip.

2070
01:20:55,262 --> 01:20:56,331
Right.

2071
01:20:56,332 --> 01:20:58,762
- Every time we're on a trip...
-  Since the plane.

2072
01:20:59,532 --> 01:21:00,601
When I'm on a trip, I'm like,

2073
01:21:00,602 --> 01:21:02,002
"Just wait until I return to Korea."

2074
01:21:02,932 --> 01:21:04,532
"I can't take this anymore."

2075
01:21:04,602 --> 01:21:06,202
"When I go back to Korea,"

2076
01:21:06,502 --> 01:21:08,401
"I'm going to register something."

2077
01:21:08,402 --> 01:21:11,072
- Right.
-  "A couple of times a week,"

2078
01:21:11,942 --> 01:21:13,211
"I will memorize vocabulary."

2079
01:21:13,212 --> 01:21:15,081
"Next time I come, I swear I'll show you."

2080
01:21:15,082 --> 01:21:16,311
"I swear I'll show you."

2081
01:21:16,312 --> 01:21:17,612
As soon as I return,

2082
01:21:17,982 --> 01:21:19,122
Min Byeong Cheol...

2083
01:21:20,522 --> 01:21:22,081
BCM... I'll sign up immediately.

2084
01:21:22,082 --> 01:21:24,822
(Looking as if he'd sign up all English academies in Korea)

2085
01:21:24,892 --> 01:21:26,422
And next time I go...

2086
01:21:27,322 --> 01:21:28,992
- It's a cycle.
-  It's a cycle.

2087
01:21:29,592 --> 01:21:32,462
I used to be like that, but okay.

2088
01:21:32,632 --> 01:21:33,832
I'm serious this time.

2089
01:21:35,602 --> 01:21:36,902
I realized it this time.

2090
01:21:37,472 --> 01:21:38,532
Seriously...

2091
01:21:39,442 --> 01:21:40,702
We're here.

2092
01:21:41,172 --> 01:21:42,172
Is it here?

2093
01:21:44,212 --> 01:21:46,281
- Thank you.
-  Thank you.

2094
01:21:46,282 --> 01:21:48,682
(The rent-a-car office)

2095
01:21:48,942 --> 01:21:50,612
Kwang Soo, it's so crowded.

2096
01:21:51,952 --> 01:21:53,051
It is.

2097
01:21:53,052 --> 01:21:54,382
(The office is packed with tourists.)

2098
01:21:54,922 --> 01:21:55,922
Hello.

2099
01:21:55,923 --> 01:21:57,522
I have paper.

2100
01:21:57,822 --> 01:21:59,361
- What?
-  Do you speak Spanish? No?

2101
01:21:59,362 --> 01:22:00,362
No.

2102
01:22:00,592 --> 01:22:03,532
Okay. Only 1 person or 2 people inside.

2103
01:22:03,562 --> 01:22:04,562
Okay.

2104
01:22:05,232 --> 01:22:06,862
Only 1 or 2 can go in.

2105
01:22:07,502 --> 01:22:09,272
- The driver?
-  To go inside.

2106
01:22:09,632 --> 01:22:11,602
- Go ahead.
-  Should we go?

2107
01:22:11,732 --> 01:22:12,942
I'll watch the luggage.

2108
01:22:13,702 --> 01:22:15,071
- Hello.
-  Thank you. Hello.

2109
01:22:15,072 --> 01:22:16,342
- A reservation?
-  Yes.

2110
01:22:16,812 --> 01:22:18,571
I'm going to need your driver's licenses.

2111
01:22:18,572 --> 01:22:20,711
- Oh, yes.
-  Passport and credit card.

2112
01:22:20,712 --> 01:22:21,942
Okay.

2113
01:22:22,452 --> 01:22:24,581
We have three drivers.

2114
01:22:24,582 --> 01:22:28,251
Yes? You got an additional driver for free.

2115
01:22:28,252 --> 01:22:31,221
- And you need an additional driver?
-  Yes.

2116
01:22:31,222 --> 01:22:32,421
Driver's licenses,

2117
01:22:32,422 --> 01:22:33,622
- so I can put it in the system.
-  Okay.

2118
01:22:34,592 --> 01:22:36,392
(Soon)

2119
01:22:36,862 --> 01:22:38,832
- I'm losing my mind.
-  Are you done?

2120
01:22:39,602 --> 01:22:40,761
Are you done now?

2121
01:22:40,762 --> 01:22:42,232
- Did you get the key?
-  The car's outside.

2122
01:22:42,732 --> 01:22:43,801
Well done.

2123
01:22:43,802 --> 01:22:45,032
- Well done.
-  Do you want me to hold it?

2124
01:22:45,572 --> 01:22:46,702
Yes, keep it.

2125
01:22:47,242 --> 01:22:48,602
- When we go outside...
-  You can't drive.

2126
01:22:48,702 --> 01:22:50,141
We have to show them outside anyway.

2127
01:22:50,142 --> 01:22:52,312
- Or we can leave it in the car.
-  Let's take it for now.

2128
01:22:52,342 --> 01:22:53,741
- You can't drive.
-  What?

2129
01:22:53,742 --> 01:22:55,382
- Only the two of us will drive.
-  Only two people can drive.

2130
01:22:55,712 --> 01:22:57,382
If we add one more person, it costs a lot.

2131
01:22:58,112 --> 01:23:00,152
- How much?
-  Over ten dollars.

2132
01:23:00,352 --> 01:23:01,552
So the two of us will drive.

2133
01:23:02,152 --> 01:23:03,721
- Really?
-  It's better that way.

2134
01:23:03,722 --> 01:23:05,252
But we wouldn't be driving so much.

2135
01:23:05,492 --> 01:23:07,292
- Is this ours?
-  I think we will be driving a lot.

2136
01:23:07,662 --> 01:23:08,792
Thank you, Kwang Soo.

2137
01:23:10,362 --> 01:23:12,262
- Let's go.
-  Let's go.

2138
01:23:14,002 --> 01:23:15,432
Without Woo Bin,

2139
01:23:15,902 --> 01:23:17,302
I would've spent a day here.

2140
01:23:17,672 --> 01:23:19,001
(Thanks to the man fluent in English,)

2141
01:23:19,002 --> 01:23:20,342
(they got to reserve a rent-a-car easily.)

2142
01:23:20,502 --> 01:23:21,702
I think that's the one.

2143
01:23:23,812 --> 01:23:27,812
It's from our country. We'd be used to it.

2144
01:23:28,282 --> 01:23:30,252
This means stop.

2145
01:23:31,752 --> 01:23:35,482
(While the director, who won't be driving, checks the car...)

2146
01:23:35,652 --> 01:23:37,592
- It's easier than the US.
-  Yes.

2147
01:23:38,552 --> 01:23:39,661
- Oh, this one.
-  This is it.

2148
01:23:39,662 --> 01:23:40,691
(The drivers review the Mexican traffic law.)

2149
01:23:40,692 --> 01:23:41,962
Alto means stop.

2150
01:23:42,792 --> 01:23:43,962
Parking is E.

2151
01:23:45,192 --> 01:23:47,831
Are you off to eat or...

2152
01:23:47,832 --> 01:23:49,472
- We're going to eat first.
-  Are you going to eat?

2153
01:23:49,702 --> 01:23:50,832
Seafood ramen.

2154
01:23:51,032 --> 01:23:52,201
- A ramen restaurant?
-  Yes.

2155
01:23:52,202 --> 01:23:53,202
(Their first destination is the seafood ramen restaurant.)

2156
01:23:53,203 --> 01:23:54,402
- He found the place.
-  First...

2157
01:23:55,742 --> 01:23:56,942
Next to the hotel...

2158
01:23:57,212 --> 01:23:58,242
Let's get in the car first.

2159
01:24:00,282 --> 01:24:03,712
(Director Doh doesn't finish his sentence.)

2160
01:24:04,582 --> 01:24:06,652
I will...

2161
01:24:07,822 --> 01:24:09,121
The address...

2162
01:24:09,122 --> 01:24:10,622
Are we going there?

2163
01:24:10,952 --> 01:24:12,221
To the restaurant?

2164
01:24:12,222 --> 01:24:14,722
Here's what we're going to do.

2165
01:24:15,992 --> 01:24:18,732
I came up with a perfect plan.

2166
01:24:18,832 --> 01:24:19,902
Good. I love it.

2167
01:24:20,732 --> 01:24:24,172
Let's get out of here first and talk.

2168
01:24:24,432 --> 01:24:25,471
Sure.

2169
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:27,641
Did you send the address, Kyung Soo?

2170
01:24:27,642 --> 01:24:29,042
I just sent it.

2171
01:24:30,372 --> 01:24:33,182
(Entering the address)

2172
01:24:33,242 --> 01:24:36,552
(Setting off to the address that Kyung Soo sent)

2173
01:24:37,252 --> 01:24:39,682
- We're entering Cancun.
-  Yes, cool.

2174
01:24:39,922 --> 01:24:41,222
This is Cancun.

2175
01:24:42,722 --> 01:24:43,722
I'm getting excited.

2176
01:24:44,992 --> 01:24:47,591
I can feel the thrill that something's going to happen.

2177
01:24:47,592 --> 01:24:49,432
(Grinning)

2178
01:24:49,562 --> 01:24:51,692
(What's going to happen in Cancun?)

2179
01:24:51,792 --> 01:24:53,032
The weather is so nice.

2180
01:24:54,032 --> 01:24:56,432
Have you driven a lot abroad?

2181
01:24:56,602 --> 01:24:58,232
A little bit. When I was traveling.

2182
01:24:58,602 --> 01:25:00,102
If we have a car,

2183
01:25:00,642 --> 01:25:03,472
it's easy to drive... I mean, it's easy to move around.

2184
01:25:04,142 --> 01:25:05,712
I have never driven abroad before.

2185
01:25:06,442 --> 01:25:08,341
Then this will be your debut.

2186
01:25:08,342 --> 01:25:09,681
Either today or tomorrow will be your debut.

2187
01:25:09,682 --> 01:25:10,852
- Yes.
-  I see.

2188
01:25:11,382 --> 01:25:12,582
You've never driven abroad before?

2189
01:25:12,922 --> 01:25:14,252
Not outside the country.

2190
01:25:15,422 --> 01:25:16,822
Maybe I should've registered Kyung Soo.

2191
01:25:18,422 --> 01:25:20,062
This is also part of the trip.

2192
01:25:20,162 --> 01:25:21,192
That's true.

2193
01:25:22,932 --> 01:25:25,691
Have you used Google Maps GPS before?

2194
01:25:25,692 --> 01:25:26,862
I do that often.

2195
01:25:27,062 --> 01:25:28,531
Then...

2196
01:25:28,532 --> 01:25:29,831
I'm good at using the GPS.

2197
01:25:29,832 --> 01:25:31,201
The GPS tells you...

2198
01:25:31,202 --> 01:25:32,872
- to move slightly to the right.
-  Yes.

2199
01:25:33,172 --> 01:25:34,372
That's really confusing.

2200
01:25:36,672 --> 01:25:39,582
Did you decide to drive because Woo Bin said,

2201
01:25:40,042 --> 01:25:41,142
"Let's just do it?"

2202
01:25:41,582 --> 01:25:44,281
No, the person at the registration registered me.

2203
01:25:44,282 --> 01:25:45,982
- Without asking?
-  That's not true.

2204
01:25:46,422 --> 01:25:48,481
Kwang Soo suggested it.

2205
01:25:48,482 --> 01:25:49,652
- Really?
-  Yes.

2206
01:25:50,252 --> 01:25:51,292
What's gotten into you?

2207
01:25:52,292 --> 01:25:53,962
No, he registered me already.

2208
01:25:53,992 --> 01:25:55,062
No.

2209
01:25:55,192 --> 01:25:57,031
He asked us if we wanted to add one more person after registering me,

2210
01:25:57,032 --> 01:25:58,032
and it was too expensive.

2211
01:25:59,662 --> 01:26:01,901
(After driving for a while...)

2212
01:26:01,902 --> 01:26:04,031
- Look.
-  It's slippery.

2213
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:06,372
(The car was going fine.)

2214
01:26:08,442 --> 01:26:11,342
(Then the black car suddenly barges in.)

2215
01:26:12,112 --> 01:26:13,211
- Look.
-  It's slippery.

2216
01:26:13,212 --> 01:26:14,341
(The expedition team's car barely avoided it.)

2217
01:26:14,342 --> 01:26:15,681
We're safe.

2218
01:26:15,682 --> 01:26:17,381
Oh, what?

2219
01:26:17,382 --> 01:26:18,711
We're safe.

2220
01:26:18,712 --> 01:26:19,722
Gosh.

2221
01:26:20,052 --> 01:26:22,181
No, it's that car's fault.

2222
01:26:22,182 --> 01:26:23,921
Because that car barged in, this car clashed.

2223
01:26:23,922 --> 01:26:25,922
- That car clashed.
-  The police...

2224
01:26:26,162 --> 01:26:28,191
- What happened?
-  Because the other car...

2225
01:26:28,192 --> 01:26:31,061
barged in, he almost hit us.

2226
01:26:31,062 --> 01:26:33,402
- I know.
-  He should've stepped on the brake.

2227
01:26:33,632 --> 01:26:34,961
That was close.

2228
01:26:34,962 --> 01:26:35,962
I know.

2229
01:26:35,963 --> 01:26:37,031
(That was close.)

2230
01:26:37,032 --> 01:26:38,671
- I was scared.
-  That driver...

2231
01:26:38,672 --> 01:26:40,341
went like this.

2232
01:26:40,342 --> 01:26:41,701
- He cut us.
-  Why did he do that?

2233
01:26:41,702 --> 01:26:43,441
- He was blocked.
-  To barge in.

2234
01:26:43,442 --> 01:26:45,611
- He barged in and clashed.
-  Yes.

2235
01:26:45,612 --> 01:26:46,842
Everyone slid.

2236
01:26:47,282 --> 01:26:48,742
- My goodness.
-  That was close.

2237
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:51,782
I knew you were the best driver.

2238
01:26:52,352 --> 01:26:54,022
- I was scared.
-  That was stable.

2239
01:26:54,852 --> 01:26:56,791
- If there was a car on the right, - He really is the best driver.

2240
01:26:56,792 --> 01:26:58,722
- Right.
-  I would've hit it.

2241
01:26:59,492 --> 01:27:01,222
- It's a relief.
-  That was really cool.

2242
01:27:01,922 --> 01:27:02,932
It's a relief.

2243
01:27:02,992 --> 01:27:04,791
You sounded calm.

2244
01:27:04,792 --> 01:27:05,832
(Startled)

2245
01:27:06,662 --> 01:27:08,332
When you said that,

2246
01:27:08,702 --> 01:27:10,672
it didn't sound too much.

2247
01:27:12,002 --> 01:27:13,801
When you say that out loud,

2248
01:27:13,802 --> 01:27:15,702
- everyone becomes flustered.
-  Everyone gets scared.

2249
01:27:17,542 --> 01:27:19,011
Woo Bin did a good job of avoiding it.

2250
01:27:19,012 --> 01:27:20,111
That was shocking.

2251
01:27:20,112 --> 01:27:21,281
It would've been horrible...

2252
01:27:21,282 --> 01:27:22,441
- if we got into an accident.
-  I know.

2253
01:27:22,442 --> 01:27:24,281
You know what?

2254
01:27:24,282 --> 01:27:25,981
There was a 100 percent coverage insurance,

2255
01:27:25,982 --> 01:27:28,321
- but we took the 90 percent promo.
-  We went with the 90 percent one.

2256
01:27:28,322 --> 01:27:29,492
We have to pay ten percent.

2257
01:27:30,022 --> 01:27:31,121
- We...
-  If we get...

2258
01:27:31,122 --> 01:27:32,191
into even a minor accident,

2259
01:27:32,192 --> 01:27:33,722
we're going straight to Seoul.

2260
01:27:34,392 --> 01:27:35,562
We have to pay and...

2261
01:27:35,692 --> 01:27:36,931
- Fly straight to Seoul?
-  Yes.

2262
01:27:36,932 --> 01:27:39,092
(They almost returned to Seoul as soon as they landed in Cancun.)

2263
01:27:40,262 --> 01:27:42,332
The car in front has a broken windshield.

2264
01:27:43,132 --> 01:27:45,472
- Really? You're right. It's broken.
-  Yes.

2265
01:27:46,702 --> 01:27:48,301
I guess he drives without fixing it.

2266
01:27:48,302 --> 01:27:50,411
(Another bad sign?)

2267
01:27:50,412 --> 01:27:52,782
Is this right?

2268
01:27:53,412 --> 01:27:55,642
Was it a good idea to rent a car?

2269
01:27:57,012 --> 01:27:58,112
I don't know.

2270
01:28:00,422 --> 01:28:03,622
I thought everything was perfect until I saw the accident.

2271
01:28:04,692 --> 01:28:06,261
I'm suddenly getting scared.

2272
01:28:06,262 --> 01:28:08,322
(They're suddenly getting fearful.)

2273
01:28:08,762 --> 01:28:10,491
- Aren't you hungry?
-  I'm hungry.

2274
01:28:10,492 --> 01:28:11,832
- Aren't you hungry?
-  I'm starving.

2275
01:28:12,862 --> 01:28:14,032
It's 5pm already.

2276
01:28:14,502 --> 01:28:16,802
(All they've eaten today is bread.)

2277
01:28:17,072 --> 01:28:18,401
Ramen sounds good.

2278
01:28:18,402 --> 01:28:19,941
- Right?
-  I want ramen so badly.

2279
01:28:19,942 --> 01:28:21,002
Aren't you starving?

2280
01:28:21,702 --> 01:28:22,811
(It's the perfect time for ramen.)

2281
01:28:22,812 --> 01:28:24,271
It looks awesome.

2282
01:28:24,272 --> 01:28:25,272
I know.

2283
01:28:25,273 --> 01:28:30,012
(CEO Lee checks the ramen restaurant address.)

2284
01:28:30,112 --> 01:28:31,812
What's this? What is this place?

2285
01:28:33,282 --> 01:28:34,752
Is this how it looks?

2286
01:28:35,022 --> 01:28:36,252
We're going there first.

2287
01:28:37,392 --> 01:28:38,492
Instead of the ramen place?

2288
01:28:38,752 --> 01:28:39,922
We're going to stop there first.

2289
01:28:41,262 --> 01:28:42,662
What? Wait a minute.

2290
01:28:43,032 --> 01:28:44,191
- What?
-  He didn't send you...

2291
01:28:44,192 --> 01:28:45,892
- the ramen place address.
-  Then?

2292
01:28:47,432 --> 01:28:48,732
- Busted.
-  Why are we going there?

2293
01:28:49,232 --> 01:28:51,302
- Can you believe it?
-  Why? What is that place?

2294
01:28:52,402 --> 01:28:54,702
I think once we go back to Korea...

2295
01:28:55,102 --> 01:28:57,372
(We'd never see each other again.)

2296
01:28:57,672 --> 01:28:59,272
(CEO Lee and Auditor Kim are furious.)

2297
01:28:59,612 --> 01:29:00,641
(I finally know...)

2298
01:29:00,642 --> 01:29:02,542
(what you're like.)

2299
01:29:02,852 --> 01:29:05,012
(The concerned party is shameless.)

2300
01:29:05,112 --> 01:29:06,581
- Why did you remove the ring?
-  To wash my hands...

2301
01:29:06,582 --> 01:29:08,782
Are you feeling guilty? Are you hiding something?

2302
01:29:08,852 --> 01:29:11,392
(The expedition's friendship is starting to shatter.)

2303
01:29:11,852 --> 01:29:13,992
(On top of that...)

2304
01:29:14,122 --> 01:29:16,432
What is this? Why are there so many ants?

2305
01:29:16,492 --> 01:29:18,161
Hey, the ants built a house here.

2306
01:29:18,162 --> 01:29:20,262
(The house is seized by the ants?)

2307
01:29:20,832 --> 01:29:23,402
(That is only the beginning.)

2308
01:29:23,602 --> 01:29:24,972
It's not blood, is it?

2309
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:27,372
This is...

2310
01:29:27,602 --> 01:29:28,871
This is so scary.

2311
01:29:28,872 --> 01:29:30,612
- Kwang Soo!
-  What?

2312
01:29:30,642 --> 01:29:32,442
(The secret of the house starts to reveal one by one.)

2313
01:29:32,642 --> 01:29:34,882
(What is that?)

2314
01:29:35,142 --> 01:29:36,882
(Filled with a spooky vibe)

2315
01:29:37,582 --> 01:29:39,822
(Director Doh ends up lying down.)

2316
01:29:40,582 --> 01:29:44,392
(The first night of fear in Cancun)

2317
01:29:45,452 --> 01:29:49,892
(Is the Cancun expedition team going to be okay?)

2318
01:29:49,992 --> 01:29:51,691
- Hello?
-  Hello, CEO Ko.

2319
01:29:51,692 --> 01:29:54,262
I'm CEO Lee Kwang Soo from KKPP Foods.

2320
01:29:55,062 --> 01:29:59,172
(GBRB: Joy Pops Laugh Pops)

2321
01:29:59,302 --> 01:30:01,571
(Lee Kwang Soo)

2322
01:30:01,572 --> 01:30:03,841
(Kim Woo Bin)

2323
01:30:03,842 --> 01:30:06,042
(Doh Kyung Soo)

2324
01:30:09,212 --> 01:30:10,752
(KKPP International Expedition)
