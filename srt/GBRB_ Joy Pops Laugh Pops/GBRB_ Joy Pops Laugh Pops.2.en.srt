On top of the receipts,

30
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,469
please make a simple note...

31
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,409
- on what the item is.
- Okay.

or the cashier.

43
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,629
And get a signature as well.

- Okay.

46
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:54,899
There are times you can't get a receipt.

47
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,039
We were in that situation earlier.

48
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,570

- The thing is,

56
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,359
- we have our own schedule.
- Yes.

57
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,660
We won't omit much.

58
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,860
We won't omit much.

59
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,500
How much can we omit?

60
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,999
If we say that we're sorry,

61
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,540
how much money can we omit?

62
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,699
If we apologize formally,

63
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,310
how much money can we omit?

64
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,739
It'll be nice to do this perfectly,

65
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,240
but a small amount of money might get omitted.

To raise the limit,

67
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,210

68
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,120

About five percent.

72
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,060
Can't you make it ten percent?

73
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,259
Five percent is a lot.

(This auditor is exactly like CEO Lee.)

75
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:01,070

76
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,770
you won't need to go through an additional procedure.

77

Let's meet in the middle. Seven percent.

78
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,950
What will you do if you exceed that?

79
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,310
- If we exceed that?
- Yes.

80
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,279
- You can use your own money.
- You can use your own money.

81
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,920
- My own money?
- Yes.

(He didn't expect the danger of using his own money.)

83
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,320
What should we do?

84
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,330
It's your money, so the decision is up to you.

86
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,499
Okay.

88

(the auditor will fill in with his own money.)

89
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,700
Usually, it's within one percent.

90
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,440
Five percent is quite generous.

91
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,340
I didn't expect him to strike a deal.

92
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,110
I should've started at three percent.

93
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,609
I'll see until when...

00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,409
Isn't this tree really cool?

184
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:00,610
It's so big.

185
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,009
It must be an old tree.

186
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:04,810
- It must be an old tree.
- Yes.

187
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,919
Isn't it hundreds of years old?

188
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,980
(The streets of Mexico are full of huge trees.)

189
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,119
(Impressed)

190
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,189
Kwang Soo,

191
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,720
don't the roots look like feet?

192
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,720
Your feet.

193
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,130
The tree... Hey.

194
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,360
You're filming my feet so many times.

195
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,170
(They pass the street with trees that look like Kwang Soo's feet.)

196
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,000
I think it's this restaurant.

197
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,800
It's very hip.

198
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,410
It's very atmospheric.

199
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,980
It must be a famous restaurant in the neighborhood.

200
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,509
Their food must be different.

201
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,679
(Western food cooked with fire that has a Mexican twist)

202
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,380
It's bound to be tasty.

203
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,920
(A nice restaurant with the hip atmosphere in the area)

204
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,589
Shall we order by looking...

205
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,320
at the photos?

206
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,520
- Shall we try this?
- Okay.

207
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,760
We should eat the braised lamb, right?

208
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,100
Shouldn't we order a signature dish?

209
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,630
This dish...

210
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,600
looks amazing.

211
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,330
This toast.

212
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:01,370
It looks amazing.

213
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,110
One, two, three,

214
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,609
four, five. Let's order five.

215
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:07,910
- Okay. Don't order more.
- Okay.

216
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,380
Okay.

217
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,779
You know, there's no way we'll fail at this restaurant.

218
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:12,850
Seriously.

219
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,680
- Even the temperature is perfect.
- I agree.

220
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,280
Yes. The weather is so nice.

221
00:08:17,281 --> 00:08:18,419
We can wear either long sleeves or short sleeves.

222
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,989
- Seriously.
- It feels nice.

223
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,150
(Tasty food will be an icing on the cake.)

224
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,719
Thank you.

225
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,819
(While the older members are in the restroom...)

226
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:24,860
And...

227
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:28,429
one glass of sauvignon blanc.

228
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,599
Two glasses?

229
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,159
- One glass?
- Thank you.

230
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,170
(He orders a glass of wine.)

231
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:33,569
Thank you.

232
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:36,600
(The first dish is served.)

233
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,540
I can't imagine the taste.

234
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:43,240
(Director Doh tries it.)

235
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,590
It's the taste everyone knows.

236
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:55,390
Garlic, butter, lemon juice, and herbs.

237
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,630
(It's the taste he knows.)

238
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:02,360
(CEO Lee tries it next.)

239
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:09,470
(I see.)

240
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,650
(CEO Lee just nods.)

241
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,649
(The man who can't eat oysters, Woo Bin, smells the dish.)

242
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,490
I can imagine the taste.

243
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,690
(Meanwhile, in the kitchen,)

244
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,389
(the second dish with smoky flavors is complete.)

245
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,590
It looks so tasty. My goodness.

246
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,660
This cauliflower looks so tasty.

247
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,429
(Grilled cauliflower: A dish of grilled cauliflower...)

248
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:41,070
(with the fresh yogurt sauce and the spicy Mexican chilis)

249
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,699
(Braised lamb: A dish of tender lamb...)

250
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,310
(with the Mexican smoked chilis)

251
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:47,069
Por esta comida.

252
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,780
- What does that mean?
- Thank you for the food.

253
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:53,650
(He tries the cauliflower.)

254
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,280
(Okay.)

255
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:01,960
(The auditor doesn't say anything.)

256
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:05,830
(Meanwhile, the CEO takes a big piece of braised lamb...)

257
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:09,030
(and eats it with the toast.)

258
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,970
(The CEO doesn't say anything either.)

259
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:26,310
(This time, he tries the cauliflower dish.)

260
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,080
It's sour.

261
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:30,750
It's sour.

262
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,790
Did it go sour?

263
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,490
It tastes sour.

264
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,990
- It's unusual.
- Right?

265
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,760
Is it supposed to taste that way? Why does it taste sour?

266
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:41,900
I think...

267
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,900
they use a lot of sour cream.

268
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,270
It must be the sour cream.

269
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:50,940
(He's a bit taken aback by the unusual taste.)

270
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,240
The CEO has never said,

271
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:56,980
"It's tasty."

272
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,409
Really?

273
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,550
- He said, "It's sour." - The dishes are tasty,

274
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,080
but these flavors are unexpected. All the dishes are tasty.

275
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,950
They're tasty, but...

276
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,530
they don't really suit my taste.

277
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,559
The restaurants that suit...

278
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,270
the Korean taste are plentiful in Korea.

279
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,739
I'm not used to these flavors.

280
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,500
(Of course not.)

281
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:26,010
(The last dish appears.)

282
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,640
That's it. My goodness.

283
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,879
(Grilled cheese toast: A dish of toast...)

284
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,950
(with the flavorful Mexican cheese and chili jam)

285
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,780
It'll be really delicious.

286
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,620
This is it.

287
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:39,489
- Gosh, it smells like garlic bread.
- Is it the same bread?

288
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,490
Really?

289
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:46,430
(They taste it at the same time.)

290
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:50,030
(They had high expectations. How is the taste?)

291
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,840
(After the telling silence)

292
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:04,880
(Gulping)

293
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,410
Try it.

294
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,380
Kwang Soo, you're drinking Coke...

295
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,350
as if it's water.

296
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,859
- I wanted to feel the fizz.
- Seriously.

297
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,360
(The dinner is a bit lackluster.)

298
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,660
We haven't found it yet.

299
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,899
All the dishes are tasty enough,

300
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,830
but our expectations are too high.

301
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:26,600
The flavors don't suit our tastes.

302
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:29,200
It could be because...

303
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,240
we stayed up last night.

304
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:34,170
(Their taste buds could be dull due to the time difference.)

305
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,080
Right now, I really want...

306
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:40,210
to eat an insanely delicious taco.

307
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,780
I still don't feel like I'm in Mexico.

308
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,620
Let's go to the street stall street...

309
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,090
in front of the hotel...

310
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,830
and go to the most crowded place.

311
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,430
Let's try one there.

312
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:56,630
Let's do that.

313
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,599
All right. Thank you.

314
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,600
(They check the total on the receipt.)

315
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,470
How much is it?

316
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,940
It's about 130 dollars, so...

317
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,040
Only our orders got included, right?

318
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,180
Yes. One lager, two Cokes,

319
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,749
grilled cheese...

320
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,020
(They check the receipt since the total is big.)

321
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:19,120
- Grilled cheese...
- What's Blizzard? Wine?

322
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,660
- Yes.
- Did you order wine?

323
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,989
- Finish it.
- Kyung Soo.

324
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,830
- Kyung Soo, finish it.
- Hey.

325
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,330
Drink beer.

326
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,170
I'll do that. I'm sorry.

327
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,000
It's our first day,

328
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,700
so...

329
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,110
- It was an experience.
- It was an experience.

330
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,510
From now on, let's order more only if the food is tasty.

331
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,840
(Kwang Soo sighs.)

332
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:49,880
(CEO Lee is taken aback by the hefty sum.)

333
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,450
Let's drink a glass of milk before going to the restaurant.

334
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,259
- We brought the chicken juice.
- That's right.

335
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,960
I can't hold back once I see the photos.

336
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,090
I want to order everything.

337
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,930
If we drink the chicken juice first,

338
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,670
- we'll be more cool-headed.
- Okay. Let's do that.

339
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,299
Good.

340
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,600
I should've brought something from home.

341
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,270
I should've brought some side dishes...

342
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,310
like stir-fried anchovies.

343
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:17,710
- Shredded squid?
- Yes.

344
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,810
Okay.

345
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,220
Let's clink our glasses for the remainder of the trip.

346
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,690
Finish what you've ordered.

347
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,319
If I drink everything, I'll fall asleep.

348
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,190
(They wrap up the dinner by clinking their glasses.)

349
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:36,000
(GBRB: Joy Pops Laugh Pops)

350
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:37,859
(They enter a convenience store to get some energy drinks.)

351
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,930
- Woo Bin, it's here.
- Is it there?

352
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,139
Shall we buy one and share?

353
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,170
Just one?

354
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,039
- I want the whole one.
- Two.

355
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,369
- Let's share.
- We'll share.

356
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:50,040
(They only buy 2 to save up money.)

357
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,980
Shall we buy a chocolate bar?

358
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,780
Shall we buy a chocolate bar?

359
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,780
(Feigning ignorance, pretending not to hear him)

360
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,780
A chocolate bar.

361
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,150
How about this one?

362
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,790
- Let's buy one.
- You'll get thirsty again.

363
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,290
(Sighing)

364
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,530
Isn't it that you're the auditor and I'm the CEO?

365
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,630
Kwang Soo.

366
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:13,800
Suppress the urge once.

367
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,269
(Not even 5 minutes have passed...)

368
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,040
(since he said that he won't get greedy about food.)

369
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,709
Monster is so expensive.

370
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,710
- How much is it?
- It's four dollars.

371
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,709
Let's drink something like Bacchus next time.

372
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,810
I'll put it in my bag.

373
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,950
Let's share one.

374
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,320
Why do I feel like we've become poor in a few hours?

375
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,389
Don't finish it.

376
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,730
We need to drink it after eating a taco.

377
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:40,560
Let me take one more sip.

378
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,000
Let me take one more sip. Please.

379
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,069
May I take another sip?

380
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,100
Stop drinking it.

381
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,569
It's two sips per person.

382
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:52,209
- You took three sips.
- Okay.

383
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:54,110
(CEO Lee became sensitive due to the tight budget.)

384
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,640
Do we really need to travel like this?

385
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:59,809
- What?
- Seriously.

386
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:01,150
Hold on a second.

387
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,220
Do we really need to travel like this?

388
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,220
We can't even have one drink per person.

389
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,160
We need to stop after three sips.

390
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,990
How about that place?

391
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,890
- That place.
- Let's go.

392
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,129
It smells delicious.

393
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:20,530
(They walk toward the smell as if they're in a trance.)

394
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,670
Is this a taco street?

395
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,170
A street stall.

396
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,409
- Should we choose from here?
- There are more.

397
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:28,040
(A must-visit place during a food trip to Mexico)

398
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,180
(They arrive at the taco street.)

399
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,480
- What's this?
- Asado.

400
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,910
This place doesn't sell tacos.

401
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,979
What's that? Is it bread? It looks like buttocks.

402
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,620
(There are various street food items including tacos.)

403
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,160
Those are tacos.

404
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:46,090
- You're right.
- But there are no customers.

405
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,130
(They pass through the first stall.)

406
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,000
They sell tacos as well.

407
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:54,930
Three tacos.

408
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,340
(The second taco stall)

409
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,040
Shall we go a bit further?

410
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,539
- Shall we go a bit further?
- Let's go a bit further.

411
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,680
(They've become cautious in choosing where to eat.)

412
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,479
(They stop at another place.)

413
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,850
But they don't sell tacos.

414
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:09,980
They sell tacos too. Tacos.

415
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,320
It doesn't look bad.

416
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,620
Shall we eat here?

417
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,830
We shouldn't eat it if we aren't certain.

418
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,289
We shouldn't try it if we aren't certain.

419
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,499
Shall we go back to the other stall?

420
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,700
There are more stalls.

421
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:28,499
- The entire place has stalls.
- Let's go.

422
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,140
(Taco places are everywhere in Mexico.)

423
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:32,340
- Here.
- Why are there so many people?

424
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:35,940
We should eat here.

425
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,240
They have authentic tacos.

426
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,979
They have tacos.

427
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,310
(They finally find a trustworthy street stall.)

428
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,450
Everyone is enjoying the food.

429
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:48,089
- That one looks delicious.
- The red one.

430
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:50,120
(The food has the authentic smell of Mexico.)

431
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,689
Kwang Soo, let's only eat one.

432
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:53,759
Okay.

433
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,130
I'm too full.

434
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,300
One, please.

435
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:02,170
(He practices "Give me one," in Spanish.)

436
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,470
- This will be two.
- Give me one.

437
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,710
One?

438
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,580
Yes.

439
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,880
(He said yes, without knowing the meaning.)

440
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,720
Here.

441
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,690
(The taco he ordered is served.)

442
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:25,660
What is this?

443
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,300
What did you order?

444
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:31,329
What? I just asked for one, and he gave me this.

445
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:32,470
Everyone is having this one.

446
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,330
Everyone is having this one?

447
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:38,200
- No.
- Even him.

448
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:39,740
Good?

449
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,440
Give it to me.

450
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,610
What's this?

451
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,280
This is cheese.

452
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,609
- Sacheese?
- Cheese.

453
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:48,750
- Cheese?
- Cheese.

454
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,120
- Good?
- Good.

455
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,820
- Thank you.
- That's my favorite.

456
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,960
(It's been approved by the locals,)

457
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,990
(so all that's left is to try it.)

458
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:00,960
It's cold, though.

459
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:02,160
It's cold?

460
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,599
It's cold?

461
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,900
It's hot on the bottom, but...

462
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:09,200
(He just goes on and tries it.)

463
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,480
Try it.

464
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:24,480
(His words are somewhat unsettling.)

465
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,520
I can only smell corn.

466
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,090
Try it.

467
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:34,960
(Woo Bin takes a big bite.)

468
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,100
(Savoring)

469
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,799
(Thinking)

470
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,470
(They become quiet whenever they eat something.)

471
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,100
It's good.

472
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,140
It's good, but...

473
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,680
(Kyung Soo was looking forward to it the most.)

474
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,680
You need to eat it with the rice.

475
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,680
It's...

476
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,990
It's somewhat similar to the first store.

477
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,650
Is it chicken?

478
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,920
(He can only smile.)

479
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,390
It is tasty, though.

480
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,299
- It's tasty.
- It's tasty, but...

481
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,529
- Everything we had so far was good.
- Yes.

482
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:13,900
- It's good, but...
- But...

483
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,099
How should I put it…

484
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,010
(He said it about 75 times.)

485
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,770
All the places we went to were really famous places,

486
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,140
and they were really popular among the Mexicans.

487
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,709
But why...

488
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:28,849
(But why...)

489
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:29,920
I mean...

490
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,450
Do you eat tacos regularly?

491
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,490
This is a really good place, right?

492
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:41,230
(He asks the local staff for help.)

493
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:42,800
Is there a place you usually go to?

494
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,600
Yes, I do.

495
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,500
Then you should have told us earlier.

496
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,800
You didn't ask me.

497
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,640
We didn't know.

498
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,809
(The staff members only film it and do not intervene.)

499
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:55,709
You should have told us.

500
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,380
If we're going in the wrong direction.

501
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,220
(The situation feels off.)

502
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:06,520
Let's just go and watch the wrestling match.

503
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:08,920
Let's go to the wrestling match.

504
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,690
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

505
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,660
How far away is the stadium?

506
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:16,960
- It takes 16 minutes.
- It's 16 minutes?

507
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,470
I think we'll be able to arrive right before the main match.

508
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,900
When we get there.

509
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,600
The weather is amazing, though.

510
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,270
It's not cold.

511
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,239
You can wear short or long sleeves.

512
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,240
Yes.

513
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,579
(The weather in Mexico City is just right for traveling.)

514
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,050
That's three buses.

515
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:36,549
Three buses are connected.

516
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:39,620
(It's only day one, and even the bus passing by looks interesting.)

517
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:41,450
- You're right.
- Gosh.

518
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,920
How do they make U-turns?

519
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,530
That must be why they have lots of rotaries here.

520
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,359
- You're right.
- You're right.

521
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,630
Since there are a lot of long cars.

522
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,500
Why do I feel out of breath?

523
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:59,909
Isn't it because of the altitude?

524
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:00,970
Is that so?

525
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,679
Woo Bin feels out of breath.

526
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,079
(Mexico City's altitude is higher than Mount Halla.)

527
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,480
It must be because of the altitude.

528
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,410
Yes, it's true.

529
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,919
- Is that so?
- Is it because you're full?

530
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,549
Is that so? Because of indigestion?

531
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:12,620
(A high altitude can make you feel out of breath and full.)

532
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,719
(Panting)

533
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,190
I really am out of breath.

534
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,390
Really?

535
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:23,260
I don't feel it yet.

536
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:27,870
(For the director, mountain sickness isn't the main issue.)

537
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,900
Are you quite disappointed?

538
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,499
- What?
- Are you quite disappointed?

539
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,040
(Are you quite disappointed that you couldn't find a good place?)

540
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,370
Me?

541
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,379
I really...

542
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:39,249
(It seems that he is quite disappointed.)

543
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:42,779
I really wanted to feel Mexico to the fullest...

544
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,550
as soon as I arrived,

545
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,190
but...

546
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,690
it's not quite hitting right.

547
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,489
But there's still a lot...

548
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,890
- ahead of us.
- Right.

549
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:57,260
Before we return to Korea,

550
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,100
I'm going to find that amazing taco.

551
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:03,099
I'm going to find it, no matter what it takes.

552
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,339
(I'm going to find it, no matter what it takes.)

553
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:08,209
(The director is serious about tacos.)

554
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:09,640
I hope that it's packed.

555
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,909
I know.

556
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:12,679
- I hope it's roaring with screams.
- Yes.

557
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,980
That's the reason...

558
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:18,949
That's what we saw on television when we were young.

559
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:19,990
Yes.

560
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:23,490
But even just by seeing this street,

561
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:26,430
I don't think that stadium will be packed.

562
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:29,700
But the people will be gathered there.

563
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:31,860
- They're all there?
- They say it's a festival.

564
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,969
Moon to the music

565
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:37,069
- Yes, that.
- Dance to the music

566
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,869
(They've been excited about it since they were in Seoul.)

567
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:40,970
It must be over there.

568
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,710
- There are a lot of people here.
- Something's going on here.

569
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:48,079
(They start seeing people once they're closer to the stadium.)

570
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,579
They're here on that...

571
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,350
- Package tours.
- They're here with tour guides...

572
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,620
and going to watch the match.

573
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,020
- Yes.
- That must be it.

574
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:57,060
This is a must-do, then.

575
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,060
It's a festival here.

576
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:03,660
- It's over there.
- Do you hear the sound?

577
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,400
People shouting.

578
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,099
I think I hear them as well.

579
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,469
Someone must have entered.

580
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:09,639
(Someone must have entered.)

581
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,900
He must have used a move.

582
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,540
(Sounds of shouting)

583
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:16,640
- Yes!
- It's like the World Cup.

584
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,949
Let's choose a team...

585
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,209
- and cheer for them.
- Let's do that.

586
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:22,350
There's a good team and a bad team.

587
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:23,519
Really?

588
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,380
- There's a villain?
- Yes.

589
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,650
That's fun.

590
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,190
- Gosh.
- The shouting is so loud.

591
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,820
They sell the masks here.

592
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,090
We need to buy masks.

593
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,630
They have a lot here.

594
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,129
We need to buy masks before going in.

595
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:39,369
There are so many people.

596
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:40,999
(Mexican professional wrestling is known for the colorful masks.)

597
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,299
(The streets are filled with all kinds of wrestling masks...)

598
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,209
(and different kinds of souvenirs.)

599
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:48,670
Gosh, it's a festival.

600
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,179
It's so interesting that...

601
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,680
only this place is packed.

602
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:56,919
- We need to buy masks.
- Forget it, just go.

603
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,549
They say we need masks to enter.

604
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:59,820
That's not true.

605
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,590
Let's buy some masks.

606
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,260
Get me one.

607
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,919
Are you sure you won't take it off?

608
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,189
I won't take it off.

609
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:07,889
Are you going to keep it on until we get to the hotel?

610
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:09,699
I'm going to keep it on during the match.

611
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,900
Let's get him one if he will wear it until we get to the hotel.

612
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,470
- What do you say?
- Sure.

613
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:14,669
Until we get to the hotel.

614
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:17,399
You have to keep it on until you get to your room.

615
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,869
No, this is just for the match.

616
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:20,010
No.

617
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:22,840
What about this, Kwang Soo?

618
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,350
This one is nice.

619
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,150
How much is this?

620
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:32,290
It's 700 pesos.

621
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,620
It's a professional one. It's 700.

622
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,660
- Is it 300?
- Yes, it's 700.

623
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:37,989
- How much is that?
- Let's go.

624
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,189
(They misunderstood.)

625
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:40,630
They are all...

626
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:42,089
It's 24 dollars or 25 dollars.

627
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:43,530
- Is it 25 dollars?
- Yes.

628
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,829
He says it's 25 dollars.

629
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:47,469
I thought it would be that expensive.

630
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,529
(Thinking)

631
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:49,600
But this is...

632
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,409
- Can't we spend 25 dollars?
- Kwang Soo.

633
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:54,109
We shared a can of soda.

634
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,610
What are you talking about?

635
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,380
When will we ever...

636
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,250
Do you think...

637
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:03,180
you'll ever come back to Mexico to watch wrestling?

638
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:07,149
I think we're here.

639
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,389
(He can't let it go.)

640
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:09,489
This must be it.

641
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:10,520
It's here.

642
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,059
Woo Bin.

643
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,260
Let's buy one.

644
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,400
That one, 25 dollars...

645
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,800
Should we ask this stall as well?

646
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,170
That one was pretty, though.

647
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,910
What about this red one?

648
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:31,540
(Kwang Soo chose a mask that looks obviously nice.)

649
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,410
It's 450 pesos.

650
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,150
- Is it 4?
- It's 450 pesos.

651
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:38,280
Four...

652
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:40,219
- Did you say 450?
- It's 450.

653
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,420
Is it 450 pesos?

654
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,220
Then it's even more expensive.

655
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,619
Is that so?

656
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,289
(The auditor doesn't want to waste any money.)

657
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:48,659
Let's buy this one.

658
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,160
- It's 33 dollars.
- Let's get this one.

659
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,159
This is 33 dollars. It's too expensive.

660
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,330
Let's buy that one.

661
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,439
(They came to watch wrestling, but the CEO is busy shopping.)

662
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,499
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes?

663
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,269
I will ask if they can lower the price a bit.

664
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,310
Okay.

665
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:03,939
(What do you think about his shopping?)

666
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,979
Why is he trying to buy that...

667
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,280
when we're here to watch a match?

668
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:11,579
(The main match is coming up soon.)

669
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,920
At this rate,

670
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,320
it's going to end.

671
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:16,860
I hope...

672
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:18,360
it ends and we miss it.

673
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,859
- While he's shopping?
- Yes.

674
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,959
(The director, who is a planner, does not like this at all.)

675
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,330
- Seriously.
- You seem quite upset.

676
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,770
- My friend.
- Hi.

677
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,970
Could you please give me a discount?

678
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,970
- Gosh, you know how to haggle?
- Yes.

679
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:34,310
It's 750.

680
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:36,280
- Sorry?
- It's 750.

681
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,780
- Is it 750?
- It's 750 pesos.

682
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:40,209
(They finally found out the truth about the price.)

683
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:41,650
- This?
- No.

684
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,620
Is it 650?

685
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:45,280
No. Too expensive.

686
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:47,219
- How much is it?
- It's 650 pesos.

687
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,820
It's 48 dollars.

688
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:52,290
What is the cheap one?

689
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:54,889
What is the cheap one? The cheapest one.

690
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:56,229
Low price.

691
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:57,399
(They go for the cheapest mask.)

692
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,270
This is 50 and 100.

693
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,099
Is it 100?

694
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,439
- This is 50 and 100.
- It's 50.

695
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,869
- Hey.
- Choose from the 50 ones.

696
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:06,670
How am I supposed to put this on?

697
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:10,610
Buy this one. It's just 50 pesos.

698
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,150
Kwang Soo!

699
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,610
- The quality is different.
- You just need the basic one.

700
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,979
- This is a monkey.
- Two minutes left.

701
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,519
- Kyung Soo.
- We have only two minutes left.

702
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,520
We can't go in if we don't buy the tickets now.

703
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:23,960
Really?

704
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:26,259
Kwang Soo, we have only two minutes. Let's go.

705
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:28,430
No, just buy me this one.

706
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:29,900
Buy me this one.

707
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:32,230
(Urgently)

708
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,700
I hope we don't get to go in.

709
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,540
I don't know. Just let it be. I don't need to watch.

710
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,040
I will be happier when that guy regrets it.

711
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:43,939
Come on, this is...

712
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:46,110
(He really can't let go of the red mask.)

713
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:47,710
It's not two minutes.

714
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,149
- Okay. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

715
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:54,219
(Fumbling around in disappointment)

716
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,490
He needs to feel that.

717
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,120
That's the only way he will learn.

718
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,929
No, get this one. This is it.

719
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:02,030
- This is...
- Thank you.

720
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,729
Hurry. Only two minutes left.

721
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:05,800
No, this is...

722
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:09,270
He asked for the cheapest one and got me this.

723
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,670
I'm 40 years old. This is...

724
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,740
There are...

725
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:18,940
There are better quality ones.

726
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,350
Isn't this hilarious?

727
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,290
Why did you get the monkey mask?

728
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:30,920
- You asked for it.
- It looks like origami paper.

729
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:34,289
(The mask is flimsy.)

730
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:36,529
- Hurry up and put it on.
- This is 100 pesos.

731
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:38,330
- Put it on before you enter.
- Seven dollars.

732
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,099
That one was 45 dollars.

733
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,830
(He was rushed to buy it, but he is not satisfied.)

734
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:46,710
This is for little girls.

735
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,879
- You need to...
- This is for little girls.

736
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,580
You need to untie it.

737
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:56,150
Push your chin in first.

738
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,650
That's it.

739
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,350
There you go.

740
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:03,289
- There you go.
- I can't breathe.

741
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:05,390
(It's cheap, so there is no breathing hole.)

742
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,690
Show me the back.

743
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,160
(It's getting good reactions.)

744
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,360
Just to save money?

745
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,170
Just go like this.

746
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:18,800
But it's not too bad.

747
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,510
They are selling the ones that the wrestlers wear.

748
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,950
What does this have to do with wrestling?

749
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:35,150
(Did you not like the monkey mask?)

750
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,260
My self-esteem dropped a bit.

751
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:42,130
If it was a bit...

752
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,930
(How should I say this...)

753
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,400
Even that little kid...

754
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,499
is wearing the 45-dollar one.

755
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,610
That little kid.

756
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,310
Gosh.

757
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:01,950
Even that little kid has a better mask than mine.

758
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:09,560
(He is jealous of the little kid.)

759
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,720
What's going on?

760
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,760
- What did they say?
- This is...

761
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,930
- There's a 23-dollar seat, - Yes.

762
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,400
and a 31-dollar seat.

763
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,569
- I can't breathe.
- I'll get the 23-dollar seat.

764
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:23,599
The cheap one.

765
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,769
- Okay.
- Let's get the expensive one.

766
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:26,009
Let's watch from a closer place.

767
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:27,069
No.

768
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:28,410
We can save tomorrow.

769
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:29,879
Three hundred.

770
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,680
Get the expensive seat for me.

771
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:35,350
I have the biggest share, so get me the expensive seat.

772
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,919
- I can't see if it's too far.
- This is also the front row.

773
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,119
It's no fun if it's too far.

774
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,390
You're too scary. Don't look at me when you speak.

775
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,319
It's no fun if it's too far.

776
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,130
Then, should we get the closest seats?

777
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:47,790
Yes.

778
00:31:47,791 --> 00:31:50,459
We're 3 people. We will take the 27-dollar seats.

779
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,530
- Okay?
- Yes.

780
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,630
It's 810 dollars, please.

781
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:55,829
I can't see at all.

782
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:58,040
I can't believe I'm watching a professional wrestling match.

783
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,370
Thank you.

784
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,779
(They managed to get tickets safely...)

785
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,480
(with just 2 minutes before closing.)

786
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:07,910
(Arena Mexico)

787
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,010
- Tickets?
- Here.

788
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,980
- We are three.
- Okay.

789
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:13,419
Show your tickets to the ticket person.

790
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,550
Okay.

791
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:15,849
Mask off.

792
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,720
(She checks the face of Mask Boy.)

793
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,060
(They enter after a brief inspection.)

794
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:22,660
This is going to be so much fun.

795
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:24,299
- We need to hurry.
- If someone on your side...

796
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,529
- If one person...
- They're coming out.

797
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:27,000
We need to go in.

798
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,400
That's amazing.

799
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:33,070
Gosh. It's so amazing.

800
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:38,180
Everyone has the good masks.

801
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:39,979
I'm the only one...

802
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,379
(Monkey Mask got offended.)

803
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,520
That's what makes you special.

804
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,849
- Gosh, there are so many people.
- Gosh.

805
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:48,419
- My goodness.
- Gosh, that's amazing.

806
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,960
(What will the wrestling arena look like?)

807
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:52,589
- Gosh, there are so many people.
- Gosh.

808
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:55,359
- My goodness.
- Gosh, that's amazing.

809
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,830
(What will the wrestling arena look like?)

810
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:01,899
(It is full of energy, even on a Tuesday night!)

811
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,140
This is so cool.

812
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:04,899
Amazing.

813
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,170
(It is packed with loud cheers, proving it to be a national sport.)

814
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,240
That's amazing. It's so cool.

815
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:14,050
(Mexican traditional professional wrestling, lucha libre)

816
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,509
Our seats are amazing.

817
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:19,019
(They sit down to watch.)

818
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:23,690
(Wrestlers with extraordinary auras make their entrance.)

819
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,690
(Screaming)

820
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:35,530
(They warm up before the match.)

821
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:38,670
They really have the bodies that we saw on television.

822
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:43,180
(What?)

823
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:53,089
(The CEO became a local seconds after entering.)

824
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:55,750
(The match begins.)

825
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:58,020
The mask...

826
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:00,290
It's mask versus no mask.

827
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:06,099
This team is the villain,

828
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,229
and that team must be...

829
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,540
(Mask: Team Hero, No mask: Team Villain)

830
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:12,770
- They must be tagging.
- Yes, they tag.

831
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,539
(Tag team match: A one-on-one match...)

832
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,909
(where teammates tag each other to switch in and out)

833
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:17,510
Their bodies are amazing.

834
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,409
Aren't they so close?

835
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:21,850
This is so cool.

836
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:25,350
(Everything is new to Woo Bin's eyes.)

837
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,689
(The red mask appears.)

838
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:29,960
Iron Man!

839
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:34,659
(Screaming)

840
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:38,160
(Overjoyed)

841
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,640
- That's a foul.
- That's a foul.

842
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,999
(Booing)

843
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,039
(Everyone jeers.)

844
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,780
(Quiet)

845
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:54,550
(But Team Hero won't just let it happen.)

846
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:59,749
(Striking back with a Hurricanrana, which is a wrestling technique)

847
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:03,160
(Iron Man dominates in a second.)

848
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:06,560
(These are staged techniques by professionals, so don't follow.)

849
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:09,389
They rehearse that, right?

850
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:10,400
(Nodding)

851
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:12,300
But watching this live,

852
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,170
it looks so real.

853
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:16,569
- What?
- It looks so real.

854
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:18,870
We have to watch until the end, but this is a must.

855
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,969
This is a must, for sure.

856
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:23,310
- It makes your hands sweaty.
- This is amazing.

857
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:26,480
Everyone in this arena is united.

858
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:30,349
And it's not a big difference, so get the best seats.

859
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:31,749
- Yes.
- Yes.

860
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:33,390
The seats are important.

861
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:37,520
This must be why people love it.

862
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:40,860
And the mask is like your class.

863
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,100
- You need to get the good masks.
- Yes.

864
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:47,500
(The villain tries to counterattack.)

865
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:53,910
(Just watching it makes them feel the pain.)

866
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:03,120
(The villains keep attacking, breaking the rules.)

867
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:09,290
(But that doesn't matter to the heroes.)

868
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:10,789
Gosh, amazing.

869
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:14,030
(In awe)

870
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:19,400
(They absolutely crushed it.)

871
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,339
- Chop.
- Is that a chop?

872
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,700
(They recognize the move.)

873
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,710
- What?
- What? On the rope?

874
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,979
(The attack performances get even flashier.)

875
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,649
The neck...

876
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:35,880
(It's fun to watch the lucha libre.)

877
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:41,089
(They keep fighting even after exiting the ring.)

878
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:42,720
- Gosh.
- Oh, no.

879
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:47,159
(Dopamine explosion)

880
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,530
(Then, the villains try to attack.)

881
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,399
What?

882
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,070
(Shouting)

883
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:58,400
(He was thrown at the spectator seats.)

884
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:03,309
(As if under a spell, Kwang Soo reaches out to the player.)

885
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:06,009
(Laughing)

886
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:07,850
The villains won in an instant.

887
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:10,849
Gosh, this is amazing.

888
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:12,420
(The villains begin retaliating.)

889
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:15,889
- Gosh, no way.
- No!

890
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:18,020
- No!
- No!

891
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:19,730
No!

892
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:25,029
(Shared pain)

893
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:26,500
Just kill me instead.

894
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:32,170
(Iron Man steps into the ring to avenge his friend.)

895
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:36,409
(He got slapped 1 second into his entrance without fighting back.)

896
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:37,579
That's just...

897
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,340
He just hit him for real.

898
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,949
(This time, it's a ruthless 1-on-3 attack.)

899
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,820
(Snapping)

900
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,119
No!

901
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,849
(Team Hero is losing.)

902
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,520
(Shouting)

903
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:56,190
(Imitating their shouts right away)

904
00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:00,069
(With everyone cheering for him,)

905
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:03,200
(the hero is back on his feet.)

906
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,680
(He takes down all the villains with a triple backbreaker.)

907
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:20,690
(The finishing blow)

908
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,720
- Gosh.
- One, two, three!

909
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:30,460
(The match ends with Blue Mask's brilliant play.)

910
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:39,470
(Team Hero won.)

911
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:49,820
(The first match ended amid loud cheers.)

912
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,480
Look at the wound on his chest.

913
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:58,559
(How do they feel after watching a lucha libre match live?)

914
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,490
It was a childhood dream of mine.

915
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:03,860
Watching pro wrestling in person has been my dream.

916
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:09,570
Personally, this was the best moment in Mexico so far.

917
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,240
Every moment has been great,

918
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:15,140
but this one is my favorite.

919
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:23,319
(All that's left now is the final event.)

920
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:27,090
(A new fighter appears.)

921
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:28,650
The champion!

922
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:32,090
They're impressive.

923
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:37,860
(The main event)

924
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,569
(Cheering)

925
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:49,310
(As befits the main event, the match is heating up.)

926
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:53,850
(The crowd is at a fever pitch.)

927
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,180
(Meanwhile, Kyung Soo is dozing off.)

928
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:09,259
(A loud noise woke him up,)

929
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:13,999
(but his eyelids soon grew heavy again.)

930
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,969
Get up!

931
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:18,339
(Get up!)

932
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:20,339
Get up, Mexican Panties!

933
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:23,179
(Kwang Soo is screaming and yelling right next to him,)

934
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:25,640
(but the noise is like a lullaby for Kyung Soo.)

935
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:30,950
(Eventually, his head fell.)

936
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,919
Are you sleepy?

937
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,950
I'm so sleepy.

938
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:38,119
(The three have been...)

939
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,930
(awake for 32 hours straight.)

940
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:43,530
He's secretly praying for this to be over soon.

941
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:48,399
(Please be over.)

942
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,770
(The match finally seems to be nearing the end.)

943
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,240
Just pass out already. This fight's gone on long enough.

944
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,040
Just pass out.

945
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:59,379
(Kyung Soo has reached his limit.)

946
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:01,580
Can someone just lose so this can be over?

947
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,110
He fell asleep earlier.

948
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,050
I'm so sleepy.

949
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:13,929
(Kwang Soo and Woo Bin are sleepy too.)

950
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:18,900
(The match shows no sign of ending.)

951
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:20,900
This is the last match, so we have to leave quickly.

952
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,570
Should we just leave now?

953
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:24,670
I think it's over.

954
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:26,269
(Kyung Soo wants to go home now.)

955
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:27,609
We'll leave as soon as the referee gives the three-count.

956
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,209
As soon as he gives the three-count.

957
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:31,939
(Black Pants' performance continues.)

958
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,140
It's over.

959
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,680
It's over.

960
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:38,449
(It's not over.)

961
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:41,290
(Please stop.)

962
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:44,760
It's over.

963
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:49,489
(The countdown begins.)

964
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:54,099
(The game is finally over!)

965
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,530
Hurry! We have to get out of here.

966
00:41:56,970 --> 00:42:00,210
(Thanks to you, we get to leave.)

967
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:01,339
That was great.

968
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,580
That was the best thing we saw all day.

969
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:05,139
- It was fun.
- That was...

970
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:07,550
- That was the best thing ever.
- It was the best.

971
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:08,780
Go right.

972
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:10,680
The people are coming out.

973
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,179
Run!

974
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,319
It was smart of us to leave early.

975
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,690
(You were practically asleep. How are you feeling?)

976
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,860
I'm sleepy.

977
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,260
You had your eyes closed.

978
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:20,860
I dozed off.

979
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:22,990
I was so sleepy during the game.

980
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,530
I wanted to leave...

981
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:29,470
after one match.

982
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:32,470
But I had fun.

983
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:34,970
Kwang Soo seemed really excited.

984
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:38,580
He always enjoys things like that.

985
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:41,580
When I was a kid,

986
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:43,579
pro wrestling was on Channel Two.

987
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:45,379
The broadcast wasn't very clear...

988
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:46,620
because it used the American feed.

989
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:50,060
Still, I always tried to keep up...

990
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:52,390
and watch...

991
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,729
pro wrestling on TV.

992
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:55,959
But today, I got to see it in person...

993
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,530
from a premium seat,

994
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,260
with a mask on.

995
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,140
In a way, this was a moment...

996
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:06,040
where my childhood dream...

997
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:08,910
came true.

998
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,280
You have to come here if you ever travel to Mexico.

999
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:16,950
Even if you're not familiar with pro wrestling,

1000
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:20,350
you have to come here and feel this energy for yourself.

1001
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:22,190
This is Mexico.

1002
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:26,859
(At night, they finally got a real sense of Mexico.)

1003
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:30,099
(Cheering)

1004
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,100
Let's go.

1005
00:43:31,101 --> 00:43:37,640
(The very long, busy day finally came to a close.)

1006
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:44,110
(At last, home sweet home.)

1007
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,350
Wait, where did I put the receipts earlier?

1008
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:50,850
I put them all together somewhere.

1009
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,479
It's not in there?

1010
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,590
(The stack of receipts is nowhere to be seen.)

1011
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:55,890
What time tomorrow...

1012
00:43:56,490 --> 00:43:59,259
will you be waking up for breakfast?

1013
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:01,830
Tell us when you'll be starting your day.

1014
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,629
That's not important right now.

1015
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:04,699
The receipts.

1016
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,559
Where is it? The ziplock bag...

1017
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,999
- with all the receipts?
- Gosh.

1018
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
(The auditor is serious.)

1019
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,470
(The receipts aren't in his bag.)

1020
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,310
(He even checks the bathroom.)

1021
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,640
(He seems to be going through the trash.)

1022
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,120
(He checks the other bathroom.)

1023
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:28,590
What time should we wake up?

1024
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:31,690
(The CEO is exhausted.)

1025
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,429
What time should we wake up tomorrow?

1026
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:35,260
You didn't throw anything out, right?

1027
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,160
(The auditor is fixated on finding the receipts.)

1028
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,230
I wouldn't have put them in my pocket.

1029
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:42,570
This is bad.

1030
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:50,280
(Whatever)

1031
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:54,410
I even wrote on the bag.

1032
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:56,950
That...

1033
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,579
The... Where...

1034
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:01,590
(Whatever)

1035
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:05,220
(He had been wandering around alone, in search of the receipts.)

1036
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,590
I found it.

1037
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,259
- Where was it?
- In the pocket...

1038
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:10,830
of the pants I wore earlier.

1039
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,830
Thank goodness.

1040
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:17,470
You go wash up. I've got work to do.

1041
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:21,040
(He's relieved to be able to fulfill his responsibility.)

1042
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:25,810
(GBRB: Joy Pops Laugh Pops)

1043
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:29,150
(After finishing up the first day of the expedition,)

1044
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:32,620
(the CEO begins planning tomorrow's schedule.)

1045
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:34,590
People really recommend going ziplining.

1046
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:36,650
They say the fireworks festival is beautiful, too.

1047
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:39,190
Apparently, there's a desert we can visit.

1048
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:40,760
(The CEO is busily searching online.)

1049
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:43,629
The Chapultepec Castle...

1050
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:44,960
How would we get there?

1051
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:47,470
- What?
- The Chapultepec Castle.

1052
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,669
(This doesn't seem like the first time...)

1053
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:52,300
(the CEO held his face out for a sheet mask.)

1054
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:55,240
(He made sure the sheet covers Kwang Soo's face down to the chin.)

1055
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:59,210
(The CEO gets back to work.)

1056
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,409
(Looking for places to go)

1057
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:02,709
(Looking for tacos to try)

1058
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:05,650
(While the Skin-care Brothers planned for tomorrow,)

1059
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:09,350
(Woo Bin finished washing up.)

1060
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:11,560
Kwang Soo, which hairstyle looked better on me?

1061
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,460
Down, like at the airport?

1062
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:17,330
Or pushed back with my sunglasses?

1063
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,229
Wear it down tomorrow.

1064
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:20,330
Wear it down tomorrow?

1065
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:21,569
(Even when he's tired, Woo Bin wants to look his best.)

1066
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:23,400
- You look good with your hair down.
- You think so?

1067
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,540
Do you think so too, Kyung Soo?

1068
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,180
- What?
- Do you think so too?

1069
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:33,439
- Your hair for tomorrow?
- Which is better?

1070
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,450
(Woo Bin comes to the bathroom, realizing Kyung Soo can't hear him.)

1071
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:36,150
Which is better?

1072
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:37,849
(Woo Bin is demonstrating the two options for Kyung soo.)

1073
00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:40,890
If you walk around like this, this could...

1074
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:46,090
What color should I wear tomorrow?

1075
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:49,090
(Woo Bin spent a long time preparing to look good for the camera.)

1076
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:51,030
Let's do this.

1077
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,730
The two winners will shower first...

1078
00:46:54,170 --> 00:46:55,600
and the loser has to wait and shower later.

1079
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:57,200
We can just take turns.

1080
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,200
What?

1081
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:01,139
(Kwang Soo is annoyed by Woo Bin's indifference.)

1082
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:02,809
What is it that you want?

1083
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:04,339
Let's do that then.

1084
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:06,310
- The things you brought.
- Yes, let's use that.

1085
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:07,850
Over here.

1086
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:09,950
The loser has to film this and choose his slime toy last.

1087
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,420
Put them all down. Don't touch them.

1088
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:15,790
Do I go first?

1089
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:19,090
What we did earlier.

1090
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:23,190
Gosh.

1091
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,200
Who's next?

1092
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,200
(This is his second time getting 0.)

1093
00:47:26,530 --> 00:47:28,030
(Woo Bin chooses Kwang Soo to go next.)

1094
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:30,000
You almost poked my eye.

1095
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:33,610
It's 3 and 5. So it's 15.

1096
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,710
(It's Kyung Soo's turn.)

1097
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:37,640
- It's five.
- Please.

1098
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:39,680
- Okay. You pick one.
- It's eight.

1099
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:42,909
(They each choose their slime toy.)

1100
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:44,720
Yes, I wanted this one.

1101
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:47,420
Seriously...

1102
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:48,750
We're throwing them at the same time.

1103
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:50,660
- All three at the same time?
- Yes.

1104
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:53,860
- Wait.
- So once these are thrown,

1105
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:56,460
if they're stuck somewhere else, you still lose, right?

1106
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,299
As long as they don't fall to the floor, you're fine.

1107
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:00,729
You've had practice, though.

1108
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:01,799
- You too.
- No, I haven't.

1109
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,229
This is my first time ever throwing one of these.

1110
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:04,270
Me too.

1111
00:48:04,370 --> 00:48:05,539
- You threw it earlier.
- This is new.

1112
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:06,600
When did I do that?

1113
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:08,439
- This is new.
- Kyung Soo, I saw you throw one.

1114
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:09,540
I tried sticking it like this.

1115
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,909
Since Kyung Soo had practice, we should practice once too.

1116
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:13,139
No. That's not fair.

1117
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,079
Why did you throw it? Why are you lying about it?

1118
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,879
- No, I just stuck it on the wall.
- Why did you lie?

1119
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,679
- We'll each do it once.
- Tell the camera.

1120
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:20,490
Did you throw it or not?

1121
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:21,590
I put it on the wall.

1122
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:23,690
I really didn't throw it.

1123
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:25,160
- Really?
- Really.

1124
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:27,229
(Woo Bin is speechless.)

1125
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:29,930
You must have thrown one at least once after buying them.

1126
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:31,499
I just stuck it on the wall too.

1127
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,530
(I just stuck it on the wall too.)

1128
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:34,869
Let me try it too then.

1129
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:36,729
- Sticking it on the wall is fine.
- I'll stick it on the wall too.

1130
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:37,740
I'll stick it on the wall too.

1131
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,209
- What?
- Your hand.

1132
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:42,869
- You have to let go.
- Like this?

1133
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:44,240
- Yes.
- What?

1134
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:45,580
Just let go.

1135
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:48,180
But it's not working. It's not sticking to the wall.

1136
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,209
It's not even sticky.

1137
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:51,849
- How did you stick it to the wall?
- Just try it.

1138
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:53,519
- It sticks.
- It's not sticking.

1139
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,349
- Just throw it then.
- You have to do this.

1140
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:57,560
- Do what?
- Like this.

1141
00:48:57,890 --> 00:48:59,389
- You brat...
- Try this.

1142
00:48:59,390 --> 00:49:00,530
(I can't believe you.)

1143
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:01,829
Try this.

1144
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:03,490
(Woo Bin punished Kyung Soo.)

1145
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:05,000
There's nothing you can do about it.

1146
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,600
- What?
- It's your fate.

1147
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:09,169
- All right, let go. One...
- This isn't...

1148
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:11,299
- This isn't designed to work.
- See? It's stuck.

1149
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:12,300
(It's stuck?)

1150
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,539
- That's how it works.
- Right. It's actually lasting long.

1151
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:16,139
- You're still safe.
- I'm still safe.

1152
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:18,539
- It didn't land on the floor.
- You're still safe.

1153
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:20,240
It has to touch the floor for you to lose.

1154
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:22,850
I don't think it will come off.

1155
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:25,150
I'll do it. Don't touch mine.

1156
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:28,050
(Handling with care)

1157
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:30,090
Even if it breaks, you still have to use it.

1158
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:33,420
Okay.

1159
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:35,329
- I know you threw it.
- If you don't play...

1160
00:49:35,330 --> 00:49:37,660
If you don't play, you lose. Rock, paper, scissors.

1161
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:38,960
- Rock, paper, scissors.
- What's that?

1162
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,630
- Rock, paper, scissors.
- I played.

1163
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:45,100
(Kwang Soo insists that his pointing finger is scissors.)

1164
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:47,169
- What?
- You're such a scammer.

1165
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:49,110
- You're such a scammer.
- What? What's this then?

1166
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:51,679
Don't go past this point.

1167
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,009
Why would you say that now?

1168
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:55,179
- I told you earlier too.
- Then do we sit here and throw?

1169
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:57,249
No. Stand next to the bed.

1170
00:49:57,250 --> 00:49:58,250
- Throw it from here?
- Yes.

1171
00:49:58,251 --> 00:50:00,489
- That's so unfair.
- It won't even stick.

1172
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:01,620
Look.

1173
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,220
There's no space here at all.

1174
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:05,790
(The area is full of Kwang Soo's bags.)

1175
00:50:05,791 --> 00:50:08,060
There's nothing we can do about that.

1176
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,630
- Where am I supposed to stand?
- Here.

1177
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,659
- By the bag.
- Stand on one foot.

1178
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:13,899
Here? I'll throw it from here.

1179
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:16,030
No. You can't stand past this point.

1180
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,370
Gosh.

1181
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,240
Move back.

1182
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:22,239
There's nowhere for me to stand here.

1183
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,339
- Look.
- Don't step on my things.

1184
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:25,740
I hate that.

1185
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:28,809
Then I'll stand over there, since I'm second.

1186
00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:30,519
- That's fine.
- You stand over here, Kwang Soo.

1187
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:31,579
We already decided where we'll stand.

1188
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:33,450
No, we didn't. He did.

1189
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:36,520
(Being last feels so unfair.)

1190
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:39,560
(Screaming)

1191
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:43,630
(An effect of the lucha libre experience)

1192
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:45,900
- We'll count to three and throw.
- Wait.

1193
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:47,099
All right.

1194
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:48,299
(This slime toy game will decide who showers first.)

1195
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:49,700
All right. One, two, three.

1196
00:50:53,070 --> 00:50:54,309
What happened?

1197
00:50:54,310 --> 00:50:56,740
- Move it.
- Move it.

1198
00:50:57,610 --> 00:50:59,740
(Woo Bin's slime toy is safe.)

1199
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:02,609
- What if none of them fall?
- If they stay stuck like this...

1200
00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:05,120
If they stay stuck like this, whoever's lowest loses.

1201
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:07,649
- No. Why are you suddenly...
- Why not?

1202
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:09,790
- Why are you making up rules?
- That's obvious, though.

1203
00:51:09,850 --> 00:51:11,789
You can't just make up new rules after we've already thrown the toys.

1204
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:12,860
Fine.

1205
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:15,230
You're suddenly...

1206
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:16,760
(Forced to silence)

1207
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:18,700
I don't think they'll fall off.

1208
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:21,129
I don't think we should do this here.

1209
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:22,330
- This is...
- Let's do a rematch.

1210
00:51:24,270 --> 00:51:25,400
Let's do it here.

1211
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:28,710
(They do a rematch on the mirror.)

1212
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:32,740
All right. One, two, three.

1213
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:34,550
Okay.

1214
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:37,249
- Last place.
- Last place.

1215
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:38,450
(Woo Bin)

1216
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:40,790
(Kyung Soo, Kwang Soo)

1217
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:42,619
- This is invalid.
- They probably won't separate.

1218
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:44,789
- It's invalid.
- But this one's last place anyway.

1219
00:51:44,790 --> 00:51:45,920
Why? That's not fair.

1220
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,529
This entire match should be nullified.

1221
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:49,590
The two of us will do a rematch.

1222
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:51,799
You wait for the outcome.

1223
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,059
(Woo Bin is confirmed as last place.)

1224
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:54,170
This is so upsetting.

1225
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:55,529
- What?
- What are you doing?

1226
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:56,930
Gosh, why... Hey!

1227
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,340
This is...

1228
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:02,940
This arm is stretched out.

1229
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:05,640
- Mine is cut off.
- Mine broke in the middle.

1230
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:08,749
- Why is mine...
- What happened to the middle?

1231
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:10,350
Why did you pull mine?

1232
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:12,319
This is...

1233
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:13,519
Mine is stretched.

1234
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,189
We have to do the rematch now.

1235
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:16,519
- What am I going to do about this?
- We have to do the rematch.

1236
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:17,859
(The nerve-racking final match)

1237
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:20,220
All right. One, two, three.

1238
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:24,660
- Please.
- Okay.

1239
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:27,299
(Kwang Soo is in 1st place.)

1240
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:28,930
Even better.

1241
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:30,370
What was that?

1242
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:32,700
- It came to me.
- How did you do that?

1243
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:35,210
- How did you do that?
- It's so scary.

1244
00:52:35,970 --> 00:52:37,109
How did you do that?

1245
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:38,739
(The toy he threw at the window landed on Woo Bin's hand.)

1246
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:40,979
- Do you know this scene?
- How did it go from here to...

1247
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:42,910
On "Infinite Challenge," how Junjin...

1248
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:45,720
It took a lap and ended up here.

1249
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:47,550
- I was so startled.
- How did it end up here?

1250
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:49,149
He threw it this way, but it landed here.

1251
00:52:49,150 --> 00:52:51,019
Do you know what's even scarier?

1252
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:52,789
It slid down my shoulder.

1253
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:55,090
(The game ended with a mystery.)

1254
00:52:55,530 --> 00:52:57,260
I'll wake up at 9:40am.

1255
00:52:58,700 --> 00:52:59,929
How is that possible?

1256
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:02,569
I'm serious. That's how long it takes for me to get ready.

1257
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:03,869
- How does that make sense?
- I can...

1258
00:53:03,870 --> 00:53:05,770
- wake up at 9:40am.
- Are you serious?

1259
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,370
Have some manners.

1260
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,909
- No, I'll...
- Do you think that's okay?

1261
00:53:08,910 --> 00:53:10,069
I'll put my clothes out,

1262
00:53:10,070 --> 00:53:12,610
brush my teeth, wash my face and hair, and leave.

1263
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:15,010
I'm the first.

1264
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:17,320
I'm the first and you're also the first.

1265
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:18,920
- And Woo Bin is last?
- Yes.

1266
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:20,750
What time are you going to wake up then?

1267
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:22,990
There are two bathrooms anyway.

1268
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:26,720
- You have to wake up when I do.
- Right.

1269
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:28,159
What?

1270
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,789
You have to give me enough to wash up too.

1271
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:30,830
I'll wake up at 9:25am.

1272
00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:32,659
But since you're also getting ready first,

1273
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:33,729
you have to wake up with me.

1274
00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:35,800
No, Kwang Soo. I need an hour.

1275
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:37,469
- To get ready?
- So you have to...

1276
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:38,670
wake up an hour and a half earlier.

1277
00:53:40,070 --> 00:53:42,409
- But we're...
- Okay. We'll get ready and leave,

1278
00:53:42,410 --> 00:53:44,240
- Yes.
- and you join us once you're done.

1279
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:48,049
- What?
- What do you mean?

1280
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:49,479
Why are you so irresponsible?

1281
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:50,819
What do you want me to do?

1282
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:52,319
I'll get ready last.

1283
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:53,879
I won first place, so I get to do what I want.

1284
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,219
Yes, you can do what you want,

1285
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:57,220
but you should give me an hour.

1286
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,959
- Right.
- So you wake up an hour earlier...

1287
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,560
Whatever. You guys decide then.

1288
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:03,030
He's so...

1289
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:06,460
Anyway, for tomorrow,

1290
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,170
I found a taco place...

1291
00:54:10,270 --> 00:54:11,970
we could go to.

1292
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,770
Do we have to have tacos?

1293
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:16,310
What else?

1294
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:18,280
We have to succeed.

1295
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:19,610
We have to succeed.

1296
00:54:19,810 --> 00:54:21,550
We can space them out.

1297
00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:23,350
- What?
- We can space them out.

1298
00:54:23,810 --> 00:54:26,079
We do. We space out lunch and dinner.

1299
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,820
No, not lunch and dinner.

1300
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:29,749
We had tacos today. We can eat them again the day after tomorrow.

1301
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:31,160
(After just one day, Kwang Soo is already sick of tacos.)

1302
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:33,620
Why do I have to keep eating tacos?

1303
00:54:34,330 --> 00:54:35,330
Why do I have to do that?

1304
00:54:35,331 --> 00:54:37,960
(Kwang Soo is upset with TacoPing.)

1305
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,760
I don't want to eat tacos anymore.

1306
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:42,600
Tomorrow's tacos will be good.

1307
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:44,600
Today's tacos were good too.

1308
00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:46,269
I've just had enough of them.

1309
00:54:46,270 --> 00:54:47,440
No matter how good something is...

1310
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:50,540
- What do you want to eat, then?
- Let's go eat that.

1311
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:53,340
Kimchi jjigae.

1312
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:56,250
(Eating kimchi jjigae is a must when traveling abroad.)

1313
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:57,920
We just got here yesterday.

1314
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:00,550
I really want kimchi jjigae.

1315
00:55:00,890 --> 00:55:02,320
Let's play the game one more time.

1316
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:04,390
I'm craving kimchi jjigae.

1317
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:06,320
I'm craving kimchi jjigae.

1318
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:07,789
I don't care if we're in Mexico.

1319
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:09,330
I'm craving kimchi jjigae right now.

1320
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:13,899
(Kwang Soo expresses his heartfelt frustration.)

1321
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:15,370
Gosh.

1322
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,369
(It's time for bed now.)

1323
00:55:18,370 --> 00:55:19,400
I'm going to sleep.

1324
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,040
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

1325
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:23,669
(Looking for taco places)

1326
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:25,809
(They each wrap up the day in their own way.)

1327
00:55:25,810 --> 00:55:27,750
(Reading the expedition book, writing in his gratitude journal)

1328
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:35,519
(Engine sound)

1329
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:36,549
(Laughing)

1330
00:55:36,550 --> 00:55:37,920
The windows are closed, right?

1331
00:55:39,890 --> 00:55:41,930
For a second, I thought I was in the car.

1332
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:46,129
- Good job, today.
- Good job, today.

1333
00:55:46,130 --> 00:55:48,600
(After exchanging comforting words, Woo Bin falls asleep.)

1334
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:50,529
(Kwang Soo turns off the light for Kyung Soo,)

1335
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:51,800
(who fell asleep while searching for taco restaurants.)

1336
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,210
(After all that, only then does Kwang Soo go to sleep.)

1337
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,940
(The expedition's first night comes to an end.)

1338
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:02,880
(Current time: 8am)

1339
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:08,189
(Panting)

1340
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:09,190
(Grunting)

1341
00:56:15,090 --> 00:56:16,330
Do you do this every morning?

1342
00:56:16,390 --> 00:56:17,390
Yes.

1343
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:18,760
I just looked in the mirror.

1344
00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:21,530
You're working out while I'm just standing here,

1345
00:56:22,970 --> 00:56:25,240
and I just look so pathetic, all of a sudden.

1346
00:56:26,370 --> 00:56:27,840
You're taking care of yourself.

1347
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:33,380
(After finishing an intense 30-minute workout,)

1348
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:38,080
(Woo Bin carries chicken juice in one hand...)

1349
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:42,120
(as he brings in the shoes he left to dry by the window yesterday.)

1350
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:46,060
I spent an hour and a half looking for somewhere to eat.

1351
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:48,090
Not tacos.

1352
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,729
Food that we can't get anywhere else.

1353
00:56:50,730 --> 00:56:51,900
(Kyung Soo, who woke up first, looked for a good restaurant.)

1354
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,869
Food that even Koreans enjoy.

1355
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:56,400
What is it? What's the dish?

1356
00:56:56,670 --> 00:56:57,970
There's a tortilla at the bottom...

1357
00:56:58,800 --> 00:56:59,940
and eggs on top of it.

1358
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:01,209
Apparently, this is really good.

1359
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:03,009
Why don't we try this?

1360
00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:04,239
(Director Kyung Soo's briefing on breakfast)

1361
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,809
Woo Bin, are you okay with leaving at 9am?

1362
00:57:05,810 --> 00:57:06,909
In an hour?

1363
00:57:06,910 --> 00:57:09,350
(They decide to move an hour early to visit the restaurant.)

1364
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:10,820
Breakfast...

1365
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:13,379
We were up already.

1366
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:14,490
So...

1367
00:57:14,590 --> 00:57:16,720
And Doh Kyung Soo...

1368
00:57:16,990 --> 00:57:19,020
spent an hour and a half...

1369
00:57:19,090 --> 00:57:20,959
to look for what to eat.

1370
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,989
Since he entered his room last night and until this morning,

1371
00:57:22,990 --> 00:57:24,330
all he did was look for a restaurant.

1372
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:26,800
He kept talking about tacos.

1373
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,170
Tacos.

1374
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:31,340
You don't eat kimchi jjigae for two days in a row.

1375
00:57:32,070 --> 00:57:34,000
We had tacos for all three meals yesterday.

1376
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:35,810
It's like he's crazy about tacos.

1377
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:41,510
(The director has became a taco freak.)

1378
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:43,849
This morning, I told the coordinator,

1379
00:57:43,850 --> 00:57:45,749
"Kyung Soo wants to go here."

1380
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:47,750
"How is this place?"

1381
00:57:47,890 --> 00:57:48,919
The coordinator said,

1382
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:50,690
"Why does he keep finding a place like that?"

1383
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:53,360
(The restaurants even the local coordinator finds difficult)

1384
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:55,529
We're in Mexico. We might as well enjoy Mexico.

1385
00:57:55,530 --> 00:57:56,929
I was like, "What's wrong with that?"

1386
00:57:56,930 --> 00:57:59,029
It's a real Mexican restaurant...

1387
00:57:59,030 --> 00:58:00,630
that only Mexicans go to.

1388
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:02,699
- I hear there's a line.
- Really?

1389
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:04,029
If we don't get there by 8am, there's a line.

1390
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:06,399
It's very popular among the locals.

1391
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,009
When I showed her, she was like...

1392
00:58:08,010 --> 00:58:09,710
- It's here.
- The taxi is here.

1393
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:10,840
It's nice...

1394
00:58:10,841 --> 00:58:12,909
- to start a day with breakfast.
- It's nice.

1395
00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:14,710
- It's nice to start the day early.
- Yes.

1396
00:58:15,310 --> 00:58:17,749
- I hope the line isn't long.
- Right.

1397
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:19,019
Be there by noon?

1398
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:20,319
It only opens until noon.

1399
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:22,620
- We can only eat this now.
- Yes.

1400
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:24,860
After we eat here,

1401
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:26,960
we're going to...

1402
00:58:27,590 --> 00:58:28,889
a churro place.

1403
00:58:28,890 --> 00:58:29,989
Nice.

1404
00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:32,529
- Do they sell coffee?
- They have coffee.

1405
00:58:32,530 --> 00:58:34,469
I hear their hot chocolate is famous.

1406
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:36,469
- That's what Kwang Soo likes.
- That sounds tasty.

1407
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:38,339
I want to try the churro too.

1408
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:39,600
I love it. It's perfect.

1409
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,540
Let's go to the marketplace after that.

1410
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,940
Let's go back to the old days...

1411
00:58:44,610 --> 00:58:46,479
- and get friendship bracelets.
- Good idea.

1412
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,310
- I like that idea.
- Right?

1413
00:58:49,110 --> 00:58:50,210
All the same bracelets.

1414
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,579
(They reached the restaurant.)

1415
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:54,919
- It's here.
- Thank you.

1416
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:56,120
It's crowded.

1417
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:57,859
Even at this hour?

1418
00:58:57,860 --> 00:59:02,160
(People wait in line in the morning.)

1419
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:06,799
- It's full of locals.
- Yes.

1420
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:07,899
It's crowded.

1421
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:09,469
It must be popular.

1422
00:59:09,470 --> 00:59:12,240
(The popular local breakfast restaurant)

1423
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,469
- What do you think?
- I like it.

1424
00:59:14,470 --> 00:59:15,810
Check that out.

1425
00:59:18,310 --> 00:59:19,910
There must be many kinds.

1426
00:59:21,450 --> 00:59:23,950
(The top Mexican breakfast items...)

1427
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:27,020
(are available here.)

1428
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:29,790
What? Is he singing live?

1429
00:59:33,790 --> 00:59:35,930
I thought it was the music playing.

1430
00:59:37,330 --> 00:59:39,899
(A restaurant with the real local Mexican vibe)

1431
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:41,530
Hi. Thank you.

1432
00:59:41,730 --> 00:59:43,270
- Hello.
- Hello.

1433
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:44,840
- Two?
- Two.

1434
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:48,270
(Showing the pictures to order)

1435
00:59:48,510 --> 00:59:49,670
What about that thing?

1436
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:53,110
Is...

1437
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:55,110
Is that good?

1438
00:59:55,650 --> 00:59:57,210
This is...

1439
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,920
Give me your fork.

1440
01:00:00,150 --> 01:00:01,250
Wait. Here it is.

1441
01:00:04,490 --> 01:00:06,360
She'd give it to me? Really?

1442
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,359
- It's the Mexican meat croquette.
- Thank you.

1443
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:09,729
Try it.

1444
01:00:09,730 --> 01:00:10,930
Thank you.

1445
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:14,600
(A sudden sampling)

1446
01:00:16,230 --> 01:00:17,530
- Is it good?
- Yes.

1447
01:00:17,770 --> 01:00:18,770
(Exclaiming)

1448
01:00:18,771 --> 01:00:20,069
- Is it good? Order it?
- It's good.

1449
01:00:20,070 --> 01:00:21,340
- It's good.
- Thank you.

1450
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:23,770
- Get that too?
- Yes.

1451
01:00:24,310 --> 01:00:27,009
- Churros.
- Churros.

1452
01:00:27,010 --> 01:00:28,809
- No, one.
- One.

1453
01:00:28,810 --> 01:00:30,510
- One.
- I can eat two.

1454
01:00:30,610 --> 01:00:32,419
- I can eat two...
- One, please.

1455
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:33,449
- Please.
- No.

1456
01:00:33,450 --> 01:00:35,319
- We agreed.
- Yes.

1457
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:37,420
We agreed to see it first.

1458
01:00:37,690 --> 01:00:39,789
But I don't get to order anything I want.

1459
01:00:39,790 --> 01:00:40,919
- Why do you stop me?
- We agreed...

1460
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:42,029
to go for churros after this.

1461
01:00:42,030 --> 01:00:43,529
Why is he ordering churros here?

1462
01:00:43,530 --> 01:00:45,600
Their churros are guaranteed to be good. Look at them.

1463
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:47,400
- We should try them.
- That's it.

1464
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:48,499
(Hands sealed)

1465
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:49,869
(CEO Lee can't do anything he wants.)

1466
01:00:49,870 --> 01:00:51,170
Thank you.

1467
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,839
I'm curious about...

1468
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:55,269
that black...

1469
01:00:55,270 --> 01:00:57,170
- I ordered that too.
- We ordered it.

1470
01:00:57,670 --> 01:00:59,439
- That black...
- I can't even guess.

1471
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,150
That doesn't look like it's for dinner.

1472
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:02,279
- I don't know what it is.
- But...

1473
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:04,680
- every table has it.
- That dish?

1474
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:09,390
(This dish looks curious.)

1475
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:13,460
I have no idea what that is.

1476
01:01:15,590 --> 01:01:17,260
Is it good?

1477
01:01:17,730 --> 01:01:18,830
Is it good?

1478
01:01:21,930 --> 01:01:23,100
She's giving it to us.

1479
01:01:23,830 --> 01:01:25,200
But...

1480
01:01:25,270 --> 01:01:26,640
I wasn't asking for that.

1481
01:01:27,270 --> 01:01:28,339
Why are you doing that?

1482
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:30,270
- I wasn't asking for her to share.
- We'll get it too.

1483
01:01:30,370 --> 01:01:31,939
- Thank you.
- She's sharing.

1484
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:33,009
Thank you.

1485
01:01:33,010 --> 01:01:34,079
(The sampling continues.)

1486
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:35,510
I didn't ask for this.

1487
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:42,090
Oh, good.

1488
01:01:45,090 --> 01:01:46,920
- I know this flavor.
- It's like visiting a marketplace.

1489
01:01:46,990 --> 01:01:48,659
Is it like the red bean jelly?

1490
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:49,660
It's not sweet.

1491
01:01:50,690 --> 01:01:52,430
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1492
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:55,130
She never stopped smiling when she was getting our order.

1493
01:01:55,570 --> 01:01:57,699
- She's kind.
- That's what makes me happy.

1494
01:01:57,700 --> 01:01:58,769
- Right.
- Her kindness.

1495
01:01:58,770 --> 01:02:00,169
When people here were leaving,

1496
01:02:00,170 --> 01:02:01,410
the lady at the next table...

1497
01:02:01,610 --> 01:02:03,409
told us that this table was available.

1498
01:02:03,410 --> 01:02:05,140
- It's here.
- This is good.

1499
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:07,679
(Tortas de carne:)

1500
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,449
(Braising meat patty in spicy tomato sauce)

1501
01:02:09,450 --> 01:02:11,379
(The next table's recommendation)

1502
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:13,019
(Frijoles refritos: Crushed beans mixed with scrambled eggs)

1503
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:15,520
This is completely different from your imagination.

1504
01:02:16,590 --> 01:02:18,019
Oh, what is that?

1505
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:20,120
I hear this is good.

1506
01:02:20,290 --> 01:02:22,290
That's the tortilla.

1507
01:02:22,490 --> 01:02:23,789
The tortilla is the plate.

1508
01:02:23,790 --> 01:02:25,299
That looks like eggs and cheese.

1509
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:26,560
Do you break the yolk?

1510
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:27,969
Just eat it together.

1511
01:02:27,970 --> 01:02:29,070
Like this.

1512
01:02:29,570 --> 01:02:30,829
- The tortilla...
- It's crispy.

1513
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:32,139
It's the nacho.

1514
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:33,999
I guess you dip it in the salsa.

1515
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,939
- It's soft-boiled.
- Doesn't it look good?

1516
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:37,139
Grab it...

1517
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:38,739
(The auditor's eyes shine when he sees protein.)

1518
01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:40,140
I'll try it.

1519
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:43,579
- Oh, please.
- Are you nervous?

1520
01:02:43,580 --> 01:02:45,319
It's got to be good.

1521
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:47,149
(Is it good enough to make up for yesterday?)

1522
01:02:47,150 --> 01:02:48,490
I'll try it.

1523
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:52,019
- Oh, please.
- Are you nervous?

1524
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:53,789
It's got to be good.

1525
01:02:53,790 --> 01:02:55,089
(Is it good enough to make up for yesterday?)

1526
01:02:55,090 --> 01:02:56,860
Do you want to eat it together? At the count of three?

1527
01:02:57,290 --> 01:02:58,799
Yes, you should grab the egg too.

1528
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,300
- The egg smells so good.
- It...

1529
01:03:00,330 --> 01:03:01,330
Here.

1530
01:03:01,730 --> 01:03:04,970
(Pouring plenty of sauce)

1531
01:03:05,970 --> 01:03:07,440
One, two, three.

1532
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:18,250
I love it.

1533
01:03:18,251 --> 01:03:19,550
- Me too.
- This is good.

1534
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:21,549
- Really?
- It's really good.

1535
01:03:21,550 --> 01:03:22,749
You should try. I mean it.

1536
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:24,049
You're saying something's good for the first time.

1537
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,220
- This is really good.
- But...

1538
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:27,620
it's unique.

1539
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:29,959
- This is really good.
- It's unique, but...

1540
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:32,430
The nachos and the egg go well together.

1541
01:03:32,860 --> 01:03:35,130
I don't know how to describe it.

1542
01:03:35,830 --> 01:03:37,199
This is sour.

1543
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:38,600
It's sour like this.

1544
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,870
It's sour and salty...

1545
01:03:42,210 --> 01:03:43,610
and spicy.

1546
01:03:44,370 --> 01:03:46,980
The nachos are soaked in that sauce.

1547
01:03:47,310 --> 01:03:49,410
And the cheese...

1548
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:50,909
It keeps the dish cheesy.

1549
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:52,480
It enhances the richness.

1550
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:54,589
It's addictive.

1551
01:03:54,590 --> 01:03:56,089
This is highly recommended.

1552
01:03:56,090 --> 01:03:58,189
- I love the texture.
- This is good.

1553
01:03:58,190 --> 01:03:59,320
It's crispy.

1554
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:03,060
- One...
- Anyone would...

1555
01:04:04,130 --> 01:04:07,360
This would be perfect for a hangover.

1556
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,300
That must be why everyone has it for breakfast.

1557
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:11,540
- This is really good.
- Yes.

1558
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:13,240
Jeong Bin, try this.

1559
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:15,639
(CEO Lee wants to share the delicious dish.)

1560
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:16,710
(Exclaiming)

1561
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:21,580
(The customer saw the production crew trying the dish.)

1562
01:04:21,610 --> 01:04:22,680
Do you like it?

1563
01:04:23,710 --> 01:04:24,879
Thank you.

1564
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:26,950
We're the world.

1565
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:28,320
Thank you.

1566
01:04:28,390 --> 01:04:29,520
Seriously.

1567
01:04:29,550 --> 01:04:31,150
- I'll cut this.
- It's already been cut.

1568
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:32,260
- Really?
- Yes.

1569
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:34,890
It's tomato stew with meat pies in it.

1570
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:37,659
Is this the meat pie?

1571
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:38,730
I guess so.

1572
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,030
This is one huge pepper.

1573
01:04:41,060 --> 01:04:42,129
Let's try it.

1574
01:04:42,130 --> 01:04:43,570
One, two, three.

1575
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,270
(They try it at the same time again.)

1576
01:04:49,070 --> 01:04:50,269
(Director Doh is the food expert.)

1577
01:04:50,270 --> 01:04:52,479
This is...

1578
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:53,610
What's that supposed to mean?

1579
01:04:54,340 --> 01:04:55,379
What?

1580
01:04:55,380 --> 01:04:56,910
(He analyzes the flavor using all his taste buds.)

1581
01:04:57,580 --> 01:04:58,780
This is good,

1582
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:00,919
but I can't describe the flavor.

1583
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:02,219
- Why not?
- This is really good.

1584
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:03,690
This is soup.

1585
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:05,019
- Soup?
- It's stew.

1586
01:05:05,020 --> 01:05:07,490
We have this in Korea.

1587
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:09,460
- Yes, it tastes like Korean.
- We have it.

1588
01:05:10,790 --> 01:05:11,960
We have it in Korea?

1589
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:14,060
- Right?
- Hey, this is jjigae.

1590
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:15,370
It's jjigae.

1591
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:16,929
It tastes similar to kimchi jjigae.

1592
01:05:16,930 --> 01:05:19,499
I think it tastes similar because of the tomato.

1593
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:20,999
If you try the soup only, it tastes like kimchi jjigae.

1594
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,670
It's the meat broth.

1595
01:05:24,070 --> 01:05:26,540
- It...
- It tastes like tomato egg soup.

1596
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:28,179
It kind of tastes like tom yum kung.

1597
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:29,449
There's tom yum kung in it.

1598
01:05:29,450 --> 01:05:30,809
Because of the sour taste.

1599
01:05:30,810 --> 01:05:33,380
- Hey, this is strangely good.
- It's good.

1600
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:35,619
We can have this when we want Korean food.

1601
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:36,820
One thing is clear. It's tasty.

1602
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:38,890
I want to mix rice.

1603
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:40,819
It's like mom's cooking.

1604
01:05:40,820 --> 01:05:42,359
My grandma likes rice cake,

1605
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:45,130
- but she can't digest it easily.
- Her teeth...

1606
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:48,299
You should visit here when you're touring.

1607
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:49,369
It's a must.

1608
01:05:49,370 --> 01:05:50,830
I love the vibe.

1609
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:53,540
This...

1610
01:05:54,470 --> 01:05:55,610
I think...

1611
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:56,839
It looks good.

1612
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:58,080
(It's not a tempting appearance.)

1613
01:05:59,340 --> 01:06:01,110
I can't even tell what it smells like.

1614
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:03,449
Is it like black sesame dough?

1615
01:06:03,450 --> 01:06:04,920
- One, two, three.
- It smells like rice cake.

1616
01:06:12,290 --> 01:06:13,320
It tastes familiar.

1617
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:16,389
- Sirutteok.
- Yes.

1618
01:06:16,390 --> 01:06:17,830
- It even looks like...
- It's sirutteok.

1619
01:06:18,460 --> 01:06:20,100
- Exactly.
- It's sirutteok.

1620
01:06:20,430 --> 01:06:23,370
It tastes like sirutteok...

1621
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:27,470
mixed with scrambled egg.

1622
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:29,469
It's worth taking.

1623
01:06:29,470 --> 01:06:30,539
(They found a tempting item.)

1624
01:06:30,540 --> 01:06:31,540
This is really savory.

1625
01:06:31,541 --> 01:06:34,210
It's the taste of Korea. It really is.

1626
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:37,350
What?

1627
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:40,449
Thank you.

1628
01:06:40,450 --> 01:06:42,089
- Is she giving it to us?
- Mom. Yes.

1629
01:06:42,090 --> 01:06:44,120
- Really?
- To try the churros.

1630
01:06:44,550 --> 01:06:46,520
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1631
01:06:46,790 --> 01:06:48,230
It's a gift from the other table.

1632
01:06:48,790 --> 01:06:50,190
How nice of them.

1633
01:06:51,190 --> 01:06:53,300
Do you want to try something else here?

1634
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:56,670
(Their appetite is out of control.)

1635
01:06:56,970 --> 01:06:58,340
Do you want me to take the dishes if you're done?

1636
01:06:58,740 --> 01:06:59,769
Finish?

1637
01:06:59,770 --> 01:07:01,640
(She's taking the empty plates.)

1638
01:07:01,710 --> 01:07:03,839
- She can take this too.
- Let's keep that.

1639
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:05,310
- No.
- No? Okay.

1640
01:07:05,810 --> 01:07:08,039
- This is so good.
- We don't know how we'd mix it.

1641
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:09,150
- Exactly.
- For dipping...

1642
01:07:09,310 --> 01:07:11,719
Personally, this is...

1643
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:13,180
the best restaurant in Mexico.

1644
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,220
And it's only available here.

1645
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:18,519
Kyung Soo, I'm glad you found this place.

1646
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:19,720
It's a good find.

1647
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:22,329
(Do you have a minute for an interview?)

1648
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:26,200
My goodness. I didn't even brush my hair or put on makeup today.

1649
01:07:26,730 --> 01:07:29,329
(How long have you been coming to this restaurant?)

1650
01:07:29,330 --> 01:07:31,800
It's been a long time.

1651
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:33,899
(Why did you recommend the food?)

1652
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:36,669
He asked me if it was good,

1653
01:07:36,670 --> 01:07:38,509
so I thought it'd be best for him...

1654
01:07:38,510 --> 01:07:41,680
to try it himself.

1655
01:07:42,210 --> 01:07:43,949
What they're having here is...

1656
01:07:43,950 --> 01:07:48,389
the typical Mexican homestyle food.

1657
01:07:48,390 --> 01:07:49,690
Homemade food.

1658
01:07:50,190 --> 01:07:52,090
This restaurant makes homestyle food.

1659
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:53,890
That's what it's known for.

1660
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:57,159
It'd be great for foreigners to try Mexican food here because...

1661
01:07:57,160 --> 01:08:00,560
TV shows only take them to expensive ones.

1662
01:08:00,930 --> 01:08:03,670
But not here. There is no restaurant like this.

1663
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:06,040
Thank you so much for your time.

1664
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:08,100
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1665
01:08:08,340 --> 01:08:11,439
Eat. You need to eat.

1666
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:13,740
(The customers are worried about the production crew's meal.)

1667
01:08:14,810 --> 01:08:17,179
- Bye.
- Enjoy the food.

1668
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:19,619
- See you. Thank you.
- Thank you.

1669
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:20,720
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1670
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:25,760
(Is a picture okay?)

1671
01:08:28,730 --> 01:08:29,760
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1672
01:08:30,730 --> 01:08:32,630
- This is so heartwarming.
- I know.

1673
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:34,500
She looks nice too.

1674
01:08:34,930 --> 01:08:36,699
- Thank you.
- Bye.

1675
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:38,340
- Bye.
- Bye.

1676
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:41,970
Safe trip back to Korea.

1677
01:08:42,110 --> 01:08:43,409
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1678
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:44,840
(The kind customers leave first.)

1679
01:08:45,810 --> 01:08:50,680
(The kitchen is working on their additional order.)

1680
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:53,880
It's coming. That's ours.

1681
01:08:54,050 --> 01:08:55,819
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1682
01:08:55,820 --> 01:08:57,319
It looks like curry.

1683
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:59,419
This is not meat. It's eggs.

1684
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:01,019
- It's egg.
- I thought it was meat.

1685
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:02,329
I thought it was meat in the picture.

1686
01:09:02,330 --> 01:09:04,899
It'd be good if we dip the tortilla here.

1687
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:06,359
- Let's get tortillas.
- Shall we get one?

1688
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:07,360
Yes.

1689
01:09:07,361 --> 01:09:08,369
Tortilla?

1690
01:09:08,370 --> 01:09:10,170
This is huevos en pasilla.

1691
01:09:10,330 --> 01:09:11,540
Huevos en pasilla?

1692
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:15,069
(In the pocket the server brought...)

1693
01:09:15,070 --> 01:09:16,339
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1694
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:18,479
- So accurate.
- I knew it.

1695
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:20,110
- She knew what we were thinking.
- Yes.

1696
01:09:20,610 --> 01:09:22,610
- It's still hot.
- Yes.

1697
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:24,810
That's a good idea.

1698
01:09:25,550 --> 01:09:27,550
(The pocket keeps the tortillas warm)

1699
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:29,919
- Let's try this by itself first.
- Yes, let's do that.

1700
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,220
- Let's try this first.
- Like this?

1701
01:09:32,290 --> 01:09:33,490
One, two, three.

1702
01:09:38,260 --> 01:09:39,930
How can I describe this flavor?

1703
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:42,470
- This is...
- It's a mix of many flavors.

1704
01:09:44,030 --> 01:09:46,000
- It's good.
- Is it?

1705
01:09:46,070 --> 01:09:47,199
It's different.

1706
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:49,109
It's kind of bitter, but it's good.

1707
01:09:49,110 --> 01:09:50,170
- Yes.
- It's good.

1708
01:09:55,610 --> 01:09:57,249
I want to describe this.

1709
01:09:57,250 --> 01:09:59,079
The more you eat, the more you like it.

1710
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:00,120
Yes.

1711
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:02,920
It kind of tastes like yukgaejang kalguksu, right?

1712
01:10:03,050 --> 01:10:06,089
It's yukgaejang with a taste of Chinese food.

1713
01:10:06,090 --> 01:10:07,619
It tastes a bit like chunjang.

1714
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:09,230
Right.

1715
01:10:10,490 --> 01:10:13,760
I don't know what the bitter taste is,

1716
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:16,130
but if you boil peppers for a long time, they taste bitter.

1717
01:10:16,430 --> 01:10:17,899
I think that's where it comes from.

1718
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:18,940
Maybe you're right.

1719
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:21,000
It'll be good if you mix rice with it.

1720
01:10:21,070 --> 01:10:22,910
- Oh, that'd be perfect.
- Right? With white rice.

1721
01:10:24,810 --> 01:10:26,780
If they had a bowl of rice, I would've ordered it right away.

1722
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:30,450
- I'm full now.
- Me too.

1723
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:32,919
We ate so much.

1724
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:34,050
(Their successful local breakfast is near the end.)

1725
01:10:35,620 --> 01:10:37,890
What that lady's eating looks good too.

1726
01:10:39,290 --> 01:10:41,320
What's she eating? Something new?

1727
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:44,490
We should come here again.

1728
01:10:46,130 --> 01:10:47,929
We have no regrets about this restaurant.

1729
01:10:47,930 --> 01:10:50,399
It's perfect because it's cheap.

1730
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:51,840
- Yes.
- It's no pressure.

1731
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:55,870
We should tip the man singing when we leave.

1732
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:58,170
Let's get a cash receipt for that.

1733
01:10:58,640 --> 01:10:59,809
(The auditor wouldn't miss even the smallest amount.)

1734
01:10:59,810 --> 01:11:01,610
You're so tight.

1735
01:11:02,980 --> 01:11:04,050
I need to write it down.

1736
01:11:05,180 --> 01:11:07,680
(How was your breakfast?)

1737
01:11:08,420 --> 01:11:09,690
It was authentic Mexico.

1738
01:11:10,450 --> 01:11:12,590
Even the music was so Mexican.

1739
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:17,290
And the dishes were so Mexican.

1740
01:11:17,860 --> 01:11:19,000
I loved it.

1741
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:20,630
I was very happy with it.

1742
01:11:21,230 --> 01:11:23,929
Fortunately, the first restaurant...

1743
01:11:23,930 --> 01:11:25,870
in my plan.

1744
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:28,310
It was highly satisfactory.

1745
01:11:28,670 --> 01:11:30,940
This is Mexico.

1746
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:33,380
This is what Mexico means.

1747
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:37,250
That's how I got to start my day.

1748
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:39,820
The Mexico I'd been dreaming of...

1749
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:44,420
for a few days. That was this place.

1750
01:11:45,690 --> 01:11:48,219
We weren't sure about the menu, so when we asked,

1751
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:50,360
they were willing to share their food with us.

1752
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:51,860
Who does that these days?

1753
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,030
This place is...

1754
01:11:54,230 --> 01:11:55,400
They're my family.

1755
01:11:56,700 --> 01:11:59,170
People in that restaurant are all my family.

1756
01:12:01,710 --> 01:12:03,140
I'm a Mexican.

1757
01:12:04,340 --> 01:12:05,410
Thank you.

1758
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:11,580
(GBRB: Joy Pops Laugh Pops)

1759
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:15,090
Jun Wi, everything is on one bill.

1760
01:12:15,350 --> 01:12:17,320
We need to talk about it at night.

1761
01:12:17,620 --> 01:12:19,789
Is KKPP Foods treating us?

1762
01:12:19,790 --> 01:12:21,590
- You need to pay them the interest.
- Are we?

1763
01:12:22,330 --> 01:12:24,990
We'll have to talk tonight.

1764
01:12:25,830 --> 01:12:28,029
We tipped the singer.

1765
01:12:28,030 --> 01:12:29,570
We should split that too.

1766
01:12:30,470 --> 01:12:32,140
Because we all listened to his songs together.

1767
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:34,600
(CEO Lee is strict when it comes to money.)

1768
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:36,270
- Shall we leave for the churros?
- Let's go.

1769
01:12:37,470 --> 01:12:39,139
The churros here were so good.

1770
01:12:39,140 --> 01:12:40,679
- Yes.
- It was nothing like I had before.

1771
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:41,680
(Moving to try Mexico's famous snack)

1772
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:46,120
(Singing)

1773
01:12:46,150 --> 01:12:49,020
- Good food makes you happy, right?
- Yes.

1774
01:12:49,150 --> 01:12:50,420
It's giving me energy.

1775
01:12:51,690 --> 01:12:55,089
I think the food takes up about 70 or 80 percent of the trip.

1776
01:12:55,090 --> 01:12:56,130
Yes.

1777
01:12:56,230 --> 01:12:57,790
How much does the food take up in your trip?

1778
01:12:58,190 --> 01:12:59,760
It takes up a lot.

1779
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,229
About 80 or 90.

1780
01:13:01,230 --> 01:13:02,370
- About 80 or 90?
- Yes.

1781
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:04,230
- Doesn't it take up a lot for you?
- It does.

1782
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:06,899
Normally, it's about 20 percent for me.

1783
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:08,070
- Only 20?
- Yes.

1784
01:13:08,270 --> 01:13:09,440
For Woo Bin,

1785
01:13:10,940 --> 01:13:12,080
health takes up 60 percent.

1786
01:13:12,410 --> 01:13:14,180
- No.
- Like air.

1787
01:13:14,310 --> 01:13:16,049
- The ingredients or...
- Nature.

1788
01:13:16,050 --> 01:13:17,510
Nature. The view.

1789
01:13:17,610 --> 01:13:19,579
Yes, in general.

1790
01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:20,650
(Everyone pursues different charms when traveling.)

1791
01:13:20,780 --> 01:13:21,990
It's nice weather.

1792
01:13:23,490 --> 01:13:24,590
(Glancing)

1793
01:13:25,090 --> 01:13:26,320
The dogs...

1794
01:13:26,420 --> 01:13:30,490
People take at least three dogs with them.

1795
01:13:31,060 --> 01:13:32,060
They're cute.

1796
01:13:32,430 --> 01:13:34,700
(Clicking)

1797
01:13:35,470 --> 01:13:37,230
I've seen so many dogs,

1798
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:39,000
but I never did that before.

1799
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:40,940
- Really?
- I guess I am happy.

1800
01:13:42,810 --> 01:13:44,270
- Hello.
- Hello.

1801
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:46,240
Hello.

1802
01:13:46,540 --> 01:13:47,939
(Laughing)

1803
01:13:47,940 --> 01:13:49,909
- You are happy.
- You're happy.

1804
01:13:49,910 --> 01:13:51,280
(Delicious food makes CEO Lee happy.)

1805
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:53,680
(Over there!)

1806
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:55,550
- There?
- Yes.

1807
01:13:56,550 --> 01:13:58,020
Since 1935.

1808
01:13:59,190 --> 01:14:00,820
It's a really old churro place.

1809
01:14:01,490 --> 01:14:03,130
- Should we place an order first?
- Let's do that.

1810
01:14:07,030 --> 01:14:10,630
They have 1, 4, or 12 churros.

1811
01:14:11,070 --> 01:14:12,600
We can get four.

1812
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:13,770
Eat four?

1813
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:17,270
- Hello.
- Hello. Good afternoon.

1814
01:14:17,970 --> 01:14:19,080
Four churros.

1815
01:14:19,810 --> 01:14:23,510
And three dips.

1816
01:14:23,610 --> 01:14:24,610
Okay.

1817
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:27,050
And two hot chocolates.

1818
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:30,490
Hey, what is that?

1819
01:14:32,090 --> 01:14:33,160
Is that juice?

1820
01:14:33,820 --> 01:14:35,429
The one on the left.

1821
01:14:35,430 --> 01:14:37,130
Wait. They have horchata.

1822
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:38,799
- I'm sorry, but...
- Yes?

1823
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,329
change it to one hot chocolate,

1824
01:14:40,330 --> 01:14:41,729
and let's get one horchata.

1825
01:14:41,730 --> 01:14:42,769
Let's do that.

1826
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:43,770
One horchata.

1827
01:14:43,870 --> 01:14:45,030
- Horchata.
- Okay.

1828
01:14:45,570 --> 01:14:46,600
That's all.

1829
01:14:46,970 --> 01:14:48,610
Cash or card?

1830
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:51,070
(Showing)

1831
01:14:51,340 --> 01:14:53,479
- Card?
- I think she asked...

1832
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:54,640
if we were paying by card.

1833
01:14:55,010 --> 01:14:57,049
(Paying safely with his guts)

1834
01:14:57,050 --> 01:14:58,180
Thank you.

1835
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:00,479
(Turning)

1836
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:01,580
It's nice weather.

1837
01:15:02,750 --> 01:15:04,620
(CEO Lee wants to share this emotion.)

1838
01:15:05,420 --> 01:15:06,620
The weather is good.

1839
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:09,989
- The weather is good.
- I don't think...

1840
01:15:09,990 --> 01:15:11,190
she's fluent in English.

1841
01:15:11,630 --> 01:15:13,830
(It's the language barrier.)

1842
01:15:14,060 --> 01:15:16,100
The weather is nice.

1843
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:17,770
The weather...

1844
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:19,440
- The weather is nice.
- The weather is nice.

1845
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:21,700
(Trying again in Spanish)

1846
01:15:21,770 --> 01:15:22,840
Yes.

1847
01:15:23,470 --> 01:15:25,410
(Speechless)

1848
01:15:25,540 --> 01:15:26,780
It's not that she disregarded me.

1849
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:29,580
That's the fun of traveling.

1850
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:35,019
(Surprised)

1851
01:15:35,020 --> 01:15:36,390
They're making churros over there.

1852
01:15:38,790 --> 01:15:40,920
Right. They're making it fresh.

1853
01:15:43,430 --> 01:15:45,459
(The churros made with the 90 years of tradition)

1854
01:15:45,460 --> 01:15:49,030
(Known for covering it with cinnamon sugar)

1855
01:15:49,870 --> 01:15:50,870
It's here.

1856
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:53,669
(It's served.)

1857
01:15:53,670 --> 01:15:55,540
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1858
01:15:56,310 --> 01:15:57,840
It looks really good.

1859
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:06,820
I think it's caramel.

1860
01:16:07,550 --> 01:16:08,689
(He gets excited upon seeing it.)

1861
01:16:08,690 --> 01:16:09,790
What's this?

1862
01:16:10,420 --> 01:16:12,220
Caramel, chocolate,

1863
01:16:12,260 --> 01:16:13,560
and cocoa.

1864
01:16:13,660 --> 01:16:15,790
Kwang Soo, let's eat it plain first.

1865
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:18,830
(For the first bite, they eat it plain.)

1866
01:16:19,330 --> 01:16:20,900
Anyone would like it.

1867
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:22,869
It's very crispy.

1868
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:23,969
The inside is...

1869
01:16:23,970 --> 01:16:25,270
meaty.

1870
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:30,809
(The culinary director gets angry because it's so tasty.)

1871
01:16:30,810 --> 01:16:32,140
(Exclaiming)

1872
01:16:32,310 --> 01:16:33,809
It isn't like the chewy churros...

1873
01:16:33,810 --> 01:16:36,050
we get in Korea.

1874
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,210
- What was it? The pie crust?
- The pie crust.

1875
01:16:38,650 --> 01:16:40,350
It's similar to that.

1876
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:43,619
(Woo Bin takes a bite as well.)

1877
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:45,890
(The taste makes him nod.)

1878
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:47,220
And the churro is...

1879
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:50,030
saltier than I expected.

1880
01:16:51,460 --> 01:16:52,760
But the saltiness...

1881
01:16:53,030 --> 01:16:54,430
doesn't make you go, "It's salty!"

1882
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:56,429
It's below that level of saltiness.

1883
01:16:56,430 --> 01:16:58,370
(The culinary director even distinguishes the saltiness.)

1884
01:16:58,470 --> 01:16:59,999
It's like how...

1885
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,939
watermelon tastes sweeter with a bit of salt.

1886
01:17:01,940 --> 01:17:04,140
A bit of saltiness makes it taste sweeter.

1887
01:17:04,740 --> 01:17:06,879
(A good example of sweet and salty)

1888
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,009
It's tasty.

1889
01:17:08,010 --> 01:17:10,280
(Woo Bin tries a new sauce.)

1890
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:14,680
The cocoa sauce is tasty.

1891
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:16,750
- Isn't it unusual?
- Yes.

1892
01:17:16,790 --> 01:17:18,290
It's a sauce I haven't had before.

1893
01:17:18,650 --> 01:17:20,019
We're familiar with these two,

1894
01:17:20,020 --> 01:17:21,890
- but this one...
- They go well with the sauces.

1895
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:25,630
(Now comes hot chocolate, the perfect partner of churros.)

1896
01:17:25,730 --> 01:17:26,730
(Mexican hot chocolate)

1897
01:17:26,730 --> 01:17:27,730
I can smell cinnamon.

1898
01:17:27,730 --> 01:17:28,730
(Mexico is the home of chocolate.)

1899
01:17:28,730 --> 01:17:29,730
(The addition of cinnamon or chili gives it unique flavors.)

1900
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:33,299
(My goodness)

1901
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:34,300
What's that?

1902
01:17:34,301 --> 01:17:35,470
Hot chocolate.

1903
01:17:35,910 --> 01:17:37,040
It's different.

1904
01:17:38,710 --> 01:17:40,940
(We see why their hot chocolate is famous.)

1905
01:17:41,340 --> 01:17:43,010
It's the taste Kwang Soo absolutely loves.

1906
01:17:43,110 --> 01:17:44,649
It's hot chocolate, but there's a hint of cinnamon.

1907
01:17:44,650 --> 01:17:46,350
- You smell cinnamon.
- They go very well together.

1908
01:17:47,050 --> 01:17:48,790
It's a luxurious hot chocolate.

1909
01:17:49,650 --> 01:17:50,849
I strongly recommend hot chocolate.

1910
01:17:50,850 --> 01:17:51,990
- It's good.
- Yes.

1911
01:17:53,020 --> 01:17:54,889
- It makes you smile.
- It's a luxurious hot chocolate.

1912
01:17:54,890 --> 01:17:56,029
It's so tasty.

1913
01:17:56,030 --> 01:17:59,200
It isn't too sweet.

1914
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:03,230
You know,

1915
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:04,599
I swear...

1916
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:05,870
I can eat this with rice.

1917
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:10,910
Horchata.

1918
01:18:11,470 --> 01:18:12,739
Is that horchata?

1919
01:18:12,740 --> 01:18:13,939
- It looks good.
- Horchata.

1920
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:15,749
Isn't it a Mexican drink?

1921
01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:17,410
Yes, it's a traditional drink.

1922
01:18:18,210 --> 01:18:19,380
I'll try it.

1923
01:18:19,650 --> 01:18:21,720
(He smells it first.)

1924
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:30,230
Seriously, it's so unique.

1925
01:18:31,130 --> 01:18:33,030
I've never tasted anything like it.

1926
01:18:36,130 --> 01:18:37,530
How should I describe it?

1927
01:18:39,470 --> 01:18:41,300
(Laughing)

1928
01:18:41,370 --> 01:18:44,510
You can't help but make that face.

1929
01:18:45,110 --> 01:18:47,640
(He can't think of a way to describe the taste.)

1930
01:18:48,610 --> 01:18:50,550
It smells a bit like makgeolli.

1931
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:55,850
Let me tell you what it's like.

1932
01:18:56,190 --> 01:18:57,949
You have a childhood memory...

1933
01:18:57,950 --> 01:18:59,719
of washing your face and applying your mom's lotion.

1934
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:01,190
When a bit of it goes into your mouth...

1935
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:03,890
- Yes.
- Right? That's the taste.

1936
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:06,359
It takes some time for the brain...

1937
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:07,399
to process this taste.

1938
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:08,430
(They need time to describe the taste.)

1939
01:19:09,270 --> 01:19:11,000
- What is it?
- Try it.

1940
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:13,099
Enjoy it.

1941
01:19:13,100 --> 01:19:14,300
- This one?
- Try it.

1942
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:15,440
What is it called?

1943
01:19:15,441 --> 01:19:16,770
Cafe de olla.

1944
01:19:16,870 --> 01:19:19,210
- Cafe de olla.
- It's Mexican coffee.

1945
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:23,650
It smells like cinnamon too.

1946
01:19:29,490 --> 01:19:30,750
- Is it good?
- It's good.

1947
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:33,519
It's so unusual.

1948
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,020
- It smells a bit like ssanghwacha.
- Right?

1949
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:36,189
The taste goes like this.

1950
01:19:36,190 --> 01:19:37,329
(The taste of the coffee goes like this.)

1951
01:19:37,330 --> 01:19:38,859
Coffee, cinnamon, ssanghwacha.

1952
01:19:38,860 --> 01:19:40,260
It goes like this.

1953
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:43,030
(Drinking)

1954
01:19:43,770 --> 01:19:44,900
It's tasty, right?

1955
01:19:46,970 --> 01:19:48,300
Don't you like it?

1956
01:19:49,110 --> 01:19:50,670
I like it. It's tasty.

1957
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:52,410
Woo Bin would like the taste.

1958
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:57,080
(He savors the taste.)

1959
01:19:57,550 --> 01:19:58,610
- It's good, right?
- Yes.

1960
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:00,849
- It's like herbal medicine.
- He likes it.

1961
01:20:00,850 --> 01:20:02,050
- He likes such flavors.
- Herbal medicine.

1962
01:20:02,350 --> 01:20:04,149
Why does it smell like pork?

1963
01:20:04,150 --> 01:20:05,720
Does it smell like pork?

1964
01:20:06,090 --> 01:20:07,560
Let me describe the smell.

1965
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:09,690
In Chinese cuisine...

1966
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:11,530
- A pork dish. Dongpo pork.
- Dongpo pork.

1967
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:13,430
Keep that in mind and smell it.

1968
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:14,800
It smells like dongpo pork.

1969
01:20:16,970 --> 01:20:18,169
(I see.)

1970
01:20:18,170 --> 01:20:19,739
- It's tasty.
- If we boil pork...

1971
01:20:19,740 --> 01:20:21,400
in this drink,

1972
01:20:21,770 --> 01:20:22,940
it'll come out tasty for sure.

1973
01:20:23,710 --> 01:20:24,909
It'll come out tasty for sure.

1974
01:20:24,910 --> 01:20:26,840
(Exploring the popular snacks of Mexico was successful.)

1975
01:20:27,580 --> 01:20:28,640
It's cute.

1976
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:31,550
We need to make a reservation...

1977
01:20:31,610 --> 01:20:32,749
for the hot-air balloon.

1978
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:34,479
(CEO Lee wants to go on the hot-air balloon tour.)

1979
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:35,749
(Searching the hot-air balloon tours)

1980
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:37,590
There are many package deals.

1981
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:39,720
The ratings...

1982
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:41,120
are 5.0.

1983
01:20:42,260 --> 01:20:43,389
What?

1984
01:20:43,390 --> 01:20:44,459
(He finds a tour that includes the hot-air balloon and pyramid.)

1985
01:20:44,460 --> 01:20:45,600
Hot-air balloon.

1986
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:47,560
- Did you send me the link?
- Yes.

1987
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:50,699
(He shares the tour link with Woo Bin.)

1988
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:51,730
Look.

1989
01:20:51,970 --> 01:20:53,239
It looks like it has been photoshopped.

1990
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:54,600
(Impressed)

1991
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:57,910
I'll take photos like this one tomorrow.

1992
01:20:58,370 --> 01:20:59,540
It's very nice.

1993
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:02,510
(They look for the tour they can reserve for tomorrow.)

1994
01:21:03,950 --> 01:21:05,819
(Gasping)

1995
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:08,080
At 4:30am,

1996
01:21:09,150 --> 01:21:11,250
the pickup begins.

1997
01:21:12,260 --> 01:21:14,319
- In the morning?
- Can't we watch the sunset?

1998
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:16,660
(They're taken aback by the early start.)

1999
01:21:18,190 --> 01:21:20,330
"It was the best moment in Mexico City."

2000
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:23,170
It really looks like a painting.

2001
01:21:24,470 --> 01:21:27,340
(They steel their wavering hearts.)

2002
01:21:28,070 --> 01:21:29,939
I'll contact them.

2003
01:21:29,940 --> 01:21:31,810
(He asks them if they can join the tour tomorrow.)

2004
01:21:33,510 --> 01:21:35,510
Are we going to the market right away?

2005
01:21:36,310 --> 01:21:37,710
We're going to the market right away, right?

2006
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:39,319
It sounds fun.

2007
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:40,519
(Relaying the schedule)

2008
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:42,049
(The actual leader's confirmation determines the next destination.)

2009
01:21:42,050 --> 01:21:43,220
Where will you go?

2010
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:45,390
After visiting the Artisan Market,

2011
01:21:45,690 --> 01:21:48,160
we can walk downward to eat the tripe tacos.

2012
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:51,630
Then we can check out the square, Zocalo,

2013
01:21:51,790 --> 01:21:53,960
and go back to the hotel.

2014
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,900
Can we eat another taco right now?

2015
01:21:57,900 --> 01:21:59,140
It'll be...

2016
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:02,040
about two hours later anyway.

2017
01:22:02,170 --> 01:22:03,539
And we'll walk a lot.

2018
01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:05,339
Besides, we'll only eat...

2019
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:06,980
one taco.

2020
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:08,679
(The director comforts the CEO.)

2021
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:09,710
No?

2022
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:17,550
(GBRB: Joy Pops Laugh Pops)

2023
01:22:18,250 --> 01:22:20,459
(They decide to take the subway to the market.)

2024
01:22:20,460 --> 01:22:22,730
We've gotten used to...

2025
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:24,690
- taking the subway.
- That's right.

2026
01:22:25,660 --> 01:22:27,099
(They use the metro card in a natural way.)

2027
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:28,700
It's about 40 cents.

2028
01:22:33,570 --> 01:22:35,909
(The windy subway becomes a part of their daily lives.)

2029
01:22:35,910 --> 01:22:37,709
(He's wearing sunglasses.)

2030
01:22:37,710 --> 01:22:39,640
- We're here.
- Are we here already?

2031
01:22:40,110 --> 01:22:41,980
We've practically become Mexicans.

2032
01:22:42,210 --> 01:22:44,049
(On the second day, he proudly says that he has become a local.)

2033
01:22:44,050 --> 01:22:45,109
You know it better than the Seoul subway.

2034
01:22:45,110 --> 01:22:46,150
I know.

2035
01:22:47,020 --> 01:22:49,249
I forgot to tell you something.

2036
01:22:49,250 --> 01:22:50,289
(He has a message from the head office.)

2037
01:22:50,290 --> 01:22:53,260
You said that you wanted to buy some local clothes.

2038
01:22:53,460 --> 01:22:57,259
The head office will pay for the clothes you'll wear.

2039
01:22:57,260 --> 01:22:58,289
Really?

2040
01:22:58,290 --> 01:23:00,130
- Thank you.
- You can wear them.

2041
01:23:01,660 --> 01:23:02,829
- It'll be fun.
- In that case,

2042
01:23:02,830 --> 01:23:04,100
let's go to an expensive store.

2043
01:23:05,430 --> 01:23:06,969
- The most expensive store...
- Yes.

2044
01:23:06,970 --> 01:23:08,140
at the market.

2045
01:23:08,940 --> 01:23:10,340
This is...

2046
01:23:11,070 --> 01:23:13,310
- What's this?
- There are so many things to buy.

2047
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:14,940
There are many items.

2048
01:23:15,410 --> 01:23:16,810
It has begun already.

2049
01:23:17,980 --> 01:23:19,520
There is street food as well.

2050
01:23:21,150 --> 01:23:23,919
(The CEO gets distracted right away.)

2051
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:25,490
- DVDs?
- There's something inside.

2052
01:23:26,260 --> 01:23:28,720
Where are you going right now?

2053
01:23:29,230 --> 01:23:31,129
A market where you can buy...

2054
01:23:31,130 --> 01:23:33,460
- cute and pretty items.
- There are so many things to buy.

2055
01:23:35,030 --> 01:23:36,129
(Are the older members bad at following your lead?)

2056
01:23:36,130 --> 01:23:37,400
You know,

2057
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,900
I'm so used to it now.

2058
01:23:40,740 --> 01:23:41,940
It doesn't faze me...

2059
01:23:42,510 --> 01:23:43,770
much.

2060
01:23:44,510 --> 01:23:46,340
I just go on my way.

2061
01:23:47,380 --> 01:23:48,480
So...

2062
01:23:49,550 --> 01:23:51,179
they follow me when they want.

2063
01:23:51,180 --> 01:23:52,479
(He lets the older members wander.)

2064
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:54,120
- Kyung Soo, stand there.
- We need to walk some more.

2065
01:23:54,420 --> 01:23:55,550
Stand there.

2066
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:58,819
(The older members begin to dote on Kyung Soo.)

2067
01:23:58,820 --> 01:23:59,820
There you go.

2068
01:24:00,020 --> 01:24:03,159
(A fan service)

2069
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:04,429
Two, three.

2070
01:24:04,430 --> 01:24:06,330
(They take a group photo.)

2071
01:24:06,430 --> 01:24:07,760
It came out well.

2072
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:10,870
- It's cute.
- Make it a poster.

2073
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:12,070
It's cute.

2074
01:24:13,070 --> 01:24:14,469
(You let them take photos.)

2075
01:24:14,470 --> 01:24:16,210
- Really?
- It came out well.

2076
01:24:16,270 --> 01:24:17,510
If I say no to the photos,

2077
01:24:17,710 --> 01:24:19,180
- they keep complaining.
- Kyung Soo.

2078
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:22,110
We're talking about the photo together.

2079
01:24:22,750 --> 01:24:24,849
Do you have an appointment? Do you have a schedule?

2080
01:24:24,850 --> 01:24:25,980
No.

2081
01:24:26,250 --> 01:24:27,650
- It's good.
- Is this about the tacos?

2082
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:29,519
- What?
- Is this about the tacos?

2083
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:30,690
No.

2084
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:33,190
(Group activities are important at KKPP Foods.)

2085
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:34,459
- Kyung Soo.
- Yes?

2086
01:24:34,460 --> 01:24:35,990
Between 4:30am and 5am,

2087
01:24:36,260 --> 01:24:37,989
- they'll pick us up.
- The hot-air balloon tour?

2088
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:40,029
- I'll go ahead and book it.
- That sounds good.

2089
01:24:40,030 --> 01:24:41,159
Sit here and do it.

2090
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:42,160
Let's do that.

2091
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,169
(They pay for the hot-air balloon tour first.)

2092
01:24:44,170 --> 01:24:45,699
With the reservation...

2093
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:47,540
How much money remains after the hot-air balloon ride?

2094
01:24:47,970 --> 01:24:50,770
The total is 2,145.60 dollars...

2095
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:51,869
for six people.

2096
01:24:51,870 --> 01:24:52,910
It's a big sum.

2097
01:24:53,180 --> 01:24:54,410
My hands are shaking.

2098
01:24:56,050 --> 01:24:58,880
But the people who went on a hot-air balloon ride...

2099
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:00,680
felt like...

2100
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:03,790
they were reborn.

2101
01:25:03,890 --> 01:25:05,049
Reborn?

2102
01:25:05,050 --> 01:25:07,460
After seeing the scenery,

2103
01:25:07,890 --> 01:25:09,690
they became very different.

2104
01:25:09,790 --> 01:25:12,530
Also, they began to believe in the higher power.

2105
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:15,330
Many people did that for real.

2106
01:25:17,830 --> 01:25:19,200
(Kyung Soo is speechless.)

2107
01:25:22,540 --> 01:25:24,339
(Kwang Soo is speechless.)

2108
01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:26,909
In any case, it's something you can experience and feel...

2109
01:25:26,910 --> 01:25:28,740
only here.

2110
01:25:29,010 --> 01:25:30,249
It'll be crucial...

2111
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:33,319
for broadening our horizons as CEO Ko said.

2112
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:34,320
(He's determined to ride it.)

2113
01:25:34,450 --> 01:25:35,519
Jun Wi.

2114
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:38,019
For the tour, six people need to travel...

2115
01:25:38,020 --> 01:25:39,149
in one vehicle.

2116
01:25:39,150 --> 01:25:41,090
We'll pay for the total and receive the money later.

2117
01:25:41,290 --> 01:25:43,030
- The cost for the other three.
- Yes.

2118
01:25:43,060 --> 01:25:44,729
(They need to receive the cost for the 3 staff members.)

2119
01:25:44,730 --> 01:25:45,759
Also,

2120
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:47,160
when we ate earlier,

2121
01:25:47,430 --> 01:25:48,599
Producer Na ate...

2122
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:50,530
more than we expected at our table.

2123
01:25:52,170 --> 01:25:53,869
You said that we should eat together.

2124
01:25:53,870 --> 01:25:55,540
While that's true...

2125
01:25:55,700 --> 01:25:57,839
Please consider that, Jun Wi.

2126
01:25:57,840 --> 01:25:59,340
We won't be too meticulous.

2127
01:25:59,740 --> 01:26:03,179
And I gained 2.6 cents earlier through a Toss Bank event.

2128
01:26:03,180 --> 01:26:04,450
He participated in an event.

2129
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:06,820
He scratched lottery tickets and got 2.6 cents.

2130
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:10,520
I scratched 8 lottery tickets and got 2.6 cents.

2131
01:26:11,550 --> 01:26:12,760
It was a big help.

2132
01:26:13,190 --> 01:26:14,559
Shall we check out the bracelets?

2133
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:16,730
- Let's do that.
- Let's check them out.

2134
01:26:17,230 --> 01:26:18,559
They checked my message.

2135
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:19,930
(They begin to explore the market in earnest.)

2136
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,299
This is the place. It's huge.

2137
01:26:22,300 --> 01:26:23,329
It'll be fun.

2138
01:26:23,330 --> 01:26:24,399
(La Ciudadela Artisan Market)

2139
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:25,730
- Gosh.
- My goodness.

2140
01:26:26,900 --> 01:26:28,640
The atmosphere is...

2141
01:26:29,540 --> 01:26:31,540
Kwang Soo, this place is huge.

2142
01:26:31,810 --> 01:26:33,140
There are...

2143
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:35,410
so many things.

2144
01:26:36,050 --> 01:26:38,050
(La Ciudadela Artisan Market is full of handmade goods.)

2145
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:40,249
- Seriously.
- They sell ukuleles.

2146
01:26:40,250 --> 01:26:42,019
There's Coco's guitar.

2147
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:43,550
There's Coco's guitar.

2148
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:45,320
How cute.

2149
01:26:52,730 --> 01:26:53,929
There are so many...

2150
01:26:53,930 --> 01:26:55,730
skeletons and ghosts.

2151
01:26:56,300 --> 01:26:58,099
It must be because of the Day of the Dead.

2152
01:26:58,100 --> 01:27:00,500
Yes. The colors are so vibrant.

2153
01:27:00,570 --> 01:27:01,640
I know.

2154
01:27:02,870 --> 01:27:04,540
Isn't that the artist?

2155
01:27:05,110 --> 01:27:06,339
- This one.
- That's right. Frida Kahlo.

2156
01:27:06,340 --> 01:27:08,039
That's right. Her brows are close together.

2157
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:09,409
She's a famous painter from Mexico.

2158
01:27:09,410 --> 01:27:10,809
(Frida Kahlo's portraits are in the market.)

2159
01:27:10,810 --> 01:27:11,810
A painter.

2160
01:27:12,250 --> 01:27:13,380
Kwang Soo.

2161
01:27:14,650 --> 01:27:16,190
- It's the hat you talked about.
- Seriously.

2162
01:27:16,990 --> 01:27:19,689
(It was an item on Kwang Soo's wishlist.)

2163
01:27:19,690 --> 01:27:22,690
(A Mexican hat, sombrero)

2164
01:27:23,090 --> 01:27:24,430
- It suits you.
- It suits you.

2165
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:27,600
It's heavier than I expected.

2166
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:28,800
It looks that way.

2167
01:27:28,801 --> 01:27:29,899
(He looks like a center member of the mariachi band.)

2168
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:31,630
Try on the red one.

2169
01:27:33,870 --> 01:27:36,310
It suits you. It doesn't look half bad.

2170
01:27:37,710 --> 01:27:38,739
Let me see.

2171
01:27:38,740 --> 01:27:39,780
(It doesn't look half bad.)

2172
01:27:40,810 --> 01:27:42,010
You should buy it.

2173
01:27:42,910 --> 01:27:44,550
- It looks good on you.
- Really?

2174
01:27:44,910 --> 01:27:46,419
It looks good on you.

2175
01:27:46,420 --> 01:27:48,650
(They form a mariachi band.)

2176
01:27:49,490 --> 01:27:51,090
(The youngest member who is a genius musician)

2177
01:27:51,750 --> 01:27:53,020
(The center member who has the looks)

2178
01:27:53,320 --> 01:27:54,989
(The leader who causes trouble)

2179
01:27:54,990 --> 01:27:56,660
One, two, three.

2180
01:27:56,790 --> 01:27:59,629
(Call us for events.)

2181
01:27:59,630 --> 01:28:00,660
Good.

2182
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:02,700
How much is this?

2183
01:28:02,830 --> 01:28:04,869
It's 22 dollars.

2184
01:28:04,870 --> 01:28:06,599
- Is it 22 dollars?
- Not bad.

2185
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:08,499
- It's cheaper than I thought.
- It has been made with care,

2186
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:09,670
but it's only 22 dollars.

2187
01:28:10,740 --> 01:28:12,470
The red one suits you the most.

2188
01:28:14,140 --> 01:28:16,110
- It suits you.
- It suits you.

2189
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:17,310
Good?

2190
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:18,910
No?

2191
01:28:19,780 --> 01:28:20,780
No?

2192
01:28:21,450 --> 01:28:22,450
Good?

2193
01:28:22,451 --> 01:28:23,850
(He freezes.)

2194
01:28:24,490 --> 01:28:26,120
He can't answer that.

2195
01:28:26,660 --> 01:28:28,090
He did this.

2196
01:28:29,690 --> 01:28:30,730
Good?

2197
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:32,860
Is it okay? Shall I take it?

2198
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:34,929
I think it suits you.

2199
01:28:34,930 --> 01:28:37,400
But it'll be better if you change into a new outfit.

2200
01:28:37,700 --> 01:28:39,470
A Mexican outfit suits the hat better.

2201
01:28:39,870 --> 01:28:42,140
(There was a reason why he couldn't answer.)

2202
01:28:43,370 --> 01:28:44,439
Thank you.

2203
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:46,840
(He purchases a sombrero thanks to the head office.)

2204
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:48,309
I love this hat.

2205
01:28:48,310 --> 01:28:49,810
I've always wanted to buy it.

2206
01:28:51,310 --> 01:28:52,550
These are cute.

2207
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:55,180
Are these earrings?

2208
01:28:55,780 --> 01:28:58,219
These are earrings. Kwang Soo, you need to wear them.

2209
01:28:58,220 --> 01:28:59,690
- What?
- These are earrings.

2210
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,720
- They're perfect.
- They're jalapenos.

2211
01:29:01,890 --> 01:29:03,229
Aren't they adorable?

2212
01:29:03,230 --> 01:29:04,429
Jalapenos.

2213
01:29:04,430 --> 01:29:06,660
- While they're cute...
- They're so cute.

2214
01:29:06,900 --> 01:29:08,700
I would've worn them had my ears been pierced.

2215
01:29:08,900 --> 01:29:11,270
But they haven't been pierced. I can't wear them.

2216
01:29:12,170 --> 01:29:13,800
My ears are pierced, but I don't want to wear them.

2217
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:15,640
Please wear one.

2218
01:29:16,210 --> 01:29:18,069
When I turn my head to the right,

2219
01:29:18,070 --> 01:29:19,410
the hat follows after a beat.

2220
01:29:20,410 --> 01:29:22,480
How do I fix the speed?

2221
01:29:23,180 --> 01:29:25,079
Take a look. Isn't it cute?

2222
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:26,880
(Kwang Soo remains silent.)

2223
01:29:26,950 --> 01:29:28,320
Let me check out other items.

2224
01:29:29,180 --> 01:29:30,250
Really?

2225
01:29:30,690 --> 01:29:32,649
- Let's look around.
- Okay.

2226
01:29:32,650 --> 01:29:33,719
There must be other items.

2227
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:34,790
(Hung up)

2228
01:29:35,090 --> 01:29:36,859
(They check out Mexican women's clothes.)

2229
01:29:36,860 --> 01:29:39,460
(Chuckling)

2230
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:42,969
- Why are you...
- I'm just putting it against you.

2231
01:29:42,970 --> 01:29:44,930
- I don't think it'll look bad.
- Don't be ridiculous.

2232
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:47,600
I see the items. Nacho libre.

2233
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:49,539
Not nacho libre.

2234
01:29:49,540 --> 01:29:50,670
- Lucha libre.
- Lucha libre.

2235
01:29:50,870 --> 01:29:52,070
Lucha?

2236
01:29:52,940 --> 01:29:54,610
- They look nice.
- What?

2237
01:29:54,940 --> 01:29:56,009
- The hats?
- Yes.

2238
01:29:56,010 --> 01:29:57,410
They look nice.

2239
01:29:57,680 --> 01:29:58,810
They're very big.

2240
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:01,420
Do you want to try on a mask?

2241
01:30:02,650 --> 01:30:05,220
Don't you want to feel the power?

2242
01:30:07,220 --> 01:30:08,220
- It's big.
- It's a T-shirt.

2243
01:30:08,221 --> 01:30:10,989
- You're right.
- On the back, there's a mask.

2244
01:30:10,990 --> 01:30:12,029
What a detail.

2245
01:30:12,030 --> 01:30:13,559
(On the back is the mask strap design.)

2246
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:15,030
It's the same as the mask.

2247
01:30:15,130 --> 01:30:16,400
Why don't we wear one each?

2248
01:30:16,430 --> 01:30:18,029
(The CEO is obsessed.)

2249
01:30:18,030 --> 01:30:19,100
It'll be a team uniform.

2250
01:30:19,170 --> 01:30:22,039
Kyung Soo, why don't we wear one each?

2251
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:23,210
A T-shirt? I love the idea.

2252
01:30:23,810 --> 01:30:24,939
How much is it?

2253
01:30:24,940 --> 01:30:26,610
- It's 14 dollars.
- Is it 14 dollars?

2254
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:29,080
Please give us a discount.

2255
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:30,850
It's too expensive.

2256
01:30:31,050 --> 01:30:34,249
It's a good price, but I'll make it 13 dollars for you.

2257
01:30:34,250 --> 01:30:35,320
Please.

2258
01:30:35,480 --> 01:30:36,990
Make it 11 dollars.

2259
01:30:37,020 --> 01:30:38,050
No, I can't.

2260
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:39,960
- Twelve.
- Thirteen.

2261
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:41,459
Shall we ask for a further discount for getting many?

2262
01:30:41,460 --> 01:30:42,860
Let's do that.

2263
01:30:43,460 --> 01:30:46,060
If we buy three,

2264
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:49,460
please make it 11 dollars each.

2265
01:30:49,670 --> 01:30:51,130
(Torn)

2266
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,939
If they buy 3, can we make it 11 dollars each?

2267
01:30:53,940 --> 01:30:55,140
They're having a meeting.

2268
01:30:55,470 --> 01:30:57,970
(They have an emergency meeting.)

2269
01:30:58,310 --> 01:30:59,469
- Yes?
- Okay.

2270
01:30:59,470 --> 01:31:01,479
Thank you. Then...

2271
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:04,310
(His negotiation skills make Kyung Soo clap.)

2272
01:31:04,380 --> 01:31:06,620
(Didn't you lose money?)

2273
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:10,120
Sometimes, it doesn't matter.

2274
01:31:10,220 --> 01:31:13,189
- It doesn't matter?
- Even if the profits are small,

2275
01:31:13,190 --> 01:31:14,959
they still benefit us.

2276
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:17,559
What's important isn't the trade,

2277
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:20,260
but making the foreigners learn about our culture.

2278
01:31:20,330 --> 01:31:24,200
They'll speak nicely of us.

2279
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:26,769
Then more people will want to buy our handmade goods.

2280
01:31:26,770 --> 01:31:29,240
That's where the true profit lies.

2281
01:31:30,210 --> 01:31:32,910
The total is 33 dollars. Your signature, please.

2282
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:37,710
The first Spanish phrase I learned was, "Please give me a discount."

2283
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:40,679
- Please.
- How do you say it?

2284
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:41,920
I succeeded in getting a discount.

2285
01:31:42,450 --> 01:31:44,650
"Por favor, deme un descuento."

2286
01:31:45,450 --> 01:31:46,820
"Please give me a discount."

2287
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:49,290
I got the receipt as well.

2288
01:31:50,290 --> 01:31:51,429
(It's precious.)

2289
01:31:51,430 --> 01:31:52,560
Yes.

2290
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:58,770
(He thought he had been perfect with negotiations and calculations.)

2291
01:31:59,270 --> 01:32:02,200
(Is there a problem with the way the auditor works?)

2292
01:32:02,270 --> 01:32:04,339
(If you write it down...)

2293
01:32:04,340 --> 01:32:06,010
(Are you going to write down any amount?)

2294
01:32:06,510 --> 01:32:07,880
(What's up with that tone?)

2295
01:32:07,910 --> 01:32:09,510
(Hurt)

2296
01:32:10,110 --> 01:32:12,150
(A dispute between the members and the head office begins.)

2297
01:32:12,550 --> 01:32:13,879
(The seed of dispute spreads even to the expedition.)

2298
01:32:13,880 --> 01:32:14,880
(Then I'll look for another taco.)

2299
01:32:14,881 --> 01:32:15,980
(Stop it already.)

2300
01:32:16,850 --> 01:32:19,690
(The taco journey won't end until they get a hit.)

2301
01:32:19,790 --> 01:32:22,620
(Let's say the tripe taco is a bit disappointing.)

2302
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:25,260
(Then I'll look for another taco.)

2303
01:32:25,430 --> 01:32:27,430
Let's go. One, two, three.

2304
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:29,460
(What will lie at the end of the long taco journey?)

2305
01:32:29,830 --> 01:32:31,630
(The grand tour that'll put all the disputes to rest)

2306
01:32:31,730 --> 01:32:32,799
(I think it'll be really pretty.)

2307
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:34,340
(I'm excited because I think it'll be worth 1,100 dollars.)

2308
01:32:34,470 --> 01:32:35,499
(It's the most amount of money we've spent.)

2309
01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:36,840
(The most amount of money they've spent during the expedition)

2310
01:32:37,410 --> 01:32:38,970
(They used what little money they had...)

2311
01:32:39,510 --> 01:32:42,280
(to take a hot-air balloon ride.)

2312
01:32:42,340 --> 01:32:44,810
(However,)

2313
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:46,650
(CEO Lee looks troubled.)

2314
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:48,419
(Kwang Soo, get up and look.)

2315
01:32:48,420 --> 01:32:49,750
(You got paid to be on the show.)

2316
01:32:50,050 --> 01:32:51,119
(Who cares about that?)

2317
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:52,619
(The disputes are endless.)

2318
01:32:52,620 --> 01:32:53,890
(His sensitivity is at 100 percent.)

2319
01:32:54,090 --> 01:32:55,589
(It'll be better to keep filming without stopping.)

2320
01:32:55,590 --> 01:32:57,060
(We need to enjoy the view too.)

2321
01:32:58,390 --> 01:33:00,830
I can't do this tour, okay?

2322
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:06,029
