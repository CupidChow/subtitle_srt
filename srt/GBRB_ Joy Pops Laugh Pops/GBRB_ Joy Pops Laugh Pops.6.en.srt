(KKPP International Expedition)

7
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,790
(With high expectations, they went to...)

8
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,059
How is it?

9
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,860
(the first accommodation in Cancun.)

10
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,859
(However)

11
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,030
- What?
- Why are there so many ants?

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,800
(The expedition team suddenly had to live with ants.)

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,370
Let's hurry up and leave.

14
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,970
(Their Cancun expedition went wrong from the start.)

15
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:47,810
Shouldn't we eat lobster ramen?

16
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,240
It's 40 dollars.

17
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,740
(On top of that, things were insanely expensive in Cancun.)

18
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:53,909
Give us more money!

19
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,910
(They ended up asking the head office for help.)

20
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:01,090
(Thus, the expedition team made a video of the current situation.)

21
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:02,750
Two staff members...

22
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,559
had a nosebleed yesterday.

23
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,890
(They asked for special expenses.)

24
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,389
(Amidst that)

25
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,360
There's nothing more to come out.

26
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,330
We need to buy large diapers at a supermarket.

27
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,300
(Traveler's diarrhea left them haggard during the night.)

28
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,440
(Instead of going on the whale shark tour,)

29
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,909
(they headed to Rio Lagartos,)

30
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:24,940
(the paradise of wild animals!)

31
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:27,609
I think it's hotter than yesterday.

32
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:28,810
By the way,

33
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,680
why did you take toilet paper rolls?

34
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,350
We need to save any money we can.

35
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,690
On top of saving money,

36
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,660
we don't know when we'll have another emergency.

37
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:42,390
We plan to lay some toilet paper in the car...

38
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,000
like a dog pad.

39
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,200
(The expedition team finally escapes from the lodging.)

40
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,639
It's automatic.

41
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,840
The sun is scorching today.

42
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,110
It's really hot today.

43
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,240
It's 42°C outside.

44
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,179
- Don't overexert yourselves.
- Okay.

45
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,179
If we turn on the hazard lights...

46
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,679
and pull over on the shoulder...

47
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,020
Run to the bushes.

48
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:09,720
Then turn off all the cameras. I'm serious.

49
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,560
(Today's expedition starts with unsteady bowels.)

50
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,659
We'll eat in the car, right?

51
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,830
Yes, we'll eat on the road.

52
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,859
What kind of burger will you eat?

53
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,929
A regular cheeseburger is really tasty too.

54
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,030
That's right.

55
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,440
We need to choose quickly.

56
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,840
Wouldn't they understand English?

57
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,239
Hello.

58
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,410
Hello. May I help you with your order?

59
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,109
(Well...)

60
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,880
One Quarter Pounder with Cheese.

61
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,849
(For some reason, there's no answer.)

62
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,190
One moment.

63
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,060
I guess he doesn't speak English.

64
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,859
Please move to the next window...

65
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,260
so that we can help with your order.

66
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,500
Just one Quarter Pounder with Cheese combo.

67
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,829
(Both parties are saying what they want to say.)

68
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,670
Please move to the next window.

69
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,040
(They don't understand.)

70
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,879
(Is it my turn?)

71
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,479
- Do we need to order a combo?
- One Quarter...

72
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,449
One Quarter Pounder cheesecake.

73
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,079
(Cake?)

74
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,979
One Quarter Pounder cheesecake.

75
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,480
I mean, cheeseburger.

76
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,219
One Quarter Pounder...

77
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,790
One Quarter Pounder cheeseburger.

78
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,160
(Director helps as well.)

79
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,560
Kwang Soo.

80
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,159
We'll go there.

81
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,259
Let's turn the car around.

82
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,900
- Let's buy it in person.
- Okay.

83
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,799
- To the front?
- Let's go.

84
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,570
(Auditor suggests that they order in person.)

85
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,969
One Quarter Pounder cheeseburger.

86
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,169
(Hung up)

87
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,740
- Stop it.
- Hurry up and go.

88
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,709
(The expedition team enters the burger place.)

89
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,850
It's cool inside.

90
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,419
(Impressed)

91
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,280
- It's nice.
- Hey, pancakes look good too.

92
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:48,649
Why are there so many kinds?

93
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,219
It's in a nacho style.

94
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,120
- You're right.
- It's a burger in a taco style.

95
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,389
- It looks tasty.
- There's ice cream.

96
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,089
- We must eat this.
- I said that I wanted to eat it...

97
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,160
from the very first day.

98
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,360
Will our stomachs be okay?

99
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,900
We'll eat pancakes, right?

100
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,700
Order one iced coffee.

101
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,299
Let's buy one burrito.

102
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,569
Let's buy one burrito and have a bite each.

103
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:07,970
This burger will be tiny anyway.

104
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,270
This one? A burrito?

105
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,039
Do you want a burrito or this one?

106
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,240
(CEO Lee forgets about having no funds and goes all out.)

107
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,650
We came to McDonald's because we didn't have money.

108
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,979
(Unhappy)

109
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,850
I think they'll taste...

110
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,949
similar.

111
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,020
(Sighing)

112
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,290
I hate worrying about such things.

113
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,160
Can you go without an apple pie?

114
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,970
- Don't you like apple pies?
- Stop it.

115
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,169
(His feelings are hurt.)

116
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,440
There's Coke Zero Sugar.

117
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,400
Kwang Soo, drink Coke Zero Sugar.

118
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,269
Let's make this large.

119
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,580
(They pacify CEO Lee with Coke Zero Sugar.)

120
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,609
Instead of purchasing the beverage in the cart,

121
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,850
we should turn this into a combo.

122
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,580
- I think it'll be cheaper.
- You're right.

123
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,250
- Will that be all? We're done.
- Yes.

124
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,360
- We're totally bankrupt.
- Then...

125
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,259
(They complete the order through a kiosk.)

126
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,460
It'll be tasty.

127
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,159
- I'll use the restroom.
- Okay.

128
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,599
(Woo Bin leaves his belongings and goes to the restroom.)

129
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,130
Don't throw out the receipt.

130
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:11,800
What's that?

131
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,710
They had a collaboration with Sprite.

132
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,610
(Entranced by the new menu, CEO Lee disappears.)

133
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,680
(He can't tear his eyes from the promotional sign.)

134
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,450
- Kwang Soo.
- It looks so tasty.

135
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,380
- It's zero sugar.
- Is it zero sugar?

136
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,250
Aren't you going to drink it?

137
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,859
- It only exists in Mexico.
- I want to try it.

138
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,489
If you don't try it now, you'll never get a chance.

139
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,790
- Never.
- Woo Bin isn't here.

140
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,259
(Woo Bin's wallet)

141
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,260
Is there a card?

142
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:40,100
(They end up touching the auditor's wallet.)

143
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,570
Here.

144
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,199
It's this one. Do you want the blueberry one or what?

145
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,769
- The apple one.
- Apple?

146
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,300
Do you want an apple pie?

147
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,309
Order it if you want.

148
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,869
(They're like brothers who stole their mom's wallet.)

149
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,439
No, it'll be better not to eat it.

150
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,940
(Mom is coming.)

151
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,080
Do you want it?

152
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,750
Oh, my.

153
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,050
(He spots his wallet.)

154
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,580
(Sighing)

155
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,150
(Handing over the wallet)

156
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,290
What are you doing?

157
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,420
What are you doing?

158
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:10,960
- Are you okay?
- What did you order?

159
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,460
- What did you order?
- Who suggested this?

160
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,229
(He checks the items in the cart.)

161
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:18,140
(Anxious)

162
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,709
(It was his doing.)

163
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:22,970
- You.
- Don't look at me.

164
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,239
I won't let it slide, okay?

165
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,050
(He's an accomplice.)

166
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,950
You can only get it in Mexico.

167
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,549
The apple one.

168
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,850
(Auitor pays for the items in the end.)

169
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:38,459
Why are there so many tasty-looking items?

170
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,860
(The reason behind the deviation)

171
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,160
(After the quick deviation)

172
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,959
What? Kwang Soo.

173
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,499
I received 11 consumption lottery tickets.

174
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,030
Hey, see?

175
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:51,899
When you're generous...

176
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,440
(You received 3.2 cents.)

177
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:54,940
- You can win 1.2 cents.
- I received 3.2 cents.

178
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,310
I received 3.2 cents.

179
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,280
(High-five of happiness)

180
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,239
- You had a big prize, 1.2 cents.
- You're right.

181
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,350
(Every cent matters in the current situation.)

182
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,279
Our order is ready. Number 665.

183
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,480
(While they scratched the tickets, their food got ready.)

184
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,919
Number 661.

185
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,560
(They go to pick up their order.)

186
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,830
(CEO Lee receives the ice cream he has ordered.)

187
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,499
This isn't McFlurry.

188
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,840
(It's different from the ice cream they know.)

189
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,870
Don't they blend them?

190
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,280
(In the Mexican version, ice cream is just topped with chocolate.)

191
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,280
Don't they blend the toppings for McFlurry?

192
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,310
(CEO Lee is flustered.)

193
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,950
It's not McFlurry.

194
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,679
Right?

195
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,219
That's McFlurry.

196
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,420
- McFlurry?
- Yes.

197
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,289
- Yes.
- No?

198
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,859
No. Only milkshake.

199
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,659
I see. Milkshake.

200
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,229
- Okay.
- They do it differently.

201
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,529
- Okay. Thank you.
- Sorry.

202
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:51,560
No, it's okay.

203
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,869
- Shall I shake your McFlurry?
- Yes.

204
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,529
- Shake it?
- Yes. It's okay.

205
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:57,729
Okay. Thank you.

206
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:58,899
She'll shake it.

207
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,870
(The kind employee offers to shake the ice cream.)

208
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:05,380
(A bit later, the employee comes back.)

209
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,850
Sorry, but this...

210
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,880
It doesn't look so good.

211
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,120
What's this?

212
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:17,220
(The ice cream comes back looking like gukbap.)

213
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,789
If you mix the top,

214
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,230
it'll be like McFlurry.

215
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:24,629
- Okay.
- If you shake it...

216
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,999
- Thank you.
- Okay.

217
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Thank you.

218
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,330
- Don't mention it.
- Thank you.

219
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:30,999
Let's go.

220
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,670
(Thanks to the kind employee, they set off with ice cream.)

221
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:36,870
This is the correct route, right?

222
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,710
I think it does take 3 hours and 5 minutes.

223
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,749
Kwang Soo, good luck.

224
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,949
(Itinerary of the day: Cancun, Rio Lagartos, Playa del Carmen)

225
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,750
- Let's switch on the way.
- Okay.

226
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,749
(An eating show starts in the back as soon as they hit the road.)

227
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,890
Thank you for the food.

228
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,159
(Since the cameras at the front seat got destroyed due to the heat,)

229
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,389
(you'll only see Kyung Soo for the next 36 seconds.)

230
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,690
- Do you want your burger?
- Yes.

231
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:56,530
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes?

232
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,000
It's really tasty.

233
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,960
It's a burger, but it tastes Mexican.

234
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,000
- The bacon is different too.
- Really?

235
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,069
And they fry the egg so that it becomes tasty.

236
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,140
I see.

237
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,770
Kyung Soo, do you want to try some coffee?

238
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,710
It's a bit hot.

239
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,210
(Screaming)

240
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,249
I burned my tongue and the roof of my mouth.

241
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,620
- What?
- I burned everything.

242
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,019
(Laughing)

243
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,890
- I told you that it was hot.
- I drank it the moment you said it.

244
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,060
(Despite the burn, Director eats with gusto.)

245
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,300
(They drive for a while.)

246
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,970
Isn't this a rest area?

247
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,139
- Shall we stop here for a while?
- Okay.

248
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,810
(They decide to stop at a rest area.)

249
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,580
Did all three cameras at the front turn off?

250
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:51,280
All three cameras turned off.

251
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,280
- Oh, my.
- How did that happen?

252
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,219
Is it because the sunlight is strong?

253
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,250
(They belatedly learned that all the front cameras were gone.)

254
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,920
Shall I press the button?

255
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,660
Okay.

256
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:02,360
(Checking the camera)

257
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,030
Shall we hit the road?

258
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,900
- The weather is insane.
- My goodness.

259
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,200
I've never seen anything like it. Go straight for 135km.

260
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,610
(It seems like it'll be a long journey.)

261
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,339
- Shall we listen to a song?
- Yes.

262
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,640
- That sounds good.
- Yes. Driving makes you sleepy.

263
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,410
- Good.
- Let's do this.

264
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,109
Let's guess if the number one song in Mexico...

265
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,319
is upbeat or calm.

266
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,190
- Okay.
- The loser...

267
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,090
needs to drive on our way back. How about that?

268
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,820
What?

269
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,329
Is the current number one song in Mexico...

270
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,759
- Okay.
- upbeat or calm?

271
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,860
I see.

272
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,229
I'll go with upbeat.

273
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,899
- I'll go with calm.
- Okay.

274
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,500
A ballad song.

275
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,900
A sad song.

276
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,640
- A sad song?
- Yes.

277
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,240
If it's a ballad song, you need to drive on our way back.

278
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,540
For the entire journey?

279
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:56,180
For a large chunk of the journey.

280
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,350
Okay.

281
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,480
Let's go with 2 to 1.

282
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,620
- Okay.
- The journey takes three hours.

283
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,719
- One hour versus two hours.
- Okay.

284
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,920
(The CEO and auditor's driving bet is on.)

285
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,260
Let's check out the title.

286
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,790
Hey, I think it's game over.

287
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,260
"Tutankamon."

288
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,460
- "Tutankamon?" - "Tutankamon?"

289
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:14,700
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

290
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,300
Why am I nervous?

291
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,479
You don't know yet.

292
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,839
It's upbeat already, Kwang Soo.

293
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,380
- You don't know yet.
- I'm dancing.

294
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,080
"You don't know yet."

295
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,220
Once the song begins...

296
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,250
Didn't it begin already?

297
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:38,220
- Not yet. It's a narration.
- Okay.

298
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,660
(Everyone except for one is moving to the rhythm.)

299
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,430
We've had this narration for 40 seconds.

300
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,360
This is incredible.

301
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,130
In "Forever" by SKY...

302
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,899
- Yes!
- Yes!

303
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,310
(I'm ruined.)

304
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:56,940
Hey!

305
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:00,940
He's a rapper. It's rap. Hip-hop.

306
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,549
(He'll drive twice as much.)

307
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,780
- Hey!
- How is it so upbeat?

308
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,850
You can't do anything about it.

309
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,890
(They can't help but groove.)

310
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,830
(His excitement level skyrockets.)

311
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:20,630
(The driving bet ends in Woo Bin's victory.)

312
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,670
I'll play the song that suddenly entered my brain.

313
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:25,800
Okay.

314
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,870
How nice.

315
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:31,810
It's a great song.

316
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,180
(His choice of a song has the traveling vibes.)

317
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:49,430
(Take me on)

318
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:54,230
(I'll be gone)

319
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:58,300
(The falsetto you want to hit)

320
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:02,370
(The falsetto you can hit)

321
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:06,210
You're the only one who can copy that.

322
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:11,780
(They briefly forgot about Director's main job.)

323
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,950
Do you want to listen to this?

324
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,120
By the time the show airs,

325
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:18,160
this song will have been released.

326
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:22,230
See if it's a good song to listen to while driving.

327
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,730
- Here it comes.
- Okay.

328
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:29,830
("Dumb" by Doh Kyung Soo featuring PENOMECO)

329
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:36,470
(Even the intro makes you dance.)

330
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:38,780
- Is it your song?
- Yes.

331
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,240
- It's so nice.
- It's nice.

332
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,280
He's PENOMECO.

333
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:47,320
(This is definitely toxic, I'm so unstable)

334
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:55,360
(This is Kyung Soo's song?)

335
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:57,929
(I'm going to mess it up anyway)

336
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:00,260
(If you don't like it, go on and do it too)

337
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:07,140
(So dumb, so what?)

338
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,810
- I love it.
- Nice.

339
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,339
- That's how it goes.
- Gosh.

340
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,649
- Incredible.
- Was it good?

341
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:16,779
It's totally up my street.

342
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,319
I'm in love with such songs these days.

343
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,849
- I'm glad.
- Like a rock song.

344
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,819
It's the most upbeat among all your songs.

345
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,020
- Really?
- For real.

346
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,719
It's really the funkiest one.

347
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,959
- Exactly.
- We can finally bob...

348
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,220
during your concert.

349
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,160
- Shall we listen to this?
- What?

350
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,659
Which one is next?

351
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,300
(Continuing the vibe with the next song)

352
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,329
- Nice.
- Cho Yong Pil?

353
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:36,669
- Great.
- It's always...

354
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,400
the first song I sing at karaoke.

355
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:44,140
(The karaoke on the road begins.)

356
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,950
(The human castanets appear.)

357
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,079
(On the green hill)

358
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,579

00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:07,980
Tomatoes.

543
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:11,250
- I think those are enough.
- The watermelons are long.

544
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,790
Look at this one.

545
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,259
- The cucumbers are thick.
- Goodness.

546
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,260
They're thick...

547
00:22:16,261 --> 00:22:17,289
- Is that really a cucumber?
- and look like zucchini.

548
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:18,999
This was what was inside our ceviche yesterday.

549
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,360
Really?

550
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,669
What's this? Sweet potatoes?

551
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:23,870
Looks like it.

552
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,770
The sweet potatoes are huge.

553
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,339
One would make three portions.

554
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:32,240
Ours was this big in Girin-myeon.

555
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,010
(CEO Lee still has his pride as a farmer.)

556
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,109
There aren't any mangos.

557
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,220
Mango...

558
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,720
(What was "excuse me" again?)

559
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,419
- Dolpe...
- What?

560
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,720
Dosculpe.

561
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,560
- Disculpe.
- Disculpe.

562
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,160
(It's taking forever for him to memorize it.)

563
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,030
Mango.

564
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:53,400
The mangos are here.

565
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,470
We can have these.

566
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,300
- These should do.
- You're right.

567
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,340
- Let's get three.
- Two...

568
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,239
Two?

569
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,240
Two should be enough.

570
00:23:03,241 --> 00:23:04,539
Is the black part okay?

571
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,379
Yes, it's ripe. The mango is ripe.

572
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,940
- It's just like bananas.
- Great.

573
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,750
- What's this?
- Do you want dragonfruits?

574
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,380
- That's probably...
- How do you peel that?

575
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:15,120
It's probably the really spicy chili.

576
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,989
- It looks like it.
- It must be habanero.

577
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:19,990
Really?

578
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,190
(Smelling)

579
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:24,659
It smells of nothing.

580
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,130
It doesn't have a smell.

581
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:29,870
Can I try it?

582
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,070
- One.
- It's one peso.

583
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,370
- One.
- One.

584
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:37,009
(It's time to pay.)

585
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:38,240
How much is it?

586
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,139
Excuse me,

587
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,380
could you write this?

588
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,009
- Receipt.
- Yes.

589
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:46,520
(Not forgetting the receipt)

590
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:53,259
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

591
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,360
Thank you.

592
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,790
(They made sure to get the cash receipt.)

593
00:23:58,330 --> 00:23:59,600
- Bye.
- Bye.

594
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,700
(Not forgetting to express their gratitude)

595
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,700
The banana is really plump.

596
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:10,770
Kwang Soo, shall we have a bite of this before we eat the banana?

597
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,410
I bet it'd be really spicy.

598
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,340
- One bite?
- Yes.

599
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,110
- Just this much.
- Curious, aren't we?

600
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,850
Rock-paper-scissors.

601
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,080
(The one who suggests always loses.)

602
00:24:20,081 --> 00:24:21,220
You love eating.

603
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:24,090
(Kyung Soo takes a bite without hesitation.)

604
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,320
It's just cucumber chili.

605
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,630
Right? It's like an unripe chili.

606
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,159
- It's good.
- Like one you dip in ssamjang.

607
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,230
- Really?
- It...

608
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,930
tastes and smells something like between chili and bell pepper.

609
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,229
It's delicious. It's not spicy at all.

610
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,570
The banana is amazing.

611
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,969
It's really sweet.

612
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:42,040
(Verification complete)

613
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:45,040
(It turned out to be sweet chili, chile dulce.)

614
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,210
Jun Wi came to watch whether we got the receipt or not.

615
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:52,849
- Why are you watching us?
- Take some.

616
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:54,080
- It's really good.
- Thank you.

617
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,160
- It's good, right?
- Yes.

618
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:01,959
(The expedition team even shares a banana.)

619
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,630
Even the banana is different.

620
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:05,660
It's really good.

621
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,530
- Is it?
- Isn't it delicious?

622
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:10,000
I'll see you when we settle the balance.

623
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:12,470
(He had a scheme.)

624
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:14,499
(The KKPP food expedition team is back in the car.)

625
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,740
(Feeling hot)

626
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,380
We also have water.

627
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,080
What would you like?

628
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,909
- I'm fine with anything.
- It's good.

629
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:24,179
- Water.
- Water?

630
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,849
(CEO Lee tastes the drink from the auditor.)

631
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:26,880
Strong, isn't it?

632
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,890
The drink is really fizzy.

633
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:30,950
It's summer.

634
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,819
- Import it in Korea and...
- It's really refreshing.

635
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,890
(The expedition team savors the snacks.)

636
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,360
(It's cracker time after the drinks.)

637
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:41,430
Why is the snack...

638
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:43,830
It's really red.

639
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:46,440
Is it originally this color?

640
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,000
On three, okay?

641
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,210
One, two, three.

642
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:52,940
(They taste Mexico's beloved snack.)

643
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,080
- We...
- Gosh.

644
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,540
Is it spicy?

645
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,410
It's not spicy but tangy.

646
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:59,419
This is an authentic Mexican snack.

647
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:02,180
Sour and salty, it's right up a Mexican's alley.

648
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:05,350
You can't even taste an ounce of sweetness.

649
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,489
- Really?
- How can a snack...

650
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:08,960
- taste like this?
- Kwang Soo, can I have a small one?

651
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:11,759
(Biting)

652
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,599
- But it's good.
- It's tingly,

653
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,799
- Right?
- like you feel the static.

654
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,700
- This is...
- It's like sour candy.

655
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:19,269
Leave this in the car and have it whenever you're sleepy...

656
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,339
- It'll wake you up.
- Exactly.

657
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,399
It's actually good.

658
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,510
- Right?
- Yes.

659
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:25,569
Cheetos isn't Mexican, is it?

660
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:27,140
- Takis is...
- Isn't it spicy?

661
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:29,010
Good grief.

662
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:31,209
- For real?
- What's this?

663
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:33,250
- What is it? Show me.
- Isn't this just food coloring?

664
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,479
This color is a first.

665
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,520
What is it?

666
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:36,850
Seriously?

667
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,720
Isn't this a spoon worm?

668
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:45,330
- Just look at the color.
- It's beet red.

669
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:46,700
- It's even close to purple.
- In 1, 2, and 3.

670
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:49,430
(How's the Mexican spoon worm snack?)

671
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,330
(Impressed)

672
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:53,199
It's really good.

673
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,769
- Is it?
- This one is better.

674
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:56,570
- This tastes better.
- Really?

675
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:59,909
If Takis is eaten by enthusiasts,

676
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,279
Cheetos can be eaten...

677
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,650
- by the general public.
- You're right.

678
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:06,420
(CEO Lee cuts off a piece for the auditor who's curious.)

679
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,580
It's kind of like...

680
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,719
Here's what it reminded me of.

681
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,590
When I was little, I couldn't handle spiciness.

682
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:13,789
So my mom licked the seasoning off...

683
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,590
of kkakdugi and put it in my mouth.

684
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,190
Feeding you just now felt like it.

685
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,630
It suddenly made me miss my mom.

686
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,730
How dare you stir up my filial love?

687
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:29,370
(As they keep driving with Kwang Soo missing his mom)

688
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:32,270
We have 30km left.

689
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,110
- We're almost there.
- Yes.

690
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,249
- We're more than halfway there.
- Exactly.

691
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:37,710
(30 more minutes until Rio Lagartos)

692
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:39,680
What are we having for dinner today?

693
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:41,150
What should we have?

694
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,150
Shouldn't we eat near our accommodation?

695
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,419
If CEO Ko sent us some money,

696
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,460
we could get...

697
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:50,729
- Something nice?
- something nice.

698
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:52,729
No, let's not do that yet.

699
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:53,799
- Let's do it.
- If...

700
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,330
Why have you changed so much?

701
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,730
If he didn't send anything,

702
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,300
we'd have to get tacos again.

703
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,540
- We should keep that in mind.
- No tacos.

704
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,209
(CEO Lee checks if CEO Ko has replied.)

705
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,280
Did he email you back?

706
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,740
What?

707
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:11,080
I never thought he'd send...

708
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:12,980
such a formal reply.

709
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:15,579
- What is it?
- "Originating department KKPP..."

710
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,650
What's this?

711
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:19,759
(Last night, the expedition team...)

712
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,890
(sent a special expense request form to CEO Ko.)

713
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:24,160
"Actually, Writer Hye Rin is quite sick."

714
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:26,700
"Two of the staff members..."

715
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,629
"had a nosebleed yesterday."

716
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:30,500
"Here are our honest words, CEO Ko."

717
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,730
Nice.

718
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:33,440
"We've used up all our money."

719
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:40,080
(The expedition team blindly asked for 5,000 dollars.)

720
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,640
Feeling nervous.

721
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,009
Please.

722
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:45,780
(Straightening both his posture and his mindset)

723
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,819
"Here's my opinion about the special expense request."

724
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,320
"Hello, CEO Lee."

725
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,819
"I've reviewed the special expense request..."

726
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,360
"official document, photos, and videos you sent."

727
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,790
He's already too serious.

728
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,299
"After much consideration, I'm sending you my opinion..."

729
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,830
"regarding the special expense request."

730
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,030
Gosh.

731
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,869
"Please refer to the attached document for the details."

732
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:08,940
"Thank you."

733
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,339
- What is it?
- "Originating department KKPP..."

734
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,410
What's this?

735
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:15,480
- He stuck to the fixed form...
- Couldn't he have just...

736
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,350
"Originating." What does that mean?

737
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:19,820
"Drafted by CEO Lee."

738
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:22,020
There's not a single blank space.

739
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,190
What does "rejected" mean?

740
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:29,359
Judging by how it's marked in red, he disagrees.

741
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,289
"Rejected" means he turned it down.

742
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:32,700
Isn't that his opinion?

743
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:35,930
- It means no.
- We've been rejected.

744
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,170
"Rejected..."

745
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:41,940
(Speechless)

746
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,509
(He continues reading.)

747
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,670
"Reason for rejection."

748
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,739
"Official documents should stick..."

749
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,010
"to facts and the basic reporting principles."

750
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:52,680
"Your request form,"

751
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:55,120
"in short, doesn't meet these."

752
00:29:58,490 --> 00:29:59,620
So,

753
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:02,420
he's taking this...

754
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:04,860
as a real situation...

755
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,830
and is being serious about it, right?

756
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,430
"First, your official document..."

757
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,570
"contains many unnecessary details."

758
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,910
"When submitting such documents,"

759
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,540
"focus on the facts, not emotions, so I can make..."

760
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,280
"a fair judgment."

761
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,879
"Staying in such poor lodging..."

762
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,580
"was your own choice."

763
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,480
(Scratching)

764
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,420
Why does he have to put it so harshly?

765
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,950
It really stings.

766
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:35,659
"Additionally, if you wished to stay in better accommodations in Cancun,"

767
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,959
"you should have urgently requested..."

768
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,430
"additional expenses before traveling there."

769
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,330
He's scolding me right now, isn't he?

770
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:45,570
He's not giving compliments.

771
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:47,300
But here's the thing.

772
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,739
We didn't request special expenses...

773
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,939
because we wanted to try our best and save...

774
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,709
- as much as we could first.
- Exactly.

775
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:56,349
If we could have requested them every time,

776
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,680
we would've done it...

777
00:30:58,410 --> 00:30:59,650
much earlier.

778
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:03,020
- It hurt.
- The unexpected reaction?

779
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,360
It hurt because...

780
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,290
he was too formal.

781
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,060
As a subcontractor,

782
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:14,600
I thought we had a pretty good relationship.

783
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:18,130
But I never expected him to be so cold.

784
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,170
"I didn't tell you to stay in that poor accommodation."

785
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:26,040
We chose that house to save on expenses.

786
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,450
Do you think we did it just for fun?

787
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,850
I...

788
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,749
Why am I crying? What?

789
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:38,389
(The emotional auditor has been hurt.)

790
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:39,590
I've been deeply hurt.

791
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,560
I personally think CEO Ko is right.

792
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,930
(The thinking-type director thinks differently.)

793
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,500
I actually prefer precision.

794
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,670
I don't like it when too much emotion is added.

795
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,770
As employees, we should do our best.

796
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:58,710
(A social life moment of the extreme thinker)

797
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:02,079
We would've done it much earlier.

798
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,849
"Due to your decision, even the production crew..."

799
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:05,650
"ended up in a difficult situation."

800
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:08,950
"And in particular, Writer Hye Rin became extremely unwell."

801
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,350
For real?

802
00:32:10,351 --> 00:32:12,660
- That must've shocked CEO Ko.
- Unbelievable.

803
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:16,730
I'm losing it. I can't hold back anymore.

804
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:19,130
I, CEO Lee, can no longer hold back!

805
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,270
"You are the leader of KKPP Foods."

806
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:27,070
"You are also the head of the entire expedition team,"

807
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,470
"including the production staff."

808
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,509
"I ask that you take responsibility..."

809
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:33,040
"and ensure that no such incidents occur for the remainder of..."

810
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,510
"the cultural expedition." The end.

811
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,820
In other words, he's not approving any money.

812
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,219
"Rejected" means you have to submit it again.

813
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,720
So resend it following the proper form.

814
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:48,990
The e-mail that we sent wasn't all that bad.

815
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,829
- Either way, - The first one?

816
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:52,130
- we kind of spoke to his heart.
- True.

817
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:55,299
- We've stirred his heart a bit.
- Exactly.

818
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:58,199
- Now...
- CEO Ko doesn't like long details.

819
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,570
Let's send a neat and efficient one.

820
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:03,139
Kwang Soo, let's rewrite it following the six basic principles.

821
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,910
How much money do we have left?

822
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,680
Currently...

823
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,480
To Jun Wi, we...

824
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:12,249
Offered a bribe? Returned?

825
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,849
- "Offered a bribe?" - What do I say?

826
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:15,779
- Is he a gangster?
- What...

827
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,289
- To Jun Wi...
- To Jun Wi...

828
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:18,819
(They have to repay the flight cost to the senior accountant.)

829
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,820
- What was that again?
- Paying back...

830
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:23,589
Is it what we pay at check-out?

831
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:25,430
I don't know what it is.

832
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,700
Search Airbnb, Kwang Soo.

833
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,730
- Scroll down.
- Is it here?

834
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:33,270
- There?
- Yes.

835
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,439
- Kwang Soo, hand it to me.
- Right.

836
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,570
You do it, Kyung Soo.

837
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:39,910
Kwang Soo, hand it to me.

838
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,079
- Give me a second.
- Hand it to me.

839
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,750
Kwang Soo doesn't let go easily.

840
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:46,749
He has his pride.

841
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,020
He really acts on pride.

842
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:51,949
I told you. It's not there.

843
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,520
(I told you. It's not there!)

844
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:54,990
Hold on a second.

845
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:58,190
(CEO Lee is stripped of his qualification.)

846
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:02,360
The total charge was 497.35 dollars,

847
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,030
so I will just consider it as 500 dollars, okay?

848
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:06,469
- Then how much is it?
- Then...

849
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:08,800
Did we have 850 dollars?

850
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,609
Then we have 805.22 dollars left.

851
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:12,670
(They have about 800 dollars left after the flight and accommodation.)

852
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:16,079
"The reason the funds ran out faster than expected."

853
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,580
(CEO Ko's request)

854
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:20,220
What else did we do? Trying different food...

855
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,250
and exploring cultural sites.

856
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:26,090
I think we need to tell him about the flight costs.

857
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,059
That was actually the biggest part.

858
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,260
- It was big.
- You're right.

859
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:31,460
We hardly took taxis.

860
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,829
- We only rode the metro.
- Yes.

861
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:34,630
Yes, we only took it when we really needed to.

862
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,270
With all that luggage.

863
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:40,399
(Auditor Kim recalls the rough times they had in Mexico City.)

864
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,540
Yes.

865
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:44,310
"To be honest,"

866
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,110
"the funds..."

867
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,980
"were not..."

868
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:50,880
"insufficient."

869
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:54,120
"Nonetheless..."

870
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,020
"Mexico's traditions..."

871
00:34:58,490 --> 00:34:59,690
"and culture..."

872
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,990
No, "The strong interest in their culture."

873
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:07,159
(A dry laugh)

874
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,199
Isn't it getting too long again?

875
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,430
(He didn't even get to the main part about the flight and accommodation.)

876
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:13,170
Let's just make it long.

877
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,340
Why does it have to be short?

878
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,509
Yes, we have our own style.

879
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:19,609
Why do I have to match him?

880
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:21,840
Why do I have to match CEO Ko's style?

881
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:23,780
I'm CEO Lee, as well.

882
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:25,610
We are in the same position.

883
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:28,120
Gosh.

884
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:32,390
"To be honest, the funds were not insufficient."

885
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,719
(Endlessly circling the intro)

886
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,860
(CEO Lee can't keep it concise.)

887
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,859
(Director Doh was peeking from behind.)

888
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,699
- "Desire?" Kwang Soo.
- Yes?

889
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,299
Why are you mentioning "desire to eat and sleep?"

890
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,569
This is a must.

891
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:46,869
- "Desire to eat and sleep?" - Look.

892
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:48,769
I kept it as simple as possible.

893
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:50,039
What in the world did you write?

894
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,370
"We traveled with a lot of luggage while using public transportation,"

895
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,639
"held back our desire to eat and sleep,"

896
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,110
"but the funds eventually ran out."

897
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:57,479
Should I remove that?

898
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,879
- I think you should remove that.
- He will say I'm being emotional.

899
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,080
That's emotion.

900
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,749
It feels like such a waste to erase what I wrote.

901
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:04,820
I can’t erase it.

902
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:07,060
"To be honest, the funds were not insufficient."

903
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:08,120
"Nonetheless,"

904
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,860
"due to trying different foods,"

905
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:11,330
"exploring cultural sites,"

906
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,530
"and travel costs to Cancun,"

907
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,870
"we traveled with a lot of luggage while using public transportation."

908
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,039
What are you saying?

909
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,700
Wait, give me a bit more time.

910
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:25,209
"Nonetheless" was good.

911
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:26,339
It's nice to say that in the beginning.

912
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,409
And "greatly aspired" was good too, right?

913
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:28,610
Yes, that was good.

914
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:31,479
"To be honest, the funds were not insufficient."

915
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,580
"Nonetheless,"

916
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:35,249
"since the passion to experience ourselves..."

917
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:38,249
"and deliver to the viewers through this show..."

918
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:41,160
"about Mexico’s traditions and culture was greatly aspired,"

919
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,759
"due to trying different foods,"

920
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,230
"exploring cultural sites,"

921
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:46,429
"and travel costs to Cancun,"

922
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:48,000
"the funds eventually ran out."

923
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:49,330
- That's perfect.
- Not bad.

924
00:36:49,331 --> 00:36:50,369
- Right?
- Very neat.

925
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:52,369
I think that will be it for the second part.

926
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:55,470
(He finally showed a CEO-like side again.)

927
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,309
"Third, KKPP Foods' development plans..."

928
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:00,780
"after successfully completing the cultural expedition."

929
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:04,249
"First, through various food experiences,"

930
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:06,680
"Director Doh Kyung Soo can improve his cooking skills..."

931
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:09,619
"and ideas, allowing him to present higher-quality..."

932
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,449
"and more diverse new menus in the next season."

933
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:13,020
- That's good.
- That's perfect.

934
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,489
- That's good.
- That's why...

935
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:16,460
we need to make use of "can."

936
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,730
Suddenly in casual speech?

937
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:21,199
No, to make it...

938
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,530
- Official?
- Yes.

939
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,170
Should I make the top part like that as well?

940
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,939
"Funds running out..."

941
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,370
"due to transportation costs."

942
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,569
No, don't do that.

943
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:31,139
If I write it like that,

944
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,570
- it's too cocky, right?
- Yes.

945
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,579
We're the ones asking for money.

946
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:38,210
(We're the ones asking for money.)

947
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:41,550
"Second, the leisure activities we experienced in Mexico..."

948
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,119
"can be incorporated into the next season’s program..."

949
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,689
"to bring joy to the guests who visit."

950
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:47,860
- I think that's good.
- That's good.

951
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:50,360
I love the expression "incorporated."

952
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,900
You've got talent.

953
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,729
He's a CEO, for sure.

954
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:58,229
- Yes, he's different.
- Yes.

955
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,430
Thank you, CEO Lee.

956
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,099
I still have a long way to go.

957
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,670
(I still have a long way to go.)

958
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:09,810
(CEO Lee, constantly evolving)

959
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,810
How does this sound?

960
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,590
"Through the diverse experiences, the team can relieve stress..."

961
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:19,289
"and expand their lifespan, allowing Joy Pops Laugh Pops..."

962
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:20,720
"to continue for several more seasons."

963
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,689
What is that about?

964
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:25,590
We can relieve our stress,

965
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:28,100
- live longer...
- Sure.

966
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:30,869
To be honest,

967
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:32,369
if we're gone from this world,

968
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:34,040
we can't be part of the show.

969
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,909
So if we want to stay healthy...

970
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:39,610
and shoot more episodes,

971
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,979
- we need to...
- Sure.

972
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,249
- stay healthy and live a long life.
- We need to focus on that.

973
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:44,409
We need to stay alive.

974
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:45,610
(We need to stay alive.)

975
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:51,250
(You seemed to struggle revising the expense report?)

976
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:53,589
When two businesses work together,

977
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:55,190
there can be some conflict.

978
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,090
It’s a kind of power struggle.

979
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:01,759
To be honest, I do respect...

980
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,470
and look up to CEO Ko,

981
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:07,240
so I did fall one step behind...

982
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:10,310
and match his requests...

983
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:13,080
to resend the report.

984
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:16,040
I’m absolutely sure...

985
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:20,080
that this email will not be rejected.

986
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,320
And, CEO Ko,

987
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,420
I really do think...

988
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,420
you are a good partner.

989
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:34,300
(He gives gratitude with clear intentions.)

990
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,669
(Expense Report, Rejected)

991
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:39,030
(GBRB: Joy Pops Laugh Pops)

992
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,940
- CEO Ko is...
- While we were talking,

993
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,469
- I think we arrived.
- Yes.

994
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:44,770
- Did we arrive?
- We're here.

995
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,170
I want to go fishing.

996
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:49,480
- This must be it.
- Yes.

997
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:52,509
- Good job, Woo Bin.
- Thank you.

998
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:53,919
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

999
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,219
Good job.

1000
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,380
(They arrived after a long drive of 3 hours.)

1001
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:59,220
- You can really smell the ocean.
- It smells salty.

1002
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:00,790
This is the smell of the ocean, for sure.

1003
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,259
It's not like a zoo.

1004
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:05,360
We're really going into the wild on a boat.

1005
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:06,599
(Excited)

1006
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,059
It's just a boat.

1007
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,600
This is just...

1008
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:11,600
nature.

1009
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:14,300
(The place that made nature-loving CEO Lee excited)

1010
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,000
It's an estuary.

1011
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,140
It's a river, but it connects to the ocean.

1012
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:23,180
(A place full of mangrove trees)

1013
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:25,880
That's a pelican. There must be pelicans here.

1014
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:27,579
And crocodiles. Here it is.

1015
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,750
The flamingos are in the water.

1016
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:36,060
(The protected natural reserve, Rio Lagartos)

1017
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:38,430
- Hello.
- Hello.

1018
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:40,459
Do you have a reservation with me?

1019
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:41,599
- Yes.
- Yes.

1020
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,369
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1021
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:45,869
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1022
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:47,499
My name is Jasael.

1023
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,740
- "Jasael?" - Yes.

1024
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,840
Follow me.

1025
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:51,010
Careful.

1026
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:53,840
(They go to take the boat.)

1027
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,179
You can imagine.

1028
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:59,749
To look at the crocodiles, flamingos, and other birds.

1029
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,520
- Excited.
- Excited?

1030
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,890
I love animals.

1031
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:05,720
I love animals.

1032
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:09,089
Animals. Birds and crocodiles.

1033
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:11,589
- Crocodiles and birds.
- Yes, I like them.

1034
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:13,400
Like flamingos.

1035
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:14,959
- Ready?
- Ready.

1036
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,299
- Ready.
- Ready.

1037
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,400
Let's go.

1038
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,470
It feels weird because it's real.

1039
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,809
- It's not a theme park.
- I mean,

1040
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:25,670
nothing else is like this, other than a zoo.

1041
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:29,339
(They are on a real boat in the real ocean.)

1042
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,149
This is just real.

1043
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:33,280
It's so weird to be this close to the water.

1044
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,050
Isn't it cold?

1045
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:37,050
Be careful. Crocodiles.

1046
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:39,420
- Really?
- He says there are crocodiles.

1047
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,260
Really?

1048
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,960
Not here. In the next place.

1049
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,089
Really?

1050
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:45,530
(Relief)

1051
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:46,729
But...

1052
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:49,199
- we don't get to ride these boats.
- Yes.

1053
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,970
- It feels so nice.
- The small fishing boat.

1054
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:53,870
- It feels so good.
- The river is...

1055
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:55,369
- just opening up.
- Yes.

1056
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:56,940
(Following the wide-open lagoon)

1057
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:59,409
It feels like we're sitting on the ocean.

1058
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:00,880
(Into the habitat of wild animals)

1059
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:04,749
- Look at the boats.
- Hello.

1060
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:06,150
Hello.

1061
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:09,890
(They greet the boat across the ocean.)

1062
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,589
Hello.

1063
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:12,820
(Hello!)

1064
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:16,990
(They are greeting every boat they see.)

1065
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:21,329
(The expedition team is so well-mannered.)

1066
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,799
(Screaming)

1067
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,900
(It suddenly feels like a boat ride attraction.)

1068
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:26,699
Don't do that.

1069
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:27,799
(Scared)

1070
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,339
(CEO Lee is a scaredy-cat.)

1071
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,540
(Gosh)

1072
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,979
- It feels so nice.
- What?

1073
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,210
- It feels so nice.
- Yes.

1074
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,380
(As they enjoy the boat ride...)

1075
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:44,690
Gosh, it's pretty.

1076
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:48,960
(They start to see the mangrove forest up ahead.)

1077
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:52,090
- That is a cormorant.
- What?

1078
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:54,029
- What is that?
- "Cormorant?"

1079
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,929
- These ones.
- Them?

1080
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:57,270
They are black.

1081
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,499
What are they?

1082
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,600
"Cormorant?"

1083
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:01,370
Duck.

1084
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,409
In Spanish, "pato."

1085
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:05,470
- "Pato?" - "Pato."

1086
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:07,480
Eagle.

1087
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:08,609
- Eagle?
- Eagle?

1088
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:10,210
- An eagle.
- It's an eagle?

1089
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,709
(This time, an eagle appears.)

1090
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:14,319
In Spanish, "aguila."

1091
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,579
- "Aguila." - "Aguila."

1092
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:16,650
"Aguila."

1093
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,390
Pelican.

1094
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:20,260
Pelican? It's a pelican.

1095
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:22,759
- Where?
- There it is.

1096
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,990
It's a pelican.

1097
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,200
(Surprised)

1098
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,999
It's the one we see on Pelicana Chicken.

1099
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,430
The one we only saw on the packaging.

1100
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:32,700
It's the actual pelican.

1101
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,840
It's an actual pelican in the wild.

1102
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:39,210
How do all these different species...

1103
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:43,010
live in one place without fighting?

1104
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:45,249
It's such a unique place.

1105
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:46,409
I know.

1106
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:47,550
My goodness.

1107
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:53,290
(They go deeper into the mangrove forest.)

1108
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:56,620
We're at a place where crocodiles seem to live.

1109
00:43:57,330 --> 00:44:02,300
(It feels like there will be crocodiles.)

1110
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,329
Crocodile.

1111
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:05,730
- Crocodile?
- Where?

1112
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:07,469
Where?

1113
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:09,239
(There's a crocodile somewhere around here?)

1114
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,269
Really?

1115
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:11,670
(There's a crocodile somewhere around here?)

1116
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:13,440
Where?

1117
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,740
(Tense)

1118
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,950
Here it is.

1119
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:19,710
Where?

1120
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:21,050
Where?

1121
00:44:21,051 --> 00:44:22,779
(There's a crocodile somewhere around here?)

1122
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:23,819
Really?

1123
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:25,150
(There's a crocodile somewhere around here?)

1124
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:27,120
Where?

1125
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,390
(Tense)

1126
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:31,490
Here it is.

1127
00:44:32,330 --> 00:44:33,330
Where?

1128
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,500
- There!
- There it is.

1129
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,930
Crocodile!

1130
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:38,600
There's a crocodile!

1131
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:40,340
- Gosh.
- It's an actual crocodile!

1132
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:43,469
- It's not fake, it's real!
- Gosh.

1133
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:44,870
- It's coming.
- It's coming!

1134
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:47,540
- Gosh!
- What?

1135
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:49,210
It's so big.

1136
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,150
(The crocodile is coming towards the expedition team.)

1137
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,180
Why is it coming here?

1138
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,890
(Scared)

1139
00:44:57,150 --> 00:44:58,450
What?

1140
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:02,220
(It comes swimming over, swaying its tail.)

1141
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:04,290
Don't do it.

1142
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:05,929
- It's so big.
- Gosh.

1143
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:07,230
It's so close.

1144
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:08,760
Unbelievable!

1145
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,399
It's so... Gosh!

1146
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,969
- It's so cool.
- What's happening?

1147
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:14,539
- It's so cool.
- Why is it...

1148
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:15,840
What's wrong with him?

1149
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:17,440
Why is it...

1150
00:45:17,770 --> 00:45:19,070
Why is it doing that?

1151
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:21,380
What if it...

1152
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:23,080
- Gosh.
- Seriously!

1153
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,710
- Gosh!
- Oh, no.

1154
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:28,179
- What is it...
- Look at this, this is real!

1155
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:29,420
It must think that we're going to give something.

1156
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:31,189
My goodness.

1157
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:32,689
(The crocodile is swimming right next to the boat.)

1158
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:34,359
It's much bigger than I thought.

1159
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,459
- Gosh.
- Look at the tail.

1160
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:37,490
(The crocodile is swimming right next to the boat.)

1161
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:41,930
- I didn't think it'd be like this.
- Right.

1162
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,030
How could they put a real one here?

1163
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:48,240
Unbelievable!

1164
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:51,069
- What?
- Hey.

1165
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:52,809
The teeth are like this!

1166
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:54,580
(Serious)

1167
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,540
It's cute.

1168
00:45:57,210 --> 00:45:58,210
It's cute?

1169
00:45:58,211 --> 00:45:59,609
(It's just cute in the director's eyes.)

1170
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:00,750
It really looks cute.

1171
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:05,550
(Selfie time with the crocodile)

1172
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:07,660
Crocodile!

1173
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,329
Gosh, look at the nose.

1174
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:11,330
(Eyes fixed, showing off their crocodile)

1175
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:13,160
My goodness.

1176
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,499
It's so cool...

1177
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:19,170
to see a wild crocodile.

1178
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,669
It's swaying its tail slowly, and it looks cool.

1179
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:24,509
- Yes, it's like a dragon.
- Yes.

1180
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:25,910
The strong ones...

1181
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:28,879
- are relaxed, for sure.
- Gosh.

1182
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,379
(The strong ones are relaxed, for sure.)

1183
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:32,150
- That's cool.
- How is this...

1184
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,220
Wash your hands.

1185
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,220
Hands? No.

1186
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:39,850
(He could have become a snack.)

1187
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:41,660
Why, that...

1188
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,260
How old are you?

1189
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,559
(How old are you?)

1190
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,230
(Laughing)

1191
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:48,999
That's so cool.

1192
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,270
(It is time to say goodbye to the crocodile.)

1193
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,899
(Thank you.)

1194
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:58,340
(They are respectful towards the crocodile, as well.)

1195
00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:01,479
- Gosh.
- That tree is cool.

1196
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:02,709
It's so big here.

1197
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:04,650
(They go past the mangrove forest where the crocodiles live,)

1198
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:09,950
(and the boat stops in the middle of the lagoon.)

1199
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:11,319
(Amazed)

1200
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,150
- What is it?
- Why? What is it?

1201
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:15,320
(Something is above the boat.)

1202
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:17,329
What? Is it a seagull?

1203
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:18,590
(The battleship on the sea, the frigatebird)

1204
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:20,199
- Look at me.
- Yes.

1205
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,230
Like this.

1206
00:47:22,030 --> 00:47:23,300
- Sit down.
- Yes.

1207
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:26,299
(Lure with the fish,)

1208
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:27,639
(and the frigatebirds will gather after seeing the fish.)

1209
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:28,969
They are scary.

1210
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:30,140
Are they seagulls?

1211
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:32,209
Like black seagulls...

1212
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:33,470
Gosh, it's so close.

1213
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,380
(They rush over at the news of fish.)

1214
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:39,550
(Passing the fish)

1215
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:41,349
Watch out.

1216
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:42,750
One moment.

1217
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:46,920
(The customers wait in line even before it opens.)

1218
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,060
Wait a second...

1219
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:52,690
It's so... Do I give it now?

1220
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,160
Wait a minute.

1221
00:47:54,161 --> 00:47:55,630
(As the wait time gets longer...)

1222
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,130
Give it now.

1223
00:47:57,230 --> 00:47:58,230
Now?

1224
00:47:58,300 --> 00:47:59,300
It's...

1225
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:00,500
Darn it.

1226
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:05,240
(Full of complaints, they force him to open the restaurant.)

1227
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:07,539
(Scared)

1228
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:08,580
Wait a minute...

1229
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:11,109
- Wait...
- They are so big.

1230
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:12,350
I can't do it!

1231
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:15,180
I give up!

1232
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:17,490
(He suddenly gives up,)

1233
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:21,220
(and they get outraged.)

1234
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,029
(Screaming)

1235
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:25,560
(Screaming)

1236
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:27,230
Like this. Just do this.

1237
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:29,300
(The brave younger member is just cheerful.)

1238
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:32,470
(Screaming)

1239
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:34,400
(Screaming)

1240
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,100
(Screaming)

1241
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:38,740
(Laughing)

1242
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:42,080
(A silent cry)

1243
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,310
- Did it bite you?
- They bite!

1244
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:46,380
(In tears)

1245
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:48,480
They bite!

1246
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:51,119
Kyung Soo should try.

1247
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:52,220
That's so funny.

1248
00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:54,920
- Did it bite you?
- It hurts!

1249
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:56,790
It hurts!

1250
00:48:57,730 --> 00:48:58,890
It bit me.

1251
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:00,630
Snap.

1252
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:02,229
Blood?

1253
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:03,500
It's bleeding.

1254
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:04,829
Really? Let me see.

1255
00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:05,899
Blood.

1256
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:07,340
(The finger is incredibly fine.)

1257
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:08,739
- Come on.
- Hold the very end.

1258
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:09,769
Look at this.

1259
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:10,840
(Trying to get sympathy with his fine finger)

1260
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:13,740
(Don't hold the fish like this.)

1261
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:15,579
- Here.
- Okay.

1262
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:16,639
No.

1263
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,610
(Wrong way to hold it: Wrapping the fish)

1264
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:19,680
You try it.

1265
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,120
I can't do it.

1266
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:23,280
- You should try, Woo Bin.
- I'm too scared.

1267
00:49:23,350 --> 00:49:24,989
Isn't that too much at the end?

1268
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:26,319
- You need to do that.
- I'm too scared.

1269
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:27,320
(Dangling)

1270
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,160
(With two hands tight)

1271
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:37,529
- I'm too scared.
- Hold the end.

1272
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:39,169
- Hold the end.
- Did you not try?

1273
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:40,229
(He reaches out, with a trembling heart.)

1274
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:41,400
(Screaming)

1275
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,109
Hey, we didn't give it yet!

1276
00:49:46,110 --> 00:49:47,940
(It took the fish as soon as he reached out.)

1277
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:49,740
He didn't even do the performance!

1278
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:52,780
I was so scared.

1279
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:56,620
Hold it with your mouth.

1280
00:49:57,990 --> 00:49:59,850
- Okay? Try it.
- No.

1281
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,019
Why would I do it with my mouth?

1282
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:02,720
- Or with your feet.
- Gosh, it's so big.

1283
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,030
My goodness.

1284
00:50:04,530 --> 00:50:06,130
Isn't this the tasty kind of fish?

1285
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:07,559
(To the director, everything looks sashimi-grade.)

1286
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:08,830
You’re unbelievable.

1287
00:50:09,730 --> 00:50:11,670
(Walking up)

1288
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,499
(He reaches out, without fear.)

1289
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:15,570
It missed the fish.

1290
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:16,800
(Amazed)

1291
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:19,369
- It really enjoys it.
- I know.

1292
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:20,409
- Did it take it?
- Yes.

1293
00:50:20,410 --> 00:50:21,440
That one took it.

1294
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:26,650
Let's go! Hey!

1295
00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:28,880
- Awesome.
- My goodness.

1296
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:30,849
They are fighting.

1297
00:50:30,850 --> 00:50:31,989
(The brave director gave the fish once more.)

1298
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:33,150
That's so cool.

1299
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,660
It's so big, but it still eats it.

1300
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:38,659
They have such small beaks.

1301
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:39,690
(A thrilling time with the frigatebirds)

1302
00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:42,200
How do you manage to make each session so different,

1303
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:43,799
like Baskin-Robbins?

1304
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,100
There are all sorts of things.

1305
00:50:45,970 --> 00:50:48,240
- Yes, and it's cheap, too.
- I know.

1306
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:49,939
Was it 25 dollars?

1307
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:51,009
- Gosh.
- Yes.

1308
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:52,740
- It's amazing.
- Yes.

1309
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:56,809
Kwang Soo, we should come up...

1310
00:50:56,810 --> 00:50:58,479
with something similar to this.

1311
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,650
- Right? It's so nice.
- Yes.

1312
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:03,120
We should make a raft.

1313
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:05,290
(The nice trip makes business inspiration overflow.)

1314
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,220
It's like "Our Blues."

1315
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:12,990
Yes.

1316
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:16,330
Hello.

1317
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:20,170
We must be going to a different spot.

1318
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:25,510
(They head to a shallower side of the lagoon.)

1319
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:30,549
- Hey!
- What is it?

1320
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:32,149
- Flamingos!
- Hey!

1321
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:33,310
- Flamingos!
- What?

1322
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,220
Gosh! They are walking!

1323
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,419
- There are so many.
- Is it that shallow here?

1324
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:39,650
It's dirt.

1325
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:41,790
Flamingos!

1326
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:44,830
(Over-excited to meet the flamingos)

1327
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,230
- Gosh, look over there.
- Where?

1328
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:48,060
- Amazing!
- Gosh!

1329
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:50,830
Gosh, there are so many.

1330
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:55,300
(On top of the blue lagoon...)

1331
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:57,939
Can we go right by them?

1332
00:51:57,940 --> 00:51:59,540
I know. Like this.

1333
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:01,239
They don't even run away.

1334
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:04,610
(They stop the boat and spend some time with the flamingos.)

1335
00:52:05,010 --> 00:52:06,810
Gosh, they are right in front of us.

1336
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:10,020
Right in front.

1337
00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:13,620
Give me the camera. You shouldn't be filming us.

1338
00:52:16,690 --> 00:52:18,230
This is unbelievable.

1339
00:52:19,830 --> 00:52:22,630
It's like watching through the TV screen right now.

1340
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:24,800
It's real, though.

1341
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:27,030
It's totally pink.

1342
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:29,200
"Totally pink?"

1343
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:32,840
How are they that color?

1344
00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:35,610
- Isn't it like AI?
- Yes.

1345
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:37,179
(The visuals are like AI.)

1346
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:40,180
- It's so unreal.
- Yes.

1347
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:44,849
It feels like aliens appeared...

1348
00:52:44,850 --> 00:52:46,120
- in front of us.
- Right.

1349
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:51,130
Flamingo babies are white.

1350
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:52,560
Right, they're white.

1351
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:56,659
They eat small shrimp and turn pink.

1352
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:58,899
- I see.
- Really?

1353
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:01,370
She says that flamingos are born white,

1354
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:04,069
but they turn pink because they eat shrimp and crustaceans.

1355
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:05,840
They gradually turn pink as they grow.

1356
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,809
(Eyes locked on the flamingos)

1357
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:09,909
Don't they look so weird?

1358
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:11,550
It's as if they're walking on treadmills.

1359
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:14,749
How are they walking on those legs?

1360
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:17,850
(The gymrat flamingo seems to be on a treadmill.)

1361
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:19,890
That one's really skinny.

1362
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:23,389
The one on the left looks like us yesterday.

1363
00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:25,790
And that skinny one on the right...

1364
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:27,800
symbolizes how we look like...

1365
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:30,569
nothing but skin and bones...

1366
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:32,300
after a bout of diarrhea.

1367
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,170
This is real.

1368
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:36,069
This is nature.

1369
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:37,270
They live here in the wild.

1370
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:39,310
I think we can get off the boat.

1371
00:53:39,410 --> 00:53:40,839
- No.
- No.

1372
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,009
Captain, can you...

1373
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:43,579
He's getting out.

1374
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:44,709
(We filmed under the safety supervision of a local guide.)

1375
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:45,880
Okay, he says it's fine.

1376
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:47,149
Watch out for crocodiles.

1377
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:49,249
Hey, flamingos.

1378
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:50,449
Is that okay?

1379
00:53:50,450 --> 00:53:51,490
(He goes straight into the water.)

1380
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:54,090
(It looks like he's performing the miracle of walking on water.)

1381
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:56,389
Is that okay?

1382
00:53:56,390 --> 00:53:57,490
Hey.

1383
00:53:57,630 --> 00:53:59,160
I feel great here.

1384
00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:00,929
It feels like I'm standing on water.

1385
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:02,100
(Eyes wide)

1386
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:04,269
- Are you okay?
- I can see them from here.

1387
00:54:04,270 --> 00:54:06,000
Watch out for crocodiles.

1388
00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:08,840
Crocodiles. Crocodiles!

1389
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:11,870
(Even the fearless director is scared of crocodiles.)

1390
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:15,940
Gosh, this is amazing.

1391
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:18,279
Okay, we can go.

1392
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:20,249
(Seeing Kyungsoo gave the two cowards courage.)

1393
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:21,480
(Amazed)

1394
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:22,880
What a beautiful sight.

1395
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,650
Kwang Soo!

1396
00:54:27,050 --> 00:54:28,559
Flamingo Kwang!

1397
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:29,589
(Flamingo Kwang has exquisitely long legs.)

1398
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:30,659
Look over here.

1399
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:32,330
Look over here, Flamingo Kwang!

1400
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,499
(Kwang Soo can't hear him.)

1401
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:35,899
Gosh, the flamingos!

1402
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:36,930
(Gosh, the flamingos!)

1403
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:39,599
You can leave!

1404
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,170
(You can leave!)

1405
00:54:42,770 --> 00:54:45,810
(Flamingo Kwang has decided to join the flamingos.)

1406
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:49,179
Can we...

1407
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:50,710
leave Kwang Soo behind?

1408
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,350
- Sounds good. Let's go.
- Let's go.

1409
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,489
So many fish!

1410
00:54:57,490 --> 00:54:58,850
Let's go.

1411
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:01,489
- Let's go.
- Sit here.

1412
00:55:01,490 --> 00:55:02,560
Captain!

1413
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:03,819
Let's go.

1414
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:05,130
Let's go without him.

1415
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:07,400
The water is so clear.

1416
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,330
Go. Please.

1417
00:55:10,830 --> 00:55:12,130
Please go.

1418
00:55:13,070 --> 00:55:16,640
(Standing alone)

1419
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:18,369
Wait.

1420
00:55:18,370 --> 00:55:20,010
(Bye)

1421
00:55:20,470 --> 00:55:22,640
- See you later.
- Bye.

1422
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:24,250
I feel great.

1423
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:25,909
(He hasn't figured it out yet.)

1424
00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:27,620
I can see all the fish.

1425
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:29,649
You feel great?

1426
00:55:29,650 --> 00:55:31,590
Stay there, then.

1427
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:34,590
If you feel that great, stay there!

1428
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:39,160
We're leaving.

1429
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:43,029
Hey, there's a gigantic fish here.

1430
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:44,970
(They leave Flamingo Kwang in the wild.)

1431
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:48,140
Kwang Soo.

1432
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:51,809
(What?)

1433
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:53,470
- Wait.
- See you later.

1434
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:55,379
(Bye)

1435
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:56,540
Darn it.

1436
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:59,379
(Kwang Soo realized what they were doing.)

1437
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:00,409
Wait.

1438
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:01,580
He was really startled.

1439
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:05,720
I'm weak because of the diarrhea.

1440
00:56:08,290 --> 00:56:09,889
Watch your step.

1441
00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:10,959
It's slippery.

1442
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,229
(They decided to go easy on him because of the diarrhea.)

1443
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:14,259
Okay.

1444
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:15,599
- I feel great.
- Right?

1445
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:16,830
- It's brightening our mood.
- Yes.

1446
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:20,169
This place is worth the three-hour trip.

1447
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:21,640
- It doesn't feel real.
- Right.

1448
00:56:23,070 --> 00:56:24,970
The flamingos are beautiful.

1449
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:29,180
(They fell in love with flamingos.)

1450
00:56:29,810 --> 00:56:31,909
This place is really worth visiting.

1451
00:56:31,910 --> 00:56:32,949
Coming here from Cancun.

1452
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:34,180
It's worth visiting at least once.

1453
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:36,449
I think I would come to Mexico...

1454
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:37,990
just for this if I had to.

1455
00:56:38,450 --> 00:56:39,720
Just for this experience.

1456
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:41,290
In our lives,

1457
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:43,460
I don't think I'll ever get another experience like this one.

1458
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:45,930
I'm totally satisfied with this.

1459
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:52,330
(They pass the mangrove forest where they met animal friends.)

1460
00:56:52,930 --> 00:56:57,100
(The KKPP races along the lagoon in the fresh air.)

1461
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,640
(Amazed)

1462
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:04,110
(The boat stops by a beach.)

1463
00:57:04,810 --> 00:57:06,510
(Surprised)

1464
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:08,050
- Are those ducks?
- So cute.

1465
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:14,319
(Seabirds waddle along the shore.)

1466
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:15,560
They're so cute.

1467
00:57:16,590 --> 00:57:20,960
(Las Coloradas)

1468
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:22,960
That bird is so cute.

1469
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:24,269
It is.

1470
00:57:24,270 --> 00:57:25,430
That's you, Kyung Soo.

1471
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,370
The sand is very fine.

1472
00:57:33,870 --> 00:57:35,880
He's calling us over.

1473
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:37,140
He is?

1474
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:40,919
(The captain is suddenly digging the ground.)

1475
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:42,520
Maybe it's only dry on the outside.

1476
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,190
Is there water below?

1477
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:45,889
There is water below.

1478
00:57:45,890 --> 00:57:47,350
(Surprised)

1479
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:50,760
- It's like clay.
- Right.

1480
00:57:51,630 --> 00:57:54,030
Deep inside, the color is different.

1481
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:57,160
Inside, it's white.

1482
00:57:58,170 --> 00:58:00,629
(As the captain digs deeper into the ground, he's able to...)

1483
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:02,139
(reach and pull out mud that looks like white clay.)

1484
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:03,439
- It's really like clay.
- Gosh.

1485
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:04,639
Spread it on your face.

1486
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:05,669
(Spread it on your face.)

1487
00:58:05,670 --> 00:58:07,039
- On our face?
- Normally,

1488
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,440
people spread it all over their bodies.

1489
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:11,010
You want to see the next one? Everything.

1490
00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:13,679
It reminds me of that.

1491
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,749
What is it called? Modeling clay?

1492
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:17,219
- What?
- Modeling clay.

1493
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:18,820
(The auditor has already begun his facial treatment.)

1494
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:21,159
It's hard to spread out.

1495
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:23,989
(After being in the sun in Cancun, their skin feels worn out.)

1496
00:58:23,990 --> 00:58:25,230
Should we help each other?

1497
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:27,290
This is so good.

1498
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:30,360
It's pelican poop.

1499
00:58:32,330 --> 00:58:33,470
Poop?

1500
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:34,900
Flamingo poop.

1501
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:39,270
(Kwang Soo can't help but do a smell check.)

1502
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:40,610
Hey, friend.

1503
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:43,209
(The smell of their animal friends)

1504
00:58:43,210 --> 00:58:45,010
This feels so good.

1505
00:58:45,410 --> 00:58:47,079
It probably works better than sun block.

1506
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:48,350
It feels clean.

1507
00:58:48,450 --> 00:58:50,020
And it's very smooth.

1508
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:55,790
(It's as if they've opened a facial studio.)

1509
00:58:57,190 --> 00:58:58,490
Should we help each other?

1510
00:59:00,590 --> 00:59:03,099
Can you flip the screen for me?

1511
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:04,130
(The director uses the camera as his mirror.)

1512
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:06,200
Mine is a bit dry.

1513
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,969
(He's in full-on skincare mode.)

1514
00:59:08,970 --> 00:59:10,239
- Here's some.
- Just do it.

1515
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:11,410
This one's soft.

1516
00:59:13,470 --> 00:59:14,910
This really...

1517
00:59:15,210 --> 00:59:17,109
has the exact same consistency and texture...

1518
00:59:17,110 --> 00:59:18,850
as face masks.

1519
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:20,980
This is so cool.

1520
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:24,050
(Woo Bin's facial studio is open for business.)

1521
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:27,449
(The customer is gracefully receiving treatment.)

1522
00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:30,220
(Director Doh joins in.)

1523
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:34,160
(Together, the two apply the mud thoroughly on Kwang Soo's face.)

1524
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:35,360
We did a good job.

1525
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,130
Gosh, it feels like a plaster mask.

1526
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:39,130
(The customer is satisfied.)

1527
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,070
- This dries down quickly.
- Yes.

1528
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:42,500
Is mine spread out thoroughly?

1529
00:59:42,501 --> 00:59:43,540
Yes, you're fully covered.

1530
00:59:47,610 --> 00:59:49,980
(Playing with the mud like dough)

1531
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:51,250
Should we spread this on our arms?

1532
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:53,610
Because he says it's poop, it strangely feels like poop.

1533
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:56,120
Kwang Soo, spread it on your arms.

1534
00:59:56,450 --> 00:59:57,650
It feels great.

1535
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:00,350
(Amazed)

1536
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:03,159
(Lost in the moment)

1537
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:04,360
Kwang Soo, spread it on your arms.

1538
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:07,760
(The Mayan-inspired natural spa...)

1539
01:00:08,830 --> 01:00:10,970
(concludes their skincare.)

1540
01:00:11,930 --> 01:00:14,939
(A satisfying after-photo)

1541
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:18,910
(Waiting for their skin to become firm and glowing)

1542
01:00:20,070 --> 01:00:23,839
The CEO led this tour.

1543
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:25,510
Tell us your thoughts.

1544
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:29,119
(The CEO led this tour?)

1545
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:31,250
Do you feel awkward talking with me here?

1546
01:00:32,290 --> 01:00:33,520
Go ahead.

1547
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:37,220
I'm not listening. Feel free to say whatever.

1548
01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:38,830
What?

1549
01:00:39,290 --> 01:00:40,660
Feel free to talk.

1550
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:43,499
I thought we all agreed to come here.

1551
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:45,400
But I suggested it.

1552
01:00:46,070 --> 01:00:48,799
All thanks to the CEO,

1553
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:51,410
we enjoyed ourselves.

1554
01:00:51,470 --> 01:00:52,969
- Actually...
- I can't really say no,

1555
01:00:52,970 --> 01:00:54,210
although it wasn't 100 percent like that.

1556
01:00:56,310 --> 01:00:57,710
I don't want to do the interview.

1557
01:00:58,050 --> 01:00:59,980
I thought I heard your question wrong too.

1558
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:03,080
- I'll ask a different question.
- Yes, please.

1559
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:06,089
The three of you decided together to come here.

1560
01:01:06,090 --> 01:01:07,519
It seems like you had fun.

1561
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,819
- I'm so happy.
- It was great.

1562
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:10,989
- It feels unreal.
- Right.

1563
01:01:10,990 --> 01:01:13,389
This is a rare experience.

1564
01:01:13,390 --> 01:01:14,659
A once-in-a-lifetime chance...

1565
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:16,699
- to do something like this.
- Right.

1566
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:18,670
- I feel like a different person.
- Right.

1567
01:01:18,930 --> 01:01:20,030
Seriously.

1568
01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:22,300
How do you feel about what they said?

1569
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:25,270
It's not like I was fishing for recognition.

1570
01:01:25,410 --> 01:01:27,039
If they had a good time,

1571
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:28,380
I'm happy with that.

1572
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:31,279
I'll keep on working hard...

1573
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:32,349
(Kwang Soo)

1574
01:01:32,350 --> 01:01:33,950
in the shadows...

1575
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:36,950
for employee welfare.

1576
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:38,950
Let not your right hand know...

1577
01:01:39,550 --> 01:01:40,950
what your left hand is doing.

1578
01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:44,430
(The CEO seems to be full of himself.)

1579
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:46,089
(It's time to head back.)

1580
01:01:46,090 --> 01:01:47,359
That's the same one.

1581
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:48,800
(It's time to head back.)

1582
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:53,000
(Even this beautiful facial treatment...)

1583
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,569
How is this possible?

1584
01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:55,699
This is amazing.

1585
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:58,410
(has a fatal flaw.)

1586
01:01:59,270 --> 01:02:00,840
My face feels tingly.

1587
01:02:02,210 --> 01:02:03,279
What?

1588
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:06,310
(The downside: The mud dries down quickly.)

1589
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,080
My face...

1590
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:10,420
feels too stiff to make facial expressions.

1591
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:13,150
- It stings when I smile.
- You can't open your mouth.

1592
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:16,919
- I can't smile.
- What?

1593
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:18,059
I can't smile.

1594
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:19,360
You can't smile?

1595
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:23,559
(Their faces are frozen like this.)

1596
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:25,370
(They are having fun.)

1597
01:02:32,970 --> 01:02:36,110
(The pelican poop is drying down on their faces.)

1598
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:41,919
(Kyung Soo, not able to bear it any longer,)

1599
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,690
(begins peeling off the dried mud.)

1600
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:47,320
This is somehow satisfying.

1601
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:50,660
- Right?
- Yes.

1602
01:02:52,590 --> 01:02:55,800
(They all start peeling the mud for satisfaction.)

1603
01:03:00,170 --> 01:03:03,800
(They're all totally focused on peeling off dry skin.)

1604
01:03:05,810 --> 01:03:06,840
I'll do it for you.

1605
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:08,480
Let me do it for you.

1606
01:03:10,610 --> 01:03:11,750
(Request denied)

1607
01:03:12,850 --> 01:03:15,980
(The boat sped across the water as they peeled off dried skin.)

1608
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:20,550
(They finally arrived at the dock.)

1609
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:26,789
(Thank you.)

1610
01:03:26,790 --> 01:03:28,060
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1611
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:30,829
- Jacket.
- Leave your jackets.

1612
01:03:30,830 --> 01:03:31,929
Right, the jacket.

1613
01:03:31,930 --> 01:03:33,730
(Tipping the captain)

1614
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:35,039
Jacket. Thank you.

1615
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:36,670
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1616
01:03:37,170 --> 01:03:38,569
Jackets.

1617
01:03:38,570 --> 01:03:39,770
They're not souvenirs.

1618
01:03:40,310 --> 01:03:42,080
That's for the jacket.

1619
01:03:42,210 --> 01:03:43,309
That's for the jacket.

1620
01:03:43,310 --> 01:03:44,780
It's for the tour.

1621
01:03:45,850 --> 01:03:47,180
Give him your jackets. Thank you.

1622
01:03:47,350 --> 01:03:50,350
(And with a tip for the captain, the tour came to an end.)

1623
01:03:52,790 --> 01:03:57,520
(GBRB: Joy Pops Laugh Pops)

1624
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:02,000
(Today's schedule: Cancun, Rio Lagartos, Playa del Carmen)

1625
01:04:02,260 --> 01:04:04,630
(Yawning)

1626
01:04:04,930 --> 01:04:06,769
(Current time: 9:20pm)

1627
01:04:06,770 --> 01:04:09,670
(The auditor keeps yawning from the long trip.)

1628
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:12,509
(Eyes glued to his phone)

1629
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:15,340
(Meanwhile, the director is looking at something.)

1630
01:04:15,710 --> 01:04:17,180
What do you want to do about dinner?

1631
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:19,410
I'll look up some options with you.

1632
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:22,220
(They decide to find restaurants near where they're staying.)

1633
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:26,690
There seems to be a lot of restaurants nearby.

1634
01:04:27,190 --> 01:04:29,460
There are many restaurants.

1635
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:32,530
This Italian restaurant is right next to our accommodation.

1636
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:35,030
It has 4.8 stars.

1637
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:36,830
Gosh, that's high.

1638
01:04:38,070 --> 01:04:39,770
Let's go to the Italian restaurant, then.

1639
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:41,439
Yes, let's do that.

1640
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:43,500
(They quickly decide to go to the Italian restaurant.)

1641
01:04:44,870 --> 01:04:46,640
We're almost there.

1642
01:04:46,910 --> 01:04:50,209
(They soon arrive near the restaurant.)

1643
01:04:50,210 --> 01:04:53,110
- Gosh, this neighborhood is...
- Right.

1644
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:54,280
The vibe abruptly...

1645
01:04:54,950 --> 01:04:56,379
Right, very abruptly.

1646
01:04:56,380 --> 01:04:57,820
It suddenly feels like we're in Playa del Carmen.

1647
01:04:58,350 --> 01:05:00,619
(A popular spot for backpackers and scuba divers)

1648
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:03,690
(The coastal town of Playa del Carmen)

1649
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:06,760
This city has the best vibes.

1650
01:05:07,690 --> 01:05:09,299
- I'm excited about the food.
- Me too.

1651
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:10,530
(They've arrived at the restaurant.)

1652
01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:11,999
There are so many patrons.

1653
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,600
- What?
- There are so many patrons.

1654
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:16,900
Let's order first.

1655
01:05:18,570 --> 01:05:19,670
All right.

1656
01:05:20,310 --> 01:05:23,840
Do you want clam chowder or plain seafood soup?

1657
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:26,749
It has shrimp, squid, octopus, crab,

1658
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:29,480
fish, lobster, and clams inside.

1659
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:30,950
And the clam chowder...

1660
01:05:31,690 --> 01:05:34,990
has white clams inside.

1661
01:05:35,990 --> 01:05:37,719
- The second one?
- I'm good either way.

1662
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:38,789
Let's do the second one.

1663
01:05:38,790 --> 01:05:39,990
- Clam chowder?
- Yes.

1664
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:42,830
Should we do arrabbiata pasta?

1665
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,030
Sounds good.

1666
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:46,799
Kwang Soo, do you like mushrooms on your pizza?

1667
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:48,070
Or...

1668
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:49,870
- Mushrooms sound good.
- Mushrooms?

1669
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:52,370
Should we have pizza funghi?

1670
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:53,440
The pizza funghi?

1671
01:05:53,441 --> 01:05:54,840
It sounds good.

1672
01:05:54,940 --> 01:05:56,380
Funghi? Punggi Korean ginseng?

1673
01:05:57,710 --> 01:05:59,109
- I think so.
- Sure.

1674
01:05:59,110 --> 01:06:00,310
(Kyung Soo has learned to let it go.)

1675
01:06:00,410 --> 01:06:02,220
We should also have the lava cake.

1676
01:06:02,450 --> 01:06:03,450
- This one, right?
- The lava cake.

1677
01:06:03,451 --> 01:06:05,019
- The hot chocolate volcano.
- Yes.

1678
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:06,819
Let's order this one.

1679
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:07,850
Okay.

1680
01:06:07,950 --> 01:06:09,589
- We'll have one clam chowder.
- One of those?

1681
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:10,960
- Yes.
- Okay.

1682
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:12,390
And...

1683
01:06:13,030 --> 01:06:14,899
we'll have one arrabbiata.

1684
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:16,560
- The arrabbiata.
- Is that right?

1685
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:18,269
The funghi!

1686
01:06:18,270 --> 01:06:19,669
- Pizza funghi?
- Yes.

1687
01:06:19,670 --> 01:06:20,930
- Pizza funghi.
- Okay.

1688
01:06:21,170 --> 01:06:25,040
And what is the hot chocolate volcano?

1689
01:06:25,170 --> 01:06:27,369
All right. That's a dessert.

1690
01:06:27,370 --> 01:06:29,009
- Yes, after the meal.
- After?

1691
01:06:29,010 --> 01:06:30,240
All right. I got you.

1692
01:06:30,380 --> 01:06:31,450
A Coke Zero Sugar.

1693
01:06:31,550 --> 01:06:32,709
Coke Zero Sugar.

1694
01:06:32,710 --> 01:06:34,580
- Coke Zero Sugar? Yes, sir.
- Yes.

1695
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:36,520
- And...
- For you, sir?

1696
01:06:37,050 --> 01:06:39,289
You want one glass of sauvignon blanc?

1697
01:06:39,290 --> 01:06:40,319
- Yes.
- Yes, sir.

1698
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:42,020
(They're done ordering.)

1699
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:43,989
The wine? For who?

1700
01:06:43,990 --> 01:06:45,660
For you? Right.

1701
01:06:47,390 --> 01:06:49,330
(Pouring a lot of wine)

1702
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:51,130
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

1703
01:06:51,670 --> 01:06:52,670
Awesome.

1704
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:53,700
(Wink)

1705
01:06:53,870 --> 01:06:56,370
(The generous amount of wine lifts his mood.)

1706
01:06:56,940 --> 01:07:00,540
This trip is really intense.

1707
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:04,180
We're on an expedition to explore a foreign culture,

1708
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:06,650
which means sleep is not our priority.

1709
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:11,489
We're working so hard on this expedition,

1710
01:07:11,490 --> 01:07:13,220
so I'm very upset...

1711
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:17,319
about the email CEO Ko sent.

1712
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:19,930
(He couldn't help but think of their rejected request form.)

1713
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:22,700
What I was most upset about was...

1714
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,699
how he said he didn't force us to stay at that accommodation.

1715
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:29,340
(I didn't force you to stay at that accommodation.)

1716
01:07:29,540 --> 01:07:31,240
He didn't have to be so formal.

1717
01:07:32,710 --> 01:07:34,210
We're closer than that,

1718
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:38,579
so I thought he'd respond warmly to our email.

1719
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:41,109
But he told us to resend the email following the six basic principles.

1720
01:07:41,110 --> 01:07:43,020
(The usually logical Director Doh is also disappointed.)

1721
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:45,249
He could have at least...

1722
01:07:45,250 --> 01:07:47,219
put a heart behind "Rejected."

1723
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:48,660
(Disappointed)

1724
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:50,790
Amazing.

1725
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:53,129
Great.

1726
01:07:53,130 --> 01:07:54,899
Your pizza. Here you go.

1727
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:57,430
(Some food to cheer them up)

1728
01:07:58,500 --> 01:07:59,500
This is insane.

1729
01:07:59,501 --> 01:08:00,530
(Pizza covered with cheese and mushrooms)

1730
01:08:00,630 --> 01:08:01,639
(Clam chowder with fresh clams)

1731
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:02,700
They're so big.

1732
01:08:02,970 --> 01:08:05,170
This is how they make clam chowder.

1733
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:10,410
Gosh, the arrabbiata.

1734
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:12,309
I want to eat rice with this.

1735
01:08:12,310 --> 01:08:13,480
(Tomato pasta with the spicy taste of pepperoncino)

1736
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:15,580
I'll put a slice of pizza on each plate.

1737
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:20,990
(The culinary director even takes care of serving the food.)

1738
01:08:22,390 --> 01:08:24,390
Begin eating on 1, 2, and 3.

1739
01:08:29,860 --> 01:08:33,000
(Savoring)

1740
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:39,110
(In awe)

1741
01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:42,339
It's so soft and warm.

1742
01:08:42,340 --> 01:08:43,380
Nice.

1743
01:08:51,350 --> 01:08:52,350
And warm.

1744
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:53,790
(He can't explain with words.)

1745
01:08:54,220 --> 01:08:55,660
I've never had pizza like this before.

1746
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:59,960
The cheese is practically liquid.

1747
01:09:01,390 --> 01:09:03,600
I'm not even exaggerating one bit.

1748
01:09:05,430 --> 01:09:07,870
- The dough is so good.
- Yes.

1749
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:11,070
The crust is really good.

1750
01:09:12,870 --> 01:09:15,280
You have to eat the pizza now.

1751
01:09:15,910 --> 01:09:17,640
Now's not the time to be filming.

1752
01:09:17,810 --> 01:09:19,509
Quit having nosebleeds and eat your food.

1753
01:09:19,510 --> 01:09:22,250
(He's saying kind words in a mean way.)

1754
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:24,620
Let's try the broth on three.

1755
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:28,760
I've never had clam chowder before.

1756
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:31,490
(They try the second dish together at the same time.)

1757
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:32,560
Cheers.

1758
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:37,830
(They taste the clam chowder.)

1759
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:39,530
This would be perfect with soju.

1760
01:09:40,970 --> 01:09:44,000
The seafood...

1761
01:09:44,870 --> 01:09:46,310
tastes great.

1762
01:09:46,370 --> 01:09:47,640
It's very fresh.

1763
01:09:48,210 --> 01:09:49,740
The aroma is amazing.

1764
01:09:50,980 --> 01:09:53,150
- The broth is a bit salty.
- It doesn't taste fishy at all.

1765
01:09:54,250 --> 01:09:55,520
Woo Bin, try the clams.

1766
01:09:59,290 --> 01:10:00,420
- Gosh.
- Nice.

1767
01:10:01,250 --> 01:10:03,160
- My goodness.
- It's so fresh.

1768
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:04,989
(It's time to try the arrabbiata pasta.)

1769
01:10:04,990 --> 01:10:06,390
Let's try this.

1770
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:10,100
Okay. In 1, 2, and 3.

1771
01:10:13,770 --> 01:10:14,870
Awesome.

1772
01:10:17,740 --> 01:10:20,340
It has a strong flavor. A strong tomato flavor.

1773
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:24,440
I'm glad we ordered these.

1774
01:10:24,610 --> 01:10:26,210
(They selected the perfect combination of dishes.)

1775
01:10:26,510 --> 01:10:28,880
They were all perfectly seasoned.

1776
01:10:30,050 --> 01:10:31,849
I'm being careful about what I say,

1777
01:10:31,850 --> 01:10:35,160
because I don't want to seem like I'm exaggerating.

1778
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:37,889
Excuse me.

1779
01:10:37,890 --> 01:10:39,290
One Coke Zero Sugar, please.

1780
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:42,630
Thank you.

1781
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:46,630
Since this is a tourist spot, everyone speaks English.

1782
01:10:47,370 --> 01:10:51,139
I gained confidence in my English just now.

1783
01:10:51,140 --> 01:10:53,140
(He's confident about his English after successfully ordering Coke.)

1784
01:10:53,740 --> 01:10:55,179
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

1785
01:10:55,180 --> 01:10:56,910
- Dessert, please.
- What?

1786
01:10:57,110 --> 01:10:59,280
- Dessert. The chocolate cake.
- Dessert?

1787
01:10:59,650 --> 01:11:01,410
- Dessert? Yes, sir.
- Yes.

1788
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:04,620
Isn't his attitude so good too?

1789
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:05,890
He's making me feel cheerful too.

1790
01:11:06,490 --> 01:11:09,220
I think they make a real effort to understand our English.

1791
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:13,190
You know how a lot of people work with joy like that.

1792
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:16,599
I wonder why I couldn't do that when I used to work part-time jobs?

1793
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:17,760
I get what you mean.

1794
01:11:18,370 --> 01:11:20,070
When you see people who work like that,

1795
01:11:20,530 --> 01:11:22,170
you can see it on their faces.

1796
01:11:22,340 --> 01:11:24,140
You're right.

1797
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:29,580
(Dessert is served right away.)

1798
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:31,079
(Volcan de Chocolate)

1799
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:32,679
(It's chocolate cake with a liquid chocolate core.)

1800
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:34,580
(It's usually paired with vanilla ice cream.)

1801
01:11:34,710 --> 01:11:35,979
Let's try this first.

1802
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:37,420
Are we supposed to eat these together?

1803
01:11:37,750 --> 01:11:38,990
Gosh.

1804
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:40,350
It's like a volcano.

1805
01:11:40,850 --> 01:11:42,419
(In awe)

1806
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:44,290
This looks very hot. Be careful.

1807
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:46,960
- What's this?
- Ice cream.

1808
01:11:48,290 --> 01:11:50,630
(Kwang Soo takes a bite right away.)

1809
01:11:50,830 --> 01:11:52,470
That just extended my life.

1810
01:11:52,530 --> 01:11:54,200
(It's the flavor that CEO Lee loves.)

1811
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:56,239
(Director Doh takes a bite too.)

1812
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:57,769
(Shaking)

1813
01:11:57,770 --> 01:11:59,040
It's incredibly sweet.

1814
01:11:59,910 --> 01:12:01,710
Really? It's not that sweet for me.

1815
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:02,940
It's not?

1816
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:04,640
Probably because it's very rich and thick.

1817
01:12:06,450 --> 01:12:07,509
(He sees something.)

1818
01:12:07,510 --> 01:12:10,650
Kwang Soo. Your T-shirt's neckline is really stretched.

1819
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:13,620
It's because of the mic. Is this really the only way?

1820
01:12:13,990 --> 01:12:16,159
The necklines of all my clothes...

1821
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:17,520
are stretched down to here.

1822
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:26,969
Please give us a separate check.

1823
01:12:26,970 --> 01:12:28,670
- Yes, don't worry.
- Okay.

1824
01:12:29,770 --> 01:12:32,670
(He checks the receipt.)

1825
01:12:32,740 --> 01:12:34,210
We had two Cokes.

1826
01:12:34,870 --> 01:12:37,540
We ordered two Cokes.

1827
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:39,050
Don't worry. One is on the house.

1828
01:12:39,510 --> 01:12:41,250
My goodness!

1829
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:44,979
So kind!

1830
01:12:44,980 --> 01:12:46,490
(So kind.)

1831
01:12:46,850 --> 01:12:48,149
- All right. Thank you.
- Thank you.

1832
01:12:48,150 --> 01:12:49,189
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1833
01:12:49,190 --> 01:12:50,290
Thank you.

1834
01:12:50,620 --> 01:12:52,159
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

1835
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:54,230
Thank you for the food. This place is really...

1836
01:12:54,890 --> 01:12:56,399
This place is unstoppable.

1837
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:58,260
(Moving to their new accommodation)

1838
01:12:59,130 --> 01:13:01,500
Kwang Soo, we're on a tight schedule again tomorrow.

1839
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:04,039
We can only sleep for 3 or 4 hours before we leave again.

1840
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:05,639
- Tomorrow is the climax.
- True.

1841
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:07,770
- In terms of a tight schedule.
- True.

1842
01:13:08,210 --> 01:13:09,480
Are we...

1843
01:13:09,810 --> 01:13:11,409
doing that at night?

1844
01:13:11,410 --> 01:13:12,550
Parasailing?

1845
01:13:13,650 --> 01:13:15,550
Tomorrow is our last chance.

1846
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:17,520
- That's true.
- Yes.

1847
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:19,319
After the whale shark tour,

1848
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:21,189
- we should parasail.
- Do it right after?

1849
01:13:21,190 --> 01:13:23,189
Then come back and get some rest.

1850
01:13:23,190 --> 01:13:24,719
- Should we come back early?
- Yes.

1851
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:27,159
Then we can have dinner.

1852
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:28,260
Let's do that.

1853
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:32,030
This place looks fun.

1854
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:33,230
(Gasping)

1855
01:13:33,870 --> 01:13:34,970
It's so...

1856
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:37,640
The music is that loud?

1857
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:40,040
How...

1858
01:13:40,510 --> 01:13:43,009
- The towns feel so different.
- That's what I mean.

1859
01:13:43,010 --> 01:13:44,640
This place is clearly a tourist spot.

1860
01:13:45,110 --> 01:13:48,010
(Passing noisy Playa del Carmen)

1861
01:13:48,310 --> 01:13:49,550
I wonder what the accommodation is like.

1862
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:52,850
(Suddenly getting curious about today's accommodation)

1863
01:13:53,420 --> 01:13:54,550
There it is.

1864
01:13:54,650 --> 01:13:55,719
- Where?
- In front.

1865
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:57,460
- Right.
- Yes. It's right here.

1866
01:13:58,090 --> 01:13:59,259
We're so lucky.

1867
01:13:59,260 --> 01:14:00,690
(The accommodation they just arrived...)

1868
01:14:01,430 --> 01:14:02,699
(Last night)

1869
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:03,999
Yes. So...

1870
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,329
I'm seriously traumatized...

1871
01:14:05,330 --> 01:14:06,630
- by this house.
- Right?

1872
01:14:06,930 --> 01:14:08,270
Check the bathroom first.

1873
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,370
Let's go to the one with a better bathroom.

1874
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,240
Let's go here, Kwang Soo.

1875
01:14:12,670 --> 01:14:13,839
Is it 497 dollars?

1876
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:15,380
- Is that 250 dollars per night?
- Yes.

1877
01:14:15,610 --> 01:14:17,309
Let's assume CEO Ko will...

1878
01:14:17,310 --> 01:14:19,210
- This place is over 300 dollars.
- send us the extra budget.

1879
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:22,879
(Before receiving the additional budget,)

1880
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:26,320
(they reserved a more expensive accommodation.)

1881
01:14:26,990 --> 01:14:28,250
Oh, this is...

1882
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:30,290
It's used as a decoration here.

1883
01:14:31,930 --> 01:14:33,790
But that was the restroom in the other place.

1884
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:37,830
(Suddenly reminded of the painful memory)

1885
01:14:38,430 --> 01:14:40,070
- Hello.
- Hello.

1886
01:14:40,170 --> 01:14:41,300
Hello.

1887
01:14:41,470 --> 01:14:43,540
We made a reservation.

1888
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:45,970
On Airbnb.

1889
01:14:46,670 --> 01:14:49,480
(While Woo Bin checks in,)

1890
01:14:51,110 --> 01:14:54,810
(the other two checks the accommodation.)

1891
01:14:55,050 --> 01:14:56,820
- This is really nice.
- It makes no sense.

1892
01:14:57,680 --> 01:14:58,920
Look at the gym.

1893
01:14:59,650 --> 01:15:01,989
(The common area is approved.)

1894
01:15:01,990 --> 01:15:03,160
Gosh.

1895
01:15:03,690 --> 01:15:05,060
Can we enter the room now?

1896
01:15:06,390 --> 01:15:09,260
(Getting more curious about the inside)

1897
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:11,799
This place...

1898
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:13,330
looks like a resort, Kwang Soo.

1899
01:15:13,930 --> 01:15:15,270
(Exclaiming)

1900
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:17,139
This is really nice.

1901
01:15:17,140 --> 01:15:18,200
(So far so good)

1902
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:19,809
What's the room number?

1903
01:15:19,810 --> 01:15:21,339
Room 436.

1904
01:15:21,340 --> 01:15:22,740
- Thirty?
- Yes.

1905
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:24,940
Here it is.

1906
01:15:25,010 --> 01:15:27,680
(Reaching the door half worried half excited)

1907
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:32,720
(Exclaiming)

1908
01:15:33,190 --> 01:15:34,349
I'm so excited.

1909
01:15:34,350 --> 01:15:35,390
And?

1910
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:39,860
(Will it wash away the painful memories of the past accommodation?)

1911
01:15:41,590 --> 01:15:45,160
(Exclaiming)

1912
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:46,829
I'm so excited.

1913
01:15:46,830 --> 01:15:47,930
And?

1914
01:15:48,970 --> 01:15:52,169
(Will it wash away the painful memories of the past accommodation?)

1915
01:15:52,170 --> 01:15:54,240
(Exclaiming)

1916
01:15:54,870 --> 01:15:56,510
This place is new.

1917
01:15:58,380 --> 01:15:59,979
Oh, it's nice.

1918
01:15:59,980 --> 01:16:02,050
(You can see that it's clean at a glance.)

1919
01:16:03,050 --> 01:16:04,380
This is really nice.

1920
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:06,489
(Exclaiming)

1921
01:16:06,490 --> 01:16:07,919
This is so nice.

1922
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:09,420
(It's worth investing.)

1923
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:10,859
- Compared...
- Compared to the nightmare.

1924
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:12,190
Compared to the previous place,

1925
01:16:12,260 --> 01:16:14,230
- this place is a palace.
- Yes.

1926
01:16:14,260 --> 01:16:17,000
(They start checking out the palace.)

1927
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:19,729
(Exclaiming)

1928
01:16:19,730 --> 01:16:21,830
Kwang Soo, even the beds are big.

1929
01:16:22,740 --> 01:16:24,099
(There are big enough beds.)

1930
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:25,240
This is very nice.

1931
01:16:25,710 --> 01:16:27,410
Kwang Soo, the water pressure is very high.

1932
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:30,040
You know we didn't get any water upstairs yesterday?

1933
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:32,980
We could barely flush the toilet.

1934
01:16:33,150 --> 01:16:35,180
(The clean washroom they wanted so badly)

1935
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:37,220
Look at the fridge.

1936
01:16:41,090 --> 01:16:42,460
The fridge is also clean.

1937
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:45,120
(Happy to see the empty fridge)

1938
01:16:45,430 --> 01:16:46,629
Is there...

1939
01:16:46,630 --> 01:16:48,090
a balcony?

1940
01:16:49,530 --> 01:16:50,659
- Wait, there is.
- There is.

1941
01:16:50,660 --> 01:16:52,230
- There's even a balcony.
- Gosh.

1942
01:16:52,730 --> 01:16:55,740
How can there be such a big difference?

1943
01:16:58,270 --> 01:17:02,140
(Fresh)

1944
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:06,279
- This is nice.
- Yes, this is really nice.

1945
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:08,920
I wonder how it'll look in the morning.

1946
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:11,520
I'm so happy to spend two days here.

1947
01:17:11,580 --> 01:17:12,719
I'm so relieved.

1948
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:15,050
(The expedition team is finally relieved.)

1949
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:18,620
(The rest of the production crew arrived later.)

1950
01:17:22,260 --> 01:17:23,360
I can't wait.

1951
01:17:24,060 --> 01:17:25,529
Check it out.

1952
01:17:25,530 --> 01:17:27,229
(Looking excited)

1953
01:17:27,230 --> 01:17:28,270
Hey.

1954
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:31,470
- They already look relieved.
- Finally out of the nightmare...

1955
01:17:31,740 --> 01:17:33,209
(Laughing)

1956
01:17:33,210 --> 01:17:34,210
- This is nice.
- It finally feels like...

1957
01:17:34,211 --> 01:17:36,309
I'm up from the dream.

1958
01:17:36,310 --> 01:17:38,439
Yes, this is traveling.

1959
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:39,880
(This is traveling!)

1960
01:17:40,250 --> 01:17:41,410
This way.

1961
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:43,519
- Gentlemen, this way.
- Can we...

1962
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:44,950
Film here.

1963
01:17:45,220 --> 01:17:46,620
Oh, my. This is so nice.

1964
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:49,020
This is a private room.

1965
01:17:49,390 --> 01:17:50,890
There's a TV and...

1966
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:53,430
The view in the morning is great.

1967
01:17:54,290 --> 01:17:55,899
There's also an AC.

1968
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:57,000
The restroom.

1969
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:58,260
The water runs well.

1970
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,069
(Splashing)

1971
01:18:01,070 --> 01:18:02,070
No rust?

1972
01:18:02,071 --> 01:18:03,470
No. The water runs well.

1973
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:07,240
The shower booth and the toilet are separate.

1974
01:18:07,370 --> 01:18:08,740
Follow me.

1975
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:10,640
This is the double room.

1976
01:18:10,641 --> 01:18:12,010
The restroom is the same.

1977
01:18:14,110 --> 01:18:15,450
This bed is big.

1978
01:18:16,450 --> 01:18:18,550
There are ACs installed in each room.

1979
01:18:20,390 --> 01:18:22,090
The safe and stuff.

1980
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:24,190
You can hang your clothes.

1981
01:18:24,790 --> 01:18:25,990
It's clearly different.

1982
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:28,230
The previous place had something like a military locker.

1983
01:18:28,630 --> 01:18:29,960
You get this here.

1984
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:34,100
(Today's accommodation is better in every way.)

1985
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,470
You get the ocean view?

1986
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:39,510
I can't wait to see the view in the morning.

1987
01:18:39,740 --> 01:18:41,240
- I guess so.
- It's the sea.

1988
01:18:41,710 --> 01:18:43,009
You can't see anything right now.

1989
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:44,510
When the sun's up tomorrow...

1990
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:45,849
When the sun's up...

1991
01:18:45,850 --> 01:18:47,350
Can I come see it tomorrow morning?

1992
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:49,120
Come in the morning.

1993
01:18:49,420 --> 01:18:51,519
We're off to see the whale shark.

1994
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:52,750
The place will be empty.

1995
01:18:53,050 --> 01:18:54,649
(The landlord is generous.)

1996
01:18:54,650 --> 01:18:56,320
You can see outside.

1997
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:57,960
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1998
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:00,590
(Lastly, the stopwatch to assign the rooms)

1999
01:19:01,830 --> 01:19:03,360
The one with the highest number gets to use the room alone.

2000
01:19:03,460 --> 01:19:04,760
The highest number gets the private room.

2001
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:06,170
One.

2002
01:19:06,770 --> 01:19:08,270
(Typical of the man with all thumbs)

2003
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:10,440
- Eight.
- Eight.

2004
01:19:11,370 --> 01:19:12,470
Next.

2005
01:19:13,010 --> 01:19:14,110
(Next)

2006
01:19:14,910 --> 01:19:16,509
(Next is Kwang Soo's turn.)

2007
01:19:16,510 --> 01:19:17,710
One and eight is...

2008
01:19:19,350 --> 01:19:20,549
(He was confident, but he also got 1.)

2009
01:19:20,550 --> 01:19:21,550
What is it?

2010
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:22,750
One.

2011
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:24,920
(Trying again carefully)

2012
01:19:25,650 --> 01:19:26,849
- Yes.
- Five.

2013
01:19:26,850 --> 01:19:28,089
(Kwang Soo got 5.)

2014
01:19:28,090 --> 01:19:29,260
I win.

2015
01:19:29,660 --> 01:19:30,860
- It's 8 and 5.
- Yes.

2016
01:19:31,460 --> 01:19:33,560
You get zero when you act arrogantly.

2017
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,100
Five.

2018
01:19:37,530 --> 01:19:38,730
Get at least two.

2019
01:19:39,870 --> 01:19:42,000
(It's an ultimate victory.)

2020
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:44,370
That young kid...

2021
01:19:45,270 --> 01:19:46,540
Twice in a row...

2022
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:49,010
He always gets the room alone in a nice place.

2023
01:19:50,910 --> 01:19:53,880
Honestly, you didn't want to use the room alone in the last place.

2024
01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:57,979
(Kyung Soo's amazing luck)

2025
01:19:57,980 --> 01:19:59,690
That's so funny.

2026
01:20:01,050 --> 01:20:02,520
I get to use the restroom alone...

2027
01:20:02,860 --> 01:20:05,490
and the king-sized bed alone.

2028
01:20:05,730 --> 01:20:06,930
This is paradise.

2029
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:10,000
- Goodnight.
- Night.

2030
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:11,729
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

2031
01:20:11,730 --> 01:20:12,829
Sleep tight.

2032
01:20:12,830 --> 01:20:14,970
(The production crew leaves.)

2033
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:18,669
(Busy getting ready for bed)

2034
01:20:18,670 --> 01:20:19,739
So nice.

2035
01:20:19,740 --> 01:20:20,910
(Busy getting ready for bed)

2036
01:20:21,270 --> 01:20:22,640
Are these pajama pants better?

2037
01:20:22,710 --> 01:20:23,810
Look.

2038
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:26,710
(Woo Bin has a question for Kyung Soo.)

2039
01:20:26,750 --> 01:20:28,750
I have these sweatpants.

2040
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:30,350
I was going to wear them.

2041
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:33,450
I wonder if the sleeveless is too much.

2042
01:20:34,250 --> 01:20:35,490
I also have a T-shirt.

2043
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:38,319
(Worried about what to wear for the whale shark tour)

2044
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:40,690
- Is this better?
- Yes.

2045
01:20:41,490 --> 01:20:42,600
That's good.

2046
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:44,200
Is this better?

2047
01:20:45,430 --> 01:20:46,700
- This or...
- Go with that.

2048
01:20:47,230 --> 01:20:49,040
- this.
- Put it on for me to see.

2049
01:20:50,870 --> 01:20:52,070
What's better between the two?

2050
01:20:52,570 --> 01:20:54,670
I think this is better.

2051
01:20:54,970 --> 01:20:55,979
This looks good on you.

2052
01:20:55,980 --> 01:20:57,440
(Kyung Soo chooses the sleeveless.)

2053
01:20:57,580 --> 01:20:59,010
It's not iffy.

2054
01:21:00,210 --> 01:21:02,850
(The younger one decides it sharply.)

2055
01:21:04,220 --> 01:21:07,520
(After helping Woo Bin with what to wear,)

2056
01:21:09,020 --> 01:21:14,490
(Kyung Soo wears the outfit for tomorrow to bed.)

2057
01:21:15,830 --> 01:21:20,470
(Kyung Soo's lifehack to save time on getting ready)

2058
01:21:21,170 --> 01:21:22,839
We weren't getting the AC just until now.

2059
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:24,799
- No. I was so scared.
- Me too.

2060
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:25,839
But now, we're getting...

2061
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:26,870
- the cool air.
- Yes.

2062
01:21:26,940 --> 01:21:28,239
- I'm so happy.
- I'm so happy.

2063
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:29,910
- It's double the happiness.
- I know.

2064
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:32,779
Did you throw it after entering?

2065
01:21:32,780 --> 01:21:33,980
(Exclaiming)

2066
01:21:34,780 --> 01:21:35,780
(Groaning)

2067
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:39,950
(Woo Bin soon became unfortunate.)

2068
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:43,890
(The younger one groans in silence.)

2069
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:49,660
(The older one finds it funny.)

2070
01:21:49,830 --> 01:21:51,730
Hey, how did the vibration reach all the way to me?

2071
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:53,870
I swear...

2072
01:21:54,130 --> 01:21:55,900
I felt the vibration.

2073
01:21:56,570 --> 01:21:58,470
Did it reach through here? How did that get here?

2074
01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:01,210
I scraped a bit.

2075
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:08,080
(Even though he's in pain, he gets ready for bed.)

2076
01:22:12,690 --> 01:22:14,550
- Goodnight.
- Night.

2077
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:24,230
(GBRB: Joy Pops Laugh Pops)

2078
01:22:28,170 --> 01:22:32,810
(Current time: 5:20am)

2079
01:22:35,110 --> 01:22:39,710
(Humming)

2080
01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:42,620
(Finally, it's the day of the whale shark tour.)

2081
01:22:42,950 --> 01:22:43,950
This is...

2082
01:22:43,951 --> 01:22:46,090
(Everyone is getting ready early in the morning.)

2083
01:22:46,290 --> 01:22:47,990
It's 24°C now.

2084
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:50,259
- Woo Bin.
- Yes?

2085
01:22:50,260 --> 01:22:51,320
After the shower,

2086
01:22:52,020 --> 01:22:54,090
don't forget to grab a change of clothes.

2087
01:22:54,390 --> 01:22:55,460
Okay.

2088
01:22:55,530 --> 01:22:57,660
- You have to grab that too.
- What?

2089
01:22:57,930 --> 01:22:59,630
The thing that I gave you to put your phone in.

2090
01:22:59,730 --> 01:23:00,770
So you can swim in the water.

2091
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:04,039
Kyung Soo, don't forget to take that.

2092
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:05,340
To put your phone in.

2093
01:23:05,710 --> 01:23:06,809
Okay.

2094
01:23:06,810 --> 01:23:08,840
(Packing thoroughly and making sure to take everything)

2095
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:13,880
(In the meantime, Woo Bin...)

2096
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:17,150
I'm grabbing the chicken juice.

2097
01:23:17,220 --> 01:23:18,279
I'd love that.

2098
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:23,090
(Taking a handful of protein)

2099
01:23:25,260 --> 01:23:27,960
(The bag became full.)

2100
01:23:28,290 --> 01:23:30,530
(After packing everything...)

2101
01:23:30,730 --> 01:23:32,730
What should I wear for glasses? Check it out.

2102
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:35,800
(Choosing sunglasses to see the whale shark)

2103
01:23:35,900 --> 01:23:36,940
Number one.

2104
01:23:41,070 --> 01:23:42,140
Number two.

2105
01:23:42,740 --> 01:23:44,109
(Go with them.)

2106
01:23:44,110 --> 01:23:45,309
I have one more pair.

2107
01:23:45,310 --> 01:23:47,250
(Asking Kwang Soo's opinion on the sunglasses)

2108
01:23:48,350 --> 01:23:52,080
(After getting ready, the expedition team leaves.)

2109
01:24:00,530 --> 01:24:04,399
(Current time: 5:50am)

2110
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:06,070
- You need to put on the mic.
- The mic.

2111
01:24:07,370 --> 01:24:09,570
- We're wearing matching shorts.
- What?

2112
01:24:09,870 --> 01:24:12,170
Oh, you read my mind.

2113
01:24:13,170 --> 01:24:15,510
I'm wearing shorts and what you guys bought me.

2114
01:24:15,710 --> 01:24:16,980
It's nice.

2115
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:18,810
- It looks good on you.
- I'm sorry, but it's not you guys.

2116
01:24:18,980 --> 01:24:21,679
- Make sure to say I got it for you.
- Sorry.

2117
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:23,050
- The one Woo Bin bought.
- The one you bought.

2118
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:25,180
It's the T-shirt Woo Bin bought for me.

2119
01:24:25,550 --> 01:24:27,620
(Humming)

2120
01:24:27,690 --> 01:24:31,160
(Let's set off for the whale shark tour on wings.)

2121
01:24:31,420 --> 01:24:33,030
You look good when you drive.

2122
01:24:33,730 --> 01:24:34,730
What makes you say that?

2123
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:37,499
- Because I'm handsome?
- I know what you mean.

2124
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:38,930
- Right?
- Why?

2125
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:41,570
You seem wild.

2126
01:24:42,870 --> 01:24:44,900
This matches you.

2127
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:47,310
But it doesn't match Doh Kyung Soo.

2128
01:24:48,210 --> 01:24:49,540
Driving doesn't match him.

2129
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:51,540
A bicycle is more suitable for you.

2130
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:52,780
- A bicycle?
- Yes.

2131
01:24:53,110 --> 01:24:54,310
A bicycle or a scooter.

2132
01:24:55,310 --> 01:24:56,379
A scooter?

2133
01:24:56,380 --> 01:24:58,049
(A quite small transportation)

2134
01:24:58,050 --> 01:24:59,750
I have that image, don't I?

2135
01:25:00,020 --> 01:25:01,320
A motorcycle for Kwang Soo.

2136
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:04,260
Driving doesn't really match me.

2137
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:07,160
(Glancing)

2138
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:08,160
(Smirking)

2139
01:25:08,161 --> 01:25:09,760
(Slapping)

2140
01:25:09,830 --> 01:25:12,730
(The heated seat is on again.)

2141
01:25:12,830 --> 01:25:14,269
If it's on,

2142
01:25:14,270 --> 01:25:15,599
I start sweating in a second.

2143
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:17,640
(Laughing)

2144
01:25:17,770 --> 01:25:20,540
I guess this wasn't used often.

2145
01:25:21,010 --> 01:25:22,210
It works really well.

2146
01:25:23,140 --> 01:25:24,210
As if it's brand new.

2147
01:25:25,310 --> 01:25:27,710
People wouldn't use it in this country.

2148
01:25:28,310 --> 01:25:30,120
- Oh, the sky looks beautiful.
- Right.

2149
01:25:31,020 --> 01:25:34,390
(The morning is slowly arriving.)

2150
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:36,660
According to our usual rhythm,

2151
01:25:37,090 --> 01:25:39,060
- it's something we wouldn't see.
- Right.

2152
01:25:39,990 --> 01:25:41,290
It's pink.

2153
01:25:42,190 --> 01:25:46,130
(They get to see the beautiful sky for moving at dawn.)

2154
01:25:46,830 --> 01:25:48,169
(Peeping)

2155
01:25:48,170 --> 01:25:49,270
The gas...

2156
01:25:50,470 --> 01:25:51,870
We're running low on gas.

2157
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:54,940
Is it enough to last for an hour?

2158
01:25:55,540 --> 01:25:58,440
Probably. We should be fine on the highway.

2159
01:25:59,350 --> 01:26:03,580
(Driving for a while with a relief)

2160
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:05,350
Oh, my gosh. The gas.

2161
01:26:05,950 --> 01:26:07,819
- Already?
- If there's a gas station...

2162
01:26:07,820 --> 01:26:09,390
- I...
- But there should be one.

2163
01:26:10,020 --> 01:26:11,190
There it is. Right there.

2164
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:15,590
This is such a relief.

2165
01:26:15,690 --> 01:26:17,960
Right. We're lucky.

2166
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:19,600
Is this LPG?

2167
01:26:19,770 --> 01:26:21,669
- Gasoline.
- Gasoline?

2168
01:26:21,670 --> 01:26:23,700
(Fortunately, the gas station was nearby.)

2169
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:25,140
Is it self-serve?

2170
01:26:25,570 --> 01:26:27,570
- It's self-serve.
- Normally...

2171
01:26:28,940 --> 01:26:32,410
(Getting off)

2172
01:26:32,580 --> 01:26:34,350
- Is it open?
- It's open.

2173
01:26:36,220 --> 01:26:38,420
- Is it gasoline?
- Yes.

2174
01:26:39,150 --> 01:26:41,149
- So how can I...
- Full.

2175
01:26:41,150 --> 01:26:43,060
Okay. You can only pay cash.

2176
01:26:43,460 --> 01:26:45,160
- Only cash? Okay.
- Cash.

2177
01:26:47,430 --> 01:26:51,230
(Opening the fuel cap)

2178
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:54,830
(Doing on his own)

2179
01:26:54,930 --> 01:26:55,939
It's a relief, Kwang Soo.

2180
01:26:55,940 --> 01:26:57,369
(Nodding)

2181
01:26:57,370 --> 01:27:00,710
(They almost stopped in the middle of the road.)

2182
01:27:00,910 --> 01:27:02,609
Kwang Soo, I left...

2183
01:27:02,610 --> 01:27:04,579
5,500 pesos to Jun Wi.

2184
01:27:04,580 --> 01:27:06,649
- So I only have 1,000 pesos.
- Oh, that's right.

2185
01:27:06,650 --> 01:27:08,779
- We asked him to hold it.
- So I'll stop before 1,000 pesos.

2186
01:27:08,780 --> 01:27:09,950
Okay.

2187
01:27:10,220 --> 01:27:11,850
Let's stop at 800 pesos.

2188
01:27:14,250 --> 01:27:16,020
I think it's almost full.

2189
01:27:17,690 --> 01:27:19,060
It's slowing down.

2190
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:20,759
- No, I'm slowing it down.
- Are you?

2191
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:21,830
I was surprised.

2192
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:23,629
Keep going?

2193
01:27:23,630 --> 01:27:24,699
(Controlling it manually to adjust the amount)

2194
01:27:24,700 --> 01:27:25,760
Fill up to 900?

2195
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:28,200
Let's stop at 900, Kwang Soo.

2196
01:27:28,670 --> 01:27:31,200
(Tapping)

2197
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:36,440
(Adjusting to 900 with CEO Lee's fueling skills)

2198
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:38,680
Press it one more time or give up here?

2199
01:27:39,850 --> 01:27:40,850
One more shot?

2200
01:27:40,850 --> 01:27:41,850
(Nodding)

2201
01:27:41,851 --> 01:27:43,150
(Tapping)

2202
01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:44,280
One more.

2203
01:27:45,220 --> 01:27:47,290
- Oh, I did it.
- Okay. That's good.

2204
01:27:47,790 --> 01:27:48,850
Perfect.

2205
01:27:49,620 --> 01:27:51,560
(Shaking)

2206
01:27:51,890 --> 01:27:53,229
(Joining)

2207
01:27:53,230 --> 01:27:55,690
(Taking every last drop of gas)

2208
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:57,500
- Good.
- Okay.

2209
01:27:57,501 --> 01:27:59,970
(Done fueling frugally)

2210
01:28:00,570 --> 01:28:03,770
(Returning to the car after completing the mission)

2211
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:06,869
(Setting off to the dock again)

2212
01:28:06,870 --> 01:28:09,980
(Carefully)

2213
01:28:10,140 --> 01:28:12,110
We'll get a ham and cheese sandwich and a drink.

2214
01:28:12,610 --> 01:28:13,879
- From there?
- Yes.

2215
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:15,050
And...

2216
01:28:15,750 --> 01:28:16,750
That sounds delicious.

2217
01:28:16,751 --> 01:28:19,080
(Smacking)

2218
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:20,819
And we move to Isla Mujeres.

2219
01:28:20,820 --> 01:28:22,420
(Isla Mujeres)

2220
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:23,520
- Isla Mujeres?
- Yes.

2221
01:28:23,521 --> 01:28:25,460
- Are we snorkeling there?
- Yes.

2222
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:27,090
On Isla Mujeres,

2223
01:28:28,030 --> 01:28:30,829
we'll get ceviche, nachos, and beers.

2224
01:28:30,830 --> 01:28:31,830
Nice.

2225
01:28:31,860 --> 01:28:33,199
(The whale shark tour schedule: Meeting at the dock,)

2226
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:34,729
(seeing whale sharks, food and swim on Isla Mujeres)

2227
01:28:34,730 --> 01:28:36,170
I wish I'd get guacamole.

2228
01:28:36,770 --> 01:28:39,300
The whale sharks are 5m long.

2229
01:28:39,710 --> 01:28:41,039
- Really?
- Yes.

2230
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:43,379
- What about whale sharks?
- They're 5m long.

2231
01:28:43,380 --> 01:28:44,509
(Gasping)

2232
01:28:44,510 --> 01:28:45,740
They're that big?

2233
01:28:46,050 --> 01:28:49,280
Simply, they're the biggest fish on Earth.

2234
01:28:52,220 --> 01:28:53,989
The max length is 20m.

2235
01:28:53,990 --> 01:28:55,190
- Really?
- Yes.

2236
01:28:56,020 --> 01:28:57,919
They're 34 tons.

2237
01:28:57,920 --> 01:28:59,529
(Shocked)

2238
01:28:59,530 --> 01:29:04,200
(The whale sharks are as long as 11 Kwang Soos.)

2239
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:06,070
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes?

2240
01:29:06,270 --> 01:29:07,830
Can you turn on the Bluetooth?

2241
01:29:07,870 --> 01:29:10,870
(Director Doh wants to listen to music again.)

2242
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:12,499
Play this.

2243
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:16,110
(Humming)

2244
01:29:16,180 --> 01:29:20,580
(Humming)

2245
01:29:21,810 --> 01:29:22,849
What's the title again?

2246
01:29:22,850 --> 01:29:23,980
(Endlessly repeating the Morse code-like lyrics)

2247
01:29:24,250 --> 01:29:25,480
I need just one lyric...

2248
01:29:25,580 --> 01:29:27,819
Darling

2249
01:29:27,820 --> 01:29:29,190
When the night

2250
01:29:29,660 --> 01:29:30,860
She's gone

2251
01:29:33,190 --> 01:29:37,430
(Trying to remember the title)

2252
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,930
- "Stand By Me." Stand by me - "Stand By Me."

2253
01:29:41,300 --> 01:29:43,870
(Refreshed)

2254
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:45,170
That's right.

2255
01:29:48,210 --> 01:29:49,339
(Getting ready for the finger snap)

2256
01:29:49,340 --> 01:29:52,110
(Putting on Kyung Soo's sunglasses)

2257
01:29:53,250 --> 01:29:56,120
(The auditor joins the performance.)

2258
01:29:56,220 --> 01:30:00,250
(The director also joins.)

2259
01:30:01,250 --> 01:30:05,190
(The perfect song for a drive)

2260
01:30:05,590 --> 01:30:06,890
Why am I so good at this?

2261
01:30:07,290 --> 01:30:09,129
- What?
- Why am I so good at this?

2262
01:30:09,130 --> 01:30:11,160
- I used to be bad at it.
- Really?

2263
01:30:12,230 --> 01:30:14,130
Kyung Soo, do you need this sound at your concert?

2264
01:30:15,970 --> 01:30:18,640
I'll put a chair on the side.

2265
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:21,670
Do that to the mic.

2266
01:30:22,540 --> 01:30:24,210
Okay. Then I'll do that.

2267
01:30:24,340 --> 01:30:26,449
- Chac-chac.
- Oh, that.

2268
01:30:26,450 --> 01:30:27,909
(Finger snap, vocals, maracas)

2269
01:30:27,910 --> 01:30:29,179
(GBRB Band is formed.)

2270
01:30:29,180 --> 01:30:31,019
Do you want to do it in the next concert, Kwang Soo?

2271
01:30:31,020 --> 01:30:32,479
- Sure.
- As special guests?

2272
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:33,990
But I can only do one song.

2273
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:35,890
- Why is that?
- I'm already drained.

2274
01:30:37,490 --> 01:30:39,930
Because I'm not trained enough, I couldn't complete one song.

2275
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:43,259
But if we sign the contract,

2276
01:30:43,260 --> 01:30:44,530
I'll train my fingers...

2277
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:46,930
and do it no matter what.

2278
01:30:47,070 --> 01:30:50,740
But I need to get paid more for the song with PENOMECO.

2279
01:30:50,870 --> 01:30:53,339
Because I need to snap my fingers a lot.

2280
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:54,770
(It's fast.)

2281
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:56,740
We won't be able to do more than two songs.

2282
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:01,150
(GBRB Band needs training.)

2283
01:31:01,410 --> 01:31:03,820
- Is it in Cancun?
- Isla Mujeres?

2284
01:31:05,850 --> 01:31:06,919
Is that him?

2285
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:08,550
(They arrived on time.)

2286
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:11,790
- Thank you for driving.
- Thank you.

2287
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:17,460
Check this out.

2288
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:21,270
It's kind of scary, Kwang Soo.

2289
01:31:21,870 --> 01:31:23,140
I guess it's really big.

2290
01:31:23,570 --> 01:31:24,769
It's a big mouth.

2291
01:31:24,770 --> 01:31:25,840
Fantastic.

2292
01:31:26,740 --> 01:31:30,410
(The picture of the whale shark raises their expectations.)

2293
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:33,780
Actually, rather than walking outside,

2294
01:31:34,150 --> 01:31:35,350
I prefer underwater.

2295
01:31:36,850 --> 01:31:37,949
I mean it.

2296
01:31:37,950 --> 01:31:40,420
(The aqua man is excited to enter the sea.)

2297
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:41,749
Oh, the smell of the sea.

2298
01:31:41,750 --> 01:31:44,319
(The expedition team is excited to set off.)

2299
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:45,620
Look over here.

2300
01:31:46,530 --> 01:31:49,290
(Smiling)

2301
01:31:49,460 --> 01:31:50,730
I'm excited.

2302
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:54,130
Do you think you'll see a whale shark?

2303
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:55,669
I think so.

2304
01:31:55,670 --> 01:31:56,970
I'm feeling lucky.

2305
01:31:58,070 --> 01:32:00,639
I'll only feel real if I see it with my own eyes.

2306
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:02,839
- I can't grasp...
- It doesn't feel real.

2307
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:04,539
- How many meters?
- how big it is yet.

2308
01:32:04,540 --> 01:32:06,679
- It's 5m to 20m.
- It can grow up to 20m.

2309
01:32:06,680 --> 01:32:09,480
(Feeling curious about the whale shark)

2310
01:32:10,020 --> 01:32:14,149
(How will the whale shark tour go?)

2311
01:32:14,150 --> 01:32:16,090
I feel like I've succeeded in life.

2312
01:32:19,020 --> 01:32:20,960
It's a Mexican beach we've imagined.

2313
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:24,629
(At the emerald-colored paradise on earth,)

2314
01:32:24,630 --> 01:32:27,530
(they explore Cancun, a vacation spot.)

2315
01:32:27,670 --> 01:32:29,530
It's a rainbow!

2316
01:32:29,940 --> 01:32:32,270
(With the energy of the rainbow, a symbol of good luck)

2317
01:32:32,370 --> 01:32:34,810
I feel like I'm on a search for a dragon.

2318
01:32:34,870 --> 01:32:36,380
It doesn't feel real.

2319
01:32:36,910 --> 01:32:41,480
(An exciting journey to meet a whale shark)

2320
01:32:42,350 --> 01:32:44,780
(But it's the beginning of a nigthmare.)

2321
01:32:45,250 --> 01:32:48,220
(The KKPP yacht becomes a mess.)

2322
01:32:48,490 --> 01:32:49,490
(His hat disappears.)

2323
01:32:49,491 --> 01:32:51,360
(The hat gets blown away in the wind.)

2324
01:32:52,490 --> 01:32:53,859
(Falling)

2325
01:32:53,860 --> 01:32:56,430
(The angry waves make them fall down.)

2326
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:58,430
We should've gotten a warning.

2327
01:32:58,760 --> 01:33:01,370
(They didn't know the reality of the whale shark tour.)

2328
01:33:01,470 --> 01:33:02,630
I'm getting seasick.

2329
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:04,370
(Groaning)

2330
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:06,000
Cindy, help me!

2331
01:33:06,410 --> 01:33:07,839
(A cry of despair echoes in the middle of the ocean)

2332

(Kwang Soo)

2333
01:33:09,070 --> 01:33:11,139
(To make matters worse)

2334
01:33:11,140 --> 01:33:12,240
What is it?

2335
01:33:12,310 --> 01:33:13,410
Aren't we going?

2336
01:33:14,050 --> 01:33:15,650
Why isn't there one?

2337
01:33:15,750 --> 01:33:18,049
If we don't see anything,

2338
01:33:18,050 --> 01:33:20,149
we'll go back after driving seawater.

2339
01:33:20,150 --> 01:33:21,990
(They face the danger of everything going to waste.)

2340
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:26,460
(They're determined to see a whale shark.)

2341
01:33:26,630 --> 01:33:28,130
It's free. Go.

2342
01:33:28,530 --> 01:33:31,530
(What will it be like at the end of the eventful whale shark tour?)

2343
