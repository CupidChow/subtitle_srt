- our own money.
- We should do that.

- Six. Thirty-six.
- Six.

82
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,620

to get another number.)

86

Thank you. Seriously, you're like...

87
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:09,500
- the giving tree.
- Hurry up and give it to me.

88
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:10,630
Thank you, Woo Bin.

89
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,939

How about you?

94
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,950
I was a prospect in
swimming when I was little.

95
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,420
I was like that...

96
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,189
in Gyeonggi Province.

97
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,219
That one is pretty too.

98
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,289

- Okay.

00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,289
- What?
- I think I gave it to you.

102
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,129
- Good morning. Coffee?
- Good morning.

103
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,629
(The expedition team wants
morning coffee before departure.)

104
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,600
Are the bananas free?

105
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:45,140
Yes. Bananas and bread.

106
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,000
They're complimentary.

107
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,609
- Are they complimentary?
- Yes.

108
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:50,110
- They're complimentary.
- Really?

109
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,740
- Fantastic.
- Shall we eat some bread then?

110
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,380
I like free items.

111
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,249
(The poor expedition team
can't miss this opportunity.)

112
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,220
It looks tasty.

113
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,620
I guess the bread is free too.

114
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,490
Yes.

115
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,489
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

116
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,160
(He also gets bread to be frugal.)

117
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:15,970
The coffee is tasty.

118
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,640
Hye Rin, drink some coffee. It's free.

119
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,069
Guys.

120
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,209
Do you want to rent the diving suits?

121
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:22,240
Yes.

122
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,769
- You can try this on.
- Okay.

123
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,179
You can try this on.

124
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,079
(They rent the diving suits.)

125
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,210
To be honest,

126
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,210
I'm more comfortable being in the water...

127
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,480
than walking outside.

128
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,019
(The confidence of a man who
was a prospect in swimming)

129
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,180
I'm serious.

130
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,049
I'll take a picture of you guys together.

131
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,450
- Okay.
- Please.

132
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,759
(A picture before departure)

133
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,819
Okay. Please...

134
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,389
put your hand over your head...

135
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,070
because you're going to see a whale shark.

136
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,289
Okay.

137
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,059
It's the fin of the whale shark.

138
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,060
(The fin)

139
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,830
Thank you, guys. Okay.

140
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,630
- Go on in.
- Okay.

141
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,540
(They move to the wharf.)

142
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,670
I can smell the sea.

143
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,380
The two of you, look over here.

144
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,550
(Auditor wants to remember this moment.)

145
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,860
It really is a beach in a foreign country.

146
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,119
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

147
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,089
- Welcome aboard.
- Yes.

148
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:12,560
One by one, please.

149
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,390
I'm excited.

150
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,290
My heart is fluttering.

151
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,759
- I was very tired.
- Yes.

152
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,120
- But now that I'm here...
- I'm getting a surge of energy.

153
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,399
(Do you think you'll see
a whale shark today?)

154
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,916
Do you think you'll see a whale shark?

155
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,310
I think so.

156
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,510
I have a good feeling.

157
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,979
It'll feel real once I
see it with my own eyes.

158
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,149
- So far, I can't get a sense...
- It doesn't feel real.

159
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,849
- How many meters?
- of how big it is.

160
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,880
- It's 5m to 20m.
- It can grow up to 20m.

161
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,050
My goodness.

162
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,150
That means it's as big as a building.

163
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,659
- It's bigger than that building.
- It's bigger than that building.

164
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,290
- About four stories.
- Really?

165
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,259
Maybe Kwang Soo will get sucked in...

166
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,430
while it's inhaling plankton.

167
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,729
If I get sucked in, make
sure to air that part.

168
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,969
(Professional)

169
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,499
- I won't be able to talk, - Kwang Soo.

170
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,200
So I'll do this as I get sucked in.

171
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,040
- Your last moment.
- I'll do this.

172
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,539
(Insanely professional)

173
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,780
A big plankton.

174
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,849
Three of you, come on in.

175
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,810
One, two, three.

176
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,080
One, two, three.

177
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,090
- It's ours.
- Yes.

178
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,019
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

179
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,389
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

180
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:21,990
(They depart.)

181
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,330
Have a good time.

(They head out to the sea
in search of a whale shark!)

183
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,250
You brought all sorts of things.

184
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,489
I have so much luggage.

185
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,520
My goodness.

186
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,390
There are towels and other items.

187
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,960
The most important item is here.

188
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,860
(Auditor always packs protein.)

189
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,259
Okay, guys. Good morning, everyone.

190
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,399
- Good morning.
- Welcome aboard.

191
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,870
Okay, guys. My name is Isaac,
and I'll be your captain today.

192
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,900
- Okay? Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

193
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,669
And she's Cindy. Cindy is your guide.

194
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,609
Cindy will go with you all the time.

195
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:11,739
- Okay?
- Okay.

196
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,480
We'll travel in that direction, okay?

197
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:17,580
We'll travel in the open ocean
for an hour or an hour and a half.

198
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:20,420
Then we'll look for it in
the water in the area, okay?

199
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,150
Every day is different.

200
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:25,219
Sometimes, we can see, on the surface, ten,

201
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,159
twenty, or thirty whale sharks.

202
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,330
Or just 5 or 1 or...

203
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,860
- Yes?
- Maybe...

204
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,430
Zero. Okay?

205
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,669
(You need some luck to see a whale shark.)

206
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,339
That's how it is, okay?

207
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,199
There are important rules.

208
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,609
The most important rule
in the whale shark tour is...

209
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,780
- don't touch the whale shark, okay?
- Okay.

210
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,939
They deal with us every day.

211
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,779
And whale sharks have
a natural skin protector.

212
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:52,350
And we have different
bacteria on our hands.

213
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,579
Secondly,

214
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,990
when you jump in the water
and see the whale shark's face,

215
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:58,960
Cindy will say this in the water.

216
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,620
"Turn around!"

217
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,830
That's the perfect moment to turn.

218
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,489
You'll go in the same direction...

219
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,729
- and keep swimming.
- Okay.

220
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:09,199
Okay? That's it. Is that all right?

221
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,270
Okay, guys.

222
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,139
- Are you ready?
- Ready!

223
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,199
Come on. Let's go.

224
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,540
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

225
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:18,039
(The boat sails out to the sea.)

226
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,509
(The camera and audio
are in poor condition...)

227
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,356
(due to the weather at sea.
(Please be understanding.)

228
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,280
I feel like I've succeeded in life.

229
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,080
(CEO Lee sees himself as
a successful entrepreneur.)

230
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,689
Since you're on the boat with that tooth,

231
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,619
- you look like a pirate.
- You look like the pirate king.

232
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,620
(Other people see CEO
Lee as the pirate king.)

233
00:08:31,621 --> 00:08:34,520
I keep forgetting about this.

234
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,930
Look at the color of the water.

235
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:40,329
(The emerald-colored sea)

236
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,629
How is it so different?

237
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,350
How is the color of the water so different?

238
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,839
Isn't it because of the color of the sand?

239
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,800
That might be the case. The sand is white.

240
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,970
(They sail as they enjoy the
unrealistic sight of the sea.)

241
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:55,009
I feel like we're traveling
in search of a dragon.

242
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,409
It doesn't feel real.

243
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,079
(The expedition team is traveling
in search of a whale shark, )

244
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,126
(an animal that feels like
a mythological creature.)

245
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,550
The color of the sea changed.

246
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,620
- You're right.
- The water must be deeper.

247
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:07,390
(They head out to the deeper sea.)

248
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,130
My goodness.

249
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,930
I think it'll be scary
to meet a whale shark.

250
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,900
Even if it's nice...

251
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,270
Nice people are scarier
when they get angry, right?

252
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,739
Even among nice people,

253
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,670
- there's always a bad one.
- That's right.

254
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,610
Some people are only
nice on the outside, so...

255
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,110
(Thud)

256
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,480
(Groaning)

257
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,760
(The boat is shaky.)

258
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,389
We'll have a choppy
day today. A choppy day.

259
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,630
If you get seasick, sit in the back, okay?

260
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:48,629
- What's this?
- The waves are a bit rough today,

261
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,129
so the boat can shake.

262
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,899
If you get seasick, sit in the back.

263
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,570
It's much better in the back.

264
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,040
(As soon as they finish talking, )

265
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:02,910
(the boat begins to shake again.)

266
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,550
(He gets splashed with water.)

267
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:07,819
Here comes a big one.

(Waves enter the boat.)

274
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,940
- Hold on. No!
- Check the cameras.

275
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,210
The cameras.

276
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,610
- What am I going to do?
- Did everything get wet?

277
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,840
Everything got wet.

278
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,579
(The bag that holds the
expedition team's belongings)

279
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,010
It's open, so...

280
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:38,979
We should've put them inside.

281
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,820
We wore those clothes on our way here.

282
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,449
- I didn't expect to get splashed.
- No.

283
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,120
They should've told us.

284
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,460
They should've told us
that we'd get splashed.

285
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,289
(The website said nothing
about braving the rough waves.)

286
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,030
We're getting a shower.

287
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,900

288
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,830
(They get wet for the 2nd time.)

289
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,740
It's like that when they lower the speed.

290
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,509
I think we should stop filming.

291
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,569
One more time.

292
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:06,310
(It's impossible to film.)

293
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,350
Are they with us?

294
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,670
- It's a mess over there as well.
- It's a mess.

295
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,180
No one is filming right now.

296
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,320
Why did we get in the boat?

297
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:21,460
On our way back,

298
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,960
we'll need to get strapped down.

299
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,529
My forearm muscles are wrecked.

300
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,830

grabbing and holding on.)

303
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,380
It was like falling from the second floor.

304
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,110
Okay. That one was the best.

305
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,219
(They thought the previous
wave was the best one.)

306
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,220
(Thud)

307
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,389

(Best of best)

309
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,359
I couldn't hold on with one hand.

310
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,529
Switch hands.

311
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:59,899
It was the shabbiest he
had looked in his entire life.

312
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,100
(Muscles are useless
against the force of the waves.)

313
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:08,770

whale shark is truly rough.)

going back like this?

00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:28,549
(The expedition team is
losing the willpower and hope.)

358
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:31,380
(Is it possible to not
see any whale sharks?)

359
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,980
Yes, that happens.

360
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:34,949
That happens at times.

361
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:37,150
(The captain says that
they might not see any.)

362
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,820
Well, maybe yes.

363
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:45,430
(Cindy still has hope.)

364
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,370
(1 hour and 30 minutes of
looking for the whale sharks)

365
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:53,400
(Everyone becomes
tired of the long voyage.)

366
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:58,210
(An employee from the
head office falls asleep.)

367
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,480
(Look.)

368
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,380
(Look.)

369
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,010
Is he sleeping?

370
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:07,879
I think he's sleeping.
I think he fell asleep.

371
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,950
Really?

372
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:12,089
(CEO Lee wants to pull a prank.)

373
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:13,790
(Exclaim on the count of three!)

374
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,020
(Okay?)

375
00:15:15,021 --> 00:15:16,860
(One, two, three!)

376
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:18,130
(Exclaiming)

377
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,630
(Startled)

378
00:15:19,631 --> 00:15:20,760
What is it?

379
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:22,730
You startled me.

380
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:25,540
Hey, you startled me.

381
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,169
- Can you see it?
- Where?

382
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,509
- Where?
- Where?

383
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,110
(Did a whale shark appear?)

384
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,309
It's over there.

385
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,940
- Where? What's over there?
- A turtle.

386
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,009
- Over there.
- It's over there.

387
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,709
It came out.

388
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,009
- Where?
- Over there.

389
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:40,249
- My goodness.
- It's so big.

390
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:43,050
(Here)

391
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,589
It's fascinating.

392
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:45,619
It's so cute.

393
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,420
- My goodness.
- Does it go around like that?

394
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,130
It's so big.

395
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,030
It's so big.

396
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,229
How fascinating.

397
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:57,299
(The turtle disappears quickly.)

398
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,570
Come back up.

399
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,040
It breathed and went back in.

400
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,140
It's so cute.

401
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,180
It must be 100 years old.

402
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,979
In the vast ocean,

403
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,279
- a turtle of that size is swimming.
- I know.

404
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,319
- It's strange.
- Alone too.

405
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,350
Yes.

406
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,860
(A feel-good encounter
with the turtle passes.)

407
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,159
Okay, guys.

408
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,030
Over there, do you see the boats?

409
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,630
- Over there, do you see the boats?
- Boats? Yes.

410
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,600
(The place where the
boats are gathering around)

411
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,000
We found one whale shark, okay?

412
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:37,269
Please take off the life
vest and put on your wetsuit.

413
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,369
- Okay?
- Is it the beginning?

414
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,640
- There we go.
- We're here.

415
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,339
That must be why the
boats are gathered around.

416
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,350
(They finally find a whale shark.)

417
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,179
They're going.

418
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,950
(They get ready to dive in.)

419
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,090
After a turtle suddenly appeared...

420
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,420
(A whale shark appeared as well.)

421
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,060
Will it be worth coming all the way here?

422
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:58,859
- I hope it will be.
- Thank you.

423
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,700
(They hope they'll see a whale shark.)

424
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,329
We'll go down.

425
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:05,570
(They put on the wetsuit
and wait for their turn.)

426
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:10,070
(The boat shakes.)

427
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,309
It might turn over.

428
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,810
I might get seasick here.

429
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,349
(Groaning)

430
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,710
I feel like I'm going to throw up.

431
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,659
Look behind you.

432
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,780
Don't look at the boats.
Don't look at what's nearby.

433
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,130
Look far ahead.

434
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,490
Look at the horizon.

435
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,870
I'm seasick.

436
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:39,470
(The shaking boat makes him seasick.)

437
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:42,369
When the whale shark
appears, do we go in...

438
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:44,270
and follow it by swimming?

439
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,310
We can't pass it, right?

440
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,510
I mean,

441
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,480
if I swim with all my might and pass it,

442
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,920
it might get offended.

443
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,920
(The spirit of the former
prospect in swimming)

444
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,489
They're going in.

445
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:02,629
- Guys.
- They're going in.

446
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,760
Guys, let me explain some things.

447
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:08,529
I want to try this. The
two of you will go together.

448
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:09,999
The three people will go together...

449
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,299
including Cindy.

450
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,100
And the remaining one...

451
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,639
will go with the guide on that boat, okay?

452
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,680
You can jump in together, okay?

453
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,309
You can go in together, okay?

454
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,749
That boat has a guide too.

455
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,156
(2 guides and 4 expedition team members)

456
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,320
First two, come and get ready here.

457
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:32,020
(CEO and Auditor go first.)

458
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,890
(They're ready to enter the water.)

459
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,529
Only one leg.

460
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:42,699
- Okay.
- All right.

461
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,500
The two of you will go in together, okay?

462
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,939
Stay close to Cindy.

463
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,569
Follow Cindy, okay?

464
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:49,909
Never wander alone.

465
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,809
Follow Cindy.

466
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:53,109
(Right before entering the rough sea)

467
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,079
Good luck. Enjoy the sight.

468
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,310
Okay. Here we go.

469
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,179
(It's a nerve-racking moment.)

470
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,679
Are you ready, guys?

471
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,420
- Yes.
- Put one leg over the boat.

472
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,849
Okay.

473
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:07,159
When I say, "1, 2, 3,"
you'll jump into the water.

474
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,559
- Good luck.
- Only when I say, "1, 2, 3."

475
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,560
Remember.

476
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,090
Here we go.

477
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,999
(They've struggled for 2 hours.)

478
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,530
(Will they get to see a whale shark?)

479
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,800
All right.

480
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:23,910
One,

481
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:25,810
two,

482
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,510
three. Go.

483
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,980
- Go.
- Go.

484
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,380
(CEO Lee Kwang Soo enters the water.)

485
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,720
(Auditor Kim Woo Bin enters the water.)

486
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:40,320
(The first team goes in.)

487
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,560
Come on. Let's get ready.

488
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,259
(Only the second team remains.)

489
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,260
Go.

490
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,860
One,

491
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:51,030
two,

492
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,740
and three. Go.

493
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,999
Go.

494
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,909
Come on, buddy. You got this.

495
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:59,310
(Director Doh Kyung Soo is
the last one to enter the water.)

496
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,880
(All expedition team
members are in the water.)

497
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:12,120
(Kyung Soo's camera)

498
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:23,300
(Woo Bin's camera)

(Kwang Soo's camera)

500
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:38,280
(To see the whale shark, )

501
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,850
(the expedition team swims diligently.)

502
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:48,390
(The whale shark must be here somewhere.)

503
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,429
(Kwang Soo's camera)

504
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,600
(Shouting)

505
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:56,969
(Did he spot the whale shark?)

506
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,530
(CEO Lee lets out a shout.)

507
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,069
(The whale shark appears.)

(Kyung Soo's camera)

509
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,579
(Director spots the whale shark as well.)

510

(Exclaiming)

511
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:13,049
(Woo Bin's camera)

512
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:14,220
(Oh, my)

513
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,350
(My goodness)

514
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:21,520
(As the whale shark approaches, )

515
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:26,800
(Auditor and Director step aside
and change direction as they learned.)

(Kwang Soo's camera)

517
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:34,470

underneath their feet.)

(Kwang Soo's camera)

519
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:40,770
(Feeling pressed, CEO
Lee quickly dives back in.)

520
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,060
Look down!

521
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:11,810
(Kwang Soo's camera)

522
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:39,239
We saw it.

523
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:44,210
(In the open sea of Cancun, )

524
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:49,350
(they encounter a big
and cute whale shark.)

525
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:51,649
(Whale shark is the
biggest fish on earth...)

526
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,919
(that can grow up to the length of 20m...)

527
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,050
(and the weight of 20t.)

528
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,059
(Although it's a shark, )

529
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,860
(it's a gentle giant
that feeds on plankton.)

530
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,699
(I must film this.)

531
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,799
(Kyung Soo's camera)

532

(He wants to capture the
experience of a lifetime.)

in Director's eyes as well.)

(Kwang Soo's camera)

538
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,490
(The short and intense
encounter comes to an end.)

539
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,800
All right. Did you see it?

540
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,000
We saw it.

541
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,439
(It was the best!)

542
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,640
We saw it.

543
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,870
How is it...

544
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:27,240
Gosh, how is it so big?

545
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,910
(My goodness)

546
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,879
- How was it? Did you see it?
- Did you see it?

547
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,420
It swam right underneath us...

548
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,380
like this.

549
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:39,189
(Director comes back to the boat.)

550
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:40,219
Did you see it?

551
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,459
It was huge.

552
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,030
It's almost scary because it's so huge.

553
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,390
How did it pass?

554
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,930
It's the scariest when
you see it face-to-face.

555
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,129
- Is it scary?
- So...

556
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:52,210
Was it scarier than the
crocodile you saw yesterday?

557
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:54,939
- It was scarier.
- Really?

558
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,369
When you go in,

559
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,069
you come face-to-face...

560
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,780
with the whale shark like this.

561
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,580
It's like, "I don't think this
is supposed to happen."

562
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:05,650
"If it comes this way,
I'll go into its mouth."

563
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,120
There was that moment.

564
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:08,579
But Cindy pulled me aside.

565
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,590
(Director got the
experience of a plankton.)

566
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,790
Where's Kwang Soo?

567
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,920
He's over there.

568
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,790
(CEO is the last one
to return to the boat.)

569
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,860
Cindy, help me.

570
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,269
(The former swimming prospect,
CEO Lee is out of strength.)

571
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:25,200
He was a swimming prospect.

572
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,270
(My goodness)

573
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,510
(My goodness)

574
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:32,040
(CEO returns in an exhausted state.)

575
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,710
I almost followed it to the end.

576
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,310
I was in a trance.

577
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:40,520
It pulled me like a magnet.

578
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,420
I couldn't stop.

579
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:45,290
- Gosh, it's huge.
- It's huge, right?

580
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,390
It was doing this.

581
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,230
As it swam by.

582
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:54,000
(He met quite a mannered whale shark.)

583
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,970
The whale shark felt...

584
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:59,070
slightly smaller than the boat,

585
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,940
- but it felt as big as it.
- Twice as big.

586
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,140
(The whale shark felt as big as the boat.)

587
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,279
- It came out great.
- Did you take a photo?

588
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,280
Yes.

589
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:12,820
(Look at this.)

590
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:17,790
(The whale shark photo
taken by the director)

591
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:20,660
(Everyone is sharing their
whale shark experience.)

592
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,190
My stomach is...

593
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:26,360
(The auditor starts feeling seasick
as soon as he gets on the boat.)

594
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,300
Sir, do you want something
to drink? Do you want a Coke?

595
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:33,570
- Yes. Do you have any water?
- Water?

596
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:36,910
Oh, gosh.

597
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,140
I must look a mile away.

598
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:42,040
(His seasickness is quite bad.)

599
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,610
(Trying to appease his
stomach with some water)

600
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:47,620
Goodness.

601
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,089
Go sit in the back.

602
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:51,890
- The back is better.
- Is it?

603
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:54,590
- Do you not get seasick?
- I do.

604
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,130
- Are you okay?
- I'm not.

605
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,129
One bad move, and I might throw up.

606
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,490
- Same. I'm on the verge.
- Right?

607
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,170
- Would you like some water?
- Look up at the sky.

608
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:07,499
(Those who have
seasickness are at the back.)

609
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,569
- If we hurry up...
- Here we go.

610
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:10,939
- Okay.
- Stay at the back.

611
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,880
(Struggling)

612
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,740
I felt sick even in the water.

613
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,250
(Retching)

614
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:20,750
(The whale shark tour ends
with everyone feeling seasick.)

615
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:26,020
(GBRB: Joy Pops Laugh Pops)

616
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,290
It was really painful.

617
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:32,530
(They've reached the second
course of the whale shark tour.)

618
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,659
(With an emerald-colored
sea and a golden beach)

619
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:39,900
(Mexico's paradise)

620
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:43,439
(Blessed with nature, )

621
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,879
(you can meet various marine friends.)

622
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,040
(Cancun's hidden, gem-like island)

623
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:57,750
(Arrived at Isla Mujeres)

624
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,260
I can still feel it in my stomach.

625
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,690
(The aftereffect of the
seasickness is still going strong.)

626
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:07,129
- You're amazing, Kyung Soo.
- You'll be fine once you get off.

627
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:08,260
Do you feel completely fine?

628
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,330
I felt kind of sick earlier.

629
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,739
(The director is fine even
after the 5-hour boat ride.)

630
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,800
It looks fun.

631
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:18,210
(He's in unbearable pain.)

632
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:19,710
I suddenly feel sick.

633
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:25,780
I think Rio Lagartos is better than here.

634
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,150
Right?

635
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:28,920
This place.

636
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,520
I don't think I'll ever come back here.

637
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:34,789
- Think about the money.
- Okay.

638
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:37,390
(The seasickness hit
the auditor really bad.)

639
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:41,060
(KKPP is getting ready to anchor.)

640
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,730
This must be our spot.

641
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:46,570
Okay, guys.

642
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,309
Guys, we'll be here maybe
40 to 45 minutes, more or less.

643
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,310
- Okay?
- Yes.

644
00:28:51,311 --> 00:28:53,409
If you want, you can jump
into the water, go ahead.

645
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:56,549
Stay there in the sun, and
you will feel much better.

646
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,380
Okay? If you want to.

647
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,440
- Thank you so much.
- Should I take photos?

648
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:02,020
No, I'll take them for you.

649
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,549
Is it okay? Can we go in right now?

650
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,620
Yes.

651
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:09,120
(CEO Lee wants to get off the
boat quickly due to seasickness.)

652
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:13,959
(Jumping into the water without hesitation)

653
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,600
(The director follows right after.)

654
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,130
Hurry up, Woo Bin!

655
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,870
(Even the auditor jumps into the water.)

656
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,570
Don't you feel much better?

657
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,516
But I still feel a bit sick.
Let's stay still for a while.

658
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:32,310
(The expedition team enjoys
the water in their own ways.)

659
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:36,650
(CEO Lee has become one with the ocean.)

660
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,890
(He feels much better
after dabbling in the water.)

661
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,730
It's the same in the water.

662
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,459
How pointless.

663
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,500
(But it doesn't work for everyone.)

664
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:54,670
(Splashing)

665
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,230
My feet can touch the ground.

666
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,880
Just standing here is
enough to make you happy.

667
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,180
It's so smooth inside the water.

668
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:16,529
(Trying a piggyback ride)

669
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:21,760
(CEO Lee swims as if he's used to it.)

670
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:28,100
(The two swim in the ocean like fish.)

671
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:34,280
(They're like a couple on vacation.)

672
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,650
Can't we swim to the beach?

673
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:39,050
Why not?

674
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,380
Let's do it.

675
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,319
Jump on my back as you did earlier.

676
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,890
(Piggyback ride)

677
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:50,630
(The CEO and the director
stick together while moving.)

678
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:55,400
(Working hard on their way)

679
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:00,940
(They swim and arrive at the beach.)

680
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,770
It's really that. That exact beach.

681
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,870
The Mexican beach we imagined.

682
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:10,450
I feel better the moment I get on land.

683
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,350
This place...

684
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:19,120
I can understand why this
place is called a vacation spot.

685
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,860
There are always photos
in magazines and such.

686
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:26,499
This feels surreal right now.

687
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,560
- Everyone is so relaxed.
- It's also the colors.

688
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:31,869
And the sky. It's just...

689
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:33,769
- The color of the ocean.
- Everything looks fake.

690
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:35,600
(Isla Mujeres's scenery is unreal.)

691
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,840
We're the only ones who came to work.

692
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:40,310
Out of everyone here.

693
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,649
How about we go for a dive?

694
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:45,850
(Nodding)

695
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,349
(They arrive at the diving spot...)

696
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:53,420
(that's giving off a
natural waterpark vibe.)

697
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,189
(Running over)

698
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:58,760
(And he slips right away.)

699
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,530
Where did you go? Why are you over there?

700
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,970
(Embarrassed)

701
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:09,870
(Today's waves seem quite strong.)

702
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,540
Help me!

703
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,340
(A kid asks for the
expedition team's help.)

704
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,609
(Slipping)

705
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:20,080
(Instead of helping, he slips in himself.)

706
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:22,480
I'll pull you up.

707
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:24,019
One, two, three.

708
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:27,390
(Lifting)

709
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:31,360
(CEO Lee is such a sweetie.)

710
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:33,530
(Move, Kwang Soo.)

711
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:40,669
(After checking that the kid is
okay, Kyung Soo dives right away.)

712
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:44,009
(Smiling like a dad)

713
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:48,380
(The director is enjoying the
vacation spot to the fullest.)

714
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:51,450
I totally get why
people call it a paradise.

715
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:53,750
Let's go.

716
00:32:53,751 --> 00:32:57,150
(The fun in the water ends here.)

717
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:03,990
(Feeling refreshed)

718
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:06,460
Before coming here, didn't
Kyung Soo clearly say...

719
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,529
he hated vacation spots?

720
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:09,970
But he's enjoying it the most.

721
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,569
He actually likes vacation spots.

722
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:12,669
(The director enjoyed it completely.)

723
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:14,300
I must like vacation spots.

724
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,320
- I had no idea.
- Did you find out today?

725
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:19,609
I only found out five minutes
ago that vacation spots are nice.

726
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:21,250
This trip is enlightening you many times.

727
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,250
Kyung Soo peed from happiness in the water.

728
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,720
Dogs do it when they're really happy.

729
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:29,350
He was just too happy...

730
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,990
and did it without realizing.

731
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:33,390
It's a secret, okay?

732
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:39,030
(A secret of everyone
and the expedition team)

733
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,259
- Okay, guys.
- They jump in without hesitation.

734
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,269
(The snack has arrived.)

735
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:45,070
Your ceviche is ready.

736
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,710
(Ceviche that's perfect after a swim)

737
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:53,280
- Thank you for the food. Enjoy.
- Enjoy.

738
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,779
(After making a ceviche canape, )

739
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,109
(CEO Lee hands one to the staff.)

740
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:01,120
- Open up.
- Me?

741
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:03,619
- Me?
- No, take an insert shot.

742
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,119
(Production crew)

743
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,490
- Seriously.
- You really know how to be mean.

744
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,490
Eat it.

745
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,590
Thank you.

746
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:18,900
(Making another ceviche canape)

747
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,240
(He gives it to the cameraman.)

748
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:25,970
It's so that you don't get a nosebleed.

749
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:33,520
(CEO Lee eats one after
sharing it with everyone.)

750
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:40,890
(The director, who swam
hard, also has a bite.)

751
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,720
Do you want some sandwich?

752
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:44,530
No, thank you.

753
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:48,330
(The auditor has no appetite
due to the seasickness.)

754
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:50,570
You need something to eat.

755
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:52,000
Really?

756
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:53,300
Do you want some crackers?

757
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:54,670
Yes, that'd be good.

758
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,070
Do I need to eat to feel better?

759
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:03,250
(The auditor has some snacks.)

760
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:04,710
This cracker is good.

761
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,749
(The cracker brought his appetite back.)

762
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:09,790
What's this?

763
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,920
(Putting some ceviche on the cracker)

764
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,219
Is it broken?

765
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:18,730
(Devouring it)

766
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:20,060
Shall we go?

767
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:21,600
Okay.

768
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:26,700
(It's time to go back to land.)

769
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,369
Thank you.

770
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:32,070
(The 6-hour big run of the
whale shark tour has ended.)

771
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:34,009
(Current time: 2:00pm)

772
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:35,410
I'll drive to that place.

773
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,619
(They must get to the
parasailing beach by 4pm, )

774
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,620
(which is a 2-hour drive.)

775
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:47,920
(Waiting for the auditor to come)

776
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,429
We'll barely make it
even if we leave right now.

777
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:53,430
(We'll barely make it
even if we leave right now.)

778
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:58,430
(CEO Lee is anxious they
might miss parasailing.)

779
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:05,040
(The auditor is back.)

780
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:08,580
(They're off to parasail.)

781
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,410
The exit...

782
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:15,119
(The door isn't opening.)

783
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,220
What's going on?

784
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,689
Excuse me.

785
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:21,959
(Excuse me.)

786
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,359
Where do we go out?

787
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,190
(Where do we go out?)

788
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:28,130
- Ticket?
- Our ticket.

789
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,370
We need to use the machine.

790
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:32,530
Wait here for a bit.

791
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:37,410
(The auditor leaves
to pay the parking fee.)

792
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:41,540
(Pressed for time, the
CEO's eyes keep wandering.)

793
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:47,280
(With the auditor back, they're
now really off for parasailing.)

794
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:53,420
(To make it on time, CEO
Lee focuses on driving.)

795
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:59,230
(After 2 hours of driving)

796
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,160
- Right now...
- It's scorching hot.

797
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:04,669
They're on time.

798
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:06,769
(Fortunately, the expedition
team arrived on time.)

799
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:08,700
- Earlier...
- Do we have to go this far?

800
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,340
- It's today or nothing.
- Today is our only day.

801
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:13,610
If you want to lie down,
do it when you're dead.

802
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:18,249
But we haven't had a
single proper meal today.

803
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:19,509
We had ceviche earlier.

804
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,920
- Ceviche?
- And...

805
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,990
- if we eat when we are...
- Yes?

806
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:25,450
Slightly hungrier...

807
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:27,359
After parasailing,

808
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,460
we're going to a delicious pozole place.

809
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:35,059
(What?)

810
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,060
It's just that...

811
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,269
Remember how the waves were strong earlier?

812
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:41,540
They just put the ban in place.

813
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,470
The boats.

814
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,670
Don't ride one?

815
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:47,980
(The expedition team is left speechless.)

816
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:50,180
It's a no without exception, right?

817
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,779
We're banned from getting on boats?

818
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,149
Yes, boats can't sail out.

819
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,549
Is it going to rain?

820
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:57,189
- It's due to the strong waves.
- Today?

821
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,719
The waves are strong today.

822
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,036
(The expedition team can't
parasail due to the poor weather.)

823
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:03,159
(They walk toward the beach first.)

824
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,490
What do we...

825
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:06,260
What now?

826
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:09,559
(Feeling even more disappointed
as the beach comes into view)

827
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,030
Hello, how are you?

828
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,869
- How are you?
- Very good.

829
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:13,999
(No parasailing today?)

830
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,210
The parasailing activity has
been cancelled due to the wind.

831
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:20,540
It's a very windy day.

832
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,150
We drove for two hours.

833
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,609
(Disappointed, CEO Lee
complains to the staff.)

834
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:27,580
Yes, I know.

835
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,550
Is tomorrow's weather good?

836
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:34,060
Tomorrow is much better.

837
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:37,230
Tomorrow and the day after
will both have good weather.

838
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:39,529
Really?

839
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:40,730
(Nodding)

840
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,930
I'm here every day.

841
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:47,270
- Are banana boats also unavailable?
- What about those?

842
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:50,640
(All activities are impossible
due to the strong wind.)

843
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,680
- It's the wind.
- Anything that flies is a no.

844
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,510
Either way, nothing is possible today.

845
00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:00,020
And we're hungry now.

846
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,256
Let's get something to eat first...

847
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,680
- and then head to the hotel.
- We can ride the banana boat.

848
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:06,170
(The leisure mania leaves
even the taco mania speechless.)

849
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:11,660
(CEO Lee struggles to
walk away from the beach.)

850
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,730
Let's go.

851
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,000
Waiting here won't change anything.

852
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:19,570
This is beyond what I imagined.

853
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,939
There's nothing we can do, Kwang Soo.

854
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:24,040
Should we get a coconut for the ride?

855
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:26,740
Let's go get one.

856
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,450
(Bummed out, they go to buy coconut juice.)

857
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:33,079
All the shops seem closed, Kwang Soo.

858
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,220
I know, right?

859
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,749
You can get a massage here.

860
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,420
(Amazed)

861
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:42,589
- An outdoor massage place?
- That's unusual.

862
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:43,689
What a surprise.

863
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:44,930
It looks really nice.

864
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:48,900
(A pipe dream for the
penniless expedition team)

865
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,699
"Cold coconuts."

866
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,400
This is the coconut place.

867
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,840
Isn't that the owner? Excuse me.

868
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,539
- Hi.
- Coconut?

869
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,710
- Coconut.
- Coconut.

870
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,710
Before our request form...

871
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,940
gets approved by CEO Ko,

872
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:05,279
we should share one and split it.

873
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,480
Are you trying to save money?

874
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:09,320
It's a bit much to buy one each, right?

875
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:11,190
It might not be good.

876
00:40:11,191 --> 00:40:12,890
We drove here without even money for gas.

877
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,359
(Impressed)

878
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,829
The coconut is huge.

879
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:19,310
One looks like it's more than enough.

880
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:21,130
He must prepare it over there.

881
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,970
- That's...
- It's raw coconut.

882
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,770
With a knife right then and there?

883
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,069
- That's...
- He has a machete.

884
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:29,569
The juice is dripping out.

885
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:30,710
(It's done.)

886
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:34,140
(The staff walks away to get something.)

887
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,309
Just now,

888
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:38,279
- he said "palte." - What is that?

889
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,410
Straw.

890
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:41,120
- That's ridiculous.
- I'm serious.

891
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:45,350
- Palte?
- Is that palte?

892
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:47,319
This.

893
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,320
What?

894
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:50,430
Its name.

895
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:52,329
- Popote.
- Pote.

896
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:53,529
Popote.

897
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:55,059
- Popote.
- Popote.

898
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,460
It's "palte" in Korean.

899
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:58,199
- Po...
- Po...

900
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,429
- po...
- po...

901
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:00,439
- te.
- te.

902
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,570
It's "palte" in Korean.

903
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:03,070
Popote.

904
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:05,310
- Palte.
- No.

905
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:07,139
(A battle suddenly starts.)

906
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,910
Popote.

907
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:10,850
Palte.

908
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:12,650
In Korean.

909
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:15,580
Popote.

910
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,990
Palte.

911
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:21,760
- Palte.
- In your language?

912
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,120
- Yes.
- Yes.

913
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:25,359
Popote. Palte.

914
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,589
- Palte.
- Palte.

915
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:27,800
- Palte.
- Palte.

916
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,260
Palte.

917
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,369
(It was a nice battle, friend.)

918
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:32,430
No problem.

919
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:34,240
Let's go.

920
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:35,400
(Shocked)

921
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:37,540
It's literally coconut water.

922
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,979
- It's the real deal.
- Exactly.

923
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,910
So this is how real coconut tastes.

924
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:45,309
(Sipping)

925
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:46,720
Gosh, it's really...

926
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,289
- It quenches your thirst.
- Right?

927
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:51,790
It's sweet and good.

928
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,289
(The expedition team leaves...)

929
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:56,359
(after drinking the coconut.)

930
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,559
What a bummer.

931
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,629
The boats can't leave from Cancun.

932
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:00,000
We arrived just in time.

933
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:01,830
Exactly, we got here before 4pm.

934
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,499
Days like this happen.

935
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,130
Consider it a sign to rest today.

936
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:06,699
You've been busy since morning.

937
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,446
(The production crew tries to
cheer up the expedition team.)

938
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:10,140
Just about a week ago,

939
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,469
he went on about
manners toward the viewers.

940
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:15,340
You're right. He really did.

941
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:18,309
I've never met anyone so rude.

942
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:20,350
(I've never met anyone so rude.)

943
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,590
I'll drive, Kwang Soo.

944
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:28,950
It would've been perfect if we
could have gone parasailing today.

945
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:32,230
(Just as they're about to leave)

946
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:36,260
(The production crew at that time)

947
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,030
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

948
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:41,900
(After interviewing the
staff at the coconut shop)

949
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:45,910
(Just as they're about to
head to the next location)

950
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:51,109
(The staff runs toward
the expedition team?)

951
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:54,580
(After interviewing the
staff at the coconut shop)

952
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:58,490
(Just as they're about to
head to the next location)

953
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:02,989
(The staff runs toward
the expedition team?)

954
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:04,230
Is it available?

955
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:05,889
(It is?)

956
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:07,499
- Okay! Let's go!
- What?

957
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,729
- Can we parasail?
- Goodness.

958
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:10,230
(Excited)

959
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:12,170
- Thank you, brother.
- Thank you, brother.

960
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:14,770
- Is it okay?
- What is it?

961
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,009
- We can parasail.
- We can.

962
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:19,170
The date must've gotten
better. I mean, the weather.

963
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,910
The weather got better.

964
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:22,810
- Oh, my gosh.
- Goodness.

965
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:24,879
- Let's go!
- Amazing!

966
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,049
You're a lucky man.

967
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:27,319
(Lucky man)

968
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,420
- Gosh.
- Nice.

969
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:30,249
(Getting the cameras ready in a rush)

970
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:33,119
We would've just left if we
hadn't had the coconut, right?

971
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,960
- Had it not been for the porte.
- Yes.

972
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:36,419
- Everything was on our side.
- Porte.

973
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:37,560
- It's popote.
- For real.

974
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:39,860
(Thanking the porte)

975
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:41,330
Welcome again.

976
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,669
Thank you.

977
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:45,276
(They return to the
beach full of excitement.)

978
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:46,300
Hands up.

979
00:43:46,301 --> 00:43:49,300
(Putting on the life vest first)

980
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:52,910
I got emotional when the guy ran toward us.

981
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:54,940
I don't know why.

982
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,760
It felt like he was running in slow motion.

983
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:03,750
(The expedition team
waits until the boat is ready.)

984
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:05,450
- Kwang Soo.
- What?

985
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:07,289
- A red squirrel.
- A red squirrel?

986
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:08,290
Where?

987
00:44:08,291 --> 00:44:09,466
I didn't know they had red squirrels.

988
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:10,890
- Where is it?
- Up there.

989
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,260
- The coconut tree.
- You're right.

990
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,500
You're going to fall down.

991
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:16,700
(Jumping)

992
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:19,400
What is it going to get?

993
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:20,940
It's got showmanship.

994
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:23,809
Cute.

995
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:25,490
It's cute how the face is covered in sand.

996
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:28,139
Bring it over here. Come.

997
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,580
(There's also a cute dog.)

998
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:32,709
- Good job.
- It has picked you.

999
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:33,879
Good boy.

1000
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,426
(Placing the coconut
ball in front of Woo Bin)

1001
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:36,620
Be careful.

1002
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:39,220
One, two, three.

1003
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:42,360
(The dog almost caught it!)

1004
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:45,029
It wants you to throw it. It's
been doing that since earlier.

1005
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:46,130
(Throw it. Hurry up.)

1006
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:47,929
(Kwang Soo throws it this time.)

1007
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:49,060
- Far away?
- Up high.

1008
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,630
(Having fun with furry friends)

1009
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:55,900
What time is it?

1010
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:58,840
It's 4:19pm.

1011
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:00,679
We might not be able to
make it to the restaurant.

1012
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,510
- When does it close?
- At 6pm.

1013
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:06,650
What's with this tight expedition schedule?

1014
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:09,319
- We...
- Do you realize...

1015
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,690
all we've eaten is the
banana from this morning?

1016
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:14,189
- Isn't this a vacation?
- Food...

1017
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:15,459
This is a bit...

1018
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:17,860
We can have the in-flight
meal on our way back.

1019
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:20,129
The things we can only do here,

1020
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:22,059
right at this very moment.

1021
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:23,570
Though it's quite tough,

1022
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:25,400
if you think about it on our way back,

1023
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:27,369
you'll realize you made...

1024
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:28,870
the right choice back then.

1025
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:32,590
If it gets tougher than
this, we might actually die.

1026
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:35,640
(The employees feel differently.)

1027
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:37,279
- For dinner...
- Kwang Soo,

1028
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,219
why don't we get instant noodles
at a Korean supermarket today?

1029
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:41,419
I'm in.

1030
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:44,020
- Jjajang ramyeon and bibim ramyeon.
- Jjajang?

1031
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:45,890
I'm not sure if they'll
have jjajang ramyeon.

1032
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:47,789
I hope they have yeolmukimchi.

1033
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:49,719
- Gosh, that sounds nice.
- That'd be delicious.

1034
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:50,729
For real.

1035
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:53,630
(Gulping)

1036
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,199
If we do buy one, let's freeze it.

1037
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:57,600
- Make it crunchy.
- Okay.

1038
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:59,630
With a thin layer of ice.

1039
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,400
It'd be amazing if there
were a thin layer of ice.

1040
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:05,270
I'm craving green onion kimchi so badly.

1041
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:08,240
Instant noodles are the
best after a water party.

1042
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:09,879
You have to have it right away.

1043
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:12,210
(Excited at the thought
of eating instant noodles)

1044
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:18,220
(But in reality, they're filling
their stomachs with water.)

1045
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:24,830
(The parasailing is all set.)

1046
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:26,660
I don't feel good.

1047
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:28,599
(The auditor is still seasick.)

1048
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,120
I don't think it'll get better easily.

1049
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:34,370
(The thought of getting on
a boat again terrifies him.)

1050
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:39,070
Let's just do it.

1051
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:42,780
Our purpose is a cultural expedition.

1052
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:45,010
If I throw up,

1053
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,710
please blur it out.

1054
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:49,450
Blur it out, please.

1055
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:54,059
The viewers might root for you more.

1056
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:55,659
- True.
- Many people...

1057
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:57,089
have experienced seasickness.

1058
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:58,329
Yes, they'll get it.

1059
00:46:58,330 --> 00:47:00,359
- I'm still...
- Rather than blurring it out,

1060
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,720
it should be shown in slow motion.

1061
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:08,900
(They get on the boat to parasail.)

1062
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,909
- Okay, here?
- Yes.

1063
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:13,540
(CEO Lee puts on the safety belt first.)

1064
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:21,120
(The director and auditor have
also put their safety belts on.)

1065
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:23,479
Okay, people. Are you ready?

1066
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,549
- Ready!
- Ready!

1067
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,520
- Yes.
- Let's go, people.

1068
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,200
Be careful of the bar here.

1069
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:32,859
(Securing tightly to the safety belt)

1070
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:33,900
You're fine.

1071
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,000
It looks...

1072
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:37,500
(Staggering)

1073
00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:40,100
- It looks scarier than I thought.
- Totally.

1074
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:42,800
It's different from what I imagined.

1075
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:44,270
It's quite scary.

1076
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:49,710
(Extremely frightened)

1077
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:52,649
- Sorry?
- Sit down. All the way down.

1078
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:54,320
- Okay.
- Straighten your legs.

1079
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:55,979
(Settling their long legs down)

1080
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:57,666
- Sit down like I'm on a chair.
- Like this.

1081
00:47:57,690 --> 00:47:59,049
- Here.
- I see.

1082
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:00,220
- Okay.
- Okay?

1083
00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:04,860
(Ready to take off)

1084
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:06,360
(Exclaiming)

1085
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:08,430
(Floating)

1086
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:12,000
(Screaming)

1087
00:48:12,370 --> 00:48:13,740
(Screaming)

1088
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:18,840
(Going up using his entire face)

1089
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,439
It's different from what I thought.

1090
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,909
- Right?
- Totally.

1091
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:23,339
- It's fun.
- Yes.

1092
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:25,410
(The canopy goes up
higher at a fast speed.)

1093
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:27,119
We're high up.

1094
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,520
We're higher than I imagined.

1095
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:31,050
(Hi.)

1096
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:33,720
(Composed to the point of waving)

1097
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:36,020
(This feels great.)

1098
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:38,230
(Screaming)

1099
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:39,759
(One person has no room to wave.)

1100
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,330
It feels nice. Gosh.

1101
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,430
It's so pretty.

1102
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:44,500
My gosh.

1103
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:47,799
- Goodness.
- We're going up higher.

1104
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,000
This is beyond my imagination.

1105
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:52,639
It'd be nice if we could spot
fish in the sea from up here.

1106
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,840
(The emerald color of the
sea can be seen much better.)

1107
00:48:57,010 --> 00:48:58,150
Gosh.

1108
00:48:58,850 --> 00:49:00,350
We're really high up.

1109
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:09,020
(Calmed down, CEO Lee looks around.)

1110
00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:12,360
- This feels really nice.
- Yes, really nice.

1111
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:13,929
I know we'll be safe even if we fall.

1112
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:15,360
- Yes.
- I know, right?

1113
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,729
Even our shadows are pretty.

1114
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:19,670
Where? You're right.

1115
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:23,600
(Exclaiming)

1116
00:49:23,810 --> 00:49:25,510
It feels great.

1117
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:28,010
- I feel as if we're flying.
- Totally.

1118
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:32,249
This is how birds might feel...

1119
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:33,749
- when they fly...
- Yes.

1120
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:34,779
With their wings wide open.

1121
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:36,280
I fly like this in my dreams.

1122
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:37,619
- Really?
- Yes.

1123
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:38,620
- What?
- How pretty.

1124
00:49:38,621 --> 00:49:39,861
This is how I fly in my dreams.

1125
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,320
(Exclaiming)

1126
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:45,730
(Rocking due to the wind)

1127
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:47,160
I'm scared.

1128
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:50,570
(The parasailing is more
thrilling than imagined.)

1129
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,400
I'd love to dive from this far up.

1130
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,170
You're crazy.

1131
00:49:57,670 --> 00:49:59,839
(Screaming)

1132
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:03,380
(The director is enjoying the thrill.)

1133
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:05,509
- That's not a boat, is it?
- It's a boat.

1134
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:06,750
- It's that big?
- Yes.

1135
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:09,479
It's a rainbow!

1136
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:11,119
- A rainbow!
- It's a rainbow!

1137
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,420
- It's a rainbow!
- Take a video of it!

1138
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:16,190
(Overly excited at the
appearance of a rainbow)

1139
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:18,230
Everyone, take a video of it!

1140
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:20,600
(Laughing)

1141
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:21,900
It's pretty.

1142
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:23,760
Gosh.

1143
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:26,930
I'm loving it.

1144
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:33,810
(Mr. I-Don't-Like-Vacations
is enjoying it to the fullest.)

1145
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:41,080
(The expedition team
is slowly coming down.)

1146
00:50:42,850 --> 00:50:46,249
(They safely touch down!)

1147
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:47,619
- Stand up.
- Stand up?

1148
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:49,520
- Here.
- That was great.

1149
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:51,960
It's different from what you see down here.

1150
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:55,400
It actually felt like I was flying.

1151
00:50:55,930 --> 00:50:58,570
- That was really fun.
- I loved it.

1152
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:00,639
- It was amazing, Yeong Seok.
- Right?

1153
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,799
I felt like I was flying.

1154
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,369
- It's really refreshing.
- I was like a bird.

1155
00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:04,370
Good.

1156
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,380
- It feels so good.
- Feel so good

1157
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:11,010
This really makes it...

1158
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:13,009
in the top ten.

1159
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:15,119
- Top ten?
- It's different from rides.

1160
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:16,149
Really?

1161
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:18,849
On rides, you know
it'd be bad to drop down.

1162
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:20,120
But this one...

1163
00:51:20,890 --> 00:51:23,289
- It feels fine.
- Yes, it's like you're alive.

1164
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:25,090
That makes you enjoy it more.

1165
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:28,330
- And...
- Since there are no mountains,

1166
00:51:28,430 --> 00:51:30,030
you can see far out.

1167
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:34,540
How is it related to the
future of KKPP Foods?

1168
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:41,580
(Thinking)

1169
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:47,210
How is it related?

1170
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:58,930
(GBRB: Joy Pops Laugh Pops)

1171
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,929
Can't we grab a small bite...

1172
00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:02,060
- before leaving?
- Okay.

1173
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:05,070
How about we stop by that Thai place today?

1174
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:08,000
It takes 20 minutes.

1175
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:10,500
- Twenty?
- Yes, twenty minutes.

1176
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:12,140
It's 9.3km away.

1177
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:16,240
(Off to get food)

1178
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:19,450
That was the funniest
expression I've heard this year.

1179
00:52:19,610 --> 00:52:21,619
The "peed from happiness" was so hilarious,

1180
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:23,550
it keeps popping into my head.

1181
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,150
Like Amigo Nan Do,

1182
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:28,190
let's give him a nickname.

1183
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,590
Happy Pee Doh Kyung Soo.

1184
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,290
How about Pee Kyung Soo?

1185
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:34,730
- Pee Kyung Soo?
- Yes.

1186
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:38,170
Please don't think that I actually peed.

1187
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:41,669
I didn't pee.

1188
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:42,970
(I didn't pee.)

1189
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,810
(Glancing)

1190
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:49,910
Aren't you hot?

1191
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:51,280
I'm fine.

1192
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:56,420
(The CEO is walking on
eggshells for some reason.)

1193
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:01,560
Are you not hot? Is it cool?

1194
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:04,589
- What is it?
- What?

1195
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:05,630
What?

1196
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,600
(Bring it over.)

1197
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:10,260
(The seat heater is on.)

1198
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:12,569
(He had no idea.)

1199
00:53:12,570 --> 00:53:13,570
What is it?

1200
00:53:13,870 --> 00:53:16,270
Kwang Soo turned the seat
heater on, but he didn't know.

1201
00:53:18,210 --> 00:53:19,240
I see.

1202
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:22,010
I thought the sunlight was making me hot.

1203
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:23,839
I thought the sunlight was making me hot.

1204
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,149
(Everyone must be on guard...)

1205
00:53:25,150 --> 00:53:26,750
(when riding the expedition team's car.)

1206
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:29,720
Where should we book our room?

1207
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:33,120
- Kwang Soo, earlier...
- Yes?

1208
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:35,720
- Remember the beach we went to...
- Yes?

1209
00:53:35,890 --> 00:53:37,859
- after the whale shark sightseeing?
- Yes.

1210
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:40,630
- With a vibe...
- That was an island.

1211
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:45,000
It'd be really nice to stay
in a room with such a vibe.

1212
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,500
If possible, we could go...

1213
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,709
to a nearby island tomorrow.

1214
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:51,870
Shall I look into it?

1215
00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:53,610
- If we can...
- Is there an island?

1216
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:56,140
I'm sure there are many.

1217
00:53:57,510 --> 00:53:58,749
Right next to it...

1218
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:00,380
It's huge.

1219
00:54:01,450 --> 00:54:02,620
Cozumel.

1220
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:04,050
Cozumel.

1221
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:07,089
- It's close, Woo Bin.
- The island's name?

1222
00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:08,659
- Yes.
- It's right next to us.

1223
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:11,089
- The island?
- The island even has an airport.

1224
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:12,330
- Really?
- Yes.

1225
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:14,560
Do we take a flight there?

1226
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:17,499
No, it's super close from here,

1227
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:19,000
so I'm guessing we take a boat.

1228
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:20,430
(Sighing)

1229
00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:22,270
We have to ride another boat?

1230
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:24,869
- But...
- Is there another option?

1231
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:26,440
But it's...

1232
00:54:27,310 --> 00:54:29,280
It's really close, much
closer than we think.

1233
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:31,750
By boat, it's...

1234
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,279
At fast speed, it'd be a ten-minute ride.

1235
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,320
(It won't be a long ride.)

1236
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,319
I'll do some searching.

1237
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:39,640
(He looks for a room in Cozumel.)

1238
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,960
- Woo Bin.
- Yes?

1239
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:44,560
Pay 400 dollars, and there are 4 beds.

1240
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:46,430
Nice.

1241
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:49,229
(Looking closely)

1242
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:50,769
No, it's the photo that turned out nicely.

1243
00:54:50,770 --> 00:54:51,830
You're right.

1244
00:54:51,930 --> 00:54:53,699
- We can tell at a glance now.
- Of course.

1245
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:54,900
That'll be a nightmare.

1246
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,440
(The expedition team is
proficient in reserving rooms.)

1247
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:59,640
From what I see, since it's an island,

1248
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:02,240
there are many old rooms...

1249
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:04,980
despite it being 400 dollars.

1250
00:55:05,050 --> 00:55:06,449
Is it expensive? Like more?

1251
00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:07,520
Every place is expensive.

1252
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:08,679
For sure.

1253
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:09,720
(Bummed out)

1254
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:10,889
If only CEO Ko...

1255
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:13,010
would make a mistake and
add another zero at the end.

1256
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:15,360
That'd be amazing.

1257
00:55:15,590 --> 00:55:18,389
But Jun Wi won't let it pass.

1258
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:19,560
That's true.

1259
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:21,659
Let's discuss things when we get home...

1260
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:22,660
after some food.

1261
00:55:22,661 --> 00:55:23,729
- Okay.
- Okay.

1262
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:24,869
(They agree to decide on
the room in the evening.)

1263
00:55:24,870 --> 00:55:27,099
I didn't think the rooms would
be expensive on the island.

1264
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:28,300
They are expensive, Kwang Soo.

1265
00:55:29,570 --> 00:55:31,310
There's a supermarket right here.

1266
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:34,280
- We can stop by the supermarket.
- Nice.

1267
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:36,239
- I hope they have instant noodles.
- For real.

1268
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,310
If only they had jjajang ramyeon.

1269
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:40,920
Is that the place? That's the place.

1270
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:44,950
I'm excited.

1271
00:55:45,890 --> 00:55:47,990
(Hidden within a quiet alley)

1272
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:49,220
You're hungry, right?

1273
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:51,159
Are you not?

1274
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:52,660
(A quiet Thai restaurant)

1275
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:57,800
(They're going to have a
very late lunch at 5:40pm.)

1276
00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:00,370
Your face is very tanned, Kyung Soo.

1277
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:03,070
- My face stings a little.
- Right?

1278
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:05,769
- You are...
- My shoulders are on fire.

1279
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:07,110
It must really sting.

1280
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:08,910
- You're practically sunburnt.
- Right?

1281
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,180
What do I do?

1282
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:12,850
Your neck.

1283
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:15,680
- What were you wearing?
- Why?

1284
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:17,080
There's a tan line right here.

1285
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:19,420
The microphone wire.

1286
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:23,489
I've got a microphone tan line...

1287
00:56:23,490 --> 00:56:24,490
- on my neck.
- Jung Min.

1288
00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:27,899
This looks like the microphone wire.

1289
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:30,130
(There's a clear tan line
around Woo Bin's neck.)

1290
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:33,370
At least he protected that much.

1291
00:56:33,930 --> 00:56:35,610
She said at least you protected this much.

1292
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:39,140
How very optimistic of her.

1293
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,240
She's thought the complete opposite.

1294
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:43,579
- That's something to learn.
- Absolutely.

1295
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:45,610
At least I protected this much.

1296
00:56:45,850 --> 00:56:47,150
She's right.

1297
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:49,749
Why didn't I think like her?

1298
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:52,250
Thanks to the bracelet,
I protected this much.

1299
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,860
- We protected this much, Kwang Soo.
- Yes.

1300
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:57,889
(Impressed)

1301
00:56:57,890 --> 00:56:59,430
I protected this much.

1302
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:01,099
- What's this?
- What's that tanned mark?

1303
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:02,629
- The bracelet.
- The bracelet?

1304
00:57:02,630 --> 00:57:04,799
- The ticket bracelet?
- The ticket bracelet.

1305
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,640
(The expedition team
earned grateful stripes.)

1306
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:08,040
Thank you.

1307
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,399
Look, guys.

1308
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,110
- I already picked some.
- Okay.

1309
00:57:11,370 --> 00:57:13,439
It's shrimp Cajun salad.

1310
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,709
You have it on top of
guacamole and tortilla chips.

1311
00:57:15,710 --> 00:57:17,150
- That sounds good.
- And dumplings.

1312
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:19,380
What's this? Pho bo?

1313
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:22,819
- It looks good.
- It's that red thing.

1314
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:24,389
- Isn't it red pho?
- Mint and basil.

1315
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:25,519
It's red pho.

1316
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,920
It's like tom yum pho.

1317
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:29,160
Shall we try it?

1318
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:30,819
- I'm in.
- This, not that?

1319
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:31,929
- Yes.
- Yes.

1320
00:57:31,930 --> 00:57:33,159
I think that's enough.

1321
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:34,360
- Okay.
- How many is that?

1322
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:37,529
- One, two, - There aren't any to take out.

1323
00:57:37,530 --> 00:57:38,900
- three, - The portion is small.

1324
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,240
Four, somtam,

1325
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,799
and five.

1326
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,410
- Six.
- Pad Thai.

1327
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:45,909
Six is too much.

1328
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:46,910
Let's take one out.

1329
00:57:46,911 --> 00:57:48,180
How about somtam?

1330
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:50,509
I think we should have it.

1331
00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:52,680
(Somtam is a must at Thai restaurants.)

1332
00:57:52,850 --> 00:57:54,170
Should we take the dumplings out?

1333
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:55,420
Let's do that, Kwang Soo.

1334
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:58,189
- Okay. Six is...
- Fully Thai?

1335
00:57:58,190 --> 00:58:00,749
Yes, six is stirring my sense of guilt.

1336
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:02,090
(They decide to order five.)

1337
00:58:02,590 --> 00:58:03,860
Shrimp.

1338
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:05,530
- One.
- Okay.

1339
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:08,499
- One somtam.
- Okay.

1340
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:10,159
Spicy or not spicy?

1341
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,530
- Spicy.
- Okay.

1342
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,969
- They have your favorite.
- I want that.

1343
00:58:13,970 --> 00:58:15,346
- Your favorite lemon water.
- Fresca.

1344
00:58:15,370 --> 00:58:17,539
- Fresca?
- Fresca.

1345
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:18,769
- Three.
- Fresca.

1346
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:20,710
(After ordering the
director's favorite drink)

1347
00:58:20,870 --> 00:58:22,539
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1348
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,950
(They've made the order.)

1349
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:30,850
(The CEO takes out his phone
as if reminded of something.)

1350
00:58:32,290 --> 00:58:35,720
(He's checking something.)

1351
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:40,830
What? "Approved."

1352
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:42,360
Has it been approved?

1353
00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:44,260
It's been approved.

1354
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,500
(The head office approved
the special expense.)

1355
00:58:47,530 --> 00:58:49,116
- "Reason for approval."
- "Reason for approval."

1356
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:52,339
"One. I fully understand why the
extra special expense is needed,"

1357
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:54,169
"approving the additional 3,500 dollars."

1358
00:58:54,170 --> 00:58:55,180
Nice.

1359
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:58,179
"However, some of the reasons
behind needing the special expense..."

1360
00:58:58,180 --> 00:58:59,479
"had room for improvement."

1361
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:01,119
What's wrong with him?

1362
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,350
(What's wrong with him?)

1363
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:04,850
He's so nitpicky.

1364
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:08,619
"You said Director Doh
Kyung Soo would show..."

1365
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:10,619
"improved cooking skills through..."

1366
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:13,180
"the various cuisines experienced
in Mexico in the next season."

1367
00:59:13,290 --> 00:59:14,860
"Therefore, I suggest holding..."

1368
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:17,029
"a KKPP Foods..."

1369
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:20,169
"Mexico Cultural Expedition Briefing
Session and New Menu Release..."

1370
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:22,769
"on the day and place you decide on..."

1371
00:59:22,770 --> 00:59:24,910
"before this year ends."

1372
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:27,570
"Three. Lastly,"

1373
00:59:27,810 --> 00:59:29,039
"if you can afford it,"

1374
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,539
"how about warming the
hearts of the production crew..."

1375
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:32,050
"with a get-together?"

1376
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:33,679
"You may proceed..."

1377
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:36,319
"with the get-together..."

1378
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,420
"after discussing the expense with Jun Wi."

1379
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:40,489
That means the get-together expense...

1380
00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:41,759
- is separate.
- Yes.

1381
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,859
"Explore the culture
during the remaining time..."

1382
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:46,160
"and return safely." The end.

1383
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:48,859
(They received 3,500
dollars as a special expense.)

1384
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:50,330
- Good.
- Congratulations.

1385
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:51,870
Even a get-together expense.

1386
00:59:52,770 --> 00:59:55,170
CEO Ko is quite generous.

1387
00:59:55,270 --> 00:59:56,600
But why did he have to...

1388
00:59:56,870 --> 00:59:58,540
He could've said everything looked fine.

1389
00:59:59,110 --> 01:00:00,169
"Room for improvement."

1390
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:02,310
There was no reason to add that.

1391
01:00:02,410 --> 01:00:04,550
(CEO Lee holds grudges.)

1392
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:06,910
And here, Kwang Soo.

1393
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:08,779
In the last part...

1394
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:09,919
CEO Ko said,

1395
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:14,490
"I suggest holding."

1396
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:17,759
"Therefore, I suggest
holding a KKPP Foods..."

1397
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:20,689
"Mexico Cultural Expedition
Briefing Session..."

1398
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:22,560
"and New Menu Release."

1399
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:25,429
Shouldn't he follow
the six basic principles?

1400
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:26,600
Right?

1401
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:29,870
- Like when and where?
- Yes.

1402
01:00:29,970 --> 01:00:33,140
We should ask him to make it clear.

1403
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:35,840
Let's send a rejected mail first.

1404
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,110
Reply with...

1405
01:00:38,650 --> 01:00:39,850
a "rejected."

1406
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:43,420
It's a suggestion. You can just ignore it.

1407
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:45,149
I don't know, but I can get a good sleep...

1408
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:46,750
only after sending a rejection mail.

1409
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,560
(It seems like he has a lot bottled up.)

1410
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:52,960
CEO Ko said to have a
get-together with everyone.

1411
01:00:53,090 --> 01:00:55,030
- That can wait until the last day.
- True.

1412
01:00:55,530 --> 01:00:57,000
It's already here.

1413
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:59,970
(All that's left is to enjoy the meal.)

1414
01:01:00,170 --> 01:01:01,439
(Impressed)

1415
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,699
It's somtam.

1416
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:03,940
- Is this somtam?
- Yes.

1417
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:05,509
It's like Thai kimchi.

1418
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:06,709
(A national salad-like menu in Thailand)

1419
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:08,216
(Made with sliced papaya,
garlic, chili, fish sauce, and more)

1420
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:09,340
Let's dig in.

1421
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:12,380
(Somtam has been
served first as an appetizer.)

1422
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:14,750
- Let's do it.
- In 1, 2, and 3.

1423
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:17,680
(As always, they have
the first bite together.)

1424
01:01:17,890 --> 01:01:19,690
(Amazed)

1425
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:22,220
(He tries another bite right away.)

1426
01:01:22,290 --> 01:01:23,820
- It's delicious.
- It's really good.

1427
01:01:24,690 --> 01:01:28,600
(It's a taste they can't
stop going for more.)

1428
01:01:31,170 --> 01:01:34,170
(Even the crunchy sound is nice.)

1429
01:01:34,470 --> 01:01:35,700
It's spicy.

1430
01:01:35,870 --> 01:01:38,110
It's the perfect substitute for kimchi.

1431
01:01:39,610 --> 01:01:41,379
(An appetizer that gives you an appetite)

1432
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:42,480
It's really good.

1433
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:46,280
There's a saying behind Thai restaurants.

1434
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:48,780
When somtam is good, it's the same as...

1435
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:51,319
when an Italian place...

1436
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,019
is considered authentic...

1437
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:55,060
- when aglio e olio is good.
- Somtam?

1438
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:57,419
Just like salsa in Mexico.

1439
01:01:57,420 --> 01:01:58,730
Exactly, like salsa in Mexico.

1440
01:01:59,730 --> 01:02:01,630
Wait, isn't it that?

1441
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:03,529
Gua...

1442
01:02:03,530 --> 01:02:04,970
- Guacamole?
- Yes.

1443
01:02:05,370 --> 01:02:06,870
- What do we dip that in?
- Shrimp.

1444
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:10,600
(Exclaiming)

1445
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:11,939
It looks good.

1446
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:13,369
- Thank you.
- This looks amazing.

1447
01:02:13,370 --> 01:02:14,639
(Guacamole shrimp)

1448
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,680
(Guacamole with seasoned
shrimp and tortilla chips)

1449
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:18,500
- Shall we?
- The portion is big.

1450
01:02:19,050 --> 01:02:21,280
Put one shrimp on top.

1451
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:27,850
(They're ready after
topping the tortilla chips.)

1452
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:30,320
In 1, 2, and 3.

1453
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:33,760
(Trying a mouthful)

1454
01:02:34,490 --> 01:02:35,659
(Frowning activated)

1455
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:36,860
It's smoky.

1456
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,370
(Crunchy)

1457
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:41,100
(Impressed)

1458
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,070
It's smoky.

1459
01:02:44,370 --> 01:02:45,709
(Amazed)

1460
01:02:45,710 --> 01:02:46,909
(Frowning as soon as he tries it)

1461
01:02:46,910 --> 01:02:48,039
It's delicious.

1462
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:49,410
(Frowning as soon as he tries it)

1463
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:51,950
The smokiness has been added to the shrimp.

1464
01:02:53,510 --> 01:02:55,020
They must fry it...

1465
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:56,280
in a wok.

1466
01:02:58,250 --> 01:03:00,620
(This is the secret behind the smokiness.)

1467
01:03:01,150 --> 01:03:03,160
How does it mix so well with the shrimp?

1468
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:07,090
(Showing respect for his
amazing cooking skills)

1469
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:09,000
This is just too good.

1470
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,440
- Delicious.
- The combination works.

1471
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:18,169
(Their chopsticks are moving busily.)

1472
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:19,840
I love the texture.

1473
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:22,479
It's our first guacamole in Mexico.

1474
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,310
It's delicious. You're right.

1475
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:27,010
This recipe is worth taking back to Korea.

1476
01:03:27,050 --> 01:03:28,149
It's easy.

1477
01:03:28,150 --> 01:03:29,220
I love it.

1478
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,619
It's the tangy sauce.

1479
01:03:31,620 --> 01:03:32,790
It blends in so well.

1480
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:35,490
It gives you an appetite.

1481
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:40,930
(A mouthful with a mountain of guacamole)

1482
01:03:44,130 --> 01:03:45,870
(Satisfied)

1483
01:03:46,130 --> 01:03:48,100
The guacamole is awesome.

1484
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:50,639
What's it made of? Avocado and what else?

1485
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:53,840
(For a change, they lock in
culinary expedition team mode.)

1486
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:55,079
Let's see.

1487
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:56,240
Avocado,

1488
01:03:56,710 --> 01:03:59,049
lime, lemon, salt,

1489
01:03:59,050 --> 01:04:00,380
and onions.

1490
01:04:00,510 --> 01:04:02,680
Tomato is also added.

1491
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:04,820
Or even Cheongyang chili pepper.

1492
01:04:05,290 --> 01:04:07,089
Garlic. It varies.

1493
01:04:07,090 --> 01:04:08,719
This guacamole has no garlic, chili,

1494
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,260
or any of those.

1495
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:15,159
The avocado is the core of this guacamole.

1496
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:17,359
It's good because the
ingredients are fresh.

1497
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:18,429
Yes.

1498
01:04:18,430 --> 01:04:21,170
(As expected, the restaurant
competes with basicness.)

1499
01:04:21,570 --> 01:04:23,040
- Isn't it good?
- Yes.

1500
01:04:23,870 --> 01:04:25,540
Honestly, I want to lick the plate.

1501
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:31,040
(Meanwhile, in the kitchen)

1502
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:38,350
(Making the next dishes without a break)

1503
01:04:38,790 --> 01:04:40,119
(Stunned)

1504
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:42,259
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1505
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:43,390
(In bliss)

1506
01:04:43,890 --> 01:04:45,129
Thank you.

1507
01:04:45,130 --> 01:04:47,160
(It's time to try the main dishes.)

1508
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,700
(Thai stir-fried noodles, pad Thai)

1509
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:54,300
(Glossy fried rice)

1510
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:56,139
Is this the last one?

1511
01:04:56,140 --> 01:04:57,900
(And hot red rice noodles)

1512
01:04:58,470 --> 01:05:00,670
- This looks really good.
- I know.

1513
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,339
When you add that to the hot food,

1514
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:05,010
the smell of pepper becomes so strong.

1515
01:05:06,810 --> 01:05:10,350
(Trying the pad Thai first)

1516
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:16,360
(Savoring quietly with his eyes closed)

1517
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:21,260
(The director moves it
to the spoon and eats.)

1518
01:05:24,970 --> 01:05:27,570
(CEO Lee grabs a mouthful and slurps.)

1519
01:05:28,670 --> 01:05:29,739
This is really good.

1520
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:34,440
(The protein lover
becomes a carb lover today.)

1521
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:36,880
This is a place to visit
when you're in Cancun.

1522
01:05:36,910 --> 01:05:38,950
(Agreed)

1523
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:45,520
(The best choice after
the whale shark tour)

1524
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:46,949
What is this again?

1525
01:05:46,950 --> 01:05:48,220
The pineapple fried rice?

1526
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:51,990
(The dish exploration continues.)

1527
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:54,690
It's sweet. It's kind of sweet.

1528
01:05:54,830 --> 01:05:55,910
Do you want me to add this?

1529
01:05:57,630 --> 01:06:01,470
(Have a sip of soup when you feel greasy.)

1530
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:04,770
The soup is good.

1531
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:10,910
(While eating, )

1532
01:06:14,210 --> 01:06:17,020
(they emptied all the dishes.)

1533
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:19,090
I'm so full.

1534
01:06:19,990 --> 01:06:21,590
I ate like crazy.

1535
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:24,159
- What?
- I ate like crazy.

1536
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:26,760
(The turbulent meal ends.)

1537
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:33,300
(GBRB: Joy Pops Laugh Pops)

1538
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:37,340
(They stopped by at the
market to buy late night snacks.)

1539
01:06:39,510 --> 01:06:41,240
I think there's AC.

1540
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:43,980
Nice.

1541
01:06:44,910 --> 01:06:46,050
It's cool.

1542
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:48,749
- This place feels like abroad.
- I know.

1543
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:49,750
(A supermarket to enjoy
the local atmosphere)

1544
01:06:49,751 --> 01:06:51,590
- I feel great.
- Me too.

1545
01:06:52,390 --> 01:06:53,589
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes?

1546
01:06:53,590 --> 01:06:56,889
Shall we get a hat for Jun Wi?

1547
01:06:56,890 --> 01:06:58,190
- For a gift?
- Yes.

1548
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:02,700
I think Jun Wi was
wearing something like this.

1549
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:06,369
- Right.
- I think he had a shirt like this.

1550
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:08,269
- He has something like this.
- Yes.

1551
01:07:08,270 --> 01:07:09,370
Right?

1552
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:11,770
- Get this?
- Or buy two...

1553
01:07:12,010 --> 01:07:14,339
for Jun Wi and his wife?

1554
01:07:14,340 --> 01:07:16,480
As matching hats?

1555
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:19,780
There's gray.

1556
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:22,580
- Oh, that's perfect for Jun Wi.
- Exactly.

1557
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:25,720
Should we get two?

1558
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:27,489
- These two?
- To make him confused...

1559
01:07:27,490 --> 01:07:28,959
about what to wear?

1560
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:30,189
He'll be torn for sure.

1561
01:07:30,190 --> 01:07:31,830
- So he'd like both?
- Yes.

1562
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:33,130
Let's do that.

1563
01:07:33,430 --> 01:07:35,899
His wife might wear this.

1564
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:36,930
Right.

- Shall we?

The apple looks good too.

1570
01:07:49,010 --> 01:07:50,490
Let's have an apple tomorrow morning.

1571
01:07:50,710 --> 01:07:51,750
That sounds good.

1572
01:07:53,410 --> 01:07:55,680
Can you hold this? I'll take a look.

1573
01:07:56,020 --> 01:07:59,420
(Director Doh is off to explore ramyeon.)

1574
01:07:59,890 --> 01:08:02,220
- Get one each? It's not that big.
- Okay.

1575
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:04,220
That and one of these?

1576
01:08:04,590 --> 01:08:05,760
Get two of those?

1577
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:08,059
Let's put them separately.

1580
01:08:13,270 --> 01:08:15,590
Seeing Kyung Soo isn't coming,
I guess there's no ramyeon.

1581
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:20,810
Ramyeon should be somewhere here.

1582
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:23,410
Wait. There it is.

1583
01:08:24,310 --> 01:08:26,410
(Director Doh found the ramyeon shelf.)

1584
01:08:27,150 --> 01:08:30,019
(Touching)

1585
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:32,220
(It's not Korean ramyeon.)

1586
01:08:32,620 --> 01:08:34,750
I want Korean ramyeon so badly.

1587
01:08:34,990 --> 01:08:36,990
(But he doesn't see Korean ramyeon.)

1588
01:08:37,060 --> 01:08:38,690
Korean ramyeon...

1589
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:40,660
I want it so badly.

1590
01:08:41,630 --> 01:08:42,830
Where did he go?

1591
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:45,130
There he is.

1592
01:08:45,530 --> 01:08:46,630
He must've found ramyeon.

(Spotting Director Doh hovering)

1594
01:08:49,740 --> 01:08:51,609
- Is there ramyeon?
- Where is it?

1595
01:08:51,610 --> 01:08:54,270
I don't even know what
kind of ramyeon it is.

1596
01:08:54,810 --> 01:08:56,710
Maybe it's sold out.

1597
01:08:56,910 --> 01:08:59,350
- We can always find Shin ramyeon.
- I can't believe it.

1598
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:02,819
Kwang Soo, let's get something else.

1599
01:09:02,820 --> 01:09:03,849
Sure.

1600
01:09:03,850 --> 01:09:05,370
(They said they'd give up on ramyeon.)

1601
01:09:05,650 --> 01:09:07,949
A store this big might have ramyeon.

1602
01:09:07,950 --> 01:09:10,190
It might be in the
grocery section over there.

1603
01:09:11,390 --> 01:09:13,960
Not here.

1604
01:09:14,730 --> 01:09:17,099
Here...

1605
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:18,970
- No.
- Never mind.

1606
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:20,900
It should be somewhere here.

1607
01:09:21,530 --> 01:09:23,339
I thought this was ramyeon, but never mind.

1608
01:09:23,340 --> 01:09:24,369
It's beans.

1609
01:09:24,370 --> 01:09:25,930
(Checking every corner to find ramyeon)

1610
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:28,310
I can't believe it. They
don't have ramyeon?

1611
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:29,580
Wait.

1612
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:31,340
- I found Shin Ramyeon.
- Where?

1613
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:34,450
- Shin Ramyeon.
- Oh, Shin Ramyeon spicy flavor.

1614
01:09:34,610 --> 01:09:35,920
- There it is.
- Hey.

1615
01:09:35,950 --> 01:09:36,950
(Flinching)

1616
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:38,720
Sorry.

1617
01:09:39,350 --> 01:09:41,310
(He got worked up to find
the land of K-ramyeon.)

1618
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:42,489
- Then...
- We can have...

1619
01:09:42,490 --> 01:09:44,020
two of each, right?

1620
01:09:45,090 --> 01:09:46,830
- Let's get two and three.
- Two and three?

1621
01:09:46,990 --> 01:09:48,800
(Choosing ramyeon that they want to have)

1622
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:50,399
Is there kimchi?

1623
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:52,329
- Probably.
- Am I asking for too much?

1624
01:09:52,330 --> 01:09:54,070
Do you want me to check again?

1625
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:56,800
- I'll go take a look.
- Where?

1626
01:09:57,570 --> 01:09:58,769
- To find kimchi.
- Let's go together.

1627
01:09:58,770 --> 01:09:59,940
We got everything we need.

1628
01:10:00,310 --> 01:10:02,610
You're not even good at
finding. Why are you going alone?

1629
01:10:02,710 --> 01:10:04,790
(His performance is low
compared to his enthusiasm.)

1630
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:07,150
Kimchi would be here somewhere.

1631
01:10:08,650 --> 01:10:11,020
(Looking for kimchi with their best)

1632
01:10:11,850 --> 01:10:13,390
I don't think they have kimchi.

1633
01:10:13,850 --> 01:10:14,850
Right?

1634
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:18,506
There are pickles. Should
we get pickles at least?

1635
01:10:18,530 --> 01:10:19,990
- What?
- Pickles?

1636
01:10:20,830 --> 01:10:21,900
How about this?

1637
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:23,980
- Sounds good.
- It's chopped. For a side dish.

1638
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:25,669
- That's good.
- How...

1639
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:27,100
(Startled)

1640
01:10:27,170 --> 01:10:28,369
- How about this?
- That sounds good.

1641
01:10:28,370 --> 01:10:29,439
It's the pickles.

1642
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:30,646
- I'm okay with that.
- That sounds good.

1643
01:10:30,670 --> 01:10:31,670
Let's go.

1644
01:10:31,770 --> 01:10:33,730
(Moving to the cashier
after getting the pickles)

1645
01:10:34,370 --> 01:10:35,910
(Sniffing)

1646
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:37,880
(Sniffing)

1647
01:10:37,940 --> 01:10:39,050
Gosh.

1648
01:10:40,210 --> 01:10:42,350
I didn't know this smell was from me.

1649
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:44,449
It's permeated.

1650
01:10:44,450 --> 01:10:45,496
(Director Doh recognized
a mysterious smell.)

1651
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:47,620
It's the sweat and the T-shirt.

1652
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:49,590
Everything got mixed up.

1653
01:10:50,590 --> 01:10:52,560
(Smelling again)

1654
01:10:56,060 --> 01:10:59,729
(Do I smell too?)

1655
01:10:59,730 --> 01:11:00,800
Gosh...

1656
01:11:01,430 --> 01:11:02,939
I smelled it in the car too.

1657
01:11:02,940 --> 01:11:04,870
I know. I didn't know it was from me.

1658
01:11:06,770 --> 01:11:08,810
I'm suddenly in pain.

1659
01:11:09,110 --> 01:11:10,810
It's painful when you realize it.

1660
01:11:10,940 --> 01:11:12,950
When you disappeared to find ramyeon,

1661
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:14,510
I found you by smell.

1662
01:11:14,910 --> 01:11:15,950
Seriously?

1663
01:11:16,750 --> 01:11:18,149
- You weren't...
- "There he is."

1664
01:11:18,150 --> 01:11:19,150
(He spotted Kyung Soo!)

1665
01:11:20,420 --> 01:11:21,990
You know how I found out?

1666
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:23,990
I was alone.

1667
01:11:24,190 --> 01:11:26,360
And the smell wasn't going away.

1668
01:11:26,430 --> 01:11:28,270
I was like, "Where is
this smell coming from?"

1669
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,159
Did you think that wouldn't be you?

1670
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:31,729
I never thought that was from me.

1671
01:11:31,730 --> 01:11:35,700
I thought it was one of you.

1672
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,639
When you were in front of me,

1673
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,940
I kind of smelled you.

1674
01:11:42,310 --> 01:11:43,839
Then I realized it wasn't you.

1675
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:45,150
So I realized it was Kyung Soo.

1676
01:11:46,610 --> 01:11:48,979
- Because...
- Honestly, I thought...

1677
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:50,620
it was your feet.

1678
01:11:52,050 --> 01:11:54,920
(They were suspecting each
other deep down in their hearts.)

1679
01:11:55,390 --> 01:11:57,019
(Discomfort in his face)

1680
01:11:57,020 --> 01:11:58,060
Kyung Soo.

1681
01:11:58,260 --> 01:11:59,459
Will you step back?

1682
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:01,259
(Keeping a distance)

1683
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:05,130
I want to walk around naked. I'm serious.

1684
01:12:05,630 --> 01:12:08,540
It was stuck in the closet for five years.

1685
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,200
Then I laundered it.

1686
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:13,439
And in the most humid place,

1687
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:14,909
- for a week...
- I'm sorry,

1688
01:12:14,910 --> 01:12:16,409
but can you have the interview over there?

1689
01:12:16,410 --> 01:12:18,779
It was there for a week.
That's what it smells like.

1690
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:20,079
Kyung Soo, I'm sorry.

1691
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:21,150
But I'm serious.

1692
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:23,280
(Kyung Soo)

1693
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:28,190
Shoot.

1694
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:31,360
(Keeping a distance from Doh Kyung Soo)

1695
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:33,589
Kyung Soo, will you go ahead first?

1696
01:12:33,590 --> 01:12:35,429
Okay. No, I should walk behind you.

1697
01:12:35,430 --> 01:12:37,560
Right. The smell is coming.

1698
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:41,429
Will you not stand behind me?

1699
01:12:41,430 --> 01:12:42,970
Walk in front of me first.

1700
01:12:43,870 --> 01:12:46,339
(The eventful late night
snack shopping is over.)

1701
01:12:46,340 --> 01:12:47,410
(Rummaging)

1702
01:12:48,010 --> 01:12:50,579
Take it off at home.

1703
01:12:50,580 --> 01:12:52,080
This is too painful.

1704
01:12:53,650 --> 01:12:58,120
(Returning to the accommodation neatly)

1705
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:01,450
Gosh.

1706
01:13:01,820 --> 01:13:03,320
What's wrong with my face?

1707
01:13:03,790 --> 01:13:05,160
You're so dark.

1708
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:08,129
I turned red too.

1709
01:13:08,130 --> 01:13:10,829
I'm not red. I'm tanned.

1710
01:13:10,830 --> 01:13:12,730
(The aftereffect of the tour is intense.)

1711
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,269
- Nice.
- Oh, it's cool.

1712
01:13:16,270 --> 01:13:18,570
(The expedition team
returns to the pleasant room.)

1713
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:22,140
(They decided to have
time to do their own things.)

1714
01:13:23,010 --> 01:13:26,010
(CEO Lee is having beauty care.)

1715
01:13:26,580 --> 01:13:29,780
(Director Doh is looking
for another delicious place.)

1716
01:13:30,350 --> 01:13:33,890
(What is Auditor Kim doing?)

1717
01:13:34,490 --> 01:13:37,520
(He's organizing the
receipts without a break.)

1718
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:44,030
(Knocking)

1719
01:13:44,730 --> 01:13:47,800
(He's organizing the
receipts without a break.)

1720
01:13:52,540 --> 01:13:54,039
(Knocking)

1721
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:55,240
Yes?

1722
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:58,680
I haven't organized the receipts yet.

1723
01:13:59,010 --> 01:14:00,580
Give me some time.

1724
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:03,749
Put the bracelet.

1725
01:14:03,750 --> 01:14:06,110
(Organizing the receipts
regardless of the production crew)

1726
01:14:09,460 --> 01:14:12,089
(Laughing)

1727
01:14:12,090 --> 01:14:13,830
- What?
- What?

1728
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:15,629
(The production crew has
arrived even before he knew.)

1729
01:14:15,630 --> 01:14:17,900
Seriously,

1730
01:14:19,030 --> 01:14:21,029
you're not going to stop until
someone passes out, are you?

1731
01:14:21,030 --> 01:14:22,199
(You're not going to stop until
someone passes out, are you?)

1732
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:23,470
Is it not going to be over...

1733
01:14:23,670 --> 01:14:27,010
until someone begs you with tears?

1734
01:14:27,110 --> 01:14:29,510
Look at him. He's all tanned.

1735
01:14:30,740 --> 01:14:32,350
With the receipts...

1736
01:14:32,710 --> 01:14:34,450
He's Kim Woo Bin.

1737
01:14:35,620 --> 01:14:37,049
(Kim Woo Bin, actor with
15 years of experience)

1738
01:14:37,050 --> 01:14:38,820
(The auditor of KKPP Foods)

1739
01:14:39,090 --> 01:14:40,719
(Right now, he's organizing the receipts.)

1740
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:42,420
Kwang Soo, I have only one left.

1741
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:44,059
At 6:15am...

1742
01:14:44,060 --> 01:14:45,590
Wait. This is from the gas station.

1743
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:47,029
Eight hundred and ninety.

1744
01:14:47,030 --> 01:14:48,059
- Yes.
- Yes.

1745
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:49,536
- Eight hundred and ninety-one.
- That was the exact amount.

1746
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:50,899
I thought I saw the
receipt for the gas station.

1747
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:52,000
What is this?

1748
01:14:52,430 --> 01:14:53,470
What is this 120 dollars?

1749
01:14:53,570 --> 01:14:54,599
When?

1750
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:56,639
At 6:18am.

1751
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:59,040
(A mysterious 120-dollar receipt)

1752
01:14:59,310 --> 01:15:02,239
We didn't do anything
three minutes after fueling.

1753
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:03,520
- Right?
- We just kept driving.

1754
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:06,109
- That...
- Oh, should I check...

1755
01:15:06,110 --> 01:15:07,909
- the statement?
- Sure.

1756
01:15:07,910 --> 01:15:09,480
(Checking the credit card statement)

1757
01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:12,190
How much is 120 dollars?

1758
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:15,420
It's 160,000 won. It's worth 160,000 won.

1759
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:17,490
(They were driving at the time.)

1760
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:19,990
What did we do three
minutes after fueling up?

1761
01:15:20,630 --> 01:15:21,890
We didn't do anything.

1762
01:15:22,530 --> 01:15:23,860
And spent 120 dollars?

1763
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,199
- Leave that out for now.
- Okay.

1764
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:27,670
I'm done now.

1765
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:29,239
We might remember while talking.

1766
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:30,846
(They leave out one mysterious
receipt and start settling it.)

1767
01:15:30,870 --> 01:15:31,940
Jun Wi.

1768
01:15:32,410 --> 01:15:33,610
Are you ready for the meeting?

1769
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:38,180
(He suddenly enters his room.)

1770
01:15:38,850 --> 01:15:40,250
- Jun Wi.
- What did we eat?

1771
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:41,510
Here.

1772
01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:45,280
We got you gifts.

1773
01:15:45,490 --> 01:15:48,649
We carefully picked...

1774
01:15:48,650 --> 01:15:50,319
the color you'd like.

1775
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,959
- For you to wear with your wife.
- Thank you.

1776
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:54,059
Here.

1777
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:55,599
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1778
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:56,900
(A small gift from the juniors)

1779
01:15:57,030 --> 01:15:58,530
Which color do you like more?

1780
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,799
My wife likes green.

1781
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:02,200
(Exclaiming)

1782
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:03,899
That's great.

1783
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:05,220
(The gift found a perfect owner.)

1784
01:16:05,810 --> 01:16:08,139
Let's first settle...

1785
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:09,710
the receipts from two days ago.

1786
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:12,810
(Settling the expedition
cost from Day 4 to Day 6)

1787
01:16:13,010 --> 01:16:14,250
The rent-a-car.

1788
01:16:14,310 --> 01:16:16,949
We rented a car...

1789
01:16:16,950 --> 01:16:18,350
for 334 dollars.

1790
01:16:18,450 --> 01:16:19,890
And...

1791
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:23,190
- We had ramen after that.
- Okay.

1792
01:16:24,020 --> 01:16:25,260
The ramen place.

1793
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:26,690
Take a look.

1794
01:16:27,130 --> 01:16:28,430
And the toll.

1795
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:30,029
The gas, in the morning.

1796
01:16:30,030 --> 01:16:31,500
The supermarket tonight.

1797
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:32,969
That's done.

1798
01:16:32,970 --> 01:16:34,469
(Careful)

1799
01:16:34,470 --> 01:16:36,939
This 120-dollar receipt...

1800
01:16:36,940 --> 01:16:38,840
(Only the 120-dollar receipt remains.)

1801
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:40,709
It's a big amount.

1802
01:16:40,710 --> 01:16:41,939
- Right.
- We can't let it slide.

1803
01:16:41,940 --> 01:16:43,810
I know. Hold on.

1804
01:16:43,980 --> 01:16:46,910
Jun Wi, weren't you there with us?

1805
01:16:47,110 --> 01:16:49,320
It's 6am in the morning?

1806
01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:51,049
It says "adventure."

1807
01:16:51,050 --> 01:16:53,290
It sounds like a tour.

1808
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:56,360
- Did you buy something?
- On the whale shark tour...

1809
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:58,959
- The tour?
- Either the tour or...

1810
01:16:58,960 --> 01:16:59,960
- You bought the hats.
- But...

1811
01:16:59,961 --> 01:17:01,230
- at the time...
- That's it.

1812
01:17:01,330 --> 01:17:02,729
Woo Bin bought the hats with his own money.

1813
01:17:02,730 --> 01:17:03,759
I paid my own money.

1814
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:05,099
- Then this doesn't count.
- It's my own...

1815
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:06,100
I paid with my own card.

1816
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:07,929
(The mystery's solved.)

1817
01:17:07,930 --> 01:17:10,210
(It turns out to be the receipt
for his own credit card.)

1818
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:12,939
Oh, that's relieving.

1819
01:17:12,940 --> 01:17:14,240
(Refreshed)

1820
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:17,579
- I almost couldn't sleep tonight.
- I know.

1821
01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:19,380
(The mystery of the
receipt has been solved.)

1822
01:17:19,550 --> 01:17:21,980
You know you have to pay us?

1823
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:24,219
We received CEO Ko's approval.

1824
01:17:24,220 --> 01:17:25,450
Oh, right.

1825
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:27,619
It was a conversation...

1826
01:17:27,620 --> 01:17:30,260
between the CEOs.

1827
01:17:30,390 --> 01:17:31,519
You can just send it.

1828
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:34,060
(You can just send it.)

1829
01:17:34,130 --> 01:17:35,729
As far as I'm concerned,

1830
01:17:35,730 --> 01:17:39,070
- it's already been sent.
- Really?

1831
01:17:40,570 --> 01:17:41,899
What...

1832
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:43,100
(Exclaiming)

1833
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:45,669
- It's been received.
- CEO Ko plays hard.

1834
01:17:45,670 --> 01:17:46,846
(The additional expense
has been deposited.)

1835
01:17:46,870 --> 01:17:48,910
- Okay.
- Okay. Let's settle it.

1836
01:17:49,340 --> 01:17:52,109
You can send us what we
need to receive from there.

1837
01:17:52,110 --> 01:17:54,650
- That settles it for today.
- Okay.

1838
01:17:54,950 --> 01:17:56,620
First of all,

1839
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:59,889
the flight cost.

1840
01:17:59,890 --> 01:18:03,490
- You're left with 2,738.80 dollars.
- What?

1841
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:04,560
That much?

1842
01:18:04,561 --> 01:18:06,559
Yesterday's settlement is...

1843
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:08,466
(They haven't finished
paying for the flight yet.)

1844
01:18:08,490 --> 01:18:10,929
The cost of the tour yesterday.

1845
01:18:10,930 --> 01:18:14,269
One boat is 2,000 pesos.

1846
01:18:14,270 --> 01:18:17,370
Three of our production crew rode with you,

1847
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:20,110
so you can pay me 1,000 pesos.

1848
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:23,479
Parasailing today.

1849
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:25,849
It's 1,400 pesos per person.

1850
01:18:25,850 --> 01:18:27,649
It's 4,410 pesos in total.

1851
01:18:27,650 --> 01:18:28,996
(The cost of parasailing is 4,410
pesos, including 5 percent tax.)

1852
01:18:29,020 --> 01:18:30,619
If you add 1,000 pesos to it,

1853
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:33,150
the total comes to 5,410 pesos.

1854
01:18:33,820 --> 01:18:36,120
- I have a question.
- Okay.

1855
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:38,659
- What's the 1,000 pesos about?
- What?

1856
01:18:38,660 --> 01:18:40,859
- For the tour?
- It's for the tour.

1857
01:18:40,860 --> 01:18:41,929
And...

1858
01:18:41,930 --> 01:18:43,159
- is 4,200 pesos...
- For today.

1859
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:45,060
- For the tour today?
- For parasailing. Yes.

1860
01:18:45,130 --> 01:18:47,030
Will you show me the receipt?

1861
01:18:47,630 --> 01:18:49,269
It's the fight of the spear and the shield.

1862
01:18:49,270 --> 01:18:50,499
- Do we even have it?
- The spear and the shield.

1863
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:52,616
(The junior accountant
pressures the senior accountant.)

1864
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:53,809
I brought it.

1865
01:18:53,810 --> 01:18:54,840
(I brought the receipt.)

1866
01:18:55,210 --> 01:18:57,539
- Here it is.
- Why do you have it in the bag?

1867
01:18:57,540 --> 01:18:59,410
- This is crazy.
- That's for the 1,000 pesos.

1868
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:01,809
You asked for it?

1869
01:19:01,810 --> 01:19:03,879
It wasn't even there. Why did you...

1870
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:05,120
(He's not easy to deal with.)

1871
01:19:05,220 --> 01:19:07,590
This is the receipt.

1872
01:19:07,650 --> 01:19:09,890
That's the parasailing receipt.

1873
01:19:13,460 --> 01:19:15,699
I can see that you're an accountant.

1874
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:18,599
(He's a tough senior.)

1875
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:20,600
- Gosh, you're so...
- He's not easy to deal with.

1876
01:19:20,630 --> 01:19:22,470
- You're so tight.
- I agree.

1877
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,140
I've never seen such a firm shield before.

1878
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:26,440
He's not easy.

1879
01:19:27,470 --> 01:19:28,669
You need to pay me...

1880
01:19:28,670 --> 01:19:30,940
- after adding those two.
- Okay.

1881
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:33,680
Because you gathered all the receipts...

1882
01:19:33,780 --> 01:19:35,410
and got me a gift,

1883
01:19:36,220 --> 01:19:39,090
let's be neat and round it up.

1884
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:40,719
Round it up where?

1885
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:41,950
Two...

1886
01:19:42,260 --> 01:19:46,160
Let's make it 2,700
dollars and 400 dollars.

1887
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:51,060
Send me 3,100 dollars today and tomorrow.

1888
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:52,429
We'll settle it there.

1889
01:19:52,430 --> 01:19:53,899
You've become wild.

1890
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:56,870
(For your information, they
used to quarrel over 0.02 cents.)

1891
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,410
Because the limit is 2,000 dollars,

1892
01:20:00,810 --> 01:20:02,879
I'll send 2,000 dollars today.

1893
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:04,040
(Sending 2,000 dollars first)

1894
01:20:04,510 --> 01:20:06,850
Jun Wi, and...

1895
01:20:07,710 --> 01:20:10,780
- CEO Ko mentioned a get-together.
- I see.

1896
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:12,520
Have you heard?

1897
01:20:12,690 --> 01:20:14,989
- You haven't?
- I haven't heard that yet.

1898
01:20:14,990 --> 01:20:17,060
It was a conversation between the CEOs.

1899
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:20,489
- Do you want me to tell you?
- Sure.

1900
01:20:20,490 --> 01:20:22,160
- Or through CEO Ko...
- You can tell me.

1901
01:20:23,930 --> 01:20:25,530
It's the CEOs... Well...

1902
01:20:25,830 --> 01:20:28,170
It's our secret document. I can't show you.

1903
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:32,570
"Lastly, for the ill and
nosebleeding production crew,"

1904
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:35,510
"I'd appreciate it if you could
provide them a warm meal."

1905
01:20:35,980 --> 01:20:37,479
"For the expense you
need for a get-together,"

1906
01:20:37,480 --> 01:20:39,480
"you may discuss it with Jun Wi..."

1907
01:20:39,610 --> 01:20:42,820
"and proceed with it
under your consideration."

1908
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:46,289
You'll need to pay us for
tomorrow's accommodation and stuff.

1909
01:20:46,290 --> 01:20:48,120
- Pay that first.
- Okay.

1910
01:20:48,150 --> 01:20:50,359
Pay for dinner with what you have left,

1911
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:53,189
and if you run out,

1912
01:20:53,190 --> 01:20:54,529
the head office will provide it.

1913
01:20:54,530 --> 01:20:55,659
No.

1914
01:20:55,660 --> 01:20:59,100
Are you saying it's
included in 1,900 dollars?

1915
01:20:59,470 --> 01:21:00,669
- No.
- That's not it.

1916
01:21:00,670 --> 01:21:02,099
"For the expense you
need for a get-together,"

1917
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:03,499
"you may discuss it with Jun Wi..."

1918
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:05,670
"and proceed with it
under your consideration."

1919
01:21:05,740 --> 01:21:06,869
We're proceeding with it...

1920
01:21:06,870 --> 01:21:08,009
- under my consideration.
- Right.

1921
01:21:08,010 --> 01:21:11,610
My consideration is that the
head office pays the full amount.

1922
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:13,050
By CEO Ko.

1923
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:14,949
In the end, CEO Ko...

1924
01:21:14,950 --> 01:21:18,480
- We have to discuss it together.
- What?

1925
01:21:18,650 --> 01:21:20,489
We discuss it, but the
decision is up to me.

1926
01:21:20,490 --> 01:21:21,619
The decision is up to me.

1927
01:21:21,620 --> 01:21:24,159
"Proceed with it under your consideration."

1928
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:26,630
Before you decide it,
we have to discuss it.

1929
01:21:27,390 --> 01:21:28,930
Let's discuss it then.

1930
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:31,200
I'll make the decision. So try me.

1931
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:34,300
However we discuss
it, I'm going to decide it.

1932
01:21:35,270 --> 01:21:37,430
Even if we discuss it, I'm
going to make the decision.

1933
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:40,110
You've worked very hard.

1934
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:42,740
How much was the additional
expense? Was it 5,000 dollars?

1935
01:21:42,980 --> 01:21:44,860
- It was 3,500 dollars.
- It was 3,500 dollars.

1936
01:21:45,140 --> 01:21:47,349
Then you could...

1937
01:21:47,350 --> 01:21:50,880
spend about 500 dollars from there.

1938
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:53,290
That's what I think.

1939
01:21:53,390 --> 01:21:55,090
What are you talking about?

1940
01:21:55,620 --> 01:21:57,419
- Then about 200 dollars?
- Then...

1941
01:21:57,420 --> 01:21:59,019
Hold on.

1942
01:21:59,020 --> 01:22:00,460
Give us a minute.

1943
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:03,959
One second. We'll be right back.

1944
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:07,699
(All KKPP Foods employees are summoned.)

1945
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:09,899
What about this?

1946
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:12,469
Since we all worked hard,

1947
01:22:12,470 --> 01:22:13,839
we'll have a get-together.

1948
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:15,110
But tomorrow,

1949
01:22:15,370 --> 01:22:16,980
when we move to the island,

1950
01:22:17,180 --> 01:22:19,040
- we'll play a game.
- Okay.

1951
01:22:19,110 --> 01:22:20,379
And if we lose,

1952
01:22:20,380 --> 01:22:22,820
we pay for the get-together
with our own money.

1953
01:22:23,020 --> 01:22:24,120
If we win,

1954
01:22:24,220 --> 01:22:25,519
- They pay?
- eggiscoming pays...

1955
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:26,889
- Sounds good.
- for it 100 percent.

1956
01:22:26,890 --> 01:22:28,590
- That's a good idea.
- It's a good idea.

1957
01:22:29,590 --> 01:22:30,860
Jun Wi.

1958
01:22:31,060 --> 01:22:33,990
- I have a suggestion.
- Okay.

1959
01:22:34,130 --> 01:22:35,189
We're moving to...

1960
01:22:35,190 --> 01:22:36,310
- an island tomorrow.
- Yes.

1961
01:22:37,230 --> 01:22:39,200
Let's play a game.

1962
01:22:39,330 --> 01:22:41,199
If we lose,

1963
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:44,900
we'll pay for the get-together
with our own money.

1964
01:22:45,370 --> 01:22:46,970
- If we win, - Yes?

1965
01:22:47,670 --> 01:22:50,979
Eggiscoming will pay for it 100 percent.

1966
01:22:50,980 --> 01:22:53,450
Under the condition that you must play.

1967
01:22:54,250 --> 01:22:56,480
- Whatever it is, you must play.
- Right.

1968
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:58,550
We don't know what we're going to play yet.

1969
01:22:59,220 --> 01:23:00,249
That sounds great.

1970
01:23:00,250 --> 01:23:01,349
When we get there tomorrow.

1971
01:23:01,350 --> 01:23:02,560
Sure. Let's do that.

1972
01:23:03,260 --> 01:23:04,319
Is that all...

1973
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,680
- for the settlement today?
- Yes.

1974
01:23:05,790 --> 01:23:07,229
- Thank you.
- Isn't this...

1975
01:23:07,230 --> 01:23:08,789
the last settlement in a way?

1976
01:23:08,790 --> 01:23:10,299
Yes, you're right.

1977
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:12,129
Thank you for your work, you two.

1978
01:23:12,130 --> 01:23:13,176
(About 80 percent of the
settlement work is now completed.)

1979
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:14,330
Good work.

1980
01:23:14,700 --> 01:23:15,769
Good work.

1981
01:23:15,770 --> 01:23:17,370
Sir, give me a hug, will you?

1982
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,099
Yes.

1983
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:20,570
What a nice sight to see.

1984
01:23:22,140 --> 01:23:23,609
Good work.

1985
01:23:23,610 --> 01:23:26,450
(A warm hug between the accountants)

1986
01:23:26,510 --> 01:23:28,710
Let's give our senior
who worked hard a ride.

1987
01:23:28,780 --> 01:23:29,920
I...

1988
01:23:30,180 --> 01:23:31,319
Come here.

1989
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:32,590
Don't say no.

1990
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,190
Good work.

1991
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:39,690
I knew you'd be happy.

1992
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:45,130
(That ends today's settlement.)

1993
01:23:45,460 --> 01:23:47,529
Anyway, thank you, Woo Bin and Jun Wi,

1994
01:23:47,530 --> 01:23:48,599
- for settling...
- Sure.

1995
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:50,139
The expenses.

1996
01:23:50,140 --> 01:23:53,610
But there's one more task for you.

1997
01:23:54,610 --> 01:23:57,180
The person in charge is Jun
Wi. Can you step forward again?

1998
01:23:58,140 --> 01:23:59,750
How many jobs do you have?

1999
01:24:01,150 --> 01:24:02,880
(Jun Wi has two jobs.)

2000
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:05,350
(Shoving in pocket)

2001
01:24:05,450 --> 01:24:06,750
Is this okay?

2002
01:24:07,820 --> 01:24:09,190
This is okay, right?

2003
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:12,730
(It's snack time for the expedition team.)

2004
01:24:12,790 --> 01:24:15,230
These are egg whites with zero egg yolk.

2005
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:18,360
I actually don't eat egg yolks,

2006
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:21,429
because they're high in cholesterol.

2007
01:24:21,430 --> 01:24:23,110
Should we try these on the count of three?

2008
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:24,700
One, two, three.

2009
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,440
The flavor is so simple and clean.

2010
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:33,210
It's so convenient.

2011
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:41,320
(Eat egg whites equivalent
to two eggs, without the yolks.)

2012
01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:43,519
(Humming)

2013
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:46,830
(It's the long-awaited time for ramyeon.)

2014
01:24:46,860 --> 01:24:51,030
(Chef Doh is excited about
eating Korean ramyeon.)

2015
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:53,600
(Shaking out the seasoning packet)

2016
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:57,900
The water needs to be at a rolling boil.

2017
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:03,310
(He's so hungry that he puts in
the noodles before the water boils.)

2018
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:04,740
The flame is too weak.

2019
01:25:06,750 --> 01:25:11,019
(He begins cooking Jin
Ramyeon at the same time.)

2020
01:25:11,020 --> 01:25:15,450
(He's tidy enough to clean up right away.)

2021
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:19,330
The noodles are thin in
Jjapaghetti sold overseas.

2022
01:25:19,430 --> 01:25:20,560
- They are?
- Yes.

2023
01:25:21,290 --> 01:25:22,770
Thicker noodles taste better, though.

2024
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:25,499
(Cooling the noodles by blowing on them)

2025
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:28,700
(Kyung Soo checks on
how cooked the noodles are.)

2026
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:33,839
(Slurping up the noodles)

2027
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:37,179
(When the noodles are cooked enough, )

2028
01:25:37,180 --> 01:25:40,680
(he finishes the ramyeon
with a drizzle of olive oil.)

2029
01:25:43,220 --> 01:25:46,819
(The ultimate late-night snack:
Soupy ramyeon and jjajang ramyeon)

2030
01:25:46,820 --> 01:25:47,990
These look good.

2031
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:53,560
(They take a bite with high expectations.)

2032
01:25:54,890 --> 01:25:58,400
I think I added a bit too much water.

2033
01:25:59,670 --> 01:26:00,670
Okay.

2034
01:26:02,030 --> 01:26:03,369
- Doesn't it taste a bit different?
- It's different.

2035
01:26:03,370 --> 01:26:04,500
It does.

2036
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:06,309
- It's cool.
- The noodles are thinner.

2037
01:26:06,310 --> 01:26:07,440
The noodles are thinner too.

2038
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:11,760
It doesn't taste like the
Jjapaghetti we're familiar with.

2039
01:26:12,810 --> 01:26:15,650
(This jjajang ramyeon is...)

2040
01:26:15,750 --> 01:26:17,750
How is it different, though?
What did they change?

2041
01:26:18,020 --> 01:26:21,820
Apparently, they change
the flavors a little...

2042
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:23,760
when they export ramyeon.

2043
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:26,190
This is less sweet.

2044
01:26:26,790 --> 01:26:29,159
It's less sweet and less savory.

2045
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:31,930
I completely reduced it
but it's still not as savory.

2046
01:26:35,230 --> 01:26:36,640
It's good.

2047
01:26:39,570 --> 01:26:42,880
(They may taste kind of
different, but they're still ramyeon.)

2048
01:26:42,940 --> 01:26:47,350
(Woo Bin stops eating the
ramyeon and looks at his phone.)

2049
01:26:48,250 --> 01:26:49,350
I'm checking right now,

2050
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:54,089
and I don't think the 120
dollars were for the hats.

2051
01:26:54,090 --> 01:26:55,919
(The 120 dollar receipt
wasn't for the hats?)

2052
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:56,920
What?

2053
01:26:57,220 --> 01:26:58,260
It's because...

2054
01:26:59,430 --> 01:27:01,730
the card number on the
receipt is the company card.

2055
01:27:03,060 --> 01:27:04,629
(He said he paid with his own card.)

2056
01:27:04,630 --> 01:27:06,700
You said you paid with your card.

2057
01:27:07,530 --> 01:27:10,040
We must have done
something worth 120 dollars.

2058
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:13,709
I guess I didn't get the
receipt for the hats...

2059
01:27:13,710 --> 01:27:15,440
because I paid with my card.

2060
01:27:16,010 --> 01:27:17,340
There was no reason for it.

2061
01:27:18,710 --> 01:27:22,010
(If there's no receipt for the hats
because Woo Bin paid for them...)

2062
01:27:22,110 --> 01:27:24,920
How much is 890 pesos in Korean won?

2063
01:27:25,780 --> 01:27:26,789
It doesn't make sense.

2064
01:27:26,790 --> 01:27:29,350
We used 890 pesos for gas...

2065
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:31,059
and drove there right away.

2066
01:27:31,060 --> 01:27:32,689
(They drove straight
to the whale shark tour.)

2067
01:27:32,690 --> 01:27:34,090
That doesn't make sense.

2068
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:38,600
We paid 890 pesos at the gas station,

2069
01:27:39,260 --> 01:27:42,029
so why isn't there a record
for the 890-peso charge?

2070
01:27:42,030 --> 01:27:43,140
That's what I'm saying.

2071
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:45,639
We have the receipt for 890 pesos,

2072
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:48,510
but then 3 minutes later, 120 dollars...

2073
01:27:48,710 --> 01:27:50,540
- were charged.
- Wait, Kwang Soo!

2074
01:27:51,110 --> 01:27:53,550
(What?)

2075
01:27:53,650 --> 01:27:55,950
- What?
- We paid the 890 pesos in cash.

2076
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:59,520
(The video isn't paused.)

2077
01:27:59,620 --> 01:28:00,689
You're right.

2078
01:28:00,690 --> 01:28:03,359
- I only had a 1,000 peso bill.
- That's right.

2079
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:04,519
- Right?
- That's right.

2080
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:06,359
(They paid cash at the gas
station, so it wasn't charged.)

2081
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:07,520
Then what's that receipt for?

2082
01:28:07,690 --> 01:28:09,859
What is this? What could this be for?

2083
01:28:09,860 --> 01:28:11,229
(What is this 120 dollar receipt?
(What could this have been for?)

2084
01:28:11,230 --> 01:28:12,559
- I'm really not sure.
- It would make...

2085
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:14,240
better sense if we were missing a receipt,

2086
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:15,529
but we do have a receipt.

2087
01:28:15,530 --> 01:28:17,999
- Right. Where is it from?
- We just happened to...

2088
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,770
be at the gas station three minutes
before the time on the receipt.

2089
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:23,156
(What did the expedition team
do in the span of 3 minutes?)

2090
01:28:23,180 --> 01:28:24,580
Did you throw away the receipt?

2091
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:26,080
I did.

2092
01:28:27,110 --> 01:28:29,580
No one can go to bed
until we figure this out.

2093
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:32,520
(The expedition team
is stuck in this mystery.)

2094
01:28:32,580 --> 01:28:35,720
(Rummaging around)

2095
01:28:35,750 --> 01:28:38,720
(Woo Bin digs through the waste bin.)

2096
01:28:39,090 --> 01:28:40,760
I can't believe we don't remember.

2097
01:28:42,090 --> 01:28:43,099
(The 120-dollar charge remains a mystery.)

2098
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:44,360
It doesn't make sense.

2099
01:28:44,830 --> 01:28:46,060
It really doesn't.

2100
01:28:47,100 --> 01:28:51,340
(They seem to be giving up.)

2101
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:54,440
What was the time on
the receipt? Was it 17?

2102
01:28:54,570 --> 01:28:55,570
Or was it 18?

2103
01:28:56,280 --> 01:28:57,779
There was a 3-minute difference.

2104
01:28:57,780 --> 01:28:58,909
(The team is back to figuring
out the 120-dollar charge.)

2105
01:28:58,910 --> 01:29:00,080
Where is this?

2106
01:29:00,550 --> 01:29:01,580
What?

2107
01:29:01,710 --> 01:29:03,580
Let me look it up.

2108
01:29:04,150 --> 01:29:05,919
Isn't this the place we...

2109
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:08,149
(They try to look up what's
written on the receipt.)

2110
01:29:08,150 --> 01:29:09,919
"T, U, R, E, S."

2111
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:11,019
(Knocking)

2112
01:29:11,020 --> 01:29:12,119
"D, L, S."

2113
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:13,859
- "D, L, S?" - Yes.

2114
01:29:13,860 --> 01:29:15,230
Did someone just knock?

2115
01:29:15,690 --> 01:29:16,730
I think so.

2116
01:29:17,130 --> 01:29:18,799
This is...

2117
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:22,270
(Someone is visiting the
expedition team late at night.)

2118
01:29:22,430 --> 01:29:23,500
Coming.

2119
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:28,939
(Kyung Soo goes to check.)

2120
01:29:28,940 --> 01:29:31,210
(Opening the front door)

2121
01:29:34,610 --> 01:29:37,020
(Kyung Soo runs to Woo
Bin and Kwang Soo's room.)

2122
01:29:38,380 --> 01:29:40,920
- What?
- There's no one there.

2123
01:29:41,450 --> 01:29:42,750
Someone knocked, right?

2124
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:44,990
There's no one there.

2125
01:29:46,830 --> 01:29:48,659
(Screaming)

2126
01:29:48,660 --> 01:29:49,700
What?

2127
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:51,929
My legs sting.

2128
01:29:51,930 --> 01:29:53,770
(Someone must have gotten the wrong room.)

2129
01:29:53,830 --> 01:29:54,830
Wait.

2130
01:29:54,831 --> 01:29:56,711
(They get back to
checking the search results.)

2131
01:29:56,740 --> 01:29:58,869
Wait. A major tour operator...

2132
01:29:58,870 --> 01:30:00,909
active in Isla Mujeres...

2133
01:30:00,910 --> 01:30:03,839
and Isla Contoy...

2134
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:05,940
near Cancun, Mexico.

2135
01:30:06,510 --> 01:30:08,280
- Tour?
- Tour operator.

2136
01:30:08,710 --> 01:30:09,850
The whale shark tour.

2137
01:30:10,150 --> 01:30:11,220
Gosh.

2138
01:30:11,850 --> 01:30:14,249
- Gosh, this is it.
- What is it?

2139
01:30:14,250 --> 01:30:17,689
The mandatory federal dock
fee is 20 dollars per person.

2140
01:30:17,690 --> 01:30:18,690
The dock fee.

2141
01:30:18,691 --> 01:30:20,289
- The mandatory national park fee...
- What's a dock fee?

2142
01:30:20,290 --> 01:30:22,160
Is 20 dollars per person.

2143
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:25,699
- Basically, the venue fee.
- The fees for national parks...

2144
01:30:25,700 --> 01:30:29,000
collected by the government
are 40 dollars per person.

2145
01:30:29,130 --> 01:30:30,939
That's 120 dollars.

2146
01:30:30,940 --> 01:30:33,070
Right. Four times three is twelve.

2147
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:34,600
We should tell the staff tomorrow.

2148
01:30:34,910 --> 01:30:36,810
I threw away the receipt.

2149
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:39,240
Gosh.

2150
01:30:40,410 --> 01:30:43,050
(Laughing)

2151
01:30:43,420 --> 01:30:45,220
(Laughing)

2152
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:47,520
The receipt.

2153
01:30:49,620 --> 01:30:51,389
At least we figured it out.

2154
01:30:51,390 --> 01:30:52,859
- Right.
- I feel much better now.

2155
01:30:52,860 --> 01:30:54,329
- Yes.
- We can finally go to sleep.

2156
01:30:54,330 --> 01:30:55,606
(The expedition team is finally at ease.)

2157
01:30:55,630 --> 01:30:57,960
Why was the time wrong on the receipt?

2158
01:30:58,460 --> 01:30:59,529
You're right.

2159
01:30:59,530 --> 01:31:00,629
The time doesn't make sense.

2160
01:31:00,630 --> 01:31:03,699
We arrived at Cancun at 7:20am.

2161
01:31:03,700 --> 01:31:05,800
- Right.
- It doesn't make sense.

2162
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:08,139
The time is recorded
an hour later. No, earlier.

2163
01:31:08,140 --> 01:31:10,010
Something must be
wrong with the card reader.

2164
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:11,280
- Wait!
- Gosh.

2165
01:31:11,980 --> 01:31:13,480
There's a time difference.

2166
01:31:13,980 --> 01:31:15,080
- Right!
- Right!

2167
01:31:15,910 --> 01:31:19,150
Cancun is an hour early.

2168
01:31:20,550 --> 01:31:21,649
(The entire 120-dollar receipt
mystery has been solved.)

2169
01:31:21,650 --> 01:31:23,760
(Clapping)

2170
01:31:23,820 --> 01:31:27,190
(Laughing)

2171
01:31:27,690 --> 01:31:28,959
That's right.

2172
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:33,129
It was exactly 7:18am.

2173
01:31:33,130 --> 01:31:35,400
(Woo Bin finds this situation funny.)

2174
01:31:35,570 --> 01:31:36,840
We were completely fooled.

2175
01:31:37,670 --> 01:31:39,200
What do you mean?

2176
01:31:40,510 --> 01:31:42,809
Nobody fooled us in the first place.

2177
01:31:42,810 --> 01:31:45,140
(The expedition team fooled themselves.)

2178
01:31:45,310 --> 01:31:46,910
Nobody fooled us...

2179
01:31:47,650 --> 01:31:48,750
in the first place. Yes.

2180
01:31:49,180 --> 01:31:52,080
The billing was correct.

2181
01:31:52,950 --> 01:31:54,190
I kept thinking,

2182
01:31:55,850 --> 01:31:58,319
"How did we suddenly pay 120 dollars..."

2183
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:00,789
"just three minutes after
putting gas in the car?"

2184
01:32:00,790 --> 01:32:03,230
Right. It's so scary.

2185
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:06,830
Jun Wi would let it slide, right?

2186
01:32:07,430 --> 01:32:08,600
He usually doesn't.

2187
01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:11,800
He never lets something like this slide.

2188
01:32:11,870 --> 01:32:15,469
(Woo Bin has the senior
accountant perfectly figured out.)

2189
01:32:15,470 --> 01:32:17,540
- I'm serious.
- You know him so well now.

2190
01:32:19,010 --> 01:32:22,950
It seemed like our gift strategy...

2191
01:32:23,250 --> 01:32:24,879
- kind of worked earlier.
- Right.

2192
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:26,590
- Didn't he seem surprised?
- Right.

2193
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:28,550
We even bought something for his wife.

2194
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:33,280
- I'm going to bed now.
- Let's go to sleep.

2195
01:32:33,630 --> 01:32:36,429
- Goodnight.
- I just came by for your socks.

2196
01:32:36,430 --> 01:32:37,499
(After chatting for a long
time, Kyung Soo leaves.)

2197
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:39,429
I put them here. Goodnight.

2198
01:32:39,430 --> 01:32:41,200
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

2199
01:32:45,070 --> 01:32:48,409
(There is no time difference between
Playa del Carmen and Cancun.)

2200
01:32:48,410 --> 01:32:51,940
(It was a card reader error.)

2201
01:32:53,150 --> 01:32:57,220
(GBRB: Joy Pops Laugh Pops)

2202
01:32:58,020 --> 01:33:01,350
(Morning of Day 7 of the expedition)

2203
01:33:02,220 --> 01:33:06,190
(A rainy, overcast morning)

2204
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:09,759
(They're supposed to go to Cozumel today.)

2205
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:11,460
It's raining more than we expected.

2206
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:14,399
We won't be able to ride scooters.

2207
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:16,800
- We wanted to ride scooters.
- We planned to ride scooters.

2208
01:33:17,270 --> 01:33:18,600
There's a rental place there.

2209
01:33:19,070 --> 01:33:20,669
I hope the weather's nice on the island.

2210
01:33:20,670 --> 01:33:22,039
The weather might be better there.

2211
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:23,240
(Filled with concern, )

2212
01:33:24,780 --> 01:33:28,710
(they prepare to set out.)

2213
01:33:30,550 --> 01:33:33,850
(Auditor Kim, the team's
strongest member, loads their bags.)

2214
01:33:35,420 --> 01:33:37,819
Are you done with this apple, Woo Bin?

2215
01:33:37,820 --> 01:33:39,159
No, I brought it so I could eat it.

2216
01:33:39,160 --> 01:33:41,029
- This is really good.
- Is it?

2217
01:33:41,030 --> 01:33:42,959
I'll try it. Let's share that one.

2218
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:44,900
- I ate one already.
- Take another bite.

2219
01:33:45,460 --> 01:33:46,600
You can have some more.

2220
01:33:47,130 --> 01:33:49,670
(Well, then...)

2221
01:33:51,470 --> 01:33:53,340
How does this apple taste so good?

2222
01:33:53,570 --> 01:33:56,170
(Is it that good?)

2223
01:33:56,540 --> 01:33:57,780
It's really sweet.

2224
01:33:57,810 --> 01:33:58,839
(Crunch)

2225
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:00,650
Why are my legs so stiff?

2226
01:34:00,910 --> 01:34:01,910
I had one.

2227
01:34:01,911 --> 01:34:05,220
(They boost their energy
with a morning apple.)

2228
01:34:05,620 --> 01:34:08,690
- I'll send you the address.
- Okay.

2229
01:34:09,050 --> 01:34:10,290
It's very close. Gosh.

2230
01:34:11,690 --> 01:34:13,019
What is it?

2231
01:34:13,020 --> 01:34:14,390
- Kwang Soo.
- Is it closed?

2232
01:34:14,460 --> 01:34:15,490
Yes.

2233
01:34:15,530 --> 01:34:17,999
- Why?
- It's closed Mondays.

2234
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,736
(The pozole place they
planned on going to is closed.)

2235
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:21,846
(This is their second failed
attempt at trying pozole.)

2236
01:34:21,870 --> 01:34:23,399
- Gosh.
- What should we do?

2237
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:25,000
Can you hold this for me?

2238
01:34:26,540 --> 01:34:29,010
(Kyung Soo immediately looks
up other restaurant options.)

2239
01:34:30,140 --> 01:34:31,610
The restaurant is closed.

2240
01:34:31,810 --> 01:34:33,086
The pozole restaurant is closed.

2241
01:34:33,110 --> 01:34:34,609
It's closed on Mondays.

2242
01:34:34,610 --> 01:34:35,680
What?

2243
01:34:37,020 --> 01:34:39,120
We ate here. The food was good.

2244
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:41,089
What kind of food do they serve?

2245
01:34:41,090 --> 01:34:43,389
This and that. It's a brunch spot.

2246
01:34:43,390 --> 01:34:45,096
(The production staff
recommends them a brunch spot.)

2247
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:46,559
We ate here for breakfast,

2248
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:47,829
- and the food was great.
- We enjoyed it.

2249
01:34:47,830 --> 01:34:49,129
- Can we eat here?
- Sure.

2250
01:34:49,130 --> 01:34:50,610
- The pozole place is closed.
- Okay.

2251
01:34:50,660 --> 01:34:51,729
- We don't mind.
- Okay.

2252
01:34:51,730 --> 01:34:53,299
We'll eat here, then.

2253
01:34:53,300 --> 01:34:54,980
(The culinary director gave his approval.)

2254
01:34:55,300 --> 01:34:58,669
(They're eating at the brunch spot
across the street from their room.)

2255
01:34:58,670 --> 01:34:59,839
There's a pool...

2256
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:01,039
and a gym here.

2257
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:02,369
- We didn't visit any of them.
- We didn't visit any of them.

2258
01:35:02,370 --> 01:35:03,880
We just slept.

2259
01:35:04,740 --> 01:35:06,380
Too bad it's raining.

2260
01:35:07,510 --> 01:35:09,919
Things probably won't...

2261
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:11,680
go as we planned.

2262
01:35:11,780 --> 01:35:13,790
(It's still raining heavily.)

2263
01:35:13,850 --> 01:35:15,620
If it's raining too much...

2264
01:35:15,750 --> 01:35:18,120
when we get there, we
won't ride the scooters.

2265
01:35:18,660 --> 01:35:21,059
That's the reason why...

2266
01:35:21,060 --> 01:35:22,820
- we're gong to the island, though.
- Right.

2267
01:35:23,030 --> 01:35:25,460
I thought we'd finally get to unwind.

2268
01:35:26,630 --> 01:35:31,100
(Will the expedition team's
island vacation work out?)

2269
01:35:31,870 --> 01:35:34,070
(The final expedition site of
the KKPP expedition team)

2270
01:35:34,370 --> 01:35:36,840
(The grand finale will be at...)

2271
01:35:37,340 --> 01:35:39,580
(Cozumel, the crown jewel
of the Yucatan Peninsula.)

2272
01:35:40,180 --> 01:35:41,550
This is fun.

2273
01:35:42,110 --> 01:35:44,520
(This time, they'll be
exploring freely on scooters.)

2274
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:48,020
(The team race along the
Caribbean shores and have fun.)

2275
01:35:48,450 --> 01:35:50,659
(As they were speeding along...)

2276
01:35:50,660 --> 01:35:51,790
It's raining.

2277
01:35:51,990 --> 01:35:53,660
Gosh, it's raining.

2278
01:35:54,130 --> 01:35:55,729
(Cold raindrops land on their faces.)

2279
01:35:55,730 --> 01:35:57,300
(Laughing)

2280
01:35:57,530 --> 01:35:58,860
I think...

2281
01:35:59,530 --> 01:36:01,000
we're at the wrong place.

2282
01:36:01,930 --> 01:36:05,100
(GPS Doh made a mistake
and led them to the wrong place.)

2283
01:36:05,240 --> 01:36:06,709
(They have a long way to go.)

2284
01:36:06,710 --> 01:36:07,769
(Hissing)

2285
01:36:07,770 --> 01:36:09,240

01:36:11,110 --> 01:36:12,179

01:36:40,070 --> 01:36:43,310
(At the end of an intense game, )

2300
01:36:43,680 --> 01:36:46,240
