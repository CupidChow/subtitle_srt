(KKPP International Expedition)

7
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,320
It's tasty.

8
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,620
- It's tasty, but...
- It's tasty.

9
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:34,929
(On the first day, the expedition failed to find a restaurant...)

10
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:36,330
(that suited their taste.)

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,429
I'll find a taco that tastes unbelievably good.

12
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:39,700
(Hungry for good restaurants, Director became determined.)

13
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,229
(As a result)

14
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:42,770
- I think it's really good.
- Same here.

15
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,070
(They began the 2nd day with a successful breakfast.)

16
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,839
(Encouraged by success,)

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,970
(Director recommended going on another taco expedition today.)

18
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,480
Can we really eat tacos again?

19
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,149
(Director's obsession with tacos continued on.)

20
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,310
(Determined)

21
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,379
(Meanwhile, the head office offered to pay for their shopping trip.)

22
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,350
(The expedition team picked a wrestling T-shirt.)

23
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,489
(The low-pitched negotiation melted the owner's heart.)

24
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,390
Please give it to us for 150 pesos each.

25
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,189

Your signature, please.

30
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,540
I'll go inside and look.

31
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,769
Excuse me.

32
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:22,610
(They begin to pick the team uniform in earnest.)

33
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:27,580
(His ears prick up.)

34
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:31,980
That's the song, right?

35
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,750
I performed this song once.

36
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,190
"Sabor a Mi."

37
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,619
It's a national song...

38
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,860
in South America.

39
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,229
- Do you memorize the lyrics?
- Yes.

40
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:43,690
- I performed it on stage.
- Really?

41
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:50,269
(Spanish lyrics come out as if someone had turned on a tape.)

42
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,399
Gosh, look at you.

43
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,140
Let's take him somewhere and make money.

44
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,069
- I should buy that instrument.
- How about a concert?

45
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,510
I'll shake it right next to you.

46
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,680
The song went like that.

47
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,010
I sang it on stage...

48
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,180
in my debut days.

49
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,180
I want to buy that one.

50
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,719
- Rey Mysterio?
- Yes.

51
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,949
Rey Mysterio. Huracan Ramirez.

52
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,749
(They're the mask designs of actual wrestlers.)

53
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,789
Blue Demon.

54
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,560
- Mysterio. Yes.
- Do you want to see Mysterio?

55
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,460
I like Mysterio.

56
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:16,889
Rey Mysterio?

57
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,559
Sorry. I only have blue Mysterio.

58
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,000
Oh, my gosh.

59
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,600
- Is it sold out?
- Yes.

60
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,299
Okay.

61
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,140
(At that moment)

62
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,309
It's X-Large.

63
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,740
Oh, my gosh.

64
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,980
(He meets Mysterio in X-Large size in a dramatic manner.)

65
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,049
- Medium.
- Kwang Soo chose Mysterio.

66
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,150
Rey Mysterio.

67
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,480
It matches your hat.

68
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,719
I really want to see myself in the mirror.

69
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,790
Please.

70
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,319
You have to wear all of it. Yes.

71
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,790
- Can I try it on?
- Yes.

72
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,190
I told you so. Now, you'll feel the power.

73
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,590
Feel the power?

74
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,130
(It definitely is an appearance that exudes power.)

75
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,569
(Roaring)

76
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,269
(He has transformed into Mysterio.)

77
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,569
Now, you feel the power.

78
00:02:58,570 --> 00:02:59,700
Is he asking me to buy it?

79
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,169
Is it a gift?

80
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,409
Of course, it isn't a gift.

81
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:03,570
You have the power.

82
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,010
Is he just making fun of me?

83
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,339
- Isn't it a freebie?
- No.

84
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,180
- A freebie, my foot.
- I'll get this one.

85
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:10,879
Good.

86
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,949
The masks are cool too.

87
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:12,980
Which one should I get?

88
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,789
This one.

89
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,620
(Mil Mascaras)

90
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:17,890
I chose that one too.

91
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,290
Then I'll choose this one.

92
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,490
Did you see the fights in Mexico?

93
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,790
- Yes.
- Really?

94
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,230
Yesterday.

95
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,429
- Okay. Yes.
- Yes.

96
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,199
(He shows a photo.)

97
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,429
He's bragging about the match he has watched.

98
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,939
- Atlantis.
- Atlantis.

99
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,370
It was fantastic. Yes.

100
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,740
It's a good show.

101
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,539
(Nacho Libre appears.)

102
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,639
Did you put it on?

103
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,850
It looks cute.

104
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,779
It's pretty. Seriously.

105
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,980
- Really?
- Yes.

106
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,880
- The back.
- The back is the key point.

107
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,990
- The lace-up back closure.
- Yes.

108
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:53,190
(The strong Mil Mascaras appears.)

109
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,490
You seem like this wrestler.

110
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,430
It feels like you're hiding your identity.

111
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,270
(After changing, they resume exploring the market.)

112
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,040
My goodness.

113
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:06,939
This is cute.

114
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,710
Kwang Soo, why are you obsessed with wrestling?

115
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,010
I'm beginning to like wrestling more and more.

116
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,149
This is...

117
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,479
(They need a hat to complete the look.)

118
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,980
Kyung Soo, try this on.

119
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,990
It covers your face too much.

120
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,589
- It looks good on you, but...
- Kyung Soo, let me see.

121
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,119
- It looks cool.
- It looks cool.

122
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,320
But it covers his face too much.

123
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,359
It looks like Woo Bin's hat.

124
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,190
It matches your style the most.

125
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:33,599
Gosh, you startled me. It's no joke.

126
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,330
He looks like someone who grew up in that hat.

127
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:38,140
But it blocks my view too much.

128
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,269
- I see.
- I need to give up on one eye.

129
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,670
(The Mexican hermit crab)

130
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,940
If someone calls me from this side, I need to look like this.

131
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,049
(While the older members pick the hat)

132
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,580
Such hats look good on him.

133
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,579
(His eyelids come down.)

134
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,150
(Kyung Soo struggles with jetlag.)

135
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,450
Kyung Soo, try it on.

136
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,020
What?

137
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,820
Hey, wake up.

138
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,730
Okay? Go and wash your face.

139
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:05,559
(I'll teach you a lesson.)

140
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,800
(He's worried about his jetlagged junior.)

141
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,999
(He tries on a hat as Kwang Soo asks.)

142
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,340
- Let me see.
- It looks good on you too.

143
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,970
(Kyung Soo's expression is dazed.)

144
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,870
You want to put on that hat and fall asleep, right?

145
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,150
(Why is your condition different from the restaurant?)

146
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,120
I think I'm becoming sleepy because there's no stimulus.

147
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,550
I don't come to a place like this when I'm on a trip.

148
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:34,430
(Director isn't interested in anything other than food.)

149
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,590
I'll have a talk with him. I think...

150
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,530
he needs an intervention.

151
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,800
A bit of a beating.

152
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,870
Gosh, this is...

153
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,400
Mexico. This is cool.

154
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,610
It looks cool. I'm serious. Just look in the mirror.

155
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,409
- It's cute.
- I think this one is nice.

156
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:56,480
The color is pretty.

157
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:58,480
Excuse me.

158
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,979
How much is it?

159
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,889
- Two hundred pesos.
- Two hundred pesos?

160
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:04,090
- Two hundred pesos?
- Yes.

161
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,819
- My goodness.
- Please give us a discount.

162
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,190
(He says the negotiating comment right away.)

163
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:09,860
- Too expensive.
- My goodness.

164
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,500
Cash?

165
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,830
Yes.

166
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,829
(170 pesos)

167
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,900
- Cash.
- No.

168
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,940
My friend, please.

169
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,900
Please make it 150 pesos.

170
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,640
No. I can't.

171
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,439
- Okay. Deal.
- Okay?

172
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,580
It's 170 pesos.

173
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,309
(He pays in cash.)

174
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,310
Thank you.

175
00:06:29,311 --> 00:06:32,750
(Why isn't he taking the receipt?)

176
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,990
(Auditor has always been perfect.)

177
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:41,430
(Why didn't he take the receipt?)

178
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,500
(They have finally completed their Mexican outfits.)

179
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,030
(Incredibly fancy)

180
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,870
(Two wrestlers...)

181
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,339
(and one mariachi member)

182
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,110
One, two, three.

183
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,309
- They look so serious.
- One, two, three.

184
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,580
(The group looks serious.)

185
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,679
(They look as serious as wrestlers in their profile photos.)

186
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,820
One, two, three.

187
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,659
(CEO Something Mysterio, Taco Libre, Receipt Mascaras)

188
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,720
Good.

189
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,760
I'll take another one.

190
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,590
One, two, three.

191
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,860
(Time to reorganize)

192
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,469
Jun Wi.

193
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,970
For the item I bought in cash,

194
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,810
I can fill out the form as you've instructed, right?

195
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,310
Is there no receipt?

196
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:30,770
No.

197
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,879
- But...
- Why is there no receipt?

198
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,680
They don't give receipts at a place like this.

199
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:36,580
- No receipt at all...
- It looks like...

200
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,920
Auditor Kim is confused about something.

201
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,719
The receipt we've made...

202
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,450
needs to be filled out by the seller.

203
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,259
- Really?
- Yes.

204
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,290
I'm not the one who fills it out?

205
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,730
(So far, he has filled out the cash receipt on his own.)

206
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,660
If you fill it out,

207
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,360
you can write down any numbers.

208
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,670
That's no way to talk.

210
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,940
He thinks we're...

211
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,099
Right now, we're...

212
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,870
The person who receives the money should fill out the receipt.

213
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,939
We need to ask the seller to fill it out.

214
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,339
That's right. We need to do that.

215
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:10,249
That's why the receipt is in Spanish.

216
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,520
(Spanish receipt was provided for the store employees.)

217
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,380
I thought I could fill it out.

218
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,619
- I hadn't done this before.
- That was my understanding as well.

219
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,750
- Right?
- Same here.

220
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,520
You should've explained that from the start.

221
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:23,329
If you replay the video, you'll see that I have.

222
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:24,359
(He complains to Jun Wi because he's upset.)

223
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,330
(Was there a misunderstanding?)

224
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,629
Usually, you get the receipt from the store.

225
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,970
You don't fill it out yourself.

226
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,800
I haven't explained that,

227
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,140
so I feel bad about it.

228
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,640
But it's customary to receive the receipt...

229
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,940
from the person who got paid,

230
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,149
in my opinion.

231
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,650
(The senior accountant timidly speaks his mind.)

232
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,620
Here.

233
00:08:46,621 --> 00:08:48,590
(Meanwhile, Kwang Soo and Kyung Soo pick their friendship bracelets.)

234
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:49,920
Shall we go with this one?

235
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,659
I think it's cute.

236
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,690
(While they pick bracelets, the auditor...)

237
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,930
I'll look it up in advance.

238
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,860
"Would you fill out the receipt?"

239
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,800
(The good student in accounting fixes his mistake right away.)

240
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,569
I think it'll suit Woo Bin.

241
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,299
- I knew it.
- It looks nice.

242
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,669
It's cute, right?

243
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,640
(Looking up the receipt-related expressions)

244
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,040
(The translator is speaking.)

245
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,749
I'll need to show it.

246
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,510
- That's...
- It's too long.

247
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:19,719
(The translator is speaking.)

248
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,850
"Por favor..."

249
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,920
Can we go inside?

250
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,190
- Can we go this way?
- We need to go to the back.

251
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,660
I can go this way.

252
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,490
Excuse me.

253
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,829
Would you please fill out the receipt?

This is new.

(Auditor tenses up due to the first cash receipt.)

259
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,640

(Current time: 3pm)

261
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,080
It's like...

262
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,879
- You're dazed, right?
- Yes.

263
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,690
I feel like I'm in a dream.

264
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,249
(Did you recently have a dream about Kwang Soo?)

265
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,960
I don't usually dream.

266
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,830
Suddenly, on a plane,

267
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,930
Kwang Soo received a hair transplant.

268
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:05,860
Then he died due to an infection.

269
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,999
I got a hair transplant on a plane.

270
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,800
But the dream was so realistic...

271
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,870
that I cried a lot.

272
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,670
So as soon as I woke up,

273
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:17,539
I went, "It was a dream."

274
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,910
I called Kwang Soo right away.

275
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,749
"Hello. Kwang Soo."

276
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,979
I died while receiving a hair transplant on a plane.

277
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,280
How is that dream so realistic?

278
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,719
- I was really sad, okay?
- It makes no sense whatsoever.

279
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,260
You can be sad...

280
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,519
in your dream.

281
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,130
I looked up the meaning of the dream right away.

282
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,000
If...

283
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,470
you don't cry in the dream,

284
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,230
something bad happens to that person.

285
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,500
If you cry in the dream, a cause for celebration occurs.

286
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,640
I got that when I looked up the meaning.

287
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,040
If you hadn't cried, it would've been a bad dream.

288
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,150
- Really?
- Yes.

289
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:56,950
Thank goodness.

290
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,249
And there was a cause for celebration.

291
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,750
That's right. He won an award.

293

Congratulations.

- Did you get the receipt?
- Yes, I did.

295

We bought the bracelets that suit us.

296
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,730
- Shall we go?
- Okay.

297
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,369

00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:04,970
The cars are going slowly because of Kwang Soo.

362
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,439
People are...

363
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,640
(Good boy.)

364
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:10,769
- It says, "Love churros." - Hi.

365
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:11,840
(Even with the churro store worker)

366
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:17,579
(Even with the cars waiting at the traffic lights)

367
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,849
You can feel the cold breeze from here.

368
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:19,950
(CEO Lee is busy greeting everyone.)

369
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,150
For real.

370
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,190
(When Sombrero Boy waves,)

371
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,959
(people wave back even while working.)

372
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,229
(Honking)

373
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,230
It's huge.

374
00:14:30,231 --> 00:14:31,290
(Even greeting the honking car)

375
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:34,159
(Bye)

376
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,869
Kwang Soo is hilarious.

377
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,729
(CEO Lee's greeting parade is endless.)

378
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:38,799
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes?

379
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,569
Literally everyone is greeting you.

380
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:41,610
- Right?
- Yes.

381
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,340
All of the city is welcoming you.

382
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:48,880
Even the people who are busy on the garbage trucks.

383
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,919
(The locals greet him warmly.)

384
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,750
(How does it feel to be popular in Mexico?)

385
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,220
Right now, everyone in Mexico and I...

386
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,759
are one.

387
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,259
(We're one.)

388
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,700
When I saw the one who honked with a frown...

389
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,100
greet me...

390
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:10,699
when our eyes met,

391
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,869
I...

392
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,599
became Mexican.

393
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,470
(I became a real Mexican.)

394
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:18,679
I can already kind of smell it.

395
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,109
(They're almost at the tripe taco place.)

396
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,210
Is this the place?

397
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,850
It's called El Torito.

398
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,320
We're here.

399
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,490
This is the place.

400
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,390
- Hold on.
- Hi.

401
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:35,430
This is El Torito, guys.

402
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,760
- It has a good vibe.
- Yes.

403
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,229
The place is crowded.

404
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,260
(Giving off an old store vibe)

405
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:42,800
You're right.

406
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,440
We are three.

407
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,369
We've got tripe, beef,

408
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:48,969
or mixed.

409
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,270
I guess we have to choose.

410
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,539
Just a moment.

411
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,110
(Just a moment.)

412
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:57,509
- Let me translate it.
- Okay.

413
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,479
I'm going to get a tripe taco.

414
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,819
(Kyung Soo wants a tripe taco.)

415
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,689
- It doesn't smell all that bad.
- Right?

416
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:03,790
I want that too.

417
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,720
- Tripe.
- Tripe?

418
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,089
Let me look at the menu.

419
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,389
It smells amazing.

420
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,390
I know, right?

421
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,399
Good.

422
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,460
Tripe.

423
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,130
Best menu?

424
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:17,970
(I see.)

425
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,270
What is it?

426
00:16:24,271 --> 00:16:25,510
The tripe is huge.

427
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,309
(The tripe that's almost being fried is mouth-watering.)

428
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:31,610
The translation is so funny.

429
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,780
Tripe...

430
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,420
is translated as the Trinity.

431
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:40,089
There's also a meat called smoothing...

432
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,390
- and a country person.
- A country person.

433
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:43,359
Here are the options.

434
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,429
Smoothing or Country Person?

435
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:45,900
Which would you like?

436
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,529
I'd like Smoothing.

437
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:49,870
- Are these all tripe?
- Yours is Trinity.

438
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,300
What's Trinity?

439
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,169
- I think it's tripe.
- Tripe.

440
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,240
Tripe.

441
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,340
Shall I also try the tripe one?

442
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,539
- Try it.
- Or...

443
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,779
since we're ordering two...

444
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,879
But the tripe taco is the best.

445
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,049
You can have a bite.

446
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:05,080
Okay. Then I'll have...

447
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,620
Smoothing.

448
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,789
- What is that?
- I don't know.

449
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,319
(Kwang Soo and Kyung Soo chose tripe,)

450
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,860
(while Woo Bin chose beef tacos.)

451
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,890
What was "excuse me" in Spanish?

452
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:18,160
Me...

453
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:19,830
Excuse me.

454
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,660
Two tripe tacos.

455
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:26,699
Two...

456
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,169
- tripe tacos.
- Tripe tacos.

457
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,409
- One...
- One.

458
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:31,469
beef taco.

459
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:32,640
Beef? Okay.

460
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:35,250
Would you like onions and cilantro? Everything?

461
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,150
Yes, everything.

462
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,119
- The topping?
- Yes.

463
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,719
Salsa and things, right?

464
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,819
Salsa is self-serve.

465
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,160
- Okay. Good.
- Got it.

466
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,920
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

467
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,660
Shall we wait outside?

468
00:17:48,661 --> 00:17:50,090
Yes, let's sit here.

469
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:53,459
(Seated)

470
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,469
I thought he was the audio director.

471
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:56,499
Welcome.

472
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,070
Thank you.

473
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,299
How about a selfie together?

474
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,310
Okay.

475
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,779
(While the expedition team is taking photos,)

476
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,850
(the delicious tacos are being made in the kitchen.)

477
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:18,859
- Beef?
- Right.

478
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,519
(The tacos are here.)

479
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,520
- Beef.
- Beef.

480
00:18:21,521 --> 00:18:22,529
- Tripe?
- Tripe.

481
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,030
- Tripe.
- Tripe.

482
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,600
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

483
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,629
We need some salsa.

484
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,169
The size is great.

485
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:32,039
The sauce... Thank you.

486
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,440
It smells great.

487
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,670
(Smelling)

488
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,140
It's hot.

489
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,210
Let me smell it.

490
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,079
It smells really good.

491
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,919
The tripe has been cut into pieces.

492
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,490
This is just beef.

493
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,220
It looks delicious. Do we squeeze this on top as well?

494
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:52,319
Hi.

495
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,620
- Hi.
- Hi.

496
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:58,160
(Squeezing the lime on top)

497
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:59,400
It's super hot.

498
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,529
- We should cool it down a bit.
- Right?

499
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:02,700
It's too hot.

500
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,169
- Here I go.
- It's hot.

501
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:05,500
- Wait. Let's eat it together.
- Wait for us.

502
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:07,869
It smells amazing.

503
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,040
Did you wrap both?

504
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,540
Yes, I did.

505
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,410
But it's extremely hot.

506
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,739
In three?

507
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,880
Isn't it hot for you?

508
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:17,379
(Cooling it down is a luxury for the director.)

509
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,350
Let's go. In 1, 2, 3.

510
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:28,290
(How do the tripe tacos they were excited about taste?)

511
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,259
(Impressed)

512
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,430
It's really good.

513
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,030
For real, it's good.

514
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,430
Really?

515
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:37,700
Satisfied?

516
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:40,040
- Is it that good?
- It's seriously good.

517
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,700
Can I have a bite, Kwang Soo?

518
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,410
- This one.
- This is what you call tacos.

519
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:46,379
- All my hair is up.
- This is tacos.

520
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,580
I have goosebumps.

521
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,509
Even the tortilla is crispy.

522
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:53,580
- What is it like?
- We're curious.

523
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,220
You can taste the smoky flavor.

524
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,849
- Is it smoky?
- Yes.

525
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,660
And it's really chewy.

526
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:04,160
(Woo Bin takes a bite of the tripe taco.)

527
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,530
- This is way better.
- Right?

528
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,130
- Than mine.
- Is it?

529
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:13,169
Woo Bin doesn't eat tripe, right?

530
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:16,609
- I don't.
- He says he doesn't like tripe.

531
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:17,939
But it doesn't smell at all.

532
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,979
What does it taste like?

533
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,039
- The smokiness...
- This one is also good.

534
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,309
- And...
- I can smell it from here.

535
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,450
the tortilla...

536
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:25,150
is different from what we've had before.

537
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,089
The ones we had earlier were uncooked tortillas.

538
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,919
But since these are cooked, there are crispy parts.

539
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,089
It's not moist either.

540
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,290
- Yes.
- Exactly.

541
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,260
It seems a little fried.

542
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:37,430
(They can explain easily when it tastes good.)

543
00:20:37,431 --> 00:20:39,329
There are crispy and moist parts.

544
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:42,999
If you combine cleanly prepared,

545
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,070
deliciously grilled, and finely chopped tripe...

546
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,209
with extremely delicious raw onions,

547
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:52,940
extremely delicious cilantro,

548
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,580
and extremely delicious salsa,

549
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,549
you'd have this.

550
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,850
It blends well together.

551
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,919
You can't taste it in Korea.

552
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,050
(They finally met their best taco!)

553
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,390
- I need another one.
- Me too.

554
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,530
- Woo Bin.
- Even the raw onions are good.

555
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:11,730
Didn't you want to trade bites?

556
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,029
(Woo Bin finished his plate.)

557
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,169
It's just too good.

558
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:17,669
You don't eat tripe,

559
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,670
but to pick them out with your fingers...

560
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,099
It's delicious.

561
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,310
(His picky eating habit has been fixed.)

562
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,370
- Try this.
- It's really good.

563
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,080
For real.

564
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,080
I'll order three more.

565
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:29,650
Tripe.

566
00:21:29,651 --> 00:21:30,749
You're having a tripe taco, right?

567
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,820
(They were only going to get one each.)

568
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,590
It's hard not to be delicious...

569
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,490
with these ingredients inside.

570
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,029
It's super good.

571
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,160
(The tripe tacos captivated everyone.)

572
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,489
I'm currently chewing it.

573
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:46,830
Even the tripe left in my mouth is delicious.

574
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,129
I bet this place...

575
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:51,130
has the best tripe tacos in Mexico.

576
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,540
Do you need napkins?

577
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,280
By the way,

578
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:02,879
it's really nice how it doesn't smell.

579
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,909
Isn't it fresh?

580
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:06,180
I thought it'd smell like fat.

581
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,550
But it didn't.

582
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:10,749
Personally, I think it'd be...

583
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,020
much better if it smelled more like tripe.

584
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,859
- Like more smelly.
- Even if it smells?

585
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:15,889
Even if it smells.

586
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:17,660
(As expected, the director is a real gourmet.)

587
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,269
(Their new order of tacos is here.)

588
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,429
- Two.
- Gosh.

589
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,540
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

590
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,170
- Did you put salsa on them?
- Yes, all of them.

591
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,939
- I'll just take one tortilla.
- Okay.

592
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,210
I prefer it that way.

593
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,479
It's hot.

594
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,980
We'd better wait a little.

595
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:36,510
It's too hot.

596
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:39,179
It's been a while since I heard your falsetto voice.

597
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,779
(Laughing)

598
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,879
It's super hot.

599
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,250
(Embarrassed)

600
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:52,559
(Touched)

601
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,000
How is it this good?

602
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,400
(Amazed)

603
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,940
The tripe is crispy.

604
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,380
Those who like tripe...

605
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,410
will know the crispiness of tripe, right?

606
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,420
- From grilling it for long.
- Exactly.

607
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,750
The crispy...

608
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:19,060
and chewy parts are mixed.

609
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:24,090
(The tripe taco's crispiness and chewiness are in harmony.)

610
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,730
It's delicious.

611
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,629
Should we get one more?

612
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:29,730
(Nodding)

613
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,030
We can't have more later.

614
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,569
- Are you going to have more?
- What?

615
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:34,700
Done?

616
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:37,140
- We're getting one more.
- Let's do that.

617
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,740
- Three?
- Yes.

618
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:42,249
(Making another order as two plates weren't enough)

619
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:43,450
Three...

620
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,450
- Three tripe tacos, please.
- Three?

621
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,249
Thank you.

622
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,390
(The expedition members' appetite really kicked in.)

623
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:50,850
This is truly delicious.

624
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,890
We'd better take this to Korea.

625
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,560
- It's the fast turnover.
- Here are three more.

626
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,329
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

627
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:00,459
Thank you.

628
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,129
To think you'd eat three plates of it.

629
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:03,970
(Already on the third plate of tripe tacos)

630
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:05,299
They're automatic now.

631
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,569
(Knowing what to do)

632
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:08,740
Isn't that too much salsa?

633
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:10,509
One tortilla is better.

634
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:13,779
- Right?
- I can see why people love...

635
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,080
Mexican tacos.

636
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,409
Try it with one tortilla.

637
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:18,480
- One?
- Not two.

638
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,720
It's much better.

639
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:29,990
(Stamping his feet from tastiness)

640
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,929
(Happy)

641
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,160
It's hot.

642
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:37,469
Exactly.

643
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,870
(Wrapping up with Coke)

644
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:46,680
Even the Coke is good here. I'm serious.

645
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,439
- It's different.
- No way.

646
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,850
It's different, I swear.

647
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,480
For real.

648
00:24:52,481 --> 00:24:54,049
(Even the Coke at the taco place is good.)

649
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:55,550
Try it.

650
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,120
It's too good.

651
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,790
- Hurry up and try it.
- It's delicious.

652
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:03,529
Did you finally find it?

653
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:04,860
Find the ultimate taste?

654
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,299
- Was that the taste of Mexico?
- For real.

655
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,799
That's what you call a Mexican taco.

656
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,229
You need to taste it now.

657
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:12,030
A few drops of lime juice with a swirl of salsa.

658
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,170
It's delicious.

659
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,000
Remember how the chefs were criticized...

660
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:17,439
on "Culinary Class Wars" for adding unnecessary ingredients?

661
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,539
Right.

662
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,409
None of the ingredients are unnecessary here.

663
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:22,080
(It has a clean taste.)

664
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,549
That was really good.

665
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:24,749
Isn't that funny?

666
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,720
The production team is having a party.

667
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,290
They don't know when they'll be back here.

668
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:32,120
- Goodness.
- Right?

669
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,189
- I could have ten of them.
- Same.

670
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:35,319
For real.

671
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,930
(Even the production team is devouring it.)

672
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,189
This place is sure to succeed.

673
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:39,630
(The director stares at the kitchen.)

674
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,999
It would still sell well...

675
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,829
even if it were sold at a higher price in Korea.

676
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,000
That's...

677
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,470
- What is it?
- Do you see...

678
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,639
the tripe that's being deep-fried over there?

679
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,110
(Deep-frying the tripe)

680
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:57,610
There's a pot boiling the tripe.

681
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,820
- In a pot?
- It's being steamed.

682
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:02,750
Even if it's not on high heat,

683
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:06,120
if you leave it for a long time, the meat becomes tender.

684
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,320
Boiling it on one side...

685
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,560
and deep-frying it on the other.

686
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:13,999
They mix the two and chop them finely together.

687
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,059
- I see.
- I see.

688
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:17,269
- That's why some pieces are soft...
- Is that so?

689
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,569
while others are crispy.

690
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:21,099
So that's the reason behind it.

691
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,769
That's why it's crispy and chewy.

692
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:24,739
- It's a mix?
- Mix the two and chop them.

693
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,810
I see.

694
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,810
- That's why it's good.
- You're right.

695
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:32,249
What a great meal.

696
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,649
(The culinary director had the best tacos.)

697
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:34,879
You just made me happy.

698
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,990
That was good.

699
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:38,689
Settle the check.

700
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:40,190
(It's time to pay.)

701
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,889
I'll pay for ours first.

702
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:45,089
- You had nine tacos, right?
- Yes.

703
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:47,529
"Please settle 9 tacos and 3 Cokes first."

704
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:50,070
Okay. How thorough of you.

705
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:53,270
"Please settle 9 tacos and 3 Cokes first."

706
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,170
Excuse me.

707
00:26:56,010 --> 00:27:00,910
(Showing him the pre-prepared translation)

708
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,910
- Check.
- Okay.

709
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:05,050
Credit card, please.

710
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,560
When I travel with the two guys,

711
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,620
I usually guide them around,

712
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:19,330
translate, and pay.

713
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,260
I do all three of them.

714
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:24,330
But now that we've got an auditor,

715
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:28,440
sitting still after a meal...

716
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:32,480
is pretty leisurely.

717
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,380
Shall we head to Zocalo?

718
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:39,179
All right, let's now go...

719
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,479
(Heading to Zocalo next)

720
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,419
to Mexico's central square, Zocalo.

721
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,890
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

722
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:48,320
- Thank you. Bye.
- Thank you.

723
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:50,090
Bye.

724
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,499
I could've had two more of the tacos.

725
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,630
- Right?
- Yes.

726
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:58,570
We should've had a few more.

727
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:02,070
I'm definitely going to miss it.

728
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:05,069
(The flavor of the tripe taco is hard to forget.)

729
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:07,639
Isn't that also leaning a little?

730
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,780
Yes.

731
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:12,950
- But Mexico City is...
- Viva, Korea!

732
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,419
- Korea?
- Korea.

733
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:18,290
(He failed to show off due to a local welcoming them.)

734
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:19,859
Mexico City...

735
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:20,890
(Trying again)

736
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,529
was built on top of...

737
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:23,690
- the water.
- The water?

738
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,360
The ground is soft.

739
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,400
Let's cross the street.

740
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:33,970
(He failed again.)

741
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:37,209
Mexico City is slowly sinking.

742
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:38,410
- Really?
- Yes.

743
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,340
- What now?
- What?

744
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:47,080
(The CEO didn't look into it that far.)

745
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,920
Turn right here, and we'll arrive at the square.

746
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,990
Goodness.

747
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,829
That's so cool.

748
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:58,860
It sure is.

749
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,659
Look at the crowd.

750
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,730
- It's really cool.
- But today's a weekday.

751
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:06,940
- Oh, my gosh.
- Goodness.

752
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,070
Look at that, Kwang Soo. Unbelievable.

753
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:11,240
It looks unrealistic.

754
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:15,740
It's a must-visit place in Mexico City.

755
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,449
- Is that so?
- Yes.

756
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:18,979
(The center of Mexico's politics and religion)

757
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,079
It's incredible.

758
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,520
They say it's buried under here.

759
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,289
- What is?
- The Aztec civilization.

760
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:24,990
- Really?
- Yes.

761
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:28,490
(Zocalo)

762
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:31,430
What? My gosh.

763
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:33,230
It's the Aztec civilization.

764
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:38,530
(Screaming)

765
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:40,540
What is it?

766
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,040
What was that?

767
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:47,310
(The origin of the scream)

768
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,480
They want you to come. Go.

769
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:53,880
(Out of the blue?)

770
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:58,290
(He has a sword to his neck.)

771
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,990
(Smile, my friend.)

772
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,360
In 1, 2, 3.

773
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:07,100
(Smiling)

774
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:11,630
(This time, all three take a photo together.)

775
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:12,769
In 1, 2, 3.

776
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:13,870
(Screaming)

777
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,340
(Screaming)

778
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:20,210
(Smiling in order to survive)

779
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:24,150
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

780
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,779
They startled me earlier.

781
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,390
- Me too.
- That was from their voices, right?

782
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,889
(The Aztecs' pipe makes a screaming sound.)

783
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:33,790
Your expression was real.

784
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:39,600
It's been a while since something startled me that much.

785
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,170
There are others like them over there.

786
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:45,430
You're right.

787
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:47,000
That's an incantation ceremony.

788
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,910
(An incantation ceremony to ward off bad luck)

789
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,380
The flag is huge, Kwang Soo.

790
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:03,090
(The trademark of Zocalo)

791
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:05,649
Everything here is beautiful.

792
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:06,659
For real.

793
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:11,260
(They can feel the unique energy of Mexico.)

794
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:15,359
It's much grander than the photo in the book.

795
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,400
Much grander.

796
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:18,369
It's much bigger.

797
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:19,570
(Zocalo is much bigger and grander.)

798
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:20,970
Can we go inside?

799
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:23,709
I see people inside.

800
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:24,740
You do?

801
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:26,310
I guess we enter from behind.

802
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:30,010
(Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral:)

803
00:31:30,011 --> 00:31:31,049
(The biggest cathedral in Central and South America)

804
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,510
- That over there.
- The one on top.

805
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,850
Do you see the people and things above?

806
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:36,849
Those are really...

807
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:38,089
How did they even...

808
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,520
(Altars made of gold and the ruins of the Aztec temple buried under)

809
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,390
Gosh.

810
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:44,360
- Goodness.
- Oh, my.

811
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:45,959
This is seriously...

812
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,659
(Impressed by the cathedral's interior)

813
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,430
- This is amazing.
- For real.

814
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:53,400
All of these are gold.

815
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,040
Exactly.

816
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:59,710
(The gold altar grabs the CEO's attention.)

817
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:04,110
Is that gold too?

818
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,320
I think so.

819
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:12,190
(While CEO Lee is off to look at the gold,)

820
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:21,030
(Catholic Woo Bin prays.)

821
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,200
This place...

822
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:25,929
- is making me feel holy.
- Right?

823
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:26,969
It's...

824
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:28,940
- calming me down.
- Don't you feel purified?

825
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,510
I feel like I'm becoming pure.

826
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,280
I can't help but feel...

827
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,480
my outfit isn't appropriate.

828
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,980
Wearing such violent shirts is...

829
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:44,650
(CEO Lee is embarrassed by his outfit.)

830
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,030
It's where people pray.

831
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:55,260
They wrote down the prayer intention.

832
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,040
(People are giving their prayers.)

833
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:05,370
They hang them up,

834
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,240
like the locks on Mount Nam.

835
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,750
The ribbon with your prayers on it.

836
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,810
You're right.

837
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:13,250
Everyone is writing one down.

838
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,720
(CEO Lee is interested in the prayer ribbon.)

839
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:21,189
- Do you want to write a ribbon?
- Yes.

840
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:24,189
- Okay. I can go with you.
- Yes, thank you.

841
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:25,330
You're so kind.

842
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:29,730
(A citizen approached CEO Lee, who was peeking around.)

843
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,939
Woo Bin. She's going to tell us...

844
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:35,440
where we can buy the ribbon. We need to buy one.

845
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,069
Three ribbons?

846
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:40,040
- Like this one?
- Wait a minute.

847
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:42,140
It's only 70 cents for 1.

848
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,950
(A kind citizen helped them make the purchase.)

849
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,420
- From Seoul?
- Yes, Seoul.

850
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,520
- Korea?
- Yes, Korea.

851
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:52,090
I love Korean...

852
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:54,019
- series.
- Thank you.

853
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:57,460
I really love your culture. It's wonderful.

854
00:33:58,290 --> 00:33:59,859
Are you on vacation here?

855
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,559
- Yes.
- Yes? That's cool.

856
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,299
We love Mexico, too.

857
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,999
- Welcome to our country.
- So beautiful.

858
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,070
Thank you.

859
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:09,970
But remember to pray for a miracle.

860
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:12,839
- Have a nice time.
- You, too.

861
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,979
- And bless you.
- Have a nice day.

862
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,410
- Thank you.
- Bless you.

863
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:17,210
Excuse me.

864
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,580
Could you make...

865
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:22,580
a receipt?

866
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:25,490
Like this?

867
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:27,620
- Are you talking about the receipt?
- Yes.

868
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:31,160
Where is Jun Wi?

869
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:32,859
So, where is Jun Wi?

870
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:33,960
That's right.

871
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,270
- Thank you.
- What did he say?

872
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,539
Were you even able to say that...

873
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,610
- in this sacred place?
- Kwang Soo.

874
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:45,840
- He said it in a sacred voice.
- Respectfully.

875
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:48,039
- I asked her respectfully.
- Respectfully.

876
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,380
"Receipt, please."

877
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:52,450
And I never asked...

878
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:55,120
for a discount here.

879
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,820
You're going to get punished.

880
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:02,159
(The three people came to write their prayer ribbon.)

881
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,590
He wrote such a long one.

882
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:05,130
Let's write together.

883
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:12,799
(They each write sincerely.)

884
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,900
There.

885
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,809
"I pray for the health of everyone around me."

886
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,670
- Great, I wrote the same thing.
- Let's go.

887
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:20,809
- Do we just tie it there?
- Yes.

888
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:22,140
Tie it there.

889
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,719
"Thank you for giving us the gift of an amazing trip in Mexico."

890
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,220
"Please allow all of us great health and happiness."

891
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:36,630
"Please give everyone I know health and happiness."

892
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:38,030
Including me.

893
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,430
(May it all come true.)

894
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:47,669
(They may have different personalities,)

895
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:50,840
(but they all have the same prayer.)

896
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:53,110
Let's go.

897
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:56,140
(With their minds at peace, they end the cathedral tour.)

898
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,250
My state of mind?

899
00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:59,650
It's a bit...

900
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,750
Every time I come to the cathedral,

901
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,520
I feel renewed.

902
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:09,220
It's been a long time since I went to Mass,

903
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:12,900
but once again,

904
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,700
I was able to reflect,

905
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:16,030
and...

906
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,130
I was able to pray...

907
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:22,170
for the people I love,

908
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:24,109
so I liked it.

909
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,410
(I liked it.)

910
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:34,980
(GBRB: Joy Pops Laugh Pops)

911
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,490
I'll be organizing this.

912
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,819
(The auditor starts to organize the receipts...)

913
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,990
(from the past two days.)

914
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:47,729
What was this 450 one?

915
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:49,000
I can't remember.

916
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,930
It's 33 dollars.

917
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:54,100
At 2:41pm.

918
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,970
Then isn't that for tacos?

919
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:59,140
This is the one for the tacos.

920
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:01,109
The tripe tacos. It was 360 pesos.

921
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,580
At 4:34pm.

922
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,150
What did we do between that time?

923
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,550
We went to the market.

924
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:08,880
(Oh, right!)

925
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:10,049
The t-shirts.

926
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:12,250
Did we pay for that?

927
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,990
I forgot about that...

928
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:17,230
and used our company card.

929
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:19,060
We need to get it deducted.

930
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:28,500
(After carefully going over all the receipts,)

931
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,280
(the auditor completes organizing the expenses.)

932
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,810
- Woo Bin.
- Yes?

933
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:37,810
My bracelet is gone.

934
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:40,680
Where did it go?

935
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,720
How did it fall?

936
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:44,790
How could you lose it...

937
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,819
in less than half a day?

938
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,120
I lost it right away.

939
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,790
It's really pretty, too.

940
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,830
I’m really disappointed in you.

941
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,029
Look for it.

942
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,959
You need to try and look for it, at least.

943
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,629
How can you not do anything after losing it?

944
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:58,669
But...

945
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:00,799
I didn't even calculate the expenses yet.

946
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,170
How could you lose it?

947
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:03,309
I know.

948
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:05,570
Go back out and walk the path we came from.

949
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,440
Up to the cathedral.

950
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,450
Up to the cathedral?

951
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:12,380
You need to find it.

952
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:14,720
I don't have the strength to find it.

953
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,020
I'll try to buy one again.

954
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:18,689
A different one.

955
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:21,060
If it's different, what's the point?

956
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:27,030
How much more energy did you lose with that scream?

957
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:29,630
From ten.

958
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:35,270
(He now has 5 percent energy left.)

959
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,339
He can't use his voice anymore.

960
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,440
It's just...

961
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:43,350
(The staff is here.)

962
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:44,949
The expenses?

963
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,820
Yes, we need to clear the expenses.

964
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,050
Jun Wi will join in.

965
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,619
(It is time to clear the expenses with the head office.)

966
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,290
We're in trouble.

967
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,389
(The auditor goes to prepare something.)

968
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:57,590
It will be a tough time.

969
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:03,330
(The auditor is ready for the settlement.)

970
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:07,070
Shall we start?

971
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,170
First...

972
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:10,839
- Will you tell us what you spent?
- Yes.

973
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,040
What we spent today.

974
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,310
Here. First...

975
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,850
Today's breakfast was...

976
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:21,779
- I wrote it down.
- The problematic breakfast.

977
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:24,119
If you put it down here, I will write it down.

978
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,590
This is so that...

979
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:27,020
we can gather them...

980
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:29,930
- and give the receipts.
- When it all ends.

981
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:32,760
And then we went to the churro cafe.

982
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:35,400
- We paid for this.
- Yes.

983
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,170
Then, we went to the market.

984
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,069
There, eggiscoming said that...

985
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:44,040
they would buy us our outfits.

986
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:47,639
I paid with our company card first.

987
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,309
We got a huge discount.

988
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:52,350
It was 180 pesos each,

989
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:56,820
but we got them for 150 pesos each for buying 3.

990
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,120
Actually,

991
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:01,760
I was wondering if I should tell you this,

992
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:06,160
but with the discount,

993
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:07,560
it was Woo Bin...

994
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,570
who was able to get it done, so...

995
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,840
Do you know what that means?

996
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,309
What do you think it means?

997
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:19,339
Asking for a discount?

998
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,510
Yes.

999
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,409
- It means, "Discount, please." - So, to be honest,

1000
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:24,979
you need to take into account...

1001
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,750
the discounted amount,

1002
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:29,280
but we won't be tight about it.

1003
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,089
The reason we're telling you this is because...

1004
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:35,360
if some error occurs in the future,

1005
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,559
then please put that into consideration.

1006
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,890
(KKPP Foods requests for a generous review.)

1007
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,930
After going to the market,

1008
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,600
we went to eat the tripe tacos.

1009
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,029
Today.

1010
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,599
- It was good.
- Yes.

1011
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,840
- That was for what we ate.
- Okay.

1012
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:53,980
And then, when we went to the cathedral,

1013
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:56,039
the...

1014
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,550
- The prayer ribbon.
- A lady from the north of Mexico...

1015
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:02,150
A lady wearing pink from head to toe,

1016
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,150
took a look at us...

1017
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:06,419
and told us that she wanted to explain the system.

1018
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,790
So...

1019
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:09,690
The ribbon cost ten pesos,

1020
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:11,260
but amid all that, I said,

1021
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:12,990
"Please."

1022
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,300
Like that,

1023
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,599
- I got the receipt.
- Did you get a discount?

1024
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,069
- No.
- No.

1025
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:20,300
It's a sacred place.

1026
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:22,469
- I don't ask for discounts...
- The receipt.

1027
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:23,870
- like that.
- He got the receipt.

1028
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,169
"Please."

1029
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:26,440
I said that...

1030
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,079
and got this receipt.

1031
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,480
- Thank you, this is great.
- Yes.

1032
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:33,819
And now,

1033
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:36,850
it's time for the problematic receipts.

1034
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,959
- The ones you wrote yourself?
- Yes.

1035
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,560
I thought I could just keep a record,

1036
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,930
make them, and give them to you.

1037
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:49,560
I think there was some miscommunication.

1038
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:51,030
That's just...

1039
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,099
- not anyone's fault.
- Sure.

1040
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,699
We just need to prevent it from now on.

1041
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,710
Because after that...

1042
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:58,310
I'll let you hear it.

1043
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:02,979
What does that mean?

1044
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:05,410
"Please fill out the receipt manually."

1045
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,149
The bracelet.

1046
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,120
We bought friendship bracelets,

1047
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:12,750
and I told them that...

1048
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:14,719
to persuade them all the way,

1049
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,360
- It's not easy to do.
- with a lot of effort,

1050
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:18,890
to get this made.

1051
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,860
- I got their signature...
- Yes.

1052
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,159
- and name.
- Yes.

1053
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,099
Until then,

1054
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,900
we were confused, so...

1055
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:29,539
- Don't say you were confused.
- No, I wasn't confused.

1056
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,340
They weren't clear about the instructions.

1057
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:33,439
(Cleverly passing on the blame)

1058
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,239
Because the instructions weren't clear,

1059
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,450
there was one receipt that we missed.

1060
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,579
Because we went to watch the wrestling match...

1061
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:43,219
- Yes.
- yesterday,

1062
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,520
- and our energy was...
- Yes.

1063
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:46,860
We were practically in a coma.

1064
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:48,589
- Seriously.
- Seriously.

1065
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:50,989
And there was something that Kwang Soo wanted,

1066
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:52,229
- so we bought...
- Hey, but...

1067
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:53,499
Strictly speaking, that wasn't...

1068
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,800
the mask that I wanted.

1069
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,370
The pink mask yesterday was 100 pesos?

1070
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,339
It was actually 100 pesos?

1071
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:02,439
- Was it 100 pesos?
- How much is 100 pesos?

1072
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,509
Isn't that 13 dollars?

1073
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:05,809
And on the bank app,

1074
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:07,109
I scratched eight lottery tickets today.

1075
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:09,240
We don't know how to figure that out.

1076
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:11,109
- It's big money.
- Was it 2.6 cents?

1077
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:13,350
We got 2.6 cents today.

1078
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,420
I hope you can consider that as well.

1079
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,389
If you consider all the discounts as well...

1080
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:21,390
That would be around...

1081
00:43:21,391 --> 00:43:24,060
Then how are we supposed to...

1082
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:26,459
We can't just keep giving all our funds to you.

1083
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:29,100
(KKPP Foods puts on an attitude with the 2.6 cents.)

1084
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:31,269
Didn't we put in an effort for the company?

1085
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:34,669
Like we said yesterday, with the interest...

1086
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:36,809
and lottery money,

1087
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:38,509
we will gladly give it to you.

1088
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:40,210
Are you talking about the 2.6 cents?

1089
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,780
The lottery money?

1090
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:45,280
- You won't take it?
- And for any future lottery money.

1091
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:47,519
Can they take it out of their personal bank account?

1092
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,950
- Yes.
- They can have it?

1093
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,449
And the interest.

1094
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:51,990
You can just withdraw it.

1095
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:54,320
Then, Jun Wi,

1096
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:57,190
could you divide them into the ones that are okay,

1097
00:43:57,430 --> 00:43:59,929
and the ones that are problematic...

1098
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:01,660
- based on the rules?
- No way.

1099
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:03,469
- I'm sure there are none.
- The ones that have no problem...

1100
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:05,299
- No way.
- and the rest.

1101
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,300
(Will there be any receipts that are not acceptable?)

1102
00:44:06,301 --> 00:44:07,399
Then we will have to...

1103
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,539
Until here, they are perfectly...

1104
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:11,609
- These are perfect?
- Yes.

1105
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:14,009
Then let's put the perfectly fine ones here.

1106
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:15,279
And these are also...

1107
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,750
Actually, with these,

1108
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,120
they said that we told them that we would buy them.

1109
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,820
Then I will keep this separate as well.

1110
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,550
Then this one is...

1111
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:28,160
Which one is it?

1112
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:29,290
The monkey mask.

1113
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:31,660
That mask.

1114
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:33,400
That's...

1115
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:35,299
- But now, - Wait.

1116
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:36,929
Kwang Soo isn't feeling so well.

1117
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:38,030
No, I mean...

1118
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:41,270
What if I give this to Jun Wi as a gift tomorrow?

1119
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:43,369
(Disgraced)

1120
00:44:43,370 --> 00:44:44,370
Sorry?

1121
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:46,369
- What if I give...
- Yes?

1122
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:48,510
that mask to you as a souvenir?

1123
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:50,910
(Sighing)

1124
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:54,080
You're buying the gift with company money?

1125
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:56,820
We didn't initially buy it as a present.

1126
00:44:57,390 --> 00:44:59,089
We sacrificed ourselves for the shoot...

1127
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:01,760
- and bought it, - Yes.

1128
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:04,330
but we still won't keep it...

1129
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:07,330
and give it back to the company.

1130
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,860
I don't think I will use it,

1131
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:13,200
so this receipt...

1132
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,039
will be considered invalid...

1133
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,339
- in the count.
- Why?

1134
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,840
- Why - Then what should we do?

1135
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:21,240
But this is only seven dollars,

1136
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,880
and the acceptable tolerance range was 400 dollars, right?

1137
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:26,450
Seven dollars? Do you know how much I got discounted today?

1138
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:28,920
The discount?

1139
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:30,989
- How much do you think?
- About 90 pesos?

1140
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:32,320
That was just one item.

1141
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,060
Good job.

1142
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:37,890
That's company money, so...

1143
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:39,489
Then what about this?

1144
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:41,499
I earned us 90 pesos,

1145
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:42,629
so take that out.

1146
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:43,869
(Sighing)

1147
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:45,570
I don't think that will be possible.

1148
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:49,070
We're supposed to be...

1149
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:52,109
- Without the discount...
- The instructions were not clear,

1150
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:53,839
so you need to take some out.

1151
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,339
- Yes, because...
- You should.

1152
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:57,879
if it were just me, then it would have been my problem.

1153
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,479
If you see here,

1154
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,780
you did all this perfectly,

1155
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,549
and it was just this one that you missed.

1156
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:05,020
And you can't get over that?

1157
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:06,819
Is our relationship really at this level?

1158
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:09,290
If you keep this up,

1159
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:12,830
we will be well below the limit we agreed on.

1160
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:15,729
- We don't know about that.
- Woo Bin, don't bargain anymore.

1161
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:17,369
- I can't take this.
- Don't bargain at all.

1162
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:20,439
So all the time I spent using Spanish...

1163
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,240
and working hard for the company...

1164
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,170
means nothing, then?

1165
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:26,709
Well, if you bargain,

1166
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:28,809
then you could buy something else as well.

1167
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:31,479
Oh, we're saving our money if we bargain?

1168
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:32,480
(He was making a big fuss over nothing.)

1169
00:46:32,481 --> 00:46:34,020
It's our money, right?

1170
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:37,519
You can eat another good meal with that,

1171
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,550
so...

1172
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,259
All right, Jun Wi. We get it, so just get lost.

1173
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:44,759
(The CEO of the subsidiary company is in a mood.)

1174
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,059
- This one.
- Then, this one was rejected.

1175
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:48,930
Yes.

1176
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:50,900
- I will keep this.
- Will you give me that?

1177
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:52,669
- This one?
- The rejected one.

1178
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:55,539
We want to take note of this one.

1179
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:56,599
You say it's pointless.

1180
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:57,910
Give it to me. It's my paper.

1181
00:47:00,410 --> 00:47:02,739
(Even the auditor is in a mood.)

1182
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:04,250
You say it's pointless.

1183
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,249
Then why are you taking it? It's my paper.

1184
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:08,080
- Gosh.
- Your words really sting, Jun Wi.

1185
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:10,220
I can't believe you.

1186
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,150
Your words really sting.

1187
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:15,359
- Jun Wi...
- Aren't we all here on a trip?

1188
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,360
Come on.

1189
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:19,460
Gosh, I'm going to bed.

1190
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:23,929
Because I heard that...

1191
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:27,099
we'd have some money to give and take today.

1192
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:29,340
- Yes, to the company account.
- There's more?

1193
00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:30,810
Now it's the money we have to give to you.

1194
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,740
For the money that you paid...

1195
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:35,979
for the staff's breakfast today...

1196
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:37,250
You didn't calculate the tip, did you?

1197
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:40,480
He included the tip.

1198
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:44,750
We verified the items the staff ordered....

1199
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:47,559
with the pictures that we took.

1200
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,220
- Yes.
- And so...

1201
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,590
Did you think we would...

1202
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:53,289
Come on, we're...

1203
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:55,929
- You are really hurting us.
- Did you think we would lie?

1204
00:47:55,930 --> 00:48:00,339
No, I don't know exactly what the staff members ordered,

1205
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:01,700
and since we just have this one receipt...

1206
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:04,110
You can just trust our words.

1207
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:09,309
I calculated that it was worth 470 pesos.

1208
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:11,050
What did you eat? Let's see.

1209
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:13,049
The ones that we ate were...

1210
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:15,449
two orders of tortas de carne, and...

1211
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:16,480
What is that?

1212
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:20,090
It must be something with meat.

1213
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:24,630
"Tortas" are the fried chips.

1214
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:26,760
- That was really good.
- That's what we ate.

1215
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:28,700
- The green one?
- Yes.

1216
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,570
- I liked that the most.
- We had two of those.

1217
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:31,700
Correct.

1218
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,469
- "Correct?" - And we had one frijoles.

1219
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:37,270
There's only one item that's added to our list, right?

1220
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:39,839
- We ordered two, - Yes.

1221
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,110
- but we only ate one.
- The green eggs.

1222
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:43,239
You ate one, and you gave us the other one.

1223
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,349
- Yes.
- Yes, that's right.

1224
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:45,949
Then I should take this one out.

1225
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:47,250
Of course.

1226
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:48,420
(Nice!)

1227
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,589
Come on, please make this accurate.

1228
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:51,749
We can't do this all.

1229
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:53,150
Do we need to tell you everything?

1230
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,760
- That was sharp.
- This is about trust.

1231
00:48:57,530 --> 00:48:58,590
Come on, Jun Wi.

1232
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:00,860
Okay, moving on.

1233
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,930
I'm the CEO of a company.

1234
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:06,230
Just because I'm sitting here like this...

1235
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:09,370
Goodness.

1236
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:14,309
I'm sorry, but I think I will have to review it.

1237
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:16,080
Of course. As much as you want.

1238
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:21,850
Correct.

1239
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,550
(The auditor has checked.)

1240
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,849
For the t-shirts, we need to give you the amount...

1241
00:49:26,850 --> 00:49:28,819
- that you paid for, right?
- Yes.

1242
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:31,389
Including the money for three staff members.

1243
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:33,459
- We will give you that as well.
- Right.

1244
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:38,570
We will have to send you 1,107.48 dollars in total.

1245
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:41,470
- Okay. Send that to us.
- But...

1246
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:44,710
we still have the 2,000 dollars that you need to send us, so...

1247
00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:46,039
What is the 2,000 dollars?

1248
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,509
The airfare for today.

1249
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:49,039
We need to give 2,000 dollars every day.

1250
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,210
We still have the 2,000 dollars,

1251
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,719
so if we deduct the money that we have to give to you,

1252
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:58,349
you need to send us 892.51 dollars.

1253
00:49:58,350 --> 00:50:00,360
Oh, you're here to collect money?

1254
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,120
I have more money to collect.

1255
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:05,560
(Sending money)

1256
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:07,799
- There.
- Thank you.

1257
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:08,900
That was very flawless.

1258
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:10,730
Don't you feel relieved?

1259
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:12,069
Please leave flawlessly.

1260
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:15,040
(They flawlessly clear up the debts from the past two days.)

1261
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:16,200
How much do we have left?

1262
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:18,640
- Now? Roughly...
- Just roughly.

1263
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:22,380
We have...

1264
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:24,880
What? That's not it.

1265
00:50:26,410 --> 00:50:27,419
What?

1266
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:29,650
(What's wrong?)

1267
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:31,420
Why do we have more?

1268
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:32,849
(They have more money?)

1269
00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:35,090
- What?
- He says we have more.

1270
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:37,630
Why do we have more?

1271
00:50:37,890 --> 00:50:39,029
(They have more money?)

1272
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:41,330
- What?
- He says we have more.

1273
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:43,260
Isn't that a good thing?

1274
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:46,170
But we don't know the reason.

1275
00:50:46,930 --> 00:50:50,740
Didn't you say that money is taken from the credit a few days later?

1276
00:50:50,970 --> 00:50:52,740
- Is that so?
- With credit cards,

1277
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:55,680
there's a time difference of 1 or 2 days.

1278
00:50:57,510 --> 00:50:58,580
Let's go to bed.

1279
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:00,009
Okay. Let's leave that out.

1280
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:01,580
I'll think about it.

1281
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,219
- What is it?
- Good job.

1282
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:04,819
Get some good rest now.

1283
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:06,189
- Good job.
- Good job.

1284
00:51:06,190 --> 00:51:08,360
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

1285
00:51:10,090 --> 00:51:14,000
(They have to wake up at 4am tomorrow for the hot-air balloon.)

1286
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:15,600
I'll go to bed now.

1287
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:17,730
No.

1288
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:19,600
What?

1289
00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:22,000
Don't we have to sleep a bit?

1290
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,410
- Not now.
- What?

1291
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:25,670
Not now.

1292
00:51:26,470 --> 00:51:27,840
We're not sleeping now?

1293
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,339
Go ahead and sleep.

1294
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:30,709
See what happens.

1295
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:33,480
(What will happen if he sleeps?)

1296
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,150
(Kyung Soo easily ignores the warning from Kwang Soo.)

1297
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:39,190
It's over here.

1298
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:40,920
Go to bed.

1299
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,460
(Woo Bin lets Kyung Soo get some rest.)

1300
00:51:44,190 --> 00:51:45,860
(Kwang Soo won't let that happen.)

1301
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,100
(I warned you, didn't I?)

1302
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,330
I'm not sleeping.

1303
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:52,370
I'm not sleeping.

1304
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:57,670
(What happens 1: Taking his pants off)

1305
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:00,480
Bugs will come in.

1306
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:03,480
(What happens 2: Opening the windows wide)

1307
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:13,420
(The next thing that will happen to bother his sleep)

1308
00:52:17,230 --> 00:52:20,899
(What happens 3: Close-up camera)

1309
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:25,200
(What happens 4: Taking his covers)

1310
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:28,270
(What happens 5: Making his legs fall asleep)

1311
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:31,870
(What happens 6: Running away with his phone)

1312
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:34,480
(Things keep happening.)

1313
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:35,640
Did you brush your teeth?

1314
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:40,450
(Since the youngest one brushed his teeth for bed...)

1315
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:45,520
(What happens 7: Forcing candy into his mouth)

1316
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:53,459
(He made Kyung Soo get out of the bed in the end.)

1317
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:55,400
It is good, though.

1318
00:52:58,070 --> 00:53:01,070
(Kyung Soo brushed his teeth again.)

1319
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:06,970
(Then the no-sleep-gum guy returns.)

1320
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,379
Go to bed.

1321
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:09,580
When you go to bed,

1322
00:53:09,710 --> 00:53:12,050
I might take revenge.

1323
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:18,690
(The older guys go to bed for tomorrow.)

1324
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:25,930
(Kyung Soo, who had sworn revenge,)

1325
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:30,330
(went fast asleep.)

1326
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:33,699
(Current time: 4:30am)

1327
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:35,000
- Hello.
- That's interesting.

1328
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:36,400
- Hello.
- Didn't you know?

1329
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:39,239
(Getting up early for the tour they reserved on the previous day)

1330
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,410
(The 3rd day of the expedition)

1331
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:43,280
Ready?

1332
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:47,080
Is the guide here?

1333
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:48,619
- Who's the guide?
- Where...

1334
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:50,519
- Hello.
- Hello.

1335
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,550
- Hello.
- Hello.

1336
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:54,059
You must be the one...

1337
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:55,619
- we've been contacting.
- Hello.

1338
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:57,489
Who did I message with?

1339
00:53:57,490 --> 00:53:58,529
Me.

1340
00:53:58,530 --> 00:53:59,889
Did you message me yourself?

1341
00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:01,099
Yes, I happened to be...

1342
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:02,929
- in the office at the time.
- I see.

1343
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:04,499
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1344
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:07,029
I'm your guide, Nando.

1345
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:09,040
I live as Fernando here.

1346
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:11,609
Without the front part, I live as Nando.

1347
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:13,769
- I like that.
- Thank you. Nice to meet you.

1348
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:14,979
- Guide Nando.
- Nice to meet you.

1349
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:16,240
Nice to meet you.

1350
00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:20,950
We're going to move in this car.

1351
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:23,620
I'm kind of looking forward to it.

1352
00:54:24,290 --> 00:54:27,390
It feels nice to go out this early.

1353
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:29,289
We're in our best condition...

1354
00:54:29,290 --> 00:54:30,559
- at this hour.
- Yes.

1355
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,060
I couldn't be better.

1356
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:33,290
What time is it in Korea?

1357
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:34,600
Right now, it's...

1358
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,430
It's 7:36pm.

1359
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,199
It's evening.

1360
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,600
It's perfect.

1361
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:42,439
I'll briefly tell you about what we'll be doing today.

1362
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:45,969
If we drive for about 40 to 50 minutes from here,

1363
00:54:45,970 --> 00:54:47,209
we'll reach the boarding area.

1364
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:50,709
There, you'll get on the hot-air balloon.

1365
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:51,810
Okay.

1366
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:54,149
Then we'll head to the meeting area at a restaurant.

1367
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:55,349
And...

1368
00:54:55,350 --> 00:54:57,279
you'll have a short coffee break.

1369
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,289
That's what we're going to do.

1370
00:54:59,290 --> 00:55:02,189
- I'll explain it to you as we go.
- Okay.

1371
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:03,489
- Okay.
- Then...

1372
00:55:03,490 --> 00:55:04,959
- I'll set off now.
- All right.

1373
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,460
Thank you.

1374
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,729
Sir, is this a popular tour?

1375
00:55:10,730 --> 00:55:11,899
Do people apply a lot?

1376
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:12,929
Yes.

1377
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:14,669
The hot-air balloon flies...

1378
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:17,440
over the pyramids.

1379
00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:20,470
It's something you can't see anywhere else.

1380
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,639
It must be done at this hour...

1381
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,950
when the wind is stable.

1382
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:27,310
So it's only available at this hour.

1383
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,819
If time allows,

1384
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:31,190
many people try it.

1385
00:55:32,050 --> 00:55:33,650
That's cool.

1386
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:36,789
That's the Monument to Independence.

1387
00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:38,890
It's called the Angel of Independence.

1388
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:40,800
I've seen that in the book.

1389
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:43,329
It was right next. Why didn't we come here?

1390
00:55:43,330 --> 00:55:44,700
(They didn't realize the Monument of Independence was right beside.)

1391
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:47,699
You didn't think about anything else because of the taco.

1392
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:49,770
(He blames it on the taco.)

1393
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,710
Sir, I'm sorry,

1394
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:53,409
but among all the tacos you've tried,

1395
00:55:53,410 --> 00:55:56,340
which was the best?

1396
00:55:57,210 --> 00:55:58,749
Actually, I like the one with beef tripe.

1397
00:55:58,750 --> 00:55:59,779
(What?)

1398
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:01,249
- Yes!
- You mean El Torito?

1399
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:02,779
- We had it yesterday.
- We tried it.

1400
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:05,020
- El Torito?
- We had that yesterday.

1401
00:56:05,090 --> 00:56:06,319
That settles it.

1402
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:07,489
Done. That settles it.

1403
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:08,820
- That settles it.
- That settles it.

1404
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:11,090
- It was successful.
- Yes.

1405
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,630
I knew it.

1406
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:13,789
Did you go there?

1407
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:16,029
- Yes.
- Did you eat on the street?

1408
00:56:16,030 --> 00:56:17,670
- Yes.
- Yes.

1409
00:56:17,930 --> 00:56:18,930
- Is that how you eat it?
- We even put on...

1410
00:56:18,931 --> 00:56:19,969
the traditional Mexican hat yesterday.

1411
00:56:19,970 --> 00:56:22,269
Then you tried everything.

1412
00:56:22,270 --> 00:56:23,439
That place...

1413
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:26,270
I think that place was the best.

1414
00:56:27,070 --> 00:56:29,579
- Sir, aside from the tacos, - Yes?

1415
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:32,980
is there any food you think...

1416
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:34,950
we must try in Mexico?

1417
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:37,549
There's something called...

1418
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:39,319
chiles en nogada.

1419
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,349
Is that...

1420
00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:42,259
- the one with white pomegranate?
- Yes, that one.

1421
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:43,260
We haven't tried that yet.

1422
00:56:43,261 --> 00:56:45,029
Its season...

1423
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:46,059
I hear it's from July to September.

1424
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:47,089
That's true.

1425
00:56:47,090 --> 00:56:49,200
But between August and September...

1426
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:52,229
It's meat and fruit inside the chili...

1427
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:54,240
and steamed.

1428
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:55,540
It's new.

1429
00:56:56,070 --> 00:56:58,069
Aside from that,

1430
00:56:58,070 --> 00:56:59,339
it's either you like it...

1431
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:00,610
- or hate it.
- Okay.

1432
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:02,979
It's a sauce called mole.

1433
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:06,580
It's made with cacao.

1434
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,280
Is it sweet?

1435
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:10,249
It's sweet, but a little spicy.

1436
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:11,720
It has a strange taste.

1437
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:15,989
It's something only available in Mexico.

1438
00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:17,690
- That's true.
- Yes.

1439
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:20,390
We should go try...

1440
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:23,499
- nogada and mole.
- Yes.

1441
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:25,870
(The culinary director's data has two new dishes updated.)

1442
00:57:26,330 --> 00:57:28,539
We passed it while talking.

1443
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:30,939
We just crossed a small bridge.

1444
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:33,540
That's the end of Mexico City.

1445
00:57:34,070 --> 00:57:35,840
This is the Administrative divisions of Mexico.

1446
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:37,550
Basically, this place is...

1447
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:39,580
a mountain town.

1448
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:41,180
A mountain town?

1449
00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:44,320
- It's huge. It's vast.
- The towns connect.

1450
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:46,019
Look over there.

1451
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:47,659
(The lights in the town shine like stars in the night sky.)

1452
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:49,660
That's beautiful.

1453
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:51,030
They look like stars.

1454
00:57:51,690 --> 00:57:53,890
About 1.8 million people live in this area alone.

1455
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:57,829
(That's 1-5th of Seoul population.)

1456
00:57:57,830 --> 00:57:59,629
As people crowded in,

1457
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:01,499
cars couldn't reach the peak.

1458
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:02,769
The road gets too narrow.

1459
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:04,440
- Then one will have to walk.
- Yes.

1460
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:07,880
If you look to the right,

1461
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:10,710
- it's the cable car terminal.
- What's that for?

1462
00:58:11,310 --> 00:58:12,950
That's the public transportation.

1463
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:14,620
- Really?
- Yes.

1464
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:17,349
The cable car is installed as a public transportation.

1465
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:18,389
(The cable car is moving.)

1466
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:21,159
It looks like Las Vegas ahead.

1467
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:23,519
- Are they connected?
- It's so flashy.

1468
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,059
It continues to connect.

1469
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:26,560
(It's bigger than expected.)

1470
00:58:27,530 --> 00:58:32,069
How was your stay in Mexico City?

1471
00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:33,269
It was fun.

1472
00:58:33,270 --> 00:58:34,339
- It was fun?
- Yes.

1473
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:37,070
I even bought the pro wrestling mask.

1474
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,869
If you have time to watch, it's fun.

1475
00:58:38,870 --> 00:58:39,909
- We did.
- We did.

1476
00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:41,710
- You did? Isn't that fun?
- Yes.

1477
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,480
- They were flying.
- Yes.

1478
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:46,180
I'm from Daegu.

1479
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:48,349
I somehow got the ticket when I was in Daegu.

1480
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:50,890
- So I went to watch it in Seoul.
- You were a big fan.

1481
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,319
How old are you?

1482
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,920
I'm Woo Bin's age.

1483
00:58:56,690 --> 00:58:57,930
Where in Daegu are you from?

1484
00:58:58,290 --> 00:59:00,529
I moved to Gyeongsan, which is next to Daegu.

1485
00:59:00,530 --> 00:59:01,530
I went to the university...

1486
00:59:01,531 --> 00:59:02,929
- in Gyeongsan.
- Really?

1487
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:05,529
- I went to Daekyeung University.
- What's going on?

1488
00:59:05,530 --> 00:59:06,769
Friend!

1489
00:59:06,770 --> 00:59:08,499
We really are friends. My goodness.

1490
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:10,239
Yes. What's going on?

1491
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:11,809
What's going on?

1492
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:13,009
I was always out...

1493
00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:14,169
- on Orange Street.
- Really?

1494
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:15,609
- What's that?
- Yes.

1495
00:59:15,610 --> 00:59:17,139
- What's the Orange Street?
- That is...

1496
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:18,379
- What's the Orange Street?
- It is...

1497
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:20,779
In front of the big university...

1498
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:22,079
- There are many stores.
- A university street.

1499
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:23,450
- There are many stores.
- It's a university street.

1500
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,089
We're totally friends.

1501
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:27,990
I didn't expect to meet someone who knows Gyeongsan.

1502
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:30,519
I've seen...

1503
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:32,259
- Kwang Soo before.
- When?

1504
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:33,329
You saw me?

1505
00:59:33,330 --> 00:59:36,699
- I went to school in Imun-dong.
- I see.

1506
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:38,529
- Really?
- I've seen you there often.

1507
00:59:38,530 --> 00:59:40,629
- I went to church there.
- You went to the church?

1508
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:41,670
Yes.

1509
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:43,469
How do you know?

1510
00:59:43,470 --> 00:59:45,670
It's huge in that town.

1511
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:47,939
I went to the university there.

1512
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:49,010
(A series of unexpected connections)

1513
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:51,010
Kyung Soo, by now, you should say something too.

1514
00:59:51,850 --> 00:59:52,909
(Thinking)

1515
00:59:52,910 --> 00:59:55,020
- Daegu is...
- Yeongnam University...

1516
00:59:55,650 --> 00:59:58,089
"Secret" was filmed in Yeungnam University.

1517
00:59:58,090 --> 01:00:00,019
- Really?
- So I stayed in Daegu.

1518
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:01,760
The Orange Street is right in front.

1519
01:00:01,790 --> 01:00:03,059
Really?

1520
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:05,860
In front of it, you can find flat dumplings and tteokbokki.

1521
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:07,559
You did it, Kyung Soo.

1522
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:08,960
"Secret" was filmed in Yeungnam University?

1523
01:00:09,030 --> 01:00:10,529
I feel relieved.

1524
01:00:10,530 --> 01:00:12,100
(Now they're all related.)

1525
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,640
(It's getting bright outside the window.)

1526
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:17,599
Look over there. The sun is rising.

1527
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:18,970
- It's beautiful.
- It's beautiful.

1528
01:00:19,210 --> 01:00:20,670
I'm already getting overwhelmed.

1529
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:23,940
I haven't seen the sky like this for so long.

1530
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:26,580
It's really clear today.

1531
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:28,650
We're lucky with the weather.

1532
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:31,089
(They start to see hot-air balloons one by one.)

1533
01:00:31,090 --> 01:00:32,589
- Look at the balloons.
- Are they balloons on the left?

1534
01:00:32,590 --> 01:00:35,319
The balloon companies are getting ready.

1535
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:36,789
- They're huge.
- They're huge.

1536
01:00:36,790 --> 01:00:39,229
They're getting ready to float.

1537
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:40,360
(Preparing the hot-air balloons for the sunrise)

1538
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,830
It's that big?

1539
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:44,329
This is my first time.

1540
01:00:44,330 --> 01:00:45,499
(The hot air balloons are bigger in person.)

1541
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,070
It's pretty.

1542
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:49,999
You may hop off.

1543
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,009
- You can leave your bags here.
- Okay.

1544
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:53,070
- Okay.
- Okay.

1545
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:55,880
It's pretty.

1546
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:01,650
It's huge, Kwang Soo.

1547
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:07,320
(Many hot-air balloons are waiting to fly...)

1548
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:11,429
(at the initial point of this tour.)

1549
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:12,689
That must be it.

1550
01:01:12,690 --> 01:01:14,430
The small square at the bottom.

1551
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:20,629
(The expedition's hot-air balloon is also getting ready.)

1552
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:24,540
(The expedition's hot air balloon is also getting ready.)

1553
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:25,969
You'll be...

1554
01:01:25,970 --> 01:01:27,069
You bought it yesterday.

1555
01:01:27,070 --> 01:01:28,409
- It's the pancho.
- Give me one.

1556
01:01:28,410 --> 01:01:31,079
- We lend it to you.
- Let me borrow it.

1557
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:32,679
If you put it on before riding it...

1558
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:34,050
It's all different colors.

1559
01:01:34,350 --> 01:01:35,619
(Red: Kyung Soo, Green: Woo Bin, Brown: Kwang Soo)

1560
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:36,920
(Brown for Kwang Soo)

1561
01:01:37,350 --> 01:01:39,189
I think it feels warm.

1562
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:40,319
- I know.
- I know.

1563
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:41,320
It's nice.

1564
01:01:41,321 --> 01:01:42,760
(It's stylish and warm.)

1565
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:44,320
Do you like it?

1566
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:46,090
The pancho? Yes.

1567
01:01:46,690 --> 01:01:48,130
It's colorful.

1568
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,260
I think it's cute.

1569
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,430
It's oversized, right?

1570
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:54,900
It's perfect for them.

1571
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,040
But then...

1572
01:01:59,370 --> 01:02:00,569
this is...

1573
01:02:00,570 --> 01:02:03,610
something I'd never get to experience in my life.

1574
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:06,350
I think it was a great choice.

1575
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:08,450
It's going up.

1576
01:02:10,450 --> 01:02:13,650
(There's someone who's more excited.)

1577
01:02:13,950 --> 01:02:15,820
I saw it in the review.

1578
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:19,330
"I got a new life when I flew."

1579
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:21,500
"I was reborn in the balloon."

1580
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:24,230
That person who shed tears.

1581
01:02:25,270 --> 01:02:27,299
I could relate to that person once I fly.

1582
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:28,400
(He's soaked in excitement.)

1583
01:02:28,940 --> 01:02:30,169
I'm looking forward to it.

1584
01:02:30,170 --> 01:02:31,610
(I'm looking forward to it.)

1585
01:02:31,810 --> 01:02:33,169
It's going up.

1586
01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:34,579
- Over there.
- Where?

1587
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:35,810
What?

1588
01:02:36,310 --> 01:02:39,780
(It's time to hop in.)

1589
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:41,849
- This way?
- Yes, this way.

1590
01:02:41,850 --> 01:02:43,020
Kwang Soo.

1591
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:44,550
It feels like a ride.

1592
01:02:44,590 --> 01:02:46,750
It's 3 and 3.

1593
01:02:47,350 --> 01:02:48,490
However you want it.

1594
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:50,320
- We should ride it together.
- You can split up.

1595
01:02:50,890 --> 01:02:52,830
What a new experience.

1596
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:58,170
The pilot will explain it to you.

1597
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:01,640
When it lands, the shock is pretty severe.

1598
01:03:01,770 --> 01:03:03,069
So when it lands,

1599
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:05,069
hold onto this and stand as if you were horseback riding.

1600
01:03:05,070 --> 01:03:07,810
So your waist won't receive any shock. Just remember that.

1601
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:11,410
(Notifying the precautions when landing)

1602
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:16,080
(They're ready to set off.)

1603
01:03:16,450 --> 01:03:17,450
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

1604
01:03:17,450 --> 01:03:18,450
- We're ready.
- Yes.

1605
01:03:19,390 --> 01:03:21,790
(It's finally time to take off.)

1606
01:03:22,990 --> 01:03:25,190
(They're getting excited.)

1607
01:03:25,930 --> 01:03:26,959
So we're flying.

1608
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,430
- It's moving.
- Yes.

1609
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:32,370
(It's starting to fly.)

1610
01:03:32,870 --> 01:03:35,340
This is already a high mountain. If we go any higher,

1611
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:37,600
we might not be able to breathe.

1612
01:03:38,270 --> 01:03:39,909
Oh, it's floating.

1613
01:03:39,910 --> 01:03:42,110
(They're a little nervous.)

1614
01:03:42,310 --> 01:03:43,610
- Bye.
- Bye.

1615
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:47,850
(They look excited.)

1616
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:49,649
This is amazing.

1617
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:51,080
- I know.
- This is all new to me.

1618
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:57,090
(KKPP's hot-air balloon in the air)

1619
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:02,060
(He looks around quietly.)

1620
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:05,670
- This is more stable than expected.
- Yes.

1621
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:10,740
It's moving softly.

1622
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:12,210
It's moving smoothly.

1623
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:15,180
Nice.

1624
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:17,680
It's a little scary, right?

1625
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:22,679
(When they turn their heads, they see...)

1626
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:23,949
The sun rises from there.

1627
01:04:23,950 --> 01:04:26,950
- It's beautiful.
- The sky looks wonderful.

1628
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:30,120
Nice.

1629
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:31,860
This mountain looks really cool.

1630
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:40,930
(The sight you can only see in the sky)

1631
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:43,840
Look at the sky. Look at the sunrise.

1632
01:04:47,470 --> 01:04:50,179
(Watching in a trance)

1633
01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:52,280
It turns out to be a cactus farm.

1634
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,850
It's amazing to see the balloons in the air.

1635
01:04:57,820 --> 01:05:00,649
- The camera can't capture it.
- No.

1636
01:05:00,650 --> 01:05:02,059
(The colorful balloons rise for the sunrise.)

1637
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:03,620
Look at the mountain.

1638
01:05:04,290 --> 01:05:05,760
It feels surreal.

1639
01:05:08,030 --> 01:05:09,630
- Where is it?
- The pyramid is right below.

1640
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:10,799
- Really?
- Yes.

1641
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,330
(Among them, the highlight is...)

1642
01:05:14,070 --> 01:05:15,339
Look at the pyramid over there.

1643
01:05:15,340 --> 01:05:17,069
(The pyramid in Teotihuacan, the city of deities)

1644
01:05:17,070 --> 01:05:18,469
- Yes.
- It's close.

1645
01:05:18,470 --> 01:05:22,410
(The pyramid in Teotihuacan, the city of deities)

1646
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:28,520
(The expedition is flying toward it.)

1647
01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:30,950
The pyramid in the back.

1648
01:05:31,790 --> 01:05:33,420
- It's surreal.
- I know.

1649
01:05:34,690 --> 01:05:36,360
That's 2,000 years old.

1650
01:05:37,790 --> 01:05:39,360
How did they build it?

1651
01:05:40,430 --> 01:05:42,399
- It's more than 2,000 years old.
- It's older.

1652
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:44,000
(Pyramid of the Moon)

1653
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,869
It's built with rocks.

1654
01:05:45,870 --> 01:05:48,470
Is that a rock? The round ones?

1655
01:05:49,170 --> 01:05:51,039
I don't know if it was this one,

1656
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:53,039
but they built something for 156 years.

1657
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:54,309
(Gasping)

1658
01:05:54,310 --> 01:05:55,840
I think that's the one.

1659
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:58,879
This pyramid...

1660
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,510
- It's clearly different.
- isn't broken.

1661
01:06:01,110 --> 01:06:02,419
It looks...

1662
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:03,680
- manmade, right?
- Yes.

1663
01:06:05,350 --> 01:06:07,050
It looks like a rice cake.

1664
01:06:08,490 --> 01:06:10,460
(Rice cake?)

1665
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:12,690
Is it hard?

1666
01:06:13,090 --> 01:06:15,560
(CEO Lee is going crazy.)

1667
01:06:16,130 --> 01:06:19,300
(This man, who was looking forward to the balloon ride,)

1668
01:06:21,230 --> 01:06:24,710
(keeps looking around.)

1669
01:06:25,970 --> 01:06:27,570
(Flinching)

1670
01:06:27,610 --> 01:06:28,640
What's that sound?

1671
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:34,650
(He's anxious alone.)

1672
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:36,220
Gosh, I think...

1673
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:41,219
- It's a little...
- I think we can stop going higher.

1674
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:42,589
I think there will be a fog like the ocean fog.

1675
01:06:42,590 --> 01:06:45,460
(CEO Lee's expectation is turning into fear.)

1676
01:06:45,860 --> 01:06:46,930
What?

1677
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:50,129
- I think we're going too high.
- What?

1678
01:06:50,130 --> 01:06:52,230
I think we're going too high.

1679
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:55,370
Kwang Soo, compared to them, we're too low.

1680
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:57,999
- But...
- We have to go that high.

1681
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,340
not everyone has to go up that high.

1682
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:04,040
(CEO Lee wishes a trivial fly.)

1683
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:07,450
- Everyone's higher than us.
- Who?

1684
01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:09,820
Hey, that's going really far...

1685
01:07:09,950 --> 01:07:11,820
- That's going really high.
- Yes.

1686
01:07:11,850 --> 01:07:14,550
They probably enjoy it, right?

1687
01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:16,389
On the top.

1688
01:07:16,390 --> 01:07:17,560
(Director Doh is curious about the air high in the sky.)

1689
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:19,330
Kwang Soo.

1690
01:07:19,590 --> 01:07:21,230
Can we try going up that high?

1691
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:23,000
That's not something we can do.

1692
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:25,900
We can choose the height.

1693
01:07:26,670 --> 01:07:27,999
We might as well try it.

1694
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,270
You're being too greedy.

1695
01:07:30,140 --> 01:07:31,509
- If you act greedily...
- But...

1696
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:34,470
this is once-in-a-lifetime chance.

1697
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:36,410
We should go up that high.

1698
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,479
- What do you say, Woo Bin?
- Let's do it.

1699
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:39,510
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1700
01:07:40,410 --> 01:07:41,450
Captain?

1701
01:07:42,620 --> 01:07:44,720
(Carefully calling the captain)

1702
01:07:45,050 --> 01:07:46,050
Captain?

1703
01:07:47,390 --> 01:07:49,520
(Raising his hand)

1704
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:51,259
Higher, please.

1705
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:52,729
- You want to go higher?
- Yes.

1706
01:07:52,730 --> 01:07:55,030
Okay. So we're going to take five and burn it.

1707
01:07:55,130 --> 01:07:56,460
We're moving up.

1708
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,530
(CEO Lee flops down.)

1709
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:06,270
(While CEO Lee, whose legs became jelly, takes a break...)

1710
01:08:06,910 --> 01:08:08,540
(Exclaiming)

1711
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:10,440
- It's so cool.
- It's so high.

1712
01:08:10,710 --> 01:08:11,849
It's so high.

1713
01:08:11,850 --> 01:08:13,350
The pyramid looks small.

1714
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:17,320
(They got so high that the pyramid looks small.)

1715
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,220
(They're on the top floor Director Doh wanted to go.)

1716
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:21,860
(Exclaiming)

1717
01:08:25,330 --> 01:08:26,659
I think it's a little dangerous.

1718
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:28,960
(It's high enough to make calm Woo Bin hesitate.)

1719
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,830
(Excited)

1720
01:08:30,930 --> 01:08:34,300
All balloons are below us.

1721
01:08:34,470 --> 01:08:36,169
We're on top. That's enough.

1722
01:08:36,170 --> 01:08:37,470
(It's finally enough for Director Doh.)

1723
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,170
We got up here in no time.

1724
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:43,610
Do you want to say hi to other balloons?

1725
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:45,750
There's one coming up right now.

1726
01:08:46,180 --> 01:08:48,580
(Trying to communicate in the sky)

1727
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:50,580
Hi!

1728
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:52,320
Hi!

1729
01:08:54,090 --> 01:08:55,590
I should've worn that hat.

1730
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,120
(Although they're not wearing the sombrero,)

1731
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:01,259
That one's tilted.

1732
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:02,600
(passengers on the other balloon kindly respond.)

1733
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:04,730
(Satisfied)

1734
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:07,229
This is pretty amazing.

1735
01:09:07,230 --> 01:09:08,470
There are many.

1736
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:11,440
They must be houses next to it.

1737
01:09:12,470 --> 01:09:13,569
(Auditor Kim enjoys the view.)

1738
01:09:13,570 --> 01:09:15,240
I think it was a town.

1739
01:09:16,540 --> 01:09:21,150
(Unlike the two, who soon got used to the height,)

1740
01:09:22,420 --> 01:09:24,280
(he can't even keep his head up.)

1741
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:26,189
Kwang Soo, how long do you plan to sit there?

1742
01:09:26,190 --> 01:09:27,250
How long?

1743
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:29,420
When we go down.

1744
01:09:30,190 --> 01:09:31,729
We're on the same level as others.

1745
01:09:31,730 --> 01:09:33,190
(He doesn't plan to get out of the basket.)

1746
01:09:33,490 --> 01:09:35,229
I think I'm having altitude sickness.

1747
01:09:35,230 --> 01:09:37,660
Kwang Soo, you got paid.

1748
01:09:39,570 --> 01:09:40,630
So what?

1749
01:09:41,470 --> 01:09:44,240
(The biggest crisis in his life)

1750
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:46,039
- Now that we're up here...
- We're the highest.

1751
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:47,739
It's worthwhile to be up here.

1752
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:49,140
- My ears are deafening. Hey.
- Yes?

1753
01:09:49,610 --> 01:09:51,009
Will you stand up slowly?

1754
01:09:51,010 --> 01:09:53,279
- Did you thump on purpose?
- I...

1755
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:54,549
We're the highest.

1756
01:09:54,550 --> 01:09:56,349
(Crisis adoption stage 1, vicious)

1757
01:09:56,350 --> 01:09:57,850
We're the highest.

1758
01:09:58,180 --> 01:09:59,990
I'm having altitude sickness for real.

1759
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:02,720
My ears are deafening.

1760
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:04,220
My ears are deafening.

1761
01:10:04,690 --> 01:10:08,600
(Crisis adoption stage 2, expressing pain)

1762
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:12,130
I want to die before I touch the ground.

1763
01:10:13,330 --> 01:10:16,200
(Crisis adoption stage 3, imagining the worst situation)

1764
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:17,970
What if this person...

1765
01:10:18,370 --> 01:10:20,170
If the captain...

1766
01:10:20,570 --> 01:10:22,039
tells me to give him everything I have,

1767
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:24,240
I'd even give him my teeth.

1768
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:26,110
If he says that now.

1769
01:10:26,650 --> 01:10:27,710
I'm serious.

1770
01:10:27,810 --> 01:10:30,520
(He just wants to get out of this situation.)

1771
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:33,350
We're going down now.

1772
01:10:34,190 --> 01:10:36,290
(The balloon is lowering the altitude.)

1773
01:10:36,490 --> 01:10:37,690
We're going down now.

1774
01:10:38,290 --> 01:10:39,329
Over there.

1775
01:10:39,330 --> 01:10:41,560
(CEO Lee finally sticks out his head.)

1776
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:43,929
What if the fire suddenly dies down,

1777
01:10:43,930 --> 01:10:46,629
going "Tap, tap, tap," what are you going to do?

1778
01:10:46,630 --> 01:10:48,839
Hey. Don't even mention it.

1779
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:49,840
(The what-if game begins again.)

1780
01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:52,040
Like, "Why is there no fire?"

1781
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:55,380
And the captain tilts his head.

1782
01:10:56,140 --> 01:10:57,739
We don't understand what he says,

1783
01:10:57,740 --> 01:10:59,149
- but he keeps radioing.
- Like the man...

1784
01:10:59,150 --> 01:11:00,549
who cleaned Woo Bin's shoes.

1785
01:11:00,550 --> 01:11:02,350
(Bitter)

1786
01:11:02,450 --> 01:11:05,450
The captain calls someone and suddenly starts crying.

1787
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:08,320
(Laughing)

1788
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:09,589
"Why?"

1789
01:11:09,590 --> 01:11:12,430
(He's retrieved enough energy to joke.)

1790
01:11:13,430 --> 01:11:15,530
I think that's where we're going to land, right?

1791
01:11:17,030 --> 01:11:18,370
Kwang Soo, you're up.

1792
01:11:19,370 --> 01:11:20,670
This is nice.

1793
01:11:21,170 --> 01:11:22,839
(CEO Lee enjoyed flying.)

1794
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:24,540
- This is perfect, right?
- Yes.

1795
01:11:24,670 --> 01:11:26,970
- It's...
- Okay, so we're going to land.

1796
01:11:27,210 --> 01:11:28,380
- Okay?
- Now... Well...

1797
01:11:29,380 --> 01:11:30,610
We have to crouch down.

1798
01:11:30,740 --> 01:11:33,950
(The horseback riding pose as they learned)

1799
01:11:34,410 --> 01:11:35,649
Okay. Three...

1800
01:11:35,650 --> 01:11:37,420
- Two.
- Two...

1801
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:40,089
(Landing)

1802
01:11:40,090 --> 01:11:41,489
(Shouting)

1803
01:11:41,490 --> 01:11:42,890
Brake.

1804
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:44,790
Funny landing.

1805
01:11:45,390 --> 01:11:46,629
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1806
01:11:46,630 --> 01:11:48,759
- Bravo, everyone.
- Thank you.

1807
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:49,999
(Even the landing was dynamic.)

1808
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,030
Bye.

1809
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:53,070
Watch out.

1810
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:54,929
- Yes. Thank you so much.
- Okay.

1811
01:11:54,930 --> 01:11:56,170
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1812
01:11:56,670 --> 01:11:58,299
It's not the end.

1813
01:11:58,300 --> 01:11:59,640
We have to get a receipt, don't we?

1814
01:11:59,770 --> 01:12:01,569
So we're going to make a toast.

1815
01:12:01,570 --> 01:12:02,809
- Okay?
- Yes.

1816
01:12:02,810 --> 01:12:04,880
(A toast here?)

1817
01:12:05,150 --> 01:12:06,609
(Exclaiming)

1818
01:12:06,610 --> 01:12:08,249
- What's that?
- I guess we're drinking here?

1819
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:09,949
He's getting us some champagne.

1820
01:12:09,950 --> 01:12:11,949
- That's awesome.
- What's going on?

1821
01:12:11,950 --> 01:12:13,949
This is the best part of the flight. The best part.

1822
01:12:13,950 --> 01:12:15,389
(Champagne toast, tradition generated from...)

1823
01:12:15,390 --> 01:12:17,260
(the first balloon pilots drinking a champagne after succeeding)

1824
01:12:17,590 --> 01:12:20,230
(They grab the glasses first.)

1825
01:12:20,330 --> 01:12:22,059
If you want to take it...

1826
01:12:22,060 --> 01:12:23,330
- Pop.
- Okay?

1827
01:12:23,730 --> 01:12:26,400
- Three, two, one.
- We have to receive it.

1828
01:12:27,470 --> 01:12:28,799
- Woo Bin, don't miss it.
- Woo Bin, you can do it.

1829
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:29,869
(The cork flies to the left.)

1830
01:12:29,870 --> 01:12:31,269
(Missed)

1831
01:12:31,270 --> 01:12:32,339
Woo Bin!

1832
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:33,839
(Screaming)

1833
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:35,940
Where is your athletic ability?

1834
01:12:36,980 --> 01:12:39,110
You can't do anything that involves a ball.

1835
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:41,680
(All thumbs)

1836
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:43,920
Okay. Then we're going to put them in the center.

1837
01:12:43,950 --> 01:12:46,850
And say cheers, right?

1838
01:12:46,890 --> 01:12:48,090
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1839
01:12:48,290 --> 01:12:49,489
In Mexico, it's "Salud."

1840
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:51,190
- Salud.
- Salud.

1841
01:12:51,260 --> 01:12:54,030
(They celebrate a successful tour.)

1842
01:12:54,130 --> 01:12:55,230
It's tasty.

1843
01:12:55,430 --> 01:12:57,230
It's a bit...

1844
01:12:57,560 --> 01:13:00,000
We're drinking Champagne at 7am.

1845
01:13:00,330 --> 01:13:01,430
This is new.

1846
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,470
I'm going to give you a gift.

1847
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:04,599
(I see!)

1848
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:05,709
It's a lucky gift.

1849
01:13:05,710 --> 01:13:07,410
- It's a hot-air balloon.
- That's right.

1850
01:13:08,070 --> 01:13:09,510
He made a hot-air balloon.

1851
01:13:09,940 --> 01:13:12,009
- It's a hot-air balloon.
- You're right.

1852
01:13:12,010 --> 01:13:13,280
I guess it had the same shape.

1853
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:15,850
(My goodness)

1854
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:17,550
It would've been very nice if I had caught it.

1855
01:13:18,180 --> 01:13:19,389
It weighs on my mind.

1856
01:13:19,390 --> 01:13:20,520
A little bit.

1857
01:13:21,490 --> 01:13:22,589
- It weighs on your mind, right?
- Yes.

1858
01:13:22,590 --> 01:13:24,120
It weighs on my mind a bit.

1859
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:26,330
Do you recommend this tour?

1860
01:13:26,390 --> 01:13:28,529
- I totally recommend it.
- What?

1861
01:13:28,530 --> 01:13:30,100
Wouldn't you recommend it?

1862
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:32,200
- Do you recommend it?
- I hope you enjoy it.

1863
01:13:32,330 --> 01:13:34,799
Seriously. You were crouched down the whole time.

1864
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:36,000
I saw everything.

1865
01:13:36,070 --> 01:13:38,299
I could see through the cracks.

1866
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:39,769
I could see it like this. It was very nice.

1867
01:13:39,770 --> 01:13:41,209
Kwang Soo,

1868
01:13:41,210 --> 01:13:43,210
there were no cracks in your spot.

1869
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:45,210
- There were no cracks.
- It was really nice.

1870
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:49,150
(GBRB: Joy Pops Laugh Pops)

1871
01:13:49,580 --> 01:13:50,649
(Plans for the 3rd day of the expedition)

1872
01:13:50,650 --> 01:13:51,849
(Hot-air balloon tour, breakfast, pyramid walking tour)

1873
01:13:51,850 --> 01:13:54,919
(Breakfast buffet)

1874
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:58,320
(From the Mexican dishes...)

1875
01:13:58,560 --> 01:13:59,689
It looks tasty.

1876
01:13:59,690 --> 01:14:02,600
(to the dishes that are made on the spot)

1877
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:07,800
(The breakfast buffet has various Mexican dishes.)

1878
01:14:08,170 --> 01:14:10,899
(The expedition moves to eat in earnest.)

1879
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:12,839
- Quesadillas look tasty.
- Yes.

1880
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:13,970
Quesadillas.

1881
01:14:14,210 --> 01:14:16,140
People always line up over there.

1882
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:18,409
This is where they make quesadillas.

1883
01:14:18,410 --> 01:14:20,210
A special ingredient is...

1884
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:22,220
this black thing.

1885
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:25,150
It's corn with mold.

1886
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:26,389
(What?)

1887
01:14:26,390 --> 01:14:28,149
It's called huitlacoche.

1888
01:14:28,150 --> 01:14:29,789
Corn that gets infected with a fungal mold...

1889
01:14:29,790 --> 01:14:31,289
and grows in size...

1890
01:14:31,290 --> 01:14:33,030
is used as an ingredient.

1891
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:34,690
- So...
- Is it tasty?

1892
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:36,929
Try it.

1893
01:14:36,930 --> 01:14:37,999
(Corn smut intrigues Director.)

1894
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,200
Some like it, others don't.

1895
01:14:39,270 --> 01:14:41,029
But the flavors burst in your mouth.

1896
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:43,069
In a sense, it's...

1897
01:14:43,070 --> 01:14:45,810
- cheonggukjang of Mexico.
- I see.

1898
01:14:46,070 --> 01:14:47,309
So...

1899
01:14:47,310 --> 01:14:49,679
if you're curious, you should add it to your quesadilla...

1900
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:50,739
and try it.

1901
01:14:50,740 --> 01:14:52,210
I just want 1 or 2 kernels.

1902
01:14:52,610 --> 01:14:53,950
How do you say, "Just a bit?"

1903
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:55,319
"Just a bit?"

1904
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:56,579
- Poquito.
- Poquito.

1905
01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:57,620
Yes. Poquito.

1906
01:14:58,550 --> 01:14:59,620
And...

1907
01:14:59,990 --> 01:15:01,120
how do you say "A lot?"

1908
01:15:01,350 --> 01:15:02,389
Mucho.

1909
01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:03,789
- Mucho.
- Mucho.

1910
01:15:03,790 --> 01:15:05,560
- Poquito.
- Poquito. Mucho.

1911
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:08,729
(They got a quick Spanish lesson to order more smoothly.)

1912
01:15:08,730 --> 01:15:09,800
There they go.

1913
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:13,500
(The breakfast buffet opens.)

1914
01:15:14,530 --> 01:15:16,040
What kind of quesadilla will you get?

1915
01:15:17,140 --> 01:15:19,239
- One, two, three, four.
- Three, four.

1916
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:20,840
(One, two, three, four)

1917
01:15:20,910 --> 01:15:22,310
- Do you want to try it?
- Poquito.

1918
01:15:23,540 --> 01:15:24,779
What's this?

1919
01:15:24,780 --> 01:15:25,810
Son sesos.

1920
01:15:26,610 --> 01:15:28,110
- Tuna?
- This is...

1921
01:15:28,450 --> 01:15:29,580
pig brain.

1922
01:15:30,350 --> 01:15:31,749
- Pig brain?
- Yes.

1923
01:15:31,750 --> 01:15:33,790
(Pig brain?)

1924
01:15:33,890 --> 01:15:35,460
- Would you like to try it?
- I want to try it.

1925
01:15:35,790 --> 01:15:37,789
(Being a foodie, the director is unhesitant when it comes to eating.)

1926
01:15:37,790 --> 01:15:41,630
(Quesadillas are made to order.)

1927
01:15:41,860 --> 01:15:43,900
- Thank you.
- Corn smut.

1928
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,160
Thank you.

1929
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:50,400
Is this the one with the mushroom?

1930
01:15:50,470 --> 01:15:51,500
Corn smut?

1931
01:15:51,870 --> 01:15:53,270
It's corn with mold.

1932
01:15:54,610 --> 01:15:56,510
- Corn with mold.
- It's this one.

1933
01:15:56,780 --> 01:15:59,449
- It's Mexico's...
- My goodness.

1934
01:15:59,450 --> 01:16:01,180
Mexico's cheonggukjang.

1935
01:16:02,420 --> 01:16:03,780
There's pig brain too.

1936
01:16:05,250 --> 01:16:07,050
It looks like mayonnaise-dressed tuna.

1937
01:16:07,850 --> 01:16:09,520
Is that pig brain?

1938
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:12,360
Try it.

1939
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:15,929
Try the corn.

1940
01:16:15,930 --> 01:16:17,000
(Try the corn smut.)

1941
01:16:17,860 --> 01:16:19,000
Let's do the stopwatch.

1942
01:16:19,370 --> 01:16:20,470
I don't want it.

1943
01:16:20,770 --> 01:16:22,440
Hey, corn kernels became this big.

1944
01:16:23,540 --> 01:16:24,669
The corn kernels are huge.

1945
01:16:24,670 --> 01:16:26,210
- Is this corn smut?
- It's because of the mold.

1946
01:16:26,310 --> 01:16:27,709
- Cheonggukjang.
- Let's do the stopwatch.

1947
01:16:27,710 --> 01:16:28,909
(Let's do the stopwatch.)

1948
01:16:28,910 --> 01:16:30,009
(Shaking his head no)

1949
01:16:30,010 --> 01:16:31,180
Let me smell it.

1950
01:16:32,450 --> 01:16:33,950
It doesn't smell bad.

1951
01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:36,780
It smells sour.

1952
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:38,480
Rock-paper-scissors?

1953
01:16:39,690 --> 01:16:41,149
- Rock...
- Play or lose, rock-paper-scissors.

1954
01:16:41,150 --> 01:16:42,520
(Rock)

1955
01:16:42,990 --> 01:16:44,359
He hates food like this.

1956
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:45,460
(Woo Bin loses.)

1957
01:16:46,230 --> 01:16:47,459
- Describe the taste.
- Eat just a little bit.

1958
01:16:47,460 --> 01:16:49,060
Isn't it better than pig brain?

1959
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:50,460
You're right.

1960
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:52,369
I think it'll be good for health.

1961
01:16:52,370 --> 01:16:54,370
That's right. It's like cheonggukjang.

1962
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:55,970
Apparently, it's tasty.

1963
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:01,939
(I see.)

1964
01:17:01,940 --> 01:17:03,110
It tastes...

1965
01:17:04,980 --> 01:17:06,609
I think it'll be good for health.

1966
01:17:06,610 --> 01:17:08,550
That's right. It's like cheonggukjang.

1967
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:10,250
Apparently, it's tasty.

1968
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:16,059
(I see.)

1969
01:17:16,060 --> 01:17:17,120
It tastes...

1970
01:17:18,420 --> 01:17:19,830
a bit like mushrooms.

1971
01:17:20,230 --> 01:17:21,289
In terms of texture?

1972
01:17:21,290 --> 01:17:22,730
In terms of texture and taste.

1973
01:17:25,330 --> 01:17:26,699
(Taking a tiny bite)

1974
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:27,769
That's too little.

1975
01:17:27,770 --> 01:17:29,239
Are you kidding me?

1976
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:32,509
(He takes another bite.)

1977
01:17:32,510 --> 01:17:34,340
- There's no aversion, right?
- It's a bit bitter.

1978
01:17:34,940 --> 01:17:36,110
He's right. It's bitter.

1979
01:17:36,180 --> 01:17:37,280
- Is it bitter?
- Yes.

1980
01:17:38,780 --> 01:17:40,909
It doesn't really taste like anything.

1981
01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:42,320
I think people eat it for texture.

1982
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:44,550
That's why it's like a mushroom.

1983
01:17:45,220 --> 01:17:46,490
There's a bit of aroma, right?

1984
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:51,860
It's bitter. It tastes bitter.

1985
01:17:52,590 --> 01:17:54,759
(He puts it in his mouth without hesitation.)

1986
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:55,930
It isn't...

1987
01:17:57,130 --> 01:17:59,069
The aroma becomes stronger with time.

1988
01:17:59,070 --> 01:18:00,870
It's like a mushroom. A bitter mushroom.

1989
01:18:00,930 --> 01:18:01,999
A bitter mushroom.

1990
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,539
Bitter king oyster mushroom or shiitake mushroom.

1991
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:05,140
King oyster mushroom or shiitake mushroom.

1992
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:07,009
It's a bit bitter.

1993
01:18:07,010 --> 01:18:08,139
(In any case, it tastes healthy.)

1994
01:18:08,140 --> 01:18:09,409
Let's try the pig brain.

1995
01:18:09,410 --> 01:18:10,709
- Kwang Soo.
- Pig brain.

1996
01:18:10,710 --> 01:18:11,939
Play or lose, rock-paper-scissors.

1997
01:18:11,940 --> 01:18:13,450
- I don't want it.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1998
01:18:15,110 --> 01:18:16,379
Pig brain?

1999
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:19,620
(In rock-paper-scissors, the one who suggests the game always loses.)

2000
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:25,959
What is it?

2001
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:27,130
It tastes a bit like...

2002
01:18:27,490 --> 01:18:29,259
You know the French dish, pate, right?

2003
01:18:29,260 --> 01:18:31,399
- Yes.
- It contains ground liver.

2004
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:32,529
It tastes exactly the same.

2005
01:18:32,530 --> 01:18:34,970
- Then it must be savory.
- It's savory. It's very savory.

2006
01:18:35,370 --> 01:18:36,899
Then it must be similar to the liver in sundae.

2007
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:38,100
It smells like liver in sundae.

2008
01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:40,139
It's okay. There's food in my mouth.

2009
01:18:40,140 --> 01:18:41,210
Try it.

2010
01:18:44,780 --> 01:18:45,950
Let me just smell it.

2011
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:49,780
The smell of corn is too strong.

2012
01:18:49,820 --> 01:18:50,850
Corn.

2013
01:18:51,220 --> 01:18:52,589
This one...

2014
01:18:52,590 --> 01:18:53,789
beats the corn.

2015
01:18:53,790 --> 01:18:56,290
(The pig brain beats the corn.)

2016
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:00,129
(Glancing over)

2017
01:19:00,130 --> 01:19:01,189
What is it?

2018
01:19:01,190 --> 01:19:02,560
Say something.

2019
01:19:02,630 --> 01:19:03,630
Try it.

2020
01:19:03,631 --> 01:19:04,829
You have to try it. I don't know what to say.

2021
01:19:04,830 --> 01:19:05,830
(Woo Bin takes a bite as well.)

2022
01:19:05,831 --> 01:19:07,370
Did Woo Bin try it?

2023
01:19:09,070 --> 01:19:10,769
(I see.)

2024
01:19:10,770 --> 01:19:11,970
The thing is,

2025
01:19:12,610 --> 01:19:14,070
it tastes like cheese.

2026
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:16,340
If it's cheese, it'll be very nice.

2027
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:19,110
It's like foie gras with jam.

2028
01:19:19,150 --> 01:19:21,050
- If you hadn't told me, - I know.

2029
01:19:21,550 --> 01:19:22,780
I would've enjoyed it.

2030
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:25,990
There are other types of tacos that use offal.

2031
01:19:26,190 --> 01:19:27,290
They eat eyeballs as well.

2032
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:29,159
- Pig eyeballs?
- Yes.

2033
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:30,189
They eat them.

2034
01:19:30,190 --> 01:19:31,819
Some people only want tacos...

2035
01:19:31,820 --> 01:19:33,089
with ingredients like brain and eyeballs.

2036
01:19:33,090 --> 01:19:35,159
- There are hardcore fans.
- Yes, there are hardcore fans.

2037
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:36,730
- Pig offal.
- Yes.

2038
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:38,559
Many people like fish eyeballs.

2039
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:39,670
That's right.

2040
01:19:41,030 --> 01:19:42,970
We'll see the pyramid from the ground, right?

2041
01:19:43,370 --> 01:19:45,609
If you look at the pyramid as you walk,

2042
01:19:45,610 --> 01:19:47,340
it feels different.

2043
01:19:47,970 --> 01:19:49,339
But here's one thing.

2044
01:19:49,340 --> 01:19:52,780
We told you that the rules were a bit strict.

2045
01:19:53,110 --> 01:19:57,519
You can film it with your cellphone.

2046
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:59,390
But the camera crew can't enter.

2047
01:19:59,790 --> 01:20:02,490
We'll give you two cellphones.

2048
01:20:02,620 --> 01:20:07,030
Use one to film the sites...

2049
01:20:07,190 --> 01:20:10,129
from your perspective.

2050
01:20:10,130 --> 01:20:12,099
Use the other one to film your faces...

2051
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:13,870
in a selfie mode.

2052
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,239
Film both the sites and your faces.

2053
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:18,470
We received permission to film on those terms.

2054
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:20,809
Let's do the stopwatch and have the loser film...

2055
01:20:20,810 --> 01:20:22,010
- the 3 members.
- The 3 members.

2056
01:20:22,740 --> 01:20:23,979
The winner won't do anything, right?

2057
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:25,309
- The winner won't do anything.
- That's the best.

2058
01:20:25,310 --> 01:20:27,280
- The runner-up will film the sites.
- The sites.

2059
01:20:29,780 --> 01:20:31,620
The thing is, this trip is like...

2060
01:20:33,050 --> 01:20:34,819
the company's training program.

2061
01:20:34,820 --> 01:20:35,959
(Nodding)

2062
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:37,760
The CEO doesn't usually do something like this, right?

2063
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:40,260
I'm going to do the stopwatch, but isn't that the case?

2064
01:20:40,290 --> 01:20:42,760
But we've always done things fairly.

2065
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:45,059
And the CEO should set an example.

2066
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:46,269
Whose money...

2067
01:20:46,270 --> 01:20:47,929
Whose money is being used for this trip?

2068
01:20:47,930 --> 01:20:49,569
But you said...

2069
01:20:49,570 --> 01:20:51,370
that you didn't want your juniors to pay.

2070
01:20:51,540 --> 01:20:53,070
- When did I say that?
- So you wanted to do things fairly.

2071
01:20:53,310 --> 01:20:54,710
- I'm not against it.
- You wanted to do things fairly.

2072
01:20:56,110 --> 01:20:58,809
You aren't against your juniors paying.

2073
01:20:58,810 --> 01:21:01,480
But we always use the stopwatch...

2074
01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:03,320
because you don't want to pay.

2075
01:21:03,450 --> 01:21:05,120
That's right. That's the correct explanation.

2076
01:21:06,450 --> 01:21:07,649
Stay out of this.

2077
01:21:07,650 --> 01:21:09,320
(Stay out of this.)

2078
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:12,490
Let's begin.

2079
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:16,959
(Woo Bin starts the stopwatch first.)

2080
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:17,960
Please let me win.

2081
01:21:17,961 --> 01:21:19,300
The one with the lowest number will film the faces.

2082
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:26,340
(He begins with 5, an average number.)

2083
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:31,539
Who is next?

2084
01:21:31,540 --> 01:21:33,010
(He became 0 Boy today as well.)

2085
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:37,849
(You punk)

2086
01:21:37,850 --> 01:21:41,050
(Kwang Soo goes next.)

2087
01:21:42,890 --> 01:21:44,060
One.

2088
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:47,589
Eight.

2089
01:21:47,590 --> 01:21:48,590
(He avoids placing last.)

2090
01:21:48,591 --> 01:21:50,430
In any case, I'll be able to see the pyramid.

2091
01:21:53,230 --> 01:21:54,799
I have the highest possibility, right?

2092
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,640
(Current Score, Woo Bin: 0, Kwang Soo: 8)

2093
01:21:56,700 --> 01:21:58,770
- Five.
- I'll win even if I get two.

2094
01:22:02,380 --> 01:22:03,380
Okay!

2095
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:06,480
(Director becomes the winner.)

2096
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:10,180
I'll walk...

2097
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:12,420
without doing anything.

2098
01:22:14,020 --> 01:22:15,760
I suddenly feel so happy.

2099
01:22:18,790 --> 01:22:21,330
So what is it going to be? Kwang Soo...

2100
01:22:21,630 --> 01:22:23,560
I'll film the sites.

2101
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:27,030
(He'll film the members of the expedition.)

2102
01:22:27,370 --> 01:22:29,299
If it's hard to film three members, just film yourself.

2103
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:31,270
(Nodding)

2104
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:33,470
I'll film just the two of us.

2105
01:22:36,110 --> 01:22:37,440
Then I won't film the sites.

2106
01:22:37,910 --> 01:22:40,350
- You need to film the sites.
- I'll film myself. I don't know.

2107
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:42,180
I'll just apologize afterward.

2108
01:22:43,580 --> 01:22:44,949
(The expedition wears short sleeves for the walking tour.)

2109
01:22:44,950 --> 01:22:46,320
After the tour,

2110
01:22:46,820 --> 01:22:48,590
let's go to the hotel and rest for two hours.

2111
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:50,390
Then we'll have dinner,

2112
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:52,490
come back, and...

2113
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:54,730
- Shall we make plans then?
- Yes.

2114
01:22:55,330 --> 01:22:56,830
Let's make plans and pack up.

2115
01:22:57,100 --> 01:22:58,500
What time is our flight tomorrow?

2116
01:22:59,430 --> 01:23:00,469
You need to book a flight.

2117
01:23:00,470 --> 01:23:01,769
- What?
- You need to book a flight.

2118
01:23:01,770 --> 01:23:03,039
Do we need to book a flight?

2119
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,040
(Nodding)

2120
01:23:04,041 --> 01:23:05,969
- What...
- We have a lot to do.

2121
01:23:05,970 --> 01:23:07,309
Hold on. We...

2122
01:23:07,310 --> 01:23:08,570
We have a lot to do.

2123
01:23:08,770 --> 01:23:11,540
- We haven't booked a flight.
- We're anxious too.

2124
01:23:12,180 --> 01:23:14,309
- Are there seats?
- Maybe there aren't any seats.

2125
01:23:14,310 --> 01:23:15,580
It's the day before.

2126
01:23:15,650 --> 01:23:18,049
We need to rent a car too.

2127
01:23:18,050 --> 01:23:19,090
We need to rent a car too.

2128
01:23:19,590 --> 01:23:21,120
Gosh, we have so much to do.

2129
01:23:21,250 --> 01:23:22,719
- A car?
- A car.

2130
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:24,060
We need to book it.

2131
01:23:24,690 --> 01:23:25,760
Can I use it on my face?

2132
01:23:26,260 --> 01:23:28,389
Put some on your hand and rub it into your face.

2133
01:23:28,390 --> 01:23:29,629
It isn't too hot.

2134
01:23:29,630 --> 01:23:35,230
(A beauty routine to block the UV rays)

2135
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:37,400
There's a clump.

2136
01:23:38,470 --> 01:23:40,110
- Don't lie.
- There's a clump.

2137
01:23:40,470 --> 01:23:42,040
(In disbelief)

2138
01:23:42,070 --> 01:23:46,380
In Korea, they advise against going out...

2139
01:23:46,810 --> 01:23:48,109
if the UV index is seven.

2140
01:23:48,110 --> 01:23:49,350
Here, the average UV index is ten.

2141
01:23:50,350 --> 01:23:51,480
Please put some behind my neck.

2142
01:23:52,420 --> 01:23:53,720
Shouldn't we use some more then?

2143
01:23:54,450 --> 01:23:55,519
Spray it on your hands and put it...

2144
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:56,620
- on the back of your neck.
- So that's how you do it.

2145
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:58,520
Put it on your face too.

2146
01:24:02,060 --> 01:24:05,060
(Slapping)

2147
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:07,630
(After the beauty routine)

2148
01:24:08,370 --> 01:24:09,970
- Shall we go?
- Shall we go?

2149
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:13,109
(They move to the pyramid for the walking tour.)

2150
01:24:13,110 --> 01:24:14,869
This historical site...

2151
01:24:14,870 --> 01:24:18,540
got included in UNESCO's World Heritage List in 1987.

2152
01:24:18,740 --> 01:24:21,610
Since they're trying to preserve it,

2153
01:24:21,780 --> 01:24:23,850
there are pebbles on the road.

2154
01:24:24,380 --> 01:24:27,289
They keep the cars from going too fast.

2155
01:24:27,290 --> 01:24:29,089
They also give the aesthetics...

2156
01:24:29,090 --> 01:24:30,890
- of the past.
- I see.

2157
01:24:31,990 --> 01:24:34,690
When you're in Mexico...

2158
01:24:34,990 --> 01:24:37,259
In Korea, you nod to express gratitude...

2159
01:24:37,260 --> 01:24:39,070
- from a distance.
- Yes.

2160
01:24:39,230 --> 01:24:42,539
In Mexico, there's a hand gesture you can use to express gratitude.

2161
01:24:42,540 --> 01:24:43,899
- That's nice.
- To do that,

2162
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:45,740
you show the back of your hand.

2163
01:24:45,870 --> 01:24:47,569
If you show the back of your hand from a distance, it's "Thank you."

2164
01:24:47,570 --> 01:24:48,770
It means, "Thank you."

2165
01:24:48,940 --> 01:24:51,239
Let's say a car stops...

2166
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:52,379
so that you can cross the road.

2167
01:24:52,380 --> 01:24:54,280
Then you do this to say, "Thank you."

2168
01:24:54,710 --> 01:24:56,619
If you watch carefully as you cross the road,

2169
01:24:56,620 --> 01:24:58,080
you'll see many people do this.

2170
01:24:59,490 --> 01:25:00,850
I can see the pyramid right in front of us.

2171
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:01,950
My goodness.

2172
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:04,419
- It's very tall.
- It's huge.

2173
01:25:04,420 --> 01:25:05,420
(They arrive at the pyramid.)

2174
01:25:05,830 --> 01:25:09,060
Here, you can wear your clothes since it's hot.

2175
01:25:09,130 --> 01:25:11,500
But you can wear a hat if you want.

2176
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:12,869
- I brought many.
- Let's wear it.

2177
01:25:12,870 --> 01:25:14,270
I think we can wear it...

2178
01:25:15,070 --> 01:25:16,939
over the cap.

2179
01:25:16,940 --> 01:25:18,300
- Is it okay?
- Like this.

2180
01:25:18,540 --> 01:25:19,570
It's cute.

2181
01:25:20,510 --> 01:25:22,040
Let's wear it here. What do you think?

2182
01:25:22,210 --> 01:25:24,479
- Okay.
- Like we said earlier,

2183
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:27,410
we can't film here.

2184
01:25:27,580 --> 01:25:31,250
Who is the cameraman in charge of inserts and gaze shots?

2185
01:25:31,380 --> 01:25:32,449
Me.

2186
01:25:32,450 --> 01:25:33,590
(Historical site cameraman, Kwang Soo)

2187
01:25:33,820 --> 01:25:35,749
- You're in charge of faces.
- I'm in charge of faces.

2188
01:25:35,750 --> 01:25:36,890
(Facial cameraman, Woo Bin)

2189
01:25:37,060 --> 01:25:38,220
Here...

2190
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:39,990
- Test it.
- I'll test it.

2191
01:25:41,030 --> 01:25:42,030
It doesn't have to be a three-person shot.

2192
01:25:42,031 --> 01:25:43,929
Make sure you press "Record."

2193
01:25:43,930 --> 01:25:45,329
- Okay.
- If you go, "I didn't press it,"

2194
01:25:45,330 --> 01:25:46,400
it'll be a disaster.

2195
01:25:47,170 --> 01:25:48,830
We need to stand close...

2196
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:50,640
for a three-person shot.

2197
01:25:50,740 --> 01:25:52,039
But who...

2198
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:54,270
- From here...
- Who goes on a tour like this?

2199
01:25:54,570 --> 01:25:56,809
(Extremely close)

2200
01:25:56,810 --> 01:25:58,039
(Woo Bin's camera)

2201
01:25:58,040 --> 01:25:59,449
From here, I'll zoom in.

2202
01:25:59,450 --> 01:26:01,410
I'll get Kwang Soo's reaction.

2203
01:26:01,650 --> 01:26:03,850
My goodness. Tell me before you zoom in.

2204
01:26:04,020 --> 01:26:05,050
Why?

2205
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:06,990
Tell me that you're going to zoom in.

2206
01:26:07,450 --> 01:26:08,549
Kwang Soo, here I go.

2207
01:26:08,550 --> 01:26:09,859
(Woo Bin's camera)

2208
01:26:09,860 --> 01:26:10,919
My goodness.

2209
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:12,259
I'll react after you zoom in.

2210
01:26:12,260 --> 01:26:13,829
(My goodness)

2211
01:26:13,830 --> 01:26:14,990
It's already funny.

2212
01:26:16,430 --> 01:26:18,199
(The cameraman is highly satisfied.)

2213
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:19,200
All done.

2214
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:21,129
We'll be back.

2215
01:26:21,130 --> 01:26:22,329
- Bye.
- Bye.

2216
01:26:22,330 --> 01:26:23,639
(Pyramid walking tour)

2217
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:24,940
I feel a bit sad.

2218
01:26:25,910 --> 01:26:28,470
(They'll film themselves from now on.)

2219
01:26:29,010 --> 01:26:31,740
(The facial cameraman's camera is on.)

2220
01:26:31,810 --> 01:26:34,750
(The screen may shake due to self-filming.)

2221
01:26:35,250 --> 01:26:37,880
(The historical site cameraman gets to work as well.)

2222
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:41,819
This historical site is called Teotihuacan.

2223
01:26:41,820 --> 01:26:43,090
- Teotihuacan.
- Yes.

2224
01:26:43,220 --> 01:26:45,359
Now that we're seeing it in real life...

2225
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:47,530
- It's huge.
- It's huge.

2226
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:49,529
It'll be overwhelming to hold a ceremony here.

2227
01:26:49,530 --> 01:26:51,330
- It looks fake.
- I know.

2228
01:26:51,530 --> 01:26:52,770
- It's like a photoshopped image.
- I know.

2229
01:26:53,530 --> 01:26:54,530
Thank you.

2230
01:26:55,330 --> 01:26:58,940
(He uses the hand gesture right away.)

2231
01:27:00,140 --> 01:27:01,210
You know,

2232
01:27:01,770 --> 01:27:03,240
even as I raised my hand,

2233
01:27:03,940 --> 01:27:05,339
I was scared that it'd be taken...

2234
01:27:05,340 --> 01:27:07,180
- as an insult.
- They might misunderstand.

2235
01:27:08,550 --> 01:27:12,320
(Please don't misunderstand. They're expressing gratitude.)

2236
01:27:12,450 --> 01:27:14,189
- It's so cool.
- Seriously.

2237
01:27:14,190 --> 01:27:15,350
My goodness.

2238
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:17,820
(Woo Bin exclaims and Kyung Soo gasps.)

2239
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:19,829
This place must be visited.

2240
01:27:19,830 --> 01:27:20,859
I know.

2241
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:24,030
(How does the ancient city, Teotihuacan look?)

2242
01:27:24,430 --> 01:27:25,630
It's so fascinating.

2243
01:27:26,070 --> 01:27:28,470
Teotihuacan means "City of the deities..."

2244
01:27:28,570 --> 01:27:31,170
in the native language.

2245
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:33,569
At its prime, which was around the 3rd to 4th century,

2246
01:27:33,570 --> 01:27:35,170
up to 200,000 people lived here.

2247
01:27:35,510 --> 01:27:38,610
- Since it was a huge city, - Right.

2248
01:27:38,740 --> 01:27:42,010
archaeologists describe Teotihuacan as a civilization.

2249
01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:46,120
Let me give you an explanation on the historical site.

2250
01:27:46,220 --> 01:27:48,419
The name Teotihuacan,

2251
01:27:48,420 --> 01:27:50,320
- firstly...
- What's that sound?

2252
01:27:50,890 --> 01:27:52,860
The souvenir sellers...

2253
01:27:53,090 --> 01:27:54,930
are using a whistle.

2254
01:27:54,990 --> 01:27:56,800
There are whistles that make jaguar sounds...

2255
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:58,800
and human screams.

2256
01:27:59,130 --> 01:28:01,199
- Those weren't actual screams.
- No.

2257
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:04,170
There make jaguar sounds, animal sounds, and human screams.

2258
01:28:04,340 --> 01:28:05,869
- They sell all kinds.
- Kwang Soo,

2259
01:28:05,870 --> 01:28:06,969
- can we buy one?
- What you're hearing...

2260
01:28:06,970 --> 01:28:08,039
- are human screams.
- Let's buy one.

2261
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:09,679
- It's too scary.
- One that makes human screams.

2262
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:11,440
(They already want a whistle.)

2263
01:28:11,540 --> 01:28:12,950
I want to use it when Kwang Soo is asleep.

2264
01:28:14,010 --> 01:28:15,949
The whistles that make human screams...

2265
01:28:15,950 --> 01:28:17,820
were used during warfare back in the Aztec era.

2266
01:28:18,150 --> 01:28:19,449
People in the front row...

2267
01:28:19,450 --> 01:28:21,220
played those whistles as they moved forward.

2268
01:28:21,350 --> 01:28:23,320
- It was psychological warfare.
- That was the strongest whistle.

2269
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:25,860
- They scare the enemies.
- That's right.

2270
01:28:26,030 --> 01:28:27,629
- Eagle.
- I just heard a phoenix sound.

2271
01:28:27,630 --> 01:28:30,029
Yes. Let's get closer to the Pyramid of the Sun.

2272
01:28:30,030 --> 01:28:31,299
- Is that the Pyramid of the Sun?
- Yes.

2273
01:28:31,300 --> 01:28:32,670
Then we'll go over there.

2274
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:37,570
- How did people make it?
- My goodness.

2275
01:28:39,770 --> 01:28:41,569
(They see the Pyramid of the Sun up close.)

2276
01:28:41,570 --> 01:28:43,080
It's so cool.

2277
01:28:43,740 --> 01:28:45,480
I can't capture it with a camera.

2278
01:28:46,010 --> 01:28:48,810
This pyramid is 63m tall.

2279
01:28:48,950 --> 01:28:51,420
It's as tall as a 20-story apartment.

2280
01:28:51,780 --> 01:28:54,290
It's a very old pyramid with 2,000 years of history.

2281
01:28:55,250 --> 01:28:57,789
It feels different to see it up close.

2282
01:28:57,790 --> 01:28:58,859
- It feels different.
- Yes.

2283
01:28:58,860 --> 01:29:00,459
- Now that we're up close, - I mean...

2284
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:01,660
it's more overwhelming.

2285
01:29:01,860 --> 01:29:04,059
The pyramids in Egypt weren't made with rocks.

2286
01:29:04,060 --> 01:29:05,429
That's right. They were made...

2287
01:29:05,430 --> 01:29:06,769
- with big bricks.
- Bricks.

2288
01:29:06,770 --> 01:29:09,970
For this pyramid, rocks of different shapes were gathered...

2289
01:29:10,340 --> 01:29:13,139
and put together with lime plaster.

2290
01:29:13,140 --> 01:29:14,709
The rocks were secured...

2291
01:29:14,710 --> 01:29:16,139
- to build...
- That's why...

2292
01:29:16,140 --> 01:29:17,640
- this pyramid.
- there are rocks.

2293
01:29:17,780 --> 01:29:18,939
Here's the scary thing.

2294
01:29:18,940 --> 01:29:22,010
There were no horses and cows back then.

2295
01:29:22,610 --> 01:29:24,879
- Then...
- There were no wagons with wheels.

2296
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:26,489
- Did people do this?
- Yes, people...

2297
01:29:26,490 --> 01:29:28,290
- They carried the rocks.
- moved the rocks here.

2298
01:29:28,690 --> 01:29:31,059
Do you know how much stone was used....

2299
01:29:31,060 --> 01:29:33,390
to make the Pyramid of the Sun?

2300
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:35,829
A total of 2.5 million tons of stone was used.

2301
01:29:35,830 --> 01:29:37,099
People did all the work.

2302
01:29:37,100 --> 01:29:39,569
- People moved them.
- I can't get a sense...

2303
01:29:39,570 --> 01:29:41,469
- of 2.5 million tons of stone.
- I know.

2304
01:29:41,470 --> 01:29:43,569
Even a huge truck...

2305
01:29:43,570 --> 01:29:44,939
carries 8t or 10t.

2306
01:29:44,940 --> 01:29:46,109
- Right.
- You said 2.5 million tons.

2307
01:29:46,110 --> 01:29:48,240
Yes. This pyramid used 2.5 million tons of stone.

2308
01:29:48,570 --> 01:29:50,980
The three of us should go, "I see," as a reaction.

2309
01:29:51,510 --> 01:29:52,580
Set, go.

2310
01:29:52,710 --> 01:29:54,210
- I see.
- I see.

2311
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:56,920
- Let's go, "Gosh!" - Okay.

2312
01:29:57,220 --> 01:29:58,279
One, two, three.

2313
01:29:58,280 --> 01:29:59,450
- Gosh!
- Gosh!

2314
01:29:59,650 --> 01:30:01,089
(Woo Bin chuckles.)

2315
01:30:01,090 --> 01:30:03,160
(He's satisfied with the actors' performance.)

2316
01:30:03,260 --> 01:30:06,389
I don't know if you've heard of obsidian.

2317
01:30:06,390 --> 01:30:08,329
- It's black volcanic rock.
- I think I've heard of it.

2318
01:30:08,330 --> 01:30:09,830
It's shiny.

2319
01:30:09,930 --> 01:30:11,999
It's a rock that breaks easily.

2320
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,669
The broken side is...

2321
01:30:13,670 --> 01:30:15,730
as sharp as a scalpel.

2322
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,570
Back in the day, that rock was only available in this region.

2323
01:30:17,740 --> 01:30:20,569
Using obsidian, residents of Teotihuacan made weapons...

2324
01:30:20,570 --> 01:30:22,710
and had a big influence in the neighboring areas.

2325
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:25,779
It's obsidian!

2326
01:30:25,780 --> 01:30:27,450
Yes, that black rock is obsidian.

2327
01:30:28,710 --> 01:30:30,219
It's very shiny.

2328
01:30:30,220 --> 01:30:31,919
(It's very shiny.)

2329
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:33,419
- It was used to draw blood.
- Yes.

2330
01:30:33,420 --> 01:30:35,349
In movies,

2331
01:30:35,350 --> 01:30:37,359
they take out the heart.

2332
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:38,859
An obsidian knife is used in such scenes.

2333
01:30:38,860 --> 01:30:40,930
(Kwang Soo's camera)

2334
01:30:41,460 --> 01:30:43,460
(Kwang Soo's camera goes off.)

2335
01:30:43,930 --> 01:30:45,229
(Kwang Soo's camera goes off.)

2336
01:30:45,230 --> 01:30:48,600
(Kwang Soo turns off the camera after filming.)

2337
01:30:49,300 --> 01:30:50,839
We'll go out that way...

2338
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:52,669
- and visit other places.
- Okay.

2339
01:30:52,670 --> 01:30:53,810
(He turns off the camera as always.)

2340
01:30:53,910 --> 01:30:56,110
Don't turn it off each time.

2341
01:30:56,510 --> 01:30:58,080
It's better to keep it running.

2342
01:30:58,580 --> 01:30:59,949
(The production crew is worried about self-filming.)

2343
01:30:59,950 --> 01:31:01,410
Woo Bin keeps the camera running.

2344
01:31:01,910 --> 01:31:03,520
But I need to check out the place.

2345
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:07,020
(Kwang Soo is quiet.)

2346
01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:10,220
I can't do this tour. Seriously.

2347
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:13,289
I want to see the place with my own eyes.

2348
01:31:13,290 --> 01:31:14,290
I keep seeing it on the screen.

2349
01:31:14,291 --> 01:31:16,029
A person looks that small on the top.

2350
01:31:16,030 --> 01:31:17,099
My goodness.

2351
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:18,100
Hello.

2352
01:31:18,630 --> 01:31:21,270
(He goes back to being a cameraman.)

2353
01:31:21,470 --> 01:31:22,600
I guess he can't hear me.

2354
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:24,569
Maybe he can hear you very well.

2355
01:31:24,570 --> 01:31:25,640
(Maybe he can hear you very well.)

2356
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:27,910
(Cheering)

2357
01:31:28,470 --> 01:31:30,709
(They get a responding wave,)

2358
01:31:30,710 --> 01:31:32,910
(but Kwang Soo fails to film it after zooming in incorrectly.)

2359
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:34,779
- Over there.
- Stand in the middle...

2360
01:31:34,780 --> 01:31:36,320
- and look to both sides.
- It's very cool.

2361
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:39,350
This road is called...

2362
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:41,449
the Avenue of the Dead.

2363
01:31:41,450 --> 01:31:42,450
This road?

2364
01:31:42,451 --> 01:31:44,320
It's called the Avenue of the Dead.

2365
01:31:44,490 --> 01:31:46,790
The reason is a bit unique.

2366
01:31:47,190 --> 01:31:48,890
- There's the Day of the Dead too.
- Yes.

2367
01:31:48,930 --> 01:31:51,930
In the Aztec era, that pyramid was mainly used.

2368
01:31:52,130 --> 01:31:53,869
By "Mainly used,"

2369
01:31:53,870 --> 01:31:55,299
I mean that they had rituals there.

2370
01:31:55,300 --> 01:31:56,870
Those rituals involved a sacrifice.

2371
01:31:57,370 --> 01:31:59,199
- A human sacrifice?
- Yes.

2372
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:01,169
So when you walked down this path,

2373
01:32:01,170 --> 01:32:03,309
death awaited you.

2374
01:32:03,310 --> 01:32:06,010
That was how it got the name of the Avenue of the Dead.

2375
01:32:07,150 --> 01:32:08,479
You know, for real...

2376
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:10,020
So many people...

2377
01:32:10,250 --> 01:32:11,479
- got sacrificed.
- I know.

2378
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:12,949
People who got sacrificed for the rituals...

2379
01:32:12,950 --> 01:32:14,749
believed that they'd become a part of the deities.

2380
01:32:14,750 --> 01:32:18,019
So one of the priests...

2381
01:32:18,020 --> 01:32:20,960
or one of the brave warriors got sacrificed.

2382
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:23,230
According to the Spanish records,

2383
01:32:23,300 --> 01:32:25,299
about 50,000 to 80,000 people...

2384
01:32:25,300 --> 01:32:27,000
were sacrificed.

2385
01:32:27,030 --> 01:32:28,569
If we convert the time,

2386
01:32:28,570 --> 01:32:30,500
it means they killed 1 person every 10 minutes.

2387
01:32:30,670 --> 01:32:32,299
It's true...

2388
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:35,269
that many people were sacrificed later on.

2389
01:32:35,270 --> 01:32:38,380
But it wasn't always like that.

2390
01:32:38,510 --> 01:32:40,309
That's the origin...

2391
01:32:40,310 --> 01:32:43,320
of the name, the Avenue of the Dead.

2392
01:32:44,350 --> 01:32:46,920
Let's go this way and see the pyramid up close.

2393
01:32:47,190 --> 01:32:49,889
It's an epic poem that includes...

2394
01:32:49,890 --> 01:32:52,690
the era we live in, the fifth era.

2395
01:32:52,790 --> 01:32:54,790
I can't stand it. I must buy that whistle.

2396
01:32:55,690 --> 01:32:59,060
(It has caught CEO Lee's attention for a while.)

2397
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:02,669
(Aztec whistle)

2398
01:33:02,670 --> 01:33:03,839
(Kwang Soo's camera)

2399
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:05,440
- Hello.
- Hello.

2400
01:33:06,540 --> 01:33:08,370
That makes the jaguar sound.

2401
01:33:08,610 --> 01:33:09,679
(Roaring)

2402
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:11,510
(Kwang Soo is impressed.)

2403
01:33:12,580 --> 01:33:14,149
(Screeching)

2404
01:33:14,150 --> 01:33:15,310
Eagle.

2405
01:33:16,850 --> 01:33:19,019
(He gets a jaguar whistle.)

2406
01:33:19,020 --> 01:33:20,449
(Wind sound)

2407
01:33:20,450 --> 01:33:22,689
The performer is important.

2408
01:33:22,690 --> 01:33:24,059
You need to cover it well...

2409
01:33:24,060 --> 01:33:25,390
and control the volume.

2410
01:33:26,060 --> 01:33:27,160
My goodness!

2411
01:33:27,260 --> 01:33:28,589
(Roaring)

2412
01:33:28,590 --> 01:33:30,499
(Kwang Soo Jaguar learns how to roar.)

2413
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:32,359
(Roaring)

2414
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:35,329
(Going all out)

2415
01:33:35,330 --> 01:33:37,569
He initially asked for 300 pesos,

2416
01:33:37,570 --> 01:33:39,770
but he'll give it for 200 pesos since you guys are from Korea.

2417
01:33:40,670 --> 01:33:41,770
Shall we get one?

2418
01:33:41,910 --> 01:33:43,140
Can you resist buying one?

2419
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:44,910
How about the one that makes human screams?

2420
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:47,880
(He plays the whistle that makes human screams.)

2421
01:33:49,180 --> 01:33:50,480
Can you resist buying one?

2422
01:33:51,580 --> 01:33:52,649
(In the end, they get a jaguar whistle.)

2423
01:33:52,650 --> 01:33:54,320
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2424
01:33:54,450 --> 01:33:55,920
The pouch is pretty too.

2425
01:33:57,060 --> 01:33:58,619
(Roaring)

2426
01:33:58,620 --> 01:34:00,090
(He's the happiest.)

2427
01:34:01,630 --> 01:34:03,660
(Roaring)

2428
01:34:06,730 --> 01:34:07,899
All right.

2429
01:34:07,900 --> 01:34:09,099
(Roaring)

2430
01:34:09,100 --> 01:34:11,740
(He's like a Mexican elementary schooler.)

2431
01:34:12,570 --> 01:34:14,770
He really seems like an elementary schooler.

2432
01:34:15,340 --> 01:34:18,139
Back in the day, I bought the same whistle.

2433
01:34:18,140 --> 01:34:20,409
My mom slapped my back for playing it in the house.

2434
01:34:20,410 --> 01:34:21,610
You deserved that slap.

2435
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:24,579
(Roaring)

2436
01:34:24,580 --> 01:34:26,890
(Kwang Soo's back is in danger.)

2437
01:34:27,090 --> 01:34:29,719
In the Aztec religion, a jaguar was...

2438
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:31,220
a sacred animal.

2439
01:34:31,460 --> 01:34:33,890
It worked as a messenger of the deities...

2440
01:34:33,990 --> 01:34:36,230
and protected the nobles.

2441
01:34:36,330 --> 01:34:38,030
It was an important animal.

2442
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:39,929
That was why...

2443
01:34:39,930 --> 01:34:42,029
these souvenirs were made.

2444
01:34:42,030 --> 01:34:43,100
(Kwang Soo gets slapped in the back.)

2445
01:34:43,170 --> 01:34:45,269
We'll visit this place once.

2446
01:34:45,270 --> 01:34:46,410
(Roaring)

2447
01:34:47,910 --> 01:34:49,170
That meant, "Okay."

2448
01:34:51,110 --> 01:34:53,749
- What? These are new.
- I know.

2449
01:34:53,750 --> 01:34:54,950
These are my style.

2450
01:34:55,450 --> 01:34:56,579
Gemstone rings.

2451
01:34:56,580 --> 01:34:58,050
(He finds a ring store that suits his taste.)

2452
01:34:58,180 --> 01:34:59,989
Kyung Soo, since you lost your friendship bracelet,

2453
01:34:59,990 --> 01:35:01,490
you should get something here.

2454
01:35:03,790 --> 01:35:05,359
We need to buy one too.

2455
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:06,390
Seriously.

2456
01:35:06,460 --> 01:35:08,130
Shall we get an obsidian ring?

2457
01:35:08,660 --> 01:35:09,759
That one is pretty.

2458
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:11,660
(The black obsidian ring is simple.)

2459
01:35:11,900 --> 01:35:13,030
This one is nice.

2460
01:35:13,570 --> 01:35:14,700
Is that obsidian?

2461
01:35:14,900 --> 01:35:17,000
You shouldn't get a fancy one by yourself.

2462
01:35:18,770 --> 01:35:20,269
(Intimidating roar)

2463
01:35:20,270 --> 01:35:21,539
(Kwang Soo tells him to read the room.)

2464
01:35:21,540 --> 01:35:22,870
Show me the earlier one.

2465
01:35:24,310 --> 01:35:25,779
- Shall we get this one?
- Okay.

2466
01:35:25,780 --> 01:35:27,350
(They get an obsidian ring.)

2467
01:35:27,980 --> 01:35:29,950
Can he give us a discount if we get three?

2468
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:34,790
The total is 500 pesos.

2469
01:35:35,350 --> 01:35:37,590
(Thank you.)

2470
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:41,130
Living here in Mexico made me realize...

2471
01:35:41,990 --> 01:35:44,859
that discounts are rarer than I expected.

2472
01:35:44,860 --> 01:35:46,930
- Really?
- Yes. It feels like...

2473
01:35:47,470 --> 01:35:48,729
I received...

2474
01:35:48,730 --> 01:35:50,540
- a lot of discounts here.
- Okay.

2475
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:52,140
- Let me tell you what to do.
- Okay.

2476
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:54,870
In a serious and polite way,

2477
01:35:55,170 --> 01:35:56,370
say, "Please..."

2478
01:35:56,480 --> 01:35:57,810
"give me a discount."

2479
01:35:58,240 --> 01:35:59,980
When I said that,

2480
01:36:00,050 --> 01:36:01,149
they gave me a discount right away.

2481
01:36:01,150 --> 01:36:02,310
- Is that so?
- Yes.

2482
01:36:02,380 --> 01:36:03,549
Don't you think...

2483
01:36:03,550 --> 01:36:05,320
it's the difference in appearances?

2484
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:07,989
- It's sincerity.
- Sincerity.

2485
01:36:07,990 --> 01:36:09,520
"I really don't have much money."

2486
01:36:09,750 --> 01:36:11,419
"But I really want to buy this item."

2487
01:36:11,420 --> 01:36:12,960
You need to have that vibe.

2488
01:36:13,330 --> 01:36:15,459
We're getting closer...

2489
01:36:15,460 --> 01:36:17,560
to the Pyramid of the Moon.

2490
01:36:17,660 --> 01:36:19,599
The Pyramid of the Moon...

2491
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:22,170
is much smaller than the Pyramid of the Sun.

2492
01:36:22,330 --> 01:36:25,669
It was made about 150 years later...

2493
01:36:25,670 --> 01:36:28,110
than the Pyramid of the Sun.

2494
01:36:28,910 --> 01:36:30,480
Let's film, "I see."

2495
01:36:31,310 --> 01:36:32,609
One, two, three.

2496
01:36:32,610 --> 01:36:33,810
(I see.)

2497
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:38,879
We should be very careful.

2498
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:40,949
We'll go up the pyramid. As you can see,

2499
01:36:40,950 --> 01:36:44,619
each stair is very tall and narrow.

2500
01:36:44,620 --> 01:36:46,789
You need to be careful when you go up.

2501
01:36:46,790 --> 01:36:49,729
(Kwang Soo's camera)

2502
01:36:49,730 --> 01:36:52,229
If you want to hold the rope,

2503
01:36:52,230 --> 01:36:53,670
- please go ahead.
- I'll go up.

2504
01:36:54,170 --> 01:36:56,070
If you think you'll be okay, please go up slowly.

2505
01:36:56,740 --> 01:36:59,070
Since we're at high altitude,

2506
01:36:59,340 --> 01:37:02,509
strenuous exercise can be hard on the body.

2507
01:37:02,510 --> 01:37:03,639
Okay.

2508
01:37:03,640 --> 01:37:05,440
(Okay.)

2509
01:37:06,850 --> 01:37:07,979
(The stairs are taller than they expected.)

2510
01:37:07,980 --> 01:37:09,080
They're so tall.

2511
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:13,619
(Their speed drops dramatically.)

2512
01:37:13,620 --> 01:37:14,790
(Woo Bin sighs.)

2513
01:37:15,350 --> 01:37:18,519
(Woo Bin gasps.)

2514
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:19,620
(Kwang Soo exclaims.)

2515
01:37:19,690 --> 01:37:21,789
(Panting)

2516
01:37:21,790 --> 01:37:22,930
It's exhausting.

2517
01:37:23,430 --> 01:37:24,499
Definitely.

2518
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:25,860
(It's hard on the older members.)

2519
01:37:25,900 --> 01:37:27,399
This is where they had the rituals.

2520
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:28,700
They had the rituals up there.

2521
01:37:29,230 --> 01:37:31,039
This is the furthest we can go.

2522
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:32,140
(They see the altar when they reach the top.)

2523
01:37:32,440 --> 01:37:33,840
Kwang Soo, look over there.

2524
01:37:35,010 --> 01:37:36,610
We can see everything clearly.

2525
01:37:37,110 --> 01:37:39,839
It makes us imagine how it looked...

2526
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:41,180
in the past.

2527
01:37:41,750 --> 01:37:43,110
Back in school,

2528
01:37:43,620 --> 01:37:45,019
we thought teachers wouldn't see us from the lectern.

2529
01:37:45,020 --> 01:37:46,149
But they saw everything clearly.

2530
01:37:46,150 --> 01:37:47,520
- That's right.
- Likewise,

2531
01:37:47,590 --> 01:37:48,720
I can see everything clearly from here.

2532
01:37:48,750 --> 01:37:50,259
Teachers knew right away if we did something else.

2533
01:37:50,260 --> 01:37:51,759
I bet they could see things clearly.

2534
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:52,790
(Teachers of the past would agree.)

2535
01:37:53,330 --> 01:37:55,790
Hey, Kyung Soo!

2536
01:37:55,930 --> 01:37:57,900
- There's a step underneath.
- Don't do that.

2537
01:37:57,960 --> 01:37:59,969
(Is Kyung Soo sitting on a cliff?)

2538
01:37:59,970 --> 01:38:01,969
There's a step underneath.

2539
01:38:01,970 --> 01:38:03,029
(Thankfully, there's a step right underneath.)

2540
01:38:03,030 --> 01:38:04,200
A step.

2541
01:38:05,300 --> 01:38:07,070
It looks so dangerous.

2542
01:38:08,470 --> 01:38:10,440
(I agree.)

2543
01:38:12,110 --> 01:38:13,979
(The pyramid photo that became a poster)

2544
01:38:13,980 --> 01:38:15,080
All done.

2545
01:38:15,450 --> 01:38:16,580
Let's go.

2546
01:38:17,480 --> 01:38:18,880
I haven't caught my breath yet.

2547
01:38:20,550 --> 01:38:21,849
Kwang Soo, we should be careful.

2548
01:38:21,850 --> 01:38:23,319
- When you go down...
- We should be careful.

2549
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:25,119
Instead of taking the stairs...

2550
01:38:25,120 --> 01:38:26,759
Put down the cellphones for a moment.

2551
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:28,129
Put them down.

2552
01:38:28,130 --> 01:38:29,229
(For safety, they don't film on their way down.)

2553
01:38:29,230 --> 01:38:31,129
Like this, hold the rope.

2554
01:38:31,130 --> 01:38:33,769
(How was the pyramid?)

2555
01:38:33,770 --> 01:38:35,470
Information about the Aztec era...

2556
01:38:35,900 --> 01:38:38,800
is in my life now.

2557
01:38:39,140 --> 01:38:40,910
It entered my brain.

2558
01:38:41,270 --> 01:38:43,680
I didn't know that Mexico was like this.

2559
01:38:44,180 --> 01:38:45,439
It seems like...

2560
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:46,780
a very nice country.

2561
01:38:47,580 --> 01:38:50,379
(What did you learn?)

2562
01:38:50,380 --> 01:38:52,450
Firstly, this site...

2563
01:38:53,390 --> 01:38:56,019
got included in UNESCO's

2564
01:38:56,020 --> 01:38:58,860
World Heritage Site List in 1987.

2565
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:02,030
There are the Pyramid of the Sun and the Pyramid of the Moon.

2566
01:39:02,090 --> 01:39:03,559
If you look at the Pyramid of the Sun,

2567
01:39:03,560 --> 01:39:06,229
there are five platforms.

2568
01:39:06,230 --> 01:39:07,770
Those things...

2569
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:09,700
The name is...

2570
01:39:09,930 --> 01:39:11,540
something about the dead.

2571
01:39:12,170 --> 01:39:13,309
Castle of the Dead?

2572
01:39:13,310 --> 01:39:14,540
Something about the dead.

2573
01:39:14,910 --> 01:39:16,140
Water of the Dead?

2574
01:39:16,710 --> 01:39:18,480
What was it? Something about the dead.

2575
01:39:19,640 --> 01:39:21,109
Priest of the Dead?

2576
01:39:21,110 --> 01:39:22,209
(CEO Lee gets stuck from the beginning.)

2577
01:39:22,210 --> 01:39:23,250
What was it?

2578
01:39:23,980 --> 01:39:25,919
(CEO Ko will be disappointed.)

2579
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:27,289
It's just that the information isn't organized in my head.

2580
01:39:27,290 --> 01:39:28,390
Well...

2581
01:39:29,350 --> 01:39:30,590
Biotite?

2582
01:39:31,620 --> 01:39:32,760
What was it?

2583
01:39:34,060 --> 01:39:35,660
What was that black rock?

2584
01:39:36,060 --> 01:39:37,159
- I think...
- Kyung Soo,

2585
01:39:37,160 --> 01:39:38,629
what was the black rock?

2586
01:39:38,630 --> 01:39:40,169
- Obsidian.
- Obsidian.

2587
01:39:40,170 --> 01:39:41,170
See?

2588
01:39:41,171 --> 01:39:43,230
- He doesn't remember anything.
- Obsidian.

2589
01:39:43,870 --> 01:39:45,939
Obsidian came from this area.

2590
01:39:45,940 --> 01:39:49,040
- Using obsidian, they made weapons.
- Kwang Soo.

2591
01:39:49,070 --> 01:39:51,780
How many tons of rock were used for this pyramid?

2592
01:39:52,180 --> 01:39:53,580
The answer is 2.5 million tons.

2593
01:39:55,480 --> 01:39:57,250
Is it 2.5 million tons or not?

2594
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:03,589
If you do it like that...

2595
01:40:03,590 --> 01:40:05,090
It seems to have a different meaning.

2596
01:40:05,490 --> 01:40:07,960
(The hand gesture of gratitude is aggravating for some reason.)

2597
01:40:09,690 --> 01:40:11,900
(Kyung Soo laughs.)

2598
01:40:13,930 --> 01:40:15,430
He remembers everything.

2599
01:40:16,170 --> 01:40:17,399
He's good.

2600
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:19,870
(The expedition is peaceful as always.)

2601
01:40:20,670 --> 01:40:22,840
(They enjoy their afternoon after the fast-paced tour.)

2602

(The expedition decides to enjoy themselves with madness.)

2604
01:40:28,210 --> 01:40:30,280
(Thus, they begin to use money without restraint.)

2605
01:40:31,980 --> 01:40:33,720
(They shop as much as they want.)

2606
01:40:34,150 --> 01:40:36,190
(They eat as much as they want.)

2607
01:40:36,250 --> 01:40:37,659
Nando, have one.

2608
01:40:37,660 --> 01:40:39,760
(They even pay for someone else.)

2609
01:40:40,090 --> 01:40:41,589
(As a result of the splurge)

2610
01:40:41,590 --> 01:40:44,600
(The flight tickets to Cancun cost 1,702.50 dollars.)

2611
01:40:44,700 --> 01:40:46,699
We might go back to Korea early.

2612
01:40:46,700 --> 01:40:48,300
(Have the funds become insufficient?)

2613
01:40:48,470 --> 01:40:50,639
(To make matters worse)

2614
01:40:50,640 --> 01:40:52,169
(You booked 20, which is twice the needed amount.)

2615
01:40:52,170 --> 01:40:53,340
(What?)

2616
01:40:53,640 --> 01:40:56,070
(The auditor's unexpected mistake with the reservation)

2617
01:40:56,910 --> 01:40:58,910
(They let go of their pride and ask for help in the end.)

2618
01:40:59,510 --> 01:41:01,080
(We won't listen.)

2619

01:41:02,380 --> 01:41:04,620
(We never said that!)

2621
01:41:05,180 --> 01:41:07,390
(It only worsens the rift between them and the head office.)

2623
01:41:09,050 --> 01:41:10,660
(beggars now.)

2624
01:41:10,690 --> 01:41:12,790
(We're poor.)

2625
01:41:12,920 --> 01:41:14,390
- We're poor.
- We...

2626
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:18,860
(What will become of the broke expedition?)

2627
01:41:20,430 --> 01:41:21,470
It's tasty.
