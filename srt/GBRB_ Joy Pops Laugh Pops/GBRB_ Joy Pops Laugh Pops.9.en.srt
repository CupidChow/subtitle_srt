18
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:02,889
I'm really going to do it.

It's sunny today.

29
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,309
We should've enjoyed snorkelling.

30
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:30,156

- Do you have your passport?
- We have our passports.

40
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:50,970
- You have all of them, right?
- Yes.

41
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,170
I got scared for real.

42
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,709

Gosh, he stands out.

51
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,890
He looks like a fighter.

52
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,360
You have...

53
00:02:16,361 --> 00:02:17,830
Dwayne Johnson's facial expression.

54
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,530
Seriously.

55
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,330
What's up with my face?

56
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,569
Aren't you cowering too much?

57
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:24,869
You look intimidated.

58
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,999

- Since we've come here once, - Right?

64
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,780
We're used to the place.

65
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,620
- My heart is at ease.
- Yes.

(They pick up the car they left the day before.)

67

70
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,540
- It got hotter while we were away.
- I know.

71
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,840
The tacos will be delicious.

72
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,210
Woo Bin, I'm sorry, but can you hurry up?

73
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,850
(CEO Lee is hungry.)

74
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,680
(Thank you.)

75
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,680
- When I do this, they nod.
- Yes.

76
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,850
I feel like we'll do this in Korea as well.

77
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,359
It comes so naturally.

78
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,520
(The Mexican way of saying thank you comes naturally.)

79
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,790
I think it's on our right.

80
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,129
(They arrive at the taco place.)

81
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,200
It's like the place we visited.

82
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,670
The tasty place.

83
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,040
- Hello.
- Hello.

84
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,570
Is this the place?

85
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,370
- Hello.
- Hello. What can I get for you?

86
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,879
- There are burritos.
- We got...

87
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,180
We got tacos.

88
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,320
- There are quesadillas.
- Torta is a Mexican sandwich.

89
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,620
- I'll eat gringas.
- Gringas.

90
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,249
- Is it tasty?
- Okay. Gringas is...

91
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,690
- Flour.
- Okay.

92
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,390
Shall we try it?

93
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,310
- Gringas.
- Shall all of us order gringas?

94
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,189
One beef...

95
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,889
and three tripes.

96
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:57,959
(Oh!)

97
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,759
(What was this?)

98
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,169
- Two.
- Two.

99
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,299
- Two tripes.
- Two tripes.

100
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,600
Two tripes.

101
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,500
No tacos?

102
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,239
Let's order one. It's our last day.

103
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,240
Let's eat a piece each. We'll get three pieces.

104
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,580
Tacos.

105
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,510
Three.

106
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,309
No. We get 3 pieces for 1 order, right?

107
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,949
- Three. One, two, three.
- Okay.

108
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,149
- Three.
- What kind?

109
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,990
- You can mix...
- Mix.

110
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,320
- I asked him to mix everything.
- Yes.

111
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,690
Okay.

112
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,990
Three tacos.

113
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,960
Suadero is this one.

114
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,830

115
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,300
Barbacoa is this one.

116
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,130
- Yes.
- My favourite.

117
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,330
Yes.

118
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,700
- Mine too.
- Okay. There you go.

119
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,100
It looks so tasty.

120
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,970
(A blanket of cheese gets laid down.)

121
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,139
(Tripes go on the top.)

122
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,449
(Then another big-sized tortilla goes on the top.)

123
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:52,620
(Each side gets toasted until it turns golden nicely.)

124
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,319
It's ready.

125
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,890
- It looks so tasty.
- What is that?

126
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,330
That's gringas.

127
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,530
Is that one serving?

128
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,230
I think so.

129
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,799
- Thank you for the food. Enjoy it.
- Enjoy it.

130
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,930
Enjoy the food.

131
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,439
(It's their last meal in Mexico.)

132
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,699
Okay. Salsa.

133
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,180
- It's hot.
- Do you know what it is?

134
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,309
It's so hot.

135
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,569
This is our spiciest one.

136
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,079
- This one is sweeter.
- It's tasty.

137
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,710
- It's tasty.
- It isn't as spicy.

138
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,149
- Yes.
- It's so tasty.

139
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,150
It's totally different.

140
00:05:23,151 --> 00:05:25,479
You can have some rice or anything to...

141
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,979
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

142
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:30,150
Okay. If you finish the whole thing, we'll bring more.

143
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,360
Okay.

144
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,320
It's very tasty.

145
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,930
(Highly satisfied)

146
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,100
My goodness.

147
00:05:40,101 --> 00:05:41,469
It suits our taste.

148
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:43,130
(They keep exclaiming since it's tasty.)

149
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,230
Delicious.

150
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,980
It's a bit like pizza.

151
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,040
You're right.

152
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,379
It'll suit the taste...

153
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,380
- of any Korean.
- Everyone will like it.

154
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,389
It looks very...

155
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,720
(It's time to eat tacos.)

156
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,060
Suadero.

157
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,290
Barbacoa.

158
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,960
I don't know which is which.

159
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,159
(Suadero: Grilled beef taco, Al pastor: Red-seasoned pork taco, )

160
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,500
(Barbacoa: Braised meat taco)

161
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,600
- Shall we have a bite of each?
- Sure.

162
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,270
- I'll try it first.
- Okay.

163
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,140
(They start with the barbacoa taco.)

164
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,050
It's hardest to imagine the taste of this one.

165
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:31,650
(Loading the flavours)

166
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,490
Eat gringas.

167
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:38,260
This one has the aroma of corn.

168
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:41,560
(Feeling curious, he dips it in salsa and tries it.)

169
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,560
It's tasty. The filling is very tasty.

170
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,500
(Humming in approval)

171
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,669
It's tasty.

172
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:51,240
(He takes a bite of the al pastor taco.)

173
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,600
- Shall I finish it?
- Yes.

174
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,369
The meat tastes like jangjorim.

175
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,370
Yes.

176
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,940
And this is... You know what it is, right?

177
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,356
- It tastes like tandoori chicken.
- Middle Eastern food?

178
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,410
Yes.

179
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,679
- Indian food.
- Indian food?

180
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,150
(Woo Bin corrects him.)

181
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,189
Woo Bin, it tastes like pork belly.

182
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,536
(Suadero taco tastes like pork belly.)

183
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,530
It's tasty. This one is tasty.

184
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,470
My goodness.

185
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:24,870
- Is it tasty?
- Yes.

186
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,360
It really tastes like pork belly.

187
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:33,480
(Even the last taco was a big success.)

188
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,710
It's tasty.

189
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,680
Kwang Soo, shall we have a burrito?

190
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,980
What?

191
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,326
- Shall we have a burrito?
- We ordered a burrito.

192
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:43,420
We haven't ordered it yet.

193
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,389
I want to order a burrito to go.

194
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,960
- I'll eat it on the road.
- Really?

195
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,789
We need to eat chocolate too.

196
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:50,989
- What?
- Chocolate.

197
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,730
(Leave some space for chocolate.)

198
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,130
One? Aren't you going to eat it?

199
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,430
I want it.

200
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,240
Then, I'll eat...

201
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:00,800
a beef burrito.

202
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,969
Do you want the pork belly burrito?

203
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:04,839
- Yes.
- It was tasty.

204
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,156
(All three of them decide to get a burrito.)

205
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,340
Excuse me.

206
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,280
Okay.

207
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:10,749
I like your Spanish.

208
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,719
- Suadero...
- Suadero. Yes.

209
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,320
- One burrito.
- Okay.

210
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,060
And tripe burrito.

211
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:21,690
- Okay.
- One.

212
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,230
- Two.
- Two.

213
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,060
Two tripe burritos and one suadero burrito?

214
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,800
- Yes.
- Okay.

215
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:30,470
How do you feel about eating tacos until the very end?

216
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,939
In a sense, this is our last meal.

217
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,470
So it's best to eat Mexican food.

218
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:35,640
It's tasty, right?

219
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,279
Had the last meal not suited...

220
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,880
our taste,

221
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,650
the entire trip...

222
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,619
Would it have affected the entire trip?

223
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,050
Well, you know how it is.

224
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,949
After a trip to the karaoke, you hum the last song you've sung.

225
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,190
It's like that.

226
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,330
- That's right.
- It lingers in your memories.

227
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,059
(The trip started with tacos and ended with tacos.)

228
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,690
This place is so tasty.

229
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,900
We kept having tacos at Kyung Soo's insistence.

230
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,829
- They grew on us.
- We became addicted.

231
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,169
We became used to them.

232
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:03,806
- The tacos grew on us.
- The tacos grew on you.

233
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,499
- Yes.
- They could be our staple.

234
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,670
Yes. Seriously.

235
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:08,739
(They became well-versed in tacos on their 8th day.)

236
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:09,740
Seriously.

237
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,210
I'm pretty satisfied.

238
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,479
All right. Thank you.

239
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,050
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

240
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:17,549
I'll pack salsa...

241
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,780
- Salsa.
- on the side.

242
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:21,389
Salsa. Medium salsa.

243
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,820
Just that one? Don't you need more?

244
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,860
He's very kind.

245
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,159
- He packs salsa too.
- I know.

246
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,390
Only medium?

247
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:30,660
Medium and...

248
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,660
Anything you want from here. Anything.

249
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:33,930
- This one.
- That one?

250
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,300
Okay. That's spicy.

251
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,570
- More?
- It's enough.

252
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,339
Thank you.

253
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,670
(Focused)

254
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,210
Eres muy amable.

255
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:45,540
My friend.

256
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,039
Eres muy amable.

257
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,109
(You're very kind.)

258
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,209
(The employee checks.)

259
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,950
Thank you.

260
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,620
His level of happiness seems to be very high.

261
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,789
(The employee even packs lime.)

262
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,990
- Thank you.
- Napkins.

263
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,959
- Napkins, please.
- Oh, my gosh.

264
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,060
My friend!

265
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:04,559
(A very kind friend)

266
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,729
- Napkins.
- Thank you.

267
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,600
(A very kind friend)

268
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,000
He's a bit like my grandma.

269
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,640
Grandmas keep packing things when you go home.

270
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,140
That's right.

271
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,870
- This is only for food.
- Okay.

272
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,440
- It's 813 pesos.
- Okay.

273
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,879
- Okay.
- Let's give him 1,000 pesos...

274
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,979
including the tip.

275
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,709
- Yes.
- Okay.

276
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,479
- Keep the change.
- Thank you very much.

277
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,579
- Thank you.
- And...

278
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,850
please write this receipt...

279
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:31,119
because I've got to give it to my boss.

280
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,319
- So, please...
- I got it.

281
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,830
I'm his boss.

282
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:36,329
Okay.

283
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,859
(I'm that boss.)

284
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,930
Thank goodness.

285
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:42,870
(The employee finishes writing the receipt.)

286
00:10:42,871 --> 00:10:44,369
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

287
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,869
- Thank you.
- How about a telephone number?

288
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,239
Do you want a telephone number?

289
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,540
It's okay.

290
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,740
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

291
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,409
(After lunch, it's time for a dessert.)

292
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:55,480
Where is it?

293
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,050
We need to go a bit further.

294
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,940
It's like the street of the hotel before the last one.

295
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:04,990
(The atmosphere of the street is familiar, but new.)

296
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,120
Is this where our hotel is located?

297
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,060
- No.
- I think so.

298
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,030
Isn't this where our hotel is located?

299
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,099
I think so.

300
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,130
- Right?
- Really?

301
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,669
(They arrive at the dessert cafe as CEO Lee wanted.)

302
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,600
The street the two of you checked out?

303
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:22,040
(When a chocolate lover comes to a cafe, )

304
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:25,139
(he stimulates his appetite with chocolate ice cream.)

305
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,810
(Savouring the flavours)

306
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,610
(Squeezing his eyes shut)

307
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,579
(The taste of chocolate moves him.)

308
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,119
- Is it tasty?
- Is it rich?

309
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,390
(Is the chocolate rich?)

310
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,720
(Gosh!)

311
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,460
(Shaking)

312
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,790
It's incredibly tasty. But it's incredibly sweet.

313
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,700
It's tasty.

314
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,800
It's so tasty.

315
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,729
It's the taste my body wants.

316
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:53,370
(He gives a spoonful to Kyung Soo.)

317
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:58,540
(He gets more sugar with a chocolate latte.)

318
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:01,110
(This is it.)

319
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:02,280
It's tasty.

320
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,580
It's really tasty.

321
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,650
(The expedition team members stop drinking and move.)

322
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,220
Let's buy ice cream for the staff members.

323
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:16,360
(CEO Lee wants to share the taste with everyone.)

324
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,460
- Excuse me.
- How many are there?

325
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,660
There are four here.

326
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,799
(They bring a lot of ice cream.)

327
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,870
Twelve.

328
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,939
I'll pay with my card.

329
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,170
- Here.
- No.

330
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,070
(I'll pay for this.)

331
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:31,240
Are you buying ice cream for the staff members?

332
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,510
CEO Lee is doing that.

333
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,579
- No. We're doing it together.
- CEO Lee...

334
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,449
has been so generous. since yesterday.

335
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:38,919
Woo Bin sent me half of the cost yesterday.

336
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,119
Really?

337
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,960
- Really?
- He said it'd make him feel good...

338
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,889
- to pay as well.
- Auditor Kim.

339
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,619
- How nice.
- You didn't say that about me.

340
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,559
- Auditor Kim is the best.
- You...

341
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,890
(We thank both of them.)

342
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,560
I told him that it was okay,

343
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,599
but he was adamant about joining in.

344
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,170
(Why are you telling them that?)

345
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:59,000
It almost led to a big fight.

346
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:00,540
I said, "It's okay."

347
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,409
"I don't want you to spend your money."

348
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:03,930
Woo Bin said, "No, I want to join in."

349
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,739
(The fight between the man who wanted to send money...)

350
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,580
(and the man who didn't want to receive money)

351
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:11,150
(Paying with his own card)

352
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,679
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

353
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,949
- Thank you.
- Bye.

354
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,850
- Bye, my friend.
- Bye.

355
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,460
See you at the car rental place.

356
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,489
All set.

357
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,890
(It's time to return the car.)

358
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,300
(Chocolate appears again.)

359
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:31,199
(He takes a big spoonful.)

360
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,870
(He gives it to Woo Bin first.)

361
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,980
(Then, he takes a spoonful.)

362
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,779
(Director eats a burrito.)

363
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,880
It's very tasty.

364
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,620
(They set off as they eat a snack of their choice.)

365
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,630
I feel like we're headed to our next travel destination.

366
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,789
Right.

367
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,830
(The expedition team has become used to travelling.)

368
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,430
Gosh.

369
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,060
(He's finally full.)

370
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,300
Why?

371
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,920
- What?
- Why did you make that noise?

372
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,470
I'm thankful for your driving.

373
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,040
I'm thankful.

374
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,410
We should've said that three people would drive.

375
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:12,880
Kyung Soo, you suddenly say that since there's a camera.

376
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,839
- What?
- You suddenly say that...

377
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,950
since there's a camera.

378
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,319
Do you mean my comment about your driving?

379
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,580
(He said his words of gratitude in front of the camera.)

380
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,850
Did you hear that?

381
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:25,919
Kwang Soo,

382
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,190
driving wasn't so hard, was it?

383
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,060
Was it hard?

384
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,836
- Driving to Rio Lagartos was hard.
- Wasn't it okay? It was okay.

385
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,129
- I agree. It wasn't bad.
- But...

386
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:37,970
if you're truly thankful, can you give us some money?

387
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,770
(CEO Lee is a total capitalist.)

388
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:43,970
A gift works too.

389
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:48,380
(Averting his eyes)

390
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,686
Kyung Soo, it's really tasty. Don't you want to try it?

391
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,456
- What is it?
- Seriously, try it. It's cake.

392
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,779
I left some for you.

393
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,820
It's really tasty.

394
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,050
You won't regret it.

395
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,650
Have a spoonful.

396
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,460
You didn't leave it for me. You didn't even eat a lot of it.

397
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,410
You didn't eat it because it tasted bad, right?

398
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,700
- Hey, Smelly Doh!
- What?

399
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:11,470
(I gave it to you so that you could try it.)

400
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:12,700
Hey, Pee Kyung Soo.

401
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,499

402
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,869
(Director Doh gained more nicknames on the expedition.)

(Arrived at the car rental company)

404
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,780
Hi.

405
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,209
Hi.

406
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,479
- Finished?
- Yes.

407
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,819
I will close the contract,

408
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,696
and the difference in gas has to be paid in pesos.

409
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,450
- Please sign here on this paper.
- Okay.

410
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,649
Sign here?

411
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:32,290
- This, here.
- Here? Okay.

412
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,589
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

413
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,589
- Thank you.
- Have a good day.

414
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,660
(They returned the car smoothly.)

415
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,960
From what I've calculated,

416
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,670
the balance left in the bank account...

417
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,670
is 3,392 dollars.

418
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,469
We've got some pesos left here.

419
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,040
Add up the coins...

420
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,439
- It's 2,060 pesos.
- Round it up to 2,100 pesos,

421
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,079
and my calculation says we have...

422
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,786
as much money left as we additionally received.

423
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:59,749
- You're right. We didn't use any.
- Exactly.

424
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,079
But the calculation might be different.

425
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,389
- No, it can't be different.
- I...

426
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,650
What was it again?

427
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,960
- Seriously.
- Right?

428
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,689
What's more, there's some left.

429
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:10,290
These are the receipts from yesterday and today.

430
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,829
I've kept them. Please pass them along to Jun Wi.

431
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,129
- I will.
- Great.

432
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:16,300
(The auditor fulfills his duty until the end.)

433
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:17,629
- Okay, great job.
- Good.

434
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,240
- Great job.
- Great job.

435
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:20,869
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

436
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,610
You can now safely return to Seoul.

437
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,670
- It was a meaningful trip.
- Yes.

438
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,709
- I was in total bliss.
- It was fun.

439
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:27,910
Let's take a photo, Kwang Soo.

440
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,210
Cute.

441
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,190
I'll clap.

442
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:36,850
One, two, three.

443
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:40,120
- Good job.
- Great job.

457
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,100
- What?
- I've never been here before.

458
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,400
- It must be a meeting room.
- Right?

- What are we doing today?
- Take a seat.

What are we exactly doing in the results briefing session?

I've never done one before.

467
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,800
When one goes on a business trip, they make a business trip report.

468

Otherwise,

469
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:50,729
the boss might think,

470
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:53,399
"Were they on the business trip just for fun?"

471
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,529
You shouldn't waste the company's money.

00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:55,870
Exactly.

473
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:57,669
It's easy to communicate with the CEO.

474
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,100
I understood what you said.

475
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:02,969
Do you usually...

476
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,539
write the report and hand it over?

477
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,880
- You normally make a report.
- I see.

478
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,680
It's old-fashioned,

479
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,180
but we'll go the traditional route.

480
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:14,080
This is a first since...

481
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,549
the class president election back in elementary school.

482
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:18,219
- Isn't this poster paper?
- The viewers...

483
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,920
must be able to read it. It has to be easy for them to see.

484
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,360
After you make the report,

485
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,560
you must give a briefing...

486
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,259
to the executives.

487
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,459
Only then will they realise...

488
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,469
the expedition was a good decision...

489
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,430
and not wasted.

490
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,500

00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,880
"Expedition outline, company name,"

496
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,720
"team organisation and titles,"

497
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:50,989
"expedition country, expedition period, expedition reason."

498
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,620
- These are...
- Those are simple.

499
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,460
We're presenting this before CEO Ko, right?

500
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,590
The executives, along with CEO Ko.

501
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,800
CEO Ko is quite inflexible.

502
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,630
You should give the presentation.

503
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,200
Let's do it together.

504
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,639
The CEO should...

505
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,069
CEOs don't do it, do they?

506
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,139
- The presentation?
- Yes.

507
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,739
- They do.
- Right.

508
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,310
CEOs normally have their arms crossed.

509
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,310
Isn't it common in dramas?

510
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,410
When CEOs take part in such meetings...

511
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:18,150
- Our company isn't that big.
- Exactly.

512
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:21,379
Having your arms crossed when there are only three of us...

513
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,449
- At a time like this...
- You only have two employees.

514
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:24,489
I know, right?

515
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:26,020
It's giving off...

516
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,219
subcontractor vibes.

517
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,660
- Like...
- We are a subcontractor.

518
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,560
You're right.

519
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,559
The head office is giving us money.

520
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,760
- Right?
- You were sponsored.

521
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,329
We couldn't have gone if they had stopped us.

522
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:39,000
- Exactly.
- Yes.

523
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,370
- How about we start?
- Let's do it.

524
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:44,669
- KKPP Foods. The company name.
- The company name.

525

KKPP...

530
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,279
- Expedition country.
- Expedition country, Mexico.

531
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,989
- Don't they know it all?
- I know, right?

532
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,550
Aren't they just bullying us?

533
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:59,260
It's a hassle.

534
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,930
- Expedition reason.
- Reason.

535
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:05,160
We have to explain it well.

536
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,829
For the company's growth...

537
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,229
(Expedition reason: For the company's growth)

538
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,800
How do we put it? Experience?

539
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:12,939
- Idea...
- Experiencing overseas culture.

540
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,270
- Gain ideas.
- Broaden our perspectives.

541
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:17,140
For the company's growth...

542
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,580
We could write "An insight for the company's growth."

543
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,650
That sounds fancy.

544
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,579
Because of that one word.

545
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,450
I've never heard "insight" before.

546
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,179
- It was only ever on Instagram.
- And...

547
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,920
- open a parenthesis.
- Okay.

548
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,090
Team cohesion.

549
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:33,519
- Nice.
- It's a must.

550
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,659
- That's important.
- Yes.

551
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,829
Improve team cohesion.

552
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,129
- Nice.
- Good one.

553
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,599
(Improve team cohesion)

554
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,920
Through improved team cohesion...

555
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,629
No.

556
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:42,829
It's getting longer.

557
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,000
That will...

558
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,720
- There's no end.
- Through improved team cohesion...

559
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,469
Unlimited...

560
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:50,169
No, don't.

561
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:52,280
- Unlimited what?
- Let's end it there.

562
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,509
- Improve team cohesion?
- Yes, improve.

563
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:55,580
Okay.

564
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,679
- Let's move on.
- "Unlimited?"

565
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,180
(Wrapping up the expedition outline)

566
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,180
"A memorable experience."

567
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,850
Right. You can't write everything down.

568
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,520
- This is...
- We must include it.

569
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,760
Tripe tacos.

570
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,290
- That was...
- It was amazing.

571
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,890
Try it through the photo.

572
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:14,400
- This was the best food.
- Cilantro?

573
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,999
- This was good.
- It was.

574
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,769
- Totally.
- Mexican breakfast.

575
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:19,499
- Chilaquiles.
- Chilaquiles.

576
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,770
- Street tacos.
- Street.

577
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,070
- Nan Do amigo.
- Recommended by Nan Do.

578
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,810
- It was good.
- I loved...

579
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,040
how it had French fries on the side.

580
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,239
Guacamole.

581
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,760
(Guacamole after the whale shark tour)

582
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:31,179
Let's write ceviche down.

583
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,820
- It was delicious.
- I agree.

584
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,080
This was good too.

585
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,419
- Mangos.
- Yes.

586
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,449
- It was great.
- It was delicious.

587
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:39,170
- We must add this in.
- With chilli powder.

588
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:43,430
(Choosing the dishes for the report)

589
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:47,000
We have to write down a memorable experience.

590
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,070
The hot-air balloon.

591
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,929
It was a novel experience.

592
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:52,600
We have to write it down.

593
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,399
- We do...
- Leave it as a candidate.

594
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,240
Because it was the first to broaden our knowledge.

595
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,440
The pyramid.

596
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,349
- It was nice.
- The pyramid was something new.

597
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,449
- Shall we write it down?
- Yes.

598
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:05,080
- The pyramid was...
- Yes.

599
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,819
The more the better, right?

600
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,250
I think...

601
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,349
we can sell this...

602
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,620
by making something similar.

603
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,360
I'm serious.

604
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,630
You can communicate with it.

605
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:19,899
Imagine blowing it as you walk around.

606
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,699
Among elementary school students...

607
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,770
- It...
- And as a self-defence item.

608
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:24,929
It'll be good as a self-defence item.

609
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:27,440
- Blow it, and it's loud.
- It's really loud.

610
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:29,969
- Okay, for now...
- For now...

611
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:31,469
(Exclaiming)

612
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:33,179
The wrestling was really impressive.

613
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,279
- Yes.
- Totally.

614
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,449
- I'm going to write wrestling.
- Let's write it.

615
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:36,770
- Shall I?
- Write this one down.

616
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,050
- Lucha libre...
- Come on.

617
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,249
What's this?

618
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,720
Isn't this a dummy?

619
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:45,490
Is it an actual human?

620
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,490
He watched wrestling with such...

621
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,759
- I...
- a painful expression?

622
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,359
I was genuinely surprised.

623
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,059
- I didn't think I'd be this sleepy.
- Right.

624
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,400
All of us are...

625
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,570
All of us look dead.

626
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:58,999
(Moving past the dummy days)

627
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,070
Really.

628
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:01,499
This was nice too.

629
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,669
What happened? Where's your bracelet?

630
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:05,139
Mine is at home.

631
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,279
I had it on almost every day.

632
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,539
Woo Bin is wearing his, right?

633
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,579
Enough.

634
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,779
- No, wait.
- I'm taking it off.

635
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,849
No, I have it. I do.

636
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,219
I'm not wearing it by choice.

637
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,450
I have mine.

638
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:17,449
Keep it on. It looks good on you.

639
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:18,990
I have mine, okay? I do.

640
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,920
I just have to fix it.

641
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:22,130
- It snapped...
- Gosh.

642
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:23,460
From wearing it too much.

643
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,060
What an annoying start.

644
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:30,070
- This place was awesome.
- For real.

645
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,020
- I loved this place the most.
- Same here.

646
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:34,440
- The ground itself was interesting.
- Right.

647
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:36,209
- This...
- The water was warm.

648
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,810
This would be nice too.

649
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,510
Like what?

650
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:41,639
- Setting up a pond...
- In a shallow place?

651
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,080
And releasing the birds.

652
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,979
You get to experience it.

653
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,880
The water has to be warm.

654
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,819
Add fish too.

655
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,990
(Scratching)

656
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,720
- So?
- Are you okay, Kyung Soo?

657
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,160
Didn't it peck your hand back then?

658
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:58,660
You're right. Its beak is on Kwang Soo's hand.

659
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,859
- Look, I actually got pecked.
- For real.

660
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,430
Nobody listened to me.

661
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:05,130
It hurt for real, you know?

662
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,569
Its beak is on your hand.

663
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,739
The bird is biting my finger.

664
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,870
(Upset)

665
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:13,680
- The mud.
- Yes, the mud.

666
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:15,780
How cute.

667
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:17,950
I'm going to keep this photo for myself.

668
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,679
- Frame it.
- That'd be adorable.

669
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,119
How could you make...

670
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,000
- He's dead inside.
- such an empty expression?

671
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,019
This was amazing too.

672
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:28,060
- The whale shark.
- The whale shark.

673
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,329
The seasickness was intense.

674
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:32,530
- Right.
- The seasickness...

675
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,460
Our eyes met.

676
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,869
I'm serious. It was like this.

677
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,500
(Opening its mouth)

678
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:39,370
Right in front of me.

679
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,210
I thought, "Wait. This might be bad."

680
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:45,410
But right then, I was pulled to the side.

681
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,009
- Really?
- Seriously,

682
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:48,640
our eyes met.

683
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,049
I got scared at that moment.

684
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:52,250
Did you see its eyes?

685
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:54,950
I did. The whale shark looks at you from the sides.

686
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:57,389
Something like this.

687
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:59,166
(The director was scared of getting devoured by the whale shark.)

688
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,759
It was after the tour.

689
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,629
- When we swam. I loved it.
- Right?

690
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:04,629
My seasickness didn't go away.

691
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:05,699
- I remember.
- For real.

692
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,930
You didn't swim at all.

693
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,599
Trust me when I say I'm not lying.

694
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,600
After we returned,

695
00:25:09,601 --> 00:25:10,769
- the seasickness lasted for a week.
- Right?

696
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:12,199
- I'm serious.
- It lasted for days.

697
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,140
I'm serious. In cars.

698
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,639
- In the backseat.
- I heard...

699
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,916
- there was an aftereffect.
- I still had seasickness in Korea.

700
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,640
I actually feel it even now.

701
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:20,710
For real.

702
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,856
It's been three months, but the aftereffect hasn't gone away.

703
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,710
(Mexico's seasickness was that severe.)

704
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,249
- Is this Kyung Soo?
- You and me.

705
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,379
Really, Doh Kyung Soo.

706
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,949
He said vacation spots weren't his thing.

707
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:31,350
- Right?
- But look.

708
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:32,560
That was then.

709
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,060
Peeing from happiness.

710
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:35,420
Come on.

711
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:37,390
I wasn't peeing from happiness.

712
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,160
Here, look.

713
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,459
- Vacation spots are not...
- How are vacation spots...

714
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,100
- Doh Kyung Soo's thing.
- not his thing?

715
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:43,530
Seriously?

716
00:25:43,531 --> 00:25:45,500
How is this someone who hates vacation spots?

717
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,299
That's hilarious.

718
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,870
Someone who hates vacation spots.

719
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:51,750
What's this? I've never seen this expression before.

720
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:54,579
- "It's a rainbow." - Yes, that moment.

721
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,580
I remember.

722
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:57,049
This was also nice.

723
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:58,110
- Yes.
- Right?

724
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,220
We wrote down nine things.

725
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:03,090
- Now then...
- It's time to pick some out.

726
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:04,719
- You're right.
- We've done a handful of things.

727
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,760
You absolutely did.

728
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,420
Let's take the mango out.

729
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:10,230
Honestly,

730
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,500
it'll be easy to use.

731
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,060
- If we were to...
- I see.

732
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,330
True.

733
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,670
Then, shall we take out the guacamole?

734
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,099
It's common.

735
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,039
Yes, but it was different.

736
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,170
It was with shrimp.

737
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:24,410
- Right.
- Nachos and shrimp.

738
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:26,250
- Fresh shrimp.
- It's totally different.

739
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:29,109
The wrestling.

740
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,710
As for wrestling, we might...

741
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:32,549
- do it.
- We might put on a show.

742
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,850
Wrestling?

743
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,950
We've done plenty of action scenes.

744
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,460
Get changed while people eat, you know?

745
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:43,929
There's nothing to take out.

746
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:44,930
(In the end, they'll report everything.)

747
00:26:44,931 --> 00:26:46,491
- It's hard to take one out.
- After...

748
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,729
Improvement points.

749
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:49,300
(3. Limitations and Improvements)

750
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:50,770
Limitations.

751
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:53,300
- Money was the limitation.
- Yes.

752
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,169
- You're right, Kwang Soo.
- Aren't I?

753
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:56,469
- Because of the lack of money...
- Right?

754
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:57,670
We didn't even look things up.

755
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:00,139
Didn't we dismiss anything expensive?

756
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,280
- Totally.
- Yes.

757
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,009
More diverse accommodations...

758
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:04,509
We couldn't visit any resorts.

759
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:06,179
- No.
- Things like that.

760
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,819
- Those are experiences too.
- Right?

761
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:10,249
Had we stayed there, who knows what we could've learned?

762
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,319
- Of course.
- The system as a whole...

763
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,290
High-end resorts are...

764
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,619
- being...
- Exactly.

765
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,359
- Yes.
- Operated.

766
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,829
- Yes, like how it is managed.
- It smells like such.

767
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,559
The interior design and so forth.

768
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,630
Let's write this down.

769
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,500
Jun Wi's sensitivity.

770
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,870
In the limitations.

771
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,970
He was on edge when it came to work.

772
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,600
- Sensitivity is a bit...
- Inflexible?

773
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,809
- What do you call that?
- Suffocating?

774
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:35,880
- How do you put it?
- "Suffocating?"

775
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,509
Looking down a bit.

776
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,820
Looking down?

777
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,919
Jun Wi's looking-down attitude.

778
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,050
- Jun Wi's harshness.
- Harshness.

779
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,860
- His words.
- Somewhat...

780
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,560
- Somewhat sharp.
- Somewhat AI-like words?

781
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:53,359
He was literally an AI.

782
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,530
- AI-like words.
- His expressions were blank.

783
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,830
He barely smiled.

784
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:58,570
Due to his words,

785
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,670
all employees' stress...

786
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:06,540
- Stress...
- Stress level elevated.

787
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:10,350
(They wrote the draft while creating rumours about the senior accountant.)

788
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:12,450
What you've all discussed.

789
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:15,019
Write it down on this paper...

790
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,649
in big letters so it's readable,

791
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:18,620
and stick photos if needed.

792
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,459
After that, the presentation.

793
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,660
- Yes.
- Okay.

794
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,430
- Let's do that.
- You write.

795
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:24,960
- You write, Kyung Soo.
- Okay.

796
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:26,900
Then...

797
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,229
Can you cut out the parts...

798
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:30,869
that are the highlights?

799
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:31,870
- Shall I?
- Yes.

800
00:28:31,871 --> 00:28:33,770
We can stick those on.

801
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,839
Using scissors after a long time...

802
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,186
(In charge of decorating, in charge of writing)

803
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:39,980
- I feel pure.
- Right?

804
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,340
- It feels nice.
- Yes.

805
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,700
Your outfit is far from cutting things out.

806
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:47,320
Using scissors with etiquette is nice, you know?

807
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:51,089
I'll write things down...

808
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:52,370
- even if I'm bad at it.
- Okay.

809
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,790
Please read it out loud for me.

810
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,090
I'd like to put this in our report.

811
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,659
- Down here...
- It's so cute and likeable.

812
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,969
- Cut it out and stick it down here.
- Okay.

813
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:04,099
(Always in love with the director)

814
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,170
I will...

815
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:07,440
You have good handwriting, Kyung Soo.

816
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:09,000
An insight...

817
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,970
"For the company's growth."

818
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,610
Shall I write "insight" in English?

819
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,949
Yes.

820
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:18,010
Nice. That's a great idea.

821
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,419
I looked up the word.

822
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,580
(Now that the writing is done, it's time to decorate.)

823
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:25,720
You can stick the photos here.

824
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,520
This is so nice.

825
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,760
- After sticking them on, - Yes?

826
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:33,130
- we can write things next to them.
- With this?

827
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,170
This feeling of using glue is a first in ages.

828
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:39,470
If we had liquid glue, I could've made spider webs.

829
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,539
(Sticking photos after recalling spider webs)

830
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,110
I've not heard that in years.

831
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:45,569
- The outline is done.
- Okay.

832
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:48,880
(CEO Lee is sticking the photos on diligently.)

833
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:52,049
(But he's sticking them on top of the director's writing?)

834
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:53,750
Aren't there too many photos?

835
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,289
What was it again? Aesthetic?

836
00:29:58,290 --> 00:29:59,820
Are you fine with the aesthetic?

837
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:02,220
What? Doh Kyung Soo made a mistake.

838
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:05,730
You have to cover up all the writings, Kwang Soo.

839
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:09,370
- I can draw...
- The writing...

840
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,799
(The decorator-in-charge is upset at the writing-in-charge's comment.)

841
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,470
I was kind enough to write down...

842
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:17,240
I... Even these...

843
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:20,379
- It's impossible.
- I wanted Rio Lagartos here,

844
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,209
- so why is it here?
- It's impossible, okay?

845
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:23,379
- What?
- There are more dishes.

846
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,349
- Leave it.
- What a mess.

847
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,480
Should I stick it here?

848
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,890
Where's the thick marker?

849
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,950
- The thick marker.
- Here, Kwang Soo.

850
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,690
Why is this here?

851
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:38,559
It's to cover up the writing that's visible.

852
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,100
(CEO Lee tries to sort it out.)

853
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:46,470
(Ultimately, CEO Lee covers it up with love.)

854
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:50,870
(CEO Lee has it all planned out.)

855
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:54,039
Let's stick it all on and write below it.

856
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,210
- Okay, I'm in.
- Done.

857
00:30:56,810 --> 00:31:01,180
(They plan to stick the photos first, then write the names.)

858
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,090
What's this? Ceviche?

859
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,060
- Yes.
- Is this ceviche, Kyung Soo?

860
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,720
Yes.

861
00:31:06,721 --> 00:31:09,460
It's aguachile, but it's similar.

862
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,810
Do you...

863
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:26,210
usually make this at companies?

864
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,916
Don't elementary students do this for presentations?

865
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,550
Students use PowerPoint these days.

866
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,050
- You're right.
- Right?

867
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:36,690
But we were told to make it readable for the viewers.

868
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:39,720
They've got such high-end tech. We could've used PowerPoint.

869
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,730
Will the viewers find this easier to read?

870
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:45,830
I think we need a laser pointer.

871
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,430
- You're right?
- Right?

872
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,600
Nobody uses sticks these days.

873
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,470
(The stick is upset.)

874
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:55,539
There was a discussion about whether there was someone...

875
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,209
who could use a high-tech tool...

876
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:59,139
- like PowerPoint.
- Hold on.

877
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:02,140
I'm a level three certified word processor.

878
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,650
- Really?
- Really, Kwang Soo.

879
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,409
(The auditor is certified.)

880
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:06,480
I'm serious.

881
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,720
Isn't there too much white space?

882
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:12,119
It's called the beauty of white space.

883
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,190
Of course.

884
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,130
There's meaning to everything.

885
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,799
- What you're making right now.
- Yes?

886
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,869
Remember that we said there would be an exhibition?

887
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:23,999
I see.

888
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,639
It'll be hung up as one of the works.

889
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,869
Your poster.

890
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:28,969
(Laughing)

891
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:30,739
- Tell us before we start.
- You should've told us sooner.

892
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,110
- Why are you telling us that now?
- Come on.

893
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:34,640
This is...

894
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:37,950
(Screaming)

895
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,250
Shouldn't we decorate it more if it'll be exhibited?

896
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:44,789
How about sticking a photo of Jun Wi next to this?

897
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:46,020
- Yes.
- Do it.

898
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:49,930

No, make it into a shadow. Stop.

- Yes.

- It'll be hung up!

- but there are only pictures.
- Yes.

And the question that I got the most from people around me...

1012
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:10,449
- was about the tripe tacos.
- Yes.

uses raw shrimp,

1019
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,030
so it's important that the shrimp is fresh.

1020
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:27,269
And the onions are chopped. And this is...

1021
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:28,740
- Cucumbers.
- Cucumbers.

1022
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:31,610
And what else, Director?

1023
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:36,550
The shrimp is slightly cooked in vinegar,

1024
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,109
so...

1025
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:41,819
instead of the slimy texture,

1026
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,049
- What?
- it's much more...

1027
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:44,150
What?

1028
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,820

(Aguachile)

1032
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:51,830

- Do we have a marker?
- Don't you remember what you ate?

1037
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,869
No, it's not that.

1038
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:04,940
This is the ceviche.

1039
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,440
- Right?
- It is.

1040
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,340
This is... That's...

1041
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:11,770
- You just need to change the arrow.
- This is that, right?

1042
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:16,180

(Shaking his head)

1044

(The report is a mess.)

1045
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,600
This is the aguachile.

1046
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:34,569
It's a Mexican seafood dish, with seafood, like shrimp,

1047
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:37,940
in a sauce made with lime juice and peppers.

1048
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:40,709
And lucha libre.

1049
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:41,780
(And there's lucha libre.)

1050
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,309
This is not food.

1051
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:45,680
It's what we experienced.

1052
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:47,279

1053
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,620
Yes.

1054
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,589
I felt sleepy, but I was actually watching...

1055
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:51,720
through those eyes.

1056
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:53,719
I was sleepy,

1057
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,200
- but I remember everything.
- Right.

1058
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,629
And the schedule was that intense.

1059
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:59,029
- Yes.
- The jet lag.

1060
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:01,729
- Honestly, no one made us do it.
- Okay.

1061
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:04,669
But we wanted to experience more, to broaden our perspective...

1062
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:07,469
- and show it to our viewers.
- Yes.

1063
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,539
- That's right.
- Look at this.

1064
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,970
Look at his face in pain.

1065
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:13,410
Still, he went to cheer for them.

1066
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:14,879
It was literally an overseas cultural expedition.

1067
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,939
That's right.

1068
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:19,179
- This was an expedition, for sure.
- Yes.

1069
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,649
The expedition of all expeditions.

1070
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,450

1071
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,019
(The habitual standing ovation appears again.)

1072
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,119
Is that it?

1073
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,520
- No.
- No.

1074
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,789
There's more. The mango.

1075
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:31,729
- The last one is the mango.
- That one is so...

1076
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:33,059
- This one...
- It was a hit.

1077
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,029
(Lastly, the mango con Chile.)

1078
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:37,110
Honestly, we debated whether to introduce it or not.

1079
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:38,599
Because...

1080
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,939
there are secrets you want to keep to yourself.

1081
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,039
Things you don't want to share...

1082
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,140
- with others.
- Exactly.

1083
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,510
On top, here,

1084
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:47,540
it's not just mangos.

1085
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:49,779
A special powder is sprinkled.

1086
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,680
Let's not tell them about that yet.

1087
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:54,419
- Not yet.
- And, CEO Ko,

1088
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,619
if we had travelled with our own money,

1089
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,919
- we would never share the recipe.
- This one.

1090
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,920
Right.

1091
00:39:59,921 --> 00:40:02,819
Since we went on the expedition with the company's funds,

1092
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,330
we will share it with you.

1093
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:06,599
The recipe is only left...

1094
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,629
in our sense of taste and inside of us.

1095
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:11,570
It's a secret, so we can't tell you,

1096
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:13,599
but it has a special sauce, and...

1097
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,039
I will tell you up to this part.

1098
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,339
They sprinkle salt on it,

1099
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,539
- so the sweet...
- Enough.

1100
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,869
(Enough)

1101
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:20,340
I will stop here.

1102
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,249
(The CEO won't allow any more of the recipe to be revealed.)

1103
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:27,580
Next, "limitations and improvements."

1104
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:31,189
"Due to the low budget compared to the long travel distance,"

1105
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:33,690
"we had a sense of regret that we couldn't explore more."

1106
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:37,889
"Due to the AI-like behaviour of the finance team member,"

1107
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:40,460
"stress levels rose for the whole team."

1108
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,960
We didn't say who.

1109
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:45,399
There aren't a lot.

1110
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,239
- If something must be mentioned.
- Sure.

1111
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,370
That's the spirit in which this was written.

1112
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,240
May I ask you a question here?

1113
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,210
What kind?

1114
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:56,280
Before we came in here,

1115
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:59,349
I asked if you used all of the special expenses...

1116
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:00,550
- written here.
- Yes.

1117
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:02,049
What did you say, Jun Wi?

1118
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:04,019
They had a bit left over.

1119
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,189
How much was left?

1120
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:07,389
About 1,500 dollars.

1121
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:09,219
You had 1,500 dollars left over.

1122
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,030
Why didn't you have any good food?

1123
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,960
I will answer that question.

1124
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:16,769
(The auditor steps in with the financial discussions.)

1125
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:18,470
- For us...
- Yes.

1126
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,370
Woo Bin.

1127
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,640
- Introduce yourself first.
- Okay.

1128
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,570
Let me introduce myself.

1129
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,380
I am the auditor of KKPP Foods, Kim Woo Bin.

1130
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:33,050
To answer that question,

1131
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,379
this expedition was a first for us.

1132
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:37,860
An international cultural expedition.

1133
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:41,089
And it was our first time to have an accountant with us.

1134
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:43,930
So, the pressure we felt...

1135
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:47,459
overcame our sense of challenge.

1136
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:50,029
There's a first to everything, right?

1137
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:52,600
- "Let's achieve our goals..." - Yes.

1138
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:54,499
"while using the company's money..."

1139
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:57,109
"as efficiently as possible..."

1140
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:58,840
"and without waste."

1141
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:00,879
That's where our focus was.

1142
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,109
"The company's money is my money."

1143
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:03,510
Yes.

1144
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,110
We saved as much as possible.

1145
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:08,719
All right.

1146
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,989
(The budget operation showed a strong spirit of frugality.)

1147
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:12,019
Lastly...

1148
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:14,190
(The last chapter)

1149
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:16,929
"Future plans and commitments."

1150
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:18,089
(4. Future Plans and Commitments)

1151
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:19,929
"We will apply many of the things we experienced..."

1152
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:22,359
"during the cultural exploration to KKPP Foods in the future,"

1153
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,169
"providing more viewers with..."

1154
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:26,540
"richer visuals and information."

1155
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,199
(Thinking)

1156
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,370
How?

1157
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:33,779
I mean, it's too vague.

1158
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,579
How will you provide the viewers...

1159
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:38,779
with rich visuals and information?

1160
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,479
Could you give us more details?

1161
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,650
Director.

1162
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,220
How?

1163
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:47,589
(CEO Ko's sharp question came in out of nowhere.)

1164
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:49,389
How will you provide the viewers...

1165
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:52,589
with rich visuals and information?

1166
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:54,159
Could you give us more details?

1167
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,300
Director.

1168
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,969
(Uneasy eyes)

1169
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:00,000
Director.

1170
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:04,609
(Director Doh, who met his eyes, is chosen.)

1171
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:05,969
Why are you asking me?

1172
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:07,210
I mean...

1173
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,510
Reports are supposed to be...

1174
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,579
easy to... It was easy to understand,

1175
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:14,719
but for the next step,

1176
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,120
it needs details. That's the most important part.

1177
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:18,520
First of all...

1178
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:21,889
(First of all, the director starts his sentence.)

1179
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:23,760
Then, we will construct it...

1180
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:25,860
through validation. Whatever it may be.

1181
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:28,699
We can't make...

1182
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:31,270
the hot-air balloon that we experienced,

1183
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:33,069
- so we will make whatever we can.
- The food, mostly.

1184
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:35,069
- Mostly the food.
- Yes.

1185
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,469
Isn't taste all that matters?

1186
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:37,839
Well, sure.

1187
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,039
(He's bold and clear, as always.)

1188
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,079
New flavours.

1189
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,279
The ones we experienced.

1190
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,839
We will recreate it.

1191
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,649
We will make it amazing,

1192
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:46,349
incredibly similar,

1193
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:49,749
with almost 99.9 percent accuracy.

1194
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:51,120
At 99.9 percent?

1195
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:54,719
- Can you do that?
- That amazing flavour.

1196
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,720
Then...

1197
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:57,729
we will pull it up as much as possible.

1198
00:43:57,730 --> 00:43:58,730
At 95 percent?

1199
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:00,360
At 95 percent.

1200
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,370
We will have 95 percent accuracy to recreate it...

1201
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:05,629
- and let you have a taste.
- Okay.

1202
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:07,200
And for our future plans,

1203
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:08,439
we want all...

1204
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,840
We want the opinion of everyone in the company.

1205
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,540
We'd like to ask you as well.

1206
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,280
What exactly is it that you want?

1207
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:20,420
First of all, the expense report that you wrote.

1208
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:22,920
I will ask you some questions based on that.

1209
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:25,319
Is that the one we sent you when we were in Mexico?

1210
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,719
Yes, the one you sent me when you were in Mexico.

1211
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,200
Why do you have to bring up the past?

1212
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,229
(The expense report came back as karma.)

1213
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:33,360
Well, it is usually...

1214
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,429
checked to see if it was carried out properly.

1215
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:37,630
- Since we had the briefing session.
- Oh, yes.

1216
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:40,469
Let me ask you the first question.

1217
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:42,670
Let's see the expense report from back then.

1218
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:47,040
"First, through various dishes, Director Doh Kyung Soo will..."

1219
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,209
"enhance his cooking skills and ideas."

1220
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:52,010
"Therefore, we will present a new menu with improved quality."

1221
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,720
"Second, after enjoying the hot-air balloon tour and parasailing,"

1222
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:59,690
"we will incorporate them into the program."

1223
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:01,120
"Third..."

1224
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:03,989
- Did I say that?
- Yes. "Relieve stress..."

1225
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:07,059
"Our team will relieve stress through various experiences,"

1226
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:08,659
"extend our vitality,"

1227
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:11,569
"and film for several more years with a healthy body."

1228
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:13,669
- Look here.
- "A healthy body?"

1229
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:15,270
- Did we say that?
- If you look here...

1230
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:16,670
If you look here...

1231
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:18,640
- May we take a look together?
- Yes.

1232
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:20,540
(Fumbling)

1233
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,809
- Yes, that one.
- This?

1234
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:24,490
(His settlement item appears again today.)

1235
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,450
What? Where did you get them?

1236
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:30,920
(He boosts his combat power and checks the report.)

1237
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:34,290
We did write that.

1238
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,790
- For me, - Okay.

1239
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,490
- with Section 3-1, - Yes.

1240
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:41,900
- I can definitely present it.
- Okay.

1241
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,120
What are you going to do about Section 3-2?

1242
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:45,400
What?

1243
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:46,969
He wrote that one.

1244
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:49,240
(The biggest problem still remains.)

1245
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:51,170
- First of all, for me...
- Yes.

1246
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:54,440
My vitality has been extended.

1247
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:57,649
I have a few years...

1248
00:45:57,650 --> 00:46:00,719
I mean, my vitality has been extended, so...

1249
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,949
About Section 3-3, if you can't think of it now,

1250
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:04,449
- Yes.
- give it some thought,

1251
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:05,589
- Yes.
- and discuss it for the next...

1252
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:06,989
- I'll find a way to incorporate it.
- Okay.

1253
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:08,059
Sure.

1254
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:10,860
Lastly,

1255
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:13,560
you explained about the tacos,

1256
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:15,160
so could you...

1257
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,399
In the expense report,

1258
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,570
- there's something I requested.
- Yes.

1259
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:22,500
Back then,

1260
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:27,379
I suggested that we have a showcase for the new items.

1261
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:30,249
I was wondering if we could taste...

1262
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:32,150
the new menu.

1263
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,409
Haven't you eaten yet?

1264
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:34,819
No, I didn't even have lunch.

1265
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:36,180
- Really?
- Really.

1266
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:38,489
Well, then...

1267
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:40,019
(Glancing)

1268
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:41,559
(All eyes focus on one person.)

1269
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,120
- Well, then...
- Is it possible?

1270
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:46,030
It doesn't matter to us.

1271
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:47,759
What do you mean, "It doesn't matter for us?"

1272
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,200
No, that's not what I meant.

1273
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:50,970
I mean...

1274
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:53,740
- Tell them.
- It's possible.

1275
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:56,670
- It's possible.
- Can you do it right now?

1276
00:46:57,810 --> 00:46:58,840
What should...

1277
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:01,040
Should we put salt on some mangos?

1278
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:04,109
- Yes, this is possible.
- This one is possible.

1279
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:05,280
This is possible.

1280
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:08,330
- Which ones are possible?
- Which ones are possible?

1281
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:09,650
This one is actually...

1282
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:11,849
- We just need the powder.
- Yes.

1283
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:13,689
If this is in season, let's do this.

1284
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:16,160
- If not...
- Let's use ramyeon seasoning.

1285
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:17,589
- It might be good.
- Okay.

1286
00:47:17,590 --> 00:47:19,070
Let's not share the recipe with them.

1287
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:23,230
(They choose the menu in secret.)

1288
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,630
- Then, we will make...
- Yes.

1289
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:26,770
Tripe tacos...

1290
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:29,440
and dessert.

1291
00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:31,440
We will try...

1292
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:35,380
We'll do our best to showcase it.

1293
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:36,510
Thank you.

1294
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:39,109
Director, since we're at it,

1295
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:40,450
let's not make it for ourselves.

1296
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:42,479
Can we post an internal notice...

1297
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,320
about this on-the-spot tasting session?

1298
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:48,420
CEO Ko should taste it first.

1299
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:50,760
I think I can handle a bit more than ten servings.

1300
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,829
- Then we will...
- Twelve people?

1301
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:55,299
- say 12 people.
- Great.

1302
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:57,099
I will make an internal notice that it will be 12 people...

1303
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:58,620
- Yes.
- on a 1st-come 1st-serve basis

1304
00:47:58,700 --> 00:47:59,729
Great.

1305
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:02,369
Then, we will prepare the notice right away.

1306
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:03,569
Okay.

1307
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:05,369
- But this is...
- Shall we go?

1308
00:48:05,370 --> 00:48:06,739
- Should we prepare?
- Yes.

1309
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:07,840
All right.

1310
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:10,109
- Good job.
- Good job.

1311
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:11,710
- Good job.
- Good job.

1312

(GBRB: Joy Pops Laugh Pops)

1313
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:21,190
(Basement Level 2)

1314
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:22,590
It's been so long.

1315
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,660
Will the jalapeno peppers be spicy?

1316
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:27,099
They will be spicy.

1317
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:29,076
(It's his first time handling it as an ingredient.)

1318
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:30,930
If it's tasty, isn't that what matters?

1319
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:32,130
Sure.

1320
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,870
Not many people know the authentic taste.

1321
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:37,609
What kind of naughty thought is that?

1322
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:40,740
It's not a naughty thought. Even if it's different,

1323
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:43,810
if we add something that has to be good...

1324
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:45,790
If it doesn't work out even after trying.

1325
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:48,819
We need to add this first.

1326
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:50,849
It will take a long time to boil it.

1327
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:52,120
- The tripe?
- Yes.

1328
00:48:52,490 --> 00:48:54,419
(They hurry to prepare the ingredients.)

1329
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:56,660
(The cooking begins.)

00:48:56,690 --> 00:48:59,989
(Tasting session menu: Tripe taco and salsa, mango con Chile)

1331
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:01,899
(Current time: 5pm)

1332
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:04,170
(The first food they will prepare is the tripe tacos.)

1333
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,330
Have you ever touched that?

1334
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:07,170
Tripe?

1335
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:10,021
- Do you need that much?
- Is that what tripe looks like?

1336
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:12,040
Can you cut this with the scissors?

1337
00:49:12,270 --> 00:49:13,369
- Do I cut here?
- Yes.

1338
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:15,109
Is it okay to cut that? I don't think it will cut.

1339
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:16,140
Please cut there.

1340
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:18,510
I will boil this much.

1341
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:20,450
It does have a smell.

1342
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:22,220
- The raw tripe.
- Right.

1343
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:23,689
It does smell.

1344
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:24,750
- Right?
- Yes.

1345
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,289
We have the bay leaves.

1346
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:29,920
(He gets straight to removing the smell.)

1347
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:32,429
(Bay leaves)

1348
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:33,430
(Peppercorns)

1349
00:49:33,431 --> 00:49:34,530
But there's too much water.

1350
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:37,830
How much do we boil this?

1351
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:40,229
- For how long?
- About 40 minutes.

1352
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:41,830
I think we will have to keep tasting it.

1353
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,169
I will taste it along the way.

1354
00:49:44,170 --> 00:49:45,546
(Which flavour is he trying to recreate?)

1355
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:48,280
(The tripe taco place in Mexico)

1356
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:49,909
They boil it on one side,

1357
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:51,980
and they fry it on the other side.

1358
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:55,550
I think they mix both and chop them up.

1359
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:59,620
(That is how he learned the secret of the tripe tacos.)

1360
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:02,660
This one should just be boiled.

1361
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,090
What is this?

1362
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:07,460
This?

1363
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:08,936
- They are Mexican tomatoes.
- Yes.

1364
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,259
- Really?
- Really?

1365
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:12,420
(Tomatillo: A Mexican fruit with crisp, crunchy flesh)

1366
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:15,900
(CEO Lee is curious after seeing the new ingredient.)

1367
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:17,240
Does it taste different?

1368
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:20,680
They look different from normal tomatoes.

1369
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,140
Give it a taste.

1370
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:24,579
They must make the green salsa with this.

1371
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:26,080
- No?
- I think you're right.

1372
00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:30,080
How is it?

1373
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:33,250
It doesn't taste like tomatoes.

1374
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:35,320
It's good.

1375
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:36,919
How is it different from the red tomatoes?

1376
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:39,059
It's very tangy.

1377
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:40,630
(It has a strong, tangy flavour.)

1378
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:44,929
Director, then what time will it be ready to eat?

1379
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:46,869
What time is it now?

1380
00:50:46,870 --> 00:50:49,239
It is 5:25pm.

1381
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,739
It's 5:25pm?

1382
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:51,870
(Current time: 5:25pm)

1383
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:54,310
- At 6:25pm?
- At 6:25pm?

1384
00:50:55,410 --> 00:50:57,009
Please give me some time.

1385
00:50:57,010 --> 00:50:59,450
(The expedition team is given 1 hour.)

1386
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:01,750
What should I do, Kyung Soo?

1387
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:03,450
First of all...

1388
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,850
Do you see the onions over there?

1389
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:08,560
Please peel the onions, and...

1390
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:10,320
How many should I peel?

1391
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:12,990
About half of them.

1392
00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:14,859
That many?

1393
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:16,430
(The director starts assigning tasks.)

1394
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:19,570
(The auditor is assigned the task of peeling the onions.)

1395
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:27,010
(He peels the onions, as the director ordered.)

1396
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:31,450
They sting my eyes.

1397
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:34,019
(Even if the onion aroma is pungent...)

1398
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:35,080
Oh, right.

1399
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:37,180
It's a good thing I brought these today.

1400
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:38,290
What?

1401
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:41,219
(He handles it gracefully.)

1402
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:42,690
That's very multifunctional.

1403
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:44,930
I think this will be enough.

1404
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,930
- I think this is enough.
- Really?

1405
00:51:48,130 --> 00:51:49,359
Don't we have to cut the onions?

1406
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,570
The onions are done.

1407
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,870
Is it okay to leave these here, Kyung Soo?

1408
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,670
Woo Bin needs to...

1409
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,539
- Show me.
- Let me show you.

1410
00:51:58,540 --> 00:51:59,660
(He shows him another task.)

1411
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:01,879
(The director stands in front of the cutting board with a knife.)

1412
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,209
- Here.
- Yes.

1413
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:04,750
- The end here.
- Yes.

1414
00:52:04,810 --> 00:52:05,880
Once.

1415
00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:07,480
Twice.

1416
00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:08,750
- Yes.
- Cut.

1417
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:10,520
Cut in half.

1418
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:11,750
It's complicated.

1419
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:14,960
Then, you just need to divide it into three parts here.

1420
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,989
Like this.

1421
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:19,060
Okay.

1422
00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:24,400
(The auditor carries out what he learned, step by step.)

1423
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:29,840
(While he prepares the lime...)

1424
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:31,540
Gosh, being here,

1425
00:52:33,270 --> 00:52:35,479
it feels like I'm back at home. Goodness.

1426
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:38,010
(CEO Lee gets emotional.)

1427
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:40,180
We used to dominate this place.

1428
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:43,120
(They never did.)

1429
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:45,590
Peel the skin...

1430
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:48,090
and drop them in the hot water, please.

1431
00:52:48,190 --> 00:52:50,890
(The director asks the CEO to wash the vegetables, )

1432
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:53,560
(and CEO Lee takes his spot.)

1433
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:55,430
Also, the cilantro, please.

1434
00:52:56,030 --> 00:52:57,670
Please wash these as well.

1435
00:52:58,470 --> 00:52:59,829
(There is a ton of vegetables to wash.)

1436
00:52:59,830 --> 00:53:00,900
That's it, and...

1437
00:53:01,570 --> 00:53:03,040
It all feels the same.

1438
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:06,310
It's just like the potatoes are switched to tomatoes.

1439
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:08,980
(He remembers the days when they ran the cafeteria.)

1440
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,880
Why am I only washing things?

1441
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,250
What is Kwang Soo doing?

1442
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:16,880
I'm washing peppers.

1443
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:19,590
Do you want to join me here?

1444
00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:21,820
- What?
- Aren't you facing back too much?

1445
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:25,060
No matter where I am, they won't be shooting me.

1446
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:29,460
(CEO Lee is used to this situation.)

1447
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:32,000
I think this will be enough.

1448
00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:33,469
- Do I boil them?
- It's enough.

1449
00:53:33,470 --> 00:53:35,550
(He finished washing the ingredients for the salsa.)

1450
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:41,210
(He suddenly starts to cut something up.)

1451
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:44,280
(He is curious about the taste of the jalapeno peppers.)

1452
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:47,210
(Startled)

1453
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:48,279
Is it spicy?

1454
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:49,479
(Shouting)

1455
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:50,520
Taste it.

1456
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:53,290
(He hurriedly shares the taste.)

1457
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:56,860
- Oh, it's spicy!
- Try this.

1458
00:53:57,590 --> 00:53:58,660
I'll have a little.

1459
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,529
(Have more. No.)

1460
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:03,006
We don't need Cheongyang chilli peppers.

1461
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:05,100
(This is the spiciness of Mexico.)

1462
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:06,969
It's as spicy as Cheongyang chilli peppers.

1463
00:54:06,970 --> 00:54:08,850
(They can foresee a strong taste of the salsa.)

1464
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,069
(Making Salsa)

1465
00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:12,870
(1. Boil the water.)

1466
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:18,910
(2. Add the washed tomatillos and jalapenos.)

1467
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,880
(3. Simmer until soft and tender.)

1468
00:54:23,350 --> 00:54:25,620
(In the meantime, Kyung Soo prepares something else.)

1469
00:54:26,050 --> 00:54:27,420
What are you doing?

1470
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,320
Making stock.

1471
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:32,830
Do you remember the first taco place...

1472
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:35,499
we ate at when we first arrived in Mexico?

1473
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:36,740
- As soon as we arrived?
- Yes.

1474
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:40,429
(The first taco place they went to in Mexico)

1475
00:54:40,430 --> 00:54:41,970
This is salsa.

1476
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:43,670
If we make anchovy broth...

1477
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:46,610
and mix it with some peppers ground in hot water...

1478
00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:49,370
(The director figured out the salsa ingredients right away.)

1479
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:53,680
(He came up with ideas for a Korean-style twist on salsa.)

1480
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:55,019
When I took a bite,

1481
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:56,880
it tasted like...

1482
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,450
Cheongyang chilli peppers ground with anchovy broth.

1483
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:00,959
So, I'm trying to recreate that flavour.

1484
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,060
I did feel like it tasted...

1485
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:05,030
similar to Korean food.

1486
00:55:05,730 --> 00:55:07,999
(Meanwhile, the CEO is about to chop the ingredients he washed.)

1487
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,260
Are these too big?

1488
00:55:09,530 --> 00:55:11,299
(He's having trouble figuring out how small the pieces have to be.)

1489
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:12,329
This big?

1490
00:55:12,330 --> 00:55:13,930
No, these have to be...

1491
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,570
Why do these look wilted?

1492
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,040
Did you wash them thoroughly?

1493
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:20,879
- Where's the bowl?
- Here it is.

1494
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,709
(Feeling self-conscious, Kwang Soo comes back to wash them again.)

1495
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:24,509
- Use this bowl...
- Can I wash them in hot water?

1496
00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:26,610
Of course, not. You have to wash them in cold water.

1497
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:29,180
But I already washed these in hot water.

1498
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,449
Why would you wash vegetables in hot water?

1499
00:55:31,450 --> 00:55:32,850
They'll get wilted.

1500
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,660
Wash them again in cold water.

1501
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:37,629
But my hands were freezing.

1502
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:39,660
(But my hands were freezing.)

1503
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:41,760
Kyung Soo, admit it.

1504
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:45,099
Kwang Soo and I are on a different level.

1505
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:47,200
You should say it out loud.

1506
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:52,039
(Chopping aggressively)

1507
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:55,280
(The auditor's chopping sounds fill the kitchen.)

1508
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:56,440
We're not the same.

1509
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,480
(The auditor's energy is on another level.)

1510
00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:01,280
Get a shot of Woo Bin's forearms.

1511
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:02,519
- They look amazing.
- Hey.

1512
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,050
You're making me self-conscious.

1513
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,150
I'll flex them a bit.

1514
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:09,689
(Woo Bin flexes his forearms as hard as he can.)

1515
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:11,730
That's it.

1516
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:17,160
(Glancing over)

1517
00:56:17,330 --> 00:56:18,700
Woo Bin, can you open this for me?

1518
00:56:19,330 --> 00:56:21,739
(Flexing)

1519
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:25,870
(CEO Lee wants attention too.)

1520
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:27,840
That seems like enough.

1521
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:29,410
- One more thing.
- Sure.

1522
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:32,350
This could be a little complicated.

1523
00:56:33,110 --> 00:56:34,550
You see how...

1524
00:56:34,650 --> 00:56:36,920
I cut this in half? And then...

1525
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:40,090
Just the seeds.

1526
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,519
(What?)

1527
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:43,590
Just the seeds.

1528
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:45,560
Take them out like that?

1529
00:56:45,561 --> 00:56:46,890
- Take them out.
- Okay.

1530
00:56:47,130 --> 00:56:48,929
And then slice it lengthwise.

1531
00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:51,669
(Slice the tomato lengthwise.)

1532
00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:52,970
Do this.

1533
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:55,270
And you know how small the pieces should be...

1534
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:56,700
to fit the tacos, right?

1535
00:56:57,270 --> 00:56:58,439
Do that.

1536
00:56:58,440 --> 00:56:59,539
Just slice them into small pieces.

1537
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:00,739
(Woo Bin is given a challenging task.)

1538
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:02,279
- I'll let you know if I'm confused.
- There's no need to rush.

1539
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:03,310
Okay.

1540
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:05,610
I'll leave you with the tomatoes, then.

1541
00:57:06,410 --> 00:57:08,420
(The auditor is highly trusted by the director.)

1542
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:11,190
(As he was taught, he first removes the seeds.)

1543
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,650
I'm scared, because I've never done this before.

1544
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,830
(Slicing with caution)

1545
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:23,500
(Slowly but surely, the auditor slices the tomatoes.)

1546
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:26,300
It smells good.

1547
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:28,940
Let's make the salsa.

1548
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:32,970
I wonder how this will turn out.

1549
00:57:33,870 --> 00:57:35,710
The skin is very thin too.

1550
00:57:39,310 --> 00:57:42,520
(Kyung Soo removes the fully softened ingredients.)

1551
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:45,519
We're going to grind these now.

1552
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:46,619
Be careful.

1553
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:48,290
That and...

1554
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:50,990
- I'm going to add this too.
- Nice.

1555
00:57:51,490 --> 00:57:52,689
Let's do this and grind them.

1556
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:53,789
That will give it a Korean-style twist.

1557
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:55,800
I'm so curious about what the flavour will be like.

1558
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:57,970
Keep grinding them.

1559
00:57:58,230 --> 00:58:00,300
- It looks legit.
- Right?

1560
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:04,099
It looks like the salsa we had in Mexico.

1561
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:06,540
(The colour resembles salsa.)

1562
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,839
(What does KKPP Foods' salsa taste like...)

1563
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:10,680
(with the director's touch?)

1564
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,479
This is it.

1565
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,219
- This is...
- It is.

1566
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:15,460
The texture they had in Mexico.

1567
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:21,420
(Kyung Soo offers them a taste.)

1568
00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:23,320
Gosh, that's hot.

1569
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:25,190
Gosh, that's hot.

1570
00:58:25,790 --> 00:58:27,429
(The salsa is way hotter than he expected.)

1571
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:28,699
- I think it's ready.
- Yes.

1572
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:29,900
- I think it's good.
- Yes.

1573
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:31,899
- What do you think?
- It's good.

1574
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:33,070
Gosh, it's good.

1575
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:35,000
- It tastes like salsa.
- It's good.

1576
00:58:35,270 --> 00:58:38,440
- It's very similar to that salsa.
- Right.

1577
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:41,040
- So this is how salsa is made.
- Right?

1578
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:43,839
On its own, it's spicier than the salsa we had in Mexico,

1579
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,120
but that's what makes it better.

1580
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:47,349
(The salsa is complete.)

1581
00:58:47,350 --> 00:58:49,430
We can use it right away. It will cool down quickly.

1582
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:52,020
Seeing the onions brings back a nightmare for me.

1583
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,720
(Taking over from Woo Bin, he has the onion nightmare.)

1584
00:58:56,620 --> 00:59:00,160
(He cuts it about 2-3rds of the way down.)

1585
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:04,830
(Kyung Soo has the skill to chop it all at once.)

1586
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:12,710
(The director's chopping sounds are always pleasant to hear.)

1587
00:59:15,810 --> 00:59:17,509
(Sighing)

1588
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:21,350
(The onions are making his eyes water.)

1589
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:25,420
(Kyung Soo resorts to closing his eyes as he chops the onions.)

1590
00:59:26,050 --> 00:59:28,820
(Looking around)

1591
00:59:31,290 --> 00:59:33,160
- Woo Bin, I'll use your sunglasses.
- Sure.

1592
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:36,800
They make a huge difference.

1593
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:41,269
(The director borrows the auditor's sunglasses.)

1594
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:43,499
- These are giving me strength.
- I told you.

1595
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:45,109
They are definitely effective.

1596
00:59:45,110 --> 00:59:47,270
- They boost your confidence.
- That should be enough.

1597
00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:48,410
Yes, that's enough.

1598
00:59:54,010 --> 00:59:55,920
This should be enough.

1599
00:59:57,220 --> 01:00:00,090
(Kyung Soo finishes prepping the onions with the sunglasses on.)

1600
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:03,889
(The director grabs the tongs.)

1601
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:06,660
I think we should...

1602
01:00:07,030 --> 01:00:08,030
Right?

1603
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:11,229
I think that's why...

1604
01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:16,470
(He checks on the boiled tripe.)

1605
01:00:17,470 --> 01:00:20,310
(Kyung Soo cuts off a piece...)

1606
01:00:20,570 --> 01:00:21,579
(Sniffing)

1607
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:23,009
They won't give us anymore.

1608
01:00:23,010 --> 01:00:24,279
(and checks on the smell.)

1609
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:25,680
- Is it okay?
- Yes.

1610
01:00:26,010 --> 01:00:27,050
Great.

1611
01:00:27,110 --> 01:00:30,680
(He tastes the end piece of the tripe.)

1612
01:00:38,590 --> 01:00:40,030
Do we have a pressure cooker here?

1613
01:00:40,290 --> 01:00:41,460
A pressure cooker?

1614
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,400
This won't work.

1615
01:00:49,670 --> 01:00:51,070
Do we have a pressure cooker here?

1616
01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:52,610
A pressure cooker?

1617
01:00:54,110 --> 01:00:56,579
This won't work.

1618
01:00:56,580 --> 01:00:57,679
A pressure cooker? It won't work at all?

1619
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,480
I think the tripe should be boiled for hours.

1620
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:03,520
Even with 40 minutes, it will only make the tripe too tough.

1621
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:05,090
It's too tough?

1622
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:06,590
It's very tough.

1623
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:09,571
I think we should at least try using the pressure cooker.

1624
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:14,900
(The director takes drastic measures.)

1625
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:18,330
We'll set it to fast mode.

1626
01:01:19,330 --> 01:01:21,569
(The director decides to use the pressure cooker.)

1627
01:01:21,570 --> 01:01:23,300
The smell is mostly gone already.

1628
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,069
The high-speed mode seems to be the fastest.

1629
01:01:26,070 --> 01:01:29,040
(Will the tripe be ready on time?)

1630
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:31,079
It's 6:13pm right now.

1631
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:34,550
Should I tell them to come and eat at 6:30pm?

1632
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:36,080
Give us a bit more time.

1633
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:38,119
- Let’s make it 6:50pm sharp.
- At 6:50pm?

1634
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:39,249
Sharp?

1635
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:41,770
(He asks for additional time because of the unexpected issues.)

1636
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:45,059
Kwang Soo, are you done with the cilantro?

1637
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:46,130
Yes.

1638
01:01:47,090 --> 01:01:48,459
- Cut it?
- Remember when we had the tacos?

1639
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:50,400
How the cilantro was cut into small pieces?

1640
01:01:50,430 --> 01:01:51,600
Can you do that?

1641
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:53,269
About...

1642
01:01:53,270 --> 01:01:54,669
(Kyung Soo asks Kwang Soo to prep the last ingredient of the taco.)

1643
01:01:54,670 --> 01:01:56,670
About this small.

1644
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:00,539
(Kwang Soo does what the director asked.)

1645
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:01,609
Slow down.

1646
01:02:01,610 --> 01:02:02,770
No need to use so much force.

1647
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:05,510
Not that slow.

1648
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:07,049
Be kind to them.

1649
01:02:07,050 --> 01:02:09,219
If you use too much force like that,

1650
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:10,350
they'll wilt.

1651
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:13,920
What are you doing?

1652
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:16,820
I'm cutting up the cilantro, but he wants me to be kind about it.

1653
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:19,959
The key to cooking is kindness.

1654
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:21,700
- You didn't know, did you?
- I mean...

1655
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:23,599
It's not like...

1656
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:25,300
I was being unkind.

1657
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,239
(Kind)

1658
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:30,240
(Polite)

1659
01:02:30,241 --> 01:02:31,269
(Nice)

1660
01:02:31,270 --> 01:02:33,409
(We are dedicated to serving you.)

1661
01:02:33,410 --> 01:02:35,740
You can stop. That's enough.

1662
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:37,739
That's perfect.

1663
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:40,309
(The ingredients of the taco are all prepped.)

1664
01:02:40,310 --> 01:02:41,450
One more.

1665
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,150
Aren't we toasting the tortillas?

1666
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:45,950
We'll do that right before we serve the tacos.

1667
01:02:46,090 --> 01:02:47,419
It won't take long.

1668
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:48,589
- I see.
- Yes.

1669
01:02:48,590 --> 01:02:51,160
(Cooking the tripe comes before the tortillas.)

1670
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:52,360
What's that?

1671
01:02:52,430 --> 01:02:53,530
Beef tallow.

1672
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:56,559
- Just a bit.
- It looks like ice cream.

1673
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:57,599
Right?

1674
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:59,240
(Kyung Soo coats the pan in beef tallow.)

1675
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:03,569
(He puts the tripe in the pan.)

1676
01:03:03,570 --> 01:03:04,740
That's cool.

1677
01:03:05,610 --> 01:03:06,870
Gosh, this smells great.

1678
01:03:07,510 --> 01:03:10,409
(The director's eyes are shining.)

1679
01:03:10,410 --> 01:03:12,310
It smells like the Mexican taco place in here!

1680
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:16,350
The filling is coming out.

1681
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:19,050
- Is this okay?
- Gosh, the filling is being fried.

1682
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:21,760
(Hissing)

1683
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:24,189
That's done. It's perfect.

1684
01:03:24,190 --> 01:03:25,910
(The pressure cooker has finished cooking.)

1685
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:34,700
(Is the tripe fully cooked?)

1686
01:03:38,110 --> 01:03:39,240
- Please.
- Please.

1687
01:03:40,540 --> 01:03:42,110
It didn't have a bad odour.

1688
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:45,049
Right. The texture was crunchy too.

1689
01:03:45,050 --> 01:03:46,680
(He takes a bite.)

1690
01:03:47,510 --> 01:03:50,450
(What does the tripe taste like...)

1691
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:53,750
(after being quickly cooked in the pressure cooker?)

1692
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:56,190
This is...

1693
01:03:57,060 --> 01:03:58,090
tender enough.

1694
01:03:59,030 --> 01:04:01,960
(Thanks to his quick thinking, the tripe is complete.)

1695
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:03,830
- Look at this.
- That looks good.

1696
01:04:06,970 --> 01:04:08,070
Gosh.

1697
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:10,039
It smells good.

1698
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:11,546
(Acting Culinary Director, Lee Kwang Soo)

1699
01:04:11,570 --> 01:04:12,610
Yes.

1700
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:15,680
I think cutting this will make it cook faster.

1701
01:04:16,810 --> 01:04:18,680
There are four cameras around you.

1702
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:21,980
Gosh, this is different.

1703
01:04:25,350 --> 01:04:26,749
(Is he putting on a performance?)

1704
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:30,190
(There's nothing to see.)

1705
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:34,160
You have too keep frying these.

1706
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:37,530
(Let the endless tripe-frying begin.)

1707
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:42,639
Woo Bin.

1708
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:44,100
- Can you cut these up?
- Okay.

1709
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:46,310
(Cutting up the boiled tripe into small pieces)

1710
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:51,650
This smells like pork liver.

1711
01:04:52,150 --> 01:04:54,850
(Cutting them up into bite-sized pieces)

1712
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:57,020
This is a workout for your forearms.

1713
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:58,990
I can skip workout today.

1714
01:05:00,590 --> 01:05:03,490
(The tripe gets smaller as Woo Bin works it with his forearms.)

1715
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,630
Do you need these to be smaller, Director?

1716
01:05:06,290 --> 01:05:07,290
Should they be smaller?

1717
01:05:07,291 --> 01:05:08,931
(Waiting for the director's confirmation)

1718
01:05:13,030 --> 01:05:14,670
Gosh, it's good.

1719
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:16,770
It tastes very savoury...

1720
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:18,639
because it's mixed with the filling.

1721
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,610
(The tripe is all prepped.)

1722
01:05:21,910 --> 01:05:24,580
(All that's left is the fried tripe.)

1723
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:25,880
And...

1724
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:28,950
Let me see if this works.

1725
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:32,420
(He puts the fried tripe in a container.)

1726
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:36,890
You're supposed to...

1727
01:05:37,990 --> 01:05:41,190
chop these with big knives like this.

1728
01:05:41,430 --> 01:05:42,700
That's faster.

1729
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,260
But we can't do that.

1730
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:46,570
Let's try this.

1731
01:05:46,830 --> 01:05:49,111
(He's going to chop the tripe using a vegetable chopper.)

1732
01:05:49,270 --> 01:05:51,640
I have to make sure this is fully closed.

1733
01:05:52,170 --> 01:05:53,540
Let's do this, and then...

1734
01:05:59,750 --> 01:06:01,919
(Exclaiming)

1735
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:02,980
That's nice.

1736
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:04,949
It works.

1737
01:06:04,950 --> 01:06:05,990
That's perfect.

1738
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:07,449
(The director is great at his job, making do with what he has.)

1739
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:09,290
- Is that it?
- It will taste the same anyway.

1740
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:18,299
(The director...)

1741
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:20,700
(keeps chopping the tripe non-stop.)

1742
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:23,570
We have to combine the two flavours.

1743
01:06:24,070 --> 01:06:25,140
Then, it's done.

1744
01:06:25,170 --> 01:06:27,940
(Once the vigorous chopping of the fried tripe is done, )

1745
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:29,040
All right.

1746
01:06:29,041 --> 01:06:30,579
(the tripe taco preparation is complete.)

1747
01:06:30,580 --> 01:06:31,880
Using the fat...

1748
01:06:33,810 --> 01:06:35,350
What should we do with the mangos?

1749
01:06:36,850 --> 01:06:38,919
I peeled them like apples.

1750
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:39,950
I see.

1751
01:06:39,990 --> 01:06:42,960
(The director demonstrates, )

1752
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:46,190
(and the auditor follows exactly.)

1753
01:06:47,190 --> 01:06:50,630
(Soon, the mangos are ready.)

1754
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:53,869
- Don't we need ramyeon seasoning?
- I'm making it right now.

1755
01:06:53,870 --> 01:06:56,170
- Good.
- You're making the seasoning?

1756
01:06:57,270 --> 01:06:59,910
(A mango stand in Playa del Carmen)

1757
01:07:00,570 --> 01:07:03,331
This isn't just plain chilli powder. It tastes like ramyeon seasoning.

1758
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:05,710
We can make this in Korea.

1759
01:07:06,510 --> 01:07:09,080
(The magical powder they encountered in Mexico)

1760
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:10,449
I'm making it right now.

1761
01:07:10,450 --> 01:07:12,690
- Good.
- You're making the seasoning?

1762
01:07:12,990 --> 01:07:14,219
Yes, I'm going to try it.

1763
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:15,420
(Paprika)

1764
01:07:15,490 --> 01:07:17,719
(Salt)

1765
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:19,690
(Sugar)

1766
01:07:20,090 --> 01:07:21,399
And a tiny bit of flavouring.

1767
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:23,000
(Chicken stock)

1768
01:07:23,030 --> 01:07:25,370
(He's using his sense of taste to recreate the flavour.)

1769
01:07:28,170 --> 01:07:29,770
I don't think...

1770
01:07:30,570 --> 01:07:32,270
the flavour was paprika.

1771
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:35,879
(How does the special powder...)

1772
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:38,610
(that he recreated from memory taste?)

1773
01:07:38,750 --> 01:07:40,010
It's tasty,

1774
01:07:40,650 --> 01:07:41,720
but it's not the same.

1775
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:52,590
(The employees taste the powder.)

1776
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:56,399
I don't think the smoky aroma of the paprika belongs here.

1777
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:57,520
The aroma is kind of strong.

1778
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,400
- Right?
- What's this aroma?

1779
01:07:59,730 --> 01:08:00,830
Paprika.

1780
01:08:01,230 --> 01:08:02,470
If I...

1781
01:08:04,270 --> 01:08:06,009
(He sprinkles the powder on a piece of mango...)

1782
01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:08,170
(to compare the flavour with what he tasted in Mexico.)

1783
01:08:08,210 --> 01:08:10,140
No, this isn't it.

1784
01:08:10,610 --> 01:08:11,749
The aroma is too strong, right?

1785
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:13,179
(Kyung Soo's first attempt failed.)

1786
01:08:13,180 --> 01:08:15,149
(He begins his second attempt right away.)

1787
01:08:15,150 --> 01:08:17,850
(This time, he uses chilli powder.)

1788
01:08:18,190 --> 01:08:21,860
(The rest of the ingredients are the same.)

1789
01:08:22,390 --> 01:08:24,260
(Again, Kyung Soo grabs a piece of mango, )

1790
01:08:24,690 --> 01:08:26,890
(sprinkles lime juice on it, )

1791
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:30,230
(and tries the second batch.)

1792
01:08:33,470 --> 01:08:35,439
(How does the second batch of powder taste?)

1793
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:37,200
It's good. I like it.

1794
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:38,440
I think this is it.

1795
01:08:38,870 --> 01:08:40,140
Honestly. This is it.

1796
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:41,369
This is it. I'm sure of it.

1797
01:08:41,370 --> 01:08:42,910
(Woo Bin takes a bite.)

1798
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:44,210
- This is it.
- This is it?

1799
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:46,450
- This is it.
- This is good.

1800
01:08:47,050 --> 01:08:48,730
This is it. Go ahead and tell me it's not.

1801
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:50,320
I won't let it slide.

1802
01:08:51,220 --> 01:08:52,349
It's so good.

1803
01:08:52,350 --> 01:08:54,749
Right, we had lime juice too.

1804
01:08:54,750 --> 01:08:56,759
(The director samples it as well.)

1805
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:59,530
(Finally, he successfully recreated the special seasoning.)

1806
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:02,500
(He finishes off by sprinkling the special powder on the mangos.)

1807
01:09:02,530 --> 01:09:06,330
(The mango con Chile is complete.)

1808
01:09:07,070 --> 01:09:08,370
We should try the tripe taco.

1809
01:09:08,970 --> 01:09:10,669
Let's try it.

1810
01:09:10,670 --> 01:09:13,150
(Before they serve, they do a final check of the tripe tacos.)

1811
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:17,080
(1. Toast the tortilla for a crispy texture.)

1812
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:19,649
Gosh, everything is really ready.

1813
01:09:19,650 --> 01:09:20,749
(2. Put the boiled and fried tripe mixture on the tortilla.)

1814
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:22,380
It looks perfect.

1815
01:09:23,550 --> 01:09:25,150
And then onions.

1816
01:09:25,590 --> 01:09:26,689
I think we're done.

1817
01:09:26,690 --> 01:09:28,020
(3. Add onions and tomatoes.)

1818
01:09:28,420 --> 01:09:32,390
(4. Drizzle the spicy salsa on top.)

1819
01:09:32,730 --> 01:09:37,130
(Lastly, add cilantro and lime juice to your liking.)

1820
01:09:37,330 --> 01:09:39,770
This looks just like the tacos we had in Mexico.

1821
01:09:40,730 --> 01:09:43,470
And then, we eat it like this.

1822
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:47,270
Here.

1823
01:09:48,580 --> 01:09:52,180
(Did they successfully recreate the flavour they tasted in Mexico?)

1824
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:54,310
(Unbelievable)

1825
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:00,249
- My goodness.
- Gosh, this is so good.

1826
01:10:00,250 --> 01:10:01,390
Gosh, this is really good.

1827
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:03,390
Where are we? Mexico?

1828
01:10:03,690 --> 01:10:04,759
Thank you.

1829
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:06,560
(The flavour fills him with gratitude.)

1830
01:10:06,930 --> 01:10:08,729
All we have to do is toast the tortillas well.

1831
01:10:08,730 --> 01:10:11,700
Hey, I think this tastes better than the one we had before.

1832
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:13,329
(They're all ready for the tasting session.)

1833
01:10:13,330 --> 01:10:14,600
It's really good.

1834
01:10:15,470 --> 01:10:16,700
It tastes like meat.

1835
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:20,140
- This. Alongside other tasks, - That's cool.

1836
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:22,680
We also keep doing the dishes. This is good.

1837
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:24,560
This is how it's supposed to be.

1838
01:10:26,710 --> 01:10:29,519
It's been a while since I've seen people clean...

1839
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,279
- as they cook in the kitchen.
- Same.

1840
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,850
(The auditor is naturally organised.)

1841
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:35,320
(He works tirelessly to prepare until the very last moment.)

1842
01:10:37,090 --> 01:10:38,690
This should keep the drinks really cold.

1843
01:10:39,630 --> 01:10:42,629
(Woo Bin prepares welcome drinks for the tasting panel.)

1844
01:10:42,630 --> 01:10:44,530
Have you done this before?

1845
01:10:46,030 --> 01:10:48,576
- I've worked many part-time jobs.
- He's the master of part-time jobs.

1846
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:51,470
You're good at this.

1847
01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:54,570
When the kitchen is clean...

1848
01:10:55,510 --> 01:10:57,280
When a kitchen is organised,

1849
01:10:57,510 --> 01:10:59,750
the food tastes better, you know?

1850
01:11:01,010 --> 01:11:03,079
That's why you keep washing the dishes.

1851
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:04,179
Yes.

1852
01:11:04,180 --> 01:11:05,366
(He even possesses a strong sense of hygiene.)

1853
01:11:05,390 --> 01:11:07,619
- How much time do we have left?
- How much time?

1854
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:08,690
You have three minutes.

1855
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:10,360
I'll start toasting the tortillas.

1856
01:11:10,361 --> 01:11:12,230
(The director begins toasting the tortillas.)

1857
01:11:13,030 --> 01:11:16,859
(With CEO Lee finishing the last preparations, )

1858
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:19,700
(they're all set for the tasting session.)

1859
01:11:20,070 --> 01:11:21,399
I think they just tossed the ingredients like this.

1860
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,070
- Yes, that's it.
- Right?

1861
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:25,010
And then, like this.

1862
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:27,069
- Right? They served it like this.
- Yes, they did.

1863
01:11:27,070 --> 01:11:28,640
- Like this.
- Yes.

1864
01:11:29,010 --> 01:11:30,539
This is how they did it.

1865
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:32,626
(They try to mimic the way the tacos were served in Mexico.)

1866
01:11:32,650 --> 01:11:33,850
Gosh, the smell.

1867
01:11:34,110 --> 01:11:35,449
Not bad, right? Pretty convincing?

1868
01:11:35,450 --> 01:11:37,720
- You look like a taco stand owner.
- Right.

1869
01:11:38,550 --> 01:11:40,690
(It's turned into a taco place.)

1870
01:11:42,190 --> 01:11:46,530
(The tasting panel follow the smell of tacos and enters.)

1871
01:11:47,660 --> 01:11:49,159
Hi.

1872
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:51,059
- Welcome.
- Hello.

1873
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:52,529
- Hello.
- Hello.

1874
01:11:52,530 --> 01:11:54,800
(Today's tasting panel have arrived.)

1875
01:11:55,170 --> 01:11:56,340
Eat. Dig in.

1876
01:11:56,570 --> 01:11:59,070
This is salsa.

1877
01:11:59,270 --> 01:12:01,309
It's spicy, so if you like spicy food, drizzle a lot of it.

1878
01:12:01,310 --> 01:12:02,510
Are these jalapenos?

1879
01:12:02,740 --> 01:12:04,480
Yes, it's salsa made with jalapenos.

1880
01:12:05,410 --> 01:12:07,710
And at your seats...

1881
01:12:08,010 --> 01:12:10,120
are mangos with special seasoning.

1882
01:12:10,750 --> 01:12:13,550
I can't really explain the specific details.

1883
01:12:14,150 --> 01:12:15,559
Over there.

1884
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:16,659
(Kwang Soo adds a touch of mystery to the food.)

1885
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:18,759
That's why you need forks. Enjoy.

1886
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:20,090
Thank you for the food.

1887
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:23,860
(The senior accountant is here.)

1888
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:26,430
(The CEO of the head office is here too.)

1889
01:12:27,330 --> 01:12:29,340
- Jun Wi, enjoy the food.
- Hi.

1890
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:31,909
You know how to eat this, right?

1891
01:12:31,910 --> 01:12:33,486
(The key figures of the tasting session have arrived.)

1892
01:12:33,510 --> 01:12:34,710
CEO Ko, hello.

1893
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:37,080
Hello.

1894
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:39,750
You won't regret this.

1895
01:12:40,150 --> 01:12:42,710
(It's time to show them the results of their Mexico expedition.)

1896
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:48,360
(The tasting session begins.)

1897
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:50,659
- Does anyone want drinks?
- What do you think of the food?

1898
01:12:50,660 --> 01:12:53,190
(Taking a huge bite)

1899
01:12:53,890 --> 01:12:55,759
- It's good.
- It's good.

1900
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:56,860
It's good.

1901
01:12:58,930 --> 01:13:01,770
(The VIP of the tasting session has taken a seat at the table.)

1902
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:03,739
You have to sprinkle lime juice.

1903
01:13:03,740 --> 01:13:05,916
You have to squeeze the lime over the taco before you eat it.

1904
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:07,010
What lime?

1905
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:08,909
- The lime's over here.
- It's next to the taco.

1906
01:13:08,910 --> 01:13:10,040
I see.

1907
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:15,620
(Squeezing the lime by standard procedure)

1908
01:13:18,690 --> 01:13:23,320
(Taking a big bite)

1909
01:13:23,860 --> 01:13:25,889
(Exclaiming)

1910
01:13:25,890 --> 01:13:29,600
(Nodding in satisfaction)

1911
01:13:30,430 --> 01:13:34,169
(He has another bite right away.)

1912
01:13:34,170 --> 01:13:35,199
It's good.

1913
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:36,440
(Exclaiming)

1914
01:13:36,670 --> 01:13:38,269
- It's good.
- It's good.

1915
01:13:38,270 --> 01:13:40,439
- How is it? Good?
- It's good.

1916
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:41,810
The tripe is really good.

1917
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:43,609
(Agreed)

1918
01:13:43,610 --> 01:13:44,680
It's so good.

1919
01:13:44,940 --> 01:13:46,110
It's spicy, but good.

1920
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,980
(The head office CEO evaluates it by emptying the plate.)

1921
01:13:50,380 --> 01:13:52,290
Isn't he handsome?

1922
01:13:52,350 --> 01:13:53,450
He's really handsome.

1923
01:13:53,590 --> 01:13:56,189
- You like handsome people.
- You like handsome people.

1924
01:13:56,190 --> 01:13:57,589
(Nodding)

1925
01:13:57,590 --> 01:13:58,759
Isn't that obvious?

1926
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:00,429
All three of them are handsome.

1927
01:14:00,430 --> 01:14:01,529
(Winning favours with his face)

1928
01:14:01,530 --> 01:14:03,400
- Doh Kyung Soo too.
- Right.

1929
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:08,200
(The senior accountant sits on the other side.)

1930
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:13,939
(He has the tripe taco experience.)

1931
01:14:13,940 --> 01:14:16,480
(Does it taste the same as the one he had in Mexico?)

1932
01:14:17,910 --> 01:14:20,080
(Exclaiming)

1933
01:14:20,110 --> 01:14:21,750
The sauce is really good.

1934
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:23,180
I know. The sauce is tasty.

1935
01:14:23,350 --> 01:14:25,150
(Nodding)

1936
01:14:25,450 --> 01:14:28,760
It's hard to make good salsa.

1937
01:14:28,820 --> 01:14:30,890
It tastes like local.

1938
01:14:31,190 --> 01:14:32,290
Hello.

1939
01:14:32,630 --> 01:14:33,729
- Oh, hi.
- This is good.

1940
01:14:33,730 --> 01:14:35,159
(This is good!)

1941
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:38,100
(It's good enough to make the senior accountant nod.)

1942
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:42,370
They're having a beer.

1943
01:14:44,370 --> 01:14:48,510
(The tasting session is turning into team dinner.)

1944
01:14:49,940 --> 01:14:51,740
They're considering this a restaurant.

1945
01:14:52,910 --> 01:14:54,726
- That's what happened last time.
- I haven't felt it in a while.

1946
01:14:54,750 --> 01:14:56,549
(The cafeteria vibe after a long time)

1947
01:14:56,550 --> 01:14:57,680
It's been a while.

1948
01:14:58,220 --> 01:14:59,220
Totally.

1949
01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:00,220
Are you done?

1950
01:15:00,221 --> 01:15:01,589
- What?
- Are you done?

1951
01:15:01,590 --> 01:15:02,660
Yes.

1952
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:03,959
Already?

1953
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:05,960
You should've savoured it.

1954
01:15:06,490 --> 01:15:07,630
Do you want more?

1955
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:12,330
(Everyone already emptied their plates.)

1956
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,570
- I want more.
- Get more.

1957
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:18,440
(One serving is not enough.)

1958
01:15:19,110 --> 01:15:21,340
(CEO Lee stares at the table for a while.)

1959
01:15:21,570 --> 01:15:23,310
Do you want more?

1960
01:15:25,810 --> 01:15:28,550
(Shall we?)

1961
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:31,019
(People who want more are getting a refill.)

1962
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:32,580
- There's more.
- They're getting more.

1963
01:15:32,650 --> 01:15:34,120
- Yes.
- Add the sauce.

1964
01:15:35,050 --> 01:15:36,090
How is it?

1965
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:37,460
The meat is tasty.

1966
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:38,590
Not bad.

1967
01:15:39,890 --> 01:15:43,060
(Making the taco without hesitation)

1968
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:44,530
Is it only tripe?

1969
01:15:45,130 --> 01:15:46,130
(Trying to talk to the chef)

1970
01:15:46,131 --> 01:15:47,299
I'm sorry,

1971
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:49,570
but I don't know where to start.

1972
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,270
- No. I'm the CEO.
- Okay.

1973
01:15:52,770 --> 01:15:54,739
- I love the texture.
- You can't talk to him directly.

1974
01:15:54,740 --> 01:15:55,909
- To the chef?
- It has a texture.

1975
01:15:55,910 --> 01:15:57,040
Here you are.

1976
01:15:57,380 --> 01:15:58,410
Thank you.

1977
01:16:00,010 --> 01:16:01,479
(Everything the chef can do is the hand gesture.)

1978
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:02,520
Here.

1979
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:04,919
Jun Wi, how is it?

1980
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:05,949
It's good.

1981
01:16:05,950 --> 01:16:07,326
(The senior accountant is getting a refill.)

1982
01:16:07,350 --> 01:16:09,320
How similar is it?

1983
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:11,759
About 85 percent.

1984
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:12,890
Did you say 85?

1985
01:16:13,890 --> 01:16:15,660
- Yes. Compared to the original.
- Right?

1986
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,129
(Blocking)

1987
01:16:17,130 --> 01:16:19,170
I'm sorry, but if it's only 85, we can't serve you.

1988
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:20,499
What?

1989
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:22,220
But if it's 85 percent on your first try...

1990
01:16:22,740 --> 01:16:23,869
That is...

1991
01:16:23,870 --> 01:16:25,070
a very...

1992
01:16:25,340 --> 01:16:27,239
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1993
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:28,910
(It's still pretty high.)

1994
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:31,410
How do you feel about Jun Wi's score?

1995
01:16:31,910 --> 01:16:33,250
Jun Wi is over.

1996
01:16:33,980 --> 01:16:36,019
How can he say 85 after trying it?

1997
01:16:36,020 --> 01:16:37,219
Who does he think he is?

1998
01:16:37,220 --> 01:16:38,950
(Who does he think he is?)

1999
01:16:39,290 --> 01:16:40,949
Only when he has money,

2000
01:16:40,950 --> 01:16:42,159
he has the power.

2001
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:43,359
You received all the money you needed.

2002
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:44,590
(Sullen big time)

2003
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:46,759
Next time, let's put...

2004
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:48,560
Jun Wi's photo by the entrance.

2005
01:16:48,630 --> 01:16:49,800
"He's not allowed here."

2006
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:52,530
- The restaurants have a blacklist.
- Yes.

2007
01:16:53,030 --> 01:16:55,639
That's up to the restaurant.

2008
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:57,400
(He's on the blacklist even before he knew.)

2009
01:17:01,670 --> 01:17:07,250
(Trying it himself because he can't believe it)

2010
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:08,920
I'm not even lying.

2011
01:17:09,450 --> 01:17:11,380
This is better than what we had there.

2012
01:17:12,420 --> 01:17:13,750
This is 100 for sure.

2013
01:17:13,950 --> 01:17:15,120
It's tasty.

2014
01:17:15,190 --> 01:17:16,290
It's so good.

2015
01:17:17,190 --> 01:17:18,589
Try it. You should try it.

2016
01:17:18,590 --> 01:17:20,390
(The employees are shocked by the 85 points.)

2017
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:21,559
It's good.

2018
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:23,260
(The truth is, everyone is enjoying it.)

2019
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:24,700
It's savoury.

2020
01:17:26,470 --> 01:17:28,470
(The tripe tacos are receiving a good review.)

2021
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:31,699
Only the salsa is a bit different.

2022
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:33,139
- The rest is similar.
- It is...

2023
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:34,439
almost identical to the original.

2024
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:38,209
- Right. You've tried both.
- Because the chilli is different.

2025
01:17:38,210 --> 01:17:41,550
(They incarnated the taste they had in Mexico almost the same.)

2026
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:43,850
- Isn't it similar, Jun Wi?
- Yes.

2027
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:47,389
The tortilla is kind of different.

2028
01:17:47,390 --> 01:17:48,889
(Laughing)

2029
01:17:48,890 --> 01:17:52,059
- But it's just as good.
- It's all good.

2030
01:17:52,060 --> 01:17:53,289
Exactly.

2031
01:17:53,290 --> 01:17:54,990
- Only the sauce is different.
- Yes.

2032
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,000
Is that chilli powder?

2033
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,070
Mango?

2034
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:01,800
Is that a mango?

2035
01:18:01,801 --> 01:18:03,169
Chilli powder on the mango?

2036
01:18:03,170 --> 01:18:04,300
It's seasoned.

2037
01:18:06,310 --> 01:18:08,610
(Nom)

2038
01:18:09,980 --> 01:18:11,180
How is it?

2039
01:18:11,710 --> 01:18:12,979
It's sweet and salty.

2040
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:14,580
Is it sweet and salty?

2041
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:21,119
The mango is actually good.

2042
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:22,889
- It's good.
- Yes.

2043
01:18:22,890 --> 01:18:24,319
- It's a good choice.
- Yes.

2044
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:26,060
(It became a wonderful dessert.)

2045
01:18:26,390 --> 01:18:28,230
- What?
- To go.

2046
01:18:28,590 --> 01:18:29,699
To go?

2047
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:31,760
(A takeout request after the satisfactory meal)

2048
01:18:31,830 --> 01:18:33,869
- Are you taking it home?
- No.

2049
01:18:33,870 --> 01:18:36,199
There is someone who never comes down...

2050
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:37,800
- on the third floor.
- I see.

2051
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:40,969
The person who wants to try it is on the third floor.

2052
01:18:40,970 --> 01:18:42,809
(Good enough to get it for the employee working overtime)

2053
01:18:42,810 --> 01:18:44,079
This is...

2054
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:46,049
my first time trying the tripe taco, and it's really good.

2055
01:18:46,050 --> 01:18:47,180
- Really?
- Yes.

2056
01:18:47,510 --> 01:18:48,879
(Finally glowing after the compliment)

2057
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:50,050
It's really good.

2058
01:18:51,380 --> 01:18:52,549
Thank you.

2059
01:18:52,550 --> 01:18:54,490
(The tasting session ends on a successful note.)

2060
01:18:54,590 --> 01:18:55,760
It's really good.

2061
01:18:55,820 --> 01:18:57,100
- Is it really that good?
- Yes.

2062
01:18:57,520 --> 01:18:59,759
Young people will like it.

2063
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:01,130
It's good, but...

2064
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:03,200
does it have a business value?

2065
01:19:04,730 --> 01:19:06,629
After considering the labour cost...

2066
01:19:06,630 --> 01:19:08,029
and the rent.

2067
01:19:08,030 --> 01:19:09,669
Does it still have a business value?

2068
01:19:09,670 --> 01:19:11,870
(The head office CEO tenaciously focuses on his job.)

2069
01:19:12,110 --> 01:19:13,169
Exactly.

2070
01:19:13,170 --> 01:19:16,080
(When the tasting session is almost done...)

2071
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:20,310
(The 1st KKPP Foods' Night)

2072
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:23,549
Thankfully, the employees...

2073
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:25,219
enjoyed the meal.

2074
01:19:25,220 --> 01:19:26,749
- Thank you.
- Now, only...

2075
01:19:26,750 --> 01:19:29,659
the KKPP Foods employees need to eat.

2076
01:19:29,660 --> 01:19:30,920
Before they eat,

2077
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:33,930
this is the time to wrap up.

2078
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:37,500
You evaluated the employees earlier.

2079
01:19:37,660 --> 01:19:39,046
- The capability evaluation.
- Yes.

2080
01:19:39,070 --> 01:19:41,400
We'll have the time...

2081
01:19:41,830 --> 01:19:44,339
to announce the capability evaluation.

2082
01:19:44,340 --> 01:19:46,069
- Is it meant to be announced?
- Yes.

2083
01:19:46,070 --> 01:19:49,079
The one who's most complimented...

2084
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:50,579
will be awarded.

2085
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:51,780
Really?

2086
01:19:52,410 --> 01:19:54,209
Oh, he said we were doing something.

2087
01:19:54,210 --> 01:19:56,370
(Before making the tacos, the KKPP Foods employees...)

2088
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:59,689
(In their own secret spaces...)

2089
01:19:59,690 --> 01:20:00,690
Yes.

2090
01:20:00,691 --> 01:20:03,490
In Episode Three, after the project...

2091
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:06,960
I didn't know about this.

2092
01:20:07,990 --> 01:20:11,230
"KKPP Foods International Expedition Capability Evaluation."

2093
01:20:11,460 --> 01:20:13,729
"The below is the peer review for the KKPP Foods employees..."

2094
01:20:13,730 --> 01:20:16,639
"to evaluate the 2025 Mexico international expedition..."

2095
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:18,100
"capability horizontally."

2096
01:20:18,770 --> 01:20:20,669
If you take it seriously,

2097
01:20:20,670 --> 01:20:22,339
it'll be reflected in the performance evaluation.

2098
01:20:22,340 --> 01:20:23,956
(It'll be reflected in the performance evaluation.)

2099
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:26,010
First, the director's weakness.

2100
01:20:29,050 --> 01:20:30,850
I'm stuck with the strength already.

2101
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:33,390
(Stuck with the CEO's strength)

2102
01:20:33,450 --> 01:20:34,989
You're not going to reveal this, right?

2103
01:20:34,990 --> 01:20:36,220
It's anonymous, right?

2104
01:20:37,690 --> 01:20:39,489
You're not going to reveal it or anything, right?

2105
01:20:39,490 --> 01:20:42,399
(Everyone seemed to care about anonymity.)

2106
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:43,729
It'll be kept anonymously, right?

2107
01:20:43,730 --> 01:20:44,760
Anonymous.

2108
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,800
All right. First,

2109
01:20:46,870 --> 01:20:49,039
let's take a look at your peer review.

2110
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:50,639
The evaluator is...

2111
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:52,769
kept anonymously.

2112
01:20:52,770 --> 01:20:53,969
CEO Lee Kwang Soo.

2113
01:20:53,970 --> 01:20:55,780
Evaluator One. The strength.

2114
01:20:56,140 --> 01:20:58,579
"As the CEO, he leads his employees..."

2115
01:20:58,580 --> 01:21:00,449
"and keeps the company atmosphere good."

2116
01:21:00,450 --> 01:21:01,450
Good.

2117
01:21:01,451 --> 01:21:02,619
It's a compliment.

2118
01:21:02,620 --> 01:21:04,326
(Automatically applauding to the compliment)

2119
01:21:04,350 --> 01:21:06,649
- "However," - I know what it means.

2120
01:21:06,650 --> 01:21:07,749
"he somewhat confuses his employees..."

2121
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:10,390
"with his curiosity."

2122
01:21:10,460 --> 01:21:13,130
"But that also helps the international expedition,"

2123
01:21:13,230 --> 01:21:14,730
"so it can't be a weakness."

2124
01:21:15,460 --> 01:21:17,230
That means I have no weakness.

2125
01:21:17,830 --> 01:21:20,129
- Aside from you...
- Really?

2126
01:21:20,130 --> 01:21:21,400
Is it one of you?

2127
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:23,869
(Overwhelmed)

2128
01:21:23,870 --> 01:21:25,370
Why am I getting overwhelmed?

2129
01:21:26,940 --> 01:21:28,669
Let's read the second evaluator.

2130
01:21:28,670 --> 01:21:29,679
The strength.

2131
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:31,609
"He has too many opinions,"

2132
01:21:31,610 --> 01:21:34,549
"but thanks to him, we got unexpected experiences..."

2133
01:21:34,550 --> 01:21:36,049
"like seeing rare animals..."

2134
01:21:36,050 --> 01:21:37,820
"or historical sites that are hard to see."

2135
01:21:38,050 --> 01:21:39,389
"But that doesn't happen often."

2136
01:21:39,390 --> 01:21:40,749
(Strength)

2137
01:21:40,750 --> 01:21:42,859
In brackets, four percent contribution.

2138
01:21:42,860 --> 01:21:45,590
(Punishing)

2139
01:21:45,630 --> 01:21:46,759
It wasn't me.

2140
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:48,389
- Four percent contribution is you.
- It wasn't me.

2141
01:21:48,390 --> 01:21:50,300
Only you'd write "Four percent contribution."

2142
01:21:50,630 --> 01:21:53,199
(The anonymity is not guaranteed for some reason.)

2143
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:54,400
The weakness.

2144
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:56,200
"Many. Just too many."

2145
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:57,899
"Too many opinions."

2146
01:21:57,900 --> 01:22:00,140
"Too selfish to consider his employees."

2147
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:03,879
(Running at full speed)

2148
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:05,040
(Laughing)

2149
01:22:06,010 --> 01:22:07,109
Where are you going?

2150
01:22:07,110 --> 01:22:08,209
That's got to be you.

2151
01:22:08,210 --> 01:22:09,420
No.

2152
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:12,689
- We never know who wrote it.
- Right.

2153
01:22:12,690 --> 01:22:15,289
- Right.
- This is anonymous.

2154
01:22:15,290 --> 01:22:16,520
I have no idea who wrote it.

2155
01:22:17,890 --> 01:22:20,189
The evaluations on Auditor Kim Woo Bin.

2156
01:22:20,190 --> 01:22:21,930
Evaluator One. The strength.

2157
01:22:22,330 --> 01:22:24,999
"Fulfilling his duty as an auditor."

2158
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,569
"Managing finance, collecting receipts,"

2159
01:22:26,570 --> 01:22:28,400
"and meetings with Jun Wi."

2160
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:29,869
"Bad at the stopwatch game."

2161
01:22:29,870 --> 01:22:31,740
(Strength)

2162
01:22:31,770 --> 01:22:32,809
- That's...
- Because...

2163
01:22:32,810 --> 01:22:34,069
- Oh, it's a strength?
- if you're bad at it,

2164
01:22:34,070 --> 01:22:36,010
- it works for others.
- Right.

2165
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:38,480
I love it when Woo Bin's bad at the stopwatch game.

2166
01:22:39,180 --> 01:22:40,180
The weakness.

2167
01:22:40,181 --> 01:22:41,680
"Disobedience."

2168
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:44,120
"Taking too long to get prepared."

2169
01:22:44,350 --> 01:22:45,650
"Too much fashion."

2170
01:22:45,950 --> 01:22:48,050
"Too much protein consumption."

2171
01:22:48,620 --> 01:22:49,890
"Arms too thick."

2172
01:22:50,190 --> 01:22:52,189
(Punishing)

2173
01:22:52,190 --> 01:22:55,859
(Evaluator 1 gets punished in the end.)

2174
01:22:55,860 --> 01:22:57,459
Those are his weaknesses.

2175
01:22:57,460 --> 01:22:59,500
But that's cute.

2176
01:22:59,630 --> 01:23:01,230
The strength by Evaluator Two.

2177
01:23:01,730 --> 01:23:02,939
"Accurate calculation."

2178
01:23:02,940 --> 01:23:04,499
"Looking after the junior employee."

2179
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:05,910
"Often in agreement."

2180
01:23:06,210 --> 01:23:08,410
In brackets, 48 percent contribution.

2181
01:23:09,180 --> 01:23:11,780
(The 4-percent contributor gets angry.)

2182
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:14,909
His contribution rate is 12 times higher...

2183
01:23:14,910 --> 01:23:16,249
compared to CEO Lee Kwang Soo.

2184
01:23:16,250 --> 01:23:17,279
The weakness.

2185
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:18,679
"Because he's too accurate, sometimes..."

2186
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:20,190
"very rarely, he's tiring."

2187
01:23:20,890 --> 01:23:21,989
That is...

2188
01:23:21,990 --> 01:23:23,489
- Well...
- That's what he wrote.

2189
01:23:23,490 --> 01:23:26,390
Lastly, Director Doh Kyung Soo.

2190
01:23:26,660 --> 01:23:28,690
Evaluator One. The strength.

2191
01:23:28,930 --> 01:23:31,899
"With his high executive ability, he suggests directions..."

2192
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:33,476
"to the other two, who are rather indecisive,"

2193
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:35,060
"and led a diverse culture expedition."

2194
01:23:35,530 --> 01:23:36,970
"No weakness."

2195
01:23:38,140 --> 01:23:40,710
(The director with no flaw?)

2196
01:23:40,940 --> 01:23:42,716
Let's take a look at Evaluator Two's comment.

2197
01:23:42,740 --> 01:23:43,780
The strength.

2198
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:46,579
"Internet search, finding routes, and making reservations."

2199
01:23:46,580 --> 01:23:50,020
"He fulfilled his duty necessary for the trip."

2200
01:23:50,150 --> 01:23:51,430
The weakness, on the other hand.

2201
01:23:52,150 --> 01:23:54,220
"Stubborn and obsessed."

2202
01:23:54,950 --> 01:23:56,459
"Disobedience."

2203
01:23:56,460 --> 01:23:57,590
(The weakness)

2204
01:23:57,660 --> 01:23:59,890
"Not taking care of precious items preciously."

2205
01:24:00,130 --> 01:24:01,770
"Not being able to fight off drowsiness."

2206
01:24:01,890 --> 01:24:04,359
"Using the room alone without hesitation."

2207
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:06,600
(The weakness)

2208
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:09,670
Those are his weaknesses.

2209
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:13,309
We looked at the peer review.

2210
01:24:13,310 --> 01:24:14,469
What do you think of it?

2211
01:24:14,470 --> 01:24:16,280
Director Doh Kyung Soo, what do you think?

2212
01:24:16,910 --> 01:24:18,840
I like Evaluator One.

2213
01:24:19,750 --> 01:24:21,510
I don't like Evaluator Two.

2214
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:24,949
But Evaluator Two...

2215
01:24:24,950 --> 01:24:26,350
didn't say anything false.

2216
01:24:26,850 --> 01:24:28,090
What do you mean?

2217
01:24:28,620 --> 01:24:30,490
What do you mean by disobedience?

2218
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:34,190
So, he never listens.

2219
01:24:34,890 --> 01:24:36,500
All he has to do is just do as I say.

2220
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:38,100
But he talks back.

2221
01:24:38,860 --> 01:24:41,300
But what's the point of doing it anonymously?

2222
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,870
- But...
- It's like whispering.

2223
01:24:44,470 --> 01:24:47,739
First, I'll reveal the ranks between you.

2224
01:24:47,740 --> 01:24:48,770
- Okay.
- All right.

2225
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:51,609
"Who showed the best ability and the level of contribution..."

2226
01:24:51,610 --> 01:24:54,680
"to the international expedition to Mexico?"

2227
01:24:54,850 --> 01:24:58,079
"Write the name and the reason."

2228
01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:00,850
"Who showed the best ability..."

2229
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:02,680
"and the level of contribution..."

2230
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:05,660
I was surprised this time.

2231
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:06,760
It was...

2232
01:25:09,830 --> 01:25:10,959
(Chosen by the KKPP Foods employees)

2233
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:12,600
The best ability...

2234
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:14,530
and the level of contribution...

2235
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:17,039
The one who placed first...

2236
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:18,439
(Who placed 1st in the peer review?)

2237
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:19,440
in the peer review is...

2238
01:25:19,441 --> 01:25:20,540
(Drumroll)

2239
01:25:20,940 --> 01:25:23,010
He received 2 votes out of 3.

2240
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:27,179
CEO Lee Kwang Soo. Congratulations.

2241
01:25:27,180 --> 01:25:28,586
(1st place in the peer review, CEO Lee Kwang Soo)

2242
01:25:28,610 --> 01:25:29,750
What?

2243
01:25:31,020 --> 01:25:32,890
(Overwhelmed again)

2244
01:25:32,990 --> 01:25:34,320
- Two votes?
- Two votes.

2245
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:38,220
He voted for himself.

2246
01:25:39,460 --> 01:25:40,690
You didn't vote for me?

2247
01:25:40,990 --> 01:25:42,130
Who did you vote for?

2248
01:25:42,330 --> 01:25:44,210
Who did you vote for if you didn't vote for me?

2249
01:25:45,260 --> 01:25:48,130
Is it okay to vote for himself?

2250
01:25:48,230 --> 01:25:50,369
- It said among the three.
- Because one might think...

2251
01:25:50,370 --> 01:25:51,969
he had the best ability.

2252
01:25:51,970 --> 01:25:53,240
That's awful.

2253
01:25:54,770 --> 01:25:57,710
Two votes for Lee Kwang Soo and one vote for Kim Woo Bin.

2254
01:25:58,710 --> 01:26:00,279
- CEO Lee Kwang Soo...
- It's a bummer.

2255
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:02,350
Placed first in the peer review.

2256
01:26:02,450 --> 01:26:03,820
It's a sweeping win.

2257
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:06,949
It's important...

2258
01:26:06,950 --> 01:26:09,860
to have the peer review on each other.

2259
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:11,859
- What?
- The production crew...

2260
01:26:11,860 --> 01:26:13,389
who watched from a step back...

2261
01:26:13,390 --> 01:26:14,929
- might have opinions too.
- Right.

2262
01:26:14,930 --> 01:26:17,099
Then lastly,

2263
01:26:17,100 --> 01:26:19,270
we'll combine how you evaluated each other...

2264
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:22,540
with the production crew's representatives' evaluation...

2265
01:26:23,470 --> 01:26:26,140
and reward...

2266
01:26:26,810 --> 01:26:27,909
whoever placed first.

2267
01:26:27,910 --> 01:26:29,010
- Good.
- I see.

2268
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:32,980
Here are the final rankings...

2269
01:26:33,910 --> 01:26:37,050
after combining the production crew's evaluation.

2270
01:26:38,350 --> 01:26:39,520
First place goes to...

2271
01:26:39,890 --> 01:26:41,049
Are you announcing first place first?

2272
01:26:41,050 --> 01:26:42,189
Yes, I'll announce first place first.

2273
01:26:42,190 --> 01:26:43,319
Good.

2274
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:44,660
(Drumroll)

2275
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:47,230
He received three votes.

2276
01:26:51,230 --> 01:26:52,360
First place goes to...

2277
01:26:52,770 --> 01:26:53,799
Are you announcing first place first?

2278
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:54,929
Yes, I'll announce first place first.

2279
01:26:54,930 --> 01:26:56,069
Good.

2280
01:26:56,070 --> 01:26:57,470
(Drumroll)

2281
01:26:57,700 --> 01:26:59,940
He received three votes.

2282
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:04,440
Congratulations to Kim Woo Bin!

2283
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:08,480
(1st place in the peer review, Auditor Kim Woo Bin)

2284
01:27:09,250 --> 01:27:10,950
(Spacing out)

2285
01:27:11,050 --> 01:27:12,320
What? What happened?

2286
01:27:12,890 --> 01:27:14,490
Your first place is gone.

2287
01:27:14,890 --> 01:27:16,319
- Thank you.
- CEO Lee Kwang Soo,

2288
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:18,359
you placed first in the peer review,

2289
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:21,530
but when we combined it with the production crew's score,

2290
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:23,500
- Auditor Kim Woo Bin...
- Gosh.

2291
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:25,800
Placed first.

2292
01:27:25,930 --> 01:27:27,070
Thank you.

2293
01:27:27,830 --> 01:27:29,499
Wait. He received three votes?

2294
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:31,380
(Joy and sorrow crossed right before his eyes.)

2295
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:33,370
He received three votes? Stop filming.

2296
01:27:34,270 --> 01:27:35,369
Stop filming.

2297
01:27:35,370 --> 01:27:37,286
(Venting his anger on the innocent production crew)

2298
01:27:37,310 --> 01:27:39,480
(0 production crew votes for CEO Lee Kwang Soo)

2299
01:27:39,710 --> 01:27:41,549
- I received only one?
- Yes.

2300
01:27:41,550 --> 01:27:42,756
(1 production crew vote for Director Doh Kyung Soo)

2301
01:27:42,780 --> 01:27:44,780
If you know who voted for you,

2302
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:47,049
- it might help you.
- No.

2303
01:27:47,050 --> 01:27:50,190
(Revealing the 3 production crew representatives)

2304
01:27:50,460 --> 01:27:52,860
The one who voted for Director Doh Kyung Soo is...

2305
01:27:53,790 --> 01:27:55,790
Hong Jeong Bin in the marketing team.

2306
01:27:57,460 --> 01:28:00,170
(Hong Jeong Bin, marketing team)

2307
01:28:00,670 --> 01:28:01,800
Thank you!

2308
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:06,269
CEO Lee Kwang Soo received two votes...

2309
01:28:06,270 --> 01:28:09,440
from his peers.

2310
01:28:10,740 --> 01:28:11,839
- For real?
- Yes.

2311
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:12,909
No one from the production crew...

2312
01:28:12,910 --> 01:28:14,309
It's not that his peers voted for him.

2313
01:28:14,310 --> 01:28:15,679
If he hadn't voted for himself,

2314
01:28:15,680 --> 01:28:17,560
- I basically won.
- He basically got one vote.

2315
01:28:18,780 --> 01:28:19,790
That's true.

2316
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:21,449
- So what?
- "That's true."

2317
01:28:21,450 --> 01:28:22,489
(The man who voted for himself is proud.)

2318
01:28:22,490 --> 01:28:24,490
What can I do? I think I deserve first place.

2319
01:28:25,220 --> 01:28:27,390
(I love myself.)

2320
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:29,659
Lastly, those who voted for Auditor Kim Woo Bin...

2321
01:28:29,660 --> 01:28:31,959
who placed first are...

2322
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:34,900
the youngest producer, Lee Gyeong Min...

2323
01:28:35,570 --> 01:28:38,539
and the one who settled the finance every night with you,

2324
01:28:38,540 --> 01:28:39,739
Yun Jun Wi.

2325
01:28:39,740 --> 01:28:41,140
(Yun Jun Wi, the senior accountant)

2326
01:28:41,210 --> 01:28:42,440
Yun Jun Wi.

2327
01:28:43,010 --> 01:28:45,479
(The junior dashes out upon hearing the senior's name.)

2328
01:28:45,480 --> 01:28:46,610
He voted for you.

2329
01:28:49,820 --> 01:28:51,519
(The accountant brothers' warm hug)

2330
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:53,590
Oh, it's hot. A hug between men.

2331
01:28:56,620 --> 01:28:59,220
He turned red.

2332
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:02,490
(Blushing)

2333
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:05,860
I'd like to give Jun Wi a gift.

2334
01:29:06,370 --> 01:29:08,700
(The signature accountant item with gratitude)

2335
01:29:09,700 --> 01:29:12,170
(The auditor gives him the sunglasses.)

2336
01:29:12,270 --> 01:29:13,570
For the next settlement session.

2337
01:29:14,940 --> 01:29:17,040
- Put them on.
- Put them on.

2338
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:20,980
They've been through thick and thin together.

2339
01:29:21,910 --> 01:29:24,350
(Looking forward to it)

2340
01:29:26,590 --> 01:29:29,149
(Looking charismatic)

2341
01:29:29,150 --> 01:29:30,690
- He put them on.
- Not bad.

2342
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:32,890
- Hey.
- Let's take a picture.

2343
01:29:34,630 --> 01:29:36,760
How can those glasses look so bad on him?

2344
01:29:39,230 --> 01:29:40,599
(Nothing's hotter than their friendship.)

2345
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:42,069
Congratulations.

2346
01:29:42,070 --> 01:29:43,299
- Thank you.
- Aren't you hungry?

2347
01:29:43,300 --> 01:29:44,940
(Nothing's hotter than their friendship.)

2348
01:29:45,140 --> 01:29:46,509
(1st, Auditor Kim Woo Bin with 3 votes)

2349
01:29:46,510 --> 01:29:47,869
(2nd, CEO Lee Kwang Soo with 2 votes, including 1 from himself)

2350
01:29:47,870 --> 01:29:48,969
(3rd, Director Doh Kyung Soo with 1 vote)

2351
01:29:48,970 --> 01:29:50,380
It's not 1st, 2nd, and 3rd.

2352
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:53,479
Can I open it?

2353
01:29:53,480 --> 01:29:55,010
- Sure.
- Right.

2354
01:29:55,780 --> 01:29:58,250
(The gifts were given according to their ranks.)

2355
01:29:58,420 --> 01:30:00,149
- The laughter award?
- It's heavy.

2356
01:30:00,150 --> 01:30:01,250
It's heavy.

2357
01:30:01,690 --> 01:30:03,689
- What's that?
- The recorder.

2358
01:30:03,690 --> 01:30:05,820
(The talking cactus doll)

2359
01:30:05,990 --> 01:30:07,790
Doesn't it wail?

2360
01:30:08,930 --> 01:30:10,300
Lee Kwang Soo!

2361
01:30:11,930 --> 01:30:13,130
Lee Kwang Soo!

2362
01:30:13,830 --> 01:30:15,199
(Getting yelled at by the cactus)

2363
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:16,239
That...

2364
01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:18,160
- It repeats right away.
- It has that function.

2365
01:30:18,470 --> 01:30:19,769
- It's cute.
- Thank you.

2366
01:30:19,770 --> 01:30:20,909
It's cute.

2367
01:30:20,910 --> 01:30:22,316
(A cactus and a cactus doll combo for 3rd place)

2368
01:30:22,340 --> 01:30:23,860
Show us the gift for the second place.

2369
01:30:24,140 --> 01:30:26,409
Oh, I noticed you kept drinking...

2370
01:30:26,410 --> 01:30:28,880
the chicken breast shake.

2371
01:30:30,350 --> 01:30:32,219
- It smells like the grain powder.
- Yes.

2372
01:30:32,220 --> 01:30:34,120
(Drinking the protein together)

2373
01:30:34,190 --> 01:30:35,750
(Exclaiming)

2374
01:30:36,820 --> 01:30:38,919
- How is this so tasty?
- Good.

2375
01:30:38,920 --> 01:30:40,930
(Crazy skills to steal the scene)

2376
01:30:41,030 --> 01:30:43,460
- It's so good.
- It's the chicken breast shake.

2377
01:30:43,700 --> 01:30:45,060
- It's good.
- Next to it is...

2378
01:30:45,130 --> 01:30:46,929
the Mexican Coke you were always curious about.

2379
01:30:46,930 --> 01:30:48,699
For you to keep it as a souvenir.

2380
01:30:48,700 --> 01:30:50,270
Is this the Mexican Coke?

2381
01:30:50,770 --> 01:30:53,370
(The Mexican Coke finally in Kwang Soo's arms)

2382
01:30:53,410 --> 01:30:54,910
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

2383
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:58,180
(Let's drink Coke.)

2384
01:30:58,410 --> 01:31:00,150
- This is...
- And...

2385
01:31:00,550 --> 01:31:01,679
- Made with sugar cane.
- For the first place,

2386
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:03,379
it's the Mexican gift combo.

2387
01:31:03,380 --> 01:31:05,120
There's so much.

2388
01:31:05,550 --> 01:31:09,019
Mexican snacks, tequila, nachos, three kinds of salsas,

2389
01:31:09,020 --> 01:31:10,559
tortillas, chocolate, sombrero,

2390
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:12,289
and the maracas. We included everything.

2391
01:31:12,290 --> 01:31:13,329
That's a lot.

2392
01:31:13,330 --> 01:31:15,489
It was a good idea to give Jun Wi the sunglasses.

2393
01:31:15,490 --> 01:31:16,830
Right. There was a pair inside.

2394
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:18,399
They look good on you.

2395
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:19,920
How come everything looks good on you?

2396
01:31:20,930 --> 01:31:22,399
They go perfectly with the hat.

2397
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:23,540
Yes.

2398
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:26,410
(With the maracas)

2399
01:31:27,340 --> 01:31:28,969
- There's so much.
- You can share it with your nephew.

2400
01:31:28,970 --> 01:31:30,709
Thank you so much.

2401
01:31:30,710 --> 01:31:32,540
You can keep them as souvenirs.

2402
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:34,709
That is all...

2403
01:31:34,710 --> 01:31:36,419
for the award ceremony.

2404
01:31:36,420 --> 01:31:38,719
Please enjoy the food and the gifts.

2405
01:31:38,720 --> 01:31:39,790
Congratulations.

2406
01:31:40,650 --> 01:31:43,490
(The KKPP Foods' Night ends.)

2407
01:31:45,620 --> 01:31:52,100
(2 hours ago, the peer review time)

2408
01:31:52,530 --> 01:31:53,970
"Who do you think it is?"

2409
01:31:55,270 --> 01:31:56,340
Strength.

2410
01:31:56,570 --> 01:31:58,040
Doh Kyung Soo has so many strengths.

2411
01:31:58,340 --> 01:31:59,470
There are just so many.

2412
01:31:59,940 --> 01:32:02,209
Actually, Kyung Soo basically...

2413
01:32:02,210 --> 01:32:03,840
planned the whole trip.

2414
01:32:04,310 --> 01:32:06,010
He was good at finding the route.

2415
01:32:06,380 --> 01:32:08,010
He looked up delicious restaurants.

2416
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:09,779
He also found the hotels.

2417
01:32:09,780 --> 01:32:10,819
(He found the routes, good restaurants, and hotels.)

2418
01:32:10,820 --> 01:32:12,990
We encountered tripe tacos in the end.

2419
01:32:13,420 --> 01:32:15,289
We found out about that dish upon coming to Mexico.

2420
01:32:15,290 --> 01:32:17,220
Yes. I think...

2421
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:19,389
such tendencies really suit...

2422
01:32:19,390 --> 01:32:23,500
the international cultural expedition.

2423
01:32:24,100 --> 01:32:25,429
There's nothing about Kyung Soo...

2424
01:32:25,430 --> 01:32:27,129
that I don't like.

2425
01:32:27,130 --> 01:32:28,370
It has always been like that.

2426
01:32:28,830 --> 01:32:30,840
Didn't you complain a lot?

2427
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:32,640
A very...

2428
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:33,970
warm-hearted...

2429
01:32:34,110 --> 01:32:35,210
man,

2430
01:32:35,410 --> 01:32:39,140
Kim Woo Bin.

2431
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:40,709
(Congratulations on liking each other.)

2432
01:32:40,710 --> 01:32:41,879
There we go.

2433
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:43,379
Woo Bin...

2434
01:32:43,380 --> 01:32:46,050
played his role of an auditor with diligence.

2435
01:32:46,690 --> 01:32:51,920
If Woo Bin hadn't done such a perfect job as an auditor,

2436
01:32:52,260 --> 01:32:55,859
we would've been very anxious about our financial situation.

2437
01:32:55,860 --> 01:32:57,376
(Woo Bin made calculations with precision.)

2438
01:32:57,400 --> 01:32:59,400
It was very easy for me.

2439
01:33:00,070 --> 01:33:01,429
When we went to a restaurant,

2440
01:33:01,430 --> 01:33:03,370
I could focus on eating.

2441
01:33:04,070 --> 01:33:05,469
In that sense,

2442
01:33:05,470 --> 01:33:08,940
he helped a lot during this trip.

2443
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:11,009
When it comes to work,

2444
01:33:11,010 --> 01:33:13,309
the environment is the most important.

2445
01:33:13,310 --> 01:33:16,320
An environment that lets you work with a smile is the most important.

2446
01:33:16,350 --> 01:33:18,549
CEO Lee stooped...

2447
01:33:18,550 --> 01:33:21,789
to our level and treated the employees...

2448
01:33:21,790 --> 01:33:23,789
as our friends.

2449
01:33:23,790 --> 01:33:25,320
(The friend-like CEO, Lee Kwang Soo)

2450
01:33:25,620 --> 01:33:28,329
Although the schedule was taxing,

2451
01:33:28,330 --> 01:33:31,300
we could work with a smile.

2452
01:33:31,830 --> 01:33:34,129
When we walked to avoid transferring...

2453
01:33:34,130 --> 01:33:35,329
to another subway line,

2454
01:33:35,330 --> 01:33:37,539
we could feel the streets...

2455
01:33:37,540 --> 01:33:38,840
and weather of Mexico.

2456
01:33:38,940 --> 01:33:40,369
We could try on the masks.

2457
01:33:40,370 --> 01:33:41,786
(Kwang Soo's curiosity made the expedition more colourful.)

2458
01:33:41,810 --> 01:33:43,410
Those experiences...

2459
01:33:43,640 --> 01:33:46,610
made me think, "I'm glad I had these experiences."

2460
01:33:47,150 --> 01:33:49,880
Each person had...

2461
01:33:50,050 --> 01:33:52,420
a different role and expertise.

2462
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:56,049
I think the combination was perfect.

2463
01:33:56,050 --> 01:33:57,820
(The combination was perfect.)

2464
01:33:59,060 --> 01:34:02,790
(The perfect expedition in Mexico comes to an end.)

2465
01:34:03,660 --> 01:34:09,670
(The things this journey left to the expedition team)

2466
01:34:10,170 --> 01:34:12,399
(Kwang Soo wanted to go to Canada.)

2467
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:13,409
It's totally pink.

2468
01:34:13,410 --> 01:34:14,440
Totally pink.

2469
01:34:14,970 --> 01:34:17,740
All the people in Mexico...

2470
01:34:17,940 --> 01:34:19,210
and I are one.

2471
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:20,679
I'm Mexican.

2472
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:22,286
(He came to love Mexico more than anyone.)

2473
01:34:22,310 --> 01:34:24,480
(Woo Bin had no confidence in calculations.)

2474
01:34:24,750 --> 01:34:26,150
(Please give us a discount.)

2475
01:34:26,490 --> 01:34:27,620
My friend.

2476
01:34:28,150 --> 01:34:29,320
Please.

2477
01:34:29,450 --> 01:34:30,859
Please give me a hug.

2478
01:34:30,860 --> 01:34:34,190
(He became the master of calculations.)

2479
01:34:34,630 --> 01:34:36,700
(Kyung Soo didn't like vacation spots.)

2480
01:34:36,860 --> 01:34:38,559
It's a rainbow!

2481
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:40,130
- It's a rainbow!
- It's a rainbow!

2482
01:34:44,370 --> 01:34:46,139
(He found his new side.)

2483
01:34:46,140 --> 01:34:47,470
I think I like vacation spots.

2484
01:34:47,870 --> 01:34:49,546
- I didn't know that.
- You realised that today.
