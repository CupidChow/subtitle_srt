(KKPP Foods' expedition log, Day 6)

8
00:00:33,123 --> 00:00:36,433
(The expedition team went in search of a whale shark.)

9
00:00:36,893 --> 00:00:38,302
(Exclaiming)

10
00:00:38,303 --> 00:00:40,063
(They braved the rough waves.)

(Kwang Soo, retching)

12
00:00:41,933 --> 00:00:43,472
(They went through bad seasickness.)

13
00:00:43,473 --> 00:00:45,342
(Shouting)

14
00:00:45,343 --> 00:00:47,042
(They met a whale shark after many struggles.)

15
00:00:47,043 --> 00:00:48,343

00:00:48,743 --> 00:00:50,512
(After the satisfying whale shark tour)

17
00:00:50,513 --> 00:00:52,312
It's a rainbow!

18
00:00:52,313 --> 00:00:53,883
- It's a rainbow!
- It's a rainbow!

19
00:00:54,143 --> 00:00:55,753
(They enjoyed the thrilling parasailing.)

20
00:00:55,953 --> 00:00:57,822
(The expedition had a fulfilling and happy tour.)

21
00:00:57,823 --> 00:00:59,122
Approved!

22
00:00:59,123 --> 00:01:00,123
Has it been approved?

23
00:01:00,153 --> 00:01:02,653
(Their request for special expense got approved.)

24
00:01:02,753 --> 00:01:05,263
(They thought they'd continue to get lucky.)

25
00:01:05,693 --> 00:01:07,423
It's raining more than we expected.

26
00:01:07,993 --> 00:01:11,033
(They were going to go to Cozumel, but it rained.)

27
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:14,433
(The restaurant they were eyeing was closed.)

28
00:01:14,773 --> 00:01:17,573
(Thus, they came to a restaurant near the hotel.)

29
00:01:18,173 --> 00:01:19,743
It's too bad that it's raining.

30
00:01:20,603 --> 00:01:22,942
It looks like our plans...

31
00:01:22,943 --> 00:01:24,812
will get ruined.

32
00:01:24,813 --> 00:01:26,982
(There's still a rainstorm.)

33
00:01:26,983 --> 00:01:28,612
If it rains too much,

34
00:01:28,613 --> 00:01:31,023
we won't be able to ride a scooter at Cozumel.

35
00:01:31,553 --> 00:01:34,022
That activity was our goal.

36
00:01:34,023 --> 00:01:35,453
- That was why we wanted to go.
- Yes.

37
00:01:35,923 --> 00:01:38,223
We were going to finally enjoy a vacation spot.

38
00:01:38,323 --> 00:01:40,993
What were you going to do if the weather was sunny?

39
00:01:41,463 --> 00:01:43,333
We were going to go to a beach.

40
00:01:43,533 --> 00:01:45,403
You know how it is...

41
00:01:45,663 --> 00:01:47,462
in a foreign clip.

42
00:01:47,463 --> 00:01:48,672
People laugh...

43
00:01:48,673 --> 00:01:49,873
and play volleyball.

44
00:01:49,933 --> 00:01:51,702
(A cheerful volleyball scene you've seen somewhere)

45
00:01:51,703 --> 00:01:52,903
Something like that.

46
00:01:53,043 --> 00:01:55,813
Then you stick a beer bottle in the sand.

47
00:01:56,673 --> 00:01:58,742
"Hello." You say hello to the passers-by.

48
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:00,543
- You suddenly go swimming.
- That's right.

49
00:02:00,683 --> 00:02:01,852
- And...
- I love such things.

50
00:02:01,853 --> 00:02:03,012
as you come out of the water...

51
00:02:03,013 --> 00:02:04,522
(Spitting out water)

52
00:02:04,523 --> 00:02:06,283
(Wrapping up with a scene where you shake off under the sun)

53
00:02:06,323 --> 00:02:07,822
A trip is more fun...

54
00:02:07,823 --> 00:02:09,293
when things don't go according to plan.

55
00:02:09,993 --> 00:02:12,263
There are 28 people, right?

56
00:02:12,723 --> 00:02:13,892
- That's right.
- In total.

57
00:02:13,893 --> 00:02:15,862
I'll look for a place where we can have...

58
00:02:15,863 --> 00:02:17,133
a get-together.

59
00:02:18,163 --> 00:02:19,602
(KKPP Foods and the head office...)

60
00:02:19,603 --> 00:02:21,003
(will have a get-together this evening.)

61
00:02:21,103 --> 00:02:23,033
We can pick the location of the get-together, right?

62
00:02:23,273 --> 00:02:24,473
- That sounds good.
- CEO Ko said...

63
00:02:24,503 --> 00:02:28,742
that it was up to Kwang Soo by 100 percent.

64
00:02:28,743 --> 00:02:30,513
Don't call me Kwang Soo.

65
00:02:31,013 --> 00:02:32,843
- Call me CEO Lee.
- I'm sorry.

66
00:02:34,143 --> 00:02:36,513
- He said it was up to CEO Lee.
- CEO Lee.

67
00:02:37,213 --> 00:02:38,483
Why don't you submit...

68
00:02:40,153 --> 00:02:42,053
some proposals?

69
00:02:42,893 --> 00:02:44,593
- What?
- Submit a list.

71
00:02:47,163 --> 00:02:48,492

(Director)

73
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:52,063
(Staring at the menu)

74
00:02:52,133 --> 00:02:53,433
They sell brownies.

75
00:02:53,863 --> 00:02:55,003
(Woo Bin chuckles.)

76
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,603
You're going to eat a brownie, right?

77
00:02:57,773 --> 00:02:58,973
Go ahead and eat it.

78
00:02:59,943 --> 00:03:01,112
(He checks out the main dishes after picking a brownie.)

79
00:03:01,113 --> 00:03:02,242
This is breakfast.

80
00:03:02,243 --> 00:03:03,443
I want a pancake.

81
00:03:03,943 --> 00:03:05,183
I want shakshouka.

82
00:03:05,843 --> 00:03:07,083
What's shakshouka?

83
00:03:07,243 --> 00:03:08,352
It's a Middle Eastern dish.

84
00:03:08,353 --> 00:03:10,553
- A Middle Eastern dish?
- It's a sauce...

85
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:12,453
you can dip your bread in.

86
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,293
- I want this one.
- What is it?

87
00:03:16,553 --> 00:03:18,493
- Fish tacos.
- I saw that and thought,

88
00:03:18,693 --> 00:03:21,093
- Tacos?
- "Anything but those."

89
00:03:22,033 --> 00:03:23,292
I think they'll be tasty.

90
00:03:23,293 --> 00:03:25,103
We haven't had any seafood tacos.

91
00:03:25,533 --> 00:03:26,933
We've only had meat tacos.

92
00:03:28,403 --> 00:03:29,633
Mosculpe.

93
00:03:30,003 --> 00:03:31,032
It's "Disculpe."

94
00:03:31,033 --> 00:03:32,773
Dis... Disculpe.

95
00:03:33,473 --> 00:03:34,543
- That's right.
- Yes, my friend.

96
00:03:35,643 --> 00:03:37,413
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

97
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:39,512
- One...
- Pancake.

98
00:03:39,513 --> 00:03:41,152
One fish taco.

99
00:03:41,153 --> 00:03:42,853
Fish taco for you. Okay.

100
00:03:43,313 --> 00:03:44,553
One pancake.

101
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:45,783
Pancake. Okay.

102
00:03:45,923 --> 00:03:47,482
- And shakshouka.
- Shakshouka.

103
00:03:47,483 --> 00:03:48,553
Shakshouka.

104
00:03:48,653 --> 00:03:50,052
- And...
- What else were we going to get?

105
00:03:50,053 --> 00:03:51,692
one brownie.

106
00:03:51,693 --> 00:03:52,822
Brownie. Okay.

107
00:03:52,823 --> 00:03:54,792
Brownie comes with ice cream.

108
00:03:54,793 --> 00:03:56,162
- Do you want ice cream?
- I want ice cream.

109
00:03:56,163 --> 00:03:57,293
Yes. Perfect.

110
00:03:57,533 --> 00:03:58,962
Shall we put a pasta dish in the middle?

111
00:03:58,963 --> 00:04:00,003
That sounds good.

112
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:01,303
What's the best?

113
00:04:01,473 --> 00:04:02,673
Rose pasta is really good.

114
00:04:02,773 --> 00:04:04,232
- Rose?
- Rose, please.

115
00:04:04,233 --> 00:04:07,172
(They order rose pasta for sharing as well.)

116
00:04:07,173 --> 00:04:08,513
Thank you.

117
00:04:09,273 --> 00:04:10,572
Shall we ask him to bring us our brownie last?

118
00:04:10,573 --> 00:04:11,743
It's okay.

119
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:13,643
I can eat a brownie only right now.

120
00:04:14,553 --> 00:04:15,882
I can't go without it.

121
00:04:15,883 --> 00:04:16,983
(I can't go without it.)

122
00:04:17,113 --> 00:04:19,152
How many times have you said that today?

123
00:04:19,153 --> 00:04:21,352
I don't know. I'm starting to lose my patience.

124
00:04:21,353 --> 00:04:23,053
(I'm starting to lose my patience.)

125
00:04:23,453 --> 00:04:25,063
My friend, it's for you.

126
00:04:25,463 --> 00:04:26,892
- Thank you.
- Do you want...

127
00:04:26,893 --> 00:04:28,232
Parmesan cheese or not?

128
00:04:28,233 --> 00:04:29,433
- Please.
- Yes?

129
00:04:29,533 --> 00:04:32,263
(Rose pasta)

130
00:04:34,633 --> 00:04:38,243
(Two forks wait for Woo Bin to get some.)

131
00:04:38,873 --> 00:04:40,203
One, two, three.

132
00:04:42,313 --> 00:04:46,113
(On the count of three, they try the rose pasta together.)

133
00:04:47,483 --> 00:04:48,483
(Impressed)

134
00:04:48,484 --> 00:04:49,813
- It's tasty.
- It's tasty.

135
00:04:50,483 --> 00:04:52,323
(Impressed)

136
00:04:54,053 --> 00:04:56,593
- The pasta is chewy.
- Their pasta is very tasty.

137
00:04:57,323 --> 00:04:58,762
This pasta is flat and broad.

138
00:04:58,763 --> 00:05:00,193
What was the name of this pasta?

139
00:05:00,793 --> 00:05:03,432
- Pappardelle.
- Pappardelle?

140
00:05:03,433 --> 00:05:05,363
(Flat and broad pappardelle)

141
00:05:05,563 --> 00:05:07,333
Since it's thin,

142
00:05:07,363 --> 00:05:08,872
it gets seasoned evenly.

143
00:05:08,873 --> 00:05:10,033
I know.

144
00:05:10,803 --> 00:05:13,243
And more sauce gets on the sauce.

145
00:05:13,503 --> 00:05:14,712
(The broad surface area gives them a clearer taste of the sauce.)

146
00:05:14,713 --> 00:05:15,913
That must be why.

147
00:05:17,543 --> 00:05:19,483
(Cleansing his palate with orange juice)

148
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,383
This orange juice is really tasty.

149
00:05:21,483 --> 00:05:23,413
- I guess it's freshly squeezed.
- You're right.

150
00:05:26,553 --> 00:05:27,653
It's really tasty.

151
00:05:28,293 --> 00:05:29,623
My mouth is watering.

152
00:05:30,093 --> 00:05:32,363
The fruits are sweet here.

153
00:05:33,423 --> 00:05:34,522
- That's right.
- Yes, my friend.

154
00:05:34,523 --> 00:05:35,593
- What?
- Yes.

155
00:05:36,493 --> 00:05:37,962
Your brownie is here.

156
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:39,262
- Brownie?
- Yes.

157
00:05:39,263 --> 00:05:40,263
For you?

158
00:05:40,264 --> 00:05:41,803
- Please.
- Excellent.

159
00:05:41,933 --> 00:05:43,172
(Brownie is served.)

160
00:05:43,173 --> 00:05:44,302
It looks tasty, Kwang Soo.

161
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:45,343
It looks really tasty.

162
00:05:45,373 --> 00:05:47,003
The ice cream is cold, and the brownie is hot.

163
00:05:47,073 --> 00:05:48,173
Perfect.

164
00:05:49,513 --> 00:05:52,013
(It's precious.)

165
00:05:52,383 --> 00:05:53,643
Aren't you going to eat it now?

166
00:05:55,053 --> 00:05:56,183
Are you going to eat it now?

167
00:05:57,213 --> 00:05:58,352
You aren't going to eat it now, right?

168
00:05:58,353 --> 00:05:59,623
(Most people eat dessert after the main dish.)

169
00:06:00,053 --> 00:06:01,053
Shall we try it?

170
00:06:01,183 --> 00:06:02,393
Let's have him try it first.

171
00:06:02,923 --> 00:06:04,392
(Closing his eyes)

172
00:06:04,393 --> 00:06:05,463
How is it?

173
00:06:05,893 --> 00:06:07,063
Is it tasty?

174
00:06:07,563 --> 00:06:08,993
The brownie is so tasty.

175
00:06:11,033 --> 00:06:12,362
Who ordered the fish tacos?

176
00:06:12,363 --> 00:06:13,763
My goodness. What?

177
00:06:14,463 --> 00:06:15,803
(Excited fingers)

178
00:06:16,133 --> 00:06:18,743
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food. Enjoy it.

179
00:06:19,573 --> 00:06:21,742
(Fish taco is a dish of fried fish in a tortilla...)

180
00:06:21,743 --> 00:06:24,243
(that's accompanied with lime juice and salsa.)

181
00:06:25,413 --> 00:06:29,853
(How will the taco fanatic like his first fish taco?)

182
00:06:31,853 --> 00:06:32,883
Is it tasty?

183
00:06:33,223 --> 00:06:34,323
Is it fried fish?

184
00:06:34,923 --> 00:06:35,993
It's fried fish.

185
00:06:36,193 --> 00:06:39,493
But the fried fish isn't crispy.

186
00:06:40,023 --> 00:06:41,433
It's pillowy.

187
00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:45,663
But the fish isn't seasoned.

188
00:06:46,503 --> 00:06:50,973
I think I'm supposed to dip it in the sauce.

189
00:06:51,943 --> 00:06:53,243
Is that a corn tortilla?

190
00:06:53,743 --> 00:06:54,743
Corn tortilla.

191
00:06:56,143 --> 00:06:59,143
(He takes a bite with the sauce this time.)

192
00:06:59,283 --> 00:07:01,353
This sauce is strong.

193
00:07:02,413 --> 00:07:04,413
I think that's why they didn't season the fish.

194
00:07:06,753 --> 00:07:07,923
Try it. It's tasty.

195
00:07:09,653 --> 00:07:12,223
(CEO Lee tries a bit of fish taco.)

196
00:07:13,623 --> 00:07:14,693
It's tasty.

197
00:07:14,963 --> 00:07:16,893
I like that the fish isn't seasoned.

198
00:07:17,033 --> 00:07:18,633
I know. This sauce is tasty.

199
00:07:19,163 --> 00:07:21,203
It's like eating grilled fish and bread.

200
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:22,833
It's a bit like Atka mackerel.

201
00:07:23,273 --> 00:07:24,573
That's right. It's like Atka mackerel.

202
00:07:25,043 --> 00:07:26,043
It's tasty.

203
00:07:26,043 --> 00:07:27,043
(Impressed)

204
00:07:27,044 --> 00:07:28,413
Yes. Seriously.

205
00:07:30,043 --> 00:07:34,213
(Director's taco hunt was successful today as well.)

206
00:07:34,813 --> 00:07:36,182
- Here.
- Thank you.

207
00:07:36,183 --> 00:07:38,622
- Do you dip it in here?
- Yes. Doesn't it look good?

208
00:07:38,623 --> 00:07:40,353
- Are these for you? Pancakes?
- Yes.

209
00:07:41,393 --> 00:07:43,293
- And shakshouka.
- Yes.

210
00:07:43,423 --> 00:07:44,493
It looks tasty.

211
00:07:45,063 --> 00:07:46,762
- It looks tasty, right? Let's eat.
- Yes.

212
00:07:46,763 --> 00:07:48,032
(Shakshouka is a dish of tomato sauce and eggs.)

213
00:07:48,033 --> 00:07:50,563
Shakshouka comes with salad.

214
00:07:51,293 --> 00:07:53,462
- Salad.
- It's Maltese salad. Tomato,

215
00:07:53,463 --> 00:07:54,772
- I see.
- onion...

216
00:07:54,773 --> 00:07:56,373
(Mediterranean salad contains tomato, cucumber, and herbs.)

217
00:07:57,003 --> 00:07:58,873
I think it's Middle Eastern.

218
00:07:59,243 --> 00:08:01,073
- It says it's a Mediterranean dish.
- Mediterranean.

219
00:08:02,113 --> 00:08:05,013
(He mixes the eggs and tomato sauce.)

220
00:08:06,013 --> 00:08:08,453
(He tries shakshouka.)

221
00:08:09,513 --> 00:08:10,713
Kwang Soo, try it.

222
00:08:11,423 --> 00:08:13,723
Eat it with the eggs. Kyung Soo, try it.

223
00:08:14,383 --> 00:08:16,693
(Eating)

224
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:22,863
(Impressed)

225
00:08:23,193 --> 00:08:24,693
- It's Middle Eastern.
- Yes.

226
00:08:25,663 --> 00:08:27,832
- It has a unique aroma.
- It's tasty.

227
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:28,873
It's charming.

228
00:08:29,573 --> 00:08:30,632
What's this?

229
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:31,943
(Mediterranean salad)

230
00:08:32,043 --> 00:08:33,273
Is it salad?

231
00:08:33,773 --> 00:08:35,043
Isn't it what you get with nachos?

232
00:08:35,743 --> 00:08:37,073
It's tasty.

233
00:08:37,973 --> 00:08:39,513
Is it salad? Are you supposed to eat it like that?

234
00:08:39,613 --> 00:08:40,983
It's tasty.

235
00:08:41,683 --> 00:08:42,713
It's refreshing.

236
00:08:44,713 --> 00:08:47,683
It's easy to eat since the pieces are small.

237
00:08:48,123 --> 00:08:49,753
- Cucumber has a nice texture.
- Yes.

238
00:08:50,853 --> 00:08:53,593
(But he focuses on his brownie.)

239
00:08:54,523 --> 00:08:55,963
This brownie is so tasty.

240
00:08:57,693 --> 00:09:00,433
(He eats sweet pancakes after eating a sweet brownie.)

241
00:09:00,663 --> 00:09:02,273
Kwang Soo, it's morning.

242
00:09:03,003 --> 00:09:04,073
Your blood sugar level...

243
00:09:04,233 --> 00:09:06,843
(He adds all the maple syrup.)

244
00:09:07,973 --> 00:09:10,912
(Director first)

245
00:09:10,913 --> 00:09:13,343
(He doesn't know what to do.)

246
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:17,013
(Please put it here.)

247
00:09:17,383 --> 00:09:18,653
Woo Bin, do you want some pancake?

248
00:09:19,383 --> 00:09:20,822
- No.
- No?

249
00:09:20,823 --> 00:09:21,893
No.

250
00:09:21,953 --> 00:09:24,293
(Then the entire thing will go into my mouth.)

251
00:09:26,663 --> 00:09:29,193
( He wraps up the cold-hot combo with vanilla ice cream.)

252
00:09:30,533 --> 00:09:31,863
Is that ice cream as well?

253
00:09:32,603 --> 00:09:34,603
Yes. It's the same ice cream.

254
00:09:35,403 --> 00:09:37,673
Kwang Soo, for breakfast...

255
00:09:38,273 --> 00:09:39,302
Kyung Soo.

256
00:09:39,303 --> 00:09:41,873
(Orange juice, brownie, pancake)

257
00:09:42,013 --> 00:09:44,783
- Sugar, sugar, sugar.
- It's a sugar-filled diet.

258
00:09:45,213 --> 00:09:46,412
A diabetes-inducing diet.

259
00:09:46,413 --> 00:09:48,983
(He eats with confidence.)

260
00:09:50,253 --> 00:09:51,453
The rain stopped.

261
00:09:51,523 --> 00:09:52,682
(The rain stopped.)

262
00:09:52,683 --> 00:09:54,623
- You're right.
- The sun is coming out.

263
00:09:54,993 --> 00:09:57,593
- I think we can ride a scooter.
- We can ride it.

264
00:09:58,023 --> 00:10:00,093
I was going to go here.

265
00:10:00,393 --> 00:10:01,993
It's relatively new.

266
00:10:02,093 --> 00:10:03,262
It looks nice.

267
00:10:03,263 --> 00:10:04,563
But it's closed today.

268
00:10:05,863 --> 00:10:06,863
It's clean.

269
00:10:06,963 --> 00:10:08,272
Isn't tonight our last night?

270
00:10:08,273 --> 00:10:10,002
- Yes, it is.
- Right next to it,

271
00:10:10,003 --> 00:10:11,333
there's a place like this.

272
00:10:11,843 --> 00:10:13,072
They have tasty food.

273
00:10:13,073 --> 00:10:14,103
(That's important.)

274
00:10:14,303 --> 00:10:15,872
- There's something like this.
- There's music too.

275
00:10:15,873 --> 00:10:17,213
I think it'll be fun.

276
00:10:17,813 --> 00:10:19,182
I think it's a good choice.

277
00:10:19,183 --> 00:10:21,143
(Director decides on the location of the get-together.)

278
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,253
Thank you, my friend.

279
00:10:25,723 --> 00:10:28,022
"My friend." I like it.

280
00:10:28,023 --> 00:10:29,153
"Thank you, my friend."

281
00:10:29,893 --> 00:10:32,693
Oh, right. I should've asked for a receipt.

282
00:10:32,963 --> 00:10:35,263
(He's a very diligent auditor.)

283
00:10:36,363 --> 00:10:37,862
- Here, my friend.
- Yes.

284
00:10:37,863 --> 00:10:40,433
Could you write this receipt...

285
00:10:41,503 --> 00:10:43,633
for the payment?

286
00:10:44,633 --> 00:10:46,972
Because I've got to give it to my boss.

287
00:10:46,973 --> 00:10:48,073
- Okay.
- Yes.

288
00:10:48,473 --> 00:10:49,642
I thought so.

289
00:10:49,643 --> 00:10:52,043
(They share the woes of being an employee.)

290
00:10:52,413 --> 00:10:54,442
- My friend, it's ready.
- Thank you.

291
00:10:54,443 --> 00:10:55,653
- Thank you so much.
- We enjoyed the meal.

292
00:10:55,983 --> 00:10:58,322
- Bye.
- Bye. Thank you.

293
00:10:58,323 --> 00:10:59,622
Here is the receipt.

294
00:10:59,623 --> 00:11:02,393
(Receipt)

295
00:11:03,353 --> 00:11:08,063
(GBRB: Joy Pops Laugh Pops)

296
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,793
(After breakfast)

297
00:11:10,893 --> 00:11:12,033
It was tasty.

298
00:11:13,533 --> 00:11:14,733
Is this it?

299
00:11:15,533 --> 00:11:17,633
- Cozumel tickets?
- Yes.

300
00:11:18,643 --> 00:11:19,902
It only takes ten minutes.

301
00:11:19,903 --> 00:11:22,773
(They set out for the ticket office to go to Cozumel.)

302
00:11:24,143 --> 00:11:26,383
Kyung Soo really loves vacation spots.

303
00:11:27,543 --> 00:11:29,213
They really suit him, Kwang Soo.

304
00:11:30,283 --> 00:11:32,082
I don't think he knows himself very well.

305
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,722
He got many nicknames.

306
00:11:33,723 --> 00:11:36,153
Doh Vacation, Happy Pee Doh Kyung Soo,

307
00:11:37,023 --> 00:11:38,263
- Pee Kyung Soo.
- Pee Kyung Soo.

308
00:11:39,493 --> 00:11:40,723
(Laughing)

309
00:11:41,023 --> 00:11:43,433
(Director is learning about himself through the expedition.)

310
00:11:45,933 --> 00:11:47,462
Stores like that one are fun.

311
00:11:47,463 --> 00:11:48,633
I want to go there.

312
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:49,873
Shall we go there?

313
00:11:50,203 --> 00:11:51,973
- The weather...
- I know.

314
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,703
(Thank you.)

315
00:11:57,573 --> 00:12:00,443
(Communicating with a tour promoter through body language)

316
00:12:01,783 --> 00:12:03,182
- Why did you do this?
- What?

317
00:12:03,183 --> 00:12:05,452
- To say that we don't have time?
- I don't know why I did that.

318
00:12:05,453 --> 00:12:08,293
(He sent a message he himself didn't understand.)

319
00:12:08,423 --> 00:12:09,652
But he understood.

320
00:12:09,653 --> 00:12:10,992
He did this and left.

321
00:12:10,993 --> 00:12:14,063
(It's a mystery how the recipient understood.)

322
00:12:14,923 --> 00:12:17,633
(They arrive at the ticket office.)

323
00:12:18,563 --> 00:12:19,862
- Shall we go?
- Okay.

324
00:12:19,863 --> 00:12:21,673
(They go to buy ferry tickets to Cozumel.)

325
00:12:22,733 --> 00:12:23,803
Excuse me.

326
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,772
We need a valet service for the car.

327
00:12:26,773 --> 00:12:29,443
(The expedition team wants to park the car.)

328
00:12:29,643 --> 00:12:31,272
Somebody is coming to pick it up.

329
00:12:31,273 --> 00:12:32,382
- Yes.
- Yes.

330
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,383
(Go inside then.)

331
00:12:33,813 --> 00:12:36,253
(Go inside?)

332
00:12:36,853 --> 00:12:38,053
Why aren't they coming?

333
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,523
(It looks like CEO Lee will buy the tickets himself.)

334
00:12:41,283 --> 00:12:42,793
Why isn't Woo Bin coming?

335
00:12:43,653 --> 00:12:46,023
(Meanwhile, Auditor is unloading the trunk.)

336
00:12:46,923 --> 00:12:49,633
(It's CEO Lee's first time purchasing things.)

337
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,292
- English.
- English?

338
00:12:51,293 --> 00:12:53,933
Okay. So the ferry will leave at 1pm...

339
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:57,003
- and come back every 30 minutes.
- Okay.

340
00:12:57,373 --> 00:12:59,273
The 1st one is at 6:30am.

341
00:12:59,643 --> 00:13:01,503
The last one is at 8:30pm.

342
00:13:01,673 --> 00:13:03,443
- It's open for anyone, okay?
- Okay.

343
00:13:05,113 --> 00:13:06,513
- Okay? Yes.
- Okay.

344
00:13:07,383 --> 00:13:08,683
Did you understand?

345
00:13:09,613 --> 00:13:11,923
Do you have tickets already?

346
00:13:12,623 --> 00:13:14,752
- Yes. I have tickets.
- You have tickets. Okay. Good.

347
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:16,422
So, whenever you're ready,

348
00:13:16,423 --> 00:13:18,422
you go down to the beach and go over to the right.

349
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:19,423
There is the boat.

350
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,023
- Hello.
- He's doing it alone.

351
00:13:21,663 --> 00:13:23,093
- Shall we leave him be?
- Let's do that.

352
00:13:23,633 --> 00:13:25,703
We'll leave Kwang Soo to buy the tickets himself.

353
00:13:26,463 --> 00:13:27,802
You aren't entering on purpose.

354
00:13:27,803 --> 00:13:29,533
(You shouldn't do that.)

355
00:13:30,303 --> 00:13:34,573
(CEO Lee is having an English listening comprehension test.)

356
00:13:34,743 --> 00:13:36,212
It leaves every 30 minutes.

357
00:13:36,213 --> 00:13:38,273
What I need here is the key to the car.

358
00:13:38,913 --> 00:13:40,213
Okay.

359
00:13:41,413 --> 00:13:42,483
Okay.

360
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,983
- Finished?
- Yes.

361
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,283
Should I pay?

362
00:13:47,983 --> 00:13:50,453
Yes, for the car. Will you pay cash or card?

363
00:13:51,453 --> 00:13:52,622
This is for the car.

364
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,623
- I see.
- Peso.

365
00:13:55,763 --> 00:13:57,063
Wait a moment, please.

366
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:01,533
Woo Bin, we need to pay. It's 300.

367
00:14:01,803 --> 00:14:03,503
- What? What's 300?
- It's 300.

368
00:14:04,133 --> 00:14:05,243
I don't know. He wants 300.

369
00:14:06,543 --> 00:14:07,942
- Why?
- Let's pay first.

370
00:14:07,943 --> 00:14:10,813
(He didn't understand, but the answer is 300.)

371
00:14:11,373 --> 00:14:12,412
Thank you.

372
00:14:12,413 --> 00:14:13,813
(Why is he paying 300 pesos without understanding?)

373
00:14:14,113 --> 00:14:15,613
If you're ready, you can go now.

374
00:14:16,883 --> 00:14:20,853
(He nods, but he doesn't leave.)

375
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:22,823
- Finished?
- Yes.

376
00:14:24,293 --> 00:14:25,823
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

377
00:14:25,993 --> 00:14:27,463
Go to the beach. Go to the right.

378
00:14:27,863 --> 00:14:29,032
Did you leave the car here?

379
00:14:29,033 --> 00:14:30,893
Yes. He took the key.

380
00:14:30,933 --> 00:14:32,703
Does this include the tickets?

381
00:14:32,863 --> 00:14:34,202
Do you only have the receipt?

382
00:14:34,203 --> 00:14:35,403
For 300 pesos. Yes.

383
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,103
Are there no tickets?

384
00:14:37,373 --> 00:14:39,843
(There are no ferry tickets.)

385
00:14:39,943 --> 00:14:40,973
Excuse me.

386
00:14:41,543 --> 00:14:42,912
Are there no tickets?

387
00:14:42,913 --> 00:14:44,143
They have them.

388
00:14:44,813 --> 00:14:47,013
- They have them? You have them?
- Yes.

389
00:14:47,213 --> 00:14:48,242
We don't have them.

390
00:14:48,243 --> 00:14:49,513
(The staff members only bought tickets for themselves.)

391
00:14:49,883 --> 00:14:53,753
They need their own tickets. We bought tickets for ourselves.

392
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,393
If we could speak so well, why did you stand and watch?

393
00:14:57,693 --> 00:15:00,262
- You can speak so well.
- We need three more tickets.

394
00:15:00,263 --> 00:15:01,722
(Rule 3 of the expedition)

395
00:15:01,723 --> 00:15:03,733
(The production crew only records without interfering.)

396
00:15:04,263 --> 00:15:06,563
- Can I use it? Thank you.
- Yes.

397
00:15:07,303 --> 00:15:09,072
(Then why did CEO Lee pay 300 pesos?)

398
00:15:09,073 --> 00:15:11,702
- Kwang Soo paid for the valet.
- So this is for the valet, right?

399
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:13,443
- Yes, this is for the valet.
- Okay.

400
00:15:14,003 --> 00:15:15,572
(He only paid for the valet.)

401
00:15:15,573 --> 00:15:16,673
How much is the total?

402
00:15:18,443 --> 00:15:19,612
- What?
- You tried to leave...

403
00:15:19,613 --> 00:15:20,743
after paying for the valet.

404
00:15:22,313 --> 00:15:24,053
This is the fun part of the trip.

405
00:15:24,153 --> 00:15:26,253
(It's more like a language barrier.)

406
00:15:26,353 --> 00:15:28,653
- Thank you, my friend.
- You're welcome.

407
00:15:29,623 --> 00:15:31,092
How will we get the car back?

408
00:15:31,093 --> 00:15:32,293
I don't know. Don't ask.

409
00:15:32,363 --> 00:15:33,662
(CEO Lee has become sensitive...)

410
00:15:33,663 --> 00:15:34,923
(after the English listening comprehension test.)

411
00:15:34,993 --> 00:15:36,763
Don't we need a ticket?

412
00:15:36,863 --> 00:15:37,933
What ticket?

413
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:40,063
Excuse me.

414
00:15:40,303 --> 00:15:42,402
- So when we come back...
- It's the same one.

415
00:15:42,403 --> 00:15:43,773
- The same one?
- Yes, the same one.

416
00:15:44,003 --> 00:15:45,903
- Okay. Thank you.
- Thank you, my friend.

417
00:15:46,073 --> 00:15:47,442
My friend, have fun.

418
00:15:47,443 --> 00:15:48,472
(He learned a way to look like he's fluent in English.)

419
00:15:48,473 --> 00:15:50,142
I'm sorry,

420
00:15:50,143 --> 00:15:51,912
but Woo Bin did all the talking. Why are you saying goodbye again?

421
00:15:51,913 --> 00:15:53,982
- He's my friend.
- Your friend?

422
00:15:53,983 --> 00:15:55,713
- Bye.
- Bye.

423
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,783
(After purchasing the tickets,)

424
00:15:59,023 --> 00:16:01,923
(the expedition team walks to the port.)

425
00:16:04,753 --> 00:16:06,562
Guys, they have mangos.

426
00:16:06,563 --> 00:16:07,623
Let's try one.

427
00:16:07,663 --> 00:16:08,732
- Let's try it.
- Mango with chilli powder.

428
00:16:08,733 --> 00:16:09,862
He cuts it for you.

429
00:16:09,863 --> 00:16:11,792
(They spot a fruit street stall.)

430
00:16:11,793 --> 00:16:13,062
- Coconuts.
- Let's try it.

431
00:16:13,063 --> 00:16:14,633
- Coconuts and mangos.
- What is it? Coconuts?

432
00:16:14,663 --> 00:16:15,702
- Mango.
- Hi.

433
00:16:15,703 --> 00:16:16,732
The mangos are sweet.

434
00:16:16,733 --> 00:16:18,303
- How much is it?
- It's 150.

435
00:16:18,403 --> 00:16:19,603
It's 150?

436
00:16:20,203 --> 00:16:21,273
It's 10 dollars.

437
00:16:21,603 --> 00:16:23,043
- Just 1.
- Just 1?

438
00:16:24,013 --> 00:16:25,782
- It's salt.
- This is salt.

439
00:16:25,783 --> 00:16:27,543
- It's sweet.
- You sprinkle salt on it.

440
00:16:27,643 --> 00:16:29,482
- It's not spicy. It's good.
- It's sweet?

441
00:16:29,483 --> 00:16:31,313
- Spicy.
- You want spicy?

442
00:16:31,883 --> 00:16:32,923
Please.

443
00:16:34,053 --> 00:16:35,253
Lemon and spicy?

444
00:16:37,523 --> 00:16:38,593
Lemon?

445
00:16:40,893 --> 00:16:42,993
- You squeeze lemon on mangos?
- I know, right?

446
00:16:43,033 --> 00:16:44,762
(Mango con Chile:)

447
00:16:44,763 --> 00:16:46,562
(Mango sprinkled with chilli powder, salt, and lime)

448
00:16:46,563 --> 00:16:47,863
Wasn't that too much?

449
00:16:47,963 --> 00:16:49,173
Nice.

450
00:16:49,533 --> 00:16:51,473
- Good?
- Delicious?

451
00:16:52,043 --> 00:16:53,872
Delicious. The mangos are sweet.

452
00:16:53,873 --> 00:16:54,903
Thank you.

453
00:16:58,013 --> 00:17:00,143
Mangos with chilli powder. That's chilli powder, right?

454
00:17:00,543 --> 00:17:01,883
Chilli powder and lemon.

455
00:17:02,853 --> 00:17:06,183
(The culinary director tries it first.)

456
00:17:09,193 --> 00:17:10,992
- How is it?
- Is it good?

457
00:17:10,993 --> 00:17:12,893
Does the mango and chilli powder mix well?

458
00:17:13,563 --> 00:17:14,693
(Impressed)

459
00:17:16,163 --> 00:17:17,692
How is it this good?

460
00:17:17,693 --> 00:17:19,503
(The culinary director is shocked.)

461
00:17:20,103 --> 00:17:21,563
- The chilli powder?
- Yes.

462
00:17:22,133 --> 00:17:23,702
It's not spicy at all.

463
00:17:23,703 --> 00:17:24,773
Hey, guys.

464
00:17:25,203 --> 00:17:27,403
(The auditor tries it as well.)

465
00:17:27,873 --> 00:17:29,273
- Isn't it really good?
- Is it good?

466
00:17:30,473 --> 00:17:32,042
- Kwang Soo.
- I don't think it'll work together.

467
00:17:32,043 --> 00:17:33,613
- At first...
- No, they work well together.

468
00:17:33,943 --> 00:17:35,283
The first bite is weird.

469
00:17:36,113 --> 00:17:37,282
But it tastes like...

470
00:17:37,283 --> 00:17:38,823
- a dish.
- Right?

471
00:17:41,183 --> 00:17:42,252
Good, right?

472
00:17:42,253 --> 00:17:44,192
(After tasting the mango, he smiles like a dad.)

473
00:17:44,193 --> 00:17:45,763
It's really good.

474
00:17:46,163 --> 00:17:47,793
- Spicy, salty, - Tangy.

475
00:17:47,863 --> 00:17:50,132
tangy, and sweet. They all exist.

476
00:17:50,133 --> 00:17:52,463
You can taste it in order.

477
00:17:53,563 --> 00:17:55,303
It takes a while.

478
00:17:55,873 --> 00:17:57,232
The chilli powder isn't your usual kind.

479
00:17:57,233 --> 00:17:58,673
It tastes like instant noodle seasoning.

480
00:17:59,073 --> 00:18:00,603
- The mango itself is nice.
- Yes.

481
00:18:00,743 --> 00:18:02,243
The mango is delicious.

482
00:18:03,043 --> 00:18:04,472
(Wanting to dig in continuously)

483
00:18:04,473 --> 00:18:05,613
How much is it?

484
00:18:05,783 --> 00:18:07,412
It's 150 pesos, right?

485
00:18:07,413 --> 00:18:08,583
(About 10 dollars)

486
00:18:09,453 --> 00:18:11,553
We could totally make that in Korea.

487
00:18:11,713 --> 00:18:14,452
You'd have to start by planting a mango tree. Can you do it?

488
00:18:14,453 --> 00:18:16,092
(GBRB: Story about planting mangos and failing)

489
00:18:16,093 --> 00:18:17,692
- Plant mangos?
- We'd fail for sure.

490
00:18:17,693 --> 00:18:19,223
Good mangos are sold, so why?

491
00:18:20,093 --> 00:18:21,922
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

492
00:18:21,923 --> 00:18:24,463
(Heading to Cozumel after a delicious snack)

493
00:18:27,563 --> 00:18:29,503
- This is a real vacation spot.
- Yes.

494
00:18:30,573 --> 00:18:32,972
It's giving off Daecheon Beach vibes.

495
00:18:32,973 --> 00:18:34,742
Yes, totally.

496
00:18:34,743 --> 00:18:36,343
With a seafood restaurant...

497
00:18:37,273 --> 00:18:39,343
- It must be a leather workshop.
- Probably.

498
00:18:39,483 --> 00:18:40,643
It's pretty.

499
00:18:42,113 --> 00:18:44,183
Bracelets like those are cute, aren't they?

500
00:18:45,753 --> 00:18:49,353
(Woo Bin is reminded of something at the mention of bracelets.)

501
00:18:49,593 --> 00:18:50,693
Kwang Soo.

502
00:18:51,093 --> 00:18:52,593
(Look.)

503
00:18:56,133 --> 00:18:57,293
- The ring?
- What?

504
00:18:57,563 --> 00:18:58,763
Where's your ring?

505
00:19:00,103 --> 00:19:02,572
I put it in my sweatpants in the morning...

506
00:19:02,573 --> 00:19:04,503
before washing up.

507
00:19:04,603 --> 00:19:06,072
Those sweatpants are in here.

508
00:19:06,073 --> 00:19:07,242
I'll check once we check in.

509
00:19:07,243 --> 00:19:09,173
- Mine is also in my sweatpants.
- Really?

510
00:19:10,013 --> 00:19:11,973
- It was when I washed up.
- If I remember correctly...

511
00:19:16,653 --> 00:19:17,952
Don't take it off, Kwang Soo.

512
00:19:17,953 --> 00:19:19,223
Keep it on.

513
00:19:19,953 --> 00:19:21,283
It feels wrong.

514
00:19:23,423 --> 00:19:25,153
(He can't help but feel upset.)

515
00:19:25,223 --> 00:19:26,493
What's up with you two?

516
00:19:27,623 --> 00:19:29,793
Keep it on, Kwang Soo. We have it.

517
00:19:29,893 --> 00:19:31,162
What does this mean?

518
00:19:31,163 --> 00:19:32,303
Am I the only stupid one here?

519
00:19:33,063 --> 00:19:34,702
- I'll put it on later.
- We were busy in the morning.

520
00:19:34,703 --> 00:19:36,302
I had it on even when we went swimming.

521
00:19:36,303 --> 00:19:37,803
It was a busy morning, Kwang Soo.

522
00:19:39,543 --> 00:19:41,373
You two must have a secret reason.

523
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:43,472
(Ultimately, they fight over the same reason.)

524
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,213
Do you really want me to flip out?

525
00:19:46,113 --> 00:19:47,312
Why won't you wear it?

526
00:19:47,313 --> 00:19:48,513
Just why?

527
00:19:49,413 --> 00:19:50,483
We'll put it on.

528
00:19:50,553 --> 00:19:53,553
(Are you the only one sincere about it?)

529
00:19:54,023 --> 00:19:56,453
It's not like I asked for it.

530
00:19:57,723 --> 00:20:00,363
I'm not sure if this friendship is only precious to me.

531
00:20:01,293 --> 00:20:04,133
Are such tokens only special to me?

532
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,333
Going through these feelings is hateful.

533
00:20:07,563 --> 00:20:10,533
I'm not the type to enjoy one-sided love.

534
00:20:13,773 --> 00:20:18,243
(Said Kwang Soo, who is in unrequited love.)

539
00:20:39,503 --> 00:20:41,663
(KKPP International Expedition)

540
00:20:42,503 --> 00:20:46,043
(They're on the boat to the island.)

541
00:20:48,103 --> 00:20:50,113
Have some, Kyung Soo. Drink all the water.

542
00:20:51,243 --> 00:20:52,582
Just now...

543
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,442
- I scratched here, and it hurt.
- Right?

544
00:20:54,443 --> 00:20:55,812
(Vitamin)

545
00:20:55,813 --> 00:20:56,913
- From getting burnt?
- Yes.

546
00:20:57,483 --> 00:20:58,652
Do you want some ointment for it?

547
00:20:58,653 --> 00:21:00,183
My legs are...

548
00:21:00,423 --> 00:21:01,682
But if he sweats...

549
00:21:01,683 --> 00:21:02,892
(Vitamin)

550
00:21:02,893 --> 00:21:04,892
My legs are itchy.

551
00:21:04,893 --> 00:21:07,123
(The auditor gives them vitamin supplements like a mom.)

552
00:21:07,763 --> 00:21:10,433
(After the two take it, he takes one himself.)

553
00:21:10,763 --> 00:21:12,663
- This boat is nice.
- I know, right?

554
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:15,232
Don't let your guard down.

555
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:16,803
You can get seasick.

556
00:21:17,233 --> 00:21:18,602
(Yesterday's seasickness was intense.)

557
00:21:18,603 --> 00:21:19,843
Don't use your phone.

558
00:21:21,273 --> 00:21:23,913
(The boat sails off.)

559
00:21:25,713 --> 00:21:27,143
No, don't.

560
00:21:28,043 --> 00:21:29,353
Stop.

561
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:35,122
(After a forced meditation to prevent seasickness)

562
00:21:35,123 --> 00:21:36,352
(A little while later)

563
00:21:36,353 --> 00:21:37,422
We're here.

564
00:21:37,423 --> 00:21:38,823
He's right. I can see it.

565
00:21:39,863 --> 00:21:42,592
- It's not raining, is it?
- No.

566
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:44,093
The rain stopped, Kwang Soo.

567
00:21:45,293 --> 00:21:46,732
- Once we get off...
- Let's go to the...

568
00:21:46,733 --> 00:21:49,133
- The check-in...
- Our check-in is at 4pm.

569
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:52,472
- We've got time.
- There's some time to kill.

570
00:21:52,473 --> 00:21:54,372
Are we going to a coffee shop?

571
00:21:54,373 --> 00:21:55,942
- No.
- Then let's go to the room.

572
00:21:55,943 --> 00:21:57,742
I'd go to a coffee shop if we could check in...

573
00:21:57,743 --> 00:21:58,983
after a short wait.

574
00:21:59,343 --> 00:22:00,543
- Should we travel by car?
- What?

575
00:22:01,283 --> 00:22:02,513
What is it?

576
00:22:03,253 --> 00:22:05,453
- I just got a message.
- Okay.

577
00:22:06,353 --> 00:22:08,182
The room we inquired about...

578
00:22:08,183 --> 00:22:10,993
has been booked through a different app.

579
00:22:11,723 --> 00:22:14,262
The owner wants to recommend another cool room...

580
00:22:14,263 --> 00:22:15,733
just below it.

581
00:22:17,233 --> 00:22:19,403
True, we didn't get the confirmation e-mail.

582
00:22:19,503 --> 00:22:21,502
(The room they booked got cancelled.)

583
00:22:21,503 --> 00:22:22,633
There must've been a misunderstanding.

584
00:22:22,773 --> 00:22:24,173
There are two rooms.

585
00:22:24,573 --> 00:22:26,703
With two beds.

586
00:22:26,773 --> 00:22:28,772
(Only a smaller room can be booked.)

587
00:22:28,773 --> 00:22:30,443
Can't one of us sleep on the sofa?

588
00:22:31,813 --> 00:22:32,983
We're in a pinch.

589
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:36,383
- What matters is how much it is.
- Exactly.

590
00:22:37,513 --> 00:22:39,623
That was the only room available...

591
00:22:39,683 --> 00:22:41,883
at that price range.

592
00:22:42,053 --> 00:22:45,022
It was either a poorer or a much fancier place.

593
00:22:45,023 --> 00:22:46,062
Those were our other options.

594
00:22:46,063 --> 00:22:47,992
The room in between was that one.

595
00:22:47,993 --> 00:22:49,063
It looked nice.

596
00:22:49,093 --> 00:22:50,363
It looked really nice.

597
00:22:51,033 --> 00:22:52,732
- Kwang Soo, let's get off...
- For one night.

598
00:22:52,733 --> 00:22:54,032
and go to a coffee shop first.

599
00:22:54,033 --> 00:22:55,603
- Yes.
- We have to decide on a room.

600
00:22:56,203 --> 00:22:57,633
Let's get off first.

601
00:22:58,003 --> 00:23:01,843
(They agree to discuss the room again.)

602
00:23:06,013 --> 00:23:07,643
The weather is crazy nice.

603
00:23:08,283 --> 00:23:10,082
- It's like a different day.
- Right?

604
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:11,713
(The suddenly sunny place)

605
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:16,952
(Where the emerald waters of the Caribbean Sea flow quietly)

606
00:23:16,953 --> 00:23:22,063
(A paradise where peace resides)

607
00:23:22,293 --> 00:23:24,262
(Along the coastal road that continues...)

608
00:23:24,263 --> 00:23:26,232
(throughout the island's outline)

609
00:23:26,233 --> 00:23:29,072
(The island where nature and the sea meet)

610
00:23:29,073 --> 00:23:32,073
(Arrived at Cozumel)

611
00:23:32,503 --> 00:23:34,672
(Heading to a nearby coffee shop)

612
00:23:34,673 --> 00:23:36,713
- Gosh.
- That's what you call green.

613
00:23:38,613 --> 00:23:39,882
It's so clear.

614
00:23:39,883 --> 00:23:40,983
(A port at the exit of the dock)

615
00:23:41,013 --> 00:23:42,412
You can see the bottom.

616
00:23:42,413 --> 00:23:43,853
The colour is completely different.

617
00:23:44,013 --> 00:23:46,352
(The sea is clear to the point that it's transparent.)

618
00:23:46,353 --> 00:23:48,122
The water is really clean.

619
00:23:48,123 --> 00:23:49,693
You can see the bottom.

620
00:23:50,223 --> 00:23:52,193
- It's like tap water.
- Exactly.

621
00:23:52,863 --> 00:23:54,993
It was cloudy and raining where we left.

622
00:23:55,663 --> 00:23:57,833
Like a totally different country,

623
00:23:58,663 --> 00:23:59,833
it's sunny here.

624
00:24:00,533 --> 00:24:01,702
This place gives off...

625
00:24:01,703 --> 00:24:03,273
- real vacation spot vibes.
- Yes.

626
00:24:04,233 --> 00:24:05,773
It's like a foreign country.

627
00:24:06,173 --> 00:24:07,303
This is a foreign country.

628
00:24:07,573 --> 00:24:08,643
True.

629
00:24:10,473 --> 00:24:12,583
I'll check if we got a reply from Airbnb.

630
00:24:12,713 --> 00:24:15,213
(He inquired about the leftover room.)

631
00:24:15,883 --> 00:24:17,453
What? Now, we can't book...

632
00:24:17,483 --> 00:24:19,052
- that room today.
- What?

633
00:24:19,053 --> 00:24:20,623
It has already been booked.

634
00:24:20,653 --> 00:24:21,823
You're right.

635
00:24:22,123 --> 00:24:24,293
- Let's do some searching.
- We have to find a new place.

636
00:24:25,593 --> 00:24:26,663
How about here?

637
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:28,963
(They entered the coffee shop feeling anxious.)

638
00:24:29,263 --> 00:24:32,093
- We have to find a room to stay.
- Yes.

639
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:35,162
A same-day booking won't be easy.

640
00:24:35,163 --> 00:24:36,273
Exactly.

641
00:24:37,403 --> 00:24:39,142
Rooms...

642
00:24:39,143 --> 00:24:40,443
- Rooms...
- Let's search together.

643
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,943
We can't stay in such a place again.

644
00:24:45,713 --> 00:24:46,883
Show me.

645
00:24:47,483 --> 00:24:48,582
Isn't that the same house?

646
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:50,112
(They found a room reminding them of ants.)

647
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:51,583
That is a fiery pit.

648
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:55,082
(Searching for a room again)

649
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:56,193
All set.

650
00:24:56,593 --> 00:24:59,823
There's a nice room right next to where we are.

651
00:25:00,323 --> 00:25:01,463
If you look here...

652
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:04,162
But there are two beds,

653
00:25:04,163 --> 00:25:06,833
so one of us needs to sleep in the living room.

654
00:25:07,133 --> 00:25:08,433
It's clean though.

655
00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:09,873
I don't mind it.

656
00:25:10,503 --> 00:25:12,673
- It's 500 dollars per night.
- Cozumel.

657
00:25:14,403 --> 00:25:15,942
- Guys, - What?

658
00:25:15,943 --> 00:25:17,043
look.

659
00:25:17,313 --> 00:25:18,572
There's only one room.

660
00:25:18,573 --> 00:25:20,283
- Let's book it.
- We have to hurry up.

661
00:25:20,713 --> 00:25:22,583
Do it quickly. It's the same-day booking.

662
00:25:23,353 --> 00:25:25,052
- We might get turned down.
- Yes.

663
00:25:25,053 --> 00:25:26,253
Get in touch first.

664
00:25:26,953 --> 00:25:28,723
What if you sleep on the beach today?

665
00:25:28,783 --> 00:25:30,993
- Because there are no rooms?
- Until the very last day...

666
00:25:31,253 --> 00:25:32,762
How about we rent a car...

667
00:25:32,763 --> 00:25:33,963
and sleep in there?

668
00:25:35,463 --> 00:25:37,432
If there are no options, book the earlier place...

669
00:25:37,433 --> 00:25:38,893
and another room.

670
00:25:39,033 --> 00:25:40,233
We can't book it.

671
00:25:40,803 --> 00:25:42,772
While we were on the boat,

672
00:25:42,773 --> 00:25:44,403
- that room had been...
- Already?

673
00:25:45,073 --> 00:25:47,203
- Were there many bookings?
- Woo Bin got the message.

674
00:25:48,203 --> 00:25:50,613
The entire apartment is booked today.

675
00:25:51,613 --> 00:25:53,483
- This place is...
- But we booked that place.

676
00:25:55,743 --> 00:25:56,982
- Did you book a room?
- Yes.

677
00:25:56,983 --> 00:25:58,112
Because you were booking that room,

678
00:25:58,113 --> 00:26:00,382
we also booked one right after you did.

679
00:26:00,383 --> 00:26:01,622
Did you get the confirmation?

680
00:26:01,623 --> 00:26:03,092
- Was it two rooms?
- Two rooms were left.

681
00:26:03,093 --> 00:26:04,093
Are they confirmed?

682
00:26:04,853 --> 00:26:06,793
They must have gotten one of the rooms.

683
00:26:06,863 --> 00:26:09,832
- Yes, we got the confirmation.
- You're right.

684
00:26:09,833 --> 00:26:11,293
Maybe you took our room.

685
00:26:12,393 --> 00:26:13,802
They took our room.

686
00:26:13,803 --> 00:26:16,303
No, we didn't. We didn't take your room.

687
00:26:16,933 --> 00:26:19,843
Excuse me, we tried to book that room first.

688
00:26:21,043 --> 00:26:23,413
(The truth only hurts the members.)

689
00:26:23,743 --> 00:26:25,312
We can't book the place right away.

690
00:26:25,313 --> 00:26:26,983
We have to wait for the reply.

691
00:26:28,283 --> 00:26:32,113
Sleeping at a nice place on the last night...

692
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:34,823
would make it feel like our whole trip was...

693
00:26:35,053 --> 00:26:37,252
Never mind. That room was so bad that it might not work.

694
00:26:37,253 --> 00:26:38,253
(The Cancun room popped into his head.)

695
00:26:38,254 --> 00:26:40,023
It wasn't just bad.

696
00:26:41,123 --> 00:26:42,263
Honestly...

697
00:26:43,363 --> 00:26:45,133
My army barracks were way better than that room.

698
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:48,503
(While he's reminiscing about the past)

699
00:26:49,103 --> 00:26:50,773
- Wait.
- What is it?

700
00:26:51,673 --> 00:26:53,403
Wait, some payment went through.

701
00:26:53,843 --> 00:26:55,602
- It's been confirmed.
- Where?

702
00:26:55,603 --> 00:26:56,873
The room just now.

703
00:26:57,273 --> 00:26:59,413
(Cheering out of relief)

704
00:26:59,483 --> 00:27:01,013
I'll send you the link.

705
00:27:01,813 --> 00:27:03,752
At least you got a room in a rush.

706
00:27:03,753 --> 00:27:06,423
Exactly. What a relief.

707
00:27:07,783 --> 00:27:08,852
(It's time for some coffee.)

708
00:27:08,853 --> 00:27:10,953
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

709
00:27:13,263 --> 00:27:16,492
(The coffee is decreasing fast.)

710
00:27:16,493 --> 00:27:18,893
He's done the minute it came out. What are you thinking?

711
00:27:19,063 --> 00:27:21,903
(He finished the coffee within a second.)

712
00:27:22,363 --> 00:27:24,673
(Pouring)

713
00:27:24,833 --> 00:27:28,073
Wherever we go, the guys fill up my cup.

714
00:27:28,773 --> 00:27:30,313
Woo Bin doesn't drink much coffee.

715
00:27:31,373 --> 00:27:34,843
Woo Bin pours some of his into mine when mine is empty.

716
00:27:35,213 --> 00:27:38,213
Kyung Soo gives me the leftover.

717
00:27:38,853 --> 00:27:42,793
(Each has a different way of taking care of Kwang Soo.)

718
00:27:44,023 --> 00:27:46,192
Let's change into our team uniform...

719
00:27:46,193 --> 00:27:47,923
and take a scooter.

720
00:27:48,623 --> 00:27:50,563
If we find a nice beach,

721
00:27:51,393 --> 00:27:53,802
we can swim for a short while.

722
00:27:53,803 --> 00:27:54,833
(Touring Cozumel on a scooter)

723
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:56,802
How about we stop by this place?

724
00:27:56,803 --> 00:27:57,833
Where?

725
00:27:58,073 --> 00:27:59,803
- There's a coastal road.
- Okay.

726
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:03,113
- It's along the seaside.
- Nice.

727
00:28:03,313 --> 00:28:05,313
Go straight, and there's the exit.

728
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:07,613
We can take this road.

729
00:28:08,443 --> 00:28:09,653
When did you find it?

730
00:28:10,153 --> 00:28:11,912
Did you already check out a scooter rental place?

731
00:28:11,913 --> 00:28:12,982
(Nodding)

732
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:14,523
I don't get such results.

733
00:28:16,623 --> 00:28:18,193
Which website do you use?

734
00:28:19,393 --> 00:28:20,923
I use a Korean website.

735
00:28:21,563 --> 00:28:23,463
I swear nothing popped up.

736
00:28:23,593 --> 00:28:25,632
- If Koreans visited the place...
- Right.

737
00:28:25,633 --> 00:28:27,003
and liked it, they would write about it.

738
00:28:27,463 --> 00:28:28,703
I only use Google.

739
00:28:28,803 --> 00:28:30,503
I make great use of the map.

740
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:32,603
I only read comments from people.

741
00:28:32,873 --> 00:28:34,502
I only use Naver's community board.

742
00:28:34,503 --> 00:28:36,213
(Relying on domestic reviews)

743
00:28:36,243 --> 00:28:38,473
The reason I don't search on Naver...

744
00:28:39,143 --> 00:28:42,112
is that the place will be famous among Koreans.

745
00:28:42,113 --> 00:28:45,483
But I want to go to places that Koreans...

746
00:28:45,783 --> 00:28:48,152
- A new place?
- don't know.

747
00:28:48,153 --> 00:28:49,453
On Naver,

748
00:28:49,553 --> 00:28:52,023
I search, "Places in Cancun Koreans rarely visit."

749
00:28:53,193 --> 00:28:55,563
Among the results, I look for one with the fewest views.

750
00:28:55,923 --> 00:28:58,593
That's where places are recommended in secret.

751
00:28:58,763 --> 00:28:59,902
- In secret?
- Smart.

752
00:28:59,903 --> 00:29:02,203
(An unusual research secret)

753
00:29:03,003 --> 00:29:04,033
Shall we get going?

754
00:29:07,043 --> 00:29:10,213
(Going to the room to check in)

755
00:29:10,243 --> 00:29:12,113
This is a nice vintage shop.

756
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:15,743
Such bags are nice and pretty on a trip.

757
00:29:16,013 --> 00:29:17,313
It'd look good on you.

758
00:29:17,513 --> 00:29:19,723
If only we had bought 1 on our 1st day here.

759
00:29:19,923 --> 00:29:21,783
(A desirable receipt bag)

760
00:29:22,083 --> 00:29:24,493
You should keep being the auditor on our future trips.

761
00:29:25,523 --> 00:29:26,963
The stress is unimaginable, Kwang Soo.

762
00:29:27,923 --> 00:29:30,293
I hope you get a chance to keep track of the money.

763
00:29:31,863 --> 00:29:33,633
I'd go home after spending it all.

764
00:29:36,403 --> 00:29:37,903
That kid is so cute.

765
00:29:38,803 --> 00:29:42,173
(A kid in a Spider-Man suit)

766
00:29:42,973 --> 00:29:44,613
(Shooting)

767
00:29:44,913 --> 00:29:46,013
(Shooting back shyly)

768
00:29:51,513 --> 00:29:53,823
He was literally like that kid in the Spider-Man animation.

769
00:29:55,053 --> 00:29:57,393
Since it's a vacation spot,

770
00:29:57,923 --> 00:29:59,423
everyone is much more easygoing.

771
00:30:00,993 --> 00:30:02,763
Everyone is so laid-back.

772
00:30:04,163 --> 00:30:08,533
This is a nice place to come for a vacation.

773
00:30:09,473 --> 00:30:11,333
The apartment is brand new, guys.

774
00:30:12,133 --> 00:30:13,803
- Is this the place?
- Yes.

775
00:30:15,203 --> 00:30:16,242
We're here.

776
00:30:16,243 --> 00:30:17,543
(Arrived at the apartment)

777
00:30:17,673 --> 00:30:18,912
- Hey, guys.
- Hello.

778
00:30:18,913 --> 00:30:19,943
How are you, guys?

779
00:30:20,043 --> 00:30:21,583
- Good, how are you?
- Good, thanks.

780
00:30:21,813 --> 00:30:23,752
This is the English version.

781
00:30:23,753 --> 00:30:27,023
If you could read the instructions here. It's just a regular...

782
00:30:27,553 --> 00:30:28,983
Turn right, yes?

783
00:30:30,353 --> 00:30:31,652
- Even the door itself is new.
- Gosh.

784
00:30:31,653 --> 00:30:33,193
- Everything is new.
- Right?

785
00:30:33,863 --> 00:30:34,863
We're here.

786
00:30:35,663 --> 00:30:37,092
(How's the inside?)

787
00:30:37,093 --> 00:30:38,163
Hash.

788
00:30:38,863 --> 00:30:42,033
- One, zero, zero, hash.
- Zero, Zero, hash.

789
00:30:43,233 --> 00:30:44,602
Nice.

790
00:30:44,603 --> 00:30:48,073
(Impressed)

791
00:30:49,543 --> 00:30:51,243
- Hold on.
- This is amazing.

792
00:30:51,773 --> 00:30:53,683
- It smells of new wood. Great.
- Isn't it nice?

793
00:30:54,243 --> 00:30:56,212
It's super clean.

794
00:30:56,213 --> 00:30:57,253
(It's much cleaner than expected.)

795
00:30:57,813 --> 00:31:00,083
- It's really nice.
- I love it.

796
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:02,552
Two of us can sleep here.

797
00:31:02,553 --> 00:31:04,523
- Yes.
- We totally can.

798
00:31:05,493 --> 00:31:06,963
Goodness.

799
00:31:07,723 --> 00:31:08,992
- What?
- This place is awesome.

800
00:31:08,993 --> 00:31:10,133
- It's so nice.
- Yes.

801
00:31:12,393 --> 00:31:14,302
- No wonder it's expensive.
- You can see the sea.

802
00:31:14,303 --> 00:31:15,632
My gosh.

803
00:31:15,633 --> 00:31:18,373
(The room is nice, but the view is nicer.)

804
00:31:20,573 --> 00:31:21,943
Even the door is smooth.

805
00:31:22,643 --> 00:31:24,412
It's... Listen, guys.

806
00:31:24,413 --> 00:31:26,683
I've never felt such smoothness since coming to Mexico.

807
00:31:26,813 --> 00:31:28,842
- In the past...
- Compare it with the previous one.

808
00:31:28,843 --> 00:31:30,682
- Yes, it was like that.
- It was impossible.

809
00:31:30,683 --> 00:31:32,153
- In the past...
- Compare it with the previous one.

810
00:31:32,483 --> 00:31:33,953
(Acting enthusiastically)

811
00:31:34,583 --> 00:31:37,653
(Expressing their excitement with their bodies)

812
00:31:37,993 --> 00:31:39,223
Nice.

813
00:31:39,663 --> 00:31:40,863
Perfect!

814
00:31:42,723 --> 00:31:44,193
It's just so nice.

815
00:31:44,633 --> 00:31:45,862
The room is amazing.

816
00:31:45,863 --> 00:31:48,233
(Conveying their excitement all the way to the first floor)

817
00:31:48,533 --> 00:31:50,903
This is the kind of trip I was dreaming of.

818
00:31:51,903 --> 00:31:53,573
Finally, on the last day.

819
00:31:55,673 --> 00:31:57,113
I'm lighting up the candles today.

820
00:31:57,843 --> 00:32:00,183
(The last day of the trip has become fancy.)

821
00:32:00,313 --> 00:32:01,713
It's so nice.

822
00:32:02,113 --> 00:32:03,353
Gosh.

823
00:32:05,353 --> 00:32:07,183
- It's not all that impressive.
- We're overreacting.

824
00:32:07,623 --> 00:32:09,352
It's magnetic. Goodness.

825
00:32:09,353 --> 00:32:10,423
(After calming down)

826
00:32:10,853 --> 00:32:13,023
- Let's do our laundry first.
- Okay.

827
00:32:13,163 --> 00:32:15,323
Or how about we decide on the rooms?

828
00:32:15,523 --> 00:32:16,733
Let's do it.

829
00:32:17,333 --> 00:32:19,233
- Two and one?
- Two and one.

830
00:32:19,863 --> 00:32:22,103
Got it. If you get the single room...

831
00:32:22,463 --> 00:32:23,802
It'd be a palace.

832
00:32:23,803 --> 00:32:25,902
Rock-paper-scissors.

833
00:32:25,903 --> 00:32:29,613
Rock-paper-scissors.

834
00:32:30,343 --> 00:32:32,443
(Kwang Soo goes first.)

835
00:32:32,543 --> 00:32:34,243
I never got to use a room alone.

836
00:32:34,443 --> 00:32:35,813
No, not during this trip.

837
00:32:40,153 --> 00:32:41,452
- One.
- Nice.

838
00:32:41,453 --> 00:32:42,453
Okay.

839
00:32:45,423 --> 00:32:46,493
Gosh.

840
00:32:47,063 --> 00:32:48,063
Next.

841
00:32:51,363 --> 00:32:53,633
(Next is Kyung Soo's turn.)

842
00:32:55,103 --> 00:32:56,803
(Nervous)

843
00:32:58,733 --> 00:32:59,973
Three. Good.

844
00:33:00,973 --> 00:33:03,243
(On to the next number)

845
00:33:04,143 --> 00:33:05,913
Okay. Not bad. It's 15.

846
00:33:06,583 --> 00:33:07,613
It's not bad.

847
00:33:09,013 --> 00:33:11,113
(Currently, in 1st place is Kyung Soo.)

848
00:33:12,613 --> 00:33:14,353
Five. You need a number over three.

849
00:33:15,253 --> 00:33:16,522
Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

850
00:33:16,523 --> 00:33:17,553
(He got a favourable number.)

851
00:33:19,293 --> 00:33:21,222
Okay!

852
00:33:21,223 --> 00:33:22,223
(As expected of the 0 Boy)

853
00:33:22,723 --> 00:33:24,592
Okay!

854
00:33:24,593 --> 00:33:26,262
(Kyung Soo gets the last single room.)

855
00:33:26,263 --> 00:33:27,832
You young little...

856
00:33:27,833 --> 00:33:29,973
(Singing)

857
00:33:32,133 --> 00:33:33,743
- Nice.
- He keeps getting the single room.

858
00:33:35,773 --> 00:33:37,712
(A paradise)

859
00:33:37,713 --> 00:33:38,843
I'm in total bliss.

860
00:33:39,173 --> 00:33:40,183
I'm jealous.

861
00:33:42,113 --> 00:33:44,282
It's so cool in here!

862
00:33:44,283 --> 00:33:45,483
(The bitter losers)

863
00:33:45,683 --> 00:33:46,923
Let's do the laundry, Kwang Soo.

864
00:33:47,923 --> 00:33:49,153
Thank you, guys.

865
00:33:49,423 --> 00:33:50,423
Happy much?

866
00:33:50,923 --> 00:33:53,463
(You're once again using the room by yourself.)

867
00:33:53,923 --> 00:33:55,623
Ever since coming here,

868
00:33:56,893 --> 00:33:59,563
I used the room alone...

869
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:00,863
except for that stressful place.

870
00:34:01,633 --> 00:34:04,472
This has never happened before.

871
00:34:04,473 --> 00:34:07,043
But on this trip,

872
00:34:07,403 --> 00:34:08,643
I've been really lucky.

873
00:34:09,943 --> 00:34:11,572
Woo Bin got zero again.

874
00:34:11,573 --> 00:34:14,213
I think Woo Bin will forever be a zero-getter.

875
00:34:15,313 --> 00:34:16,683
I'm a zero-getter.

876
00:34:17,583 --> 00:34:20,283
(The person himself is here.)

877
00:34:20,453 --> 00:34:23,723
There was a time I got 0 6 times in a row.

878
00:34:24,793 --> 00:34:26,592
I have a feeling I'll get a zero right now.

879
00:34:26,593 --> 00:34:27,663
- Do you have your phone?
- Yes.

880
00:34:27,963 --> 00:34:29,022
(Can he really feel it?)

881
00:34:29,023 --> 00:34:30,192
There's this feeling, you know?

882
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,833
(Can he really feel it?)

883
00:34:32,433 --> 00:34:33,463
Something like this.

884
00:34:35,803 --> 00:34:36,973
I'm a zero-getter.

885
00:34:37,803 --> 00:34:39,943
(He has given up.)

886
00:34:40,103 --> 00:34:41,943
Say that I win in a rock-paper-scissors game,

887
00:34:43,043 --> 00:34:44,713
and the winner has to get the lowest number?

888
00:34:45,113 --> 00:34:46,213
Then I don't get a zero.

889
00:34:48,343 --> 00:34:49,543
It drives me nuts.

890
00:34:51,753 --> 00:34:55,453
(GBRB: Joy Pops Laugh Pops)

891
00:34:56,123 --> 00:34:57,123
(Maintenance time)

892
00:34:57,124 --> 00:34:58,453
Give me your laundry.

893
00:34:58,923 --> 00:35:00,363
Here's mine.

894
00:35:00,423 --> 00:35:01,623
Is this everything?

895
00:35:01,963 --> 00:35:03,832
- Kwang Soo hasn't...
- He has.

896
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:04,893
- Is that so?
- Yes.

897
00:35:06,133 --> 00:35:07,403
How long will it take?

898
00:35:08,233 --> 00:35:10,533
- About an hour.
- Yes, it'll take about an hour.

899
00:35:11,303 --> 00:35:13,173
It might take longer since it's hot water.

900
00:35:14,473 --> 00:35:15,643
Shall we wear that?

901
00:35:15,803 --> 00:35:17,413
- The KKPP top?
- Yes, the KKPP top.

902
00:35:19,643 --> 00:35:22,943
(Changed into the team uniform for the scooter ride)

903
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,683
- I have your passports.
- Good.

904
00:35:25,783 --> 00:35:27,722
- Our driver's licenses.
- I have them.

905
00:35:27,723 --> 00:35:28,753
Okay.

906
00:35:30,123 --> 00:35:31,692
It's a little breezy.

907
00:35:31,693 --> 00:35:32,752
Right?

908
00:35:32,753 --> 00:35:34,463
(Expedition day 7: Ride scooters)

909
00:35:34,823 --> 00:35:36,432
The colours here are pretty.

910
00:35:36,433 --> 00:35:37,493
- Right?
- Totally.

911
00:35:39,033 --> 00:35:40,062
This place...

912
00:35:40,063 --> 00:35:42,033
(Every alley is full of local vibes.)

913
00:35:42,103 --> 00:35:44,103
is giving off...

914
00:35:44,373 --> 00:35:45,802
(Cozumel's charm is its colourfulness.)

915
00:35:45,803 --> 00:35:46,973
local vibes.

916
00:35:47,073 --> 00:35:49,372
It'd feel amazing to ride scooters in this weather.

917
00:35:49,373 --> 00:35:50,672
It'd be more than amazing.

918
00:35:50,673 --> 00:35:51,743
(The weather is perfect for the expedition team.)

919
00:35:52,913 --> 00:35:54,243
(Yielding)

920
00:35:56,913 --> 00:35:59,583
- Wait.
- He greeted us back.

921
00:36:00,053 --> 00:36:01,053
Really?

922
00:36:01,053 --> 00:36:02,053
(The driver greeted them back with the same hand sign.)

923
00:36:02,054 --> 00:36:04,192
People truly come first in this country.

924
00:36:04,193 --> 00:36:06,053
And since it's a touristy area,

925
00:36:06,423 --> 00:36:07,823
- everyone is nice.
- I know.

926
00:36:09,193 --> 00:36:10,363
That's right.

927
00:36:11,463 --> 00:36:12,832
Shall we take a photo at the wall?

928
00:36:12,833 --> 00:36:13,903
That's a good idea.

929
00:36:14,163 --> 00:36:15,502
(CEO Lee takes out a film camera.)

930
00:36:15,503 --> 00:36:16,903
A wall like this looks good in photos.

931
00:36:17,103 --> 00:36:19,903
It matches the colour of your outfit.

932
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,502
(He begins running the photo factory.)

933
00:36:22,503 --> 00:36:24,243
Take it as I'm walking.

934
00:36:27,113 --> 00:36:28,213
(Clicking)

935
00:36:28,583 --> 00:36:30,013
I think it was a bit fast.

936
00:36:33,283 --> 00:36:34,323
(Clicking)

937
00:36:34,383 --> 00:36:35,922
I think it was a bit slow.

938
00:36:35,923 --> 00:36:37,193
(I think it was a bit slow.)

939
00:36:37,323 --> 00:36:39,093
- Let's try again.
- I'll just stand still.

940
00:36:40,523 --> 00:36:41,593
(Clicking)

941
00:36:42,393 --> 00:36:44,463
(Thankfully, he got a nice photo.)

942
00:36:44,533 --> 00:36:45,562
Is that what you like?

943
00:36:45,563 --> 00:36:47,462
I like it when I'm on the edge...

944
00:36:47,463 --> 00:36:49,162
to bring out the vibes.

945
00:36:49,163 --> 00:36:50,432
I'll take it.

946
00:36:50,433 --> 00:36:52,103
(This photographer prefers natural-looking photos.)

947
00:36:52,803 --> 00:36:54,443
Do you want to be on the edge?

948
00:36:54,743 --> 00:36:55,873
Wait.

949
00:37:00,983 --> 00:37:03,153
(It's a part of the sunglasses.)

950
00:37:04,813 --> 00:37:07,653
(Do you see the future of KKPP Foods?)

951
00:37:09,823 --> 00:37:11,123
You always pose like that for photos.

952
00:37:12,793 --> 00:37:16,093
(It's a part of the sunglasses.)

953
00:37:16,493 --> 00:37:18,133
Please take a photo of the three of us.

954
00:37:22,103 --> 00:37:25,203
(Hello, we're KKPP Foods.)

955
00:37:25,673 --> 00:37:26,772
(My goodness)

956
00:37:26,773 --> 00:37:28,573
- Yeong Seok, let's take one.
- It's okay.

957
00:37:28,643 --> 00:37:29,943
- Let's get a photo together.
- It's okay.

958
00:37:30,013 --> 00:37:31,013
(No, thank you.)

959
00:37:31,113 --> 00:37:32,412
(For goodness' sake!)

960
00:37:32,413 --> 00:37:34,143
You guys don't know how to enjoy the trip.

961
00:37:37,313 --> 00:37:39,513
There are so many photo spots.

962
00:37:42,923 --> 00:37:46,093
(They continue to enjoy the trip.)

963
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:49,063
Kyung Soo, would you do this here?

964
00:37:49,763 --> 00:37:51,692
- Do this just once.
- What?

965
00:37:51,693 --> 00:37:52,732
Pretend to swim.

966
00:37:52,733 --> 00:37:53,903
Pose like that person.

967
00:37:55,663 --> 00:37:57,433
- Woo Bin, do this.
- What?

968
00:37:58,333 --> 00:37:59,473
One, two, three.

969
00:38:00,343 --> 00:38:04,113
(They also take strange photos.)

970
00:38:05,273 --> 00:38:06,882
You're taking photos without thinking, right?

971
00:38:06,883 --> 00:38:09,783
No. Photos like these are memorable.

972
00:38:10,253 --> 00:38:12,282
It looks like you're taking photos without thinking.

973
00:38:12,283 --> 00:38:13,622
I'll be reminded of this moment.

974
00:38:13,623 --> 00:38:15,123
(With people who don't know how to enjoy the trip)

975
00:38:16,453 --> 00:38:17,823
You know,

976
00:38:18,793 --> 00:38:20,993
this photo came out very well.

977
00:38:22,763 --> 00:38:25,163
I'll let you post it on Instagram.

978
00:38:25,433 --> 00:38:30,733
(They wrap up the fun photo time.)

979
00:38:31,633 --> 00:38:33,643
Moped rental in Cozumel.

980
00:38:34,003 --> 00:38:35,143
Moped.

981
00:38:36,143 --> 00:38:38,072
- This is the place.
- Is this the place?

982
00:38:38,073 --> 00:38:40,382
Moped rental in Cozumel.

983
00:38:40,383 --> 00:38:41,613
Where does it say that?

984
00:38:42,543 --> 00:38:44,583
- What's this?
- Let's see.

985
00:38:45,153 --> 00:38:46,182
It's this one.

986
00:38:46,183 --> 00:38:47,183
(They get lost near the establishment.)

987
00:38:48,423 --> 00:38:50,493
What are you looking for? What company?

988
00:38:50,653 --> 00:38:52,023
- Moped.
- Moped.

989
00:38:52,753 --> 00:38:54,563
- Moped.
- Are you a moped rental shop?

990
00:38:54,923 --> 00:38:55,923
- Yes.
- Moped?

991
00:38:55,924 --> 00:38:57,163
- That's a moped rental shop.
- Yes.

992
00:38:58,493 --> 00:39:00,003
Nice to meet you, my friend.

993
00:39:00,103 --> 00:39:01,232
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

994
00:39:01,233 --> 00:39:02,263
(They find a friend who will lend them scooters.)

995
00:39:03,603 --> 00:39:05,032
(They arrive at the scooter rental shop.)

996
00:39:05,033 --> 00:39:06,842
We need three.

997
00:39:06,843 --> 00:39:09,042
Do you want them for a few hours...

998
00:39:09,043 --> 00:39:10,343
or several days?

999
00:39:10,373 --> 00:39:11,513
We'll take this option.

1000
00:39:12,343 --> 00:39:14,113
- Do you want it? Okay.
- Yes.

1001
00:39:14,683 --> 00:39:17,283
This is the island. We're here.

1002
00:39:18,653 --> 00:39:22,153
This is the best route I can give.

1003
00:39:22,423 --> 00:39:24,323
Your best option is through this park.

1004
00:39:24,793 --> 00:39:26,192
Go to the right.

1005
00:39:26,193 --> 00:39:27,592
- And straight again.
- One way.

1006
00:39:27,593 --> 00:39:30,263
(He even draws on the map to give them a course.)

1007
00:39:30,563 --> 00:39:32,233
You're so kind.

1008
00:39:32,593 --> 00:39:34,003
- What?
- You're so kind.

1009
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:36,003
- So kind? What?
- Kind.

1010
00:39:36,933 --> 00:39:39,132
You're so kind.

1011
00:39:39,133 --> 00:39:40,672
- Okay. Thank you.
- You're so kind.

1012
00:39:40,673 --> 00:39:42,643
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1013
00:39:43,473 --> 00:39:44,712
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

1014
00:39:44,713 --> 00:39:47,182
(They make sure to thank him.)

1015
00:39:47,183 --> 00:39:49,142
- Give me one moment. I'll be back.
- Thank you.

1016
00:39:49,143 --> 00:39:50,513
(The kind employee leaves to get the scooters.)

1017
00:39:50,613 --> 00:39:52,452
How far will you go?

1018
00:39:52,453 --> 00:39:53,583
This is...

1019
00:39:53,823 --> 00:39:56,793
We'll go down as he has recommended.

1020
00:39:56,923 --> 00:39:59,223
If we take that route...

1021
00:39:59,323 --> 00:40:01,122
and decide that it's doable,

1022
00:40:01,123 --> 00:40:02,823
- let's circle the island.
- Okay. Let's do that.

1023
00:40:03,193 --> 00:40:05,963
If the road is tough...

1024
00:40:06,493 --> 00:40:08,302
or there isn't much to see,

1025
00:40:08,303 --> 00:40:10,032
let's come back.

1026
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:11,172
Let's circle the island no matter what.

1027
00:40:11,173 --> 00:40:12,203
Okay.

1028
00:40:12,533 --> 00:40:14,773
Circling the island will be our goal.

1029
00:40:15,273 --> 00:40:17,013
If we don't do it now,

1030
00:40:17,243 --> 00:40:18,672
we'll never do it in our lives.

1031
00:40:18,673 --> 00:40:20,842
It won't happen until we die and our bodies rot.

1032
00:40:20,843 --> 00:40:22,413
We won't circle the island.

1033
00:40:23,183 --> 00:40:25,052
We don't know if we'll come back here.

1034
00:40:25,053 --> 00:40:27,652
The chance of circling the island in the future is low.

1035
00:40:27,653 --> 00:40:28,882
- You have a point.
- Right?

1036
00:40:28,883 --> 00:40:30,093
If we don't circle the island now,

1037
00:40:30,423 --> 00:40:31,793
we'll never do it.

1038
00:40:31,853 --> 00:40:33,093
Let's circle the island, Kyung Soo.

1039
00:40:33,493 --> 00:40:34,993
- Sure.
- Okay.

1040
00:40:35,563 --> 00:40:36,592
If there are...

1041
00:40:36,593 --> 00:40:39,032
cafes or shops we want to check out,

1042
00:40:39,033 --> 00:40:40,633
we can enter.

1043
00:40:40,763 --> 00:40:43,133
There are many vintage shops too.

1044
00:40:44,933 --> 00:40:49,843
(They get ready for the ride.)

1045
00:40:50,643 --> 00:40:51,813
Heave-ho.

1046
00:40:52,643 --> 00:40:54,783
This scooter is so light.

1047
00:40:56,483 --> 00:40:58,753
Mine is totally old.

1048
00:40:58,983 --> 00:41:00,152
It's outdated.

1049
00:41:00,153 --> 00:41:01,223
That serves you right.

1050
00:41:01,323 --> 00:41:02,523
Isn't it new?

1051
00:41:02,783 --> 00:41:04,323
No, this one is new.

1052
00:41:05,023 --> 00:41:07,493
Doesn't it say D.O.? What does it say?

1053
00:41:08,093 --> 00:41:09,323
Where?

1054
00:41:09,863 --> 00:41:10,992
It says Dio.

1055
00:41:10,993 --> 00:41:13,933
(It practically has his name tag.)

1056
00:41:14,903 --> 00:41:19,103
(Everyone gets on the scooter.)

1057
00:41:20,843 --> 00:41:22,073
Bye.

1058
00:41:25,273 --> 00:41:29,383
(Everyone gets on the scooter.)

1059
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:32,313
Bye.

1060
00:41:37,693 --> 00:41:39,223
(Woo Bin takes off.)

1061
00:41:41,423 --> 00:41:43,733
(The scooter expedition team has been formed.)

1062
00:41:50,403 --> 00:41:52,133
Gosh, it's cool.

1063
00:41:53,033 --> 00:41:54,673
- It's so nice.
- It's fun, Kwang Soo.

1064
00:41:55,243 --> 00:41:57,373
I feel like a local.

1065
00:41:59,443 --> 00:42:04,113
(On the 7th day, the expedition team has gotten used to Mexico.)

1066
00:42:04,483 --> 00:42:06,113
(Exclaiming)

1067
00:42:06,583 --> 00:42:07,853
Gosh, it's cool.

1068
00:42:16,163 --> 00:42:17,363
That's our lodging.

1069
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:19,832
- That's our house.
- That's our lodging.

1070
00:42:19,833 --> 00:42:21,803
(They pass by their lodging.)

1071
00:42:22,663 --> 00:42:23,873
Red light.

1072
00:42:24,473 --> 00:42:26,333
You know, it's really cool.

1073
00:42:26,873 --> 00:42:28,742
- It feels nice.
- It feels nice.

1074
00:42:28,743 --> 00:42:30,212
The quality of this trip...

1075
00:42:30,213 --> 00:42:32,713
went up in a different way.

1076
00:42:32,973 --> 00:42:34,982
It's nice that we can drop by anywhere.

1077
00:42:34,983 --> 00:42:36,043
That's right.

1078
00:42:38,613 --> 00:42:40,753
(Even a local gives a thumbs-up.)

1079
00:42:46,823 --> 00:42:48,063
Hello.

1080
00:42:49,463 --> 00:42:52,293
(The expedition team navigates the city freely on their scooters.)

1081
00:42:53,133 --> 00:42:54,463
Kwang Soo, look at the sea.

1082
00:42:55,903 --> 00:42:58,803
(Amazed)

1083
00:43:00,743 --> 00:43:04,013
(The Caribbean Sea is right next to them.)

1084
00:43:04,143 --> 00:43:05,613
It's so pretty.

1085
00:43:05,743 --> 00:43:07,312
(My goodness)

1086
00:43:07,313 --> 00:43:12,313
(The blue colour of the Caribbean Sea makes them exclaim.)

1087
00:43:12,853 --> 00:43:17,023
(They worried about rain earlier, but the sun shines down brightly.)

1088
00:43:17,953 --> 00:43:21,963
(It's the most perfect ride.)

1089
00:43:23,563 --> 00:43:28,763
(They go deeper into nature along the coastal road.)

1090
00:43:29,103 --> 00:43:30,403
It's cool.

1091
00:43:31,303 --> 00:43:32,603
It's really cool.

1092
00:43:32,873 --> 00:43:33,942
What?

1093
00:43:33,943 --> 00:43:36,303
(They can't hear very well while riding.)

1094
00:43:43,113 --> 00:43:45,652
(His back looks passionate.)

1095
00:43:45,653 --> 00:43:48,283
(After riding passionately for a while)

1096
00:43:49,023 --> 00:43:50,353
Aren't we going to eat something?

1097
00:43:51,193 --> 00:43:52,322
I'm hungry.

1098
00:43:52,323 --> 00:43:54,563
Hold on. I'll look it up.

1099
00:43:56,323 --> 00:43:58,533
Most places are closed.

1100
00:43:59,993 --> 00:44:02,303
I guess they don't open on Mondays.

1101
00:44:03,033 --> 00:44:05,102
- Seriously.
- Let's go down this road...

1102
00:44:05,103 --> 00:44:06,803
and enter if we find something.

1103
00:44:09,773 --> 00:44:11,343
What's this place?

1104
00:44:11,773 --> 00:44:13,343
- What?
- There's something.

1105
00:44:14,113 --> 00:44:15,383
Let's go.

1106
00:44:16,613 --> 00:44:18,012
- Do you want to come in?
- Are there drinks?

1107
00:44:18,013 --> 00:44:19,013
Drinks? Yes. Come on in.

1108
00:44:19,014 --> 00:44:20,723
- Okay.
- They have drinks.

1109
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:22,953
(They decide to enter since there are drinks.)

1110
00:44:24,553 --> 00:44:25,722
Hello.

1111
00:44:25,723 --> 00:44:26,922
Hello.

1112
00:44:26,923 --> 00:44:28,363
Soft drinks are right there.

1113
00:44:28,763 --> 00:44:30,022
Shall we drink water?

1114
00:44:30,023 --> 00:44:31,333
- Good.
- There's what you like.

1115
00:44:31,463 --> 00:44:32,833
Shall I drink that?

1116
00:44:33,333 --> 00:44:34,563
I'll drink this as well.

1117
00:44:34,703 --> 00:44:36,633
(Kyung Soo chooses the same drink as Woo Bin.)

1118
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:38,432
There's a lemon flavour.

1119
00:44:38,433 --> 00:44:40,102
- Shall we try it?
- Yes.

1120
00:44:40,103 --> 00:44:42,903
(Lime-flavoured chips go into the bag as well.)

1121
00:44:43,373 --> 00:44:45,713
- Can I have the receipt?
- Yes.

1122
00:44:46,743 --> 00:44:47,812
(He doesn't forget to take the receipt.)

1123
00:44:47,813 --> 00:44:49,743
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1124
00:44:50,013 --> 00:44:52,013
- Can we drink over there?
- Of course.

1125
00:44:52,083 --> 00:44:54,683
If you'd like to walk inside, you can do it.

1126
00:44:55,083 --> 00:44:57,653
On Mondays, not many people come.

1127
00:44:58,653 --> 00:45:01,293
(He shows them where they can sit.)

1128
00:45:02,223 --> 00:45:03,323
(Oh, my)

1129
00:45:04,233 --> 00:45:05,592
- What's this place?
- The fireplace is there.

1130
00:45:05,593 --> 00:45:07,933
This is the area for chocolate.

1131
00:45:08,433 --> 00:45:09,762
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

1132
00:45:09,763 --> 00:45:10,773
Thank you.

1133
00:45:11,303 --> 00:45:13,642
- Like this...
- I didn't expect such a place.

1134
00:45:13,643 --> 00:45:14,802
- I know.
- How unusual.

1135
00:45:14,803 --> 00:45:16,203
(A mysterious garden was hidden behind the store.)

1136
00:45:18,413 --> 00:45:19,873
(Staring)

1137
00:45:20,743 --> 00:45:22,613
This place is like a museum.

1138
00:45:22,883 --> 00:45:25,713
(It's a remnant of the Mayans' cacao farming.)

1139
00:45:25,813 --> 00:45:26,852
You're right.

1140
00:45:26,853 --> 00:45:30,023
(In Mexico, a store has a museum in the back.)

1141
00:45:30,623 --> 00:45:31,723
You know,

1142
00:45:32,923 --> 00:45:34,263
this place is so pretty.

1143
00:45:34,623 --> 00:45:36,692
It's a shame.

1144
00:45:36,693 --> 00:45:38,633
They should promote the place.

1145
00:45:39,733 --> 00:45:41,032
It wasn't on Google Maps, right?

1146
00:45:41,033 --> 00:45:42,833
No. We were just passing by.

1147
00:45:42,903 --> 00:45:46,103
(CEO Lee sees everything from a business point of view.)

1148
00:45:49,073 --> 00:45:51,273
(They sit down for a snack.)

1149
00:45:51,373 --> 00:45:52,713
It smells good.

1150
00:45:52,973 --> 00:45:54,043
Seriously.

1151
00:45:54,613 --> 00:45:56,483
It smells so refreshing.

1152
00:45:57,653 --> 00:45:59,483
- It's lime-flavoured, right?
- Yes.

1153
00:46:01,653 --> 00:46:04,923
(They try the lime-flavoured chips first.)

1154
00:46:05,023 --> 00:46:06,693
(Impressed)

1155
00:46:08,863 --> 00:46:09,993
(Impressed)

1156
00:46:10,093 --> 00:46:11,233
- It's tasty.
- Yes.

1157
00:46:11,493 --> 00:46:13,033
- You know, - It smells like lime.

1158
00:46:13,093 --> 00:46:15,063
Mexicans really love this taste.

1159
00:46:18,133 --> 00:46:21,103
(Mexican-style nachos come next.)

1160
00:46:24,413 --> 00:46:25,743
It's really tasty.

1161
00:46:26,413 --> 00:46:27,883
(Nodding)

1162
00:46:27,943 --> 00:46:28,983
It tastes...

1163
00:46:29,643 --> 00:46:31,382
completely different from the Korean ones.

1164
00:46:31,383 --> 00:46:32,383
Really?

1165
00:46:32,413 --> 00:46:34,723
Compared to the Korean one,

1166
00:46:35,453 --> 00:46:36,923
there's more sourness.

1167
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:39,653
- It really smells like lime.
- Yes.

1168
00:46:39,693 --> 00:46:42,393
(Mexicans love the refreshing lime flavour.)

1169
00:46:42,463 --> 00:46:43,792
(Checking the clock)

1170
00:46:43,793 --> 00:46:45,092
It's 5:45pm.

1171
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:46,833
(Current time: 5:45pm)

1172
00:46:47,363 --> 00:46:49,063
What are you going to do? Are you going to make a circle?

1173
00:46:50,403 --> 00:46:51,903
Let's drive down the coastal road.

1174
00:46:52,573 --> 00:46:53,702
Let's drive first.

1175
00:46:53,703 --> 00:46:55,672
If we're going to come back,

1176
00:46:55,673 --> 00:46:57,442
wouldn't it be better to make a circle?

1177
00:46:57,443 --> 00:46:59,812
Why don't we come back the same way instead?

1178
00:46:59,813 --> 00:47:01,013
It'll be much faster.

1179
00:47:01,143 --> 00:47:04,153
If we make a circle, we'll take the same road...

1180
00:47:04,583 --> 00:47:05,883
we took earlier.

1181
00:47:06,383 --> 00:47:08,422
If we come back the same way, it'll take 36 minutes.

1182
00:47:08,423 --> 00:47:09,552
If we make a circle, it'll take an hour.

1183
00:47:09,553 --> 00:47:10,653
(Reach only the destination versus Make a circle)

1184
00:47:10,793 --> 00:47:12,623
You decide. I'll go with your decision.

1185
00:47:13,293 --> 00:47:15,192
Why don't we take the coastal road only?

1186
00:47:15,193 --> 00:47:16,563
(Nodding)

1187
00:47:16,863 --> 00:47:18,532
You got persuaded quickly.

1188
00:47:18,533 --> 00:47:20,163
- What?
- You got persuaded quickly.

1189
00:47:20,533 --> 00:47:23,032
If there's a different road,

1190
00:47:23,033 --> 00:47:24,372
- I'll take it.
- Seriously.

1191
00:47:24,373 --> 00:47:25,932
- But it's the same road.
- We'll just end up riding more.

1192
00:47:25,933 --> 00:47:27,842
On the map, there's...

1193
00:47:27,843 --> 00:47:30,302
some kind of a lighthouse if you go south.

1194
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:33,142
You should go there and make your way back.

1195
00:47:33,143 --> 00:47:34,282
- Let's go then.
- Let's go.

1196
00:47:34,283 --> 00:47:35,413
Let's go to the lighthouse.

1197
00:47:35,683 --> 00:47:37,852
- The lighthouse at the south.
- Okay.

1198
00:47:37,853 --> 00:47:38,883
(They decide to go to the lighthouse.)

1199
00:47:40,153 --> 00:47:41,222
- Hello.
- Bye.

1200
00:47:41,223 --> 00:47:42,922
- Bye.
- Bye.

1201
00:47:42,923 --> 00:47:43,923
Thank you for coming.

1202
00:47:43,924 --> 00:47:45,323
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1203
00:47:46,753 --> 00:47:47,823
Bye.

1204
00:47:48,493 --> 00:47:49,493
(Startled)

1205
00:47:49,494 --> 00:47:50,933
- Bye.
- Bye.

1206
00:47:52,293 --> 00:47:54,403
(They get sent off in Korean.)

1207
00:47:54,603 --> 00:47:57,133
Bye, my friend.

1208
00:47:58,073 --> 00:48:00,173
(The expedition team hits the road again.)

1209
00:48:00,303 --> 00:48:02,003
- Back there, - Yes?

1210
00:48:02,903 --> 00:48:04,312
I got a mosquito bite on my toe.

1211
00:48:04,313 --> 00:48:05,443
- Really?
- Yes.

1212
00:48:07,983 --> 00:48:09,213
(Kyung Soo waves.)

1213
00:48:11,713 --> 00:48:12,813
For goodness' sake.

1214
00:48:13,113 --> 00:48:14,153
Woo Bin.

1215
00:48:14,353 --> 00:48:16,583
- I got a mosquito bite on my toe.
- Really?

1216
00:48:16,823 --> 00:48:18,923
I got one on my calf.

1217
00:48:21,963 --> 00:48:25,093
(A huge mosquito bit me on my foot.)

1218
00:48:26,563 --> 00:48:29,533
(It tickled.)

1219
00:48:39,543 --> 00:48:42,883
(They fight ticklishness and ride for a while.)

1220
00:48:46,113 --> 00:48:48,453
It's the sea!

1221
00:48:49,523 --> 00:48:51,653
(Exclaiming)

1222
00:48:52,493 --> 00:48:55,623
(The emerald-coloured Caribbean Sea spreads out before them.)

1223
00:49:00,663 --> 00:49:02,633
It's cool. My goodness.

1224
00:49:03,603 --> 00:49:05,203
My goodness.

1225
00:49:05,573 --> 00:49:07,273
(He's truly happy.)

1226
00:49:07,743 --> 00:49:10,142
Gosh, it's the real sea.

1227
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:12,273
Kwang Soo, doesn't that boat look cool?

1228
00:49:15,913 --> 00:49:17,313
It's so pretty.

1229
00:49:18,313 --> 00:49:20,152
That boat looks like a part of the set, right?

1230
00:49:20,153 --> 00:49:22,383
(A high praise from an actor)

1231
00:49:22,583 --> 00:49:24,593
- Shall we stop?
- Sure.

1232
00:49:37,503 --> 00:49:41,243
(The expedition team stops and enjoys the Caribbean Sea.)

1233
00:49:44,343 --> 00:49:45,373
It's very pretty.

1234
00:49:46,373 --> 00:49:47,413
Seriously.

1235
00:49:49,043 --> 00:49:50,812
I think the sunset will be beautiful here.

1236
00:49:50,813 --> 00:49:51,883
Exactly.

1237
00:49:52,883 --> 00:49:54,252
I got a mosquito bite on my toe.

1238
00:49:54,253 --> 00:49:56,023
That's the worst.

1239
00:49:57,493 --> 00:49:59,023
It's so painful.

1240
00:49:59,793 --> 00:50:00,793
Woo Bin, look.

1241
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:02,563
It bit me right here.

1242
00:50:03,523 --> 00:50:05,093
It's the perfect spot for scratching.

1243
00:50:07,033 --> 00:50:11,173
(They set out toward the lighthouse again.)

1244
00:50:12,173 --> 00:50:14,243
I think we can keep going until we reach the lighthouse.

1245
00:50:14,443 --> 00:50:15,443
Yes.

1246
00:50:16,443 --> 00:50:18,043
(Singing)

1247
00:50:20,113 --> 00:50:22,943
(The scooters will head straight to the lighthouse.)

1248
00:50:28,353 --> 00:50:30,553
This road is really cool.

1249
00:50:31,393 --> 00:50:32,523
My goodness.

1250
00:50:33,523 --> 00:50:35,023
Gosh, it's cool.

1251
00:50:36,663 --> 00:50:40,363
(They enjoy the Caribbean Sea along the coastal road.)

1252
00:50:43,163 --> 00:50:44,473
My goodness.

1253
00:50:46,973 --> 00:50:49,903
(People are relaxing on the beach.)

1254
00:50:52,043 --> 00:50:54,683
(Pelicans are floating.)

1255
00:50:57,953 --> 00:50:59,413
It's so pretty.

1256
00:51:00,723 --> 00:51:03,583
(Cozumel is a therapeutic place for the expedition team.)

1257
00:51:06,523 --> 00:51:08,623
(After 30 minutes of riding,)

1258
00:51:10,123 --> 00:51:12,833
(they arrive at the lighthouse.)

1259
00:51:15,263 --> 00:51:17,503
(Looking around)

1260
00:51:19,603 --> 00:51:20,973
Is this the lighthouse?

1261
00:51:22,273 --> 00:51:23,803
I think we came to the wrong place.

1262
00:51:24,643 --> 00:51:26,473
- Is this the lighthouse?
- I think...

1263
00:51:27,313 --> 00:51:29,283
we came to the wrong place.

1264
00:51:29,683 --> 00:51:32,583
This is where the lighthouse is located, but...

1265
00:51:33,483 --> 00:51:36,223
(This is the way to the lighthouse.)

1266
00:51:36,323 --> 00:51:38,093
(However,)

1267
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:41,723
(it's closed since it's past the operating hours.)

1268
00:51:43,063 --> 00:51:47,703
(Had it been open, the team would've seen this.)

1269
00:51:48,933 --> 00:51:50,363
There's no one here.

1270
00:51:50,463 --> 00:51:52,603
(Laughing)

1271
00:51:54,573 --> 00:51:58,213
(They decide to get their photos taken.)

1272
00:51:59,173 --> 00:52:00,243
I'll take it now.

1273
00:52:01,343 --> 00:52:03,013
One, two, three.

1274
00:52:03,413 --> 00:52:05,183
(Smiling right away)

1275
00:52:06,583 --> 00:52:09,583
(They become professional when they get their photos taken.)

1276
00:52:11,823 --> 00:52:13,393
One, two, three.

1277
00:52:15,623 --> 00:52:17,063
One, two, three.

1278
00:52:17,223 --> 00:52:19,263
(They take a jump shot that suits the youthful expedition.)

1279
00:52:20,263 --> 00:52:21,403
Did you get it?

1280
00:52:22,303 --> 00:52:23,603
My goodness.

1281
00:52:23,703 --> 00:52:25,233
- It looks good.
- It looks good.

1282
00:52:26,273 --> 00:52:29,603
(They're perfectly in the air.)

1283
00:52:31,913 --> 00:52:33,843
(It's time for Kyung Soo's solo shots.)

1284
00:52:34,313 --> 00:52:35,913
(Smiling)

1285
00:52:35,943 --> 00:52:38,313
(The married couple looks at their son who grew up well.)

1286
00:52:39,053 --> 00:52:40,283
This place looks amazing...

1287
00:52:41,183 --> 00:52:42,922
- in photos.
- I know.

1288
00:52:42,923 --> 00:52:46,093
- It's a photo spot.
- Aren't you glad you came here?

1289
00:52:48,023 --> 00:52:50,363
(The production crew feels better.)

1290
00:52:51,133 --> 00:52:53,393
(The older members like the photos,)

1291
00:52:54,303 --> 00:52:56,763
(so they have a photo time in earnest.)

1292
00:52:58,503 --> 00:53:01,473
(He's disinterested.)

1293
00:53:03,303 --> 00:53:04,643
Hey, Doh Kyung Soo!

1294
00:53:05,013 --> 00:53:06,073
Yes?

1295
00:53:07,043 --> 00:53:08,283
Come over here and join us.

1296
00:53:09,083 --> 00:53:10,083
For what?

1297
00:53:10,213 --> 00:53:11,713
Come over here and take photos with us.

1298
00:53:13,053 --> 00:53:14,453
You don't wear your ring.

1299
00:53:16,623 --> 00:53:18,023
You've lost your bracelet.

1300
00:53:18,693 --> 00:53:19,923
I'm wearing the bracelet.

1301
00:53:20,523 --> 00:53:23,163
(He shows that he's wearing the friendship bracelet.)

1302
00:53:23,923 --> 00:53:25,093
Get your photos taken over there.

1303
00:53:25,193 --> 00:53:26,193
Why?

1304
00:53:26,194 --> 00:53:28,433
Get into a push-up position next to the tiger.

1305
00:53:30,133 --> 00:53:33,373
(Director gets apprehended.)

1306
00:53:34,743 --> 00:53:36,102
(He kneels next to the tiger...)

1307
00:53:36,103 --> 00:53:37,303
(that obviously looks like a lion.)

1308
00:53:38,313 --> 00:53:40,273
(When Kyung Soo poses,)

1309
00:53:41,183 --> 00:53:43,813
(paparazzi flock over.)

1310
00:53:45,113 --> 00:53:48,283
(The man who dotes on Kyung Soo smiles from ear to ear.)

1311
00:53:48,983 --> 00:53:51,293
(Kyung Soo in the older members' eyes)

1312
00:53:54,823 --> 00:53:56,993
(The expedition team get ready to leave.)

1313
00:53:57,123 --> 00:53:59,263
- You have insects on your face.
- Really?

1314
00:53:59,633 --> 00:54:00,962
They're tiny.

1315
00:54:00,963 --> 00:54:02,632
- They aren't insects.
- Mayflies.

1316
00:54:02,633 --> 00:54:04,672
- Dirt got on my face.
- It's dust.

1317
00:54:04,673 --> 00:54:05,933
(Giggling)

1318
00:54:06,033 --> 00:54:07,303
Do you know...

1319
00:54:07,433 --> 00:54:09,943
how I looked behind the sunglasses?

1320
00:54:10,303 --> 00:54:11,373
I seriously did this.

1321
00:54:12,513 --> 00:54:14,582
Seriously. I rode the scooter like this.

1322
00:54:14,583 --> 00:54:15,683
(Encore)

1323
00:54:17,013 --> 00:54:18,082
I mean,

1324
00:54:18,083 --> 00:54:20,212
dirt kept splattering on my face.

1325
00:54:20,213 --> 00:54:21,552
(Last time)

1326
00:54:21,553 --> 00:54:23,182
I did this. Didn't you?

1327
00:54:23,183 --> 00:54:24,523
I did the same.

1328
00:54:24,653 --> 00:54:27,423
(That's how it is when you exercise outside in summer.)

1329
00:54:29,123 --> 00:54:32,263
(They check their appearance before setting off.)

1330
00:54:32,963 --> 00:54:34,162
(Opening his mouth)

1331
00:54:34,163 --> 00:54:37,103
(He even checks the inside of his mouth.)

1332
00:54:37,433 --> 00:54:40,302
(They planned to see the sunset at downtown, the next destination.)

1333
00:54:40,303 --> 00:54:41,973
(Current time: 6:50pm)

1334
00:54:42,103 --> 00:54:43,673
Not much time remains.

1335
00:54:44,073 --> 00:54:45,273
We need to hurry up.

1336
00:54:45,443 --> 00:54:46,612
(They have about 30 minutes before the sun sets at 7:20pm.)

1337
00:54:46,613 --> 00:54:47,943
The sun moved over there.

1338
00:54:48,143 --> 00:54:49,183
Really?

1339
00:54:49,583 --> 00:54:50,982
It's behind the trees.

1340
00:54:50,983 --> 00:54:53,983
(The sun is setting already.)

1341
00:54:54,983 --> 00:54:57,993
(Feeling pressed, they head over to downtown right away.)

1342
00:55:01,163 --> 00:55:05,363
(Rushing to the sunset point)

1343
00:55:06,733 --> 00:55:10,063
(Kyung Soo's scooter slows down.)

1344
00:55:10,333 --> 00:55:11,972
(He needs to speed up.)

1345
00:55:11,973 --> 00:55:13,572
(Clenching his lips)

1346
00:55:13,573 --> 00:55:15,943
(Beep)

1347
00:55:22,113 --> 00:55:25,583
(The scooter turned off.)

1348
00:55:26,513 --> 00:55:30,183
(The other two notice something strange and turn around.)

1349
00:55:31,823 --> 00:55:34,492
(He tries to start it again.)

1350
00:55:34,493 --> 00:55:35,693
Are you okay?

1351
00:55:36,393 --> 00:55:37,593
It won't move.

1352
00:55:38,963 --> 00:55:40,132
It's broken.

1353
00:55:40,133 --> 00:55:41,303
It won't start.

1354
00:55:42,333 --> 00:55:45,103
(The scooter is broken.)

1355
00:55:45,273 --> 00:55:46,373
Are you okay?

1356
00:55:47,103 --> 00:55:48,273
It won't move.

1357
00:55:49,643 --> 00:55:50,912
It's broken.

1358
00:55:50,913 --> 00:55:52,113
It won't start.

1359
00:55:53,043 --> 00:55:56,013
(The scooter is broken.)

1360
00:55:57,143 --> 00:56:00,313
(The auditor quickly takes a U-turn and returns.)

1361
00:56:01,183 --> 00:56:02,353
What's wrong?

1362
00:56:03,423 --> 00:56:04,492
- What?
- It's broken.

1363
00:56:04,493 --> 00:56:05,653
It won't move?

1364
00:56:05,993 --> 00:56:07,323
It starts.

1365
00:56:08,223 --> 00:56:09,592
But it...

1366
00:56:09,593 --> 00:56:10,723
It won't move.

1367
00:56:11,863 --> 00:56:12,863
(The CEO approaches him with worries.)

1368
00:56:12,864 --> 00:56:13,963
What's wrong?

1369
00:56:14,403 --> 00:56:16,403
- It's broken.
- It's broken.

1370
00:56:18,103 --> 00:56:19,202
It starts,

1371
00:56:19,203 --> 00:56:20,403
but if I pull it,

1372
00:56:21,203 --> 00:56:22,373
it turns off.

1373
00:56:23,673 --> 00:56:26,112
- All kinds of stuff happen to us.
- I know.

1374
00:56:26,113 --> 00:56:27,513
It's the last day.

1375
00:56:27,573 --> 00:56:29,442
This happens when the oil change isn't done.

1376
00:56:29,443 --> 00:56:31,483
(The expedition team has a tough time to the end.)

1377
00:56:32,183 --> 00:56:34,153
We have to go see the sunset.

1378
00:56:35,253 --> 00:56:37,223
- We won't be able to see it.
- We will...

1379
00:56:37,323 --> 00:56:39,123
return it.

1380
00:56:39,823 --> 00:56:41,292
Kyung Soo, how are you going to get there?

1381
00:56:41,293 --> 00:56:42,293
- Behind Kwang Soo.
- Behind me.

1382
00:56:42,294 --> 00:56:43,322
Behind Kwang Soo?

1383
00:56:43,323 --> 00:56:45,192
We do that often in Seoul.

1384
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:46,262
Really?

1385
00:56:46,263 --> 00:56:47,263
(Used to it)

1386
00:56:47,264 --> 00:56:48,303
Okay.

1387
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:50,362
This is very rare.

1388
00:56:50,363 --> 00:56:51,702
(Rare things continue to happen to the expedition team.)

1389
00:56:51,703 --> 00:56:52,803
I know.

1390
00:56:55,443 --> 00:56:56,802
Wait until I turn it.

1391
00:56:56,803 --> 00:56:58,472
(Seated)

1392
00:56:58,473 --> 00:56:59,642
I'm on it already.

1393
00:56:59,643 --> 00:57:01,343
(Brazen)

1394
00:57:01,683 --> 00:57:02,842
See you later.

1395
00:57:02,843 --> 00:57:07,083
(Setting off in a rush to see the sunset)

1396
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:10,653
(Close)

1397
00:57:11,153 --> 00:57:13,053
Gosh, my eyes are at ease.

1398
00:57:13,793 --> 00:57:15,723
You're my windshield right now.

1399
00:57:16,523 --> 00:57:18,663
- What?
- You're my windshield right now.

1400
00:57:19,133 --> 00:57:21,903
(An unexpectedly satisfying drive)

1401
00:57:23,733 --> 00:57:25,432
(Falling)

1402
00:57:25,433 --> 00:57:26,573
Hey, it's raining...

1403
00:57:27,503 --> 00:57:29,072
- It's raining.
- What?

1404
00:57:29,073 --> 00:57:30,143
It's raining.

1405
00:57:30,443 --> 00:57:32,072
No! It's raining!

1406
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:33,413
(No! It's raining!)

1407
00:57:34,483 --> 00:57:38,712
(The genre suddenly changes due to the rain.)

1408
00:57:38,713 --> 00:57:39,912
(Raindrops falling)

1409
00:57:39,913 --> 00:57:41,322
(Screaming)

1410
00:57:41,323 --> 00:57:42,382
(Laughing)

1411
00:57:42,383 --> 00:57:43,983
(They look like a disaster movie.)

1412
00:57:44,283 --> 00:57:45,422
It's raining.

1413
00:57:45,423 --> 00:57:50,093
(He looks like a youth movie.)

1414
00:57:50,323 --> 00:57:51,663
It stings.

1415
00:57:51,733 --> 00:57:53,762
(Laughing, screaming)

1416
00:57:53,763 --> 00:57:56,332
(It's a tragedy when seen in close-up.)

1417
00:57:56,333 --> 00:57:58,072
(Laughing)

1418
00:57:58,073 --> 00:57:59,832
(A comedy in long-shot?)

1419
00:57:59,833 --> 00:58:01,102
(Screaming)

1420
00:58:01,103 --> 00:58:02,343
(Laughing)

1421
00:58:03,873 --> 00:58:05,173
It stings.

1422
00:58:07,443 --> 00:58:08,913
Hey, the sun's getting so low.

1423
00:58:09,943 --> 00:58:11,182
The sun's already setting.

1424
00:58:11,183 --> 00:58:13,883
(The sun's almost setting.)

1425
00:58:14,653 --> 00:58:15,952
The sunset's over.

1426
00:58:15,953 --> 00:58:17,453
We have to watch it from here, right?

1427
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:19,522
- Woo Bin, - Yes?

1428
00:58:19,523 --> 00:58:21,422
- let's just watch it from there.
- Okay.

1429
00:58:21,423 --> 00:58:22,922
Let's watch it from there.

1430
00:58:22,923 --> 00:58:24,563
- We don't have time.
- Okay.

1431
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:29,903
(Switching to the nearby beach they stopped by earlier)

1432
00:58:30,203 --> 00:58:31,373
Here it is.

1433
00:58:32,403 --> 00:58:33,602
Is the cloud covering it?

1434
00:58:33,603 --> 00:58:34,973
It'll pass soon.

1435
00:58:35,973 --> 00:58:38,673
(Arriving at the sunset point)

1436
00:58:38,913 --> 00:58:40,443
(Laughing)

1437
00:58:44,043 --> 00:58:45,412
The cloud is covering it.

1438
00:58:45,413 --> 00:58:46,513
I know.

1439
00:58:49,123 --> 00:58:50,222
Still, it's pretty.

1440
00:58:50,223 --> 00:58:51,393
It's beautiful.

1441
00:58:56,363 --> 00:58:57,692
It is pretty, though.

1442
00:58:57,693 --> 00:58:58,962
It's pretty even though I can't see it.

1443
00:58:58,963 --> 00:58:59,963
- The cloud is covering it.
- That...

1444
00:58:59,964 --> 00:59:01,333
Even the cloud is beautiful.

1445
00:59:05,673 --> 00:59:07,132
This is where we took the pictures earlier.

1446
00:59:07,133 --> 00:59:08,343
- Right.
- Yes.

1447
00:59:10,403 --> 00:59:12,443
- It's appearing.
- It's appearing.

1448
00:59:14,043 --> 00:59:15,413
It doesn't last long.

1449
00:59:16,843 --> 00:59:20,153
(The sun appears briefly.)

1450
00:59:20,383 --> 00:59:21,782
Even this moment when the sun's out is pretty.

1451
00:59:21,783 --> 00:59:22,783
Yes.

1452
00:59:29,693 --> 00:59:32,433
(They sit down and enjoy the sunset.)

1453
00:59:36,033 --> 00:59:37,932
I think it's pretty...

1454
00:59:37,933 --> 00:59:39,873
- with the cloud.
- Yes.

1455
00:59:41,073 --> 00:59:42,303
Even the boat looks pretty.

1456
00:59:42,703 --> 00:59:43,703
Right.

1457
00:59:44,173 --> 00:59:45,473
It's pretty.

1458
00:59:50,083 --> 00:59:52,083
The boat looks...

1459
00:59:52,883 --> 00:59:54,383
calm from a distance.

1460
00:59:54,923 --> 00:59:56,723
(Remembering getting boat sick)

1461
00:59:58,023 --> 01:00:00,252
- Doesn't it look like a whale?
- Yes.

1462
01:00:00,253 --> 01:00:01,793
It looks like a whale shark.

1463
01:00:03,163 --> 01:00:05,263
Doesn't it look like an elephant?

1464
01:00:05,793 --> 01:00:07,533
The nose, mouth,

1465
01:00:07,693 --> 01:00:09,733
- Oh, you're right.
- and the ear.

1466
01:00:11,303 --> 01:00:13,433
It kind of looks like a jaguar.

1467
01:00:14,943 --> 01:00:16,673
(Meow)

1468
01:00:17,543 --> 01:00:18,613
No.

1469
01:00:18,973 --> 01:00:19,973
(Meow)

1470
01:00:19,974 --> 01:00:21,983
(Laughing)

1471
01:00:23,443 --> 01:00:25,412
It looks like a jaguar.

1472
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:27,883
It does look like a jaguar seen from the side.

1473
01:00:27,953 --> 01:00:29,452
It looks like it even has teeth.

1474
01:00:29,453 --> 01:00:30,923
(With the shape of the cloud coloured by the sunset,)

1475
01:00:31,123 --> 01:00:33,052
This is really cool.

1476
01:00:33,053 --> 01:00:36,423
(they recall the memories of their expedition.)

1477
01:00:37,093 --> 01:00:38,333
(Thundering)

1478
01:00:38,363 --> 01:00:40,463
- Is that thunder?
- I think so.

1479
01:00:40,493 --> 01:00:41,733
From afar.

1480
01:00:42,833 --> 01:00:44,402
That's where we have to go.

1481
01:00:44,403 --> 01:00:47,273
(Smirking)

1482
01:00:47,973 --> 01:00:48,973
It's lightning.

1483
01:00:48,974 --> 01:00:50,703
- Did it strike?
- Yes.

1484
01:00:51,543 --> 01:00:52,812
How can it be so different?

1485
01:00:52,813 --> 01:00:55,642
(The expedition team's journey is not easy to the end.)

1486
01:00:55,643 --> 01:00:59,483
(The whirring of the drone passing)

1487
01:01:00,453 --> 01:01:02,222
(Smiling, reminiscent, gazing)

1488
01:01:02,223 --> 01:01:04,222
(Smiling)

1489
01:01:04,223 --> 01:01:05,622
Did you all act just now?

1490
01:01:05,623 --> 01:01:06,793
Yes.

1491
01:01:07,253 --> 01:01:08,722
I suddenly gazed at it.

1492
01:01:08,723 --> 01:01:09,823
Me too.

1493
01:01:10,093 --> 01:01:12,192
I even added a soft smile.

1494
01:01:12,193 --> 01:01:14,703
(Laughing)

1495
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:19,132
(The expedition team chatted until the sun went down.)

1496
01:01:19,133 --> 01:01:23,043
(The expedition team chatted until the sun went down.)

1497
01:01:23,943 --> 01:01:27,543
(GBRB: Joy Pops Laugh Pops)

1498
01:01:28,143 --> 01:01:30,742
(Expedition day 7: Team dinner)

1499
01:01:30,743 --> 01:01:32,113
- Really?
- Yes.

1500
01:01:33,253 --> 01:01:34,683
This place looks nice, Kwang Soo.

1501
01:01:35,683 --> 01:01:38,123
It's not hot even without the AC.

1502
01:01:38,623 --> 01:01:40,152
It had no AC in the first place.

1503
01:01:40,153 --> 01:01:41,623
Right. I like it.

1504
01:01:44,863 --> 01:01:47,162
- Well done.
- Well done.

1505
01:01:47,163 --> 01:01:48,962
- Well done.
- Well done.

1506
01:01:48,963 --> 01:01:50,402
Well done.

1507
01:01:50,403 --> 01:01:52,633
(Thank you.)

1508
01:01:53,333 --> 01:01:54,902
(The expedition team thanks the production crew...)

1509
01:01:54,903 --> 01:01:56,043
(for their hard work.)

1510
01:01:56,243 --> 01:01:57,543
Kwang Soo, sit in the middle.

1511
01:01:57,643 --> 01:02:00,343
(Taking a seat amidst the production crew's cheer)

1512
01:02:01,743 --> 01:02:03,813
There are a lot of staff.

1513
01:02:03,913 --> 01:02:05,453
- More than expected, right?
- Yes.

1514
01:02:05,753 --> 01:02:07,482
(Going over the menu)

1515
01:02:07,483 --> 01:02:08,882
The squid fritter looks good.

1516
01:02:08,883 --> 01:02:10,252
The seafood is fresh here.

1517
01:02:10,253 --> 01:02:11,552
Let's order more later.

1518
01:02:11,553 --> 01:02:13,093
The shrimp is the best here.

1519
01:02:13,823 --> 01:02:15,793
Isn't the Mexican-style chicken the one?

1520
01:02:16,263 --> 01:02:18,632
- They also have guacamole.
- Let's eat it.

1521
01:02:18,633 --> 01:02:20,432
The Mexican-style shrimp or...

1522
01:02:20,433 --> 01:02:22,903
garlic shrimp or grilled shrimp.

1523
01:02:23,163 --> 01:02:25,172
- They have caramel custard.
- What?

1524
01:02:25,173 --> 01:02:26,403
Caramel custard.

1525
01:02:26,903 --> 01:02:29,442
Why do you always check the dessert first at a restaurant?

1526
01:02:29,443 --> 01:02:31,243
Here. Garlic shrimp.

1527
01:02:31,513 --> 01:02:32,673
It's English.

1528
01:02:32,743 --> 01:02:34,682
I think this is the Mexican shrimp.

1529
01:02:34,683 --> 01:02:35,883
(The dishes they ordered arrive.)

1530
01:02:36,113 --> 01:02:37,882
It's inside.

1531
01:02:37,883 --> 01:02:40,552
I guess you eat it with rice.

1532
01:02:40,553 --> 01:02:43,853
- Is that bacon?
- Bacon and onion...

1533
01:02:45,793 --> 01:02:49,092
The dried chilli makes it perfect for Koreans.

1534
01:02:49,093 --> 01:02:50,692
(CEO Lee tries it first.)

1535
01:02:50,693 --> 01:02:52,863
(Exclaiming)

1536
01:02:53,163 --> 01:02:54,663
(Sniffing)

1537
01:02:55,503 --> 01:02:56,962
The smell of butter is...

1538
01:02:56,963 --> 01:02:58,033
(The director takes a big bite after smelling.)

1539
01:02:58,933 --> 01:03:00,433
It has a strong scent of butter, right?

1540
01:03:00,503 --> 01:03:02,273
- How did they make this?
- This is good.

1541
01:03:02,643 --> 01:03:04,243
I taste soy sauce too.

1542
01:03:04,603 --> 01:03:06,472
- But...
- Butter soy sauce egg rice.

1543
01:03:06,473 --> 01:03:07,613
Yes.

1544
01:03:07,643 --> 01:03:08,782
It's similar,

1545
01:03:08,783 --> 01:03:10,143
but it's something I've never tried before.

1546
01:03:10,683 --> 01:03:11,983
This area has...

1547
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:14,183
delicious shrimp.

1548
01:03:14,723 --> 01:03:16,122
We need to...

1549
01:03:16,123 --> 01:03:17,652
- learn this.
- I think there is...

1550
01:03:17,653 --> 01:03:19,023
soy sauce in it.

1551
01:03:19,853 --> 01:03:21,422
- Is that fried shrimp?
- Yes.

1552
01:03:21,423 --> 01:03:22,523
(Fried shrimp arrive.)

1553
01:03:22,993 --> 01:03:25,192
(He can never miss it.)

1554
01:03:25,193 --> 01:03:26,262
It's so plump.

1555
01:03:26,263 --> 01:03:27,733
(Exclaiming)

1556
01:03:28,703 --> 01:03:31,433
(CEO Lee takes a big bite.)

1557
01:03:32,233 --> 01:03:33,632
- Let me have it.
- This is good.

1558
01:03:33,633 --> 01:03:34,843
(Nom)

1559
01:03:35,573 --> 01:03:36,902
(Fried shrimp can't be bad.)

1560
01:03:36,903 --> 01:03:38,042
It tastes like chicken.

1561
01:03:38,043 --> 01:03:39,443
- Yes.
- It's tasty.

1562
01:03:39,643 --> 01:03:41,713
I guess seafood is fresh because the sea is near.

1563
01:03:42,483 --> 01:03:43,743
Michelada.

1564
01:03:44,643 --> 01:03:46,212
Yes. Thank you.

1565
01:03:46,213 --> 01:03:48,012
(The beer, which is a must for team dinner, arrives.)

1566
01:03:48,013 --> 01:03:50,183
- Do we pour it on our own?
- What is this?

1567
01:03:50,523 --> 01:03:51,722
What is this?

1568
01:03:51,723 --> 01:03:53,423
(A famous hangover drink in Mexico)

1569
01:03:53,693 --> 01:03:55,492
We get that much?

1570
01:03:55,493 --> 01:03:56,692
It's sour.

1571
01:03:56,693 --> 01:03:57,863
It's fresh.

1572
01:03:58,893 --> 01:04:03,233
(Suggesting the CEO and the auditor smell it)

1573
01:04:04,633 --> 01:04:07,203
(The director tries it.)

1574
01:04:08,473 --> 01:04:10,043
This is chilli.

1575
01:04:11,003 --> 01:04:12,473
- Chilli powder?
- Yes.

1576
01:04:13,943 --> 01:04:16,782
(Trying again for the accurate taste)

1577
01:04:16,783 --> 01:04:18,252
Just pour it, so we can all try it.

1578
01:04:18,253 --> 01:04:19,313
It's not chilli.

1579
01:04:19,483 --> 01:04:20,712
You just said it was chilli.

1580
01:04:20,713 --> 01:04:21,882
It's chilli.

1581
01:04:21,883 --> 01:04:23,383
What are you doing?

1582
01:04:24,383 --> 01:04:25,422
(What?)

1583
01:04:25,423 --> 01:04:26,523
Woo Bin, try it.

1584
01:04:27,823 --> 01:04:30,993
I don't know how to describe it.

1585
01:04:31,533 --> 01:04:35,503
(The CEO and the auditor try it in the end.)

1586
01:04:36,033 --> 01:04:37,263
It tastes...

1587
01:04:37,933 --> 01:04:40,032
similar to what we sprinkled on the mango.

1588
01:04:40,033 --> 01:04:41,942
It is that chilli powder.

1589
01:04:41,943 --> 01:04:44,473
I think it tastes different because it's mixed.

1590
01:04:44,913 --> 01:04:46,013
It's perfect.

1591
01:04:46,873 --> 01:04:47,943
That's cool.

1592
01:04:49,813 --> 01:04:52,253
(Sniffing)

1593
01:04:52,513 --> 01:04:55,123
I've never smelled anything like this before.

1594
01:04:57,923 --> 01:05:02,323
(Trying a michelada for the first time)

1595
01:05:04,523 --> 01:05:06,763
(What?)

1596
01:05:08,833 --> 01:05:11,033
See? He takes a long time.

1597
01:05:11,433 --> 01:05:13,733
- What is it?
- What is it?

1598
01:05:14,003 --> 01:05:16,803
This isn't a beer.

1599
01:05:18,343 --> 01:05:19,913
What should I say? A cocktail?

1600
01:05:20,773 --> 01:05:22,343
It's a cocktail, but...

1601
01:05:22,913 --> 01:05:24,743
- Is it sweet?
- It's Mexico.

1602
01:05:25,453 --> 01:05:27,182
- What are you saying?
- Is it sweet?

1603
01:05:27,183 --> 01:05:28,423
- You're not making any sense.
- It's just...

1604
01:05:29,253 --> 01:05:30,282
It's...

1605
01:05:30,283 --> 01:05:32,853
(CEO Lee can't fight it and tries it.)

1606
01:05:32,893 --> 01:05:36,223
- It's not bad. It's very fresh...
- I think it's sweet and savoury.

1607
01:05:37,793 --> 01:05:42,803
(Loading the flavour expression)

1608
01:05:43,703 --> 01:05:46,232
This is something I've never tried before.

1609
01:05:46,233 --> 01:05:47,773
- It's not on your list?
- Seriously.

1610
01:05:48,033 --> 01:05:50,142
I think there's a bit of cinnamon.

1611
01:05:50,143 --> 01:05:53,143
They really like to mix the scents.

1612
01:05:53,843 --> 01:05:55,483
As if they're all perfumers.

1613
01:05:55,613 --> 01:05:57,083
Yet it's not bad.

1614
01:06:00,313 --> 01:06:02,352
- That's what happens.
- Say something.

1615
01:06:02,353 --> 01:06:03,453
(The auditor couldn't find the right expression either.)

1616
01:06:03,653 --> 01:06:05,392
You really need to come to Mexico.

1617
01:06:05,393 --> 01:06:08,153
If you try it here...

1618
01:06:08,393 --> 01:06:11,093
and express the flavour right away, I'll do anything you ask.

1619
01:06:12,893 --> 01:06:16,332
If one can explain what it tastes like...

1620
01:06:16,333 --> 01:06:18,003
(A Mexican drink mixed with beer, lime juice, and hot sauce)

1621
01:06:19,473 --> 01:06:20,873
The steak is here.

1622
01:06:22,643 --> 01:06:24,072
It comes with the potato.

1623
01:06:24,073 --> 01:06:25,343
(This time, it's a beef steak.)

1624
01:06:26,343 --> 01:06:29,013
(The expedition team tries it right away.)

1625
01:06:29,543 --> 01:06:30,843
This is good.

1626
01:06:31,853 --> 01:06:33,582
It feels like I haven't had meat for so long.

1627
01:06:33,583 --> 01:06:34,852
- I haven't had meat for so long.
- Right.

1628
01:06:34,853 --> 01:06:35,882
(Exclaiming)

1629
01:06:35,883 --> 01:06:37,852
Now that I think about it, we haven't had this in Mexico.

1630
01:06:37,853 --> 01:06:38,892
- Right.
- Never.

1631
01:06:38,893 --> 01:06:40,193
- Why didn't we?
- I don't know.

1632
01:06:40,723 --> 01:06:41,963
Oh, because we had tacos.

1633
01:06:44,823 --> 01:06:47,493
We only had tacos until the second day.

1634
01:06:49,303 --> 01:06:51,063
Anyway, what do you want to eat tomorrow?

1635
01:06:51,203 --> 01:06:53,403
Look for another pozole place? What do you want to do?

1636
01:06:54,203 --> 01:06:56,572
We were planning to have pozole yesterday.

1637
01:06:56,573 --> 01:06:57,902
But we couldn't.

1638
01:06:57,903 --> 01:06:59,313
And we're leaving at lunch tomorrow.

1639
01:06:59,743 --> 01:07:01,172
- Are we having pozole tomorrow?
- Yes.

1640
01:07:01,173 --> 01:07:02,943
Really? I didn't know.

1641
01:07:03,783 --> 01:07:05,583
(Reading the room)

1642
01:07:05,683 --> 01:07:07,253
- I just heard it now.
- Is it already set?

1643
01:07:07,353 --> 01:07:08,523
This is the first time I've heard it.

1644
01:07:08,853 --> 01:07:10,452
Have you discussed it or what?

1645
01:07:10,453 --> 01:07:11,523
The two of you...

1646
01:07:11,753 --> 01:07:15,863
I found two good taco places...

1647
01:07:16,693 --> 01:07:18,223
in Playa del Carmen.

1648
01:07:18,863 --> 01:07:20,193
I wanted to go, but I couldn't.

1649
01:07:20,293 --> 01:07:21,333
Why not?

1650
01:07:22,203 --> 01:07:23,503
Because they don't like it.

1651
01:07:25,473 --> 01:07:27,233
I'm getting scared of asking them.

1652
01:07:28,033 --> 01:07:29,903
If I asked them, they would've punched me.

1653
01:07:31,573 --> 01:07:33,913
The youngest wants to go. Go for tripe tacos.

1654
01:07:35,513 --> 01:07:37,713
No. The oldest doesn't want to go.

1655
01:07:39,183 --> 01:07:43,423
(The team dinner is getting into full swing.)

1656
01:07:43,883 --> 01:07:46,393
CEO Lee, may I start...

1657
01:07:47,023 --> 01:07:48,592
- Yes.
- the main event...

1658
01:07:48,593 --> 01:07:50,123
- of the day?
- Yes.

1659
01:07:51,063 --> 01:07:54,332
(Safely filmed with the permission of the restaurant)

1660
01:07:54,333 --> 01:07:57,432
The other day, CEO Ko Joong Seok emailed...

1661
01:07:57,433 --> 01:08:00,003
- Yes.
- CEO Lee Kwang Soo.

1662
01:08:00,703 --> 01:08:02,443
Under your decision,

1663
01:08:02,703 --> 01:08:06,073
you may have a fancy team dinner with the production crew.

1664
01:08:06,243 --> 01:08:07,712
You may spend eggiscoming's money.

1665
01:08:07,713 --> 01:08:09,382
Even though that's what he said,

1666
01:08:09,383 --> 01:08:11,443
CEO Lee Kwang Soo said that would be wrong.

1667
01:08:11,983 --> 01:08:13,182
- That's correct.
- He would thoroughly...

1668
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:15,983
spend it according to his capability.

1669
01:08:16,583 --> 01:08:18,023
That's what he said.

1670
01:08:18,253 --> 01:08:19,753
If the artists win,

1671
01:08:19,953 --> 01:08:22,093
we, the production crew, will pay for the team dinner.

1672
01:08:22,893 --> 01:08:24,793
However, if the production crew wins,

1673
01:08:25,593 --> 01:08:27,992
the artists will pay with their own credit cards.

1674
01:08:27,993 --> 01:08:29,363
Yes.

1675
01:08:30,403 --> 01:08:32,532
(The corporate card versus the personal card)

1676
01:08:32,533 --> 01:08:34,102
- Is that correct, sir?
- Yes.

1677
01:08:34,103 --> 01:08:36,503
Let me call the players.

1678
01:08:40,473 --> 01:08:41,782
(The players to participate in the team dinner payment match)

1679
01:08:41,783 --> 01:08:43,343
Throughout the whole shoot,

1680
01:08:44,113 --> 01:08:47,413
they couldn't help but fight like enemies.

1681
01:08:50,323 --> 01:08:51,422
Kim Woo Bin, come forward.

1682
01:08:51,423 --> 01:08:53,923
(Auditor Kim Woo Bin from KKPP Foods)

1683
01:08:54,023 --> 01:08:55,463
Jun Wi, come forward.

1684
01:08:55,663 --> 01:08:58,433
(Accountant Yun Jun Wi from the head office)

1685
01:08:59,663 --> 01:09:01,833
Please come forward.

1686
01:09:02,733 --> 01:09:05,103
It's one of the hot games...

1687
01:09:05,303 --> 01:09:07,202
on TikTok.

1688
01:09:07,203 --> 01:09:09,903
A member from the same team throws the cup backward.

1689
01:09:13,643 --> 01:09:16,242
You have to keep hitting the cup. If you drop it, you lose.

1690
01:09:16,243 --> 01:09:17,413
(Lose)

1691
01:09:17,583 --> 01:09:19,782
If you keep hitting it...

1692
01:09:19,783 --> 01:09:21,983
until it goes in, you win.

1693
01:09:22,553 --> 01:09:24,683
(Win)

1694
01:09:25,023 --> 01:09:28,593
I'm not good at anything physical.

1695
01:09:29,393 --> 01:09:30,622
- Actually, - I'm worried.

1696
01:09:30,623 --> 01:09:32,293
that's why we picked you two.

1697
01:09:32,933 --> 01:09:34,093
Why us two?

1698
01:09:34,233 --> 01:09:36,703
- You're not any different.
- That's true.

1699
01:09:37,503 --> 01:09:39,773
Still, I'll do my best.

1700
01:09:39,873 --> 01:09:41,132
Do your best.

1701
01:09:41,133 --> 01:09:42,303
(The number-loving senior's declaration)

1702
01:09:43,243 --> 01:09:44,403
This long...

1703
01:09:45,143 --> 01:09:46,443
and persistent fight.

1704
01:09:47,373 --> 01:09:49,743
I shall end it with my victory.

1705
01:09:50,113 --> 01:09:52,953
(The muscle-loving junior burns with passion.)

1706
01:09:53,113 --> 01:09:54,312
- Turn around.
- Who's going first?

1707
01:09:54,313 --> 01:09:55,352
- Turn around.
- Turn around.

1708
01:09:55,353 --> 01:09:57,053
Woo Bin, the rock-paper-scissors matter.

1709
01:09:57,453 --> 01:09:59,052
If you finish it at once, it's the best.

1710
01:09:59,053 --> 01:10:00,153
That's right.

1711
01:10:00,953 --> 01:10:02,763
Rock-paper-scissors.

1712
01:10:03,323 --> 01:10:04,663
(Draw)

1713
01:10:04,893 --> 01:10:06,262
The match of a spear and a shield.

1714
01:10:06,263 --> 01:10:08,133
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

1715
01:10:08,963 --> 01:10:10,062
(Win)

1716
01:10:10,063 --> 01:10:11,363
(The junior accountant goes first.)

1717
01:10:11,563 --> 01:10:12,903
Let's finish it at once.

1718
01:10:13,473 --> 01:10:14,673
Only then is it cool.

1719
01:10:14,773 --> 01:10:17,572
(Team dinner payment game, Receive The Cup)

1720
01:10:17,573 --> 01:10:19,613
When you're ready, say go.

1721
01:10:19,673 --> 01:10:20,743
One second.

1722
01:10:23,843 --> 01:10:26,853
- I'm sorry, but what are you doing?
- I'm getting sweaty.

1723
01:10:27,283 --> 01:10:28,853
Don't worry. You'll win for sure.

1724
01:10:30,223 --> 01:10:31,452
You can do it!

1725
01:10:31,453 --> 01:10:32,992
- I can do it!
- You can do it!

1726
01:10:32,993 --> 01:10:34,393
- You can do it!
- Say go.

1727
01:10:34,823 --> 01:10:37,723
(If the junior wins,)

1728
01:10:38,023 --> 01:10:40,563
(the senior doesn't even get a chance to play.)

1729
01:10:40,863 --> 01:10:42,302
- This is tense.
- Go.

1730
01:10:42,303 --> 01:10:43,303
Ready.

1731
01:10:46,333 --> 01:10:50,243
(The cup flies in the air.)

1732
01:10:52,313 --> 01:10:54,573
(The breathtaking moment)

1733
01:10:57,813 --> 01:11:01,152
(How is this game going to end?)

1734
01:11:01,153 --> 01:11:02,553
(The game begins.)

1735
01:11:04,653 --> 01:11:06,693
- What?
- You got it!

1736
01:11:08,993 --> 01:11:10,893
- What?
- You got it!

1737
01:11:12,663 --> 01:11:13,693
You got it!

1738
01:11:15,933 --> 01:11:17,903
(Failed)

1739
01:11:21,533 --> 01:11:24,202
(Even though it was his first try,)

1740
01:11:24,203 --> 01:11:26,343
(the auditor was pretty close.)

1741
01:11:27,013 --> 01:11:28,943
- What?
- You got it!

1742
01:11:29,943 --> 01:11:33,013
(Shame)

1743
01:11:34,683 --> 01:11:35,923
(Sighing)

1744
01:11:36,283 --> 01:11:38,793
(He finds it shameful as well.)

1745
01:11:40,023 --> 01:11:41,453
Kwang Soo, I got this.

1746
01:11:41,623 --> 01:11:43,623
- That was so close.
- You got it? Can you do it?

1747
01:11:43,793 --> 01:11:45,092
- I think so.
- Yes?

1748
01:11:45,093 --> 01:11:47,393
(Now that he's tried it, he's getting confident.)

1749
01:11:47,693 --> 01:11:49,162
(On the other hand)

1750
01:11:49,163 --> 01:11:51,503
Jun Wi, come forward.

1751
01:11:52,203 --> 01:11:54,773
(The senior is under more pressure after seeing the junior.)

1752
01:11:55,473 --> 01:11:57,703
Next is Participant Number Two.

1753
01:11:58,503 --> 01:11:59,842
Go, Yun Jun Wi.

1754
01:11:59,843 --> 01:12:01,773
- Good luck!
- Good luck!

1755
01:12:02,283 --> 01:12:03,443
Math major, you can do it.

1756
01:12:03,513 --> 01:12:05,453
- "Math." - Calculate the angle.

1757
01:12:05,483 --> 01:12:06,812
(Find the location of the paper cup that falls in an arc.)

1758
01:12:06,813 --> 01:12:09,623
One, two...

1759
01:12:09,653 --> 01:12:11,123
(Distracting)

1760
01:12:12,093 --> 01:12:14,552
(He may be a little less athletic.)

1761
01:12:14,553 --> 01:12:15,593
Three.

1762
01:12:16,323 --> 01:12:19,693
(But he is an expert of quadratic function's graphs.)

1763
01:12:19,993 --> 01:12:21,493
- Three.
- You got it.

1764
01:12:25,803 --> 01:12:26,873
Hey.

1765
01:12:27,503 --> 01:12:29,073
You don't even move that much?

1766
01:12:29,273 --> 01:12:30,703
- Three.
- You got it.

1767
01:12:31,603 --> 01:12:33,773
(Too short to replay)

1768
01:12:36,143 --> 01:12:37,143
Hey.

1769
01:12:37,144 --> 01:12:38,183
(Relieved)

1770
01:12:38,753 --> 01:12:39,952
- We got it.
- You have to hit it.

1771
01:12:39,953 --> 01:12:41,152
(The expedition team is relieved to see what Jun Wi's got.)

1772
01:12:41,153 --> 01:12:43,183
Kyung Soo, you throw it this time.

1773
01:12:43,883 --> 01:12:45,893
- Woo Bin, you have a bigger chance.
- You have to hit it and keep going.

1774
01:12:46,223 --> 01:12:48,662
You have to hit it for the chance.

1775
01:12:48,663 --> 01:12:50,162
I think Jun Wi's drunk.

1776
01:12:50,163 --> 01:12:51,223
He was just...

1777
01:12:51,293 --> 01:12:53,392
You were basically...

1778
01:12:53,393 --> 01:12:55,162
begging for a penny.

1779
01:12:55,163 --> 01:12:56,903
He was telling Mu Seong to score it.

1780
01:12:58,263 --> 01:13:00,903
(Wishing for the cup to go in by itself)

1781
01:13:01,733 --> 01:13:04,303
- Kyung Soo will throw it.
- Wait.

1782
01:13:04,473 --> 01:13:05,473
Let me know when you're ready.

1783
01:13:05,474 --> 01:13:07,113
- Okay.
- Throw it when Woo Bin says go.

1784
01:13:07,513 --> 01:13:10,012
Woo Bin, if you lose to Jun Wi, there's only a cliff.

1785
01:13:10,013 --> 01:13:11,043
Right.

1786
01:13:11,143 --> 01:13:12,912
- I can never stand it.
- I'll be honest with you.

1787
01:13:12,913 --> 01:13:14,483
You might not get cast anymore.

1788
01:13:15,653 --> 01:13:16,752
You've played...

1789
01:13:16,753 --> 01:13:18,222
- many manly roles until now.
- Yes.

1790
01:13:18,223 --> 01:13:21,122
If this goes wrong, it might affect your acting career.

1791
01:13:21,123 --> 01:13:22,222
I swear I'm going to do this.

1792
01:13:22,223 --> 01:13:25,433
If you lose, you have to play against my nephew.

1793
01:13:25,833 --> 01:13:27,193
Here we go.

1794
01:13:27,433 --> 01:13:28,463
Wait.

1795
01:13:30,363 --> 01:13:31,402
All right.

1796
01:13:31,403 --> 01:13:33,173
(The first time was a practice.)

1797
01:13:33,673 --> 01:13:35,643
(With the auditor's muscles...)

1798
01:13:35,943 --> 01:13:37,973
- All right.
- One, two, three.

1799
01:13:38,243 --> 01:13:39,873
(This time, he shall!)

1800
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:46,983
Failed.

1801
01:13:47,013 --> 01:13:48,013
Three.

1802
01:13:50,523 --> 01:13:53,123
(He made a good chance this time again.)

1803
01:13:53,553 --> 01:13:55,193
(But he couldn't score it.)

1804
01:13:56,763 --> 01:13:58,392
Jun Wi, you're up right away.

1805
01:13:58,393 --> 01:14:00,063
Gosh, this isn't easy.

1806
01:14:00,633 --> 01:14:02,833
I have to hit it high up.

1807
01:14:03,303 --> 01:14:04,462
Jun Wi, I'm sorry,

1808
01:14:04,463 --> 01:14:05,602
but can you...

1809
01:14:05,603 --> 01:14:07,203
- move your feet?
- Open them wide.

1810
01:14:07,333 --> 01:14:08,632
- Can you move them?
- Yes.

1811
01:14:08,633 --> 01:14:10,743
Try to take short and quick steps.

1812
01:14:11,603 --> 01:14:13,072
(Touch me!)

1813
01:14:13,073 --> 01:14:14,342
Kwang Soo.

1814
01:14:14,343 --> 01:14:15,943
Touch his heart.

1815
01:14:16,913 --> 01:14:18,213
What is this?

1816
01:14:19,453 --> 01:14:21,783
- His heart is...
- This is serious.

1817
01:14:21,913 --> 01:14:23,052
(The junior's heartbeat is at max after the two rounds.)

1818
01:14:23,053 --> 01:14:24,722
Hey, you'll die at this rate.

1819
01:14:24,723 --> 01:14:26,252
- I'm about to hyperventilate.
- Why over this?

1820
01:14:26,253 --> 01:14:28,353
- You'll die at this rate.
- "Why over this?"

1821
01:14:29,963 --> 01:14:31,222
Let's go.

1822
01:14:31,223 --> 01:14:32,562
Yes, let's go.

1823
01:14:32,563 --> 01:14:33,933
- End it.
- Here we go.

1824
01:14:34,033 --> 01:14:35,192
One...

1825
01:14:35,193 --> 01:14:36,733
(It's the senior's turn again.)

1826
01:14:37,703 --> 01:14:38,703
Three.

1827
01:14:38,704 --> 01:14:39,733
(What?)

1828
01:14:40,873 --> 01:14:41,932
Three.

1829
01:14:41,933 --> 01:14:42,943
(Bouncing)

1830
01:14:44,803 --> 01:14:45,812
(The senior doesn't seem to have a chance.)

1831
01:14:45,813 --> 01:14:47,113
Very good.

1832
01:14:47,643 --> 01:14:48,883
So bad.

1833
01:14:49,543 --> 01:14:51,343
It's like throwing at a statue.

1834
01:14:53,253 --> 01:14:54,313
Here we go.

1835
01:14:55,213 --> 01:14:56,623
- Go.
- Go.

1836
01:14:57,123 --> 01:14:59,353
(The junior had a chance at least.)

1837
01:14:59,753 --> 01:15:01,453
(What about this time?)

1838
01:15:03,993 --> 01:15:05,223
(Failed)

1839
01:15:08,133 --> 01:15:09,863
(Vain attempt)

1840
01:15:10,263 --> 01:15:11,363
Kim Woo Bin just as expected.

1841
01:15:12,803 --> 01:15:14,373
Why did you do that?

1842
01:15:14,503 --> 01:15:15,943
He couldn't even receive that.

1843
01:15:16,073 --> 01:15:18,103
I think you'll be taking a year off. Will you be okay with that?

1844
01:15:18,873 --> 01:15:20,012
I'll show you in the next round.

1845
01:15:20,013 --> 01:15:21,213
I think he'll be taking a year off.

1846
01:15:21,613 --> 01:15:23,813
(Followed by the senior account's turn)

1847
01:15:26,783 --> 01:15:28,583
(Vain attempt)

1848
01:15:28,823 --> 01:15:30,052
The light...

1849
01:15:30,053 --> 01:15:31,652
(Blaming the light)

1850
01:15:31,653 --> 01:15:33,253
- Let's shake hands.
- Let's hurry up.

1851
01:15:34,023 --> 01:15:35,222
Will you hurry up?

1852
01:15:35,223 --> 01:15:36,523
- You've met a comrade.
- But...

1853
01:15:38,523 --> 01:15:39,592
(Groaning)

1854
01:15:39,593 --> 01:15:41,433
After the count of three.

1855
01:15:43,263 --> 01:15:44,703
Did you hear Woo Bin?

1856
01:15:44,733 --> 01:15:46,833
(What? No.)

1857
01:15:47,173 --> 01:15:49,903
(His groaning echoes pitifully.)

1858
01:15:52,943 --> 01:15:54,972
(It's the senior accountant's turn again.)

1859
01:15:54,973 --> 01:15:56,143
Three.

1860
01:15:58,883 --> 01:16:00,183
(What?)

1861
01:16:01,053 --> 01:16:02,152
(It was close.)

1862
01:16:02,153 --> 01:16:03,523
- That was close.
- It's time to finish it.

1863
01:16:06,523 --> 01:16:08,052
- That was close.
- It's time to finish it.

1864
01:16:08,053 --> 01:16:09,292
It's time to finish it for real.

1865
01:16:09,293 --> 01:16:12,263
(The expedition team is anxious as Jun Wi does well.)

1866
01:16:12,893 --> 01:16:14,063
Go.

1867
01:16:14,263 --> 01:16:16,033
(The 9th try in total)

1868
01:16:17,433 --> 01:16:19,103
Woo Bin, that's good. Woo Bin!

1869
01:16:19,633 --> 01:16:20,633
Woo Bin...

1870
01:16:21,033 --> 01:16:22,743
You got it.

1871
01:16:23,703 --> 01:16:25,243
You'll succeed next time for sure.

1872
01:16:25,673 --> 01:16:26,972
- Okay.
- Jun Wi.

1873
01:16:26,973 --> 01:16:28,442
You don't have to throw it so high.

1874
01:16:28,443 --> 01:16:30,612
(They're finally getting close to winning after the 9th try.)

1875
01:16:30,613 --> 01:16:33,382
(The 13th try)

1876
01:16:33,383 --> 01:16:36,222
(The 20th try)

1877
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:37,982
I think this is going to take a while.

1878
01:16:37,983 --> 01:16:39,923
If you need to use the restroom, go now.

1879
01:16:40,123 --> 01:16:41,123
(The 29th try)

1880
01:16:41,124 --> 01:16:42,223
You can do it.

1881
01:16:42,893 --> 01:16:45,392
(The 34th try)

1882
01:16:45,393 --> 01:16:46,532
Hey. That's good.

1883
01:16:46,533 --> 01:16:48,493
(The 43rd try)

1884
01:16:49,263 --> 01:16:51,533
Seriously, they are of more or less the same.

1885
01:16:52,273 --> 01:16:55,543
(The 48th try)

1886
01:16:55,643 --> 01:16:58,102
I can't even react because it's not even close.

1887
01:16:58,103 --> 01:17:00,943
(The 51st try)

1888
01:17:01,173 --> 01:17:03,413
I'm getting tired of reacting now.

1889
01:17:04,143 --> 01:17:05,712
The servers here were...

1890
01:17:05,713 --> 01:17:07,483
watching us like this at first.

1891
01:17:09,053 --> 01:17:10,682
See the look on their faces now?

1892
01:17:10,683 --> 01:17:11,723
Kyung Soo, you try.

1893
01:17:12,123 --> 01:17:15,493
(Because they've been hitting the cup for 30 minutes now.)

1894
01:17:15,563 --> 01:17:16,892
Is this supposed to be easy?

1895
01:17:16,893 --> 01:17:18,363
Can someone else try it?

1896
01:17:19,093 --> 01:17:20,562
- Did anyone succeed it?
- For your information,

1897
01:17:20,563 --> 01:17:22,803
our writer did it after eight tries.

1898
01:17:25,833 --> 01:17:26,873
You know?

1899
01:17:26,973 --> 01:17:28,073
Or maybe we're not playing it right?

1900
01:17:29,043 --> 01:17:30,102
- I can't do it.
- How did she do it...

1901
01:17:30,103 --> 01:17:31,103
after eight tries?

1902
01:17:31,104 --> 01:17:32,713
- How did you do it?
- That's what I mean.

1903
01:17:33,113 --> 01:17:35,112
Keep your balance low.

1904
01:17:35,113 --> 01:17:36,683
- Down here?
- Yes.

1905
01:17:36,743 --> 01:17:37,743
Don't just keep hitting it.

1906
01:17:37,744 --> 01:17:39,012
When you think you've got it,

1907
01:17:39,013 --> 01:17:40,082
reduce the rebound.

1908
01:17:40,083 --> 01:17:41,683
Reduce the strength?

1909
01:17:42,583 --> 01:17:44,452
You drop it because you don't stop hitting it...

1910
01:17:44,453 --> 01:17:45,553
even when it's inside.

1911
01:17:52,393 --> 01:17:54,132
That's actually true when I think about it.

1912
01:17:54,133 --> 01:17:56,003
That's what I want to do.

1913
01:17:56,403 --> 01:17:59,703
- What can I do? I can't do it.
- You're scolding him too much.

1914
01:17:59,933 --> 01:18:01,002
(He finds the situation unfortunate as well.)

1915
01:18:01,003 --> 01:18:02,033
Who's next?

1916
01:18:02,703 --> 01:18:04,402
I got it, Kwang Soo. I got this.

1917
01:18:04,403 --> 01:18:05,442
You got it?

1918
01:18:05,443 --> 01:18:06,673
Finish it at once.

1919
01:18:07,113 --> 01:18:08,872
- Go.
- Now that you've started it,

1920
01:18:08,873 --> 01:18:10,643
- you have to end it.
- Two, three.

1921
01:18:13,713 --> 01:18:15,213
(He almost missed it.)

1922
01:18:16,923 --> 01:18:18,852
(He saved it.)

1923
01:18:18,853 --> 01:18:21,553
Go easy.

1924
01:18:23,063 --> 01:18:26,093
Go easy.

1925
01:18:26,563 --> 01:18:27,862
(He was very close.)

1926
01:18:27,863 --> 01:18:30,002
- You looked very athletic.
- Not bad.

1927
01:18:30,003 --> 01:18:31,763
- I mean it.
- It wasn't so bad.

1928
01:18:31,863 --> 01:18:33,603
- You can do it now.
- He's got it.

1929
01:18:34,473 --> 01:18:35,502
Let me cool down first.

1930
01:18:35,503 --> 01:18:36,672
He's got it.

1931
01:18:36,673 --> 01:18:37,673
(The auditor's got it.)

1932
01:18:38,203 --> 01:18:40,412
(The senior account is in a rush as the junior does well.)

1933
01:18:40,413 --> 01:18:41,513
Three.

1934
01:18:45,083 --> 01:18:46,713
(Not bad?)

1935
01:18:46,853 --> 01:18:48,613
(Please.)

1936
01:18:54,693 --> 01:18:56,593
You have to do it this time.

1937
01:18:57,893 --> 01:18:59,693
You have to do it this time.

1938
01:18:59,793 --> 01:19:01,232
- Go.
- He's got it.

1939
01:19:01,233 --> 01:19:02,763
- He's got it.
- You have to do it.

1940
01:19:02,963 --> 01:19:05,232
(The senior accountant is also getting the hang of it.)

1941
01:19:05,233 --> 01:19:06,732
- Here we go.
- Okay. Go.

1942
01:19:06,733 --> 01:19:08,273
One, two, three.

1943
01:19:20,983 --> 01:19:23,083
(It's in!)

1944
01:19:23,783 --> 01:19:26,393
(It bounced out.)

1945
01:19:30,623 --> 01:19:32,932
(He almost won.)

1946
01:19:32,933 --> 01:19:34,363
Hurry up.

1947
01:19:34,893 --> 01:19:36,403
Hurry up.

1948
01:19:37,163 --> 01:19:38,503
Hey. Remember the feel.

1949
01:19:39,773 --> 01:19:40,832
We're guaranteed...

1950
01:19:40,833 --> 01:19:42,272
- to succeed next time.
- It went in.

1951
01:19:42,273 --> 01:19:43,842
We're guaranteed to succeed next time.

1952
01:19:43,843 --> 01:19:45,473
(He felt it, but he missed it.)

1953
01:19:46,273 --> 01:19:47,572
(Jun Wi is next.)

1954
01:19:47,573 --> 01:19:48,642
Hurry up.

1955
01:19:48,643 --> 01:19:50,113
Get this drunk out of here.

1956
01:19:51,283 --> 01:19:52,783
- Here we go.
- Okay. Go.

1957
01:19:53,053 --> 01:19:54,483
One, two, three.

1958
01:19:59,023 --> 01:20:01,323
(It went in again.)

1959
01:20:03,023 --> 01:20:06,062
(Then it bounced out again.)

1960
01:20:06,063 --> 01:20:07,133
Three.

1961
01:20:18,043 --> 01:20:20,243
(In pain)

1962
01:20:20,613 --> 01:20:21,972
It really went in.

1963
01:20:21,973 --> 01:20:23,583
You had to catch it.

1964
01:20:24,943 --> 01:20:28,583
(What kind of a quirk of fate?)

1965
01:20:29,483 --> 01:20:32,352
(Auditor Woo Bin's chance again)

1966
01:20:32,353 --> 01:20:33,393
Go.

1967
01:20:34,193 --> 01:20:35,653
One, two, three.

1968
01:20:50,073 --> 01:20:52,513
(Even the competitor is sad.)

1969
01:20:53,443 --> 01:20:55,273
You're really good.

1970
01:20:55,673 --> 01:20:57,243
Hey, you're improving.

1971
01:20:57,643 --> 01:20:59,383
- Woo Bin, you got it.
- It almost went in.

1972
01:21:00,413 --> 01:21:01,812
If this were in the Summer Games,

1973
01:21:01,813 --> 01:21:02,983
you'd be the national athlete.

1974
01:21:05,053 --> 01:21:08,752
(He bounced it 19 times, but he failed in the end.)

1975
01:21:08,753 --> 01:21:09,922
- We have to end it.
- It's not easy.

1976
01:21:09,923 --> 01:21:11,522
- This really is not easy.
- We have to end it.

1977
01:21:11,523 --> 01:21:13,263
It's time for the restaurant to close.

1978
01:21:13,933 --> 01:21:16,633
(It's really time to end it.)

1979
01:21:18,003 --> 01:21:19,172
Good luck.

1980
01:21:19,173 --> 01:21:20,702
You can do it.

1981
01:21:20,703 --> 01:21:24,443
(He stably hits it and looks for his chance.)

1982
01:21:24,943 --> 01:21:26,913
Please!

1983
01:21:33,183 --> 01:21:35,383
- Jun Wi.
- You can do it.

1984
01:21:36,723 --> 01:21:39,723
Please!

1985
01:21:39,953 --> 01:21:41,153
(He received it.)

1986
01:21:45,393 --> 01:21:47,093
(He missed it.)

1987
01:21:48,463 --> 01:21:51,563
(KKPP Foods brought back to life)

1988
01:21:53,703 --> 01:21:57,373
(The head office is in agony.)

1989
01:21:58,543 --> 01:22:01,413
(The one who's in more agony than anyone else)

1990
01:22:02,343 --> 01:22:03,413
You almost had it.

1991
01:22:03,543 --> 01:22:04,843
(Groaning)

1992
01:22:05,813 --> 01:22:07,052
- You have to do it.
- You got this.

1993
01:22:07,053 --> 01:22:08,383
You have to end it.

1994
01:22:08,513 --> 01:22:09,653
You have to end it!

1995
01:22:11,353 --> 01:22:12,493
(Go!)

1996
01:22:13,053 --> 01:22:15,593
(As if there is no more chance...)

1997
01:22:15,993 --> 01:22:18,893
(if he misses it this time.)

1998
01:22:20,533 --> 01:22:21,993
One, two, three.

1999
01:22:25,903 --> 01:22:28,303
(He blocks one direction with his chest and hits it.)

2000
01:22:29,273 --> 01:22:30,643
Control it with your chest.

2001
01:22:31,003 --> 01:22:32,343
Control with your chest.

2002
01:22:32,773 --> 01:22:34,073
Control it with your chest.

2003
01:22:34,573 --> 01:22:36,013
Control with your chest.

2004
01:22:36,113 --> 01:22:38,183
(Extreme concentration)

2005
01:22:39,043 --> 01:22:41,283
(Hands getting sweaty)

2006
01:22:42,583 --> 01:22:45,253
(Almost magnificent cup trapping)

2007
01:22:45,893 --> 01:22:48,293
(In awe)

2008
01:22:53,293 --> 01:22:54,663
(Failed)

2009
01:22:55,193 --> 01:22:56,503
Why is he so good?

2010
01:22:56,933 --> 01:22:58,632
Why is he so good at it?

2011
01:22:58,633 --> 01:22:59,733
(Why is he so good at it?)

2012
01:23:00,373 --> 01:23:03,103
(The auditor controlled it as if he was possessed.)

2013
01:23:05,273 --> 01:23:06,743
(Because we were curious about how many times he hit it.)

2014
01:23:12,583 --> 01:23:14,083
Control it with your chest.

2015
01:23:14,513 --> 01:23:15,923
Control with your chest.

2016
01:23:22,253 --> 01:23:23,463
Why is he so good?

2017
01:23:24,263 --> 01:23:25,892
(He hit it 31 times.)

2018
01:23:25,893 --> 01:23:27,333
Why is he so good at it?

2019
01:23:27,963 --> 01:23:29,562
I think you can do it.

2020
01:23:29,563 --> 01:23:31,163
Next.

2021
01:23:31,863 --> 01:23:33,432
You can do it. You'll do it in three attempts.

2022
01:23:33,433 --> 01:23:34,533
- No matter what.
- Okay.

2023
01:23:34,773 --> 01:23:36,243
- Let's go.
- You're almost there.

2024
01:23:36,803 --> 01:23:38,902
- Good luck.
- Whoever succeeds...

2025
01:23:38,903 --> 01:23:40,373
(The nervous senior's turn)

2026
01:23:43,613 --> 01:23:44,843
What?

2027
01:23:49,083 --> 01:23:50,352
What?

2028
01:23:50,353 --> 01:23:52,223
(Success)

2029
01:23:54,623 --> 01:23:59,023
(The senior accountant did it.)

2030
01:24:04,233 --> 01:24:06,573
(Almost like a walk-off grand slam)

2031
01:24:08,103 --> 01:24:10,473
(A hard-to-believe result)

2032
01:24:11,703 --> 01:24:14,872
- Yun Jun Wi!
- Yun Jun Wi!

2033
01:24:14,873 --> 01:24:17,513
(Accountant Yun Jun Wi, the head office's hero)

2034
01:24:18,443 --> 01:24:20,953
(Lasting for an hour,)

2035
01:24:22,183 --> 01:24:25,853
(he is the only one who succeeded after 86 tries.)

2036
01:24:27,123 --> 01:24:31,593
(Thank you for winning and ending the game.)

2037
01:24:31,723 --> 01:24:33,933
- Great work.
- Good job.

2038
01:24:34,133 --> 01:24:37,363
- Good job.
- Well done.

2039
01:24:40,133 --> 01:24:41,403
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

2040
01:24:43,143 --> 01:24:44,842
(It was a great game.)

2041
01:24:44,843 --> 01:24:46,673
Jun Wi, you should do this.

2042
01:24:47,713 --> 01:24:49,583
This looks bad.

2043
01:24:50,383 --> 01:24:51,543
(Mocking)

2044
01:24:52,713 --> 01:24:54,313
(Hurt)

2045
01:24:55,553 --> 01:24:57,083
That was amazing.

2046
01:24:57,453 --> 01:24:59,952
It was really exciting. The thrill was...

2047
01:24:59,953 --> 01:25:01,823
(A grand showdown between rivals)

2048
01:25:02,193 --> 01:25:04,222
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

2049
01:25:04,223 --> 01:25:06,062
Order everything you want.

2050
01:25:06,063 --> 01:25:07,493
(The head office is having a party.)

2051
01:25:09,533 --> 01:25:12,873
(KKPP Foods can't bounce back easily...)

2052
01:25:13,373 --> 01:25:16,073
(from the shock of losing.)

2053
01:25:16,503 --> 01:25:19,003
(Meanwhile, the senior accountant is enjoying the afterglow.)

2054
01:25:19,373 --> 01:25:20,413
Gosh.

2055
01:25:23,483 --> 01:25:24,643
- Well done.
- Great work.

2056
01:25:25,543 --> 01:25:27,253
Did you think you'd win?

2057
01:25:28,153 --> 01:25:30,023
Honestly, at first,

2058
01:25:30,783 --> 01:25:33,153
I never thought I'd succeed,

2059
01:25:33,793 --> 01:25:35,753
so I wished he'd finish the game quickly.

2060
01:25:36,423 --> 01:25:37,723
But...

2061
01:25:38,523 --> 01:25:40,763
he turned out to be just as bad as I was.

2062
01:25:41,793 --> 01:25:44,503
Seeing that, I figured I had a chance and gave it a shot.

2063
01:25:46,373 --> 01:25:48,103
Near the end,

2064
01:25:49,033 --> 01:25:52,042
our stamina and luck must've decided...

2065
01:25:52,043 --> 01:25:53,243
our fate.

2066
01:25:54,543 --> 01:25:56,043
What's more,

2067
01:25:56,643 --> 01:25:58,983
losing to a junior accountant...

2068
01:25:59,453 --> 01:26:01,083
wouldn't have been a good ending.

2069
01:26:01,253 --> 01:26:02,582
It's a great relief.

2070
01:26:02,583 --> 01:26:05,383
(The senior has saved face.)

2071
01:26:05,423 --> 01:26:06,423
(You had many chances.)

2072
01:26:06,424 --> 01:26:08,492
Wasn't it a huge disappointment?

2073
01:26:08,493 --> 01:26:09,823
It truly is a disappointment.

2074
01:26:11,563 --> 01:26:13,493
But since Jun Wi won,

2075
01:26:13,563 --> 01:26:15,963
I feel...

2076
01:26:17,563 --> 01:26:21,202
He went through a lot, fighting me...

2077
01:26:21,203 --> 01:26:23,103
when it came to balancing the accounts.

2078
01:26:24,743 --> 01:26:26,543
It was fun.

2079
01:26:27,943 --> 01:26:28,943
Dump it on one person?

2080
01:26:30,413 --> 01:26:32,183
Let's settle it with the stopwatch.

2081
01:26:32,583 --> 01:26:35,253
(KKPP Foods' traditional stopwatch game)

2082
01:26:37,283 --> 01:26:39,123
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2083
01:26:40,853 --> 01:26:43,093
(A game where the team dinner bill for 26 people is at stake)

2084
01:26:43,693 --> 01:26:46,333
(Having won rock-paper-scissors, CEO Lee goes first.)

2085
01:26:46,833 --> 01:26:49,232
(The first number is...)

2086
01:26:49,233 --> 01:26:50,703
- Zero!
- Eight!

2087
01:26:51,603 --> 01:26:52,603
Eight!

2088
01:26:53,203 --> 01:26:54,203
No.

2089
01:26:54,204 --> 01:26:55,703
(It's a pretty high number.)

2090
01:26:56,373 --> 01:26:58,243
(The second number is...)

2091
01:27:03,383 --> 01:27:04,713
- Zero!
- Okay!

2092
01:27:05,213 --> 01:27:06,483
(Zero!)

2093
01:27:07,613 --> 01:27:08,783
(Okay!)

2094
01:27:10,283 --> 01:27:12,453
(Both of them will win as long as they get a 1.)

2095
01:27:12,853 --> 01:27:15,192
Unbelievable. It's zero!

2096
01:27:15,193 --> 01:27:17,493
(The frontrunner for last place)

2097
01:27:17,623 --> 01:27:18,763
Who is going next?

2098
01:27:24,203 --> 01:27:25,733
As long as you don't get zero, Woo Bin.

2099
01:27:26,033 --> 01:27:28,432
- No zero, and you'll be fine.
- But you never know.

2100
01:27:28,433 --> 01:27:30,142
- My gut tells me I'll get zero.
- Good luck.

2101
01:27:30,143 --> 01:27:31,643
(But he's the 0 Boy.)

2102
01:27:32,273 --> 01:27:34,473
(What's the first number?)

2103
01:27:34,813 --> 01:27:36,043
Five.

2104
01:27:38,413 --> 01:27:41,383
(As long as he doesn't get 0)

2105
01:27:42,113 --> 01:27:44,983
(If he can just break free...)

2106
01:27:45,783 --> 01:27:48,693
(from his zero-getter fate this once....)

2107
01:27:51,393 --> 01:27:53,392
(He finally breaks the 0-Boy curse.)

2108
01:27:53,393 --> 01:27:55,233
(Woo Bin survives.)

2109
01:27:56,563 --> 01:27:57,933
- It's 30.
- Please.

2110
01:27:58,963 --> 01:28:00,202
A zero, please!

2111
01:28:00,203 --> 01:28:01,973
(If Kyung Soo gets a 0, it's a rematch.)

2112
01:28:02,903 --> 01:28:05,773
(Paying his respects to the stopwatch deity)

2113
01:28:06,473 --> 01:28:07,613
Here I go.

2114
01:28:09,273 --> 01:28:10,783
If only I'd had one more try.

2115
01:28:14,883 --> 01:28:16,523
(If he had been 0.01 seconds faster, he would've been doomed.)

2116
01:28:16,653 --> 01:28:17,752
As long as it's not a zero.

2117
01:28:17,753 --> 01:28:19,953
(There's only 1 chance left now.)

2118
01:28:21,923 --> 01:28:24,793
(1 more time, as long as it's not 0)

2119
01:28:26,763 --> 01:28:27,793
Everyone.

2120
01:28:28,793 --> 01:28:30,263
Please count down from three.

2121
01:28:30,303 --> 01:28:33,203
- Three, two, one.
- Three, two, one.

2122
01:28:33,833 --> 01:28:36,703
(Who will the stopwatch deity favour?)

2123
01:28:39,573 --> 01:28:41,013
(He survives!)

2124
01:28:42,713 --> 01:28:47,113
(The director is the luckiest man on this expedition!)

2125
01:28:47,613 --> 01:28:50,923
- Lee Kwang Soo!
- Lee Kwang Soo!

2126
01:28:51,353 --> 01:28:52,822
- Lee Kwang Soo!
- Lee Kwang Soo!

2127
01:28:52,823 --> 01:28:54,192
- Let's go and dig in.
- Thank you.

2128
01:28:54,193 --> 01:28:56,523
(Thank you.)

2129
01:28:57,723 --> 01:28:59,122
Thank you.

2130
01:28:59,123 --> 01:29:02,903
(Kwang Soo eventually accepts his destiny.)

2131
01:29:05,663 --> 01:29:07,633
That's a very long receipt.

2132
01:29:08,573 --> 01:29:09,843
Is this the receipt?

2133
01:29:10,543 --> 01:29:12,973
(Today's team dinner bill finds its way to the owner.)

2134
01:29:14,173 --> 01:29:15,213
Why is it so long?

2135
01:29:16,583 --> 01:29:17,613
How much is it?

2136
01:29:17,713 --> 01:29:19,213

Really?

2167
01:30:34,553 --> 01:30:36,562
Because a large amount of money was used overseas.

Oh, my gosh.

2169
01:30:37,963 --> 01:30:39,962

2170

(If an unused card has been used overseas, freeze it at once.)

2171

Nice.
