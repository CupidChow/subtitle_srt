1
00:00:01,109 --> 00:00:03,976
(After the Second Passing Ceremony is over)

2
00:00:08,797 --> 00:00:10,465
After surviving the Second Passing Ceremony,

3
00:00:10,466 --> 00:00:13,607
you're entitled to be assembled by World Assemblers.

4
00:00:14,406 --> 00:00:16,776
Here are 35 trainees.

5
00:00:17,037 --> 00:00:18,806
The fifth project...

6
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:21,177
is revealed now.

7
00:00:23,246 --> 00:00:24,446
Here we go.

8
00:00:24,447 --> 00:00:26,016
(What's the 5th project of PROJECT 7?)

9
00:00:26,017 --> 00:00:28,047
- Here we go. - What is it?

10
00:00:28,746 --> 00:00:30,116
The project...

11
00:00:32,526 --> 00:00:34,857
is Original Matching.

12
00:00:34,887 --> 00:00:36,555
(Original Matching)

13
00:00:36,556 --> 00:00:38,395
It means we become the originals.

14
00:00:38,396 --> 00:00:39,865
- The originals. - This is the first time.

15
00:00:39,866 --> 00:00:40,866
My dopamine is increasing.

16
00:00:40,867 --> 00:00:42,566
- Everyone is excited. - Right.

17
00:00:42,866 --> 00:00:45,365
Position Matching and Rival Matching...

18
00:00:45,366 --> 00:00:47,106
were cover song missions.

19
00:00:47,107 --> 00:00:49,577
But for Original Matching,

20
00:00:51,007 --> 00:00:53,977
you'll compete performing five new songs.

21
00:00:54,207 --> 00:00:57,577
I thought it was our song this time,

22
00:00:57,646 --> 00:01:00,486
and it would feel like making a debut,

23
00:01:00,487 --> 00:01:02,857
so that made me happy.

24
00:01:02,957 --> 00:01:05,416
It's a song with our voices.

25
00:01:05,417 --> 00:01:08,387
I was so excited.

26
00:01:08,556 --> 00:01:10,356
I couldn't believe it.

27
00:01:10,357 --> 00:01:11,526
I was delighted.

28
00:01:11,827 --> 00:01:13,266
These new songs...

29
00:01:13,267 --> 00:01:16,096
are produced by the best producers at home and abroad...

30
00:01:16,537 --> 00:01:19,805
and created only for trainees...

31
00:01:19,806 --> 00:01:21,007
of PROJECT 7.

32
00:01:21,767 --> 00:01:24,206
Trainees cannot select the songs on their own.

33
00:01:24,207 --> 00:01:27,746
You will compete with the songs...

34
00:01:28,107 --> 00:01:29,947
that World Assemblers assemble you to.

35
00:01:30,816 --> 00:01:33,416
For two weeks, World Assemblers...

36
00:01:33,417 --> 00:01:36,386
assembled trainees and original songs...

37
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:37,556
every day.

38
00:01:38,616 --> 00:01:41,586
Before announcing the songs you're assembled to,

39
00:01:41,656 --> 00:01:46,625
I'll introduce the five original songs.

40
00:01:46,626 --> 00:01:47,697
(5 original songs are introduced.)

41
00:01:48,327 --> 00:01:49,836
Here?

42
00:01:50,537 --> 00:01:52,037
Now?

43
00:01:52,607 --> 00:01:53,766
I'll introduce the five original songs.

44
00:01:53,767 --> 00:01:54,806
(5 original songs are introduced.)

45
00:01:55,266 --> 00:01:56,837
Here?

46
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:59,107
Now?

47
00:01:59,576 --> 00:02:01,245
For the first original song,

48
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,977
Director Ryan Sewon Jhun...

49
00:02:05,576 --> 00:02:10,015
and Dem Jointz, the songwriter of aespa's "Supernova,"

50
00:02:10,487 --> 00:02:14,126
created it together for PROJECT 7.

51
00:02:16,927 --> 00:02:18,756
It has a neo and urban concept...

52
00:02:19,467 --> 00:02:20,696
and the title is "Breaking News."

53
00:02:21,126 --> 00:02:22,466
"Breaking News."

54
00:02:22,467 --> 00:02:23,765
("Breaking News")

55
00:02:23,766 --> 00:02:25,496
- Neo and urban. - I'm interested.

56
00:02:28,037 --> 00:02:29,177
Oh, my goodness.

57
00:02:32,746 --> 00:02:33,976
("Breaking News" has a neo and urban concept.)

58
00:02:33,977 --> 00:02:35,205
(It's a song that expresses the ambition and confidence...)

59
00:02:35,206 --> 00:02:36,876
(of trainees who want to draw attention like breaking news.)

60
00:02:40,217 --> 00:02:41,616
- What's that? - I love it!

61
00:02:45,316 --> 00:02:46,385
That's Director Bada.

62
00:02:46,386 --> 00:02:50,196
(Director Bada created the choreography.)

63
00:02:54,996 --> 00:02:56,097
That's awesome.

64
00:02:56,897 --> 00:02:58,066
The choreography looks great.

65
00:02:58,436 --> 00:02:59,737
That's really nice, as expected.

66
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:02,375
We clapped our hands automatically.

67
00:03:02,376 --> 00:03:05,206
The song was so nice that we let out yells naturally.

68
00:03:05,436 --> 00:03:09,046
It sounded like a current and trendy song,

69
00:03:09,047 --> 00:03:10,847
and I thought I had to perform it, no matter what.

70
00:03:13,787 --> 00:03:15,916
("Breaking News" has a strong impact.)

71
00:03:15,917 --> 00:03:17,115
The choreography looks awesome.

72
00:03:17,116 --> 00:03:18,956
("Breaking News" has a strong impact.)

73
00:03:21,527 --> 00:03:22,527
This is insane.

74
00:03:22,528 --> 00:03:24,356
Seriously, I got goosebumps.

75
00:03:24,357 --> 00:03:25,596
That song's awesome.

76
00:03:25,597 --> 00:03:27,066
It's great, as expected.

77
00:03:28,496 --> 00:03:30,037
I want to perform it so much.

78
00:03:30,496 --> 00:03:32,337
Here's the second original song.

79
00:03:33,037 --> 00:03:35,635
Cho Won Sang of the band LUCY...

80
00:03:35,636 --> 00:03:36,976
(Cho Wong Sang of the band LUCY produced the song.)

81
00:03:36,977 --> 00:03:39,505
wrote the song thinking...

82
00:03:39,506 --> 00:03:41,376
about the trainees of PROJECT 7.

83
00:03:41,706 --> 00:03:45,016
The song describes the emotion of a boy who fell in love.

84
00:03:45,076 --> 00:03:46,717
It has a fresh and cool concept,

85
00:03:47,587 --> 00:03:49,286
and the title is "Merry-Go-Round."

86
00:03:49,287 --> 00:03:50,717
- "Merry-Go-Round." - I love their songs.

87
00:03:52,217 --> 00:03:53,726
("Merry-Go-Round" tells the emotion of a boy who fell in love...)

88
00:03:53,727 --> 00:03:55,897
(in a witty way, and is filled with fresh energy.)

89
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:01,995
That's my part.

90
00:04:01,996 --> 00:04:03,566
You should do this.

91
00:04:07,566 --> 00:04:08,766
I've never heard this part before.

92
00:04:09,006 --> 00:04:10,237
It's fresh like a sports drink.

93
00:04:10,576 --> 00:04:12,506
- That's nice. - It feels so fresh.

94
00:04:15,306 --> 00:04:17,916
It sounded so fresh and lively.

95
00:04:18,116 --> 00:04:22,016
I loved the song itself as it felt like a band song.

96
00:04:22,087 --> 00:04:24,586
It was trendy,

97
00:04:24,587 --> 00:04:27,157
and it had a fresh and cute vibe for a survival show,

98
00:04:27,657 --> 00:04:29,657
like those songs that overwhelm the listeners.

99
00:04:29,927 --> 00:04:31,596
The choreography is insane.

100
00:04:31,597 --> 00:04:34,297
The choreography doesn't have a tough part.

101
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:36,365
We can get a compliment if we do it nicely.

102
00:04:36,366 --> 00:04:37,565
The moves are cute.

103
00:04:37,566 --> 00:04:41,436
("Merry-Go-Round" shows the standard of being fresh and cute.)

104
00:04:45,537 --> 00:04:47,505
- The intro... - It's fresh.

105
00:04:47,506 --> 00:04:49,046
is so crazy.

106
00:04:49,047 --> 00:04:51,016
It's so good, right?

107
00:04:51,147 --> 00:04:53,487
Next, the third original song...

108
00:04:54,147 --> 00:04:57,816
is expected to give...

109
00:04:58,386 --> 00:05:01,087
the most intense performance...

110
00:05:01,587 --> 00:05:03,357
- We should do it. - in the history of PROJECT 7.

111
00:05:04,496 --> 00:05:06,266
It has a sexy and bad concept,

112
00:05:06,927 --> 00:05:08,097
and the title is "Trigger."

113
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:11,265
- I'm so excited about the song. - I'm so curious.

114
00:05:11,266 --> 00:05:12,837
I really want to perform the song produced by Joombas.

115
00:05:13,107 --> 00:05:16,436
The song expresses the inescapable sexuality of a bad guy.

116
00:05:16,936 --> 00:05:18,636
It's a hybrid song...

117
00:05:19,547 --> 00:05:20,847
based on hip-hop.

118
00:05:21,006 --> 00:05:22,246
I like it already.

119
00:05:26,516 --> 00:05:29,287
(The intense choreography attracts their eyes.)

120
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:35,357
I like to perform that too.

121
00:05:36,897 --> 00:05:38,027
This is it.

122
00:05:40,927 --> 00:05:42,935
The concept...

123
00:05:42,936 --> 00:05:45,237
captured my heart.

124
00:05:45,366 --> 00:05:47,765
It looked like "Trigger" could show my competence...

125
00:05:47,766 --> 00:05:49,106
and my charms to the audience...

126
00:05:49,107 --> 00:05:51,506
thanks to the mood of the song itself.

127
00:05:53,806 --> 00:05:58,746
("Trigger" will attract World Assemblers with its strong beat.)

128
00:06:00,647 --> 00:06:01,746
I want to perform "Trigger" so badly.

129
00:06:03,217 --> 00:06:04,386
It's so awesome.

130
00:06:04,717 --> 00:06:06,287
I seriously want to perform it.

131
00:06:07,626 --> 00:06:09,657
- Joker. - It's sexy.

132
00:06:10,297 --> 00:06:11,595
Here's the fourth original song.

133
00:06:11,596 --> 00:06:13,267
it was produced by the composer Song writer Young Chance,

134
00:06:15,527 --> 00:06:20,907
who made "Siren" by RIIZE and "Fact Check" by NCT.

135
00:06:21,206 --> 00:06:23,736
It has an old-school and retro concept,

136
00:06:24,007 --> 00:06:25,436
and the title is "KOOL-AID."

137
00:06:26,076 --> 00:06:28,377
- I like old-school songs. - "KOOL-AID."

138
00:06:28,946 --> 00:06:32,786
The song features a new jack swing rhythm and RnB vocal melodies.

139
00:06:32,787 --> 00:06:36,356
It gives a cool and fresh vibe.

140
00:06:39,657 --> 00:06:40,956
It's totally old-school.

141
00:06:41,887 --> 00:06:44,126
There's nothing to avoid

142
00:06:44,127 --> 00:06:45,966
- It's nice here. - I liked this section.

143
00:06:49,637 --> 00:06:50,836
That's so tough.

144
00:06:51,466 --> 00:06:52,867
The live performance won't be easy.

145
00:06:53,736 --> 00:06:56,537
Watching the "KOOL-AID" dance video,

146
00:06:56,576 --> 00:07:00,147
I thought it wasn't just a fun song.

147
00:07:00,177 --> 00:07:01,806
It had very cool parts.

148
00:07:02,346 --> 00:07:05,986
I think I can perform "KOOL-AID" very nicely.

149
00:07:09,086 --> 00:07:13,657
("KOOL-AID" has a fresh groove.)

150
00:07:15,757 --> 00:07:17,225
I wanted to perform a retro song so much.

151
00:07:17,226 --> 00:07:19,296
It feels like having a glass of Maldives in Hawaii.

152
00:07:19,297 --> 00:07:20,767
I wanted a retro song so much.

153
00:07:20,897 --> 00:07:23,095
Here's the last one, the fifth original song.

154
00:07:23,096 --> 00:07:24,137
The producer of SUNMI...

155
00:07:26,137 --> 00:07:27,906
and ENHYPEN,

156
00:07:27,907 --> 00:07:30,606
FRANTS, wrote the song.

157
00:07:30,936 --> 00:07:33,806
It has a nostalgic and sentimental concept,

158
00:07:34,007 --> 00:07:35,377
and the title is "Time After Time."

159
00:07:36,446 --> 00:07:38,076
It's a synthpop song...

160
00:07:38,346 --> 00:07:41,586
that stands out with both reminiscent and fresh feelings.

161
00:07:41,716 --> 00:07:43,257
The song is really nice.

162
00:07:50,027 --> 00:07:51,027
They're all female dancers.

163
00:07:51,826 --> 00:07:53,726
That song is good.

164
00:07:54,427 --> 00:07:56,167
That's what I'm saying.

165
00:07:56,696 --> 00:07:57,897
Director Bada, as expected.

166
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:03,336
I'm tearing up. I love the song.

167
00:08:03,677 --> 00:08:04,976
I just got goosebumps.

168
00:08:06,076 --> 00:08:07,407
I just felt like crying.

169
00:08:07,677 --> 00:08:10,715
I don't know why I cried,

170
00:08:10,716 --> 00:08:12,216
but the song just felt so beautiful.

171
00:08:14,216 --> 00:08:16,316
That's nice!

172
00:08:20,356 --> 00:08:22,526
That's wonderful.

173
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,797
This is insane.

174
00:08:23,826 --> 00:08:25,956
I like songs with a refreshing vibe.

175
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:28,997
Considering the choreography and all,

176
00:08:29,297 --> 00:08:32,466
I wanted to perform "Time After Time" the most.

177
00:08:32,936 --> 00:08:35,105
- That's amazing. - The song feels so good.

178
00:08:35,106 --> 00:08:36,376
I feel like falling for it.

179
00:08:36,376 --> 00:08:37,936
This is wonderful.

180
00:08:38,037 --> 00:08:39,135
I want this song.

181
00:08:39,136 --> 00:08:41,306
("Time After Time" moves their hearts.)

182
00:08:42,206 --> 00:08:44,945
I want this song.

183
00:08:44,946 --> 00:08:46,345
I don't know what the lyrics mean,

184
00:08:46,346 --> 00:08:47,685
but I just want to cry.

185
00:08:47,686 --> 00:08:48,816
I'm crying.

186
00:08:49,287 --> 00:08:50,617
I'll be happy wherever I'm assembled.

187
00:08:50,716 --> 00:08:52,355
"Merry-Go-Round" looks tough.

188
00:08:52,356 --> 00:08:53,826
I want to perform "Merry-Go-round."

189
00:08:53,887 --> 00:08:55,786
My first choice is "Trigger" or "Breaking News,"

190
00:08:55,787 --> 00:08:56,855
but I have a feeling that I'm going to "Merry-Go-Round."

191
00:08:56,856 --> 00:09:00,526
I suddenly get ambitious for every song.

192
00:09:00,527 --> 00:09:03,167
I have a feeling that BINGHUA will be assembled to "Time After Time."

193
00:09:03,637 --> 00:09:07,906
I fit for the concept of "Merry-Go-Round."

194
00:09:07,907 --> 00:09:08,966
Which one do you want?

195
00:09:09,476 --> 00:09:11,506
I want the first one, "Breaking News."

196
00:09:11,507 --> 00:09:13,606
- That's great. - It's great,

197
00:09:13,877 --> 00:09:15,277
but the choreography looked so tough.

198
00:09:16,316 --> 00:09:19,647
World Assemblers...

199
00:09:20,117 --> 00:09:22,486
assembled Original Matching.

200
00:09:22,586 --> 00:09:25,685
Which trainees are assembled to which songs?

201
00:09:25,686 --> 00:09:28,486
I'll now announce the results.

202
00:09:28,556 --> 00:09:30,595
What? Now?

203
00:09:30,596 --> 00:09:32,866
- What? - I'll do my best.

204
00:09:32,867 --> 00:09:34,166
It's announced now.

205
00:09:34,167 --> 00:09:35,167
Please.

206
00:09:43,936 --> 00:09:46,037
The trainees I call now...

207
00:09:46,677 --> 00:09:48,907
will come out and move...

208
00:09:49,407 --> 00:09:50,746
to the rooms they're assembled into.

209
00:09:50,747 --> 00:09:52,147
(Trainees move to the rooms they're assembled into.)

210
00:09:55,517 --> 00:09:58,517
(The song will be revealed after all the team members gather.)

211
00:09:59,726 --> 00:10:01,426
- Really? - We're going to move.

212
00:10:01,427 --> 00:10:02,556
Okay.

213
00:10:03,527 --> 00:10:05,757
Manage your look, whoever comes in.

214
00:10:05,797 --> 00:10:07,027
- See you. - See you.

215
00:10:07,397 --> 00:10:09,096
I'll call the names now. First place,

216
00:10:09,367 --> 00:10:10,767
Trainee JEON MINWOOK.

217
00:10:11,596 --> 00:10:12,736
What's going on?

218
00:10:13,367 --> 00:10:16,065
Please come forward and move to the room you're assigned to.

219
00:10:16,066 --> 00:10:17,537
Right now?

220
00:10:17,836 --> 00:10:19,236
Oh, my goodness.

221
00:10:19,436 --> 00:10:20,806
Please wait for me.

222
00:10:21,007 --> 00:10:23,516
He already looks refreshing from behind.

223
00:10:23,517 --> 00:10:24,816
You already look refreshing.

224
00:10:25,316 --> 00:10:27,787
Second place, Trainee SAKURADA KENSHIN.

225
00:10:27,986 --> 00:10:30,157
Please come forward and move to the room.

226
00:10:30,617 --> 00:10:32,185
- Bye. - You can do it.

227
00:10:32,186 --> 00:10:34,086
- Bye. - KENSHIN.

228
00:10:34,456 --> 00:10:36,496
(Two trainees move to the rooms.)

229
00:10:36,497 --> 00:10:38,427
- Here. - KENSHIN. That's amazing.

230
00:10:38,897 --> 00:10:40,027
- I'm going here. - Yes.

231
00:10:41,367 --> 00:10:42,367
Bye.

232
00:10:42,368 --> 00:10:43,436
(They enter different rooms.)

233
00:10:44,236 --> 00:10:46,406
(Trainee JEON MINWOOK enters Room 2.)

234
00:10:46,407 --> 00:10:47,407
Hello.

235
00:10:50,206 --> 00:10:51,277
Hello.

236
00:10:53,047 --> 00:10:54,247
I think the one...

237
00:10:55,476 --> 00:10:58,917
who goes well with me is MAJINGXIANG.

238
00:10:59,216 --> 00:11:02,485
I think he will fit for a sexy song.

239
00:11:02,486 --> 00:11:03,956
So I want MAJINGXIANG...

240
00:11:04,356 --> 00:11:05,417
and YEOJUN.

241
00:11:06,657 --> 00:11:08,226
MAJINGXIANG and YEOJUN.

242
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:11,657
It will be nice if we perform "Trigger" together.

243
00:11:12,157 --> 00:11:13,596
Do you think this is "Trigger?"

244
00:11:15,326 --> 00:11:16,735
(Trainee SAKURADA KENSHIN enters Room 1.)

245
00:11:16,736 --> 00:11:18,166
Which song do you want to perform?

246
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:19,267
I want...

247
00:11:20,106 --> 00:11:21,736
to perform "Merry-Go-Round."

248
00:11:22,466 --> 00:11:25,007
It's because my vibe...

249
00:11:26,306 --> 00:11:28,647
fits for "Merry-Go-Round" so much.

250
00:11:29,547 --> 00:11:31,946
It's so "Merry-Go-Round."

251
00:11:33,186 --> 00:11:35,815
So, I want to perform "Merry-Go-Round."

252
00:11:35,816 --> 00:11:37,316
(Is it "Merry-Go-Round" as he wishes?)

253
00:11:38,157 --> 00:11:40,286
Trainee SEO KYOUNGBAE, please come forward...

254
00:11:40,287 --> 00:11:42,226
and move to the room you're assigned to.

255
00:11:42,657 --> 00:11:44,796
There are confirmed cases.

256
00:11:44,797 --> 00:11:46,825
Right. MINWOOK is for "Trigger,"

257
00:11:46,826 --> 00:11:48,695
and KENSHIN is for "Merry-Go-Round."

258
00:11:48,696 --> 00:11:51,096
- Where did KYOUNGBAE go? - I guess he went to "Trigger."

259
00:11:51,196 --> 00:11:52,936
Do you know what really scary is?

260
00:11:53,367 --> 00:11:54,606
You went to a room,

261
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,637
and find yourself with MINWOOK, KENSHIN, and KYOUNGBAE.

262
00:11:57,706 --> 00:12:00,007
- Gosh. - That will be so scary.

263
00:12:01,206 --> 00:12:03,917
(Where does Trainee SEO KYOUNGBAE head to?)

264
00:12:05,177 --> 00:12:07,316
(Is it Room 2, where Trainee JEON MINWOOK is?)

265
00:12:07,887 --> 00:12:10,157
(Is it Room 1, where Trainee SAKURADA KENSHIN is?)

266
00:12:10,887 --> 00:12:13,127
(Or is it another room?)

267
00:12:16,356 --> 00:12:17,596
KYOUNGBAE!

268
00:12:18,527 --> 00:12:21,026
- Really? - I knew it.

269
00:12:21,027 --> 00:12:22,796
- I knew it. - Is it you, KYOUNGBAE?

270
00:12:22,797 --> 00:12:24,735
(SAKURADA KENSHIN and SEO KYOUNGBAE are assembled together.)

271
00:12:24,736 --> 00:12:26,507
Okay. We won already.

272
00:12:26,836 --> 00:12:28,137
- KYOUNGBAE. - We already won.

273
00:12:28,566 --> 00:12:31,336
(Which trainee came to Trainee JEON MINWOOK?)

274
00:12:31,476 --> 00:12:32,476
What?

275
00:12:33,047 --> 00:12:34,177
Is there no one here?

276
00:12:34,777 --> 00:12:36,417
(Here I am.)

277
00:12:36,647 --> 00:12:37,647
There is one.

278
00:12:37,648 --> 00:12:39,046
(He lowered his guard, and then he got startled.)

279
00:12:39,047 --> 00:12:40,047
MINWOOK.

280
00:12:40,387 --> 00:12:42,147
I thought you'd come.

281
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:44,616
I wanted to be on the same team as you.

282
00:12:44,617 --> 00:12:46,387
(JEON MINWOOK and JANG YEOJUN are assembled together.)

283
00:12:47,326 --> 00:12:49,225
(Next, Trainee MAJINGXIANG joins them too!)

284
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,257
Hello.

285
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:54,667
I wanted to be with MINWOOK for "Trigger."

286
00:12:55,527 --> 00:12:59,096
The two people I expected to come are here.

287
00:12:59,706 --> 00:13:01,037
- Both of you are here. - MINWOOK.

288
00:13:02,836 --> 00:13:05,637
(Two of them are hiding behind the wall.)

289
00:13:06,277 --> 00:13:09,306
I will shout first,

290
00:13:09,946 --> 00:13:12,546
and then KYOUNGBAE will shout.

291
00:13:12,547 --> 00:13:13,946
Okay.

292
00:13:15,617 --> 00:13:16,756
All right.

293
00:13:16,757 --> 00:13:19,257
(Who will be the victim of KENSHIN and KYOUNGBAE?)

294
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,596
(Trainee SAKURADA KENSHIN goes out.)

295
00:13:26,326 --> 00:13:29,966
(Trainee SONG SEUNGHO enters.)

296
00:13:33,267 --> 00:13:35,436
(Handshaking naturally)

297
00:13:36,236 --> 00:13:39,007
(Trainee SONG SEUNGHO isn't surprised at all.)

298
00:13:40,446 --> 00:13:42,147
Gosh, you surprised me.

299
00:13:42,576 --> 00:13:44,277
This is working.

300
00:13:45,076 --> 00:13:46,147
This is working.

301
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:49,986
(Trainee KIM SUNGMIN enters Room 1.)

302
00:13:50,157 --> 00:13:52,417
What is it?

303
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:54,757
- Four people in the top tier? - Wait a minute.

304
00:13:55,527 --> 00:13:57,296
- Four people in the top tier? - Really?

305
00:13:57,297 --> 00:13:58,726
Don't you think the result is fixed?

306
00:13:59,257 --> 00:14:01,866
It feels like waiting for classmates coming to school...

307
00:14:01,867 --> 00:14:03,267
for a new semester.

308
00:14:03,566 --> 00:14:05,596
(Top 7 trainees gathered in Room 1 and Room 2.)

309
00:14:06,297 --> 00:14:08,536
Seven of them left.

310
00:14:08,537 --> 00:14:09,537
(Other trainees don't know the fact.)

311
00:14:10,206 --> 00:14:12,507
But all seven of them could be on the same team.

312
00:14:12,537 --> 00:14:15,206
Can you imagine...

313
00:14:15,907 --> 00:14:17,476
MINWOOK and KENSHIN performing together?

314
00:14:23,986 --> 00:14:25,056
What?

315
00:14:25,456 --> 00:14:26,556
There's no one.

316
00:14:28,787 --> 00:14:31,426
(Trainee KANG MINSEO enters Room 5.)

317
00:14:31,427 --> 00:14:32,556
Am I the first one to enter?

318
00:14:33,726 --> 00:14:34,897
Is there no one?

319
00:14:35,726 --> 00:14:36,766
Really?

320
00:14:36,767 --> 00:14:38,565
(The 1st one to enter Room 3...)

321
00:14:38,566 --> 00:14:41,907
(is Trainee KIM JEONGMIN.)

322
00:14:43,177 --> 00:14:44,407
Is there really no one here?

323
00:14:45,736 --> 00:14:46,746
Gosh.

324
00:14:51,577 --> 00:14:53,616
(The 1st one to enter Room 4)

325
00:14:53,617 --> 00:14:54,786
Am I the first one here?

326
00:14:55,087 --> 00:14:56,756
(Trainee BINGHUA)

327
00:14:57,557 --> 00:15:01,956
(Room 1, Room 2, Room 3, Room 4, Room 5)

328
00:15:02,127 --> 00:15:04,995
Twenty-first place, Trainee JUNG SEYUN.

329
00:15:04,996 --> 00:15:07,265
Trainee WOO HAJOON, Trainee LYNNLYNN.

330
00:15:07,266 --> 00:15:08,295
(Seats are getting emptier.)

331
00:15:08,296 --> 00:15:10,067
Please move to the room you're assigned to.

332
00:15:10,137 --> 00:15:11,137
Yes.

333
00:15:15,036 --> 00:15:16,676
(Trainee KWON YONGHYUN enters Room 5.)

334
00:15:16,677 --> 00:15:18,936
Why is the curtain swaying?

335
00:15:19,236 --> 00:15:21,306
(Swaying)

336
00:15:21,307 --> 00:15:23,577
Gosh, why is the curtain swaying?

337
00:15:24,476 --> 00:15:25,516
Hello.

338
00:15:26,417 --> 00:15:27,715
MINSEO.

339
00:15:27,716 --> 00:15:29,186
- Gosh, YONGHYUN. - Are you alone here?

340
00:15:29,286 --> 00:15:30,616
You should have entered a bit later.

341
00:15:30,617 --> 00:15:31,755
- Are you alone here? - Yes, I am.

342
00:15:31,756 --> 00:15:32,887
- Really? - Yes.

343
00:15:33,157 --> 00:15:34,926
- Welcome. It's KOTARO! - Hello.

344
00:15:34,927 --> 00:15:36,285
KOTARO.

345
00:15:36,286 --> 00:15:37,856
(Trainee ASAKA KOTARO enters.)

346
00:15:37,857 --> 00:15:38,926
We're on the same team.

347
00:15:38,927 --> 00:15:40,896
The moment KOTARO entered, I got it.

348
00:15:40,897 --> 00:15:42,166
- What? - It's a refreshing song.

349
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:43,637
I know. It's a refreshing song, as I see.

350
00:15:45,536 --> 00:15:48,066
- I guess so. - I think it's "KOOL-AID."

351
00:15:48,067 --> 00:15:49,137
I see.

352
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:51,407
Someone is coming.

353
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,347
(Trainee KIM JEONGMIN was alone in Room 3.)

354
00:15:56,976 --> 00:15:58,076
Hello.

355
00:15:58,077 --> 00:15:59,647
(Trainee FONG ATILLA enters.)

356
00:16:04,317 --> 00:16:05,516
Is this...

357
00:16:08,387 --> 00:16:09,726
Why isn't there anyone here?

358
00:16:11,456 --> 00:16:12,756
(There is someone here.)

359
00:16:16,966 --> 00:16:17,996
What?

360
00:16:19,907 --> 00:16:22,807
(Trainee LEE GUNWOO enters.)

361
00:16:25,407 --> 00:16:28,307
(Trainee KIM JOOHYUN follows.)

362
00:16:28,607 --> 00:16:30,076
- What? - It's "Merry-Go-Round."

363
00:16:30,077 --> 00:16:31,846
- It's "Merry-Go-Round." - Do you think?

364
00:16:31,847 --> 00:16:34,147
- Hey, this is "Merry-Go-Round." - "Merry-Go-Round."

365
00:16:34,516 --> 00:16:36,617
KENSHIN and I will hide.

366
00:16:37,216 --> 00:16:38,587
- Tell them you're "Trigger." - Okay.

367
00:16:39,117 --> 00:16:41,626
- Tell them you're "Trigger." - Let's look cool.

368
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:42,627
(They plan to confuse the others by pretending to be "Trigger.")

369
00:16:42,628 --> 00:16:43,857
Look cool.

370
00:16:44,496 --> 00:16:45,657
Like this.

371
00:16:46,057 --> 00:16:47,126
Hello.

372
00:16:47,127 --> 00:16:48,666
(Room 1)

373
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:50,836
(Trainee JUNG SEYUN enters.)

374
00:16:50,837 --> 00:16:51,966
What?

375
00:16:52,897 --> 00:16:54,735
- What is this? - What is this?

376
00:16:54,736 --> 00:16:56,107
- "Trigger." - "Trigger."

377
00:16:57,476 --> 00:16:59,535
(Trainee NAM JIWOON enters.)

378
00:16:59,536 --> 00:17:00,647
What?

379
00:17:01,847 --> 00:17:02,976
Hello.

380
00:17:05,046 --> 00:17:06,146
JIWOON?

381
00:17:07,445 --> 00:17:08,587
NAM JIWOON?

382
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:10,817
- JIWOON? - What?

383
00:17:11,587 --> 00:17:12,786
JIWOON. I like this.

384
00:17:13,087 --> 00:17:15,185
- Nice. - This is "Merry-Go-Round," right?

385
00:17:15,857 --> 00:17:17,156
(Meanwhile, in Room 2)

386
00:17:17,156 --> 00:17:18,327
You can leave it at the door.

387
00:17:19,857 --> 00:17:21,396
- LYNNLYNN. - Hello.

388
00:17:21,426 --> 00:17:22,426
LYNNLYNN.

389
00:17:22,428 --> 00:17:26,704
(Room 2)

390
00:17:26,705 --> 00:17:28,566
- What? - JUNSEO.

391
00:17:28,567 --> 00:17:29,606
I guessed correctly.

392
00:17:29,607 --> 00:17:30,907
- Hello. - Come here.

393
00:17:31,276 --> 00:17:32,637
YICHEN.

394
00:17:33,107 --> 00:17:34,877
- YICHEN. - I knew YICHEN would come.

395
00:17:36,006 --> 00:17:37,316
How many do we have?

396
00:17:37,317 --> 00:17:38,846
(Room 2 already has 6 members.)

397
00:17:38,847 --> 00:17:40,847
There's someone from my team.

398
00:17:42,016 --> 00:17:43,617
We're slowly going toward "Trigger."

399
00:17:44,216 --> 00:17:46,216
- It's "Trigger." - The probability is getting higher.

400
00:17:46,726 --> 00:17:50,627
(The 6 trainees have a strong feeling.)

401
00:17:51,756 --> 00:17:54,126
(Meanwhile, in Room 4)

402
00:17:54,127 --> 00:17:56,066
(Room 4)

403
00:17:56,067 --> 00:17:58,736
(Trainee OH TAEHWAN enters.)

404
00:17:59,196 --> 00:18:00,336
You scared me.

405
00:18:00,337 --> 00:18:01,505
(A gentle surprise)

406
00:18:01,506 --> 00:18:02,907
- I saw you. - Really?

407
00:18:05,536 --> 00:18:06,945
Oh, my gosh.

408
00:18:06,946 --> 00:18:08,176
(Trainee YOO YOUNGSEO enters.)

409
00:18:08,177 --> 00:18:10,216
- What? - Really?

410
00:18:10,476 --> 00:18:11,617
- What? - I knew it.

411
00:18:11,776 --> 00:18:13,587
- What are we? - I like this.

412
00:18:13,746 --> 00:18:14,886
I love it.

413
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:16,015
(A quiet welcome)

414
00:18:16,016 --> 00:18:17,016
Hey.

415
00:18:17,057 --> 00:18:18,785
But I still can't tell which song we have.

416
00:18:18,786 --> 00:18:20,826
It's okay. I'm happy.

417
00:18:20,827 --> 00:18:22,057
I have a guess.

418
00:18:22,327 --> 00:18:24,796
I think it'll be "Time After Time."

419
00:18:25,097 --> 00:18:28,067
If so, I'd be so happy.

420
00:18:30,097 --> 00:18:31,337
It's HAJOON.

421
00:18:31,597 --> 00:18:32,637
He's here.

422
00:18:33,867 --> 00:18:35,606
Hello. Why are you alone?

423
00:18:35,607 --> 00:18:38,376
(Several trainees with gentle atmospheres enter.)

424
00:18:38,377 --> 00:18:39,536
It's CHENYU.

425
00:18:39,607 --> 00:18:40,946
- Oh, my gosh. - This is insane.

426
00:18:41,206 --> 00:18:42,407
- What is this? - This is insane.

427
00:18:42,506 --> 00:18:43,616
- We... - Oh, my gosh.

428
00:18:43,617 --> 00:18:44,677
What is this?

429
00:18:44,946 --> 00:18:46,245
- What is this? - CHENYU.

430
00:18:46,246 --> 00:18:47,886
Other teams don't have vocalists.

431
00:18:47,887 --> 00:18:49,716
- What happened, CHENYU? - We're all vocalists.

432
00:18:50,157 --> 00:18:51,286
What will the other teams do?

433
00:18:51,817 --> 00:18:52,886
Welcome.

434
00:18:52,887 --> 00:18:54,455
- JUNWON. - JUNWON?

435
00:18:54,456 --> 00:18:55,525
- What is this? - JUNWON?

436
00:18:55,526 --> 00:18:56,526
(Trainee AHN JUNWON enters Room 5.)

437
00:18:56,527 --> 00:18:57,656
- I'm more confused now. - Who knew I'd be...

438
00:18:57,657 --> 00:18:58,827
on the same team as JUNWON?

439
00:18:58,857 --> 00:19:00,265
- JUNWON. - Welcome.

440
00:19:00,266 --> 00:19:01,766
- What's going on? - Hello.

441
00:19:01,927 --> 00:19:03,666
- What team is this? - What team is this?

442
00:19:03,667 --> 00:19:04,837
What team is this?

443
00:19:05,036 --> 00:19:06,966
I don't think it's "Merry-Go-Round."

444
00:19:07,206 --> 00:19:08,666
I think KENSHIN would've gone to "Merry-Go"Round."

445
00:19:08,667 --> 00:19:10,137
- Right. - KENSHIN, ANDY.

446
00:19:10,506 --> 00:19:11,876
- Hello. - I'm here.

447
00:19:11,877 --> 00:19:13,406
Why are you here?

448
00:19:13,407 --> 00:19:14,407
(Room 5, Trainee ABE YURA enters.)

449
00:19:14,408 --> 00:19:16,677
- Hold on. - What? Wait. Why are you here?

450
00:19:17,476 --> 00:19:18,476
YURA.

451
00:19:18,477 --> 00:19:20,016
(Room 5 gets more confused as more members enter.)

452
00:19:20,887 --> 00:19:22,586
(Room 5, Trainee YU JIAHN enters.)

453
00:19:22,587 --> 00:19:24,157
What? Are we all "Boom Boom Bass" members?

454
00:19:24,716 --> 00:19:25,917
- JIAHN. - What?

455
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,357
- What is this? - "Boom Boom Bass."

456
00:19:28,486 --> 00:19:29,985
Why are there so many members from "Boom Boom Bass?"

457
00:19:29,986 --> 00:19:31,056
What is this?

458
00:19:31,057 --> 00:19:32,597
(Confused)

459
00:19:32,956 --> 00:19:34,495
This is a strong team.

460
00:19:34,496 --> 00:19:35,996
A main vocalist, a main dancer...

461
00:19:36,597 --> 00:19:37,995
- We have everything. - Right.

462
00:19:37,996 --> 00:19:39,167
We have a rapper too.

463
00:19:39,466 --> 00:19:41,006
One thing for sure is that we're not "KOOL-AID."

464
00:19:41,466 --> 00:19:42,466
- Seriously. - Okay.

465
00:19:42,467 --> 00:19:44,275
I seriously think we're not "KOOL-AID."

466
00:19:44,276 --> 00:19:45,607
The camera turned to the door.

467
00:19:46,206 --> 00:19:48,077
Get ready.

468
00:19:48,506 --> 00:19:49,506
Oh, my.

469
00:19:49,507 --> 00:19:51,116
(Which trainee is here now?)

470
00:19:51,117 --> 00:19:55,215
(Room 3)

471
00:19:55,216 --> 00:19:56,216
(Trainee KIM JOONWOO enters.)

472
00:19:56,217 --> 00:19:58,117
Hold on. Oh, you scared me.

473
00:19:58,516 --> 00:19:59,657
What is this?

474
00:20:00,286 --> 00:20:01,356
Hey, it's "Time After Time."

475
00:20:01,357 --> 00:20:03,357
Hold on. This is a weird group.

476
00:20:03,456 --> 00:20:04,657
It's getting weirder and weirder.

477
00:20:04,827 --> 00:20:06,225
- Hey. - What is this?

478
00:20:06,226 --> 00:20:08,525
- Wait. Something has gone wrong. - What is this?

479
00:20:08,526 --> 00:20:09,896
This is a weird group.

480
00:20:09,897 --> 00:20:11,066
- Hold on. - What is this? Hold on.

481
00:20:11,067 --> 00:20:12,465
- It's getting weirder and weirder. - I'm getting confused.

482
00:20:12,466 --> 00:20:13,705
No, this is...

483
00:20:13,706 --> 00:20:15,466
No, this could be pretty good.

484
00:20:15,637 --> 00:20:17,035
- It's probably "Breaking News." - What is this?

485
00:20:17,036 --> 00:20:18,607
- We don't know yet, right? - Right? I think it will be.

486
00:20:18,907 --> 00:20:20,647
What I'm a bit nervous about...

487
00:20:21,006 --> 00:20:23,106
- is our rankings. - Our rankings...

488
00:20:23,107 --> 00:20:25,015
- We don't have high-ranking people. - You're right.

489
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:26,577
- Oh, that's why? - You're right.

490
00:20:27,147 --> 00:20:28,715
Who has the highest ranking?

491
00:20:28,716 --> 00:20:30,086
- The highest? - The 22nd place.

492
00:20:30,087 --> 00:20:31,317
- ATILLA. - He got 22nd place.

493
00:20:31,617 --> 00:20:33,456
- He's 25th place. - We have 22nd, 25th,

494
00:20:33,657 --> 00:20:35,056
- Oh, gosh. - And 29th, 30th...

495
00:20:35,057 --> 00:20:36,186
I'm the lowest.

496
00:20:37,157 --> 00:20:38,897
We need SIHUN to come.

497
00:20:39,627 --> 00:20:42,265
Will a savior appear?

498
00:20:42,266 --> 00:20:43,296
(Will the remaining 1 member be our savior?)

499
00:20:43,466 --> 00:20:45,567
(Worried)

500
00:20:46,567 --> 00:20:47,935
Five people? We don't have many spots left.

501
00:20:47,936 --> 00:20:49,036
Could it be CHENYU?

502
00:20:49,837 --> 00:20:50,976
I'm not sure.

503
00:20:51,506 --> 00:20:52,576
Did KANG HYUNWOO go?

504
00:20:52,577 --> 00:20:53,776
Not yet.

505
00:20:54,476 --> 00:20:55,647
Not yet.

506
00:20:55,677 --> 00:20:57,417
If HYUNWOO comes...

507
00:20:57,847 --> 00:20:59,216
Trainee KANG HYUNWOO.

508
00:20:59,476 --> 00:21:00,846
Trainee KIM SIHUN.

509
00:21:00,847 --> 00:21:02,617
- Please go to your rooms. - I'm finally going.

510
00:21:04,786 --> 00:21:07,985
(Which teams will these two be assembled into?)

511
00:21:07,986 --> 00:21:11,097
Where will I end up?

512
00:21:11,127 --> 00:21:12,127
Who is that?

513
00:21:12,128 --> 00:21:13,867
- It's the last person. - Who is that?

514
00:21:14,567 --> 00:21:15,567
- Someone's here. - Wait.

515
00:21:15,696 --> 00:21:17,066
- Someone's here. - You were right.

516
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,266
- Let's go. - Hurry.

517
00:21:25,407 --> 00:21:26,636

(Room 5)

519
00:21:29,807 --> 00:21:31,077
- Who is it? - Who is it?

520
00:21:33,446 --> 00:21:34,647
It's HYUNWOO.

521
00:21:35,887 --> 00:21:37,216
I'm so happy.

522
00:21:37,387 --> 00:21:38,857
- He really came. - HYUNWOO.

523
00:21:38,917 --> 00:21:40,685
What is this?

524
00:21:40,686 --> 00:21:41,686
What is this?

525
00:21:41,687 --> 00:21:43,495
In terms of the group...

526
00:21:43,496 --> 00:21:44,526
Which song do we have?

531
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:53,506
Close it.

532
00:21:53,637 --> 00:21:54,765
Wait.

533
00:21:54,766 --> 00:21:55,965
- What is this? - You came.

534
00:21:55,966 --> 00:21:57,676
- The member we wanted. - A one-digit ranking.

535
00:21:57,677 --> 00:21:59,337

00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:08,817
- Right. - Right.

541
00:22:08,887 --> 00:22:10,357
- But you... - Except for me.

542
00:22:10,786 --> 00:22:12,455
We need a vocalist.

543
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:14,656
- We really need a vocalist. - Right.

544
00:22:14,657 --> 00:22:15,657
(Room 2 needs a vocalist.)

545
00:22:15,658 --> 00:22:18,996
MAJINGXIANG might have to be our main vocalist.

546
00:22:19,157 --> 00:22:20,596
- Yes. - Nice.

547
00:22:20,597 --> 00:22:22,066
What do you think?

548
00:22:22,067 --> 00:22:23,195
I like it.

549
00:22:23,196 --> 00:22:24,337
As long as a main vocalist comes.

550
00:22:25,337 --> 00:22:26,495
(Room 1 also doesn't have a main vocalist.)

551
00:22:26,496 --> 00:22:27,806
So one person?

552
00:22:27,807 --> 00:22:29,036
We need a main vocalist.

553
00:22:29,607 --> 00:22:32,076
We have nothing to worry about when it comes to vocals.

554
00:22:32,077 --> 00:22:33,576
- We'll be fine. - He's great.

555
00:22:33,577 --> 00:22:35,775
If we get another vocalist,

556
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,417
how will that work?

557
00:22:37,917 --> 00:22:39,646
We don't need another vocalist. We have too many.

558
00:22:39,647 --> 00:22:41,045
- We really do have too many. - We're full.

559
00:22:41,046 --> 00:22:43,146
- We really do have too many. - We can give the others some.

560
00:22:43,147 --> 00:22:45,156
I want a strong dancer to come.

561
00:22:45,157 --> 00:22:46,927
Yes, a strong dancer who raps.

562
00:22:47,127 --> 00:22:49,226
That would be KIM HYUNWOO.

563
00:22:50,127 --> 00:22:51,495
- ANDY. - There's also ANDY.

564
00:22:51,496 --> 00:22:53,597
- ANDY would be nice too. - Right.

565
00:22:54,496 --> 00:22:55,567
Oh, gosh.

566
00:22:56,367 --> 00:22:58,397
Here I go. I think I'll go next.

567
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:00,535
It feels like...

568
00:23:00,536 --> 00:23:01,736
(Trainee SHIN JAEWON, a main vocalist)

569
00:23:01,837 --> 00:23:02,866
Bye.

570
00:23:02,867 --> 00:23:04,607
(Trainee ANDY, an all-rounder)

571
00:23:05,307 --> 00:23:06,837
Here?

572
00:23:07,577 --> 00:23:08,847
This way?

573
00:23:08,946 --> 00:23:10,076
(Knock, knock)

574
00:23:10,077 --> 00:23:11,146
Someone's here.

575
00:23:11,147 --> 00:23:12,417
(Room 2)

576
00:23:13,347 --> 00:23:17,117
(Which trainee will become the last member of each room?)

577
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:20,926
(Trainee ANDY, the all-rounder, was assembled into Room 1.)

578
00:23:20,927 --> 00:23:23,157
- What? - We have seven people.

579
00:23:23,256 --> 00:23:25,226
- We have seven people. - We already have seven people.

580
00:23:25,397 --> 00:23:27,396
- Our room is full. - You came to the wrong room.

581
00:23:27,397 --> 00:23:28,526
What?

582
00:23:29,526 --> 00:23:30,866
- You came to the wrong room. - You came to the wrong room.

583
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:32,137
ANDY!

584
00:23:35,536 --> 00:23:36,637
ANDY!

585
00:23:37,137 --> 00:23:38,935
- ANDY. - Come here.

586
00:23:38,936 --> 00:23:39,936
(The assembly of Room 1 is complete.)

587
00:23:39,937 --> 00:23:40,946
(Room 4)

588
00:23:41,077 --> 00:23:42,607
- Someone's here. - Please.

589
00:23:43,107 --> 00:23:44,245
Who is it?

590
00:23:44,246 --> 00:23:45,545
Oh, my. What is this?

591
00:23:45,546 --> 00:23:46,816
What is this?

592
00:23:46,817 --> 00:23:48,215
Hey!

593
00:23:48,216 --> 00:23:49,587
What is this?

594
00:23:50,046 --> 00:23:53,955
(Trainee SHIN JAEWON, main vocalist, was assembled into Room 4.)

595
00:23:53,956 --> 00:23:55,126
(The meeting of the main vocalists)

596
00:23:55,127 --> 00:23:56,456
- What is this? - What?

597
00:23:56,657 --> 00:23:57,856
Hey.

598
00:23:57,857 --> 00:23:59,396
- What is this? - Oh, nice.

599
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:00,897
Wait. We're all vocalists.

600
00:24:01,167 --> 00:24:02,295
We don't have someone to dance.

601
00:24:02,296 --> 00:24:04,097
I'm more worried about the other teams' vocals.

602
00:24:04,266 --> 00:24:06,096
- Right? - So we won't dance.

603
00:24:06,097 --> 00:24:10,577
(Room 2)

604
00:24:10,776 --> 00:24:12,876
KIM HYUNWOO.

605
00:24:12,877 --> 00:24:14,077
(Going back out)

606
00:24:14,147 --> 00:24:15,176
He was disappointed. He went back out.

607
00:24:15,177 --> 00:24:16,647
- He went back out. - He went back out.

608
00:24:17,246 --> 00:24:18,417
Hold on.

609
00:24:20,847 --> 00:24:22,445
Hey, come in.

610
00:24:22,446 --> 00:24:24,255
- Hold on. Earlier, HYUNWOO said... - Seriously.

611
00:24:24,256 --> 00:24:26,586
he wouldn't do this one.

612
00:24:26,587 --> 00:24:27,725
Come on.

613
00:24:27,726 --> 00:24:29,286
- We're in big trouble. - We're in big trouble.

614
00:24:29,387 --> 00:24:30,525
You're here?

615
00:24:30,526 --> 00:24:31,556
Hey, we...

616
00:24:31,557 --> 00:24:32,626
We don't have a main vocalist.

617
00:24:32,627 --> 00:24:34,427
- We don't have a main vocalist. - We...

618
00:24:34,526 --> 00:24:36,266
have five rappers here.

619
00:24:36,427 --> 00:24:37,965
(Original Matching Results, Group 2, KIM SUNGMIN, NAM JIWOON)

620
00:24:37,966 --> 00:24:39,465
(SAKURADA KENSHIN, SEO KYOUNGBAE, SONG SEUNGHO, ANDY, JUNG SEYUN)

621
00:24:39,466 --> 00:24:41,005
(Original Matching Results, Group 4, SHIN JAEWON, BINGHUA, OH TAEHWAN)

622
00:24:41,006 --> 00:24:42,636
(WU CHENYU, WOO HAJOON, YOO YOUNGSEO, LEE HANBIN)

623
00:24:42,637 --> 00:24:44,076
(Original Matching Results, Group 1, KIM HYUNWOO, LYNNLYNN, MAJINGXIANG)

624
00:24:44,077 --> 00:24:45,407
(PARK JUNSEO, YICHEN, JANG YEOJUN, JEON MINWOOK)

625
00:24:45,607 --> 00:24:48,577
From the vibe that our members have,

626
00:24:48,907 --> 00:24:50,916
I really think it'll be "Trigger."

627
00:24:50,917 --> 00:24:52,117
I'm sure it's "Trigger."

628
00:24:52,417 --> 00:24:53,886
It could be "Breaking News."

629
00:24:53,887 --> 00:24:55,986
- Right. - We don't know yet.

630
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:57,516
Let's see.

631
00:24:57,587 --> 00:24:59,485
I really think it'll be "Time After Time."

632
00:24:59,486 --> 00:25:00,985
I think it'll be "KOOL-AID."

633
00:25:00,986 --> 00:25:03,326
- I think it'll be "KOOL-AID" too. - Oh, "KOOL-AID."

634
00:25:03,327 --> 00:25:04,627
- It could be "KOOL-AID." - I'm guessing "Time After Time."

635
00:25:04,657 --> 00:25:05,955
- Hold on. - We don't know yet.

636
00:25:05,956 --> 00:25:07,926
We don't know yet. This could be "Breaking News..."

637
00:25:07,927 --> 00:25:09,426
or "Trigger."

638
00:25:09,427 --> 00:25:11,196
Oh, gosh. If so,

639
00:25:11,766 --> 00:25:14,107
I won't be able to sleep much during this round either.

640
00:25:14,506 --> 00:25:18,036
Three, two, one.

641
00:25:19,137 --> 00:25:22,077
- Your facial expression. - Manage your facial expression.

642
00:25:22,177 --> 00:25:23,745
- Come on. - Hold on.

643
00:25:23,746 --> 00:25:24,816
It's all over now.

644
00:25:24,817 --> 00:25:26,147
- What's wrong? - It's over.

645
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:28,246
- What is it? - This is so nerve-racking.

646
00:25:28,716 --> 00:25:31,286
What is it? Please.

647
00:25:34,427 --> 00:25:36,387
- What is it? - We were right.

648
00:25:37,427 --> 00:25:38,657
"Trigger."

649
00:25:38,897 --> 00:25:40,996
- "Trigger." - Thank you.

650
00:25:41,927 --> 00:25:43,196
It was so obvious.

651
00:25:43,226 --> 00:25:44,296
I was happy.

652
00:25:44,597 --> 00:25:47,907
My image fits this song well.

653
00:25:48,137 --> 00:25:50,607
I like concepts like this.

654
00:25:50,637 --> 00:25:51,877
I think...

655
00:25:51,976 --> 00:25:53,577
I will be able to express...

656
00:25:53,907 --> 00:25:57,276
a restrained but provocative sexiness.

657
00:25:58,147 --> 00:25:59,775
- Yes! - Yes!

658
00:25:59,776 --> 00:26:01,285
(Room 1 got "Merry-Go-Round" as they expected.)

659
00:26:01,286 --> 00:26:02,686
"Merry-Go-Round!"

660
00:26:02,746 --> 00:26:03,817
I'm so happy.

661
00:26:04,157 --> 00:26:06,256
There are many things I can do that suits my age.

662
00:26:06,456 --> 00:26:08,587
I think I'll be able to show the audience a lot more.

663
00:26:09,286 --> 00:26:11,726
It suits us well.

664
00:26:12,627 --> 00:26:14,996
I think we could go after the first place spot.

665
00:26:15,026 --> 00:26:17,566
"Time After Time" and "Merry-Go-Round..."

666
00:26:17,567 --> 00:26:18,936
were tied for first place.

667
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:20,837
- Let's go. - One, two, three.

668
00:26:23,877 --> 00:26:25,607
- Yes! - Yes!

669
00:26:26,206 --> 00:26:28,275
- We got it. - We got it.

670
00:26:28,276 --> 00:26:29,847
- You took it off so quickly. - We got it.

671
00:26:30,476 --> 00:26:31,646
You know what you're doing.

672
00:26:31,647 --> 00:26:33,746
I really love this song.

673
00:26:34,446 --> 00:26:38,256
I think my voice will suit this song well.

674
00:26:38,357 --> 00:26:39,485
I like this song.

675
00:26:39,486 --> 00:26:41,086
We can't look at it right away.

676
00:26:41,087 --> 00:26:42,525
- We can't look at it right away. - What?

677
00:26:42,526 --> 00:26:43,526
- We can't... - Oh, my!

678
00:26:44,857 --> 00:26:45,857
- We can't... - Oh, my!

679
00:26:49,367 --> 00:26:51,397
- I like it! - That's what I expected.

680
00:26:51,766 --> 00:26:55,465
This was a song I was confident about.

681
00:26:55,466 --> 00:26:57,137
Firstly, I felt lost.

682
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,377
I'm one of the older members,

683
00:26:59,536 --> 00:27:01,546
and the other members are young.

684
00:27:02,006 --> 00:27:03,647
I think I'll have to push...

685
00:27:03,917 --> 00:27:06,147
a slightly different pure and fresh vibe.

686
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:08,485
- Hold on. - What?

687
00:27:08,486 --> 00:27:11,087
- I'm so nervous. - We wanted "Time After Time."

688
00:27:11,317 --> 00:27:13,486
But a T would have something sticking out from the side.

689
00:27:16,827 --> 00:27:18,556
- "Breaking News." - I see.

690
00:27:18,557 --> 00:27:19,756
"Breaking News."

691
00:27:22,097 --> 00:27:23,866
This really is "Breaking News."

692
00:27:23,867 --> 00:27:26,466
- This is a really fast rap. - I see.

693
00:27:26,536 --> 00:27:29,907
I have never really rapped before.

694
00:27:30,837 --> 00:27:32,077
I'm not confident.

695
00:27:32,506 --> 00:27:34,847
I thought I should show off...

696
00:27:35,546 --> 00:27:37,745
a new side of me on stage.

697
00:27:37,746 --> 00:27:41,587
I thought this could be a blessing in disguise.

698
00:27:41,917 --> 00:27:47,387
(The team and song assembly for Original Matching is complete.)

699
00:27:47,486 --> 00:27:49,256
(The 5 new songs have finally been revealed.)

700
00:27:50,756 --> 00:27:55,026
(Original Matching, the final stage before the finals)

701
00:27:55,496 --> 00:27:59,167
(The 5 new songs have finally come out into the world.)

702
00:27:59,796 --> 00:28:02,336
(And 5 performances have been prepared.)

703
00:28:02,337 --> 00:28:03,806
- This is fun. - This is insane.

704
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:05,107
It's time for my performance.

705
00:28:05,436 --> 00:28:06,636
I'm confident.

706
00:28:06,637 --> 00:28:08,045
We can get first place.

707
00:28:08,046 --> 00:28:09,576
(We'll get 1st place no matter what!)

708
00:28:09,577 --> 00:28:11,776
(There's a reason he's 1st place.)

709
00:28:12,417 --> 00:28:14,847
(It's already lunchtime after the team assembly.)

710
00:28:15,046 --> 00:28:17,046
- The smell. - It smells so good.

711
00:28:17,087 --> 00:28:18,357
- I'm hungry. - I'm hungry.

712
00:28:18,456 --> 00:28:20,356
- Bon appetit. - Bon appetit.

713
00:28:20,357 --> 00:28:21,485
(Eating lunch first before starting practice)

714
00:28:21,486 --> 00:28:23,556
- Enjoy. - Let's eat.

715
00:28:23,557 --> 00:28:25,357
- Enjoy. - It's warm.

716
00:28:25,827 --> 00:28:27,526
What's for lunch today?

717
00:28:28,226 --> 00:28:32,366
I was told these side dishes were picked by the World Assemblers.

718
00:28:32,367 --> 00:28:34,837
- They're the Top 7. - The Lunchbox Top 7.

719
00:28:34,966 --> 00:28:36,236
This looks delicious.

720
00:28:36,706 --> 00:28:38,107
Enjoy.

721
00:28:38,177 --> 00:28:40,436
- Bon appetit. - Enjoy.

722
00:28:40,536 --> 00:28:42,106
They rolled the meat.

723
00:28:42,107 --> 00:28:43,445
(Eating a bite of their favorite dishes first)

724
00:28:43,446 --> 00:28:44,716
This is the kind of flavor I like.

725
00:28:45,246 --> 00:28:46,246
Totally.

726
00:28:48,716 --> 00:28:50,186
The sausage has a nice texture.

727
00:28:50,857 --> 00:28:52,286
This is cheese pork cutlet.

728
00:28:52,587 --> 00:28:54,986
They rolled the pork cutlets. It's so cool.

729
00:28:55,387 --> 00:28:57,856
- I've never seen rolled cutlets. - This can't taste bad.

730
00:28:57,857 --> 00:28:59,157
(Cheese inside pork cutlets, a foolproof combination)

731
00:28:59,557 --> 00:29:00,696
(Taking a bite)

732
00:29:02,097 --> 00:29:03,396
I really like the texture.

733
00:29:03,397 --> 00:29:05,296
- Can I have one more? - And the sauce too.

734
00:29:06,097 --> 00:29:07,195
This is good.

735
00:29:07,196 --> 00:29:08,667
The pork cutlet is good.

736
00:29:09,006 --> 00:29:10,536
The pork cutlet is good.

737
00:29:11,177 --> 00:29:12,736
I'm going to eat spicy pork.

738
00:29:17,446 --> 00:29:19,177
This seems to be pork belly.

739
00:29:19,877 --> 00:29:21,445
I thought it was nice and thick.

740
00:29:21,446 --> 00:29:23,715
I don't think this is the hind leg meat.

741
00:29:23,716 --> 00:29:25,157
- It's pork belly? - It is.

742
00:29:25,756 --> 00:29:27,186
I know because I cook.

743
00:29:27,387 --> 00:29:28,857
The spicy pork is really good.

744
00:29:28,887 --> 00:29:30,756
- The spicy pork is really good. - The spicy pork is really good.

745
00:29:30,796 --> 00:29:32,025
- This place has good spicy pork. - It does.

746
00:29:32,026 --> 00:29:33,927
- The spicy pork is so addicting. - It is.

747
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:36,096
Did you watch "Culinary Class Wars?"

748
00:29:36,097 --> 00:29:38,167
- I did. - You should imitate them.

749
00:29:38,397 --> 00:29:39,435
Give me a bite.

750
00:29:39,436 --> 00:29:41,536
Please start your evaluation.

751
00:29:42,107 --> 00:29:43,465
Chew it slowly.

752
00:29:43,466 --> 00:29:44,637
Yes, slowly.

753
00:29:46,337 --> 00:29:49,975
(While his eyes are covered, they steal his side dishes.)

754
00:29:49,976 --> 00:29:51,577
Take your time to taste it.

755
00:29:53,016 --> 00:29:54,087
Is this basi?

756
00:29:55,446 --> 00:29:58,157
(They're just busy stealing his side dishes.)

757
00:29:58,486 --> 00:29:59,986
I really cleaned my tray.

758
00:30:00,516 --> 00:30:01,856
I cleaned my tray.

759
00:30:01,857 --> 00:30:03,427
(They emptied their lunchboxes in a flash.)

760
00:30:03,756 --> 00:30:06,256
- This is so good. - It's so good.

761
00:30:07,026 --> 00:30:08,127
I'm full.

762
00:30:08,367 --> 00:30:10,097
The spicy pork belly was the best.

763
00:30:10,966 --> 00:30:13,735
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

764
00:30:13,736 --> 00:30:15,567
- That was a nice meal. - Thank you for the food.

765
00:30:16,907 --> 00:30:18,877
(Now it's time to digest!)

766
00:30:21,877 --> 00:30:25,177
(PROJECT 7's 1st Sports Day)

767
00:30:26,077 --> 00:30:27,246
Oh, my.

768
00:30:27,387 --> 00:30:28,945
Oh, my. A sports day.

769
00:30:28,946 --> 00:30:30,387
It's a sports day.

770
00:30:30,786 --> 00:30:32,516
Oh, my.

771
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:34,456
What is this?

772
00:30:35,087 --> 00:30:37,057
- A sports day! - A sports day.

773
00:30:38,097 --> 00:30:39,857
Oh, my gosh.

774
00:30:40,456 --> 00:30:42,597
Oh, a sports day.

775
00:30:44,837 --> 00:30:46,097
Come here!

776
00:30:47,036 --> 00:30:48,736
What will we do?

777
00:30:49,206 --> 00:30:51,077
If we play basketball, I'll really dominate.

778
00:30:51,476 --> 00:30:52,837
Do you play basketball, JEONGMIN?

779
00:30:53,377 --> 00:30:54,446
You should all be scared.

780
00:30:55,177 --> 00:30:57,846
Let's form an alliance with our two teams, SEUNGHO.

781
00:30:57,847 --> 00:30:58,946
Okay.

782
00:30:59,046 --> 00:31:01,186
Is it okay for us to form an alliance with this weakling?

783
00:31:01,286 --> 00:31:02,817
Is it okay for us to form an alliance with this weakling?

784
00:31:03,147 --> 00:31:04,157
Pardon?

785
00:31:04,557 --> 00:31:06,056
Hey, if we play...

786
00:31:06,057 --> 00:31:07,626
Hello.

787
00:31:07,627 --> 00:31:11,357
(The trainees are surprised as seeing someone?)

788
00:31:11,756 --> 00:31:13,927
Hello.

789
00:31:14,097 --> 00:31:15,596
Hello.

790
00:31:15,597 --> 00:31:17,536
(PROJECT 7's special MC, Son Dong Pyo)

791
00:31:18,067 --> 00:31:19,996
His face is so small.

792
00:31:21,236 --> 00:31:22,506
Hello.

793
00:31:24,107 --> 00:31:25,177
Oh, my.

794
00:31:25,706 --> 00:31:27,677
- Hello. - Hello.

795
00:31:29,907 --> 00:31:33,546
Are you all surprised that I'm here at PROJECT 7?

796
00:31:33,716 --> 00:31:35,216
- Yes! - Yes!

797
00:31:35,617 --> 00:31:38,586
I will be the MC today for PROJECT 7's...

798
00:31:38,587 --> 00:31:40,387
first sports day.

799
00:31:40,557 --> 00:31:43,927
Coming to this place full of memories makes me nostalgic.

800
00:31:44,026 --> 00:31:46,296
I think I'm tearing up a bit.

801
00:31:46,456 --> 00:31:48,195
This feels very special.

802
00:31:48,196 --> 00:31:51,867
Are you ready to have a fun day with me?

803
00:31:51,937 --> 00:31:53,296
- Yes! - Yes!

804
00:31:53,437 --> 00:31:54,505
Great.

805
00:31:54,506 --> 00:31:57,536
Please look forward to finding out...

806
00:31:57,537 --> 00:31:58,875
what games we'll be playing.

807
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:00,775
And the most important thing...

808
00:32:00,776 --> 00:32:02,977
- Prizes! - Yes, you're right.

809
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:06,577
The winning team will get a benefit, everyone.

810
00:32:07,376 --> 00:32:08,517
(Very surprised)

811
00:32:09,486 --> 00:32:10,586
- What? - A benefit?

812
00:32:11,117 --> 00:32:13,216
A benefit.

813
00:32:13,416 --> 00:32:14,557
What do you think it'll be?

814
00:32:14,787 --> 00:32:16,026
A convenience store shopping spree.

815
00:32:16,126 --> 00:32:17,356
- Snacks? - Snacks.

816
00:32:17,957 --> 00:32:19,296
Fancam!

817
00:32:19,597 --> 00:32:20,657
Fancam?

818
00:32:20,927 --> 00:32:22,327
The performance order?

819
00:32:22,597 --> 00:32:24,437
The winning team's benefit...

820
00:32:25,196 --> 00:32:27,836
will be revealed at the end.

821
00:32:28,836 --> 00:32:29,836
(I see...)

822
00:32:31,376 --> 00:32:33,177
Holy moly, guacamole.

823
00:32:33,606 --> 00:32:35,477
If we don't know what it is, we won't have the desire to win.

824
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:38,416
You're quite negative.

825
00:32:39,247 --> 00:32:40,247
Am I?

826
00:32:40,446 --> 00:32:42,146
I'm a very positive kid.

827
00:32:43,316 --> 00:32:45,517
Before we start the sports day,

828
00:32:45,657 --> 00:32:47,416
would one member from each team...

829
00:32:47,657 --> 00:32:50,457
like to say a few words to show your determination?

830
00:32:50,526 --> 00:32:52,057
(Oh, my!)

831
00:32:53,057 --> 00:32:54,726
Which team wants to go first?

832
00:32:54,727 --> 00:32:56,026
We want to go first.

833
00:32:56,626 --> 00:32:57,965
- We should go first. - Us!

834
00:32:57,966 --> 00:32:59,666
Nice! "Trigger."

835
00:32:59,867 --> 00:33:02,307
(All eyes on MINWOOK)

836
00:33:02,537 --> 00:33:06,736
If you try to beat us, we'll shoot you.

837
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:11,177
"Shoot me and go."

838
00:33:11,646 --> 00:33:13,747
Oh, they're going to pull the trigger.

839
00:33:14,216 --> 00:33:15,315
(Who's next? Team "Breaking News")

840
00:33:15,316 --> 00:33:17,117
Okay. "Breaking News."

841
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:20,517
How dare you talk of guns in front of a marine?

842
00:33:23,557 --> 00:33:25,696
(Speechless)

843
00:33:25,827 --> 00:33:27,126
What year are you?

844
00:33:27,997 --> 00:33:29,596
That's so infuriating.

845
00:33:29,597 --> 00:33:32,937
The marine thing was strong. It was so strong.

846
00:33:33,236 --> 00:33:36,836
Who will go up against the marine?

847
00:33:37,207 --> 00:33:38,577
Okay. SEYUN.

848
00:33:39,276 --> 00:33:41,646
You all are old enough.

849
00:33:43,477 --> 00:33:45,416
(Doubting their ears)

850
00:33:46,716 --> 00:33:48,546
(The words of a boy born in 2007 make the older guys stand up.)

851
00:33:48,747 --> 00:33:51,557
We'll get first place with our young blood.

852
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:55,356
How could he attack our age?

853
00:33:57,227 --> 00:33:58,626
Hold back.

854
00:34:00,057 --> 00:34:01,396
"KOOL-AID" will go next.

855
00:34:02,867 --> 00:34:05,236
We'll beat you with just one foot!

856
00:34:10,206 --> 00:34:11,937
Oh, no. That was a bit weak.

857
00:34:12,407 --> 00:34:13,476
That was weak.

858
00:34:14,706 --> 00:34:18,145
We'll make a stage where only we'll be remembered.

859
00:34:18,146 --> 00:34:19,176
They'll throw you all away.

860
00:34:19,177 --> 00:34:21,045
If they see our performance, they'll throw you all away.

861
00:34:21,187 --> 00:34:22,916
(Talking about performances all of a sudden?)

862
00:34:23,746 --> 00:34:25,556
- Our performance? - They'll throw you all away.

863
00:34:25,755 --> 00:34:27,187
With sports too.

864
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:28,356
Okay.

865
00:34:28,985 --> 00:34:30,886
Now that you've shown your determination,

866
00:34:30,887 --> 00:34:32,456
We'll now begin...

867
00:34:32,456 --> 00:34:34,726
the 1st sports day of PROJECT 7...

868
00:34:34,996 --> 00:34:37,565
in earnest. Let's go!

869
00:34:38,437 --> 00:34:39,596
Let's go!

870
00:34:39,597 --> 00:34:42,105
(The 1st sports day of PROJECT 7 has begun.)

871
00:34:42,106 --> 00:34:43,706
All right. Here's the first project.

872
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:46,806
Guys, have you heard of this game of flipping the boards?

873
00:34:47,206 --> 00:34:49,505
- Flip the boards? - Oh, this?

874
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:51,775
I see. Flipping the boards?

875
00:34:52,446 --> 00:34:54,016
On PROJECT 7,

876
00:34:54,416 --> 00:34:56,946
assembling and upgrading are the key factors.

877
00:34:57,486 --> 00:35:00,887
So we prepared a game of flipping the cubes.

878
00:35:03,256 --> 00:35:04,756
- Flip the cubes? - Cubes?

879
00:35:05,427 --> 00:35:06,997
Three trainees will participate in the first round.

880
00:35:07,256 --> 00:35:08,867
Four trainees will participate in the second round.

881
00:35:08,997 --> 00:35:11,266
Each side of the cube has a different color.

882
00:35:11,267 --> 00:35:13,866
Within the time limit, you must flip the cubes...

883
00:35:13,867 --> 00:35:15,335
so that the color of your team...

884
00:35:15,336 --> 00:35:17,335
is the most common among colors of other teams...

885
00:35:17,336 --> 00:35:18,476
to win the game.

886
00:35:18,477 --> 00:35:19,577
(The team with the most cubes in their color will win.)

887
00:35:20,137 --> 00:35:22,006
- What should be our strategy? - I have no idea.

888
00:35:22,106 --> 00:35:23,576
We shouldn't randomly run around.

889
00:35:23,577 --> 00:35:25,416
Let's designate an area and flip cubes in that area.

890
00:35:25,617 --> 00:35:27,476
We should divide up the area.

891
00:35:27,477 --> 00:35:29,315
So everyone is responsible for their own spot.

892
00:35:29,316 --> 00:35:30,446
- Right. - That sounds like a good idea.

893
00:35:30,887 --> 00:35:31,956
So let me give you a tip.

894
00:35:31,957 --> 00:35:34,156
I've played a similar game before. Here's how it will go.

895
00:35:34,157 --> 00:35:35,755
If we flip it to our color, they'll flip it right back.

896
00:35:35,756 --> 00:35:36,986
- Right. - So leave it.

897
00:35:38,657 --> 00:35:39,996
We can keep following only one player.

898
00:35:39,997 --> 00:35:41,597
(His strategy is playing the leech.)

899
00:35:43,227 --> 00:35:44,296
Let's destroy all the cubes.

900
00:35:44,537 --> 00:35:45,566
What?

901
00:35:45,796 --> 00:35:47,266
- Well, that works, though. - Yes.

902
00:35:47,267 --> 00:35:48,636
We can just keep one.

903
00:35:48,637 --> 00:35:49,767
- We can destroy the rest. - It'd be perfect with four.

904
00:35:50,836 --> 00:35:53,907
Players for Round One, please come on out.

905
00:35:54,506 --> 00:35:55,605
You got this!

906
00:35:55,606 --> 00:35:56,606
(Which trainees will compete in Round 1?)

907
00:35:57,207 --> 00:35:59,677
(KIM JOOHYUN, KIM SIHUN, and KIM JEONGMIN will compete.)

908
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:01,186
Let's do this.

909
00:36:01,187 --> 00:36:02,747
(KANG MINSEO, KWON YONGHYUN, and ASAKA KOTARO will compete.)

910
00:36:02,946 --> 00:36:04,086
YICHEN, you take that side.

911
00:36:04,316 --> 00:36:05,585
I'll take the middle area. LYNNLYNN, you take that side.

912
00:36:05,586 --> 00:36:06,756
- I should go that way. - Okay.

913
00:36:07,216 --> 00:36:09,727
(JUNG SEYUN, SAKURADA KENSHIN, and ANDY will compete.)

914
00:36:10,086 --> 00:36:12,327
(BINGHUA, WOO HAJOON, and OH TAEHWAN will compete.)

915
00:36:12,557 --> 00:36:13,656
Great.

916
00:36:13,657 --> 00:36:17,395
It will begin once I blow my whistle.

917
00:36:17,396 --> 00:36:19,296
You will have one minute.

918
00:36:24,603 --> 00:36:26,543
(The trainees quickly enter the playing area.)

919
00:36:28,164 --> 00:36:30,235
(Team "Trigger" goes after the cubes right in front.)

920
00:36:31,434 --> 00:36:34,675
(Meanwhile, KIM JOOHYUN goes after the top row first.)

921
00:36:37,004 --> 00:36:38,014
Oh, my. What is this?

922
00:36:38,015 --> 00:36:40,014
They're so fast. Team "Merry-Go-Round" is...

923
00:36:40,015 --> 00:36:41,144
much faster than I expected.

924
00:36:41,715 --> 00:36:45,084
(Team "Merry-Go-Round" is unexpectedly performing quite well.)

925
00:36:45,454 --> 00:36:46,754
Keep going. Keep flipping.

926
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:49,254
They're doing... Look at him.

927
00:36:51,325 --> 00:36:52,354
Look at SIHUN!

928
00:36:52,825 --> 00:36:53,894
Look at SIHUN!

929
00:36:55,124 --> 00:36:56,594
That's a nice play. Yes.

930
00:36:56,595 --> 00:36:57,624
Hold on.

931
00:36:58,095 --> 00:37:00,234
SIHUN. What kind of strategy is that?

932
00:37:00,235 --> 00:37:01,264
Is that the Froggy Strategy?

933
00:37:01,265 --> 00:37:02,265
(Is a frog hugging the cubes?)

934
00:37:03,004 --> 00:37:05,204
(He starts flipping the cubes in a corner.)

935
00:37:05,704 --> 00:37:07,704
(At that moment, a disruptor shows up.)

936
00:37:08,075 --> 00:37:09,474
They're out!

937
00:37:10,544 --> 00:37:13,575
(Watching the game in the front row)

938
00:37:14,044 --> 00:37:15,285
(Meanwhile, how are things going for Team "Trigger?")

939
00:37:16,084 --> 00:37:18,615
(He's flipping the cubes peacefully.)

940
00:37:19,155 --> 00:37:20,155
Come on.

941
00:37:20,156 --> 00:37:22,155
(A professional disruptor from Team "Time After Time" shows up.)

942
00:37:22,724 --> 00:37:26,655
(Trainee KWON YONGHYUN steals the cubes at that moment.)

943
00:37:28,124 --> 00:37:30,495
(In the end, Team "Trigger" loses all the cubes in the end.)

944
00:37:31,365 --> 00:37:35,405
(Trainees are running all over the court.)

945
00:37:36,204 --> 00:37:39,274
Ten, nine, eight,

946
00:37:39,805 --> 00:37:42,504
seven, six, five,

947
00:37:42,704 --> 00:37:45,044
four, three, two...

948
00:37:45,814 --> 00:37:47,744
(Round 1 is over.)

949
00:37:47,745 --> 00:37:50,144
It's over. You can't touch the cubes now.

950
00:37:51,854 --> 00:37:53,083
(The trainees gave their all to the game.)

951
00:37:53,084 --> 00:37:54,155
Are you okay?

952
00:37:56,285 --> 00:37:57,385
Are you okay, BINGHUA?

953
00:37:58,155 --> 00:38:00,195
(Froggy SIHUN is exhausted too.)

954
00:38:00,555 --> 00:38:02,293
All right. We'll count...

955
00:38:02,294 --> 00:38:03,793
(What's the result for Round 1?)

956
00:38:03,794 --> 00:38:05,535
the cubes one at a time for each team.

957
00:38:05,794 --> 00:38:07,904
Let's count the cubes for "Breaking News."

958
00:38:07,905 --> 00:38:08,933
Let's count the black cubes.

959
00:38:08,934 --> 00:38:10,103
- "Breaking News!" - One, two, three, four,

960
00:38:10,104 --> 00:38:12,734
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, and eleven.

961
00:38:12,735 --> 00:38:13,874
(There are 11 blocks in just 1 corner.)

962
00:38:14,405 --> 00:38:16,144
Twelve, thirteen, and fourteen.

963
00:38:16,774 --> 00:38:18,715
Team "Breaking News" flipped 14 cubes.

964
00:38:19,374 --> 00:38:20,413
Let's count for Team "Merry-Go-Round."

965
00:38:20,414 --> 00:38:22,615
One, two, three...

966
00:38:23,015 --> 00:38:24,885
Ten, eleven,

967
00:38:25,254 --> 00:38:26,384
twelve...

968
00:38:26,385 --> 00:38:28,724
My gosh, that's the thirteenth block.

969
00:38:29,854 --> 00:38:31,925
But it's out of the pink lines.

970
00:38:33,294 --> 00:38:36,265
All right. I won't count this cube.

971
00:38:37,024 --> 00:38:40,294
(Utterly disappointed)

972
00:38:40,535 --> 00:38:42,334
Team "Merry-Go-Round" flipped 12 cubes.

973
00:38:42,564 --> 00:38:45,905
(14 blocks, 14 blocks, 13 blocks, 12 blocks, and 7 blocks)

974
00:38:46,075 --> 00:38:49,774
Team "KOOL-AID" and "Breaking News" are tied.

975
00:38:50,075 --> 00:38:53,615
They're both in first place for now.

976
00:38:54,845 --> 00:38:56,683
Players for Round Two,

977
00:38:56,684 --> 00:38:57,814
please come on out.

978
00:38:58,314 --> 00:38:59,314
Are you ready?

979
00:38:59,315 --> 00:39:00,385
- Yes! - Yes!

980
00:39:00,615 --> 00:39:01,683
You should go farthest from here. You go that way.

981
00:39:01,684 --> 00:39:03,124
- I will. - Okay. I'll flip cubes here.

982
00:39:03,354 --> 00:39:04,925
I'll flip everything here.

983
00:39:05,595 --> 00:39:06,893
CHENYU.

984
00:39:06,894 --> 00:39:08,024
- You got this. - Cut through there.

985
00:39:08,195 --> 00:39:09,594
All right. You only have one minute!

986
00:39:09,595 --> 00:39:10,794
(Utterly nervous)

987
00:39:16,535 --> 00:39:18,174
(The trainees run at lightning speed.)

988
00:39:18,175 --> 00:39:19,235
Be careful.

989
00:39:22,004 --> 00:39:24,245
(Trainee SEO KYOUNGBAE pushes the cubes into a corner.)

990
00:39:25,215 --> 00:39:27,215
(Team "Trigger" uses the same strategy.)

991
00:39:27,845 --> 00:39:29,245
Everyone has the same strategy.

992
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:33,354
(Trainee WU CHENYU tries to steal from Team "Trigger.")

993
00:39:33,814 --> 00:39:36,524
Let's go, MAJINGXIANG! Yes!

994
00:39:37,285 --> 00:39:39,495
(Team "Breaking News" takes the lead in the beginning.)

995
00:39:40,254 --> 00:39:41,663
- That's it. - You must flip the cubes.

996
00:39:41,664 --> 00:39:42,694
- Hey. - There you go.

997
00:39:42,695 --> 00:39:43,825
- Not that. - Okay.

998
00:39:44,325 --> 00:39:47,064
(The fight for the cubes is intense in Round 2.)

999
00:39:47,595 --> 00:39:49,334
- I'm taking these cubes. - Team Gray is taking them!

1000
00:39:49,604 --> 00:39:50,865
He's taking the cubes.

1001
00:39:51,604 --> 00:39:53,503
(Team "Breaking News" lifts a trainee, not cubes.)

1002
00:39:53,504 --> 00:39:54,574
Hey. Come on!

1003
00:39:54,575 --> 00:39:56,504
(Is he showing off the power of a former Marine?)

1004
00:39:57,704 --> 00:39:59,345
Team "Breaking News" is...

1005
00:39:59,774 --> 00:40:02,345
- using their physical strength. - They're wrestling almost.

1006
00:40:04,655 --> 00:40:06,655
My gosh, this is a mess.

1007
00:40:08,354 --> 00:40:10,425
(Trainee KIM SUNGMIN loses his cube.)

1008
00:40:11,954 --> 00:40:12,954
No!

1009
00:40:12,955 --> 00:40:14,155
(Somebody save me!)

1010
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:16,425
- This isn't right! - No!

1011
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:17,964
Let go!

1012
00:40:17,965 --> 00:40:19,135
(Trainee KIM SUNGMIN is carried away, unable to resist.)

1013
00:40:19,595 --> 00:40:21,603
Great! Yes!

1014
00:40:21,604 --> 00:40:23,404
- Hey, protect the cubes! - Don't come here.

1015
00:40:23,405 --> 00:40:24,704
- Hey, protect them. - Don't come.

1016
00:40:24,905 --> 00:40:27,235
(Team "Time After Time" starts collecting the cubes rather late.)

1017
00:40:27,434 --> 00:40:28,674
Go back! No!

1018
00:40:28,675 --> 00:40:30,204
(2 trainees from Team "KOOL-AID" charges forward to steal the cubes.)

1019
00:40:30,575 --> 00:40:31,575
Excuse me.

1020
00:40:31,845 --> 00:40:32,873
(They take 1 cube from the 2 teams.)

1021
00:40:32,874 --> 00:40:34,313
- First... Hey, that's not right. - My gosh.

1022
00:40:34,314 --> 00:40:35,413
What's going on?

1023
00:40:35,414 --> 00:40:36,444
(Trainee WU CHENYU fights back right away.)

1024
00:40:36,445 --> 00:40:37,445
That's it!

1025
00:40:37,715 --> 00:40:38,853
Stop them!

1026
00:40:38,854 --> 00:40:40,584
(His counterattack fails.)

1027
00:40:41,084 --> 00:40:43,724
- Five, four, - Stop them!

1028
00:40:43,854 --> 00:40:46,695
three, two, one.

1029
00:40:48,695 --> 00:40:50,764
(Round 2 is over.)

1030
00:40:50,765 --> 00:40:51,995
- That's it. - Bring them.

1031
00:40:53,164 --> 00:40:55,235
(What's the result?)

1032
00:40:55,465 --> 00:40:57,864
I will now announce...

1033
00:40:57,865 --> 00:41:00,974
the combined number of cubes from both Rounds 1 and 2.

1034
00:41:02,405 --> 00:41:03,504
Team "KOOL-AID."

1035
00:41:04,845 --> 00:41:05,945
Team "KOOL-AID."

1036
00:41:07,845 --> 00:41:08,984
You flipped 31 cubes.

1037
00:41:08,985 --> 00:41:11,345
(Team "KOOL-AID" won a total of 31 points.)

1038
00:41:13,254 --> 00:41:15,984
Team "Merry-Go-Round." You flipped 26 cubes.

1039
00:41:15,985 --> 00:41:17,325
(Team "Merry-Go-Round" won a total of 26 points.)

1040
00:41:18,124 --> 00:41:22,024
(Disappointed)

1041
00:41:22,495 --> 00:41:24,764
Team "Breaking News." You flipped 24 cubes.

1042
00:41:24,765 --> 00:41:26,564
(Team "Breaking News" won a total of 24 points.)

1043
00:41:27,135 --> 00:41:29,103
And Team "Trigger." You flipped 21 cubes.

1044
00:41:29,104 --> 00:41:30,664
(Team "Trigger" won a total of 21 points.)

1045
00:41:31,004 --> 00:41:34,075
Team "Time After Time." You flipped 15 cubes.

1046
00:41:34,805 --> 00:41:37,074
Based on the combined number...

1047
00:41:37,075 --> 00:41:38,373
of the flipped cubes from both rounds,

1048
00:41:38,374 --> 00:41:41,514
the winning team of this project is Team "KOOL-AID."

1049
00:41:41,515 --> 00:41:42,784
Let's give it up for them!

1050
00:41:42,785 --> 00:41:43,985
(Team "KOOL-AID" won the game.)

1051
00:41:44,485 --> 00:41:47,084
Team "KOOL-AID" had a great strategy.

1052
00:41:47,155 --> 00:41:49,723
Team "KOOL-AID," the winning team of the game,

1053
00:41:49,724 --> 00:41:52,223
- will receive 100 points. - Yes!

1054
00:41:52,224 --> 00:41:53,354
(Team "KOOL-AID" wins 100 points.)

1055
00:41:53,454 --> 00:41:54,454
Good job!

1056
00:41:54,695 --> 00:41:56,624
- This is so annoying. - They had a great strategy.

1057
00:41:57,564 --> 00:42:01,063
Let's lighten up the mood!

1058
00:42:01,064 --> 00:42:02,064
Let's go.

1059
00:42:02,065 --> 00:42:05,535
(Lighten up the mood!)

1060
00:42:06,235 --> 00:42:07,873
- Let's do it! - Lighten it up!

1061
00:42:07,874 --> 00:42:09,704
Great. Let's lighten up the mood...

1062
00:42:10,075 --> 00:42:12,144
and move onto the next project.

1063
00:42:13,215 --> 00:42:15,615
Everyone, when you're on competition shows,

1064
00:42:16,115 --> 00:42:17,485
you have to live together in a dorm.

1065
00:42:18,015 --> 00:42:21,285
What do you think is the most important part?

1066
00:42:22,524 --> 00:42:23,684
It's stamina!

1067
00:42:24,684 --> 00:42:26,894
I'll give you half a point for that!

1068
00:42:28,024 --> 00:42:29,925
(He gets 0.5 points.)

1069
00:42:29,995 --> 00:42:31,894
- Gosh, good for you! - Good for you!

1070
00:42:32,035 --> 00:42:33,164
- I envy you. - I envy you.

1071
00:42:33,934 --> 00:42:35,865
It wasn't much. I know. I'm sorry.

1072
00:42:36,265 --> 00:42:37,365
Thank you.

1073
00:42:38,104 --> 00:42:40,704
To test your physical fitness...

1074
00:42:41,075 --> 00:42:42,674
as well as improve it,

1075
00:42:42,675 --> 00:42:44,874
we prepared this third project.

1076
00:42:45,445 --> 00:42:48,015
It's called Squats with a Princess in Your Arms!

1077
00:42:48,684 --> 00:42:49,885
- Squats. - I see.

1078
00:42:50,515 --> 00:42:53,555
Well, one of us is known to have developed glutes.

1079
00:42:54,215 --> 00:42:57,524
All right. Let's select two trainees who will represent the team.

1080
00:42:57,954 --> 00:43:00,325
Hey, KYOUNGBAE. You have to do this one.

1081
00:43:02,224 --> 00:43:03,325
Don't loosen up.

1082
00:43:03,564 --> 00:43:05,695
My gosh, I don't think I can do it. You do it.

1083
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,163
(Everyone tries out the squats.)

1084
00:43:08,164 --> 00:43:09,204
Are you okay?

1085
00:43:10,064 --> 00:43:11,135
Are you okay?

1086
00:43:11,575 --> 00:43:12,575
You're heavy.

1087
00:43:13,575 --> 00:43:15,504
(An unusual pose for squats)

1088
00:43:15,874 --> 00:43:18,314
(Lifting up)

1089
00:43:18,474 --> 00:43:19,474
Hold on.

1090
00:43:20,215 --> 00:43:22,214
You don't have the princess in your arms.

1091
00:43:22,215 --> 00:43:24,544
You're trying to abduct the princess.

1092
00:43:25,184 --> 00:43:26,454
You're not carrying her in your arms.

1093
00:43:27,084 --> 00:43:29,554
- Who wants to do squats? - I want to do it.

1094
00:43:29,555 --> 00:43:30,684
You can't tense up your muscles, though.

1095
00:43:30,885 --> 00:43:32,223
This won't tense up my muscles.

1096
00:43:32,224 --> 00:43:33,394
(He's already tying up his shoelace.)

1097
00:43:33,754 --> 00:43:35,994
All right. I need two trainees from each team.

1098
00:43:35,995 --> 00:43:38,634
Please come over here.

1099
00:43:38,635 --> 00:43:39,695
Come up here.

1100
00:43:40,095 --> 00:43:42,265
Which color do you want?

1101
00:43:43,564 --> 00:43:44,603
Can we go with purple?

1102
00:43:44,604 --> 00:43:46,104
- Let's go with purple. - Yes.

1103
00:43:47,175 --> 00:43:49,204
Hold on. How about blue?

1104
00:43:49,374 --> 00:43:50,474
Or green?

1105
00:43:51,445 --> 00:43:52,643
Don't do anything, my princess.

1106
00:43:52,644 --> 00:43:54,745
(Prince YONGHYUN and Princess MINSEO)

1107
00:43:55,184 --> 00:43:57,345
- Hey, there are earrings too. - There are earrings.

1108
00:43:58,314 --> 00:43:59,984
(Fully embracing the princess game)

1109
00:43:59,985 --> 00:44:01,314
- Does it hurt? - No.

1110
00:44:02,285 --> 00:44:03,953
(The prince is wearing earrings for this team.)

1111
00:44:03,954 --> 00:44:05,425
Princess, you look beautiful.

1112
00:44:06,425 --> 00:44:08,294
Wait, look at YICHEN.

1113
00:44:08,495 --> 00:44:09,765
They're on a date.

1114
00:44:09,965 --> 00:44:11,995
- Give me an arm. - An arm?

1115
00:44:12,535 --> 00:44:13,564
Okay.

1116
00:44:15,535 --> 00:44:17,334
ANDY, you look so adorable.

1117
00:44:18,035 --> 00:44:19,805
But MINSEO looks pretty.

1118
00:44:21,235 --> 00:44:23,405
Hey, how come only JOOHYUN...

1119
00:44:23,504 --> 00:44:25,575
doesn't have the princess gloves? Why does he have rubber gloves?

1120
00:44:26,015 --> 00:44:28,074
How come only JOOHYUN has rubber gloves,

1121
00:44:28,075 --> 00:44:29,143
not the princess gloves?

1122
00:44:29,144 --> 00:44:30,985
Why do we have rubber gloves?

1123
00:44:32,015 --> 00:44:35,754
Everyone, assume your position and step on the mat.

1124
00:44:36,584 --> 00:44:38,123
(They can assume any pose other than the piggyback ride pose.)

1125
00:44:38,124 --> 00:44:40,123
- You have to hold onto me. - I have to?

1126
00:44:40,124 --> 00:44:41,724
- All right. Like this. - Like this?

1127
00:44:42,894 --> 00:44:44,094
Come up. Hold on.

1128
00:44:44,095 --> 00:44:47,135
We'll begin once you all step onto the mat.

1129
00:44:47,834 --> 00:44:49,503
- After that... - Is that pose allowed?

1130
00:44:49,504 --> 00:44:51,235
Do princes lift princesses like that?

1131
00:44:52,235 --> 00:44:54,434
Our theme is abducting the princess.

1132
00:44:54,675 --> 00:44:56,273
We're going to abduct the princess.

1133
00:44:56,274 --> 00:44:57,873
Step onto the mat.

1134
00:44:57,874 --> 00:44:59,374
- One, two, three. - Two, three.

1135
00:44:59,474 --> 00:45:00,474
Okay.

1136
00:45:00,475 --> 00:45:04,715
(The other three teams go with the standard pose.)

1137
00:45:07,055 --> 00:45:08,184
We can do this.

1138
00:45:09,084 --> 00:45:11,155
Great. Let's begin.

1139
00:45:11,555 --> 00:45:13,953
- Let's go. - Let's go. Let's do this.

1140
00:45:13,954 --> 00:45:15,825
- You got this! - You got this!

1141
00:45:16,325 --> 00:45:18,124
Let's begin. One.

1142
00:45:19,995 --> 00:45:20,995
One.

1143
00:45:21,195 --> 00:45:23,765
(Their squat poses are stable.)

1144
00:45:24,104 --> 00:45:25,535
He did it so easily.

1145
00:45:26,334 --> 00:45:27,334
Two.

1146
00:45:27,335 --> 00:45:29,745
(Next to the couple with a stable squat...)

1147
00:45:29,974 --> 00:45:31,004
Two.

1148
00:45:31,774 --> 00:45:33,174
You can do this.

1149
00:45:33,175 --> 00:45:35,514
- Three. - You can do this.

1150
00:45:35,515 --> 00:45:36,615
My gosh. All right.

1151
00:45:37,215 --> 00:45:39,385
- KYOUNGBAE can't do it. - Three.

1152
00:45:40,314 --> 00:45:41,484
KYOUNGBAE!

1153
00:45:41,485 --> 00:45:42,485
(Keep going, KYOUNGBAE!)

1154
00:45:42,885 --> 00:45:43,985
Four.

1155
00:45:44,084 --> 00:45:45,495
You can do this.

1156
00:45:46,394 --> 00:45:47,594
Five!

1157
00:45:47,595 --> 00:45:48,824
(Meanwhile, it's a piece of cake for YONGHYUN.)

1158
00:45:48,825 --> 00:45:50,124
Gosh, this is easy for us.

1159
00:45:50,425 --> 00:45:51,664
One more. Six!

1160
00:45:53,164 --> 00:45:55,103
HANBIN seems the most relaxed.

1161
00:45:55,104 --> 00:45:56,365
(HANBIN is easily doing his squats.)

1162
00:45:57,035 --> 00:45:58,404
My gosh, you got this!

1163
00:45:58,405 --> 00:46:00,274
- JUNSEO, you got this! - Grab me harder with your arm.

1164
00:46:00,405 --> 00:46:01,474
Harder? Okay.

1165
00:46:02,104 --> 00:46:04,203
You must hang onto me. Grab my sweater.

1166
00:46:04,204 --> 00:46:05,245
Okay.

1167
00:46:05,314 --> 00:46:07,914
(Gripping)

1168
00:46:08,385 --> 00:46:09,413
Seven.

1169
00:46:09,414 --> 00:46:11,784
(Feeling maximum competitiveness)

1170
00:46:11,785 --> 00:46:12,814
Great!

1171
00:46:13,184 --> 00:46:15,354
So far, so good for everyone.

1172
00:46:15,425 --> 00:46:17,425
All right. How do you feel right now?

1173
00:46:17,854 --> 00:46:18,924
My princess is very light.

1174
00:46:18,925 --> 00:46:20,925
(My princess is very light.)

1175
00:46:22,794 --> 00:46:23,925
Excellent.

1176
00:46:24,224 --> 00:46:26,465
You seem a bit tired. Are you all right?

1177
00:46:26,664 --> 00:46:28,634
I think he lied about his weight.

1178
00:46:28,635 --> 00:46:29,865
(A suspicion of deceiving his weight)

1179
00:46:31,405 --> 00:46:32,503
So it was a sham marriage!

1180
00:46:32,504 --> 00:46:34,474
(Everyone passes Round 1 of the Princess Squats.)

1181
00:46:34,974 --> 00:46:38,515
All right. This time around, you can watch me and copy my move.

1182
00:46:38,814 --> 00:46:42,514
Squat down. Step to the right. Step to the left. Then come back.

1183
00:46:42,515 --> 00:46:43,814
Then come up.

1184
00:46:44,414 --> 00:46:47,084
(That's too much!)

1185
00:46:47,115 --> 00:46:48,885
- Gosh. - My gosh, you're being too harsh.

1186
00:46:50,084 --> 00:46:52,325
(They fix their pose.)

1187
00:46:52,624 --> 00:46:54,524
JUNSEO, your personal trainer is watching!

1188
00:46:54,995 --> 00:46:57,495
Step to the right. Step to the left.

1189
00:46:57,695 --> 00:46:59,894
Come up now. Okay.

1190
00:47:01,564 --> 00:47:04,465
- My gosh, JUNSEO. - JUNSEO is on another level.

1191
00:47:05,204 --> 00:47:07,874
Step to the right. Step to the left.

1192
00:47:08,104 --> 00:47:09,474
Come up.

1193
00:47:10,845 --> 00:47:12,845
- This seems easy for YONGHYUN. - What?

1194
00:47:14,215 --> 00:47:15,215
(Most of the princesses look stable.)

1195
00:47:15,216 --> 00:47:17,584
Step to the right. Step to the left.

1196
00:47:18,044 --> 00:47:20,614
My gosh, look at HAJOON.

1197
00:47:20,615 --> 00:47:21,754
What's he doing?

1198
00:47:22,325 --> 00:47:23,854
HAJOON is a koala.

1199
00:47:24,624 --> 00:47:26,023
I'm about to fall off.

1200
00:47:26,024 --> 00:47:27,254
Hey, he's going to fall off.

1201
00:47:28,055 --> 00:47:29,465
I'll hunch over. Fix your pose.

1202
00:47:30,695 --> 00:47:32,095
I don't think I can do it.

1203
00:47:32,834 --> 00:47:34,464
- Seven seconds. - Hey, look at them.

1204
00:47:34,465 --> 00:47:36,304
He looks like the turtle shell.

1205
00:47:36,305 --> 00:47:37,365
HANBIN!

1206
00:47:37,704 --> 00:47:38,933
MINSEO seems tired too.

1207
00:47:38,934 --> 00:47:39,934
(Oddly, this game is harder on the princesses.)

1208
00:47:40,305 --> 00:47:41,804
Hey, look at JOOHYUN's back.

1209
00:47:41,805 --> 00:47:43,374
His skin is exposed.

1210
00:47:43,945 --> 00:47:45,474
His skin is exposed?

1211
00:47:45,874 --> 00:47:48,015
Hold on. We must protect the princess' honor!

1212
00:47:48,075 --> 00:47:49,413
- Hurry. - Protect the princess!

1213
00:47:49,414 --> 00:47:50,814
- Protect the princess. - Here.

1214
00:47:50,845 --> 00:47:52,583
Pull down his sweater. Protect Team "KOOL-AID."

1215
00:47:52,584 --> 00:47:54,055
(Pulling up)

1216
00:47:54,715 --> 00:47:56,354
- I can't do it. - Hold on.

1217
00:47:56,555 --> 00:47:57,555
I'm tired.

1218
00:47:57,655 --> 00:47:59,154
All right. Protect your princess.

1219
00:47:59,155 --> 00:48:00,794
JOOHYUN, just come down!

1220
00:48:02,925 --> 00:48:05,894
(Princess JOOHYUN chose honor over victory.)

1221
00:48:05,934 --> 00:48:07,134
Team "KOOL-AID" will be ranked last.

1222
00:48:07,135 --> 00:48:09,564
(Team "KOOL-AID" is ranked last.)

1223
00:48:12,774 --> 00:48:14,204
Did you see that?

1224
00:48:14,735 --> 00:48:16,704
(Next to Princess JOOHYUN who kept her honor,)

1225
00:48:17,405 --> 00:48:19,175
(there's another princess who's struggling.)

1226
00:48:19,974 --> 00:48:22,144
(This game seems quite tough on Prince KYOUNGBAE.)

1227
00:48:23,044 --> 00:48:24,285
It's getting close for KYOUNGBAE.

1228
00:48:25,314 --> 00:48:26,754
KYOUNGBAE, you got this!

1229
00:48:29,285 --> 00:48:31,123
(He couldn't hang in there. He gives up in the end.)

1230
00:48:31,124 --> 00:48:33,655
All right. Another team has failed miserably.

1231
00:48:33,754 --> 00:48:35,393
- It's okay. Nice try. - Team "Merry-Go-Round" is done.

1232
00:48:35,394 --> 00:48:36,664
Team "Merry-Go-Round" comes in fourth place.

1233
00:48:37,365 --> 00:48:38,494
- Good job. - Since this is PROJECT 7,

1234
00:48:38,495 --> 00:48:39,664
you'll hold it for seven seconds.

1235
00:48:39,765 --> 00:48:41,035
KYOUNGBAE, you hung in there for long.

1236
00:48:41,064 --> 00:48:42,434
Nice, KYOUNGBAE!

1237
00:48:43,405 --> 00:48:45,703
All right. This time around, since this is PROJECT 7,

1238
00:48:45,704 --> 00:48:47,035
you'll hold it for seven seconds.

1239
00:48:47,434 --> 00:48:48,434
All right.

1240
00:48:48,435 --> 00:48:49,473
(Looking serious)

1241
00:48:49,474 --> 00:48:53,044
One, two, three, four,

1242
00:48:53,474 --> 00:48:55,945
- JUNSEO did a full squat. - five, six...

1243
00:48:56,485 --> 00:49:00,055
Four, five, six, seven.

1244
00:49:01,055 --> 00:49:02,623
My gosh, JUNSEO!

1245
00:49:02,624 --> 00:49:04,184
JUNSEO! Let's go!

1246
00:49:05,894 --> 00:49:06,994
There's a cicada.

1247
00:49:06,995 --> 00:49:09,294
Oh, my. No!

1248
00:49:10,365 --> 00:49:12,994
(Two cicadas are pitifully dangling.)

1249
00:49:12,995 --> 00:49:15,034
(One of the cicadas gets eliminated first.)

1250
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:17,305
- Hey, I can't do it. - Seven. Okay.

1251
00:49:17,765 --> 00:49:18,904
Team "Time After Time" did...

1252
00:49:18,905 --> 00:49:20,035
- a great job. - Nice job.

1253
00:49:20,104 --> 00:49:21,534
Unfortunately, he couldn't come up.

1254
00:49:21,535 --> 00:49:22,604
- Well done. - Good job.

1255
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:25,974
All right. The remaining teams are...

1256
00:49:26,044 --> 00:49:28,015
Team "Trigger" and Team "Breaking News."

1257
00:49:28,544 --> 00:49:30,143
- Let's go, KWON YONGHYUN! - YONGHYUN!

1258
00:49:30,144 --> 00:49:31,714
- Let's go, PARK JUNSEO! - Let's go.

1259
00:49:31,715 --> 00:49:34,254
- PARK JUNSEO! - PARK JUNSEO!

1260
00:49:36,055 --> 00:49:37,984
All right. Let's do another squat.

1261
00:49:37,985 --> 00:49:39,095
Seven seconds.

1262
00:49:39,524 --> 00:49:41,054
(They will decide the squat champion now.)

1263
00:49:41,055 --> 00:49:43,624
One, two, three,

1264
00:49:44,095 --> 00:49:46,695
four, five, six...

1265
00:49:47,195 --> 00:49:49,704
(A determined gaze)

1266
00:49:50,235 --> 00:49:52,075
- Look at JUNSEO's face. - Seven, six,

1267
00:49:52,704 --> 00:49:56,044
- He's serious about this. - four, three, two...

1268
00:49:56,604 --> 00:49:58,715
Seven. You know what?

1269
00:49:59,644 --> 00:50:01,644
(He's serious about it too.)

1270
00:50:03,015 --> 00:50:04,285
They're so strong.

1271
00:50:04,445 --> 00:50:05,485
- All right. - Good job!

1272
00:50:05,885 --> 00:50:07,954
Since they're really good,

1273
00:50:08,314 --> 00:50:09,825
let's go with ten seconds this time.

1274
00:50:10,854 --> 00:50:12,954
JUNSEO will last no matter how long it is.

1275
00:50:14,224 --> 00:50:16,925
JUNSEO! You got this!

1276
00:50:17,965 --> 00:50:19,933
(Fixing his hair)

1277
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:21,495
- I'm good. - Are you good now?

1278
00:50:21,595 --> 00:50:23,103
(They will hold the squat for 10 seconds.)

1279
00:50:23,104 --> 00:50:25,004
Ten, nine,

1280
00:50:25,374 --> 00:50:27,135
eight, seven...

1281
00:50:27,604 --> 00:50:30,044
Hold on. What if YONGHYUN's whole body aches tomorrow?

1282
00:50:30,144 --> 00:50:31,144
Ten...

1283
00:50:31,145 --> 00:50:33,015
Six, five,

1284
00:50:33,215 --> 00:50:34,844
- You can do this! - four,

1285
00:50:34,845 --> 00:50:37,385
- three, two, one. - JUNSEO, your pose looks great.

1286
00:50:40,615 --> 00:50:41,615
This battle is...

1287
00:50:41,616 --> 00:50:42,684
- about their masculinity now. - Right.

1288
00:50:43,354 --> 00:50:44,454
You know what? I give up.

1289
00:50:44,954 --> 00:50:46,825
I'll give you a chance to tie. Yes or no?

1290
00:50:47,394 --> 00:50:49,124
I can do about five more.

1291
00:50:49,595 --> 00:50:50,694
Great.

1292
00:50:50,695 --> 00:50:52,294
I can do about five more.

1293
00:50:52,834 --> 00:50:54,635
Great. Team "Trigger?"

1294
00:50:55,064 --> 00:50:56,234
I can do ten more.

1295
00:50:56,235 --> 00:50:57,704
(He calls it and raises another five.)

1296
00:50:57,934 --> 00:51:00,604
Stop it! That's enough.

1297
00:51:01,075 --> 00:51:02,374
They're so manly.

1298
00:51:02,675 --> 00:51:04,304
If I were doing that, I would've begged to tie it.

1299
00:51:04,305 --> 00:51:05,715
Same here. I would've tied it too.

1300
00:51:06,515 --> 00:51:09,584
This time, we'll do ten squats in a row.

1301
00:51:10,184 --> 00:51:11,584
- Hold onto me. - Yes.

1302
00:51:13,115 --> 00:51:14,254
All right.

1303
00:51:15,584 --> 00:51:16,754
- One. - One,

1304
00:51:18,555 --> 00:51:20,394
two, three,

1305
00:51:21,095 --> 00:51:22,224
four,

1306
00:51:22,564 --> 00:51:23,995
- A little more! - five...

1307
00:51:24,724 --> 00:51:26,894
- Seriously. - It's not ending.

1308
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:29,535
Now, things are getting truly amazing.

1309
00:51:31,465 --> 00:51:34,175
(Clenching his teeth to do the squats)

1310
00:51:36,405 --> 00:51:37,845
YONGHYUN is tired now!

1311
00:51:39,575 --> 00:51:40,614
Six.

1312
00:51:40,615 --> 00:51:41,984
(He's also tired.)

1313
00:51:41,985 --> 00:51:43,015
Seven.

1314
00:51:43,544 --> 00:51:45,454
YONGHYUN, JUNSEO is tired too!

1315
00:51:45,715 --> 00:51:47,655
(Who will win this battle?)

1316
00:51:47,715 --> 00:51:48,753
Hey.

1317
00:51:48,754 --> 00:51:52,055
(Team "Breaking News" is out.)

1318
00:51:53,294 --> 00:51:54,925
- Well done. - Good job.

1319
00:51:55,624 --> 00:51:58,194
Hey, we win!

1320
00:51:58,195 --> 00:51:59,235
Nine.

1321
00:51:59,595 --> 00:52:00,595
- Ten! - Ten!

1322
00:52:00,995 --> 00:52:05,305
(I did it.)

1323
00:52:06,704 --> 00:52:08,235
You won first place!

1324
00:52:11,104 --> 00:52:12,874
- My gosh. - Goodness, PARK JUNSEO!

1325
00:52:12,945 --> 00:52:14,413
(JUNSEO carried the team to bring...)

1326
00:52:14,414 --> 00:52:16,845
With this, Team "Trigger" wins the game!

1327
00:52:17,544 --> 00:52:19,985
- He was amazing. - You know what? He was so good.

1328
00:52:20,015 --> 00:52:21,385
JUNSEO, that was so cool!

1329
00:52:22,425 --> 00:52:24,885
- Nice. - That was cool!

1330
00:52:26,524 --> 00:52:28,023
Great job, everyone.

1331
00:52:28,024 --> 00:52:30,424
The sports day is not over until it is.

1332
00:52:30,425 --> 00:52:32,495
Let's move onto the next project.

1333
00:52:34,635 --> 00:52:35,834
Yes.

1334
00:52:36,664 --> 00:52:41,374
It's the game you have the most experience with.

1335
00:52:41,675 --> 00:52:42,874
Is it a tug-of-war?

1336
00:52:43,305 --> 00:52:45,445
- I bet it's Random Play Dance. - Random Play Dance.

1337
00:52:45,675 --> 00:52:48,675
This game is played by many idol stars.

1338
00:52:49,684 --> 00:52:52,784
It's Charades!

1339
00:52:52,785 --> 00:52:54,014
(The next game is Charades.)

1340
00:52:54,015 --> 00:52:55,425
- I wanted to play this. - Oh, this one...

1341
00:52:55,524 --> 00:52:57,555
Whenever I watched it on TV, I always wanted to play it.

1342
00:52:57,825 --> 00:52:59,123
I'm really good at this game.

1343
00:52:59,124 --> 00:53:00,354
I'm good at guessing.

1344
00:53:00,655 --> 00:53:02,265
I can do this well.

1345
00:53:02,465 --> 00:53:04,694
Playing charades...

1346
00:53:04,695 --> 00:53:07,334
is one of the compulsory elements.

1347
00:53:08,265 --> 00:53:10,234
One person will see the keyword...

1348
00:53:10,235 --> 00:53:11,904
and express it using only his body.

1349
00:53:11,905 --> 00:53:13,404
The rest of the members will see that...

1350
00:53:13,405 --> 00:53:16,075
and guess the answer.

1351
00:53:16,374 --> 00:53:18,003
You will take turns...

1352
00:53:18,004 --> 00:53:20,214
to be the one explaining the keyword.

1353
00:53:20,215 --> 00:53:21,674
You can give up...

1354
00:53:21,675 --> 00:53:23,515
that you don't think you can do.

1355
00:53:24,544 --> 00:53:26,453
This is about how the person explains...

1356
00:53:26,454 --> 00:53:27,683
but also about how you guess the answer.

1357
00:53:27,684 --> 00:53:29,853
- That's right. - Or it's difficult to get it.

1358
00:53:29,854 --> 00:53:31,454
Let's pass when there's something we don't know.

1359
00:53:32,124 --> 00:53:33,524
Okay.

1360
00:53:33,624 --> 00:53:35,024
"KOOL-AID."

1361
00:53:35,495 --> 00:53:37,194
You can choose one person from the opponent team...

1362
00:53:37,195 --> 00:53:38,965
to hold the sketchbook.

1363
00:53:39,394 --> 00:53:40,535
JEON MINWOOK.

1364
00:53:40,865 --> 00:53:41,893
Okay.

1365
00:53:41,894 --> 00:53:42,933
(JEON MINWOOK)

1366
00:53:42,934 --> 00:53:43,965
(Startled)

1367
00:53:44,064 --> 00:53:45,575
- Okay. - MINWOOK will hold it up.

1368
00:53:46,035 --> 00:53:47,404
- Please move your hands fast. - Okay.

1369
00:53:47,405 --> 00:53:49,004
The great hands.

1370
00:53:49,644 --> 00:53:51,404
Fast hands.

1371
00:53:51,405 --> 00:53:52,414
(Moving slowly)

1372
00:53:53,115 --> 00:53:55,544
Okay. That's how we'll all do it.

1373
00:53:56,285 --> 00:53:57,884
He's not trying to be slow.

1374
00:53:57,885 --> 00:53:59,354
He's a slow person.

1375
00:54:00,285 --> 00:54:03,353
Now, we'll...

1376
00:54:03,354 --> 00:54:05,825
begin the game.

1377
00:54:06,354 --> 00:54:08,354
- I feel embarrassed. - Get ready.

1378
00:54:09,465 --> 00:54:10,594
Let's go.

1379
00:54:10,595 --> 00:54:11,664
(Game starts.)

1380
00:54:12,195 --> 00:54:14,894
(The first keyword is given.)

1381
00:54:16,235 --> 00:54:17,265
I guess it's a difficult one.

1382
00:54:22,305 --> 00:54:23,305
"GAMBLER."

1383
00:54:23,306 --> 00:54:24,644
- "MAVERICK." - "MAVERICK."

1384
00:54:25,515 --> 00:54:27,373
(It's the choreography of that song.)

1385
00:54:27,374 --> 00:54:28,414
- "MAVERICK." - "MAVERICK."

1386
00:54:29,144 --> 00:54:30,714
"MAVERICK" by The Boyz.

1387
00:54:30,715 --> 00:54:32,184
(Just the front part!)

1388
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:35,014
- They Boyz. - That's correct.

1389
00:54:35,015 --> 00:54:37,184
That's how you do it.

1390
00:54:37,954 --> 00:54:39,124
Turn the page.

1391
00:54:39,495 --> 00:54:42,095
(What's the next keyword?)

1392
00:54:42,624 --> 00:54:43,794
This is how it is?

1393
00:54:44,064 --> 00:54:45,124
This is a bit difficult.

1394
00:54:45,664 --> 00:54:47,464
(The keyword is a proverb.)

1395
00:54:47,465 --> 00:54:48,494
I have my own fish to fry.

1396
00:54:48,495 --> 00:54:49,865
(They got the answer immediately.)

1397
00:54:49,965 --> 00:54:51,603
(Pointing)

1398
00:54:51,604 --> 00:54:52,604
I have my own fish to fry.

1399
00:54:52,605 --> 00:54:53,635
(The hint gave out everything.)

1400
00:54:53,834 --> 00:54:55,004
His mouth.

1401
00:54:55,434 --> 00:54:56,544
Please be careful of your mouth.

1402
00:54:56,575 --> 00:54:58,444
- Your mouth. - Don't mouth it.

1403
00:54:58,445 --> 00:55:00,214
Don't mouth the words.

1404
00:55:00,215 --> 00:55:01,614
(Team "KOOL-AID" gets a warning.)

1405
00:55:01,615 --> 00:55:03,245
(What would be the next keyword?)

1406
00:55:03,615 --> 00:55:05,615
(Moving awkwardly)

1407
00:55:06,215 --> 00:55:08,925
(They're supposed to guess from that?)

1408
00:55:09,885 --> 00:55:10,885
- What is that? - Belt?

1409
00:55:10,886 --> 00:55:12,224
Taekwondo.

1410
00:55:12,624 --> 00:55:13,694
Judo?

1411
00:55:13,695 --> 00:55:14,723
(He surprisingly gets it correct.)

1412
00:55:14,724 --> 00:55:15,724
- Judo. - That's right.

1413
00:55:15,725 --> 00:55:16,924
- Right. - It's judo?

1414
00:55:16,925 --> 00:55:18,164
- It's correct. - What?

1415
00:55:18,294 --> 00:55:19,865
Goodness. He guessed it.

1416
00:55:21,434 --> 00:55:22,564
How did he guess that?

1417
00:55:22,905 --> 00:55:23,965
Next.

1418
00:55:24,434 --> 00:55:26,434
(RIIZE)

1419
00:55:27,474 --> 00:55:28,674
(He dances immediately.)

1420
00:55:28,675 --> 00:55:29,805
"Siren."

1421
00:55:30,004 --> 00:55:31,143
- RIIZE. - RIIZE.

1422
00:55:31,144 --> 00:55:32,314
That's correct.

1423
00:55:32,644 --> 00:55:33,773
Why are they so good?

1424
00:55:33,774 --> 00:55:35,274
The keywords are too easy.

1425
00:55:36,015 --> 00:55:37,385
Next.

1426
00:55:38,245 --> 00:55:39,583
He has to express this well.

1427
00:55:39,584 --> 00:55:40,954
(Getting into the mood)

1428
00:55:41,584 --> 00:55:42,925
- He has to express this well. - Headache?

1429
00:55:43,224 --> 00:55:44,385
Tylenol.

1430
00:55:44,724 --> 00:55:45,724
Tylenol.

1431
00:55:45,724 --> 00:55:46,724
Headache.

1432
00:55:46,995 --> 00:55:48,754
- I don't know. - Sadness.

1433
00:55:49,765 --> 00:55:50,824
Depression.

1434
00:55:50,825 --> 00:55:51,894
- Correct. - Depression.

1435
00:55:52,495 --> 00:55:53,664
What's that?

1436
00:55:54,135 --> 00:55:55,264
SIHUN is good.

1437
00:55:55,265 --> 00:55:57,333
- SIHUN is good. - How did he guess that?

1438
00:55:57,334 --> 00:55:58,465
SIHUN.

1439
00:55:58,635 --> 00:55:59,774
We don't have much time left.

1440
00:56:00,704 --> 00:56:02,035
Gorilla. King Kong.

1441
00:56:02,474 --> 00:56:03,474
Correct.

1442
00:56:03,845 --> 00:56:04,874
Basin.

1443
00:56:05,044 --> 00:56:07,575
- Frog. Frog in a well. - Correct.

1444
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:09,314
SIHUN.

1445
00:56:09,385 --> 00:56:10,445
Why is he so good?

1446
00:56:10,985 --> 00:56:12,714
- SIHUN. - What is he?

1447
00:56:12,715 --> 00:56:13,814
SIHUN.

1448
00:56:14,385 --> 00:56:15,724
(Bowling)

1449
00:56:16,325 --> 00:56:17,353
Goodness.

1450
00:56:17,354 --> 00:56:18,723
(SIHUN explains well too.)

1451
00:56:18,724 --> 00:56:19,794
- Bowling. - Bowling.

1452
00:56:20,394 --> 00:56:22,023
- It's over. - Okay.

1453
00:56:22,024 --> 00:56:23,324
(Team "KOOK-AID"'s game is over.)

1454
00:56:23,325 --> 00:56:24,364
What are they?

1455
00:56:24,365 --> 00:56:25,393
Nice.

1456
00:56:25,394 --> 00:56:26,464
It was amazing.

1457
00:56:26,465 --> 00:56:27,834
He did everything.

1458
00:56:27,965 --> 00:56:29,365
- What's with SIHUN? - How many did they get?

1459
00:56:29,905 --> 00:56:33,003
Team "KOOL-AID" got eight correct answers.

1460
00:56:33,004 --> 00:56:34,373
(Team "KOOL-AID" got 8 correct answers.)

1461
00:56:34,374 --> 00:56:36,004
Nice. Team "KOOL-AID."

1462
00:56:36,504 --> 00:56:37,704
They guessed eight correctly?

1463
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:39,245
The second team.

1464
00:56:39,374 --> 00:56:41,273
- Team "Merry-Go-Round." - Let's do this.

1465
00:56:41,274 --> 00:56:42,384
(Team "Merry-Go-Round" goes second.)

1466
00:56:42,385 --> 00:56:43,615
Let's go.

1467
00:56:43,785 --> 00:56:45,514
Are you ready, Team "Merry-Go-Round?"

1468
00:56:45,515 --> 00:56:46,654
- Yes. - Yes.

1469
00:56:46,655 --> 00:56:48,515
(Get ready, go.)

1470
00:56:48,684 --> 00:56:50,524
(Rhythmic gymnastics)

1471
00:56:52,055 --> 00:56:53,424
- It's difficult. - It's difficult.

1472
00:56:53,425 --> 00:56:54,825
(The first keyword isn't easy.)

1473
00:56:55,394 --> 00:56:56,524
Circus.

1474
00:56:56,825 --> 00:56:58,023
Fitness.

1475
00:56:58,024 --> 00:56:59,164
Hiking?

1476
00:56:59,894 --> 00:57:01,164
It's similar.

1477
00:57:01,595 --> 00:57:03,365
(He gets on the floor.)

1478
00:57:03,434 --> 00:57:04,604
What's that?

1479
00:57:06,405 --> 00:57:07,405
What's that?

1480
00:57:08,535 --> 00:57:10,805
(They can't guess it despite his passionate acting.)

1481
00:57:11,644 --> 00:57:12,974
It's difficult.

1482
00:57:16,215 --> 00:57:18,314
- Rhythmic gymnastics. - Rhythmic gymnastics.

1483
00:57:19,015 --> 00:57:20,055
Correct.

1484
00:57:20,954 --> 00:57:22,184
That's rhythmic gymnastics?

1485
00:57:22,854 --> 00:57:23,985
They got that one correct?

1486
00:57:25,084 --> 00:57:26,095
Next.

1487
00:57:27,695 --> 00:57:29,524
(The keywords make many people kneel down.)

1488
00:57:29,995 --> 00:57:32,865
(Outcry)

1489
00:57:34,064 --> 00:57:35,135
Despair.

1490
00:57:35,704 --> 00:57:36,704
(It's similar to the keyword.)

1491
00:57:36,705 --> 00:57:37,834
Delight.

1492
00:57:38,035 --> 00:57:39,575
Fascinating.

1493
00:57:39,704 --> 00:57:41,704
- Outcry. - Outcry.

1494
00:57:43,204 --> 00:57:44,345
That's correct.

1495
00:57:46,144 --> 00:57:47,245
JIHOON.

1496
00:57:47,274 --> 00:57:48,274
Go.

1497
00:57:48,275 --> 00:57:49,445
(Pausing)

1498
00:57:49,715 --> 00:57:51,313
(It's a difficult proverb.)

1499
00:57:51,314 --> 00:57:53,254
- Pass. - Pass.

1500
00:57:53,414 --> 00:57:55,253
(They're shocked by his bold decision.)

1501
00:57:55,254 --> 00:57:56,284
(They show him the next keyword.)

1502
00:57:56,285 --> 00:57:57,385
Okay.

1503
00:57:58,854 --> 00:58:00,595
- How do you do this? - This...

1504
00:58:01,195 --> 00:58:03,524
(Why can't you move?)

1505
00:58:05,865 --> 00:58:07,434
KIM SUNGMIN.

1506
00:58:07,965 --> 00:58:09,934
Don't tell me.

1507
00:58:10,635 --> 00:58:12,434
You have 50 seconds.

1508
00:58:12,805 --> 00:58:13,873
We're at risk.

1509
00:58:13,874 --> 00:58:15,374
(It's a BTS dance.)

1510
00:58:15,974 --> 00:58:17,144
What is that?

1511
00:58:17,805 --> 00:58:19,344
(We don't know.)

1512
00:58:19,345 --> 00:58:20,374
"Energetic?"

1513
00:58:20,575 --> 00:58:21,774
- Wanna One? - Wanna One?

1514
00:58:23,084 --> 00:58:24,445
Pass.

1515
00:58:25,115 --> 00:58:26,313
No.

1516
00:58:26,314 --> 00:58:27,314
(How could you pass BTS?)

1517
00:58:27,315 --> 00:58:29,384
You shouldn't pass this!

1518
00:58:29,385 --> 00:58:31,183
He senses that he's doomed.

1519
00:58:31,184 --> 00:58:32,425
(He's more nervous because of their reactions.)

1520
00:58:32,595 --> 00:58:33,995
- What is it? - Really?

1521
00:58:34,294 --> 00:58:35,964
Next.

1522
00:58:35,965 --> 00:58:36,965
(The next keyword is shown.)

1523
00:58:38,195 --> 00:58:40,834
- Baseball. Okay. - Correct.

1524
00:58:41,365 --> 00:58:42,664
I'm in trouble.

1525
00:58:44,004 --> 00:58:45,164
You have 30 seconds left.

1526
00:58:47,235 --> 00:58:48,674
Cat.

1527
00:58:48,675 --> 00:58:50,043
(Correct)

1528
00:58:50,044 --> 00:58:51,575
Okay. That's correct.

1529
00:58:51,845 --> 00:58:53,044
ANDY.

1530
00:58:53,644 --> 00:58:54,715
ANDY is good.

1531
00:58:54,845 --> 00:58:56,214
Why are you so bad, SUNGMIN?

1532
00:58:56,215 --> 00:58:57,644
(ANDY scolds SUNGMIN out of frustration.)

1533
00:59:00,354 --> 00:59:02,055
(Lying down)

1534
00:59:02,555 --> 00:59:03,954
(What is this?)

1535
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:05,723
Sleeping.

1536
00:59:05,724 --> 00:59:06,794
(Eating)

1537
00:59:06,995 --> 00:59:08,494
Sleeping.

1538
00:59:08,495 --> 00:59:10,063
- Piece of cake. - Piece of cake.

1539
00:59:10,064 --> 00:59:11,494
- Correct. - Hurry up.

1540
00:59:11,495 --> 00:59:13,534
He's good.

1541
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:14,535
Next.

1542
00:59:15,334 --> 00:59:16,904
- Nose? - Pig.

1543
00:59:16,905 --> 00:59:18,034
Correct.

1544
00:59:18,035 --> 00:59:19,175
How did you know just by the nose?

1545
00:59:19,805 --> 00:59:20,805
Next.

1546
00:59:20,806 --> 00:59:22,844
(The Korean word is difficult for KENSHIN.)

1547
00:59:22,845 --> 00:59:24,274
I'm sorry. I don't know what that is.

1548
00:59:25,374 --> 00:59:26,974
(I'm sorry. I'll pass.)

1549
00:59:28,814 --> 00:59:30,044
"I'm sorry. I don't know what that is."

1550
00:59:30,485 --> 00:59:31,543
The end.

1551
00:59:31,544 --> 00:59:33,154
(The game ended with his apology.)

1552
00:59:33,155 --> 00:59:34,485
Team "Merry-Go-Round..."

1553
00:59:35,215 --> 00:59:37,985
scored 6 points. They got 6 answers correctly.

1554
00:59:38,454 --> 00:59:39,595
They got a lot of correct answers.

1555
00:59:42,055 --> 00:59:44,325
(Trainee ANDY is very angry.)

1556
00:59:44,894 --> 00:59:46,035
What was the keyword?

1557
00:59:46,834 --> 00:59:48,063
BTS.

1558
00:59:48,064 --> 00:59:49,164
What?

1559
00:59:49,405 --> 00:59:51,135
- What was it? - BTS.

1560
00:59:52,934 --> 00:59:53,973
(Shaking)

1561
00:59:53,974 --> 00:59:55,675
ANDY.

1562
00:59:58,405 --> 01:00:00,445
This could cause a controversy.

1563
01:00:01,414 --> 01:00:03,643
He's not related to PROJECT 7.

1564
01:00:03,644 --> 01:00:07,055
He's not related to PROJECT 7.

1565
01:00:07,485 --> 01:00:09,824
Please apologize to BTS.

1566
01:00:09,825 --> 01:00:11,655
- I'm sorry. - Great.

1567
01:00:11,825 --> 01:00:13,294
Please take good care of him.

1568
01:00:15,124 --> 01:00:16,893
Team "Merry-Go-Round..."

1569
01:00:16,894 --> 01:00:18,623
scored six points...

1570
01:00:18,624 --> 01:00:20,564
and are currently in second place.

1571
01:00:21,235 --> 01:00:23,834
Next is Team "Breaking News."

1572
01:00:24,405 --> 01:00:25,434
Shall we go?

1573
01:00:26,635 --> 01:00:28,373
Get ready.

1574
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:30,405
Let's go.

1575
01:00:32,004 --> 01:00:34,144
(Boxing)

1576
01:00:34,615 --> 01:00:35,774
I can't see it.

1577
01:00:35,814 --> 01:00:37,385
(One, two)

1578
01:00:38,144 --> 01:00:39,453
- Boxing. - Boxing.

1579
01:00:39,454 --> 01:00:40,515
Correct.

1580
01:00:43,224 --> 01:00:44,224
(What?)

1581
01:00:44,225 --> 01:00:46,495
(BLACKPINK)

1582
01:00:46,724 --> 01:00:48,724
(He's getting flustered by BLACKPINK?)

1583
01:00:49,595 --> 01:00:51,265
(Is he sympathizing with him?)

1584
01:00:51,664 --> 01:00:52,865
What?

1585
01:00:53,394 --> 01:00:54,695
Hurry.

1586
01:00:55,164 --> 01:00:57,035
- Hurry. - This is the second doom.

1587
01:00:57,564 --> 01:01:00,704
(He's dancing.)

1588
01:01:01,274 --> 01:01:02,434
What's that?

1589
01:01:04,675 --> 01:01:06,344
Pass.

1590
01:01:06,345 --> 01:01:07,845
- Pass. - It's a variety show.

1591
01:01:08,715 --> 01:01:09,813
Pass it.

1592
01:01:09,814 --> 01:01:10,814
(But he doesn't know how to give up.)

1593
01:01:10,815 --> 01:01:11,914
What?

1594
01:01:13,314 --> 01:01:15,084
- BLACKPINK. - Correct.

1595
01:01:16,724 --> 01:01:18,084
He did it in an interesting way.

1596
01:01:18,655 --> 01:01:19,954
That's a variety show.

1597
01:01:20,854 --> 01:01:22,224
What's that?

1598
01:01:23,465 --> 01:01:25,095
(Quickly moving on to the next keyword)

1599
01:01:25,425 --> 01:01:26,893
- Tiger. - Correct.

1600
01:01:26,894 --> 01:01:28,264
(They quickly move on since they were delayed.)

1601
01:01:28,265 --> 01:01:29,834
- Fencing. - Fencing.

1602
01:01:30,604 --> 01:01:32,635
- They're good. - Hurry.

1603
01:01:32,934 --> 01:01:33,934
(It's Trainee AHN JUNWON's turn.)

1604
01:01:33,934 --> 01:01:34,934
Okay.

1605
01:01:35,474 --> 01:01:36,474
Okay.

1606
01:01:36,474 --> 01:01:37,474
(Penguin)

1607
01:01:39,845 --> 01:01:41,414
(Walking)

1608
01:01:42,075 --> 01:01:44,144
(He tries his best and becomes a penguin.)

1609
01:01:44,544 --> 01:01:45,914
- Penguin. - Correct.

1610
01:01:47,914 --> 01:01:49,215
How did he get it from that?

1611
01:01:49,825 --> 01:01:52,324
- Ten, nine, - Penguin.

1612
01:01:52,325 --> 01:01:54,123
eight, seven,

1613
01:01:54,124 --> 01:01:55,793
- six, - Forgiveness.

1614
01:01:55,794 --> 01:01:57,624
- Apologize. I'm sorry. - Request.

1615
01:01:58,325 --> 01:02:00,635
- Eager. - Eager.

1616
01:02:00,894 --> 01:02:03,464
five, four, three...

1617
01:02:03,465 --> 01:02:04,604
It's over.

1618
01:02:05,465 --> 01:02:06,675
It's over.

1619
01:02:06,974 --> 01:02:08,034
There's none.

1620
01:02:08,035 --> 01:02:09,234
(The keywords are over because they played quickly.)

1621
01:02:09,235 --> 01:02:11,144
There are no keywords left.

1622
01:02:11,245 --> 01:02:13,675
Okay. Team "Breaking News..."

1623
01:02:14,544 --> 01:02:16,914
- I think we got nine. - We answered many.

1624
01:02:17,115 --> 01:02:20,814
You got 8 points. You got 8 answers correctly.

1625
01:02:20,914 --> 01:02:23,055
- It wasn't bad. - Well done.

1626
01:02:24,084 --> 01:02:26,424
Next. Are you ready, Team "Trigger?"

1627
01:02:26,425 --> 01:02:27,523
- Yes. - Yes.

1628
01:02:27,524 --> 01:02:28,624
Let's start.

1629
01:02:29,664 --> 01:02:31,424
(Game start)

1630
01:02:31,425 --> 01:02:32,465
What's that?

1631
01:02:36,765 --> 01:02:37,805
Are you crazy?

1632
01:02:38,305 --> 01:02:39,603
Fear. Shock.

1633
01:02:39,604 --> 01:02:41,174
(He says words that come to his mind.)

1634
01:02:41,175 --> 01:02:42,503
Out of one's mind.

1635
01:02:42,504 --> 01:02:44,174
- No way. Fluster. - Fluster.

1636
01:02:44,175 --> 01:02:46,715
- Pass. - Out of one's mind.

1637
01:02:47,175 --> 01:02:49,175
Leave when he comes. Okay.

1638
01:02:49,544 --> 01:02:50,845
Why are you slow?

1639
01:02:51,885 --> 01:02:54,314
(It's a perfect keyword for slow MINWOOK.)

1640
01:02:54,655 --> 01:02:56,523
- Slow motion. - Slow motion. Slowly.

1641
01:02:56,524 --> 01:02:57,524
Universe.

1642
01:02:57,555 --> 01:02:58,754
- Zero gravity. - Zero gravity.

1643
01:03:05,164 --> 01:03:06,594
JEON MINWOOK?

1644
01:03:06,595 --> 01:03:07,664
(Isn't that just JEON MINWOOK?)

1645
01:03:07,865 --> 01:03:09,365
- JEON MINWOOK? - JEON MINWOOK.

1646
01:03:10,035 --> 01:03:11,103
Rooftop.

1647
01:03:11,104 --> 01:03:12,973
Sloth.

1648
01:03:12,974 --> 01:03:14,473
Sloth.

1649
01:03:14,474 --> 01:03:15,604
Sloth. Correct.

1650
01:03:16,004 --> 01:03:17,044
- Sloth. - Go.

1651
01:03:18,204 --> 01:03:19,245
This.

1652
01:03:22,544 --> 01:03:23,584
Crocodile?

1653
01:03:23,845 --> 01:03:26,015
Live fish. Fish.

1654
01:03:26,414 --> 01:03:27,683
Eel. Loach.

1655
01:03:27,684 --> 01:03:28,684
Loach.

1656
01:03:28,914 --> 01:03:30,384
Even worms squirm when they're stepped on.

1657
01:03:30,385 --> 01:03:31,655
Correct.

1658
01:03:32,655 --> 01:03:33,825
- He guessed that. - Next.

1659
01:03:34,325 --> 01:03:35,424
YEOJUN did well.

1660
01:03:35,425 --> 01:03:37,624
(Archery)

1661
01:03:37,925 --> 01:03:39,765
What?

1662
01:03:40,294 --> 01:03:42,334
(It's not an ordinary archery.)

1663
01:03:42,465 --> 01:03:43,534
What?

1664
01:03:43,535 --> 01:03:45,364
What?

1665
01:03:45,365 --> 01:03:46,804
What's that?

1666
01:03:46,805 --> 01:03:48,574
(They're shocked by his moves.)

1667
01:03:48,575 --> 01:03:49,604
What's that?

1668
01:03:50,474 --> 01:03:52,874
What's that? Is he writing it with his butt?

1669
01:03:53,015 --> 01:03:54,044
What's that?

1670
01:03:54,345 --> 01:03:56,083
(His continued moves confuse them.)

1671
01:03:56,084 --> 01:03:58,044
- What's that? - Monkey.

1672
01:03:58,314 --> 01:04:00,413
He's expressing it one by one.

1673
01:04:00,414 --> 01:04:01,454
Sheep.

1674
01:04:01,854 --> 01:04:02,925
Sheep.

1675
01:04:03,184 --> 01:04:04,683
That's...

1676
01:04:04,684 --> 01:04:07,224
(Whatever he's expressing, it's funny.)

1677
01:04:09,055 --> 01:04:10,694
What's that? Sheep.

1678
01:04:10,695 --> 01:04:12,265
Sheep. Archery?

1679
01:04:12,664 --> 01:04:14,564
Archery.

1680
01:04:15,495 --> 01:04:16,563
(He got it correct by chance.)

1681
01:04:16,564 --> 01:04:18,563
- Archery. - He got that correct?

1682
01:04:18,564 --> 01:04:19,834
How did you get that?

1683
01:04:20,235 --> 01:04:21,235
Next.

1684
01:04:21,236 --> 01:04:23,345
(Superficial)

1685
01:04:24,745 --> 01:04:25,773
Okay.

1686
01:04:25,774 --> 01:04:27,945
(Superficial)

1687
01:04:28,474 --> 01:04:29,543
Superficial.

1688
01:04:29,544 --> 01:04:30,944
- Okay. Correct. - How did you guess that?

1689
01:04:30,945 --> 01:04:31,984
Who was it?

1690
01:04:31,985 --> 01:04:33,114
(Game ended.)

1691
01:04:33,115 --> 01:04:34,184
The end.

1692
01:04:34,354 --> 01:04:37,684
Team "Trigger" scored five points.

1693
01:04:38,354 --> 01:04:39,824
- Good. - Our...

1694
01:04:39,825 --> 01:04:41,724
We're physically strong but we're dumb.

1695
01:04:42,124 --> 01:04:43,294
That's what we are.

1696
01:04:44,124 --> 01:04:45,195
The last team.

1697
01:04:45,765 --> 01:04:47,035
Team "Time After Time."

1698
01:04:47,235 --> 01:04:49,164
Let's go.

1699
01:04:49,504 --> 01:04:50,604
Let's go.

1700
01:04:51,664 --> 01:04:54,535
(Fanning on a house on fire)

1701
01:04:55,905 --> 01:04:56,973
This is difficult.

1702
01:04:56,974 --> 01:04:57,974
(They start with a difficult keyword.)

1703
01:04:58,504 --> 01:05:00,845
(Trying hard)

1704
01:05:01,715 --> 01:05:02,913
- Frying pan. - Egg.

1705
01:05:02,914 --> 01:05:03,984
Fishing?

1706
01:05:03,985 --> 01:05:05,745
This is bad.

1707
01:05:06,715 --> 01:05:08,885
(It's not easy to express a proverb.)

1708
01:05:09,555 --> 01:05:11,055
- Chopping firewood. - Chopping firewood.

1709
01:05:11,084 --> 01:05:13,253
Fanning on a house on fire.

1710
01:05:13,254 --> 01:05:14,954
Okay. Correct.

1711
01:05:15,155 --> 01:05:17,425
YOO YOUNGSEO.

1712
01:05:17,465 --> 01:05:19,394
(Ski jumping)

1713
01:05:20,265 --> 01:05:21,265
Ski.

1714
01:05:22,934 --> 01:05:25,003
(He acts it out perfectly.)

1715
01:05:25,004 --> 01:05:27,103
- Ski jumping. - Okay. That's correct.

1716
01:05:27,104 --> 01:05:28,703
Next.

1717
01:05:28,704 --> 01:05:31,004
Amazing.

1718
01:05:31,405 --> 01:05:32,575
How do they get it?

1719
01:05:33,245 --> 01:05:35,414
(Cheetah)

1720
01:05:36,615 --> 01:05:38,845
(Expressing the spotted cheetah)

1721
01:05:39,044 --> 01:05:40,584
Head, shoulders, knees. What is that?

1722
01:05:41,584 --> 01:05:42,813
Head, shoulders, knees.

1723
01:05:42,814 --> 01:05:44,753
What's that?

1724
01:05:44,754 --> 01:05:46,594
- Pass. - Hurry.

1725
01:05:46,595 --> 01:05:49,094
They passed so many times. There are no keywords left.

1726
01:05:49,095 --> 01:05:50,224
(Taekwondo)

1727
01:05:51,365 --> 01:05:52,663
- Taekwondo. - Taekwondo.

1728
01:05:52,664 --> 01:05:54,194
(Taekwondo is correct.)

1729
01:05:54,195 --> 01:05:55,393
- Okay. Correct. - Hurry.

1730
01:05:55,394 --> 01:05:56,434
Run.

1731
01:05:57,165 --> 01:05:58,204
I can't see it.

1732
01:05:58,205 --> 01:05:59,673
(He comes back to his position.)

1733
01:05:59,674 --> 01:06:01,134
- No. - Is it a pass?

1734
01:06:01,205 --> 01:06:02,474
- Pass. - Pass.

1735
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:05,343
Did he come back?

1736
01:06:05,344 --> 01:06:08,415
(Anger)

1737
01:06:08,644 --> 01:06:10,914
- You're mad. Anger. - Anger.

1738
01:06:10,915 --> 01:06:12,284
(He quickly gets the answer.)

1739
01:06:12,285 --> 01:06:13,313
That's right.

1740
01:06:13,314 --> 01:06:14,415
Anger. Correct.

1741
01:06:15,455 --> 01:06:16,985
Next. This is easy.

1742
01:06:17,224 --> 01:06:18,755
(Refreshing)

1743
01:06:19,625 --> 01:06:21,825
- TWS. - TWS.

1744
01:06:22,024 --> 01:06:23,325
He acts well.

1745
01:06:24,125 --> 01:06:26,264
(Fear)

1746
01:06:27,894 --> 01:06:29,464
- Despair, scream. - Depression.

1747
01:06:30,005 --> 01:06:31,035
LEE HANBIN.

1748
01:06:31,434 --> 01:06:32,764
It's LEE HANBIN.

1749
01:06:32,865 --> 01:06:33,934
LEE HANBIN.

1750
01:06:34,335 --> 01:06:36,405
- This is fear. - What is it?

1751
01:06:36,644 --> 01:06:38,804
- Fear? - Fear.

1752
01:06:39,505 --> 01:06:41,945
(LEE HANBIN equals fear.)

1753
01:06:43,014 --> 01:06:45,114
Why is fear LEE HANBIN?

1754
01:06:45,115 --> 01:06:46,115
(Why is fear LEE HANBIN?)

1755
01:06:46,116 --> 01:06:47,184
Okay.

1756
01:06:47,714 --> 01:06:50,724
The winners of the Charades project...

1757
01:06:51,024 --> 01:06:52,754
are Team "KOOL-AID" and Team "Breaking News."

1758
01:06:52,755 --> 01:06:54,654
They're tied with the same points.

1759
01:06:54,655 --> 01:06:56,694
We'll give both teams 100 points.

1760
01:06:56,695 --> 01:06:57,825
We're in first place.

1761
01:06:58,264 --> 01:06:59,794
- Nice. - Great.

1762
01:06:59,795 --> 01:07:01,695
You're quite good.

1763
01:07:02,335 --> 01:07:04,005
- You're quite good. - You're quite good.

1764
01:07:04,304 --> 01:07:06,603
We prepared one more bonus game.

1765
01:07:06,604 --> 01:07:08,235
Yes!

1766
01:07:10,274 --> 01:07:12,273
(Expecting)

1767
01:07:12,274 --> 01:07:14,945
It's the Newspaper Game.

1768
01:07:15,945 --> 01:07:17,713
- Get on my back. - Get on his back.

1769
01:07:17,714 --> 01:07:19,284
Will this work?

1770
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:21,284
- This works? - Lift one foot up.

1771
01:07:21,285 --> 01:07:22,684
- Lift one foot. - Lift one foot.

1772
01:07:22,814 --> 01:07:24,184
- Lift one foot. - I can't do it.

1773
01:07:24,655 --> 01:07:25,785
I can't do it.

1774
01:07:26,255 --> 01:07:28,023
- Go up. - Me?

1775
01:07:28,024 --> 01:07:29,255
- Me? - I don't know.

1776
01:07:29,394 --> 01:07:31,125
Hold on.

1777
01:07:31,224 --> 01:07:32,325
Just try it.

1778
01:07:32,564 --> 01:07:33,664
(Pressing)

1779
01:07:33,665 --> 01:07:35,195
It hurts.

1780
01:07:35,835 --> 01:07:36,964
It hurts!

1781
01:07:38,335 --> 01:07:40,303
- Why can't you balance? - It won't work.

1782
01:07:40,304 --> 01:07:42,774
It's not about balancing. I told you it won't work.

1783
01:07:42,804 --> 01:07:44,604
They all did it like that.

1784
01:07:44,745 --> 01:07:46,915
We can't do it because we're fat.

1785
01:07:47,714 --> 01:07:51,615
(The other teams keep falling.)

1786
01:07:54,455 --> 01:07:56,214
Team "Merry-Go-Round" wins!

1787
01:07:58,285 --> 01:08:01,255
Team "Merry-Go-Round" takes the victory.

1788
01:08:01,325 --> 01:08:03,094
Are you okay?

1789
01:08:03,394 --> 01:08:06,264
The next bonus game is Pose Challenge.

1790
01:08:06,695 --> 01:08:08,463
(Pose Challenge?)

1791
01:08:08,464 --> 01:08:09,464
Pose?

1792
01:08:10,205 --> 01:08:12,405
Every member of the team will come up...

1793
01:08:12,665 --> 01:08:16,234
and turn around 10 times within 30 seconds.

1794
01:08:16,474 --> 01:08:19,444
You should copy the pose...

1795
01:08:19,444 --> 01:08:22,774
that is shown on the monitor.

1796
01:08:23,644 --> 01:08:25,343
- I'm really good at this. - Me too.

1797
01:08:25,344 --> 01:08:26,714
Who is bad at this?

1798
01:08:26,854 --> 01:08:28,584
I don't think I'll do well.

1799
01:08:28,585 --> 01:08:30,154
Okay. Good.

1800
01:08:30,984 --> 01:08:34,955
It's a game that could show us your teamwork.

1801
01:08:35,295 --> 01:08:36,495
Get ready.

1802
01:08:36,865 --> 01:08:38,795
(They start spinning while holding their noses!)

1803
01:08:39,165 --> 01:08:41,094
(Tap dancing)

1804
01:08:41,365 --> 01:08:43,264
You're too slow, JOONWOO.

1805
01:08:43,904 --> 01:08:44,933
One.

1806
01:08:44,934 --> 01:08:46,203
(Among the fast members)

1807
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:47,505
Four, five.

1808
01:08:47,974 --> 01:08:49,404
Be careful.

1809
01:08:50,505 --> 01:08:51,974
(He's cute.)

1810
01:08:52,205 --> 01:08:53,913
Four, five, six...

1811
01:08:53,915 --> 01:08:55,714
Hey. Seven, eight,

1812
01:08:56,115 --> 01:08:59,314
(Among the quick turners...)

1813
01:08:59,984 --> 01:09:02,115
- Five, six... - HANBIN is too slow.

1814
01:09:02,314 --> 01:09:03,785
What's wrong with HANBIN?

1815
01:09:04,024 --> 01:09:05,024
Eight.

1816
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:07,424
(What's wrong with him?)

1817
01:09:08,755 --> 01:09:10,893
- Four, five, - He's quick.

1818
01:09:10,894 --> 01:09:12,694
six, seven.

1819
01:09:12,694 --> 01:09:13,764
(The trainee tops keep spinning.)

1820
01:09:15,464 --> 01:09:18,234
Come in order.

1821
01:09:18,505 --> 01:09:20,634
In the order you're standing.

1822
01:09:21,234 --> 01:09:22,674
In the order you're standing.

1823
01:09:23,174 --> 01:09:24,344
You're the second.

1824
01:09:24,974 --> 01:09:26,573
It works.

1825
01:09:26,575 --> 01:09:28,615
- Put force. - It works.

1826
01:09:29,474 --> 01:09:31,045
The pose is cute.

1827
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:34,354
(Lying down)

1828
01:09:34,455 --> 01:09:36,554
Don't do it from there.

1829
01:09:36,755 --> 01:09:38,054
I can't see it.

1830
01:09:38,825 --> 01:09:41,024
Hurry.

1831
01:09:41,325 --> 01:09:43,764
- It hurts. - Hurry.

1832
01:09:44,024 --> 01:09:45,493
(They succeed in posing.)

1833
01:09:45,495 --> 01:09:46,694
This hand.

1834
01:09:47,264 --> 01:09:48,865
A giant star pose.

1835
01:09:49,564 --> 01:09:50,763
One person.

1836
01:09:50,764 --> 01:09:52,665
- Shouldn't I be at the back? - No.

1837
01:09:53,304 --> 01:09:54,473
- It's working, right? - Like this.

1838
01:09:54,474 --> 01:09:55,535
This hand.

1839
01:09:56,035 --> 01:09:57,174
It worked.

1840
01:09:57,644 --> 01:09:59,075
- Isn't it done? - I think it's done.

1841
01:10:01,615 --> 01:10:02,814
One person.

1842
01:10:03,075 --> 01:10:05,684
Eight, seven, six,

1843
01:10:05,884 --> 01:10:06,954
- five, - I think I might throw up.

1844
01:10:06,955 --> 01:10:08,484
- four, three. - A heart with your hand.

1845
01:10:08,485 --> 01:10:10,024
- two, one. - A V at the bottom.

1846
01:10:10,955 --> 01:10:13,494
Team "Merry-Go-Round" gets 100 points.

1847
01:10:13,495 --> 01:10:14,795
Stay still.

1848
01:10:15,495 --> 01:10:17,763
The first sports day of PROJECT 7.

1849
01:10:17,764 --> 01:10:21,164
We completed five projects in total.

1850
01:10:21,165 --> 01:10:22,564
Let's all clap.

1851
01:10:22,795 --> 01:10:24,334
(Well done.)

1852
01:10:24,335 --> 01:10:25,705
- Well done. - It was fun.

1853
01:10:25,964 --> 01:10:28,174
Before announcing the team that won,

1854
01:10:28,604 --> 01:10:32,474
I should tell you what benefit the winning team will get.

1855
01:10:33,245 --> 01:10:34,375
Snacks?

1856
01:10:37,615 --> 01:10:39,314
I think it'll be the performing order.

1857
01:10:40,085 --> 01:10:41,354
It wouldn't be the order.

1858
01:10:43,224 --> 01:10:46,154
The winning team gets a special bonus...

1859
01:10:46,155 --> 01:10:48,654
of filming a promotion video for PROJECT 7...

1860
01:10:48,655 --> 01:10:51,224
which will be uploaded in the official account.

1861
01:10:51,625 --> 01:10:53,894
(Exclaiming)

1862
01:10:54,035 --> 01:10:55,894
- The reactions are a bit slow. - I envy them.

1863
01:10:55,934 --> 01:10:58,505
- There is one more. - One more.

1864
01:10:59,264 --> 01:11:02,875
With the original match song of the winning team,

1865
01:11:03,375 --> 01:11:05,244
you will record a challenge with me.

1866
01:11:05,245 --> 01:11:09,274
(A challenge with MC Dong Pyo)

1867
01:11:09,745 --> 01:11:12,784
(Amazing!)

1868
01:11:12,785 --> 01:11:14,485
- This is nice. - Right.

1869
01:11:16,625 --> 01:11:19,085
The team that won today...

1870
01:11:19,854 --> 01:11:23,223
(Drum rolls)

1871
01:11:23,224 --> 01:11:26,364
The winning team scored 410 points.

1872
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:27,794
It's Team "Merry-Go-Round."

1873
01:11:27,795 --> 01:11:29,094
Congratulations.

1874
01:11:29,835 --> 01:11:32,463
It's Team "Merry-Go-Round." Congratulations.

1875
01:11:32,464 --> 01:11:33,535
Okay.

1876
01:11:34,735 --> 01:11:35,774
We did well.

1877
01:11:38,804 --> 01:11:40,115
You guys can take it. We admit defeat.

1878
01:11:40,774 --> 01:11:42,774
(We admit defeat.)

1879
01:11:43,415 --> 01:11:46,144
I think we won with the young spirits.

1880
01:11:46,344 --> 01:11:47,415
Thank you.

1881
01:11:48,014 --> 01:11:49,254
- All right. - Congratulations.

1882
01:11:49,255 --> 01:11:52,954
Team "Merry-Go-Round," you won with their young spirits.

1883
01:11:52,955 --> 01:11:54,955
I sincerely congratulate you.

1884
01:11:55,325 --> 01:11:57,023
I hope...

1885
01:11:57,024 --> 01:11:59,463
you guys had a therapeutic time.

1886
01:11:59,464 --> 01:12:02,535
I, MC Dong Pyo, will take my leave.

1887
01:12:02,695 --> 01:12:05,165
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1888
01:12:05,505 --> 01:12:06,973
- Thank you. - I had fun.

1889
01:12:06,974 --> 01:12:08,273
- Thank you. - Thank you for your hard work.

1890
01:12:08,274 --> 01:12:09,574
(PROJECT 7's 1st sports day comes to an end.)

1891
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:10,905
Thank you for your hard work.

1892
01:12:12,945 --> 01:12:15,814
(It's time to go back to the training room.)

1893
01:12:16,144 --> 01:12:17,714
Doesn't the outfit make you smile?

1894
01:12:18,384 --> 01:12:19,444
How cute.

1895
01:12:19,445 --> 01:12:20,455
(The training room of Team "Merry-Go-Round")

1896
01:12:22,054 --> 01:12:23,584
(They're dressed in the pink training clothes.)

1897
01:12:23,585 --> 01:12:25,684
- My goodness. - "Merry-Go..."

1898
01:12:26,184 --> 01:12:28,155
Our pink outfits look pretty.

1899
01:12:28,795 --> 01:12:29,994
Look in the mirror.

1900
01:12:29,995 --> 01:12:31,664
(Looking in the mirror makes them laugh.)

1901
01:12:31,665 --> 01:12:33,535
Looking in the mirror made me laugh.

1902
01:12:33,894 --> 01:12:36,904
We looked like kindergarteners in athletic clothes.

1903
01:12:36,905 --> 01:12:38,064
It was cute.

1904
01:12:38,964 --> 01:12:40,773
Everyone, look forward to it.

1905
01:12:40,774 --> 01:12:42,035
Okay.

1906
01:12:42,505 --> 01:12:44,343
(It's time to enjoy the choreography of the new song.)

1907
01:12:44,344 --> 01:12:45,705
It's so refreshing.

1908
01:12:46,575 --> 01:12:47,844
The song is insane.

1909
01:12:48,415 --> 01:12:51,314
Both the song and dance were really nice.

1910
01:12:51,615 --> 01:12:53,754
It was a dream to have...

1911
01:12:53,755 --> 01:12:55,854
our own song.

1912
01:12:57,384 --> 01:12:58,455
I want that part.

1913
01:13:00,695 --> 01:13:02,394
The choreography...

1914
01:13:02,755 --> 01:13:04,424
- It's nice. - It's incredible.

1915
01:13:05,224 --> 01:13:07,835
(A refreshing performance)

1916
01:13:08,434 --> 01:13:10,104
Even at the first listen,

1917
01:13:10,505 --> 01:13:12,933
it suits us in pink.

1918
01:13:12,934 --> 01:13:14,103
Seriously.

1919
01:13:14,104 --> 01:13:16,004
- I love it. - You love it.

1920
01:13:16,005 --> 01:13:17,205
I'll work hard.

1921
01:13:17,804 --> 01:13:20,575
The song really suited...

1922
01:13:20,745 --> 01:13:22,075
my vibe.

1923
01:13:22,875 --> 01:13:24,115
If we do well,

1924
01:13:24,545 --> 01:13:26,245
we'll be able to place first.

1925
01:13:27,554 --> 01:13:29,085
That's what I think too.

1926
01:13:29,455 --> 01:13:31,524
We're confident.

1927
01:13:32,054 --> 01:13:35,195
Four out of top seven members are in the team.

1928
01:13:35,354 --> 01:13:37,724
All the members have a refreshing vibe.

1929
01:13:37,795 --> 01:13:39,423
The song is cute,

1930
01:13:39,424 --> 01:13:42,134
and we have the epitome of cuteness, KENSHIN.

1931
01:13:44,235 --> 01:13:46,705
I think the seven of us are perfect.

1932
01:13:47,104 --> 01:13:48,405
Now,

1933
01:13:48,575 --> 01:13:50,603
it's time to pick the leader.

1934
01:13:50,604 --> 01:13:52,804
- Does anyone want to volunteer? - Volunteer?

1935
01:13:53,075 --> 01:13:55,245
(Let's study the members who make up the team.)

1936
01:13:55,714 --> 01:13:58,084
I was always the youngest member of the team...

1937
01:13:58,085 --> 01:14:00,284
who received help from the older members.

1938
01:14:00,285 --> 01:14:02,615
(The older members adored him.)

1939
01:14:03,424 --> 01:14:05,383
(But this is a team with 4 members who were born in 2007.)

1940
01:14:05,384 --> 01:14:07,394
There were 4 members who were born in 2007.

1941
01:14:07,554 --> 01:14:09,995
The oldest one was NAM JIWOON...

1942
01:14:10,094 --> 01:14:11,325
who was born in 2002.

1943
01:14:11,924 --> 01:14:14,235
It was my first time becoming the oldest member.

1944
01:14:14,495 --> 01:14:16,034
It felt strange.

1945
01:14:16,035 --> 01:14:17,134
(The 2nd oldest one was born in 2005 in the team of young boys.)

1946
01:14:17,535 --> 01:14:20,374
Being the leader has nothing to do with age.

1947
01:14:20,375 --> 01:14:23,944
- That's right. I agree. - In the past,

1948
01:14:23,945 --> 01:14:28,213
the oldest member took on the leader position.

1949
01:14:28,214 --> 01:14:30,115
I think it should be different this time.

1950
01:14:30,545 --> 01:14:32,714
You want someone young to be the leader.

1951
01:14:34,455 --> 01:14:35,514
I...

1952
01:14:36,724 --> 01:14:38,054
recommend SEYUN.

1953
01:14:38,655 --> 01:14:41,093
In my opinion,

1954
01:14:41,094 --> 01:14:44,264
he has the best skills.

1955
01:14:44,825 --> 01:14:48,165
SEYUN is also good at helping out the others.

1956
01:14:48,495 --> 01:14:50,934
- You said the age didn't matter. - That's right.

1957
01:14:51,464 --> 01:14:53,133
Who will be the leader...

1958
01:14:53,134 --> 01:14:55,404
- of Team "Merry-Go-Round?" - Who will be the leader?

1959
01:14:55,405 --> 01:14:56,633
JUNG SEYUN.

1960
01:14:56,634 --> 01:14:58,173
(Team Young Boys gets a young boss.)

1961
01:14:58,174 --> 01:15:00,314
- JUNG SEYUN. - JUNG SEYUN.

1962
01:15:00,745 --> 01:15:03,245
I was nervous since I had no experience of being the leader.

1963
01:15:03,274 --> 01:15:04,844
- We're in your care. - Yes.

1964
01:15:06,585 --> 01:15:08,053
Isn't it your first time being the leader?

1965
01:15:08,054 --> 01:15:10,825
I always stole the armband from the older members.

1966
01:15:11,955 --> 01:15:14,154
He has had the desire to be the leader...

1967
01:15:14,155 --> 01:15:16,394
- for a while. - It isn't like that.

1968
01:15:16,924 --> 01:15:20,024
I'll make sure our team takes first place. We can do it.

1969
01:15:20,365 --> 01:15:21,434
Let's go.

1970
01:15:21,695 --> 01:15:22,934
Let's go.

1971
01:15:23,464 --> 01:15:26,434
In any case, my friend believed in me and recommended me.

1972
01:15:26,464 --> 01:15:28,973
I'll believe in my friend and do well...

1973
01:15:28,974 --> 01:15:30,103
so that SEUNGHO can say,

1974
01:15:30,104 --> 01:15:31,504
"We have it so easy..."

1975
01:15:31,505 --> 01:15:32,804
"thanks to SEYUN."

1976
01:15:33,245 --> 01:15:37,213
The decision went against the stereotype.

1977
01:15:37,214 --> 01:15:40,514
The rookies will revolt.

1978
01:15:41,155 --> 01:15:42,985
Do it like this. Go straight.

1979
01:15:43,155 --> 01:15:45,223
- Shall we do it cutely? - Yes.

1980
01:15:45,224 --> 01:15:46,724
- Pull it up. Yes. - Pull it up.

1981
01:15:46,825 --> 01:15:48,455
SUNGMIN, that's good. Everyone is doing well.

1982
01:15:48,755 --> 01:15:51,524
It drives me crazy

1983
01:15:52,094 --> 01:15:53,325
JIWOON, that was great.

1984
01:15:53,594 --> 01:15:54,964
Thank you.

1985
01:15:55,634 --> 01:15:59,303
We're staying close and practicing in a fun way.

1986
01:15:59,304 --> 01:16:00,304
I think it's nice.

1987
01:16:00,305 --> 01:16:01,604
Like it, like it

1988
01:16:03,604 --> 01:16:06,045
I don't think our spirits will die down.

1989
01:16:06,375 --> 01:16:08,114
Since we're young,

1990
01:16:08,115 --> 01:16:10,314
we have more energy than the older members.

1991
01:16:11,445 --> 01:16:13,045
Why is this team so dazzling?

1992
01:16:14,415 --> 01:16:15,514
It's very bright.

1993
01:16:15,814 --> 01:16:17,184
It's dark in our room.

1994
01:16:17,625 --> 01:16:19,484
When I practiced with the older members,

1995
01:16:19,485 --> 01:16:21,825
I saw them struggle in the middle of the dance.

1996
01:16:21,894 --> 01:16:24,564
But my current teammates keep on dancing happily.

1997
01:16:25,024 --> 01:16:27,464
Seeing that gives me energy.

1998
01:16:27,964 --> 01:16:29,564
We look so cute.

1999
01:16:30,094 --> 01:16:31,835
Can't we try it with the hoods pulled up?

2000
01:16:32,165 --> 01:16:33,205
Shall we do that?

2001
01:16:33,804 --> 01:16:34,973
(They pull up their hoods.)

2002
01:16:34,974 --> 01:16:36,405
Let's try it with the hoods pulled up.

2003
01:16:37,174 --> 01:16:39,945
(The training room turns into a playroom.)

2004
01:16:39,974 --> 01:16:41,115
Let's go.

2005
01:16:47,054 --> 01:16:50,085
Team "Merry-Go-Round" members are so close.

2006
01:16:50,384 --> 01:16:52,883
But dividing up the parts will lead to a war tomorrow.

2007
01:16:52,884 --> 01:16:53,924
- Why? - Watch and see.

2008
01:16:54,524 --> 01:16:55,754
(There's one obstacle this team faces.)

2009
01:16:55,755 --> 01:16:57,195
How do you do that while dancing?

2010
01:17:00,995 --> 01:17:03,364
(There isn't a main vocalist who can hit high notes.)

2011
01:17:03,365 --> 01:17:04,464
Will you be able to do it?

2012
01:17:05,604 --> 01:17:07,173
The main vocalist has so many parts.

2013
01:17:07,174 --> 01:17:08,304
This is the main vocalist's part too.

2014
01:17:09,304 --> 01:17:11,245
Is there anyone who can do that?

2015
01:17:11,375 --> 01:17:13,674
I'm afraid there isn't anyone who can be the main vocalist.

2016
01:17:13,875 --> 01:17:16,575
To be honest, I thought to myself,

2017
01:17:16,714 --> 01:17:18,014
"We're in trouble."

2018
01:17:18,245 --> 01:17:21,154
Let's start with the main vocalist.

2019
01:17:21,155 --> 01:17:22,213
(Distributing the main vocalist's parts)

2020
01:17:22,214 --> 01:17:23,285
(Avoiding eye contact)

2021
01:17:23,985 --> 01:17:25,524
Does anyone want to do it?

2022
01:17:26,924 --> 01:17:28,795
Radio silence.

2023
01:17:29,455 --> 01:17:30,995
Since we're a team,

2024
01:17:31,894 --> 01:17:33,633
let's look for a way.

2025
01:17:33,634 --> 01:17:35,235
The key is too high.

2026
01:17:35,564 --> 01:17:37,405
If you stay

2027
01:17:37,934 --> 01:17:39,534
By your side

2028
01:17:39,535 --> 01:17:40,773
(It's too much.)

2029
01:17:40,774 --> 01:17:42,404
Everything

2030
01:17:42,405 --> 01:17:44,205
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

2031
01:17:44,344 --> 01:17:47,513
The main vocalist wasn't something we wanted to do.

2032
01:17:47,514 --> 01:17:50,814
It became a burden someone had to take.

2033
01:17:51,684 --> 01:17:55,415
You show me a smile

2034
01:17:56,115 --> 01:17:57,255
It was nice.

2035
01:17:57,884 --> 01:17:59,785
(He can pull it off as well.)

2036
01:18:00,995 --> 01:18:02,553
I thought...

2037
01:18:02,554 --> 01:18:05,593
JIWOON's vocals were prettier.

2038
01:18:05,594 --> 01:18:07,295
My choice is JIWOON too.

2039
01:18:08,764 --> 01:18:11,665
I became the main vocalist.

2040
01:18:12,604 --> 01:18:13,604
(Sighing)

2041
01:18:13,905 --> 01:18:15,604
(He can only sigh.)

2042
01:18:15,875 --> 01:18:17,505
Who wants to be...

2043
01:18:18,245 --> 01:18:19,245
the lead vocalist two?

2044
01:18:19,246 --> 01:18:20,545
It's impossible.

2045
01:18:20,915 --> 01:18:23,473
(The position has a charming opening,)

2046
01:18:23,474 --> 01:18:26,245
(but it requires an ability to hit high notes.)

2047
01:18:26,785 --> 01:18:28,383
Lead vocalist 2 has higher notes than lead vocalist 1.

2048
01:18:28,384 --> 01:18:29,984
- Yes. - Really?

2049
01:18:29,985 --> 01:18:31,655
Yes. I told you so.

2050
01:18:31,724 --> 01:18:35,795
The last song I performed last time had a high range.

2051
01:18:36,325 --> 01:18:40,335
(He had no choice but to sing high notes.)

2052
01:18:40,695 --> 01:18:44,504
It's possible that people thought, "Why did he take on a part..."

2053
01:18:44,505 --> 01:18:48,335
"with a range he couldn't pull off and ruin the team?"

2054
01:18:48,505 --> 01:18:53,404
So I wanted to take a part with an easier range this time.

2055
01:18:53,405 --> 01:18:54,474
I want...

2056
01:18:55,545 --> 01:18:57,884
SUNGMIN to take the position of lead vocalist two.

2057
01:18:58,245 --> 01:19:00,554
We were giving him the burden,

2058
01:19:01,314 --> 01:19:03,314
so we felt very bad.

2059
01:19:03,755 --> 01:19:06,455
But it was impossible for someone else to do it...

2060
01:19:06,884 --> 01:19:10,054
because other people's voices simply didn't go up that high.

2061
01:19:11,764 --> 01:19:15,964
(KENSHIN looks at the music sheet without a word.)

2062
01:19:16,165 --> 01:19:18,204
Who wants to be rapper one?

2063
01:19:18,205 --> 01:19:19,835
(Distributing the rappers' parts)

2064
01:19:19,905 --> 01:19:21,835
- Yes. - Rapper one.

2065
01:19:22,005 --> 01:19:23,104
- KENSHIN. - One, two.

2066
01:19:24,045 --> 01:19:25,674
I think we should listen to both of them.

2067
01:19:25,875 --> 01:19:27,115
Did you memorize the lyrics?

2068
01:19:27,644 --> 01:19:28,773
Not yet.

2069
01:19:28,774 --> 01:19:31,044
You want it, the heat of uncertainty

2070
01:19:31,045 --> 01:19:32,485
Run

2071
01:19:32,644 --> 01:19:35,714
- He needs time to practice. - I go around

2072
01:19:35,955 --> 01:19:37,584
You want it, the heat of uncertainty

2073
01:19:37,585 --> 01:19:40,155
Run and go around the city

2074
01:19:40,424 --> 01:19:41,854
- All right. - It was different.

2075
01:19:42,325 --> 01:19:43,923
I personally think...

2076
01:19:43,924 --> 01:19:45,864
SEUNGHO should take the position of rapper one.

2077
01:19:45,865 --> 01:19:46,994
I agree.

2078
01:19:46,995 --> 01:19:49,235
- Would it be okay? - Yes.

2079
01:19:49,934 --> 01:19:53,165
(Sub vocalists 1 and 2 and rapper 2 remain.)

2080
01:19:53,365 --> 01:19:54,974
Rapper two has such a few parts.

2081
01:19:55,505 --> 01:19:57,944
- That's right. - There are just some double parts.

2082
01:19:57,945 --> 01:19:59,505
One, two, three.

2083
01:20:00,474 --> 01:20:01,575
As for me,

2084
01:20:02,575 --> 01:20:04,644
I can take any 1 of the 3 positions.

2085
01:20:05,115 --> 01:20:06,183
- Really? - Yes.

2086
01:20:06,184 --> 01:20:08,513
SEYUN is okay with taking...

2087
01:20:08,514 --> 01:20:09,553
any 1 of the 3 positions.

2088
01:20:09,554 --> 01:20:10,825
- Really? - Yes.

2089
01:20:11,485 --> 01:20:12,884
Still...

2090
01:20:13,085 --> 01:20:16,155
It looked like KENSHIN had a position in mind.

2091
01:20:16,495 --> 01:20:19,695
I wanted to help the team.

2092
01:20:20,394 --> 01:20:22,433
If you can do the part better, taking it will be good...

2093
01:20:22,434 --> 01:20:23,495
for the team.

2094
01:20:25,464 --> 01:20:28,174
I like rapper two's parts pretty well.

2095
01:20:29,005 --> 01:20:30,174
- Really? - Yes.

2096
01:20:30,405 --> 01:20:31,674
I'm okay...

2097
01:20:32,205 --> 01:20:33,474
with being rapper two.

2098
01:20:34,014 --> 01:20:35,974
- It's a good position. - Okay.

2099
01:20:36,344 --> 01:20:38,415
But are you okay with having only a few parts?

2100
01:20:38,884 --> 01:20:41,684
If you teach me, I can do well.

2101
01:20:41,714 --> 01:20:42,984
- Please teach me. - Okay.

2102
01:20:42,985 --> 01:20:44,125
KENSHIN will be rapper two.

2103
01:20:44,585 --> 01:20:46,553
KYOUNGBAE is sub vocalist 1 and SEYUN is sub vocalist 2.

2104
01:20:46,554 --> 01:20:47,755
- Yes. Let's do that. - Yes.

2105
01:20:48,094 --> 01:20:49,094
Okay.

2106
01:20:49,095 --> 01:20:50,524
- Okay. - Yes.

2107
01:20:50,665 --> 01:20:53,325
Although my position is rapper two,

2108
01:20:53,365 --> 01:20:56,235
I want to practice...

2109
01:20:57,304 --> 01:20:59,064
hard.

2110
01:20:59,705 --> 01:21:01,074
Shall we sing the first verse?

2111
01:21:01,075 --> 01:21:02,274
- Okay. - Shall we do that?

2112
01:21:05,545 --> 01:21:08,514
(It isn't easy.)

2113
01:21:08,814 --> 01:21:12,045
Everything, merry-go-around

2114
01:21:12,214 --> 01:21:14,314
Back by my side again

2115
01:21:15,054 --> 01:21:17,013
There were so many parts...

2116
01:21:17,014 --> 01:21:19,724
and the notes were quite high.

2117
01:21:20,625 --> 01:21:22,255
I felt so pressured.

2118
01:21:22,924 --> 01:21:25,424
Shall we learn the dance first?

2119
01:21:26,165 --> 01:21:27,433
Let's hurry up and do it.

2120
01:21:27,434 --> 01:21:29,094
(Despite the worries, they begin with the dance.)

2121
01:21:29,335 --> 01:21:31,365
Let's finish the first verse...

2122
01:21:31,464 --> 01:21:34,704
as well as the details. That will be the goal of the day.

2123
01:21:34,705 --> 01:21:36,633
- Okay. - In any case, we need...

2124
01:21:36,634 --> 01:21:38,803
- to practice the vocals too. - That's right.

2125
01:21:38,804 --> 01:21:40,615
Let's use our time wisely.

2126
01:21:40,915 --> 01:21:43,314
The hand gesture is the same. It's this.

2127
01:21:43,714 --> 01:21:46,244
But some will sit...

2128
01:21:46,245 --> 01:21:47,353
while others will stand.

2129
01:21:47,354 --> 01:21:49,183
Just teach us the moves.

2130
01:21:49,184 --> 01:21:51,184
- Let's get back to it later. - Yes. Do it later.

2131
01:21:53,384 --> 01:21:55,353
- Click. - Do it slowly.

2132
01:21:55,354 --> 01:21:57,125
- Seven, eight. - Eight.

2133
01:21:57,625 --> 01:21:59,764
I feel a bit annoyed when you guys get this part wrong.

2134
01:22:00,795 --> 01:22:03,695
JIWOON's mind was...

2135
01:22:04,165 --> 01:22:07,174
on the high notes,

2136
01:22:07,205 --> 01:22:09,374
so the atmosphere was a bit down.

2137
01:22:09,375 --> 01:22:10,604
(Glancing over)

2138
01:22:11,375 --> 01:22:12,444
I'm 1.5.

2139
01:22:12,445 --> 01:22:14,274
Hey, I'm 1.5.

2140
01:22:15,774 --> 01:22:17,713
I was asking.

2141
01:22:17,714 --> 01:22:19,744
Should I stand right behind you guys?

2142
01:22:19,745 --> 01:22:21,014
That was when I thought,

2143
01:22:21,615 --> 01:22:23,654
"Everyone is a bit sensitive right now."

2144
01:22:23,655 --> 01:22:26,125
I'm the second-oldest member of the team,

2145
01:22:26,255 --> 01:22:28,594
so I'm worried about the atmosphere.

2146
01:22:29,295 --> 01:22:31,694
- Let's learn the formation first. - It's a bit...

2147
01:22:31,695 --> 01:22:33,195
- Okay. - Let's skip the details.

2148
01:22:33,495 --> 01:22:34,764
We don't have time.

2149
01:22:34,894 --> 01:22:37,094
Singing was our biggest issue.

2150
01:22:37,205 --> 01:22:39,434
Without even singing once,

2151
01:22:39,505 --> 01:22:41,374
we were taking too much time with the dance.

2152
01:22:41,375 --> 01:22:43,474
It was a frustrating situation,

2153
01:22:43,674 --> 01:22:46,774
so I became a bit sensitive.

2154
01:22:47,245 --> 01:22:50,014
(Even during the dance practice,)

2155
01:22:50,985 --> 01:22:54,554
(his mind is on the high notes.)

2156
01:22:56,115 --> 01:23:00,795
(He can't help but practice the vocals during the break.)

2157
01:23:02,655 --> 01:23:05,263
- SEUNGHO. - Let's learn the details later.

2158
01:23:05,264 --> 01:23:07,165
Let's work on the formation first.

2159
01:23:07,434 --> 01:23:10,564
I was wary since he was very sensitive.

2160
01:23:11,264 --> 01:23:14,575
From here, we'll move and...

2161
01:23:16,134 --> 01:23:18,174
- Let me see it. - After this...

2162
01:23:18,644 --> 01:23:20,875
It looked like he was lacking confidence.

2163
01:23:21,575 --> 01:23:23,713
Let's practice the details separately...

2164
01:23:23,714 --> 01:23:26,013
and meet up again after 20 minutes.

2165
01:23:26,014 --> 01:23:28,053
I wanted SEYUN to lead the team,

2166
01:23:28,054 --> 01:23:30,923
but other team members were telling him what to do...

2167
01:23:30,924 --> 01:23:33,054
- and dragging him along. - Afterward...

2168
01:23:34,394 --> 01:23:35,455
Hey.

2169
01:23:35,495 --> 01:23:36,625
Let's practice separately now.

2170
01:23:36,894 --> 01:23:40,865
I kept listening to the team members' opinions.

2171
01:23:40,964 --> 01:23:42,094
Move.

2172
01:23:43,064 --> 01:23:44,335
- What? - You move to the back.

2173
01:23:45,205 --> 01:23:47,634
Hold on. Where is my sheet?

2174
01:23:47,974 --> 01:23:50,844
Doesn't it go like this?

2175
01:23:51,445 --> 01:23:52,974
You need to turn this way. I'm sorry.

2176
01:23:54,014 --> 01:23:56,713
It was my first time to lead a group.

2177
01:23:56,714 --> 01:24:00,513
I didn't know how to teach the dance.

2178
01:24:00,514 --> 01:24:02,155
I was a bit stuck.

2179
01:24:02,285 --> 01:24:03,883
SEYUN should cover.

2180
01:24:03,884 --> 01:24:04,955
(Peeking)

2181
01:24:05,424 --> 01:24:08,155
I think I'm doing a bad job at being the leader.

2182
01:24:08,295 --> 01:24:09,495
- Cover. - Okay.

2183
01:24:09,554 --> 01:24:13,294
So I can't help but be wary.

2184
01:24:13,295 --> 01:24:14,335
(Young Boss looks at the tablet PC warily.)

2185
01:24:14,665 --> 01:24:16,664
All right.

2186
01:24:16,665 --> 01:24:17,834
- Slow down. - Slow down.

2187
01:24:17,835 --> 01:24:19,365
(It's a mess.)

2188
01:24:20,705 --> 01:24:21,804
We're in trouble.

2189
01:24:22,405 --> 01:24:25,274
Focus. We can do it.

2190
01:24:26,174 --> 01:24:27,875
I'll take responsibility and get scolded...

2191
01:24:28,575 --> 01:24:30,245
- during the interim evaluation. - Everyone should do that.

2192
01:24:30,575 --> 01:24:32,785
- What? - Don't think about getting scolded.

2193
01:24:34,455 --> 01:24:39,354
(Despite the lack of confidence, he has a sense of responsibility.)

2194
01:24:41,424 --> 01:24:43,125
I taught them wrong.

2195
01:24:47,064 --> 01:24:48,795
(My goodness)

2196
01:24:58,344 --> 01:25:02,245
Now, I want to stop being the leader...

2197
01:25:02,644 --> 01:25:05,184
because I'm not doing a good job.

2198
01:25:05,384 --> 01:25:06,785
It's so hard.

2199
01:25:07,314 --> 01:25:08,384
To be honest,

2200
01:25:09,384 --> 01:25:12,024
I want to give up...

2201
01:25:13,684 --> 01:25:14,854
on everything.

2202
01:25:16,655 --> 01:25:18,264
It isn't Team "Merry-Go-Round."

2203
01:25:19,764 --> 01:25:22,535
It's Team Going Round.

2204
01:25:22,735 --> 01:25:24,304
We keep going in circles.

2205
01:25:27,165 --> 01:25:30,804
(This trainee also has a lot of worries.)

2206
01:25:31,075 --> 01:25:36,273
The practice was going slowly,

2207
01:25:36,274 --> 01:25:37,945
so I was quite anxious.

2208
01:25:38,585 --> 01:25:43,584
I didn't have many parts for "Merry-Go-Round,"

2209
01:25:43,585 --> 01:25:46,523
so I practiced the dance diligently...

2210
01:25:46,524 --> 01:25:49,295
and put a lot of effort into perfecting my expressions.

2211
01:25:53,524 --> 01:25:54,964
Gosh, is he practicing alone?

2212
01:25:57,434 --> 01:25:58,835
KENSHIN.

2213
01:25:59,835 --> 01:26:02,604
- I heard that you had many worries. - What?

2214
01:26:03,274 --> 01:26:05,445
What's wrong? Are you relieving your stress by practicing?

2215
01:26:06,474 --> 01:26:08,713
- Do you have any worries? - Well...

2216
01:26:08,714 --> 01:26:10,474
- Just a bit. - I see.

2217
01:26:11,615 --> 01:26:15,485
My position is rapper two.

2218
01:26:15,615 --> 01:26:17,585
- Rapper 2. - Rapper 2 has...

2219
01:26:18,655 --> 01:26:20,125
such a few parts.

2220
01:26:20,894 --> 01:26:22,724
"One, two, three." This and...

2221
01:26:25,594 --> 01:26:26,625
That.

2222
01:26:26,764 --> 01:26:28,495
- Just two? - Yes.

2223
01:26:29,495 --> 01:26:32,865
("Merry-Go-Round" has been his number one choice.)

2224
01:26:33,104 --> 01:26:34,575
My vibe suits...

2225
01:26:35,634 --> 01:26:37,335
"Merry-Go-Round" very much.

2226
01:26:38,304 --> 01:26:39,945
It suits "Merry-Go-Round" very much.

2227
01:26:40,104 --> 01:26:42,744
I have a cute face.

2228
01:26:42,745 --> 01:26:45,384
I want to show my smile.

2229
01:26:46,485 --> 01:26:48,214
But I only have a few parts.

2230
01:26:48,884 --> 01:26:51,325
My parts put me in the back...

2231
01:26:51,424 --> 01:26:53,155
One, two, three

2232
01:26:53,585 --> 01:26:55,955
And the sides.

2233
01:26:56,255 --> 01:26:59,464
So I want to get good reviews...

2234
01:27:00,094 --> 01:27:03,434
when we have an evaluation tomorrow.

2235
01:27:04,604 --> 01:27:06,604
That's why I'm practicing.

2236
01:27:09,835 --> 01:27:13,473
If I practice harder, I'll be able to do it.

2237
01:27:13,474 --> 01:27:15,713
(He practices alone in the dormitory until late.)

2238
01:27:15,714 --> 01:27:17,014
I'll be able to do well.

2239
01:27:19,514 --> 01:27:20,514
(Next day, the interim evaluation)

2240
01:27:20,515 --> 01:27:22,255
All right. Team Sausage is next. Let's go.

2241
01:27:22,854 --> 01:27:24,085
Let's go, sausages.

2242
01:27:25,054 --> 01:27:28,455
The members of the young generation came together.

2243
01:27:29,455 --> 01:27:30,724
The team is made up of the younger members.

2244
01:27:30,924 --> 01:27:32,494
I trust you guys to do well.

2245
01:27:32,495 --> 01:27:35,464
The combination was so refreshing that we came here...

2246
01:27:35,564 --> 01:27:38,304
with the expectations to see a fun performance.

2247
01:27:38,405 --> 01:27:39,405
Okay.

2248
01:28:03,024 --> 01:28:05,865
- SEYUN has incredible energy. - SEYUN is so cute.

2249
01:28:11,604 --> 01:28:12,865
SEUNGHO is doing well.

2250
01:28:17,134 --> 01:28:18,505
ANDY is really good.

2251
01:28:21,674 --> 01:28:22,974
His vocalization...

2252
01:28:28,485 --> 01:28:29,985
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2253
01:28:31,625 --> 01:28:33,254
There are some members who suit the song really well.

2254
01:28:33,255 --> 01:28:35,155
SEUNGHO, SEYUN,

2255
01:28:35,455 --> 01:28:38,094
and ANDY suit this song very well.

2256
01:28:38,125 --> 01:28:41,433
- Thank you. - I loved the dance and energy.

2257
01:28:41,434 --> 01:28:43,963
KENSHIN suits the song well too,

2258
01:28:43,964 --> 01:28:47,034
but SEUNGHO, SEYUN, and ANDY's energy is so high...

2259
01:28:47,035 --> 01:28:48,434
that he isn't very visible.

2260
01:28:48,535 --> 01:28:52,843
So think of those three as good rivals...

2261
01:28:52,844 --> 01:28:55,614
and copy what you need to copy.

2262
01:28:55,615 --> 01:28:57,513
I think the team should use KENSHIN well.

2263
01:28:57,514 --> 01:28:59,683
He isn't very visible.

2264
01:28:59,684 --> 01:29:00,714
Okay.

2265
01:29:01,314 --> 01:29:02,785
All right. Well done.

2266
01:29:02,884 --> 01:29:04,115
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2267
01:29:08,795 --> 01:29:10,054
Well done.

2268
01:29:10,695 --> 01:29:11,995
Yes. Well done.

2269
01:29:14,024 --> 01:29:16,593
- Right. - That isn't the problem.

2270
01:29:16,594 --> 01:29:19,104
You run out of breath.

2271
01:29:19,735 --> 01:29:21,974
This part is a problem as well, but...

2272
01:29:23,274 --> 01:29:25,205
- I want to use the restroom. - The restroom?

2273
01:29:25,344 --> 01:29:27,103
- Yes. - All right.

2274
01:29:27,104 --> 01:29:28,144
Thank you.

2275
01:29:32,115 --> 01:29:33,214
What's the matter?

2276
01:29:33,344 --> 01:29:37,085
Since I only had a few parts,

2277
01:29:38,155 --> 01:29:42,223
I wanted to dance diligently...

2278
01:29:42,224 --> 01:29:45,394
and receive good reviews.

2279
01:29:45,995 --> 01:29:48,763
When Bada said...

2280
01:29:48,764 --> 01:29:51,134
I couldn't be seen,

2281
01:29:52,035 --> 01:29:54,633
When Bada said I couldn't be seen,

2282
01:29:54,634 --> 01:29:56,335
it made me upset.

2283
01:29:58,005 --> 01:30:00,774
(He was the center in the title song.)

2284
01:30:01,245 --> 01:30:03,514
(He took the killing part during "3D.")

2285
01:30:04,014 --> 01:30:06,285
(He even showed a twist in "Jealousy.")

2286
01:30:07,144 --> 01:30:11,053
(He was able to finish the projects without any problems until now.)

2287
01:30:11,054 --> 01:30:13,723
I practiced really hard,

2288
01:30:13,724 --> 01:30:16,424
so I wanted to receive a better evaluation.

2289
01:30:16,455 --> 01:30:18,724
That's why it made me really sad.

2290
01:30:19,594 --> 01:30:23,295
(How will his first crisis end?)

2291
01:30:25,104 --> 01:30:26,933
(The training room of Team "Breaking News")

2292
01:30:26,934 --> 01:30:28,273
- Wait a second. - Are you ready?

2293
01:30:28,274 --> 01:30:29,504
- I'm so curious. - Let's go.

2294
01:30:29,505 --> 01:30:30,574
- Let's do it. - Let's do it.

2295
01:30:30,575 --> 01:30:33,604
(Watching the choreography video for "Breaking News")

2296
01:30:36,214 --> 01:30:37,344
(Impressed)

2297
01:30:43,485 --> 01:30:44,825
(Amazing)

2298
01:30:50,424 --> 01:30:52,495
It's finally here.

2299
01:30:52,724 --> 01:30:55,165
We can now do a performance which we'll have to do

2300
01:30:55,995 --> 01:30:58,604
(The dance break)

2301
01:31:00,735 --> 01:31:02,134
(Rolling his feet)

2302
01:31:05,905 --> 01:31:08,575
The dance...

2303
01:31:08,674 --> 01:31:10,875
is probably the best among the five teams.

2304
01:31:11,344 --> 01:31:12,713
It will leave a strong impact,

2305
01:31:12,714 --> 01:31:15,853
and Bada made a great killing point.

2306
01:31:15,854 --> 01:31:18,023
Director Ryan Sewon Jhun also created the song...

2307
01:31:18,024 --> 01:31:21,495
with such perfect balance of hard and soft points.

2308
01:31:21,695 --> 01:31:22,825
We might actually win this.

2309
01:31:23,255 --> 01:31:25,594
I felt like we could win first place with this song.

2310
01:31:31,064 --> 01:31:32,604
- It's completely hip-hop. - My gosh.

2311
01:31:33,764 --> 01:31:34,874
- It's just fully hip-hop. - It's insane.

2312
01:31:34,875 --> 01:31:35,934
It looks fun.

2313
01:31:36,075 --> 01:31:38,143
This song is...

2314
01:31:38,144 --> 01:31:39,874
going to be our song.

2315
01:31:39,875 --> 01:31:41,273
Now that I think about it, you're right.

2316
01:31:41,274 --> 01:31:43,973
We're about to be the owner of this song.

2317
01:31:43,974 --> 01:31:45,883
Thank you to all the World Assemblers...

2318
01:31:45,884 --> 01:31:47,114
who voted for us.

2319
01:31:47,115 --> 01:31:48,254
- Seriously. - Thank you so much.

2320
01:31:48,255 --> 01:31:50,484
When we first saw the choreography,

2321
01:31:50,485 --> 01:31:52,254
everyone got really excited.

2322
01:31:52,255 --> 01:31:54,625
We were able to start with energy.

2323
01:31:54,995 --> 01:31:57,824
Even if my dance isn't that great,

2324
01:31:57,825 --> 01:31:59,195
I wanted to make this mine.

2325
01:31:59,424 --> 01:32:01,695
I needed to make it happen even if I have to stay up all night.

2326
01:32:02,134 --> 01:32:03,795
We need to make sure to make the song stand out.

2327
01:32:03,835 --> 01:32:06,905
We really need to do our best in this.

2328
01:32:06,964 --> 01:32:09,133
This was the real breaking news.

2329
01:32:09,134 --> 01:32:10,374
This is the breaking news.

2330
01:32:10,375 --> 01:32:11,574
- It was real. - There was a hidden meaning.

2331
01:32:11,575 --> 01:32:12,674
Breaking news.

2332
01:32:13,474 --> 01:32:15,274
(Training room of Team "KOOL-AID")

2333
01:32:22,985 --> 01:32:24,085
Wait.

2334
01:32:24,384 --> 01:32:26,354
How did you feel when we got "KOOL-AID?"

2335
01:32:27,184 --> 01:32:28,825
I was a bit speechless.

2336
01:32:29,325 --> 01:32:30,454
- What do you mean? - For me,

2337
01:32:30,455 --> 01:32:32,164
I just really wanted to do "Merry-Go-Round."

2338
01:32:32,165 --> 01:32:33,995
I couldn't think of anything else but that I wanted "Merry-Go-Round."

2339
01:32:35,035 --> 01:32:38,204
This wasn't my first choice of song.

2340
01:32:38,205 --> 01:32:40,434
I only thought of performing "Breaking News."

2341
01:32:40,705 --> 01:32:42,335
That's what I've been listening to on my way here.

2342
01:32:43,035 --> 01:32:46,544
It wasn't only me, but none of the other teammates...

2343
01:32:46,545 --> 01:32:48,374
were hoping to get...

2344
01:32:48,375 --> 01:32:50,044
the song "KOOL-AID."

2345
01:32:50,045 --> 01:32:51,045
("Merry-Go-Round" and "Trigger")

2346
01:32:51,985 --> 01:32:54,785
(Playing the dance video first)

2347
01:33:03,125 --> 01:33:04,455
The dance is so difficult.

2348
01:33:07,125 --> 01:33:09,264
The songs I prefer...

2349
01:33:10,865 --> 01:33:13,235
are usually upbeat songs.

2350
01:33:13,764 --> 01:33:15,735
It's the kind of song...

2351
01:33:16,174 --> 01:33:18,304
where I can just have fun on stage.

2352
01:33:19,104 --> 01:33:23,614
The song "KOOL-AID" had to be danced rhythmically to get the vibe.

2353
01:33:23,615 --> 01:33:26,014
It wasn't easy, so I got worried.

2354
01:33:26,915 --> 01:33:28,854
The kind of song where I'm the most confident...

2355
01:33:29,354 --> 01:33:31,985
and which would make me stand out the most is...

2356
01:33:32,384 --> 01:33:33,524
a sexy concept.

2357
01:33:34,354 --> 01:33:35,924
I was hoping to perform "Trigger."

2358
01:33:37,655 --> 01:33:39,864
I have a hard time performing an adorable song,

2359
01:33:39,865 --> 01:33:41,464
so I wanted to avoid it.

2360
01:33:48,375 --> 01:33:51,174
- It's nice. - It's nice, but it's hard.

2361
01:33:51,974 --> 01:33:54,075
Not only is the dance hard, but the song is harder than I thought.

2362
01:33:55,144 --> 01:33:57,014
It looks so hard.

2363
01:33:57,274 --> 01:33:58,884
- It's harder than I thought. - Right.

2364
01:33:59,144 --> 01:34:00,414
Will it be okay?

2365
01:34:00,415 --> 01:34:01,813
I'm suddenly getting worried.

2366
01:34:01,814 --> 01:34:03,054
How will we perform this live?

2367
01:34:03,915 --> 01:34:05,324
We need to get used...

2368
01:34:05,325 --> 01:34:07,154
to the song as much as we can.

2369
01:34:07,155 --> 01:34:08,495
- Yes. - Sounds good.

2370
01:34:09,594 --> 01:34:13,764
(They start practicing while listening to the music.)

2371
01:34:20,434 --> 01:34:23,205
It's a bit all over the place.

2372
01:34:24,174 --> 01:34:25,245
Do you need help?

2373
01:34:25,774 --> 01:34:27,504
- I'm fine. - Are you okay?

2374
01:34:27,505 --> 01:34:28,773
(Awkward)

2375
01:34:28,774 --> 01:34:30,014
I wanted to learn the dance.

2376
01:34:31,684 --> 01:34:33,485
There was an awkward silence.

2377
01:34:34,144 --> 01:34:35,614
Frankly speaking,

2378
01:34:35,615 --> 01:34:38,424
I personally felt uncomfortable around my team.

2379
01:34:39,485 --> 01:34:41,053
- Can I use the tablet? - Yes.

2380
01:34:41,054 --> 01:34:42,195
Thank you.

2381
01:34:45,125 --> 01:34:48,695
I think we were walking on eggshells around each other.

2382
01:34:49,594 --> 01:34:52,464
Let's start from the beginning in 5, 6, 7, 8.

2383
01:34:52,604 --> 01:34:54,933
(They start their dance practice with KIM SIHUN's lead.)

2384
01:34:54,934 --> 01:34:55,934
Then move.

2385
01:34:55,935 --> 01:34:57,905
Sweet honey

2386
01:34:58,304 --> 01:34:59,974
Like that.

2387
01:35:01,075 --> 01:35:02,075
(Wait.)

2388
01:35:02,076 --> 01:35:03,244
Is this it?

2389
01:35:03,245 --> 01:35:04,375
Is that the right beat?

2390
01:35:08,255 --> 01:35:10,615
The hand is right here.

2391
01:35:19,894 --> 01:35:20,964
- Right. - Okay.

2392
01:35:21,365 --> 01:35:23,294
SIHUN's image used to be...

2393
01:35:23,295 --> 01:35:26,235
playful and outgoing.

2394
01:35:26,535 --> 01:35:28,104
Let's dance here.

2395
01:35:28,304 --> 01:35:30,633
But in this team,

2396
01:35:30,634 --> 01:35:33,104
he seemed gloomy as well.

2397
01:35:35,875 --> 01:35:37,714
I can't seem to get it in my head.

2398
01:35:39,045 --> 01:35:40,485
I can't memorize the steps.

2399
01:35:42,455 --> 01:35:44,285
It wasn't easy to start with.

2400
01:35:44,884 --> 01:35:45,884
Like this.

2401
01:35:46,255 --> 01:35:49,125
That's between lead, FONG,

2402
01:35:49,955 --> 01:35:51,893
- and GUNWOO. - I think it's the other way around.

2403
01:35:51,894 --> 01:35:53,295
Shouldn't we go this way here?

2404
01:35:54,495 --> 01:35:55,694
- We have to face this way. - Okay.

2405
01:35:55,695 --> 01:35:57,434
But that's the mirror mode.

2406
01:35:58,634 --> 01:36:00,905
- Is that so? Hold on. - Yes, it's the other way around.

2407
01:36:01,335 --> 01:36:03,173
- Do we have to start over? - We have to go this way.

2408
01:36:03,174 --> 01:36:04,304
What?

2409
01:36:04,875 --> 01:36:05,974
How is this...

2410
01:36:07,045 --> 01:36:09,415
- It's a mirror mode. - We should watch it from this side.

2411
01:36:09,674 --> 01:36:10,713
We need to see it from this direction.

2412
01:36:10,714 --> 01:36:12,843
- You're right. - But wait.

2413
01:36:12,844 --> 01:36:14,183
It was a mirror mode.

2414
01:36:14,184 --> 01:36:15,915
(They had been practicing in the other direction.)

2415
01:36:16,755 --> 01:36:19,024
There are too many movements.

2416
01:36:19,724 --> 01:36:22,195
Let's learn the dance together.

2417
01:36:22,594 --> 01:36:24,524
I think we wasted a lot of time there.

2418
01:36:25,064 --> 01:36:26,763
We weren't able to memorize the dance yet,

2419
01:36:26,764 --> 01:36:28,795
but we even have to learn the movements.

2420
01:36:30,394 --> 01:36:31,835
I'll explain the moves for each member.

2421
01:36:32,804 --> 01:36:34,304
Let's calm down.

2422
01:36:34,835 --> 01:36:37,234
It's really far, so start moving from this point.

2423
01:36:37,235 --> 01:36:39,504
- Okay. - As you do that,

2424
01:36:39,505 --> 01:36:41,644
you can start moving as you do this movement.

2425
01:36:41,814 --> 01:36:43,545
Come up to this point.

2426
01:36:43,875 --> 01:36:45,984
This is just my personal opinion,

2427
01:36:45,985 --> 01:36:48,683
but ever since we went to our rooms...

2428
01:36:48,684 --> 01:36:50,184
after receiving our song,

2429
01:36:50,455 --> 01:36:51,825
What do you call this combination?

2430
01:36:53,155 --> 01:36:56,424
He didn't seem that excited when he saw us.

2431
01:36:56,524 --> 01:36:58,463
He didn't seem that happy.

2432
01:36:58,464 --> 01:36:59,694
All right.

2433
01:36:59,695 --> 01:37:01,964
(Ranks 9, 22, 25, 31, 30, 32, 29)

2434
01:37:02,335 --> 01:37:04,394
Maybe it's because it wasn't the song he wanted...

2435
01:37:04,665 --> 01:37:08,174
or the members he wanted.

2436
01:37:08,705 --> 01:37:12,343
I'm sure he wanted to perform with the higher-ranking trainees.

2437
01:37:12,344 --> 01:37:14,304
We were just walking on eggshells...

2438
01:37:14,644 --> 01:37:15,945
around him.

2439
01:37:16,745 --> 01:37:20,744
I suppose they knew something was going on.

2440
01:37:20,745 --> 01:37:21,883
They must've been wondering...

2441
01:37:21,884 --> 01:37:24,554
why I was feeling down.

2442
01:37:25,854 --> 01:37:27,955
I was worried if we could perform this song well.

2443
01:37:28,695 --> 01:37:30,655
I'm kind of out of it right now.

2444
01:37:31,665 --> 01:37:32,665
(Their practice isn't going smoothly.)

2445
01:37:32,666 --> 01:37:36,394
Next is sub two.

2446
01:37:38,535 --> 01:37:40,263
- Are you okay? - I'm so exhausted.

2447
01:37:40,264 --> 01:37:41,603
- This part... - It seems like it.

2448
01:37:41,604 --> 01:37:42,674
It's the first time.

2449
01:37:42,774 --> 01:37:44,634
- I'm a bit disappointed. - Why?

2450
01:37:45,005 --> 01:37:46,905
I really wanted to team up with you.

2451
01:37:47,705 --> 01:37:48,914
You seemed really cheerful,

2452
01:37:48,915 --> 01:37:51,174
so I wanted to team up with you at least once.

2453
01:37:51,514 --> 01:37:52,884
But you seem so down now.

2454
01:37:53,514 --> 01:37:54,883
- Actually, - The rap...

2455
01:37:54,884 --> 01:37:58,184
it's the first time I don't feel confident about a song.

2456
01:37:58,724 --> 01:37:59,854
I know,

2457
01:38:00,485 --> 01:38:02,455
so I'm trying to brighten up the atmosphere as much as I can.

2458
01:38:03,255 --> 01:38:04,394
I'm worried.

2459
01:38:05,094 --> 01:38:07,295
I usually don't like this kind of atmosphere.

2460
01:38:08,564 --> 01:38:09,695
But he was gloomy.

2461
01:38:10,564 --> 01:38:12,865
I needed more practice right now.

2462
01:38:13,604 --> 01:38:14,804
Time was running out.

2463
01:38:15,375 --> 01:38:16,705
So I decided to learn...

2464
01:38:17,005 --> 01:38:18,445
the dance moves at the meantime.

2465
01:38:19,905 --> 01:38:21,945
I copied the moves at the fire exit.

2466
01:38:26,115 --> 01:38:28,115
(Even after that)

2467
01:38:28,285 --> 01:38:31,014
You can enter the formation while doing this move.

2468
01:38:34,755 --> 01:38:35,854
Let's wrap it up here.

2469
01:38:36,625 --> 01:38:39,295
- ATILLA, go further back. - Okay.

2470
01:38:39,495 --> 01:38:40,694
We have to move at the right time.

2471
01:38:40,695 --> 01:38:42,334
But because you move early,

2472
01:38:42,335 --> 01:38:43,634
your moves can't be seen.

2473
01:38:44,394 --> 01:38:48,335
(They repeat their practice with KIM JEONGMIN's lead.)

2474
01:38:48,434 --> 01:38:50,034
You have to move it inwards.

2475
01:38:50,035 --> 01:38:51,035
(Will their practice go smoothly?)

2476
01:38:51,036 --> 01:38:52,474
The center will go to the back.

2477
01:38:54,045 --> 01:38:55,673
(How's Team "Breaking News" doing?)

2478
01:38:55,674 --> 01:38:57,415
- Hey! - Let's go.

2479
01:38:57,714 --> 01:39:00,444
We need to tie something like this on the waist to look cool.

2480
01:39:00,445 --> 01:39:01,655
Director Bada said so.

2481
01:39:02,655 --> 01:39:05,184
(Their coolness has increased.)

2482
01:39:05,924 --> 01:39:09,155
If we're going to dance like Bada, we need to dress like her too.

2483
01:39:09,354 --> 01:39:12,325
All right.

2484
01:39:13,524 --> 01:39:15,393
It looked cool when other people did this.

2485
01:39:15,394 --> 01:39:16,865
But why doesn't it look cool on me?

2486
01:39:17,594 --> 01:39:19,835
- Dress like Bada to dance like her. - That's right.

2487
01:39:20,005 --> 01:39:22,535
In 5, 6, 7, 8.

2488
01:39:22,974 --> 01:39:26,245
(They practice with KANG HYUNWOO's lead.)

2489
01:39:26,274 --> 01:39:28,244
When we slide,

2490
01:39:28,245 --> 01:39:30,473
instead of going sideways,

2491
01:39:30,474 --> 01:39:33,445
I think we should drag it a little and make a big circle.

2492
01:39:33,514 --> 01:39:36,214
Drag it a little here, then move.

2493
01:39:36,415 --> 01:39:37,784
For our hand movement,

2494
01:39:37,785 --> 01:39:40,455
it's as if we were trying to tear something off.

2495
01:39:40,625 --> 01:39:42,624
Put your hand here and do this move.

2496
01:39:42,625 --> 01:39:44,353
We usually yell when we go to the mountains.

2497
01:39:44,354 --> 01:39:45,365
(Shouting)

2498
01:39:46,464 --> 01:39:47,825
That's right.

2499
01:39:47,865 --> 01:39:50,064
We're now talking about a different topic.

2500
01:39:50,165 --> 01:39:52,864
I had so much fun practicing.

2501
01:39:52,865 --> 01:39:54,004
The dance was so fun,

2502
01:39:54,005 --> 01:39:57,634
and it was the kind of performance I wanted to show.

2503
01:39:57,674 --> 01:40:00,673
I think our practice was fun.

2504
01:40:00,674 --> 01:40:02,214
You have to push it down.

2505
01:40:02,344 --> 01:40:03,374
It's this way.

2506
01:40:03,375 --> 01:40:05,784
I think I was able to practice...

2507
01:40:05,785 --> 01:40:07,814
without getting exhausted.

2508
01:40:08,045 --> 01:40:11,084
There was a positive and an energetic vibe...

2509
01:40:11,085 --> 01:40:14,024
that spread throughout our practice naturally.

2510
01:40:14,455 --> 01:40:15,924
During the welcome part,

2511
01:40:15,955 --> 01:40:17,824
we'll start moving at the word "welcome."

2512
01:40:17,825 --> 01:40:18,924
Here it is.

2513
01:40:19,094 --> 01:40:20,524
Do you mean we have to move while doing this move?

2514
01:40:21,865 --> 01:40:24,964
(Moving into formation while doing their move)

2515
01:40:25,064 --> 01:40:26,964
I'll have to make big steps while moving forward.

2516
01:40:29,134 --> 01:40:30,174
(He missed his timing.)

2517
01:40:30,905 --> 01:40:33,405
Wait a minute. Let's try that again.

2518
01:40:34,774 --> 01:40:36,114
Appearing.

2519
01:40:36,115 --> 01:40:37,314
YURA should move forward.

2520
01:40:38,545 --> 01:40:40,114
- Am I standing too far back? - No, YURA...

2521
01:40:40,115 --> 01:40:41,813
- YURA has to... - You should be in position 3 and 4.

2522
01:40:41,814 --> 01:40:44,054
- You should be... - You're right.

2523
01:40:44,655 --> 01:40:47,455
It was cool and impressive when we watched the video,

2524
01:40:48,155 --> 01:40:51,825
but when we did it ourselves, there were too many formations.

2525
01:40:51,894 --> 01:40:54,524
With these many formations,

2526
01:40:54,795 --> 01:40:56,495
the song should've ended by now.

2527
01:40:56,894 --> 01:40:59,804
(The dance formations for "Breaking News")

2528
01:40:59,905 --> 01:41:04,235
We have about 11 or 12 formations in verse 1.

2529
01:41:04,274 --> 01:41:05,874
There were seven of us,

2530
01:41:05,875 --> 01:41:09,213
but I couldn't believe how many formations we had.

2531
01:41:09,214 --> 01:41:10,915
That's what I thought.

2532
01:41:12,615 --> 01:41:16,084
We didn't stay in a single formation for more than three seconds.

2533
01:41:16,085 --> 01:41:18,853
Then move.

2534
01:41:18,854 --> 01:41:21,125
I made mistakes even while in the same formation.

2535
01:41:22,224 --> 01:41:24,654
But because I was moving while doing the dance,

2536
01:41:24,655 --> 01:41:25,825
it was disastrous.

2537
01:41:26,524 --> 01:41:28,665
But the important thing is to do it.

2538
01:41:29,165 --> 01:41:30,335
I have to do it even if I can't.

2539
01:41:31,464 --> 01:41:32,505
Start with the left foot!

2540
01:41:33,264 --> 01:41:34,934
Shake! Move aside.

2541
01:41:35,634 --> 01:41:38,075
(They're in a positive practice mode.)

2542
01:41:38,235 --> 01:41:39,304
Go in! Move to the back.

2543
01:41:47,085 --> 01:41:49,415
Let's try that again.

2544
01:41:51,054 --> 01:41:52,154
All right.

2545
01:41:52,155 --> 01:41:54,424
(Repeating the difficult part over and over again)

2546
01:41:54,854 --> 01:41:56,295
I got it right!

2547
01:41:57,394 --> 01:41:58,893
As we practiced,

2548
01:41:58,894 --> 01:42:01,964
the other members were so nice and our atmosphere was great.

2549
01:42:03,434 --> 01:42:06,035
If we can carry on this atmosphere until the end,

2550
01:42:06,304 --> 01:42:10,574
I think we have a chance of winning first place.

2551
01:42:10,575 --> 01:42:12,474
Yes!

2552
01:42:12,575 --> 01:42:15,075
(Humming)

2553
01:42:16,375 --> 01:42:17,575
That was good, KOTARO.

2554
01:42:18,985 --> 01:42:20,444
You added your own style.

2555
01:42:20,445 --> 01:42:21,985
(Everything is going well with Team "Breaking News.")

2556
01:42:23,485 --> 01:42:25,284
We just received an announcement.

2557
01:42:25,285 --> 01:42:26,285
Right now?

2558
01:42:26,354 --> 01:42:28,694
We'll be doing a trainee self-evaluation.

2559
01:42:28,695 --> 01:42:30,593
A trainee self-evaluation?

2560
01:42:30,594 --> 01:42:33,164
Will we be watching our own live performance video?

2561
01:42:33,165 --> 01:42:34,224
That must be it.

2562
01:42:34,865 --> 01:42:37,563
Hello, we are Team "Breaking News."

2563
01:42:37,564 --> 01:42:40,103
Hello, we are Team "Merry-Go-Round."

2564
01:42:40,104 --> 01:42:41,564
(A live performance video...)

2565
01:42:42,235 --> 01:42:44,174
(regarding the progress of the five teams' practice)

2566
01:42:44,604 --> 01:42:48,575
(Each team will be watching the other teams' videos.)

2567
01:42:48,714 --> 01:42:50,314
Their dance is not perfect.

2568
01:42:50,615 --> 01:42:52,013
They're not as refreshing as we are.

2569
01:42:52,014 --> 01:42:53,445
They look a bit dark.

2570
01:42:53,514 --> 01:42:55,814
I think we need more practice.

2571
01:42:55,915 --> 01:42:57,085
How are we going to do this?

2572
01:42:57,514 --> 01:42:59,554
All they need is to improve their dance.

2573
01:42:59,684 --> 01:43:01,485
Their vocals and overall performance were good.

2574
01:43:01,755 --> 01:43:03,554
- Should I write that? - Yes.

2575
01:43:03,695 --> 01:43:05,125
Let me take a breath before reading it.

2576
01:43:07,365 --> 01:43:11,495
(What was written on their evaluation?)

2577
01:43:13,335 --> 01:43:15,335
Wait a second.

2578
01:43:17,075 --> 01:43:18,134
Yes?

2579
01:43:19,705 --> 01:43:20,745
Yes?

2580
01:43:22,415 --> 01:43:25,985
(Trainee KANG HYUNWOO suddenly starts tearing up.)

2581
01:43:32,255 --> 01:43:33,554
Wait...

2582
01:43:34,224 --> 01:43:38,094
I was a bit worried because my voice wasn't...

2583
01:43:38,695 --> 01:43:40,264
in a good condition.

2584
01:43:41,695 --> 01:43:43,164
(During the rival match)

2585
01:43:43,165 --> 01:43:44,934
I completely lost my voice.

2586
01:43:45,235 --> 01:43:48,335
I wasn't able to sing properly.

2587
01:43:50,005 --> 01:43:51,505
But when I opened this,

2588
01:43:52,644 --> 01:43:55,814
it says it's a relief that my voice has gotten better...

2589
01:43:56,174 --> 01:43:57,974
and that this song suits me.

2590
01:43:58,045 --> 01:44:02,553
They wrote a lot of good things.

2591
01:44:02,554 --> 01:44:05,955
It felt like I was getting hugs for all my hard work.

2592
01:44:05,985 --> 01:44:08,255
These emotions came rushing to me.

2593
01:44:09,394 --> 01:44:13,995
For me, it says, "I like it because your pitch is on point."

2594
01:44:14,165 --> 01:44:16,834
"You really brought...

2595
01:44:16,835 --> 01:44:19,734
the humming part to life."

2596
01:44:19,735 --> 01:44:22,433
"The intro part was impressive."

2597
01:44:22,434 --> 01:44:23,774
"It sounds stable in general."

2598
01:44:24,274 --> 01:44:25,904
"He's a trainee who has shown a lot of growth."

2599
01:44:25,905 --> 01:44:28,915
"It's surprising to see him grow this much after various projects."

2600
01:44:29,214 --> 01:44:31,774
"It's impossible how he can be good at everything."

2601
01:44:31,884 --> 01:44:33,444
"His pronunciation is good,

2602
01:44:33,445 --> 01:44:35,883
and his dance quality is great."

2603
01:44:35,884 --> 01:44:38,254
"He's doing great every time I see him,

2604
01:44:38,255 --> 01:44:39,923
so I respect him."

2605
01:44:39,924 --> 01:44:40,955
(Personal evaluation for KWON YONGHYUN)

2606
01:44:41,155 --> 01:44:42,994
"It feels good to watch him dance because his moves are accurate."

2607
01:44:42,995 --> 01:44:44,353
"The concept suits him well."

2608
01:44:44,354 --> 01:44:45,594
(Personal evaluation for YU JIAHN)

2609
01:44:45,764 --> 01:44:47,295
"They seem to have good teamwork."

2610
01:44:47,464 --> 01:44:50,063
"All the members have a good understanding of the concept,"

2611
01:44:50,064 --> 01:44:52,004
"and they seem ready to perform on stage."

2612
01:44:52,005 --> 01:44:53,764
"They could even make their debut."

2613
01:44:55,165 --> 01:44:56,173
The first place...

2614
01:44:56,174 --> 01:44:57,204
(What's the ranking for the self-evaluation?)

2615
01:44:57,205 --> 01:44:58,544
goes to Team "Breaking News" with four votes.

2616
01:44:58,545 --> 01:45:00,445
(Team "Breaking News" received four votes.)

2617
01:45:01,045 --> 01:45:02,374
- That's amazing. - Did we get all the votes?

2618
01:45:02,375 --> 01:45:03,714
- We got 4 votes. - Did we get 4 votes?

2619
01:45:03,875 --> 01:45:05,884
It was unanimous.

2620
01:45:08,985 --> 01:45:11,255
We won first place.

2621
01:45:11,354 --> 01:45:13,923
It felt like a reward for all our hard work.

2622
01:45:13,924 --> 01:45:15,353
I was so thankful.

2623
01:45:15,354 --> 01:45:17,694
We're going to focus on improving the quality of our performance...

2624
01:45:17,695 --> 01:45:19,024
to put on a great show.

2625
01:45:19,295 --> 01:45:21,764
We'll prepare the best we can.

2626
01:45:22,934 --> 01:45:24,864
Here's the overall team evaluation.

2627
01:45:24,865 --> 01:45:25,865
All right.

2628
01:45:26,604 --> 01:45:28,574
"It felt a big chaotic,"

2629
01:45:28,575 --> 01:45:30,074
"and the song was supposed to be cheerful,"

2630
01:45:30,075 --> 01:45:32,575
"but the team atmosphere didn't seem like it."

2631
01:45:33,604 --> 01:45:35,673
"It seemed like they had an argument."

2632
01:45:35,674 --> 01:45:37,445
"They seem to have conflicting opinions."

2633
01:45:38,214 --> 01:45:40,984
"The song was cheerful and energetic,"

2634
01:45:40,985 --> 01:45:42,915
"but the teammates seemed awkward."

2635
01:45:43,514 --> 01:45:44,954
"They look a bit rowdy."

2636
01:45:44,955 --> 01:45:48,554
"Maybe the teammates should discuss if they understood in the same way."

2637
01:45:49,455 --> 01:45:51,423
"They all look gloomy in the video."

2638
01:45:51,424 --> 01:45:53,295
"I'm a spectator, but it makes me feel uneasy."

2639
01:45:54,695 --> 01:45:56,633
"We don't know what issue they had,"

2640
01:45:56,634 --> 01:45:59,405
"but they looked sad and unmotivated."

2641
01:46:02,104 --> 01:46:04,375
The fact that what we felt...

2642
01:46:04,774 --> 01:46:08,245
could be seen so obviously...

2643
01:46:08,644 --> 01:46:11,875
made me feel like it was all because of me.

2644
01:46:12,514 --> 01:46:14,844
I hope we have the same understanding...

2645
01:46:14,884 --> 01:46:18,384
of the song when we perform this on stage.

2646
01:46:18,684 --> 01:46:19,924
I was upset about it.

2647
01:46:20,554 --> 01:46:23,554
Why did we have to get these comments from 35 people?

2648
01:46:24,495 --> 01:46:26,865
"He was the only one that was stiff in the video."

2649
01:46:27,125 --> 01:46:30,134
"His face was gloomy that it seemed he was going through something."

2650
01:46:30,394 --> 01:46:33,804
"It looks like he doesn't want to perform this song."

2651
01:46:34,104 --> 01:46:37,103
"I know he's talented, but he doesn't seem skilled here."

2652
01:46:37,104 --> 01:46:38,405
"He looks like he doesn't want to do it."

2653
01:46:38,474 --> 01:46:40,544
"He looks unwilling to do this,"

2654
01:46:40,545 --> 01:46:43,045
"and he might need to grasp the atmosphere of the song first."

2655
01:46:46,585 --> 01:46:47,585
I see.

2656
01:46:47,844 --> 01:46:49,115
I was so embarrassed.

2657
01:46:50,314 --> 01:46:52,284
"His tone was unstable and he seemed too focused on his singing..."

2658
01:46:52,285 --> 01:46:53,924
"that he was dancing half-heartedly."

2659
01:46:54,485 --> 01:46:56,393
"He needs to practice his singing and dancing."

2660
01:46:56,394 --> 01:46:57,754
"His pitch was unstable."

2661
01:46:57,755 --> 01:46:58,894
(Personal evaluation on CHAE HEEJU)

2662
01:46:59,264 --> 01:47:01,125
"His expression and vibe..."

2663
01:47:01,424 --> 01:47:03,865
"was very isolated from the atmosphere of the song."

2664
01:47:04,964 --> 01:47:06,763
"He needs to be more cheerful,"

2665
01:47:06,764 --> 01:47:08,634
"and he needs a reinterpretation of the song."

2666
01:47:16,274 --> 01:47:17,474
Well...

2667
01:47:24,384 --> 01:47:25,683
(CHAE HEEJU leaves the training room.)

2668
01:47:25,684 --> 01:47:27,224
May I go to the restroom for a bit?

2669
01:47:29,995 --> 01:47:31,353
Was my practice insufficient?

2670
01:47:31,354 --> 01:47:33,424
How was my practice?

2671
01:47:37,335 --> 01:47:38,835
I could not find any solution.

2672
01:47:40,464 --> 01:47:43,334
Team "Breaking News" was almost complete with their song,

2673
01:47:43,335 --> 01:47:44,505
yet...

2674
01:47:44,905 --> 01:47:46,875
our atmosphere wasn't easy to start with.

2675
01:47:47,144 --> 01:47:49,245
I started to feel like this was becoming a problem.

2676
01:47:53,144 --> 01:47:56,455
I'm afraid our performance might seem like...

2677
01:47:56,955 --> 01:47:58,384
we were unwilling to do it.

2678
01:48:03,955 --> 01:48:05,394
It's nothing like that.

2679
01:48:05,495 --> 01:48:08,024
I'm worried it might seem like that.

2680
01:48:10,134 --> 01:48:12,264
(That night)

2681
01:48:13,835 --> 01:48:15,634
What if...

2682
01:48:16,035 --> 01:48:18,075
our leader was a different person?

2683
01:48:19,804 --> 01:48:22,714
I don't know if I'm suited...

2684
01:48:23,774 --> 01:48:26,184
to lead the team.

2685
01:48:27,144 --> 01:48:30,214
The atmosphere wasn't great during practice today.

2686
01:48:30,285 --> 01:48:31,384
You're right.

2687
01:48:31,615 --> 01:48:33,755
The leader of the team...

2688
01:48:33,825 --> 01:48:36,654
needs to take good care of the members.

2689
01:48:36,655 --> 01:48:38,024
(FONG ATILLA)

2690
01:48:38,495 --> 01:48:41,064
If JOONWOO or JEONGMIN becomes the leader,

2691
01:48:41,524 --> 01:48:43,564
the atmosphere during practice...

2692
01:48:44,934 --> 01:48:48,434
might be better than before.

2693
01:48:48,464 --> 01:48:51,433
I'm just asking.

2694
01:48:51,434 --> 01:48:52,505
(Will Team "KOOL-AID" be able to overcome the crisis?)

2695
01:48:53,274 --> 01:48:55,615
(The training room of Team "Time After Time")

2696
01:48:59,915 --> 01:49:01,545
- What? - Hold on.

2697
01:49:03,054 --> 01:49:04,714
- If we do it in sync... - The song...

2698
01:49:05,314 --> 01:49:06,825
- It's so... - I love it.

2699
01:49:08,825 --> 01:49:10,955
- The song is really good. - Yes, I agree.

2700
01:49:11,155 --> 01:49:12,795
It's easy on the ears.

2701
01:49:13,094 --> 01:49:14,664
There isn't a single part to discard.

2702
01:49:14,665 --> 01:49:16,134
- All the parts are really nice. - Yes.

2703
01:49:16,665 --> 01:49:18,494
While listening to the song,

2704
01:49:18,495 --> 01:49:20,664
I imagined each member...

2705
01:49:20,665 --> 01:49:22,674
singing the song. Everyone suits the song.

2706
01:49:22,875 --> 01:49:24,035
Everyone suits the song very well.

2707
01:49:24,075 --> 01:49:26,844
I want to sort things out quickly and practice.

2708
01:49:27,174 --> 01:49:29,813
That's right. I can't wait to sort things out...

2709
01:49:29,814 --> 01:49:31,774
and start practicing.

2710
01:49:32,384 --> 01:49:35,144
"Time After Time." I felt the vibe...

2711
01:49:35,344 --> 01:49:40,054
of continue to try hard and making efforts until the end...

2712
01:49:40,224 --> 01:49:43,393
for something you really want.

2713
01:49:43,394 --> 01:49:45,195
I felt that vibe.

2714
01:49:45,224 --> 01:49:46,764
I was really touched.

2715
01:49:47,165 --> 01:49:50,764
For me, "Time After Time" was number one.

2716
01:49:51,695 --> 01:49:54,335
"Guys, rip up the stage with your vocals."

2717
01:49:54,464 --> 01:49:55,874
I think...

2718
01:49:55,875 --> 01:49:59,075
that was the thought behind the assembly of this team.

2719
01:49:59,604 --> 01:50:02,104
It's the dream team I had in mind.

2720
01:50:02,245 --> 01:50:04,514
All the members have strong vocals,

2721
01:50:05,245 --> 01:50:06,785
so I'm very excited.

2722
01:50:07,245 --> 01:50:09,684
This team has five main vocalists, so other teams are struggling.

2723
01:50:10,615 --> 01:50:12,723
They kept asking us to trade members.

2724
01:50:12,724 --> 01:50:15,255
- That's right. - This is for the main vocalists.

2725
01:50:15,625 --> 01:50:17,255
All the good vocalists are in this team.

2726
01:50:17,795 --> 01:50:19,923
I'm sure we'll quarrel about...

2727
01:50:19,924 --> 01:50:21,094
dividing up the parts, but...

2728
01:50:22,264 --> 01:50:24,864
"This team will have a war of the vocals."

2729
01:50:24,865 --> 01:50:26,235
I had that thought.

2730
01:50:26,964 --> 01:50:29,734
All the vocalists were in the team.

2731
01:50:29,735 --> 01:50:31,335
I thought, "There will be a bit of a competition."

2732
01:50:31,535 --> 01:50:33,104
There were many main vocalists.

2733
01:50:33,174 --> 01:50:36,144
I thought that I'd need to fight.

2734
01:50:38,174 --> 01:50:40,785
(The trainees watch the choreography video.)

2735
01:50:48,125 --> 01:50:50,594
The main vocalist is practically the main dancer.

2736
01:51:00,905 --> 01:51:02,835
Isn't the verse better?

2737
01:51:15,285 --> 01:51:17,655
(The chorus follows.)

2738
01:51:27,024 --> 01:51:29,464
(The main vocalist's part continues.)

2739
01:51:37,905 --> 01:51:39,803
The main vocalist has many parts.

2740
01:51:39,804 --> 01:51:42,574
But other positions...

2741
01:51:42,575 --> 01:51:44,445
each have a killer part.

2742
01:51:45,575 --> 01:51:48,784
I really want to see the verse.

2743
01:51:48,785 --> 01:51:51,114
The lead vocalist's verse is really nice.

2744
01:51:51,115 --> 01:51:52,624
- I want to be a lead vocalist. - Same here.

2745
01:51:52,625 --> 01:51:55,625
- The lead vocalists 1. - I also think verse 1 was...

2746
01:51:56,424 --> 01:51:57,554
the best.

2747
01:52:00,165 --> 01:52:03,694
Instead of dancing, lead vocalist one sings...

2748
01:52:03,695 --> 01:52:05,495
while acting.

2749
01:52:05,934 --> 01:52:07,304
It's what I like.

2750
01:52:07,705 --> 01:52:11,004
I like singing while standing still and acting.

2751
01:52:11,005 --> 01:52:12,574
- It's perfect for singing. - Yes.

2752
01:52:12,575 --> 01:52:14,505
- That way, I can focus. - Right.

2753
01:52:14,844 --> 01:52:16,014
I have confidence.

2754
01:52:16,545 --> 01:52:18,773
We need to sing live in the end.

2755
01:52:18,774 --> 01:52:20,115
Since that's the case,

2756
01:52:20,285 --> 01:52:23,914
I think it'll be more impactful to take the position...

2757
01:52:23,915 --> 01:52:26,154
that shows itself through formation.

2758
01:52:26,155 --> 01:52:28,724
That's why I think lead vocalist one is nice.

2759
01:52:30,625 --> 01:52:33,794
The greenest season of ours

2760
01:52:33,795 --> 01:52:34,864
You want this position, right?

2761
01:52:34,865 --> 01:52:36,433
Even though we're clumsy

2762
01:52:36,434 --> 01:52:37,495
This position.

2763
01:52:37,594 --> 01:52:40,434
I want to be lead vocalist 1 or 2.

2764
01:52:41,104 --> 01:52:42,974
- Seriously. - I think it'll be great...

2765
01:52:43,274 --> 01:52:45,773
- Do you want it? - to start this one with your voice.

2766
01:52:45,774 --> 01:52:47,173
I really want to sing it.

2767
01:52:47,174 --> 01:52:48,705
I want to be included in the verse.

2768
01:52:49,014 --> 01:52:50,874
Which position do you want?

2769
01:52:50,875 --> 01:52:53,643
Me? Lead vocalist one.

2770
01:52:53,644 --> 01:52:54,984
Sun comes down

2771
01:52:54,985 --> 01:52:56,154
I don't need other positions.

2772
01:52:56,155 --> 01:52:57,814
Lead vocalist one...

2773
01:52:58,054 --> 01:53:00,284
has many parts that accentuate...

2774
01:53:00,285 --> 01:53:02,053
what I think is my secret weapon,

2775
01:53:02,054 --> 01:53:03,553
the baritone voice.

2776
01:53:03,554 --> 01:53:05,194
If I sing it,

2777
01:53:05,195 --> 01:53:08,523
I'll be able to make everyone focus and surprise them...

2778
01:53:08,524 --> 01:53:10,234
with my colors.

2779
01:53:10,235 --> 01:53:11,994
That's why I want to be lead vocalist one.

2780
01:53:11,995 --> 01:53:14,334
Let's go further

2781
01:53:14,335 --> 01:53:16,673
It's so brilliant

2782
01:53:16,674 --> 01:53:17,834
Every day

2783
01:53:17,835 --> 01:53:21,004
What I want is the position of main vocalist.

2784
01:53:21,005 --> 01:53:22,744
On top of the continued time

2785
01:53:22,745 --> 01:53:25,173
Stop in the moment and remember

2786
01:53:25,174 --> 01:53:28,415
I was the main vocalist in the two previous matches.

2787
01:53:30,014 --> 01:53:33,955
I want the parts with the chorus this time as well.

2788
01:53:35,255 --> 01:53:38,053
Take my hand, let's go further

2789
01:53:38,054 --> 01:53:40,994
- It's so brilliant - It's so brilliant

2790
01:53:40,995 --> 01:53:44,235
I think YOUNGSEO will apply for the main vocalist position.

2791
01:53:44,764 --> 01:53:46,504
I'll need to have...

2792
01:53:46,505 --> 01:53:49,304
something like a battle with YOUNGSEO.

2793
01:53:49,604 --> 01:53:52,374
I have confidence in dancing and singing.

2794
01:53:52,375 --> 01:53:54,244
It's my desire...

2795
01:53:54,245 --> 01:53:57,545
to prove myself as an all-rounder.

2796
01:53:58,075 --> 01:54:01,585
I think we should start with the main vocalist position.

2797
01:54:01,884 --> 01:54:03,383
Firstly, who wants to be...

2798
01:54:03,384 --> 01:54:05,354
the main vocalist? Raise your hand.

2799
01:54:05,514 --> 01:54:09,224
We can make it work.

2800
01:54:09,325 --> 01:54:10,455
HANBIN.

2801
01:54:10,655 --> 01:54:12,964
(YOO YOUNGSEO, SHIN JAEWON, and WU CHENYU)

2802
01:54:13,094 --> 01:54:15,023
- YOUNGSEO, - Shall we listen to them sing?

2803
01:54:15,024 --> 01:54:16,633
CHENYU, and JAEWON.

2804
01:54:16,634 --> 01:54:17,694
- Let's go. - Okay.

2805
01:54:17,695 --> 01:54:20,463
Take my hand, let's go further

2806
01:54:20,464 --> 01:54:24,035
It's so brilliant, we can't

2807
01:54:24,075 --> 01:54:27,004
Take my hand, let's go further

2808
01:54:27,005 --> 01:54:29,843
It's so brilliant

2809
01:54:29,844 --> 01:54:32,744
Take my hand, let's go further

2810
01:54:32,745 --> 01:54:36,255
It's so brilliant, we can't

2811
01:54:36,455 --> 01:54:38,053
- My goodness. - I'm torn.

2812
01:54:38,054 --> 01:54:39,554
Even listening to them was hard.

2813
01:54:40,155 --> 01:54:41,255
I'm torn.

2814
01:54:41,625 --> 01:54:43,923
For the main vocalist position,

2815
01:54:43,924 --> 01:54:45,694
I initially thought that I'd listen to the tone.

2816
01:54:45,695 --> 01:54:46,825
But come to think of it,

2817
01:54:47,325 --> 01:54:48,524
we'll have to sing live.

2818
01:54:48,865 --> 01:54:50,893
- During the live performance, - That's right.

2819
01:54:50,894 --> 01:54:54,103
they might not be able to sing the same way.

2820
01:54:54,104 --> 01:54:56,104
So I want to listen to them sing once more.

2821
01:54:56,434 --> 01:54:59,004
Will you be able to sing and dance already?

2822
01:54:59,005 --> 01:55:00,374
- It'll be hard. - That's right.

2823
01:55:00,375 --> 01:55:01,844
- I'll give it a go. - We'll just get a sense of it.

2824
01:55:02,005 --> 01:55:03,414
- Yes. We'll just get a sense of it. - The lyrics...

2825
01:55:03,415 --> 01:55:04,813
Don't tease me for being a bad dancer.

2826
01:55:04,814 --> 01:55:05,844
Okay.

2827
01:55:07,545 --> 01:55:10,353
Take my hand, let's go further

2828
01:55:10,354 --> 01:55:13,084
It's so brilliant

2829
01:55:13,085 --> 01:55:16,324
We can't stop Stop in the moment

2830
01:55:16,325 --> 01:55:19,024
Let's run, time after time

2831
01:55:19,365 --> 01:55:22,593
Let's remember, time after time

2832
01:55:22,594 --> 01:55:25,665
We can't stop

2833
01:55:26,934 --> 01:55:28,263
Stop

2834
01:55:28,264 --> 01:55:30,574
Let's get up once more

2835
01:55:30,575 --> 01:55:33,445
Let's run, time after time

2836
01:55:34,045 --> 01:55:35,245
I couldn't hear it.

2837
01:55:35,405 --> 01:55:37,444
- You couldn't hear the song? - No. The music.

2838
01:55:37,445 --> 01:55:38,445
Next.

2839
01:55:38,446 --> 01:55:40,084
Can you raise the volume?

2840
01:55:40,085 --> 01:55:41,713
- Okay. - He couldn't hear the music.

2841
01:55:41,714 --> 01:55:43,115
Only I performed without the music.

2842
01:55:46,224 --> 01:55:47,354
Take

2843
01:55:47,785 --> 01:55:50,694
Take my hand, let's go further

2844
01:55:50,695 --> 01:55:54,324
It's so brilliant, we can't stop

2845
01:55:54,325 --> 01:55:56,433
I'm here to become a vocalist.

2846
01:55:56,434 --> 01:55:59,964
I have pride as the main vocalist.

2847
01:56:00,564 --> 01:56:03,933
I think all of us are good singers.

2848
01:56:03,934 --> 01:56:06,504
So we need to consider the vibe and image...

2849
01:56:06,505 --> 01:56:07,574
of this song as well.

2850
01:56:07,575 --> 01:56:09,103
- Dance too. - That's right.

2851
01:56:09,104 --> 01:56:11,314
- We need to dance and sing live. - Yes.

2852
01:56:11,445 --> 01:56:13,183
Please think about singing live and dancing.

2853
01:56:13,184 --> 01:56:14,714
- Please consider everything. - Please consider everything.

2854
01:56:14,814 --> 01:56:16,484
- All right. - All done?

2855
01:56:16,485 --> 01:56:17,654
Not yet.

2856
01:56:17,655 --> 01:56:18,814
(Who will be the main vocalist?)

2857
01:56:23,195 --> 01:56:24,195
All right.

2858
01:56:24,325 --> 01:56:25,755
YOO YOUNGSEO, congratulations.

2859
01:56:26,295 --> 01:56:28,023
- You're the main vocalist. - Congratulations.

2860
01:56:28,024 --> 01:56:29,894
- The main vocalist. - Congratulations.

2861
01:56:30,564 --> 01:56:32,334
I'll do my absolute best.

2862
01:56:32,335 --> 01:56:34,103
I think you'll need to work very hard.

2863
01:56:34,104 --> 01:56:35,634
You'll need to work very hard.

2864
01:56:35,665 --> 01:56:37,535
It's my first time not becoming the main vocalist.

2865
01:56:38,804 --> 01:56:42,674
I felt a bit unhappy.

2866
01:56:43,274 --> 01:56:45,814
I'm unhappy about it.

2867
01:56:46,684 --> 01:56:49,285
- Okay. Lead vocalist. - Lead vocalist one.

2868
01:56:49,554 --> 01:56:51,714
Who really wants this position?

2869
01:56:52,514 --> 01:56:53,754
- Me. - Me.

2870
01:56:53,755 --> 01:56:54,984
(Everyone except for BINGHUA applies for the position.)

2871
01:56:54,985 --> 01:56:56,894
This has to be my position.

2872
01:56:57,125 --> 01:56:59,023
It was the only position I wanted from the start.

2873
01:56:59,024 --> 01:57:02,494
Lead vocalist one begins the verse.

2874
01:57:02,495 --> 01:57:06,804
So it'll be nice if his voice is attention-grabbing.

2875
01:57:07,405 --> 01:57:09,164
I had that thought.

2876
01:57:09,165 --> 01:57:10,273
- I agree. - Yes.

2877
01:57:10,274 --> 01:57:12,173
As soon as the song begins, people need to go, "My goodness."

2878
01:57:12,174 --> 01:57:13,174
Yes.

2879
01:57:13,344 --> 01:57:15,375
Sun comes down

2880
01:57:15,545 --> 01:57:18,273
Orange-colored borderline

2881
01:57:18,274 --> 01:57:19,643
On the sand

2882
01:57:19,644 --> 01:57:23,214
I was in the same team with HANBIN for "Love me or Leave me."

2883
01:57:24,014 --> 01:57:26,154
Back then, I thought the vibe of the song...

2884
01:57:26,155 --> 01:57:27,553
suited HANBIN better.

2885
01:57:27,554 --> 01:57:29,125
So I let him take the good parts.

2886
01:57:31,155 --> 01:57:33,124
But as for this song,

2887
01:57:33,125 --> 01:57:36,664
I think I should sing the intro. I'm confident that it'll be fitting.

2888
01:57:36,665 --> 01:57:38,264
To be honest, I have confidence.

2889
01:57:38,394 --> 01:57:40,463
Sun comes down

2890
01:57:40,464 --> 01:57:43,134
Orange-colored borderline

2891
01:57:43,235 --> 01:57:48,274
On the sand are our footprints And our shadows

2892
01:57:49,144 --> 01:57:52,643
Now, please vote for lead vocalist one.

2893
01:57:52,644 --> 01:57:54,545
Please vote for HANBIN.

2894
01:57:55,014 --> 01:57:57,184
Please vote for TAEHWAN.

2895
01:57:57,354 --> 01:58:01,285
After all, I have the image...

2896
01:58:01,585 --> 01:58:03,955
of a talented vocalist.

2897
01:58:04,224 --> 01:58:07,594
I got this far thanks to my singing skills alone.

2898
01:58:07,695 --> 01:58:09,064
I can really do it.

2899
01:58:09,894 --> 01:58:11,934
I can really do well.

2900
01:58:12,804 --> 01:58:15,064
All right. The voting is closed.

2901
01:58:15,835 --> 01:58:17,803
All right. HANBIN,

2902
01:58:17,804 --> 01:58:21,304
- congratulations. - My goodness. Thank you.

2903
01:58:21,505 --> 01:58:23,115
To be honest, I was upset.

2904
01:58:23,615 --> 01:58:25,474
The result wasn't to my liking.

2905
01:58:26,514 --> 01:58:28,144
Shall we vote for lead vocalist two?

2906
01:58:28,285 --> 01:58:29,485
Everyone will apply, right?

2907
01:58:29,655 --> 01:58:31,654
Of course. There's no place to back down.

2908
01:58:31,655 --> 01:58:32,985
Let's begin right away.

2909
01:58:33,125 --> 01:58:34,785
I was anxious, to be honest.

2910
01:58:34,825 --> 01:58:36,995
I felt very lost.

2911
01:58:39,024 --> 01:58:41,894
(The last hope, lead vocalist 2 position)

2912
01:58:43,735 --> 01:58:45,564
There's something I want to say.

2913
01:58:45,594 --> 01:58:47,804
- Since I like this part so much, - Okay.

2914
01:58:47,905 --> 01:58:50,875
- I want to talk about it more. - Okay.

2915
01:58:50,974 --> 01:58:53,643
When you look at the choreography for this part,

2916
01:58:53,644 --> 01:58:55,745
many dance moves use the hands.

2917
01:58:55,804 --> 01:58:59,485
I have confidence when it comes to hand movements.

2918
01:59:00,615 --> 01:59:02,013
Was it an appeal? I can do it as well.

2919
01:59:02,014 --> 01:59:03,313
- Go ahead. - Say what you want to say.

2920
01:59:03,314 --> 01:59:04,513
- Go ahead. - Hurry up.

2921
01:59:04,514 --> 01:59:05,785
Firstly,

2922
01:59:05,985 --> 01:59:07,553
I have confidence in the intro and bridge.

2923
01:59:07,554 --> 01:59:09,325
And during the bridge...

2924
01:59:09,424 --> 01:59:11,195
HANBIN is lead vocalist one, right?

2925
01:59:11,255 --> 01:59:13,125
There's a part in which we sing together.

2926
01:59:13,264 --> 01:59:15,264
- You're right. - I think our voices will mix well.

2927
01:59:15,594 --> 01:59:18,134
I've sung with HANBIN for "Jealousy."

2928
01:59:18,235 --> 01:59:20,365
- JAEWON did that. - I did that.

2929
01:59:20,434 --> 01:59:22,534
- I'm a rock vocalist. - We had good teamwork.

2930
01:59:22,535 --> 01:59:23,874
Seriously. That's right.

2931
01:59:23,875 --> 01:59:26,303
And when it comes to dance,

2932
01:59:26,304 --> 01:59:28,445
I think I can show...

2933
01:59:28,804 --> 01:59:30,575
a beautiful form.

2934
01:59:30,945 --> 01:59:34,513
I wanted to express the vibe of the song well.

2935
01:59:34,514 --> 01:59:37,514
I really wanted that part.

2936
01:59:37,755 --> 01:59:39,524
I caught a cold.

2937
01:59:39,585 --> 01:59:42,424
I can improve my pronunciation...

2938
01:59:42,524 --> 01:59:44,155
for the lyrics.

2939
01:59:44,255 --> 01:59:45,294
It's just that I really want it.

2940
01:59:45,295 --> 01:59:46,295
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

2941
01:59:46,296 --> 01:59:47,523
- I just wanted to say that. - You know,

2942
01:59:47,524 --> 01:59:49,794
- that's how it should be. - Yes.

2943
01:59:49,795 --> 01:59:51,864
I currently have a problem with the pronunciation...

2944
01:59:51,865 --> 01:59:53,934
because of the condition of my throat.

2945
01:59:54,464 --> 01:59:58,304
But I'm confident that I'll do well with enough practice.

2946
01:59:58,335 --> 02:00:00,074
And this position...

2947
02:00:00,075 --> 02:00:03,774
has a part where the camera zooms in on the face.

2948
02:00:03,875 --> 02:00:06,344
Lead vocalist two is like that.

2949
02:00:06,644 --> 02:00:08,084
I have confidence in my face.

2950
02:00:08,085 --> 02:00:09,954
- Of course. - I really want this part.

2951
02:00:09,955 --> 02:00:11,754
We approve. Okay. We approve.

2952
02:00:11,755 --> 02:00:14,784
- Please think about the image. - Okay.

2953
02:00:14,785 --> 02:00:15,985
He has a point.

2954
02:00:16,255 --> 02:00:17,853
There's something we need to think about.

2955
02:00:17,854 --> 02:00:20,125
Since this is a team with many vocalists,

2956
02:00:20,524 --> 02:00:22,933
people will have high expectations in terms of vocals.

2957
02:00:22,934 --> 02:00:24,665
- That's right. - We need to remember that.

2958
02:00:24,764 --> 02:00:28,933
In my opinion, we have to sing well no matter what.

2959
02:00:28,934 --> 02:00:30,933
- Singing takes priority. - Yes.

2960
02:00:30,934 --> 02:00:31,973
That's right.

2961
02:00:31,974 --> 02:00:34,004
- We can improve our dance. - Yes.

2962
02:00:34,005 --> 02:00:35,075
We can do that.

2963
02:00:35,644 --> 02:00:38,174
Singing should take priority.

2964
02:00:38,615 --> 02:00:43,585
Even though nothing lasts forever

2965
02:00:43,755 --> 02:00:45,853
Even though

2966
02:00:45,854 --> 02:00:48,353
(Being a team of vocalists,)

2967
02:00:48,354 --> 02:00:51,995
(they focus on the candidates' singing skills.)

2968
02:00:54,264 --> 02:00:59,195
Even though nothing lasts forever

2969
02:00:59,505 --> 02:01:02,464
I really can't choose one.

2970
02:01:03,434 --> 02:01:05,335
- Let's have a vote. - Okay.

2971
02:01:06,035 --> 02:01:09,274
I gave it a go because I failed to be the main vocalist.

2972
02:01:09,844 --> 02:01:11,973
Currently, my ranking is low.

2973
02:01:11,974 --> 02:01:14,114
Unless I get the parts in which I can show myself,

2974
02:01:14,115 --> 02:01:15,984
I'll face the danger...

2975
02:01:15,985 --> 02:01:19,085
of getting eliminated afterward. That's why I want this position.

2976
02:01:20,285 --> 02:01:23,295
Our team has many talented vocalists.

2977
02:01:23,594 --> 02:01:26,794
So there was a chance I couldn't get the position I wanted.

2978
02:01:26,795 --> 02:01:29,024
I was scared and anxious.

2979
02:01:30,394 --> 02:01:31,964
My mentality was in a dangerous place.

2980
02:01:32,035 --> 02:01:34,304
So many people told me,

2981
02:01:35,005 --> 02:01:37,875
'You'll do well since this song suits you," but...

2982
02:01:38,674 --> 02:01:39,945
The voting is closed.

2983
02:01:40,875 --> 02:01:44,745
CHENYU became lead vocalist two.

2984
02:01:50,714 --> 02:01:53,354
I couldn't take a single main part.

2985
02:01:55,625 --> 02:01:57,394
It's my first time being a sub vocalist.

2986
02:01:57,995 --> 02:01:59,254
It's my first time...

2987
02:01:59,255 --> 02:02:01,665
receiving such a few parts in a song.

2988
02:02:02,365 --> 02:02:05,264
(The main vocalist has so many parts.)

2989
02:02:05,335 --> 02:02:06,704
(Sub vocalist 1)

2990
02:02:06,705 --> 02:02:08,365
(But sub vocalist 1 only has 3 lines.)

2991
02:02:08,564 --> 02:02:09,933
Let's hurry up and memorize the lyrics.

2992
02:02:09,934 --> 02:02:11,804
Let's memorize the lyrics.

2993
02:02:11,875 --> 02:02:14,205
- Hurry up and memorize them. - Hurry up.

2994
02:02:14,405 --> 02:02:15,604
- Memorize the lyrics. - All done.

2995
02:02:16,344 --> 02:02:17,844
I have four lines.

2996
02:02:18,474 --> 02:02:19,514
Hey.

2997
02:02:19,615 --> 02:02:21,884
You have 4 lines? I have 3 lines.

2998
02:02:23,985 --> 02:02:25,854
My position only has four lines.

2999
02:02:26,155 --> 02:02:27,884
I don't know what to do, to be honest.

3000
02:02:28,825 --> 02:02:30,455
I'm disappointed, of course.

3001
02:02:30,655 --> 02:02:32,093
I have only a few parts,

3002
02:02:32,094 --> 02:02:34,324
so I'm not very visible.

3003
02:02:34,325 --> 02:02:37,165
That's why I'm a bit disappointed.

3004
02:02:37,865 --> 02:02:40,665
There were no positions I wanted.

3005
02:02:42,134 --> 02:02:44,774
Only the rapper position remained.

3006
02:02:44,934 --> 02:02:47,144
Will BINGHUA be the rapper?

3007
02:02:47,304 --> 02:02:49,713
BINGHUA will get the intro. He'll do it well.

3008
02:02:49,714 --> 02:02:50,814
I know.

3009
02:02:51,714 --> 02:02:56,014
I was surprised when I got picked as the rapper.

3010
02:02:56,684 --> 02:02:58,014
I was a bit worried.

3011
02:03:00,184 --> 02:03:02,553
We just need to focus on the formation.

3012
02:03:02,554 --> 02:03:04,354
- Then it's over. - Then it's over. Seriously.

3013
02:03:04,825 --> 02:03:06,625
All right. We're peaceful.

3014
02:03:06,995 --> 02:03:08,464
Okay. Let's begin.

3015
02:03:08,995 --> 02:03:11,234
- Let's start from there. - A straight line.

3016
02:03:11,235 --> 02:03:13,463
- A straight line. From there... - A straight line.

3017
02:03:13,464 --> 02:03:15,304
- Up. - You need to look ahead.

3018
02:03:15,564 --> 02:03:17,405
- Let's see. - When you cross...

3019
02:03:17,705 --> 02:03:20,774
What was it called? The formation can be...

3020
02:03:20,804 --> 02:03:22,673
a bit tricky.

3021
02:03:22,674 --> 02:03:23,745
Yes.

3022
02:03:24,644 --> 02:03:26,785
Still, we should...

3023
02:03:28,245 --> 02:03:30,314
- Shall we begin? - Yes. Let's go.

3024
02:03:30,514 --> 02:03:32,884
Five, six, seven, eight.

3025
02:03:33,024 --> 02:03:35,184
One, two, three, four.

3026
02:03:36,054 --> 02:03:37,254
What? BINGHUA.

3027
02:03:37,255 --> 02:03:40,195
One, two, three, four, five, six...

3028
02:03:40,524 --> 02:03:41,564
Okay.

3029
02:03:42,024 --> 02:03:43,835
We were a bit fast.

3030
02:03:45,064 --> 02:03:47,264
One and two and three and...

3031
02:03:47,735 --> 02:03:48,804
All right.

3032
02:03:54,844 --> 02:03:56,174
I don't want this part.

3033
02:03:57,945 --> 02:04:01,484
Had it been someone else, I would've challenged the decision.

3034
02:04:01,485 --> 02:04:02,985
Why did it have to be you?

3035
02:04:04,214 --> 02:04:05,985
- You know how I feel? - Yes, I do.

3036
02:04:06,625 --> 02:04:08,354
- What's wrong? - What's wrong?

3037
02:04:08,455 --> 02:04:09,524
Are you sick?

3038
02:04:09,894 --> 02:04:11,155
- What? - What?

3039
02:04:13,365 --> 02:04:15,094
- It's okay. - No.

3040
02:04:15,195 --> 02:04:16,325
- What's wrong? - What is it?

3041
02:04:17,195 --> 02:04:18,564
Tell them.

3042
02:04:19,705 --> 02:04:20,964
Tell them.

3043
02:04:26,335 --> 02:04:30,115
It's about the part. It can't be helped.

3044
02:04:32,915 --> 02:04:36,485
I was never in the debut team, the top seven members.

3045
02:04:36,684 --> 02:04:39,684
I really want to debut through this show.

3046
02:04:39,785 --> 02:04:43,924
I really want to work harder and become visible.

3047
02:04:44,695 --> 02:04:47,224
I performed "LALALALA" last time.

3048
02:04:48,295 --> 02:04:49,665
After the performance,

3049
02:04:50,464 --> 02:04:52,634
I received so many criticisms.

3050
02:04:52,695 --> 02:04:56,165
Everyone said that I was a terrible singer.

3051
02:04:56,205 --> 02:04:59,205
I really wanted to prove myself this time.

3052
02:04:59,375 --> 02:05:03,144
I thought there was a position that suited me well,

3053
02:05:03,245 --> 02:05:04,974
so I really wanted it.

3054
02:05:06,075 --> 02:05:07,514
That was why my emotions...

3055
02:05:10,785 --> 02:05:13,325
I want to try out for the position again,

3056
02:05:13,825 --> 02:05:15,883
but it went to CHENYU.

3057
02:05:15,884 --> 02:05:19,255
So I can't even do that. We're too close.

3058
02:05:19,724 --> 02:05:22,593
I don't know what I'm saying.

3059
02:05:22,594 --> 02:05:24,534
I understand.

3060
02:05:24,535 --> 02:05:28,165
It's CHENYU's position, so I can't even challenge him.

3061
02:05:29,264 --> 02:05:30,674
We're too close.

3062
02:05:31,705 --> 02:05:33,205
CHENYU is...

3063
02:05:33,674 --> 02:05:36,575
way below the rankings, so he needs an impactful position.

3064
02:05:36,844 --> 02:05:39,274
That's why my emotions are all over the place right now.

3065
02:05:40,615 --> 02:05:43,214
Actually... Why are you crying?

3066
02:05:44,554 --> 02:05:46,155
- Why are you crying? - Come on.

3067
02:05:46,655 --> 02:05:48,053
- My goodness. - Don't cry.

3068
02:05:48,054 --> 02:05:50,353
- Let's sit down for now. - What's wrong?

3069
02:05:50,354 --> 02:05:51,825
Let's sit down for a second.

3070
02:05:52,195 --> 02:05:54,365
Let's sit down for a second.

3071
02:05:55,464 --> 02:05:57,165
CHENYU.

3072
02:06:03,104 --> 02:06:05,505
I don't know what to do.

3073
02:06:09,814 --> 02:06:13,114
- I really want to debut. - I understand. You...

3074
02:06:13,115 --> 02:06:16,384
I want this opportunity so badly.

3075
02:06:18,514 --> 02:06:20,684
So I'll give you the position.

3076
02:06:21,054 --> 02:06:22,255
What will you do?

3077
02:06:22,325 --> 02:06:23,625
I'll get eliminated.

3078
02:06:29,024 --> 02:06:32,795
I don't know if I'll survive this time or not.

3079
02:06:34,264 --> 02:06:36,735
I'm in 34th place.

3080
02:06:36,934 --> 02:06:39,945
I told BINGHUA, "If you really want..."

3081
02:06:41,045 --> 02:06:43,844
"this position, I'll give it to you."

3082
02:06:45,514 --> 02:06:47,514
"I'll probably get eliminated..."

3083
02:06:48,415 --> 02:06:50,684
"whether or not..."

3084
02:06:51,214 --> 02:06:52,714
"I have this position."

3085
02:06:53,585 --> 02:06:55,884
The two of us cried a lot.

3086
02:06:58,554 --> 02:07:02,764
I'm still torn about the matter.

3087
02:07:07,934 --> 02:07:10,433
I have confidence that I'll do well...

3088
02:07:10,434 --> 02:07:12,035
in this position.

3089
02:07:12,434 --> 02:07:14,974
I think I can do that. But what will CHENYU do?

3090
02:07:15,875 --> 02:07:20,144
If I really challenge him, I'll feel so bad about it.

3091
02:07:20,814 --> 02:07:23,755
I still don't know if I should do it or not.

3092
02:07:24,955 --> 02:07:26,723
(After the interview,)

3093
02:07:26,724 --> 02:07:28,085
(the two trainees run into each other.)

3094
02:07:31,894 --> 02:07:34,063
(Desperation for the debut...)

3095
02:07:34,064 --> 02:07:36,524
(and love for a friend)

3096
02:07:37,795 --> 02:07:41,434
(Caught between the two, their emotions become a jumble.)

3097
02:07:43,064 --> 02:07:46,205
(What will the two trainees choose?)

3098
02:07:47,405 --> 02:07:50,013
We are the ones who survived...

3099
02:07:50,014 --> 02:07:51,115
the Passing Ceremony.

3100
02:07:51,674 --> 02:07:53,744
LYNNLYNN is in 35th place.

3101
02:07:53,745 --> 02:07:55,144
That's right.

3102
02:07:55,214 --> 02:07:57,013
- This team has... - It was electrifying.

3103
02:07:57,014 --> 02:07:58,713
the 1st place and 35th place.

3104
02:07:58,714 --> 02:07:59,784
You're right.

3105
02:07:59,785 --> 02:08:01,223
- How cool. - Let's beat everyone.

3106
02:08:01,224 --> 02:08:02,224
Good.

3107
02:08:02,225 --> 02:08:04,454
- So we'll perform "Trigger." - Yes.

3108
02:08:04,455 --> 02:08:05,624
Do you like it?

3109
02:08:05,625 --> 02:08:07,864
This song is very intense.

3110
02:08:07,865 --> 02:08:08,924
That's right.

3111
02:08:08,964 --> 02:08:11,664
I think we'll be able to show...

3112
02:08:11,665 --> 02:08:13,905
the charms of mature boys.

3113
02:08:14,535 --> 02:08:17,205
The members aren't so refreshing.

3114
02:08:18,405 --> 02:08:21,704
They're sexy and strong. How should I put it?

3115
02:08:21,705 --> 02:08:22,773
There's heat.

3116
02:08:22,774 --> 02:08:24,374
(There's heat.)

3117
02:08:24,375 --> 02:08:28,085
This is a song through which we can show our sexiness outright.

3118
02:08:28,714 --> 02:08:30,654
You must like the sexy songs.

3119
02:08:30,655 --> 02:08:31,814
I'm confident.

3120
02:08:33,184 --> 02:08:35,624
- I can't wait. - Let's go.

3121
02:08:35,625 --> 02:08:37,824
- Yes. - Yes.

3122
02:08:37,825 --> 02:08:38,825
What?

3123
02:08:41,325 --> 02:08:42,495
Let's go.

3124
02:08:46,195 --> 02:08:47,365
It's this song.

3125
02:09:10,054 --> 02:09:11,353
- The second verse... - My goodness.

3126
02:09:11,354 --> 02:09:12,755
The second verse is the kick.

3127
02:09:16,125 --> 02:09:19,433
I think people want to see a performance that is...

3128
02:09:19,434 --> 02:09:20,934
strong, sexy, and manly.

3129
02:09:22,235 --> 02:09:24,634
I thought, "It's so sexy. It's insane."

3130
02:09:37,854 --> 02:09:39,414
- It was so cool. - It was insane.

3131
02:09:39,415 --> 02:09:40,825
Sexy.

3132
02:09:41,424 --> 02:09:43,695
It was cool. It left lingering emotions.

3133
02:09:44,995 --> 02:09:47,964
My mouth was hanging open.

3134
02:09:49,024 --> 02:09:52,963
I really want to give a good performance.

3135
02:09:52,964 --> 02:09:54,534
- The song is amazing. - Seriously.

3136
02:09:54,535 --> 02:09:56,874
The video made me want to become a bad guy.

3137
02:09:56,875 --> 02:09:59,604
- Seriously. - It was insane.

3138
02:10:02,974 --> 02:10:04,014
Finally...

3139
02:10:04,615 --> 02:10:07,984
I almost have no words. Seriously.

3140
02:10:07,985 --> 02:10:08,985
(My goodness)

3141
02:10:09,615 --> 02:10:11,014
I couldn't say anything...

3142
02:10:11,514 --> 02:10:14,325
because I had goosebumps. I just watched the video again.

3143
02:10:14,424 --> 02:10:16,053
We kept going, "Let's watch it again."

3144
02:10:16,054 --> 02:10:17,424
We watched it many times.

3145
02:10:17,795 --> 02:10:20,593
I have the biggest desire to perform the new song...

3146
02:10:20,594 --> 02:10:21,795
very well.

3147
02:10:22,764 --> 02:10:24,263
- Everyone. - Yes?

3148
02:10:24,264 --> 02:10:26,494
It's time to divide up the parts.

3149
02:10:26,495 --> 02:10:27,634
- Okay. - All right.

3150
02:10:27,934 --> 02:10:31,734
I think we'll need to decide on the main vocalist first.

3151
02:10:31,735 --> 02:10:32,735
Okay.

3152
02:10:33,974 --> 02:10:35,104
My goodness.

3153
02:10:35,274 --> 02:10:37,075
Does anyone have confidence?

3154
02:10:37,344 --> 02:10:40,044
If you can hit the notes,

3155
02:10:40,045 --> 02:10:41,445
please step forward.

3156
02:10:43,184 --> 02:10:44,484
- My goodness. - There's no one.

3157
02:10:44,485 --> 02:10:46,553
- There's no one. - We'll need to take turns.

3158
02:10:46,554 --> 02:10:48,383
I was worried...

3159
02:10:48,384 --> 02:10:51,994
because not even a single member was a vocalist in our team.

3160
02:10:51,995 --> 02:10:55,665
Every member was a dancer or a rapper.

3161
02:10:55,964 --> 02:10:58,094
So I was anxious.

3162
02:10:58,964 --> 02:11:00,063
We'll need to take turns singing...

3163
02:11:00,064 --> 02:11:02,864
and decide on the best one.

3164
02:11:02,865 --> 02:11:03,934
Okay,

3165
02:11:04,005 --> 02:11:05,133
The vocalist should go first.

3166
02:11:05,134 --> 02:11:06,603
As rappers, we're at a disadvantage.

3167
02:11:06,604 --> 02:11:08,604
- The vocalist should go first. - Pull

3168
02:11:08,774 --> 02:11:10,245
Would you please go first?

3169
02:11:11,314 --> 02:11:12,545
Pull

3170
02:11:14,644 --> 02:11:18,853
Pull me harder

3171
02:11:18,854 --> 02:11:20,054
Baby

3172
02:11:20,224 --> 02:11:22,223
For you, I prepared

3173
02:11:22,224 --> 02:11:23,924
The song we got this time...

3174
02:11:24,024 --> 02:11:27,223
has a very high vocal range.

3175
02:11:27,224 --> 02:11:31,964
Both YEOJUN and I have low-pitched vocals.

3176
02:11:32,594 --> 02:11:36,205
LYNNLYNN was the only one who could hit the notes,

3177
02:11:36,604 --> 02:11:38,974
so he became the main vocalist.

3178
02:11:39,134 --> 02:11:41,843
T, T, Trigger

3179
02:11:41,844 --> 02:11:42,844
(LYNNLYNN's main positions are...)

3180
02:11:42,844 --> 02:11:43,844
It's hard.

3181
02:11:44,375 --> 02:11:48,214
(dance and rap.)

3182
02:11:48,884 --> 02:11:51,714
It's so hard.

3183
02:11:52,155 --> 02:11:53,285
I'm scared.

3184
02:11:53,384 --> 02:11:55,553
But it's okay.

3185
02:11:55,554 --> 02:11:57,524
I need to be the main vocalist.

3186
02:11:58,195 --> 02:12:01,624
LYNNLYNN isn't entirely comfortable with that position.

3187
02:12:01,625 --> 02:12:04,133
I felt bad for LYNNLYNN...

3188
02:12:04,134 --> 02:12:07,563
for giving him the responsibility...

3189
02:12:07,564 --> 02:12:08,835
of the main vocalist.

3190
02:12:09,634 --> 02:12:11,304
Let's decide on the rappers first.

3191
02:12:11,405 --> 02:12:12,434
- Okay. - Yes.

3192
02:12:12,804 --> 02:12:14,104
Let's start with rapper two.

3193
02:12:14,505 --> 02:12:15,603
Rapper two.

3194
02:12:15,604 --> 02:12:17,214
Rapper two...

3195
02:12:17,474 --> 02:12:19,914
- focuses on dancing. - It's cool.

3196
02:12:19,915 --> 02:12:22,545
That position gets a dance break too.

3197
02:12:24,684 --> 02:12:28,825
(The killer part of "Trigger...")

3198
02:12:29,985 --> 02:12:34,764
(and the dance break belong to rapper 2.)

3199
02:12:36,224 --> 02:12:37,894
May I apply for the rapper two position?

3200
02:12:38,235 --> 02:12:39,294
- Go ahead. - Yes.

3201
02:12:39,295 --> 02:12:42,433
In that case, are five people applying?

3202
02:12:42,434 --> 02:12:43,504
The applicants...

3203
02:12:43,505 --> 02:12:44,973
Everyone except for LYNNLYNN and me.

3204
02:12:44,974 --> 02:12:46,835
- Okay, let's go. - The rappers.

3205
02:12:47,674 --> 02:12:48,705
Oh, my goodness.

3206
02:12:48,804 --> 02:12:52,915
"I'm so bad guy" in the chorus is the killer part.

3207
02:12:53,144 --> 02:12:57,454
It's the part that carries the identity of this song.

3208
02:12:57,455 --> 02:12:58,955
That was why everyone applied.

3209
02:13:00,884 --> 02:13:02,285
- I'm so bad guy - I'm so bad guy

3210
02:13:05,195 --> 02:13:06,755
- I'm so bad guy - I'm so bad guy

3211
02:13:09,894 --> 02:13:11,594
I'm so bad guy

3212
02:13:14,564 --> 02:13:17,634
Point on the count of three.

3213
02:13:17,674 --> 02:13:19,335
One, two, three.

3214
02:13:19,575 --> 02:13:22,143
(YEOJUN, HYUNWOO, YICHEN, JUNSEO, JUNSEO, HYUNWOO)

3215
02:13:22,144 --> 02:13:23,144
Who received two votes?

3216
02:13:24,375 --> 02:13:27,214
- Me. - HYUNWOO and JUNSEO.

3217
02:13:27,644 --> 02:13:28,745
Whom did you vote for?

3218
02:13:28,884 --> 02:13:30,384
I voted for HYUNWOO.

3219
02:13:30,985 --> 02:13:32,485
It's me! Nice!

3220
02:13:33,455 --> 02:13:35,254
(KIM HYUNWOO takes the position of rapper 2.)

3221
02:13:35,255 --> 02:13:37,224
- It goes to HYUNWOO. - Okay.

3222
02:13:37,554 --> 02:13:38,655
All right.

3223
02:13:39,354 --> 02:13:40,695
I didn't think that I'd get it.

3224
02:13:40,964 --> 02:13:43,164
I thought that my voice...

3225
02:13:43,165 --> 02:13:46,194
suited the part better than HYUNWOO's.

3226
02:13:46,195 --> 02:13:47,365
I was a bit disappointed.

3227
02:13:47,665 --> 02:13:50,574
I also think that my skills are...

3228
02:13:50,575 --> 02:13:53,034
the most lacking in this team.

3229
02:13:53,035 --> 02:13:55,344
I'm very anxious.

3230
02:13:56,575 --> 02:13:58,074
Who wants to volunteer?

3231
02:13:58,075 --> 02:13:59,944
- Me. - Bad guy.

3232
02:13:59,945 --> 02:14:01,514
Four... Three. Okay.

3233
02:14:02,115 --> 02:14:05,884
Baby, there's no going back now

3234
02:14:06,085 --> 02:14:09,454
Lead vocalist two is YEOJUN.

3235
02:14:09,455 --> 02:14:11,924
- Okay. - Thank you. I'll work hard.

3236
02:14:11,925 --> 02:14:13,194
All right.

3237
02:14:13,665 --> 02:14:16,963
JUNSEO and YICHEN for lead vocalist one.

3238
02:14:16,964 --> 02:14:18,464
I'll apply as well.

3239
02:14:18,595 --> 02:14:19,794
Okay.

3240
02:14:19,995 --> 02:14:22,435
- Lead vocalist one is YICHEN. - Okay.

3241
02:14:22,634 --> 02:14:23,835
Thank you.

3242
02:14:24,534 --> 02:14:25,775
I'll work hard.

3243
02:14:26,974 --> 02:14:29,474
(He fails to get chosen once more.)

3244
02:14:30,314 --> 02:14:32,114
Sub vocalist one.

3245
02:14:32,544 --> 02:14:33,644
Me.

3246
02:14:35,614 --> 02:14:38,714
(He applies for the sub vocalist 1 position.)

3247
02:14:39,915 --> 02:14:42,283
Raise your hand if you want JUNSEO to do it.

3248
02:14:42,284 --> 02:14:43,354
(PARK JUNSEO gets...)

3249
02:14:43,355 --> 02:14:45,894
(4 votes.)

3250
02:14:46,454 --> 02:14:49,063
Raise your hand if you want MAJINGXIANG to do it.

3251
02:14:49,064 --> 02:14:50,094
(MAJINGXIANG gets 1 vote.)

3252
02:14:50,095 --> 02:14:53,594
Sub vocalist one is JUNSEO.

3253
02:14:53,595 --> 02:14:56,005
I'll work hard. Thank you.

3254
02:14:56,405 --> 02:15:01,344
Then MAJINGXIANG will be sub vocalist two.

3255
02:15:01,345 --> 02:15:02,405
Yes.

3256
02:15:02,605 --> 02:15:06,373
I applied to many positions,

3257
02:15:06,374 --> 02:15:08,044
but didn't get any one of them.

3258
02:15:08,144 --> 02:15:12,185
I got the remaining position. I'm a bit upset about that.

3259
02:15:13,384 --> 02:15:16,755
I don't think there are many parts.

3260
02:15:17,255 --> 02:15:19,425
I just have two lines.

3261
02:15:20,525 --> 02:15:23,063
The important positions, rapper 1 and rapper 2...

3262
02:15:23,064 --> 02:15:24,793
came to the members.

3263
02:15:24,794 --> 02:15:27,165
They came to me and MINWOOK.

3264
02:15:28,005 --> 02:15:31,973
I expected the older members to take...

3265
02:15:31,974 --> 02:15:35,304
the important positions with killer parts.

3266
02:15:35,944 --> 02:15:37,675
It went exactly as I expected.

3267
02:15:38,275 --> 02:15:40,213
As the group called BAE173,

3268
02:15:40,214 --> 02:15:42,984
they have trust in each other.

3269
02:15:42,985 --> 02:15:45,755
So I expected things to go that way.

3270
02:15:48,085 --> 02:15:49,584
This team is ranked high.

3271
02:15:49,585 --> 02:15:50,623
- Seriously. - That's right.

3272
02:15:50,624 --> 02:15:51,925
All the members are ranked high.

3273
02:15:52,054 --> 02:15:53,794
- LYNNLYNN joined last... - LYNNLYNN.

3274
02:15:54,495 --> 02:15:55,693
in terms of the ranking.

3275
02:15:55,694 --> 02:15:57,064
- That's right. - LYNNLYNN.

3276
02:15:57,364 --> 02:16:00,434
I guess there's nothing to worry about as JUNSEO is the leader.

3277
02:16:00,435 --> 02:16:01,665
We depend on you.

3278
02:16:03,235 --> 02:16:04,605
We worked hard.

3279
02:16:04,935 --> 02:16:07,274
Let's watch you dance. Shall we watch your dance?

3280
02:16:07,275 --> 02:16:09,044
- You can do it. - Go for it.

3281
02:16:10,345 --> 02:16:12,144
- You're awesome. - You can do it.

3282
02:16:39,304 --> 02:16:40,844
That's tough.

3283
02:17:01,995 --> 02:17:03,094
It's a legend.

3284
02:17:04,165 --> 02:17:06,564
- They're good. - We can divide this part.

3285
02:17:06,834 --> 02:17:08,134
HYUNWOO has too many parts.

3286
02:17:08,165 --> 02:17:10,264
- MAJINGXIANG can do this too. - Right.

3287
02:17:11,004 --> 02:17:13,474
I think MAJINGXIANG could take more parts.

3288
02:17:13,804 --> 02:17:18,075
There's a part that goes, "I'm so bad guy."

3289
02:17:18,214 --> 02:17:20,514
I thought MAJINGXIANG would take that part...

3290
02:17:20,684 --> 02:17:23,245
because the song goes with him so well.

3291
02:17:23,544 --> 02:17:26,112
If he had taken that part,

3292
02:17:26,114 --> 02:17:28,554
he would have performed it very nicely, I thought.

3293
02:17:31,325 --> 02:17:34,623
First, MAJINGXIANG rarely has his part.

3294
02:17:34,624 --> 02:17:36,994
It's like MAJINGXIANG is not visible.

3295
02:17:36,995 --> 02:17:40,034
But MAJINGXIANG has a nice low voice tone.

3296
02:17:40,864 --> 02:17:43,763
Personally, the chorus part "I'm so bad guy..."

3297
02:17:43,764 --> 02:17:46,433
is also performed by HYUNWOO and MINWOOK in the second verse.

3298
02:17:46,434 --> 02:17:48,174
- Yes. - It's about this part.

3299
02:17:48,644 --> 02:17:50,942
As I see, considering your performances so far,

3300
02:17:50,943 --> 02:17:53,414
YEOJUN and MAJINGXIANG have attractive low voices...

3301
02:17:53,415 --> 02:17:56,044
and this tone-and-manner part goes well with them.

3302
02:17:57,655 --> 02:18:00,554
(With their attractive low voice tones,)

3303
02:18:01,355 --> 02:18:05,193
(JANG YEOJUN and MAJINGXIANG left a strong impression.)

3304
02:18:06,325 --> 02:18:08,494
Rather than having the same organization, you know.

3305
02:18:08,495 --> 02:18:12,934
Is it okay that MAJINGXIANG sings this part, "I'm so bad guy?"

3306
02:18:13,735 --> 02:18:15,004
I'm so bad guy

3307
02:18:17,064 --> 02:18:18,634
I'm so bad guy

3308
02:18:26,114 --> 02:18:27,544
I'm so bad guy

3309
02:18:29,245 --> 02:18:32,084
- He has a nice voice. - He'll look awesome in the center.

3310
02:18:32,214 --> 02:18:34,655
That goes well with him, so I think...

3311
02:18:34,954 --> 02:18:38,093
it would look more attractive with a change like this.

3312
02:18:38,094 --> 02:18:40,324
I think it would be nice if you could do that...

3313
02:18:40,325 --> 02:18:42,263
because MAJINGXIANG has no presence at all.

3314
02:18:42,264 --> 02:18:44,963
Since there are former team members here together,

3315
02:18:44,964 --> 02:18:47,263
you need to add some fresh elements as well...

3316
02:18:47,264 --> 02:18:49,463
to liven up this team as a whole.

3317
02:18:49,464 --> 02:18:51,374
You can take that into consideration.

3318
02:18:51,575 --> 02:18:52,575
Yes.

3319
02:18:53,204 --> 02:18:55,174
After the interim evaluation today,

3320
02:18:55,174 --> 02:18:59,513
we heard the same feedback, "MAJINGXIANG is not visible."

3321
02:18:59,514 --> 02:19:02,985
So I was very worried back then.

3322
02:19:04,155 --> 02:19:07,254
"I hope he shows more presence."

3323
02:19:07,254 --> 02:19:09,284
"I wish the performance was sexier."

3324
02:19:09,655 --> 02:19:13,054
"Compared to his build, he doesn't stand out."

3325
02:19:13,394 --> 02:19:17,793
"If he gets more ambitious, he'll look more visible."

3326
02:19:17,794 --> 02:19:19,134
"It's something that's lacking."

3327
02:19:19,495 --> 02:19:23,304
"Perhaps he doesn't get many parts. I feel he doesn't catch my eyes."

3328
02:19:24,235 --> 02:19:26,174
"I could rarely see him."

3329
02:19:26,634 --> 02:19:28,474
There can be some evaluations...

3330
02:19:28,575 --> 02:19:30,745
such as, "He's good" or "He's poor."

3331
02:19:31,044 --> 02:19:33,112
There are those kinds of comments.

3332
02:19:33,114 --> 02:19:35,683
But there was no feedback like, "He isn't good."

3333
02:19:35,684 --> 02:19:39,184
It felt like, "I don't know" and "Was he in the team?"

3334
02:19:39,714 --> 02:19:43,724
I had a lot of doubts about myself.

3335
02:19:45,254 --> 02:19:47,693
(A short break during practice)

3336
02:19:48,964 --> 02:19:50,665
- Can we go to the restroom? - The restroom?

3337
02:19:52,364 --> 02:19:53,394
Just for a moment.

3338
02:19:56,634 --> 02:19:58,074
I have a question.

3339
02:19:58,075 --> 02:19:59,075
YEOJUN.

3340
02:19:59,304 --> 02:20:00,974
- Can we go to the restroom? - The restroom?

3341
02:20:02,704 --> 02:20:03,704
Just for a moment.

3342
02:20:06,814 --> 02:20:08,244
I have a question.

3343
02:20:08,245 --> 02:20:10,144
YEOJUN.

3344
02:20:10,284 --> 02:20:13,254
- This is your part. - Yes.

3345
02:20:13,255 --> 02:20:15,223
Since I don't have many parts,

3346
02:20:15,224 --> 02:20:17,154
the directors told me to be more aggressive.

3347
02:20:17,155 --> 02:20:20,624
- So I want to ask you, YEOJUN. - Okay.

3348
02:20:21,265 --> 02:20:24,864
Would it be okay if I try this part?

3349
02:20:25,235 --> 02:20:28,234
Do you mean the bridge part that goes, "Baby?"

3350
02:20:28,235 --> 02:20:32,405
Yes, because I don't really have a part in the later section.

3351
02:20:32,835 --> 02:20:34,505
I was very much taken aback,

3352
02:20:34,704 --> 02:20:37,304
but I could feel how desperate he was.

3353
02:20:37,775 --> 02:20:41,344
I also thought, "He must be so desperate..."

3354
02:20:41,345 --> 02:20:42,943
" to ask me personally about it."

3355
02:20:42,944 --> 02:20:45,313
Today's feedback was like,

3356
02:20:45,314 --> 02:20:48,754
"MAJINGXIANG needs to be more ambitious."

3357
02:20:48,755 --> 02:20:50,623
As I got those feedback,

3358
02:20:50,624 --> 02:20:53,995
I thought I should voice out...

3359
02:20:54,064 --> 02:20:55,893
when I don't have many parts.

3360
02:20:55,894 --> 02:20:57,693
I have to survive,

3361
02:20:57,694 --> 02:20:59,764
and I have to do whatever it takes.

3362
02:20:59,765 --> 02:21:01,505
I want to do so.

3363
02:21:02,165 --> 02:21:04,774
Everyone, we'll rearrange...

3364
02:21:04,775 --> 02:21:06,505
- our parts. - Okay.

3365
02:21:06,605 --> 02:21:10,174
"Don't want to try? Don't you deny..."

3366
02:21:10,175 --> 02:21:11,373
should be taken by someone.

3367
02:21:11,374 --> 02:21:13,314
Seeing the choreography,

3368
02:21:13,444 --> 02:21:15,845
it was organized to change parts easily.

3369
02:21:16,015 --> 02:21:18,855
- Can I try too? - Do you want to try, MAJINGXIANG?

3370
02:21:21,655 --> 02:21:25,025
- Crush - Drawn naturally

3371
02:21:25,054 --> 02:21:27,963
Don't want to try? Don't you deny?

3372
02:21:27,964 --> 02:21:30,494
It penetrates

3373
02:21:30,495 --> 02:21:31,664
Sing just up to "deny."

3374
02:21:31,665 --> 02:21:33,694
- Except for "It penetrates." - Yes, don't do that.

3375
02:21:33,964 --> 02:21:36,203
- Don't you deny? - Singing up to "It penetrates..."

3376
02:21:36,204 --> 02:21:38,473
can be an alternative.

3377
02:21:38,474 --> 02:21:40,004
- I can sing "It penetrates." - Okay.

3378
02:21:40,005 --> 02:21:41,643
- Can you do that? - Yes, I can.

3379
02:21:41,644 --> 02:21:43,874
I think it will be better if I do so.

3380
02:21:44,175 --> 02:21:47,143
- You can do it. - I can do it.

3381
02:21:47,144 --> 02:21:49,245
- You can do it. You try it. - Yes.

3382
02:21:49,714 --> 02:21:51,855
I'd like to try...

3383
02:21:52,214 --> 02:21:54,524
the second chorus.

3384
02:21:54,525 --> 02:21:56,655
I want to hear what everyone thinks.

3385
02:21:57,124 --> 02:22:00,224
Then can I try the part, "I approach secretly?"

3386
02:22:00,255 --> 02:22:02,624
Too many "Trigger" parts.

3387
02:22:02,894 --> 02:22:04,964
Is there anyone who wants to take this part?

3388
02:22:05,194 --> 02:22:06,794
(Singing automatically)

3389
02:22:07,435 --> 02:22:08,533
Me.

3390
02:22:08,534 --> 02:22:10,134
Goodness, MAJINGXIANG.

3391
02:22:10,335 --> 02:22:12,304
- You should go home! - No, come on.

3392
02:22:12,374 --> 02:22:13,505
It's understandable he wants to do it.

3393
02:22:13,534 --> 02:22:16,105
It's not that he has everything and he still wants more.

3394
02:22:16,204 --> 02:22:17,374
It's not that I have everything.

3395
02:22:17,644 --> 02:22:20,214
MAJINGXIANG kept trying.

3396
02:22:20,544 --> 02:22:22,015
His low-voice tone Is attractive,

3397
02:22:22,585 --> 02:22:25,784
he has a nice figure, and he's a good dancer.

3398
02:22:25,985 --> 02:22:28,784
So I thought he fits well for the song.

3399
02:22:28,954 --> 02:22:30,754
He wasn't dispirited or intimidated,

3400
02:22:30,755 --> 02:22:33,453
and he did his best to the end,

3401
02:22:33,454 --> 02:22:34,765
so I was glad to see that.

3402
02:22:35,095 --> 02:22:37,293
In fact, when the other show was over,

3403
02:22:37,294 --> 02:22:40,595
I regretted it a lot and felt very sorry for my fans.

3404
02:22:41,335 --> 02:22:43,803
I really want to be on the stage again.

3405
02:22:43,804 --> 02:22:46,074
I want to show my performance to my fans,

3406
02:22:46,075 --> 02:22:48,144
so I feel very desperate...

3407
02:22:48,275 --> 02:22:52,745
and I'd be happy to show them how I grow gradually.

3408
02:22:54,075 --> 02:22:55,783
MAJINGXIANG looks great!

3409
02:22:55,784 --> 02:22:57,345
KANG HYUNWOO!

3410
02:23:03,884 --> 02:23:05,694
(JANG YEOJUN)

3411
02:23:06,894 --> 02:23:08,165
MAJINGXIANG!

3412
02:23:08,564 --> 02:23:10,765
(MAJINGXIANG)

3413
02:23:17,134 --> 02:23:19,204
Since it's a song with my name...

3414
02:23:20,534 --> 02:23:22,005
(They prepare so fiercely...)

3415
02:23:22,374 --> 02:23:23,745
(for their own performances.)

3416
02:23:23,804 --> 02:23:27,544
My fans want to see my "Merry-Go-Round" performance.

3417
02:23:28,515 --> 02:23:29,813
I'm confident.

3418
02:23:29,814 --> 02:23:30,915
(I want to win!)

3419
02:23:31,415 --> 02:23:33,155
(Is it taking the part?)

3420
02:23:33,284 --> 02:23:35,184
Someone who's not good taking the part of someone who's good...

3421
02:23:35,185 --> 02:23:37,155
(Part allocation gets more fierce.)

3422
02:23:37,694 --> 02:23:41,265
(Part arrangement keeps changing.)

3423
02:23:41,724 --> 02:23:42,995
(I'm talking now.)

3424
02:23:43,294 --> 02:23:44,294
(Can't you focus?)

3425
02:23:44,295 --> 02:23:47,034
I'm teaching, but I'm the one who's sweating the most.

3426
02:23:47,265 --> 02:23:48,564
Can you work harder?

3427
02:23:49,204 --> 02:23:52,175
(They get more sensitive as much as they're desperate.)

3428
02:23:52,335 --> 02:23:53,473
What are you doing?

3429
02:23:53,474 --> 02:23:55,303
(For a perfect new song,)

3430
02:23:55,304 --> 02:23:58,175
(he gives a severe directing.)

3431
02:23:59,374 --> 02:24:00,374
(While feeling extreme pressure)

3432
02:24:00,375 --> 02:24:02,085
(What can I do more now?)

3433
02:24:02,814 --> 02:24:03,944
(At last)

3434
02:24:05,054 --> 02:24:09,755
(Performances of new songs in five concepts)

3435
02:24:12,054 --> 02:24:15,325
(From a cheerful perfect group dance performance...)

3436
02:24:17,394 --> 02:24:20,665
(to a performance with a refreshing vibe and nice looks)

3437
02:24:21,464 --> 02:24:23,564
(World Assemblers' hearts are taken.)

3438
02:24:24,534 --> 02:24:27,704
(Which team wins Original Matching?)

3439
02:24:28,175 --> 02:24:33,244
