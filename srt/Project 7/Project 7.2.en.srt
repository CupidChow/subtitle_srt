Assemble and upgrade.

00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:04,980
Welcome to Project 7, where a new world-class boy group will be born.

3
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:06,979
Dear World Assemblers.

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,980
You can vote on the official "Project 7" voting platform...

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,519
once a day.

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,820
Log into the Project 7 forum.

7
00:00:15,189 --> 00:00:17,119
Click on the link to vote.

8
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,460
You can participate in two different votes.

9
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,789
First is the Individual Vote.

10
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:26,399
Among the 100 trainees, choose 7 that you want to support.

11
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:28,499
After the Individual Vote,

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,870
click on "Continue to Next Vote."

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,369
The second is the Assembly Vote.

14
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:37,909
Choose 14 trainees that you'd like to assemble together.

15
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,109
Click on "Vote" to participate.

16
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:44,819
Your votes are submitted only when you complete two votes.

17
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,479
Don't forget to participate in both.

18
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,019
(Project 7, First Global Vote)

19
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,560
(Today's voting result will be revealed after the show.)

20
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:55,530
(The Zero Setting is over.)

21
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:02,229
(A place for the 100 trainees who passed)

22
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,500
(Project Village)

23
00:01:07,069 --> 00:01:09,209
- Hello. - Hello.

24
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,879
- What's this? - Hello.

25
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,680
Gosh, it's a beautiful place.

26
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,280
It's really beautiful.

27
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:17,250
Gosh, this is so cool.

28
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:19,819
The weather is lovely.

29
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:21,890
It's the perfect weather for entering the dormitory.

30
00:01:22,219 --> 00:01:25,119
I'm starting to feel that it's really happening.

31
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,688
Hey.

32
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:28,188
(Project 7 trainees)

33
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:31,959
- Yes, hello! - Hi.

34
00:01:34,129 --> 00:01:35,930
It feels real now.

35
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:39,140
- Let's do well. - I look forward to it.

36
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:43,810
Here we go.

37
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:45,280
- What's this? - My goodness.

38
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,209
- What's this? - Gosh.

39
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,378
- What? - What's all this?

40
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:52,549
(Project Village Supply Point)

41
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,119
It's where we write our resolutions.

42
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,519
- My gosh. - Goodness.

43
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:59,560
- It looks luxurious. - My heart is fluttering.

44
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,158
- Gosh. - It's so cool.

45
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,188
The seats...

46
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:05,098
- There are clothes. - They must be our training uniform.

47
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:06,158
That's nice.

48
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,228
(Training uniforms, what trainees need the most)

49
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,300
This is nice.

50
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,639
I'm so excited.

51
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,938
It feels really strange.

52
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:15,009
Resolutions?

53
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:18,008
We're getting ready for a survival show.

54
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:19,039
It's amazing.

55
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:21,109
I thought,

56
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,519
"I can't believe that it's happening to me."

57
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,949
This should be enough.

58
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,090
It's a proper start.

59
00:02:28,219 --> 00:02:30,889
I'll develop myself here and move higher.

60
00:02:31,789 --> 00:02:35,159
I was half nervous and half excited.

61
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,158
I made it to the top 100, so I'll move higher.

62
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,099
I came here, determined to make my debut.

63
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:44,800
(My name is LEE HANBIN.)

64
00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:48,210
This is very popular these days.

65
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:50,209
- You know this, right? - Of course I do.

66
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,379
It's a tone-up sunscreen, right?

67
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,209
- I'm wearing it today too. - Is it sunscreen?

68
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,418
Yes, it has a plumping effect.

69
00:02:57,419 --> 00:02:58,519
What does that mean?

70
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,948
It makes the lips round and plump.

71
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:01,789
To make the lips rounder?

72
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:05,188
(Applying it for a bright look)

73
00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:07,388
- It has a nice fragrance. - It's moist.

74
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:09,728
It'd be easy for men to carry it around.

75
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:11,199
- I agree. - Nice.

76
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,460
I'll put it on my cheeks.

77
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,969
Hey, it's moist.

78
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,340
They look pretty.

79
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:19,770
- Hello. - I'll give you one.

80
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:21,409
The clothes look nice.

81
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,369
(Training uniforms in 4 colours)

82
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,379
It's very...

83
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,039
The clothes look nice.

84
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,449
I see.

85
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,180
It's yellow.

86
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:32,979
- Do you like your colour? - No.

87
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:37,188
My favourite colours are blue and gray,

88
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:40,119
but she gave me yellow.

89
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,330
I was a little sad.

90
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,429
My least favourite colours are yellow and orange.

91
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,499
Oh, no.

92
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,628
- May I get the blue one? - I'll give you blue.

93
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:49,728
Thank you.

94
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,839
(Trainee LEE HANBIN gets the blue uniform that he wanted.)

95
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,840
Thank you.

96
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:54,240
The colour was pretty.

97
00:03:54,909 --> 00:03:57,679
I thought that we could pick whatever we wanted,

98
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,409
so I was happy to get blue.

99
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,379
I didn't get the colour I wanted.

100
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:05,819
Pink is the best colour for men.

101
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,218
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

102
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:10,219
(WOO HAJOON gets the pink uniform.)

103
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:11,960
Is it gray?

104
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,559
Gray looks good.

105
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,529
- It's really pretty. - Okay, gray.

106
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,529
There's gray. Good choice.

107
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,829
Is the colour based on something?

108
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:23,899
- It's up to you. - Okay.

109
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,040
(He's curious about the meaning of the uniform colours.)

110
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:28,268
I asked them if the colour meant something.

111
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:30,778
They avoided answering the question,

112
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:33,139
so I thought that it must mean something.

113
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:38,149
(With the unknown secret behind the uniform, the distribution ends.)

114
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,818
- What's that? - What's going on?

115
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:43,688
- What's that? - What's happening?

116
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:44,919
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

117
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,758
- What is it? - Goodness.

118
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:48,328
- What's going on? - What's this?

119
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,528
- Goodness. - Gosh.

120
00:04:49,529 --> 00:04:50,660
It looks like a stadium.

121
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,769
I'm so excited.

122
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,399
It's big.

123
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,240
The scale is huge.

124
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,000
- Goodness. - Gosh.

125
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:01,509
What kind of team are we?

126
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,569
Are we on the same team?

127
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:07,050
Should I be wary of other teams when they arrive?

128
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:11,180
Are we being divided into teams? Will there be a team battle?

129
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,719
- Team? - Team Blue?

130
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,990
I don't see other teams.

131
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:18,119
- Gosh. - Goodness.

132
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,189
Hey.

133
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,730
They're yellow.

134
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,588
(Blue and Yellow come to a clash.)

135
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:24,730
What's going on?

136
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,429
Don't say hello. They may be our enemies.

137
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,430
Don't say hello first.

138
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,698
- They look so cute. - Yellow looks pretty.

139
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:33,039
Yellow looks cute.

140
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,470
They're like chicks.

141
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,410
- They're cute. - They're like chicks.

142
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,508
- They're chicks. - Chirp.

143
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:39,540
Hey, chicks.

144
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:42,179
Hello, Chick JUNSEO.

145
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,920
- That's cold. - They're chicks.

146
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,319
They look cute.

147
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,449
People call me Duck,

148
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:48,949
and I don't like it.

149
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:50,689
Yellow is too cute.

150
00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:55,490
Our team is half the size of their team.

151
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,160
- Why is Team Blue so big? - There are many more of them.

152
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:00,398
- Let's go. - Okay.

153
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:02,268
(Gray trainees join them.)

154
00:06:02,269 --> 00:06:04,739
- What? - There are many of them too.

155
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,800
There are many of them too.

156
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,169
It's a big group.

157
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,339
Look down. Don't make any eye contact.

158
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,339
- Gosh. - Why are there so many?

159
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,679
Why are there so many?

160
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,148
- There are many. - There are many of them.

161
00:06:14,149 --> 00:06:16,078
They keep coming out.

162
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,878
- They keep coming out. - Goodness.

163
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,649
They keep coming. Stop.

164
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,948
- Stop coming out. - Look at them.

165
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:23,758
What colour is it? Is it pink?

166
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,088
- Why are we divided? - What could it be?

167
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:27,689
I'm so nervous right now.

168
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:32,099
The lowest number of people was wearing yellow.

169
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,698
I felt nervous...

170
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:36,300
while looking around.

171
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:40,509
(The host appears.)

172
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,310
- Gosh. - It's a celebrity.

173
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,839
He looks flawless.

174
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:48,549
You look handsome.

175
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,919
He looks sexy.

176
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,948
Hello,

177
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:54,789
I'm Lee Soo Hyuk, the MC of Project 7.

178
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,949
Nice to meet you.

179
00:06:57,689 --> 00:06:58,720
Hello.

180
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:01,088
Have you been well?

181
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:02,589
- Yes! - Yes!

182
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:05,499
During the first project, Zero Setting,

183
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,970
among 200 trainees,

184
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:11,040
only 100 of you survived.

185
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:15,068
Among 100 of you, the number of trainees who will debut is...

186
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:17,809
only seven.

187
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,208
I knew it.

188
00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:20,339
(Among 100, only 7 of them will debut.)

189
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:23,749
Only 100 of you will be able...

190
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,850
to continue trying.

191
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:29,089
You're all wearing different colours.

192
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,758
Can you guess what the reason is?

193
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:32,619
- No. - No, not at all.

194
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,620
You really can't?

195
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:34,828
- I have no idea. - No.

196
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,060
I have no idea at all.

197
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:39,730
The colour that you're wearing represents the rank...

198
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,698
that you received from Zero Setting.

199
00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:44,139
(The uniform colour represents their rank.)

200
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:46,198
- Oh, my gosh. - It was our rank.

201
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,969
I knew it.

202
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,068
I knew that it was coming.

203
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:51,209
It's starting now.

204
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:53,079
My heart was beating faster.

205
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,948
Your rank was determined...

206
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:57,779
by the directors from watching your Zero Setting performance.

207
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:00,519
We ranked you based on your performance skills,

208
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:03,889
potential, and potential to upgrade...

209
00:08:04,189 --> 00:08:05,489
when assembled with others.

210
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,229
(Distributed into 4 ranks, S, A, B, and C)

211
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,529
Now,

212
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:12,299
I'll announce the 100 trainee's ranking.

213
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,028
(The trainee's ranking is revealed.)

214
00:08:14,029 --> 00:08:16,169
- Oh, no. - Goodness.

215
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,239
(Nervous)

216
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,800
- Please. - Please.

217
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:20,939
All right.

218
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:24,109
Trainee ANDY who boldly expressed his feelings with a heart...

219
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:27,279
- to Director Bada. - Gosh.

220
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:28,579
- Andy. - Yes?

221
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:33,178
Trainee PARK JUNSEO who made Director Ryan Sewon Jhun sob.

222
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,690
The yellow uniform they're wearing means...

223
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,490
It couldn't be C. I was thinking B.

224
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,129
I was worried that it'd be a low rank.

225
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:43,058
The yellow uniform they're wearing means...

226
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:44,559
(Yellow's rank is...)

227
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,028
Yellow means...

228
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:49,069
(Yellow's rank is...)

229
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:53,398
(S rank.)

230
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,570
It's S rank.

231
00:08:58,610 --> 00:08:59,979
Great job.

232
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,148
- Let's go. - Gosh, we're S rank.

233
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:04,649
- Nice. - We're S rank.

234
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,980
I made it.

235
00:09:05,981 --> 00:09:09,250
I'm off to a good start.

236
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,490
It was surprising. I didn't expect yellow to be S rank.

237
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:14,830
I didn't know how precious it was.

238
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,528
- Yes. - Nice.

239
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:19,128
Nice.

240
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:20,200
Gosh.

241
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,369
Look at the golden colour.

242
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:24,399
I'm so jealous.

243
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:27,308
I was more disappointed than anything.

244
00:09:27,309 --> 00:09:28,740
I felt more ambitious.

245
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,209
My personal colour is a cool colour,

246
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:33,580
so my favourite colour is blue.

247
00:09:33,909 --> 00:09:36,009
But I still wanted to wear yellow.

248
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:39,620
I'll announce the next rank.

249
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:41,990
I think that we're next. Please.

250
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,250
- I hope that it's us. - Please.

251
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,889
- Please. - A.

252
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:47,089
- Please. - LYNNLYNN.

253
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,090
Yes.

254
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:50,158
- MAJINGXIANG. - Yes.

255
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:51,798
(LYNNLYNN, MAJINGXIANG)

256
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,529
- WU CHENYU. - Yes.

257
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,669
- TSUJII RYOMA. - Yes.

258
00:09:56,299 --> 00:09:59,039
Blue, which is what global trainees are wearing...

259
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:03,240
I was hoping that it'd be A rank.

260
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,178
I expected it to be either B or C.

261
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:08,850
- A? - Could it be A?

262
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,278
It's A rank.

263
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:12,048
(Blue's rank is A.)

264
00:10:12,049 --> 00:10:13,379
Good job.

265
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:15,219
- Congratulations. - Yes.

266
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,320
We did well.

267
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:18,758
We did well.

268
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:20,689
- Okay. - We have potential.

269
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:21,759
This is amazing.

270
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:27,700
Only B and the lowest rank, C remain.

271
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:31,070
If you aren't called next, you will automatically be...

272
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:32,639
C rank.

273
00:10:33,669 --> 00:10:35,138
(Which colour will avoid the lowest rank?)

274
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:36,210
B rank is...

275
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,408
- pink. - Gosh.

276
00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:43,479
(B rank is pink.)

277
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,580
That's a relief.

278
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,148
That's a relief.

279
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:49,590
I got ranked lower than expected.

280
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:53,659
I'd be lying if I said that I wasn't disappointed.

281
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:56,029
I will definitely move up.

282
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,359
Automatically, gray is...

283
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,769
C rank, the lowest rank.

284
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,240
- We just need to move up. - It's okay. We'll move up.

285
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,239
It was embarrassing.

286
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:11,340
I tried to show only the best side of me.

287
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:15,579
When the World Assemblers make their vote,

288
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:19,519
the 100 trainees' rank will be very helpful to know.

289
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,490
Your rank has been determined.

290
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,619
I'm sure you're curious...

291
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,720
how much your rank will affect you...

292
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,258
on the upcoming project.

293
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:28,629
- Yes. - Yes.

294
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:31,960
Global votes will determine whether you pass or fail.

295
00:11:32,429 --> 00:11:33,528
The next evaluation is called...

296
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:36,229
(The second project is...)

297
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,740
Title Song.

298
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,638
- Right away? - "Title Song?"

299
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:43,809
- Gosh. - "Title Song."

300
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:45,639
- It's "RUN" - "RUN?"

301
00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:48,710
Goodness.

302
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,980
"RUN."

303
00:11:49,981 --> 00:11:51,048
("RUN")

304
00:11:51,049 --> 00:11:53,849
(The title song is revealed.)

305
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:54,850
I was right.

306
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:01,190
That looks amazing.

307
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:10,840
It looked like refreshing hip-hop. Refreshing intensity.

308
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:12,470
I was happy about it.

309
00:12:12,669 --> 00:12:15,869
I got goosebumps all over my body.

310
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,509
I loved it.

311
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:19,908
The choreography looked amazing.

312
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:22,610
I was determined to make it mine.

313
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,820
Gosh, that's insane.

314
00:12:32,259 --> 00:12:34,190
- It's crazy. - That's amazing.

315
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:35,558
Amazing.

316
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:37,500
- That's incredible. - It's quite difficult.

317
00:12:38,429 --> 00:12:41,168
Director Bada and RyuD...

318
00:12:41,169 --> 00:12:45,299
stayed up all night to come up with the choreography.

319
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,610
- Gosh. - They're the best.

320
00:12:49,309 --> 00:12:51,080
However,

321
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:53,609
all 100 of you can't be onstage equally.

322
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:56,079
- Right. - Of course not.

323
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:00,279
Based on your completion score given by the directors,

324
00:13:00,549 --> 00:13:03,689
your place onstage and part will be given.

325
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:06,190
- Seriously? - Gosh.

326
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:07,389
I want to be in the center.

327
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,258
- Gosh. - Goodness.

328
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:11,028
- This will be intense. - Already?

329
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:14,669
Based on your title song completion score, you'll be placed...

330
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:16,570
(1st Tier Zone)

331
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:17,840
Goodness.

332
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,599
in 1st, 2nd, 3rd Tier Zone.

333
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,639
Gosh.

334
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,440
And Fourth Tier Zone.

335
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,439
I must get to the First Tier Zone.

336
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,378
Trainees in the First Tier Zone will stand in the center.

337
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:31,548
(1st Tier Zone is placed on center stage.)

338
00:13:31,549 --> 00:13:32,619
I must get it no matter what.

339
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:36,048
You'll get the most parts and the spotlight.

340
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:37,119
Gosh.

341
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,359
Here's another reason why you must get...

342
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,929
into the First Tier Zone.

343
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:45,399
Not only will you get the most spotlight onstage,

344
00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:49,069
but also, only one trainee from First Tier Zone...

345
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,128
(1 person who will stand in the highest place)

346
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,970
- Center. - Goodness.

347
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:55,039
- He will be on center stage. - I want to get it.

348
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,740
First Tier Zone? I'll get in no matter what.

349
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,879
I want to go to the First Tier Zone and stand on center stage.

350
00:14:01,179 --> 00:14:02,408
If I'm going to participate,

351
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:05,179
I might as well stand in First Tier Zone.

352
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,480
Lastly,

353
00:14:07,049 --> 00:14:09,619
the trainees who will stand in the Shadow Zone.

354
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,559
- Goodness. - What?

355
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,089
"Shadow Zone?"

356
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:15,489
- This is so cruel. - It breaks my heart.

357
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:19,299
As they lack the skills to be onstage based on the evaluation,

358
00:14:19,429 --> 00:14:22,899
they'll play the shadow of other trainees.

359
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,398
- Gosh. - Goodness.

360
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,470
That will be their role.

361
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:28,509
Trainees in the Shadow Zone...

362
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:31,179
won't sing any parts.

363
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,479
They'll stay in the background.

364
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,309
- This is so brutal. - No way.

365
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:36,950
It's cruel.

366
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:40,719
I thought that the Fourth Tier Zone was the lowest one,

367
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,949
but they came up with something worse.

368
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,360
It's called Shadow Zone.

369
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,519
It's completely offstage.

370
00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:49,459
It's darkness itself.

371
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:53,659
It feels like being in the basement.

372
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,829
Anything but that zone.

373
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:59,100
I thought that I should do everything to avoid that zone.

374
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:00,870
Trainees.

375
00:15:00,871 --> 00:15:04,340
What's the most important thing on Project 7?

376
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,379
- Assemble and upgrade. - Assemble and upgrade.

377
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,179
Assemble and upgrade.

378
00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:11,450
Assembling is the most important aspect of Project 7.

379
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:14,989
Before the World Assemblers start to assemble you,

380
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,990
this Title Song Project will be...

381
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:21,689
based on your own assembly evaluation.

382
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,189
(The trainees' self-assembly evaluation)

383
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,398
- What's that? - Goodness.

384
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:25,559
- That startled me. - Gosh.

385
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:26,929
- What does it mean? - What's this?

386
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,628
- For the parts. - What does it mean?

387
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:30,929
- I don't know. - We're divided into five teams?

388
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,509
Make a team of 20 trainees...

389
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:38,909
whom you think are the best.

390
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,750
During the Title Song Project,

391
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:45,878
you'll find out how impactful assembling is.

392
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:47,179
Assemble successfully and show us...

393
00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:50,849
how upgraded you are as idol singers.

394
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:53,559
(Upgrade as idol singers.)

395
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,960
You'll prepare the title song performance together.

396
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,600
You'll be evaluated.

397
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,230
Your tier will be decided based on the result.

398
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,739
Our tier will be determined as a team.

399
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,769
- I see. - Just...

400
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,669
Please prove your potential...

401
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:12,610
and what you're capable of.

402
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:15,049
- Okay. - Okay.

403
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,850
Now,

404
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:21,750
the Title Song Trainee's Self Assembly...

405
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,388
will begin.

406
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:26,258
(Title Song Trainees' Self Assembly starts.)

407
00:16:26,259 --> 00:16:27,960
- Let's go. - Let's go.

408
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:33,129
- Let's go. - Let's go.

409
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:35,428
You have 30 minutes.

410
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:36,928
- Okay. - Hey,

411
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,099
can we work together?

412
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,970
- Are you good? - I'm good at everything.

413
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:41,639
- Should we invite him? - Thank you.

414
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:43,369
Since our first performance,

415
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,209
- I've only been watching you. - Really?

416
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:46,239
I'm an amazing dancer.

417
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,308
- Really? I'd love to. - He's really good.

418
00:16:48,309 --> 00:16:49,849
- You're the main vocalist. - Right.

419
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,220
- Really? - Yes.

420
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,179
It's hard to beg them to join us.

421
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,089
Since we're C rank,

422
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,690
- it's hard to approach them first. - Right.

423
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:00,289
It's hard to approach others...

424
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:02,189
because of my uniform colour.

425
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,388
Which team will you join?

426
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:06,230
It might be our loss to be on the same team.

427
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:10,130
- You're ranked A, at least. - A rank?

428
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,700
I'm ranked C.

429
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,799
Can I join you?

430
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,809
You're ranked A. I'm ranked B.

431
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:21,950
Since I wasn't ranked high,

432
00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:23,679
I was very worried...

433
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,819
about not getting chosen.

434
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:29,450
I'm ranked C.

435
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:33,259
I couldn't say with confidence...

436
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:36,630
that I wanted to join their team.

437
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,558
- I want SUNGMIN to join us. - Me too.

438
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,529
SUNGMIN is ranked S.

439
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:45,299
What should I say?

440
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,338
We have to find someone who's good.

441
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:49,109
We need a good singer.

442
00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:50,740
What should we do?

443
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,108
(Trainee JEON MINWOOK is watching what's going on.)

444
00:17:55,109 --> 00:17:58,420
When I looked around, everyone was murmuring to themselves.

445
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,979
I saw that they couldn't make up their mind.

446
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,950
Then a small platform was set up behind us.

447
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:07,318
We were told that we were free to use it to show our charms...

448
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:09,258
and what we've got.

449
00:18:09,259 --> 00:18:12,098
I wanted to show them what kind of person I am.

450
00:18:12,099 --> 00:18:13,500
(He goes directly to the Personal Appeal Zone.)

451
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,469
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

452
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,368
- Goodness. - What's going on?

453
00:18:17,369 --> 00:18:20,069
Hello. I'm ranked A.

454
00:18:21,069 --> 00:18:22,339
My name is JEON MINWOOK.

455
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,180
You're handsome.

456
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,649
Here's what I'm good at.

457
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:33,150
I can form a group of 20 in a clever way.

458
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,419
- Really? - You're smart.

459
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:38,419
But in order for me to form a group,

460
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,559
I have to be convincing.

461
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,328
- Yes. - Right.

462
00:18:43,329 --> 00:18:45,730
- All right. - Let's go.

463
00:18:46,029 --> 00:18:47,059
Yes.

464
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,328
(Without much ado, he starts rapping.)

465
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:51,739
It's far, we got the business

466
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,368
Be split, never fit in

467
00:18:53,369 --> 00:18:54,969
Things that stop me

468
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:58,079
(Getting absorbed in real-time)

469
00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:01,109
We see things differently, so we're crooked

470
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,149
(He's convinced them.)

471
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,818
- He's definitely good. - That's impressive.

472
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:07,118
- Goodness. - He's my senior.

473
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:08,450
He's a rapper.

474
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:11,119
I rapped in front of you...

475
00:19:11,589 --> 00:19:13,159
not because I'm a good rapper.

476
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,258
I wanted to show you how confident I am.

477
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:16,689
- That's why. - That's great.

478
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:19,558
Here's what I'd like to tell you.

479
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,799
There are a few trainees whom I'd like to work with.

480
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:24,068
I'll say their names...

481
00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:26,069
and go to number three.

482
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,108
(He's almost proposing to them in public.)

483
00:19:28,109 --> 00:19:30,640
If you agree, please join me.

484
00:19:31,009 --> 00:19:34,209
You're my number one choice.

485
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:36,079
- Thank you. - Gosh.

486
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,479
Let's work together.

487
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,920
(The trainee who was picked as number 1)

488
00:19:40,349 --> 00:19:42,450
(He had strong vocals.)

489
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:44,759
(Trainee KWON YONGHYUN)

490
00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:46,690
(I like this song.)

491
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,759
I'll be with him, so join us.

492
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:53,299
And among those who sang...

493
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:57,199
Crush's "Hmm-cheat,"

494
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,298
who was the main vocalist?

495
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:00,899
- It's JEONGMIN. - Is he here?

496
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,910
- JEONGMIN, it's you. - Here.

497
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:08,410
(With his stable performance,)

498
00:20:09,349 --> 00:20:13,380
(he made a huge impression on the 200 trainees.)

499
00:20:14,049 --> 00:20:15,650
We'd greatly appreciate it...

500
00:20:16,589 --> 00:20:19,558
if KIM JEONGMIN and WOO HAJOON join us.

501
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:20,559
(He picks WOO HAJOON too.)

502
00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:27,758
He said...

503
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,670
that I have an image he seeks...

504
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:33,440
and that I impressed him from the moment he saw me.

505
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:36,339
(During Zero Setting)

506
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:41,480
(Everyone took a good look at WOO HAJOON.)

507
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:44,048
To my standard, he looks the best.

508
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:46,480
- Does he? - I like how he looks.

509
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:49,589
I was mentioned among the three he want to make a team with.

510
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:52,690
I was very glad, happy, and grateful.

511
00:20:53,589 --> 00:20:56,758
He's competent and looks good too.

512
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:58,858
So, considering the performance,

513
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:02,730
I think we'll be able to produce a high-quality performance.

514
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:06,740
I guess over 20 people here will apply.

515
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,940
We need to talk to them and have a meeting.

516
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,809
I sang ENHYPEN's song earlier.

517
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:16,779
(Another group of trainees are looking at this scene.)

518
00:21:17,579 --> 00:21:18,980
That team looks nice. Shall I join them?

519
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,880
I guess they're fine.

520
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:23,048
Shall we organize the best team...

521
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:24,420
or a rival for them?

522
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:25,990
That's what I can't decide.

523
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:29,229
I think it will be fun if we can compete with them.

524
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,288
Do you think so?

525
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,059
- How about we approach them... - Okay.

526
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:34,028
and steal some members? That'll be better.

527
00:21:34,029 --> 00:21:35,670
- That will be fun. - I think that's better.

528
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,868
Are we going to make a new team?

529
00:21:37,869 --> 00:21:38,999
We can create a new team.

530
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,200
- That's a good idea. - You made the right decision.

531
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,369
First of all, who will lead us?

532
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,308
- I'll do that. - Okay. Let's go.

533
00:21:45,309 --> 00:21:46,409
- He looks reliable. - I count on you.

534
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:47,839
- He's reliable. - I can trust you.

535
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:49,410
Let's go, JUNSEO.

536
00:21:49,411 --> 00:21:50,778
- Will you go up the stairs? - Let's go up.

537
00:21:50,779 --> 00:21:52,480
Let's go up, everyone.

538
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,180
- Let's go up. - Okay.

539
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:58,858
(They take the P1 space.)

540
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,660
- I was born in 1999. - Really?

541
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,160
MINWOOK,

542
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:05,430
The ones I wanted to work with...

543
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,369
were YONGHYUN, HAJOON, and you.

544
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:10,569
Do you want to come over?

545
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,140
- Come over where? - We're over there.

546
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:17,869
We have YOUNGSEO, JEONGMIN,

547
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:20,609
HANBIN, and MINSEO.

548
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:24,379
Shall we go over there and talk first?

549
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,979
- I'm curious about who they are. - Okay.

550
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,980
Sure.

551
00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:30,949
Hello.

552
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,459
Hello. Oh, my.

553
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,018
- Hello. - He's here to talk with us.

554
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,258
I came to have a conversation.

555
00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:37,589
I liked your performance.

556
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,799
- Who do you like? - Sorry?

557
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:41,569
I like people with an open heart.

558
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:44,098
What shall we do?

559
00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:45,440
- But... - I don't know.

560
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,409
We don't need to care.

561
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,940
Let's gather more S-rank ones.

562
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,609
Shall we gather more S-rank ones and those who attracted attention?

563
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,979
Let's stay here for the moment.

564
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,149
Yes, let's stay here.

565
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,880
- Have a seat. - Sit here.

566
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,449
- Let's stay seated. - Someone will join us.

567
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:02,450
(The team is disbanded in an instant.)

568
00:23:02,819 --> 00:23:05,959
People who were here went over there,

569
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,359
and the one who was going to make a team here went to others.

570
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,960
It felt like I was going to lose it.

571
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:17,269
I'm not sure if I can say this,

572
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:20,599
but I think it's time to say goodbye...

573
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,709
to the members I came here with.

574
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,440
- Right. - That's right.

575
00:23:25,809 --> 00:23:27,339
Back then, it was hard to decide.

576
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,950
To be honest, what I wanted to do...

577
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,949
was rather than relying on team members,

578
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:36,990
I wanted to do things on my own on this show.

579
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:41,319
That's why I wanted to leave my former team members.

580
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:45,500
But when the competent ones told me to join them in reality,

581
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:48,400
I was confused and didn't know what to do.

582
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:51,199
- That's a good plan too. - It's a challenge to me.

583
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,239
You said it right.

584
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,338
(It's getting harder to decide.)

585
00:23:53,339 --> 00:23:55,768
But I think, up to the first performance,

586
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:57,338
it's nice to build the strongest team.

587
00:23:57,339 --> 00:23:58,980
- Like Avengers, from the beginning? - Yes.

588
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:01,609
Well begun is half done, you know.

589
00:24:01,849 --> 00:24:03,709
- That matters. - Right.

590
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,450
- We need to take the first place. - We need to be on top.

591
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:08,720
But thinking about the First Tier Zone, the center,

592
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:11,049
and the Shadow Zone,

593
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:14,419
I couldn't try a tough challenge.

594
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,429
(He gave up.)

595
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:17,929
- Now, how many... - How many are here?

596
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:20,759
Wait. Shall I count?

597
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:22,999
- We have 22 people. - What?

598
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,839
Then let's speak in turn.

599
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,970
Talk about your strengths.

600
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,739
I think if each of us does that,

601
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,239
- it will take too much time. - Right.

602
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,078
- Let's choose one we can trust, - Good.

603
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:37,308
- and he can pick the members. - He can do that.

604
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,319
Great.

605
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,849
Since too many boys wanted to join,

606
00:24:41,819 --> 00:24:43,049
someone proposed to pick a leader...

607
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,759
so that he could select members.

608
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,359
So everyone voted...

609
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:52,058
for someone to temporarily lead us.

610
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:53,159
And MINWOOK was chosen.

611
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:57,730
So MINWOOK became our temporary leader.

612
00:24:58,069 --> 00:25:00,598
Okay. Now JEON MINWOOK is our leader.

613
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:03,910
I hope you assemble a great team.

614
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,679
- All right. - Let's assemble now.

615
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,680
- Then... - Let's do it.

616
00:25:06,681 --> 00:25:07,838
Let's head down first.

617
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,778
We'll go down.

618
00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:11,479
I might look authoritative.

619
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,679
You're the assembly expert now.

620
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,680
Just like this.

621
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,749
Say, "Trainee John Doe, come out!"

622
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,250
- Say, "You come out!" - Okay.

623
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:20,889
- First, YONGHYUN. - Thank you.

624
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:24,758
YONGHYUN, JEONGMIN,

625
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:25,960
- HYUNWOO. - Yes!

626
00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:28,029
- I feel bad. - It's okay.

627
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,999
(KIM HYUNWOO is yet to be assembled.)

628
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,470
And JEONG DEUNHAESOL,

629
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,599
YEOJUN,

630
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:36,409
and HAJOON.

631
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,869
(JEONG DEUNHAESOL, JANG YEOJUN, and WOO HAJOON join.)

632
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,838
HYUNWOO and JUNSEO.

633
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:41,849
(KIM HYUNWOO and PARK JUNSEO join.)

634
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,079
ANDY.

635
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,480
YOUNGSEO.

636
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,348
You have ten minutes left.

637
00:25:47,349 --> 00:25:48,749
I'll choose MINSEO.

638
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,750
(ANDY, YOO YOUNGSEO, and KANG MINSEO join.)

639
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,719
(Over half of P1 is organized instantly.)

640
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,589
Those who impressed me by their performances...

641
00:25:55,859 --> 00:25:58,460
began to concentrate in one spot.

642
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,559
And the spots were being filled.

643
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,099
So I thought hard and suggested them myself.

644
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:05,299
Can I show you what I got?

645
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,000
Can you do that?

646
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:09,409
First encounters are always so hard

647
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:11,979
(Starting to sing)

648
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,779
My name is

649
00:26:14,609 --> 00:26:15,710
That was nice.

650
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,380
Can I try too?

651
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:21,788
- Yes. - Please make it quick and short.

652
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:22,818
Okay.

653
00:26:22,819 --> 00:26:25,018
After all the pain melts

654
00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:28,788
(A mini audition is open, all of a sudden.)

655
00:26:28,789 --> 00:26:30,059
A whole new me

656
00:26:36,569 --> 00:26:38,798
I did my best to join the team.

657
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,069
That made me more nervous than the first project.

658
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:45,509
I wanted to join them, so I showed my strengths.

659
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:50,849
It was just like a battlefield. It was so fierce.

660
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:54,118
They were so desperate, and I wanted to select them.

661
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:55,250
But I had no power.

662
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,018
Everyone tried to show their competence.

663
00:26:58,019 --> 00:27:00,059
They seemed to be better singers...

664
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,029
and dancers than me.

665
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:06,229
And they were so desperate and did their best,

666
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:08,160
so I felt very bad for them.

667
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:10,629
So I tried to pick...

668
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,368
those who tried to show their strength,

669
00:27:12,369 --> 00:27:14,939
because doing that requires a lot of courage,

670
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:15,970
aside from their competence.

671
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,709
You're the one who performed first.

672
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,109
- Yes. - Here.

673
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,210
Thank you.

674
00:27:22,211 --> 00:27:23,308
(Starting from OH TAEHWAN)

675
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:26,318
- And... - You have five minutes left.

676
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:28,348
- I'll choose HYOJIN. - Thank you.

677
00:27:28,349 --> 00:27:29,950
HYOJIN and...

678
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:31,859
- INJAE, - Yes.

679
00:27:32,259 --> 00:27:33,318
HYEONSEOK,

680
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:34,960
- Yes. Thank you. - How about that guy?

681
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:38,130
I select DOHUN, HANBIN,

682
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:40,529
and JUNWOO.

683
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,230
JUNWOO.

684
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:44,969
- Thank you. - Are we all set?

685
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,339
- Right. It's set. - It's done.

686
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,809
- We're done. - Thank you.

687
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,639
- Thank you. - You're a great leader.

688
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,079
- I'll do my best this time. - Have a seat.

689
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,309
All the S-rank members are gathered there.

690
00:27:57,549 --> 00:27:58,819
They gathered among themselves.

691
00:28:00,819 --> 00:28:02,720
P1 is like the Avengers.

692
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,319
I think P1 is the strongest.

693
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,089
P1 is the strongest team.

694
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,730
There are no C-rank trainees.

695
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,559
On average, their ranks are high.

696
00:28:13,829 --> 00:28:17,130
And I know that the team has good dancers.

697
00:28:17,569 --> 00:28:19,900
The P1 members are really good.

698
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,140
I need to keep my eye on them.

699
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:27,539
It feels like all the good members are in that team.

700
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:29,950
Other contending teams...

701
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:33,048
might think, "PI is so good..."

702
00:28:33,049 --> 00:28:34,319
and it can demoralize them.

703
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,989
So, we're confident,

704
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:41,289
and I think we're a mighty team.

705
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:44,029
If we can't get into First Tier Zone with these members,

706
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,859
- we're in big trouble. - That's true.

707
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,630
Why are you an S rank?

708
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:52,539
I don't know. I opened my eyes and I got an S rank.

709
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:54,939
I'll spread my wings.

710
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,269
What are we going to do?

711
00:28:56,369 --> 00:28:58,038
I think...

712
00:28:58,039 --> 00:28:59,279
I thought, "I'm in big trouble."

713
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,210
"Would anyone take me?"

714
00:29:02,509 --> 00:29:04,879
There were so many people who were skilled...

715
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,150
and had great looks.

716
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:10,750
I wondered whether they would want to build a team with me.

717
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,920
Shall we begin first?

718
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,859
We can cast members here. What do you think?

719
00:29:17,829 --> 00:29:21,758
First, we need someone who can learn the dance moves.

720
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:22,868
I can follow the video.

721
00:29:22,869 --> 00:29:25,670
(In fact, their Zero Setting performances...)

722
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,039
(You shouldn't dance like that.)

723
00:29:34,809 --> 00:29:36,849
(Their dances were bitterly criticized.)

724
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:40,079
(When the title song was revealed)

725
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:45,690
What worried me was that the choreography was too tough.

726
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:48,390
I'm not sure how much practice I will need.

727
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:50,930
We need a dancer.

728
00:29:50,931 --> 00:29:52,129
(Having a member who can dance is their priority.)

729
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:53,329
Wait.

730
00:29:56,069 --> 00:29:57,769
We'll have to make do without it.

731
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,200
Are you good at dancing?

732
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:02,209
I'm Japanese.

733
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:04,139
- Are you good at dancing? - Yes.

734
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,880
Good. Okay. You're in.

735
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,739
Good. SUNGMIN!

736
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,349
- SUNGMIN. - Do you learn dance moves quickly?

737
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:13,220
Are you good at learning dance moves?

738
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,650
Yellow, blue, yellow, blue...

739
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:20,359
I'm not that skilled.

740
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:23,490
I wanted to build a team that would learn and grow.

741
00:30:23,589 --> 00:30:25,328
So I brought in various members...

742
00:30:25,329 --> 00:30:27,500
who are good at rap, singing, and dance.

743
00:30:28,099 --> 00:30:29,328
(Looking at empty slots in the teams)

744
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:32,140
But I think P4 is fine too.

745
00:30:32,869 --> 00:30:34,139
- What? - P4.

746
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,140
(The P4 space is empty.)

747
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,140
Shall we go there?

748
00:30:37,009 --> 00:30:38,440
Shall we go there?

749
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,808
Let's go up to P4.

750
00:30:39,809 --> 00:30:40,809
Let's stay there.

751
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:44,209
I don't know what to do.

752
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:45,380
(4 members join P4.)

753
00:30:48,819 --> 00:30:52,389
Since I was a C rank, I was just standing there.

754
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:56,230
But there were many guys who wanted to join SUNGMIN.

755
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:59,329
Who's the one you want to be on the same team?

756
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:01,969
- KIM SUNGMIN. - I want to build a team...

757
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:03,129
with KIM SUNGMIN.

758
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:05,440
He looks just like an idol. I'm sure he can make a debut.

759
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:09,669
He looks so good that I really want to be on his team.

760
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:12,039
(Rushing)

761
00:31:12,609 --> 00:31:14,338
- Did you perform "90's Love?" - The main vocalist.

762
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:16,079
- Right. - You're such a good singer.

763
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:18,880
- Do you want to join us? - Yes.

764
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,048
- Are you a good dancer? - Who do you need?

765
00:31:21,049 --> 00:31:22,848
- I'm a good singer. - We want a good dancer.

766
00:31:22,849 --> 00:31:24,719
We don't have a rapper, do we?

767
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,318
- Who's a good rapper? - Me.

768
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:29,289
- Do you want to join us? - Yes.

769
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:31,089
We need a dancer!

770
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:32,798
We're not good at dancing. We can only sing.

771
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,400
- Here. - Please come here.

772
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:38,129
There were no trainees I wanted to avoid.

773
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:40,769
They were all the trainees that I wanted to be with.

774
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:42,839
Members wanted!

775
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:46,239
We want people with talent, who are good at singing,

776
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,939
dancing, and rapping.

777
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,149
Do you need someone good at performance?

778
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:51,609
- Yes, of course. - I can rap and dance.

779
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:53,750
What's that?

780
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,618
That's great. We need you.

781
00:31:55,619 --> 00:31:57,390
- I'm good at performance too. - That's perfect.

782
00:31:58,759 --> 00:32:00,059
You have ten minutes left.

783
00:32:00,289 --> 00:32:01,759
We need two more people.

784
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,660
I need one more Japanese.

785
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:05,960
Anyone who's Japanese?

786
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:08,769
We want someone good at Japanese.

787
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:10,970
Are you good at Japanese?

788
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:14,338
- Here. - Can you speak Japanese?

789
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:16,069
- You can speak Japanese? - Right. Here.

790
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:17,838
I'll join you.

791
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:19,039
(ABE YURA, a Japanese trainee joins.)

792
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,409
Now we need someone who can show off his talent.

793
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:23,848
Me! I can show off!

794
00:32:23,849 --> 00:32:25,348
Seriously. I can do it.

795
00:32:25,349 --> 00:32:26,749
- HYUNGSEOK. - I mean it.

796
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:29,190
I definitely can liven up the mood.

797
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:31,848
- I'll do my best. - We need more members.

798
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:34,358
- How many dancers do we have? - Ten minutes left.

799
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:35,359
Dancers, raise your hand.

800
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:37,489
- Singers. - Singers, raise your hand.

801
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:38,558
Next, rappers.

802
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,298
- Rappers, raise your hand. - Those who are good at rapping.

803
00:32:40,299 --> 00:32:41,959
- Rappers. - Good rappers.

804
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,970
Rappers.

805
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:45,000
I can write lyrics too.

806
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:46,839
- Please show us. - Okay.

807
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,469
Like headbutting the ground, I'm full of passion

808
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,608
I'm more precious than any treasure

809
00:32:53,609 --> 00:32:56,379
I can accomplish anything if I put my mind to it

810
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,979
(Focusing)

811
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,149
I believe I can do it

812
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,779
Full of faith in myself, one, two

813
00:33:03,619 --> 00:33:05,660
(His spirit is recognized.)

814
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,989
He's good.

815
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:09,460
You were confident in front of a camera,

816
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,189
so I think you can do well.

817
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:13,058
(CHOI JUYOUNG joins them last.)

818
00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:15,029
- Hi. - Thank you.

819
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:16,899
(P4 has assembled 20 trainees.)

820
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,939
Please sit down.

821
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:21,068
Let's do our best.

822
00:33:21,069 --> 00:33:22,508
We can do well, right?

823
00:33:22,509 --> 00:33:25,169
Our team is well-balanced.

824
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:28,210
It's a balanced team with singers, dancers, and rappers.

825
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:31,079
And we have members of various ranks.

826
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:32,920
So we don't lack anything.

827
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,250
I think it's perfect.

828
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,519
I think we might be the strongest.

829
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,689
Is anyone confident in his dance?

830
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:40,690
(Looking for P3 dance members)

831
00:33:40,691 --> 00:33:42,429
Someone who has smooth dance moves.

832
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:43,460
Come here.

833
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:45,598
Are your moves good?

834
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:47,098
Are your moves good?

835
00:33:47,099 --> 00:33:49,068
- Someone with great dancing. - Who's confident in dancing?

836
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:50,130
Anyone with good moves?

837
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:53,439
We can't figure it out now, so we can only trust you.

838
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,440
I guarantee.

839
00:33:54,869 --> 00:33:55,869
Can I show you first?

840
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,609
- Yes. - Okay.

841
00:33:58,309 --> 00:34:01,809
I just need to be a good ingredient.

842
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:03,749
So I danced in front of them.

843
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,980
- Please take a look. - We'll watch.

844
00:34:06,049 --> 00:34:07,049
Okay.

845
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,988
- Okay. - Okay. That's enough.

846
00:34:09,989 --> 00:34:12,219
- Okay. - I think that's enough.

847
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,090
There were so many talented people.

848
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:22,630
That's how we gathered team members.

849
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:26,069
- Okay. I think that was enough. - Let's go.

850
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,800
Let's move over there.

851
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,840
(They confirmed his skills.)

852
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,110
(ASAKA KOTARO, KIM JIMIN)

853
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,110
(KANG WANGSEOK, YOO HYEONSEUNG)

854
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:34,079
(They're recruited.)

855
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,349
We're mainly looking for dancers.

856
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:38,920
JIN!

857
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,420
(MANABE JIN, a foreign member, is additionally recruited.)

858
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:48,219
I think now we need singers and rappers.

859
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:50,989
Do we have a vocalist here?

860
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:55,570
We have no vocalist now.

861
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:59,570
We gathered those who could dance.

862
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,599
Since we need vocalists too...

863
00:35:02,469 --> 00:35:04,968
As we had to gather 20 people,

864
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:06,179
it was harder than I thought.

865
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:10,309
Does any team need a vocalist?

866
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:12,780
I can sing for you.

867
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,349
To be honest, those in C rank...

868
00:35:16,449 --> 00:35:18,789
would have thought the same thing as me.

869
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,030
They'd want to be with people in higher ranks,

870
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,500
survive together, learn from them,

871
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,800
and show that they're growing.

872
00:35:28,329 --> 00:35:30,800
But from the higher-ranking people's perspectives,

873
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:34,900
I thought they would have no reason to select us.

874
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:37,610
I can do my best with all my heart.

875
00:35:38,409 --> 00:35:40,139
I'm someone who puts effort until I achieve something.

876
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:41,610
I guarantee I can do well.

877
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,848
If I have a charm that I can guarantee...

878
00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:45,380
that I'm better than others,

879
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,119
I need to reveal it, I thought.

880
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:51,820
It's all right, let's go to my place

881
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,218
It's all right, without anyone knowing

882
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:57,589
(Attracting...)

883
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,130
(attention)

884
00:35:59,659 --> 00:36:03,400
(I need to endure it.)

885
00:36:05,269 --> 00:36:07,638
(Let's go to my place)

886
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:09,309
To my place

887
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:12,510
I needed to join a team who accepted me.

888
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,039
So I was in a rush.

889
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:16,848
(Staring)

890
00:36:16,849 --> 00:36:19,419
Many people want to join, but they can't.

891
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,449
Did you decide on your team?

892
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,550
- Excuse me? - Have you decided?

893
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:23,550
No, not yet.

894
00:36:23,551 --> 00:36:25,590
But my dance...

895
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:29,089
needs to improve a lot. I need someone who can teach me.

896
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:30,090
- We can help. - I can teach you.

897
00:36:30,091 --> 00:36:31,229
- We can all do that. - It's okay.

898
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,659
- Really? - We're all capable of that.

899
00:36:32,829 --> 00:36:34,328
We can teach you everything.

900
00:36:34,329 --> 00:36:35,329
How much time do we have left?

901
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:36,800
(Stunned)

902
00:36:37,269 --> 00:36:38,269
I'll join you.

903
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,340
All you have to do is sing. Join us.

904
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,099
Honestly, I was so glad to hear that offer.

905
00:36:42,539 --> 00:36:44,908
- I'll do my best. I mean it. - Thank you. I'll teach you well.

906
00:36:44,909 --> 00:36:47,078
- I'll do my best. - Thank you.

907
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,110
I felt grateful.

908
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:50,379
I'll sleep less and do my best to be in the First Tier.

909
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,880
(AHN JUNWON joins P3.)

910
00:36:52,579 --> 00:36:53,819
(They still lack vocalists.)

911
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,479
I'm sure that team is incomplete too.

912
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,749
You have five minutes left.

913
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:57,889
I'm sure they'll be out.

914
00:36:58,989 --> 00:37:01,920
(5 minutes left)

915
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,928
We can't just stand here and do nothing.

916
00:37:04,929 --> 00:37:06,099
We need to recruit members quickly.

917
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,969
I need to be with a good dancer.

918
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:14,239
I'm in B rank.

919
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:16,569
Since I was wearing a B-rank shirt,

920
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:19,139
it seemed that everything I said wasn't accepted as persuasive.

921
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:21,609
- Can I try? - Yes.

922
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:22,979
(Trainee NAM JIWOON)

923
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:25,880
My voice tone is nice and it lingers in your memory.

924
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:27,919
Are you a good dancer too?

925
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,349
I'm a pretty good dancer.

926
00:37:29,449 --> 00:37:30,619
I'm confident.

927
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:35,320
I guess P1 is like the Avengers.

928
00:37:36,489 --> 00:37:38,260
It was hard for me to join them.

929
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,928
- Why are they just watching? - Are they waiting?

930
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:43,500
There are people waiting there.

931
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,039
JIWOON.

932
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,299
Come with me. Let's do our best.

933
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,939
If we cooperate, we can surely beat them.

934
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,940
- P3? - Yes.

935
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:53,710
It's a group of dancers.

936
00:37:53,809 --> 00:37:54,979
- We can beat them. - Let's go.

937
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,678
- It's possible. - Yes.

938
00:37:56,679 --> 00:37:58,880
- What shall I do? - If our singers...

939
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:00,379
learn to dance...

940
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,550
You can be a hero here.

941
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:06,519
At that moment, I thought, "Yes, I should join people who need me."

942
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,859
- We have 3 spots left. - JIWOON, we have 3 spots left.

943
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,058
- JIWOON! - We have three spots left.

944
00:38:10,059 --> 00:38:11,059
JIWOON!

945
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,999
I thought, cooperating well...

946
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,129
would influence each other better.

947
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:16,499
JIWOON, we have only three spots left.

948
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,500
- JIWOON! - Let's go.

949
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,500
JIWOON.

950
00:38:19,369 --> 00:38:20,369
Thank you.

951
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:21,900
They're coming.

952
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,709
You have three minutes left.

953
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,579
(Hurrying)

954
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,609
- Let's try it. - We're completed.

955
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:30,610
I don't know how it ended up like this.

956
00:38:30,611 --> 00:38:32,279
- We're done. - We can do it!

957
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,379
- Way to go! - Way to go!

958
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,550
(Anyway, way to go for P3.)

959
00:38:36,619 --> 00:38:37,788
In fact, in our team,

960
00:38:37,789 --> 00:38:40,119
the one in S rank is a foreigner.

961
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,590
We have two members in A rank,

962
00:38:43,659 --> 00:38:45,630
and only two in C rank, including me.

963
00:38:46,829 --> 00:38:48,559
We have so many members in B rank.

964
00:38:49,469 --> 00:38:50,929
First of all, we have many members who are good dancers.

965
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,199
So I can learn a lot from them in respect to dance.

966
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:57,809
If JIWOON and I can be a lot of help in singing,

967
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:01,308
the team's overall balance will probably level up.

968
00:39:01,309 --> 00:39:02,780
(Would P3 be able to level up?)

969
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:06,679
Here's a singer. I can sing for you.

970
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:10,090
RYOMA, what shall I do?

971
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:13,320
(He's faced with a huge hurdle as soon as he entered Project Village.)

972
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:16,559
It's really hard. Yes.

973
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,860
(LIN WEI CHEN from Taipei)

974
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,329
I was nervous.

975
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:23,670
Yes.

976
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:26,739
- When you sing... - You have anyone in mind?

977
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,069
I...

978
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,210
(Ignoring)

979
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:31,308
(SVIAT from Ukraine)

980
00:39:31,309 --> 00:39:34,178
Doing this...

981
00:39:34,179 --> 00:39:36,949
made me so sad.

982
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,849
I'm sad.

983
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:40,920
I think I'll be sad.

984
00:39:42,349 --> 00:39:44,518
It's so hard.

985
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:45,889
(LYNNLYNN from China)

986
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:47,820
But I...

987
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:51,260
have confidence.

988
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:53,959
One, two, three, four.

989
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,868
(Assembling non-Korean trainees)

990
00:39:55,869 --> 00:39:57,030
One, two, three, four.

991
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:59,300
Come.

992
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,038
Adam.

993
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:02,639
(The foreign group is getting bigger.)

994
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,669
Hey, could I join...

995
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,980
Wait. Let me think a little.

996
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:10,449
First off... Hey.

997
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:13,420
- Let's go. - Let's go.

998
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,319
(LYNNLYNN is gathering Korean trainees too.)

999
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,949
- You were born in 2008? - Yes, 2008.

1000
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:20,488
I was so flustered, wondering if I wouldn't be chosen.

1001
00:40:20,489 --> 00:40:23,159
Then, LYNNLYNN brought me to his group.

1002
00:40:23,389 --> 00:40:24,659
I was glad.

1003
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:28,158
- Finally. - How...

1004
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,669
- What should we do? - What are you good at?

1005
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,230
I guess we have to play mind games here.

1006
00:40:31,869 --> 00:40:34,538
It was my first time self-assembling.

1007
00:40:34,539 --> 00:40:36,309
When I heard the rules, I thought...

1008
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:39,069
I needed to do well for our team to move up to First Tier.

1009
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:41,510
I just told myself to dedicate myself more.

1010
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:45,480
I was following SEUNGHO.

1011
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:48,449
There's this trainee named YANGWOO. We became close during Zero Setting.

1012
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:51,750
Fortunately, the three of us received the A rank.

1013
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:53,259
Let's go over there first.

1014
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,090
(YANGWOO, SEYUN, and SEUNGHO are assembled.)

1015
00:40:56,659 --> 00:40:57,789
What do you think?

1016
00:40:58,059 --> 00:41:00,328
- I'd like to team up with you. - You're good at dancing.

1017
00:41:00,329 --> 00:41:01,960
- You're good. - You're good at singing.

1018
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:03,829
Of the 100 trainees,

1019
00:41:03,969 --> 00:41:07,198
I thought YANGWOO was handsome...

1020
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:10,409
the moment I saw him.

1021
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:11,939
- You want to team up with us? - Okay.

1022
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,780
- We're together. - I see.

1023
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,879
Should we go to P5?

1024
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,750
- P5? - Okay.

1025
00:41:19,449 --> 00:41:22,250
(They take their places at P5.)

1026
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:24,348
- Who's good at dancing? - Me.

1027
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:25,690
- Dance. - Lead dancers.

1028
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,559
Lead vocalists. Vocalists.

1029
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:30,259
We don't have enough vocalists.

1030
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,459
We need vocalists.

1031
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,459
We need more vocal trainees.

1032
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,130
- I think I can. - Okay.

1033
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:37,699
Who's good at singing?

1034
00:41:37,969 --> 00:41:39,129
We need a lead vocalist.

1035
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,468
(YOUNGWOONG of B rank assembles with P5.)

1036
00:41:40,469 --> 00:41:42,138
- Come on. - Let's go.

1037
00:41:42,139 --> 00:41:43,309
- Yes! - Yes.

1038
00:41:43,369 --> 00:41:44,839
- Come on. - And...

1039
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,909
I better join them. Okay.

1040
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:49,480
- A vocalist. - Me. Can I join you?

1041
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:51,049
- Are you good with the position? - Yes.

1042
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,109
What about dancing?

1043
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:54,050
- I'm good at dancing. - Really?

1044
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:56,090
Should we stand in 5 lines of 4?

1045
00:41:57,019 --> 00:41:58,988
Well...

1046
00:41:58,989 --> 00:42:00,460
Tell the trainees at the back.

1047
00:42:00,659 --> 00:42:03,130
(It's as if his dance blocks him from understanding Korean.)

1048
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:04,959
You can't sing super high?

1049
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,899
I can sing high, but a little bit.

1050
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,530
Oh, okay. It's the same.

1051
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:12,129
I told them about 100 times...

1052
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:13,900
to stand in 5 lines of 4.

1053
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:16,968
Still, I was grateful that they came,

1054
00:42:16,969 --> 00:42:19,940
so I decided to give it a go with them.

1055
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:22,440
But there are too many non-Koreans.

1056
00:42:23,309 --> 00:42:26,649
Trainees from various countries...

1057
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:27,848
became our team.

1058
00:42:27,849 --> 00:42:29,519
I'm a little worried about that.

1059
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:34,090
(Meanwhile, Chen of S rank is wandering around.)

1060
00:42:35,059 --> 00:42:36,789
We only have high rankers.

1061
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:39,599
It won't be fun, then.

1062
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:41,098
- All the high rankers are here. - Don't you think it'd be nice...

1063
00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:42,669
to have one of the S rankers?

1064
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:43,969
- Right. - We don't have any S rankers.

1065
00:42:44,969 --> 00:42:46,369
There are too many A rankers here.

1066
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:48,368
I'll go find one.

1067
00:42:48,369 --> 00:42:50,768
Just one.

1068
00:42:50,769 --> 00:42:51,840
Okay.

1069
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:55,579
- That team is not bad. - Hey.

1070
00:42:57,210 --> 00:43:00,349
You have five minutes left.

1071
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:03,889
(P5 needs 1 S ranker.)

1072
00:43:07,489 --> 00:43:08,989
You have 20 trainees?

1073
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:10,329
- No. - Not yet.

1074
00:43:10,429 --> 00:43:11,729
- Let me join you. - Gosh.

1075
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:13,730
- Sure. - Sure, come.

1076
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:16,399
(YICHEN of S rank assembles with P5.)

1077
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,229
- YICHEN! - Gosh.

1078
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:20,070
- YICHEN! - Gosh.

1079
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:22,199
What? What happened?

1080
00:43:22,469 --> 00:43:24,039
An S ranker volunteered to join us.

1081
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:26,079
- Really? Thanks. - We got lucky.

1082
00:43:26,539 --> 00:43:30,250
Four people in each line.

1083
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:32,780
I was so glad...

1084
00:43:32,849 --> 00:43:35,820
that I got goosebumps all over my body.

1085
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:38,319
Above all, I can translate Korean!

1086
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,190
- Yes! - Yes!

1087
00:43:40,289 --> 00:43:42,618
I'll help us place first no matter what.

1088
00:43:42,619 --> 00:43:43,689
Okay.

1089
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:46,698
We'll seize the center positions and everything for sure.

1090
00:43:46,699 --> 00:43:48,328
Trust me.

1091
00:43:48,329 --> 00:43:49,670
- You can count on me. - Let's go.

1092
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:52,400
I was so excited...

1093
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:54,670
and happy.

1094
00:43:55,639 --> 00:43:58,269
I need to aim high to take action.

1095
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:00,980
My goal is to reach First Tier.

1096
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:05,380
We'll never stay in Shadow Zone.

1097
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:07,619
(In the beginning of Self Assembly)

1098
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:09,949
What do we do?

1099
00:44:10,389 --> 00:44:12,250
Beats me. This is...

1100
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,920
So a tier will be given to teams, not individuals.

1101
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:18,690
In this case, we're not likely to be chosen.

1102
00:44:18,829 --> 00:44:21,130
- Right. - Because we're C rankers.

1103
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,900
Goodness.

1104
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:24,900
I feel lost.

1105
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:28,868
They won't lose anything even if they don't choose us.

1106
00:44:28,869 --> 00:44:30,908
We better see what they're missing...

1107
00:44:30,909 --> 00:44:32,809
- and sell ourselves. - We should promote ourselves.

1108
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,538
If you don't need me to show you on stage,

1109
00:44:34,539 --> 00:44:35,839
do you want me to dance here next to you?

1110
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:39,579
Hello. I'm CHANYONG of C rank.

1111
00:44:40,449 --> 00:44:43,449
(A customized choice of song)

1112
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:46,989
(The C rankers are doing their best to promote themselves.)

1113
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:49,260
Do you only need performing skills?

1114
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:51,130
- Just performing skills... - Yes, for now.

1115
00:44:51,659 --> 00:44:53,859
They're dancers here.

1116
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:54,999
- I'll ask. - A dancer here.

1117
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,530
- Here's a dancer. - A dancer.

1118
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:57,999
How did it go?

1119
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,968
We'll have to discuss one more time.

1120
00:45:00,969 --> 00:45:02,698
- Okay. - Look for another team while we do.

1121
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:04,010
- Okay. - Just a moment.

1122
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:06,139
Should I go there?

1123
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:10,209
Everyone was rolling their eyes and wandering around...

1124
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:12,549
without knowing what to do...

1125
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:16,289
as if they were the fifth wheel.

1126
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,159
Gosh, HEEDO.

1127
00:45:21,289 --> 00:45:22,319
Here.

1128
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,689
(HEEDO stands on Personal Appeal Zone.)

1129
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:24,828
I thought I'd rather...

1130
00:45:24,829 --> 00:45:28,158
take in some trainees I could...

1131
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:32,000
and make a dark horse team with them.

1132
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:34,269
I've been an idol for ten years.

1133
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,139
I'm quite experienced...

1134
00:45:37,309 --> 00:45:39,639
in survival TV programs.

1135
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:42,780
If you're determined to make effort...

1136
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,808
but need some kind of help,

1137
00:45:44,809 --> 00:45:47,218
I'd like you to join me...

1138
00:45:47,219 --> 00:45:50,119
so we can make an awesome performance together.

1139
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:51,820
What's your position?

1140
00:45:51,889 --> 00:45:53,459
Can I say hi?

1141
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,488
What's your position?

1142
00:45:55,489 --> 00:45:56,589
(Other trainees are gathering eventually.)

1143
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:58,559
Dancing? Singing? Can you sing a bit?

1144
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:00,860
Can you sing anything at ease?

1145
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:04,469
(The experienced C ranker evaluates trainees on the spot.)

1146
00:46:04,699 --> 00:46:06,368
I think he's not bad.

1147
00:46:06,369 --> 00:46:07,599
- Me too. - Good.

1148
00:46:08,869 --> 00:46:12,110
(YAMAGUCHI SATOSHI of B rank)

1149
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:17,210
Nice. Good. I like it.

1150
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:20,150
Is there anything you guys can show?

1151
00:46:20,579 --> 00:46:22,579
(A C ranker promoting himself to another C ranker)

1152
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:25,119
Okay.

1153
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:30,360
When you see me, in your eyes

1154
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:32,530
- Okay. - Thank you.

1155
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,729
We're nothing without hard work and passion.

1156
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:37,929
We must be passionate.

1157
00:46:37,969 --> 00:46:39,638
I'm sure I'm passionate of all.

1158
00:46:39,639 --> 00:46:41,238
We must be positive.

1159
00:46:41,239 --> 00:46:43,868
I'm passionate and positive. I never give up. I know I am.

1160
00:46:43,869 --> 00:46:44,940
I never give up.

1161
00:46:45,139 --> 00:46:46,880
"All we need is passion."

1162
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:49,909
That got me to join the team.

1163
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:53,618
Above all, he once made a debut and has a lot of experience.

1164
00:46:53,619 --> 00:46:55,749
HEEDO seemed like he had...

1165
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:57,590
a sense of leadership for sure.

1166
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:01,658
And I thought we'd be able to make synergy...

1167
00:47:01,659 --> 00:47:04,460
together in the same team.

1168
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,899
About those we need to reconsider...

1169
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,359
- Should we check once more? - Yes.

1170
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,598
Let's check...

1171
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:11,098
- what they can show. - You have three minutes left.

1172
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:13,169
- We have three minutes left. - You're in first.

1173
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:14,839
Let's make this real quick.

1174
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,138
(Judge YOO is rushed.)

1175
00:47:16,139 --> 00:47:17,570
Can you show me...

1176
00:47:17,639 --> 00:47:20,209
how you dance, sing, or rap...

1177
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:21,879
once each real quickly?

1178
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,349
You're confident at singing, right?

1179
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,480
Do you want to promote anything about you?

1180
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:28,118
- Anything. - He's really talented.

1181
00:47:28,119 --> 00:47:30,389
Can you promote yourself?

1182
00:47:30,849 --> 00:47:32,419
It was hard to focus...

1183
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:34,489
in that hectic situation.

1184
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:37,828
But HEEDO listened so carefully.

1185
00:47:37,829 --> 00:47:40,530
He checked each of our names.

1186
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:43,130
It was very reliable.

1187
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:46,869
Do something to promote yourself quickly.

1188
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,639
- Let me... I'll do it. - Okay.

1189
00:47:57,409 --> 00:47:58,880
Okay.

1190
00:48:00,179 --> 00:48:01,218
- No. - Okay.

1191
00:48:01,219 --> 00:48:02,879
I'll do the best I can if you...

1192
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,288
P2.

1193
00:48:04,289 --> 00:48:06,389
Please look around you.

1194
00:48:08,889 --> 00:48:09,989
It's over.

1195
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:11,189
You're right.

1196
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:12,658
Oh, we're fixed to be the same team?

1197
00:48:12,659 --> 00:48:13,960
Okay, let's just...

1198
00:48:14,199 --> 00:48:16,268
- Let's beat all with hard work. - Let's do this.

1199
00:48:16,269 --> 00:48:17,669
Let's do this.

1200
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:18,829
(P2 is the last team to be completed.)

1201
00:48:18,869 --> 00:48:22,238
Once four teams were decided, the rest were to end up together.

1202
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:24,509
But things were too hectic and uneasy...

1203
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:25,569
that I was promoting myself...

1204
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:27,139
when the other teams were already decided.

1205
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,409
(Showing off his specialty)

1206
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:32,349
- I'll do the best I can if you... - Gosh.

1207
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:34,320
- Congrats. - Oh, okay.

1208
00:48:34,849 --> 00:48:36,078
Let's give each other a hand.

1209
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:39,050
(Trainees' Self Assembly is over.)

1210
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:44,359
We have one S ranker...

1211
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:46,729
and a lot of C rankers. Like 7 to 8 of them.

1212
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:48,159
We just need to do a good job.

1213
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:49,969
Our team will be safe, then.

1214
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:54,138
High rankers will have to make effort.

1215
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:56,038
But I'd like our team to be First Tier.

1216
00:48:56,039 --> 00:48:58,170
I'll make that happen.

1217
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,679
We can do a good job.

1218
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:02,480
We can do it.

1219
00:49:03,449 --> 00:49:05,509
- We just have to move up now. - We can do it.

1220
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:08,820
- First off, we're most handsome. - Right.

1221
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:10,420
We deserve to be in the center.

1222
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:12,019
We're already in the center.

1223
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:14,460
We just need to do well.

1224
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:17,328
Can we do a good job?

1225
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:18,630
- Yes. - Let's rock this.

1226
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:22,460
I think it's okay.

1227
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:24,098
I'm really good at this.

1228
00:49:24,099 --> 00:49:25,399
- Trust me. - You look like you'll be good.

1229
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:26,468
He's really good.

1230
00:49:26,469 --> 00:49:29,968
Now, Trainees' Self Assembly...

1231
00:49:29,969 --> 00:49:32,070
is now all complete.

1232
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:37,480
(Resulting in five teams)

1233
00:49:38,909 --> 00:49:41,679
These five teams will practice together...

1234
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:44,820
to show their most upgraded version of themselves.

1235
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:47,589
Only teams that successfully show an upgrade...

1236
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:50,429
can win the title song in First Tier Zone.

1237
00:49:50,889 --> 00:49:53,328
For you to get in First Tier Zone...

1238
00:49:53,329 --> 00:49:56,469
to catch the attention of World Assemblers,

1239
00:49:56,929 --> 00:49:59,800
I hope you all do your best.

1240
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:01,800
- Let's do this! - Let's do this!

1241
00:50:02,539 --> 00:50:03,609
All right.

1242
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:04,940
Let's do this.

1243
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:06,780
Thank you.

1244
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:10,579
(The sky has turned dark.)

1245
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:16,550
(The first night in the Project Village)

1246
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,719
(They finally enter their lodging.)

1247
00:50:23,929 --> 00:50:25,029
I'm looking around.

1248
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:26,598
- This is great. - It's better than I expected.

1249
00:50:26,599 --> 00:50:27,760
Yes, it's way better.

1250
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:29,530
Hello.

1251
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:31,730
- You're older, right? - Hi.

1252
00:50:31,929 --> 00:50:33,069
All right.

1253
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:34,440
(A hundred trainees have entered the village.)

1254
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,669
Shall we introduce ourselves?

1255
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:37,809
- Shall we do that? - Sure.

1256
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:39,039
Shall we take a seat first?

1257
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:40,939
I was born in 2004.

1258
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:42,380
I was studying at Yonsei University,

1259
00:50:42,909 --> 00:50:45,280
but I took an academic break to apply here.

1260
00:50:45,579 --> 00:50:48,480
I was born in 2001, and my name is LEE JUCHAN.

1261
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:50,650
I was born in 2009.

1262
00:50:50,789 --> 00:50:52,319
- In 2009? - You were born in 2009?

1263
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:53,460
I'm 16 years old.

1264
00:50:53,559 --> 00:50:55,989
(He's very tense in front of the older trainees.)

1265
00:50:56,789 --> 00:50:58,788
I'm quite old. I'm 25,

1266
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:01,000
and I'm KIM HYUNJAE.

1267
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:02,928
It's incredible that you were born in 2009.

1268
00:51:02,929 --> 00:51:04,730
(He suddenly becomes polite.)

1269
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:08,170
Shall we talk more comfortably?

1270
00:51:08,739 --> 00:51:09,809
Sounds good.

1271
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:12,169
It must be hard for you to speak comfortably to me.

1272
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:13,179
(They're 9 years apart.)

1273
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:17,750
(KIM SUNGMIN, KIM SIYUL, KIM JIHWAN, BINGHUA)

1274
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:21,050
(Staring intently)

1275
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,118
You look really pretty.

1276
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:24,119
Well...

1277
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:25,348
You're good-looking.

1278
00:51:25,349 --> 00:51:26,349
(Shy)

1279
00:51:26,619 --> 00:51:28,090
(A sudden personal confession)

1280
00:51:28,289 --> 00:51:30,190
I brought some vitamins.

1281
00:51:31,489 --> 00:51:33,058
- It's inside my luggage. - Is it for self-care?

1282
00:51:33,059 --> 00:51:34,460
Don't you think it's pretty?

1283
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:35,860
Look at this.

1284
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:38,969
Can you lend me your conditioner?

1285
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:40,340
What if I don't want to?

1286
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:41,500
I'm going to kiss you.

1287
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:43,709
I'm going to kiss you.

1288
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:45,039
(I don't want that.)

1289
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:46,339
This is hair treatment.

1290
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:47,408
(Here's the conditioner.)

1291
00:51:47,409 --> 00:51:48,440
Thank you.

1292
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:51,809
(He's excited to have the conditioner.)

1293
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:54,980
(MAJINGXIANG, LYNNLYNN, LIN WEI CHEN, FONG ATILLA)

1294
00:51:56,489 --> 00:51:59,250
"RUN" is really cool.

1295
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:02,360
It's full of positive energy.

1296
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:04,659
It's completely different.

1297
00:52:04,889 --> 00:52:06,929
This song is great to listen to,

1298
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,969
but I like both Director Bada...

1299
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:12,630
and the host too. But...

1300
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:14,670
This is so hard.

1301
00:52:16,139 --> 00:52:19,510
(Having a deep conversation about "RUN")

1302
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:25,150
You don't need to be nervous.

1303
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:26,250
Well...

1304
00:52:26,679 --> 00:52:28,819
Just spray this if you think the room smells stuffy.

1305
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:30,389
- Yes. - Thanks.

1306
00:52:30,489 --> 00:52:33,559
I have probiotics if ever anyone gets constipated.

1307
00:52:33,889 --> 00:52:36,090
I have bandages in case anyone gets hurt too.

1308
00:52:37,230 --> 00:52:38,529
(What else do I have?)

1309
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:41,059
Guys, you know we can't do our laundry here.

1310
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:43,968
(AHN JUNWON even brought laundry soap.)

1311
00:52:43,969 --> 00:52:46,099
- You brought your own. - It's laundry soap.

1312
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:47,368
I see.

1313
00:52:47,369 --> 00:52:49,400
This is called laundry soap.

1314
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,840
I doubt anyone else brought this.

1315
00:52:50,909 --> 00:52:53,678
I also brought detergent to wash with our hands.

1316
00:52:53,679 --> 00:52:55,609
- That's amazing. - Impressive.

1317
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:58,209
- We're tidy. - Yes.

1318
00:52:58,210 --> 00:52:59,610
- I agree. - You can use my body wash.

1319
00:53:00,849 --> 00:53:02,519
Are we unpacking now?

1320
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:04,320
Hello.

1321
00:53:04,519 --> 00:53:05,519
Hi.

1322
00:53:05,789 --> 00:53:07,919
(A load of plushies)

1323
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,359
Look at this.

1324
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:10,360
(WU CHENYU of P5 is full of plushies.)

1325
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:13,899
This is for me to study Korean.

1326
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:16,099
(Studying Korean is a must for KENSHIN of P4.)

1327
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:18,900
I need to submit this.

1328
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:20,369
That wasn't yours?

1329
00:53:20,539 --> 00:53:21,969
- It's mine. - I thought so.

1330
00:53:22,739 --> 00:53:26,469
This is the baseball player Kang Jung Ho's bat.

1331
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:28,179
Do you know him?

1332
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:33,250
(The owner of the endless vitamins)

1333
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:36,049
You have a lot of vitamins.

1334
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:37,249
(JEON MINWOOK of P1 born in 1999)

1335
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:38,919
You have to take care of yourself when you start ageing.

1336
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:39,920
Impressive.

1337
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:42,919
My body wash is a cooling body wash.

1338
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,760
What a great idea.

1339
00:53:45,059 --> 00:53:46,159
Sounds good.

1340
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:47,659
I brought shaving cream too.

1341
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,629
I don't shave, but that's great.

1342
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:52,570
- You don't? - I went waxing.

1343
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,400
This is cleansing oil.

1344
00:53:54,401 --> 00:53:55,739
(Next is cleansing oil.)

1345
00:53:56,039 --> 00:53:58,039
I use cleansing water, but that's impressive.

1346
00:53:58,739 --> 00:54:01,280
- You brought everything, right? - I did.

1347
00:54:02,510 --> 00:54:05,849
(After showing off all their belongings)

1348
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:09,320
Are we done for today?

1349
00:54:10,090 --> 00:54:11,449
We have to do this.

1350
00:54:12,219 --> 00:54:13,619
- We have to write a diary... - Oh, my.

1351
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:16,119
on Project 7.

1352
00:54:17,929 --> 00:54:18,929
Okay?

(A practice journal to wrap up their day)

1354
00:54:22,599 --> 00:54:24,929
Shall we try writing our practice journal?

1355
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:26,070
Sure.

"Day one..."

"of Project 7."

The long-awaited camp...

1361
00:54:44,619 --> 00:54:47,960
of Project 7 has finally begun.

1362
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:49,989
I still have butterflies in my stomach,

1363
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:54,000
and I think it was a fun day today.

1364
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:58,070
I'm quite sad that I was evaluated to C rank.

1365
00:54:58,429 --> 00:55:00,968
I'll do my best with confidence at all times.

1366
00:55:00,969 --> 00:55:04,710
I'll give my all in the practice without giving up.

Dear World Assemblers.

1368
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:08,340
I love you.

(Time to wrap up their day)

1370
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:21,488
Good night.

1371
00:55:21,489 --> 00:55:22,960
- Good luck. - Good luck.

Stay there.

1395
00:57:17,269 --> 00:57:18,510
This is amazing.

Have you watched the video for "RUN"?

- Yes. - Yes.

1400
00:57:26,849 --> 00:57:28,419
- How was it? - How did you like it?

1401
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:30,519
- It was intense. - It was hard.

1402
00:57:30,849 --> 00:57:31,888
Okay.

1403
00:57:31,889 --> 00:57:34,288
We're not going to take it easy because it's a survival show.

1404
00:57:34,289 --> 00:57:36,959
- We'll compete with quality. - That's right.

1405
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,359
We'll teach you each move even though they're difficult.

1406

- Okay! - Thank you.

1407
00:57:41,429 --> 00:57:45,299
When will I ever get classes from them like this?

1408
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:46,840
So it was such an honour for me.

1409
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:48,538
I'm looking forward to it.

1410
00:57:48,539 --> 00:57:49,869
I'm so excited.

1411
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:52,369
Let's start with the first move.

1412
00:57:52,409 --> 00:57:54,210
- Okay. - Let's start.

1413
00:57:54,510 --> 00:57:56,209
In 1, 2.

1414
00:57:56,210 --> 00:57:58,509
(Following the director's lead)

1415
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:01,279
(The trainees are learning the choreography.)

1416
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,480
And then...

1417
00:58:02,619 --> 00:58:04,820
(Learning from the basics)

1418
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:07,819
And 5, 6, 7, 8.

1419
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:08,960
- Are you okay? - Yes.

1420
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:10,260
It's hard.

1421
00:58:10,429 --> 00:58:11,460
I don't get it at all.

1422
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:14,460
We're going to speed it up. This is only for those who got it.

1423

1424
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:20,239
(Original speed)

1425
00:58:20,369 --> 00:58:22,500
In 1, 2, 3, 4.

(Fumbling)

1427
00:58:25,309 --> 00:58:28,210
- What? - And 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

1428
00:58:28,579 --> 00:58:30,650
That was so fast.

1429
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:33,110
It was hard.

1430
00:58:34,579 --> 00:58:35,750
It's so difficult.

1431
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:39,218
Will I be able to perform it live?

1432
00:58:39,219 --> 00:58:41,119
In 5, 6, 7, and go.

1433
00:58:42,989 --> 00:58:45,829
(One trainee doesn't seem to be having a hard time at all.)

1434
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:49,399
PARK JUNSEO of P1...

1435
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,929
was dancing so well.

1436
00:58:51,969 --> 00:58:53,839
He's a good dancer,

1437
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:56,098
and the others behind him...

1438
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:58,809
were above average.

1439
00:58:59,139 --> 00:59:01,280
There's someone who can dance it from start to finish.

1440
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:02,980
Impressive.

1441
00:59:03,539 --> 00:59:05,379
- Okay. - Should we teach this by rank?

1442
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:06,479
- Okay. - According to rank.

1443
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,949
"We want to go first. We're confident."

1444
00:59:09,519 --> 00:59:11,589
- P1. - P1.

1445
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:13,250
- P1. - P1.

1446
00:59:14,659 --> 00:59:16,489
- Why are there so many S rankers? - They have so many S rankers?

1447
00:59:16,929 --> 00:59:20,400
(How well do P1 members dance?)

1448
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,070
(Staring blankly)

1449
00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:26,230
(Feeling proud)

1450
00:59:32,170 --> 00:59:33,268
(The S rankers of P1 have perfectly mastered the choreography.)

1451
00:59:33,269 --> 00:59:34,409
Nice.

1452
00:59:35,239 --> 00:59:37,348
- Well done. JUNSEO... - But...

1453
00:59:37,349 --> 00:59:38,609
- JUNSEO. - was really good.

1454
00:59:38,610 --> 00:59:39,750
You're really good.

1455
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,848
I was worried if I could win against them.

1456
00:59:43,849 --> 00:59:45,949
It felt like there was a huge difference.

1457
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,589
Regarding dancing,

1458
00:59:48,590 --> 00:59:52,158
I thought there was a big difference between us.

1459
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:53,159
(P1 is on another level.)

1460
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:56,460
(They check P4's choreography for "RUN" next.)

1461
00:59:58,369 --> 01:00:02,300
(The S rankers of P4 seem to be struggling.)

1462
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:05,238
(Trainee KIM TAEYU of P2)

1463
01:00:05,239 --> 01:00:06,269
(Glancing)

1464
01:00:06,409 --> 01:00:08,039
Dance without looking at us.

1465
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:12,349
That's a bit disappointing for an S ranker.

1466
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:13,719
I'm sorry.

1467
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:16,678
P4 would need to work a bit harder.

1468
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:18,420
Not a bit. They would need to work a lot harder.

1469
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:22,359
I want to be in First Tier,

1470
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:24,489
but I would have to work much harder...

1471
01:00:25,059 --> 01:00:26,860
if I want to catch up with P1.

1472
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:29,260
- Let's go. - Great.

1473
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:30,570
Ready.

1474
01:00:30,769 --> 01:00:32,829
- Let's go! - Five, six, seven, go.

1475
01:00:34,039 --> 01:00:35,570
What is that?

1476
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:37,808
What is that?

1477
01:00:37,809 --> 01:00:40,209
(B rankers are performing better than S rankers.)

1478
01:00:40,210 --> 01:00:41,210
What's happening?

1479
01:00:42,409 --> 01:00:43,480
(Focusing)

1480
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:45,979
(One trainee stands out among the B rankers.)

1481
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:47,349
YURA?

1482
01:00:47,719 --> 01:00:49,550
YURA gets on the beat well.

1483
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:51,989
- Could you show us? - Sure.

1484
01:00:52,389 --> 01:00:55,488
Right behind him. You're BINGHUA, right?

1485
01:00:55,489 --> 01:00:57,329
- Yes. - You two can dance together.

1486
01:00:57,659 --> 01:00:58,829
- Yes. - Let's go.

1487
01:00:58,929 --> 01:00:59,960
In a line.

1488
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:01,959
(How well will these two dance?)

1489
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:03,900
Five, six, seven, go.

1490
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:07,239
(They are perfectly on beat.)

1491
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:10,199
- YURA is good. - Nice.

1492
01:01:11,269 --> 01:01:13,369
(The P4 duo keep dancing with more energy.)

1493
01:01:15,110 --> 01:01:16,110
Is this for real?

1494
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:17,908
What is going on?

1495
01:01:17,909 --> 01:01:19,109
(They memorized the full choreography as well.)

1496
01:01:19,110 --> 01:01:20,150
They're good.

1497
01:01:20,550 --> 01:01:21,619
They're good.

1498
01:01:24,090 --> 01:01:25,349
They memorized the beat...

1499
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:27,889
and the choreography in a short period of time.

1500
01:01:28,519 --> 01:01:29,820
I thought it was amazing.

1501
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:33,799
Yura was really good,

1502
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,199
so I had my eyes on him as well.

1503
01:01:35,829 --> 01:01:39,899
YURA in our team danced better than an S ranker.

1504
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:41,940
I was relieved because he was in our team.

1505
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,340
Weren't you worried?

1506
01:01:44,539 --> 01:01:47,010
He was good, but our team was good too.

1507
01:01:48,039 --> 01:01:49,909
(We're not worried about becoming 1st Tier.)

1508
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:53,249
Hello.

1509
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:54,320
Hello.

1510
01:01:58,119 --> 01:02:00,420
Hello, trainees. It's been a while.

1511
01:02:00,690 --> 01:02:02,389
- Hello. - Hello.

1512
01:02:03,159 --> 01:02:06,988
- We had a dance class right now. - Yes.

1513
01:02:06,989 --> 01:02:08,400
Choreography is important,

1514
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,968
but you should be able to sing perfectly as well.

1515
01:02:10,969 --> 01:02:11,999
- Right. - Right.

1516
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,138
You're all holding the lyrics sheet, right?

1517
01:02:14,139 --> 01:02:15,169
- Yes. - Yes.

1518
01:02:15,170 --> 01:02:17,268
Let's all sing together.

1519
01:02:17,269 --> 01:02:19,268
(The group vocal class of "RUN" begins.)

1520
01:02:19,269 --> 01:02:21,209
- Overcome the limit, endlessly - Overcome the limit, endlessly

1521
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:23,340
- I'll run to you - I'll run to you

1522
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:25,109
- The timing is up to you - The timing is up to you

1523
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:28,419
(The chorus part of "RUN," the title song)

1524
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:30,319
- Call my name louder - Call my name louder

1525
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:32,250
- Everyone, a little more - Everyone, a little more

1526
01:02:32,650 --> 01:02:33,889
I think you're doing good.

1527
01:02:34,090 --> 01:02:36,159
Or is it because those who sing well are the only ones singing?

1528
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,889
Right? There are some people who aren't singing, right?

1529
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:42,359
Now, we're going to sing...

1530
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:44,368
(They'll check the vocals by ranks as well.)

1531
01:02:44,369 --> 01:02:45,569
according to rank.

1532
01:02:45,570 --> 01:02:46,799
I'm in trouble.

1533
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,099
I haven't even memorized the notes yet.

1534
01:02:48,269 --> 01:02:50,368
- Goodness. - My goodness.

1535
01:02:50,369 --> 01:02:52,968
I want to hear the S rankers first.

1536
01:02:52,969 --> 01:02:55,138
Let's hear how the S rankers sing.

1537
01:02:55,139 --> 01:02:56,279
- Okay. - Okay.

1538
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:57,448
P5.

1539
01:02:57,449 --> 01:02:58,880
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1540
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:00,309
Let's go.

1541
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:02,849
- Call my name louder - Call my name louder

1542
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:04,550
(Everyone, a little more)

1543
01:03:04,789 --> 01:03:05,988
- Now, in a new world - Now, in a new world

1544
01:03:05,989 --> 01:03:08,859
(They didn't learn the melody well.)

1545
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:10,559
- We can be anything - We can be anything

1546
01:03:10,659 --> 01:03:13,760
(There's a trainee who can't sing at all.)

1547
01:03:14,599 --> 01:03:15,630
I'm sorry.

1548
01:03:17,199 --> 01:03:18,900
You haven't learned the song yet.

1549
01:03:19,329 --> 01:03:20,499
- We need to practice. - Right.

1550
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:21,999
- Are you Chinese? - Yes.

1551
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,440
(Two of the S rankers in P5 are foreigners.)

1552
01:03:23,739 --> 01:03:26,138
There are two foreigners.

1553
01:03:26,139 --> 01:03:27,178
(There are 2 foreign trainees in Rank C as well.)

1554
01:03:27,179 --> 01:03:28,239
Give us the music.

1555
01:03:29,110 --> 01:03:32,349
(Humming)

1556
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:36,519
(He hums instead of singing the lyrics.)

1557
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:39,988
I heard there were many foreign trainees.

1558
01:03:39,989 --> 01:03:44,260
I heard that they were having difficulty in singing the song.

1559
01:03:44,590 --> 01:03:46,788
It didn't sound like they were singing.

1560
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:48,300
It felt like they were reading.

1561
01:03:48,599 --> 01:03:51,199
I think P5 was the weakest team.

1562
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:53,599
- P5. - P5.

1563
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:54,968
I think P5 is the weakest.

1564
01:03:54,969 --> 01:03:55,999
(The trainees pointed out P5 to be the weakest team.)

1565
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,940
We wouldn't be the last team at least.

1566
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:00,738
I thought we wouldn't be in the Shadow Zone.

1567
01:04:00,739 --> 01:04:01,980
(P5 is most likely to be in the Shadow Zone.)

1568
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:04,179
- P2 has the most C rankers. - Let's go.

1569
01:04:04,349 --> 01:04:05,408
Let's go.

1570
01:04:05,409 --> 01:04:06,409
(P2 gets their vocals checked next.)

1571
01:04:06,410 --> 01:04:07,579
Be confident.

1572
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:10,049
With the attitude like, "Why did I get Rank C?"

1573
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:11,118
(They're very nervous.)

1574
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:13,518
I was worried about P2.

1575
01:04:13,519 --> 01:04:17,959
I watched when the C rankers were going to sing.

1576
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:20,158
They were very scared.

1577
01:04:20,159 --> 01:04:21,900
I was scared as well.

1578
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:24,969
But they were more scared.

1579
01:04:25,929 --> 01:04:28,138
(How well will the P2 members sing?)

1580
01:04:28,139 --> 01:04:29,799
- The timing is up to you - The timing is up to you

1581
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,469
- The time to run - The time to run

1582
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:33,339
(Call my name louder)

1583
01:04:33,340 --> 01:04:35,179
(Everyone, a little more)

1584
01:04:38,849 --> 01:04:39,980
Well...

1585
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:44,650
I think you'd need more confidence.

1586
01:04:45,389 --> 01:04:47,018
You're not familiar with the song yet.

1587
01:04:47,019 --> 01:04:50,690
You shouldn't be looked down on because you got Rank C.

1588
01:04:51,159 --> 01:04:52,159
(Yelling)

1589
01:04:53,030 --> 01:04:55,099
(A gray trainee suddenly holds up his hand.)

1590
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:59,599
(Focusing on him)

1591
01:05:00,769 --> 01:05:02,900
(AHN JUNWON of P3)

1592
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,940
- They both came to our booth. - I see.

1593
01:05:07,210 --> 01:05:09,379
- Are you nervous? - No.

1594
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:10,408
- You can do it, right? - I can do it.

1595
01:05:10,409 --> 01:05:13,050
Good. Give us the music.

1596
01:05:13,949 --> 01:05:16,179
(The timing is up to you)

1597
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:18,149
(The time to run)

1598
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:19,518
Call my name louder

1599
01:05:19,519 --> 01:05:21,618
Everyone, a little more

1600
01:05:21,619 --> 01:05:23,618
Now, in a new world

1601
01:05:23,619 --> 01:05:25,259
(His veins protrude.)

1602
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:27,428
We can be anything, I'm

1603
01:05:27,429 --> 01:05:30,530
(The star that shines at the tip of your finger)

1604
01:05:30,929 --> 01:05:33,729
(A powerful vocal performance of AHN JUNWON of P3)

1605
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:36,868
Why did you give him Rank C?

1606
01:05:36,869 --> 01:05:39,139
- You're good. - I know. He's good.

1607
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:40,808
He's confident.

1608
01:05:40,809 --> 01:05:41,840
(The directors are happy about his confidence.)

1609
01:05:42,309 --> 01:05:45,609
I remember that he had good vocal skills.

1610
01:05:45,610 --> 01:05:47,880
He was very confident as well.

1611
01:05:48,519 --> 01:05:52,750
Could you raise your hand if you can sing this now?

1612
01:05:53,989 --> 01:05:55,420
(Lifting his hand)

1613
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:56,690
Please come forward.

1614
01:05:56,691 --> 01:05:58,590
(Is it P1 again?)

1615
01:05:59,159 --> 01:06:01,230
(Who mastered the song perfectly?)

1616
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:02,630
They're both from our team.

1617
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:06,400
(KWON YONGHYUN and KANG HYUNWOO from P1)

1618
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:07,939
Please give us the music.

1619
01:06:07,940 --> 01:06:10,070
(How well will the P1 vocalists sing?)

1620
01:06:11,110 --> 01:06:13,869
- The timing is up to you - The timing is up to you

1621
01:06:13,969 --> 01:06:15,039
(He was shocked.)

1622
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,479
- Call my name louder - Call my name louder

1623
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:19,509
(They're amazed.)

1624
01:06:19,510 --> 01:06:22,879
- Now, in a new world - Now, in a new world

1625
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,889
- We can be anything, I'm - We can be anything, I'm

1626
01:06:24,989 --> 01:06:28,618
(The star that shines at the tip of your finger)

1627
01:06:28,619 --> 01:06:30,119
Let's clap for them.

1628
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:33,630
- Let's clap for them. - They're good.

1629
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:36,199
They're really good.

1630
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:38,429
They're a monstrous group.

1631
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:42,570
You know how in these shows there are teams like the Avengers?

1632
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:45,968
PARK JUNSEO danced really well.

1633
01:06:45,969 --> 01:06:47,039
I was shocked by that.

1634
01:06:47,269 --> 01:06:50,439
KANG HYUNWOO was also there.

1635
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:54,009
I want to become 1st Tier, but the P1 members...

1636
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,619
They were too good.

1637
01:06:56,150 --> 01:06:58,050
I thought it was an Avengers team.

1638
01:06:59,449 --> 01:07:02,419
Before I leave,

1639
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:04,529
there's an important announcement...

1640
01:07:04,530 --> 01:07:07,329
that I should tell you.

1641
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:11,368
Before I leave,

1642
01:07:11,369 --> 01:07:13,428
there's an important announcement...

1643
01:07:13,429 --> 01:07:16,199
that I should tell you.

1644
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:18,309
Tomorrow,

1645
01:07:19,210 --> 01:07:22,539
there will be a video evaluation on your title song performance.

1646
01:07:22,610 --> 01:07:23,840
- Tomorrow? - Tomorrow?

1647
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:26,249
For the evaluation,

1648
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:29,518
each trainee will record a live performance video...

1649
01:07:29,519 --> 01:07:32,090
of the title song's first verse.

1650
01:07:33,349 --> 01:07:36,718
The directors will watch the videos of the 100 trainees...

1651
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:38,389
and give you scores.

1652
01:07:38,789 --> 01:07:41,199
So I hope you do your best.

1653
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:44,630
Tomorrow? That's soon.

1654
01:07:45,369 --> 01:07:46,829
I did expect it, but it really happened.

1655
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:49,170
I felt pressured.

1656
01:07:49,739 --> 01:07:52,070
"A video evaluation? Within this time?"

1657
01:07:52,539 --> 01:07:55,510
"Does this make sense?" That's what I thought.

1658
01:07:56,039 --> 01:07:58,149
This is the most important part.

1659
01:07:58,150 --> 01:08:00,779
Your individual scores will be summed up...

1660
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:02,848
to get a team score.

1661
01:08:02,849 --> 01:08:05,789
(The team's tier will be decided by the total of the individual scores.)

1662
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:08,489
- We should all do well. - We should all do well.

1663
01:08:09,190 --> 01:08:11,689
I was very stressed.

1664
01:08:11,690 --> 01:08:13,360
I'd be affecting the team.

1665
01:08:14,199 --> 01:08:15,299
I panicked.

1666
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:17,159
My heart dropped.

1667
01:08:17,630 --> 01:08:21,470
I'm very worried that I would drop the team's score.

1668
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:25,239
Welcome to P1.

1669
01:08:25,909 --> 01:08:28,979
(P1 practice room)

1670
01:08:29,310 --> 01:08:31,179
We all did well during the classes.

1671
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:33,479
- I know. - I think we can win first place.

1672
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:36,749
I'll be aiming for First Tier.

1673
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:38,520
We have to, no matter what.

1674
01:08:38,649 --> 01:08:40,448
You all heard what they said earlier.

1675
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:42,618
Every team member has to perform well.

1676
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:44,889
Let's help each other and do well.

1677
01:08:44,890 --> 01:08:46,228
- Okay. - Let's do this.

1678
01:08:46,229 --> 01:08:48,600
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1679
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:50,869
Let's go.

1680
01:08:51,470 --> 01:08:54,100
Wouldn't we need a team leader?

1681
01:08:54,239 --> 01:08:55,799
- We need one. - Of course.

1682
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:57,270
Of course.

1683
01:08:57,399 --> 01:08:59,640
Is there anyone who wants to be the leader?

1684
01:08:59,739 --> 01:09:02,210
- Volunteers? - Let's get volunteers first.

1685
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:04,079
Can I recommend someone?

1686
01:09:04,510 --> 01:09:06,349
- Sure. - I recommend JUNSEO.

1687
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:07,550
(Recommending Trainee PARK JUNSEO as the leader.)

1688
01:09:11,220 --> 01:09:13,289
Is there any volunteer?

1689
01:09:14,289 --> 01:09:16,019
- Let's see if there's one. - Didn't you raise your hand?

1690
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:17,219
- I did. - I see.

1691
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:19,689
But someone recommended me.

1692
01:09:20,029 --> 01:09:22,629
Then JUNSEO will be our leader.

1693
01:09:22,630 --> 01:09:25,529
(Trainee PARK JUNSEO became the leader of P1.)

1694
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:28,739
Everyone seems to like it.

1695
01:09:29,199 --> 01:09:30,738
Someone should put it on him.

1696
01:09:30,739 --> 01:09:32,809
- Congratulations. - I'll do my best.

1697
01:09:32,810 --> 01:09:34,439
- Let's go! - Let's go.

1698
01:09:34,609 --> 01:09:35,739
Let's go, JUNSEO.

1699
01:09:38,979 --> 01:09:40,948
The reason I recommended JUNSEO...

1700
01:09:40,949 --> 01:09:42,220
was because he was reliable.

1701
01:09:42,449 --> 01:09:46,389
He has various experiences, and he's really talented too.

1702
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:47,520
That's why I recommended him.

1703
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:49,788
I wondered if it was right for me to be the leader...

1704
01:09:49,789 --> 01:09:53,029
and contemplated whether I should do it or not.

1705
01:09:53,289 --> 01:09:55,528
But I think I unconsciously wanted...

1706
01:09:55,529 --> 01:09:58,170
to become the leader.

1707
01:09:59,170 --> 01:10:02,970
- Now we are here as a team, - Yes.

1708
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:06,438
so I think it'll be good if we make a team greeting.

1709
01:10:06,439 --> 01:10:09,078
Let's do a shout as a way to cheer us up.

1710
01:10:09,079 --> 01:10:11,809
We are objectively ranked...

1711
01:10:11,810 --> 01:10:14,179
- pretty high. - That's right.

1712
01:10:14,180 --> 01:10:17,278
- So we should be proud of that. - Then...

1713
01:10:17,279 --> 01:10:18,749
- Let's include that fact. - Let me give you an idea.

1714
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:20,849
I think our team...

1715
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:22,859
has a lot of talented trainees.

1716
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:25,430
It's like the Avengers.

1717
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:27,159
And this is Assembler.

1718
01:10:27,699 --> 01:10:31,169
So the leader can go,

1719
01:10:31,170 --> 01:10:33,068
"Avengers, Assembler!"

1720
01:10:33,069 --> 01:10:34,539
Then we can go, "Hello, we're P1."

1721
01:10:35,270 --> 01:10:37,398
- That's neat. - That's neat.

1722
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:38,809
- Let's take this. - Shall we give it a try?

1723
01:10:38,810 --> 01:10:40,439
- Okay. - Sounds good.

1724
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:42,538
Avengers!

1725
01:10:42,539 --> 01:10:43,879
- Assembler! - Assembler!

1726
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:46,180
- Hello, we're P1. - Hello, we're P1.

1727
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:51,889
- Let's practice now. - Yes.

1728
01:10:51,890 --> 01:10:53,989
- Let's go. - Let's do it!

1729
01:10:54,149 --> 01:10:55,390
Let's go, P1!

1730
01:10:55,859 --> 01:10:56,960
Let's go.

1731
01:10:57,859 --> 01:11:00,889
I'll turn on the music, so make yourself home...

1732
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:03,029
and stretch if you want.

1733
01:11:03,130 --> 01:11:05,069
Those who want to practice the choreography can do that.

1734
01:11:05,229 --> 01:11:06,369
Okay.

1735
01:11:16,510 --> 01:11:20,050
(They warm up in their own style.)

1736
01:11:24,350 --> 01:11:26,720
(But Trainee KIM HYUNWOO is sitting down?)

1737
01:11:27,689 --> 01:11:31,529
(He's wearing a cast?)

1738
01:11:32,630 --> 01:11:35,699
I sprained my ankle while dancing.

1739
01:11:36,029 --> 01:11:38,729
I went back to the dorm after seeing the doctor.

1740
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:44,038
(Trainee KIM HYUNWOO sprained his ankle...)

1741
01:11:44,039 --> 01:11:45,539
(as soon as he moved to the dorm.)

1742
01:11:46,210 --> 01:11:47,439
Surprise.

1743
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:50,510
What? What's going on?

1744
01:11:52,079 --> 01:11:53,849
- What happened? - He hurt his ankle.

1745
01:11:53,850 --> 01:11:55,520
What? What are you going to do?

1746
01:11:55,949 --> 01:11:58,788
It's okay. I can't dance, but I can manage...

1747
01:11:58,789 --> 01:11:59,989
because I've got the spirit.

1748
01:12:00,090 --> 01:12:02,590
That's right, you should. You can do it.

1749
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:06,059
The first thought that came to my mind...

1750
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:08,129
was how sorry I was to the team.

1751
01:12:08,130 --> 01:12:11,899
The entire team has to suffer because I wasn't careful.

1752
01:12:12,199 --> 01:12:13,729
I couldn't look at them.

1753
01:12:14,369 --> 01:12:17,769
So I tried my best to focus.

1754
01:12:17,770 --> 01:12:19,938
"I need to show them what I got even if I hurt my ankle."

1755
01:12:19,939 --> 01:12:23,379
"Let's show them my determination through my hard work."

1756
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:24,810
That's the mindset I had.

1757
01:12:26,649 --> 01:12:29,118
Can we practice the dance as a group?

1758
01:12:29,119 --> 01:12:30,279
- Yes. - Yes, we can.

1759
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:33,549
- You must focus as much as you can. - Okay.

1760
01:12:33,550 --> 01:12:37,519
Please try to sync the angles as much as you can.

1761
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:38,529
- Okay. - Okay.

1762
01:12:38,859 --> 01:12:39,930
Let's start.

1763
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:42,800
Six, seven, eight.

1764
01:12:43,029 --> 01:12:44,898
It's not too

1765
01:12:44,899 --> 01:12:46,229
Let's try that again.

1766
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:49,770
Make sure to keep the balance on both knees.

1767
01:12:50,039 --> 01:12:52,669
Point your index fingers like this between your thighs.

1768
01:12:52,670 --> 01:12:53,769
Three, four.

1769
01:12:53,770 --> 01:12:58,409
It's not too late yet

1770
01:12:58,810 --> 01:13:00,349
Point to your pelvis and shoulder.

1771
01:13:00,350 --> 01:13:01,819
Like this.

1772
01:13:03,949 --> 01:13:07,890
An endless unknown

1773
01:13:09,189 --> 01:13:10,759
Make sure to bend your wrists properly here.

1774
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:12,829
It's not this. Bend your wrists.

1775
01:13:14,359 --> 01:13:15,930
- Okay. - Okay.

1776
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:20,369
You need to go like this as your right hand pushes.

1777
01:13:20,470 --> 01:13:21,699
- Okay. - Okay.

1778
01:13:22,869 --> 01:13:23,970
(Through Trainee PARK JUNSEO's passionate teaching...)

1779
01:13:24,039 --> 01:13:25,809
Kick slightly here.

1780
01:13:25,810 --> 01:13:26,869
- Okay. - Okay.

1781
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:29,778
I think jumping like this will make the move neater and nicer.

1782
01:13:29,779 --> 01:13:30,779
- Okay. - Okay.

1783
01:13:30,939 --> 01:13:32,379
You're all following well, right?

1784
01:13:32,380 --> 01:13:33,409
- Yes. - Let's try it again.

1785
01:13:34,079 --> 01:13:37,448
JUNSEO taught us the details well...

1786
01:13:37,449 --> 01:13:39,350
as though it was one person dancing.

1787
01:13:39,649 --> 01:13:41,590
We made progress smoothly.

1788
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:45,028
We had to practice a lot in a short amount of time.

1789
01:13:45,029 --> 01:13:47,930
So we practised efficiently.

1790
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:52,228
I think it'd be great if MINSEO could lead the dance...

1791
01:13:52,229 --> 01:13:54,639
and practice keeping our energy up.

1792
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:55,670
Okay.

1793
01:13:56,170 --> 01:13:59,339
After teaching the choreography precisely,

1794
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:02,739
I asked MINSEO to take charge of the practice.

1795
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:05,108
I thought it'd be better if I could teach...

1796
01:14:05,109 --> 01:14:06,379
the lacking trainees one by one.

1797
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:08,849
It turns like this, so just turn your wrist.

1798
01:14:08,850 --> 01:14:09,850
That's it.

1799
01:14:09,851 --> 01:14:11,688
I run to you

1800
01:14:11,689 --> 01:14:13,649
Your arms are a little high here.

1801
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:15,719
Dreaming

1802
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:17,188
(A 1-on-1 teaching time in the corner)

1803
01:14:17,189 --> 01:14:19,158
I told you to push with the back of your hand.

1804
01:14:19,159 --> 01:14:20,288
You go like this.

1805
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:21,859
Five, six, seven.

1806
01:14:23,060 --> 01:14:26,300
(In one side, Trainee KANG MINSEO is leading the practice.)

1807
01:14:28,670 --> 01:14:29,739
Great!

1808
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:31,770
That's the feel.

1809
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:35,839
To lift the mood up,

1810
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:37,380
we practised as a group energetically.

1811
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:39,649
We practised keeping our energy up.

1812
01:14:40,310 --> 01:14:42,649
MINSEO was helping JUNSEO.

1813
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:44,818
As MINSEO is helping him,

1814
01:14:44,819 --> 01:14:48,159
JUNSEO is leading the team well.

1815
01:14:49,289 --> 01:14:50,319
It was smooth.

1816
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:51,889
I thought, "Everyone is so good."

1817
01:14:51,890 --> 01:14:53,659
"It'll be fine as long as I do well."

1818
01:14:54,829 --> 01:14:56,728
- Everyone. - Yes.

1819
01:14:56,729 --> 01:15:00,528
Shall we practice really hard has a group...

1820
01:15:00,529 --> 01:15:01,538
two more times?

1821
01:15:01,539 --> 01:15:02,539
- Okay. - Okay.

1822
01:15:03,770 --> 01:15:05,210
We'll start right away.

1823
01:15:06,270 --> 01:15:07,978
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1824
01:15:07,979 --> 01:15:09,109
Let's go!

1825
01:15:17,890 --> 01:15:22,289
(They learned the choreography fast like the Avengers.)

1826
01:15:22,890 --> 01:15:25,559
"Our team members are really reliable."

1827
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:27,390
That's what I thought.

1828
01:15:28,199 --> 01:15:32,799
I'm confident that I'll bring my team...

1829
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,130
to the First Tier Zone.

1830
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:37,339
You're really good.

1831
01:15:37,340 --> 01:15:38,340
(Will P1 be able to stand in the 1st Tier Zone?)

1832
01:15:38,341 --> 01:15:40,270
I'm glad you're not my opponents.

1833
01:15:41,010 --> 01:15:42,779
- I'm really glad you're on my team. - One team.

1834
01:15:43,579 --> 01:15:44,608
(P5 practice room)

1835
01:15:44,609 --> 01:15:45,949
First of all...

1836
01:15:46,850 --> 01:15:49,050
Is there anyone who wants to be the leader?

1837
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:53,488
Me. I want to be the leader.

1838
01:15:53,489 --> 01:15:54,960
(Trainee KWON YANGWOO volunteers to be the leader.)

1839
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:57,289
Should I be honest?

1840
01:15:58,659 --> 01:16:00,590
Four of you, please stand here.

1841
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:02,898
I assembled the team.

1842
01:16:02,899 --> 01:16:03,960
(Trainee KWON YANGWOO led the assembly of P5.)

1843
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:08,799
Also, I'm close with most of them compared to others,

1844
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:12,140
so I thought it'd be comfortable for them if I became the leader.

1845
01:16:12,369 --> 01:16:13,739
That's why I wanted to become one.

1846
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:16,509
If I become the leader, I'll make sure everyone...

1847
01:16:16,510 --> 01:16:19,210
makes to the First Tier Zone.

1848
01:16:20,210 --> 01:16:22,679
We'll practice together...

1849
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:26,619
until everyone can pull it off perfectly.

1850
01:16:26,989 --> 01:16:28,920
I think I can make our team go to the First Tier Zone.

1851
01:16:32,729 --> 01:16:35,930
Is there anyone else who wants to become the leader?

1852
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:37,600
If I become the leader...

1853
01:16:39,930 --> 01:16:41,100
I wanted to be in the first place.

1854
01:16:41,869 --> 01:16:43,270
I wanted to be the center.

1855
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:45,640
That's why I volunteered.

1856
01:16:47,909 --> 01:16:49,539
First of all, I learn the choreography fast.

1857
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:52,879
With a video,

1858
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:55,550
I can learn the choreography within an hour.

1859
01:16:57,279 --> 01:17:01,488
I can speak three languages. I can speak Chinese.

1860
01:17:01,489 --> 01:17:04,960
I can speak a bit of Thai.

1861
01:17:05,159 --> 01:17:06,328
- I can speak the languages already. - A multi-language conversation.

1862
01:17:06,329 --> 01:17:08,029
I can proceed with the practice fast.

1863
01:17:08,199 --> 01:17:11,299
I can catch what the younger members want to say.

1864
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:14,269
Sometimes, the older ones don't really understand them.

1865
01:17:14,270 --> 01:17:16,469
I can catch the problems they have...

1866
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:18,239
and proceed with things fast.

1867
01:17:24,779 --> 01:17:26,649
Then let's vote.

1868
01:17:27,449 --> 01:17:30,380
Who wants YICHEN to be the leader?

1869
01:17:30,649 --> 01:17:31,850
Please raise your hand.

1870
01:17:32,550 --> 01:17:36,119
(YICHEN received most votes from the foreign trainees.)

1871
01:17:37,359 --> 01:17:40,090
Who wants YANGWOO to be the leader? Please raise your hand.

1872
01:17:41,130 --> 01:17:43,898
(There's a clear difference in the number of votes.)

1873
01:17:43,899 --> 01:17:45,130
All right. Please lower your hand.

1874
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:51,439
- How did it go? - Here's the result.

1875
01:17:52,470 --> 01:17:54,839
YICHEN will be the leader.

1876
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:56,339
(YICHEN became the leader of P5.)

1877
01:17:56,340 --> 01:17:57,380
Congratulations.

1878
01:17:57,739 --> 01:18:00,149
Thank you.

1879
01:18:02,319 --> 01:18:03,750
- Thank you. - Great.

1880
01:18:04,649 --> 01:18:08,389
I was disappointed, but I think YICHEN became the leader...

1881
01:18:08,390 --> 01:18:10,988
because he was more convincing.

1882
01:18:10,989 --> 01:18:13,129
If I get another chance,

1883
01:18:13,130 --> 01:18:16,100
I'll be more convincing and become the leader.

1884
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,199
I was happy.

1885
01:18:19,569 --> 01:18:21,770
It felt like they approved of me.

1886
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:24,569
We'll practice the choreography, right?

1887
01:18:25,210 --> 01:18:27,310
- We'll have to learn the dance. - We'll have to start with that.

1888
01:18:28,779 --> 01:18:32,880
No. There are many foreigners in our team,

1889
01:18:33,409 --> 01:18:34,679
so we need to practice singing first.

1890
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:36,179
- Okay. - That should come first.

1891
01:18:36,180 --> 01:18:38,149
- Because it's a live performance. - Right.

1892
01:18:38,289 --> 01:18:39,948
Then we'll be carrying on.

1893
01:18:39,949 --> 01:18:41,760
- Let's practice on our own first. - Please proceed.

1894
01:18:42,619 --> 01:18:44,930
If we separate into groups, things move on fast.

1895
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:48,560
I tried to identify their strengths...

1896
01:18:48,659 --> 01:18:51,698
and use them to help others...

1897
01:18:51,699 --> 01:18:53,029
so we could make quick progress.

1898
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:57,238
Match the vocals exactly with these two.

1899
01:18:57,239 --> 01:18:59,368
Give me an hour...

1900
01:18:59,369 --> 01:19:01,909
to learn the choreography so that I can teach you all.

1901
01:19:02,140 --> 01:19:04,979
Then, we'll be able to finish everything within today.

1902
01:19:05,010 --> 01:19:07,278
- Good. Okay. - How does it sound?

1903
01:19:07,279 --> 01:19:08,479
- I like it. - It's good, right?

1904
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:10,579
There’s a procedure for this.

1905
01:19:11,119 --> 01:19:12,988
If I learn the choreography,

1906
01:19:12,989 --> 01:19:15,060
and teach them, the progress will be quick.

1907
01:19:15,260 --> 01:19:18,130
In some cases, we all learn everything together.

1908
01:19:18,289 --> 01:19:20,129
But everyone has different opinions.

1909
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:22,129
The hands should be like this, why are you pointing that way?

1910
01:19:22,130 --> 01:19:24,630
It will be a mess.

1911
01:19:25,229 --> 01:19:27,528
Foreigners, please come to me.

1912
01:19:27,529 --> 01:19:30,699
- Yes. - If you're fluent in Korean,

1913
01:19:30,899 --> 01:19:33,640
- please go to YOUNGWOONG. - We'll be more in detail.

1914
01:19:34,170 --> 01:19:36,009
Run to you

1915
01:19:36,010 --> 01:19:40,109
EUNSUH and I lead the vocal team.

1916
01:19:40,550 --> 01:19:44,079
Koreans could learn the rhythm and pitch right away.

1917
01:19:44,220 --> 01:19:46,288
The foreign members inevitably faced...

1918
01:19:46,289 --> 01:19:48,819
the challenge of having to practice pronunciation first.

1919
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:52,489
Is there anyone who can't read Korean letters?

1920
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:55,499
- Can you read Korean? - No.

1921
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:56,729
(P5 SANTA)

1922
01:19:57,300 --> 01:20:00,568
I'll teach you how to read Korean.

1923
01:20:00,569 --> 01:20:01,600
Okay.

1924
01:20:01,939 --> 01:20:04,238
- It's not... - It's not...

1925
01:20:04,239 --> 01:20:06,139
- too late, - too late.

1926
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:07,339
right?

1927
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:08,939
Right?

1928
01:20:09,310 --> 01:20:10,679
- Each other. - Each other.

1929
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:12,350
- Run. - Run.

1930
01:20:12,710 --> 01:20:15,948
Nothing to fear

1931
01:20:15,949 --> 01:20:18,890
(An unexpected Korean lesson session)

1932
01:20:19,050 --> 01:20:20,119
Let's do it.

1933
01:20:20,890 --> 01:20:22,590
Yes.

1934
01:20:23,020 --> 01:20:24,020
Like this.

1935
01:20:24,021 --> 01:20:26,259
You have to figure it out yourself, right?

1936
01:20:26,260 --> 01:20:27,488
It's just the first day,

1937
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:30,499
and there are many people from other countries,

1938
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:33,799
like China, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan,

1939
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:35,469
and Korea.

1940
01:20:35,470 --> 01:20:39,469
My friends, EUNSUH and many guys that helped me...

1941
01:20:39,470 --> 01:20:41,538
If I had a problem,

1942
01:20:41,539 --> 01:20:43,979
they helped me. It was good.

1943
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:46,948
The timing is up to you

1944
01:20:46,949 --> 01:20:49,549
- Your pronunciation is so good. - Thank you.

1945
01:20:49,550 --> 01:20:50,819
It's a relief.

1946
01:20:51,819 --> 01:20:54,519
It was fun to explain and teach...

1947
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:55,890
in a foreign language.

1948
01:20:56,520 --> 01:21:00,590
I thought we could work hard together.

1949
01:21:00,789 --> 01:21:02,500
I didn't worry much.

1950
01:21:03,130 --> 01:21:05,600
- Here - That's right.

1951
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:07,929
I'll check it for you.

1952
01:21:07,930 --> 01:21:09,000
(After practising the choreography for an hour)

1953
01:21:09,369 --> 01:21:11,969
At that time and place, I decided to...

1954
01:21:11,970 --> 01:21:15,409
do my best to learn the choreography.

1955
01:21:15,609 --> 01:21:17,938
- The timing - The timing

1956
01:21:17,939 --> 01:21:21,408
Shall we sing just once more and start learning choreography?

1957
01:21:21,409 --> 01:21:24,550
Don't we need to record individual live performances?

1958
01:21:24,949 --> 01:21:25,949
You're right.

1959
01:21:25,950 --> 01:21:29,288
Then we need to learn in detail individually.

1960
01:21:29,289 --> 01:21:30,818
Shall we do that?

1961
01:21:30,819 --> 01:21:32,959
For us to record,

1962
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:35,560
we need to do live performances individually.

1963
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:37,299
You need to check...

1964
01:21:37,300 --> 01:21:39,399
his lacking point and focus on that.

1965
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:41,600
If you teach in groups,

1966
01:21:42,670 --> 01:21:43,739
that's impossible.

1967
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:45,908
After learning the song,

1968
01:21:45,909 --> 01:21:48,278
and do a live performance with choreography,

1969
01:21:48,279 --> 01:21:51,279
everyone will say we did well.

1970
01:21:51,979 --> 01:21:55,078
It's better to train individually than in groups for vocals.

1971
01:21:55,079 --> 01:21:56,948
Let's quickly take rotations.

1972
01:21:56,949 --> 01:21:58,618
- Yes. Okay. - Then, we move on to choreography.

1973
01:21:58,619 --> 01:21:59,619
Yes.

1974
01:21:59,850 --> 01:22:02,659
- I think SVIAT can start first. - That's a good idea.

1975
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,688
Let's make two lanes, first.

1976
01:22:04,689 --> 01:22:06,989
(P5 starts practising to sing again.)

1977
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:10,999
- Yes. - Like this, then...

1978
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,470
His way of practising...

1979
01:22:13,729 --> 01:22:15,099
was not for us.

1980
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:16,368
It's not about me,

1981
01:22:16,369 --> 01:22:19,469
but if we practised in a different way,

1982
01:22:19,470 --> 01:22:22,639
and coordinated together as a group,

1983
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:25,449
it would've been better. We weren't able to do that,

1984
01:22:26,210 --> 01:22:27,409
so I felt bad.

1985
01:22:29,119 --> 01:22:32,350
(After practising the choreography for 2 hours)

1986
01:22:33,250 --> 01:22:37,090
(They're practising vocals for 2 hours.)

1987
01:22:38,260 --> 01:22:41,630
The tap helped us find each other

1988
01:22:42,359 --> 01:22:45,729
Overall, from my perspective, everyone needs to...

1989
01:22:45,970 --> 01:22:49,398
repeatedly practice the choreography...

1990
01:22:49,399 --> 01:22:51,140
while playing the MR or AR.

1991
01:22:51,470 --> 01:22:54,539
It's a must to memorize the lyrics.

1992
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:58,810
We can memorize it in our room.

1993
01:22:59,409 --> 01:23:02,949
We didn't learn the choreography yet.

1994
01:23:03,380 --> 01:23:04,750
I'm a bit worried.

1995
01:23:06,750 --> 01:23:08,589
Let's do choreography.

1996
01:23:08,590 --> 01:23:10,319
(P5 starts to practice choreography for the first time.)

1997
01:23:10,890 --> 01:23:13,129
One, two, three, four,

1998
01:23:13,130 --> 01:23:15,329
and five then six.

1999
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:18,328
Like this. No!

2000
01:23:18,329 --> 01:23:20,728
- Not like that. Like this. - Oh, what?

2001
01:23:20,729 --> 01:23:22,100
It's like this.

2002
01:23:22,369 --> 01:23:23,538
Right?

2003
01:23:23,539 --> 01:23:25,368
- Yes. - How was it?

2004
01:23:25,369 --> 01:23:26,709
I thought it was like this.

2005
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:27,738
- Right? - Yes.

2006
01:23:27,739 --> 01:23:29,010
- One, two, three, four. - Okay.

2007
01:23:29,210 --> 01:23:31,479
Five and six.

2008
01:23:32,409 --> 01:23:35,148
One, two, three, four,

2009
01:23:35,149 --> 01:23:37,618
five, six, seven, eight.

2010
01:23:37,619 --> 01:23:39,648
Two, two, three, four,

2011
01:23:39,649 --> 01:23:41,589
five, six, seven, eight.

2012
01:23:41,590 --> 01:23:43,260
Do the watch thing.

2013
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:45,288
- One, two... - Wait.

2014
01:23:45,289 --> 01:23:47,028
We need to organize the steps.

2015
01:23:47,029 --> 01:23:48,460
Do we just do it like this?

2016
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:51,359
Do we just do this at our current position?

2017
01:23:53,729 --> 01:23:55,170
They do like this.

2018
01:23:56,270 --> 01:23:59,009
Like this and then this,

2019
01:23:59,010 --> 01:24:01,109
- and like this. - Oh, gosh.

2020
01:24:01,670 --> 01:24:02,938
- Good. - He said...

2021
01:24:02,939 --> 01:24:05,108
this was the key point of our choreography.

2022
01:24:05,109 --> 01:24:06,949
This is our main choreography.

2023
01:24:07,579 --> 01:24:09,920
- Like this. Teach us. - Let's organize.

2024
01:24:10,220 --> 01:24:11,478
- Like this. - Teach everyone.

2025
01:24:11,479 --> 01:24:13,489
Do this facing the front.

2026
01:24:13,649 --> 01:24:15,219
- Right. - Then turn left.

2027
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:17,089
- Turn left. - Come.

2028
01:24:17,090 --> 01:24:19,130
Turn left and do this,

2029
01:24:19,989 --> 01:24:23,158
and turn your hands like this. Then,

2030
01:24:23,159 --> 01:24:26,029
throw while doing the steps.

2031
01:24:26,399 --> 01:24:27,430
We can be anything

2032
01:24:27,670 --> 01:24:28,939
What was it again?

2033
01:24:29,970 --> 01:24:33,109
- We can be anything - Oh, yes. Here...

2034
01:24:33,510 --> 01:24:36,538
One, two, three, four,

2035
01:24:36,539 --> 01:24:39,609
five, six, seven, eight.

2036
01:24:39,949 --> 01:24:43,948
The star that shines at the tip of your finger

2037
01:24:43,949 --> 01:24:46,050
The end.

2038
01:24:46,220 --> 01:24:47,789
I'm done.

2039
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:52,130
Let's have a short break and look into the details.

2040
01:24:52,390 --> 01:24:53,689
I have something to tell you.

2041
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:56,930
- The details aren't matching. - I'll make them match.

2042
01:24:58,060 --> 01:24:59,669
Here, you can...

2043
01:24:59,670 --> 01:25:01,729
- Shall we start from the beginning? - Yes.

2044
01:25:01,970 --> 01:25:03,869
Okay. First.

2045
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:07,539
Not yet, boom.

2046
01:25:08,170 --> 01:25:09,509
We practised this just now.

2047
01:25:09,510 --> 01:25:10,640
Until here.

2048
01:25:11,340 --> 01:25:14,479
One, two, three. Then...

2049
01:25:14,909 --> 01:25:16,278
Are you feeling okay until here?

2050
01:25:16,279 --> 01:25:18,420
- Let's practice this again. - Yes.

2051
01:25:19,819 --> 01:25:22,960
(They are learning the details of the choreography.)

2052
01:25:26,189 --> 01:25:29,699
(All of a sudden YICHEN is sitting at the corner of the room.)

2053
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:36,840
CHEN was anxious about the lack of...

2054
01:25:37,039 --> 01:25:39,810
vocal practice.

2055
01:25:41,539 --> 01:25:43,839
He suddenly went outside,

2056
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:46,709
and practised singing for 2 to 3 hours.

2057
01:25:46,710 --> 01:25:50,079
Call my name louder Everyone, a little more

2058
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:53,590
Call my name louder

2059
01:25:54,590 --> 01:25:55,760
There's only one practice room.

2060
01:25:56,989 --> 01:25:59,159
I couldn't listen to the song properly.

2061
01:25:59,729 --> 01:26:02,829
So it was hard.

2062
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:06,429
Call my name louder Everyone, a little more

2063
01:26:06,430 --> 01:26:10,538
YICHEN was practising alone for a long time.

2064
01:26:10,539 --> 01:26:12,270
But I understand.

2065
01:26:12,869 --> 01:26:15,810
If he doesn't practice himself,

2066
01:26:16,479 --> 01:26:17,978
no one can help him.

2067
01:26:17,979 --> 01:26:21,979
So he needs to practice alone as well.

2068
01:26:23,850 --> 01:26:26,049
Do you want to practice with AR,

2069
01:26:26,050 --> 01:26:27,689
or MR?

2070
01:26:28,619 --> 01:26:30,589
I think AR would be better.

2071
01:26:30,590 --> 01:26:32,129
- AR? Okay. - Yes.

2072
01:26:32,130 --> 01:26:33,229
(KANG JIMIN prefers AR.)

2073
01:26:33,529 --> 01:26:35,300
The star that shines

2074
01:26:35,829 --> 01:26:39,529
(Focusing to practice choreography with AR)

2075
01:26:45,069 --> 01:26:48,369
(YICHEN is back after his singing practice.)

2076
01:26:50,579 --> 01:26:51,880
Stop.

2077
01:27:01,890 --> 01:27:04,118
There's a problem with this practice.

2078
01:27:04,119 --> 01:27:05,219
- I see. - Right?

2079
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:08,430
- Wait. Is this right? - Yes.

2080
01:27:10,029 --> 01:27:12,130
We need to sing first.

2081
01:27:12,399 --> 01:27:13,868
We shouldn't practice with AR.

2082
01:27:13,869 --> 01:27:15,840
We need to practice with MR.

2083
01:27:16,670 --> 01:27:18,939
We can't sing with the MR now.

2084
01:27:20,439 --> 01:27:23,608
We need to get the song right first...

2085
01:27:23,609 --> 01:27:25,349
before moving on to the choreography.

2086
01:27:25,350 --> 01:27:27,078
We can't sing properly,

2087
01:27:27,079 --> 01:27:29,818
but we're moving on to choreography and practising that.

2088
01:27:29,819 --> 01:27:33,719
I think this way of practice is wrong.

2089
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:36,060
I'm not joining the practice,

2090
01:27:36,489 --> 01:27:39,090
because this is a waste of time.

2091
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:40,988
We need to practice with the MR.

2092
01:27:40,989 --> 01:27:42,460
But he's...

2093
01:27:43,729 --> 01:27:44,799
young.

2094
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:46,568
We need to practice quickly to help.

2095
01:27:46,569 --> 01:27:48,698
But if we aren't ready to help others.

2096
01:27:48,699 --> 01:27:49,770
It doesn't make sense.

2097
01:27:53,539 --> 01:27:56,438
Dreaming, an endless unknown

2098
01:27:56,439 --> 01:27:59,210
We're already here

2099
01:28:01,079 --> 01:28:03,920
(Practice room of P4)

2100
01:28:04,649 --> 01:28:06,250
How about recommending others to be the leader?

2101
01:28:06,350 --> 01:28:08,788
- Shall we recommend? - Yes, I like it.

2102
01:28:08,789 --> 01:28:10,118
A person who's both good at singing and dancing.

2103
01:28:10,119 --> 01:28:13,789
Yes, it would be better to have a person who's good in both.

2104
01:28:14,090 --> 01:28:16,629
I have something to say together with my recommendation.

2105
01:28:16,630 --> 01:28:19,299
- What is it? - When we made our team,

2106
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:22,600
- SUNGMIN was leading. - He's right.

2107
01:28:23,100 --> 01:28:24,568
You said you weren't a leader,

2108
01:28:24,569 --> 01:28:27,210
but you lead us.

2109
01:28:27,510 --> 01:28:30,140
I think you should be the leader.

2110
01:28:30,510 --> 01:28:32,509
I prefer SUNGMIN to be the leader too.

2111
01:28:32,510 --> 01:28:33,749
He doesn't look happy.

2112
01:28:33,750 --> 01:28:37,978
I think the leader should be good at singing and dancing.

2113
01:28:37,979 --> 01:28:39,890
I think the leader should be good at singing and dancing.

2114
01:28:40,119 --> 01:28:41,720
They said it would be best...

2115
01:28:42,090 --> 01:28:44,389
if the leader was outgoing.

2116
01:28:44,390 --> 01:28:47,390
They recommended me to do it.

2117
01:28:48,130 --> 01:28:49,959
I was worried whether I could do it,

2118
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:52,100
but I should do it if they want me to.

2119
01:28:53,199 --> 01:28:54,969
(KIM SUNGMIN has been chosen as the leader.)

2120
01:28:54,970 --> 01:28:56,140
Let's do this.

2121
01:28:57,739 --> 01:29:00,068
My skills may not be excellent,

2122
01:29:00,069 --> 01:29:01,770
but I want to be a leader...

2123
01:29:01,970 --> 01:29:05,809
who looks out for everyone so no one gets left behind.

2124
01:29:05,810 --> 01:29:08,478
In 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

2125
01:29:08,479 --> 01:29:11,020
(P4 is practising hard in the training room.)

2126
01:29:11,149 --> 01:29:13,618
In 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

2127
01:29:13,619 --> 01:29:16,688
(The trainees are catching up quickly after the group class.)

2128
01:29:16,689 --> 01:29:17,919
Five, six.

2129
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:19,489
Okay.

2130
01:29:19,930 --> 01:29:20,988
Let's improve this part.

2131
01:29:20,989 --> 01:29:23,858
In 5, 6, 7, 8.

2132
01:29:23,859 --> 01:29:28,698
In 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

2133
01:29:28,699 --> 01:29:31,600
(One person doesn't seem to be catching up like others.)

2134
01:29:33,170 --> 01:29:34,569
This part?

2135
01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:36,340
Are you okay?

2136
01:29:38,109 --> 01:29:41,579
Let's take it slow.

2137
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:44,879
In 5, 6, 7, 8.

2138
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:46,349
In 1, 2.

2139
01:29:46,350 --> 01:29:50,489
(Struggling)

2140
01:29:51,590 --> 01:29:53,629
It's only been two weeks...

2141
01:29:53,630 --> 01:29:56,158
since I've learned how to dance.

2142
01:29:56,159 --> 01:29:58,459
- I'm stuck. - Move a bit more.

2143
01:29:58,460 --> 01:29:59,828
I was so jealous of them...

2144
01:29:59,829 --> 01:30:01,630
because they could learn the moves almost instantly.

2145
01:30:03,270 --> 01:30:05,170
(Another trainee in dismay)

2146
01:30:06,069 --> 01:30:07,938
In 5, 6, 7, 8.

2147
01:30:07,939 --> 01:30:11,340
(Fumbling)

2148
01:30:12,779 --> 01:30:14,010
I can't memorize it.

2149
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:17,648
For the last move, you should raise your arm to your shoulder.

2150
01:30:17,649 --> 01:30:19,689
Please slow it down.

2151
01:30:20,189 --> 01:30:21,289
Is this right?

2152
01:30:21,550 --> 01:30:22,759
- The right arm goes to your hip. - The right arm?

2153
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:24,089
Then you change it to the opposite direction.

2154
01:30:24,090 --> 01:30:26,488
I didn't get to learn any singing or dancing,

2155
01:30:26,489 --> 01:30:29,930
but I had to do a video evaluation.

2156
01:30:30,229 --> 01:30:32,529
I am extremely worried.

2157
01:30:33,529 --> 01:30:34,529
Go ahead.

2158
01:30:37,239 --> 01:30:40,270
(Another struggling dancer in the corner of the training room)

2159
01:30:42,739 --> 01:30:44,979
I learned dancing for a total of three hours...

2160
01:30:45,109 --> 01:30:47,710
in my whole life.

2161
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:52,889
In 1, 2, 3, 4.

2162
01:30:52,890 --> 01:30:54,419
(The shortest career among the trainees)

2163
01:30:54,420 --> 01:30:55,619
In 1, 2.

2164
01:30:56,020 --> 01:30:58,359
I'm at zero, seriously.

2165
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:02,329
I can feel that my dancing is really bad right now.

2166
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:08,469
What's after this move?

2167
01:31:08,470 --> 01:31:11,738
- Do you have time? - And then...

2168
01:31:11,739 --> 01:31:13,470
Can you teach me how to do it?

2169
01:31:14,010 --> 01:31:15,539
How do I turn my arm?

2170
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:16,909
Just like this.

2171
01:31:19,079 --> 01:31:20,549
Let's do it again but slowly.

2172
01:31:20,550 --> 01:31:22,919
In 5, 6, 7, 8.

2173
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:24,779
- In 1, 2. - Yes.

2174
01:31:24,979 --> 01:31:27,989
- You raise it and throw it away. - Got it.

2175
01:31:28,989 --> 01:31:31,560
(He caught the attention of the directors.)

2176
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:32,930
That's great!

2177
01:31:33,329 --> 01:31:35,859
(The dark horse of P4)

2178
01:31:36,029 --> 01:31:38,599
In 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

2179
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:40,828
He taught me the moves like he was a dance teacher.

2180
01:31:40,829 --> 01:31:43,699
He was going around teaching others 1-on-1.

2181
01:31:43,869 --> 01:31:45,869
How about this part?

2182
01:31:45,939 --> 01:31:46,969
Does it go like this?

2183
01:31:46,970 --> 01:31:49,438
When I was practising with my members,

2184
01:31:49,439 --> 01:31:52,779
I was usually the one leading them.

2185
01:31:52,909 --> 01:31:56,750
It wasn't a burden to me at all.

2186
01:31:57,119 --> 01:32:00,618
Teaching them helped me a lot too.

2187
01:32:00,619 --> 01:32:02,659
It's okay, let me teach you.

2188
01:32:03,689 --> 01:32:06,430
(Gyeongju's best dancer SEO JINWON,)

2189
01:32:06,590 --> 01:32:09,800
(Busan's best dancer KO MINSUNG,)

2190
01:32:11,329 --> 01:32:13,569
(and the stable vocalist SHIN JAEWON...)

2191
01:32:14,300 --> 01:32:17,239
(are the hidden talents in P4.)

2192
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:20,340
I really love my team.

2193
01:32:20,569 --> 01:32:24,239
It's a relief that we have so many talented people.

2194
01:32:24,710 --> 01:32:26,648
No, that's not it.

2195
01:32:26,649 --> 01:32:28,510
(CHOI JUYOUNG is receiving a private lesson.)

2196
01:32:28,979 --> 01:32:30,219
Let's start with the legs.

2197
01:32:30,220 --> 01:32:31,680
That's when you bend down.

2198
01:32:31,850 --> 01:32:32,850
For this part,

2199
01:32:33,250 --> 01:32:35,148
that's how you do it.

2200
01:32:35,149 --> 01:32:37,318
(If it doesn't work, make it work.)

2201
01:32:37,319 --> 01:32:38,989
Move your back like this.

2202
01:32:39,260 --> 01:32:41,028
- Like this. - Like this?

2203
01:32:41,029 --> 01:32:42,398
- That's it. - This?

2204
01:32:42,399 --> 01:32:43,430
Yes!

2205
01:32:44,229 --> 01:32:46,068
You got it. Good job.

2206
01:32:46,069 --> 01:32:47,599
(The awkward duo is getting the hang of it.)

2207
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:49,569
- Nice. - All right.

2208
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,140
You can do it.

2209
01:32:52,439 --> 01:32:53,939
You're doing great.

2210
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:55,839
You got better than last time.

2211
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:57,478
(You did better than last time.)

2212
01:32:57,479 --> 01:32:58,680
I've improved.

2213
01:32:59,279 --> 01:33:01,079
Take a pose as you rotate your hand.

2214
01:33:01,810 --> 01:33:04,618
- Change your feet. - During the practice,

2215
01:33:04,619 --> 01:33:06,519
I faced a lot of challenges,

2216
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:10,819
but my teammates taught me without getting mad.

2217
01:33:11,159 --> 01:33:13,059
We ask and coach each other,

2218
01:33:13,060 --> 01:33:14,659
so it builds a great atmosphere.

2219
01:33:16,199 --> 01:33:18,729
(A short break)

2220
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:21,869
- Are you sleepy? - Yes, I'm a bit exhausted.

2221
01:33:21,970 --> 01:33:23,100
Are you taking a break?

2222
01:33:24,539 --> 01:33:26,609
- Did you finish the dance? - Yes, I did.

2223
01:33:26,739 --> 01:33:28,368
I just finished it.

2224
01:33:28,369 --> 01:33:29,680
The leader is...

2225
01:33:30,109 --> 01:33:32,179
usually the mood maker.

2226
01:33:32,180 --> 01:33:34,209
I think that word suits a leader best.

2227
01:33:34,210 --> 01:33:35,278
Go for it.

2228
01:33:35,279 --> 01:33:36,448
Come on!

2229
01:33:36,449 --> 01:33:39,389
If I feel like the atmosphere was getting a bit dull,

2230
01:33:39,390 --> 01:33:41,188
- I tried livening up the mood. - We can do it.

2231
01:33:41,189 --> 01:33:43,288
- I'll do it. - Oh, no.

2232
01:33:43,289 --> 01:33:44,818
(The leader looks after his teammates.)

2233
01:33:44,819 --> 01:33:45,859
This is first aid.

2234
01:33:47,229 --> 01:33:49,100
(You can do it.)

2235
01:33:49,329 --> 01:33:50,659
You can do it, brother.

2236
01:33:52,699 --> 01:33:55,369
I think the atmosphere during our practice was great.

2237
01:33:55,939 --> 01:33:57,899
My goodness.

2238
01:33:58,199 --> 01:33:59,709
We should clap when we go in.

2239
01:33:59,710 --> 01:34:00,839
Let's go in.

2240
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:03,840
Can you stand in two lines while facing us?

2241
01:34:04,340 --> 01:34:05,809
- Yes. - Let's greet them first.

2242
01:34:05,810 --> 01:34:06,879
- Okay. - Yes.

2243
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:08,278
- Okay. - Should we do the one earlier?

2244
01:34:08,279 --> 01:34:09,319
- Okay. - All right.

2245
01:34:10,779 --> 01:34:11,978
In 1, 2, 3.

2246
01:34:11,979 --> 01:34:14,719
We are Pipo Pipo, and we're here to steal...

2247
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:16,358
the hearts of the World Assemblers.

2248
01:34:16,359 --> 01:34:17,389
- Oh, my. - Pipo?

2249
01:34:17,390 --> 01:34:19,189
Oh, they meant "P4 P4."

2250
01:34:19,430 --> 01:34:21,059
Shall we check out 10 members...

2251
01:34:21,060 --> 01:34:22,599
- at a time? - Let's talk after we watch you.

2252
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:23,728
Let's start with the front row.

2253
01:34:23,729 --> 01:34:24,760
- Yes. - Okay.

2254
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,529
(Will P4 get through the evaluation safely?)

2255
01:34:28,729 --> 01:34:33,969
I hope it's not too late I'm coming back to you

2256
01:34:33,970 --> 01:34:36,140
I'm running I'm running

2257
01:34:36,439 --> 01:34:38,680
(Doing their best)

2258
01:34:38,909 --> 01:34:41,778
We're already here

2259
01:34:41,779 --> 01:34:44,148
Running to you

2260
01:34:44,149 --> 01:34:46,148
Up to you now

2261
01:34:46,149 --> 01:34:48,249
I'm running

2262
01:34:48,250 --> 01:34:50,260
(KIM SUNGMIN missed a beat.)

2263
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:54,158
I'll run to you

2264
01:34:54,159 --> 01:34:55,489
I am running!

2265
01:34:56,130 --> 01:34:57,199
(Giggling)

2266
01:34:57,630 --> 01:34:59,429
The timing is up to you

2267
01:34:59,430 --> 01:35:01,270
Call my name louder

2268
01:35:01,829 --> 01:35:04,869
(The beat gets faster little by little.)

2269
01:35:05,039 --> 01:35:07,369
(Follow the beat.)

2270
01:35:08,409 --> 01:35:11,279
(SHIN JAEWON gets them back on track to the beat.)

2271
01:35:14,449 --> 01:35:15,549
Thank you.

2272
01:35:15,550 --> 01:35:16,818
They're disorganized and not that good,

2273
01:35:16,819 --> 01:35:18,879
but I can't seem to hate them.

2274
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:21,249
We have different charms.

2275
01:35:21,250 --> 01:35:24,220
It's great to see how everyone is doing their best,

2276
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:25,959
but your singing is not on beat,

2277
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:27,759
and your dancing is not on beat either.

2278
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:31,100
You will have to choose one person to practice efficiently.

2279
01:35:31,460 --> 01:35:32,930
- SUNGMIN. - Yes.

2280
01:35:33,869 --> 01:35:36,500
What do you think a leader should do?

2281
01:35:36,939 --> 01:35:38,938
He has to lead his teammates...

2282
01:35:38,939 --> 01:35:42,640
and make sure his teammates don't lack anything.

2283
01:35:43,279 --> 01:35:46,109
In my opinion, I think a leader should be good.

2284
01:35:46,479 --> 01:35:48,679
It's good to maintain a good relationship,

2285
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:50,250
but the key role of a leader...

2286
01:35:50,720 --> 01:35:52,719
is to lead the team...

2287
01:35:52,720 --> 01:35:54,688
to give a good performance.

2288
01:35:54,689 --> 01:35:57,859
You have to practice 2 or 3 times harder than others.

2289
01:35:58,090 --> 01:36:02,158
I think it would impress us if you could show us...

2290
01:36:02,159 --> 01:36:03,728
that you did your best...

2291
01:36:03,729 --> 01:36:05,630
in carrying out your role as a leader meaningfully.

2292
01:36:06,329 --> 01:36:07,929
For JUYOUNG,

2293
01:36:07,930 --> 01:36:09,299
you really have to work hard.

2294
01:36:09,300 --> 01:36:10,969
You have to get this right even if it takes you all night.

2295
01:36:10,970 --> 01:36:12,399
Yes.

2296
01:36:13,340 --> 01:36:15,108
- Let's do this. - Let's do this.

2297
01:36:15,109 --> 01:36:17,108
- Good luck. - We can do this.

2298
01:36:17,109 --> 01:36:19,148
- ABE YURA. - Yes.

2299
01:36:19,149 --> 01:36:20,949
- He won 1st place. - The 1st place?

2300
01:36:21,079 --> 01:36:23,078
- That's ABE YURA. - He won first place during class.

2301
01:36:23,079 --> 01:36:24,978
- Really? - He learns fast.

2302
01:36:24,979 --> 01:36:26,050
Good luck.

2303
01:36:26,789 --> 01:36:27,949
- Let's go. - Shall we start?

2304
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:34,089
(KIM YOONSUE makes a mistake from the start.)

2305
01:36:34,090 --> 01:36:35,788
I hope it's not too late I'm coming back to you

2306
01:36:35,789 --> 01:36:37,929
I'm running I'm running

2307
01:36:37,930 --> 01:36:41,669
Get ready, let's run Assemble up, come on

2308
01:36:41,670 --> 01:36:45,669
Beyond my limits until the end Run to you

2309
01:36:45,670 --> 01:36:46,770
YURA is good.

2310
01:36:47,569 --> 01:36:51,210
(Passion)

2311
01:36:52,239 --> 01:36:54,979
(Struggling)

2312
01:36:55,149 --> 01:36:58,578
Now, in a new world

2313
01:36:58,579 --> 01:37:00,549
We can be anything, I'm

2314
01:37:00,550 --> 01:37:03,920
(He finishes the song despite his members' mistakes.)

2315
01:37:04,359 --> 01:37:06,390
It makes me happy that they're doing their best.

2316
01:37:06,659 --> 01:37:08,988
I have a question for YUNSUE.

2317
01:37:08,989 --> 01:37:12,399
- You're sincere about this, right? - Yes.

2318
01:37:12,670 --> 01:37:15,939
You're not taking this for granted...

2319
01:37:16,100 --> 01:37:17,839
just because you model for fashion shows, right?

2320
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:18,840
Not at all.

2321
01:37:19,239 --> 01:37:21,469
Because you're taking on a new challenge here,

2322
01:37:21,470 --> 01:37:23,078
I hope you do your best.

2323
01:37:23,079 --> 01:37:24,380
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

2324
01:37:25,979 --> 01:37:27,249
When I heard that,

2325
01:37:27,250 --> 01:37:29,818
I felt that I was...

2326
01:37:29,819 --> 01:37:32,448
bringing my teammates down.

2327
01:37:32,449 --> 01:37:35,090
It really pierced my heart.

2328
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:38,619
I'm frustrated.

2329
01:37:41,689 --> 01:37:44,899
I'm not as good as the other trainees,

2330
01:37:45,300 --> 01:37:47,770
so I shouldn't be bringing them down.

2331
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:50,670
Well...

2332
01:37:51,199 --> 01:37:54,810
I kept going around and asking other teammates,

2333
01:37:55,369 --> 01:37:58,340
so I felt like I was disrupting their practice.

2334
01:37:58,579 --> 01:38:00,079
My teammates might wonder...

2335
01:38:00,510 --> 01:38:02,408
why I'm on their team...

2336
01:38:02,409 --> 01:38:04,479
with my level of skills.

2337
01:38:05,779 --> 01:38:08,119
I felt like this was a matter of how much practice I put in.

2338
01:38:09,220 --> 01:38:10,420
Then raise them.

2339
01:38:12,390 --> 01:38:14,488
Why can't I get it?

2340
01:38:14,489 --> 01:38:16,199
(What is the result of the video evaluation for P4?)

2341
01:38:17,430 --> 01:38:20,369
(P2's training room)

2342
01:38:20,770 --> 01:38:23,438
Can you raise your hand if you want to be the leader?

2343
01:38:23,439 --> 01:38:26,238
You can make recommendations or raise your own hand.

2344
01:38:26,239 --> 01:38:27,270
I'd like to recommend someone.

2345
01:38:28,069 --> 01:38:29,339
- Yes. - I pick SIHUN.

2346
01:38:29,340 --> 01:38:31,078
- I recommend SIHUN. - I recommend HEEDO.

2347
01:38:31,079 --> 01:38:32,778
I also recommend HEEDO.

2348
01:38:32,779 --> 01:38:34,778
I also recommend HEEDO.

2349
01:38:34,779 --> 01:38:37,118
I also recommend HEEDO.

2350
01:38:37,119 --> 01:38:40,619
He's the one who gathered all of us here.

2351
01:38:40,850 --> 01:38:44,259
He's mature and has a strong leadership.

2352
01:38:44,260 --> 01:38:46,060
He has the ability to embrace everyone.

2353
01:38:46,159 --> 01:38:51,499
Most importantly, he's been a trainee for ten years,

2354
01:38:51,500 --> 01:38:52,800
so I can rely on him and follow him.

2355
01:38:52,930 --> 01:38:54,100
A man who suits an armband.

2356
01:38:55,470 --> 01:38:58,439
Hello, I'm the leader of P2,

2357
01:38:59,069 --> 01:39:01,170
YOO HEEDO. It's good to be here.

2358
01:39:02,539 --> 01:39:05,079
I got to lead the team in the first mission,

2359
01:39:05,310 --> 01:39:07,479
but let's be responsible together...

2360
01:39:07,579 --> 01:39:10,579
and think of it as a team where we all work together.

2361
01:39:10,779 --> 01:39:11,779
Let's do this.

2362
01:39:11,780 --> 01:39:13,889
- Okay. - Let's go!

2363
01:39:13,890 --> 01:39:14,890
All right. Let's go.

2364
01:39:17,289 --> 01:39:18,359
Here you go.

2365
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:20,130
JUCHAN.

2366
01:39:21,029 --> 01:39:23,059
DOKYEONG. For your information, he's our eldest.

2367
01:39:23,060 --> 01:39:24,529
Our DOKYEONG.

2368
01:39:26,899 --> 01:39:29,639
I thought I could trust him...

2369
01:39:29,640 --> 01:39:30,799
and follow him.

2370
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:34,710
I think he'll have a good influence on our team.

2371
01:39:35,470 --> 01:39:37,180
- I'll assist you. - Thank you.

2372
01:39:39,649 --> 01:39:42,609
I hope he becomes a leader...

2373
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:45,020
who can boost everyone's confidence.

2374
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:46,789
- EUNHO. - Yes.

2375
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:49,390
- Let's do this. - Thank you in advance.

2376
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:50,890
JOONWOO. The taekwondo boy.

2377
01:39:51,989 --> 01:39:52,989
HEEJU.

2378
01:39:53,329 --> 01:39:54,890
- Let's go, HEEJU. - Let's go.

2379
01:39:55,829 --> 01:39:56,829
All right.

2380
01:39:58,829 --> 01:40:01,029
I haven't memorized the lyrics yet,

2381
01:40:01,300 --> 01:40:02,938
so I'll just count the beats.

2382
01:40:02,939 --> 01:40:04,039
- Okay. - All right.

2383
01:40:04,300 --> 01:40:06,868
We start with our right foot, but we go down a bit.

2384
01:40:06,869 --> 01:40:09,039
Like this. Ready.

2385
01:40:09,710 --> 01:40:10,810
Like this.

2386
01:40:11,539 --> 01:40:13,810
The key is...

2387
01:40:13,909 --> 01:40:17,119
giving an impact when you step forward.

2388
01:40:17,680 --> 01:40:20,220
- Okay. - One, two.

2389
01:40:20,890 --> 01:40:22,419
- Let's start from there. - Okay.

2390
01:40:22,420 --> 01:40:23,760
Seven, eight.

2391
01:40:23,960 --> 01:40:25,789
Down.

2392
01:40:26,060 --> 01:40:28,329
Up, down.

2393
01:40:28,760 --> 01:40:29,858
One. I'm sorry.

2394
01:40:29,859 --> 01:40:32,229
Up, down. After going down, go forward with your left foot.

2395
01:40:32,399 --> 01:40:34,729
Let's go forward with our left foot. Let's move on. Next.

2396
01:40:35,130 --> 01:40:38,039
(The leader is stuck all of a sudden.)

2397
01:40:43,239 --> 01:40:45,439
As you step forward with your left foot,

2398
01:40:45,979 --> 01:40:49,109
throw a punch like this.

2399
01:40:49,350 --> 01:40:50,448
After the punch...

2400
01:40:50,449 --> 01:40:51,449
(Standing still)

2401
01:40:52,819 --> 01:40:55,949
(Many of them couldn't understand.)

2402
01:40:57,020 --> 01:40:58,189
- Are you okay? - Yes.

2403
01:40:58,819 --> 01:41:00,590
- Hey, are you okay? - Yes.

2404
01:41:01,130 --> 01:41:03,398
You okay?

2405
01:41:03,399 --> 01:41:04,898
It looks like this in the video.

2406
01:41:04,899 --> 01:41:06,800
- Are you okay? - Yes, I am.

2407
01:41:07,899 --> 01:41:09,029
Let's move on.

2408
01:41:10,100 --> 01:41:11,238
(Sighing)

2409
01:41:11,239 --> 01:41:12,239
One second.

2410
01:41:12,699 --> 01:41:15,510
Call my name louder

2411
01:41:18,810 --> 01:41:21,078
(He's stuck again.)

2412
01:41:21,079 --> 01:41:25,250
Everyone, a little more

2413
01:41:26,750 --> 01:41:27,920
Let's try it again.

2414
01:41:32,060 --> 01:41:33,659
The lyrics are confusing.

2415
01:41:34,529 --> 01:41:36,260
- One second. - Okay.

2416
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:46,000
(He learns the choreography quickly.)

2417
01:41:49,140 --> 01:41:52,409
(Scratching)

2418
01:41:52,779 --> 01:41:53,978
As you turn your hand,

2419
01:41:53,979 --> 01:41:56,180
come back to the center with your right foot first and left foot.

2420
01:41:56,680 --> 01:41:57,680
Right foot and left foot.

2421
01:41:59,789 --> 01:42:02,619
Hold your hand and bring it to your heart.

2422
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:04,920
Like this.

2423
01:42:06,729 --> 01:42:08,629
(He's stuck for the third time.)

2424
01:42:08,630 --> 01:42:10,260
All right. Next...

2425
01:42:11,399 --> 01:42:12,399
One second.

2426
01:42:14,399 --> 01:42:16,599
I wondered if that was...

2427
01:42:16,600 --> 01:42:18,100
the right way.

2428
01:42:18,199 --> 01:42:20,839
Actually, we don't know how much time...

2429
01:42:20,840 --> 01:42:22,269
is given to us.

2430
01:42:22,270 --> 01:42:24,210
We needed to move on fast,

2431
01:42:24,310 --> 01:42:26,249
but we couldn't. We were slow.

2432
01:42:26,250 --> 01:42:27,810
You know how when your head doesn't follow?

2433
01:42:28,579 --> 01:42:31,278
I was like, "What was that move again?"

2434
01:42:31,279 --> 01:42:33,390
"What did I just see? What was it?"

2435
01:42:33,850 --> 01:42:36,560
I suddenly went, "What did I just think of?"

2436
01:42:37,689 --> 01:42:38,859
I was dazed.

2437
01:42:41,260 --> 01:42:44,729
(Learning the choreography with higher ranking trainees)

2438
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:48,470
I hope it's not too late

2439
01:42:48,670 --> 01:42:51,100
Let's try it slowly. Even if you don't know the words yet,

2440
01:42:51,300 --> 01:42:53,140
just memorize them as you practice.

2441
01:42:53,770 --> 01:42:56,209
Five, six, seven, eight.

2442
01:42:56,210 --> 01:42:59,979
(Trainee KIM SIHUN teaches the lower-ranking trainees.)

2443
01:43:00,979 --> 01:43:05,250
I'm coming back to you

2444
01:43:05,350 --> 01:43:06,520
Boom, clap.

2445
01:43:06,819 --> 01:43:08,649
- Go. - Go. Okay, one more time.

2446
01:43:09,590 --> 01:43:12,189
(Thanks to the lesson, the trainees are slowly dancing in sync.)

2447
01:43:12,390 --> 01:43:15,189
We're already here

2448
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:16,960
One more time.

2449
01:43:17,329 --> 01:43:21,899
The tap helped us find each other

2450
01:43:22,399 --> 01:43:23,399
Let's try it one more time.

2451
01:43:24,770 --> 01:43:28,770
Actually, no matter which assembly I belonged to,

2452
01:43:29,010 --> 01:43:32,409
I wanted to be with members...

2453
01:43:33,449 --> 01:43:36,679
who needed my help...

2454
01:43:36,680 --> 01:43:39,619
rather than just talented ones.

2455
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:41,890
That's what I wanted.

2456
01:43:42,550 --> 01:43:46,289
One, two, and... Pull yourself up.

2457
01:43:47,130 --> 01:43:48,130
And clap here.

2458
01:43:48,260 --> 01:43:49,930
Yes. Great.

2459
01:43:50,659 --> 01:43:53,470
SIHUN, what comes after this?

2460
01:43:59,640 --> 01:44:00,640
Thank you.

2461
01:44:00,939 --> 01:44:03,039
He didn't give up...

2462
01:44:03,479 --> 01:44:05,578
on teaching those who were lacking,

2463
01:44:05,579 --> 01:44:06,850
including myself.

2464
01:44:07,609 --> 01:44:10,519
Singing and dancing repeatedly...

2465
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:12,319
helped me a lot.

2466
01:44:12,550 --> 01:44:15,350
One, two, three, four, and five.

2467
01:44:15,789 --> 01:44:17,520
Just remember this part properly.

2468
01:44:17,720 --> 01:44:19,960
Five, six, seven, eight.

2469
01:44:20,060 --> 01:44:22,029
I'll run to you

2470
01:44:22,130 --> 01:44:23,130
Boom, clap.

2471
01:44:23,131 --> 01:44:25,299
Two, three, eight, one.

2472
01:44:25,300 --> 01:44:26,300
Yes. Okay.

2473
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:29,328
One, two, three, four,

2474
01:44:29,329 --> 01:44:31,438
five, six, seven, eight.

2475
01:44:31,439 --> 01:44:34,109
One, two, three, four, five...

2476
01:44:34,609 --> 01:44:35,739
You can't be wrong by now.

2477
01:44:36,710 --> 01:44:39,439
Your body needs to be used to it now.

2478
01:44:39,979 --> 01:44:41,810
Okay, let's try it again. Let's try with the lyrics.

2479
01:44:43,119 --> 01:44:45,149
Now that we've learned the choreography,

2480
01:44:45,579 --> 01:44:49,250
I think it'll be better for those who need to earn points tomorrow...

2481
01:44:49,619 --> 01:44:52,260
to practice dancing in sync...

2482
01:44:52,590 --> 01:44:53,689
among themselves.

2483
01:44:54,989 --> 01:44:59,829
As of now, we need to show our skills,

2484
01:45:00,430 --> 01:45:03,538
so we needed the members...

2485
01:45:03,539 --> 01:45:05,139
who could attract the audience.

2486
01:45:05,140 --> 01:45:06,470
The leader, HEEDO,

2487
01:45:06,909 --> 01:45:10,180
gathered the trainees who could lead the team.

2488
01:45:12,310 --> 01:45:14,550
"Let's make up for the points of the lacking members."

2489
01:45:14,979 --> 01:45:17,019
Our team's goal is to raise...

2490
01:45:17,020 --> 01:45:18,449
our average points.

2491
01:45:21,449 --> 01:45:23,819
It'd be a lie to say I wasn't dispirited.

2492
01:45:25,460 --> 01:45:28,159
I thought it was only natural.

2493
01:45:29,390 --> 01:45:30,460
But it still upset me.

2494
01:45:31,430 --> 01:45:34,270
(P2's strategy is to enforce the trainees who are already good.)

2495
01:45:35,470 --> 01:45:36,500
Oh, great.

2496
01:45:37,069 --> 01:45:38,069
Yes.

2497
01:45:38,369 --> 01:45:40,769
I think it'll be better if you could sing louder.

2498
01:45:40,770 --> 01:45:41,839
All right.

2499
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:44,139
You're already giving off 200 percent of your power.

2500
01:45:44,140 --> 01:45:45,180
You have more than enough.

2501
01:45:45,909 --> 01:45:48,149
You need to loosen when you should so you can look more rhythmical.

2502
01:45:48,250 --> 01:45:49,850
- Okay. - Please keep that in mind.

2503
01:45:49,979 --> 01:45:51,220
Where is my iPad?

2504
01:45:55,449 --> 01:45:57,960
The tap helped us find each other

2505
01:45:57,989 --> 01:46:00,859
Actually, we need individual practices the most.

2506
01:46:01,630 --> 01:46:04,728
I think it's meaningless to sync the dance...

2507
01:46:04,729 --> 01:46:06,000
as a group now.

2508
01:46:06,159 --> 01:46:07,569
Falling back

2509
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:09,529
Run

2510
01:46:12,569 --> 01:46:14,239
I think I should be of help...

2511
01:46:14,869 --> 01:46:19,710
to our team, no matter what.

2512
01:46:19,979 --> 01:46:22,449
Dreaming of the endless unknown

2513
01:46:22,479 --> 01:46:24,979
I was confident in that...

2514
01:46:25,380 --> 01:46:28,689
because I just needed to do my best and do my part.

2515
01:46:30,920 --> 01:46:34,930
(What kind of result will P2's leader's strategy bring?)

2516
01:46:35,489 --> 01:46:38,500
Let's pick our leader who will lead P3 to the First Tier Zone.

2517
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:40,729
- First Tier Zone. - It's so pressuring.

2518
01:46:41,500 --> 01:46:43,340
- Did I put it wrong? - It's so pressuring.

2519
01:46:43,970 --> 01:46:45,969
Is there anyone who wants to be the leader?

2520
01:46:45,970 --> 01:46:47,609
- Who wants to be? - Any volunteers?

2521
01:46:49,539 --> 01:46:50,979
I'll bring us to the First Tier Zone.

2522
01:46:53,779 --> 01:46:55,948
I think I can make the group...

2523
01:46:55,949 --> 01:46:58,948
dance well together.

2524
01:46:58,949 --> 01:47:00,390
(Trainee KIM JIMIN boasts his dancing skills.)

2525
01:47:01,220 --> 01:47:02,550
(During Zero Setting)

2526
01:47:03,260 --> 01:47:06,460
(He performed "Supernatural" by NewJeans in his own style.)

2527
01:47:06,829 --> 01:47:08,129
(You danced well,)

2528
01:47:08,130 --> 01:47:09,260
(and you sang well too.)

2529
01:47:09,590 --> 01:47:12,359
(Trainee Kim JIMIN was highly praised by the director.)

2530
01:47:13,130 --> 01:47:14,930
I think I can do well.

2531
01:47:15,670 --> 01:47:17,438
Who wants to be...

2532
01:47:17,439 --> 01:47:19,699
(I want to be the leader too.)

2533
01:47:20,270 --> 01:47:22,439
(Second volunteer, Trainee AHN JUNWON)

2534
01:47:22,770 --> 01:47:25,840
Of course, I lack skills and still have to learn a lot,

2535
01:47:26,609 --> 01:47:30,249
but as you've seen, I can be quite the energizer.

2536
01:47:30,250 --> 01:47:32,619
- Energy. - I can...

2537
01:47:32,850 --> 01:47:34,589
create the mood where everyone works together...

2538
01:47:34,590 --> 01:47:38,358
and practices together without getting tired.

2539
01:47:38,359 --> 01:47:39,359
(This guy who considers himself the life of the party...)

2540
01:47:40,689 --> 01:47:41,689
How do you feel?

2541
01:47:41,690 --> 01:47:43,060
(It's their first time seeing each other.)

2542
01:47:43,930 --> 01:47:45,159
- Nervous. - Are you nervous?

2543
01:47:45,930 --> 01:47:48,100
- You're dead. - No! Okay.

2544
01:47:48,529 --> 01:47:49,770
(He got hit in the nose.)

2545
01:47:49,869 --> 01:47:51,140
Hey, are you okay?

2546
01:47:51,239 --> 01:47:52,739
I'm older than you.

2547
01:47:53,210 --> 01:47:54,970
We should become talents that everyone wants.

2548
01:47:55,539 --> 01:47:57,539
I'm going to go and grind my knee cartilages.

2549
01:47:58,210 --> 01:48:00,749
I'm glad. I'm so glad.

2550
01:48:00,750 --> 01:48:02,379
(Trainee AHN JUNWON is a ray of sunshine.)

2551
01:48:02,380 --> 01:48:03,879
I'm exceptionally responsible.

2552
01:48:03,880 --> 01:48:05,750
- Gosh. - Give him an applause.

2553
01:48:06,520 --> 01:48:07,520
Exceptionally responsible.

2554
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:12,989
Shall we vote by show of hands?

2555
01:48:13,329 --> 01:48:14,858
- Then I... - Please close your eyes.

2556
01:48:14,859 --> 01:48:16,960
(Who will become the leader of P3?)

2557
01:48:18,930 --> 01:48:19,930
It's me.

2558
01:48:20,170 --> 01:48:22,328
(Leader of P3, AHN JUNWON)

2559
01:48:22,329 --> 01:48:24,069
I became the leader.

2560
01:48:24,600 --> 01:48:26,140
What I was confident about was...

2561
01:48:26,609 --> 01:48:28,839
my ability to maintain energy...

2562
01:48:28,840 --> 01:48:31,939
and create a synergy effect without getting tired over time.

2563
01:48:32,279 --> 01:48:34,209
I think others recognized that ability...

2564
01:48:34,210 --> 01:48:35,710
and chose me as their leader.

2565
01:48:35,979 --> 01:48:39,180
- I'll do my best! - Way to go.

2566
01:48:39,550 --> 01:48:40,989
- Congratulations. - I'll...

2567
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:45,119
He had a knack for speaking cleverly...

2568
01:48:45,260 --> 01:48:48,659
and seemed to possess leadership qualities as a leader.

2569
01:48:49,289 --> 01:48:51,760
(P3 starts to practice right away.)

2570
01:48:52,329 --> 01:48:56,529
(P3 has a lot of members who are good at dancing.)

2571
01:48:57,039 --> 01:48:59,600
(They have exclusive access to the choreography video.)

2572
01:48:59,869 --> 01:49:01,939
I saw them from the back.

2573
01:49:02,170 --> 01:49:03,779
I saw all of them dancing.

2574
01:49:04,210 --> 01:49:07,109
People who stood out were JIMIN,

2575
01:49:07,550 --> 01:49:09,680
WANGSEOK, and NOYUL.

2576
01:49:10,579 --> 01:49:13,520
I think NOYUL memorized choreography too.

2577
01:49:13,890 --> 01:49:16,318
Maybe the three can lead our choreography.

2578
01:49:16,319 --> 01:49:17,319
Sounds good.

2579
01:49:18,260 --> 01:49:21,560
For us to reach the First Tier, the team needs to perform well.

2580
01:49:21,930 --> 01:49:24,100
In a good atmosphere where everyone remains energized.

2581
01:49:24,859 --> 01:49:25,999
- Let's do this. - Let's do our best.

2582
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:27,000
Is there some progress?

2583
01:49:27,229 --> 01:49:28,399
Do you want to come inside a bit?

2584
01:49:29,329 --> 01:49:30,399
Come inside a bit.

2585
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:33,068
- Are you good? - I'm good.

2586
01:49:33,069 --> 01:49:35,369
- Are you good? - Yes, I'm good.

2587
01:49:36,210 --> 01:49:37,380
I'm working hard...

2588
01:49:37,479 --> 01:49:40,050
to put in my best effort and deliver...

2589
01:49:40,479 --> 01:49:41,909
a high-quality performance.

2590
01:49:42,380 --> 01:49:45,350
Dreaming of the endless unknown

2591
01:49:45,880 --> 01:49:50,020
(Everyone's focusing on practising in their own ways.)

2592
01:49:50,859 --> 01:49:56,329
(Singing their hearts out)

2593
01:49:56,899 --> 01:49:58,199
Hello.

2594
01:49:59,300 --> 01:50:03,100
- Hello. - Now, in a new world

2595
01:50:03,130 --> 01:50:05,239
- Hello. - We can be anything, I'm

2596
01:50:05,569 --> 01:50:07,539
(He didn't see him yet.)

2597
01:50:08,170 --> 01:50:09,908
Aren't you going to stand?

2598
01:50:09,909 --> 01:50:12,478
- Hello. - Hello.

2599
01:50:12,479 --> 01:50:13,979
(Directors suddenly roamed in.)

2600
01:50:14,649 --> 01:50:16,350
We didn't expect to see them like that.

2601
01:50:17,180 --> 01:50:19,550
We were quite surprised.

2602
01:50:20,289 --> 01:50:21,890
Next time, please tell us in prior.

2603
01:50:22,619 --> 01:50:23,619
It was scary.

2604
01:50:25,489 --> 01:50:26,489
Shall we have a look?

2605
01:50:26,489 --> 01:50:27,489
(Directors' sudden interim check)

2606
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:30,630
(They try to perform as practised,)

2607
01:50:31,329 --> 01:50:34,100
(but NAM JIWOON is busy keeping up with the choreography.)

2608
01:50:35,770 --> 01:50:39,670
(The leader can't keep up too.)

2609
01:50:41,869 --> 01:50:43,409
Hey, stop!

2610
01:50:44,340 --> 01:50:46,579
Just stop.

2611
01:50:48,380 --> 01:50:49,810
They're seriously bad.

2612
01:50:50,319 --> 01:50:52,319
(Sighing)

2613
01:50:53,390 --> 01:50:58,520
This is seriously bad.

2614
01:50:59,859 --> 01:51:01,789
- JUNWON. - Yes.

2615
01:51:02,789 --> 01:51:05,800
You're not a class monitor or a comedian.

2616
01:51:05,899 --> 01:51:07,100
You're a leader.

2617
01:51:07,630 --> 01:51:09,368
A leader should lead the practice...

2618
01:51:09,369 --> 01:51:11,099
and the team.

2619
01:51:11,100 --> 01:51:13,770
- That's what I think. - Yes.

2620
01:51:14,239 --> 01:51:15,769
You may not be perfect,

2621
01:51:15,770 --> 01:51:20,408
but you should at least have it memorized.

2622
01:51:20,409 --> 01:51:22,148
I like the high spirit,

2623
01:51:22,149 --> 01:51:25,319
but no one will recognize if you perform badly.

2624
01:51:26,149 --> 01:51:30,720
I have no idea why you're the leader.

2625
01:51:31,420 --> 01:51:36,090
I have no idea why you're the leader.

2626
01:51:36,229 --> 01:51:37,959
Team members, you should think carefully.

2627
01:51:37,960 --> 01:51:40,729
You can't choose anyone to be your leader.

2628
01:51:41,270 --> 01:51:44,499
I believe the team can change...

2629
01:51:44,500 --> 01:51:47,069
depending on how the leader acts.

2630
01:51:47,770 --> 01:51:49,969
If you want to continue to be a leader,

2631
01:51:49,970 --> 01:51:51,680
you need to work harder,

2632
01:51:52,239 --> 01:51:56,350
and you should perform better.

2633
01:51:56,710 --> 01:51:57,720
- Yes. - Okay.

2634
01:51:59,449 --> 01:52:02,948
In fact, everything that she said...

2635
01:52:02,949 --> 01:52:04,289
was right.

2636
01:52:05,220 --> 01:52:06,959
Because my rank is low,

2637
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:09,760
I wanted to show something, which is why I became a leader.

2638
01:52:10,359 --> 01:52:14,469
I think I may have led the team...

2639
01:52:14,470 --> 01:52:18,239
down a more difficult path.

2640
01:52:20,640 --> 01:52:23,069
(After the directors' interim check)

2641
01:52:24,039 --> 01:52:25,039
Well,

2642
01:52:26,140 --> 01:52:29,449
thank you for your efforts.

2643
01:52:32,319 --> 01:52:35,119
I thought that even now,

2644
01:52:36,520 --> 01:52:39,219
re-electing a leader could be a way...

2645
01:52:39,220 --> 01:52:40,930
for us to perform better.

2646
01:52:42,329 --> 01:52:45,829
(Are we changing our leader?)

2647
01:52:47,300 --> 01:52:49,329
Because after all...

2648
01:52:50,569 --> 01:52:54,938
The leader's words carry a lot of weight.

2649
01:52:54,939 --> 01:52:56,109
(The leader's bombshell statement surprised them.)

2650
01:52:57,939 --> 01:52:58,939
Well,

2651
01:52:59,609 --> 01:53:03,050
I wanted to make my team survive.

2652
01:53:04,180 --> 01:53:10,020
If we change the leader,

2653
01:53:10,760 --> 01:53:13,658
I think LEE NOYUL,

2654
01:53:13,659 --> 01:53:18,630
who was supposed to teach choreography would be a good leader.

2655
01:53:18,729 --> 01:53:20,829
Even if I hand over my leadership role,

2656
01:53:21,600 --> 01:53:23,329
I'll behave the same.

2657
01:53:23,699 --> 01:53:25,569
Because I have to be good to make the team survive.

2658
01:53:25,970 --> 01:53:29,069
I could only see how I perform.

2659
01:53:29,539 --> 01:53:30,539
So...

2660
01:53:32,409 --> 01:53:36,250
To JUNWON,

2661
01:53:37,819 --> 01:53:42,089
I feel sorry.

2662
01:53:42,090 --> 01:53:43,420
What are you sorry for?

2663
01:53:45,720 --> 01:53:47,630
What's wrong? No.

2664
01:53:49,729 --> 01:53:51,699
- It's okay. - It's okay.

2665
01:53:52,029 --> 01:53:54,300
- Don't cry. - Stop crying.

2666
01:53:54,569 --> 01:53:55,630
It's okay.

2667
01:53:55,899 --> 01:53:59,069
Honestly, a leader...

2668
01:53:59,770 --> 01:54:03,039
is a difficult role.

2669
01:54:05,210 --> 01:54:07,109
It's not only the leader,

2670
01:54:07,210 --> 01:54:10,180
but everyone who chose you to be the leader...

2671
01:54:12,079 --> 01:54:13,689
have...

2672
01:54:13,789 --> 01:54:17,590
the responsibility as soon as the decision was made.

2673
01:54:18,989 --> 01:54:22,158
I'm sorry for making you...

2674
01:54:22,159 --> 01:54:23,699
- feel embarrassed. - No way.

2675
01:54:24,630 --> 01:54:25,630
It's not like that.

2676
01:54:27,529 --> 01:54:31,340
I want to practice harder...

2677
01:54:31,539 --> 01:54:34,609
to avoid feeling sorry.

2678
01:54:34,810 --> 01:54:36,510
This is how I feel.

2679
01:54:37,279 --> 01:54:38,279
You're kind.

2680
01:54:42,609 --> 01:54:43,619
Well,

2681
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:45,880
a bit...

2682
01:54:47,550 --> 01:54:50,489
I feel uncertain.

2683
01:54:51,260 --> 01:54:54,329
We need to assess people based on...

2684
01:54:54,890 --> 01:54:56,659
their skills...

2685
01:54:56,760 --> 01:54:59,059
and the charm they possess.

2686
01:54:59,060 --> 01:55:03,329
It seems too much like...

2687
01:55:03,770 --> 01:55:07,039
a world of competition,

2688
01:55:07,270 --> 01:55:09,170
and it hurt my heart a bit.

2689
01:55:11,340 --> 01:55:14,249
People who want JUNWON as their leader,

2690
01:55:14,250 --> 01:55:15,250
raise your hands.

2691
01:55:15,680 --> 01:55:18,049
People who want NOYUL as their leader,

2692
01:55:18,050 --> 01:55:19,519
please raise your hands.

2693
01:55:19,520 --> 01:55:21,519
(What's the voting result for P3?)

2694
01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:24,390
Then, for P3,

2695
01:55:25,020 --> 01:55:27,559
we will change our leader.

2696
01:55:27,560 --> 01:55:29,789
- Yes. - Seeking for your cooperation.

2697
01:55:29,890 --> 01:55:30,929
Thank you.

2698
01:55:30,930 --> 01:55:32,729
(Changing leader: From AHN JUNWON to LEE NOYUL)

2699
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:35,129
My arm feels lighter.

2700
01:55:35,130 --> 01:55:36,130
(Joking)

2701
01:55:36,369 --> 01:55:37,369
My arm will feel heavier.

2702
01:55:38,170 --> 01:55:39,198
Please save our team.

2703
01:55:39,199 --> 01:55:41,409
Yes. I'll do my best. Thank you.

2704
01:55:44,779 --> 01:55:46,479
I felt pressured.

2705
01:55:47,149 --> 01:55:50,420
If there are members who can't keep up,

2706
01:55:50,850 --> 01:55:52,749
a leader should...

2707
01:55:52,750 --> 01:55:55,920
bring and help them along.

2708
01:55:56,590 --> 01:55:59,889
I started with this pressure...

2709
01:55:59,890 --> 01:56:00,890
as a leader.

2710
01:56:06,500 --> 01:56:09,829
(The video evaluation day is here.)

2711
01:56:15,739 --> 01:56:16,739
Hello.

2712
01:56:17,409 --> 01:56:20,750
I'm KIM SUNGMIN of P4, S rank.

2713
01:56:20,949 --> 01:56:24,079
I'm MAJINGXIANG, a trainee of A rank.

2714
01:56:24,250 --> 01:56:26,948
I'm SEO KYOUNGBAE, a trainee of A rank.

2715
01:56:26,949 --> 01:56:29,818
I'm trainee YOO HEEDO of P2, C rank.

2716
01:56:29,819 --> 01:56:32,520
I'm JEON MINWOOK of P1, A rank.

2717
01:56:32,720 --> 01:56:34,890
I'll start the video evaluation.

2718
01:56:45,869 --> 01:56:47,069
I hope

2719
01:56:47,710 --> 01:56:50,270
(Video evaluation starts.)

2720
01:56:52,409 --> 01:56:53,750
(However)

2721
01:56:54,149 --> 01:56:55,710
Up to you now

2722
01:56:56,050 --> 01:56:57,478
What is he doing?

2723
01:56:57,479 --> 01:56:58,550
I'm getting furious.

2724
01:56:58,649 --> 01:56:59,880
(How did he debut?)

2725
01:57:00,250 --> 01:57:01,448
It feels like a fallen king.

2726
01:57:01,449 --> 01:57:03,050
We formed Avengers for no reason.

2727
01:57:03,420 --> 01:57:05,289
(The result of my efforts ended up being a nuisance.)

2728
01:57:06,260 --> 01:57:08,489
(I’m frustrated that everything is ruined because of one leader.)

2729
01:57:09,390 --> 01:57:11,060
(Unstable teamwork)

2730
01:57:11,600 --> 01:57:13,199
(Honestly, I think it's right for me to be the leader.)

2731
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:15,869
(Do you consider me as a leader?)

2732
01:57:16,329 --> 01:57:18,199
(Escalating conflicts)

2733
01:57:18,869 --> 01:57:21,640
(Which team will win the final First Tier?)

2734
01:57:23,909 --> 01:57:26,278
(The grand Round 1)

2735
01:57:26,279 --> 01:57:27,949
(Position Matching)

2736
01:57:29,310 --> 01:57:30,979
(I think this is a battle of pride.)

2737
01:57:32,750 --> 01:57:34,890
(The number of trainees who will go to the next round is...)

2738
01:57:35,350 --> 01:57:36,350
(only 70 trainees.)

2739
01:57:36,351 --> 01:57:38,260
Surely, we can avoid elimination, right?

2740
01:57:38,359 --> 01:57:39,689
I felt overwhelmed.

2741
01:57:40,189 --> 01:57:43,229
(Each trainee chooses the position they prefer.)

2742
01:57:43,560 --> 01:57:45,729
(They need to make the best team.)

2743
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:48,669
(If one isn't needed, they can expel that person.)

2744
01:57:48,670 --> 01:57:49,970
Do you want to stay here?

2745
01:57:50,170 --> 01:57:52,600
(Who wants this person to be out?)

2746
01:57:52,899 --> 01:57:54,210
I'm losing my mind.

2747
01:57:54,409 --> 01:57:56,770
Position Matching of Project 7.

2748
01:57:57,710 --> 01:57:59,510
Let it begin now.

2749
01:58:03,779 --> 01:58:06,619
(Project 7)
