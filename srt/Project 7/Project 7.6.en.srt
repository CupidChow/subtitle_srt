PROJECT 7.

00:00:02,664 --> 00:00:05,003
(Only 70 trainees will survive...)

00:00:05,004 --> 00:00:07,535
(the 1st Passing Ceremony.)

5
00:00:08,035 --> 00:00:13,074
(The first assemblies by World Assemblers are revealed.)

6
00:00:13,474 --> 00:00:14,543
World Assemblers...

00:00:14,544 --> 00:00:16,744
(Team A1: A balanced assembly)

8
00:00:16,745 --> 00:00:19,244
(Five vocalists)

00:00:19,245 --> 00:00:20,245
(Two rappers)

10
00:00:20,246 --> 00:00:22,215
(Four dancers)

11
00:00:24,485 --> 00:00:31,425
(Team A2: An assembly of refreshing and popular trainees)

12
00:00:33,095 --> 00:00:34,623
(Team A3: An assembly of the top-ranking trainees)

13
00:00:34,624 --> 00:00:42,035
(Team A3 is a wannabe assembly by trainees.)

14
00:00:43,735 --> 00:00:51,044
(Team A4: A balanced assembly)

15
00:00:52,515 --> 00:00:58,223
(Team A5: An assembly of competent dancers)

16
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:02,895
(Team A5 is assembled of lower-ranking trainees.)

17
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:06,824
World Assemblers selected these assemblies.

18
00:01:06,825 --> 00:01:09,595
(All 5 assemblies are completed.)

19
00:01:09,864 --> 00:01:11,295
Trainees of PROJECT 7,

20
00:01:11,765 --> 00:01:14,204
greet World Assemblers!

21
00:01:14,205 --> 00:01:15,603
- We'll do our best! - We'll do our best!

22
00:01:15,604 --> 00:01:18,345
(What project is waiting for the five assemblies?)

23
00:01:19,175 --> 00:01:20,575
Assemble and upgrade.

24
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:24,273
Welcome to PROJECT 7, where a new world-class boy group will be born.

25
00:01:24,274 --> 00:01:26,544
(PROJECT 7, the second global voting)

26
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:28,984
You can participate in the voting on PROJECT 7's official platform...

27
00:01:28,985 --> 00:01:30,614
once a day.

28
00:01:31,254 --> 00:01:32,624

00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,583
Access to the PROJECT 7's community...

30
00:01:34,584 --> 00:01:36,154

31
00:01:36,155 --> 00:01:38,124
to participate in two votings.

32
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:42,193
(Chapter 2: Sign up for PROJECT 7's community and see the announcement.)

33
00:01:42,194 --> 00:01:43,864
The first one is personal voting.

34
00:01:44,535 --> 00:01:45,934
Among 70 trainees,

35
00:01:45,935 --> 00:01:48,234
select seven trainees you support.

36
00:01:48,235 --> 00:01:49,603
(Chapter 3: Vote for 7 trainees you support.)

37
00:01:49,604 --> 00:01:50,924
After completing personal voting,

38
00:01:50,974 --> 00:01:53,144
click on the "Next voting" button.

39
00:01:53,145 --> 00:01:54,551
(Chapter 3: The voting result will be reflected in the rankings.)

40
00:01:54,575 --> 00:01:57,045
The second one is new song matching assembly voting.

41
00:01:57,545 --> 00:01:59,644
Listen to all five new songs released...

42
00:01:59,645 --> 00:02:02,654
and assemble trainees that match the songs.

43
00:02:03,184 --> 00:02:04,754
Click the "Assemble" button,

44
00:02:04,755 --> 00:02:07,955

(The live voting result is revealed after the show ends.)

47
00:02:13,464 --> 00:02:16,334
(JTBC studio in Ilsan)

48
00:02:20,635 --> 00:02:22,575
(The day of announcing the fourth project)

49
00:02:23,804 --> 00:02:25,005
What's waiting for us?

50
00:02:26,175 --> 00:02:27,304
What's this?

51
00:02:27,545 --> 00:02:29,314
I've seen this platform before.

52
00:02:30,015 --> 00:02:32,145
Something feels familiar.

53
00:02:33,545 --> 00:02:35,314
What is it? Why?

54
00:02:36,584 --> 00:02:37,955
- What is this? - Hello.

55
00:02:38,385 --> 00:02:40,884
- Welcome. - Welcome.

56
00:02:40,885 --> 00:02:41,994
Come with me.

57
00:02:42,225 --> 00:02:43,654
HYEONSEOK.

58
00:02:44,124 --> 00:02:45,494
Good to see you.

59
00:02:46,665 --> 00:02:47,725
It's been a while.

60
00:02:48,094 --> 00:02:49,295
Who's that?

61
00:02:49,635 --> 00:02:50,665
Hello.

62
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,004
- What are we going to do? - What's this?

63
00:02:54,005 --> 00:02:55,304
What's that?

64
00:02:55,434 --> 00:02:56,475
What is this?

65
00:02:56,675 --> 00:02:57,774
It's a black and white.

66
00:02:57,934 --> 00:02:59,974
Black and white?

67
00:02:59,975 --> 00:03:01,404
Are we filming "Idol Class Wars?"

68
00:03:01,545 --> 00:03:02,645
"Idol Class Wars."

69
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:04,145
Is this a checkerboard?

70
00:03:04,945 --> 00:03:06,183
- The game of go. - We're playing a game of go.

71
00:03:06,184 --> 00:03:07,313
I have no idea what's going on.

72
00:03:07,314 --> 00:03:08,474
(Everyone is making guesses.)

73
00:03:14,325 --> 00:03:15,854
(One person appears in front of trainees.)

74
00:03:15,855 --> 00:03:17,493
It's Director Sung Woon.

75
00:03:17,494 --> 00:03:18,925
It's been a while since I saw him.

76
00:03:21,295 --> 00:03:22,963
Hello, everyone. It's nice to meet you.

77
00:03:22,964 --> 00:03:24,833
- Hello. - Hello.

78
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:26,665
- Hello. - Hello.

79
00:03:27,564 --> 00:03:31,033
Last week, we had the first Passing Ceremony.

80
00:03:31,034 --> 00:03:33,844
Seventy trainees who survived the Passing Ceremony,

81
00:03:34,175 --> 00:03:35,614
once again, congratulations.

82
00:03:39,184 --> 00:03:41,244
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

83
00:03:41,485 --> 00:03:42,684
Congratulations.

84
00:03:43,614 --> 00:03:47,583
From now on, trainees in both high ranks and low ranks...

85
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,355
can't let your guard down.

86
00:03:49,455 --> 00:03:51,355
Starting from this project,

87
00:03:51,654 --> 00:03:55,023
the voting scores you received...

88
00:03:55,024 --> 00:03:56,424
until the first Passing Ceremony...

89
00:03:56,994 --> 00:04:00,605
will be reset.

90
00:04:01,434 --> 00:04:04,974
Gosh, it makes me feel so nervous.

91
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:08,814
To keep the first place,

92
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:10,315
I need to do my best.

93
00:04:10,544 --> 00:04:13,645
I was glad to have another chance,

94
00:04:13,685 --> 00:04:15,354
and I decided to do my best.

95
00:04:15,615 --> 00:04:17,084
It's Zero Setting again.

96
00:04:17,685 --> 00:04:18,755
Okay.

97
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:22,353
A new project starts today.

98
00:04:22,354 --> 00:04:25,463
Depending on your performance here,

99
00:04:25,464 --> 00:04:29,034
the result of the next Passing Ceremony can change completely.

100
00:04:30,234 --> 00:04:31,394
That's what we should expect.

101
00:04:32,765 --> 00:04:33,804
I'm scared.

102
00:04:33,805 --> 00:04:35,834
We'll have another Passing Ceremony.

103
00:04:35,904 --> 00:04:39,474
How many trainees can survive in PROJECT 7 this time?

104
00:04:40,145 --> 00:04:44,114
The number of trainees to survive the second Passing Ceremony...

105
00:04:44,115 --> 00:04:46,815
(What's the number of survivors from the second Passing Ceremony?)

106
00:04:48,145 --> 00:04:49,654
I guess 42 or 35.

107
00:04:50,284 --> 00:04:51,844
That will be trainees in first place...

108
00:04:53,555 --> 00:04:54,955
to 35th place.

109
00:04:55,755 --> 00:04:56,995
Gosh.

110
00:04:58,195 --> 00:04:59,723
- It's a half. - A half will be eliminated.

111
00:04:59,724 --> 00:05:01,024
A half is going to go.

112
00:05:01,094 --> 00:05:02,435
It's a half again.

113
00:05:03,164 --> 00:05:04,365
Now...

114
00:05:04,765 --> 00:05:05,935
I'm in 36th place?

115
00:05:06,505 --> 00:05:07,564
You're in 36th place.

116
00:05:07,565 --> 00:05:11,233
The 4th project of PROJECT 7.

117
00:05:11,234 --> 00:05:12,554
(The fourth project is revealed.)

118
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:17,315
You'll be evaluated as teams World Assemblers assembled.

119
00:05:17,615 --> 00:05:19,344
The project this time...

120
00:05:25,185 --> 00:05:28,084
is Representative K-pop Song Cover Mission.

121
00:05:29,654 --> 00:05:31,294
This is going to be fun!

122
00:05:32,224 --> 00:05:33,265
What?

123
00:05:40,334 --> 00:05:41,533
What's that?

124
00:05:41,534 --> 00:05:42,833
(MONSTA X, NCT, Stray Kids, TOMORROW X TOGETHER, RIIZE)

125
00:05:42,834 --> 00:05:46,504
In this project, you'll be evaluated by performing songs...

126
00:05:46,505 --> 00:05:47,945
by representative K-pop boy bands.

127
00:05:51,075 --> 00:05:52,214
Stray Kids!

128
00:05:52,815 --> 00:05:55,084
I like NCT!

129
00:05:55,584 --> 00:05:58,514
At last, the moment I can do what I want to do has come.

130
00:05:58,515 --> 00:05:59,984
I thought it was going to be so fun.

131
00:06:00,325 --> 00:06:02,255
I'm looking forward to it.

132
00:06:03,294 --> 00:06:04,755
I want to do it so much.

133
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:09,934
You need to show both singing and dancing...

134
00:06:09,935 --> 00:06:11,865
in a live performance.

135
00:06:12,265 --> 00:06:15,034
I'm most worried about giving a live performance.

136
00:06:15,205 --> 00:06:16,704
We can't miss YOUNGSEO when it comes to live performance.

137
00:06:16,705 --> 00:06:17,705
Of course.

138
00:06:17,706 --> 00:06:19,544
- I'm confident. - Let's go!

139
00:06:19,844 --> 00:06:23,074
The representative K-pop groups whose songs you'll perform...

140
00:06:23,075 --> 00:06:24,914
are five teams in total.

141
00:06:25,784 --> 00:06:26,885
First,

142
00:06:27,445 --> 00:06:30,713
a group that shows sexy and intense performances, MONSTA X.

143
00:06:30,714 --> 00:06:32,584
(MONSTA X)

144
00:06:32,724 --> 00:06:33,724
Am I sexy?

145
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,495
- What? - Do I look sexy?

146
00:06:35,794 --> 00:06:37,495
- You shouldn't try this. - All right.

147
00:06:37,695 --> 00:06:41,464
An infinitely expanding group with a unique colour,

148
00:06:41,565 --> 00:06:42,635
NCT.

149
00:06:44,065 --> 00:06:46,505
- NCT, you're so sexy. - I want to try this.

150
00:06:46,565 --> 00:06:48,533
Going beyond Korea, they advanced to Billboard.

151
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:50,904
The self-producing idol band, Stray Kids.

152
00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:53,805
Stray kids.

153
00:06:54,044 --> 00:06:56,875
I suppose many people want to perform Stray Kids.

154
00:06:56,974 --> 00:07:00,884
An acknowledged fourth-generation band, TOMORROW X TOGETHER.

155
00:07:00,885 --> 00:07:04,055
(TOMORROW X TOGETHER)

156
00:07:04,455 --> 00:07:05,584
I want that.

157
00:07:06,255 --> 00:07:09,293
The band that sold a million albums in a week from their debut,

158
00:07:09,294 --> 00:07:10,325
RIIZE.

159
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:13,325
That's true. His introduction sounds so awesome.

160
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,834
- I love you. - You're so happy.

161
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:19,264
Each team can choose only one group...

162
00:07:19,265 --> 00:07:22,233
you want to cover among the five groups...

163
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:23,674
you see in the front.

164
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:26,043
Before selection, I will give you time...

165
00:07:26,044 --> 00:07:28,674
to discuss with the team members.

166
00:07:29,474 --> 00:07:31,344
Let's gather.

167
00:07:31,414 --> 00:07:32,514
Gather in a circle.

168
00:07:32,515 --> 00:07:34,843
If we choose one among NCT, Stray Kids, and RIIZE,

169
00:07:34,844 --> 00:07:36,284
it doesn't matter to me.

170
00:07:36,315 --> 00:07:39,224
To be honest, I want to perform RIIZE's song the most.

171
00:07:39,255 --> 00:07:42,755
I love RIIZE's songs very much too.

172
00:07:42,825 --> 00:07:44,625
I want to perform NCT's song.

173
00:07:46,094 --> 00:07:48,364
Our members are just like TOMORROW X TOGETHER.

174
00:07:48,365 --> 00:07:49,994
(A refreshing look)

175
00:07:49,995 --> 00:07:51,463
NCT or TOMORROW X TOGETHER?

176
00:07:51,464 --> 00:07:53,305
We should choose NCT or TOMORROW X TOGETHER.

177
00:07:53,705 --> 00:07:55,505
We can never perform MONSTA X.

178
00:07:57,274 --> 00:07:59,794
- How can we perform MONSTA X? - We can show a different charm.

179
00:08:00,145 --> 00:08:02,273
Shall we decide by majority? Those who want NCT, raise your hand.

180
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:05,043
Seven.

181
00:08:05,044 --> 00:08:06,144
It's seven of us.

182
00:08:06,145 --> 00:08:07,245
Stray Kids.

183
00:08:08,484 --> 00:08:09,854
- 1, 2, 3, 4. - Four people?

184
00:08:09,885 --> 00:08:11,014
- It's six. - Six.

185
00:08:11,015 --> 00:08:12,601
Those who want to perform RIIZE's song, raise your hand.

186
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:13,983
(1 person for RIIZE)

187
00:08:13,984 --> 00:08:16,494
It's either NCT or Stray Kids.

188
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:18,223
We only need to avoid MONSTA X.

189
00:08:18,224 --> 00:08:19,864
But if...

190
00:08:19,865 --> 00:08:21,064
Which group would we match?

191
00:08:22,095 --> 00:08:25,095
Doesn't our combination suit MONSTA X the most?

192
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:27,034
Somehow,

193
00:08:27,434 --> 00:08:29,034
when we see the overall vibe.

194
00:08:29,804 --> 00:08:31,974
But actually, for a competition,

195
00:08:31,975 --> 00:08:34,504
we need to consider the song's popularity.

196
00:08:34,505 --> 00:08:36,191
- Do you mean the recent popularity? - Right.

197
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:37,974
- Then Stray Kids... - Hey.

198
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,645
What's Stray Kids' latest song?

199
00:08:40,684 --> 00:08:42,384
"Chk Chk Boom" or "LALALALA."

200
00:08:42,385 --> 00:08:43,585
"Chk Chk Boom."

201
00:08:43,654 --> 00:08:45,523
- We have 2 options. - Number 1, RIIZE.

202
00:08:45,524 --> 00:08:47,054
Number two, NCT.

203
00:08:47,085 --> 00:08:50,024
Considering our team's vibe, RIIZE is a better match.

204
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,624
What we need to think about...

205
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:54,423
is that NCT has so many units such as NCT U, NCT 127,

206
00:08:54,424 --> 00:08:56,433
- and NCT DREAM. - There are so many units.

207
00:08:56,434 --> 00:08:58,063
We never know which song it will be.

208
00:08:58,064 --> 00:09:00,164
- They have various concepts. - It's too risky.

209
00:09:00,404 --> 00:09:02,524
Then who wants to perform TOMORROW X TOGETHER's song?

210
00:09:03,304 --> 00:09:07,875
We have seven.

211
00:09:08,914 --> 00:09:10,274
Then it's over.

212
00:09:11,245 --> 00:09:14,314
(Heated discussions end.)

213
00:09:14,544 --> 00:09:16,454
But how do we decide?

214
00:09:17,784 --> 00:09:19,725
How you decide the group...

215
00:09:19,824 --> 00:09:22,424
will be done by the assembly race.

216
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,354
- A race? - Gosh.

217
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:25,523
The assembly race.

218
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:28,194
It's a race done by assembling members.

219
00:09:28,465 --> 00:09:29,694
The assembly race.

220
00:09:29,934 --> 00:09:31,434
By the assembly race?

221
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:37,605
For the assembly race, three people from each team...

222
00:09:37,835 --> 00:09:39,844
will have their ankles tied together.

223
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:42,515
They will run to the flag ahead.

224
00:09:42,574 --> 00:09:45,114
Pull out the flag with the name of the group you want,

225
00:09:45,115 --> 00:09:47,043
come back to the startling line,

226
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,985
and plant the flag.

227
00:09:50,615 --> 00:09:52,485
Each team...

228
00:09:52,585 --> 00:09:55,654
will send out three players, please.

229
00:09:56,024 --> 00:09:58,224
- Please come forward. - I was in an athletic club.

230
00:09:58,225 --> 00:09:59,424
Really?

231
00:09:59,564 --> 00:10:01,694
I was a cheerleader in my high school.

232
00:10:01,765 --> 00:10:03,464
Then you can cheer for the players.

233
00:10:03,465 --> 00:10:04,495
Let's do it hard.

234
00:10:04,534 --> 00:10:06,303
- First, MAJINGXIANG... - MAJINGXIANG.

235
00:10:06,304 --> 00:10:07,803
Someone that's similar in height with MAJINGXIANG should do it.

236
00:10:07,804 --> 00:10:09,903
I think SEUNGCHAN and JEONGMIN...

237
00:10:09,904 --> 00:10:11,604
- will play it well. - So, two of them?

238
00:10:11,605 --> 00:10:12,804
- Okay. - Okay.

239
00:10:13,044 --> 00:10:15,975
But there's little chance we can get RIIZE from here.

240
00:10:16,475 --> 00:10:19,043
(The RIIZE flag is across from A4.)

241
00:10:19,044 --> 00:10:21,214
- No, let's try. - We need to go for NCT or MONSTA X.

242
00:10:21,215 --> 00:10:23,414
- Let's try NCT. - Try NCT first.

243
00:10:24,154 --> 00:10:26,283
If you all have decided,

244
00:10:26,284 --> 00:10:27,724
tie your ankles.

245
00:10:27,725 --> 00:10:29,294
- We can do it! - We can do it!

246
00:10:30,154 --> 00:10:31,355
I feel nervous!

247
00:10:32,495 --> 00:10:33,894
Let's run to the beat.

248
00:10:33,895 --> 00:10:35,564
- Why? - Okay.

249
00:10:36,194 --> 00:10:37,895
SEUNGHO can lead us.

250
00:10:38,434 --> 00:10:39,605
Which will be better?

251
00:10:39,934 --> 00:10:41,504
You can go straight.

252
00:10:41,505 --> 00:10:43,335
Please block the way.

253
00:10:43,404 --> 00:10:45,904
- Right, left. - Right, left.

254
00:10:46,574 --> 00:10:47,875
Trainee OH SEUNGCHAN.

255
00:10:48,505 --> 00:10:49,714
Trainee OH SEUNGCHAN.

256
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:50,774
- Yes. - Okay.

257
00:10:54,684 --> 00:10:55,885
What is it?

258
00:10:57,154 --> 00:10:58,924
What's that?

259
00:11:00,755 --> 00:11:01,953
Goodness.

260
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:04,794
(Doing a push-up)

261
00:11:05,495 --> 00:11:07,625
(Okay. That looked natural.)

262
00:11:08,024 --> 00:11:09,494
- Trainee AHN JUNWON. - Yes.

263
00:11:09,495 --> 00:11:11,533
Are you a good runner?

264
00:11:11,534 --> 00:11:15,674
I'm called Son Heung Min of Suncheon.

265
00:11:17,074 --> 00:11:18,474
- Nice! - Let's go!

266
00:11:18,475 --> 00:11:19,975
- Let's go! - Yes!

267
00:11:21,074 --> 00:11:22,105
Please.

268
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:25,885
Now, we'll begin...

269
00:11:26,814 --> 00:11:27,884
the race to decide your groups.

270
00:11:27,885 --> 00:11:30,153
- You can do it! - You can do it!

271
00:11:30,154 --> 00:11:33,085
They're already running.

272
00:11:33,454 --> 00:11:34,854
- You can do it! - You can do it!

273
00:11:34,855 --> 00:11:38,194
You can go when I blow the whistle.

274
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:40,124
Are you ready?

275
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:41,324
- Yes! - Yes!

276
00:11:41,564 --> 00:11:42,735
- Let's go! - Okay!

277
00:11:42,794 --> 00:11:44,934
Right foot.

278
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:46,005
Ready,

279
00:11:46,304 --> 00:11:47,304
Right foot.

280
00:11:47,965 --> 00:11:49,034
Set...

281
00:11:50,034 --> 00:11:51,204
is...

282
00:11:52,105 --> 00:11:53,443
- Right, left. - set is...

283
00:11:53,444 --> 00:11:54,944
(Stumbling)

284
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,245
It's not started yet. It starts when I blow the whistle.

285
00:11:57,574 --> 00:11:58,615
Ready,

286
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:01,414
set...

287
00:12:06,784 --> 00:12:08,653
(The assembly run begins.)

288
00:12:08,654 --> 00:12:10,523
Right foot.

289
00:12:10,524 --> 00:12:13,225
(A1 runs fast.)

290
00:12:13,395 --> 00:12:15,423
- Right. - Right, left.

291
00:12:15,424 --> 00:12:17,235
(A3 and A4 catch up fast.)

292
00:12:17,395 --> 00:12:19,964
- Right, left. - No! What's that?

293
00:12:19,965 --> 00:12:22,975
- Right, left. - No! What's that?

294
00:12:23,335 --> 00:12:24,573
Right foot.

295
00:12:24,574 --> 00:12:26,573
(A1 takes the RIIZE flag.)

296
00:12:26,574 --> 00:12:27,845
We're almost there.

297
00:12:31,774 --> 00:12:34,014
- Right, left. - Right, left.

298
00:12:34,015 --> 00:12:35,784
- One, two. - Right foot.

299
00:12:36,085 --> 00:12:37,085
Right, left.

300
00:12:37,086 --> 00:12:38,814
(A3 takes the Stray Kids flag.)

301
00:12:39,154 --> 00:12:40,184
- Come on. - Gosh.

302
00:12:40,324 --> 00:12:42,395
(A4 takes the NCT flag.)

303
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:45,424
(A3 and A4 are in a festive mood.)

304
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:48,064
(How about A2?)

305
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,235
(Shocked)

306
00:12:51,265 --> 00:12:52,335
What are you doing?

307
00:12:52,865 --> 00:12:55,235
- Don't bring the MONSTA X flag! - What are you doing?

308
00:12:57,304 --> 00:12:58,334
No!

309
00:12:58,335 --> 00:13:00,144
- Right, left. - What's that?

310
00:13:00,145 --> 00:13:02,444
(A4 takes the NCT flag before A1 gets to it.)

311
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:05,783
(Meanwhile, A5 takes the TOMORROW X TOGETHER.)

312
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:07,543
Quickly.

313
00:13:07,544 --> 00:13:09,684
- No. - What are you doing?

314
00:13:09,784 --> 00:13:10,784
It's MONSTA X.

315
00:13:11,255 --> 00:13:13,954
- What are you doing? - Right, left.

316
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:18,854
No!

317
00:13:18,855 --> 00:13:22,395
(A2 will perform the song of the group they wanted to avoid.)

318
00:13:24,135 --> 00:13:25,904
(What's the result of the group selection?)

319
00:13:26,735 --> 00:13:28,334
Well, so this decides...

320
00:13:28,335 --> 00:13:31,404
the five group selections.

321
00:13:32,304 --> 00:13:34,044
(A5, TOMORROW X TOGETHER)

322
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:37,674
Good job.

323
00:13:39,414 --> 00:13:43,355
We got to pick RIIZE.

324
00:13:43,414 --> 00:13:46,554
I thought I could survive this time, if I do a good job.

325
00:13:47,485 --> 00:13:51,395
I thought it was time to show myself as an idol.

326
00:13:52,725 --> 00:13:55,965
Since such competent members are in my team,

327
00:13:56,064 --> 00:13:57,635
I don't think we'll lose.

328
00:13:58,895 --> 00:14:01,004
I think what matters is to give a nice performance.

329
00:14:01,005 --> 00:14:03,804
I want to be in first place with my team members.

330
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:07,874
I performed songs of TOMORROW X TOGETHER...

331
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,943
many times in auditions.

332
00:14:09,944 --> 00:14:12,844
So I thought, "This mission..."

333
00:14:12,845 --> 00:14:14,245
"is the one for me."

334
00:14:15,044 --> 00:14:17,314
The group selection is completed.

335
00:14:17,585 --> 00:14:19,923
Since these groups have so many hit songs,

336
00:14:19,924 --> 00:14:22,524
there must be high expectations...

337
00:14:22,694 --> 00:14:24,824
about which songs will be performed.

338
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:28,924
Which songs will you challenge?

339
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:33,365
Now,

340
00:14:35,005 --> 00:14:36,174
the songs are revealed.

341
00:14:39,174 --> 00:14:40,774
I feel so nervous.

342
00:14:41,845 --> 00:14:43,214
No way it's "Siren."

343
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,044
- I don't think so. - It can't happen.

344
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:47,344
- I'm scared. - Which song do you want?

345
00:14:47,645 --> 00:14:49,615
You know...

346
00:14:49,814 --> 00:14:51,755
Please give us "Love Killa."

347
00:14:51,784 --> 00:14:54,225
Love killa

348
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:58,625
A2!

349
00:14:58,626 --> 00:15:00,194
- Yes! - Yes.

350
00:15:00,694 --> 00:15:02,324
Which song do you want?

351
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:04,865
- "Love Killa." - "Love Killa."

352
00:15:05,194 --> 00:15:06,634
- "Love Killa?" - Yes.

353
00:15:06,635 --> 00:15:07,765
"GAMBLER!"

354
00:15:07,835 --> 00:15:09,534
- "GAMBLER." - "GAMBLER."

355
00:15:11,574 --> 00:15:13,444
- I will reveal it. - Okay!

356
00:15:14,074 --> 00:15:16,515
Okay, go!

357
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,475
Please.

358
00:15:20,184 --> 00:15:21,784
What is it? Two songs?

359
00:15:24,154 --> 00:15:26,424
(Not 1, but 2 songs are revealed!)

360
00:15:26,524 --> 00:15:28,885
- There are two songs! - Really?

361
00:15:28,985 --> 00:15:30,595
There are two of them!

362
00:15:32,225 --> 00:15:34,564
The moment I saw that, I thought, "Why two songs?"

363
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,265
Do we need to choose 1 of the 2 songs?

364
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:41,864
If there are 2 songs, can we choose 1 song to perform?

365
00:15:41,865 --> 00:15:44,804
I first thought that it would be fun.

366
00:15:45,034 --> 00:15:47,505
(A2's mission songs are "Jealousy" and "GAMBLER.")

367
00:15:49,314 --> 00:15:51,145
"GAMBLER!"

368
00:15:51,274 --> 00:15:52,845
Do I suit "GAMBLER?"

369
00:15:53,015 --> 00:15:55,544
I think the song "GAMBLER" will suit you nicely.

370
00:15:55,645 --> 00:15:56,784
"GAMBLER."

371
00:15:57,715 --> 00:15:59,224
("GAMBLER" by MONSTA X)

372
00:15:59,225 --> 00:16:01,084
(The song compares the seducing moment to a thrilling game.)

373
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,601
(Heavy base rhythm and electronic guitar sound are impressive.)

374
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,323
("Jealousy" by MONSTA X)

375
00:16:05,324 --> 00:16:07,423
(The song powerfully expresses...)

376
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,595
(a man's jealousy regarding someone he loves.)

377
00:16:10,064 --> 00:16:11,794
I will reveal the next song.

378
00:16:12,135 --> 00:16:13,164
Great.

379
00:16:14,564 --> 00:16:15,835
Please.

380
00:16:16,735 --> 00:16:17,875
Please.

381
00:16:19,274 --> 00:16:20,605
Which song do you want?

382
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,574
- "Walk." - "Baggy Jeans."

383
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:24,744
(What's the mission song for A4?)

384
00:16:24,745 --> 00:16:26,115
"Baggy Jeans."

385
00:16:26,615 --> 00:16:27,715
"Walk."

386
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:31,284
I will reveal the songs.

387
00:16:37,954 --> 00:16:39,865
I really love "Make A Wish."

388
00:16:40,294 --> 00:16:44,765
"Make A Wish!"

389
00:16:45,335 --> 00:16:47,505
"Make A Wish!" We can do it!

390
00:16:48,735 --> 00:16:50,803
("Make A Wish" by NCT U)

391
00:16:50,804 --> 00:16:53,074
(The song entered the top 10 of the Billboard 200 Chart.)

392
00:16:53,075 --> 00:16:55,595
(It's a pop dance song with a whistling riff and hip-hop beat.)

393
00:16:56,174 --> 00:16:58,314
("TOUCH" by NCT 127)

394
00:16:58,315 --> 00:17:00,413
(The song expresses the fluttering feeling when a love grows.)

395
00:17:00,414 --> 00:17:02,934
(It's an urban rhythm and blues with an addictive synth sound.)

396
00:17:03,085 --> 00:17:05,584
- Trainee JEON MINWOOK. - Yes.

397
00:17:05,585 --> 00:17:06,954
Which song do you want?

398
00:17:07,585 --> 00:17:08,754
Well,

399
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:10,954
I want to perform "S-Class."

400
00:17:11,994 --> 00:17:13,424
"S-Class?"

401
00:17:14,724 --> 00:17:15,795
All right.

402
00:17:16,295 --> 00:17:18,694
"Back Door" and "CASE 143..."

403
00:17:19,135 --> 00:17:21,305
were the two songs I really wanted to perform.

404
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:25,473
What's that?

405
00:17:25,474 --> 00:17:27,144
It's in brackets.

406
00:17:27,145 --> 00:17:29,614
("LALALALA," "CASE 143")
[Download Available on www.kisskh.la or www.kisskh.co]

407
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:30,775
When he showed the titles,

408
00:17:31,145 --> 00:17:33,743
it said "LALALALA" and "CASE 143."

409
00:17:33,744 --> 00:17:36,754
So I thought, "This is it."

410
00:17:38,385 --> 00:17:39,754
We need to perform "CASE 143."

411
00:17:41,184 --> 00:17:42,285
Do you agree?

412
00:17:42,855 --> 00:17:44,624
("CASE 143" by Stray Kids compares the first feeling of love...)

413
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:47,025
(to when an incident happens by combining "case" and "143".)

414
00:17:47,494 --> 00:17:49,763
("LALALALA" is the title song of the Billboard 4 weeks top album.)

415
00:17:49,764 --> 00:17:52,324
(It delivers the message that "our joy is on in any situation.")

416
00:17:52,904 --> 00:17:54,964
Which songs by TOMORROW X TOGETHER do we have?

417
00:17:55,065 --> 00:17:56,674
I will reveal them now.

418
00:17:57,305 --> 00:17:58,705
- I will reveal them now. - Please.

419
00:17:59,444 --> 00:18:01,180
I guess "I'll See You There Tomorrow" is there.

420
00:18:01,204 --> 00:18:03,284
I will wait for you at the 9 and 3-quarter platform.

421
00:18:03,645 --> 00:18:05,075
Gosh.

422
00:18:05,744 --> 00:18:07,384
(TOMORROW X TOGETHER)

423
00:18:07,385 --> 00:18:08,413
("I'll See You There Tomorrow," "Deja Vu")

424
00:18:08,414 --> 00:18:09,554
"I'll See You There Tomorrow."

425
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:11,031
I told you "I'll See You There Tomorrow" will be there.

426
00:18:11,055 --> 00:18:12,255
"I'll See You There Tomorrow."

427
00:18:12,285 --> 00:18:14,825
I told you "I'll See You There Tomorrow" will be there.

428
00:18:15,085 --> 00:18:16,154
It's "Deja Vu!"

429
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:17,595
It's "Deja Vu!"

430
00:18:17,754 --> 00:18:20,194
They're just the right two songs.

431
00:18:21,795 --> 00:18:24,163
("Deja Vu" presents a message that "You and I are meant to be.")

432
00:18:24,164 --> 00:18:26,844
(The song expresses a sophisticated melody and a mournful feeling.)

433
00:18:27,404 --> 00:18:30,304
("I'll See You There Tomorrow" shows the wish to keep the promise...)

434
00:18:30,305 --> 00:18:33,145
(with a sentimental feeling and a refreshing melody.)

435
00:18:34,474 --> 00:18:37,075
I will reveal RIIZE's songs.

436
00:18:37,514 --> 00:18:38,974
- RIIZE! - RIIZE!

437
00:18:39,145 --> 00:18:40,615
RIIZE!

438
00:18:41,085 --> 00:18:44,184
(Which songs of RIIZE are there?)

439
00:18:44,385 --> 00:18:45,484
What is it?

440
00:18:49,055 --> 00:18:50,125
They're refreshing songs.

441
00:18:50,855 --> 00:18:53,395
They're both nice songs.

442
00:18:53,494 --> 00:18:55,494
- They match us. - "Memories" is a tough song.

443
00:18:55,895 --> 00:18:57,541
But the songs are too difficult to perform.

444
00:18:57,565 --> 00:18:58,795
The choice can be a variable.

445
00:18:59,434 --> 00:19:03,204
I didn't select RIIZE having those two songs in mind.

446
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:05,804
I tried to figure out which of the two songs...

447
00:19:05,805 --> 00:19:07,744
would suit me quickly.

448
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,114
("Memories" expresses the memories and inspirations given and taken.)

449
00:19:12,115 --> 00:19:14,475
(The synth and guitar sounds present a refreshing feeling.)

450
00:19:15,244 --> 00:19:17,054
("Boom Boom Bass" highlights a funky disco beat and the bass.)

451
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:19,455
(It's a pop dance song with controlled sexy attractiveness.)

452
00:19:20,184 --> 00:19:23,154
Each group has two songs.

453
00:19:23,654 --> 00:19:26,924
Are you supposed to choose...

454
00:19:27,964 --> 00:19:29,395
one of the two songs?

455
00:19:30,734 --> 00:19:32,164
(That's possible.)

456
00:19:32,264 --> 00:19:35,564
There's a reason we're showing...

457
00:19:35,565 --> 00:19:38,335
two songs, not one song here.

458
00:19:39,075 --> 00:19:40,805
I guess we need to mix those songs.

459
00:19:42,744 --> 00:19:43,744
Now...

460
00:19:44,045 --> 00:19:45,244
What's the reason?

461
00:19:45,645 --> 00:19:48,144
I thought things didn't go smoothly...

462
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,585
as I expected.

463
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,385
Now, I'll tell you the reason.

464
00:19:53,924 --> 00:19:55,025
Please tell us.

465
00:19:58,555 --> 00:19:59,693
- What? - What's that?

466
00:19:59,694 --> 00:20:00,894
(The show will resume shortly.)

467
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,400
- There's something else. - Something's written there.

468
00:20:02,424 --> 00:20:04,134
It's Rival Matching.

469
00:20:04,135 --> 00:20:05,934
(Rival Matching)

470
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:07,804
It's Rival Matching.

471
00:20:07,805 --> 00:20:09,704
(Rival Matching)

472
00:20:09,974 --> 00:20:11,105
Rival Matching?

473
00:20:15,845 --> 00:20:19,744
The 14 assembled trainees won't perform on the same stage.

474
00:20:20,414 --> 00:20:24,284
They will be divided by seven people and have a match.

475
00:20:24,285 --> 00:20:25,315
Oh, my goodness.

476
00:20:26,954 --> 00:20:28,555
I think I was too settled.

477
00:20:29,224 --> 00:20:30,724
I set the fox to keep the geese.

478
00:20:32,095 --> 00:20:33,365
I felt so sorry.

479
00:20:34,164 --> 00:20:36,095
I felt sorry about our team being divided.

480
00:20:37,835 --> 00:20:41,635
The trainee in the highest rank in a team...

481
00:20:42,264 --> 00:20:44,635
gets to make every choice.

482
00:20:45,934 --> 00:20:47,574
- YONGHYUN! - YONGHYUN.

483
00:20:47,575 --> 00:20:48,904
You're going to assemble us.

484
00:20:49,244 --> 00:20:50,444
Hello, Mr. JEON.

485
00:20:52,444 --> 00:20:55,085
The trainee in the highest rank in a team...

486
00:20:55,414 --> 00:20:56,884
can choose the song...

487
00:20:56,885 --> 00:20:59,253
- and the trainees... - Not us.

488
00:20:59,254 --> 00:21:01,385
He wants to perform together.

489
00:21:01,654 --> 00:21:03,193
- We can choose the song too. - Even the song?

490
00:21:03,194 --> 00:21:05,354
MINWOOK, please remember that I was your roommate.

491
00:21:05,355 --> 00:21:06,525
Hello, Mr. JEON.

492
00:21:06,825 --> 00:21:09,834
(Trainee OK CHANGHYEON is in the highest rank in A5.)

493
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:10,934
Is this how it goes?

494
00:21:11,494 --> 00:21:13,104
Wait a minute.

495
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,463
(Trainee YICHEN is in the highest rank in A4.)

496
00:21:14,464 --> 00:21:15,664
Suddenly.

497
00:21:16,035 --> 00:21:18,774
The seven trainees that are not chosen...

498
00:21:18,775 --> 00:21:21,444
becomes the opposing team to have a match.

499
00:21:22,045 --> 00:21:23,165
It's a friendly competition.

500
00:21:24,545 --> 00:21:26,114
What if YONGHYUN says it's a friendly competition...

501
00:21:26,115 --> 00:21:27,595
and takes all the vocalists with him?

502
00:21:28,444 --> 00:21:30,684
The the trainees in the highest rank...

503
00:21:31,555 --> 00:21:34,224
and the selected trainees...

504
00:21:35,055 --> 00:21:36,154
make Team White.

505
00:21:38,055 --> 00:21:40,664
The trainees not selected...

506
00:21:41,295 --> 00:21:42,595
make Team Black.

507
00:21:44,494 --> 00:21:45,535
It's heartbreaking.

508
00:21:45,865 --> 00:21:48,634
We'll start with A1.

509
00:21:48,635 --> 00:21:50,435
(KWON YONGHYUN of A1 assembles the trainees.)

510
00:21:50,535 --> 00:21:51,535
You can do it.

511
00:21:51,536 --> 00:21:53,674
(Who will Trainee KWON YONGHYUN choose?)

512
00:21:55,805 --> 00:21:57,145
Why am I nervous?

513
00:21:57,474 --> 00:21:59,815
- I feel nervous. - It's nerve-racking.

514
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:04,885
Trainee KWON YONGHYUN, select the song you want first.

515
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:07,785
I...

516
00:22:08,825 --> 00:22:10,024
will select "Boom Boom Bass."

517
00:22:10,025 --> 00:22:12,754
(He selects "Boom Boom Bass" by RIIZE.)

518
00:22:13,494 --> 00:22:14,494
Please.

519
00:22:17,895 --> 00:22:19,664
I was sure about one thing I wanted.

520
00:22:20,065 --> 00:22:21,545
I wanted to perform "Boom Boom Bass."

521
00:22:22,105 --> 00:22:25,173
Next, select six team members to perform with you...

522
00:22:25,174 --> 00:22:27,605
as one team of Team White.

523
00:22:27,674 --> 00:22:28,704
All right.

524
00:22:29,305 --> 00:22:31,644
If we're going to perform "Boom Boom Bass,"

525
00:22:31,645 --> 00:22:34,184
I hope YONGHYUN picks me.

526
00:22:36,115 --> 00:22:37,115
I...

527
00:22:37,885 --> 00:22:39,585
Please pick me.

528
00:22:43,754 --> 00:22:45,924
I will select Trainee YU JIAHN.

529
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:50,065
I will select Trainee YU JIAHN.

530
00:22:51,664 --> 00:22:52,764
You're sexy.

531
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:54,264
He suits the song well.

532
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,204
I envy him. He'll perform "Boom Boom Bass."

533
00:22:56,305 --> 00:22:59,645
(Trainee YU JIAHN is assembled to Team White of A1.)

534
00:23:00,704 --> 00:23:01,704
Thank you.

535
00:23:02,645 --> 00:23:05,815
Next, I'll select Trainee ASAKA KOTARO.

536
00:23:06,914 --> 00:23:09,785
(Trainee ASAKA KOTARO is assembled to Team White of A1.)

537
00:23:10,654 --> 00:23:12,054
I look forward to your cooperation.

538
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,585
He suits the song so well.

539
00:23:16,154 --> 00:23:18,494
I will select Trainee KIM YOUNGHOON.

540
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:21,794
(Trainee KIM YOUNGHOON is assembled to Team White of A1.)

541
00:23:21,795 --> 00:23:22,865
He's a stable vocalist.

542
00:23:24,164 --> 00:23:25,644
YOUNGHOON can guarantee his survival.

543
00:23:26,734 --> 00:23:28,904
I will select Trainee SONG HYUNGSEOK.

544
00:23:31,204 --> 00:23:33,605
(Trainee SONG HYUNGSEOK is assembled to Team White of A1.)

545
00:23:36,174 --> 00:23:38,214
- How many spots are left? Two? - Two spots.

546
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:41,585
I will select Trainee CHAE HEEJU.

547
00:23:45,014 --> 00:23:47,174
(Trainee CHAE HEEJU is assembled to Team White of A1.)

548
00:23:49,355 --> 00:23:50,954
I feel more nervous watching this.

549
00:23:51,855 --> 00:23:52,964
Lastly...

550
00:23:53,764 --> 00:23:57,095
- It's all right. - Please.

551
00:24:00,035 --> 00:24:01,764
I will select Trainee PARK JUNWOO.

552
00:24:02,105 --> 00:24:03,634
I will select Trainee PARK JUNWOO.

553
00:24:03,635 --> 00:24:05,204
JUNWOO!

554
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:09,375
(Trainee PARK JUNWOO is assembled to Team White of A1.)

555
00:24:14,285 --> 00:24:16,713
Trainee KWON YONGHYUN of A1...

556
00:24:16,714 --> 00:24:19,514
has completed assembling the team members of Team White.

557
00:24:22,254 --> 00:24:23,525
I thought he'd pick me.

558
00:24:24,355 --> 00:24:26,565
But he didn't pick me until the end, so...

559
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:29,025
I felt a bit angry.

560
00:24:29,395 --> 00:24:31,233
Since he didn't pick us,

561
00:24:31,234 --> 00:24:34,134
he should be waiting to see what performance we give...

562
00:24:34,135 --> 00:24:35,135
in this combination.

563
00:24:35,734 --> 00:24:37,604
Have you watched "Culinary Class Wars?"

564
00:24:37,605 --> 00:24:39,944
- Yes! - Which spoon won first place?

565
00:24:40,244 --> 00:24:41,575
- Black Spoon. - Black Spoon.

566
00:24:42,174 --> 00:24:43,615
(That's it.)

567
00:24:46,385 --> 00:24:48,413
We're not cooking here!

568
00:24:48,414 --> 00:24:49,885
(We're not cooking here!)

569
00:24:51,454 --> 00:24:52,654
I'm scared.

570
00:24:53,355 --> 00:24:55,424
Even if I show only a quarter of my competence,

571
00:24:55,454 --> 00:24:57,595
I can win Team White, I think.

572
00:24:58,994 --> 00:25:01,424
The memory of this rival mission...

573
00:25:01,825 --> 00:25:05,234
will haunt them. I guarantee that.

574
00:25:08,404 --> 00:25:10,334
("Memories" by Team Black)

575
00:25:10,335 --> 00:25:12,275
("Boom Boom Bass" by Team White)

576
00:25:12,535 --> 00:25:13,944
Next, A2.

577
00:25:15,244 --> 00:25:17,375
The group A2 chose...

578
00:25:18,115 --> 00:25:20,244
is MONSTA X.

579
00:25:23,414 --> 00:25:25,115
KENSHIN.

580
00:25:25,714 --> 00:25:26,885
Let's go, KENSHIN.

581
00:25:27,585 --> 00:25:29,795
- It suits you, KENSHIN. - Let's go, KENSHIN.

582
00:25:30,924 --> 00:25:31,993
Oh, gosh.

583
00:25:31,994 --> 00:25:35,525
Because I can't speak Korean,

584
00:25:35,565 --> 00:25:38,994
I was never the leader until now.

585
00:25:39,135 --> 00:25:42,164
But people chose me.

586
00:25:42,365 --> 00:25:43,805
My heart hurts.

587
00:25:44,305 --> 00:25:45,704
Oh, no.

588
00:25:46,204 --> 00:25:47,805
Please pick the song.

589
00:25:48,575 --> 00:25:49,575
Okay.

590
00:25:50,875 --> 00:25:52,214
"Jealousy."

591
00:25:52,615 --> 00:25:54,414
- "Jealousy." - Yes, "Jealousy!"

592
00:25:54,615 --> 00:25:55,714
"Jealousy."

593
00:25:58,654 --> 00:26:02,385
Did you choose the trainees you want in your heart?

594
00:26:03,254 --> 00:26:05,295
- Oh, gosh. - Oh, gosh.

595
00:26:05,555 --> 00:26:07,424
Yes. Oh, goodness.

596
00:26:08,625 --> 00:26:09,795
He chose.

597
00:26:11,464 --> 00:26:12,535
Hold on.

598
00:26:13,535 --> 00:26:14,805
Okay.

599
00:26:15,204 --> 00:26:17,805
We'll wait.

600
00:26:20,504 --> 00:26:22,575
KENSHIN is cute.

601
00:26:22,904 --> 00:26:25,345
For the main dancer, I want trainee HYUNWOO.

602
00:26:27,444 --> 00:26:31,254
- Trainee KIM HYUNWOO. - KENSHIN!

603
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:34,785
Please come forward.

604
00:26:36,055 --> 00:26:38,125
What if KENSHIN doesn't choose us?

605
00:26:39,025 --> 00:26:40,724
Dancer, JINWON.

606
00:26:40,964 --> 00:26:42,963
- Yes! - Come on.

607
00:26:42,964 --> 00:26:45,334
Come forward, trainee SEO JINWON.

608
00:26:45,335 --> 00:26:47,581
(40th-place trainee SEO JINWON was assembled into A2 Team White.)

609
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:49,605
There are four people left.

610
00:26:50,805 --> 00:26:53,035
Main vocal.

611
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:55,904
HANBIN. Come on!

612
00:26:56,914 --> 00:27:00,385
(29th-place trainee LEE HANBIN was assembled into A2 Team White.)

613
00:27:00,484 --> 00:27:02,815
Hey, I was your roommate.

614
00:27:04,585 --> 00:27:07,825
Main vocal, SHIN JAEWON.

615
00:27:09,625 --> 00:27:12,265
(25th-place trainee SHIN JAEWON was assembled into A2 Team White.)

616
00:27:12,454 --> 00:27:15,095
It could be a good idea to take all of the vocalists...

617
00:27:15,994 --> 00:27:17,295
strategically.

618
00:27:18,464 --> 00:27:19,904
Visual, SUNGMIN.

619
00:27:20,904 --> 00:27:21,904
SUNGMIN.

620
00:27:23,504 --> 00:27:24,575
What?

621
00:27:27,444 --> 00:27:29,244
- Rapper. - Dance.

622
00:27:30,075 --> 00:27:31,174
Vocal.

623
00:27:31,345 --> 00:27:32,614
- Visual. - Visual.

624
00:27:32,615 --> 00:27:34,585
We don't have a rapper.

625
00:27:38,385 --> 00:27:40,285
JEONGMIN.

626
00:27:40,385 --> 00:27:42,325
Thank you!

627
00:27:42,355 --> 00:27:43,924
I love you!

628
00:27:46,595 --> 00:27:50,295
The A2 Team White has been assembled.

629
00:27:51,635 --> 00:27:53,264
Okay. Nice!

630
00:27:53,865 --> 00:27:55,035
Is it okay?

631
00:27:55,365 --> 00:27:57,134
I was a bit upset.

632
00:27:57,135 --> 00:28:00,304
It confirmed my position.

633
00:28:00,305 --> 00:28:01,605
It was a bit upsetting.

634
00:28:02,545 --> 00:28:06,414
I am worried that Team White has many high ranking trainees.

635
00:28:07,744 --> 00:28:09,645
I believe if we focus on Team Black...

636
00:28:09,845 --> 00:28:12,454
and work on improving ourselves,

637
00:28:12,714 --> 00:28:15,555
we'll naturally beat Team White.

638
00:28:16,055 --> 00:28:18,223
(A2: MONSTA X, Team Black, "GAMBLER")

639
00:28:18,224 --> 00:28:20,095
(Team White, "Jealousy")

640
00:28:20,964 --> 00:28:24,034
The group A3 chose was Stray Kids.

641
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,635
I'm going crazy.

642
00:28:26,135 --> 00:28:27,503
Our first place!

643
00:28:27,504 --> 00:28:29,281
(A3 trainee JEON MINWOOK will assemble his team.)

644
00:28:29,305 --> 00:28:31,135
You'll always be first place for me.

645
00:28:31,805 --> 00:28:35,244
First, choose the song you'd like.

646
00:28:35,504 --> 00:28:36,875
Because it's a competition,

647
00:28:36,974 --> 00:28:40,085
we need to catch the attention of the audience on stage.

648
00:28:40,345 --> 00:28:41,544
I choose "LALALALA."

649
00:28:41,545 --> 00:28:42,814
(He chose "LALALALA" by Stray Kids.)

650
00:28:42,815 --> 00:28:43,815
Oh, my.

651
00:28:44,154 --> 00:28:45,254
He chose "LALALALA."

652
00:28:45,484 --> 00:28:48,954
I thought I could show the World Assemblers...

653
00:28:49,085 --> 00:28:50,754
a new side of me.

654
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,825
That's why I prayed for "LALALALA."

655
00:29:00,635 --> 00:29:04,535
I choose trainee KANG HYUNWOO.

656
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:08,074
Trainee KANG HYUNWOO.

657
00:29:08,075 --> 00:29:10,715
(8th-place trainee KANG HYUNWOO was assembled into A3 Team White.)

658
00:29:11,014 --> 00:29:13,115
I choose trainee JANG YEOJUN.

659
00:29:14,444 --> 00:29:17,315
(6th-place trainee JANG YEOJUN was assembled into A3 Team White.)

660
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:23,824
I choose trainee SEO KYOUNGBAE.

661
00:29:23,825 --> 00:29:25,630
(7th-place trainee SEO KYOUNGBAE was assembled into A3 Team White.)

662
00:29:25,654 --> 00:29:27,724
- What's up? - Oh, my.

663
00:29:28,525 --> 00:29:30,494
I choose trainee SONG SEUNGHO.

664
00:29:31,434 --> 00:29:34,535
(14th-place trainee SONG SEUNGHO was assembled into A3 Team White.)

665
00:29:35,365 --> 00:29:36,605
Please.

666
00:29:38,105 --> 00:29:39,234
Please.

667
00:29:40,305 --> 00:29:42,443
I want someone who can rap well.

668
00:29:42,444 --> 00:29:43,644
Someone with a strong rap style.

669
00:29:43,645 --> 00:29:46,214
If we need a higher vocal range, we need SIHUN.

670
00:29:49,385 --> 00:29:52,355
Wouldn't it be better to choose someone else first, then?

671
00:29:52,754 --> 00:29:54,424
I choose BINGHUA.

672
00:29:55,954 --> 00:29:57,224
No, I want to do it.

673
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:06,395
(There is only 1 spot left for A3 Team White.)

674
00:30:06,595 --> 00:30:07,664
What should I do?

675
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:17,414
- Lastly, I choose trainee ABE YURA. - Really?

676
00:30:17,974 --> 00:30:20,814
- Really? - Oh, no.

677
00:30:20,815 --> 00:30:23,385
(21st-place trainee ABE YURA was assembled into A3 Team White.)

678
00:30:24,184 --> 00:30:27,154
(A3 Team White has been assembled.)

679
00:30:27,385 --> 00:30:30,654
Our team's strength is that we have a younger feel.

680
00:30:31,154 --> 00:30:34,895
I'm thinking a vigorous and powerful performance by younger trainees...

681
00:30:35,565 --> 00:30:39,295
could beat a smooth performance by experienced trainees.

682
00:30:39,835 --> 00:30:40,934
We have to win.

683
00:30:41,504 --> 00:30:44,875
I have to see MINWOOK's face when we beat his team.

684
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,275
We'll do our best and crush them.

685
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:53,384
We need to beat Team Black and go to the next round.

686
00:30:53,385 --> 00:30:54,683
Since you're Team Black,

687
00:30:54,684 --> 00:30:56,753
you can be underneath us...

688
00:30:56,754 --> 00:30:59,555
like the Shadow Zone.

689
00:31:01,984 --> 00:31:03,953
(A3: Stray Kids, Team Black, "CASE 143")

690
00:31:03,954 --> 00:31:05,924
(Team White, "LALALALA")

691
00:31:06,555 --> 00:31:08,825
The group A4 chose...

692
00:31:09,224 --> 00:31:10,934
is NCT.

693
00:31:12,734 --> 00:31:15,004
Please choose the song first.

694
00:31:16,605 --> 00:31:18,335
I choose NCT's...

695
00:31:19,434 --> 00:31:21,805
- "Make A Wish." - "Make A Wish."

696
00:31:28,785 --> 00:31:30,184
That must be so much pressure.

697
00:31:32,885 --> 00:31:35,085
- Show me your heart. - Show me your heart.

698
00:31:36,025 --> 00:31:38,595
First, I choose...

699
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:42,463
YOUNGSEO to be the main vocalist.

700
00:31:42,464 --> 00:31:43,963
Oh, the main vocalist.

701
00:31:43,964 --> 00:31:46,644
(22nd-place trainee YOO YOUNGSEO was assembled into A4 Team White.)

702
00:31:46,764 --> 00:31:49,804
I choose trainee NAM JIWOON to be our visual.

703
00:31:49,805 --> 00:31:52,403
Please come forward, trainee NAM JIWOON.

704
00:31:52,404 --> 00:31:55,004
(12th-place trainee NAM JIWOON was assembled into A4 Team White.)

705
00:31:56,105 --> 00:31:58,914
Dancer. I can be the dancer.

706
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:07,454
I choose ANDY.

707
00:32:07,654 --> 00:32:09,384
Yes. Oh, my gosh.

708
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:11,153
Oh, my gosh.

709
00:32:11,154 --> 00:32:13,170
(19th-place trainee ANDY was assembled into A4 Team White.)

710
00:32:13,194 --> 00:32:14,295
Oh, gosh.

711
00:32:15,065 --> 00:32:16,694
Please.

712
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:18,894
Please.

713
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:20,365
I choose SOTA.

714
00:32:20,635 --> 00:32:21,805
- SOTA! - What?

715
00:32:23,605 --> 00:32:28,145
(23rd-place trainee FUKUYAMA SOTA was assembled into A4 Team White.)

716
00:32:29,045 --> 00:32:30,444
I'm good at performing live.

717
00:32:36,615 --> 00:32:38,314
YICHEN chooses JUNWON.

718
00:32:38,315 --> 00:32:40,585
Yes! Thank you!

719
00:32:41,724 --> 00:32:44,124
(15th-place trainee AHN JUNWON was assembled into A4 Team White.)

720
00:32:44,125 --> 00:32:45,694
There is one person left.

721
00:32:46,694 --> 00:32:47,764
There is one person left.

722
00:32:47,964 --> 00:32:49,423
I seriously practised "Make A Wish" for five years.

723
00:32:49,424 --> 00:32:51,994
- YICHEN. - YICHEN.

724
00:32:52,335 --> 00:32:53,395
Me.

725
00:32:55,035 --> 00:32:56,164
I choose LYNNLYNN.

726
00:32:56,974 --> 00:32:58,035
I choose LYNNLYNN.

727
00:32:58,135 --> 00:32:59,204
LYNNLYNN.

728
00:33:00,504 --> 00:33:01,544
Thank you.

729
00:33:01,545 --> 00:33:04,214
(48th-place trainee LYNNLYNN was assembled into A4 Team White.)

730
00:33:07,984 --> 00:33:11,684
Trainee YICHEN's Team White has been assembled.

731
00:33:12,654 --> 00:33:14,825
Was there a reason why you chose this team?

732
00:33:15,525 --> 00:33:19,095
First, I needed him to be the main vocalist.

733
00:33:19,395 --> 00:33:21,494
And I needed a visual.

734
00:33:21,964 --> 00:33:25,164
I chose people who could portray "Make A Wish" well.

735
00:33:26,035 --> 00:33:29,365
YICHEN. We're going to win.

736
00:33:29,635 --> 00:33:31,135
You're going to regret this.

737
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,925
While they get too confident and laugh mindlessly...

738
00:33:36,004 --> 00:33:38,564
because they got to be on a team with people they were close to,

739
00:33:38,645 --> 00:33:40,714
we'll make a surprise attack.

740
00:33:40,914 --> 00:33:44,914
They gave off this vibe of thinking they'd obviously win.

741
00:33:46,154 --> 00:33:47,754
But they shouldn't let their guard down.

742
00:33:49,224 --> 00:33:51,224
I worked hard to choose them,

743
00:33:51,395 --> 00:33:52,624
and they threw me aside.

744
00:33:52,625 --> 00:33:54,263
Let's go.

745
00:33:54,264 --> 00:33:56,223
That's okay. I can understand.

746
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:58,424
You don't get benefit points for having a high ranking.

747
00:33:59,565 --> 00:34:00,905
Because I have a low ranking...

748
00:34:02,235 --> 00:34:05,134
Sorry. Since I have a low ranking, I'll take the benefit points.

749
00:34:06,304 --> 00:34:08,203
(A4, NCT 127 and NCT U, Team Black, "TOUCH")

750
00:34:08,204 --> 00:34:10,275
(Team White, "Make A Wish")

751
00:34:10,744 --> 00:34:13,045
Please come forward, trainee OK CHANGHYEON,

752
00:34:13,645 --> 00:34:18,215
the trainee with the highest ranking in A5 at 42nd place.

753
00:34:20,054 --> 00:34:21,883
(A5 trainee OK CHANGHYEON will assemble the team.)

754
00:34:21,884 --> 00:34:22,954
I...

755
00:34:25,155 --> 00:34:27,163
will not choose "Deja Vu..."

756
00:34:27,164 --> 00:34:29,164
and choose "I'll See You There Tomorrow."

757
00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:31,694
"I'll See You There Tomorrow."

758
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:33,704
- That suits him. - He gave it a twist.

759
00:34:33,764 --> 00:34:35,734
- Please choose me. - He chose...

760
00:34:35,735 --> 00:34:36,935
"I'll See You There Tomorrow."

761
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:38,304
I'll be waiting, CHANGHYEON.

762
00:34:41,244 --> 00:34:44,215
I choose trainee CHO HYOJIN.

763
00:34:44,545 --> 00:34:47,013
Please come forward, trainee CHO HYOJIN.

764
00:34:47,014 --> 00:34:49,191
(58th-place trainee CHO HYOJIN was assembled into A5 Team White.)

765
00:34:49,215 --> 00:34:50,414
Next...

766
00:34:51,184 --> 00:34:53,284
I choose trainee KIM JIMIN.

767
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:57,594
(64th-place trainee KIM JIMIN was assembled into A5 Team White.)

768
00:34:57,724 --> 00:34:58,824
Next...

769
00:34:59,255 --> 00:35:01,965
I choose rockstar, trainee OH YOUNGWOONG.

770
00:35:02,525 --> 00:35:05,934
(54th-place trainee OH YOUNGWOONG was assembled into A5 Team White.)

771
00:35:06,735 --> 00:35:08,434
Let's do our best.

772
00:35:08,704 --> 00:35:10,404
Let's do really well.

773
00:35:10,405 --> 00:35:12,974
- Next. - I choose trainee KANG JIMIN.

774
00:35:13,005 --> 00:35:14,944
Trainee KANG JIMIN.

775
00:35:14,945 --> 00:35:16,243
(56th-place trainee KANG JIMIN was assembled into A5 Team White.)

776
00:35:16,244 --> 00:35:18,675
Oh, my. They have two JIMINs.

777
00:35:19,414 --> 00:35:20,815
This song doesn't have a rap part.

778
00:35:21,145 --> 00:35:22,343
On the other hand,

779
00:35:22,344 --> 00:35:24,484
it could be a good idea to take someone...

780
00:35:24,485 --> 00:35:26,883
who would be very good performing "Deja Vu."

781
00:35:26,884 --> 00:35:28,354
Since we'll be competing against them.

782
00:35:28,355 --> 00:35:31,694
So I was thinking JUNWOO or EUNSUH.

783
00:35:31,695 --> 00:35:33,425
I didn't think about that.

784
00:35:34,264 --> 00:35:37,364
CHANGHYEON is always very smart.

785
00:35:39,364 --> 00:35:42,364
I think CHANGHYEON will take more dancers.

786
00:35:43,434 --> 00:35:45,334
I choose trainee KIM JUNWOO.

787
00:35:45,335 --> 00:35:49,704
(61st-place trainee KIM JUNWOO was assembled into A5 Team White.)

788
00:35:49,875 --> 00:35:51,514
I choose trainee LEE EUNSUH.

789
00:35:53,414 --> 00:35:55,984
(63rd-place trainee LEE EUNSUH was assembled into A5 Team White.)

790
00:35:55,985 --> 00:35:57,683
- Oh, my. - With this,

791
00:35:57,684 --> 00:35:59,953
A5 trainee OK CHANGHYEON's Team White...

792
00:35:59,954 --> 00:36:01,354
has been assembled.

793
00:36:01,355 --> 00:36:02,360
(A5 Team White has been assembled.)

794
00:36:02,384 --> 00:36:05,295
CHANGHYEON is still young. He doesn't have a good eye.

795
00:36:05,594 --> 00:36:09,465
He didn't choose any of the people I wanted.

796
00:36:10,025 --> 00:36:11,745
So I'm very satisfied with my current team.

797
00:36:14,905 --> 00:36:16,934
I'm not there.

798
00:36:17,105 --> 00:36:20,505
So how could your team win?

799
00:36:21,105 --> 00:36:23,545
There can't be 2 suns in 1 team.

800
00:36:23,815 --> 00:36:25,074
We'll be the ones to rise up.

801
00:36:29,445 --> 00:36:31,954
It feels like I've seen this scene before.

802
00:36:32,014 --> 00:36:33,255
It feels like "Deja Vu."

803
00:36:36,085 --> 00:36:37,554
"I'll See You There Tomorrow!"

804
00:36:37,954 --> 00:36:39,625
I saw that Team "Deja Vu" will lose.

805
00:36:39,755 --> 00:36:40,864
Oh, no.

806
00:36:43,864 --> 00:36:45,863
(A5: TOMORROW X TOGETHER, Team Black, "Deja Vu")

807

(Team White, I'll See You There Tomorrow")

808
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:51,174
The ten teams and the song selection...

809
00:36:51,175 --> 00:36:54,775
for the Rival Match have been decided.

810
00:36:56,445 --> 00:37:00,815
(The World Assemblers have created...)

811
00:37:02,085 --> 00:37:05,184
(the best combinations...)

812
00:37:06,014 --> 00:37:08,884
(and the greatest rivals.)

813
00:37:12,494 --> 00:37:14,494
We definitely have a good chance of winning.

814
00:37:15,264 --> 00:37:19,465
Unexpectedly, our team was better than Team White.

815
00:37:19,934 --> 00:37:22,664
To be honest, I think our team is much stronger.

816
00:37:23,065 --> 00:37:24,973
Not being chosen...

817
00:37:24,974 --> 00:37:28,405
wasn't really a reason for me to feel discouraged.

818
00:37:28,605 --> 00:37:31,574
I want to beat Team White and make them regret.

819
00:37:32,344 --> 00:37:34,114
Team Black. Be careful.

820
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:37,184
Ultimately, first place is ours.

821
00:37:38,855 --> 00:37:42,684

- Oh, yes. - Oh, my.

834
00:38:23,895 --> 00:38:25,034
Okay.

835
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:29,005

- What do you think of my choice? - I love it.

839
00:38:36,405 --> 00:38:38,174
- It's okay, right? - I love it.

840
00:38:38,175 --> 00:38:40,144
He chose all of us here.

841
00:38:40,145 --> 00:38:41,814
- Thank you. - First...

842
00:38:41,815 --> 00:38:43,815
- The song is so nice. - It's so nice.

843
00:38:44,054 --> 00:38:45,155
It's so obvious.

844
00:38:46,514 --> 00:38:48,424
I'm not just saying this because of the cameras.

845
00:38:48,425 --> 00:38:49,683
I don't feel so down. Do you?

846
00:38:49,684 --> 00:38:51,953
- Honestly, I like our team. - I don't feel down at all.

847
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:53,454
This is the real Team White.

848

- We could switch our clothes. - Seriously.

849
00:38:56,065 --> 00:39:00,194
I think we could do very well.

850
00:39:00,195 --> 00:39:03,335
I think we could very well win.

851
00:39:03,804 --> 00:39:05,973
All seven members are great.

852
00:39:05,974 --> 00:39:09,175
I think we can beat Team White without any problems.

853
00:39:10,574 --> 00:39:12,014
Do you have any parts that you want?

854
00:39:13,474 --> 00:39:15,144
Should we say our top two favourite parts?

855
00:39:15,145 --> 00:39:16,244
- Okay. - Sounds good.

856
00:39:16,985 --> 00:39:19,014
For me, the main vocalist or the lead vocalist.

857
00:39:19,585 --> 00:39:22,485
For me, the main vocalist or the lead vocalist.

858
00:39:23,224 --> 00:39:25,231
Same for me. The main vocalist or the lead vocalist.

859
00:39:25,255 --> 00:39:26,395
This is intense.

860
00:39:28,195 --> 00:39:29,663
Time is going backwards

861
00:39:29,664 --> 00:39:32,295
We have many strong vocalists.

862
00:39:33,295 --> 00:39:36,134
- You and I our memories - Our memories

863
00:39:36,505 --> 00:39:38,573
Don't want to waste

864
00:39:38,574 --> 00:39:40,703
I majored in applied music,

865
00:39:40,704 --> 00:39:43,005
so I want to have confidence and give this a try.

866
00:39:43,574 --> 00:39:45,651
- Let's announce the parts. - I'll make the announcements.

867
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:49,315
The main vocalist of Team "Memories..."

868
00:39:50,684 --> 00:39:53,315
- Drumroll. - Drumroll.

869
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:57,494
(The main vocalist is trainee KIM DOHUN.)

870
00:39:59,054 --> 00:40:01,125
- Congratulations. - DOHUN.

871
00:40:01,494 --> 00:40:04,335
- Thank you. - DOHUN will do it.

872
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:08,303
We actually have many good singers on our team,

873
00:40:08,304 --> 00:40:10,465
but thankfully, I became the main vocalist.

874
00:40:11,634 --> 00:40:13,204
I'm a bit sad.

875
00:40:14,875 --> 00:40:17,315
Sadly, I wasn't chosen by my members.

876
00:40:17,545 --> 00:40:20,014
In a way, I could say I was pushed out of my spot.

877
00:40:20,574 --> 00:40:21,644
- The lead... - The lead...

878
00:40:21,645 --> 00:40:23,644
- Earlier... - These two.

879
00:40:23,645 --> 00:40:24,655
Then me too.

880
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,155
- I can't back down anymore. - I also want to be the lead...

881
00:40:27,454 --> 00:40:30,255
I tried to get every position I could go for.

882
00:40:32,425 --> 00:40:34,394
(Trainee KIM JOOHYUN became the center and the lead vocalist.)

883
00:40:34,395 --> 00:40:36,035
- I'll do my best. - Please do your best.

884
00:40:36,625 --> 00:40:38,134
I'll make sure our team wins.

885
00:40:38,434 --> 00:40:39,634
One, two, three.

886
00:40:42,864 --> 00:40:43,973
Thank you.

887
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:45,605
- Okay. - I'll do the rap.

888
00:40:45,835 --> 00:40:49,804
I was very confident about my vocal abilities,

889
00:40:50,105 --> 00:40:51,574
but I guess they weren't that great.

890
00:40:51,974 --> 00:40:55,743
I was very worried about what to show everyone.

(After all of the parts have been distributed)

893
00:41:01,724 --> 00:41:04,855
To be honest, I'm so sorry, but...

894
00:41:05,195 --> 00:41:06,924
This ranking... This performance...

895
00:41:06,925 --> 00:41:09,264
This performance could be my last.

896
00:41:09,324 --> 00:41:11,094
That's the ranking I have.

897
00:41:11,565 --> 00:41:14,604
Could I possibly have...

898
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:17,605
another chance to try again?

899
00:41:21,844 --> 00:41:25,315
I could understand how EUNSUH and other members felt.

900
00:41:25,574 --> 00:41:28,214
After the Passing Ceremony,

901
00:41:28,215 --> 00:41:32,684
when we heard how many people would move on to the next round,

902
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:34,864
I thought, "This could be my last chance."

903
00:41:35,625 --> 00:41:38,554
"What if I get eliminated here?"

904
00:41:39,395 --> 00:41:41,695
I was so desperate.

905
00:41:42,195 --> 00:41:45,565
I really want to do this without any regrets.

906
00:41:45,664 --> 00:41:48,104
Even if I get eliminated. Of course, it'd be great not to be.

907
00:41:48,264 --> 00:41:51,104
I didn't think my ranking was very high...

908
00:41:51,105 --> 00:41:53,574
considering we had to get in the top 35 to pass.

909
00:41:54,045 --> 00:41:56,004
I had mixed feelings.

910
00:41:56,005 --> 00:41:58,215
I was upset, but I could understand him.

911
00:41:58,514 --> 00:42:01,944
I know how SEOKHEE feels,

912
00:42:01,945 --> 00:42:04,154
but it was already decided.

913
00:42:04,155 --> 00:42:05,383
(AYALON ADAM, 50th place at the 1st Passing Ceremony)

914
00:42:05,384 --> 00:42:07,155
First, we divided up the parts.

915
00:42:08,224 --> 00:42:09,824
So I think we should...

916
00:42:10,085 --> 00:42:12,454
proceed with those parts.

917
00:42:13,695 --> 00:42:16,924
Let's make the formations up until the first chorus.

918
00:42:16,925 --> 00:42:17,933
- Sounds good. - Sounds good.

919
00:42:17,934 --> 00:42:18,934
First.

920
00:42:19,494 --> 00:42:20,494
We'll start...

921
00:42:20,495 --> 00:42:22,835
with JOOHYUN coming up from the back to the center.

922
00:42:23,235 --> 00:42:26,174
SEOKHEE and ADAM will slightly move out of the way.

923
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:28,203
So a V shape like this.

924
00:42:28,204 --> 00:42:29,404
Can we get into a V formation?

925
00:42:29,605 --> 00:42:31,343
Is "We Riize" also the center's part?

926
00:42:31,344 --> 00:42:33,045
Yes, JOOHYUN will start there.

927
00:42:33,945 --> 00:42:34,985
And then...

928
00:42:36,184 --> 00:42:37,783
Then JOOHYUN and I...

929
00:42:37,784 --> 00:42:39,815
should switch the running part.

930
00:42:41,224 --> 00:42:42,284
Let's try it.

931
00:42:44,054 --> 00:42:45,755
- Let's do it like this. - Okay.

932
00:42:45,925 --> 00:42:48,263
We could do the jump at the end...

933
00:42:48,264 --> 00:42:49,695
- on the remaining beat. - Yes.

934
00:42:49,994 --> 00:42:51,034
Let's do that.

935
00:42:51,065 --> 00:42:52,493
- I'm so tired. - Three and...

936
00:42:52,494 --> 00:42:53,694
(He checks the choreography video.)

937
00:42:53,695 --> 00:42:55,005
When I was young I screamed

938
00:42:57,304 --> 00:42:59,034
I'm always at the end.

939
00:42:59,534 --> 00:43:01,274
To be honest,

940
00:43:01,275 --> 00:43:02,674
I wanted to practice...

941
00:43:02,675 --> 00:43:05,674
without any complaints about my part...

942
00:43:05,675 --> 00:43:08,115
because I experienced that during the last Position Matching.

943
00:43:08,215 --> 00:43:10,613
I really am not trying to pressure you,

944
00:43:10,614 --> 00:43:12,114
but my part is way too short.

945
00:43:12,414 --> 00:43:14,294
I really don't have anything. What should I do?

946
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:15,925
I mean...

947
00:43:16,824 --> 00:43:18,694
Are we doing this mission together?

948
00:43:18,695 --> 00:43:21,895
Or am I just a backup for the chorus?

949
00:43:22,994 --> 00:43:25,663
To be completely honest,

950
00:43:25,664 --> 00:43:27,904
I feel like, "I don't want to do this."

951
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:30,104
I kind of feel like that.

952
00:43:30,105 --> 00:43:32,204
I didn't want to hide this because of our members.

953
00:43:32,574 --> 00:43:35,774
When I heard SEOKHEE say that,

954
00:43:35,775 --> 00:43:39,775
I honestly felt so lost at that moment.

955
00:43:40,945 --> 00:43:42,844
What should we do about this?

956
00:43:43,184 --> 00:43:45,514
I'm having a mental breakdown.

957
00:43:46,384 --> 00:43:48,625
Yes. I feel so confused.

958
00:43:48,724 --> 00:43:50,155
I don't know what to do.

959
00:43:50,954 --> 00:43:52,554
There's no solution to this.

960
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:55,994
Seriously.

961
00:43:57,364 --> 00:43:59,263
It is a fact that there's no solution,

962
00:43:59,264 --> 00:44:00,933
but if I just sit back and not do anything,

963
00:44:00,934 --> 00:44:03,304
I think future me will regret it. If I get eliminated.

964
00:44:04,065 --> 00:44:06,274
I must think, "I should've done something."

965
00:44:06,275 --> 00:44:08,604
(How will Team "Memories" resolve their part distribution issue?)

966
00:44:08,605 --> 00:44:09,844
Then what do you want to do?

967
00:44:11,574 --> 00:44:12,814
(Meanwhile, how are their rivals, Team "Boom Boom Bass" doing?)

968
00:44:12,815 --> 00:44:15,145
- Sub-vocalist three is JUNWOO. - JUNWOO.

969
00:44:15,744 --> 00:44:18,585
- And sub-vocalist four is KOTARO. - KOTARO.

970
00:44:18,655 --> 00:44:21,085
I think we have all of the parts.

971
00:44:21,585 --> 00:44:24,295
We now have to pick the center, the face of our team.

972
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:28,025
The person who can portray "Boom Boom Bass" the best.

973
00:44:29,864 --> 00:44:31,064
(Center Benefit)

974
00:44:31,065 --> 00:44:33,094
(The center gets to lead the performance, )

975
00:44:33,534 --> 00:44:38,605
(and they even get a solo part to show of their dance skills.)

976
00:44:39,005 --> 00:44:40,905
The center is a very important position.

977
00:44:41,005 --> 00:44:44,074
Let's pick our center.

978
00:44:46,014 --> 00:44:48,584
Because I'm in 35th place,

979
00:44:48,585 --> 00:44:50,715
I feel very desperate.

980
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:53,355
I'm feeling a lot of pressure.

981
00:44:54,184 --> 00:44:58,324
To be honest, I'm in 36th place.

982
00:44:58,425 --> 00:45:02,065
I thought I'd be in danger at this rate.

983
00:45:02,695 --> 00:45:04,934
You can nominate yourself to be the center.

984
00:45:05,594 --> 00:45:07,335
I want to be the center.

985
00:45:07,934 --> 00:45:12,073
I thought everyone would definitely want this position.

986
00:45:12,074 --> 00:45:14,904
When I heard that only 35 people would avoid elimination,

987
00:45:14,905 --> 00:45:16,944
I competed with determination...

988
00:45:16,945 --> 00:45:19,175
to seize the chance for sure.

989
00:45:20,375 --> 00:45:22,344
Boom bass.

990
00:45:22,414 --> 00:45:23,815
One, two.

991
00:45:24,715 --> 00:45:28,425
(The 1st center part during Chorus 1)

992
00:45:29,425 --> 00:45:32,154
It should be done by someone...

993
00:45:32,155 --> 00:45:33,594
who can best pull off this part.

994
00:45:33,994 --> 00:45:36,195
(Trainee YU JIAHN is the first volunteer.)

995
00:45:45,974 --> 00:45:49,574
(Trainee KIM YOUNGHOON is the second volunteer.)

996
00:45:50,275 --> 00:45:53,514
(Trainee ASAKA KOTARO is the third volunteer.)

997
00:45:53,914 --> 00:45:56,645
(Trainee CHAE HEEJU is the fourth volunteer.)

998
00:46:01,384 --> 00:46:03,355
(Sighing)

999
00:46:05,155 --> 00:46:07,425
- Okay. - Good job.

1000
00:46:10,525 --> 00:46:11,695
Gosh, it's such a shame.

1001
00:46:12,494 --> 00:46:14,264
I made a big mistake.

1002
00:46:19,105 --> 00:46:20,934
I got flustered there...

1003
00:46:21,045 --> 00:46:23,275
and couldn't show my all.

1004
00:46:25,414 --> 00:46:28,013
Our team's center member is...

1005
00:46:28,014 --> 00:46:32,414
(Who is the center member of Team "Boom Boom Bass?")

1006
00:46:33,855 --> 00:46:35,183
JIAHN.

1007
00:46:35,184 --> 00:46:37,554
(The center of Team "Boom Boom Bass" is Trainee YU JIAHN.)

1008
00:46:38,454 --> 00:46:40,453
- Thank you. - Congratulations, JIAHN.

1009
00:46:40,454 --> 00:46:42,824
- Congratulations. - I'll do my best.

1010
00:46:45,465 --> 00:46:47,335
I felt so disappointed.

1011
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:50,664
I tried not to dwell on it, but it was hard.

1012
00:46:51,005 --> 00:46:52,235
Gosh, I feel so bad.

1013
00:46:53,704 --> 00:46:56,264
I knew I shouldn't have, but I couldn't stop myself from crying.

1014
00:46:56,505 --> 00:46:57,645
I actually...

1015
00:46:58,215 --> 00:46:59,974
want to be the center member so much.

1016
00:47:01,514 --> 00:47:04,085
I really want to survive this time.

1017
00:47:05,054 --> 00:47:07,585
I want to be the center member this time. Will it work?

1018
00:47:08,355 --> 00:47:09,554
Volunteer for the position.

1019
00:47:09,684 --> 00:47:10,925
I'm going to do it for sure.

1020
00:47:11,224 --> 00:47:12,454
I must survive this time.

1021
00:47:13,954 --> 00:47:15,064
(He's sad that he couldn't do the best he could.)

1022
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:16,895
I feel so bad that I made a mistake.

1023
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:19,134
It's all right.

1024
00:47:22,465 --> 00:47:24,404
HEEJU, what is it?

1025
00:47:24,405 --> 00:47:26,803
- I feel bad that I made a mistake. - What?

1026
00:47:26,804 --> 00:47:28,304
I feel so bad that I made a mistake.

1027
00:47:32,114 --> 00:47:34,914
When HEEJU showed tears,

1028
00:47:35,715 --> 00:47:38,054
I felt somewhat sorry...

1029
00:47:38,554 --> 00:47:40,815
and heavy-hearted.

1030
00:47:41,585 --> 00:47:42,985
I'll do my best.

1031
00:47:43,855 --> 00:47:45,493
You didn't get to shine...

1032
00:47:45,494 --> 00:47:47,271
despite your good performance when you were in Team "3D."

1033
00:47:47,295 --> 00:47:48,394
I'm aware of it,

1034
00:47:48,395 --> 00:47:49,764
so I want you to do better.

1035
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:52,834
- Let's do this. - Right.

1036
00:47:52,835 --> 00:47:54,115
- We can do this. - Let's do it.

1037
00:47:54,235 --> 00:47:56,964
Everyone is desperate in this situation,

1038
00:47:56,965 --> 00:47:58,835
and I'm just as desperate too.

1039
00:47:59,074 --> 00:48:00,804
So I can understand...

1040
00:48:00,934 --> 00:48:02,105
how he feels...

1041
00:48:03,945 --> 00:48:05,414
from the bottom of my heart.

1042
00:48:06,974 --> 00:48:09,513
I need to defeat someone this desperate...

1043
00:48:09,514 --> 00:48:10,944
if I'm to move up.

1044
00:48:10,945 --> 00:48:12,514
I think this is really hard.

1045
00:48:12,784 --> 00:48:15,284
Each one of us...

1046
00:48:15,485 --> 00:48:16,784
value ourselves the most.

1047
00:48:17,125 --> 00:48:19,255
We are the hero in our own lives.

1048
00:48:19,994 --> 00:48:21,994
But this is a survival.

1049
00:48:22,125 --> 00:48:24,195
We must make results...

1050
00:48:24,224 --> 00:48:26,965
by defeating someone desperate.

1051
00:48:27,695 --> 00:48:30,634
That's too tough.

1052
00:48:32,074 --> 00:48:34,033
(Team "Boom Boom Bass" is on the verge...)

1053
00:48:34,034 --> 00:48:36,234
(of survival and elimination. What future awaits them?)

1054
00:48:37,244 --> 00:48:40,044
I thought it was only right for a dancer...

1055
00:48:40,045 --> 00:48:42,384
to be the team's leader.

1056
00:48:43,744 --> 00:48:46,783
But we have so many skilled trainees in our team.

1057
00:48:46,784 --> 00:48:48,484
- I'll count on you guys. - Yes!

1058
00:48:48,485 --> 00:48:50,405
- Let's do a good job together. - Let's do this.

1059
00:48:51,525 --> 00:48:54,324
JAEWON is a skilled vocalist.

1060
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:58,064
He can help us with singing high notes or vocalizing.

1061
00:48:58,065 --> 00:48:59,663
He can help us improve our voice tones.

1062
00:48:59,664 --> 00:49:02,164
(This team with Trainee SHIN JAEWON as their leader...)

1063
00:49:02,704 --> 00:49:05,834
(has been assembled by Trainee SAKURADA KENSHIN.)

1064
00:49:05,835 --> 00:49:09,544
I assembled this team with balance in mind.

1065
00:49:09,545 --> 00:49:12,274
Two dancers, two singers,

1066
00:49:12,275 --> 00:49:14,544
one handsome member, and one rapper.

1067
00:49:14,545 --> 00:49:17,954
People call me the dancing king in Gyeongju.

1068
00:49:18,054 --> 00:49:19,354
KENSHIN probably chose me...

1069
00:49:19,355 --> 00:49:22,084
for my dancing skills.

1070
00:49:22,085 --> 00:49:25,093
HYUNWOO injured his leg,

1071
00:49:25,094 --> 00:49:26,453
but he's all cured now.

1072
00:49:26,454 --> 00:49:28,240
(Trainee KIM HYUNWOO recovered from his injury.)

1073
00:49:28,264 --> 00:49:30,163
And HANBIN, the master singer.

1074
00:49:30,164 --> 00:49:31,195
(29th, LEE HANBIN)

1075
00:49:31,634 --> 00:49:33,864
(The tiger teacher...)

1076
00:49:34,465 --> 00:49:36,133
(and the rapper, Trainee KIM JEONGMIN)

1077
00:49:36,134 --> 00:49:37,633
(34th, KIM JEONGMIN)

1078
00:49:37,634 --> 00:49:39,904
And for the handsome members, we have Trainee KIM SUNGMIN...

1079
00:49:39,905 --> 00:49:42,343
and KENSHIN with a unique smile.

1080
00:49:42,344 --> 00:49:45,875
We're in good balance for all positions.

1081
00:49:46,315 --> 00:49:47,374
How cool.

1082
00:49:47,375 --> 00:49:48,484
(They're going to prepare to perform "Jealousy.")

1083
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:49,815
This certainly is a highlight.

1084
00:49:50,344 --> 00:49:52,215
We have to express the groove.

1085
00:49:52,485 --> 00:49:55,754
We might have to focus on showing a mature side.

1086
00:49:55,755 --> 00:49:58,453
The song seems doable in general.

1087
00:49:58,454 --> 00:49:59,724
It's not too high.

1088
00:49:59,795 --> 00:50:01,094
- Really? - Gosh.

1089
00:50:02,164 --> 00:50:04,425
- He's the lead vocalist indeed. - Right.

1090
00:50:05,094 --> 00:50:07,633
I don't think it's too hard.

1091
00:50:07,634 --> 00:50:10,864
And the tone goes really well with HANBIN.

1092
00:50:11,605 --> 00:50:12,933
Let's do this.

1093
00:50:12,934 --> 00:50:14,945
- Right. - It'll be smooth sailing.

1094
00:50:14,974 --> 00:50:18,414
Who thinks HYUNWOO should be the center member?

1095
00:50:18,844 --> 00:50:21,013
(It's decided almost unanimously.)

1096
00:50:21,014 --> 00:50:22,484
Okay. Put your hands down.

1097
00:50:22,485 --> 00:50:23,944
- Just come. - Just come.

1098
00:50:23,945 --> 00:50:25,783
- Be the center member. - Right.

1099
00:50:25,784 --> 00:50:27,215
Do all you want.

1100
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:29,924
With your support,

1101
00:50:29,925 --> 00:50:31,053
- I will... - You're the center.

1102
00:50:31,054 --> 00:50:32,655
Trample on that team.

1103
00:50:33,695 --> 00:50:35,565
(A sudden provocation)

1104
00:50:37,195 --> 00:50:38,734
- Center! - Let's go.

1105
00:50:38,735 --> 00:50:41,234
I haven't shown much since I injured my ankle.

1106
00:50:41,235 --> 00:50:43,263
So they have high expectations for me.

1107
00:50:43,264 --> 00:50:44,933
"Will we finally get to see you dance?"

1108
00:50:44,934 --> 00:50:46,704
I've heard this like 100 times.

1109
00:50:47,005 --> 00:50:49,803
I'm determined to show something this time.

1110
00:50:49,804 --> 00:50:53,074
(He begins teaching the members with the determination.)

1111
00:50:53,645 --> 00:50:56,183
One, two, and back to your positions.

1112
00:50:56,184 --> 00:50:58,255
- Quickly... - Okay.

1113
00:50:58,554 --> 00:51:00,715
Does anyone not understand anything?

1114
00:51:00,815 --> 00:51:02,384
- We're okay so far. - Okay.

1115
00:51:06,795 --> 00:51:08,025
It's going smoothly.

1116
00:51:08,195 --> 00:51:09,663
Do you have a question?

1117
00:51:09,664 --> 00:51:11,395
It's all right.

1118
00:51:11,764 --> 00:51:12,895
We're done.

1119
00:51:13,795 --> 00:51:15,075
He makes it so easy to memorize.

1120
00:51:15,505 --> 00:51:17,703
Open your chest as you jump.

1121
00:51:17,704 --> 00:51:18,905
(But they have one problem.)

1122
00:51:19,105 --> 00:51:21,644
SUNGMIN is slower than the others...

1123
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:23,344
in terms of learning a new dance.

1124
00:51:23,875 --> 00:51:27,414
I'm not sure if I can express this vibe.

1125
00:51:28,014 --> 00:51:29,244
Let's go again.

1126
00:51:29,344 --> 00:51:30,585
Open your chest as you jump.

1127
00:51:30,815 --> 00:51:32,183
Gosh, you've improved.

1128
00:51:32,184 --> 00:51:33,315
Open your chest as you jump.

1129
00:51:33,655 --> 00:51:34,985
Gosh, you've improved.

1130
00:51:36,155 --> 00:51:37,323
SUNGMIN, what the...

1131
00:51:37,324 --> 00:51:38,553
Have I gotten better?

1132
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:39,724
Yes, you've improved.

1133
00:51:40,155 --> 00:51:41,435
You've started to dance finally.

1134
00:51:42,864 --> 00:51:44,295
- What does that mean? - Thanks.

1135
00:51:44,364 --> 00:51:45,434
How mean.

1136
00:51:45,465 --> 00:51:46,864
What was that after this?

1137
00:51:47,094 --> 00:51:48,164
Isn't it this?

1138
00:51:49,034 --> 00:51:52,703
(He even teaches the dancing king from Gyeongju.)

1139
00:51:52,704 --> 00:51:55,674
I saw him dance today, and he got better at dancing.

1140
00:51:55,675 --> 00:51:57,144
It relieved me a little.

1141
00:51:57,145 --> 00:51:58,513
SUNGMIN wasn't this fast...

1142
00:51:58,514 --> 00:52:00,614
at memorizing a choreography at first.

1143
00:52:00,815 --> 00:52:04,343
During the break, the First Tier trainees gathered...

1144
00:52:04,344 --> 00:52:06,354
to film the performance video of "RUN."

1145
00:52:06,355 --> 00:52:10,024
And all that experience must've made SUNGMIN used to practising.

1146
00:52:10,025 --> 00:52:12,425
There you go. This...

1147
00:52:13,054 --> 00:52:15,894
He keeps asking how to do this and that.

1148
00:52:15,895 --> 00:52:19,664
He's so willing that I'm not really worried.

1149
00:52:19,735 --> 00:52:21,663
Nice. You just have to practice.

1150
00:52:21,664 --> 00:52:22,704
Thanks.

1151
00:52:23,335 --> 00:52:26,434
(Now that SUNGMIN easily follows...)

1152
00:52:26,505 --> 00:52:28,573
I honestly wonder...

1153
00:52:28,574 --> 00:52:30,875
if it's okay to be this smooth.

1154
00:52:31,445 --> 00:52:32,844
Three and...

1155
00:52:33,244 --> 00:52:34,614
This is the end of the chorus.

1156
00:52:35,215 --> 00:52:36,215
Nice.

1157
00:52:36,514 --> 00:52:38,384
- We're done. - We're done with the chorus?

1158
00:52:38,554 --> 00:52:39,755
Perfect.

1159
00:52:39,855 --> 00:52:41,054
I think we can go home now.

1160
00:52:42,255 --> 00:52:43,425
Right?

1161
00:52:44,054 --> 00:52:46,824
It's better than expected even in my eyes.

1162
00:52:47,295 --> 00:52:49,323
I'm a little concerned because that team...

1163
00:52:49,324 --> 00:52:51,434
- Right. - has such a nice song.

1164
00:52:51,565 --> 00:52:54,634
We're going to compete with what we have.

1165
00:52:54,664 --> 00:52:56,264
That team is just lucky with their song.

1166
00:52:56,664 --> 00:52:59,005
We have such good members.

1167
00:52:59,605 --> 00:53:02,545
I'm not really minding the other team to be honest.

1168
00:53:02,704 --> 00:53:05,244
It doesn't come to me that we might lose.

1169
00:53:05,344 --> 00:53:08,414
We'll show how we dominate them.

1170
00:53:08,914 --> 00:53:10,513
- Gosh. - Again!

1171
00:53:10,514 --> 00:53:11,514
Nice!

1172
00:53:11,515 --> 00:53:13,555
(Unlike how confident and harmonious Team White is)

1173
00:53:13,954 --> 00:53:15,284
Guys.

1174
00:53:15,684 --> 00:53:17,783
One, two, three, four.

1175
00:53:17,784 --> 00:53:20,255
(Team Black's training zone is filled only with chanting.)

1176
00:53:21,094 --> 00:53:24,965
(Their leader is Trainee WOO HAJOON.)

1177
00:53:26,134 --> 00:53:27,465
- Let's go again. - Okay.

1178
00:53:27,565 --> 00:53:30,164
Five, six, seven, eight.

1179
00:53:31,164 --> 00:53:32,875
(Hesitating)

1180
00:53:36,405 --> 00:53:37,444
(Hesitating again)

1181
00:53:37,445 --> 00:53:38,945
- Sorry. - It's okay.

1182
00:53:39,974 --> 00:53:42,184
What's next?

1183
00:53:47,954 --> 00:53:49,124
- What? - Like this.

1184
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:50,985
(They don't seem to make progress.)

1185
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:54,593
(Same space)

1186
00:53:54,594 --> 00:53:58,164
(Different mood)

1187
00:54:02,335 --> 00:54:06,104
We didn't assemble this team.

1188
00:54:06,105 --> 00:54:10,243
KENSHIN didn't choose us,

1189
00:54:10,244 --> 00:54:13,874
so a lot of us aren't close.

1190
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:18,014
We aren't in a harmonious mood yet.

1191
00:54:24,184 --> 00:54:29,194
Team White only has skilled trainees.

1192
00:54:29,195 --> 00:54:32,235
A lot of them are high rankers too, which scares me.

1193
00:54:33,134 --> 00:54:35,604
Okay. Let's go over the formation for the chorus first.

1194
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:37,664
We have to memorize the choreography quickly.

1195
00:54:38,175 --> 00:54:41,644
One, two, three, four.

1196
00:54:41,645 --> 00:54:43,105
We have to move this much.

1197
00:54:43,704 --> 00:54:45,044
Let's go again. One.

1198
00:54:45,045 --> 00:54:46,244
From the top?

1199
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:53,754
- Our formation is off. - What?

1200
00:54:53,755 --> 00:54:56,453
When we move, we are a little off.

1201
00:54:56,454 --> 00:54:57,454
(They aren't making progress with their practice.)

1202
00:54:57,455 --> 00:54:58,925
Oh, the start?

1203
00:54:59,395 --> 00:55:01,054
We're in the same training room,

1204
00:55:01,355 --> 00:55:03,565
so I keep looking at them as we practice.

1205
00:55:04,195 --> 00:55:06,964
We're done with the first verse only now,

1206
00:55:06,965 --> 00:55:10,364
but they're working on their dance formations.

1207
00:55:10,934 --> 00:55:13,934
They're in a bright and peaceful mood too.

1208
00:55:14,804 --> 00:55:18,473
But our team seemed quite down...

1209
00:55:18,474 --> 00:55:20,045
during our practice.

1210
00:55:22,545 --> 00:55:24,185
Don't we have more choreography to cover?

1211
00:55:24,445 --> 00:55:25,485
We do.

1212
00:55:26,355 --> 00:55:27,985
(Groaning)

1213
00:55:28,224 --> 00:55:31,284
It seemed like they didn't have the desire to work hard.

1214
00:55:31,655 --> 00:55:34,994
I'm not sure if we can win. I'm really worried.

1215
00:55:36,525 --> 00:55:38,734
(Meanwhile, this trainee is practising hard by himself.)

1216
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:41,335
(It's Trainee MAJINGXIANG.)

1217
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:45,934
My final ranking was fifth in the Passing Ceremony.

1218
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:50,645
My goal is to be in the top seven and debut.

1219
00:55:52,215 --> 00:55:55,485
There are a lot of stronger contenders in Team White,

1220
00:55:56,114 --> 00:55:57,985
I need to work harder.

1221
00:56:00,384 --> 00:56:01,925
Nice!

1222
00:56:02,324 --> 00:56:03,724
I knew you could do it.

1223
00:56:04,655 --> 00:56:06,854
(He resumes his practice regardless of it.)

1224
00:56:06,855 --> 00:56:08,363
Three and four.

1225
00:56:08,364 --> 00:56:11,224
Just want to say, If you don't know, now you know

1226
00:56:12,534 --> 00:56:14,694
We need to practice as a group.

1227
00:56:14,695 --> 00:56:18,034
So we have to focus really hard.

1228
00:56:18,304 --> 00:56:19,835
Shall we practice the chorus part?

1229
00:56:20,204 --> 00:56:22,974
Five, six, seven, eight.

1230
00:56:23,005 --> 00:56:24,073
(They're back to practising.)

1231
00:56:24,074 --> 00:56:25,514
Here, yes.

1232
00:56:28,145 --> 00:56:29,414
Get up.

1233
00:56:30,244 --> 00:56:33,054
Show me something, girl, You want to be like

1234
00:56:35,884 --> 00:56:38,624
Team White is a strong contender.

1235
00:56:38,625 --> 00:56:40,194
I could feel...

1236
00:56:40,195 --> 00:56:43,695
that my teammates had this attitude of giving up.

1237
00:56:44,425 --> 00:56:47,835
It felt like, "We aren't going to make it."

1238
00:56:49,264 --> 00:56:52,235
They were all thinking, "This is exhausting."

1239
00:56:54,735 --> 00:56:56,073
I felt bad...

1240
00:56:56,074 --> 00:56:58,775
that we wasted so much time.

1241
00:56:58,945 --> 00:57:02,684
(Putting his head down)

1242
00:57:06,215 --> 00:57:08,084
I need to talk to you. Could you give me a second?

1243
00:57:08,085 --> 00:57:10,425
Can we talk outside?

1244
00:57:10,585 --> 00:57:11,993
Could you give us five minutes? You guys can practice.

1245
00:57:11,994 --> 00:57:14,394
- I need to go outside for a second. - Sure.

1246
00:57:14,395 --> 00:57:18,195
(Trainee MAJINGXIANG wanted to speak to Trainee WOO HAJOON, the leader.)

1247
00:57:19,534 --> 00:57:20,534
HAJOON.

1248
00:57:21,704 --> 00:57:25,004
I think we're very behind. I'm really worried.

1249
00:57:25,005 --> 00:57:27,405
It reminded me of a painful memory in the past.

1250
00:57:28,074 --> 00:57:31,005
The whole team has to practice over and over again.

1251
00:57:32,275 --> 00:57:35,783
(When he joined another survival show a year ago)

1252
00:57:35,784 --> 00:57:37,414
We don't have a lot of time.

1253
00:57:38,355 --> 00:57:40,484
(Trainee MAJINGXIANG is obsessed with practising...)

1254
00:57:40,485 --> 00:57:42,755
(that people called him Practice Monster.)

1255
00:57:43,824 --> 00:57:46,195
We don't have a lot of time.

1256
00:57:46,224 --> 00:57:49,493
The only good way to solve this...

1257
00:57:49,494 --> 00:57:51,025
is to practice over and over again.

1258
00:57:53,235 --> 00:57:54,633
Shall we practice one more time?

1259
00:57:54,634 --> 00:57:56,410
- Can we practice one more time? - Which part?

1260
00:57:56,434 --> 00:57:57,505
That one from earlier...

1261
00:57:58,634 --> 00:58:00,933
Let's practice one more time.

1262
00:58:00,934 --> 00:58:02,275
Five, six...

1263
00:58:04,005 --> 00:58:05,573
- What's wrong? - Can we practice one more time?

1264
00:58:05,574 --> 00:58:07,474
- Sure. - Let's play the song this time.

1265
00:58:07,974 --> 00:58:10,513
- Can we practice with the beat? - Which part?

1266
00:58:10,514 --> 00:58:12,854
Can we practice with the beat from the top?

1267
00:58:12,855 --> 00:58:14,513
- From the top? - Yes.

1268
00:58:14,514 --> 00:58:15,554
Okay.

1269
00:58:17,755 --> 00:58:18,993
I'm worried.

1270
00:58:18,994 --> 00:58:21,724
I'm slow at memorizing dance moves.

1271
00:58:22,465 --> 00:58:24,264
What you do?

1272
00:58:27,565 --> 00:58:29,335
SVIAT, one more time.

1273
00:58:31,304 --> 00:58:33,004
- Try again. - Are you okay?

1274
00:58:33,005 --> 00:58:34,234
- What? - Are you okay?

1275
00:58:34,235 --> 00:58:35,304
I'm okay.

1276
00:58:35,505 --> 00:58:37,074
Your eyes are red.

1277
00:58:37,244 --> 00:58:40,145
- When your interview is done... - Later. Hold on.

1278
00:58:45,914 --> 00:58:47,054
- Hey. - Yes?

1279
00:58:47,954 --> 00:58:49,724
I'm worried about MAJINGXIANG.

1280
00:58:57,695 --> 00:58:58,764
I did.

1281
00:58:59,195 --> 00:59:00,335
- This part... - Gosh.

1282
00:59:01,695 --> 00:59:03,964
Are you okay? What's wrong?

1283
00:59:03,965 --> 00:59:06,074
What's going on? Talk to me.

1284
00:59:06,574 --> 00:59:08,204
- I'm tired. - I'm okay.

1285
00:59:11,375 --> 00:59:13,315
I'm really lacking.

1286
00:59:14,215 --> 00:59:17,743
I need to practice more.

1287
00:59:17,744 --> 00:59:19,284
(What will happen to Team Black?)

1288
00:59:20,155 --> 00:59:23,684
(A3, Team Stray Kids' training room)

1289
00:59:23,855 --> 00:59:26,155
Please welcome everyone! I'm glad you're all on board.

1290
00:59:27,054 --> 00:59:28,894
(1st JEON MINWOOK, 6th JANG YEOJUN 8th KANG HYUNWOO)

1291
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:30,340
(14th SONG SEUNGHO, 7th SEO KYOUNGBAE, 9th BINGHUA...)

1292
00:59:30,364 --> 00:59:31,494
Here we go.

1293
00:59:32,134 --> 00:59:33,263
- First of all... - Let's go.

1294
00:59:33,264 --> 00:59:36,004
I think we have great team members.

1295
00:59:36,005 --> 00:59:37,334
- You picked the right ones. - You did a good job.

1296
00:59:37,335 --> 00:59:40,234
World Assemblers assembled it well.

1297
00:59:40,235 --> 00:59:42,445
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1298
00:59:42,804 --> 00:59:45,004
There are many of us who are still new to this.

1299
00:59:45,005 --> 00:59:46,485
But I have a good feeling about this.

1300
00:59:46,775 --> 00:59:49,184
I thought I did well with picking the team members.

1301
00:59:49,344 --> 00:59:52,314
No matter what song HYUNWOO sings,

1302
00:59:52,315 --> 00:59:55,384
I feel like he can perform well in the middle to support the team.

1303
00:59:55,655 --> 00:59:58,554
ABE YURA is such a great dancer.

1304
00:59:59,395 --> 01:00:01,593
KYOUNGBAE and YEOJUN...

1305
01:00:01,594 --> 01:00:04,425
They performed one of Stray Kids' songs during Zero Setting.

1306
01:00:04,494 --> 01:00:08,465
I thought they could pull off this song well.

1307
01:00:08,735 --> 01:00:12,274
I could see that SEUNGHO's rapping skills improved a lot.

1308
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:13,704
I look forward to his performance.

1309
01:00:13,775 --> 01:00:16,644
BINGHUA looks very soft.

1310
01:00:16,645 --> 01:00:19,214
He has this unexpected charm from that gentle look.

1311
01:00:19,215 --> 01:00:22,445
I thought it could be appealing.

1312
01:00:23,445 --> 01:00:25,755
I think the team's perfectly formed.

1313
01:00:25,784 --> 01:00:28,884
I thought we were a very fresh team.

1314
01:00:29,085 --> 01:00:31,624
We are the chosen ones.

1315
01:00:31,625 --> 01:00:33,954
The winner, JEON MINWOOK, chose us.

1316
01:00:33,994 --> 01:00:36,964
We will defeat Team Black and move on to the next round.

1317
01:00:36,965 --> 01:00:38,094
I'm very sure we can.

1318
01:00:38,764 --> 01:00:40,263
I thought,

1319
01:00:40,264 --> 01:00:44,364
"This is better than expected."

1320
01:00:44,764 --> 01:00:47,775
"Will MINWOOK be okay?"

1321
01:00:48,474 --> 01:00:53,074
"Why did he pick them?"

1322
01:00:53,974 --> 01:00:55,014
That's what I thought.

1323
01:00:55,784 --> 01:00:57,085
(Glancing)

1324
01:00:57,344 --> 01:00:58,714
Our strength is that...

1325
01:00:58,715 --> 01:01:01,154
- we have many experienced ones. - Right, they're experienced.

1326
01:01:01,155 --> 01:01:02,155
(They have many trainees with much experience.)

1327
01:01:02,156 --> 01:01:04,984
The vibe on the stage surely is different.

1328
01:01:04,985 --> 01:01:06,924
- You're right. - They can't catch up with that...

1329
01:01:06,925 --> 01:01:08,224
by practising tonight.

1330
01:01:08,565 --> 01:01:10,294
It's that kind of vibe you have from the experience.

1331
01:01:10,295 --> 01:01:12,065
I can surely tell it.

1332
01:01:12,534 --> 01:01:16,434
We have many trainees with experience and skills.

1333
01:01:16,864 --> 01:01:18,803
- SIHUN... - SIHUN.

1334
01:01:18,804 --> 01:01:20,634
- He's there. - SIHUN's the leader.

1335
01:01:24,945 --> 01:01:27,445
- Hold on a second. - What's wrong with you?

1336
01:01:28,244 --> 01:01:29,614
I'm still talking here!

1337
01:01:30,215 --> 01:01:32,514
I just wanted to stretch, so I turned.

1338
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:34,913
- What's wrong with that? - Don't spy on us.

1339
01:01:34,914 --> 01:01:36,854
I just needed to stretch. My goodness...

1340
01:01:36,855 --> 01:01:39,324
Hold on. I just wanted to stretch.

1341
01:01:39,724 --> 01:01:41,694
- MINWOOK can't be the leader. - He isn't the right one.

1342
01:01:41,695 --> 01:01:43,065
What? Why are you wearing that?

1343
01:01:43,094 --> 01:01:44,624
- It doesn't look nice already. - It's bad.

1344
01:01:44,625 --> 01:01:46,133
- I can see what's happening. - We know we can win them.

1345
01:01:46,134 --> 01:01:47,364
My goodness.

1346
01:01:47,494 --> 01:01:49,564
- We don't get swept by that. - MINWOOK's a horrible leader.

1347
01:01:49,565 --> 01:01:51,565
He talks badly because he's wearing black.

1348
01:01:52,704 --> 01:01:53,875
No!

1349
01:01:53,934 --> 01:01:56,074
Let's stay bright and share good words.

1350
01:01:56,175 --> 01:01:57,675
Let's stick with nice words only.

1351
01:01:58,005 --> 01:01:59,765
The winner over there doesn't mean anything.

1352
01:02:01,614 --> 01:02:02,744
Gosh.

1353
01:02:03,184 --> 01:02:04,715
Since I'm the leader here,

1354
01:02:04,744 --> 01:02:06,854
I'll keep the balance of the team.

1355
01:02:06,855 --> 01:02:08,283
Let's show a good performance.

1356
01:02:08,284 --> 01:02:09,884
- Great. - Let's do this.

1357
01:02:10,085 --> 01:02:13,454
I have to win. I have to prove to the team that didn't pick me.

1358
01:02:13,755 --> 01:02:15,565
I'll make them go down.

1359
01:02:15,795 --> 01:02:17,025
That team is going down.

1360
01:02:17,195 --> 01:02:20,034
Which dance moves do you know?

1361
01:02:20,295 --> 01:02:22,295
I know a bit of dance moves from the earlier part.

1362
01:02:22,505 --> 01:02:23,633
I know almost all the dance moves for the chorus part.

1363
01:02:23,634 --> 01:02:25,114
- Really? - I know most of the moves.

1364
01:02:25,735 --> 01:02:28,133
(Thanks to KYOUNGBAE who's familiar with the dances)

1365
01:02:28,134 --> 01:02:29,144
You do it like this.

1366
01:02:29,145 --> 01:02:32,715
- One, two, three, four. - Sorry.

1367
01:02:32,974 --> 01:02:34,113
- You lift your arms. - Lift arms.

1368
01:02:34,114 --> 01:02:36,645
- Then you dance like this. - Boom, boom.

1369
01:02:36,914 --> 01:02:38,954
- We have to divide this part. - Right.

1370
01:02:39,585 --> 01:02:42,855
They must know the dance moves.

1371
01:02:43,355 --> 01:02:44,684
KYUNGBAE knows the dance moves.

1372
01:02:45,824 --> 01:02:47,155
That's nice.

1373
01:02:48,795 --> 01:02:50,965
Then the move goes like this.

1374
01:02:51,164 --> 01:02:53,994
You go down and boom.

1375
01:02:54,664 --> 01:02:56,164
- Okay? - Okay.

1376
01:02:56,405 --> 01:02:58,404
- It's much easier this way. - I think we saved one hour.

1377
01:02:58,405 --> 01:03:00,105
No, we saved four hours thanks to him.

1378
01:03:00,335 --> 01:03:03,604
He knew the dance moves already.

1379
01:03:03,605 --> 01:03:05,145
So he taught the team very fast.

1380
01:03:05,244 --> 01:03:08,375
Their team is very strong.

1381
01:03:08,414 --> 01:03:09,545
I mean Team White.

1382
01:03:09,945 --> 01:03:12,465
The team consists of trainees with a high ranking, so I'm wary.

1383
01:03:12,985 --> 01:03:15,925
But our team is very competent too.

1384
01:03:17,155 --> 01:03:18,895
It's so much easier with JUNSEO.

1385
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,494
I can rely on him.

1386
01:03:20,925 --> 01:03:23,164
Right, he's very fast with this.

1387
01:03:24,224 --> 01:03:25,694
I'll copy the dance moves and teach you all at the same time.

1388
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:27,133
- Yes! - Nice.

1389
01:03:27,134 --> 01:03:28,164
Okay, verse one.

1390
01:03:28,534 --> 01:03:29,534
You have to go down.

1391
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:31,033
- We have to see the up and down. - Okay.

1392
01:03:31,034 --> 01:03:34,203
You move like this.

1393
01:03:34,204 --> 01:03:37,174
Then you lift yourself up like this.

1394
01:03:37,175 --> 01:03:38,914
Move your bodies.

1395
01:03:39,715 --> 01:03:42,744
JUNSEO is quick at copying dance moves.

1396
01:03:42,945 --> 01:03:46,054
SIHUN was working on the flow.

1397
01:03:46,315 --> 01:03:49,284
I could feel that we were on track.

1398
01:03:50,025 --> 01:03:51,383
- Are you following, SIU? - Yes.

1399
01:03:51,384 --> 01:03:53,654
You can ask JUNSEO if you have any questions.

1400
01:03:53,655 --> 01:03:54,695
Okay.

1401
01:03:55,094 --> 01:03:56,094
What?

1402
01:03:57,764 --> 01:04:00,763
- One, two, three, four. - One, two, three, four.

1403
01:04:00,764 --> 01:04:02,804
- Boom, boom. - Boom, boom.

1404
01:04:03,065 --> 01:04:06,134
Go left and come up.

1405
01:04:16,014 --> 01:04:18,645
All the skilled trainees are in our team.

1406
01:04:18,985 --> 01:04:20,755
I think our team will do well.

1407
01:04:21,715 --> 01:04:23,255
I want to win no matter what.

1408
01:04:24,985 --> 01:04:26,054
This is relaxing.

1409
01:04:27,724 --> 01:04:28,925
Let's start from the top.

1410
01:04:30,065 --> 01:04:33,335
(Team Black is repeating over and over again.)

1411
01:04:34,634 --> 01:04:36,335
(On the other hand...)

1412
01:04:37,034 --> 01:04:39,175
(Team White is very down.)

1413
01:04:40,235 --> 01:04:41,574
This is hard.

1414
01:04:42,175 --> 01:04:43,275
It is.

1415
01:04:50,645 --> 01:04:51,684
What do we do?

1416
01:04:53,755 --> 01:04:56,223
They were the only two rappers...

1417
01:04:56,224 --> 01:04:59,255
of the team from the start.

1418
01:05:00,094 --> 01:05:03,565
But for this song, four trainees have to rap.

1419
01:05:04,625 --> 01:05:05,964
HYUNWOO, whom I thought,

1420
01:05:05,965 --> 01:05:10,004
would be the perfect fit for the main singer of the song,

1421
01:05:10,005 --> 01:05:12,534
can't sing for now.

1422
01:05:12,905 --> 01:05:15,174
I was diagnosed with an early stage of vocal cord nodules.

1423
01:05:15,175 --> 01:05:17,203
So it's very upsetting.

1424
01:05:17,204 --> 01:05:20,645
I can't even control my voice right now.

1425
01:05:24,784 --> 01:05:26,485
So this is the biggest problem we have.

1426
01:05:26,614 --> 01:05:29,925
This part, "Feel the rock," shows up in the 1st and 2nd verses.

1427
01:05:29,954 --> 01:05:32,053
So two of us should be able to pull that off.

1428
01:05:32,054 --> 01:05:33,124
That's right.

1429
01:05:33,125 --> 01:05:34,524
In my opinion,

1430
01:05:34,525 --> 01:05:36,363
we should narrow down the members who can hit the high notes.

1431
01:05:36,364 --> 01:05:38,084
The members who can hit the vocal register.

1432
01:05:39,264 --> 01:05:40,494
Just feel

1433
01:05:41,735 --> 01:05:42,905
We let it

1434
01:05:43,204 --> 01:05:44,264
We let

1435
01:05:44,934 --> 01:05:47,434
- Just feel - Feel

1436
01:05:47,534 --> 01:05:48,675
What about you, KYOUNGBAE?

1437
01:05:49,344 --> 01:05:51,144
- I can't even sing the first part. - Really?

1438
01:05:53,215 --> 01:05:54,215
What do we do?

1439
01:05:59,215 --> 01:06:01,884
Things were going smoothly for Team "CASE 143."

1440
01:06:03,925 --> 01:06:07,395
(They're done going over the choreography formation.)

1441
01:06:09,494 --> 01:06:11,993
A case takes place, an unforgettable case

1442
01:06:11,994 --> 01:06:13,194
You're completely hooked

1443
01:06:13,195 --> 01:06:14,394
- On my irresistible charms - He's singing it live.

1444
01:06:14,395 --> 01:06:15,605
You keep provoking

1445
01:06:17,264 --> 01:06:20,004
They were 1 or 2 steps...

1446
01:06:20,005 --> 01:06:22,375
ahead of our team.

1447
01:06:22,744 --> 01:06:24,875
They seemed really good.

1448
01:06:25,105 --> 01:06:27,375
So I'm very nervous.

1449
01:06:27,614 --> 01:06:31,683
I could sense that the other team was checking us out...

1450
01:06:31,684 --> 01:06:34,553
because we were moving so fast with our progress.

1451
01:06:34,554 --> 01:06:37,925
So they must have felt a sense of urgency.

1452
01:06:38,954 --> 01:06:40,355
I'm going to let you go

1453
01:06:40,724 --> 01:06:42,125
(Glancing over)

1454
01:06:45,025 --> 01:06:46,965
I couldn't stop looking at them.

1455
01:06:48,735 --> 01:06:51,615
Things were moving quickly for them. They seem to be getting along well.

1456
01:06:52,375 --> 01:06:53,605
My face is getting hot.

1457
01:06:55,434 --> 01:06:58,105
In a way, the members on Team Black weren't wanted by us.

1458
01:06:58,474 --> 01:07:01,844
They weren't chosen, but they were doing so well.

1459
01:07:02,215 --> 01:07:05,045
So I feel a bit intimidated by their progress and all.

1460
01:07:06,054 --> 01:07:08,014
Once KYOUNGBAE steps away...

1461
01:07:08,985 --> 01:07:10,884
So you have to step out to...

1462
01:07:11,125 --> 01:07:12,453
Didn't we say I would go left?

1463
01:07:12,454 --> 01:07:13,654
No? Was it right?

1464
01:07:13,655 --> 01:07:15,495
There was a direction you had to step away to.

1465
01:07:16,195 --> 01:07:17,955
I think you step away to a close spot first.

1466
01:07:18,594 --> 01:07:20,994
- The other team looks so miserable. - Right.

1467
01:07:21,065 --> 01:07:23,335
Why can't they make any progress?

1468
01:07:23,465 --> 01:07:27,105
The speed of their progress was slow.

1469
01:07:27,375 --> 01:07:29,605
So unexpectedly,

1470
01:07:30,275 --> 01:07:31,803
in my opinion,

1471
01:07:31,804 --> 01:07:35,645
I'm a bit nervous for the team MINWOOK put together.

1472
01:07:36,384 --> 01:07:38,113
I thought, "Okay. Let's focus."

1473
01:07:38,114 --> 01:07:39,613
"I might be able to win first place."

1474
01:07:39,614 --> 01:07:41,114
That thought crossed my mind.

1475
01:07:45,994 --> 01:07:48,394
When I was watching them, I thought, "Gosh, they're good."

1476
01:07:48,395 --> 01:07:52,264
"Their teamwork is great." That's what I thought.

1477
01:07:53,195 --> 01:07:55,464
It seemed that they finished the majority of their performance...

1478
01:07:55,465 --> 01:07:58,033
within a short period of time. So I was surprised by that.

1479
01:07:58,034 --> 01:08:01,235
I sensed that our team might be in trouble.

1480
01:08:02,344 --> 01:08:04,073
(Things seem very different for these two teams.)

1481
01:08:04,074 --> 01:08:05,815
(What will happen to them?)

1482
01:08:06,415 --> 01:08:08,343
It's an honour to be on the same team as you.

1483
01:08:08,344 --> 01:08:10,083
It's an honour to be on the same team.

1484
01:08:10,084 --> 01:08:11,745
- Yes! - Thank you for choosing me.

1485
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:14,713
- I love our team. - Me too.

1486
01:08:14,714 --> 01:08:16,025
This is going to be fun.

1487
01:08:16,724 --> 01:08:18,655
Well, let's pick the leader for our team.

1488
01:08:19,455 --> 01:08:21,423
Shall we?

1489
01:08:21,424 --> 01:08:22,695
(Staring)

1490
01:08:23,025 --> 01:08:25,345
Is there anyone you would like to recommend as the leader?

1491
01:08:27,565 --> 01:08:28,634
YICHEN.

1492
01:08:29,065 --> 01:08:30,165
I second it.

1493
01:08:31,504 --> 01:08:33,373
He can speak English.

1494
01:08:33,374 --> 01:08:34,634
Don't say that.

1495
01:08:34,974 --> 01:08:37,404
- He can speak Chinese too. - Please.

1496
01:08:37,405 --> 01:08:38,945
- Right. - He's a good communicator.

1497
01:08:39,075 --> 01:08:41,544
After hearing that, I decided...

1498
01:08:41,945 --> 01:08:43,044
to pick YICHEN.

1499
01:08:43,145 --> 01:08:45,145
But... Seriously.

1500
01:08:45,384 --> 01:08:47,454
- But you have to do it. - YICHEN. But...

1501
01:08:47,455 --> 01:08:48,914
- I'm really scared. - What do you think?

1502
01:08:48,915 --> 01:08:50,184
Why?

1503
01:08:51,084 --> 01:08:53,124
(Trainee YICHEN was the leader of Team P5.)

1504
01:08:53,794 --> 01:08:55,594
(If that's how you're going to be, leave.)

1505
01:08:56,294 --> 01:08:58,324
(His scary leadership shocked P5.)

1506
01:08:58,325 --> 01:09:01,164
A lot of people said that my method was wrong.

1507
01:09:01,165 --> 01:09:03,333
So I don't want to do anything...

1508
01:09:03,334 --> 01:09:05,504
even remotely similar to being a leader.

1509
01:09:06,004 --> 01:09:09,775
But I'm not sure about this.

1510
01:09:09,945 --> 01:09:12,105
I mean, I took on this role before.

1511
01:09:12,645 --> 01:09:14,974
I did, but I didn't do a good job.

1512
01:09:15,415 --> 01:09:16,615
I see.

1513
01:09:17,415 --> 01:09:19,154
Personally, I think...

1514
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:20,954
YICHEN needs a second chance to redeem himself.

1515
01:09:20,955 --> 01:09:22,784
"Come in!"

1516
01:09:22,785 --> 01:09:24,553
- "Come in. Don't leave. Come!" - "Come in."

1517
01:09:24,554 --> 01:09:25,894
- "Guys, come in." - "Guys, come here."

1518
01:09:25,895 --> 01:09:27,855
- "Come in right now." - "Come in."

1519
01:09:28,124 --> 01:09:29,924
With your help,

1520
01:09:30,794 --> 01:09:33,064
I'll be able to do my best.

1521
01:09:33,065 --> 01:09:34,365
- My gosh. - Okay.

1522
01:09:34,934 --> 01:09:36,404
- Are you sure about this? - My gosh.

1523
01:09:36,405 --> 01:09:38,164
Are you sure about this?

1524
01:09:38,165 --> 01:09:41,274
I've never felt this much pressure in my life.

1525
01:09:41,275 --> 01:09:43,275
Gosh, no. No need to feel any pressure.

1526
01:09:43,344 --> 01:09:46,673
- YICHEN is our leader now. - Yes!

1527
01:09:46,674 --> 01:09:47,745
Yes!

1528
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:49,883
Are you sure about this?

1529
01:09:49,884 --> 01:09:51,414
- We're so sure. - Gosh.

1530
01:09:51,415 --> 01:09:52,455
- Really? - Yes.

1531
01:09:52,485 --> 01:09:54,154
We have to pick the member for the center position...

1532
01:09:54,155 --> 01:09:55,931
- We must pick the leader too. - And the leader too.

1533
01:09:55,955 --> 01:09:57,124
Shall we begin?

1534
01:09:57,825 --> 01:09:59,585
Is there anyone you would like to recommend?

1535
01:09:59,995 --> 01:10:02,565
I think YANGWOO will be a good leader.

1536
01:10:02,794 --> 01:10:04,314
- So you recommend YANGWOO. - YANGWOO.

1537
01:10:04,624 --> 01:10:06,133
Is there anyone other than YANGWOO...

1538
01:10:06,134 --> 01:10:08,294
who wants to be the leader?

1539
01:10:08,434 --> 01:10:09,634
What about you?

1540
01:10:10,065 --> 01:10:11,104
(Not at all)

1541
01:10:11,105 --> 01:10:12,164
- No one? - No one.

1542
01:10:12,165 --> 01:10:13,374
- No one? - What about you?

1543
01:10:13,605 --> 01:10:15,504
(Turning away)

1544
01:10:15,844 --> 01:10:17,780
- Then is everyone in agreement? - Do you guys agree?

1545
01:10:17,804 --> 01:10:19,004
- Yes. - Yes.

1546
01:10:19,275 --> 01:10:22,114
- Okay. Our leader is YANGWOO. - Thank you.

1547
01:10:22,115 --> 01:10:24,285
(The leader of Team "TOUCH" is KWON YANGWOO.)

1548
01:10:24,844 --> 01:10:26,364
I never thought I would be the leader.

1549
01:10:26,455 --> 01:10:28,184
- Smile. - Smile.

1550
01:10:28,785 --> 01:10:30,184
- Ta-da. - Great.

1551
01:10:30,424 --> 01:10:32,384
- Thank you. - He's the future of our team.

1552
01:10:32,495 --> 01:10:33,495
I am?

1553
01:10:33,624 --> 01:10:36,494
Actually, I kept trying out to be the leader...

1554
01:10:36,495 --> 01:10:39,395
when I was on P5 and Team "Kiwi." But I never had a chance to do it.

1555
01:10:39,464 --> 01:10:41,064
But this time, I'm the leader.

1556
01:10:41,065 --> 01:10:43,333
With this importance sense of responsibility,

1557
01:10:43,334 --> 01:10:44,665
I'm going to do my best.

1558
01:10:45,365 --> 01:10:46,574
(The teammates of P5 became...)

1559
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:48,135
(the leaders of Teams Black and White.)

1560
01:10:51,344 --> 01:10:54,044
(Whistling)

1561
01:10:58,884 --> 01:11:01,285
(Raising the volume)

1562
01:11:04,184 --> 01:11:07,054
(Touching the eardrums of Team "Make A Wish" with music)

1563
01:11:07,195 --> 01:11:09,564
I'm the leader, and so is YICHEN.

1564
01:11:09,565 --> 01:11:11,025
So I feel a bit competitive...

1565
01:11:11,264 --> 01:11:13,094
because when we were on Team P5,

1566
01:11:13,294 --> 01:11:16,264
there was a conflict between me and YICHEN.

1567
01:11:16,705 --> 01:11:17,963
If I become the leader...

1568
01:11:17,964 --> 01:11:21,833
(KWON YANGWOO volunteered to be the leader of Team P5.)

1569
01:11:21,834 --> 01:11:24,344
(YICHEN also volunteered to be the leader.)

1570
01:11:25,075 --> 01:11:26,115
The result is...

1571
01:11:26,915 --> 01:11:30,814
(Trainee YICHEN won the vote in the end.)

1572
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:32,915
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

1573
01:11:33,514 --> 01:11:35,985
(He had no choice but to step back.)

1574
01:11:38,054 --> 01:11:42,495
(But YICHEN was stricter than expected.)

1575
01:11:43,025 --> 01:11:44,025
No.

1576
01:11:44,065 --> 01:11:47,294
How should I put it? His training method didn't suit me.

1577
01:11:47,995 --> 01:11:51,705
(The two trainees had different approaches.)

1578
01:11:52,634 --> 01:11:55,173
(They weren't able to bridge differences about training styles.)

1579
01:11:55,174 --> 01:11:57,043
But we were assembled into the same slot again.

1580
01:11:57,044 --> 01:11:59,214
So I thought that I should really do a good job.

1581
01:11:59,615 --> 01:12:01,814
Please watch to see which one of us...

1582
01:12:01,815 --> 01:12:05,214
becomes the better leader and leads the team to victory.

1583
01:12:06,315 --> 01:12:09,383
I think that our song has a lot more wow factors...

1584
01:12:09,384 --> 01:12:11,154
than their song.

1585
01:12:11,155 --> 01:12:13,894
Considering the song and the performance,

1586
01:12:13,895 --> 01:12:17,065
I think we'll have a huge advantage.

1587
01:12:17,695 --> 01:12:19,994
And LYNNLYNN performed this song during the Zero Setting.

1588
01:12:19,995 --> 01:12:21,535
- He did. - He performed this song.

1589
01:12:22,264 --> 01:12:25,605
(He already mastered the song for the Zero Setting.)

1590
01:12:26,434 --> 01:12:27,904
I think things will move quickly...

1591
01:12:27,905 --> 01:12:29,604
- because he knows the choreography. - Yes.

1592
01:12:29,605 --> 01:12:31,074
- I can't wait to learn it. - Then...

1593
01:12:31,075 --> 01:12:32,173
- should we... - Don't you want to learn it?

1594
01:12:32,174 --> 01:12:34,414
Here's something we can consider for our future training as a team.

1595
01:12:34,415 --> 01:12:35,915
From what I've experienced so far,

1596
01:12:36,184 --> 01:12:39,013
there were disagreements and conflicts because people had...

1597
01:12:39,014 --> 01:12:41,384
their own ideas and approaches to how they should practice.

1598
01:12:41,684 --> 01:12:43,753
What do you think about...

1599
01:12:43,754 --> 01:12:44,954
going over our plan first...

1600
01:12:44,955 --> 01:12:46,475
- before we begin? - That sounds good.

1601
01:12:46,525 --> 01:12:49,025
What kind of training direction do you prefer?

1602
01:12:49,054 --> 01:12:51,495
My goodness. I don't have any preferences now.

1603
01:12:52,395 --> 01:12:54,195
You don't have any?

1604
01:12:54,294 --> 01:12:55,940
"If that's how you're going to practice, go home."

1605
01:12:55,964 --> 01:12:57,764
- "Leave." - "Leave."

1606
01:12:58,934 --> 01:13:01,704
I think I should listen to my team more.

1607
01:13:01,705 --> 01:13:04,844
First of all, it's important for us to perform well on stage.

1608
01:13:05,605 --> 01:13:09,315
But I used to think that the process to get there wasn't important.

1609
01:13:09,445 --> 01:13:13,054
This time, I'm going to pay attention to the process as well.

1610
01:13:13,384 --> 01:13:16,684
Then should we pick the member for the center position?

1611
01:13:16,985 --> 01:13:19,594
By the way, I can sort of...

1612
01:13:20,155 --> 01:13:21,723
get a picture for this.

1613
01:13:21,724 --> 01:13:22,794
Well,

1614
01:13:24,025 --> 01:13:27,165
not everyone might be happy about that.

1615
01:13:28,334 --> 01:13:32,974
(Previously, he assigned the parts unilaterally.)

1616
01:13:34,434 --> 01:13:36,905
I think we should vote.

1617
01:13:37,174 --> 01:13:40,544
The center position for Team "Make A Wish" is...

1618
01:13:40,775 --> 01:13:42,914
- JIWOON. - My gosh.

1619
01:13:42,915 --> 01:13:44,614
The main rapper for our team...

1620
01:13:44,615 --> 01:13:45,615
The main vocalist...

1621
01:13:45,616 --> 01:13:47,355
- The sub rapper one is... - The rapper...

1622
01:13:47,514 --> 01:13:49,855
The sub vocalist one is AHN JUNWON.

1623
01:13:50,054 --> 01:13:51,054
Are you happy with that?

1624
01:13:51,055 --> 01:13:52,655
- Yes, I am. - Really?

1625
01:13:52,924 --> 01:13:55,394
I know the beats here. So let me just go over them.

1626
01:13:55,395 --> 01:13:56,664
Okay. Sounds good.

1627
01:13:56,665 --> 01:13:58,395
(They practice the choreography next.)

1628
01:13:59,264 --> 01:14:00,865
Everyone is good. Nice.

1629
01:14:01,195 --> 01:14:02,833
Do it next time

1630
01:14:02,834 --> 01:14:04,804
(Bring in the energy!)

1631
01:14:05,434 --> 01:14:08,735
(His positive leadership seems to be working.)

1632
01:14:09,575 --> 01:14:11,043
Let's start from the top.

1633
01:14:11,044 --> 01:14:13,315
(Team "TOUCH" starts practising the song.)

1634
01:14:14,075 --> 01:14:16,543
I can feel you

1635
01:14:16,544 --> 01:14:19,084
In an instant

1636
01:14:20,184 --> 01:14:21,214
This one?

1637
01:14:21,884 --> 01:14:24,384
- It gets bigger - In an instant

1638
01:14:24,624 --> 01:14:26,155
Well, your pitch was completely off.

1639
01:14:29,724 --> 01:14:30,763
(Getting ready to rap)

1640
01:14:30,764 --> 01:14:31,865
Your voice

1641
01:14:34,365 --> 01:14:35,764
Let's try again.

1642
01:14:37,205 --> 01:14:39,374
- Stay - Stay

1643
01:14:39,634 --> 01:14:42,034
- You and me just like this - You and me just like this

1644
01:14:42,035 --> 01:14:43,604
- Baby, touch me - Baby, touch me

1645
01:14:43,605 --> 01:14:46,415
- I can feel you - I can feel you

1646
01:14:46,714 --> 01:14:48,673
I wasn't sure whether or not...

1647
01:14:48,674 --> 01:14:51,315
we would improve even if we practised.

1648
01:14:51,485 --> 01:14:52,684
I'm worried.

1649
01:14:52,985 --> 01:14:54,513
When I saw Team White practising,

1650
01:14:54,514 --> 01:14:56,053
it seemed they made a lot of progress.

1651
01:14:56,054 --> 01:14:59,695
Because they were right next to us, I kept checking their progress.

1652
01:14:59,754 --> 01:15:01,623
"We should start fine-tuning our performance."

1653
01:15:01,624 --> 01:15:03,784
That crossed my mind because I felt insecure about us.

1654
01:15:03,895 --> 01:15:05,223
I can sense everything

1655
01:15:05,224 --> 01:15:07,463
You have to be louder for this part. I can't hear your voice at all.

1656
01:15:07,464 --> 01:15:08,495
Okay.

1657
01:15:09,504 --> 01:15:12,405
- Could you just sing this part? - Sing.

1658
01:15:12,565 --> 01:15:13,833
Stay

1659
01:15:13,834 --> 01:15:14,834
(Singing)

1660
01:15:14,835 --> 01:15:16,745
(You and me just like this)

1661
01:15:17,474 --> 01:15:20,174
What's this? That sounds weird. No.

1662
01:15:20,415 --> 01:15:21,843
It sounds really weird for some reason.

1663
01:15:21,844 --> 01:15:23,284
He's singing out of tune completely.

1664
01:15:25,544 --> 01:15:26,785
We have a problem.

1665
01:15:27,584 --> 01:15:30,724
(His aggressive tone reminds of someone.)

1666
01:15:31,025 --> 01:15:32,230
It sounds really weird for some reason.

1667
01:15:32,254 --> 01:15:33,895
(Taken aback)

1668
01:15:37,195 --> 01:15:39,463
Let's take a five-minute break and work hard again.

1669
01:15:39,464 --> 01:15:41,594
Why are you so tough on us?

1670
01:15:41,865 --> 01:15:44,105
We'll keep practising until we don't make any mistakes.

1671
01:15:44,964 --> 01:15:47,245
We must keep practising until we don't make any mistakes.

1672
01:15:47,304 --> 01:15:48,304
We'll keep going.

1673
01:15:50,275 --> 01:15:51,705
Our leader...

1674
01:15:51,844 --> 01:15:56,514
stresses me out. Yes.

1675
01:15:56,785 --> 01:16:01,114
I think YANGWOO has a tendency to speak harshly.

1676
01:16:01,115 --> 01:16:02,254
Because of his behaviours,

1677
01:16:03,054 --> 01:16:05,883
other trainees couldn't speak up when they had something to say.

1678
01:16:05,884 --> 01:16:08,424
So that bothers me a bit.

1679
01:16:10,195 --> 01:16:13,664
(Two different atmospheres were shaped by the leaders.)

1680
01:16:13,665 --> 01:16:16,804
(How will this affect the match?)

1681
01:16:17,464 --> 01:16:20,075
- Let's name our team. - I think that's a good idea.

1682
01:16:20,575 --> 01:16:22,075
Does anyone have a good idea?

1683
01:16:28,014 --> 01:16:30,514
Our average ranking was quite low compared to other teams'.

1684
01:16:31,945 --> 01:16:33,554
To be completely honest,

1685
01:16:34,684 --> 01:16:38,254
I wouldn't confidently think that I'd be 1 of the 35 trainees.

1686
01:16:39,794 --> 01:16:41,294
Trainee JEONG DEUNHAESOL.

1687
01:16:41,724 --> 01:16:43,724
Then which team do you think...

1688
01:16:44,264 --> 01:16:45,464
is the weakest among here?

1689
01:16:47,895 --> 01:16:51,834
(The weakest team he chose was Team A5.)

1690
01:16:52,105 --> 01:16:53,674
Team A5. They're right next to you.

1691
01:16:54,334 --> 01:16:57,674
(They were chosen the weakest team in front of everyone.)

1692
01:16:57,844 --> 01:16:58,905
No!

1693
01:16:59,344 --> 01:17:03,785
(A5 is chosen as the weakest by many trainees.)

1694
01:17:04,485 --> 01:17:05,584
How about Any Day?

1695
01:17:06,384 --> 01:17:08,355
- It could be any day now. - You have no filter.

1696
01:17:13,224 --> 01:17:15,395
Honestly, I thought,

1697
01:17:15,855 --> 01:17:18,895
"What is this? Is this Team Trash?" That crossed my mind too.

1698
01:17:19,695 --> 01:17:21,164
Let's listen to the song.

1699
01:17:21,165 --> 01:17:22,725
(Team "Deja Vu" is right next to them.)

1700
01:17:22,905 --> 01:17:25,434
The name of our team could be Bye Passing Ceremony.

1701
01:17:26,474 --> 01:17:28,634
- Bye Passing Ceremony. - Kids You'll Never See Again.

1702
01:17:30,544 --> 01:17:33,614
Everyone's ranking was close to mine.

1703
01:17:33,615 --> 01:17:34,950
"Is this the bottom-ranking team again?"

1704
01:17:34,974 --> 01:17:36,785
I've been on the bottom teams so far.

1705
01:17:37,684 --> 01:17:39,514
"How am I going to survive here?"

1706
01:17:41,285 --> 01:17:44,955
YEUNG in 70th place was assembled in A5.

1707
01:17:45,184 --> 01:17:48,394
His team didn't have any trainee that had...

1708
01:17:48,395 --> 01:17:49,665
a high ranking.

1709
01:17:50,294 --> 01:17:53,464
"We'll prove to you that we're not the weakest team."

1710
01:17:54,365 --> 01:17:56,504
It made me wonder if we were in any position...

1711
01:17:57,134 --> 01:17:58,254
to say that with confidence.

1712
01:17:59,004 --> 01:18:00,974
To be honest, I have no idea where we stand.

1713
01:18:02,735 --> 01:18:04,374
JIMIN.

1714
01:18:04,804 --> 01:18:06,043
Let's work on that.

1715
01:18:06,044 --> 01:18:07,921
(Leader CHO HYOJIN wants to create the formation for the dance break.)

1716
01:18:07,945 --> 01:18:09,784
The rest of you should learn the choreography.

1717
01:18:09,785 --> 01:18:10,785
Okay.

1718
01:18:11,915 --> 01:18:13,213
After that...

1719
01:18:13,214 --> 01:18:14,891
(They work on the formation while the rest practice on their own.)

1720
01:18:14,915 --> 01:18:16,114
We can come up with this part.

1721
01:18:16,115 --> 01:18:18,554
(But only a few trainees are learning the choreography.)

1722
01:18:24,995 --> 01:18:26,094
Let's practice!

1723
01:18:29,605 --> 01:18:32,803
Overall, it felt like we weren't working as a team.

1724
01:18:32,804 --> 01:18:35,004
That's the atmosphere of our team.

1725
01:18:35,705 --> 01:18:38,205
We're not encouraging each other to practice and so on.

1726
01:18:38,445 --> 01:18:39,714
"I see. He's practising."

1727
01:18:40,974 --> 01:18:43,245
"I guess we're eating now." "Okay. We'll rest."

1728
01:18:44,115 --> 01:18:45,915
There's no driving force.

1729
01:18:46,285 --> 01:18:48,785
Let's focus a little more and memorize the details.

1730
01:18:51,355 --> 01:18:53,924
(Struggling)

1731
01:18:56,525 --> 01:18:58,724
Move in a bit. The audience should see you between us.

1732
01:19:00,794 --> 01:19:04,034
- We are meant to be, even if - We are meant to be, even if

1733
01:19:04,035 --> 01:19:05,463
This is supposed to be a cheerful and lively song.

1734
01:19:05,464 --> 01:19:06,984
But looking at our facial expressions,

1735
01:19:07,304 --> 01:19:10,504
it's like we're performing MONSTA X's song.

1736
01:19:11,374 --> 01:19:12,803
We looked so glum.

1737
01:19:12,804 --> 01:19:14,364
It didn't look like we were having fun.

1738
01:19:17,084 --> 01:19:18,084
Here's the thing.

1739
01:19:19,315 --> 01:19:21,391
I've been observing you guys during our practice today.

1740
01:19:21,415 --> 01:19:22,814
When I was coming up with the dance break...

1741
01:19:22,815 --> 01:19:24,224
and learning the choreography,

1742
01:19:24,584 --> 01:19:26,825
I didn't tell you to rest. That's a fact.

1743
01:19:27,025 --> 01:19:28,253
If you were confident you wouldn't make any mistakes,

1744
01:19:28,254 --> 01:19:29,525
taking a break would be fine.

1745
01:19:29,624 --> 01:19:31,963
But it would be wrong to take a break...

1746
01:19:31,964 --> 01:19:33,495
when you kept making mistakes.

1747
01:19:34,094 --> 01:19:37,264
As for today's practice, if I'm being completely honest,

1748
01:19:37,434 --> 01:19:39,065
you guys didn't work hard enough.

1749
01:19:39,334 --> 01:19:42,873
I think we'll have to practice a lot to make sure we won't make...

1750
01:19:42,874 --> 01:19:44,344
the same mistakes.

1751
01:19:45,504 --> 01:19:47,144
It'd be great to be 1 of the 35 trainees.

1752
01:19:47,245 --> 01:19:49,844
But there's a higher chance that I would be eliminated.

1753
01:19:49,884 --> 01:19:51,384
So I was insecure.

1754
01:19:52,384 --> 01:19:54,213
Not practising when we keep making the same mistakes...

1755
01:19:54,214 --> 01:19:55,214
is a bigger problem.

1756
01:19:55,754 --> 01:19:57,124
Let's work hard.

1757
01:19:57,825 --> 01:20:00,554
(Meanwhile, Team Black is also working on the choreography.)

1758
01:20:01,254 --> 01:20:04,524
Is this the tempo? Three, four, and five?

1759
01:20:04,525 --> 01:20:05,525
Yes, that's it.

1760
01:20:05,526 --> 01:20:07,433
You're my future

1761
01:20:07,434 --> 01:20:09,041
(They work on the choreography as these two trainees lead.)

1762
01:20:09,065 --> 01:20:11,905
(WU CHENYU in 51st place, LEE JIHOON in 66th place)

1763
01:20:12,434 --> 01:20:14,804
(While the other members quickly learn the choreography...)

1764
01:20:15,304 --> 01:20:17,674
Say it

1765
01:20:18,275 --> 01:20:19,713
Say it

1766
01:20:19,714 --> 01:20:21,174
(JUNG SEUNGWON in 57th place)

1767
01:20:21,344 --> 01:20:22,744
One, two.

1768
01:20:22,745 --> 01:20:24,314
So your feet are here now. Right?

1769
01:20:24,315 --> 01:20:25,315
- Kick them together. - You have to kick together.

1770
01:20:25,315 --> 01:20:26,315
Together.

1771
01:20:27,785 --> 01:20:28,815
- One. - One.

1772
01:20:29,785 --> 01:20:30,824
Two.

1773
01:20:30,825 --> 01:20:31,883
(They slow down to match JUNG SEUNGWON's pace.)

1774
01:20:31,884 --> 01:20:32,955
Three.

1775
01:20:33,794 --> 01:20:34,995
To the same direction.

1776
01:20:38,594 --> 01:20:40,394
- To the same direction. - To the same direction?

1777
01:20:40,395 --> 01:20:41,865
Yes, the same direction.

1778
01:20:42,594 --> 01:20:44,704
(A while ago, they introduced themselves.)

1779
01:20:44,705 --> 01:20:46,803
I had never taken proper vocal or dance lessons.

1780
01:20:46,804 --> 01:20:48,105
My name is JUNG SEUNGWON.

1781
01:20:48,205 --> 01:20:50,020
- JUNG SEUNGWON. - I hope we can work well together.

1782
01:20:50,044 --> 01:20:52,605
- Let's work hard. - Hello.

1783
01:20:52,945 --> 01:20:55,615
He said he had never danced before.

1784
01:20:55,945 --> 01:20:58,814
His skills to memorize the choreography and execute it...

1785
01:20:58,815 --> 01:21:00,115
are quite lacking.

1786
01:21:00,455 --> 01:21:02,154
Having 1 or 2 bad dancers in the team of 14 members...

1787
01:21:02,155 --> 01:21:03,484
wasn't a huge problem.

1788
01:21:03,485 --> 01:21:05,324
But having 1 bad dancer when there are only 7 of us...

1789
01:21:05,325 --> 01:21:07,195
would make us look pretty bad.

1790
01:21:07,495 --> 01:21:09,094
So I'm very worried.

1791
01:21:10,025 --> 01:21:12,793
You have to keep dancing while you move to the side.

1792
01:21:12,794 --> 01:21:13,794
- That's fine. - Okay.

1793
01:21:13,795 --> 01:21:15,034
Step back like this.

1794
01:21:15,035 --> 01:21:17,105
- Step back? - Oh, no. We're in big trouble.

1795
01:21:17,205 --> 01:21:19,303
- You're in the back. - You can do it, SEUNGWON.

1796
01:21:19,304 --> 01:21:20,333
Did you memorize the moves for the chorus?

1797
01:21:20,334 --> 01:21:21,373
No, not yet.

1798
01:21:21,374 --> 01:21:23,043
- Not yet? - But you guys are moving on.

1799
01:21:23,044 --> 01:21:24,644
- So I thought I should learn it. - Right. I see.

1800
01:21:24,645 --> 01:21:25,803
- I'll teach him separately. - That's...

1801
01:21:25,804 --> 01:21:26,973
- You teach the rest. - Okay.

1802
01:21:26,974 --> 01:21:28,213
- I'll teach you. - I see.

1803
01:21:28,214 --> 01:21:29,761
(In the end, they'll divide into two groups and practice.)

1804
01:21:29,785 --> 01:21:30,843
We were initially trying...

1805
01:21:30,844 --> 01:21:32,315
- to work on the details. - Yes.

1806
01:21:33,415 --> 01:21:35,155
I was really frustrated at myself.

1807
01:21:35,214 --> 01:21:37,723
I couldn't understand the tempo of this song.

1808
01:21:37,724 --> 01:21:39,764
It was physically challenging to keep up with them.

1809
01:21:39,955 --> 01:21:42,124
Because of me, they had to slow down.

1810
01:21:42,325 --> 01:21:43,495
I felt bad.

1811
01:21:44,525 --> 01:21:45,664
This is it.

1812
01:21:45,665 --> 01:21:46,793
Seven, eight.

1813
01:21:46,794 --> 01:21:48,770
(They continue to practice as his heart feels heavy.)

1814
01:21:48,794 --> 01:21:51,565
(It's time for the interim evaluation now.)

1815
01:21:51,865 --> 01:21:52,865
How did the practice go?

1816
01:21:53,105 --> 01:21:54,304
- We did our best. - Yes.

1817
01:21:55,235 --> 01:21:58,205
- Okay. Let's start with Team White. - Okay.

1818
01:21:58,245 --> 01:21:59,245
- Okay. - Okay.

1819
01:21:59,945 --> 01:22:03,344
(Will they be able to perform well for the interim evaluation?)

1820
01:22:11,224 --> 01:22:14,825
(Stone-faced trainees)

1821
01:22:30,745 --> 01:22:33,314
They seemed pretty down during the performance.

1822
01:22:33,315 --> 01:22:35,814
Given their energy, tomorrow won't come.

1823
01:22:35,815 --> 01:22:36,844
That's what I thought.

1824
01:22:41,285 --> 01:22:44,485
(Trainee KANG JIMIN fails to continue the choreography.)

1825
01:22:47,325 --> 01:22:51,594
(They only perform the 1st verse for the interim evaluation.)

1826
01:22:54,065 --> 01:22:55,165
Did you guys fight?

1827
01:22:56,905 --> 01:22:58,964
Did you guys fight? Leader.

1828
01:22:59,334 --> 01:23:03,745
I think there are problems that haven't surfaced up yet.

1829
01:23:04,974 --> 01:23:07,444
Even so, when you perform,

1830
01:23:07,445 --> 01:23:09,714
you're not supposed to make it obvious to us too.

1831
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:12,444
You were performing for us. Got it?

1832
01:23:12,445 --> 01:23:13,684
This isn't some talent show.

1833
01:23:14,554 --> 01:23:15,954
I know you can do better.

1834
01:23:15,955 --> 01:23:17,354
But why are you doing half-hearted jobs?

1835
01:23:17,355 --> 01:23:18,754
You just want to stop practising.

1836
01:23:19,184 --> 01:23:22,594
If that's your attitude, you guys can just stop and go home.

1837
01:23:24,594 --> 01:23:26,695
You can't be on this show if that's your mindset.

1838
01:23:27,934 --> 01:23:29,065
- Got it? - Yes.

1839
01:23:29,365 --> 01:23:31,804
I want you to treat this as your last chance.

1840
01:23:33,374 --> 01:23:36,645
(Team Black performs right afterward for the interim evaluation.)

1841
01:23:45,915 --> 01:23:47,254
(He messes up the choreography.)

1842
01:23:53,825 --> 01:23:55,455
(He messes up the lyrics.)

1843
01:24:11,645 --> 01:24:14,043
CHENYU is a great singer.

1844
01:24:14,044 --> 01:24:16,214
To be honest, I feel quite threatened by him.

1845
01:24:31,294 --> 01:24:32,694
- That's okay. - You guys did well.

1846
01:24:32,924 --> 01:24:34,463
- WANGSEOK. - Yes.

1847
01:24:34,464 --> 01:24:36,494
You're always cool. I can see you're working hard.

1848
01:24:36,495 --> 01:24:37,804
- Thank you. - You know?

1849
01:24:38,464 --> 01:24:39,804
CHENYU, you're doing well too.

1850
01:24:40,134 --> 01:24:41,304
Thank you.

1851
01:24:41,735 --> 01:24:43,674
- Thank you. - SEUNGWON is the problem here.

1852
01:24:45,945 --> 01:24:49,514
SEUNGWON. Why did you mumble the lyrics?

1853
01:24:50,145 --> 01:24:52,315
- What? Didn't you practice? - No.

1854
01:24:52,544 --> 01:24:54,013
You don't even have a lot of parts.

1855
01:24:54,014 --> 01:24:56,254
- You couldn't memorize that? - You're wasting the part.

1856
01:24:56,415 --> 01:24:58,183
You can't perform like that. I mean it.

1857
01:24:58,184 --> 01:25:00,624
You're ruining the performance for the other guys.

1858
01:25:01,054 --> 01:25:03,200
You lowered the quality of the performance significantly.

1859
01:25:03,224 --> 01:25:04,423
You guys should climb up.

1860
01:25:04,424 --> 01:25:06,394
From what I know, you guys are the bottom team.

1861
01:25:06,395 --> 01:25:08,835
You guys barely made the cut. You were the last ones to pass.

1862
01:25:09,334 --> 01:25:11,763
Look at your rankings. You are so close to getting cut.

1863
01:25:11,764 --> 01:25:13,065
You guys need to survive.

1864
01:25:13,834 --> 01:25:16,535
The damage could be worse when those in the corner bite.

1865
01:25:16,705 --> 01:25:17,705
Isn't that right?

1866
01:25:17,706 --> 01:25:18,881
- You're right. - You're right.

1867
01:25:18,905 --> 01:25:21,713
- You all need to wake up. - Okay.

1868
01:25:21,714 --> 01:25:23,583
I was worried...

1869
01:25:23,584 --> 01:25:25,985
to be in the low rank among 70 people.

1870
01:25:26,044 --> 01:25:30,084
I definitely felt anxious and worried.

1871
01:25:30,224 --> 01:25:32,485
They say that all of us will get eliminated.

1872
01:25:32,525 --> 01:25:34,894
No one shows it, but we all want to survive...

1873
01:25:34,895 --> 01:25:36,155
no matter how hard it is.

1874
01:25:37,264 --> 01:25:38,395
Everyone.

1875
01:25:39,594 --> 01:25:40,735
I will explain...

1876
01:25:41,134 --> 01:25:44,165
about the benefit points for the winning team.

1877
01:25:45,865 --> 01:25:46,974
This time,

1878
01:25:48,334 --> 01:25:50,473
it's taking away benefit points.

1879
01:25:50,474 --> 01:25:52,404
(Taking away benefit points)

1880
01:25:52,405 --> 01:25:53,674
Take away benefit points?

1881
01:25:54,474 --> 01:25:56,013
It's taking away benefit points.

1882
01:25:56,014 --> 01:25:58,414
(The announcement was made to the other team as well.)

1883
01:25:58,415 --> 01:26:00,155
- Taking away? - We have to take them away?

1884
01:26:01,584 --> 01:26:04,655
(World Assemblers' on-site voting on the day of Rival Matching)

1885
01:26:05,124 --> 01:26:09,195
(Teams and individuals were graded based on the votes.)

1886
01:26:09,224 --> 01:26:12,264
The one who placed last in the losing team...

1887
01:26:12,594 --> 01:26:14,394
will take away 70,000 points from the winner.

1888
01:26:15,764 --> 01:26:17,333
(Transferring a maximum of 70,000 and a minimum of 10,000 points)

1889
01:26:17,334 --> 01:26:18,565
Seventy thousand points?

1890
01:26:18,705 --> 01:26:21,804
Benefit points will be taken according to your ranking.

1891
01:26:22,804 --> 01:26:25,445
It means that we could lose points.

1892
01:26:25,474 --> 01:26:27,274
Right, the other team will take them from us.

1893
01:26:27,275 --> 01:26:28,673
(Winning Team plus 60,000 points, Losing Team minus 60,000 points)

1894
01:26:28,674 --> 01:26:30,013
(Winning Team plus 50,000 points, Losing Team minus 50,000 points)

1895
01:26:30,014 --> 01:26:31,444
(Winning Team plus 30,000 points, Losing Team minus 30,000 points)

1896
01:26:31,445 --> 01:26:32,860
(Winning Team plus 10,000 points, Losing Team minus 10,000 points)

1897
01:26:32,884 --> 01:26:35,284
Remember that whether you survive or not...

1898
01:26:35,285 --> 01:26:38,254
will depend on your victory of Rival Matching.

1899
01:26:38,424 --> 01:26:40,223
For some, it'll be a crisis.

1900
01:26:40,224 --> 01:26:44,293
For others, it'll be a real opportunity.

1901
01:26:44,294 --> 01:26:47,794
I hope you'll obtain either crisis or opportunity.

1902
01:26:48,035 --> 01:26:49,134
- Okay. - Okay.

1903
01:26:49,294 --> 01:26:50,665
If we lose, it will be over.

1904
01:26:51,665 --> 01:26:52,834
I want to take them away.

1905
01:26:53,405 --> 01:26:55,535
Actually, it made me feel more confident.

1906
01:26:55,674 --> 01:26:57,204
It sounds like a big advantage...

1907
01:26:57,205 --> 01:26:59,304
for those in the low rank.

1908
01:26:59,504 --> 01:27:01,473
Those in the high rank were competing,

1909
01:27:01,474 --> 01:27:03,144
and we in the low rank were competing.

1910
01:27:03,145 --> 01:27:05,144
If people come down, and we go up,

1911
01:27:05,145 --> 01:27:08,785
I could be 1 of the Top 35.

1912
01:27:08,985 --> 01:27:11,583
If our team wins, and I place first,

1913
01:27:11,584 --> 01:27:14,655
I could definitely be 1 of the top 35.

1914
01:27:14,895 --> 01:27:18,764
I've seen on many survival shows,

1915
01:27:18,895 --> 01:27:21,865
but this is the cruellest mission in the history of survival shows.

1916
01:27:22,134 --> 01:27:25,133
During the last Passing Ceremony,

1917
01:27:25,134 --> 01:27:28,205
I realized how important benefit points were.

1918
01:27:28,575 --> 01:27:31,373
If 70,000 points can be taken away,

1919
01:27:31,374 --> 01:27:32,974
it could be very dangerous.

1920
01:27:33,004 --> 01:27:36,274
"If you win this, you'll definitely go up."

1921
01:27:36,275 --> 01:27:38,583
"If not, you'll definitely get eliminated."

1922
01:27:38,584 --> 01:27:41,915
That was the gist of this mission.

1923
01:27:42,054 --> 01:27:43,284
I'll win no matter what.

1924
01:27:43,285 --> 01:27:45,325
I believe that it's an opportunity for me.

1925
01:27:45,384 --> 01:27:47,355
I expect the competition...

1926
01:27:47,424 --> 01:27:49,855
to be extremely intense.

1927
01:27:50,124 --> 01:27:53,224
However much the benefit points may be,

1928
01:27:53,294 --> 01:27:56,434
I must win them no matter what.

1929
01:27:56,634 --> 01:27:59,235
(Take them away, )

1930
01:27:59,434 --> 01:28:01,674
(or be taken away)

1931
01:28:02,075 --> 01:28:06,004

for being with the PROJECT 7 trainees on their way...

1987
01:30:43,934 --> 01:30:45,304

It's starting now.

2002
01:31:28,014 --> 01:31:31,044
First of all, I'm in 56th place.

2003
01:31:31,344 --> 01:31:33,245
If my ranking doesn't change,

2004
01:31:33,344 --> 01:31:35,714
my chance of getting eliminated will be greater.

2005
01:31:36,184 --> 01:31:38,183

2006
01:31:38,184 --> 01:31:40,184

"Will I be able to do well?"

2009
01:31:45,294 --> 01:31:47,094

During the last Passing Ceremony,

2011
01:31:51,665 --> 01:31:54,874
teams of 14 that you've assembled were announced.

2012
01:31:55,405 --> 01:31:57,674
(5 assemblies were made by World Assemblers.)

2013
01:31:57,775 --> 01:32:00,544

2014
01:32:08,254 --> 01:32:10,924
In the fourth project called Rival Matching,

2015
01:32:10,955 --> 01:32:12,855
fourteen trainees won't be on the same team.

2016
01:32:12,955 --> 01:32:14,924

2017
01:32:15,594 --> 01:32:18,964
(They'll compete in two teams.)

2018
01:32:19,365 --> 01:32:22,594
During Rival Matching, they'll perform two different songs.

2019
01:32:22,794 --> 01:32:24,104
With five groups,

2020
01:32:24,105 --> 01:32:27,034
there will be a total of ten performances.

2021

2022

That will be your first voting.

2027
01:32:44,285 --> 01:32:46,583
Next, in the team you picked,

2028
01:32:46,584 --> 01:32:48,494
choose one trainee.

2029
01:32:48,495 --> 01:32:50,565
That will be your second voting.

2030
01:32:51,424 --> 01:32:54,665

It's a group with a wide spectrum without limits.

2039

Also, it's a group with upgraded performing skills through assembly,

2040
01:33:25,165 --> 01:33:27,895
which is similar to PROJECT 7.

2041
01:33:28,434 --> 01:33:30,294

All right.

2111

You can do it.

2137
01:37:58,464 --> 01:38:00,504
(Both of them face a crisis at the same time.)

2138
01:38:01,535 --> 01:38:05,205
(Who will be the winner?)

2139
01:38:06,105 --> 01:38:07,105
You can do it.

2140
01:38:08,674 --> 01:38:10,745
(He lifted his feet first.)

2141
01:38:11,115 --> 01:38:12,384
My goodness.

2142
01:38:13,684 --> 01:38:15,184

I'm his manager.

2158
01:38:41,775 --> 01:38:43,015
It's a match between comedians.

2159
01:38:44,684 --> 01:38:47,044
What should I do?

2160
01:38:47,815 --> 01:38:48,854
(Laughing)

2161
01:38:48,855 --> 01:38:51,584
Nothing works out

Do it again.

2166

Did you know that JUNWON was in the Marines?

2167
01:39:08,174 --> 01:39:09,275
Salute!

It won't be easy.

2175

2176
01:39:25,624 --> 01:39:26,624
Get ready.

Set...

2178
01:39:29,195 --> 01:39:31,664
(It could be their last match.)

2179
01:39:31,665 --> 01:39:33,695
Go!

(Tapping here)

2181
01:39:45,775 --> 01:39:46,905
When will they attack?

2182
01:39:48,044 --> 01:39:54,514
(That's how their fight started.)

2183
01:39:55,884 --> 01:39:58,285
- They're making a choreography. - Right.

2184
01:39:58,485 --> 01:40:00,383
- Let's fight like men. - Okay.

2185
01:40:00,384 --> 01:40:01,424
One, two, three.

2186
01:40:01,554 --> 01:40:03,093
They're doing it at the same time.

(Facing each other like men)

2188

What are you doing?

2190
01:40:13,634 --> 01:40:14,634
Goodness.

2194

(Provoking)

2199
01:40:36,155 --> 01:40:37,624
He'll get eliminated.

2200
01:40:37,695 --> 01:40:38,825
Look at him.

2201
01:40:39,495 --> 01:40:41,394
Has HOU GUANYI always been like that?

2202
01:40:41,395 --> 01:40:43,594
- Has he been like that? - He's very positive.

2203
01:40:43,865 --> 01:40:46,264
- SOTA, make a sumo wrestler move. - Hurry up.

All right.

Don't lose.

2207
01:40:52,775 --> 01:40:55,315
SOTA, if you lose, you'll practice all night long.

2208

If you lose, you'll be the last one to shower.

2209

01:41:07,355 --> 01:41:08,525
Good job.

Oh, no.

That's cute.

2230

Gosh, TAEHWAN.

2231
01:41:49,365 --> 01:41:50,794
TAEHWAN, that didn't sound cool.

2232
01:41:52,035 --> 01:41:55,105
Trainee AHN JUNWON will respond to that.

2233
01:41:56,134 --> 01:41:58,105
I don't know about going easy.

2234
01:41:58,605 --> 01:42:00,044

Your team was formed...

but not voluntarily.

2257
01:42:46,485 --> 01:42:49,455
You were abandoned.

2258
01:42:49,924 --> 01:42:52,525
We weren't abandoned. We were left behind.

01:42:53,165 --> 01:42:54,494
We were left behind.

Listen.

2266
01:43:41,374 --> 01:43:43,414
Your performance is coming up soon.

2267
01:43:43,415 --> 01:43:46,814
It's when your reputation will get engraved.

2268
01:43:46,815 --> 01:43:49,855
From now on, it'll be about surviving.

2269
01:43:50,115 --> 01:43:52,053
You have to do a good job from now on.

2270
01:43:52,054 --> 01:43:54,384
You don't have skills, so how will you perform?

2271
01:43:55,924 --> 01:43:58,365
Have you watched any audition videos for other shows?

Yes.

2273
01:44:01,065 --> 01:44:02,735
Have you seen anything surprising?

2274
01:44:04,094 --> 01:44:07,004
Do you want to be as good as they are?

2275
01:44:08,004 --> 01:44:10,133
I'm doing this with my life on the line.

2276
01:44:10,134 --> 01:44:13,343
We don't have much time, and performance is no joke.

I thought that there was a problem.

I'm in 32nd place,

2279
01:44:19,115 --> 01:44:21,415
so this match is very important.

If our team loses,

2281
01:44:24,355 --> 01:44:27,084

01:44:34,695 --> 01:44:35,834
Sing the song.

2285
01:44:47,374 --> 01:44:50,474
(He keeps making mistakes with the lyrics.)

2286
01:44:54,344 --> 01:44:55,985
(Come inside more.)

2287
01:44:59,184 --> 01:45:00,355
Inside.

2288
01:45:03,525 --> 01:45:05,724
- Inside, please. - Okay.

2289
01:45:06,365 --> 01:45:07,365
Inside.

2290
01:45:07,464 --> 01:45:10,334
We do this in the beginning.

2291
01:45:11,035 --> 01:45:12,334
Let's practice, GUANYI.

2292
01:45:12,705 --> 01:45:13,734
We'll go.

2293
01:45:13,735 --> 01:45:15,874
- You and I, just like this - You have to do it.

2294
01:45:18,205 --> 01:45:19,374
Why aren't you singing?

2295
01:45:20,575 --> 01:45:23,915
(69th place, HOU GUANYI)

2296
01:45:25,014 --> 01:45:28,415
(Trainee HOU GUANYI sings his part.)

2297
01:45:28,785 --> 01:45:30,754
That was all out of tune.

2298
01:45:31,184 --> 01:45:34,655
"I bring what I want here" That was all out of tune.

2299
01:45:34,895 --> 01:45:36,924
I said it directly.

2300
01:45:37,054 --> 01:45:38,395
I did feel worried.

2301
01:45:38,964 --> 01:45:41,963
But honestly, I think if someone isn't so skilled,

2302
01:45:41,964 --> 01:45:44,364
that person needs to practice harder.

2303
01:45:44,365 --> 01:45:46,905
At least for the team members and the team.

2304
01:45:47,665 --> 01:45:50,074
If we practised the same way and you couldn't do it,

2305
01:45:50,075 --> 01:45:52,004
that means you didn't put in so much effort.

2306
01:45:53,405 --> 01:45:55,645
It's a bit weird.

2307
01:45:55,775 --> 01:45:57,815
It sounds like a tone-deaf person is singing.

2308
01:46:01,855 --> 01:46:04,854
That's wrong. The hip has to be here.

2309
01:46:04,855 --> 01:46:07,455
You keep using it like this, but it has to be on the right.

2310
01:46:08,294 --> 01:46:11,195
You keep moving wrong for the hip.

2311
01:46:11,464 --> 01:46:13,624
- Why do you keep pointing me out? - Why...

2312
01:46:13,794 --> 01:46:14,865
It's true.

2313
01:46:15,764 --> 01:46:18,304
It's true. You keep getting this part wrong.

2314
01:46:20,365 --> 01:46:21,535
What is it?

2315
01:46:23,275 --> 01:46:24,874
You keep getting it wrong.

2316
01:46:27,775 --> 01:46:29,145
The direction is wrong.

2317
01:46:31,044 --> 01:46:32,214
It's a bit...

2318
01:46:33,884 --> 01:46:35,614
Help.

2319
01:46:35,615 --> 01:46:38,124
(They ask Trainee YICHEN for help.)

2320
01:46:39,124 --> 01:46:43,723
If someone does it wrong, you should give him time to fix it.

2321
01:46:43,724 --> 01:46:48,934
How could they ask him to fix it immediately?

2322
01:46:49,395 --> 01:46:52,833
The leader makes mistakes too,

2323
01:46:52,834 --> 01:46:56,575
but I don't say anything even if I see that.

2324
01:46:56,874 --> 01:47:00,645
I was happily practising. Now it ruined my mood.

2325
01:47:04,445 --> 01:47:06,615
You can be practising. We'll talk.

2326
01:47:07,315 --> 01:47:08,684
Let's talk.

2327
01:47:20,865 --> 01:47:24,803
I don't think the leader is very patient.

2328
01:47:24,804 --> 01:47:27,734
He doesn't give me chances.

2329
01:47:27,735 --> 01:47:30,535
If I do something wrong, he keeps pointing that out.

2330
01:47:31,575 --> 01:47:37,615
He overreacts when someone does something wrong.

2331
01:47:37,674 --> 01:47:41,245
I get stressed when I see him.

2332
01:47:41,554 --> 01:47:42,914
We don't have much time left until the performance.

2333
01:47:42,915 --> 01:47:46,053
We had to finish it in a short time.

2334
01:47:46,054 --> 01:47:49,053
I think I talked in a sensitive way.

2335
01:47:49,054 --> 01:47:50,955
I feel sorry for the team members.

2336
01:47:51,395 --> 01:47:53,423
But I don't think I said that...

2337
01:47:53,424 --> 01:47:56,395
when HOU GUANYI didn't do anything wrong.

2338
01:48:00,634 --> 01:48:03,574
Everyone was sensitive.

2339
01:48:03,575 --> 01:48:05,205
We were anxious.

2340
01:48:05,874 --> 01:48:07,304
I was very worried.

2341
01:48:10,315 --> 01:48:12,214
- Here. Stand here. - Good luck!

2342
01:48:12,415 --> 01:48:15,554
The team practices weren't that good.

2343
01:48:15,785 --> 01:48:18,285
But we did our best in our preparations.

2344
01:48:18,884 --> 01:48:21,553
Let's just enjoy and do our best.

2345
01:48:21,554 --> 01:48:22,695
Let's bring up our energy.

2346
01:48:23,155 --> 01:48:27,794
I want to show people our best stage.

2347
01:48:31,804 --> 01:48:33,504
The first impact is important.

2348
01:48:34,605 --> 01:48:35,775
It's a cute song.

2349
01:48:37,535 --> 01:48:38,803
(Trainee waiting room)

2350
01:48:38,804 --> 01:48:40,204
I'm really looking forward to this.

2351
01:48:40,504 --> 01:48:41,674
They're starting.

2352
01:48:42,645 --> 01:48:44,274
Let's go!

2353

(JEONG DEUNHAESOL)

2355
01:48:54,254 --> 01:48:55,724
Yes.

2356
01:48:56,455 --> 01:48:58,094
He's good.

2357
01:49:02,735 --> 01:49:03,895
What is that?

2358
01:49:13,775 --> 01:49:15,544
His voice is really good.

2359
01:49:17,974 --> 01:49:19,285
Goodness.

2360
01:49:57,214 --> 01:49:58,455
HAESOL is cute.

2361
01:50:13,464 --> 01:50:14,974
(YANGWOO)

2362
01:50:23,714 --> 01:50:24,915
That was good.

2363
01:50:25,384 --> 01:50:27,415
- His voice is great. - I want that voice.

2364
01:50:58,645 --> 01:51:00,315
TAEYU.

2365
01:51:09,025 --> 01:51:10,794
His voice is nice.

2366
01:51:17,764 --> 01:51:19,864
(Check out the full performance on the PROJECT 7's YouTube channel.)

2367

(KIM TAEYU)

2376
01:51:40,785 --> 01:51:41,955
That was neat.

2377
01:51:43,424 --> 01:51:45,325
They were so good.

2378
01:51:45,964 --> 01:51:48,294
- They were so good. - They were so cute.

2379
01:51:48,695 --> 01:51:50,834
TAEHWAN kept singing.

2380
01:51:50,865 --> 01:51:52,065
He kept singing.

2381
01:51:52,434 --> 01:51:54,633
He sang every other part.

2382
01:51:54,634 --> 01:51:56,205
The pitch didn't fall at all.

2383
01:51:56,434 --> 01:51:58,444
- He's a monster. - He's good.

2384
01:51:58,445 --> 01:52:00,105
He was very stable.

2385
01:52:00,645 --> 01:52:02,274
TAEHWAN is really good.

2386
01:52:02,275 --> 01:52:03,615
TAEHWAN is really good.

2387
01:52:04,945 --> 01:52:07,645
He has a charm that makes you smile.

2388
01:52:08,714 --> 01:52:10,183
- Well done. - Well done.

2389
01:52:10,184 --> 01:52:12,683
- Well done. - Well done.

2390
01:52:12,684 --> 01:52:14,454
- Well done. - Shall we all hug?

2391
01:52:14,455 --> 01:52:16,454
- Let's all hug each other. - Sit?

2392
01:52:16,455 --> 01:52:17,695
Sit.

2393
01:52:17,995 --> 01:52:19,364
- Well done. - Well done.

2394
01:52:19,365 --> 01:52:21,124
Well done.

2395
01:52:21,594 --> 01:52:23,995
We went through so many issues.

2396
01:52:25,235 --> 01:52:26,705
We worked so hard.

2397
01:52:27,764 --> 01:52:30,535
I know everyone worked hard.

2398
01:52:30,905 --> 01:52:33,003
I'm really thankful that we all did well.

2399
01:52:33,004 --> 01:52:35,373
I want to thank them...

2400
01:52:35,374 --> 01:52:38,384
for completing the stage.

2401
01:52:39,415 --> 01:52:40,883
Next, we'll have the opposing team.

2402
01:52:40,884 --> 01:52:42,354
(Team "Make A Wish")

2403
01:52:42,355 --> 01:52:43,713
(AHN JUNWON)

2404
01:52:43,714 --> 01:52:46,584
Trainee YICHEN who said, "You, get out!"

2405
01:52:47,985 --> 01:52:49,354
- Yes. - I heard you say,

2406
01:52:49,355 --> 01:52:51,665
"You, come in" instead of "You, get out."

2407
01:52:53,594 --> 01:52:55,293
- "You, come in." - "You, come in."

2408
01:52:55,294 --> 01:52:57,664
- I heard his mom scolded him. - That was so funny.

2409
01:52:57,665 --> 01:52:59,905
I think she said, "Did I teach you to do that?"

2410
01:53:00,165 --> 01:53:01,834
I never wanted to be a leader...

2411
01:53:02,504 --> 01:53:05,374
after the issue.

2412
01:53:05,674 --> 01:53:10,445
But the members picked me as the leader.

2413
01:53:10,645 --> 01:53:13,944
I think they picked me...

2414
01:53:13,945 --> 01:53:16,955
so my image could change.

2415
01:53:17,554 --> 01:53:21,455
So I think it was a time of growth as a leader.

2416
01:53:21,584 --> 01:53:25,724
I want to thank the members once again.

2417
01:53:26,224 --> 01:53:28,763
We'll watch the performance...

2418
01:53:28,764 --> 01:53:30,365
you prepared as the leader.

2419
01:53:30,865 --> 01:53:32,605
- Trainee ANDY. - Yes.

2420
01:53:33,205 --> 01:53:35,803
I heard you became the center with a desperate heart.

2421
01:53:35,804 --> 01:53:37,884
(He won the center position with a desperate heart?)

2422
01:53:38,004 --> 01:53:40,404
I wanted to become the center...

2423
01:53:40,405 --> 01:53:41,925
from the moment this song was decided.

2424
01:53:42,115 --> 01:53:43,915
I tried to be the center,

2425
01:53:44,115 --> 01:53:47,584
but JIWOON was the center at first.

2426
01:53:48,315 --> 01:53:49,884
You can greet first. Let's go.

2427
01:53:50,355 --> 01:53:51,414
Two, three.

2428
01:53:51,415 --> 01:53:53,684
- We are Wishlist. - Wishlist.

2429
01:53:53,754 --> 01:53:56,355
- Hello. We are Wishlist. - Hello. We are Wishlist.

2430
01:53:58,665 --> 01:54:01,395
Let's see your performance first.

2431
01:54:01,495 --> 01:54:02,495
Be confident.

2432
01:54:02,496 --> 01:54:03,535
- Okay. - Okay.

2433
01:54:07,264 --> 01:54:09,705
(NAM JIWOON was the center in the choreography.)

2434
01:54:31,124 --> 01:54:32,794
It's very disappointing than I thought.

2435
01:54:32,964 --> 01:54:35,535
I thought I could do much better than that.

2436
01:54:36,535 --> 01:54:39,704
First, if JIWOON is the center,

2437
01:54:39,705 --> 01:54:41,734
you should be the center...

2438
01:54:41,735 --> 01:54:43,674
in terms of visuals and skills.

2439
01:54:43,804 --> 01:54:46,374
But we can't see any of those. They're hidden.

2440
01:54:47,474 --> 01:54:51,075
It makes me wonder why you became the center.

2441
01:54:51,785 --> 01:54:54,485
ANDY, how did JIWOON become the center?

2442
01:54:55,184 --> 01:54:57,285
At first, we...

2443
01:54:57,714 --> 01:54:59,424
Shall we decide the center first?

2444
01:54:59,754 --> 01:55:00,754
(ANDY volunteers.)

2445
01:55:00,755 --> 01:55:02,195
ANDY.

2446
01:55:03,254 --> 01:55:05,525
No one?

2447
01:55:05,964 --> 01:55:08,734
I have someone in mind.

2448
01:55:08,735 --> 01:55:10,365
- You can... - Who is it?

2449
01:55:10,695 --> 01:55:12,734
I personally want to recommend JIWOON.

2450
01:55:12,735 --> 01:55:14,464
(YICHEN recommends NAM JIWOON.)

2451
01:55:14,535 --> 01:55:17,605
- Me too. - Wait.

2452
01:55:17,775 --> 01:55:21,474
I think JIWOON will be able to do it better.

2453
01:55:21,745 --> 01:55:23,815
ANDY is too cute.

2454
01:55:24,115 --> 01:55:27,584
I'm confident in making cool expressions.

2455
01:55:29,155 --> 01:55:32,254
But ANDY is still a baby. You're too cute.

2456
01:55:32,355 --> 01:55:34,683
But I can still make it cool.

2457
01:55:34,684 --> 01:55:36,094
That could be a surprise.

2458
01:55:37,025 --> 01:55:39,365
- Could you show us? - Just the beginning part.

2459
01:55:40,294 --> 01:55:42,594
(12th NAM JIWOON)

2460
01:55:44,934 --> 01:55:46,665
I'm suddenly nervous. Okay.

2461
01:55:46,764 --> 01:55:48,474
Second, ANDY.

2462
01:55:48,974 --> 01:55:50,973
They said I have a cute image.

2463
01:55:50,974 --> 01:55:53,445
So I thought I should make the expression well.

2464
01:55:54,445 --> 01:55:57,514
(19th ANDY)

2465
01:56:01,145 --> 01:56:04,014
JIWOON has a better stage image.

2466
01:56:04,184 --> 01:56:07,584
But ANDY has better expressions.

2467
01:56:08,155 --> 01:56:11,754
We need to catch attention in the intro part.

2468
01:56:11,924 --> 01:56:13,001
- That's right. - That's right.

2469
01:56:13,025 --> 01:56:16,235
I think JIWOON can do that best among us.

2470
01:56:16,535 --> 01:56:17,834
Drum rolls.

2471
01:56:18,035 --> 01:56:20,634
ANDY is nervous. Oh, no.

2472
01:56:21,334 --> 01:56:23,303
JIWOON became the center member.

2473
01:56:23,304 --> 01:56:24,634
- We voted. - Thank you.

2474
01:56:25,304 --> 01:56:26,674
That's the result.

2475
01:56:26,905 --> 01:56:29,013
But don't feel so bad, ANDY.

2476
01:56:29,014 --> 01:56:31,245
There is a part you're good at.

2477
01:56:31,714 --> 01:56:34,485
I think we'll choose that.

2478
01:56:34,815 --> 01:56:36,414
Shall we decide sub vocal three?

2479
01:56:36,415 --> 01:56:38,554
Can I go to the restroom?

2480
01:56:38,924 --> 01:56:41,253
I had a bad feeling about it,

2481
01:56:41,254 --> 01:56:44,355
and when I looked at SOTA, he was very worried.

2482
01:56:44,655 --> 01:56:46,894
There were many parts ANDY did well.

2483
01:56:46,895 --> 01:56:49,434
(He quickly goes after him.)

2484
01:56:50,964 --> 01:56:52,004
ANDY.

2485
01:56:52,934 --> 01:56:54,235
You really did well.

2486
01:56:56,374 --> 01:56:58,174
I was so anxious...

2487
01:56:58,235 --> 01:57:00,474
because half of us will be eliminated.

2488
01:57:01,405 --> 01:57:03,174
I really want to do well.

2489
01:57:04,915 --> 01:57:07,614
YICHEN kept saying...

2490
01:57:07,615 --> 01:57:10,855
that he thought JIWOON would do well...

2491
01:57:11,184 --> 01:57:12,655
in this part.

2492
01:57:12,825 --> 01:57:15,554
So I couldn't get the part I wanted.

2493
01:57:15,855 --> 01:57:18,354
I'm so worried...

2494
01:57:18,355 --> 01:57:20,293
that I wouldn't be able to show myself properly.

2495
01:57:20,294 --> 01:57:21,495
I personally think...

2496
01:57:22,594 --> 01:57:24,954
it was disappointing because I couldn't see ANDY so much...

2497
01:57:24,995 --> 01:57:26,134
when he's sub rapper one.

2498
01:57:27,665 --> 01:57:28,874
I couldn't see ANDY so much.

2499
01:57:29,035 --> 01:57:33,444
You're someone who fits this song and the choreography well,

2500
01:57:33,445 --> 01:57:34,605
but we can't see you so much.

2501
01:57:34,844 --> 01:57:38,014
I want you to be greedy. Tell them you'll do it.

2502
01:57:38,075 --> 01:57:41,445
I want JIWOON to practice and do it well.

2503
01:57:42,155 --> 01:57:43,815
But when you're standing at the center,

2504
01:57:44,584 --> 01:57:46,654
I also feel nervous while watching you.

2505
01:57:46,655 --> 01:57:50,354
So if you don't think it will work, you could switch.

2506
01:57:50,355 --> 01:57:53,695
I felt embarrassed and upset.

2507
01:57:54,195 --> 01:57:56,963
I thought I could talk to them again...

2508
01:57:56,964 --> 01:57:59,105
about what I can show.

2509
01:57:59,434 --> 01:58:01,905
What do you think we should do about the center member?

2510
01:58:02,735 --> 01:58:05,705
The directors also recommended ANDY.

2511
01:58:06,374 --> 01:58:10,275
I want to try again if I can.

2512
01:58:11,145 --> 01:58:13,985
I think...

2513
01:58:15,145 --> 01:58:18,155
we should give him a chance.

2514
01:58:18,485 --> 01:58:22,093
I trusted what the directors said.

2515
01:58:22,094 --> 01:58:25,365
They were watching us,

2516
01:58:25,865 --> 01:58:29,235
and they could be representing the World Assemblers.

2517
01:58:30,165 --> 01:58:32,464
In practical thought,

2518
01:58:33,035 --> 01:58:35,705
I think everyone could quickly...

2519
01:58:36,275 --> 01:58:39,074
work on their fixed parts...

2520
01:58:39,075 --> 01:58:42,115
to improve the quality of the team.

2521
01:58:42,844 --> 01:58:46,985
I understand what YOUNGSEO said.

2522
01:58:49,554 --> 01:58:53,355
The directors said I could be more greedy,

2523
01:58:54,025 --> 01:58:57,594
but if we change the parts because of my greed,

2524
01:59:00,695 --> 01:59:02,764
JIWOON...

2525
01:59:02,995 --> 01:59:07,365
would only have the part of sub vocal three.

2526
01:59:08,105 --> 01:59:11,304
- We will have to... - That's not true.

2527
01:59:11,874 --> 01:59:13,344
You don't have to think like that.

2528
01:59:14,844 --> 01:59:17,445
If we do this when we don't have much time left,

2529
01:59:18,915 --> 01:59:22,714
I think it would affect us more negatively.

2530
01:59:22,915 --> 01:59:25,013
I think we can just do our best...

2531
01:59:25,014 --> 01:59:26,924
in our positions during the remaining time.

2532
01:59:28,054 --> 01:59:30,294
JIWOON could stay as the center member.

2533
01:59:31,054 --> 01:59:33,365
Since ANDY is young,

2534
01:59:33,865 --> 01:59:37,695
it felt like he was getting hurt by each and every word.

2535
01:59:38,565 --> 01:59:41,333
They thought like that because I didn't perform well.

2536
01:59:41,334 --> 01:59:45,035
ANDY could volunteer confidently,

2537
01:59:45,674 --> 01:59:48,674
but he got hurt after what the members said.

2538
01:59:49,275 --> 01:59:51,673
So that made me think a lot.

2539
01:59:51,674 --> 01:59:55,114
We've been thinking about this until now.

2540
01:59:55,115 --> 01:59:57,984
If there's something certain, it would be right to pursue that,

2541
01:59:57,985 --> 02:00:01,124
but if it's not certain like now,

2542
02:00:01,485 --> 02:00:03,553
I honestly think it would be better to try it...

2543
02:00:03,554 --> 02:00:05,464
than not do anything.

2544
02:00:06,594 --> 02:00:10,594
(They record the choreography for the intro for comparison.)

2545
02:00:18,075 --> 02:00:21,344
They both suit the position, and they're both good.

2546
02:00:22,044 --> 02:00:25,583
But even though ANDY didn't prepare much,

2547
02:00:25,584 --> 02:00:26,944
he stood out more.

2548
02:00:26,945 --> 02:00:27,945
(He chose ANDY because he stood out.)

2549
02:00:27,946 --> 02:00:30,414
I think this is the biggest difference.

2550
02:00:30,415 --> 02:00:33,923
I like both JIWOON's and ANDY's performances.

2551
02:00:33,924 --> 02:00:36,084
- But the mood changes a lot. - The mood is different.

2552
02:00:36,124 --> 02:00:38,623
With ANDY, it's hip too,

2553
02:00:38,624 --> 02:00:41,695
but it's more bouncy and fun.

2554
02:00:41,794 --> 02:00:44,763
But when we think about the song,

2555
02:00:44,764 --> 02:00:48,974
I think the mood that ANDY makes goes better.

2556
02:00:49,934 --> 02:00:51,974
I think ANDY should do it.

2557
02:00:52,745 --> 02:00:54,904
- Then, ANDY. - ANDY.

2558
02:00:54,905 --> 02:00:56,144
(The center member is changed to Trainee ANDY.)

2559
02:00:56,145 --> 02:00:57,514
- Thank you. - Congratulations.

2560
02:00:57,775 --> 02:00:59,343
- ANDY. - It's a drama.

2561
02:00:59,344 --> 02:01:00,683
You took the center position...

2562
02:01:00,684 --> 02:01:02,060
- in the previous team. - Thank you.

2563
02:01:02,084 --> 02:01:04,514
You can take it from me.

2564
02:01:05,525 --> 02:01:08,253
(He took it then.)

2565
02:01:08,254 --> 02:01:10,495
(And now, it's being taken from him.)

2566
02:01:10,825 --> 02:01:13,423
I have to do better for JIWOON as well.

2567
02:01:13,424 --> 02:01:16,665
I should become the center that the team can rely on.

2568
02:01:16,865 --> 02:01:20,405
It felt like everyone found their positions.

2569
02:01:20,535 --> 02:01:23,834
We had a better picture than before.

2570
02:01:24,235 --> 02:01:25,645
We will win no matter what.

2571
02:01:26,874 --> 02:01:29,873
I want to get the highest score, 700,000 points.

2572
02:01:29,874 --> 02:01:31,945
- It's 70,000. - Right, 70,000.

2573
02:01:32,384 --> 02:01:36,285
- One, two, three. - This is it.

2574
02:01:36,655 --> 02:01:39,325
(He practices regardless of time and place.)

2575
02:01:40,285 --> 02:01:41,423
(There was someone...)

2576
02:01:41,424 --> 02:01:43,325
(who invaded the passion.)

2577
02:01:43,395 --> 02:01:47,923
SOTA was slow...

2578
02:01:47,924 --> 02:01:49,895
in following the practice.

2579
02:01:50,964 --> 02:01:52,834
(Making mistakes)

2580
02:01:54,905 --> 02:01:55,934
Don't you think...

2581
02:01:56,334 --> 02:01:59,705
it's a bit weird when you look at the mirror?

2582
02:02:02,844 --> 02:02:04,174
Go to the other side.

2583
02:02:04,615 --> 02:02:06,444
Here.

2584
02:02:06,445 --> 02:02:07,615
(Making mistakes)

2585
02:02:08,415 --> 02:02:09,554
Here.

2586
02:02:10,054 --> 02:02:11,461
It's the same thing as when we go to that side.

2587
02:02:11,485 --> 02:02:12,655
Only the direction changed.

2588
02:02:12,684 --> 02:02:13,985
- Let's go. - Go where?

2589
02:02:17,254 --> 02:02:20,464
(He stands out in the group dance as well.)

2590
02:02:23,065 --> 02:02:24,625
He gets the moves wrong too many times.

2591
02:02:25,705 --> 02:02:28,004
(There's not much time left until their stage.)

2592
02:02:28,605 --> 02:02:29,705
What do we do?

2593
02:02:29,834 --> 02:02:34,003
Actually, even when I see SOTA...

2594
02:02:34,004 --> 02:02:35,745
practice individually,

2595
02:02:36,374 --> 02:02:39,514
I couldn't tell what he was trying to practice.

2596
02:02:40,315 --> 02:02:42,714
Please come and ask us.

2597
02:02:43,084 --> 02:02:44,784
(In charge of translation)

2598
02:02:44,785 --> 02:02:48,053
- Tomorrow, we'll master... - Yes.

2599
02:02:48,054 --> 02:02:49,724
- the details. - Okay.

2600
02:02:50,054 --> 02:02:52,053
I don't want us...

2601
02:02:52,054 --> 02:02:54,964
to waste time on that.

2602
02:02:55,634 --> 02:02:58,035
I want SOTA to practice harder.

2603
02:02:58,634 --> 02:02:59,634
Okay.

2604
02:03:00,565 --> 02:03:02,405
I'm worried about SOTA.

2605
02:03:02,905 --> 02:03:04,235
He's in trouble.

2606
02:03:06,174 --> 02:03:08,174
SOTA kept making mistakes.

2607
02:03:08,605 --> 02:03:11,344
I was so scared. I was worried about that.

2608
02:03:11,674 --> 02:03:14,244
I kept thinking, "What will we do?"

2609
02:03:14,245 --> 02:03:16,445
(They become worried about performing because of SOTA.)

2610
02:03:16,714 --> 02:03:19,155
(But SOTA is still passive.)

2611
02:03:20,325 --> 02:03:23,294
(He makes a mistake as well.)

2612
02:03:23,895 --> 02:03:26,264
You didn't do it, SOTA.

2613
02:03:27,325 --> 02:03:29,234
Look. It's so small.

2614
02:03:29,235 --> 02:03:31,695
We told you to make it big several times.

2615
02:03:32,365 --> 02:03:35,405
Why aren't you moving your hands?

2616
02:03:38,874 --> 02:03:42,775
Make big hand movements while doing that step.

2617
02:03:43,874 --> 02:03:47,343
I don't know how many times I said that.

2618
02:03:47,344 --> 02:03:48,485
I'm tired of saying it now.

2619
02:03:49,785 --> 02:03:52,753
Look at yourself in the mirror,

2620
02:03:52,754 --> 02:03:55,955
and ask the others if it looks wrong.

2621
02:03:56,094 --> 02:03:57,454
Or you could watch it on the iPad.

2622
02:03:58,325 --> 02:04:02,365
I haven't seen you practice...

2623
02:04:02,964 --> 02:04:05,235
while watching it on the iPad.

2624
02:04:07,434 --> 02:04:11,334
I don't want to say this to you either.

2625
02:04:11,374 --> 02:04:12,944
We're the closest to each other.

2626
02:04:12,945 --> 02:04:15,204
But I can't stand it.

2627
02:04:15,205 --> 02:04:17,285
We'd really get eliminated if we continue like this.

2628
02:04:17,974 --> 02:04:20,485
I felt bad.

2629
02:04:21,084 --> 02:04:23,884
I worked hard.

2630
02:04:27,884 --> 02:04:31,624
But it felt like I had to work harder.

2631
02:04:32,054 --> 02:04:34,923
You can find the parts that went wrong.

2632
02:04:34,924 --> 02:04:37,794
SOTA has to show us now.

2633
02:04:37,995 --> 02:04:40,434
All the members...

2634
02:04:40,964 --> 02:04:43,275
will help SOTA perform better.

2635
02:04:44,535 --> 02:04:47,004
