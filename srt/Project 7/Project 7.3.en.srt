There are some of us...

105

who know the choreography and need to get points for the team.

106
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:05,879
I think it'd be good for just those people...

107

to practice being in sync together.

108
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,810

00:08:28,579 --> 00:08:31,180
None of them just stood there, right?

182
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,379
They prepared a lot more than I expected.

183
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:38,359
They all had the same amount of time and the same conditions,

184
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,729
but we can clearly see that some did well.

185
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,659
I can see who put in the effort.

186
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,000
(What will the results of the video evaluation be?)

187
00:08:47,629 --> 00:08:48,768
Let's go.

188
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:50,969
(Carefully entering, half-excited and half-nervous)

189
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,969
- Hold on. - Oh, goodness.

190
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,709
No way. They won't play it on this, right?

191
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:55,940
Right, what we did yesterday.

192
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,440
I'm scared.

193
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,909
What will we do here?

194
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,210
What could this be?

195
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,210
(All trainees have been seated.)

196
00:09:02,211 --> 00:09:03,879
I think they'll announce the tiers.

197
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:05,950
- Right. - Right.

198
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,149
Yes, I think they'll announce the tiers.

199
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,320
Do you have a guess as to what tier we'll be?

200
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,719
- Us? - Yes.

201
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,990
- We need to be in the First Tier. - We need to be in the First Tier.

202
00:09:14,659 --> 00:09:17,299
We need to live up to our team name.

203
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:20,330
I want to be in 1st or 2nd Tier.

204
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,100
I just don't want to be in the Shadow Zone.

205
00:09:23,169 --> 00:09:26,299
(The directors enter.)

206
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:28,269
(Automatically bowing)

207
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,210
So cool!

208
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,109
Hello.

209
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,750
- Hello. - Hello.

210
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:38,949
We really enjoyed...

211
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,590
your videos.

212
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,250
- They watched everything. - They already watched them?

213
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,658
- You're right. - Which team will get...

214
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:49,059
the First Tier Zone?

215
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:52,558
We'll reveal the video evaluation scores right away.

216
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,629
Right away?

217
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,730
Here they are.

218
00:09:57,299 --> 00:09:58,700
Hold on.

219
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,209
- Oh, no. - This fast?

220
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,269
Oh, no.

221
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:04,710
They'll just put it up there?

222
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,350
- They'll just put it up there? - What is that?

223
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,179
They'll show our scores.

224
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:11,580
This is a public execution.

225
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:13,278
As long as we avoid the Shadow Zone.

226
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,289
We'll reveal the individual scores...

227
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:18,658
of the video evaluation for the C rank trainees...

228
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:21,559
of each team.

229
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:22,959
- Oh, my. - Oh, no.

230
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,229
(YOO HEEDO, 15 points, AHN JUNWON, 12 points)

231
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,460
(KIM TAESUNG, 16 points, SVIAT, 18 points)

232
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:29,799
Oh, no.

233
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:33,500
Four of our C rank members got 4 points.

234
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,809
I was very shocked.

235
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,709
I felt so bad...

236
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,649
that I wanted to get on my knees and beg.

237
00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:44,249
I saw that many C rank trainees...

238
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,179
got 16 points.

239
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:47,889
Oh, my. Fifteen points?

240
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:49,889
- Oh, my. Eighteen points? - Eighteen points?

241
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:52,418
- SVIAT. - SVIAT.

242
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:53,759
SVIAT got 18 points?

243
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,830
(The highest score of the C rank trainees)

244
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,729
All directors highly praised Team P5's...

245
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:01,730
(All directors highly praised Team P5's...)

246
00:11:01,731 --> 00:11:02,799
SVIAT.

247
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,139
SVIAT.

248
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:10,879
(Great job.)

249
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,509
(Video evaluation score, SVIAT, 18 points, feeling shy)

250
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:15,379
Good job.

251
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,750
Oh, my. SVIAT.

252
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:20,580
I did the best? Really?

253
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:24,120
I was so happy. I got first place.

254
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,889
This is the combined score of the C rank trainees.

255
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,100
Here it is.

256
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,470
We didn't have many C rank trainees to begin with.

257
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,639
- They even had more people. - Right.

258
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:43,269
- That was a disadvantage. - Next,

259
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:45,139
B rank.

260
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,609
(Next, they'll reveal the B rank trainees' scores.)

261
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:49,109
- We have the most B ranks. - Here are the individual scores...

262
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,980
for the video evaluations.

263
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:53,378
It'll be okay.

264
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,689
(KWON YONGHYUN, 16 points, KIM JOONWOO, 18 points)

265
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:55,749
(KIM JIMIN, 18 points, ABE YURA, 18 points)

266
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,750
(PETCH, 17 points)

267
00:11:56,751 --> 00:11:57,759
Eight points.

268
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:00,419
- JUNWOO. - What?

269
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,230
(Good job.)

270
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,360
(Trainee KIM JUNWOO got the highest score.)

271
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,999
Okay. We will now reveal the combined scores...

272
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,309
of the B rank and C rank trainees.

273
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:18,409
So dangerous.

274
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:21,079
(Currently, P3 is in 1st place.)

275
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,110
- Their scores... - They have so many over 10 points.

276
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:25,518
Next, A rank.

277
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,679
(They'll reveal the A rank trainees' scores.)

278
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:29,350
We'll reveal the individual scores.

279
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,759
(P1 has many A rank trainees.)

280
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:35,690
(Will they be able to close the gap?)

281
00:12:36,429 --> 00:12:40,360
I was just hoping it wasn't lower than my expectation.

282
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,469
(YOO YOUNGSEO, 18 points, CHAE HEEJU, 17 points)

283
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,668
(SEO KYOUNGBAE, 10 points, YEOM YECHAN, 15 points)

284
00:12:42,669 --> 00:12:43,669
(KWON YANGWOO, 16 points)

285
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,970
(Many sighs are heard from the P1 members.)

286
00:12:47,669 --> 00:12:48,839
The scores are awful.

287
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,869
(Contrary to their expectations, P1 got many low scores.)

288
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,980
My pride was really hurt.

289
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,148
I felt so bad for my team.

290
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:55,580
(Video evaluation score, LEE HANBIN, 5 points)

291
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:58,349
(All A rank trainees in P4 got high scores.)

292
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,820
- Fourteen points isn't bad. - You did so well.

293
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,590
We'll now reveal the combined scores...

294
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:07,759
- of the A, B, and C rank trainees. - Our scores are high right now.

295
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:09,590
Here they are.

296
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:16,899
(Currently, P4 is in 1st Tier.)

297
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:20,239
P4 is in first place.

298
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,669
- P4 is First Tier. - What?

299
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:25,908
Yes, the rankings keep flipping.

300
00:13:25,909 --> 00:13:26,909
(The current rankings before the S rank scores)

301
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:27,980
Here are the scores.

302
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,548
Will Team P4...

303
00:13:30,549 --> 00:13:32,850
keep their first place spot?

304
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,549
(Please.)

305
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,758
We'll now reveal the combined scores of all trainees.

306
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:40,989
(Revealing the combined scores of all trainees, including S ranks)

307
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:41,990
Here they are.

308
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,298
(Video evaluation ranking, Tier 1, P4, 230 points)

309
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:49,799
(By a small margin, P4 got in the First Tier Zone.)

310
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:52,500
(Exclaiming)

311
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:57,340
It really felt like a dream.

312
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:04,980
(P3 is in despair.)

313
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:06,979
Fifth place, P3.

314
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,990
(P3 got the Shadow Zone.)

315
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,249
(Video evaluation score, KWON YEUNG, 8 points)

316
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,350
This is the worst.

317
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,059
If I had done well,

318
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:13,659
we could've avoided the Shadow Zone.

319
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:16,489
Fourth place, P2.

320
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,299
(P2 got the Fourth Tier Zone with 198 points.)

321
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:21,129
We can't be satisfied with getting fourth place.

322
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,129
I don't think it'll be different from the Shadow Zone.

323
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,239
Third place, P1.

324
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,169
(P1 got the Third Tier Zone with 208 points.)

325
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,379
I can't believe we got third place.

326
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,878
Second place, P5.

327
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:38,918
(P5 got the Second Tier Zone with 223 points.)

328
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,389
And first place.

329
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:44,048
P4.

330
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,089
(P4 got the First Tier Zone with 230 points.)

331
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,259
P4 got the First Tier Zone?

332
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,629
- They did well. - Thank you.

333
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,428
We'll need to try even harder.

334
00:14:53,429 --> 00:14:54,470
(Teary)

335
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:55,700
Team P4.

336
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:56,929
- Yes. - Yes.

337
00:14:57,169 --> 00:14:58,169
Are you happy?

338
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,240
- Yes. - Yes.

339
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:03,470
It's too early to be happy.

340
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,840
Why?

341
00:15:04,841 --> 00:15:06,610
(Surprised)

342
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:10,849
The combined video evaluation scores we just saw...

343
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,379
Please.

344
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:18,720
They aren't the final scores of the Title Song Evaluation.

345
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,490
(Oh, no.)

346
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,090
- I thought so. - It's okay. We can make it.

347
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,128
Please.

348
00:15:26,129 --> 00:15:28,299
- They must be something more. - Please.

349
00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:32,700
There's one more evaluation left for you.

350
00:15:34,269 --> 00:15:35,809
- Isn't that good for us? - It is.

351
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:37,169
Please.

352
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:39,879
We have a chance. We got another chance.

353
00:15:40,179 --> 00:15:42,308
That's good news. We can do it.

354
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:44,648
It's the team evaluation.

355
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:45,679
(Next is the Team Evaluation.)

356
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,979
For the team evaluation,

357
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,490
you must perform "RUN" with 20 people.

358
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53,089
Formations, line distributions,

359
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,860
choreography, and rap making.

360
00:15:56,259 --> 00:15:59,298
There's no limit to making this performance.

361
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:00,399
(The team evaluations have no limits on how to make the performance.)

362
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,669
Make up for individual weaknesses...

363
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,740
and upgrade your teams' strengths...

364
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,638
to prove that you are a perfectly assembled team.

365
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:11,240
(An evaluation to prove they're a perfectly assembled team)

366
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,679
This is hard.

367
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,350
The video evaluation score and the team evaluation score...

368
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,779
will be combined to determine the Title Song Tiers.

369
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:21,648
Depending on the team evaluation,

370
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:24,659
the final rankings can change a lot.

371
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:28,960
Please put all of your effort into practising.

372
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,929
- Okay. - Okay.

373
00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:33,899
We'll have to practice even harder.

374
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,928
We can only go up from here.

375
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:38,339
We won't let anyone take our first place spot.

376
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,299
We will not lose.

377
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:41,809
I'm confident.

378
00:16:42,309 --> 00:16:45,340
(The practices for the team evaluation begin!)

379
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,980
- It's not your fault. - You did nothing wrong, JUNSEO.

380
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:50,549
It's not your fault.

381
00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:53,849
You really did well.

382
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:54,850
It's not your fault.

383
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:59,289
I wanted to give you all the best spot on the stage.

384
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,419
You did well.

385
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:03,459
- There's nothing more you could do. - You did well.

386
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,460
(P1 is disappointed in the video evaluation results.)

387
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:07,659
Because I was the leader,

388
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,299
I should've led the team better so everyone could do well.

389
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:12,240
I felt so embarrassed.

390
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:15,440
After we saw the results,

391
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,940
I felt bad for my team.

392
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,910
I really feel bad...

393
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:20,980
about facing my team members.

394
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,179
- You did so well. - I'm sorry.

395
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,720
- Don't say that. Stop it. - Why are you sorry?

396
00:17:28,049 --> 00:17:31,390
You even used your own practice time to help us.

397
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,819
- I'll try even harder. - You did well.

398
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,259
You're doing well.

399
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,429
I thought our team was a strong and talented team,

400
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,630
and we did our best to prepare,

401
00:17:41,869 --> 00:17:45,539
but we didn't get very good scores.

402
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,740
I thought that we should try even harder.

403
00:17:50,609 --> 00:17:53,380
I got the lowest individual score.

404
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,180
I thought that I needed to make up for it.

405
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,150
Our eyes were burning with determination.

406
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,479
I just wanted to do well.

407
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,548
Okay.

408
00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:03,219
Then we change formations.

409
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,989
Can we each say our numbers?

410
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:07,019
- What number are you, ANDY? - I'm 3.25.

411
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,088
- What number are you, YOUNGSEO? - I'm three.

412
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:10,189
- What about you, HYOJIN? - What about you, HYOJIN?

413
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,959
- Three. - You're three.

414
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,960
Can you check JUNWOO's number?

415
00:18:14,099 --> 00:18:15,569
I'm 1.5.

416
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:18,640
- JUNWOO should be 2 or 1.8. - Hey.

417
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:21,939
Let's check each other's.

418
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,369
I'm so sorry,

419
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,338
but we'll never finish if we keep obsessing over numbers.

420
00:18:25,339 --> 00:18:27,209
- I think we just need to feel it. - You're right.

421
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:28,308
This is taking too much time.

422
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:30,249
I was checking the numbers to make things go faster.

423
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,579
To make things exact.

424
00:18:32,049 --> 00:18:34,318
- Okay. - I don't think we're even here.

425
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:35,749
There's one more person on this side.

426
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,258
- So stand behind YONGHYUN. - You need to take a step back.

427
00:18:38,259 --> 00:18:40,058
So ANDY,

428
00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:42,088
can you sit down? A bit more back.

429
00:18:42,089 --> 00:18:43,759
I think the practice...

430
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,859
was taking a lot of time because we wanted to do our best.

431
00:18:48,099 --> 00:18:50,899
What I meant about not caring about the numbers...

432
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,470
is if we keep nitpicking about this, we'll never make progress.

433
00:18:53,539 --> 00:18:56,338
If the formation isn't right, we can adjust by looking in front.

434
00:18:56,339 --> 00:18:58,410
So for now, we just need to go to what we think is right.

435
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,078
I think we need to learn the choreography first.

436
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:01,249
- Okay. - Sounds good.

437
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,608
I have an opinion. Could I share it?

438
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:04,618
Let's talk after we get...

439
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:06,079
- the formation right. - Let's do that first.

440
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:08,588
Because we tried to check...

441
00:19:08,589 --> 00:19:11,189
every little detail from wanting to do well,

442
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,259
it took a long time.

443
00:19:12,589 --> 00:19:15,589
It did feel that we started to feel rushed.

444
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:18,130
I don't think the situation was great.

445
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:22,329
(The morning of the team evaluation day)

446
00:19:23,269 --> 00:19:26,338
(P1 is looking even more serious.)

447
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:29,740
I feel bad saying this,

448
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,140
but I think things got mixed up...

449
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,980
because we tried to do too much from wanting to do so well.

450
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:38,919
Since it's impossible to change everything,

451
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,390
I think it'll be best to give up on certain things.

452
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:44,858
But you know that they expect a lot from us.

453
00:19:44,859 --> 00:19:46,419
If we can't even do that much,

454
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,028
we won't stand out.

455
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:50,729
But we're putting in that much,

456
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:51,960
but neither one is apparent.

457
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:54,829
We're trying to do two things, but we're not doing either.

458
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,799
I'm saying we should give up on one and really do well on the other.

459
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:01,739
I thought we should let go of some things...

460
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,410
and make things simple.

461
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,538
And MINSEO thought we'd have to replace...

462
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,950
whatever we take out with something new,

463
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,450
so he said no.

464
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,049
We disagreed a bit on that part.

465
00:20:14,619 --> 00:20:17,419
I thought it was too late at that point.

466
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,989
We didn't even have enough time to increase our quality.

467
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,130
I didn't see a need to use more time and take a gamble.

468
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:27,258
I like sharing opinions,

469
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,999
but I think that needs to happen when you have a solution.

470
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,169
So are you saying we should keep it as is...

471
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:35,038
- because there's no solution... - I think...

472
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,469
This is what I think.

473
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,779
I think we'll definitely be okay if we clean things up a bit.

474
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:42,308
If I didn't see it happen, I would think,

475
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:44,149
"It'll take some time for us to do this much."

476
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,750
But I already saw us do it.

477
00:20:46,819 --> 00:20:48,649
But just because you saw that,

478
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:50,949
we shouldn't keep going when we couldn't do it for hours.

479
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,618
I'm saying it looked good after we did it for hours.

480
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,430
Things just got bad after we got to this part.

481
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:03,069
(What performance will P1 give after this debate?)

482
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:08,269
(P2's training room)

483
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:11,710
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't upset.

484
00:21:15,349 --> 00:21:17,278
It felt quite hopeless.

485
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:18,380
(Video evaluation score, KIM JOONWOO, 18 points)

486
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:22,150
Because we have a big team of 20 members...

487
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:28,759
(P2's strategy, Let's put forth our most talented members.)

488
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:31,529
When we practised separately like that,

489
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:33,798
it felt like the other trainees...

490
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:36,369
were basically being neglected.

491
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,940
(And with the C ranks getting low scores,)

492
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:43,739
(P2 got the 4th Tier Zone.)

493
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,538
Under the stage, there's the Shadow Zone.

494
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:48,608
And the Fourth Tier Zone is like the on-stage Shadow Zone.

495
00:21:48,609 --> 00:21:50,710
So I felt very upset.

496
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,650
We'll start practising group formations.

497
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:56,788
We're going to start the pre-chorus part...

498
00:21:56,789 --> 00:21:58,089
in a pyramid shape.

499
00:21:59,059 --> 00:22:01,990
(Resuming practice under their leader's direction)

500
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,460
From here...

501
00:22:03,461 --> 00:22:05,960
(But...)

502
00:22:10,069 --> 00:22:12,768
Some of the members were in charge...

503
00:22:12,769 --> 00:22:14,199
of making the formations.

504
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,239
(KIM SIHUN, KIM TAEYU, KIM HYUNJAE, YOO HEEDO)

505
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,038
After that, we practised...

506
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:21,450
the overall performance with the whole team.

507
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:28,089
(Although they made the formations, the team wasn't progressing.)

508
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,420
Even though they had the time...

509
00:22:31,619 --> 00:22:34,258
to make the formations,

510
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:38,028
the practice was completely...

511
00:22:38,029 --> 00:22:39,529
inefficient.

512
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:42,569
- I'm just asking... - Yes?

513
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,869
because I'm not sure,

514
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:48,140
but I think the "I'm running" part is a key part.

515
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:51,338
So I think the members in that part...

516
00:22:51,339 --> 00:22:53,740
- should come up together. - Right.

517
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:57,710
- We did think about that first too. - Okay.

518
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:00,819
But after a bit of thought, we changed our minds.

519
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:02,919
We could do it from the back.

520
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:06,788
I'll go down like this.

521
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:09,759
We could do it from the back. HYUNGSEOK and DANU are tall.

522
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:12,659
And then that part.

523
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,358
There isn't much time.

524
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:16,268
(The practice is slow.)

525
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:18,400
Then...

526
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,639
- Hold on. - Can I say one thing?

527
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,639
- Yes. - For this part...

528
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,379
We can stand on "One, two, three, four."

529
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,649
(KIM JOONWOO keeps sharing ideas on how to change the formations.)

530
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:29,880
- Here? - Yes.

531
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,879
And the reason we weren't going to this...

532
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,419
- was because it looked messy. - Right.

533
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:38,759
- It's because JOONWOO wasn't here. - Right.

534
00:23:39,089 --> 00:23:40,420
We were learning the formations,

535
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:42,490
then another chef came into the kitchen.

536
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,258
I think we should just decide on one person.

537
00:23:44,259 --> 00:23:45,900
It's something I've been thinking about.

538
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,199
I think it's good to share ideas since we're all doing this together.

539
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,369
But we're back to square one now.

540
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:54,269
We got rid of everything we made over there.

541
00:23:54,769 --> 00:23:56,269
It has become meaningless.

542
00:23:56,569 --> 00:23:58,379
If we keep going this way, we'll end up a mess.

543
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,880
That's why we need 1 or 2 people...

544
00:24:01,009 --> 00:24:03,079
to direct the whole team.

545
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,650
So we need to decide now.

546
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,750
I think we need to practice efficiently.

547
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,220
I get that, but what do you want to do?

548
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:16,130
Whether you recommend someone or you volunteer,

549
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:20,559
I think it would be best to hear our people's opinions...

550
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:24,200
and vote on a director while all 20 of us are here.

551
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:27,098
To be honest, I think I should do it.

552
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:31,039
I think it's right that I have this position.

553
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:33,880
But JOONWOO wants to do it...

554
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,609
that badly.

555
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:39,519
I don't know...

556
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,190
what I should do about that, to be honest.

557
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:44,989
If you do the directing, but things don't go well,

558
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,960
the director will be blamed.

559
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:48,759
We all know that.

560
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,058
I think when you volunteer to do that,

561
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:54,130
it means you're prepared for that outcome.

562
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:56,469
I have that sense of responsibility,

563
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:58,399
and that's why I said so.

564
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,069
But if he's taking it that way,

565
00:25:00,869 --> 00:25:04,140
I honestly don't know what I should say now.

566
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:08,980
Do you really think of me as the leader, JOONWOO?

567
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:10,650
Yes.

568
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:13,649
Do you really think of me as the leader?

569
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:14,818
I do.

570
00:25:14,819 --> 00:25:18,119
In my opinion, I think...

571
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:21,490
SIHUN should direct the choreography.

572
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:24,689
"This is how it should be done."

573
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,099
I don't want you to be so stubborn like that.

574
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,400
If you're not convinced...

575
00:25:31,769 --> 00:25:34,599
by what I said,

576
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,140
you should be the leader.

577
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:37,910
You should be the leader.

578
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:45,119
I had a great sense of attachment to my team.

579
00:25:45,849 --> 00:25:47,679
I was upset. But my sense of attachment...

580
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,319
was weakened slightly.

581
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:53,319
It felt as if the effort...

582
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:56,529
I made for the team was denied.

583
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,630
I was disappointed.

584
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:03,028
(As the situation gets worse,)

585
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:05,470
(will they be able to finish the evaluation well?)

586
00:26:06,099 --> 00:26:08,068
Anyway, looking at the results,

587
00:26:08,069 --> 00:26:10,910
we were ranked last in the video evaluation.

588
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,509
We were ranked last.

589
00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:17,649
But I think we can still work hard as a team and improve ourselves...

590
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,079
with this mission.

591
00:26:20,019 --> 00:26:21,819
I received five points.

592
00:26:22,619 --> 00:26:26,319
I mainly thought about how I shouldn't be a burden on my team.

593
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:29,160
I wanted to apologize to the team.

594
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:32,200
But I couldn't bring myself...

595
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:34,730
to address my team and apologize.

596
00:26:35,769 --> 00:26:38,700
I felt bad for everyone.

597
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,098
I hope all of you will be determined to crush it...

598
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,710
and win this mission as we practice.

599
00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:46,809
I wanted to be on that stage no matter what it took.

600
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,809
We could be in the 3rd Tier Zone or the 4th Tier Zone.

601
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:50,950
Under any circumstances,

602
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:53,679
I didn't want us to perform off the stage.

603
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,880
That was the priority I had.

604
00:26:55,819 --> 00:26:57,618
In my opinion, when we perform as a team,

605
00:26:57,619 --> 00:27:00,490
we should include special movements that can attract more attention.

606
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,859
We should discuss where we could include them.

607
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:05,459
We could complement each other's weaknesses...

608
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:08,500
and make our strengths stand out with this team challenge.

609
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:11,429
Honestly, I thought this mission was perfect for our team.

610
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,799
I thought we had to be the best.

611
00:27:13,569 --> 00:27:16,440
- I want to offer my ideas too. - Okay.

612
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,679
- Given that the majority... - On my count.

613
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,508
of our team members received low scores,

614
00:27:20,509 --> 00:27:23,078
I thought they would be more determined to ace this.

615
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:24,108
Right?

616
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:26,049
I thought we had a shot at this...

617
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,519
since we would perform as a team.

618
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:32,719
I didn't want to settle for less.

619
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,059
I tried to look for ways to include all of our members...

620
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:36,588
and showcase their talents.

621
00:27:36,589 --> 00:27:38,630
I want to balance everything...

622
00:27:39,329 --> 00:27:42,329
as I do my best to come up with the best possible performance.

623
00:27:44,099 --> 00:27:45,298
And all of us should do this.

624
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:47,069
Let's kick it to look cool.

625
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:50,640
Yes. Let's add that too. This one.

626
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:52,139
That's cool.

627
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,479
As for this part, "I'm running,"

628
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,779
I would like SOTA to do it. What do you think?

629
00:27:57,309 --> 00:28:00,279
(FUKUYAMA SOTA tries out for the highlight.)

630
00:28:00,849 --> 00:28:02,190
I'm running

631
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:06,960
(Greatly satisfied)

632
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:10,559
NOYUL. Pretend that you have the center position and walk over.

633
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:13,229
Two, three, four.

634
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,230
(Perfectly in sync)

635
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,230
(Nice.)

636
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,098
- He's satisfied. - He seems quite satisfied.

637
00:28:18,099 --> 00:28:19,939
- He didn't want to admit it. - He's happy with it.

638
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:20,969
Let's try it.

639
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:26,440
The star that shines at the tip of your finger

640
00:28:27,109 --> 00:28:29,278
(HA SEOKHEE is the main vocalist.)

641
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,108
- Gosh, that's high. - At the end...

642
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:33,379
This one is for the production crew. I'm so sorry for saying this.

643
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,919
You guys were wickedly smart.

644
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,389
Shadow Zone? I mean, what is that?

645
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:37,689
How could anyone think of that?

646
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:38,960
We could end up as their shadows.

647
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:40,859
I really don't want to end up in the Shadow Zone.

648
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,960
We were ranked last.

649
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,258
But we won't lose.

650
00:28:45,259 --> 00:28:46,700
(Let's go P3, we'll show what we're capable of!)

651
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,470
With this team challenge, we'll turn the table around.

652
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,799
(Will P3 be able to escape from the Shadow Zone?)

653
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,508
- You guys all know, right? - Yes.

654
00:28:56,509 --> 00:28:57,940
We were ranked...

655
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,278
- first. - First!

656
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,779
(P4 received the highest score from the video evaluation.)

657
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:06,249
To go up higher,

658
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,950
let's talk about the direction we should take.

659
00:29:09,549 --> 00:29:11,390
We should all share opinions on our approach.

660
00:29:11,619 --> 00:29:13,089
You know what I think?

661
00:29:13,289 --> 00:29:14,959
We could have TAESUNG do his signature kick.

662
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,159
- So focus on the performance? - Yes.

663
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,058
- We have many secret weapons. - Exactly.

664
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:20,929
Here's what I think. I can enter from the side.

665
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:22,068
I want to do something like this.

666
00:29:22,069 --> 00:29:23,400
(An example of using their secret weapon)

667
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:26,839
- Oh, my. - Goodness!

668
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,069
Oh, my.

669
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:32,038
How could we not use that?

670
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:33,440
We have to include that.

671
00:29:33,509 --> 00:29:35,149
Our team is very solid.

672
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,309
(They plan to keep their tier with their solid skills.)

673
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:39,519
When we initially assembled our team,

674
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:42,619
we considered everyone's talent like dancing, rapping, and singing.

675
00:29:43,089 --> 00:29:45,048
So we were all covered for each section.

676
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:47,190
We're the most balanced team.

677
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,358
Let's divide up the song now.

678
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:51,459
Okay.

679
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,858
- Can I say something? - Sure.

680
00:29:52,859 --> 00:29:54,029
Here's what we can do.

681
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:56,229
To divide the song, we can go by each line.

682
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:59,000
So this just came to my mind. My lyrics...

683
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,240
I'd like us to divide the song one line at a time.

684
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,069
I see. That's a great idea.

685
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,508
I like that idea.

686
00:30:04,509 --> 00:30:05,739
- Can we try that? - Let's try that.

687
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,880
I love it.

688
00:30:07,309 --> 00:30:08,578
It's up to you.

689
00:30:08,579 --> 00:30:10,179
- One of us should be in the center. - Yes.

690
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,809
- In my opinion, - That?

691
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,220
we can stand in one line.

692
00:30:13,221 --> 00:30:14,849
One person can step to the side after singing a line.

693
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,489
Then the next person can do the same.

694
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:17,689
- Everyone can do the same. - I see.

695
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,288
- If we go with this, - That's good.

696
00:30:19,289 --> 00:30:20,390
it will be more memorable.

697
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:21,720
- We have to... - That sounds good.

698
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,828
- I like it. - That's a great idea.

699
00:30:23,829 --> 00:30:26,028
I think we need a cute guy who will win over...

700
00:30:26,029 --> 00:30:28,329
the hearts of women. With that said, I'd recommend...

701
00:30:28,769 --> 00:30:30,629
- KENSHIN. - I like that.

702
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:32,670
(Recommending KENSHIN to be the ending fairy)

703
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,368
I want him to tilt his head at the end of our performance.

704
00:30:35,369 --> 00:30:36,608
He can do it with a smile.

705
00:30:36,609 --> 00:30:37,710
What do you mean?

706
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:39,079
What do you mean?

707
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:41,508
That's what you have to do.

708
00:30:41,509 --> 00:30:44,679
He already won over our hearts! He did it!

709
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,220
Just do that.

710
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:48,818
Should we go around the room and vote for the ending fairy?

711
00:30:48,819 --> 00:30:50,089
Let's just vote for one person.

712
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,449
I'll vote for KENSHIN.

713
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,519
BINGHUA.

714
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,819
The self-proclaimed best dancer.

715
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:57,460
(The 5 ending fairies for P4 are selected.)

716
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,059
- I'll look forward to it. - Gosh, no.

717
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,869
(He becomes a reliable ending fairy even before they begin.)

718
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,869
It's game over already.

719
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,339
KENSHIN's smile is just...

720
00:31:12,809 --> 00:31:14,480
He's so cute.

721
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,180
Let me have a bite.

722
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:21,519
So adorable.

723
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:22,990
I'm hungry.

724
00:31:22,991 --> 00:31:24,289
Let me also have a bite.

725
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,759
He came over and acted all cute.

726
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:29,089
So I like him.

727
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:31,160
To me, he's a baby.

728
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,759
He's an adorable guy.

729
00:31:33,829 --> 00:31:36,930
(He never stops acting cute even during a break.)

730
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:40,799
(Hogging all the love from the older guys)

731
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,739
KENSHIN was...

732
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,949
one of the biggest secret weapons we had.

733
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,249
(P4's secret weapon, SAKURADA KENSHIN)

734
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,250
They'll see...

735
00:31:52,251 --> 00:31:53,880
our synchronized choreography in the beginning.

736
00:31:54,049 --> 00:31:56,490
Our biggest secret weapon...

737
00:31:57,049 --> 00:31:58,788
to give them an element of surprise...

738
00:31:58,789 --> 00:32:00,789
after our powerful choreography was KENSHIN.

739
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,828
Honestly,

740
00:32:04,829 --> 00:32:06,430
if our team can't win first place with this mission,

741
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:08,630
it would hurt our pride.

742
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,569
(Will P4 be able to stay in 1st Tier?)

743
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:19,039
(P5's training room)

744
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,309
Well done, everyone!

745
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:23,808
You were amazing.

746
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:25,250
And SVIAT.

747
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:28,180
Our youngest won first place.

748
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,449
Let's give him a round of applause.

749
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:31,618
SVIAT! Let's give it up for him.

750
00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:32,920
Thank you.

751
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,058
I want to say to my mom, my older sister,

752
00:32:35,059 --> 00:32:38,229
my second older sister, and my grandmother...

753
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:40,359
that I won first place!

754
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,329
Yes!

755
00:32:43,369 --> 00:32:44,670
You were amazing!

756
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:48,500
MAJINGXIANG helped me the most.

757
00:32:49,309 --> 00:32:51,239
Who wants to record a video to check?

758
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,639
(They were practising for the video evaluation.)

759
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,680
Let's go.

760
00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:57,779
(They partnered up to record a video to check.)

761
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:00,680
How are you so good when you're so young?

762
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,049
I don't know.

763
00:33:03,789 --> 00:33:04,990
I don't know.

764
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,430
You'll do a great job no matter what.

765
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:15,599
(SVIAT improved a lot thanks to his support and compliments.)

766
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,970
We were a good team. Yes.

767
00:33:20,069 --> 00:33:21,200
It was fun.

768
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:24,210
Well done!

769
00:33:24,339 --> 00:33:25,608
(The moment he saw his team was in 2nd place...)

770
00:33:25,609 --> 00:33:27,339
When the team score came up,

771
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,180
I was so grateful to my team.

772
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:33,079
I think I did a good job helping my team as their leader.

773
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:36,689
I wasn't so happy about the result.

774
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:38,618
I just thought we were lucky.

775
00:33:38,619 --> 00:33:40,959
We mostly practised on our own.

776
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,058
A part of me thought that...

777
00:33:43,059 --> 00:33:46,058
if YICHEN spent more time with us and practised as a team together,

778
00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:49,599
we might have gotten a better score. That crossed my mind.

779
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,999
What we're going to do today is very simple.

780
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,199
(Clueless of their feelings, he announces his plan.)

781
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,269
First of all,

782
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,539
I want us to watch the video...

783
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,839
and share ideas.

784
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:03,180
I won't divide the song.

785
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,650
I want it to be fair.

786
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,219
I want other people to have a chance to shine too.

787
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,449
Once our formation and choreography are finalized,

788
00:34:11,619 --> 00:34:14,460
we can vote and divide the song accordingly.

789
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,389
What do you think?

790
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:18,159
- Sounds good. - Isn't this great?

791
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:19,859
I could feel that...

792
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:22,269
YICHEN was trying to work with us now.

793
00:34:22,369 --> 00:34:25,599
I thought that YICHEN was starting to trust us now.

794
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:29,969
(That night at P5's dorm)

795
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:32,078
I'm so tired.

796
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,178
(P5 is resting after their practice.)

797
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:35,078
- Are you all sleeping? - Seriously.

798
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:36,550
I gave my all today.

799
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:41,320
(Meanwhile, Trainee JUNG SEYUN is going somewhere.)

800
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:45,619
They're dividing the song now.

801
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,590
They're dividing the song now.

802
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:50,960
Who?

803
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:54,329
YICHEN, JIHOON, and YOUNGWOONG.

804
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:58,429
It made me wonder if they were doing this right.

805
00:34:59,539 --> 00:35:02,210
After hearing that, I lost trust in him.

806
00:35:04,539 --> 00:35:05,609
Come in.

807
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:08,110
(Meanwhile, they're assigning the parts in YICHEN's room.)

808
00:35:08,309 --> 00:35:09,879
- Hey. - It's nothing.

809
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,178
- You startled me. - What's that?

810
00:35:11,179 --> 00:35:12,750
- Hey, come in. - Everyone heard.

811
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,489
They asked me why I divided the song.

812
00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:16,619
But as their leader,

813
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:19,119
I had to make decisions quickly, so we could proceed fast.

814
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,989
I couldn't let that confuse me or affect our practice.

815
00:35:22,889 --> 00:35:24,328
- Like I told you, - Come here.

816
00:35:24,329 --> 00:35:25,730
except for the rap part,

817
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,900
everyone should sing the song together.

818
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,899
No. For parts like this, we won't sing them together.

819
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,230
We'll only sing as a group for this part.

820
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:33,769
- There are other parts. - But the lyrics will change.

821
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:35,738
Let's say someone sings it alone and gets the lyrics wrong.

822
00:35:35,739 --> 00:35:36,840
Let's say he gets the lyrics wrong.

823
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:38,638
In my opinion, someone is bound to make a mistake.

824
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:41,038
What? That kind of thinking is the problem.

825
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:42,479
But we all made mistakes in the video evaluation.

826
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,380
No. Our team can't make mistakes.

827
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:48,519
We'll break the parts in these places.

828
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,118
I'm not sure if this will work.

829
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:51,349
Right. We should do that there.

830
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:53,558
Everyone, face me.

831
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:54,919
(P5's training room the next day)

832
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,729
ATILLA, SUNGJUN...

833
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:58,928
(YICHEN proceeds based on the way he divided the song.)

834
00:35:58,929 --> 00:36:00,159
YOUNGWOONG.

835
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:02,800
Let's go with this. JIMIN. You come in too.

836
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:05,229
And the rest of you can step to the side.

837
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,440
(A lot of the trainees are excluded.)

838
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:10,309
But I don't think AOM has any parts in this song.

839
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:12,940
Did you have a part?

840
00:36:13,809 --> 00:36:14,940
AOM didn't get any parts?

841
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,678
Then join them.

842
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:18,849
(He adds AOM at the last minute.)

843
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,249
I wasn't greedy about the parts.

844
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:23,649
Since it's a team performance, I thought creating...

845
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:25,690
a performance together was more important.

846
00:36:30,389 --> 00:36:32,089
Can one of you step out? You, get out.

847
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:33,230
SUNGJUN. Can you step out?

848
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,629
Let's go with this combination.

849
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,499
Five, six, seven, eight.

850
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,500
(SUNGJUN was excluded from this part.)

851
00:36:40,969 --> 00:36:42,638
But JIMIN, if you perform like that...

852
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:44,610
But SUNGJUN barely got any parts.

853
00:36:45,139 --> 00:36:47,679
Hold on. Don't worry about that. I'll assign everyone's parts.

854
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,808
When I tried to speak up, he said, "No, that's not it."

855
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:52,749
He just interrupted me.

856
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:53,980
- So that was tough. - Let's try again.

857
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,589
Five, six...

858
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,449
JIMIN. If that's how you'll perform, step out.

859
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,419
- I'll just step out. - No.

860
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,920
- I'll just step out. - No.

861
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,360
Tomorrow is the evaluation. You can't do that.

862
00:37:04,659 --> 00:37:06,730
But when you look at the overall picture,

863
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:08,899
- one of us should... - No, it's not about the formation.

864
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,829
I don't like the expression on your face.

865
00:37:13,139 --> 00:37:17,769
(There is tension in the air in an instant.)

866
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:22,479
Let me speak first.

867
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,980
I know that you're doing your best.

868
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,319
I don't have a problem with that.

869
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,989
I know that you're working hard.

870
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:33,159
But I don't want you to get hurt by this.

871
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:36,359
We don't hate you. It's nothing like that.

872
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,059
But when you talked to the group,

873
00:37:39,099 --> 00:37:40,799
you had an aggressive tone.

874
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,269
And you said some things that were hurtful...

875
00:37:43,369 --> 00:37:47,440
not only to young trainees but to other trainees as well.

876
00:37:48,139 --> 00:37:50,539
Get out! Go home!

877
00:37:50,809 --> 00:37:53,210
Stop talking. Come in. Just you.

878
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,480
I was trying...

879
00:37:55,949 --> 00:37:59,050
to fulfil my duty as their leader.

880
00:37:59,849 --> 00:38:00,979
But it's tough.

881
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,489
It's hard.

882
00:38:04,989 --> 00:38:06,090
I volunteered...

883
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:08,519
to be their leader.

884
00:38:08,989 --> 00:38:11,360
I'm quite experienced in leading groups like this.

885
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,698
- I only thought about... - Thank you.

886
00:38:14,699 --> 00:38:17,030
and wanted to help my team.

887
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:19,238
It all started with my wish...

888
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:22,340
to share some of my skills with the younger trainees.

889
00:38:23,139 --> 00:38:24,170
But...

890
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:27,738
I couldn't meet their expectations.

891
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:29,480
So I feel incredibly sorry about that.

892
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,809
That's what I felt bad about the most.

893
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:37,889
And earlier,

894
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:40,158
- what I said... - It's okay.

895
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:41,889
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

896
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:44,559
Gosh, it's okay. You did well.

897
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:46,959
I totally understand.

898
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,029
You were speaking up for the team.

899
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:53,070
(Now that they reconciled, how will P5 perform together?)

900
00:38:55,969 --> 00:38:58,340
(Morning has broken at Project Village.)

901
00:38:59,309 --> 00:39:01,309
(8am)

902
00:39:02,849 --> 00:39:05,780
(The trainees are still asleep.)

903
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:14,920
(At that moment,)

904
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,929
(a siren goes off without a warning.)

905
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:23,900
We'll play a game called Run to the Training Room Now.

906
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,940
We'll play a game called Run to the Training Room Now.

907
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:31,570
(But these sleepyheads won't even budge at the siren.)

908
00:39:32,539 --> 00:39:34,638
We'll play a game called Run to the Training Room Now.

909
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:35,679
(Whatever.)

910
00:39:36,179 --> 00:39:39,979
The first team to arrive at the front of the building...

911
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:42,280
will get a special present.

912
00:39:42,789 --> 00:39:45,150
You must be fully dressed in your training uniform.

913
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:47,690
Everyone on your team must be present.

914
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:51,329
We can't go a day without any surprises.

915
00:39:51,829 --> 00:39:54,199
If we hurry over to the training room,

916
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:56,230
we'll get a very good gift.

917
00:39:56,429 --> 00:39:58,099
Okay? So hurry up.

918
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:01,269
Come on, hurry.

919
00:40:02,539 --> 00:40:04,610
- Hurry. - Hurry up.

920
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:09,179
I'm already sweating. Oh, no. My shoelaces.

921
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:12,848
(CHOI JUYOUNG is the 1st one to set out.)

922
00:40:12,849 --> 00:40:15,789
(The cameraman has to run as well?)

923
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:18,250
(Let's just run!)

924
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:27,429
(The cameraman is panting.)

925
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:30,969
(He gives up on filming JUYOUNG.)

926
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:34,840
(He truly is the former captain of a baseball team.)

927
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:36,539
Come on!

928
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:39,309
Gosh.

929
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:40,879
I'm the first one!

930
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,509
(JUYOUNG is the 1st one to arrive.)

931
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:44,050
- What? We're the first ones here? - My gosh.

932
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,280
First!

933
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:48,550
(Will P4 win 1st place?)

934
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,988
They're all the same.

935
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,090
What are those?

936
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:53,519
(The winning prize of the wake-up mission)

937
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,559
- It's soda. - Coffee.

938
00:40:55,889 --> 00:40:58,630
(All kinds of beverages and snacks)

939
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:01,929
(But they can only win the prize if everyone on their team arrives.)

940
00:41:02,429 --> 00:41:03,729
We must win this one.

941
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:04,769
(Getting competitive)

942
00:41:05,699 --> 00:41:07,238
Guys, we don't have time to dry our hair.

943
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:08,400
Let's just get dressed and go.

944
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:09,669
Let's just get dressed and go.

945
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:11,339
If you don't have one, just grab a hat. It's fine.

946
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:13,539
Let's just use the natural wind to dry our hair.

947
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,908
- So... - How many?

948
00:41:15,909 --> 00:41:17,679
One, two, three, four...

949
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,849
- Let's go down. - Let's go down.

950
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:22,889
We have to go.

951
00:41:22,989 --> 00:41:24,849
My gosh. Seriously.

952
00:41:25,389 --> 00:41:26,659
What is all this?

953
00:41:32,829 --> 00:41:34,599
My gosh, this is so hard.

954
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:39,269
(People who arrived by 8:40am, P5: 3 trainees, P4: 8 trainees)

955
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,598
Run!

956
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,809
(The trainees hurriedly run over.)

957
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:46,678
(Trainee HOU GUANYI is still half asleep.)

958
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:48,179
- Let's go. - Hey.

959
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:00,889
- We have to go. - We must run.

960
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:03,630
Which way?

961
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,459
Gosh. What's going on?

962
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:09,329
(They're running at full speed. Which team will win 1st place?)

963
00:42:10,869 --> 00:42:12,599
You have ten minutes left.

964
00:42:12,769 --> 00:42:13,999
- Go. - Let's go.

965
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,399
- Let's go. - Let's go.

966
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,369
(Team P1, 8:50am)

967
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:19,309
Over here!

968
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,380
- Do you want me to carry you? - It's okay.

969
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:24,980
Hold on.

970
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:29,589
- Let's go. - Be careful.

971
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:31,319
- Let's go. - Let's go.

972
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,658
- Two, four, six, eight, ten. - Hello.

973
00:42:33,659 --> 00:42:34,690
(P5: 4 trainees, P4: 19 trainees, P3: 2 trainees)

974
00:42:35,659 --> 00:42:37,059
So we're just missing one person?

975
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:38,189
- Really? - Let's go.

976
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:40,059
- So we're only missing BINGHUA? - Where's JIWOON?

977
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:44,630
(A mysterious sound comes out from the empty dorm.)

978
00:42:44,699 --> 00:42:47,699
(Tapping)

979
00:42:47,769 --> 00:42:49,269
(Tapping at full power)

980
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:51,639
So we're only missing BINGHUA?

981
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:54,480
What's taking BINGHUA so long?

982
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:57,050
BINGHUA!

983
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:00,449
- BINGHUA. - Yes.

984
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:01,920
(Sighing)

985
00:43:03,349 --> 00:43:05,989
Hey! Is contouring your face so important right now?

986
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,960
(BINGHUA of P4 sets out.)

987
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:14,760
(Which team will arrive first?)

988
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:16,698
- Over here! - Isn't that him? Right?

989
00:43:16,699 --> 00:43:18,368
- Over here! - Isn't that him? Right?

990
00:43:18,369 --> 00:43:20,369
(Someone has arrived.)

991
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:22,739
- There are so many people. - Come on!

992
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:24,070
Over here!

993
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:25,308
- Hey! - Hello.

994
00:43:25,309 --> 00:43:27,079
(Which team has gathered first?)

995
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:30,578
(Everyone in P1 has arrived.)

996
00:43:30,579 --> 00:43:32,349
- Hello. - Hello.

997
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,078
Hey, you're the last one.

998
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,119
(The trainees from other teams rush over after them.)

999
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:38,848
BINGHUA!

1000
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:39,960
(BINGHUA of P4 also arrives.)

1001
00:43:40,059 --> 00:43:41,760
The team that arrived first...

1002
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:43,428
was P1.

1003
00:43:43,429 --> 00:43:46,130
(P1 wins.)

1004
00:43:48,429 --> 00:43:49,730
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1005
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:54,469
(The snacks are all ours.)

1006
00:43:55,269 --> 00:43:56,939
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1007
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,869
- Running in the morning paid off. - Thank you.

1008
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:00,179
Let's go.

1009
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:01,840
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1010
00:44:01,909 --> 00:44:02,979
- Let's go. - We got this.

1011
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,380
Let's do it energetically. Give me everything you've got!

1012
00:44:05,849 --> 00:44:07,650
All right. Stay sharp.

1013
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:08,819
Let's have fun.

1014
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,989
"I'm having the most fun in the world."

1015
00:44:11,389 --> 00:44:13,359
It's okay. We got this.

1016
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,360
- Should we try it again? - Let's go!

1017
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,260
- Hey! Let's go! - Hey! Let's go!

1018
00:44:17,889 --> 00:44:19,029
- Let's try again. - Hey.

1019
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:20,598
(Which team...)

1020
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:22,198
(will win the 1st Tier Zone?)

1021
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:23,800
Our practice session is going so well today.

1022
00:44:24,099 --> 00:44:25,829
- Four. - We're almost done.

1023
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:27,300
Let's go.

1024
00:44:28,369 --> 00:44:29,539
Let's show them.

1025
00:44:30,269 --> 00:44:33,980
(The day of the team evaluation)

1026
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:36,279
Hello.

1027
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,709
- Hello. - Hello.

1028
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:39,178
How are all of you?

1029
00:44:39,179 --> 00:44:40,249
- We're good. - We're good.

1030
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:43,119
It's finally the day of the team evaluation.

1031
00:44:46,789 --> 00:44:49,888
So did you guys prepare cool performances for us?

1032
00:44:49,889 --> 00:44:51,090
- Yes. - Yes.

1033
00:44:51,389 --> 00:44:53,300
I love the energy in your voices.

1034
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:59,399
Let's start with P1. Come on out.

1035
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,400
(P1 will perform 1st.)

1036
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:05,840
- Let's go. - Let's go!

1037
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,178
Good luck!

1038
00:45:08,179 --> 00:45:09,849
- Good luck! - You got this.

1039
00:45:10,449 --> 00:45:13,578
(A while ago,)

1040
00:45:13,579 --> 00:45:16,449
(they did a draw to decide the order of the performances.)

1041
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:18,889
- Okay. - Yes.

1042
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,189
- P1! - Okay. It's not bad.

1043
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:23,630
- Nice! - It's okay!

1044
00:45:23,659 --> 00:45:24,659
Good luck.

1045
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:26,559
(That's how P1 ended up going 1st.)

1046
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:28,630
They're the biggest threat.

1047
00:45:29,099 --> 00:45:31,800
The majority of the team is in the high ranks.

1048
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:33,969
It's impossible not to feel threatened by them.

1049
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,698
Here's our team introduction.

1050
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:36,709
P1!

1051
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:38,309
- Run! - Run!

1052
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:39,979
Hello, we're P1.

1053
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:41,738
- Hello. - Hello.

1054
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:42,948
Check out their energy.

1055
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:44,550
- I like it. - They're full of energy.

1056
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:46,980
- Let's go! - That's so cool.

1057
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,178
P1.

1058
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:51,920
Many of you are experienced.

1059
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:56,289
From what I heard, you guys called yourselves the Avengers.

1060
00:45:56,659 --> 00:45:58,489
But your team was ranked third.

1061
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:00,098
- Yes, that's right. - Yes.

1062
00:46:00,099 --> 00:46:02,199
Do you feel confident about your performance this time?

1063
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,499
We're very confident. After having placed third,

1064
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,868
the members of my team became very determined.

1065
00:46:06,869 --> 00:46:08,799
I saw this intense gaze from them.

1066
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,268
We prepared for this performance with everything we've got.

1067
00:46:10,269 --> 00:46:11,269
We're confident.

1068
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:13,238
All right then. P1.

1069
00:46:13,239 --> 00:46:15,339
Let's begin your team evaluation.

1070
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:16,609
Show us what you've got.

1071
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:18,408
Everyone, don't be nervous.

1072
00:46:18,409 --> 00:46:20,049
- Okay. - We have each other.

1073
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:21,649
Don't make mistakes. We must impress them right away.

1074
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:22,848
- Okay - We can do this.

1075
00:46:22,849 --> 00:46:24,190
- Let's have fun. I mean it. - Okay.

1076
00:46:24,619 --> 00:46:27,288
I wanted to redeem ourselves with the team evaluation...

1077
00:46:27,289 --> 00:46:30,029
and reach the First Tier Zone.

1078
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:33,198
We were really resolute to achieve our goal.

1079
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:34,199
One, two, three.

1080
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,599
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1081
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:38,699
We're amazing performers. We prepared a lot for this.

1082
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,598
So I wanted to put on...

1083
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:42,199
a great performance for the other 80 trainees.

1084
00:46:42,969 --> 00:46:44,840
I'll crush it.

1085
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:52,010
(How will P1 perform for their team evaluation?)

1086
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:07,730
Are we looking at the same team from before?

1087
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:14,840
They look cool.

1088
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,239
- How clean. - Yes.

1089
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:23,510
(P1's dance break)

1090
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:26,679
- Gosh. - Okay!

1091
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:30,049
(We can beat them.)

1092
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:31,119
Ours is better...

1093
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:41,300
(Everyone gets nervous.)

1094
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,230
Don't let that get to us.

1095
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:46,500
- Who is that? - My gosh, what is this?

1096
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:49,340
I like their formation.

1097
00:47:51,139 --> 00:47:53,880
(Run with me, baby)

1098
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,749
(Tell me what you want, and I'll make it happen)

1099
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:59,550
(Even if we hit a dead end and fall down, we'll get back up)

1100
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:04,218
(The timing is up to you, the time to run)

1101
00:48:04,219 --> 00:48:07,719
(Call HYUNWOO, everyone, a little more)

1102
00:48:31,449 --> 00:48:32,480
Let's go.

1103
00:48:34,619 --> 00:48:36,719
Nice formation.

1104
00:48:41,989 --> 00:48:43,059
- They did well. - Great.

1105
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,299
They prepared a lot.

1106
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:48,500
- I was so surprised. - They did a great job.

1107
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:50,769
- My gosh. - That was amazing.

1108
00:48:50,869 --> 00:48:52,000
- Gosh. - That was great.

1109
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:53,869
- Gosh. - Goodness, they were good.

1110
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:56,269
- That was so cool. - They were so good.

1111
00:48:56,369 --> 00:48:57,669
That was the real deal.

1112
00:48:57,670 --> 00:48:59,980
- That was so cool. - They were amazing.

1113
00:49:03,809 --> 00:49:04,948
Well done.

1114
00:49:04,949 --> 00:49:06,550
- Good job. - Good work.

1115
00:49:08,719 --> 00:49:09,949
- It was good. - Good job.

1116
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:13,658
Let me talk about the choreography first.

1117
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:16,189
There are so many things I want to compliment you on.

1118
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:18,158
I was simply impressed during your performance...

1119
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:20,698
because there were great elements in your choreography.

1120
00:49:20,699 --> 00:49:22,558
But at the same time, they weren't over-the-top.

1121
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,729
These elements in your choreography...

1122
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:26,839
naturally shifted the focus to the center.

1123
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,038
And to be honest, this is a very difficult thing to pull off.

1124
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:31,569
It's a challenge even for professional choreographers.

1125
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:33,639
But you did a great job in that aspect.

1126
00:49:33,809 --> 00:49:35,609
Overall, I would say that your team was successful...

1127
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:37,408
regarding your teamwork, choreography, and performance.

1128
00:49:37,409 --> 00:49:40,079
Not a single aspect of your team was disappointing.

1129
00:49:40,119 --> 00:49:41,179
Did you see that?

1130
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:42,920
That's us.

1131
00:49:43,389 --> 00:49:44,649
Talk about killing our confidence.

1132
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:45,789
- I feel bad for the next team. - Gosh.

1133
00:49:45,989 --> 00:49:47,019
Which team is going next?

1134
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,690
Next team. Please get ready.

1135
00:49:49,059 --> 00:49:50,158
- Okay. - Okay.

1136
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:52,328
- Let's go! - Let's do this.

1137
00:49:52,329 --> 00:49:54,429
(P3 will perform after P1.)

1138
00:49:54,929 --> 00:49:57,369
- They're P3? The team in 1st place? - They're P3.

1139
00:49:57,429 --> 00:49:58,800
- No, They were ranked last. - They were ranked last.

1140
00:50:01,769 --> 00:50:03,340
I don't think they can do a good job.

1141
00:50:03,969 --> 00:50:05,908
Let us introduce ourselves. P3!

1142
00:50:05,909 --> 00:50:08,179
- Let's crush it. Peace. - Let's crush it. Peace.

1143
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,349
(Silent)

1144
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,179
- Hello, we're P3. - Hello, we're P3.

1145
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:15,320
(Glancing)

1146
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:17,250
I think your teamwork is off.

1147
00:50:17,949 --> 00:50:19,690
You guys didn't answer as a group.

1148
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:21,590
"Oh, no. We're doomed."

1149
00:50:22,289 --> 00:50:24,929
P1 set the bar too high.

1150
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:26,759
- They're bound to be nervous. - Right.

1151
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,329
- They might even feel intimidated. - Yes.

1152
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:30,230
Our team was ranked last.

1153
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:34,070
I accepted that. So I just focused on how we could only go up.

1154
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:36,570
The only thing on my mind this time was achieving a higher tier.

1155
00:50:36,639 --> 00:50:39,639
I thought we had one more chance.

1156
00:50:39,739 --> 00:50:41,538
I'll treat this as our last chance.

1157
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:43,710
And we'll win first place no matter what.

1158
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:49,179
(How will P3 perform for the team evaluation?)

1159
00:50:57,559 --> 00:50:58,690
(I like you)

1160
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:00,730
That was cute.

1161
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:16,210
(Screaming)

1162
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:18,610
What was that?

1163
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:23,219
(A dance break with KANG WANGSEOK's roar)

1164
00:51:23,889 --> 00:51:25,149
They gave it all to one member.

1165
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:26,889
- Did they plan this? - They did.

1166
00:51:27,659 --> 00:51:28,960
That's totally cool.

1167
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:35,360
They're almost like a pro idol group.

1168
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:42,969
Great formation.

1169
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:48,380
What's that?

1170
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:50,280
What's that?

1171
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:22,139
Goodness.

1172
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:44,800
Trainee HA SEOKHEE.

1173
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:46,469
Is your throat okay?

1174
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:48,469
Is your throat okay?

1175
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,239
- My voice... - I see, you lost your voice.

1176
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:53,579
- It's okay. - It's okay.

1177
00:52:55,179 --> 00:52:56,280
It's okay.

1178
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:02,449
You did well. It's okay. Don't cry.

1179
00:53:03,849 --> 00:53:06,050
I felt really bad for my team members.

1180
00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:09,789
I thought, "What if they go to the Shadow Zone..."

1181
00:53:09,929 --> 00:53:12,090
"and have no parts..."

1182
00:53:12,659 --> 00:53:14,460
"and don't get filmed?"

1183
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:19,368
"That means I ruined all 19 members' lives."

1184
00:53:19,369 --> 00:53:21,239
I couldn't get myself together.

1185
00:53:25,139 --> 00:53:26,739
SEOKHEE, it's okay.

1186
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:28,639
You did well.

1187
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:34,320
- He must be really upset. - I get how he feels.

1188
00:53:35,849 --> 00:53:36,989
It's okay, don't cry.

1189
00:53:38,789 --> 00:53:39,849
I feel bad for him.

1190
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,260
You guys placed fifth.

1191
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:47,198
It's my first time seeing your performance today.

1192
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:51,300
But you didn't look like a team that placed fifth.

1193
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:56,299
To compare you to the other teams,

1194
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:59,368
P1 did a good job...

1195
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:01,909
with their teamwork and made it neat.

1196
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:05,209
P3 had various formations...

1197
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:09,018
and made them memorable by giving the dance break to one.

1198
00:54:09,019 --> 00:54:10,518
I personally liked your performance better...

1199
00:54:10,519 --> 00:54:12,320
because your performance was focused on variety.

1200
00:54:12,449 --> 00:54:13,658
I was determined...

1201
00:54:13,659 --> 00:54:16,558
to show the directors...

1202
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:17,730
how much we could improve.

1203
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:19,928
I think that's what moved them.

1204
00:54:19,929 --> 00:54:21,929
We achieved our goal.

1205
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,400
I was really relieved.

1206
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:27,269
That's it.

1207
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:32,309
Next, P2. Please get ready.

1208
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:34,539
We'll begin with our introduction.

1209
00:54:34,809 --> 00:54:37,808
Guys, move out of the way. Honk, honk.

1210
00:54:37,809 --> 00:54:39,279
- P2, P2. - P2, P2.

1211
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,579
- Hello, we're P2. - Hello, we're P2.

1212
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,820
Gosh, their voices are amazing.

1213
00:54:45,289 --> 00:54:47,158
- They have great voices. - Yes, that's pretty cool.

1214
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:49,360
S ranked Trainee KIM TAEYU.

1215
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:53,558
Your team is in fourth place.

1216
00:54:53,559 --> 00:54:56,098
Do you think you could join the First Tier Zone?

1217
00:54:56,099 --> 00:54:58,300
Yes, I think we'll move up after this performance.

1218
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:01,900
I like your confidence.

1219
00:55:04,869 --> 00:55:06,638
We had to subvert their expectations.

1220
00:55:06,639 --> 00:55:07,739
I thought this was our chance.

1221
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:10,150
We could show it here.

1222
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:17,389
(How will P2 perform?)

1223
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:30,829
We're no match for SOTA.

1224
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:44,809
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1225
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:48,150
(P2's dance break)

1226
00:55:55,659 --> 00:55:57,789
(What's with them?)

1227
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,098
(We're only looking forward and running)

1228
00:56:04,099 --> 00:56:06,670
(Just follow me, just lean on me like that)

1229
00:56:18,010 --> 00:56:19,449
(What do you want me to be?)

1230
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,039
They did a good job with that.

1231
00:56:58,119 --> 00:56:59,250
"Let it go."

1232
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:01,259
- What did he say? - HYUNGSEOK.

1233
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:02,420
What did the last guy say?

1234
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:04,090
- Did he say "Let it go?" - "Let it go?"

1235
00:57:04,389 --> 00:57:05,460
"Let it go?"

1236
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:06,960
Why did he sound so cute?

1237
00:57:07,630 --> 00:57:08,800
Elsa.

1238
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:11,000
(Studying the faces of others)

1239
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,698
I couldn't remember the last part of the lyrics.

1240
00:57:13,699 --> 00:57:15,570
I just said whatever came to my mind at that moment.

1241
00:57:19,739 --> 00:57:20,809
"Let it go."

1242
00:57:24,309 --> 00:57:27,019
Who's the one that did tumbling?

1243
00:57:27,650 --> 00:57:29,079
- It was JOONWOO. - JOONWOO.

1244
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:30,948
It's so fascinating...

1245
00:57:30,949 --> 00:57:33,889
how each team's tumbling skills are gradually improving.

1246
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:37,389
(Trainee JEONG DEUNHAESOL's back tumbling)

1247
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:41,400
(Trainee KIM MINJUN's double tumbling)

1248
00:57:42,929 --> 00:57:46,170
(Trainee KIM JOONWOO's tumbling in the air)

1249
00:57:47,139 --> 00:57:51,239
(The team performances keep improving.)

1250
00:57:54,139 --> 00:57:57,050
Did you practice it?

1251
00:57:57,150 --> 00:58:00,650
I was on the national taekwondo demonstration team last year.

1252
00:58:02,619 --> 00:58:03,619
(Feeling shy)

1253
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:05,489
No, MINJUN. Yours was cool. You did well.

1254
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:07,260
- It was cool. - Okay.

1255
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:10,159
I thought I should show my level...

1256
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:14,299
to prove my skills.

1257
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:16,360
(KIM TAESUNG is part of the national taekwondo demonstration team.)

1258
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:20,840
- Great. - TAESUNG, you have a rival.

1259
00:58:20,869 --> 00:58:23,039
I'll show you an even better one.

1260
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:29,440
You all did well,

1261
00:58:29,539 --> 00:58:32,279
but there were things that could be improved.

1262
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,980
(There were parts that could be improved.)

1263
00:58:36,619 --> 00:58:38,320
HEEDO, you made a mistake earlier.

1264
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:40,519
I said that you made a mistake.

1265
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:41,960
I just froze when he said that.

1266
00:58:43,059 --> 00:58:46,859
During a formation change in the last chorus,

1267
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:49,530
I moved a beat faster.

1268
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:51,230
I was embarrassed.

1269
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:53,840
I was supposed to do better than the others.

1270
00:58:54,639 --> 00:58:56,698
I wish you could've danced...

1271
00:58:56,699 --> 00:59:01,079
while thinking about how this song could be delivered.

1272
00:59:01,239 --> 00:59:03,110
You didn't have to be so serious about it.

1273
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:04,610
But you were too serious.

1274
00:59:05,179 --> 00:59:07,719
I was really upset.

1275
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:11,219
We practised really hard.

1276
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:15,619
Next, P5. Please get ready.

1277
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:16,928
Two, three.

1278
00:59:16,929 --> 00:59:18,788
- High-five. P5! - High-five. P5!

1279
00:59:18,789 --> 00:59:21,429
- Hello, we're P5. - Hello, we're P5.

1280
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:24,269
Hello.

1281
00:59:24,829 --> 00:59:26,729
This team seems to have a lot of foreigners.

1282
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:27,868
- I know. - Right?

1283
00:59:27,869 --> 00:59:28,869
This team...

1284
00:59:28,870 --> 00:59:30,840
- has a lot of foreigners. - One, two...

1285
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:33,009
It'll be amazing if they pull it off.

1286
00:59:33,010 --> 00:59:34,409
They don't even speak the language.

1287
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:37,279
Before going up the stage,

1288
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:41,718
I was really confident that our team would be able to do it.

1289
00:59:41,719 --> 00:59:45,719
I would like our team to place 1st or 2nd place.

1290
00:59:45,849 --> 00:59:47,420
- High-five. P5! - High-five. P5!

1291
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:51,929
- Let's go. - High-five. P5! We're the best.

1292
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:53,760
Let's go!

1293
00:59:55,329 --> 00:59:56,759
(How will P5 perform?)

1294
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:57,929
(Testing the mic)

1295
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:00,468
(Are they testing their mics...)

1296
01:00:00,469 --> 01:00:02,739
(right as the song is about to start?)

1297
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:17,820
They're good.

1298
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:32,229
(P5's dance break)

1299
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:34,269
- Let's go! - They're good.

1300
01:00:36,769 --> 01:00:37,840
- P5! - P5!

1301
01:00:56,489 --> 01:00:58,829
(The center member, YICHEN, showed up late.)

1302
01:01:04,570 --> 01:01:06,070
These are the things that set the other teams apart.

1303
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:16,909
That's cute.

1304
01:01:44,139 --> 01:01:46,010
(Exclaiming)

1305
01:01:48,010 --> 01:01:51,409
The directors don't look too happy about it.

1306
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:55,619
When I saw you during the interim check,

1307
01:01:55,719 --> 01:01:57,888
your energy was great,

1308
01:01:57,889 --> 01:02:01,420
so I remember giving you a pretty high score.

1309
01:02:02,590 --> 01:02:05,328
But when I saw you as a group just now,

1310
01:02:05,329 --> 01:02:07,599
I thought the details were a little off.

1311
01:02:07,659 --> 01:02:09,429
Overall,

1312
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:12,199
the quality of the dancing was a little lacking.

1313
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:15,839
To be honest, the other teams seemed to have decided...

1314
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:18,939
on little things like hand angles and how low they'd stoop.

1315
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:21,238
I regret that we didn't prepare...

1316
01:02:21,239 --> 01:02:24,250
the performance in as much detail.

1317
01:02:25,179 --> 01:02:27,980
I felt bad for our team members.

1318
01:02:29,519 --> 01:02:31,449
I thought we could've done better.

1319
01:02:32,849 --> 01:02:35,389
All right. It's the last team.

1320
01:02:36,019 --> 01:02:38,130
P4. Please get ready.

1321
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:39,190
- Okay. - Okay.

1322
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:40,190
Let's go!

1323
01:02:40,730 --> 01:02:41,900
Let's go!

1324
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:43,659
They placed first.

1325
01:02:43,730 --> 01:02:44,969
Focus.

1326
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:47,399
I thought we needed to beat P4...

1327
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:50,138
to be in the First Tier Zone,

1328
01:02:50,139 --> 01:02:51,539
so I was most wary of them.

1329
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:55,078
I knew all the skilled trainees were on that team,

1330
01:02:55,079 --> 01:02:56,480
so I was nervous.

1331
01:02:57,449 --> 01:02:58,649
I think they'll do well.

1332
01:02:58,650 --> 01:03:00,379
(Everyone is watchful of P4 as they placed 1st.)

1333
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:01,519
We'll begin our introduction.

1334
01:03:01,679 --> 01:03:03,149
We are... Two, three.

1335
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:05,348
We'll win over the hearts of World Assemblers.

1336
01:03:05,349 --> 01:03:07,260
We're P4! I'm sorry.

1337
01:03:08,119 --> 01:03:12,829
(Laughing)

1338
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:15,960
Do it again.

1339
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:17,869
- I'm sorry. - You can do it.

1340
01:03:17,969 --> 01:03:19,070
It's okay.

1341
01:03:20,230 --> 01:03:22,698
Hello. We are... Two, three.

1342
01:03:22,699 --> 01:03:26,010
We'll win over the hearts of World Assemblers. We're P4.

1343
01:03:26,039 --> 01:03:29,809
- P4. - P4.

1344
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:32,510
That's cute.

1345
01:03:32,610 --> 01:03:34,250
- Trainee KENSHIN. - Yes.

1346
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:38,589
Were there any fun incidents during your practice?

1347
01:03:38,590 --> 01:03:40,119
Please share one with us.

1348
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:41,920
Wait.

1349
01:03:42,119 --> 01:03:44,029
- Wait. - I'm sorry.

1350
01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:45,059
I'll wait.

1351
01:03:46,130 --> 01:03:47,959
- Wait. - Wait.

1352
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:49,730
- He looked at me as he said it. - I should wait.

1353
01:03:50,230 --> 01:03:51,598
It's, "Please wait."

1354
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:53,070
Please wait.

1355
01:03:53,769 --> 01:03:55,000
He's provoking me.

1356
01:03:55,269 --> 01:03:56,500
My friend...

1357
01:03:58,039 --> 01:04:00,839
(Translating)

1358
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:01,840
Taught.

1359
01:04:02,110 --> 01:04:03,279
Taught me...

1360
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:04,610
- A word. - a word.

1361
01:04:04,909 --> 01:04:06,510
- There's a word he taught me. - There's a word he taught me.

1362
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:07,820
Tell us.

1363
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:09,820
I'll speak informally too.

1364
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:12,018
First one.

1365
01:04:12,019 --> 01:04:13,218
(The 1st Korean word)

1366
01:04:13,219 --> 01:04:14,960
I'm awesome.

1367
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:17,288
- "Awesome." - "Awesome."

1368
01:04:17,289 --> 01:04:19,058
(Word meaning amazing, charming, addictive)

1369
01:04:19,059 --> 01:04:21,059
- I thought I heard it wrong. - What does it mean?

1370
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:23,059
- Who taught you that? - "Awesome."

1371
01:04:23,429 --> 01:04:24,500
Second one.

1372
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:25,800
Refreshing.

1373
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:26,800
(The 2nd Korean word)

1374
01:04:26,801 --> 01:04:28,840
I'm cool.

1375
01:04:30,139 --> 01:04:31,570
I get that.

1376
01:04:31,869 --> 01:04:33,339
- "Cool." - "Cool?"

1377
01:04:33,340 --> 01:04:34,940
- "I'm cool." - That's cute.

1378
01:04:35,409 --> 01:04:38,209
Girls, please cook...

1379
01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:39,848
- "Assemble." - Assemble.

1380
01:04:39,849 --> 01:04:41,519
- Assemble me. - Assemble me.

1381
01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:46,848
- Girls, please assemble. - Girls, please assemble him.

1382
01:04:46,849 --> 01:04:48,019
(That's all for the Korean words he learned.)

1383
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:50,928
All right, now. P4.

1384
01:04:50,929 --> 01:04:52,860
Your team evaluation will begin now.

1385
01:04:53,630 --> 01:04:55,959
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1386
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:57,099
Let's go!

1387
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:02,538
All the time we spent on our practice...

1388
01:05:02,539 --> 01:05:06,510
and the amount we practised are reflected in our confidence.

1389
01:05:06,739 --> 01:05:08,909
- Go, P4! - Go, P4!

1390
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:13,110
If we just show them confidently without getting nervous,

1391
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:15,119
we'll be able to take the First Tier Zone.

1392
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:20,760
(How will P4 perform?)

1393
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:46,079
They're really good.

1394
01:05:49,349 --> 01:05:51,919
(P4's dance break)

1395
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:52,920
They're all doing it together.

1396
01:05:53,619 --> 01:05:55,519
- Look. - They're good.

1397
01:06:03,159 --> 01:06:04,769
(Did you see that?)

1398
01:06:19,679 --> 01:06:21,320
I can only hear YOONSUE's voice.

1399
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:25,249
(Watch P4 perform, we pray again desperately)

1400
01:06:25,250 --> 01:06:27,119
(Keep going, keep your head up)

1401
01:06:27,789 --> 01:06:28,960
(I'm right here)

1402
01:06:30,590 --> 01:06:31,760
"I'm right here."

1403
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:33,860
- The center member is different. - Go!

1404
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:39,698
They simplified the moves...

1405
01:06:39,699 --> 01:06:41,300
so they could be in sync. They did well.

1406
01:06:48,639 --> 01:06:51,380
(The high-note parts are for KIM YOONSUE and SHIN JAEWON.)

1407
01:07:16,969 --> 01:07:19,509
- They did well. - They're good.

1408
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:20,609
(Applauding)

1409
01:07:20,610 --> 01:07:22,578
(Applauding)

1410
01:07:22,579 --> 01:07:24,550
- They did well. - That was crazy.

1411
01:07:24,610 --> 01:07:25,849
They'll win first place for sure.

1412
01:07:26,349 --> 01:07:29,250
The skills of the individuals have a big gap in this team.

1413
01:07:29,519 --> 01:07:31,019
You hid that...

1414
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:35,589
and made me feel that you have great teamwork.

1415
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:37,888
You were really smart with the formations.

1416
01:07:37,889 --> 01:07:40,759
The center members led the team,

1417
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:44,169
and the members on the sides danced like crazy.

1418
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:47,198
And someone was singing really well on the side.

1419
01:07:47,199 --> 01:07:49,698
I think the balance of the team was amazing.

1420
01:07:49,699 --> 01:07:51,940
It was a performance expected of a first-place team.

1421
01:07:52,170 --> 01:07:54,909
- It was a great performance. - Thank you.

1422
01:07:56,510 --> 01:07:58,050
I thought we made it.

1423
01:07:58,210 --> 01:07:59,909
I thought, "We could make it to the First Tier Zone."

1424
01:08:00,150 --> 01:08:02,050
"We'll make it to the First Tier Zone."

1425
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:05,550
PROJECT 7's Title Song Evaluation.

1426
01:08:05,949 --> 01:08:09,859
We'll announce the final ranking.

1427
01:08:09,860 --> 01:08:12,059
(Announcing the final tiers of the title song performance)

1428
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:16,460
Oh, dear.

1429
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:20,068
The team with the highest score...

1430
01:08:20,069 --> 01:08:23,238
combined with the video evaluation and the team evaluation...

1431
01:08:23,239 --> 01:08:25,869
will take the First Tier Zone.

1432
01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:30,680
(Another benefit for the team in the 1st Tier Zone)

1433
01:08:32,079 --> 01:08:36,380
(A chance to create a performance video)

1434
01:08:38,649 --> 01:08:42,589
For the team evaluation, each director could give 100 points.

1435
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:45,489
So if you won the perfect score, that'd be 500 points.

1436
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:49,300
Which team will make it to the First Tier Zone?

1437
01:08:50,029 --> 01:08:53,229
We'll announce fourth place.

1438
01:08:53,770 --> 01:08:55,738
- Please... - They'll announce the fourth first?

1439
01:08:55,739 --> 01:08:56,739
(P3 was in 5th place for video evaluation.)

1440
01:08:58,640 --> 01:08:59,769
P3.

1441
01:08:59,770 --> 01:09:03,538
(P3 is in the 4th Tier Zone.)

1442
01:09:03,539 --> 01:09:05,310
Hey, we're no longer in the Shadow Zone!

1443
01:09:05,449 --> 01:09:06,680
Great job, guys.

1444
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:07,819
Then that means...

1445
01:09:08,449 --> 01:09:11,419
Does that mean we'll be in the Shadow Zone?

1446
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:12,550
Are we in the Shadow Zone?

1447
01:09:12,619 --> 01:09:16,788
P3 will be in the 4th Tier Zone for earning 610 points in total.

1448
01:09:16,789 --> 01:09:17,828
(P3 will be in the 4th Tier Zone with a total score of 610.)

1449
01:09:17,829 --> 01:09:19,560
- What? - I can't believe it.

1450
01:09:20,859 --> 01:09:24,869
I was relieved that we could at least be on the platform.

1451
01:09:25,329 --> 01:09:27,539
It may be just fourth place,

1452
01:09:27,739 --> 01:09:29,640
but to us, it means that we proved that we could improve.

1453
01:09:29,770 --> 01:09:31,439
That was the most thrilling moment.

1454
01:09:32,609 --> 01:09:36,640
Next, we'll announce third place.

1455
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:40,309
I thought we'd make third place no matter what.

1456
01:09:40,310 --> 01:09:42,350
"Will we be in 3rd place? I guess we're in 3rd place."

1457
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:44,618
It's P5.

1458
01:09:44,619 --> 01:09:45,619
(P5 will be in the 3rd Tier Zone.)

1459
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:47,020
(Exclaiming)

1460
01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:51,029
(Their ranking goes down from 2nd Tier to 3rd Tier.)

1461
01:09:51,289 --> 01:09:54,359
I did my best as if my life depended on it.

1462
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:56,158
I was quite disappointed.

1463
01:09:56,159 --> 01:09:57,199
(It's a disappointing result.)

1464
01:09:57,399 --> 01:09:58,469
It's P5.

1465
01:09:58,470 --> 01:10:00,939
(Anxious)

1466
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,270
The team that will be in the Shadow Zone...

1467
01:10:03,739 --> 01:10:05,169
is P2.

1468
01:10:05,170 --> 01:10:09,680
(P2 will be in the Shadow Zone.)

1469
01:10:13,609 --> 01:10:16,920
We placed last. We were in fifth place.

1470
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:20,850
We can't say that we're in any Tier Zone...

1471
01:10:21,090 --> 01:10:22,319
since it's the Shadow Zone.

1472
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:27,260
(Only 1st and 2nd Tiers remain to be announced.)

1473
01:10:27,329 --> 01:10:29,800
We'll announce first place.

1474
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:31,169
The winner of the title song.

1475
01:10:31,170 --> 01:10:32,868
The team that will take the First Tier Zone...

1476
01:10:32,869 --> 01:10:33,999
(Which team will take the 1st Tier Zone?)

1477
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,640
I was desperately hoping that it'd be us and waited.

1478
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:39,640
The winner of the title song.

1479
01:10:39,641 --> 01:10:41,179
The team that will take the First Tier Zone...

1480
01:10:41,180 --> 01:10:42,339
(Which team will take the 1st Tier Zone?)

1481
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:46,050
I was desperately hoping that it'd be us and waited.

1482
01:10:47,149 --> 01:10:48,180
It's...

1483
01:10:48,850 --> 01:10:49,850
P4!

1484
01:10:49,851 --> 01:10:56,159
(P4 will take the 1st Tier Zone.)

1485
01:11:02,029 --> 01:11:04,699
(P1 will take the 2nd Tier Zone.)

1486
01:11:04,770 --> 01:11:05,869
Good job.

1487
01:11:06,069 --> 01:11:07,769
- Great job. - Great job.

1488
01:11:07,770 --> 01:11:10,198
P4 earned 230 points for their video evaluation...

1489
01:11:10,199 --> 01:11:12,339
and 482 points for their team evaluation.

1490
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:16,578
With a total score of 712, they took the 1st Tier Zone.

1491
01:11:16,579 --> 01:11:18,049
- Congratulations! - Thank you.

1492
01:11:18,050 --> 01:11:19,278
- Thank you! - Oh, gosh.

1493
01:11:19,279 --> 01:11:21,819
(They took the 1st Tier Zone with an unrivalled score.)

1494
01:11:22,779 --> 01:11:26,919
As you all know, only the First Tier Zone trainees...

1495
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:29,460
will be given a chance to become the center members.

1496
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:32,188
The trainees' votes...

1497
01:11:32,189 --> 01:11:34,358
and the directors' votes will be added.

1498
01:11:34,359 --> 01:11:37,398
The trainee who wins the most votes...

1499
01:11:37,399 --> 01:11:38,770
will become the center member.

1500
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:40,970
Who will represent the 100 trainees...

1501
01:11:41,970 --> 01:11:45,170
and become the center member for "RUN?"

1502
01:11:46,770 --> 01:11:47,909
Congratulations.

1503
01:11:48,409 --> 01:11:50,538
It's SAKURADA KENSHIN!

1504
01:11:50,539 --> 01:11:56,350
(SAKURADA KENSHIN of P4)

1505
01:11:57,689 --> 01:11:58,989
Congratulations.

1506
01:11:59,189 --> 01:12:01,359
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

1507
01:12:01,489 --> 01:12:04,429
Don't cry.

1508
01:12:04,430 --> 01:12:07,129
I thought KENSHIN was the one...

1509
01:12:07,130 --> 01:12:09,599
who could best express...

1510
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:10,999
the feel of the song, "RUN."

1511
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,269
I voted for KENSHIN.

1512
01:12:13,270 --> 01:12:16,239
His eyes when he smiles are beautiful.

1513
01:12:16,470 --> 01:12:19,269
It's the face that everyone would like.

1514
01:12:19,270 --> 01:12:21,938
Seeing how he performed so well,

1515
01:12:21,939 --> 01:12:24,809
I realized that he had the charm...

1516
01:12:24,810 --> 01:12:26,409
to win the hearts of people.

1517
01:12:27,250 --> 01:12:29,019
Since I was chosen as the center member,

1518
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:32,889
I'll show my charming smile...

1519
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:35,659
and make the fans happy.

1520
01:12:35,819 --> 01:12:37,828
I'll do my best!

1521
01:12:37,829 --> 01:12:39,229
(World Assemblers, I'll do my best!)

1522
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:42,130
- Congratulations. - Gosh.

1523
01:12:43,659 --> 01:12:47,228
All right. The 2nd project of PROJECT 7.

1524
01:12:47,229 --> 01:12:50,399
The tiers of all trainees have been decided for the title song.

1525
01:12:50,899 --> 01:12:53,038
- Thank you! - Thank you.

1526
01:12:53,039 --> 01:12:56,010
(Applauding each other for working hard)

1527
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:06,989
Great job, really.

1528
01:13:12,159 --> 01:13:13,489
You did really well.

1529
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:19,328
I don't think there was anyone...

1530
01:13:19,329 --> 01:13:20,869
who wasn't worried about our team.

1531
01:13:20,970 --> 01:13:24,299
Everyone was thinking, "What will happen to our team?"

1532
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:26,909
We all thought of that.

1533
01:13:27,170 --> 01:13:29,679
But we all became so different...

1534
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:31,680
from the first time we saw each other.

1535
01:13:32,649 --> 01:13:36,579
Now, everyone dances and sings so well.

1536
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:39,619
I knew we did well.

1537
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:43,890
So many people worked really hard,

1538
01:13:45,329 --> 01:13:48,460
so I want to tell them they did well and that I'm grateful.

1539
01:13:52,729 --> 01:13:54,539
(The day of the title song shoot)

1540
01:13:55,039 --> 01:13:57,269
- It's huge. - What is this?

1541
01:13:57,270 --> 01:13:58,309
(Amazed)

1542
01:13:58,310 --> 01:13:59,368
It's huge.

1543
01:13:59,369 --> 01:14:01,908
- The scale is huge. - It's really big.

1544
01:14:01,909 --> 01:14:03,439
(The trainees were surprised by the title song stage.)

1545
01:14:03,909 --> 01:14:05,680
Look how big of a scale this is.

1546
01:14:06,279 --> 01:14:10,919
You're amazing!

1547
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:13,420
(Director Bada and Director RyuD came to help.)

1548
01:14:13,550 --> 01:14:14,960
- Hello! - Hello!

1549
01:14:16,220 --> 01:14:17,419
Did you practice a lot?

1550
01:14:17,420 --> 01:14:19,090
- Yes! - Yes, we did!

1551
01:14:19,229 --> 01:14:20,429
How do you feel?

1552
01:14:20,430 --> 01:14:22,028
- Great! - Great!

1553
01:14:22,029 --> 01:14:23,198
- You're in your best condition? - Yes.

1554
01:14:23,199 --> 01:14:24,728
Let's work hard from the start to the end...

1555
01:14:24,729 --> 01:14:27,028
without getting injured. All right?

1556
01:14:27,029 --> 01:14:28,300
- Yes! - Yes!

1557
01:14:28,770 --> 01:14:30,038
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1558
01:14:30,039 --> 01:14:31,710
First Tier Zone, please go up.

1559
01:14:32,310 --> 01:14:33,310
(The 1st Tier Zone trainees move up to the stage first.)

1560
01:14:33,311 --> 01:14:34,579
That's so cool. I'm envious.

1561
01:14:34,779 --> 01:14:36,009
(Exclaiming)

1562
01:14:36,010 --> 01:14:37,239
It's quite wide.

1563
01:14:38,180 --> 01:14:39,579
It's a lot wider than I thought.

1564
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:44,119
I felt a little envious.

1565
01:14:44,819 --> 01:14:46,520
I was really envious.

1566
01:14:47,890 --> 01:14:49,819
(The lift goes up.)

1567
01:14:50,260 --> 01:14:54,430
(The 1st Tier Zone takes the highest spot.)

1568
01:14:55,130 --> 01:14:56,800
Gosh, what's with the center member?

1569
01:14:57,130 --> 01:14:59,130
(This is the class of the center member.)

1570
01:14:59,229 --> 01:15:00,600
I can't believe it!

1571
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,368
- Second Tier Zone, please go up. - Yes.

1572
01:15:03,369 --> 01:15:04,769
(P1 moves to the 2nd Tier Zone.)

1573
01:15:04,770 --> 01:15:05,909
Let's go.

1574
01:15:06,609 --> 01:15:08,340
(2nd Tier Zone's place)

1575
01:15:08,539 --> 01:15:11,139
- Third Tier Zone, please go up. - Okay.

1576
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:12,309
Fourth Tier Zone, let's go up.

1577
01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:13,778
- Okay. - Okay.

1578
01:15:13,779 --> 01:15:15,448
(The stage is full now.)

1579
01:15:15,449 --> 01:15:16,449
(P2 hasn't gone up the stage yet.)

1580
01:15:16,450 --> 01:15:17,549
- It feels bitter. - It hurts.

1581
01:15:17,550 --> 01:15:19,550
It really is dark where we'll stand.

1582
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:21,489
I feel bitter.

1583
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,559
The last team, please go up.

1584
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:24,629
Let's go.

1585
01:15:24,630 --> 01:15:26,159
Being on the floor is great. It's great for dancing.

1586
01:15:26,390 --> 01:15:28,600
- Let's go, Shadow Zone! - Let's go.

1587
01:15:29,630 --> 01:15:33,569
(They begin the rehearsal in earnest.)

1588
01:15:33,899 --> 01:15:36,539
You're too slow in the beginning and at the end.

1589
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:39,438
You keep making mistakes with the latter part of the lyrics.

1590
01:15:39,439 --> 01:15:40,840
You need to sing them correctly.

1591
01:15:41,069 --> 01:15:43,608
Be cool when you pose. Your gaze too.

1592
01:15:43,609 --> 01:15:44,609
More.

1593
01:15:45,409 --> 01:15:46,448
That's it.

1594
01:15:46,449 --> 01:15:47,948
(He even fixes their poses in detail.)

1595
01:15:47,949 --> 01:15:50,380
(Their performance is getting close to being perfect.)

1596
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:52,319
(Satisfied)

1597
01:15:53,949 --> 01:15:56,119
(The rehearsal ends.)

1598
01:15:56,489 --> 01:15:57,520
(I did well, right?)

1599
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:03,560
(They dress up for the title song performance.)

1600
01:16:05,930 --> 01:16:08,198
(How many seconds before they "RUN" to you?)

1601
01:16:08,199 --> 01:16:09,839
Three, two, one!

1602
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:11,839
(The best performance...)

1603
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:13,840
(created by the trainees)

1604
01:16:13,939 --> 01:16:17,278
I joined the show to show myself growing.

1605
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:18,908
Please look kindly upon me.

1606
01:16:18,909 --> 01:16:22,279
I'd be grateful if you included me in the final seven.

1607
01:16:22,649 --> 01:16:25,390
I'll do my best and show you an amazing performance.

1608
01:16:26,050 --> 01:16:29,589
Since I got picked as the center member,

1609
01:16:29,590 --> 01:16:32,489
I'll do my best with the thought of debuting.

1610
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:38,229
(The Title Song Project ends.)

1611
01:16:40,369 --> 01:16:42,369
What will happen today?

1612
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:43,698
What's that?

1613
01:16:43,699 --> 01:16:45,569
- What's that? - It's where everything began.

1614
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:48,239
My heart flutters the moment I see the blue background.

1615
01:16:48,939 --> 01:16:50,009
What could this be?

1616
01:16:50,010 --> 01:16:51,408
I feel so nervous.

1617
01:16:51,409 --> 01:16:52,680
I'm scared.

1618
01:16:52,779 --> 01:16:54,679
What if we're given the choice of what we do?

1619
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:55,919
Hi, SIU.

1620
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:57,449
You're shining as usual today.

1621
01:16:57,850 --> 01:16:59,590
Nice to meet you.

1622
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:02,960
Good.

1623
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:03,960
(Good. Thank you.)

1624
01:17:04,319 --> 01:17:07,029
What could it be?

1625
01:17:07,859 --> 01:17:10,260
(All the trainees are here.)

1626
01:17:10,930 --> 01:17:11,930
Wow.

1627
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:14,470
I feel anxious here.

1628
01:17:14,970 --> 01:17:16,140
- I'm scared. - Yes, a bit.

1629
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:19,069
(They suddenly begin to feel anxious.)

1630
01:17:19,539 --> 01:17:20,869
- I wonder what we're going to do. - Me, too.

1631
01:17:21,710 --> 01:17:24,750
(While everyone is scared,)

1632
01:17:31,890 --> 01:17:33,689
(a familiar silhouette appears.)

1633
01:17:34,689 --> 01:17:36,559
(Director Lee Hae In)

1634
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:37,720
Hello.

1635
01:17:38,789 --> 01:17:39,988
Wow.

1636
01:17:39,989 --> 01:17:42,429
It's been so long. Is everyone doing all right?

1637
01:17:42,430 --> 01:17:43,459
- Yes. - Yes.

1638
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:45,198
Your performance of "RUN" was amazing.

1639
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:47,369
(Proud)

1640
01:17:47,729 --> 01:17:49,269
We'll begin the third project...

1641
01:17:49,270 --> 01:17:52,069
which will significantly affect the global vote...

1642
01:17:52,210 --> 01:17:54,880
of PROJECT 7.

1643
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:57,710
My dopamine level is increasing.

1644
01:17:58,850 --> 01:18:00,648
The time has come.

1645
01:18:00,649 --> 01:18:02,079
I'm scared.

1646
01:18:02,649 --> 01:18:05,549
Soon, the first pass-fail decision will be made...

1647
01:18:05,550 --> 01:18:08,489
on which your survival depends.

1648
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:10,890
Oh, my goodness.

1649
01:18:11,359 --> 01:18:15,028
The trainees who can survive this round...

1650
01:18:15,029 --> 01:18:16,100
(How many are the first survivors?)

1651
01:18:17,430 --> 01:18:18,869
are trainees ranked first...

1652
01:18:19,970 --> 01:18:22,039
to 70th.

1653
01:18:22,569 --> 01:18:24,238
- They're eliminating 30 people. - Oh, my.

1654
01:18:24,239 --> 01:18:25,310
I got goosebumps.

1655
01:18:26,109 --> 01:18:28,078
The real survival begins now.

1656
01:18:28,079 --> 01:18:30,078
The decision had to be made sooner...

1657
01:18:30,079 --> 01:18:31,750
to reduce the number of trainees.

1658
01:18:32,579 --> 01:18:34,778
I realized...

1659
01:18:34,779 --> 01:18:36,879
that survival had just begun,

1660
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:38,988
and it made me feel excited.

1661
01:18:38,989 --> 01:18:42,519
Your third project...

1662
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:45,460
(What's the project on which their survival depends?)

1663
01:18:46,359 --> 01:18:47,828
is Position Matching.

1664
01:18:47,829 --> 01:18:49,300
(Position Matching)

1665
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:52,728
That surprised me.

1666
01:18:52,729 --> 01:18:54,569
(Position Matching)

1667
01:18:54,670 --> 01:18:56,068
In Position Matching,

1668
01:18:56,069 --> 01:18:58,770
you'll be evaluated on three positions in total.

1669
01:18:58,970 --> 01:19:02,680
They're vocal, dance, and rap.

1670
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:06,349
Since it's an evaluation of your performance in a position,

1671
01:19:06,350 --> 01:19:09,148
you must be good at singing, dancing, and rapping.

1672
01:19:09,149 --> 01:19:12,148
And there are other essential elements you need to accomplish.

1673
01:19:12,149 --> 01:19:13,919
(Essential elements?)

1674
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:15,060
First,

1675
01:19:15,260 --> 01:19:18,019
the vocal positions participate in the song arrangement.

1676
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:20,560
(Vocal positions will be in charge of arrangement.)

1677
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:22,459
- I'll apply for that position. - For the rap position,

1678
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:25,399
you need to make the rap on your own.

1679
01:19:26,029 --> 01:19:27,500
Rap-making is nothing.

1680
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:28,999
For the dance position,

1681
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,238
you need to create the empty sections...

1682
01:19:31,239 --> 01:19:33,539
in the choreography to complete it.

1683
01:19:34,310 --> 01:19:35,380
Really?

1684
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:41,049
To be honest, I'm capable of vocal, dance, and rap.

1685
01:19:41,050 --> 01:19:43,619
This time, I thought hard...

1686
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:45,188
about which of them I need to show.

1687
01:19:45,189 --> 01:19:48,158
The mission songs you will be performing...

1688
01:19:48,159 --> 01:19:49,489
will be revealed.

1689
01:19:51,789 --> 01:19:54,188
- I'm happy and scared. - Please.

1690
01:19:54,189 --> 01:19:57,528
- I hope they're songs I know. - In 1, 2, 3!

1691
01:19:57,529 --> 01:19:58,699
(Mission songs for the vocal position)

1692
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,029
There's a song I know.

1693
01:20:02,399 --> 01:20:03,739
- Wow. - Wow.

1694
01:20:04,739 --> 01:20:05,839
I know that song.

1695
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:08,408
- "Love wins all." - That song's very hard to sing.

1696
01:20:08,409 --> 01:20:10,478
("Love wins all" by IU is a ballad song with a clear structure...)

1697
01:20:10,479 --> 01:20:12,250
(which delivers a message that love can win everything.)

1698
01:20:12,350 --> 01:20:14,648
("Don't Go" by EXO is a song that expresses anticipation for love...)

1699
01:20:14,649 --> 01:20:15,979
(with dreamy sentimental piano melodies.)

1700
01:20:16,119 --> 01:20:18,389
("We Must Love" by ONF is known as a hidden great K-pop song...)

1701
01:20:18,390 --> 01:20:19,989
(with rock elements on a future bass track.)

1702
01:20:20,189 --> 01:20:22,219
("Love me or Leave me" by DAY6 recently gained popularity...)

1703
01:20:22,220 --> 01:20:23,859
(and interprets various genres with rock sounds.)

1704
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:27,029
I definitely want to do "Love me or Leave me."

1705
01:20:27,529 --> 01:20:29,029
That song caught my eye.

1706
01:20:29,130 --> 01:20:30,328
For the vocal position,

1707
01:20:30,329 --> 01:20:32,198
- they selected great songs. - All right. Next,

1708
01:20:32,199 --> 01:20:34,269
the songs for the dance position will be revealed.

1709
01:20:34,270 --> 01:20:35,398
Yes, dance!

1710
01:20:35,399 --> 01:20:37,670
I can see that many people want the dance position.

1711
01:20:38,310 --> 01:20:39,539
Here we go.

1712
01:20:47,909 --> 01:20:50,520
"3D"?

1713
01:20:50,779 --> 01:20:52,520
Fifteen people are allowed for each song.

1714
01:20:53,989 --> 01:20:55,289
Wow.

1715
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:57,759
("Kiwi" by Harry Styles is a rock and hip-hop song...)

1716
01:20:57,760 --> 01:20:59,429
(which is the most trendy genre in 2024.)

1717
01:20:59,430 --> 01:21:02,100
(It expresses a strong vocal and energetic rhythms.)

1718
01:21:02,199 --> 01:21:03,999
("Closer" by The Chainsmokers is a song in the future bass genre.)

1719
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,429
(The song ranked first for 12 weeks on Billboard Hot 100 Singles Chart.)

1720
01:21:06,430 --> 01:21:07,670
(The song appeals to your emotions.)

1721
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:09,898
("Pop" by N Sync is an all-time legendary song...)

1722
01:21:09,899 --> 01:21:13,640
(in which pop and hip-hop elements are mixed in a trendy manner.)

1723
01:21:13,710 --> 01:21:17,108
("3D" by Jung Kook is a song that reinterprets the two-step genre...)

1724
01:21:17,109 --> 01:21:19,550
(with a striking rhythm and an old-school sound.)

1725
01:21:19,909 --> 01:21:21,749
Next, the rap position.

1726
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:24,079
- The songs are important for rap. - Yes, let's go!

1727
01:21:24,279 --> 01:21:25,819
How many songs with an ultimate beat would be there?

1728
01:21:26,250 --> 01:21:27,289
(Showing only a bit)

1729
01:21:32,159 --> 01:21:33,430
What are the songs?

1730
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:35,329
Come on.

1731
01:21:36,359 --> 01:21:37,659
"SHALALA?"

1732
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:39,430
Wait, there's "Crayon."

1733
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:42,868
(Buzzing)

1734
01:21:42,869 --> 01:21:44,369
- "MOMMAE." - "Crayon?"

1735
01:21:44,539 --> 01:21:45,608
"MOMMAE."

1736
01:21:45,609 --> 01:21:47,439
Is that "MOMMAE" we know?

1737
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:50,238
"MOMMAE"? I love that song.

1738
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:52,148
("SHALALA" by TAEYONG delivers a confident message...)

1739
01:21:52,149 --> 01:21:53,448
(that everyone can shine everywhere.)

1740
01:21:53,449 --> 01:21:54,779
(It's memorable for its witty rap flow and addictive chorus.)

1741
01:21:54,909 --> 01:21:57,719
("Crayon" by G-DRAGON shows G-DRAGON's experimental spirit.)

1742
01:21:57,720 --> 01:22:00,649
(You can enjoy both hip-hop and electronic genres in this song.)

1743
01:22:00,850 --> 01:22:02,559
("WORK" by ATEEZ delivers a message...)

1744
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:04,318
(of the direction and growth of the youth.)

1745
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:06,159
(It has a groovy sound and an addictive beat.)

1746
01:22:06,260 --> 01:22:08,328
("MOMMAE" by Jay Park captures his sexy vibes...)

1747
01:22:08,329 --> 01:22:11,060
(with his signature directness and unique ways with his words.)

1748
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:12,970
Starting from this project,

1749
01:22:13,270 --> 01:22:15,269
you'll have an audience.

1750
01:22:15,270 --> 01:22:17,698
(World Assemblers will watch their performances.)

1751
01:22:17,699 --> 01:22:19,869
You need to perform in front of an audience.

1752
01:22:23,710 --> 01:22:27,210
World Assemblers who come to the site...

1753
01:22:27,350 --> 01:22:30,520
will cast votes after watching your performances.

1754
01:22:31,479 --> 01:22:35,020
The audience can vote twice in total.

1755
01:22:35,119 --> 01:22:38,858
The first vote will decide...

1756
01:22:38,859 --> 01:22:40,028
the best team in each position.

1757
01:22:40,029 --> 01:22:43,728
The next vote will decide the MVP.

1758
01:22:43,729 --> 01:22:46,499
The audience will vote for one trainee...

1759
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:48,569
they think performed the best in each position.

1760
01:22:51,140 --> 01:22:53,239
And I heard that these votes...

1761
01:22:53,310 --> 01:22:56,779
- include an amazing benefit. - Okay.

1762
01:22:57,680 --> 01:23:00,249
Right. This is survival.

1763
01:23:00,250 --> 01:23:01,510
The benefit...

1764
01:23:04,850 --> 01:23:07,420
will be revealed on the day of your performances.

1765
01:23:11,359 --> 01:23:15,398
Let's decide on the songs for the first position.

1766
01:23:15,399 --> 01:23:16,500
(The first position song selection)

1767
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:19,929
I'm so nervous.

1768
01:23:19,930 --> 01:23:22,839
(Trainees stand in front of the song in the position they want.)

1769
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:24,769
(When the number of trainees exceeds the limit,)

1770
01:23:24,770 --> 01:23:26,770
(the trainees can decide who gets to stay using any method.)

1771
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:30,609
Trainees applying for the vocal position,

1772
01:23:30,739 --> 01:23:33,449
please stand in front of the sign for the song you want.

1773
01:23:35,149 --> 01:23:36,249
(Many people moving)

1774
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:37,719
A lot of people are moving.

1775
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:38,720
What's going on?

1776
01:23:39,689 --> 01:23:40,719
Wow.

1777
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:43,720
I know that many of you are good vocalists,

1778
01:23:44,090 --> 01:23:46,188
but fewer people are moving than I thought.

1779
01:23:46,189 --> 01:23:47,259
Why are so many people here?

1780
01:23:47,260 --> 01:23:48,359
So many people.

1781
01:23:48,529 --> 01:23:50,659
Count how many people are there for each song.

1782
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:53,828
(Many are flocking to "Don't Go.")

1783
01:23:53,829 --> 01:23:55,099
Do we need to let people out?

1784
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:56,439
Ten of us will be out.

1785
01:23:59,210 --> 01:24:00,210
To be honest,

1786
01:24:00,211 --> 01:24:03,309
I wanted to apply for the dance position.

1787
01:24:03,310 --> 01:24:05,778
But the number of people in each team was high...

1788
01:24:05,779 --> 01:24:08,549
that I thought it wouldn't show my presence.

1789
01:24:08,550 --> 01:24:10,520
That's why I applied for the vocal position.

1790
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:13,689
(Next, applicants for the dance position)

1791
01:24:15,659 --> 01:24:17,559
(The dance teams are being formed.)

1792
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:19,689
I'll stand here first. I'll try what I'm good at.

1793
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:21,659
But I know a lot of them here.

1794
01:24:21,899 --> 01:24:23,430
What's the use of knowing a lot of them?

1795
01:24:23,729 --> 01:24:25,228
See, we need to get votes...

1796
01:24:25,229 --> 01:24:27,328
when the audience doesn't know who we are.

1797
01:24:27,329 --> 01:24:28,438
Then it's hard to earn a lot of votes.

1798
01:24:28,439 --> 01:24:29,599
The benefit matters.

1799
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:31,840
You don't have much time left. Let's close now.

1800
01:24:31,939 --> 01:24:34,269
Trainees in "Pop," raise your hand if you know the song.

1801
01:24:34,270 --> 01:24:35,438
(This?)

1802
01:24:35,439 --> 01:24:36,779
Then I would...

1803
01:24:36,810 --> 01:24:38,879
That's "POP!" by Nayeon.

1804
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:40,909
(Embarrassed)

1805
01:24:41,079 --> 01:24:42,618
Please stand in front of the signs.

1806
01:24:42,619 --> 01:24:44,479
- I don't know. - Please.

1807
01:24:45,489 --> 01:24:46,549
Let's try.

1808
01:24:46,550 --> 01:24:47,550
Hello.

1809
01:24:48,119 --> 01:24:49,289
Nice.

1810
01:24:49,489 --> 01:24:51,319
This is a trendy song.

1811
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:52,729
It's totally Gen Z.

1812
01:24:53,090 --> 01:24:55,560
(JEON MINWOOK is thinking hard.)

1813
01:24:55,729 --> 01:24:58,629
The team I wanted to join was already full.

1814
01:24:58,630 --> 01:25:00,868
I had to push out other trainees...

1815
01:25:00,869 --> 01:25:03,000
if I went to that team.

1816
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:04,539
So I thought hard.

1817
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:07,739
- I'll close it now. - I don't know.

1818
01:25:07,939 --> 01:25:10,009
- We have strong players here. - You can't move now.

1819
01:25:10,010 --> 01:25:12,310
(JEON MINWOOK picks "WORK.")

1820
01:25:13,210 --> 01:25:14,509
- Goodness. - I'm in big trouble.

1821
01:25:14,510 --> 01:25:15,519
(Every trainee made a decision.)

1822
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:17,520
I see songs that exceed the number of people...

1823
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:19,488
and ones that need more people.

1824
01:25:19,489 --> 01:25:21,118
(Extra 1, 9, 2, and 7 people in each team)

1825
01:25:21,119 --> 01:25:22,319
(All the vocal teams need to remove some of the applicants.)

1826
01:25:22,359 --> 01:25:23,858
(9, 5, 4 people needed and 2 extra applicants)

1827
01:25:23,859 --> 01:25:25,329
("3D" team in the rap position needs to remove 2 applicants.)

1828
01:25:25,390 --> 01:25:27,059
(2, 1, 1, people needed and 2 extra applicants)

1829
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:28,630
("WORK" team in the rap position needs to remove 2 applicants.)

1830
01:25:28,859 --> 01:25:32,599
Now, we'll readjust the number of people.

1831
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:34,669
No. Come on.

1832
01:25:34,670 --> 01:25:35,670
(This can't be happening.)

1833
01:25:35,671 --> 01:25:36,970
Please help me.

1834
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:40,210
We have two more people now.

1835
01:25:40,340 --> 01:25:42,079
I will leave this team.

1836
01:25:42,180 --> 01:25:44,478
It felt that many people in this team...

1837
01:25:44,479 --> 01:25:46,108
were very competent.

1838
01:25:46,109 --> 01:25:48,379
(YOON JUHAN and LIM HYUNWOO decide to leave the "3D" team.)

1839
01:25:48,380 --> 01:25:51,319
Then we made a peaceful settlement.

1840
01:25:51,550 --> 01:25:55,519
(Meanwhile, other team are having fierce competitions.)

1841
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:56,859
The world gave in to my love for you

1842
01:25:56,890 --> 01:26:00,390
(Showing his singing ability)

1843
01:26:01,659 --> 01:26:04,529
(Singing passionately)

1844
01:26:07,270 --> 01:26:11,000
(It's also essential to show their charms.)

1845
01:26:11,739 --> 01:26:14,869
(They need to check the rapping ability too.)

1846
01:26:16,239 --> 01:26:17,908
You're not removed because you're bad.

1847
01:26:17,909 --> 01:26:19,778
It's only a thin difference.

1848
01:26:19,779 --> 01:26:21,579
- Right. - It's only that different.

1849
01:26:21,609 --> 01:26:23,420
Team "WORK" by ATEEZ.

1850
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:25,949
Those who are removed, please come out.

1851
01:26:26,119 --> 01:26:27,189
What?

1852
01:26:27,689 --> 01:26:28,689
What?

1853
01:26:29,159 --> 01:26:31,489
He's a strong one.

1854
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:32,829
Really?

1855
01:26:32,890 --> 01:26:34,658
(YOO HEEDO...)

1856
01:26:34,659 --> 01:26:36,329
(and KIM HYUNJAE are removed.)

1857
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:38,898
Since they're older than us,

1858
01:26:38,899 --> 01:26:42,500
I thought they wouldn't suit this latest song.

1859
01:26:42,670 --> 01:26:44,000
In the dance position,

1860
01:26:44,539 --> 01:26:45,739
Team "3D."

1861
01:26:46,239 --> 01:26:48,810
Trainees who were removed from the team, please come out.

1862
01:26:49,180 --> 01:26:50,680
- Oh, gosh. - They're young ones.

1863
01:26:52,750 --> 01:26:54,180
The trainees removed from vocal position teams.

1864
01:26:55,180 --> 01:26:58,349
Trainees who were removed, please come out.

1865
01:26:58,350 --> 01:26:59,818
(In Team "Love wins all", SHIN JAEWON, KIM DOHUN, KIM JOONWOO,)

1866
01:26:59,819 --> 01:27:01,148
(LEE JIHOON, FONG ATILLA, FUKUYAMA SOTA, and ASAKA KOTARO are removed.)

1867
01:27:01,149 --> 01:27:02,919
Why are they leaving the team?

1868
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:04,289
Wait. Which ones remain in the team then?

1869
01:27:05,119 --> 01:27:06,689
YOUNGSEO, SEOKHEE, and...

1870
01:27:07,489 --> 01:27:09,059
Team "We Must Love."

1871
01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:10,099
(LEE YUJUN and AYALON ADAM are removed.)

1872
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:13,430
Trainees removed from Team "Don't Go,"

1873
01:27:13,529 --> 01:27:15,100
please move here.

1874
01:27:16,970 --> 01:27:18,810
Trainees removed from Team "Love me or Leave me,"

1875
01:27:19,109 --> 01:27:22,039
please move here.

1876
01:27:22,310 --> 01:27:25,510
Here are the trainees who failed in the first song selection.

1877
01:27:25,909 --> 01:27:29,550
You'll have the chance to recruit them...

1878
01:27:29,579 --> 01:27:31,478
to your team first if it's not full.

1879
01:27:31,479 --> 01:27:32,549
I guessed it right.

1880
01:27:32,550 --> 01:27:33,849
Let's bring the one who shows good tumbling.

1881
01:27:33,850 --> 01:27:35,389
Gather here, right now.

1882
01:27:35,390 --> 01:27:37,020
(Raising hands)

1883
01:27:37,220 --> 01:27:39,228
- Trainee KIM TAEYU, - Yes.

1884
01:27:39,229 --> 01:27:41,089
whom do you want to recruit?

1885
01:27:41,090 --> 01:27:42,698
I want to recruit HEEDO.

1886
01:27:42,699 --> 01:27:43,760
I love you!

1887
01:27:45,229 --> 01:27:46,299
(Welcome.)

1888
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:48,469
- Nice! - This is it.

1889
01:27:48,470 --> 01:27:49,939
(Team "Crayon" is assembled.)

1890
01:27:50,069 --> 01:27:52,739
- Team "Kiwi." - We want Trainee KIM JOONWOO.

1891
01:27:52,810 --> 01:27:54,810
I want to know why.

1892
01:27:54,909 --> 01:27:56,609
You need to provide your reason.

1893
01:27:57,140 --> 01:27:59,109
We want you, JUNWOO, with single-hearted devotion.

1894
01:27:59,250 --> 01:28:00,349
Come here!

1895
01:28:00,350 --> 01:28:01,880
This is a competition too.

1896
01:28:01,949 --> 01:28:04,319
I'm going to join you since you're ready to have me.

1897
01:28:06,750 --> 01:28:07,750
(KIM JOONWOO joins Team "Kiwi.")

1898
01:28:07,751 --> 01:28:08,858
This is nice.

1899
01:28:08,859 --> 01:28:10,158
I came right away. Thank you.

1900
01:28:10,159 --> 01:28:11,188
We want KOTARO.

1901
01:28:11,189 --> 01:28:12,429
I love you!

1902
01:28:12,430 --> 01:28:14,390
(Trainee KOTARO joins Team "Closer.")

1903
01:28:14,689 --> 01:28:16,158
We want FONG ATILLA.

1904
01:28:16,159 --> 01:28:18,000
- We want ATILLA. - Here.

1905
01:28:19,699 --> 01:28:20,829
Where are you going?

1906
01:28:21,399 --> 01:28:23,999
ATILLA chose Team "Pop."

1907
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,368
You can go to the song you want.

1908
01:28:26,369 --> 01:28:27,769
In 2, 1, go!

1909
01:28:27,770 --> 01:28:29,009
(Other trainees removed join the teams they want.)

1910
01:28:29,010 --> 01:28:30,408
- Okay. - Be careful.

1911
01:28:30,409 --> 01:28:34,550
Now, the song selection for Position Matching is over.

1912
01:28:38,989 --> 01:28:41,249

(KIM SUNGJUN, KIM SIYUL, KIM JIHWAN, MANABE JIN,)

1930
01:29:09,751 --> 01:29:10,948
(MAJINGXIANG, SEO JINWON, ABE YURA, ANDY, OK CHANGHYEON,)

1931
01:29:10,949 --> 01:29:11,949
(YOO HYEONSEUNG, FONG ATILLA, and FUKUYAMA SOTA.)

1932
01:29:11,950 --> 01:29:13,288
(Team "3D" has KIM DANU, LYNNLYNN, LIN WEI CHEN, PARK JUNSEO,)

1933
01:29:13,289 --> 01:29:14,448
(PARK JUNWOO, PARK CHANYONG, SAKURADA KENSHIN, SANTA,)

1934
01:29:14,449 --> 01:29:15,559
(YU JIAHN, LEE JUNSEON, ZHANG JINGLONG, JANG YEOJUN,)

1935
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:16,560
(JEONG DEUNHAESOL, CHAE HEEJU, and PETCH.)

1936
01:29:16,619 --> 01:29:18,688
(Team "SHALALA" has SONG SEUNGHO, SHIN JAEWON,)

1937
01:29:18,689 --> 01:29:21,189
(LEE JIHOON, and TSUJII RYOMA.)

1938
01:29:21,289 --> 01:29:23,728
(Team "Crayon" has KWON YEUNG, KIM TAEYU, OBAYASHI YUSEI,)

1939
01:29:23,729 --> 01:29:24,930
(YOO HEEDO, and LEE GUNWOO.)

1940
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:27,398
(Team "WORK" has KIM JEONGMIN, KIM TAESUNG,)

1941
01:29:27,399 --> 01:29:29,939
(YEOM YECHAN, JEON MINWOOK, and CHOI JUYOUNG.)

1942
01:29:30,069 --> 01:29:32,868
(Team "MOMMAE" has KANG HEEMIN, KIM HYUNJAE,)

1943
01:29:32,869 --> 01:29:34,539
(YICHEN, and JUNG SEYUN.)

1944
01:29:35,109 --> 01:29:38,139
Any team will want our members for the looks.

1945
01:29:38,140 --> 01:29:40,250
I'm sure any team will go after our looks.

1946
01:29:40,609 --> 01:29:41,908
Our team members all look nice.

1947
01:29:41,909 --> 01:29:44,019
Of course.

1948
01:29:44,020 --> 01:29:45,118
We're a team with great looks.

1949
01:29:45,119 --> 01:29:47,850
Change your pose. SUNGMIN, come on.

1950
01:29:47,949 --> 01:29:48,959
(Proud of his looks)

1951
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:51,890
Yes, we have great looks.

1952
01:29:52,189 --> 01:29:54,389
I think each member has a great charm too.

1953
01:29:54,390 --> 01:29:55,599
Right.

1954
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:58,129
I think we all have different charms.

1955
01:29:58,130 --> 01:29:59,369
- Six of us. - Yes.

1956
01:29:59,430 --> 01:30:01,099
I think we can make a team...

1957
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:04,340
that pleases the audience's ears and eyes.

1958
01:30:05,170 --> 01:30:06,908
Now that we're comfortable with each other,

1959
01:30:06,909 --> 01:30:08,978
we need to decide on the most important element.

1960
01:30:08,979 --> 01:30:12,250
- We need to decide on the leader. - Right.

1961
01:30:12,380 --> 01:30:14,649
Who wants to do it?

1962
01:30:15,109 --> 01:30:16,618
(KWON YONGHYUN and AHN JUNWON apply.)

1963
01:30:16,619 --> 01:30:18,719
- Include me too. - Okay.

1964
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:20,148
- Include me too. - JIWOON.

1965
01:30:20,149 --> 01:30:21,449
Three of us. Okay.

1966
01:30:22,859 --> 01:30:24,658
I became the leader.

1967
01:30:24,659 --> 01:30:26,659
(Trainee AHN JUNWON became the leader for the second time.)

1968
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:29,899
I think a leader needs to lead the team members...

1969
01:30:30,260 --> 01:30:32,430
with passion and energy.

1970
01:30:32,529 --> 01:30:35,469
He looked most energetic,

1971
01:30:35,470 --> 01:30:36,539
so we chose him.

1972
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:39,309
First, let's listen...

1973
01:30:39,310 --> 01:30:40,810
- to the song. - Okay.

1974
01:30:41,069 --> 01:30:43,140
(Deciding on the parts after listening to the song)

1975
01:30:43,539 --> 01:30:46,278
- Your tender eyes - Your tender eyes

1976
01:30:46,279 --> 01:30:51,049
- I can't reject it - I can't reject it

1977
01:30:51,050 --> 01:30:54,390
Yeah

1978
01:30:54,649 --> 01:30:56,960
(Amazed)

1979
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:00,429
If it's okay with you, you should be our main vocalist.

1980
01:31:00,430 --> 01:31:02,090
It's a unanimous decision.

1981
01:31:02,260 --> 01:31:03,959
A main vocalist...

1982
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:07,769
is the center of the vocal and should lead the team.

1983
01:31:07,770 --> 01:31:09,339
- I thought you should do it. - Okay.

1984
01:31:09,340 --> 01:31:10,639
I got it.

1985
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:12,169
I'll do my best to lead this team.

1986
01:31:12,170 --> 01:31:13,869
- Okay. - Great.

1987
01:31:14,409 --> 01:31:17,439
Honestly, the main vocalist of "Don't Go..."

1988
01:31:18,010 --> 01:31:20,210
should be YONGHYUN.

1989
01:31:20,579 --> 01:31:24,249
Don't get out of my view

1990
01:31:24,250 --> 01:31:25,250
Even if morning comes

1991
01:31:25,251 --> 01:31:26,719
His voice is so neat.

1992
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:28,019
It sounded neat,

1993
01:31:28,020 --> 01:31:30,219
and I thought, "This is what an idol should be."

1994
01:31:30,220 --> 01:31:33,829
He was what a main vocalist should be.

1995
01:31:34,289 --> 01:31:36,959
The first chorus is yours.

1996
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:38,099
Definitely.

1997
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:39,970
You sound so stable.

1998
01:31:40,170 --> 01:31:42,869
I'll sing two lines here.

1999
01:31:42,970 --> 01:31:45,609
We need to decide on each part clearly.

2000
01:31:45,770 --> 01:31:48,469
Let's efficiently decide on the parts...

2001
01:31:48,470 --> 01:31:50,239
that each of us can do the best.

2002
01:31:50,380 --> 01:31:51,539
- Great. - Yes.

2003
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:53,648
Most of our members...

2004
01:31:53,649 --> 01:31:56,850
haven't learned how to sing.

2005
01:31:56,979 --> 01:32:00,289
I haven't practised singing.

2006
01:32:00,390 --> 01:32:03,390
I haven't learned to sing either.

2007
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:06,329
I'm not that skilled and I haven't learned to sing,

2008
01:32:06,430 --> 01:32:09,529
but I'm determined to work hard on it.

2009
01:32:09,729 --> 01:32:11,159
It isn't all that bad.

2010
01:32:11,329 --> 01:32:14,130
They have a strong will to do something.

2011
01:32:14,270 --> 01:32:15,430
This part...

2012
01:32:15,699 --> 01:32:16,799
is what I want to do.

2013
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:18,438
- Let's have a listen. - Can you try it?

2014
01:32:18,439 --> 01:32:19,639
I want this.

2015
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:22,038
I think the tone they have...

2016
01:32:22,039 --> 01:32:24,709
is their talent.

2017
01:32:24,710 --> 01:32:27,350
(Each member sings a measure.)

2018
01:32:27,449 --> 01:32:29,578
My beautiful butterfly

2019
01:32:29,579 --> 01:32:30,579
I like that.

2020
01:32:30,579 --> 01:32:31,579
(Nodding)

2021
01:32:31,580 --> 01:32:33,389
A small gesture

2022
01:32:33,390 --> 01:32:36,920
Stirs up my heart

2023
01:32:37,619 --> 01:32:38,759
- JUNWON. - Yes.

2024
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:41,528
"A small gesture stirs up my heart."

2025
01:32:41,529 --> 01:32:43,099
- That part sounds amazing. - Really?

2026
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:44,299
That's totally your part.

2027
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:45,398
Thank you.

2028
01:32:45,399 --> 01:32:46,528
(Team "Don't Go" is exchanging compliments and admiration.)

2029
01:32:46,529 --> 01:32:48,499
If we can refine each member,

2030
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:50,170
Team "Don't Go..."

2031
01:32:50,239 --> 01:32:53,810
might take the first place among vocal teams.

2032
01:32:55,109 --> 01:32:57,139
(They begin practising based on the parts.)

2033
01:32:57,140 --> 01:33:00,108
Have my one and only soul stolen

2034
01:33:00,109 --> 01:33:02,420
(Team "Love wins all" watches them.)

2035
01:33:02,979 --> 01:33:04,719
Even if morning comes

2036
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:06,590
They decided on the parts already.

2037
01:33:08,489 --> 01:33:09,919
Are we going too slow?

2038
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:12,459
(Trainee Yoo Youngseo is the leader of Team "Love wins all".)

2039
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:14,889
Compared to other teams,

2040
01:33:14,890 --> 01:33:17,500
our team is proceeding slowly.

2041
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:20,129
But I think a leader needs to listen...

2042
01:33:20,130 --> 01:33:23,100
what every member says.

2043
01:33:23,199 --> 01:33:26,109
I'll do my best for the team.

2044
01:33:27,340 --> 01:33:29,179
Can each of you say the part you want to do?

2045
01:33:29,180 --> 01:33:31,010
I think that's how...

2046
01:33:31,510 --> 01:33:34,379
- we can arrange things one by one. - Right.

2047
01:33:34,380 --> 01:33:36,520
I think we're going a bit slow.

2048
01:33:36,750 --> 01:33:39,850
I think each of us should sing the song in turn.

2049
01:33:39,949 --> 01:33:41,648
- One by one? - Yes, all of us.

2050
01:33:41,649 --> 01:33:42,658
For each part?

2051
01:33:42,659 --> 01:33:45,359
Anyway, we're a team.

2052
01:33:45,420 --> 01:33:47,729
When we decide on the parts,

2053
01:33:47,829 --> 01:33:49,899
those who find these parts tough...

2054
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:54,229
should take the easier ones in the beginning.

2055
01:33:54,670 --> 01:33:57,069
I think we should consider that too.

2056
01:33:57,500 --> 01:33:58,839
I think...

2057
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:01,108
the first part...

2058
01:34:01,109 --> 01:34:02,938
is the most important.

2059
01:34:02,939 --> 01:34:04,978
- That's what I think too. - Right.

2060
01:34:04,979 --> 01:34:07,448
- I see. - I think this part,

2061
01:34:07,449 --> 01:34:10,479
the two words here...

2062
01:34:10,850 --> 01:34:13,850
will decide the result.

2063
01:34:13,989 --> 01:34:16,389
I think the member with the most impact...

2064
01:34:16,390 --> 01:34:18,519
should sing this part.

2065
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:20,089
That's why.

2066
01:34:20,090 --> 01:34:22,529
(After all, everyone sings in turn.)

2067
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:24,859
My universe

2068
01:34:26,329 --> 01:34:29,068
(As different members want the same parts,)

2069
01:34:29,069 --> 01:34:33,908
(Team "Love wins all" has trouble practising.)

2070
01:34:33,909 --> 01:34:38,010
To where I can't imagine

2071
01:34:40,380 --> 01:34:41,809
Can I try one more time?

2072
01:34:41,810 --> 01:34:43,979
- Me too. - The first part.

2073
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:45,849
I want to try again.

2074
01:34:45,850 --> 01:34:46,890
- Okay. - Yes.

2075
01:34:48,449 --> 01:34:51,090
Speaking of dividing up the parts,

2076
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:54,960
everyone has ambitions for his part.

2077
01:34:55,090 --> 01:34:56,759
Because of that,

2078
01:34:56,760 --> 01:34:59,199
our team seems to proceed slowly.

2079
01:34:59,670 --> 01:35:02,799
I personally think SEOKHEE...

2080
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:04,340
suits this part the best.

2081
01:35:04,539 --> 01:35:06,438
I choose YOUNGSEO.

2082
01:35:06,439 --> 01:35:08,270
I choose YOUNGSEO.

2083
01:35:09,180 --> 01:35:10,239
I choose CHENYU.

2084
01:35:10,510 --> 01:35:12,409
I choose CHENYU.

2085
01:35:12,579 --> 01:35:14,510
- Let's point to one in 1, 2, 3. - Okay.

2086
01:35:14,810 --> 01:35:16,049
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

2087
01:35:16,050 --> 01:35:17,619
(YOUNGSEO wins three votes.)

2088
01:35:18,250 --> 01:35:20,449
YOUNGSEO will take the part.

2089
01:35:21,149 --> 01:35:22,759
- Thank you. - It's been decided.

2090
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:23,919
I'll do my best.

2091
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:25,260
It was a shame.

2092
01:35:25,289 --> 01:35:27,529
Actually, I'm the main vocalist.

2093
01:35:27,890 --> 01:35:31,260
All five members sang and voted.

2094
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:34,399
Four voted for me.

2095
01:35:36,069 --> 01:35:37,538
- CHENYU. - Okay.

2096
01:35:37,539 --> 01:35:40,840
I want to sing the beginning part,

2097
01:35:41,039 --> 01:35:44,880
but our leader wants to do so many things.

2098
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:47,479
I want to sing the chorus.

2099
01:35:47,579 --> 01:35:50,249
Both of us want the chorus.

2100
01:35:50,250 --> 01:35:53,920
I want to take the second chorus.

2101
01:35:54,689 --> 01:35:57,460
- Then I want to sing the bridge. - Bridge.

2102
01:35:57,520 --> 01:35:58,689
I want the bridge too.

2103
01:35:58,720 --> 01:35:59,859
- Bridge. - Yes.

2104
01:36:00,460 --> 01:36:02,389
No one wants the pre-chorus?

2105
01:36:02,390 --> 01:36:05,729
- No. Why is it? - It's because it's a small part.

2106
01:36:07,069 --> 01:36:08,369
Then,

2107
01:36:08,970 --> 01:36:11,568
- two of you took the bridge. - The chorus.

2108
01:36:11,569 --> 01:36:12,868
I guess one of you...

2109
01:36:12,869 --> 01:36:16,609
needs to move to the pre-chorus part.

2110
01:36:17,939 --> 01:36:19,978
It's my first time being a leader.

2111
01:36:19,979 --> 01:36:21,850
I think I underestimated the role.

2112
01:36:23,680 --> 01:36:24,978
This is hard.

2113
01:36:24,979 --> 01:36:27,149
(Team "Love wins all" is having a hard time from the start.)

2114
01:36:28,350 --> 01:36:30,560
Team "We Must Love," come here.

2115
01:36:31,159 --> 01:36:33,189
Let's choose the leader first.

2116
01:36:33,460 --> 01:36:35,688
Raise your hand if you want to be the leader. In 1, 2, 3.

2117
01:36:35,689 --> 01:36:37,699
(Two members want to be the leader.)

2118
01:36:38,399 --> 01:36:39,799
(CHO HYOJIN and KIM YOUNGHOON apply.)

2119
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:41,100
We have two applicants.

2120
01:36:41,630 --> 01:36:44,069
First, you need to show us what you got.

2121
01:36:44,239 --> 01:36:46,409
I've liked this song, "We Must Love..."

2122
01:36:46,710 --> 01:36:49,068
for a long time.

2123
01:36:49,069 --> 01:36:51,739
I can teach you right away if you ask.

2124
01:36:52,810 --> 01:36:55,310
Personally,

2125
01:36:55,710 --> 01:36:57,879
I was a member of a group for a long time.

2126
01:36:57,880 --> 01:36:59,448
In practising and all,

2127
01:36:59,449 --> 01:37:02,318
I think I can lead you...

2128
01:37:02,319 --> 01:37:03,720
in an efficient way.

2129
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:04,889
That's all I have to say.

2130
01:37:04,890 --> 01:37:06,129
(Which of them will be the leader?)

2131
01:37:06,130 --> 01:37:07,359
I like both of you.

2132
01:37:08,359 --> 01:37:11,930
I became the leader of Team "We Must Love."

2133
01:37:12,359 --> 01:37:13,630
He has leadership,

2134
01:37:13,930 --> 01:37:15,799
and he's good at listening to all the opinions...

2135
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:18,899
and clearly adjusting things when needed.

2136
01:37:19,270 --> 01:37:21,538
I want to make a performance that shows...

2137
01:37:21,539 --> 01:37:25,180
both the level of completion as a team and individual charms.

2138
01:37:26,779 --> 01:37:28,409
You know my name.

2139
01:37:28,609 --> 01:37:29,618
Of course.

2140
01:37:29,619 --> 01:37:30,720
(They decided on the leader quietly.)

2141
01:37:31,420 --> 01:37:34,189
We're Team "Love me or Leave me."

2142
01:37:35,189 --> 01:37:36,789
- Nice. - Great.

2143
01:37:37,489 --> 01:37:38,959
Since we listened to each other's singing,

2144
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:40,288
we all have a sense...

2145
01:37:40,289 --> 01:37:43,060
of each member's singing ability, right?

2146
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:48,369
(A voice that fills Project Village)

2147
01:37:49,699 --> 01:37:52,270
Team "Love me or Leave me" had strong members.

2148
01:37:52,670 --> 01:37:55,978
I thought HYUNWOO would do great in that team,

2149
01:37:55,979 --> 01:37:58,710
and saw him there.

2150
01:37:59,609 --> 01:38:03,180
I want to be a leader.

2151
01:38:03,279 --> 01:38:06,119
You clearly expressed your opinion.

2152
01:38:06,420 --> 01:38:08,589
We have a great song and great members.

2153
01:38:08,590 --> 01:38:12,959
I thought we could make a great performance...

2154
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:14,288
with those elements.

2155
01:38:14,289 --> 01:38:16,328
As the oldest member here,

2156
01:38:16,329 --> 01:38:19,130
I'll do my best to consolidate all five members' opinions.

2157
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:21,170
- I'll do my best. - We can do it.

2158
01:38:21,529 --> 01:38:23,339
Let's have a ceremony for our leader.

2159
01:38:23,340 --> 01:38:26,269
How can I do that? Like this, like in "The Lion King?"

2160
01:38:26,270 --> 01:38:28,170
- On your left arm. - Wear it on your left arm.

2161
01:38:28,210 --> 01:38:30,079
- That looks good on you. - Your posture is proper.

2162
01:38:30,340 --> 01:38:31,909
(Trainee KIM SIHUN is chosen as a leader.)

2163
01:38:32,140 --> 01:38:34,649
- Shall we sing the song in turn? - I think we should do that.

2164
01:38:34,750 --> 01:38:36,449
I'll get close to listen to your song.

2165
01:38:36,819 --> 01:38:37,979
You must feel pressured.

2166
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:42,788
I will hold my breath and wait for your answer

2167
01:38:42,789 --> 01:38:46,429
It's your turn now

2168
01:38:46,430 --> 01:38:47,489
What was that?

2169
01:38:48,029 --> 01:38:49,559
I didn't know you sang in that style.

2170
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:51,699
- Na Hoon A is here. - What was that?

2171
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:54,300
(KANG HYUNWOO takes the baton.)

2172
01:38:55,729 --> 01:38:58,269
Even if the answer is no

2173
01:38:58,270 --> 01:38:59,340
(Glancing)

2174
01:38:59,909 --> 01:39:03,039
(Trainees sing in turn.)

2175
01:39:03,210 --> 01:39:06,649
It's your turn now

2176
01:39:08,850 --> 01:39:10,849
Great. TAEHWAN gets A.

2177
01:39:10,850 --> 01:39:12,578
You have a strong voice.

2178
01:39:12,579 --> 01:39:13,720
(Glancing again)

2179
01:39:13,750 --> 01:39:17,189
Baby, love me or leave me tonight

2180
01:39:17,289 --> 01:39:18,659
(The leader is very satisfied.)

2181
01:39:19,630 --> 01:39:21,930
He's a terrific singer.

2182
01:39:22,529 --> 01:39:25,060
(Things are going smoothly.)

2183
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:28,199
(Meanwhile)

2184
01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:32,539
He has a great tone.

2185
01:39:33,140 --> 01:39:35,140
(They feel rushed.)

2186
01:39:36,079 --> 01:39:37,079
We need to divide up the parts now.

2187
01:39:37,079 --> 01:39:38,079
Right, of course.

2188
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:39,478
I want the second part of verse one.

2189
01:39:39,479 --> 01:39:40,578
Me too.

2190
01:39:40,579 --> 01:39:42,049
Strange things are happening to me

2191
01:39:42,050 --> 01:39:45,318
(Two trainees applied for the same part.)

2192
01:39:45,319 --> 01:39:49,619
Strange things are happening to me

2193
01:39:50,260 --> 01:39:51,960
- I choose YOUNGHOON. - Okay.

2194
01:39:55,090 --> 01:39:56,729
- To be honest... - Yes.

2195
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:01,930
Honestly, I wasn't satisfied with my part.

2196
01:40:03,970 --> 01:40:05,670
- It's my personal opinion. - Yes.

2197
01:40:05,970 --> 01:40:07,840
I think YOUNGHOON...

2198
01:40:08,140 --> 01:40:11,379
is competent in high notes.

2199
01:40:11,380 --> 01:40:12,479
His tone is also great.

2200
01:40:12,539 --> 01:40:13,779
- So I think... - Yes?

2201
01:40:14,050 --> 01:40:15,509
you can give me this part.

2202
01:40:15,510 --> 01:40:17,779
You can take another one.

2203
01:40:17,850 --> 01:40:19,989
You can take another one.

2204
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:27,229
But this is a survival show.

2205
01:40:27,359 --> 01:40:30,358
I think you need to prove yourself.

2206
01:40:30,359 --> 01:40:32,769
When saying that,

2207
01:40:32,770 --> 01:40:35,028
you can first show your weapon...

2208
01:40:35,029 --> 01:40:36,800
and your characteristics.

2209
01:40:37,039 --> 01:40:39,608
We can decide depending on what you show.

2210
01:40:39,609 --> 01:40:41,470
I honestly think that's the best.

2211
01:40:42,069 --> 01:40:43,579
Even if you sing one verse,

2212
01:40:43,979 --> 01:40:47,210
if it attracts the audience, it can become the highlight.

2213
01:40:50,220 --> 01:40:52,149
I know YOUNGHOON well.

2214
01:40:52,819 --> 01:40:54,988
He's very sweet and gentle.

2215
01:40:54,989 --> 01:40:58,420
He can't say negative things in a direct manner.

2216
01:40:58,760 --> 01:41:02,229
YOUNGHOON was on the same team as me in the past.

2217
01:41:03,260 --> 01:41:05,100
(Trainee KIM YOUNGHOON left the team before the debut.)

2218
01:41:06,670 --> 01:41:09,569
I was surprised to see him here.

2219
01:41:09,670 --> 01:41:12,039
I'd feel more nervous when YOUNGHOON performs.

2220
01:41:12,439 --> 01:41:13,909
I hope he performs well.

2221
01:41:14,539 --> 01:41:15,609
You can do it.

2222
01:41:16,180 --> 01:41:20,350
Honestly, I didn't have someone to depend on...

2223
01:41:20,710 --> 01:41:22,209
and I was worried a lot.

2224
01:41:22,210 --> 01:41:25,249
Whenever I saw HYOJIN I felt relieved,

2225
01:41:25,250 --> 01:41:26,949
and he gave me energy.

2226
01:41:27,390 --> 01:41:31,659
The harmony parts of "We must love..."

2227
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:33,430
should be considered too.

2228
01:41:33,789 --> 01:41:35,488
Did anything happen?

2229
01:41:35,489 --> 01:41:36,499
Yes, that's how you should sing it.

2230
01:41:36,500 --> 01:41:37,699
Did anything happen?

2231
01:41:37,729 --> 01:41:39,469
I think that was close.

2232
01:41:39,470 --> 01:41:40,569
I'll work on it.

2233
01:41:41,029 --> 01:41:42,999
You need to breathe out here.

2234
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:46,469
(CHO HYOJIN helps with the vocal practice.)

2235
01:41:46,470 --> 01:41:48,670
It was nice. Let's try again.

2236
01:41:49,210 --> 01:41:50,509
In 7, 8.

2237
01:41:50,510 --> 01:41:52,739
(How will Team "Love me or Leave me" go with these two trainees?)

2238
01:41:54,609 --> 01:41:56,279
Team "Pop" is here.

2239
01:41:57,250 --> 01:41:58,319
Let's give ourselves a hand.

2240
01:41:59,380 --> 01:42:01,890
(A timid applause)

2241
01:42:02,789 --> 01:42:04,819
(Feeling awkward)

2242
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:08,930
It's awkward.

2243
01:42:10,699 --> 01:42:13,329
Does anyone want to be the leader?

2244
01:42:14,130 --> 01:42:15,970
(Just blinking)

2245
01:42:17,899 --> 01:42:20,109
Maybe we could introduce ourselves starting this side.

2246
01:42:20,670 --> 01:42:23,810
Hello, I'm KANG JIMIN, born in 2008.

2247
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:25,380
I'll do my best.

2248
01:42:26,380 --> 01:42:28,849
I'm KIM JIHWAN, born in 2007.

2249
01:42:28,850 --> 01:42:30,949
I'll work hard as I'm lacking.

2250
01:42:31,979 --> 01:42:35,449
It was nice because it seemed like they were all nice people.

2251
01:42:36,149 --> 01:42:38,460
They were all very soft.

2252
01:42:38,659 --> 01:42:41,529
They seemed shy and timid.

2253
01:42:41,729 --> 01:42:43,100
What name should we give the team?

2254
01:42:43,659 --> 01:42:45,960
We could use the image of our team.

2255
01:42:46,630 --> 01:42:48,299
- Shy Boy. - Shy Pop.

2256
01:42:48,300 --> 01:42:50,399
- Shy Pop. - POP SHY.

2257
01:42:50,699 --> 01:42:52,140
I think POP SHY is nice.

2258
01:42:52,239 --> 01:42:53,470
I think it's good.

2259
01:42:54,539 --> 01:42:58,109
(They watch the choreography together.)

2260
01:42:59,380 --> 01:43:00,909
(Focusing)

2261
01:43:01,409 --> 01:43:02,949
(Dancing)

2262
01:43:03,319 --> 01:43:04,379
It's difficult.

2263
01:43:04,380 --> 01:43:06,319
(The best reaction of the shy boys.)

2264
01:43:11,060 --> 01:43:12,720
The choreography was to my style.

2265
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:16,659
So I thought I could do it well.

2266
01:43:16,829 --> 01:43:18,659
It had a street style,

2267
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:21,899
and it was a new genre, so I think it will be fun.

2268
01:43:22,369 --> 01:43:24,170
I'm confident.

2269
01:43:24,539 --> 01:43:26,738
It was like a choreography,

2270
01:43:26,739 --> 01:43:28,510
so I rather liked it.

2271
01:43:29,369 --> 01:43:32,279
(ABE YURA was complimented in the dance class.)

2272
01:43:33,050 --> 01:43:34,949
(Best dancer in Gyeongju, SEO JINWON)

2273
01:43:37,020 --> 01:43:39,250
(Best dancer in Busan, KO MINSUNG)

2274
01:43:40,390 --> 01:43:42,589
- Turn it here and put it here. - Turn it.

2275
01:43:42,590 --> 01:43:44,420
- You do this. - Then hit it.

2276
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:46,590
Hit it and drop your head as well.

2277
01:43:48,359 --> 01:43:49,389
(As soon as they start practising,)

2278
01:43:49,390 --> 01:43:52,528
One and two and three and four.

2279
01:43:52,529 --> 01:43:53,629
(their eyes change.)

2280
01:43:53,630 --> 01:43:55,099
One and two and...

2281
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:56,300
three and four.

2282
01:43:56,500 --> 01:43:57,769
(They get used to the choreography after a few practices.)

2283
01:43:57,770 --> 01:43:59,100
Three and four and...

2284
01:43:59,170 --> 01:44:02,139
five, six, and seven, eight.

2285
01:44:02,140 --> 01:44:03,608
(They're progressing well.)

2286
01:44:03,609 --> 01:44:05,078
Three and four and...

2287
01:44:05,079 --> 01:44:07,510
- five, six, seven, eight. - Five, six, seven, eight.

2288
01:44:07,880 --> 01:44:09,618
One, two, three...

2289
01:44:09,619 --> 01:44:13,289
Many of us were good at dancing,

2290
01:44:14,090 --> 01:44:15,619
so we learned it quickly.

2291
01:44:15,819 --> 01:44:17,459
Seven, eight.

2292
01:44:17,460 --> 01:44:19,358
Our team's teamwork was very good...

2293
01:44:19,359 --> 01:44:22,260
when we were practising earlier.

2294
01:44:22,930 --> 01:44:24,199
So I look forward to it.

2295
01:44:29,800 --> 01:44:32,640
(They're silent during break time.)

2296
01:44:33,340 --> 01:44:35,709
Watching this reminds me of that.

2297
01:44:35,710 --> 01:44:36,938
(Their voices get louder when they talk about dancing.)

2298
01:44:36,939 --> 01:44:38,179
And then this.

2299
01:44:38,180 --> 01:44:40,979
(How will the shy boys' "Pop" look?)

2300
01:44:41,609 --> 01:44:43,349
- Let's go! - Let's go.

2301
01:44:43,350 --> 01:44:44,350
(Meanwhile, this place is filled with loud voices.)

2302
01:44:44,949 --> 01:44:46,618
(Training room of Team "Kiwi")

2303
01:44:46,619 --> 01:44:48,050
I'm so tired.

2304
01:44:48,149 --> 01:44:49,489
Be quiet.

2305
01:44:50,920 --> 01:44:53,529
(But their first meeting...)

2306
01:44:54,229 --> 01:44:56,398
I applied for singing first.

2307
01:44:56,399 --> 01:44:59,198
I wanted to go for the vocals.

2308
01:44:59,199 --> 01:45:00,500
I wanted to be the vocal member.

2309
01:45:00,630 --> 01:45:04,038
Many people didn't have dancing as their first choice.

2310
01:45:04,039 --> 01:45:06,139
It was a team with many members...

2311
01:45:06,140 --> 01:45:08,170
who weren't confident in dancing.

2312
01:45:08,770 --> 01:45:10,409
So I'm a bit worried.

2313
01:45:11,510 --> 01:45:13,550
I became the leader.

2314
01:45:14,310 --> 01:45:16,550
Some of us are here because we had no choice.

2315
01:45:16,949 --> 01:45:19,148
Even if we may not be the best,

2316
01:45:19,149 --> 01:45:20,489
we can work our best to make a great stage.

2317
01:45:20,789 --> 01:45:23,119
That would be a great warrior story if we become the best.

2318
01:45:23,260 --> 01:45:26,829
Our team's main dancer is KIM JOONWOO.

2319
01:45:27,659 --> 01:45:29,059
(He was elected smoothly.)

2320
01:45:29,060 --> 01:45:30,260
Thank you.

2321
01:45:31,359 --> 01:45:33,300
Let's start practising now.

2322
01:45:33,430 --> 01:45:34,568
- Okay. - Okay.

2323
01:45:34,569 --> 01:45:36,970
We'll go with the music like this,

2324
01:45:37,270 --> 01:45:40,470
this, and this.

2325
01:45:40,710 --> 01:45:43,109
Let's do it up to this part.

2326
01:45:43,409 --> 01:45:44,409
We'll go again.

2327
01:45:44,410 --> 01:45:47,109
(Standing still)

2328
01:45:47,909 --> 01:45:49,509
The choreography was so difficult.

2329
01:45:49,510 --> 01:45:51,180
I thought I would get overloaded.

2330
01:45:51,750 --> 01:45:53,789
I was just blank.

2331
01:45:56,119 --> 01:46:01,260
(This is the choreography that they have to pull off.)

2332
01:46:04,859 --> 01:46:06,670
We had the dancing position,

2333
01:46:07,199 --> 01:46:09,270
but not many people had much experience in dancing.

2334
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:13,000
You move your chest in this state.

2335
01:46:13,670 --> 01:46:14,738
One, two.

2336
01:46:14,739 --> 01:46:16,539
(Many of the trainees can't follow.)

2337
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:19,850
It's not the shoulder. You should use the chest.

2338
01:46:20,149 --> 01:46:21,380
Go down two times.

2339
01:46:22,380 --> 01:46:23,919
(The leader is also confused.)

2340
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:24,979
Hold on.

2341
01:46:25,050 --> 01:46:28,349
I was shocked because we were worse...

2342
01:46:28,350 --> 01:46:29,420
than I thought.

2343
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:33,359
So I wanted to help with the parts I could help.

2344
01:46:33,829 --> 01:46:35,430
This is how it is.

2345
01:46:38,060 --> 01:46:41,869
It's like someone is pulling out this part.

2346
01:46:42,430 --> 01:46:45,869
Pull. Like this.

2347
01:46:46,369 --> 01:46:49,640
Shall we do this together again?

2348
01:46:51,409 --> 01:46:52,680
It will work if we practice.

2349
01:46:52,779 --> 01:46:54,050
I don't think it's impossible.

2350
01:46:54,880 --> 01:46:56,879
HYUNWOO came out to teach us...

2351
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:59,278
whenever we were confused...

2352
01:46:59,279 --> 01:47:00,720
and showed us the details.

2353
01:47:01,149 --> 01:47:04,459
He was like the sub-leader.

2354
01:47:04,460 --> 01:47:06,020
He is a great help.

2355
01:47:06,729 --> 01:47:09,529
Bring it up here and throw it.

2356
01:47:09,590 --> 01:47:11,460
- Everyone was doing their best. - Okay.

2357
01:47:12,060 --> 01:47:14,529
So I think there's a chance.

2358
01:47:15,699 --> 01:47:18,170
I thought I should do my best.

2359
01:47:18,239 --> 01:47:19,339
Let's go.

2360
01:47:19,340 --> 01:47:21,939
(Will they be able to write a victorious story...)

2361
01:47:23,409 --> 01:47:25,108
(with the help of some members?)

2362
01:47:25,109 --> 01:47:26,210
Okay.

2363
01:47:29,079 --> 01:47:31,619
We came here to decide the leader, right?

2364
01:47:31,819 --> 01:47:32,919
- Right. - Right.

2365
01:47:32,920 --> 01:47:36,520
If anyone wants to recommend others or themselves...

2366
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:38,818
I don't think we know each other well.

2367
01:47:38,819 --> 01:47:40,858
I was in the same team with only one person here,

2368
01:47:40,859 --> 01:47:43,328
so I don't know you so well.

2369
01:47:43,329 --> 01:47:47,100
There were so many people I was never in the same team with.

2370
01:47:47,670 --> 01:47:50,238
There are many P3 members in our team.

2371
01:47:50,239 --> 01:47:52,300
There are 8 or 9 of them.

2372
01:47:53,909 --> 01:47:56,209
It's a team...

2373
01:47:56,210 --> 01:47:57,880
with many people from P3.

2374
01:47:58,439 --> 01:47:59,639
KYOUNGBAE, get it together.

2375
01:47:59,640 --> 01:48:01,408
He's thinking.

2376
01:48:01,409 --> 01:48:02,750
I'm not sleepy.

2377
01:48:02,850 --> 01:48:06,448
I think the other people would feel a bit left out.

2378
01:48:06,449 --> 01:48:07,449
I am too.

2379
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:09,519
We also know that this team...

2380
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:11,689
is somewhat centered around P3 members.

2381
01:48:12,619 --> 01:48:14,589
Even if that's true,

2382
01:48:14,590 --> 01:48:17,930
I don't want us to carry the image that we're P3 members throughout.

2383
01:48:18,399 --> 01:48:20,698
I wanted to be a leader...

2384
01:48:20,699 --> 01:48:22,969
who can support from the back...

2385
01:48:22,970 --> 01:48:25,100
rather than stand in the front.

2386
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:28,969
Since we'll have people being eliminated in this mission...

2387
01:48:28,970 --> 01:48:31,640
and we don't know how that will affect us,

2388
01:48:32,109 --> 01:48:34,509
I want to make a situation where we get benefits.

2389
01:48:34,510 --> 01:48:36,509
So I promise that I'll make that situation...

2390
01:48:36,510 --> 01:48:38,979
if you trust and follow me.

2391
01:48:39,350 --> 01:48:40,589
- Yes. - Okay.

2392
01:48:40,590 --> 01:48:42,188
(Who will be the leader of Team "Closer?")

2393
01:48:42,189 --> 01:48:45,390
(KANG MINSEO)

2394
01:48:46,090 --> 01:48:49,229
(The armband was given to KANG WANGSEOK.)

2395
01:48:49,260 --> 01:48:51,129
I think they don't trust others...

2396
01:48:51,130 --> 01:48:54,500
other than the P3 members.

2397
01:48:54,829 --> 01:48:57,100
Candidate one, KANG WANGSEOK.

2398
01:49:02,369 --> 01:49:04,140
Candidate two, KANG MINSEO.

2399
01:49:08,449 --> 01:49:11,079
KANG WANGSEOK, leader.

2400
01:49:11,579 --> 01:49:12,649
Thank you.

2401
01:49:15,289 --> 01:49:17,459
Five, six, and seven.

2402
01:49:17,460 --> 01:49:18,890
(They start practising.)

2403
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:21,889
One, two, three, four.

2404
01:49:21,890 --> 01:49:22,929
(Team "Closer" is divided into two groups.)

2405
01:49:22,930 --> 01:49:25,300
- One, two, and three. - From here...

2406
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:28,198
Five, six, and seven, eight.

2407
01:49:28,199 --> 01:49:30,899
We temporarily fixed that.

2408
01:49:31,300 --> 01:49:34,039
Then eight members will come in in a line.

2409
01:49:34,310 --> 01:49:37,210
If that's me,

2410
01:49:37,439 --> 01:49:38,609
I'll be here,

2411
01:49:38,710 --> 01:49:40,310
and two will come behind.

2412
01:49:40,779 --> 01:49:43,319
And one will be here.

2413
01:49:43,880 --> 01:49:46,279
I was personally frustrated.

2414
01:49:46,449 --> 01:49:49,090
What is this? Will we do it the same way?

2415
01:49:50,189 --> 01:49:51,720
- Yes. - The same way?

2416
01:49:52,189 --> 01:49:56,059
I thought learning the choreography should come first.

2417
01:49:56,060 --> 01:49:58,858
But we were using time...

2418
01:49:58,859 --> 01:50:00,130
in making the formation.

2419
01:50:00,270 --> 01:50:02,970
I thought it was very inefficient.

2420
01:50:03,500 --> 01:50:04,938
I thought if we continued this way,

2421
01:50:04,939 --> 01:50:08,739
the members would become tired.

2422
01:50:08,909 --> 01:50:09,909
I don't think...

2423
01:50:10,140 --> 01:50:13,579
we should proceed like this.

2424
01:50:14,250 --> 01:50:17,720
I think we should learn the choreography first...

2425
01:50:17,819 --> 01:50:19,578
and then make a simple formation...

2426
01:50:19,579 --> 01:50:21,519
to fit that.

2427
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:24,589
I don't think we should spend time in setting the formation now.

2428
01:50:24,590 --> 01:50:26,260
(Are they having a conflict in the practising method?)

2429
01:50:27,329 --> 01:50:28,829
The leader...

2430
01:50:29,359 --> 01:50:32,399
will be JUNSEO.

2431
01:50:32,600 --> 01:50:33,800
I've become the leader.

2432
01:50:34,229 --> 01:50:37,499
I was the leader when we worked on the title song.

2433
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:39,500
So I wanted to step back this time.

2434
01:50:39,899 --> 01:50:42,339
There were so many things to take care of.

2435
01:50:42,340 --> 01:50:44,380
It was honestly tiresome.

2436
01:50:45,109 --> 01:50:46,809
(During the leader election)

2437
01:50:46,810 --> 01:50:48,949
But my hand went up automatically.

2438
01:50:49,149 --> 01:50:51,250
It was like I was bewitched.

2439
01:50:52,550 --> 01:50:53,750
I realized I made a mistake.

2440
01:50:54,250 --> 01:50:55,519
I think JUNSEO...

2441
01:50:55,520 --> 01:50:57,760
got used to being the leader.

2442
01:50:58,560 --> 01:50:59,889
Let's focus.

2443
01:50:59,890 --> 01:51:01,590
(They check the choreography together.)

2444
01:51:02,430 --> 01:51:03,460
Look.

2445
01:51:06,869 --> 01:51:08,270
RyuD did it himself.

2446
01:51:10,340 --> 01:51:12,339
I think the focus will be on expressing...

2447
01:51:12,340 --> 01:51:13,939
a relaxed and mature vibe.

2448
01:51:15,939 --> 01:51:19,238
- It's cool. - We haven't warmed up yet,

2449
01:51:19,239 --> 01:51:21,880
- so let's individually warm up. - Okay.

2450
01:51:22,010 --> 01:51:25,680
JIAHN and I planned to learn the choreography.

2451
01:51:26,350 --> 01:51:29,819
("3D" by Jung Kook)

2452
01:51:29,949 --> 01:51:31,760
I think it will take some time to learn it completely.

2453
01:51:32,989 --> 01:51:34,488
- JIAHN. - Yes?

2454
01:51:34,489 --> 01:51:35,590
Are you done with the first part?

2455
01:51:36,659 --> 01:51:38,359
(What?)

2456
01:51:38,460 --> 01:51:39,829
I'm almost done.

2457
01:51:40,369 --> 01:51:41,470
That was quick.

2458
01:51:41,770 --> 01:51:43,369
He's very quick.

2459
01:51:43,899 --> 01:51:47,209
He also danced to the title song after a short time.

2460
01:51:47,210 --> 01:51:50,078
So if you're ready

2461
01:51:50,079 --> 01:51:51,340
(PARK JUNSEO, a choreography copy machine)

2462
01:51:52,140 --> 01:51:53,179
Shall we move on?

2463
01:51:53,180 --> 01:51:54,180
- Okay. - Okay.

2464
01:51:54,210 --> 01:51:55,380
Slide.

2465
01:51:55,880 --> 01:51:59,180
The sliding direction can change from right to left.

2466
01:51:59,750 --> 01:52:00,750
(Glancing)

2467
01:52:01,989 --> 01:52:03,020
(Glancing)

2468
01:52:06,890 --> 01:52:08,288
- Question? - No.

2469
01:52:08,289 --> 01:52:09,430
No? It's okay?

2470
01:52:10,130 --> 01:52:13,770
(Chinese)

2471
01:52:13,829 --> 01:52:15,599
(Thai)

2472
01:52:15,600 --> 01:52:17,600
(Japanese)

2473
01:52:18,300 --> 01:52:21,069
Do it as powerfully as you can. Don't do it like this now.

2474
01:52:21,409 --> 01:52:22,469
- Okay. - Okay.

2475
01:52:22,470 --> 01:52:24,210
(Please translate.)

2476
01:52:25,079 --> 01:52:27,510
(Translating in Chinese)

2477
01:52:28,550 --> 01:52:31,449
(Translating in Japanese)

2478
01:52:35,090 --> 01:52:37,420
(Then follows the next translation.)

2479
01:52:37,659 --> 01:52:38,989
We...

2480
01:52:40,560 --> 01:52:42,089
We...

2481
01:52:42,090 --> 01:52:45,398
Communication was difficult as there were many foreign trainees.

2482
01:52:45,399 --> 01:52:49,469
The choreography wasn't the biggest problem.

2483
01:52:49,470 --> 01:52:52,238
It was communication.

2484
01:52:52,239 --> 01:52:54,939
The beat keeps changing because we're not doing it properly.

2485
01:52:55,239 --> 01:52:58,038
It will get very delayed if we do it like this.

2486
01:52:58,039 --> 01:52:59,039
Let's do it properly.

2487
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:00,148
- Okay. - Okay.

2488
01:53:00,149 --> 01:53:02,249
It will get very delayed. Let's do it properly.

2489
01:53:02,250 --> 01:53:03,279
- Okay. - Okay.

2490
01:53:03,479 --> 01:53:07,519
I think we seem to be in low spirits...

2491
01:53:07,520 --> 01:53:10,219
when the leader is talking because no one replies.

2492
01:53:10,220 --> 01:53:11,889
Shall we reply more energetically?

2493
01:53:11,890 --> 01:53:12,988
- Okay! - Okay!

2494
01:53:12,989 --> 01:53:14,228
Thank you.

2495
01:53:14,229 --> 01:53:16,389
Our practising flow is slow.

2496
01:53:16,390 --> 01:53:18,129
I think it's difficult to practice...

2497
01:53:18,130 --> 01:53:20,470
because the energy level is low.

2498
01:53:21,500 --> 01:53:23,000
I don't know about this team.

2499
01:53:24,670 --> 01:53:29,539
(Will they be able to solve the communication problem?)

2500
01:53:30,180 --> 01:53:32,380
(How is it going in the rap position team?)

2501
01:53:33,510 --> 01:53:34,809
Here...

2502
01:53:34,810 --> 01:53:37,250
(They're making the rap in the practice room.)

2503
01:53:38,449 --> 01:53:39,449
Shall we laugh first?

2504
01:53:39,450 --> 01:53:41,250
(They first make laughter!)

2505
01:53:41,449 --> 01:53:42,619
First of all,

2506
01:53:43,420 --> 01:53:44,420
this is the only song I could see.

2507
01:53:45,119 --> 01:53:47,130
I wanted to be on this team no matter what.

2508
01:53:47,390 --> 01:53:49,930
I really wanted to be on this team too.

2509
01:53:50,130 --> 01:53:52,500
I'm glad that I could come here.

2510
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:56,229
When the songs were announced, there was "MOMMAE,"

2511
01:53:56,399 --> 01:53:58,539
and there was "SHALALA."

2512
01:53:58,770 --> 01:54:02,170
Seven people went to Team "WORK."

2513
01:54:02,909 --> 01:54:04,039
I was shocked about that.

2514
01:54:05,109 --> 01:54:10,850
(A rap battle began to eliminate some people.)

2515
01:54:12,619 --> 01:54:15,449
I was shocked because they were all good.

2516
01:54:18,020 --> 01:54:20,560
I was very shocked because YECHAN was really good.

2517
01:54:20,989 --> 01:54:23,029
I'm not lying.

2518
01:54:23,430 --> 01:54:26,399
I wrote about 1,000 songs.

2519
01:54:26,699 --> 01:54:28,328
I didn't write 1,000 songs,

2520
01:54:28,329 --> 01:54:29,729
but I've been writing songs for three years.

2521
01:54:29,970 --> 01:54:32,300
The lyrics I wrote...

2522
01:54:32,439 --> 01:54:34,539
went on my album as well.

2523
01:54:34,869 --> 01:54:36,538
I was confident too,

2524
01:54:36,539 --> 01:54:38,579
so I wasn't that worried.

2525
01:54:39,079 --> 01:54:40,209
Let's go.

2526
01:54:40,210 --> 01:54:41,310
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2527
01:54:41,810 --> 01:54:43,920
- I think it turned out well. - I have a good feeling.

2528
01:54:44,680 --> 01:54:47,590
Shall we do our best then?

2529
01:54:48,420 --> 01:54:50,890
(They chose JEON MINWOOK as their leader.)

2530
01:54:51,420 --> 01:54:53,759
- I'll do my best. - JEONGMIN is the main rapper.

2531
01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:54,760
(They quickly choose the main rapper as well.)

2532
01:54:54,761 --> 01:54:57,760
We're done distributing the parts.

2533
01:54:58,130 --> 01:54:59,698
Stand in the formation.

2534
01:54:59,699 --> 01:55:00,930
The first formation.

2535
01:55:01,170 --> 01:55:03,739
Five, six, seven, eight.

2536
01:55:04,100 --> 01:55:07,840
(They quickly make the formation too.)

2537
01:55:08,939 --> 01:55:11,738
We have to decide the leader.

2538
01:55:11,739 --> 01:55:13,380
- Right. - Yes.

2539
01:55:13,539 --> 01:55:16,949
In my opinion, a leader...

2540
01:55:17,550 --> 01:55:19,720
isn't someone with the skills,

2541
01:55:20,079 --> 01:55:22,719
but someone who can direct others.

2542
01:55:22,720 --> 01:55:25,318
- Direct others. - That's most important.

2543
01:55:25,319 --> 01:55:26,789
I think so too.

2544
01:55:26,989 --> 01:55:29,559
- So... - I'll vote for him as well.

2545
01:55:29,560 --> 01:55:31,328
- Me too. - Okay.

2546
01:55:31,329 --> 01:55:33,229
YUSEI as well? Do we all agree?

2547
01:55:33,899 --> 01:55:36,369
If HEEDO is in our team,

2548
01:55:36,430 --> 01:55:39,739
I think it would be best to have HEEDO lead us.

2549
01:55:40,170 --> 01:55:41,340
YUSEI.

2550
01:55:41,970 --> 01:55:44,038
Then, with everyone's consent, HEEDO will be the leader.

2551
01:55:44,039 --> 01:55:45,310
Nice.

2552
01:55:46,810 --> 01:55:48,380
- Okay. - That was quick.

2553
01:55:48,479 --> 01:55:50,079
- Our leader. - It was quick.

2554
01:55:50,449 --> 01:55:52,778
HEEDO...

2555
01:55:52,779 --> 01:55:56,590
was the leader of P2.

2556
01:55:56,789 --> 01:56:00,560
So I thought he could manage it.

2557
01:56:00,930 --> 01:56:03,260
He may have placed last,

2558
01:56:03,590 --> 01:56:05,060
he has experience.

2559
01:56:05,930 --> 01:56:09,029
We could trust his experience and follow him.

2560
01:56:09,869 --> 01:56:10,898
I know how to wear it...

2561
01:56:10,899 --> 01:56:12,970
- because I've worn it before. - Of course.

2562
01:56:13,170 --> 01:56:14,408
Good.

2563
01:56:14,409 --> 01:56:17,710
I became the leader by consensus.

2564
01:56:18,340 --> 01:56:20,039
I thought I should work hard again...

2565
01:56:20,510 --> 01:56:22,979
with responsibility.

2566
01:56:23,979 --> 01:56:26,318
Shall we listen to the song first?

2567
01:56:26,319 --> 01:56:27,449
(They play the song before distributing the parts.)

2568
01:56:29,550 --> 01:56:31,289
(Amazed)

2569
01:56:32,619 --> 01:56:35,189
("Crayon" begins with a strong impact.)

2570
01:56:35,659 --> 01:56:37,060
Get your crayon

2571
01:56:37,300 --> 01:56:39,600
It's an addicting song. Everyone would sing along.

2572
01:56:40,260 --> 01:56:43,099
I thought we...

2573
01:56:43,100 --> 01:56:44,399
would be able to do well.

2574
01:56:44,699 --> 01:56:46,539
It's time to show everyone.

2575
01:56:47,109 --> 01:56:49,939
I received an S rank in rapping.

2576
01:56:50,439 --> 01:56:52,539
I'm sure I won't lose in rapping.

2577
01:56:53,510 --> 01:56:56,380
(Team "Crayon" has many experienced rappers.)

2578
01:56:56,680 --> 01:56:57,949
The song is great enough.

2579
01:56:58,920 --> 01:57:00,619
How we make it is important.

2580
01:57:02,090 --> 01:57:03,989
If you're okay with it,

2581
01:57:04,420 --> 01:57:06,689
why doesn't HEEDO preside...

2582
01:57:06,760 --> 01:57:08,889
- and we give opinions? - Okay.

2583
01:57:08,890 --> 01:57:10,559
It's quicker if one person...

2584
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:12,899
leads the process.

2585
01:57:13,300 --> 01:57:15,399
Too many cooks spoil the broth.

2586
01:57:16,229 --> 01:57:19,569
I thought one person should take the leadership.

2587
01:57:21,109 --> 01:57:23,170
I agree with everything.

2588
01:57:23,539 --> 01:57:26,079
HEEDO can lead,

2589
01:57:26,680 --> 01:57:31,420
but there may be parts that we don't like so much.

2590
01:57:31,680 --> 01:57:33,219
I want us to feel free...

2591
01:57:33,220 --> 01:57:34,949
to talk about them.

2592
01:57:35,350 --> 01:57:38,890
If I hear an opinion...

2593
01:57:39,520 --> 01:57:43,329
and I'm certain that it's not a great one,

2594
01:57:44,829 --> 01:57:48,869
I want us to move on from it.

2595
01:57:49,800 --> 01:57:51,300
But I'll think twice and thrice...

2596
01:57:51,439 --> 01:57:53,368
before making the decision.

2597
01:57:53,369 --> 01:57:55,039
- Okay. - Good.

2598
01:57:55,909 --> 01:58:00,278
I've been in the rapping position for more than ten years.

2599
01:58:00,279 --> 01:58:02,908
I rapped on stage...

2600
01:58:02,909 --> 01:58:05,948
more than the others.

2601
01:58:05,949 --> 01:58:08,250
I wanted to draw a rough sketch first.

2602
01:58:09,319 --> 01:58:10,618
I should accept it.

2603
01:58:10,619 --> 01:58:14,789
He's a senior who debuted first, and he has experience.

2604
01:58:15,529 --> 01:58:17,899
It's my first time.

2605
01:58:19,460 --> 01:58:20,769
Let's all say "Why so serious?"

2606
01:58:20,770 --> 01:58:23,199
(They divide the parts under his leadership.)

2607
01:58:23,529 --> 01:58:26,770
(They're progressing well.)

2608
01:58:27,340 --> 01:58:29,369
Get your crayon

2609
01:58:29,970 --> 01:58:32,810
(Team "SHALALA")

2610
01:58:34,250 --> 01:58:35,809
(Staring)

2611
01:58:35,810 --> 01:58:37,520
(Staring)

2612
01:58:39,079 --> 01:58:40,520
What is this?

2613
01:58:44,420 --> 01:58:45,420
It's very ambiguous.

2614
01:58:46,890 --> 01:58:48,359
It's so difficult.

2615
01:58:48,989 --> 01:58:50,698
When I came to Team "SHALALA,"

2616
01:58:50,699 --> 01:58:53,500
I thought people who rap would come.

2617
01:58:54,369 --> 01:58:57,770
RYOMA started rapping not so long ago.

2618
01:58:58,170 --> 01:59:01,509
The others also came...

2619
01:59:01,510 --> 01:59:02,908
from other parts.

2620
01:59:02,909 --> 01:59:05,439
(Please come.)

2621
01:59:07,409 --> 01:59:09,408
(SHIN JAEWON and LEE JIHOON...)

2622
01:59:09,409 --> 01:59:14,220
(are appealing to them by singing "Love wins all.")

2623
01:59:15,189 --> 01:59:19,619
(They were removed from the vocal position.)

2624
01:59:20,189 --> 01:59:23,189
(The two vocalists came to the rapping group.)

2625
01:59:23,390 --> 01:59:26,029
(That's how Team "SHALALA" was made.)

2626
01:59:26,760 --> 01:59:28,970
I'm not confident in speaking Korean.

2627
01:59:29,229 --> 01:59:31,170
I'm not good at keeping...

2628
01:59:31,569 --> 01:59:33,069
with the beat.

2629
01:59:33,500 --> 01:59:35,469
So I've never rapped before.

2630
01:59:35,470 --> 01:59:38,710
I did think this would be all or nothing.

2631
01:59:38,810 --> 01:59:41,250
I'm the main rapper.

2632
01:59:41,750 --> 01:59:44,149
I can't say I'm not worried,

2633
01:59:44,279 --> 01:59:46,550
but I'm doing my best.

2634
01:59:47,289 --> 01:59:48,448
This is difficult.

2635
01:59:48,449 --> 01:59:50,789
(They're just lost.)

2636
01:59:52,159 --> 01:59:54,929
You all know how to make raps, right?

2637
01:59:54,930 --> 01:59:59,300
I've done rap-making many times.

2638
01:59:59,460 --> 02:00:01,430
I practised many songs with raps.

2639
02:00:01,630 --> 02:00:03,329
I copied raps so many times.

2640
02:00:04,170 --> 02:00:06,340
- Can I get on with this? - Sure.

2641
02:00:06,670 --> 02:00:08,970
YICHEN can be the main rapper.

2642
02:00:09,270 --> 02:00:12,379
- YICHEN. - Thank you for letting me do that.

2643
02:00:12,380 --> 02:00:13,509
I'll do my best.

2644
02:00:13,510 --> 02:00:15,210
(Main rapper YICHEN)

2645
02:00:15,579 --> 02:00:18,019
I got many lessons from Cheetah...

2646
02:00:18,020 --> 02:00:20,920
on rap-making.

2647
02:00:21,119 --> 02:00:22,289
So, I'm confident.

2648
02:00:22,819 --> 02:00:25,358
I came to the rap position...

2649
02:00:25,359 --> 02:00:26,590
that I'm most confident in.

2650
02:00:26,720 --> 02:00:28,389
I'm ambitious.

2651
02:00:28,390 --> 02:00:30,659
We have to help him.

2652
02:00:31,199 --> 02:00:33,460
I've never made a rap before.

2653
02:00:33,760 --> 02:00:36,228
I haven't made raps that much.

2654
02:00:36,229 --> 02:00:38,398
That isn't a problem.

2655
02:00:38,399 --> 02:00:39,868
- We can help you. - Okay.

2656
02:00:39,869 --> 02:00:41,170
I'll do my best.

2657
02:00:41,439 --> 02:00:42,909
How old are you?

2658
02:00:43,210 --> 02:00:45,438
I'm 18 years old. I was born in 2007.

2659
02:00:45,439 --> 02:00:46,978
- You were born in 2007? - Yes.

2660
02:00:46,979 --> 02:00:48,079
Born in 2007.

2661
02:00:48,479 --> 02:00:49,880
Is he a minor?

2662
02:00:50,210 --> 02:00:51,479
Is SEYUN a minor?

2663
02:00:52,750 --> 02:00:54,819
(He has the spirit of a 2007 born.)

2664
02:00:56,050 --> 02:00:58,560
(He's a playful high school student.)

2665
02:00:59,189 --> 02:01:00,760
(Sighing)

2666
02:01:01,960 --> 02:01:03,529
I think with "MOMMAE,"

2667
02:01:03,760 --> 02:01:06,399
we should express a sexy feeling.

2668
02:01:06,859 --> 02:01:10,430
It wouldn't be nice for SEYUN to do that.

2669
02:01:11,069 --> 02:01:12,100
Will he be able to do it?

2670
02:01:12,770 --> 02:01:13,869
SEYUN?

2671
02:01:14,010 --> 02:01:15,170
This...

2672
02:01:15,609 --> 02:01:18,108
- I don't know where the line is. - Do you think you can do it?

2673
02:01:18,109 --> 02:01:20,239
Yes. I will try.

2674
02:01:20,649 --> 02:01:22,279
How will he write the rap for "MOMMAE?"

2675
02:01:23,710 --> 02:01:26,778
I'm a minor,

2676
02:01:26,779 --> 02:01:28,590
so I can't go with such a feeling.

2677
02:01:28,989 --> 02:01:30,519
I'll show you my dark and sexy side...

2678
02:01:30,520 --> 02:01:33,460
that other people don't know about.

2679
02:01:33,760 --> 02:01:35,890
He wants to show the dark and sexy side of an 18-year-old?

2680
02:01:37,630 --> 02:01:38,829
Okay.

2681
02:01:39,560 --> 02:01:43,568
(They make a rap for the first time.)

2682
02:01:43,569 --> 02:01:46,698
I have a memory of writing poems many times...

2683
02:01:46,699 --> 02:01:48,739
for the yearly newspaper when I was in elementary school.

2684
02:01:48,810 --> 02:01:50,909
I thought I should write a good rap...

2685
02:01:51,010 --> 02:01:53,239
using my writing skills from then.

2686
02:01:53,609 --> 02:01:56,750
(The dark and sexy charm of a minor?)

2687
02:01:57,350 --> 02:01:58,479
I can do it.

2689
02:02:03,289 --> 02:02:05,158

the votes of World Assemblers...

2726
02:04:43,510 --> 02:04:44,919

is an evaluation that allows you to know the trainees' skills...

02:05:01,630 --> 02:05:04,368
that you will need to know...

2733
02:05:04,369 --> 02:05:06,600
when you assemble them.

2734
02:05:10,210 --> 02:05:11,680
For Position Matching,

2735
02:05:12,239 --> 02:05:13,579
we'll have performances of four vocal songs,

2736
02:05:16,050 --> 02:05:17,310
four rap songs,

2737
02:05:19,350 --> 02:05:20,379
and four dance songs.

2738
02:05:20,380 --> 02:05:23,520
We have a total of 12 performances prepared.

2739
02:05:24,220 --> 02:05:28,228

02:05:31,659 --> 02:05:34,770

02:05:42,770 --> 02:05:45,078
in vocal, rap, and dance positions,

2745
02:05:45,079 --> 02:05:47,478
will be given 20,000 points.

02:05:49,850 --> 02:05:50,919
Twenty thousand points.

2748
02:05:50,920 --> 02:05:53,719
The MVP trainee will be given 100,000 points.

2749

The final rankings of the trainees...

2753
02:06:00,260 --> 02:06:03,590
will be decided by summing the on-site and online votes.

2754
02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:06,028
Online votes are carried out...

2812
02:08:49,390 --> 02:08:51,399
- so we can get some feedback. - Right.

2813
02:08:51,829 --> 02:08:53,198
Shall we start writing the verse?

2814
02:08:53,199 --> 02:08:54,429
- Sure. - Sounds good.

2815
02:08:54,430 --> 02:08:55,470
(Time to write the lyrics)

2816
02:08:55,729 --> 02:08:59,369
In my opinion,

2817
02:09:00,140 --> 02:09:02,539
I feel like we should write it...

2818
02:09:02,770 --> 02:09:05,640
as if we're villains saying we're the best.

2819
02:09:06,039 --> 02:09:08,849
I hope there won't be any hesitation from us.

2820
02:09:08,850 --> 02:09:11,750
Let's try the villain concept this time.

2821
02:09:11,880 --> 02:09:13,350
- What concept do you have in mind? - The villain.

2822
02:09:13,819 --> 02:09:16,819
The goal of our team is to say that we're the best...

2823
02:09:17,050 --> 02:09:19,619
and criticize the other teams for doing a bad job.

2824
02:09:20,020 --> 02:09:22,028
We wrote lyrics that could provoke...

2825
02:09:22,029 --> 02:09:24,800
the other teams once they hear our song.

2826
02:09:26,359 --> 02:09:28,130
I think I'll write lines saying how cool I am.

2827
02:09:28,430 --> 02:09:30,300
Rap is supposed to be cool anyway.

2828
02:09:30,369 --> 02:09:32,099
I'd like to hear your rap.

2829
02:09:32,100 --> 02:09:33,238
Can you try it out?

2830
02:09:33,239 --> 02:09:34,470
- Yes. - Yes.

2831
02:09:35,210 --> 02:09:37,409
(Special Director Moonbyul)

2832
02:09:38,979 --> 02:09:40,739
(Stuttering)

2833
02:09:40,909 --> 02:09:42,050
We did it!

2834
02:09:42,350 --> 02:09:43,380
I...

2835
02:09:48,590 --> 02:09:50,319
(Stuttering again)

2836
02:09:50,590 --> 02:09:52,459
- What? - Okay, now.

2837
02:09:52,460 --> 02:09:54,288
- Swag? - Check!

2838
02:09:54,289 --> 02:09:55,858
I'm from the bottom, I'm different

2839
02:09:55,859 --> 02:09:57,859
Everyone calls themselves a rapper but I think otherwise

2840
02:09:57,930 --> 02:10:00,259
I beat all your idols, I'm different from them

2841
02:10:00,260 --> 02:10:02,169
- Head, shoulder, knees, and toes - Head, shoulder, knees, and toes

2842
02:10:02,170 --> 02:10:03,229
- Swag - Swag

2843
02:10:13,979 --> 02:10:16,509
HEEDO, what was the Japanese intro...

2844
02:10:16,510 --> 02:10:18,279
- you did earlier? - Well...

2845
02:10:18,520 --> 02:10:21,289
YUSEI and I prepared a short exchange.

2846
02:10:21,590 --> 02:10:24,590
I wasn't able to show you what we practised.

2847
02:10:25,760 --> 02:10:27,459
You seem confident,

2848
02:10:27,460 --> 02:10:29,890
but this is just a dry rehearsal.

2849
02:10:30,260 --> 02:10:32,729
This is just a dry rehearsal.

2850
02:10:32,899 --> 02:10:34,869
I think I said I wanted you guys to do it like it's the actual stage.

2851
02:10:35,869 --> 02:10:37,000
Do you want to be at the bottom again?

2852
02:10:37,500 --> 02:10:38,539
No, sir.

2853
02:10:40,840 --> 02:10:43,340
There are so many lines here that sound provocative.

2854
02:10:43,439 --> 02:10:45,909
You said "good-for-nothing" rappers. Are they good for nothing?

2855
02:10:45,979 --> 02:10:47,180
They're not.

2856
02:10:47,239 --> 02:10:49,409
This isn't "Show Me the Money."

2857
02:10:51,220 --> 02:10:54,419
The leader should correct these.

2858
02:10:54,420 --> 02:10:56,688
How many times have I told you that a leader isn't the one...

2859
02:10:56,689 --> 02:10:59,090
leading the group but the one supporting from behind?

2860
02:10:59,760 --> 02:11:01,389
When I look at you guys,

2861
02:11:01,390 --> 02:11:03,229
you're only acting like you're cool.

2862
02:11:03,590 --> 02:11:05,300
I'll tell you when I noticed that.

2863
02:11:05,430 --> 02:11:06,729
While writing your lyrics,

2864
02:11:07,159 --> 02:11:10,369
you tried too hard to sound cool with too many words.

2865
02:11:10,569 --> 02:11:12,970
I don't think it's always a good idea to rap fast.

2866
02:11:13,300 --> 02:11:14,710
You're only pretending to be cool.

2867
02:11:14,909 --> 02:11:16,970
Then this will become meaningless.

2868
02:11:17,270 --> 02:11:21,479
You should improve from your previous experience.

2869
02:11:22,050 --> 02:11:24,510
This could turn out great if you do this right.

2870
02:11:25,319 --> 02:11:27,949
I felt like our efforts were in vain.

2871
02:11:28,890 --> 02:11:31,560
I think it'll be better...

2872
02:11:32,020 --> 02:11:34,090
if we can get back on track as soon as we can.

2873
02:11:35,329 --> 02:11:38,500
(Their evaluation ended with harsh criticism.)

2874
02:11:39,930 --> 02:11:43,600
(They're back on rewriting their song.)

2875
02:11:43,729 --> 02:11:44,770
Move your head.

2876
02:11:46,500 --> 02:11:47,939
TAEYU, I'm sorry, but I'll have to cut your part.

2877
02:11:48,340 --> 02:11:51,069
I feel like we're a bit disorganized.

2878
02:11:52,479 --> 02:11:55,449
If only I could contribute...

2879
02:11:55,649 --> 02:11:57,350
to our team winning first place,

2880
02:11:58,420 --> 02:12:01,689
then I thought I should take the lead.

2881
02:12:02,720 --> 02:12:05,459
Okay. Let's decide again on who's going to do this part.

2882
02:12:05,460 --> 02:12:06,520
Okay.

2883
02:12:07,319 --> 02:12:09,029
Here's what I think.

2884
02:12:09,359 --> 02:12:11,130
TAEYU is doing 14 beats.

2885
02:12:11,430 --> 02:12:12,599
You're doing ten beats,

2886
02:12:12,600 --> 02:12:13,960
we're both doing eight beats each,

2887
02:12:14,359 --> 02:12:15,829
and you're doing four beats.

2888
02:12:16,399 --> 02:12:17,929
This is quite a big difference,

2889
02:12:17,930 --> 02:12:20,770
so I think we should distribute this evenly.

2890
02:12:20,869 --> 02:12:22,769
Everybody will have his own part.

2891
02:12:22,770 --> 02:12:25,379
We're going to do double-tracking for our performance anyway.

2892
02:12:25,380 --> 02:12:28,309
But since GUNWOO has the least experience on stage...

2893
02:12:28,310 --> 02:12:29,810
among all of us here...

2894
02:12:30,180 --> 02:12:31,679
(The least experienced)

2895
02:12:31,680 --> 02:12:33,618
That's probably why you're focusing...

2896
02:12:33,619 --> 02:12:36,049
on how the parts are distributed right now.

2897
02:12:36,050 --> 02:12:37,489
You don't need to mind that.

2898
02:12:38,020 --> 02:12:39,189
But...

2899
02:12:39,390 --> 02:12:42,188
we haven't decided on the intro yet, have we?

2900
02:12:42,189 --> 02:12:44,629
- Right. - Was this part of the plan?

2901
02:12:44,630 --> 02:12:46,130
(LEE GUNWOO wants a guaranteed decision.)

2902
02:12:47,229 --> 02:12:50,429
Let's decide on that after some practice.

2903
02:12:50,430 --> 02:12:51,470
Okay.

2904
02:12:51,500 --> 02:12:54,100
Honestly, GUNWOO doesn't...

2905
02:12:54,539 --> 02:12:56,809
have an experience as a trainee either.

2906
02:12:56,810 --> 02:12:58,438
- Right. - I think...

2907
02:12:58,439 --> 02:13:01,608
that's why all these planning and procedures...

2908
02:13:01,609 --> 02:13:05,078
even up to the actual performance...

2909
02:13:05,079 --> 02:13:06,579
could seem a bit unfamiliar to you.

2910
02:13:06,779 --> 02:13:08,250
I gave some suggestions,

2911
02:13:08,720 --> 02:13:10,219
but they were rejected...

2912
02:13:10,220 --> 02:13:12,619
because I had no experience.

2913
02:13:12,859 --> 02:13:15,760
When he said that I was unfamiliar with these things,

2914
02:13:16,489 --> 02:13:18,659
I thought this wasn't right.

2915
02:13:20,100 --> 02:13:22,769
Guys, for the chorus...

2916
02:13:22,770 --> 02:13:24,398
in the part "Come on, girls,"

2917
02:13:24,399 --> 02:13:26,770
let's try changing it to "Come on, assemblers."

2918
02:13:27,100 --> 02:13:29,140
Are we going to finalize it with "assemblers?"

2919
02:13:29,470 --> 02:13:30,970
Is it fixed?

2920
02:13:31,140 --> 02:13:32,479
I think so.

2921
02:13:34,539 --> 02:13:36,949
(While the other trainees have left the area)

2922
02:13:37,609 --> 02:13:39,720
(Tilting his head)

2923
02:13:40,319 --> 02:13:42,719
Aside from the distribution of the parts,

2924
02:13:42,720 --> 02:13:43,789
Right.

2925
02:13:43,949 --> 02:13:45,859
I think the revised version sounds too old-fashioned.

2926
02:13:46,390 --> 02:13:49,059
The word "assembler" doesn't sound right.

2927
02:13:49,060 --> 02:13:50,359
(LEE GUNWOO didn't like the new version.)

2928
02:13:50,460 --> 02:13:53,429
I don't quite trust HEEDO yet...

2929
02:13:53,430 --> 02:13:55,729
when it comes to planning the performance.

2930
02:13:56,199 --> 02:13:58,299
(Earlier during practice)

2931
02:13:58,300 --> 02:13:59,840
- It sounds great. - You think so?

2932
02:14:00,170 --> 02:14:02,438
(Amazed)

2933
02:14:02,439 --> 02:14:03,510
Incredible.

2934
02:14:03,810 --> 02:14:05,739
He's our leader.

2935
02:14:05,939 --> 02:14:08,039
I didn't have any choice...

2936
02:14:08,550 --> 02:14:11,850
because everyone seemed to trust him except for me.

2937
02:14:12,550 --> 02:14:14,550
- I like it. - You think so?

2938
02:14:15,590 --> 02:14:17,789
When I think about HEEDO,

2939
02:14:18,050 --> 02:14:19,989
he was the leader of P2...

2940
02:14:20,159 --> 02:14:21,529
but the bottom-ranking team.

2941
02:14:21,989 --> 02:14:25,899
He also got kicked out from Team "WORK."

2942
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:27,299
Not only that, he was in C Rank.

2943
02:14:27,300 --> 02:14:31,300
With these reasons, I just couldn't trust him.

2944
02:14:33,569 --> 02:14:35,039
I'm going to say...

2945
02:14:35,369 --> 02:14:36,438
my concerns...

2946
02:14:36,439 --> 02:14:37,609
(They finally head to the Room of Truth.)

2947
02:14:37,670 --> 02:14:38,810
and all my complaints here.

2948
02:14:40,079 --> 02:14:43,850
I didn't expect that leading a team...

2949
02:14:43,949 --> 02:14:45,479
meant doing it this way.

2950
02:14:46,279 --> 02:14:48,689
When we chose you as the leader of P3,

2951
02:14:49,449 --> 02:14:51,390
we weren't expecting a dictatorship.

2952
02:14:51,960 --> 02:14:56,659
The leader we thought of was someone who had the authority...

2953
02:14:56,960 --> 02:14:59,229
but not someone who made all the decisions,

2954
02:14:59,399 --> 02:15:00,930
- especially in our team. - Right.

2955
02:15:01,869 --> 02:15:03,130
He doubted me.

2956
02:15:03,369 --> 02:15:05,970
He doubted my credibility as a leader.

2957
02:15:06,970 --> 02:15:10,609
I felt like I failed to show my ability as a leader...

2958
02:15:10,970 --> 02:15:14,710
and failed to gain his trust.

2959
02:15:15,079 --> 02:15:17,108
I thought that GUNWOO...

2960
02:15:17,109 --> 02:15:18,619
didn't have much experience.

2961
02:15:19,020 --> 02:15:20,920
In that case,

2962
02:15:21,550 --> 02:15:24,319
there's a high possibility you'd face more difficulties.

2963
02:15:24,789 --> 02:15:27,859
How many do you think I've seen who have been trainees...

2964
02:15:30,390 --> 02:15:31,959
for a short period or those who haven't even made their debut?

2965
02:15:31,960 --> 02:15:33,000
Well,

2966
02:15:33,159 --> 02:15:34,399
to be honest,

2967
02:15:34,930 --> 02:15:37,100
I think I was doubtful of your ability as a leader.

2968
02:15:37,729 --> 02:15:39,970
(Putting their unresolved conflict behind)

2969
02:15:41,140 --> 02:15:42,538
Looks? Check!

2970
02:15:42,539 --> 02:15:43,970
(A surprise visit from the directors)

2971
02:15:44,770 --> 02:15:49,010
(Starting the final interim check)

2972
02:15:52,079 --> 02:15:53,179
GUNWOO.

2973
02:15:53,180 --> 02:15:55,419
Whenever I looked at him, I couldn't help but smile.

2974
02:15:55,420 --> 02:15:56,920
I really liked it.

2975
02:15:57,020 --> 02:15:59,260
- He's charming. - He makes people smile.

2976
02:15:59,420 --> 02:16:01,889
I realized GUNWOO's strengths.

2977
02:16:01,890 --> 02:16:05,028
His playful attitude...

2978
02:16:05,029 --> 02:16:07,358
was very attractive.

2979
02:16:07,359 --> 02:16:10,229
I think he wrote the most charming lyrics.

2980
02:16:10,430 --> 02:16:12,300
It's true that I don't have much experience,

2981
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:14,770
and I had uncertainties about my own talent.

2982
02:16:15,039 --> 02:16:17,538
But I think we have a chance.

2983
02:16:17,539 --> 02:16:18,879
We all have to do our very best.

2984
02:16:18,880 --> 02:16:20,279
(His confidence level is up.)

2985
02:16:20,640 --> 02:16:23,908
There's a real reason why we visited...

2986
02:16:23,909 --> 02:16:25,550
the Project Village.

2987
02:16:27,050 --> 02:16:29,850
From now on,

2988
02:16:30,050 --> 02:16:32,790
you're going to vote within your team...

2989
02:16:33,389 --> 02:16:35,329
and select your center member.

2990
02:16:36,590 --> 02:16:38,500
Select your center member.

2991
02:16:40,329 --> 02:16:42,799
The center member for the rap position...

2992
02:16:42,969 --> 02:16:44,700
will be able to steal the word count...

2993
02:16:44,969 --> 02:16:47,500
of the other members.

2994
02:16:48,540 --> 02:16:50,408
I think that kind of shocked me.

2995
02:16:50,409 --> 02:16:53,179
We had just decided on the final outline...

2996
02:16:53,180 --> 02:16:55,680
of our overall performance today.

2997
02:16:56,049 --> 02:16:59,120
I felt like they intended for us to fight.

2998
02:16:59,950 --> 02:17:02,549
This is something I'd like to tell everyone here.

2999
02:17:02,790 --> 02:17:05,659
Each of us has a specific role.

3000
02:17:05,790 --> 02:17:09,760
Each of those roles contributed to our "Crayon" stage as a whole.

3001
02:17:10,629 --> 02:17:13,228
Let's not be disappointed even if we don't become the center member.

3002
02:17:13,229 --> 02:17:14,399
- Okay. - Okay.

3003
02:17:14,500 --> 02:17:16,600
Go ahead and decide...

3004
02:17:17,069 --> 02:17:20,270
who has the best attitude for our performance...

3005
02:17:20,540 --> 02:17:22,408
in "Crayon."

3006
02:17:22,409 --> 02:17:23,568
(Voting for the center member of Team "Crayon")

3007
02:17:23,569 --> 02:17:24,639
(Thinking hard)

3008
02:17:25,309 --> 02:17:27,308
(Sighing)

3009
02:17:27,309 --> 02:17:28,979
I can't pick one!

3010
02:17:29,979 --> 02:17:31,780
The center member of Team "Crayon..."

3011
02:17:32,750 --> 02:17:34,078
has been chosen to be me.

3012
02:17:34,079 --> 02:17:35,349
(Trainee LEE GUNWOO)

3013
02:17:35,350 --> 02:17:36,790
That's right.

3014
02:17:38,860 --> 02:17:41,420
I vote LEE GUNWOO...

3015
02:17:41,690 --> 02:17:44,360
as the center member of Team Oh Is That So.

3016
02:17:44,930 --> 02:17:47,929
I think GUNWOO will do a good job in expressing the concept...

3017
02:17:47,930 --> 02:17:51,069
with his passion and young spirit as our youngest member.

3018
02:17:51,370 --> 02:17:54,199
I think GUNWOO feels like he has a lot to show on stage,

3019
02:17:54,200 --> 02:17:57,909
so in order to display his full potential,

3020
02:17:57,969 --> 02:17:59,840
I hope he can get some more word count.

3021
02:18:00,940 --> 02:18:02,950
He's the most talented on our team.

3022
02:18:03,750 --> 02:18:05,149
I believe...

3023
02:18:05,420 --> 02:18:08,048
my teammates chose me only with our performance in mind...

3024
02:18:08,049 --> 02:18:09,350
instead of considering my personal talent.

3025
02:18:10,219 --> 02:18:11,250
Great.

3026
02:18:13,819 --> 02:18:16,559
I hope we can get a good result without any mistakes.

3027
02:18:25,770 --> 02:18:26,899
Let's go.

3028
02:18:32,139 --> 02:18:35,209
("Crayon" by Team Oh Is That So)

3029
02:18:52,260 --> 02:18:56,628
(Choose me among the 100, Don't you still know who I am?)

3030
02:18:56,629 --> 02:18:59,540
(With fizz in a Coke that is yet to be opened)

3031
02:19:01,399 --> 02:19:03,669
(A vibe you can't imitate)

3032
02:19:03,670 --> 02:19:05,408
(From head to toe)

3033
02:19:05,409 --> 02:19:06,939
(A cool friend)

3034
02:19:06,940 --> 02:19:08,648
(Throw the average guys like judo)

3035
02:19:08,649 --> 02:19:10,449
(I ignore Confucianism because I'm rebellious)

3036
02:19:10,450 --> 02:19:12,218
(Confidence with hip-hop)

3037
02:19:12,219 --> 02:19:13,919
(Make them nervous to silence them)

3038
02:19:13,920 --> 02:19:15,789
(I've played half of my life so I play with the stage)

3039
02:19:15,790 --> 02:19:17,619
(My skills are amazing so my eyes are half crazy)

3040
02:19:17,620 --> 02:19:19,388
(I can't go back to my old life, It's too spicy)

3041
02:19:19,389 --> 02:19:22,360
(I don't have regrets, I'm holding onto this chance)

3042
02:19:39,739 --> 02:19:40,879
Look at his face.

3043
02:19:48,920 --> 02:19:50,889
(SEYUN)

3044
02:19:53,920 --> 02:19:54,920
Let's go!

3045
02:19:58,190 --> 02:20:00,100
I feel like I'm watching a concert.

3046
02:20:01,229 --> 02:20:03,769
(Okay, I wear something cool while I'm checking myself out)

3047
02:20:03,770 --> 02:20:05,599
(Look at the camera and take a pose)

3048
02:20:05,600 --> 02:20:09,169
(I didn't dress up but I'm already on your feed)

3049
02:20:09,170 --> 02:20:11,009
(Move aside, It's time for us to show you)

3050
02:20:11,010 --> 02:20:12,808
(You can look forward to the difference in our level)

3051
02:20:12,809 --> 02:20:14,609
(Work on your fancy body)

3052
02:20:14,610 --> 02:20:16,378
(It's cute how you work so hard)

3053
02:20:16,379 --> 02:20:18,208
(Boom, pop it)

3054
02:20:18,209 --> 02:20:19,919
(They stop talking when I appear)

3055
02:20:19,920 --> 02:20:21,949
(Did you see that? Our existence is our charm)

3056
02:20:21,950 --> 02:20:23,818
(You guys move busily)

3057
02:20:23,819 --> 02:20:27,458
(We're getting crooked tonight)

3058
02:20:27,459 --> 02:20:31,158
(Who do you think you are?)

3059
02:20:31,159 --> 02:20:32,759
(My charm overflows whenever I'm on stage)

3060
02:20:32,760 --> 02:20:33,958
(I win everything in the end)

3061
02:20:33,959 --> 02:20:34,959
(I'm better)

3062
02:20:34,960 --> 02:20:36,030
Let's go.

3063
02:20:36,329 --> 02:20:38,499
(I take over all the cameras, Wake up from your dream)

3064
02:20:38,500 --> 02:20:40,398
(I hit my tongue like an instrument)

3065
02:20:40,399 --> 02:20:42,169
(My rap is like an AK)

3066
02:20:42,170 --> 02:20:43,939
(Showing you the difference of our levels)

3067
02:20:43,940 --> 02:20:45,509
(I'm the famous spot for rap and I'm killing it)

3068
02:20:45,510 --> 02:20:47,408
(This name tag is now useless, My steps are filled with confidence)

3069
02:20:47,409 --> 02:20:49,548
(Clap when you're ready, Your play isn't worth watching)

3070
02:20:49,549 --> 02:20:51,978
(Come and set your boring rap, They say mayday)

3071
02:20:51,979 --> 02:20:53,850
(I'm a pandemic in your eyes)

3072
02:21:16,139 --> 02:21:17,610
This is a concert.

3073
02:21:24,950 --> 02:21:29,090

(Check out the full performance on the PROJECT 7's YouTube channel.)

3080
02:21:48,139 --> 02:21:49,409
(Fancams and the center's videos will be released after Episode 4.)

3081
02:21:53,139 --> 02:21:55,680
Incredible!

3082
02:21:56,610 --> 02:21:57,780
My gosh.

3083
02:21:57,879 --> 02:21:59,349
They're so good!

3084
02:21:59,350 --> 02:22:00,519
They're done.

3085
02:22:00,520 --> 02:22:02,850
Whoever doubted TAEYU's talent to be on S rank, reveal yourself.

3086
02:22:03,250 --> 02:22:04,789
- This is what rap is. - Thank you!

3087
02:22:04,790 --> 02:22:05,860
They have proven themselves.

3088
02:22:07,090 --> 02:22:09,159
They have...

3089
02:22:09,389 --> 02:22:11,690
ultimately dominated the stage.

3090
02:22:12,100 --> 02:22:14,899
- All five of them just stood out. - Right?

3091
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:16,100
Oh, is that so?

3092
02:22:17,829 --> 02:22:19,969
(Facing away)

3093
02:22:21,770 --> 02:22:23,269
Please remember...

3094
02:22:23,270 --> 02:22:26,109
Team Oh Is That So's performance for the rap position.

3095
02:22:26,110 --> 02:22:28,110
We'll proceed with the voting...

3096
02:22:28,180 --> 02:22:30,110
after all the rap performances have finished.

3097
02:22:30,379 --> 02:22:32,120
Thank you for your hard work.

3098
02:22:32,750 --> 02:22:33,950
- Thank you. - Thank you.

3099
02:22:34,479 --> 02:22:35,690
Thank you.

3100
02:22:38,319 --> 02:22:40,089
I wish to be more united...

3101
02:22:40,090 --> 02:22:42,530
and practice with a better condition.

3102
02:22:43,190 --> 02:22:45,190
I'd like to tell my teammates that they worked so hard.

3103
02:22:46,059 --> 02:22:47,899
I think we did a great job.

3104
02:22:49,170 --> 02:22:52,370
(What will be the result for Team Oh Is That So?)

3105
02:22:53,069 --> 02:22:55,639
Next is the second performance for the rap position.

3106
02:22:57,270 --> 02:22:59,908
It's Team "MOMMAE" by Jay Park.

3107
02:22:59,909 --> 02:23:01,739
(Team "MOMMAE")

3108
02:23:04,579 --> 02:23:06,250
Are we going to see "MOMMAE" performed by an idol?

3109
02:23:07,379 --> 02:23:11,219
(They're all showing off their dance moves.)

3110
02:23:13,290 --> 02:23:14,919
- Break a leg. - I hope they perform well.

3111
02:23:14,920 --> 02:23:15,959
Good luck.

3112
02:23:17,260 --> 02:23:18,658
Look at them.

3113
02:23:18,659 --> 02:23:20,860
There's definitely a different vibe in a hip-hop team.

3114
02:23:21,129 --> 02:23:22,200
Who's that?

3115
02:23:23,829 --> 02:23:26,238
He's saying hello with an isolation move.

3116
02:23:26,239 --> 02:23:27,540
You're right.

3117
02:23:27,870 --> 02:23:29,809
(Team "MOMMAE" enters the stage.)

3118
02:23:30,270 --> 02:23:31,840
They're good-looking.

3119
02:23:32,209 --> 02:23:33,510
SEYUN is adorable!

3120
02:23:34,340 --> 02:23:35,549
They already look sexy.

3121
02:23:36,049 --> 02:23:37,750
KANG HEEMIN, you're handsome!

3122
02:23:38,680 --> 02:23:40,218
- Shall we start? - Yes.

3123
02:23:40,219 --> 02:23:41,449
In 2, 3. Spank!

3124
02:23:41,450 --> 02:23:43,119
- Spanking! - Spanking!

3125
02:23:43,120 --> 02:23:45,119
- Hello, we are Team Spank! - We are Team Spank.

3126
02:23:45,120 --> 02:23:46,360
(Team Spank)

3127
02:23:47,219 --> 02:23:48,489
They're getting a loud cheer.

3128
02:23:48,790 --> 02:23:50,489
- They'll be performing "MOMMAE." - HYUNJAE, let's get it!

3129
02:23:51,629 --> 02:23:54,699
This song is known as a song for adults.

3130
02:23:54,700 --> 02:23:56,529
JUNG SEYUN.

3131
02:23:56,530 --> 02:23:57,530
Yes?

3132
02:23:57,770 --> 02:23:59,468
I heard you're still a minor.

3133
02:23:59,469 --> 02:24:01,770
Is it okay for you to sing this?

3134
02:24:02,370 --> 02:24:03,770
First of all,

3135
02:24:04,139 --> 02:24:06,808
I am aware that this song is supposed to be sexy.

3136
02:24:06,809 --> 02:24:10,208
The other trainees thought hard about it because I'm a minor.

3137
02:24:10,209 --> 02:24:11,450
(How was their practice?)

3138
02:24:11,709 --> 02:24:13,350
(Practice room for the rap position)

3139
02:24:13,620 --> 02:24:15,850
(Interim check for each position)

3140
02:24:15,989 --> 02:24:18,420
The title of this song is...

3141
02:24:18,620 --> 02:24:20,690
- "MOMMAE." - Yes, it's "MOMMAE."

3142
02:24:21,059 --> 02:24:23,629
How did you decide on the theme?

3143
02:24:23,690 --> 02:24:25,860
The theme of this song is quite obvious,

3144
02:24:25,959 --> 02:24:27,859
so we wanted to try a sexy concept.

3145
02:24:27,860 --> 02:24:29,799
- You're going with sexy? - Yes.

3146
02:24:30,129 --> 02:24:32,270
We'll have to check it out...

3147
02:24:32,840 --> 02:24:35,298
to see whether it's going to be sexy or not.

3148
02:24:35,299 --> 02:24:37,170
- Okay. - Can you perform it for us?

3149
02:24:50,450 --> 02:24:52,158
(JUNG SEYUN's part)

3150
02:24:52,159 --> 02:24:54,818
(My age is 18, I stand out whatever I do)

3151
02:24:54,819 --> 02:24:57,628
(I'm still a minor, but my charm is deadly)

3152
02:24:57,629 --> 02:25:00,129
(I'll show you this moment, so watch me now)

3153
02:25:00,329 --> 02:25:02,469
(They've finished their performance.)

3154
02:25:03,770 --> 02:25:04,969
Are you sure this is supposed to be sexy?

3155
02:25:05,670 --> 02:25:06,840
Are you sure this is supposed to be sexy?

3156
02:25:07,770 --> 02:25:09,208
You sang your chorus...

3157
02:25:09,209 --> 02:25:10,969
in a unique way,

3158
02:25:12,079 --> 02:25:15,610
so I started to wonder if you were aiming for a different kind of sexy.

3159
02:25:15,909 --> 02:25:19,280
I feel like you didn't quite...

3160
02:25:20,120 --> 02:25:25,049
get a full grasp of your concept yet.

3161
02:25:25,319 --> 02:25:26,458
From how I understand it,

3162
02:25:26,459 --> 02:25:29,529
it would've been easier if you wrote about yourselves,

3163
02:25:29,530 --> 02:25:31,689
but I noticed that you wrote...

3164
02:25:31,690 --> 02:25:33,958
some lyrics based on your imagination...

3165
02:25:33,959 --> 02:25:36,229
of how a body would feel like.

3166
02:25:36,600 --> 02:25:39,040
I think it would be better if you wrote lyrics...

3167
02:25:39,239 --> 02:25:41,139
that resonated to you more.

3168
02:25:43,670 --> 02:25:45,109
One important reminder...

3169
02:25:45,110 --> 02:25:46,340
for SEYUN is...

3170
02:25:46,840 --> 02:25:50,450
that it would be better if you showed off your cute side.

3171
02:25:50,879 --> 02:25:53,280
- You... - Something that matches his age.

3172
02:25:53,420 --> 02:25:55,949
There are lyrics and performances...

3173
02:25:55,950 --> 02:25:58,249
that only you can perform at your current age.

3174
02:25:58,250 --> 02:25:59,860
We can't do it even if we want to.

3175
02:26:00,420 --> 02:26:03,030
I think you should show that off.

3176
02:26:03,389 --> 02:26:04,430
I agree.

3177
02:26:04,959 --> 02:26:06,659
It's easy to write lyrics.

3178
02:26:07,399 --> 02:26:09,170
First, start with a rhyme.

3179
02:26:09,329 --> 02:26:10,798
Party rhymes...

3180
02:26:10,799 --> 02:26:12,269
with "a" and "y."

3181
02:26:12,270 --> 02:26:14,339
Then write down words with similar pronunciations.

3182
02:26:14,340 --> 02:26:17,440
(Learning how to create rhymes)

3183
02:26:17,540 --> 02:26:19,239
Hearty.

3184
02:26:19,780 --> 02:26:21,979
- Simple, right? Start with rhymes. - Yes.

3185
02:26:22,649 --> 02:26:23,950
- Isn't it easy? - Yes.

3186
02:26:25,180 --> 02:26:27,120
- It's hard, right? - It's hard.

3187
02:26:28,549 --> 02:26:30,920
Other parts seem relatively easy to write.

3188
02:26:31,989 --> 02:26:34,989
(HYUNJAE joins to write the lyrics together.)

3189
02:26:35,860 --> 02:26:36,860
That's cute.

3190
02:26:36,861 --> 02:26:38,930
(Checking YICHEN's lyrics)

3191
02:26:39,200 --> 02:26:40,329
Sounds good.

3192
02:26:40,799 --> 02:26:42,059
Okay, not bad.

3193
02:26:42,100 --> 02:26:44,399
That was actually good.

3194
02:26:44,799 --> 02:26:47,639
I'm confident that I can put on a better show.

3195
02:26:48,200 --> 02:26:51,909
So I'll do my best together with my members.

3196
02:26:52,739 --> 02:26:54,579
But practising this is fun for me.

3197
02:26:55,379 --> 02:26:57,578
For your lyrics...

3198
02:26:57,579 --> 02:26:58,750
Shall I turn on the lights?

3199
02:26:58,879 --> 02:27:00,679
I don't mind.

3200
02:27:00,680 --> 02:27:02,420
- Are you going to bed? - Yes.

3201
02:27:03,090 --> 02:27:04,549
Don't write it now. Do it tomorrow.

3202
02:27:05,489 --> 02:27:06,860
I'll just write as much as I can.

3203
02:27:07,319 --> 02:27:08,489
That seems best.

3204
02:27:09,959 --> 02:27:12,828
(Traces of his efforts can be seen on his bed.)

3205
02:27:12,829 --> 02:27:15,529
My mom said I was cute and sexy

3206
02:27:15,530 --> 02:27:17,929
(He continued to edit his lyrics until late at night.)

3207
02:27:17,930 --> 02:27:20,569
My mom said I was cute and sexy

3208
02:27:20,639 --> 02:27:23,370
I'll show you my charm, so watch me now

3209
02:27:24,340 --> 02:27:28,510
(Writing and erasing his lines over and over again)

3210
02:27:33,450 --> 02:27:35,690
(It's morning.)

3211
02:27:36,120 --> 02:27:38,250
It's 7am right now.

3212
02:27:38,989 --> 02:27:40,020
Let's go.

3213
02:27:40,920 --> 02:27:43,760
I was able to write 1 line for 3 hours.

3214
02:27:45,530 --> 02:27:49,129
(Going to sleep after his achievement)

3215
02:27:51,729 --> 02:27:52,968
In 2, 3. Spank!

3216
02:27:52,969 --> 02:27:53,969
- Spanking! - Spanking!

3217
02:27:53,970 --> 02:27:55,638
- Hello, we are Team Spank. - We are Team Spank.

3218
02:27:55,639 --> 02:27:56,709
(Rehearsal for the position match)

3219
02:27:58,540 --> 02:28:01,039
(The final check before their actual performance)

3220

I am tenth grader SEYUN, the youngest of Team Spank

3221
02:28:04,049 --> 02:28:06,449
I'm the real baby among the boys

3222
02:28:06,450 --> 02:28:07,548
SEYUN,

3223
02:28:07,549 --> 02:28:10,619
I can't believe it's your first time doing a rap.

3224
02:28:10,620 --> 02:28:13,159
Your lyrics were very witty.

3225
02:28:13,489 --> 02:28:15,388
You've improved so much...

3226
02:28:15,389 --> 02:28:17,959
since the first interim check.

3227
02:28:18,059 --> 02:28:20,530
It would be great if you performed just like you did.

3228
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:22,099
Thank you.

3229
02:28:22,100 --> 02:28:23,700
(Getting recognition as a rapper from being a poem-writing boy)

3230

3231
02:28:28,870 --> 02:28:30,509

3332
02:34:20,760 --> 02:34:24,760
(When he improvised singing, it sounded like pansori.)

3333
02:34:28,030 --> 02:34:31,128
Did you add it for the concept?

3334
02:34:31,129 --> 02:34:33,769
Well, about the lyrics,

3335
02:34:33,770 --> 02:34:36,308
we decided to rewrite the whole lyrics.

3336
02:34:36,309 --> 02:34:38,340
That doesn't mean it has to be like pansori.

3337
02:34:39,170 --> 02:34:41,510
Take that out. It's a no.

3338
02:34:41,780 --> 02:34:44,048
You should do it all over again. Change the whole structure.

3339
02:34:44,049 --> 02:34:46,180
- Okay. - Or this will be a mess.

3340
02:34:46,680 --> 02:34:48,950
And RYOMA.

3341
02:34:49,250 --> 02:34:50,619
You're not dedicated at all.

3342
02:34:50,620 --> 02:34:54,459
You came to Korea to do K-pop, didn't you?

3343
02:34:55,020 --> 02:34:56,058
Right?

3344
02:34:56,059 --> 02:34:57,229
In that case,

3345
02:34:57,760 --> 02:34:59,599
doing this...

3346
02:34:59,600 --> 02:35:01,299
will only waste your time.

3347
02:35:03,069 --> 02:35:04,399
I feel so guilty.

3348
02:35:05,700 --> 02:35:08,440
I kept causing harm to the team, and yet again...

3349
02:35:11,840 --> 02:35:13,378
(Things are already delayed due to the language issue.)

3350
02:35:13,379 --> 02:35:15,639
(He's overwhelmed with a sense of apology.)

3351
02:35:15,780 --> 02:35:20,219
- And SEUNGHO is the lead rapper. - Yes.

3352
02:35:20,719 --> 02:35:24,649
Aside from your mistakes and all,

3353
02:35:25,149 --> 02:35:26,590
I don't get why you're the lead rapper.

3354
02:35:27,360 --> 02:35:31,930
You don't give a heavy impression, nor are you better than the others.

3355
02:35:32,530 --> 02:35:36,700
You need a sense of confidence in general.

3356
02:35:37,870 --> 02:35:39,939
Shalalala Land is the bottom team.

3357
02:35:39,940 --> 02:35:41,469
(They even placed last for the interim check.)

3358
02:35:42,370 --> 02:35:44,638
I knew we were not as good as other teams,

3359
02:35:44,639 --> 02:35:47,709
but it was upsetting to actually face it.

3360
02:35:48,440 --> 02:35:50,850
I forgot some of the lyrics and missed the beat.

3361
02:35:51,280 --> 02:35:54,920
It made me think again about whether to be...

3362
02:35:55,379 --> 02:35:57,090
the lead rapper of this team.

3363
02:36:00,360 --> 02:36:03,360
(Shalalala Land in the practice room after the interim check)

3364
02:36:06,760 --> 02:36:08,430
I feel so troubled.

3365
02:36:11,899 --> 02:36:13,540
I don't know what to do anymore.

3366
02:36:15,299 --> 02:36:18,738
You're in charge of too much right now.

3367
02:36:18,739 --> 02:36:21,610
I'm frustrated and sorry that I can't do much...

3368
02:36:22,079 --> 02:36:23,680
to help you.

3369
02:36:25,979 --> 02:36:30,389
They'd never done any rap-making before.

3370
02:36:31,049 --> 02:36:33,589
It already took me a long time to write just one line.

3371

(While everyone else was asleep, he went over his teammates' lyrics.)

3372
02:36:38,659 --> 02:36:42,600
I was hardly good enough myself,

3373
02:36:42,659 --> 02:36:44,100
and things didn't work out as I wanted.

3374
02:36:44,969 --> 02:36:47,870
It was too overwhelming for me to handle, and I ended up crying.

3375
02:36:55,940 --> 02:37:00,979
(Will they get to complete their performance?)

3376
02:37:02,079 --> 02:37:03,249

3377

- Thank you. - Thank you.

3384
02:37:33,120 --> 02:37:36,789
I can't believe they just stood still without doing anything.

3385
02:37:36,790 --> 02:37:38,450
I think they acted like they were struggling on purpose.

3386
02:37:38,750 --> 02:37:40,520
Did you mess up on purpose last time?

3387
02:37:41,360 --> 02:37:43,929
- I love how they organized it. - What on earth?

3388
02:37:43,930 --> 02:37:46,090
- Thank you. - It wasn't boring to the end.

3389

3392

(SIHUN and HYUNWOO make a surprise visit.)

3398
02:38:06,479 --> 02:38:08,978
We decided to come...

3399
02:38:08,979 --> 02:38:12,859
because we heard you guys were struggling...

3400
02:38:12,860 --> 02:38:14,589
- with the rap-making. - That's right.

3401
02:38:14,590 --> 02:38:17,029
We wondered if we could give help.

3402

That's why we're here.

3405

3409
02:38:30,670 --> 02:38:32,269
prepared some snacks.

It's a secret, you see. We shouldn't get caught.

- Let's have something sweet first. - Here.

3412
02:38:36,110 --> 02:38:37,949
Oh, this is trash. Don't eat it.

3413
02:38:37,950 --> 02:38:39,249

3414
02:38:39,250 --> 02:38:41,119
- Thank you. - We prepared some snacks for you.

3415

Let's eat first. Take one each.

3416
02:38:43,389 --> 02:38:45,119

Why don't you show us how you do it before we get started?

3418

- There are four of you, right? - Yes.

3423
02:39:02,469 --> 02:39:04,940
But it feels like all of you are rapping the same way.

3424
02:39:05,969 --> 02:39:08,940
(All of them rap with similar flows.)

3425
02:39:09,979 --> 02:39:13,479
This may be why it sounds a little boring.

3426
02:39:13,680 --> 02:39:16,519
- Hold on. Be sleazy, you all. - It's too...

3427
02:39:16,520 --> 02:39:18,488
Look. Your song is about how cool you are,

3428
02:39:18,489 --> 02:39:21,158
how shiny you are, and how stylish you are.

3429
02:39:21,159 --> 02:39:24,158

With two tutors from Team "Love me or Leave me,"

3440
02:39:48,149 --> 02:39:51,290
we had this so-called private lesson.

3441
02:39:51,889 --> 02:39:54,120
They helped us in so many ways.

3442
02:39:54,620 --> 02:39:55,760
Dance along!

3443
02:39:56,090 --> 02:39:58,159
Fortunately enough, we got help from them.

3444

We're planning to change the whole thing...

3445
02:40:00,799 --> 02:40:03,629
and write cooler lyrics.

02:43:27,899 --> 02:43:29,939
I felt devastated without knowing what to do...

3504
02:43:29,940 --> 02:43:31,870
to pull off this performance.

3505
02:43:32,110 --> 02:43:34,340
I cried a lot out of frustration.

3506
02:43:34,639 --> 02:43:36,908
I'm not fully satisfied with the performance today,

3507
02:43:36,909 --> 02:43:39,709
but I'll try harder to make better performances.

3508
02:43:39,920 --> 02:43:42,318
- Why? - Why? We loved it.

3509
02:43:42,319 --> 02:43:43,449
He did such a good job.

3510
02:43:43,450 --> 02:43:47,620
He's not satisfied? No way. He did really well.

3511
02:43:48,520 --> 02:43:50,690
We got to present such a nice performance...

3512
02:43:51,059 --> 02:43:53,260
because you guys followed my lead so well.

3513
02:43:54,729 --> 02:43:56,329
Thank you so much.

3514
02:43:57,770 --> 02:44:00,770
Let's aim for first place. We can do this!

3515
02:44:02,770 --> 02:44:05,239
It's time for the last performance of the rap position.

3516
02:44:05,639 --> 02:44:10,010
This team has five young and hip trainees.

3517
02:44:10,950 --> 02:44:12,149
Team "WORK"...

3518
02:44:13,680 --> 02:44:14,819
by ATEEZ.

3519
02:44:15,620 --> 02:44:16,818
("WORK" by ATEEZ, Workers)

3520
02:44:16,819 --> 02:44:18,149
Please come up to the stage.

3521
02:44:19,489 --> 02:44:21,520
- "Workers." - In this team, JUYOUNG...

3522
02:44:21,590 --> 02:44:22,860
This team is strong too.

3523
02:44:23,329 --> 02:44:25,690
This team is like the Avengers.

3524
02:44:29,159 --> 02:44:30,729
Gosh, they're finally up.

3525
02:44:32,229 --> 02:44:35,370
(With the passionate cheer of the World Assemblers,)

3526
02:44:36,739 --> 02:44:39,510
(Team "WORK" enters the stage.)

3527
02:44:39,709 --> 02:44:41,638
(Trainee CHOI JUYOUNG)

3528
02:44:41,639 --> 02:44:43,249
(Trainee JEON MINWOOK)

3529
02:44:43,250 --> 02:44:44,708
(Trainee YEOM YECHAN)

3530
02:44:44,709 --> 02:44:46,548
(Trainee KIM JEONGMIN)

3531
02:44:46,549 --> 02:44:48,379
(Trainee KIM TAESUNG)

3532
02:44:49,780 --> 02:44:51,450
Please say hello.

3533
02:44:51,750 --> 02:44:52,989
In 2, 3.

3534
02:44:53,049 --> 02:44:55,959
- Gotta work! Hello. We're Workers. - Gotta work! Hello.

3535
02:44:59,489 --> 02:45:01,159
They're like actual idols.

3536
02:45:02,930 --> 02:45:06,029
I hear this team is a strong first-place winner candidate.

3537
02:45:06,030 --> 02:45:08,569
Their greeting is so energetic already.

3538
02:45:08,870 --> 02:45:11,908
He's the youngest member who's always bright.

3539
02:45:11,909 --> 02:45:14,079
It's Trainee CHOI JUYOUNG who is 15 years old.

3540
02:45:14,979 --> 02:45:17,148
You're a brave middle schooler who never cries.

3541
02:45:17,149 --> 02:45:20,718
How was it practising with your teammates?

3542
02:45:20,719 --> 02:45:22,520
(How did they prepare for the performance?)

3543
02:45:23,620 --> 02:45:25,850
(Team "WORK" in the practice room)

3544
02:45:26,319 --> 02:45:29,360
(They're moving on quickly.)

3545
02:45:30,090 --> 02:45:32,030
Your under...

3546
02:45:32,129 --> 02:45:35,000
(He's only a rookie trainee who barely finished "RUN.")

3547
02:45:36,030 --> 02:45:39,370
(He's faced with another crisis.)

3548
02:45:39,829 --> 02:45:42,569
We've got to teach JUYOUNG this part.

3549
02:45:42,799 --> 02:45:43,870
Watch.

3550
02:45:43,909 --> 02:45:45,269
One.

3551
02:45:45,270 --> 02:45:51,950
(The older members are up to help JUYOUNG.)

3552
02:45:52,049 --> 02:45:53,950
Five, six, and seven.

3553
02:45:54,219 --> 02:45:55,519
Fast like this. Okay?

3554
02:45:55,520 --> 02:45:56,920
- Can you follow up to here? - Yes.

3555
02:45:57,120 --> 02:45:59,249
Other trainees...

3556
02:45:59,250 --> 02:46:00,860
could pull it off right away,

3557
02:46:00,959 --> 02:46:02,458
but maybe because he was still so young,

3558
02:46:02,459 --> 02:46:05,489
he seemed to lack focus.

3559
02:46:05,930 --> 02:46:11,628
(Time passed with worries.)

3560
02:46:11,629 --> 02:46:13,299
Money make purse

3561
02:46:14,040 --> 02:46:15,699
Go forward.

3562
02:46:15,700 --> 02:46:17,809
(Team "WORK" is coming to the finish.)

3563
02:46:19,739 --> 02:46:21,680
The formation is off here.

3564
02:46:22,510 --> 02:46:23,979
Take a step forward after this.

3565
02:46:24,549 --> 02:46:26,350
And forward again... Where are you going?

3566
02:46:27,079 --> 02:46:28,180
Wait, this...

3567
02:46:28,479 --> 02:46:30,249
- Look. Just watch me. - Okay.

3568
02:46:30,250 --> 02:46:31,590
(Their practice is put to a stop.)

3569
02:46:32,450 --> 02:46:33,718
(JEONGMIN watches it quietly.)

3570
02:46:33,719 --> 02:46:34,719
And...

3571
02:46:35,090 --> 02:46:36,859
We have less than a week left now,

3572
02:46:36,860 --> 02:46:39,190
but we've only come this far.

3573
02:46:40,629 --> 02:46:42,760
I feel quite rushed.

3574
02:46:44,229 --> 02:46:45,629
Do I mark him?

3575
02:46:46,629 --> 02:46:47,939
- You mean, JUYOUNG? - Should I?

3576
02:46:47,940 --> 02:46:48,940
JUYOUNG?

3577
02:46:49,739 --> 02:46:51,870
We can correct him step by step.

3578
02:46:52,139 --> 02:46:54,479
Should we divide his part in half and correct him with everything?

3579
02:46:55,379 --> 02:46:57,949
First off, let's fix all your moves one after another.

3580
02:46:57,950 --> 02:46:59,010
Okay.

3581
02:46:59,250 --> 02:47:02,219
Gotta, everybody, make that

3582
02:47:02,319 --> 02:47:03,419
Don't use your shoulders.

3583
02:47:03,420 --> 02:47:04,590
Am I using my shoulders?

3584
02:47:05,090 --> 02:47:06,760
- You do it like this. - I see.

3585
02:47:07,120 --> 02:47:09,959
I taught him the moves we worked on for the first time today,

3586
02:47:10,229 --> 02:47:11,529
and I helped him practice the latter part.

3587
02:47:11,530 --> 02:47:13,930
I helped him fix the wrong gestures too.

3588
02:47:14,459 --> 02:47:16,969
Gotta, everybody, make that money

3589
02:47:17,270 --> 02:47:19,000
You got it all wrong.

3590
02:47:22,270 --> 02:47:25,510
You forgot everything I taught you.

3591
02:47:26,340 --> 02:47:30,109
(JUYOUNG practices repeatedly to get used to the choreography.)

3592
02:47:30,110 --> 02:47:31,180
Okay.

3593
02:47:31,579 --> 02:47:32,579
The end.

3594
02:47:32,580 --> 02:47:33,649
Is it over?

3595
02:47:34,750 --> 02:47:38,090
I helped him with the details for three hours.

3596
02:47:38,219 --> 02:47:39,290
But then...

3597
02:47:39,649 --> 02:47:44,090
(The group practice resumes.)

3598
02:47:44,129 --> 02:47:46,290
(However)

3599
02:47:46,959 --> 02:47:51,328
(JUYOUNG gets his lyrics wrong.)

3600
02:47:51,329 --> 02:47:52,828
Killer flow, killer moves, killer

3601
02:47:52,829 --> 02:47:56,100
Whatever you say, you can't have what you want

3602
02:47:56,370 --> 02:47:58,468
I watched him in a serious mood.

3603
02:47:58,469 --> 02:48:00,610
JUYOUNG kept getting the lyrics wrong.

3604
02:48:00,840 --> 02:48:03,478
But despite his mistake, he got playful there.

3605
02:48:03,479 --> 02:48:06,180
That was when I got mad.

3606
02:48:07,520 --> 02:48:09,879
(He keeps getting the moves wrong even after that.)

3607
02:48:10,920 --> 02:48:14,620
(JEONGMIN's face hardens more and more.)

3608
02:48:17,930 --> 02:48:19,259
Money make purse

3609
02:48:19,260 --> 02:48:20,559
You need to sing, JUYOUNG.

3610
02:48:20,959 --> 02:48:23,930
We have fun like crazy

3611
02:48:26,329 --> 02:48:27,369
- JUYOUNG. - Yes?

3612
02:48:27,370 --> 02:48:28,670
Did you forget all that you worked with me?

3613
02:48:29,139 --> 02:48:30,739
- You mean, this part? - No.

3614
02:48:30,809 --> 02:48:31,969
From start to finish.

3615
02:48:32,370 --> 02:48:34,680
It's completely gone.

3616
02:48:35,110 --> 02:48:37,850
Just to get his moves to be precise,

3617
02:48:38,110 --> 02:48:40,048
a lot of our teammates went through a lot...

3618
02:48:40,049 --> 02:48:42,250
and invested so much time.

3619
02:48:42,379 --> 02:48:43,719
But nothing changed.

3620
02:48:44,190 --> 02:48:46,420
Money... Okay.

3621
02:48:50,329 --> 02:48:52,159
- I'm so angry. - Well...

3622
02:48:53,760 --> 02:48:54,958
- I don't think this is right. - Maybe it's...

3623
02:48:54,959 --> 02:48:56,658
because I taught him wrong.

3624
02:48:56,659 --> 02:48:57,729
No.

3625
02:48:59,129 --> 02:49:01,440
- All... - Never.

3626
02:49:02,299 --> 02:49:03,399
Gosh.

3627
02:49:10,510 --> 02:49:12,009
- JUYOUNG. - Yes?

3628
02:49:12,010 --> 02:49:13,309
- Follow me. - Okay.

3629
02:49:20,049 --> 02:49:21,389
I know that you're trying hard,

3630
02:49:21,690 --> 02:49:23,829
but try harder. Do the best you can do.

3631
02:49:24,229 --> 02:49:25,260
Okay.

3632
02:49:25,559 --> 02:49:27,399
It doesn't even feel like you're dancing, to be honest.

3633
02:49:28,100 --> 02:49:31,199
When I see you dance, it feels like you just...

3634
02:49:31,200 --> 02:49:32,370
mark the moves half-heartedly.

3635
02:49:33,270 --> 02:49:34,770
I got the moves correct for you,

3636
02:49:34,969 --> 02:49:36,670
but you haven't improved one bit.

3637
02:49:37,510 --> 02:49:39,409
This means I have to correct you again for three hours.

3638
02:49:40,309 --> 02:49:41,439
What do you want me to do?

3639
02:49:41,440 --> 02:49:42,680
You keep forgetting the lyrics too.

3640
02:49:43,110 --> 02:49:44,510
And all you do is get playful.

3641
02:49:44,809 --> 02:49:45,849
You feel wronged?

3642
02:49:45,850 --> 02:49:47,849
No. I don't feel wronged.

3643
02:49:47,850 --> 02:49:49,149
This is my fault.

3644
02:49:50,819 --> 02:49:54,260
(After talking with JEONGMIN)

3645
02:49:54,319 --> 02:49:56,360
Your eyes are still teary.

3646
02:49:56,590 --> 02:49:58,829
- Well, yes. - You haven't calmed down yet?

3647
02:49:59,059 --> 02:50:00,398
- No. - Are you okay?

3648
02:50:00,399 --> 02:50:01,399
Well...

3649
02:50:02,129 --> 02:50:04,298
In the beginning since we became a team,

3650
02:50:04,299 --> 02:50:06,399
I stayed quiet...

3651
02:50:06,940 --> 02:50:08,968
and spaced out...

3652
02:50:08,969 --> 02:50:10,969
until around the third day.

3653
02:50:11,209 --> 02:50:13,139
It was hard for me to get used to the new team.

3654
02:50:14,239 --> 02:50:15,638
With so many skilled trainees,

3655
02:50:15,639 --> 02:50:18,649
I was quite intimidated on the first day...

3656
02:50:19,110 --> 02:50:21,520
because they were so talented...

3657
02:50:21,579 --> 02:50:22,978
with good dancing skills too.

3658
02:50:22,979 --> 02:50:24,219
(He felt a distance due to the ability gap.)

3659
02:50:24,750 --> 02:50:26,089
(Well, I'll get used to it.)

3660
02:50:26,090 --> 02:50:27,419
(I'm still not used to the team.)

3661
02:50:27,420 --> 02:50:28,959
(Even after time, he didn't seem to close the gap.)

3662
02:50:29,360 --> 02:50:32,628
I kept having trouble following them when we practised.

3663
02:50:32,629 --> 02:50:34,159
So I stayed down.

3664
02:50:34,659 --> 02:50:38,270
I tried to get playful on purpose...

3665
02:50:38,799 --> 02:50:40,439
to act bright.

3666
02:50:40,440 --> 02:50:43,299
I guess it backfired instead.

3667
02:50:45,969 --> 02:50:47,479
What I did...

3668
02:50:47,940 --> 02:50:50,279
caused harm to the team.

3669
02:50:50,280 --> 02:50:52,649
I thought it was only right to hear such criticism.

3670
02:50:52,879 --> 02:50:54,450
I don't think it's JEONGMIN's fault.

3671
02:50:58,149 --> 02:51:00,920
It's not like we placed last because of his mistake.

3672
02:51:01,020 --> 02:51:02,260
That's not it.

3673
02:51:02,520 --> 02:51:04,090
It's just that I couldn't hold back anymore.

3674
02:51:04,690 --> 02:51:07,399
We don't have much time until the final rehearsal.

3675
02:51:07,659 --> 02:51:10,299
I have a lot to improve myself, at that.

3676
02:51:10,500 --> 02:51:12,000
Then, we'll have to practice until late at night.

3677
02:51:12,030 --> 02:51:13,429
JEONGMIN is eager...

3678
02:51:13,430 --> 02:51:15,138
to do a good job.

3679
02:51:15,139 --> 02:51:17,568
Even in the dorm, he works on the choreography every day...

3680
02:51:17,569 --> 02:51:18,809
at dawn.

3681
02:51:18,940 --> 02:51:20,209
He feels anxious.

3682
02:51:20,639 --> 02:51:22,039
In that situation,

3683
02:51:22,040 --> 02:51:24,079
JEONGMIN was aware of his anxiety too.

3684
02:51:24,950 --> 02:51:25,950
Calm down.

3685
02:51:26,680 --> 02:51:27,849
It'll only do you harm.

3686
02:51:27,850 --> 02:51:29,718
(His teammates help him control his mind.)

3687
02:51:29,719 --> 02:51:31,190
We can do a good job now.

3688
02:51:31,920 --> 02:51:33,149
I'm okay.

3689
02:51:34,989 --> 02:51:37,458
(The team members gather together again after that.)

3690
02:51:37,459 --> 02:51:38,530
It's all right.

3691
02:51:39,889 --> 02:51:42,059
Let's sit down and talk for a bit.

3692
02:51:42,500 --> 02:51:44,329
Let's do it again. Let's try until it works.

3693
02:51:45,299 --> 02:51:47,739
JEONGMIN, you should talk nicely like an aerobics teacher.

3694
02:51:47,799 --> 02:51:48,799
Got it.

3695
02:51:49,040 --> 02:51:50,138
I'll be careful with my words.

3696
02:51:50,139 --> 02:51:51,739
I'm the only one who gets to be angry.

3697
02:51:51,840 --> 02:51:52,940
Got it.

3698
02:51:53,809 --> 02:51:55,709
Should we go over it lightly once?

3699
02:51:56,040 --> 02:51:57,180
Let's do it.

3700
02:51:58,079 --> 02:52:01,379
(The team begins to practice again.)

3701
02:52:03,549 --> 02:52:04,590
It's all right.

3702
02:52:06,850 --> 02:52:10,860
(JUYOUNG gets the lyrics wrong again.)

3703
02:52:11,260 --> 02:52:13,760
Killer flow, killer moves, killer

3704
02:52:14,229 --> 02:52:20,169
(He tries to hold back his tears until the end.)

3705
02:52:20,170 --> 02:52:22,340
You can neither smile nor cry.

3706
02:52:23,870 --> 02:52:24,940
What's wrong?

3707
02:52:25,239 --> 02:52:27,540
- Gosh. - Oh, dear.

3708
02:52:28,110 --> 02:52:30,409
I got the lyrics wrong.

3709
02:52:30,680 --> 02:52:32,478
- I'm sorry. - Don't be.

3710
02:52:32,479 --> 02:52:34,850
- I'm sorry. - Goodness.

3711
02:52:34,950 --> 02:52:36,020
Hey, don't...

3712
02:52:36,079 --> 02:52:38,589
- I'm sorry. - Don't make me feel sorry.

3713
02:52:38,590 --> 02:52:39,988
(He feels so sorry that he bursts out crying.)

3714
02:52:39,989 --> 02:52:41,719
- I'm sorry. - Goodness.

3715
02:52:42,790 --> 02:52:44,189
Gosh, this is heartbreaking.

3716
02:52:44,190 --> 02:52:45,689
I know how you feel.

3717
02:52:45,690 --> 02:52:47,359
- JUYOUNG, why... - Gosh.

3718
02:52:47,360 --> 02:52:48,659
It's all right.

3719
02:52:48,729 --> 02:52:50,228
Let's please go again.

3720
02:52:50,229 --> 02:52:51,899
I'll do better. Please just one more time.

3721
02:52:52,100 --> 02:52:54,639
Just one more time. Please give me a chance.

3722
02:52:55,440 --> 02:52:58,069
I think it's right to do my best to keep up with them.

3723
02:52:58,770 --> 02:53:00,579
If I make an effort,

3724
02:53:01,610 --> 02:53:04,350
the other teammates...

3725
02:53:04,479 --> 02:53:09,819
will eventually give me credit for it one day.

3726
02:53:11,219 --> 02:53:13,590
What if he doesn't improve?

3727
02:53:14,920 --> 02:53:16,190
Until he improves,

3728
02:53:17,059 --> 02:53:19,129
I'll do my best to teach him.

3729
02:53:19,989 --> 02:53:21,860
Are you okay, JUYOUNG? Isn't it tough?

3730
02:53:22,200 --> 02:53:23,429
It's tough.

3731
02:53:23,430 --> 02:53:25,969
But I have no choice but to keep it up.

3732
02:53:26,430 --> 02:53:28,339
They must've thought of me as a nuisance many times.

3733
02:53:28,340 --> 02:53:30,940
I'm always bright, I'm okay even now

3734
02:53:31,409 --> 02:53:33,369
But until the very end,

3735
02:53:33,370 --> 02:53:35,839
they tried hard to make me understand.

3736
02:53:35,840 --> 02:53:39,549
I'd like to give them my gratitude.

3737
02:53:41,120 --> 02:53:42,450
In 1, 2, and 3.

("WORK" by Workers)

3739
02:53:55,260 --> 02:53:56,399
He's totally like an idol.

3740
02:54:06,069 --> 02:54:07,709
They feel like an actual team too.

3741
02:54:17,520 --> 02:54:18,690
He's good.

3742
02:54:18,950 --> 02:54:20,888
(I'll show you, whatever it becomes)

3743
02:54:20,889 --> 02:54:22,658

(Around us)

3745
02:54:25,059 --> 02:54:27,399
(They gather around us, our performance is)

3746
02:54:27,930 --> 02:54:29,000
Wink.

3747
02:54:30,200 --> 02:54:31,228
Wink.

3748
02:54:31,229 --> 02:54:33,670
(Cheering)

3749
02:54:53,590 --> 02:54:55,888
(Chin up, and shine from now on)

3750
02:54:55,889 --> 02:54:58,128
(I'm finally on the stage, I'm enjoying it)

3751
02:54:58,129 --> 02:55:00,059
Gosh, TAESUNG.

3752
02:55:00,760 --> 02:55:03,199
(Big ambition, and I saw my bottom)

3753
02:55:03,200 --> 02:55:05,369
(I try to make plans, but I can't and avoid)

3754
02:55:05,370 --> 02:55:07,539
(I'm always bright, I smile even now)

3755
02:55:07,540 --> 02:55:10,068
(You've always seen me all smiles)

3756
02:55:10,069 --> 02:55:12,269
(I'm not like how I have been)

3757
02:55:12,270 --> 02:55:15,180
(I can even do this kind of stuff)

3758
02:55:16,280 --> 02:55:19,950
(It's totally satisfying for the audience.)

3759
02:55:21,020 --> 02:55:23,179
(Killer flow, killer moves, killer clothes)

3760
02:55:23,180 --> 02:55:25,789
(You can't have it even if you want no matter what you do)

3761
02:55:25,790 --> 02:55:28,359
(The clothes have dried already, but you get wet again)

3762
02:55:28,360 --> 02:55:30,590
(I'll pay for the laundry, what do you say about me?)

3763
02:55:32,760 --> 02:55:35,298
(I'm busy every week, don't call me and leave me be)

3764
02:55:35,299 --> 02:55:37,628
(Please leave me be, so I make it)

3765
02:55:37,629 --> 02:55:40,228
(I'm busy now, later give me love)

3766
02:55:40,229 --> 02:55:42,569
(Work it like I talk it, we mix only the good things)

3767
02:55:43,639 --> 02:55:45,540
Their moves and gestures are just like hip-hop musicians.

3768

(We have fun like crazy on stage, walk, work)

3769
02:55:57,719 --> 02:55:58,750
Gosh.

3770
02:55:59,950 --> 02:56:01,389
This is legendary.

3771
02:56:14,270 --> 02:56:16,739
(It's just impressive.)

3772
02:56:18,969 --> 02:56:21,409

3779
02:56:43,229 --> 02:56:44,700
(Fancams and the center's videos will be released after Episode 4.)

3780
02:56:46,170 --> 02:56:47,539
- Gosh. - That was crazy.

3781
02:56:47,540 --> 02:56:48,840
(The heat doesn't die down even after the performance.)

3782
02:56:49,340 --> 02:56:51,068
They're all so good.

3783
02:56:51,069 --> 02:56:52,309
- I know. - They're good at rapping and...

3784
02:56:52,840 --> 02:56:54,510
- Gosh. - Honey.

3785
02:56:55,110 --> 02:56:56,840
They're so good.

3786
02:56:57,350 --> 02:56:58,509
We did well.

(Team "WORK" leaves the stage after the performance.)

3788
02:56:59,809 --> 02:57:01,819
- We did well. - Good job.

3789
02:57:02,420 --> 02:57:03,718
- Good work. - JUYOUNG, did you do well?

3790
02:57:03,719 --> 02:57:05,818
- Yes, I didn't make any mistakes. - Good job.

3791
02:57:05,819 --> 02:57:07,859
I didn't make any mistakes, but I'm not so satisfied.

3792
02:57:07,860 --> 02:57:10,690
You need to have regrets to do better next time.

3793
02:57:10,829 --> 02:57:12,089
- JUYOUNG, you were cool. - Thank you.

3794
02:57:12,090 --> 02:57:13,388
- You were cool. - You really were cool.

3795
02:57:13,389 --> 02:57:14,699
- You did well. - The audience loved it.

3796
02:57:14,700 --> 02:57:15,700
You went through so much.

3797
02:57:15,860 --> 02:57:17,398
I'm sorry I told you off so much.

3798
02:57:17,399 --> 02:57:19,169
- No, don't be. - It was all for you.

3799
02:57:19,170 --> 02:57:21,100
- Right. It's totally fine. - Let me give you a hug.

Just be a nutjob.

3806
02:57:34,149 --> 02:57:36,148
Stop talking like you're the only victim here.

3807

Stop cornering me, please.

3808
02:57:37,819 --> 02:57:40,250

He's a genius.

3813
02:57:52,770 --> 02:57:54,239
He kind of seemed like he was possessed.

3814
02:57:54,870 --> 02:57:55,898

(The qualification of winning the benefit?)

3823
02:58:18,590 --> 02:58:20,128
I couldn't accept the result...

3824
02:58:20,129 --> 02:58:22,860
