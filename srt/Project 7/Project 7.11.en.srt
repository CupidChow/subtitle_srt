00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:02,389
The new rankings of 35 trainees,

186
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,259
and...

187
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:08,459
whether each passed or was eliminated is decided.

188
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,100
For the third global voting,

189
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,129
different from previous votings that chose seven trainees,

190
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:20,300
each voter could pick only three trainees.

191
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:23,240
So the result is totally different from the previous ones.

192
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,310
(The voting circumstances are different this time.)

193
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,240
Also, benefits from Original Matching...

194
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,920
might have a huge impact on trainees' rankings.

195
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,120
I hope the viewers stay tuned to see the result.

196
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,090
The result is unpredictable.

197
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:39,889
I have no idea when only three are picked.

198
00:08:40,629 --> 00:08:42,759
The way to announce your rankings in the Third Passing Ceremony...

199
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,929
will be done by teams for Original Matching.

200
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:48,370
Each team will come up the stage,

201
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,100
and in each team,

202
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:53,909
except for the Top 7 candidates and 21st place,

203
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,269
the trainees' rankings will be announced.

204
00:08:57,539 --> 00:08:59,840
The 3rd Passing Ceremony of PROJECT 7 begins now.

205
00:09:00,309 --> 00:09:03,250
The first team that I will announce the trainees that passed...

206
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:08,289
- "Breaking News." - "Breaking News."

207
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:15,559
is Team "Time After Time."

208
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:20,870
It's Team "Time After Time."

209
00:09:20,929 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm so...

210
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:24,470
not ready for this.

211
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,299
I don't feel I'm ready.

212
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,139
It's all right. You can do it.

213
00:09:29,309 --> 00:09:30,940
All the trainees in Team "Time After Time,"

214
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,409
please come up to the stage.

215
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,379
I'm scared.

216
00:09:35,549 --> 00:09:38,019
For Team "Time After Time," a lot of trainees in vocal positions...

217
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:40,649
in PROJECT 7 are assembled.

218
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,090
So the team attracted attention before the performance.

219
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:46,419
I don't want to do this part.

220
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:49,990
As trainees who sing so well discussed how to divide the parts,

221
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,799
the team once had a crisis.

222
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,899
Honestly, I don't understand.

223
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,500
But their friendship overcame the crisis,

224
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,039
and they showed the performance that appealed...

225
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:03,210
to World Assemblers' hearts.

226
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:07,350
The team ranked fourth on the on-site voting,

227
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,980
and Trainee WOO HAJOON took first place...

228
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,149
and won the benefit alone in the team.

229
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:18,820
Now, in Team "Time After Time,"

230
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:23,059
except for 21st place and the Top 7 candidates,

231
00:10:23,429 --> 00:10:25,429
trainees who passed will be announced.

232
00:10:26,429 --> 00:10:27,600
This is killing me.

233
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,600
(26th place, SHIN JAEWON, Week 6 ranking)

234
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,330
(11th place, BINGHUA, Week 6 ranking)

235
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:31,769
It makes me nervous.

236
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,799
- What? - Why am I feeling nervous?

237
00:10:34,809 --> 00:10:36,610
In Team "Time After Time,"

238
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:38,340
(16th place, YOO YOUNGSEO, Week 6 ranking)

239
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,080
(22nd place, LEE HANBIN, Week 6 ranking)

240
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,909
the ranking of the trainee to be announced...

241
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,250
(34th place, WU CHENYU, Week 6 ranking)

242
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,179
(The trainee ranked 10th will be announced.)

243
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,490
- is tenth. - Tenth?

244
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:52,259
The tenth place is taken right away.

245
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,259
It could be HAJOON or BINGHUA.

246
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,700
Could it be HAJOON?

247
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:58,799
I guess it's HAJOON.

248
00:10:59,129 --> 00:11:01,200
He was in tenth place last time.

249
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,000
BINGHUA was in 11th place.

250
00:11:05,669 --> 00:11:07,269
On the stage, this trainee...

251
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:09,509
shows himself...

252
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:10,639
totally changed.

253
00:11:10,909 --> 00:11:11,909
Isn't it HAJOON, then?

254
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:13,779
I guess you're right.

255
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:15,009
It's BINGHUA, as I see.

256
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:16,049
HAJOON doesn't change completely.

257
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:22,090
And his popularity has a rising trend,

258
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:24,320
increasing at a terrific speed.

259
00:11:24,789 --> 00:11:26,120
That must be HAJOON.

260
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,659
"HAJOON is scary."

261
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:30,230
I was very nervous,

262
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:34,100
but I think I have a chance this time.

263
00:11:35,169 --> 00:11:37,200
I think it could be YOUNGSEO.

264
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,200
YOUNGSEO? It could be.

265
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,909
YOUNGSEO had consistently high rankings.

266
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:41,940
Right.

267
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,309
I have been...

268
00:11:43,309 --> 00:11:46,980
consistently getting higher rankings.

269
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,009
I really wanted it.

270
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,950
With a global voting score of 1.23 million...

271
00:11:54,049 --> 00:11:55,620
Over 1.23 million?

272
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,350
It's that high?

273
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,860
With a score of 1,237,754 points...

274
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,860
(A global voting score of 1,237,754 points)

275
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,159
Trainee WOO HAJOON.

276
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,100
(10th place, trainee WOO HAJOON)

277
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,529
Congratulations.

278
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,210
Trainee WOO HAJOON.

279
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,240
Oh, my.

280
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:17,440
- HAJOON. - He went up a lot.

281
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,480
Congratulations.

282
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,110
Thanks to his team members' help...

283
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,409
and late-night practices,

284
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,519
trainee HAJOON improved in real time.

285
00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:29,320
He's the growing type.

286
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:33,190
With his hard work, he received feedback...

287
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:36,059
that he has good facial expressions on stage.

288
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:40,259
He also received praise that he was born to be an idol.

289
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,929
"Born to be an idol."

290
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:45,740
We look forward to seeing you...

291
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:49,269
continue to grow in the last part of this journey.

292
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,080
He must be relieved.

293
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,250
Seriously. Being called right now...

294
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,519
I will continue with the announcements.

295
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,690
The ranking of the trainee that will be announced now...

296
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,190
is the 12th place.

297
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:12,029
The one right after.

298
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,899
I was 12th place at the 2nd Passing Ceremony.

299
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:20,470
- Either YOUNGSEO or BINGHUA. - YOUNGSEO? BINGHUA?

300
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,970
I think YOUNGSEO...

301
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:24,610
or BINGHUA will be in the top ten.

302
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:28,409
I was very nervous because my ranking kept dropping.

303
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,820
- I think it's BINGHUA. - Right.

304
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:32,879
It could be YOUNGSEO.

305
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:34,590
- BINGHUA. - YOUNGSEO?

306
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,220
To give you a hint,

307
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,059
this trainee is full of emotions...

308
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:42,429
and cries often.

309
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:44,659
- They're all emotional. - I don't know who that is.

310
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,039
HANBIN cries very easily.

311
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:55,340
(22nd, LEE HANBIN, Week 8 ranking)

312
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:58,009
Also, many trainees say...

313
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,779
they'd like to switch appearances with this trainee.

314
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,220
- I'm sorry. It's not HANBIN. - Is it me?

315
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,649
Look forward. It's okay.

316
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:07,019
- Why? - Don't be disappointed.

317
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:10,450
- It's definitely not HANBIN. - Who is it?

318
00:14:10,789 --> 00:14:12,159
It could be HANBIN.

319
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,429
With a global voting score...

320
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:20,600
- of 941,824 points... - Oh, my.

321
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,169
That's quite a difference.

322
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:23,929
From over a million points...

323
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,370
Trainee BINGHUA. Congratulations.

324
00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:28,240
Good work.

325
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:31,679
Our fairy, BINGHUA.

326
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:34,009
He looks so pretty after dyeing his hair.

327
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:36,409
- He has become even prettier. - He has become an elf.

328
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:39,649
Even when listening to music...

329
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,419
or watching choreography videos,

330
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:43,990
trainee BINGHUA cried very often.

331
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,690
He was busy.

332
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:49,659
- "When do I cry? I normally cry." - He cries whenever he can.

333
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:54,330
He was very sincere about "Time After Time."

334
00:14:55,669 --> 00:14:58,470
He unexpectedly had to fight over a part...

335
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:00,870
with trainee WU CHENYU, who is a close friend.

336
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:03,409
He even pulled the heartstrings...

337
00:15:03,409 --> 00:15:07,279
of the World Assemblers with this drama.

338
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:13,350
It was a beautiful love story.

339
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,019
They said it wasn't a dating show, but they ended up making it one.

340
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:20,889
We are announcing which trainees from Team "Time After Time..."

341
00:15:20,889 --> 00:15:22,190
made it to the next round.

342
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,629
The ranking of the next trainee who has made it to the next round...

343
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,529
Again?

344
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:29,970
- This team has three already. - They all got high rankings.

345
00:15:30,669 --> 00:15:34,100
The 14th place.

346
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,509
I thought the rankings would change a lot,

347
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:41,279
so I was just as nervous as the first time.

348
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:45,820
This trainee is thought of...

349
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,049
by the World Assemblers...

350
00:15:48,049 --> 00:15:49,950
as the main vocalist of PROJECT 7.

351
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,720
They're all main vocalists.

352
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:55,529
It's all five of them. They're all main vocalists.

353
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,629
- They are all main vocalists. - They are all main vocalists.

354
00:15:59,629 --> 00:16:01,129
They're all main vocalists.

355
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,730
With a global voting score...

356
00:16:04,269 --> 00:16:09,070
of 889,686 points...

357
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,720
Trainee YOO YOUNGSEO.

358
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,220
(14th place, trainee YOO YOUNGSEO)

359
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:29,429
- Congratulations. - Good work.

360
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,100
- Thank you. - My brother.

361
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,799
Congratulations, YOUNGSEO.

362
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,240
Trainee YOO YOUNGSEO was both the leader...

363
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,440
and the main vocalist during Original Matching.

364
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:44,070
He was busier than anyone else.

365
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,539
Come here, YOUNGSEO.

366
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,279
I'm so glad.

367
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,580
By handling the endless high notes...

368
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:55,350
and difficult choreography without any issues,

369
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,720
he successfully won...

370
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:00,789
the hearts of the World Assemblers.

371
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,630
(The 3rd Passing Ceremony, 14th place)

372
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:07,799
(So far, 3 trainees have made it.)

373
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,240
There're seven spots left, excluding the ones already being called.

374
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,670
There are 10 spots, and they've already called 3 people.

375
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,970
Will there be more?

376
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,150
(Will Team "Time After Time" have more trainees that make it?)

377
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:23,849
I will continue...

378
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:27,549
announcing the results of Team "Time After Time."

379
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:28,849
There's more?

380
00:17:29,589 --> 00:17:31,289
I will continue...

381
00:17:32,589 --> 00:17:33,690
I think there is.

382
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:35,759
There is.

383
00:17:36,529 --> 00:17:38,029
to announce the next trainee...

384
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:41,230
- in Team "Time After Time." - Please.

385
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,069
Please let me be on the list.

386
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,240
I really hope I am.

387
00:17:46,069 --> 00:17:47,670
Please. LEE HANBIN.

388
00:17:49,509 --> 00:17:51,779
We're going to make it to the finals. Let's go together.

389
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,279
We can do it.

390
00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:56,009
The next trainee who has made it...

391
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:57,880
is no one.

392
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,549
No one.

393
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,289
No one.

394
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,289
No one.

395
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,329
Unfortunately, there are no more survivors...

396
00:18:14,329 --> 00:18:16,700
from Team "Time After Time."

397
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,809
But there is still the 21st place and the Top 7 candidate spot,

398
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:24,710
so please don't give up until the end...

399
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,039
and wait.

400
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:28,809
Gosh, good work.

401
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:34,250
I'd like to thank the World Assemblers...

402
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,019
who has given me a chance...

403
00:18:36,019 --> 00:18:38,720
to be in such a nice position.

404
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:44,700
I don't know when my last performance will be,

405
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:48,200
but I will work my hardest until that last performance.

406
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:53,369
Also, to Team "Time After Time."

407
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:57,980
We got to make good music together,

408
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:02,180
and we produced a good piece of work.

409
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,920
It was a nice experience, and I'm grateful for that.

410
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:09,690
I was able to get here because of you guys.

411
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:14,930
I'll be confident and work even harder until the end.

412
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:21,200
CHENYU can definitely be a singer.

413
00:19:21,329 --> 00:19:22,730
Let's meet on stage in the future.

414
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,839
Make it to the Top Seven.

415
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:31,069
And really good work.

416
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,309
I might not be here next time,

417
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,079
but work hard...

418
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,450
and make it to the Top Seven.

419
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:47,420
Answer me now. Okay?

420
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,829
- Yes, sir. - Okay.

421
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,799
The person who was with me since the beginning of the show...

422
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,539
and helped me out a lot...

423
00:19:58,539 --> 00:20:00,569
is still standing there.

424
00:20:02,109 --> 00:20:03,369
I feel...

425
00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:06,480
so happy but sad.

426
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,079
I'll remind you one more time,

427
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:16,490
but there are other announcements to be made,

428
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:19,220
so I ask that you don't let go of hope until the end.

429
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,660
Trainees WOO HAJOON, BINGHUA, and YOO YOUNGSEO.

430
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,000
Go to the seat...

431
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,869
with your ranking in the Pass Section.

432
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,039
So this is how it feels to be left here.

433
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:38,539
(HAJOON, BINGHUA, and YOUNGSEO move to the Pass Section.)

434
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:46,680
It doesn't feel great.

435
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:50,519
- Good work. - Really?

436
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:51,559
Good work.

437
00:20:51,819 --> 00:20:52,920
Good work.

438
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,029
- You did work hard. - Good work.

439
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,829
I was hoping that the last spot...

440
00:21:00,329 --> 00:21:01,500
of 21st place...

441
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,630
would be mine.

442
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,609
It must be nerve-wracking to watch...

443
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:12,210
the Third Passing Ceremony.

444
00:21:12,609 --> 00:21:14,309
Before the next announcement,

445
00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:17,910
we will watch a video prepared for our World Assemblers...

446
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:20,619
before we continue on.

447
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:24,789
(The 3rd Passing Ceremony will continue after the video.)

448
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:30,390
(The trainees are leaving of Project Village for an outing.)

449
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:35,170
(Where are they?)

450
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:39,099
(A sauna to melt away their exhaustion)

451
00:21:40,539 --> 00:21:42,069
My exhaustion is melting away.

452
00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:47,039
Have you been to a sauna in Korea, KENSHIN?

453
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,210
- It's my first time. - It's your first time?

454
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:51,009
- Is that why you were nervous? - It's so fun.

455
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:52,180
It's so fun.

456
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,349
It's my first time too.

457
00:21:53,349 --> 00:21:55,089
- It's your first time too, ANDY? - It's my first time too.

458
00:21:55,089 --> 00:21:57,019
- It's my first time too. - It's your first time too?

459
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:02,289
I've only seen YICHEN in desperate situations,

460
00:22:02,289 --> 00:22:03,890
- but now that we're here, - Doesn't he seem like an old man?

461
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:04,930
he's very...

462
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,430
I was going to say he's very much like a baby.

463
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,569
I was going to say he's very much like a baby.

464
00:22:12,569 --> 00:22:14,339
- Hey. I look like an old man? - Okay.

465
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:16,109
We worked so hard to make it to the finals.

466
00:22:16,109 --> 00:22:18,339
Let's recharge a bit here...

467
00:22:18,339 --> 00:22:20,680
and work very hard for the finals.

468
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,880
Let's melt away all of the stress...

469
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,450
we built up from PROJECT 7.

470
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:25,619
Exactly.

471
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:27,880
The year is almost coming to a close, right?

472
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,920
We'll give you some time to frankly talk about things...

473
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,460
that you haven't been able to tell each other before.

474
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,460
- Okay. - Okay.

475
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,160
Me.

476
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,490
Okay. You go first, LYNNLYNN.

477
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:39,259
- To who? - Who is this for?

478
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:40,660
Come here, old man.

479
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,599
(Come here, old man YICHEN!)

480
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,769
Old man?

481
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,569
Go, YICHEN.

482
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:51,980
I'll go.

483
00:22:53,009 --> 00:22:54,039
Oh, gosh.

484
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,480
Let's go.

485
00:22:55,579 --> 00:22:57,079
Let's go.

486
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,750
You're so small...

487
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:00,750
What?

488
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:04,319
But you're too loud.

489
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,329
(Good job, LYNNLYNN.)

490
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,299
When we were in P5,

491
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:16,299
why did you say, "You, get out?"

492
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,339
Why did you say, "You, get out?"

493
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,009
Shouldn't you apologize to JIMIN?

494
00:23:22,009 --> 00:23:24,470
But they were all young.

495
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:26,509
SVIAT was going, " Oh, my."

496
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,210
When I'd say, "Everyone, gather around."

497
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,579
The foreigner didn't understand.

498
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,079
That was the way I could lead.

499
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,920
(Take that.)

500
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:38,359
The camera.

501
00:23:38,619 --> 00:23:39,619
But...

502
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:40,619
(Getting splashed with water)

503
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:43,460
- Calm down. - Don't lie, please!

504
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,259
(Team P5's fight is so fun.)

505
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,670
LYNNLYNN is so funny.

506
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:50,700
I have something I want to say.

507
00:23:50,769 --> 00:23:52,539
Even though YICHEN created a legendary scene,

508
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:54,470
but as a member of P5,

509
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:55,640
I'm grateful to YICHEN.

510
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,509
It was really hard for him too.

511
00:23:57,509 --> 00:23:59,210
- Come on. - You said you wouldn't do that.

512
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:00,309
Hold on.

513
00:24:00,309 --> 00:24:02,880
- Okay. - He's not that innocent.

514
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:05,480
- He's not innocent? - Right.

515
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,019
- A liar. - "Hey, LYNNLYNN."

516
00:24:07,019 --> 00:24:09,690
"Why is YICHEN doing that?"

517
00:24:11,089 --> 00:24:14,359
(I saw everything.)

518
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:15,859
I didn't do that!

519
00:24:17,329 --> 00:24:18,529
Oh, my gosh.

520
00:24:18,529 --> 00:24:20,099
Is that how you really are, MAJINGXIANG?

521
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:23,269
- No, I seriously didn't do that. - MAJINGXIANG is so funny.

522
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:25,539
You have a mic on. Please.

523
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,539
- Camera! - I seriously didn't...

524
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:28,609
Seriously.

525
00:24:28,869 --> 00:24:29,970
(Sincerely denying it)

526
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,240
Don't you know me, YICHEN?

527
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,410
You know me. Can't you tell?

528
00:24:32,579 --> 00:24:34,609
The World Assemblers saw the show.

529
00:24:34,609 --> 00:24:35,849
- Okay, I got it. - Hey!

530
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:37,579
- These people are lying! - Okay.

531
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:38,819
I feel so wronged, YICHEN.

532
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,019
LYNNLYNN, you're the best.

533
00:24:41,019 --> 00:24:43,190
- You're the best. - I love you, LYNNLYNN.

534
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,750
Okay, let's go!

535
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:46,289
This will be spicy.

536
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,559
Come here, MAJINGXIANG.

537
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:53,759
- YEOJUN. - MAJINGXIANG!

538
00:24:54,099 --> 00:24:56,329
- Oh, it's surprising. - Let's go, YEOJUN!

539
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:57,799
- Let's go! - This is fun.

540
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,799
- Let's go! - Oh, my.

541
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:01,269
Let's go, YEOJUN!

542
00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:02,440
(Trainee MAJINGXIANG versus trainee JANG YEOJUN)

543
00:25:02,539 --> 00:25:04,609
Firstly, you're too tall, so don't come too close.

544
00:25:04,609 --> 00:25:05,880
Okay.

545
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,339
(Keeping a safe distance to protect the trainees)

546
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,450
Why did you ask for my part?

547
00:25:11,349 --> 00:25:13,019
(Oh, my)

548
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:24,690
I have something I want to ask you, YEOJUN.

549
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,529
Could I try this part?

550
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,230
Oh, I'm sorry.

551
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,269
If so,

552
00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:34,140
why did you also ask LYNNLYNN for his part?

553
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:36,769
For his part?

554
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:37,769
LYNNLYNN...

555
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,279
So the thing is...

556
00:25:41,849 --> 00:25:42,849
Why?

557
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:47,480
LYNNLYNN said I could take it if I could do it.

558
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,490
Lies!

559
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:52,059
No, you said so, LYNNLYNN.

560
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,920
- That's true. - Okay.

561
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,990
- Who can top that? - You're right.

562
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,690
Lastly,

563
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:00,059
why did you also ask HYUNWOO for his part?

564
00:26:01,529 --> 00:26:03,470
(So fun)

565
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,200
Oh, I'm sorry, HYUNWOO.

566
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,369
Hold on. Go over there.

567
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,309
This is insane!

568
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,579
(Trainee KIM HYUNWOO steps up.)

569
00:26:13,579 --> 00:26:14,839
- What is this? - Again?

570
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:17,680
You know you took two of my parts, right?

571
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:19,650
- What? Oh, right. - Oh, my!

572
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,720
You didn't even say thank you.

573
00:26:23,289 --> 00:26:25,190
(No way.)

574
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:28,589
- No. Hold on. - Hey, how could you do that?

575
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:30,289
I always said to you in the training room...

576
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:32,559
after practicing this, "Thanks, HYUNWOO."

577
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,299
Can you bend down a bit?

578
00:26:34,299 --> 00:26:35,670
- Standing on my toes is tiring. - Oh, okay.

579
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:37,029
(A issue of height difference)

580
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,269
- Hold on! - You have to keep doing that.

581
00:26:40,539 --> 00:26:41,970
Camera!

582
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,839
HYUNWOO's feet were like this in the water!

583
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:45,910
(HYUNWOO's feet were like this.)

584
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,880
That was fascinating. He was standing on his toes.

585
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,680
- HYUNWOO! - HYUNWOO is almost like KOTARO now.

586
00:26:50,849 --> 00:26:51,849
At first...

587
00:26:51,849 --> 00:26:54,680
(Deciding to all sit down)

588
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:58,690
I know how you feel.

589
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,819
- I know how you feel. - I love it.

590
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,289
I wanted to do better than you,

591
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:05,029
- Okay. - but...

592
00:27:05,029 --> 00:27:07,500
you were much better...

593
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,529
than I thought.

594
00:27:08,529 --> 00:27:09,829
I love you, HYUNWOO.

595
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,099
HYUNWOO, get on your toes.

596
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:15,210
I love you, MAJINGXIANG.

597
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:17,109
- I love you, HYUNWOO. - We have no bad feelings now.

598
00:27:17,109 --> 00:27:18,210
- There weren't any to begin with. - Okay.

599
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:19,440
It's starting to get a bit boring.

600
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,410
- Oh, it's MINSEO. - MINSEO.

601
00:27:22,579 --> 00:27:23,680
Come here, JANG YEOJUN!

602
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,019
Me?

603
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,019
I saw that you said this on the show.

604
00:27:29,089 --> 00:27:30,089
What?

605
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:33,920
People who have already debuted aren't as desperate.

606
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:36,559
They aren't as desperate.

607
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,200
I think the guys who have debuted before...

608
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,700
must have a different goal and mindset...

609
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,039
about being on this show.

610
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,470
YEOJUN, why did you say that?

611
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:49,269
- I want to carefully ask. - Okay.

612
00:27:49,269 --> 00:27:51,369
- I wanted to explain myself too. - Okay.

613
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:53,039
This is your second attempt, right?

614
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:54,640
Regardless of your position,

615
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,079
you always try to keep going and improve.

616
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:58,779
I think that's cool.

617
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,880
I can attest to that. He said that a lot.

618
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,650
You came on this show to compete with a newbie like me.

619
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:04,720
- I'm so grateful. - Come on.

620
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,890
I'll do my best, MINSEO.

621
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,019
(I'll do my best, MINSEO!)

622
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,059
Come here.

623
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,859
During the first title song mission,

624
00:28:10,859 --> 00:28:12,660
you abandoned me and went to P4.

625
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,529
- No! - No!

626
00:28:14,529 --> 00:28:16,269
- No! - No!

627
00:28:17,099 --> 00:28:19,170
When you were practicing in the bathroom,

628
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:21,240
I almost couldn't go to the bathroom because I felt bad.

629
00:28:21,369 --> 00:28:22,970
Why did you do that?

630
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,769
I'm sorry.

631
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,279
- When we were in P1. - In P1?

632
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:30,250
Yes. You talked so much.

633
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:36,490
You will rank the funniest trainees,

634
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,319
and that will be the order you choose your socks.

635
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:40,619
I vote for LYNNLYNN.

636
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:41,789
I vote for LYNNLYNN.

637
00:28:41,789 --> 00:28:43,589
- I vote for LYNNLYNN. - Thank you!

638
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:44,930
LYNNLYNN.

639
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:45,960
(LYNNLYNN was unanimously selected as the "You, Come Here!" winner.)

640
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,799
These socks go to...

641
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:49,930
- old man YICHEN! - Hey!

642
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:51,940
- I don't like these. - Yes!

643
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,740
They suit you.

644
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,869
Just accept them.

645
00:28:54,869 --> 00:28:55,910
So cool.

646
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:57,509
(Giving each of the trainees a pair of socks that suit them)

647
00:28:57,509 --> 00:28:58,640
- YURA. - Me?

648
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,779
Okay.

649
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,650
- Oh, LYNNLYNN. Thank you. - Yes.

650
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:05,319
- KENSHIN. - Oh, my gosh.

651
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,450
Thank you so much!

652
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,789
- These are mine. - So cute.

653
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:13,819
Applause!

654
00:29:14,589 --> 00:29:15,660
(They put on their cute socks and gathered back up.)

655
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,059
Green and red.

656
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:18,700
- Panda. - You have a red pair.

657
00:29:19,859 --> 00:29:20,900
I want to play games.

658
00:29:22,299 --> 00:29:24,569
If we bet on eggs and sikhye,

659
00:29:24,569 --> 00:29:25,569
I can play anything.

660
00:29:25,569 --> 00:29:27,299
The game you will play...

661
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:28,609
is Zombie Game.

662
00:29:28,609 --> 00:29:29,809
- What is that? - Zombie?

663
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:32,809
(The team that catches more humans as zombies who can't see wins.)

664
00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:34,410
I don't know where I am.

665
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,380
- Where am I? - Oh, my!

666
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,980
(If a human who gets caught by a zombie screams, they're out.)

667
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,750
We are split by the color of our sauna clothes.

668
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,420
How about we split the team by color...

669
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,190
and send one person to the gray team?

670
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:49,089
- That sounds nice. - Two, four...

671
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:50,589
Put the blindfolds on properly.

672
00:29:50,589 --> 00:29:52,329
- Put the blindfolds on properly. - Okay.

673
00:29:52,329 --> 00:29:54,430
- I'm watching you, YURA. - No.

674
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,369
(Zombie Game Round 1 begins.)

675
00:29:58,029 --> 00:29:59,799
(Zombie MAJINGXIANG walks around aggressively.)

676
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:01,039
Old man!

677
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,769
(Catching KENSHIN, his fellow zombie)

678
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,839
- Who are you? - Oh, sorry, KENSHIN.

679
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,240
- Oh, my! Who are you? - Oh, I'm sorry.

680
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,410
You scared me.

681
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:12,519
(MINSEO is confusing the zombies by clapping.)

682
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,750
- What? - Zombies. They're the same.

683
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,190
(Zombie MAJINGXIANG is using all of his hearing power.)

684
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,420
Wait. Who are you?

685
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,289
(Human KIM SUNGMIN barely got away.)

686
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:21,960
- Who are you? - Calm down.

687
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:25,089
(Human ANDY has been pushed into a corner.)

688
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:26,130
KENSHIN?

689
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:27,329
- Who are you? - Old man.

690
00:30:27,329 --> 00:30:28,430
Wait. Who are you?

691
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:31,869
(The first human, ANDY, is out.)

692
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,099
- What is this? - Oh, my.

693
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:35,269
(After his first successful catch, Zombie MAJINGXIANG is going crazy.)

694
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:36,509
Wait. Who are you?

695
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:39,380
- Let go of me. - Who are you?

696
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,380
Okay.

697
00:30:40,509 --> 00:30:41,509
Hey!

698
00:30:42,349 --> 00:30:44,509
(Zombie MAJINGXIANG has great hearing.)

699
00:30:44,579 --> 00:30:45,579
Oh, the sound.

700
00:30:46,619 --> 00:30:47,619
Who is this?

701
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:50,890
(The 3rd human, YICHEN, is already out.)

702
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,319
Okay!

703
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:53,890
- Okay. - Okay!

704
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:55,019
Old man!

705
00:30:55,259 --> 00:30:57,190
Hey. Can MAJINGXIANG see?

706
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,460
- No. I can't see. - Hey, do you swear?

707
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,599
- Who are you? - Who are you?

708
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:02,700
(Zombie MAJINGXIANG has a 100-percent success rate.)

709
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,730
- Who are you? - Oh, gosh!

710
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:05,130
Who are you?

711
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,740
I surrender.

712
00:31:07,069 --> 00:31:08,640
There's someone here! Who are you?

713
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,740
LYNNLYNN.

714
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,809
(They have 2 seconds left.)

715
00:31:10,809 --> 00:31:11,880
Who are you?

716
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,880
(They have 1 second left.)

717
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,339
(Game over)

718
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,680
Okay. It's over.

719
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,180
(MAJINGXIANG single-handedly caught 4 of the 6 humans.)

720
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,079
Start.

721
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:20,849
(Zombie Game Round 2 begins.)

722
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,089
Zombies, if we grab each other,

723
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:23,519
- say your name, okay? - I got you!

724
00:31:23,849 --> 00:31:25,319
- I caught someone! - I caught someone.

725
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:26,460
- Who is this? - ANDY.

726
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,029
Who is this? I don't have any sense of space.

727
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:31,730
It's so scary.

728
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:33,400
I don't know where I am.

729
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:35,130
I can't see anything.

730
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:37,029
- I can't see anything. - How did you catch people?

731
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,099
(The new zombie attacks his own kind first.)

732
00:31:39,099 --> 00:31:40,470
- Who is it? - It's me.

733
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:43,140
- I caught someone. - ANDY.

734
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:45,279
- Let's hold hands. I'm scared. - Okay.

735
00:31:45,339 --> 00:31:46,440
Let's hold hands...

736
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,579
- and push them to one side. - Who is this?

737
00:31:47,609 --> 00:31:49,549
- Who is this? It's me. ANDY. - Here.

738
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:50,880
I caught someone. Who is this?

739
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,450
I caught someone. Who is this?

740
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,849
- I don't think I can do this. - I don't think I can do this.

741
00:31:55,849 --> 00:31:57,819
- It's so difficult. - We haven't caught even one yet.

742
00:31:58,289 --> 00:31:59,789
Our team is too weak.

743
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:02,630
- Who is this? - It's me.

744
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:04,160
(Remaining time: 1 second)

745
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:07,000
(Team Red fails to hunt the humans!)

746
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,599
- Team Gray won. - Really?

747
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:11,400
(Team Gray won the Zombie Game.)

748
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,140
(What's the next game?)

749
00:32:15,609 --> 00:32:17,769
Now, we'll play the Toy Hammer Game.

750
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,880
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

751
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,380
(The winner attacks with the toy hammer.)

752
00:32:23,049 --> 00:32:25,450
(The loser defends with the pot.)

753
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:26,880
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

754
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,519
(The person who succeeds in attacking first wins.)

755
00:32:31,289 --> 00:32:34,160
- ATILLA. - Let's go.

756
00:32:34,289 --> 00:32:36,930
This will determine who wins.

757
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:39,099
Let me tell you about our team's KANG MINSEO.

758
00:32:39,099 --> 00:32:41,099
He's a man crazy about winning and a crazily passionate man.

759
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,369
He's a crazy man who gets angry and also cries because of competition.

760
00:32:43,369 --> 00:32:44,730
- Let's see that. - Let's show them.

761
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:45,740
Okay.

762
00:32:45,769 --> 00:32:47,640
(Why aren't you doing the same for me?)

763
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:48,769
What?

764
00:32:50,509 --> 00:32:52,980
(Team Gray isn't introducing the player.)

765
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,579
- I don't know Korean. - Why do you not like me?

766
00:32:56,579 --> 00:32:58,549
I don't know Korean either.

767
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,819
That was nice.

768
00:33:00,049 --> 00:33:01,849
- We got a head start. - Okay.

769
00:33:01,849 --> 00:33:03,089
Hey. ATILLA.

770
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:05,559
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

771
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,920
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

772
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,059
(The first round is a tie.)

773
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:13,730
ATILLA.

774
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:17,029
Rock-paper-scissors.

775
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:19,970
(The second round is tied too.)

776
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:21,099
What are you two doing?

777
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:22,539
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

778
00:33:22,539 --> 00:33:24,769
(FONG ATILLA: paper versus KANG MINSEO: scissors)

779
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,039
(He succeeds in defending.)

780
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,109
- Nice. - Rock-paper-scissors.

781
00:33:31,579 --> 00:33:33,279
Nice.

782
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:34,980
Nice, ATILLA.

783
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:36,289
Rock-paper-scissors.

784
00:33:36,289 --> 00:33:38,549
(FONG ATILLA: paper versus KANG MINSEO: scissors)

785
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:40,990
(He succeeds in attacking.)

786
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:42,960
Nice.

787
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:44,529
Good job.

788
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:45,900
Hitting.

789
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,259
It's okay.

790
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:50,529
The man who never thought about losing.

791
00:33:50,769 --> 00:33:52,670
The man crazy about winning, the crazily passionate man.

792
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:53,700
That man is KANG MINSEO.

793
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,869
(That man is KANG MINSEO.)

794
00:33:56,069 --> 00:33:57,309
That was nice.

795
00:33:57,309 --> 00:33:58,740
KENSHIN.

796
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:00,880
- ANDY and KENSHIN. Nice. - ANDY and KENSHIN.

797
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,309
- Let's go, KENSHIN. - Let's go, KENSHIN.

798
00:34:02,309 --> 00:34:03,680
- Let's go. - Let's go, ANDY.

00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,750
Let's go, ANDY.

00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,519
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors. - Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

801
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:09,090
(SAKURADA KENSHIN: paper, ANDY: paper)

802
00:34:09,289 --> 00:34:10,289
(Screaming)

803
00:34:10,789 --> 00:34:11,820
(Screaming)

804
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,590
(The first round is a tie.)

805
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,429
You scream when you draw, right?

806
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:19,059
- So... - The anxiety overwhelms you.

807
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:20,900
You hit when you win, and you scream when you're tied.

808
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,269
That's the game.

809
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:24,500
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors. - Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

810
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,000

00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,239
(Screaming)

812
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:32,139
(The second round is also a tie.)

813
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:33,679
Okay.

814
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,039
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

815
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:37,579
(The third round is a tie too.)

816
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:40,780
Go home.

817
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:43,219
- Until when will you play? - Rock-paper-scissors.

818
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,059
- Why? - Are they twins?

819
00:34:46,059 --> 00:34:47,820
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors. - Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

820
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,489
(SAKURADA KENSHIN: rock, ANDY: paper)

821
00:34:49,989 --> 00:34:51,090
ANDY.

822
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:53,400
(He succeeds in attacking.)

823
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,670
Okay.

824
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,769
- ANDY. - ANDY.

825
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,469
- Nice. - Yes.

826
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,039
- Well done. - Goodness.

827
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:05,239
- I'm sorry. - You did better than me.

828
00:35:05,309 --> 00:35:06,639
- I'm sorry. - You did better than me.

829
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:08,480
"I'm sorry." You did well.

830
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,750
- I'm sorry. - Well done, KENSHIN.

831
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,650
(It's time to eat sikhye and boiled eggs.)

832
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:16,150
I'm sorry.

833
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:18,690
Really.

834
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,760
- Can I do it? - Hurry.

835
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:24,559
It hurts more if you do it like that.

836
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:26,400
- How should I do it? - Just hit it hard.

837
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,400
(Hitting)

838
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,199
Eggs and sikhye are the standard food you eat at the sauna.

839
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:34,239
It's really delicious.

840
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:36,969
(The standard food tastes good too.)

841
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:40,440
(Eating)

842
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,409
(Eating)

843
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:48,119
(The sauna lovers get into the heat after eating.)

844
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:49,920
Go out.

845
00:35:50,019 --> 00:35:52,050
You know? This is salt.

846
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:54,159
- Yes. Salt? - Really.

847
00:35:54,289 --> 00:35:55,530
- Really? - Really.

848
00:35:56,329 --> 00:35:58,289
- You're lying. - It really is salt.

849
00:35:58,590 --> 00:35:59,630
What's this?

850
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:01,230
It's salty. It is salt.

851
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:03,369
Taste it.

852
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:06,840
(The claw machine lovers are spending away their money.)

853
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:08,239
Nice.

854
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:13,679
It's okay. He doesn't need it.

855
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,750
(The sports lovers digest the food.)

856
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,150
You're good.

857
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:21,219
We had fun today.

858
00:36:21,219 --> 00:36:22,719
Nice!

859
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:24,119
Nice.

860
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:26,659
All we did was practice in the training rooms.

861
00:36:26,659 --> 00:36:28,590
We were tired from the competitions.

862
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:29,889
This was a healing experience.

863
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,730
It feels like we became closer to each other.

864
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:34,159
Let's take a group picture...

865
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,900
and jump. Then we'll be in Paju.

866
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,929
(Stop, JIAHN.)

867
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:39,639
- No. - No.

868
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:41,239
We'll jump to the training rooms.

869
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:43,139
- Don't do that. - No.

870
00:36:43,139 --> 00:36:44,369
Don't do that.

871
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:45,739
Let's take a group picture.

872
00:36:46,309 --> 00:36:48,179
I'll take it. One, two, three.

873
00:36:48,579 --> 00:36:51,679
(They made lots of warm memories at the sauna outing.)

874
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:53,820
Next,

875
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,789
the team whose ranking will be announced...

876
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,690
Is it us?

877
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:00,320
I hope it's our team.

878
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,360
Will it continue right away?

879
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,230
is Team "Breaking News."

880
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,170
- is Team "Breaking News." - What?

881
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,769
All trainees in Team "Breaking News,"

882
00:37:12,769 --> 00:37:14,500
please come to the stage.

883
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,039
- It's too soon. - Okay.

884
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,639
Go and come back, HYUNWOO.

885
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:19,440
You want me to go and come back?

886
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:20,710
You want me to go and come back?

887
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:21,980
Go and go.

888
00:37:24,579 --> 00:37:27,250
(He's extremely sensitive.)

889
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,619
Go and go.

890
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:31,289
You're really mean.

891
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:33,289
How could you say that?

892
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:36,059
- Don't listen to that. - It's okay.

893
00:37:36,829 --> 00:37:38,730
Seriously.

894
00:37:38,829 --> 00:37:40,599
How could you say, "Go and come back?"

895
00:37:42,369 --> 00:37:44,300
He's trying to ruin me.

896
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:49,070
Team "Breaking News" presented an energetic stage...

897
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:51,369
with a stable live performance...

898
00:37:51,539 --> 00:37:54,780
that made many World Assemblers cheer out for them.

899
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,750
The team ranked third on the on-site voting.

900
00:38:00,849 --> 00:38:04,489
With the individual votes, Trainee AHN JUNWON...

901
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:06,360
took first place.

902
00:38:07,389 --> 00:38:09,159
(10th, AHN JUNWON, Week 6 ranking)

903
00:38:09,429 --> 00:38:10,860
That's cool.

904
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,599
The rank of the trainee who passed...

905
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:15,530
I really...

906
00:38:15,699 --> 00:38:18,730
hoped that at least half of us would survive.

907
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:21,400
There aren't enough spots...

908
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,769
for everyone to survive.

909
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:26,480
(15th, KANG MINSEO, Week 6 ranking)

910
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:29,010
The rank of the trainee who passed...

911
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,420
is 11th.

912
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,119
(3rd Passing Ceremony, 11th)

913
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:38,019
(The 11th-place trainee is to be revealed.)

914
00:38:38,219 --> 00:38:39,360
Eleventh?

915
00:38:41,289 --> 00:38:43,090
I'll give you a hint.

916
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,429
He is very different now than he was at the preliminary evaluation.

917
00:38:47,429 --> 00:38:48,730
- Goodness. - JUNWON.

918
00:38:49,699 --> 00:38:50,900
But...

919
00:38:50,969 --> 00:38:52,469
I'm the same.

920
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,739
I didn't die my hair and my hairstyle is the same.

921
00:38:56,769 --> 00:38:58,139
It could be HYUNWOO.

922
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,639
He's very different.

923
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:00,809
(He's very different.)

924
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:02,949
You look the most different.

925
00:39:02,949 --> 00:39:04,510
No.

926
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:06,380
YURA is the first in terms of change.

927
00:39:07,849 --> 00:39:10,389
- JUNWON changed a lot. - You're very different.

928
00:39:10,489 --> 00:39:11,920
I only lost some weight.

929
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,889
- It would be JUNWON. - Why are you calling me that?

930
00:39:14,389 --> 00:39:16,760
He had a different profession...

931
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:19,099
before joining "PROJECT 7."

932
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:20,300
That's right.

933
00:39:22,969 --> 00:39:26,440
But now, he's a trainee who is doing his best...

934
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,940
toward the dream of becoming an idol.

935
00:39:29,539 --> 00:39:30,769
You can wait over there.

936
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:33,710
We'll follow you.

937
00:39:34,139 --> 00:39:35,409
The trainee received...

938
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:40,579
a global voting score of 1,073,709 points.

939
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:42,920
According to the big data,

940
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,150
he took tenth place before,

941
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:47,760
so I thought JUNWON would be 11th place which is close.

942
00:39:47,889 --> 00:39:49,659
I didn't predict to get that ranking.

943
00:39:50,059 --> 00:39:51,989
It's the ranking I hoped for.

944
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:54,559
(3rd Passing Ceremony, 11th place)

945
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:55,800
Trainee AHN JUNWON.

946
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,300
(11th place, Trainee AHN JUNWON)

947
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,670
Trainee AHN JUNWON.

948
00:39:58,869 --> 00:40:00,670
Congratulations.

949
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,000
Congratulations.

950
00:40:02,869 --> 00:40:04,739
- JUNWON. - Well done.

951
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:05,909
Of course.

952
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,280
It's different when you put in an effort.

953
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,679
Victory.

954
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:14,019
From the moment Trainee AHN JUNWON was assembled...

955
00:40:14,019 --> 00:40:15,280
into Team "Breaking News,"

956
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,090
he told himself that he wouldn't sleep...

957
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:19,019
and stayed up until morning in the training room every day...

958
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:22,190
to practice. He also went to other trainees...

959
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,989
to learn how to dance.

960
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:27,329
He put in a lot of effort for this stage.

961
00:40:27,329 --> 00:40:28,699
(11th place, AHN JUNWON)

962
00:40:29,329 --> 00:40:30,429
The ranking...

963
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:35,000
of the trainee to be announced next...

964
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,769
Thirteenth.

965
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,110
Or 15th?

966
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:43,550
I thought it would be a ranking close to tenth.

967
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,349
Would there be spots left?

968
00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:46,420
Yes.

969
00:40:47,949 --> 00:40:50,050
is 17th place.

970
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:51,349
(The 17th-place trainee is to be revealed.)

971
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:52,590
That's a drop.

972
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:56,289
(3rd Passing Ceremony, 17th place)

973
00:41:00,829 --> 00:41:03,469
Seventeenth place?

974
00:41:04,269 --> 00:41:06,440
I hope 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th place would be us.

975
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,670
I know. I hope all five of us would be together.

976
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:11,170
(15th place, KANG MINSEO, Week 6 ranking)

977
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:14,179
I was 19th place last time. I don't think it's me.

978
00:41:14,539 --> 00:41:17,110
The trainee in 17th place...

979
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:21,079
is one of the trainees who brought out the charms of this song best.

980
00:41:22,349 --> 00:41:23,420
KANG HYUNWOO?

981
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,760
- Wouldn't it be MINSEO? - I think it's MINSEO.

982
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,119
Is it me or you?

983
00:41:29,889 --> 00:41:32,030
Whoever it is, one of us has to go.

984
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:36,670
In the previous Passing Ceremony, I was 14th place...

985
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:38,800
and MINSEO was 15th place.

986
00:41:38,969 --> 00:41:41,099
That's why I thought it would be either me...

987
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:43,139
or MINSEO.

988
00:41:43,369 --> 00:41:46,179
I thought I suited "Breaking News" well too.

989
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,980
I hoped it would be me.

990
00:41:52,349 --> 00:41:53,349
This is hard.

991
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:57,690
He went through complex feelings and shed some tears...

992
00:41:57,719 --> 00:42:00,820
while going through the previous stage.

993
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:02,760
(The trainee who shed tears in the previous project)

994
00:42:02,789 --> 00:42:04,659
He went through complex feelings...

995
00:42:04,659 --> 00:42:06,130
and shed some tears.

996
00:42:10,269 --> 00:42:11,300
It's HYUNWOO.

997
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:15,070
We got to know.

998
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:17,639
It's over.

999
00:42:17,739 --> 00:42:20,880
From the expressions he used,

1000
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,849
I could tell...

1001
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:25,550
that it was me.

1002
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:27,079
It's time my name gets called.

1003
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:29,349
The trainee received...

1004
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:34,989
a global voting score of 787,197 points.

1005
00:42:37,289 --> 00:42:41,130
Trainee KANG HYUNWOO. Congratulations.

1006
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:42,360
(17th place, Trainee KANG HYUNWOO)

1007
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,530
Congratulations.

1008
00:42:43,969 --> 00:42:45,699
He's cool.

1009
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:47,500
He wouldn't be able to come back.

1010
00:42:48,369 --> 00:42:50,840
Trainee KANG HYUNWOO found a perfect song for him...

1011
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,940
in this original match...

1012
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:55,309
and showed his best performance.

1013
00:42:56,449 --> 00:42:58,949
We'll keep watching him...

1014
00:42:59,449 --> 00:43:02,119
to see if he will be able to debut...

1015
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:03,550
through the final project.

1016
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:06,789
The passing trainee...

1017
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:08,719
to be announced next...

1018
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:13,559
If I'm 17th place,

1019
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:16,400
there wouldn't be many spots left for other members of our team...

1020
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,599
to take.

1021
00:43:18,099 --> 00:43:20,269
I thought it could be quite risky.

1022
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:22,340
I was 15th place, but my ranking could have dropped...

1023
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:25,610
to be about 18th place or 19th place.

1024
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:28,239
I can't predict the rankings at all.

1025
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:29,510
They were all turned around.

1026
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:33,250
There...

1027
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:35,719
Eighteenth.

1028
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:38,190
Don't tell me...

1029
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:42,829
(There...)

1030
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:43,889
is no trainee who passed.

1031
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:48,260
There is no trainee who passed.

1032
00:43:51,269 --> 00:43:52,369
There is no trainee who passed.

1033
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,039
No way. Hold on.

1034
00:43:57,739 --> 00:44:01,710
(15th place, KANG MINSEO, Week 6 ranking)

1035
00:44:02,409 --> 00:44:03,449
What?

1036
00:44:03,809 --> 00:44:05,650
I thought it could really go bad.

1037
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:07,619
Will I be going home?

1038
00:44:08,449 --> 00:44:11,349
MINSEO could be 7th place, a candidate for debut,

1039
00:44:12,789 --> 00:44:14,019
or in 21st place.

1040
00:44:16,789 --> 00:44:19,030
It was really unexpected.

1041
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:21,829
I was very baffled at that moment.

1042
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:23,829
How low did I drop?

1043
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:26,070
Does that make sense?

1044
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,800
He was 15th place or something.

1045
00:44:30,409 --> 00:44:31,769
Trainee KANG MINSEO.

1046
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,440
Yes?

1047
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:38,750
- Yes. - You haven't been called out yet.

1048
00:44:39,449 --> 00:44:41,179
Do you think your name will be called?

1049
00:44:41,719 --> 00:44:44,719
Actually, I think I'm having a mental breakdown right now.

1050
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:47,420
My ranking kept going down.

1051
00:44:47,889 --> 00:44:51,059
So I also don't know...

1052
00:44:51,059 --> 00:44:53,059
what will happen.

1053
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:57,570
We still have more rankings to be announced,

1054
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:59,840
so don't lose hope yet.

1055
00:45:01,639 --> 00:45:04,039
MINSEO was eliminated?

1056
00:45:05,539 --> 00:45:06,780
I would be eliminated too.

1057
00:45:10,449 --> 00:45:11,610
The results changed too much.

1058
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:15,880
I think I really grew...

1059
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:19,050
through this mission.

1060
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,360
I really thank the members of Team "Breaking News..."

1061
00:45:23,889 --> 00:45:25,860
for helping and guiding me to grow so much.

1062
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:30,300
JIAHN, YONGHYUN, MINSEO, KOTARO, YURA,

1063
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,730
and HYUNWOO who is next to me.

1064
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,199
I really thank them so much.

1065
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:37,809
The announcement of the results isn't over yet.

1066
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:42,210
I still want to have hope.

1067
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:46,250
I'll continue...

1068
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:49,349
to show you my best.

1069
00:45:49,349 --> 00:45:50,349
Thank you.

1070
00:45:50,889 --> 00:45:52,389
I was ranked 7th place in the individual ranking...

1071
00:45:52,389 --> 00:45:54,289
after this round ended.

1072
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:57,230
I thought,

1073
00:45:57,230 --> 00:45:59,190
"It's done now."

1074
00:46:00,059 --> 00:46:01,460
I tried to collect my thoughts again...

1075
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:04,869
before coming to this recording today.

1076
00:46:05,969 --> 00:46:08,269
There are people who still support me.

1077
00:46:08,269 --> 00:46:10,010
If I gave up first,

1078
00:46:10,969 --> 00:46:13,940
it wouldn't be right for them.

1079
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:16,250
I came to PROJECT 7...

1080
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:18,449
not to give up on myself.

1081
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,550
I pulled myself together a lot...

1082
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:24,619
because I had become very weak.

1083
00:46:24,989 --> 00:46:26,820
The destination could be very far...

1084
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,860
and I might not reach there with my feet.

1085
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:32,960
But I will not fall down and give up on my own.

1086
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:35,199
I'll do my best until the end.

1087
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:38,730
He's amazing.

1088
00:46:40,469 --> 00:46:41,469
That's impressive.

1089
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:46,780
(Ranking of Team "Breaking News" was announced.)

1090
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:51,409
Hey.

1091
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:54,619
- What's happening? - I might be going home.

1092
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:56,889
- I have to go home. - No.

1093
00:47:02,889 --> 00:47:05,860
It's difficult to be among the last 21 people.

1094
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:09,730
This was really not what I imagined.

1095
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:13,440
Among the 21 seats,

1096
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,469
five seats have been filled.

1097
00:47:16,909 --> 00:47:20,510
How many members would be passing in the next team?

1098
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,780
Please keep watching.

1099
00:47:23,309 --> 00:47:24,480
Five seats.

1100
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,480
It's hard to predict.

1101
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:30,019
I'll call out the team...

1102
00:47:30,019 --> 00:47:31,219
whose results will be announced next.

1103
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:33,789
Let's go. It would be us.

1104
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:37,730
"KOOL-AID."

1105
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:39,800
It's Team "KOOL-AID."

1106
00:47:42,929 --> 00:47:44,699
- I'll get going. - I'll face it

1107
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:47,300
See you, ATILA.

1108
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:49,469
- I'll get going. - Bye.

1109
00:47:49,469 --> 00:47:50,639
Go and come back.

1110
00:47:50,769 --> 00:47:51,969
I won't come back.

1111
00:47:53,809 --> 00:47:55,480
Team "KOOL-AID" had many trainees...

1112
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,579
of lower ranks.

1113
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:59,619
But they showed the World Assemblers...

1114
00:47:59,619 --> 00:48:01,650
a cute and refreshing stage...

1115
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:03,449
and made them smile.

1116
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:07,420
Unfortunately, they didn't receive the team benefit.

1117
00:48:08,289 --> 00:48:11,659
Trainee KIM JEONGMIN ranked first within the team...

1118
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:15,900
and received benefit points.

1119
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:20,400
I'll announce the trainees who passed...

1120
00:48:21,139 --> 00:48:23,670
in Team "KOOL-AID."

1121
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:25,510
I'm nervous.

1122
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:27,340
(32nd place, LEE GUNWOO, 31st place, CHAE HEEJU)

1123
00:48:27,639 --> 00:48:29,539
The rank of the first trainee of Team "KOOL-AID..."

1124
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:34,880
who will experience the joy of passing...

1125
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,019
I hope I'm in 21st place.

1126
00:48:37,019 --> 00:48:38,389
(23rd place, KIM JEONGMIN, Week 8 ranking)

1127
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:40,659
You're 20th place.

1128
00:48:41,059 --> 00:48:42,360
I think it's possible.

1129
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,559
is 18th place.

1130
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:47,260
(The 18th-place trainee is to be revealed.)

1131
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:48,329
Eighteenth place.

1132
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,739
Let me give you a hint about this trainee.

1133
00:48:56,239 --> 00:48:58,139
He has a fun and positive energy.

1134
00:48:58,639 --> 00:49:01,710
He brings up the mood of the team.

1135
00:49:03,449 --> 00:49:04,849
- It's KIM JEONGMIN. - It's JEONGMIN.

1136
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:08,820
It must be SIHUN.

1137
00:49:09,989 --> 00:49:12,050
- SIHUN? - Or...

1138
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:14,119
- SIHUN... - JEONGMIN.

1139
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:15,889
Would SIHUN be among the top ten?

1140
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:18,030
I think this is you.

1141
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:19,159
Me?

1142
00:49:21,159 --> 00:49:22,230
JOOHYUN?

1143
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,429
- I should be eighteenth. - Eighteenth.

1144
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:31,110
He also shed some tears from the harsh practice.

1145
00:49:34,579 --> 00:49:36,449
- Bye. - It might not be me.

1146
00:49:36,449 --> 00:49:37,449
You're the only one.

1147
00:49:38,679 --> 00:49:39,679
(23rd place, KIM JEONGMIN, Week 8 ranking)

1148
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:41,449
I normally don't cry...

1149
00:49:42,349 --> 00:49:43,889
except when talking to my mom.

1150
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:46,219
But SIHUN cried as well, didn't he?

1151
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,659
Goodness.

1152
00:49:48,659 --> 00:49:50,090
(9th place, KIM SIHUN, Week 6 ranking)

1153
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:51,489
Seriously.

1154
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,630
(31rd place, CHAE HEEJU, Week 6 ranking)

1155
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:56,670
I...

1156
00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:01,699
(The three trainees shed their tears.)

1157
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:03,369
Eighteenth place.

1158
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:05,309
I kept thinking,

1159
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,840
"Would the 50,000 benefit points..."

1160
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,679
"bring up my rank?"

1161
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:12,550
I thought I could have...

1162
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:14,119
a bit of hope.

1163
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:15,750
This trainee received...

1164
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:21,289
a global voting score of 778,198 points.

1165
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:28,230
Trainee KIM JEONGMIN. Congratulations.

1166
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:29,230
(18th place, Trainee KIM JEONGMIN)

1167
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:31,099
- Go. - It's such a relief.

1168
00:50:31,099 --> 00:50:32,829
- Congratulations. - Well done.

1169
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:37,210
It's a triumphal achievement.

1170
00:50:38,909 --> 00:50:42,679
Trainee KIM JEONGMIN showed us better rap skills...

1171
00:50:42,679 --> 00:50:43,980
and dancing skills...

1172
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:46,480
and appeared as an all-rounder.

1173
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,349
He's a trainee who captivates the eyes and ears...

1174
00:50:50,349 --> 00:50:52,519
of the World Assemblers...

1175
00:50:52,519 --> 00:50:55,659
by showing a cute side of him that wasn't seen on the stage.

1176
00:50:57,130 --> 00:50:58,130
Ladies.

1177
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,699
The trainee who passed...

1178
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,900
who I'll announce next...

1179
00:51:04,699 --> 00:51:06,769
At least one more.

1180
00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:10,269
I had hopes...

1181
00:51:10,269 --> 00:51:11,469
that there would be more.

1182
00:51:11,469 --> 00:51:13,880
When he announced the 18th rank,

1183
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:15,179
I had a bad feeling.

1184
00:51:15,179 --> 00:51:17,050
I had the feeling that there might not be more.

1185
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:19,409
Wouldn't there be at least one more?

1186
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:22,079
There should be at least one more.

1187
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,289
I really hoped...

1188
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:26,090
that a miracle will happen.

1189
00:51:26,789 --> 00:51:28,059
The trainee who passed...

1190
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:31,090
There are none.

1191
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:34,900
Please.

1192
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:37,170
There are none.

1193
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:39,570
(There's no additional trainee who passed.)

1194
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:41,670
There are none.

1195
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:43,670
- What? - Seriously?

1196
00:51:44,139 --> 00:51:45,139
There are none.

1197
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:49,039
None of them?

1198
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:53,050
There are none.

1199
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:04,829
This is wrong.

1200
00:52:05,829 --> 00:52:07,760
It was really cruel.

1201
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:11,070
I was the only one who moved up,

1202
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:12,400
so I felt terrible for them.

1203
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:14,800
It was very sad.

1204
00:52:17,909 --> 00:52:19,139
ATILLA.

1205
00:52:20,909 --> 00:52:22,880
This is really harsh.

1206
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:29,150
Let's hear from the trainee who passed.

1207
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:31,989
- His ranking increased. - JEONGMIN's ranking increased.

1208
00:52:31,989 --> 00:52:33,090
It increased a lot.

1209
00:52:33,889 --> 00:52:36,320
I could rise to this high place...

1210
00:52:37,989 --> 00:52:39,329
all thanks to...

1211
00:52:40,059 --> 00:52:42,130
World Assemblers...

1212
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:46,030
and my fellow members of Team "KOOL-AID."

1213
00:52:46,969 --> 00:52:50,210
I'm the only one who moved up,

1214
00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:53,039
so I'd like to apologize.

1215
00:52:58,409 --> 00:52:59,480
Yes.

1216
00:53:04,119 --> 00:53:06,119
I'll work hard. Thank you.

1217
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:09,889
Work hard.

1218
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:15,230
Before I announce the next trainee in rank,

1219
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:16,969
there's another video...

1220
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,039
that the trainees prepared for World Assemblers.

1221
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:22,469
We'll watch the video...

1222
00:53:22,469 --> 00:53:25,110
before I continue with the announcement.

1223
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:27,380
- Two, three. - Two, three.

1224
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:29,039
(Let's watch it now!)

1225
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:34,150
(The clear sky and the wide-open sea)

1226
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:35,849
We're on Wolmi Island!

1227
00:53:36,019 --> 00:53:37,989
To catch fish

1228
00:53:37,989 --> 00:53:40,159
- Shall we go to the sea? - Shall we go to the sea?

1229
00:53:40,289 --> 00:53:42,159
- To catch fish - To catch fish

1230
00:53:42,159 --> 00:53:43,960
- Shall we go to the sea? - Shall we go to the sea?

1231
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,489
PROJECT 7 is...

1232
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:46,860
on Wolmi Island.

1233
00:53:48,699 --> 00:53:50,869
- We're on Wolmi Island. - It's the sea.

1234
00:53:50,869 --> 00:53:52,170
This is fascinating.

1235
00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:54,940
Hello.

1236
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:57,570
(They're energetic because it's their first outing.)

1237
00:53:57,739 --> 00:53:59,110
Do you know why you're here today?

1238
00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:01,579
- To have fun. - We came here to have fun.

1239
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,409
- For the Viking Ride. - To travel on our own.

1240
00:54:03,409 --> 00:54:04,480
For a relaxing trip.

1241
00:54:04,809 --> 00:54:06,920
Today, you'll be split into two teams.

1242
00:54:07,550 --> 00:54:08,650
Is it another team competition?

1243
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:11,690
You'll have fun while competing with each other.

1244
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:15,159
Why don't team captains decide?

1245
00:54:15,159 --> 00:54:16,289
That's a good idea.

1246
00:54:16,289 --> 00:54:17,329
- That sounds great. - Team captains decide?

1247
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,289
Either JEONGMIN or SEYUN can play...

1248
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:20,800
against KYOUNGBAE to split us into teams.

1249
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,159
That sounds good.

1250
00:54:22,199 --> 00:54:23,670
Since you're more like a baby, you do it.

1251
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:25,329
Since you're more like a baby, you do it.

1252
00:54:25,329 --> 00:54:26,639
Yes, babies should compete.

1253
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:29,400
(The team captains will pick the teammates.)

1254
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,869
Get ready, go.

1255
00:54:30,969 --> 00:54:32,769
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Isn't that it?

1256
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:33,909
Rock-paper-scissors.

1257
00:54:33,909 --> 00:54:35,039
(He loses, and he wins.)

1258
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:36,710
First, I'll pick the comedian of the group.

1259
00:54:37,309 --> 00:54:38,710
First, I'll pick the comedian of the group.

1260
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:41,480
(He picks Trainee KANG HYUNWOO who's funny.)

1261
00:54:41,619 --> 00:54:44,190
We'd have enough video if I go on rides with HANBIN.

1262
00:54:44,349 --> 00:54:46,050
- Pick HANBIN. - I pick HANBIN.

1263
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:47,289
(He chooses Trainee LEE HANBIN.)

1264
00:54:47,289 --> 00:54:49,260
- I pick HANBIN. - Okay.

1265
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:50,730
I like SEYUN.

1266
00:54:51,489 --> 00:54:53,559
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1267
00:54:53,659 --> 00:54:55,099
Okay, I pick YOUNGSEO.

1268
00:54:55,099 --> 00:54:56,500
- Okay. - YOUNGSEO.

1269
00:54:56,599 --> 00:54:57,800
I pick JIWOON.

1270
00:54:58,030 --> 00:55:00,440
- I was going to pick him. - Goodness.

1271
00:55:00,639 --> 00:55:02,440
- I pick GUNWOO. - Okay.

1272
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:04,670
- Welcome, GUNWOO. - We need someone smart.

1273
00:55:05,269 --> 00:55:06,880
- JEONGMIN. - Okay.

1274
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,409
- This is good. - I like it.

1275
00:55:08,739 --> 00:55:09,840
- Go ahead. - I pick JOONWOO.

1276
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,280
- Okay. - Okay.

1277
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,780
- I pick HAJOON. - Yes.

1278
00:55:13,949 --> 00:55:15,119
- I pick HAJOON. - Yes.

1279
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:16,619
You hurt my feelings. Forget it.

1280
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:18,190
- All right. - Go away.

1281
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:19,750
Let's do this so that no one gets offended.

1282
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:21,019
- The loser takes JAEWON. - The loser takes him.

1283
00:55:21,019 --> 00:55:22,119
Okay.

1284
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:23,559
The loser should take him.

1285
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:25,260
- The winner should take him. - It's good for the loser.

1286
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:27,230
- The winner should take him. - Let us take him.

1287
00:55:27,230 --> 00:55:29,099
- JAEWON is like a present. - Right.

1288
00:55:29,099 --> 00:55:30,730
Rock-paper-scissors.

1289
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:32,369
Rock-paper-scissors.

1290
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:33,940
(Trainee JUNG SEYUN wins.)

1291
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:35,440
Why did you lose only now?

1292
00:55:35,869 --> 00:55:38,610
- Take him. - Hey.

1293
00:55:38,869 --> 00:55:40,139
- Okay. - Okay.

1294
00:55:40,139 --> 00:55:41,510
He got offended from the start.

1295
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:42,639
Let's go.

1296
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:44,849
- We have one more member. - What is...

1297
00:55:44,849 --> 00:55:45,949
our mission today?

1298
00:55:49,619 --> 00:55:52,789
(They head to the amusement park for the competition.)

1299
00:55:56,219 --> 00:55:57,730
Let's go.

1300
00:55:59,989 --> 00:56:01,260
It's really an amusement park.

1301
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:04,869
(They dress up cute with must-have items at amusement parks.)

1302
00:56:04,869 --> 00:56:07,000
- You look pretty going in. - We're at an amusement park.

1303
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,070
I feel excited.

1304
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:10,000
Disco Pang Pang is the scariest.

1305
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:12,539
You'll get on Disco Pang Pang.

1306
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:13,880
- Yes. - Really?

1307
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:16,010
- The last one to stay on wins? - How?

1308
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:17,079
Try not to fall off?

1309
00:56:17,079 --> 00:56:19,250
I'll be the last one to stay on, and my team will win.

1310
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,380
Anyone of you can stay out of it.

1311
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:22,219
You won't win because you're the last one to stay on.

1312
00:56:22,219 --> 00:56:23,519
- Really? - Mr. Rabbit.

1313
00:56:26,119 --> 00:56:27,820
(The team with more members who stay on will win.)

1314
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:28,920
No.

1315
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,090
No.

1316
00:56:31,590 --> 00:56:34,230
Five from each team will get on the ride except JAEWON.

1317
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:36,400
Okay, that sounds good.

1318
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,030
I've never gotten on this ride.

1319
00:56:38,030 --> 00:56:39,329
(Excited)

1320
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:40,869
Go on.

1321
00:56:40,969 --> 00:56:43,809
(SEYUN's team gets on first.)

1322
00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:47,110
- My goodness. - Really?

1323
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:49,139
- Is that really playing right now? - Goodness.

1324
00:56:49,309 --> 00:56:50,980
- Hurry up. - Let's go.

1325
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:54,050
Should we hold onto each other to stay on?

1326
00:56:54,050 --> 00:56:55,980
- Shall we try this? Okay. - Shall we?

1327
00:56:56,849 --> 00:56:57,920
(HANBIN and JIWOON hug each other.)

1328
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,590
Get away from each other.

1329
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,159
I'm nervous.

1330
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:04,530
(They make a fuss even with a small movement.)

1331
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:06,690
HANBIN.

1332
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:08,099
Tell us how to hold on.

1333
00:57:08,099 --> 00:57:09,760
- Hold onto it like this. - It's not working.

1334
00:57:10,599 --> 00:57:13,500
(If you don't understand, we'll show you with the ride.)

1335
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:16,739
(Dangling)

1336
00:57:20,909 --> 00:57:23,139
Don't fall off.

1337
00:57:23,139 --> 00:57:24,179
(The younger members look stable.)

1338
00:57:24,949 --> 00:57:27,320
- Hold on. Wait a minute. - Goodness.

1339
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:28,780
- Are you okay? - Wait a minute.

1340
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:30,190
What are they doing?

1341
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:31,219
(You're embarrassing yourself as the eldest member.)

1342
00:57:32,090 --> 00:57:33,090
Look at him.

1343
00:57:33,090 --> 00:57:34,690
- Where are you going? - Your position...

1344
00:57:35,019 --> 00:57:36,320
That's very...

1345
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:37,630
- No. - He's barely hanging on.

1346
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:38,889
- HANBIN. - HANBIN.

1347
00:57:40,329 --> 00:57:42,400
(Climbing onto Disco Pang Pang)

1348
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,460
Stop it!

1349
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:46,469
That's it for the sneak peek.

1350
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:47,670
"Sneak peek?"

1351
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:48,739
- Shall we get started? - It was a sneak peek?

1352
00:57:48,739 --> 00:57:51,110
- Oh, no. - Look straight ahead.

1353
00:57:51,110 --> 00:57:53,070
(Here comes the real ride.)

1354
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:57,480
(Disco Pang Pang is spinning fast.)

1355
00:58:00,679 --> 00:58:02,849
Do you see the look on HANBIN's face?

1356
00:58:02,849 --> 00:58:03,849
(Yelping)

1357
00:58:03,849 --> 00:58:05,019
They're hanging on.

1358
00:58:05,019 --> 00:58:06,150
Hang in there.

1359
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:07,789
They're going to fall off.

1360
00:58:07,989 --> 00:58:10,360
Hang in there.

1361
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:11,730
My goodness.

1362
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:13,829
- Gosh. - Let's do it.

1363
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:19,170
Oh, no!

1364
00:58:20,269 --> 00:58:21,570
No.

1365
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:23,940
- HANBIN. - What are you doing?

1366
00:58:24,039 --> 00:58:25,239
Aren't you embarrassed...

1367
00:58:25,539 --> 00:58:26,940
in front of younger members?

1368
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:28,139
The bottom.

1369
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:31,710
(They hang on firmly despite the attack.)

1370
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:36,349
Well done. The next group will get on the ride.

1371
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:38,590
It's downhill.

1372
00:58:38,619 --> 00:58:40,789
- Goodness. - That was fun.

1373
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:43,190
Did they endure it?

1374
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:44,489
(All 5 members on SEYUN's team survived.)

1375
00:58:46,659 --> 00:58:49,530
I told you that I didn't want to ride it. I lost my voice.

1376
00:58:50,699 --> 00:58:52,000
(Next up is KYOUNGBAE's team.)

1377
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,469
My goodness.

1378
00:58:53,469 --> 00:58:54,570
This is scary.

1379
00:58:54,969 --> 00:58:56,000
Good luck.

1380
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,409
(Their tactic is locking their arms with each other.)

1381
00:58:57,409 --> 00:58:59,070
- Me too. - Hold onto my arm.

1382
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:02,039
Here we go.

1383
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:04,480
- Hold on. - Goodness.

1384
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,179
No.

1385
00:59:07,519 --> 00:59:10,420
(KYOUNGBAE's team holds onto each other tightly.)

1386
00:59:10,889 --> 00:59:12,489
Oh, no.

1387
00:59:12,489 --> 00:59:14,960
(Hold on tight!)

1388
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,619
At least one of them...

1389
00:59:17,130 --> 00:59:18,730
At least one of them should fall off.

1390
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,599
- Nice. - Will they hold on?

1391
00:59:24,429 --> 00:59:26,030
- No. - I'm sorry,

1392
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:27,440
but you might tear off his pants.

1393
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:30,409
- He's holding onto his pants. - My pants.

1394
00:59:30,710 --> 00:59:31,969
Look at him holding onto his pants.

1395
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:33,170
He's going to fall off.

1396
00:59:34,309 --> 00:59:36,840
- No. - Here we go again.

1397
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:40,849
- All right. - Oh, my.

1398
00:59:41,150 --> 00:59:42,320
Well done.

1399
00:59:46,389 --> 00:59:49,059
(Trainee SEO KYOUNGBAE ends up letting go.)

1400
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:52,730
All right. This time...

1401
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:54,360
(Falling off)

1402
00:59:54,429 --> 00:59:56,030
All right.

1403
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,940
(3 of them are eliminated in 1 go.)

1404
01:00:03,039 --> 01:00:05,309
You should help them up. What are you doing over there?

1405
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:06,869
Help them up.

1406
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:09,139
He's looking away.

1407
01:00:09,139 --> 01:00:10,880
- You should help them up. - He's looking away.

1408
01:00:11,409 --> 01:00:14,050
(The younger members are rolling on the floor.)

1409
01:00:14,849 --> 01:00:17,550
(I'm sorry, but I have to survive.)

1410
01:00:17,550 --> 01:00:19,949
All right, that's it for the ride.

1411
01:00:20,090 --> 01:00:23,159
Please get off the ride safely in order.

1412
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:24,960
- Are you okay? - Well done, everyone.

1413
01:00:25,389 --> 01:00:26,929
What? We didn't fall off.

1414
01:00:26,929 --> 01:00:29,059
- Good job, everyone. - You may get off.

1415
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:31,170
- We didn't fall off. - Good job, everyone.

1416
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:32,329
You may get off.

1417
01:00:33,329 --> 01:00:35,800
(SEYUN's team wins Disco Pang Pang.)

1418
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:42,239
(The second game is a speed quiz on the Viking Ride.)

1419
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:46,409
(The team to answer first wins.)

1420
01:00:47,650 --> 01:00:51,190
(The ride continues until they get the right answer.)

1421
01:00:51,889 --> 01:00:53,219
We're going up.

1422
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,619
(I don't want to go.)

1423
01:00:56,090 --> 01:00:57,730
Coward cat, come here.

1424
01:00:57,730 --> 01:00:58,960
- There he goes again. - Come here.

1425
01:00:59,659 --> 01:01:01,329
- Why you... - Go.

1426
01:01:01,329 --> 01:01:02,800
- Captain SEYUN. - Come here.

1427
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:04,800
You look quite sad from the back today.

1428
01:01:05,230 --> 01:01:06,699
- Let's answer them all. - Seriously.

1429
01:01:06,699 --> 01:01:08,599
(SEYUN's team gets on the Viking first.)

1430
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:11,309
- SEYUN, say loudly. - We can do it.

1431
01:01:11,309 --> 01:01:12,309
Okay.

1432
01:01:12,409 --> 01:01:13,980
- I heard that this was... - Right.

1433
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:15,880
the scariest Viking Ride in Korea.

1434
01:01:16,510 --> 01:01:18,449
(The Viking Ride starts.)

1435
01:01:18,449 --> 01:01:20,480
- Don't cry. - I'm a little scared.

1436
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,250
- Wait, this is too loose. - It's loose.

1437
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:24,449
- It's moving. - That's normal.

1438
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:26,619
- This is no big deal. - You won't die.

1439
01:01:27,489 --> 01:01:29,059
JIWOON, please save me.

1440
01:01:29,389 --> 01:01:30,690
It's starting.

1441
01:01:30,690 --> 01:01:32,090
(The Viking starts to accelerate.)

1442
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:35,929
- It goes up very high. - How will we ride that?

1443
01:01:37,170 --> 01:01:38,929
(The Viking keeps going up.)

1444
01:01:40,469 --> 01:01:42,269
(The quiz starts.)

1445
01:01:43,769 --> 01:01:45,440
(KANG HYUNWOO)

1446
01:01:45,969 --> 01:01:47,210
Nutria.

1447
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:49,539
- Nutria. - KANG HYUNWOO.

1448
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:51,880
(Nutria)

1449
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:52,880
Goodness.

1450
01:01:53,610 --> 01:01:55,750
It's our song.

1451
01:01:55,849 --> 01:01:57,019
"RUN."

1452
01:01:57,019 --> 01:01:58,050
"RUN."

1453
01:01:58,420 --> 01:01:59,420
"Time After Time."

1454
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:00,460
(Screaming)

1455
01:02:01,090 --> 01:02:02,760
"Time After Time."

1456
01:02:03,619 --> 01:02:04,829
This is...

1457
01:02:04,829 --> 01:02:05,829
He already answered.

1458
01:02:05,829 --> 01:02:06,960
JIWOON got it.

1459
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,900
- "Time After Time." - Our fans.

1460
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:10,099
Our fans.

1461
01:02:10,099 --> 01:02:11,130
(World Assembler)

1462
01:02:11,130 --> 01:02:12,230
- "Time After Time." - Our fans.

1463
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:13,570
(Our fans...)

1464
01:02:13,570 --> 01:02:14,670
(Our fans!)

1465
01:02:16,139 --> 01:02:17,409
- World... - Goodness.

1466
01:02:17,710 --> 01:02:20,110
World Assembler.

1467
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:21,510
That's correct.

1468
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:23,539
Something that you make in the winter.

1469
01:02:23,539 --> 01:02:25,150
Something that you make in the winter.

1470
01:02:25,150 --> 01:02:26,250
You make it with snow.

1471
01:02:27,079 --> 01:02:29,349
(What's something that you make in the winter?)

1472
01:02:29,349 --> 01:02:31,019
Memories.

1473
01:02:31,150 --> 01:02:32,349
Something that you make in the winter.

1474
01:02:32,690 --> 01:02:34,289
Something that you make in the winter!

1475
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:35,559
Memories!

1476
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:36,820
Memories.

1477
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:44,030
Look at JIWOON crouching like this.

1478
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:46,429
Memories!

1479
01:02:46,599 --> 01:02:47,739
Memories.

1480
01:02:48,170 --> 01:02:49,269
Memories.

1481
01:02:49,269 --> 01:02:51,110
(They must answer all questions before getting off.)

1482
01:02:53,110 --> 01:02:54,309
Answer it, please!

1483
01:02:54,309 --> 01:02:56,079
(Answer it, please!)

1484
01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:58,010
- Please save me. - Answer it.

1485
01:02:58,510 --> 01:02:59,550
Hey!

1486
01:02:59,550 --> 01:03:01,849
(We can only hear them screaming.)

1487
01:03:02,219 --> 01:03:03,849
Something that you make in the winter.

1488
01:03:03,849 --> 01:03:05,519
I don't know.

1489
01:03:06,050 --> 01:03:07,050
(I don't know.)

1490
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:10,760
Call out "snowman."

1491
01:03:11,530 --> 01:03:13,289
Snowman.

1492
01:03:13,389 --> 01:03:14,829
- Snowman? - I'm scared.

1493
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:17,030
- Snowman. - Snowman.

1494
01:03:17,030 --> 01:03:18,070
(Help us.)

1495
01:03:18,070 --> 01:03:19,199
(Wolmi Island)

1496
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:21,539
- It's this place. - It's here.

1497
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:22,769
Wolmi Island.

1498
01:03:22,869 --> 01:03:24,039
Wolmi Island.

1499
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:29,210
It's what HANBIN and I sing.

1500
01:03:29,210 --> 01:03:30,440
Goodness.

1501
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:31,510
"Jealousy."

1502
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:32,510
(Correct)

1503
01:03:32,849 --> 01:03:34,250
Something that you drink in the winter.

1504
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:36,619
- A hot drink. - Green tea.

1505
01:03:36,619 --> 01:03:38,050
You drink it with marshmallows.

1506
01:03:38,050 --> 01:03:40,659
- JTBC. - Stop the ride!

1507
01:03:40,719 --> 01:03:41,989
JTBC.

1508
01:03:41,989 --> 01:03:43,190
(- JTBC. - Stop the ride!)

1509
01:03:43,489 --> 01:03:45,730
It's a drink.

1510
01:03:45,730 --> 01:03:47,030
I'm about to throw up.

1511
01:03:47,030 --> 01:03:48,699
- I can't do it. - It's a hot drink.

1512
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,170
JTBC, please stop the ride.

1513
01:03:51,170 --> 01:03:53,000
It's a drink!

1514
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,039
(The one who explains explodes in anger.)

1515
01:03:54,039 --> 01:03:55,300
Why are you calling JTBC?

1516
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:56,400
I really can't do it.

1517
01:03:57,340 --> 01:03:58,940
Hot chocolate.

1518
01:03:59,110 --> 01:04:00,210
Hot chocolate.

1519
01:04:00,210 --> 01:04:01,710
Aren't we going down?

1520
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:03,210
(The game is finally over.)

1521
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:05,409
- Good job. - It's over.

1522
01:04:05,409 --> 01:04:06,409
(SEYUN's team: 2 minutes 46 seconds)

1523
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,420
Look how messy HANBIN's hair is.

1524
01:04:09,050 --> 01:04:12,190
(The trainees looked nice and neat in the beginning.)

1525
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:14,190
We have one left.

1526
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:15,889
(They look very sloppy now.)

1527
01:04:15,889 --> 01:04:16,920
I feel dizzy.

1528
01:04:17,630 --> 01:04:19,190
- HANBIN, let's sit here. - Are we sitting in the back?

1529
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:20,860
- Wait, sit in the back? - Let's get on here.

1530
01:04:21,630 --> 01:04:22,900
Please come back alive.

1531
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:23,929
Good luck.

1532
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:26,400
Will the quiz start when we reach the peak?

1533
01:04:26,929 --> 01:04:28,099
No way.

1534
01:04:28,099 --> 01:04:29,099
Here we go.

1535
01:04:29,099 --> 01:04:30,769
- Can you read that? - Seriously.

1536
01:04:31,570 --> 01:04:33,739
(The game starts.)

1537
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:36,380
(White)

1538
01:04:36,809 --> 01:04:38,980
- It's a type of color. - It's one of the achromatic colors.

1539
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:40,449
YOUNGSEO, the color of your sweatshirt.

1540
01:04:40,449 --> 01:04:41,449
- An achromatic color. - White.

1541
01:04:41,449 --> 01:04:42,550
In three syllables.

1542
01:04:42,719 --> 01:04:44,289
- White. - Okay.

1543
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:46,619
(Position Matching)

1544
01:04:46,619 --> 01:04:50,059
- It was our second project. - Our second mission.

1545
01:04:50,059 --> 01:04:51,860
- Position Matching. - Position Matching.

1546
01:04:52,159 --> 01:04:54,730
- Hooray. - I hate this.

1547
01:04:55,030 --> 01:04:56,199
Hooray.

1548
01:04:56,199 --> 01:04:57,869
(Excited, scared)

1549
01:04:58,599 --> 01:04:59,969
(Idol singer)

1550
01:05:00,099 --> 01:05:02,800
- It's what we're doing. - It's our occupation.

1551
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,170
- Idol singer. - Idol singer.

1552
01:05:04,170 --> 01:05:05,170
Idol singer.

1553
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:07,579
We just... What is it?

1554
01:05:07,579 --> 01:05:09,739
- Ramyeon. - Kalguksu.

1555
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:12,510
- It's this. What type of ramyeon? - What type of ramyeon?

1556
01:05:12,510 --> 01:05:14,050
Cup noodles.

1557
01:05:14,050 --> 01:05:16,480
- Our last ride. - The first ride we got on.

1558
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:17,719
Disco Pang Pang.

1559
01:05:17,719 --> 01:05:19,389
Which season are we in now?

1560
01:05:19,389 --> 01:05:21,619
- Winter. - Winter.

1561
01:05:21,619 --> 01:05:22,760
(Screaming)

1562
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:24,460
(Screaming)

1563
01:05:24,730 --> 01:05:26,260
- Hey. - Gosh.

1564
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:27,300
- Hey. - "Winter?"

1565
01:05:27,730 --> 01:05:29,230
I can't do it anymore.

1566
01:05:29,230 --> 01:05:30,630
(Nutria isn't helpful at all.)

1567
01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:33,000
(I can't do it anymore.)

1568
01:05:34,869 --> 01:05:36,639
Goodness, I can't do it.

1569
01:05:36,639 --> 01:05:37,710
It's SEYUN's...

1570
01:05:37,710 --> 01:05:39,369
It's JUNG SEYUN and SONG SEUNGHO's friend.

1571
01:05:39,369 --> 01:05:40,369
Isn't it me?

1572
01:05:40,369 --> 01:05:41,539
(JUNG SEYUN and SONG SEUNGHO's friend)

1573
01:05:41,539 --> 01:05:43,539
- KIM JEONGMIN. - KIM JEONGMIN.

1574
01:05:43,780 --> 01:05:44,809
(KIM JEONGMIN)

1575
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:48,349
KIM JEONGMIN.

1576
01:05:48,349 --> 01:05:50,280
- Wait a minute. - What's the matter?

1577
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:51,519
(The game is over.)

1578
01:05:51,519 --> 01:05:52,650
- It's over. - It's over.

1579
01:05:52,650 --> 01:05:54,559
Please let us down!

1580
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:57,730
- Stop. - GUNWOO, raise your hand.

1581
01:05:58,460 --> 01:05:59,789
I want to get off.

1582
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:02,460
I hate this.

1583
01:06:02,630 --> 01:06:05,469
- They are way too scared. - JIWOON, KYOUNGBAE.

1584
01:06:05,469 --> 01:06:06,530
HAJOON.

1585
01:06:06,530 --> 01:06:07,869
(KYOUNGBAE's team: 1 minute 37 seconds)

1586
01:06:07,869 --> 01:06:08,869
Shall we raise our hands?

1587
01:06:08,869 --> 01:06:10,809
- No. - No way.

1588
01:06:10,809 --> 01:06:11,840
This is great.

1589
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:13,440
Well done, guys.

1590
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:14,510
- Congratulations. - Yes.

1591
01:06:14,510 --> 01:06:15,510
(They end on friendly terms with a tie.)

1592
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:18,079
- That's it. - That's good.

1593
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:19,150
Thank you.

1594
01:06:19,150 --> 01:06:20,679
(It's time to fill their stomachs.)

1595
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:27,320
The fish cake tastes amazing.

1596
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:28,789
- Right. - I only want a bite.

1597
01:06:29,090 --> 01:06:30,119
- Can you serve me? - Me too.

1598
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:31,889
- HYUNWOO, do you want some broth? - Yes.

1599
01:06:32,289 --> 01:06:33,429
It's delicious.

1600
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:35,530
- Nice. - Okay.

1601
01:06:37,530 --> 01:06:39,699
- SEYUN. - This is all about...

1602
01:06:39,699 --> 01:06:40,940
having skills.

1603
01:06:41,639 --> 01:06:42,670
Goodness.

1604
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:45,070
- This isn't right. - My gosh.

1605
01:06:45,070 --> 01:06:46,070
- Two. - Two.

1606
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:48,440
What are you doing?

1607
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:50,010
- I mean... - Listen.

1608
01:06:50,010 --> 01:06:51,280
What happened?

1609
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:52,750
- But that's... - Why did you do that?

1610
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:54,119
That's even harder.

1611
01:06:54,119 --> 01:06:55,920
Five dolphin brothers.

1612
01:06:59,650 --> 01:07:03,119
I won't forget what I'm seeing now.

1613
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,630
I like the view of the sea.

1614
01:07:06,789 --> 01:07:08,059
I also like the sound of the sea.

1615
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:10,829
I felt so happy today.

1616
01:07:11,099 --> 01:07:13,429
- I still feel happy. - It's been so long...

1617
01:07:13,429 --> 01:07:15,539
since we had fun, so I was happy today.

1618
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:17,610
This is great.

1619
01:07:18,139 --> 01:07:20,570
I didn't expect to see the sea.

1620
01:07:20,570 --> 01:07:21,780
(Enjoying the sea before going back to the training room)

1621
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:25,449
If we move onto Final Matching together,

1622
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:27,480
I hope that we'll be on the same team.

1623
01:07:27,619 --> 01:07:28,920
I think that we will be.

1624
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,679
- Do you think so? - Yes.

1625
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:33,119
This is how we both started.

1626
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:34,860
- We started... - We were unknown.

1627
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:36,420
from zero.

1628
01:07:37,059 --> 01:07:38,590
We came very far.

1629
01:07:38,630 --> 01:07:41,360
We got up to 70 or 80 out of 100.

1630
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:43,500
- Right. - From zero.

1631
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:45,070
It's not our skills that are 70 or 80.

1632
01:07:45,429 --> 01:07:48,800
In the process of growth, we're at 70 to 80 percent.

1633
01:07:49,269 --> 01:07:51,269
That's why I'm scared to face...

1634
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:52,909
the next Passing Ceremony.

1635
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:54,909
It's not just about getting eliminated.

1636
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:57,380
Let's say that we get eliminated...

1637
01:07:57,380 --> 01:07:59,010
and go back to our daily life.

1638
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:01,920
Then everything...

1639
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,920
that we've experienced so far...

1640
01:08:04,150 --> 01:08:07,989
will completely disappear.

1641
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:11,389
It'd feel like going back to our original life.

1642
01:08:11,630 --> 01:08:12,659
I agree.

1643
01:08:12,659 --> 01:08:15,130
We always trained ourselves until late at night.

1644
01:08:15,130 --> 01:08:16,600
Even when we slept for 2 to 3 hours,

1645
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:18,569
we worked very hard during training.

1646
01:08:18,569 --> 01:08:19,569
Right.

1647
01:08:19,829 --> 01:08:21,670
I'm a little worried.

1648
01:08:21,670 --> 01:08:23,439
Will I be able to do it alone?

1649
01:08:24,039 --> 01:08:26,239
We always had teammates...

1650
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:27,439
- on our side. - Right.

1651
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:29,510
We had teammates every time.

1652
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:31,649
That's why we worked hard,

1653
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:33,380
and we could come this far.

1654
01:08:34,350 --> 01:08:35,619
Even though it's very hard...

1655
01:08:35,619 --> 01:08:37,079
You're right.

1656
01:08:37,590 --> 01:08:39,220
Like you, I started my training...

1657
01:08:39,220 --> 01:08:40,859
at the age of 17.

1658
01:08:40,859 --> 01:08:41,989
Right.

1659
01:08:42,420 --> 01:08:44,890
What we experienced here was worth two years.

1660
01:08:45,289 --> 01:08:48,100
Spending 3 months here is the same as 2 years.

1661
01:08:48,229 --> 01:08:49,930
The training was worth two years.

1662
01:08:49,930 --> 01:08:51,300
I improved a lot too.

1663
01:08:51,899 --> 01:08:54,770
You get the result as much as you work.

1664
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:57,670
As you know,

1665
01:08:57,670 --> 01:08:59,939
it can feel futile no matter how hard you work.

1666
01:09:00,109 --> 01:09:01,909
The outcome of our work is invisible.

1667
01:09:01,909 --> 01:09:03,979
- Right. - It's completely invisible.

1668
01:09:04,449 --> 01:09:09,119
What shall I put this? In the end, it pays off.

1669
01:09:09,119 --> 01:09:10,819
- Right. - I say it based on my experience.

1670
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:14,050
All of us...

1671
01:09:14,289 --> 01:09:17,159
We all have a story behind how we came this far.

1672
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:19,590
I'm sure there's a lot to say.

1673
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:22,560
What we can say to each other is...

1674
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:24,100
- well done. - Yes.

1675
01:09:24,229 --> 01:09:25,770
Well done.

1676
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:27,470
This isn't the end...

1677
01:09:27,470 --> 01:09:30,000
even if we make our debut or not.

1678
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,140
- Right. - Whether we make it to the final.

1679
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:33,369
Well done, everyone. Please hug the person next to you.

1680
01:09:33,409 --> 01:09:34,479
Well done.

1681
01:09:34,479 --> 01:09:35,510
(My colleagues and friends who worked hard together for 4 months)

1682
01:09:35,510 --> 01:09:37,310
Hug each other tightly. Well done.

1683
01:09:37,310 --> 01:09:38,810
- Well done. - Well done.

1684
01:09:38,810 --> 01:09:40,409
- Well done. - Well done.

1685
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:42,449
- Don't cry. - Well done.

1686
01:09:42,850 --> 01:09:44,079
This is so nice.

1687
01:09:44,649 --> 01:09:46,090
Could you take a photo of us?

1688
01:09:46,090 --> 01:09:48,159
(We hope that they'll remember this moment for a long time.)

1689
01:09:57,229 --> 01:10:00,729
(The trainees' first unforgettable outing is over.)

1690
01:10:01,770 --> 01:10:04,239
This is the 3rd Passing Ceremony on PROJECT 7.

1691
01:10:04,970 --> 01:10:07,470
There are...

1692
01:10:08,510 --> 01:10:11,210
fifteen seats remaining for those who passed.

1693
01:10:11,210 --> 01:10:12,310
(15 seats remain.)

1694
01:10:13,510 --> 01:10:16,680
Which trainee from this team,

1695
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:20,189
and how many of them will get to take the seat?

1696
01:10:21,359 --> 01:10:23,659
The next team whose result I'll announce is...

1697
01:10:24,630 --> 01:10:26,390
- Team "Trigger?" - Team "Trigger?"

1698
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:28,859
- "Trigger." - It's Team "Trigger."

1699
01:10:28,859 --> 01:10:30,100
(The result for Team "Trigger" is announced next.)

1700
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:32,800
I feel very nervous.

1701
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:35,970
Team "Trigger" presented...

1702
01:10:35,970 --> 01:10:38,670
the darkest and the sexiest performance on PROJECT 7.

1703
01:10:38,670 --> 01:10:42,079
They stole the hearts of World Assemblers.

1704
01:10:42,479 --> 01:10:44,510
They tried to attract...

1705
01:10:44,510 --> 01:10:46,949
the World Assemblers as bad boys,

1706
01:10:46,949 --> 01:10:49,119
but unfortunately, they ranked second...

1707
01:10:49,579 --> 01:10:53,449
from on-site voting and couldn't win the benefit.

1708
01:10:53,449 --> 01:10:55,420
(Team Ranking, Individual Ranking)

1709
01:10:55,420 --> 01:10:56,989
(Team "Trigger," 187 votes)

1710
01:10:57,789 --> 01:11:01,329
How many trainees from Team "Trigger" will pass?

1711
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:06,300
I'll announce the result now.

1712
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:09,170
Is anyone at risk on Team "Trigger?"

1713
01:11:09,739 --> 01:11:10,739
(1st place, JEON MINWOOK, Week 6 ranking)

1714
01:11:10,739 --> 01:11:12,939
MINWOOK, YEOJUN,

1715
01:11:13,539 --> 01:11:15,909
and MAJINGXIANG will be candidates for the debut.

1716
01:11:16,510 --> 01:11:17,539
I'm a little nervous.

1717
01:11:17,539 --> 01:11:21,279
I don't know how I will rank this time.

1718
01:11:21,779 --> 01:11:24,649
Many of them are Top Seven, so many of them may not be called.

1719
01:11:24,949 --> 01:11:26,850
A lot of them are supposed to pass.

1720
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:29,020
I feel like HYUNWOO went up in ranking.

1721
01:11:29,319 --> 01:11:30,319
I know.

1722
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:32,260
HYUNWOO could be in the debut team.

1723
01:11:32,590 --> 01:11:33,930
His ranking went up a lot last time.

1724
01:11:33,930 --> 01:11:34,960
(13th place, KIM HYUNWOO, Week 6 ranking)

1725
01:11:35,130 --> 01:11:38,300
But there's a trainee in 35th place in Team "Trigger."

1726
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:40,270
- Really? Oh, LYNNLYNN? - LYNNLYNN.

1727
01:11:41,369 --> 01:11:43,939
Everyone on our team...

1728
01:11:44,810 --> 01:11:46,539
passed.

1729
01:11:47,439 --> 01:11:49,310
- I'm the only one who didn't. - Come on.

1730
01:11:50,010 --> 01:11:51,750
I'm in 35th place.

1731
01:11:52,079 --> 01:11:54,720
- No, you can do it. - No. It's okay.

1732
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:57,319
I'm in 35th place.

1733
01:11:57,479 --> 01:11:59,920
It's my last performance and my last shoot.

1734
01:12:00,119 --> 01:12:03,760
I think I'm probably going home today.

1735
01:12:04,189 --> 01:12:05,189
Yes.

1736
01:12:05,890 --> 01:12:08,630
The first trainee's ranking to be announced...

1737
01:12:08,630 --> 01:12:09,960
from Team "Trigger..."

1738
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,100
is 20th place.

1739
01:12:13,130 --> 01:12:14,270
(A trainee in 20th place is in Team "Trigger.")

1740
01:12:14,270 --> 01:12:15,369
It's 20th place.

1741
01:12:15,770 --> 01:12:16,840
There's a trainee in 20th place in this team?

1742
01:12:17,670 --> 01:12:18,710
What?

1743
01:12:19,739 --> 01:12:20,869
No.

1744
01:12:21,409 --> 01:12:24,010
(35th place, LYNNLYNN, Week 6 ranking)

1745
01:12:24,039 --> 01:12:26,409
- What? - PARK JUNSEO.

1746
01:12:26,949 --> 01:12:29,750
I was in 17th place last time,

1747
01:12:29,949 --> 01:12:33,319
but I couldn't get the benefit in the last mission,

1748
01:12:33,319 --> 01:12:36,989
so I thought my ranking would drop a lot.

1749
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:40,390
Let me give you a hint about this trainee.

1750
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:41,659
He's...

1751
01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:44,800
usually very playful,

1752
01:12:45,270 --> 01:12:46,670
- It's HYUNWOO. - But on stage,

1753
01:12:46,670 --> 01:12:49,600
he's full of charisma.

1754
01:12:49,770 --> 01:12:50,899
- It must be HYUNWOO. - The gap between the two sides...

1755
01:12:50,899 --> 01:12:52,039
is quite big.

1756
01:12:52,710 --> 01:12:54,310
- Is it HYUNWOO? Isn't it JUNSEO? - It's HYUNWOO.

1757
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:57,880
And this trainee's position...

1758
01:12:59,649 --> 01:13:00,909
- Dance. - It's dance.

1759
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:04,489
It's the trainee you're reminded of when you think of dance position.

1760
01:13:04,649 --> 01:13:06,520
But everyone's position is dance in this team.

1761
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:07,960
- You're right. - They're all dancers.

1762
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:09,760
How is it any different from saying it's a vocalist from our team?

1763
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:10,819
They're all dancers.

1764
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:13,390
It's either JUNSEO or HYUNWOO.

1765
01:13:13,829 --> 01:13:15,630
- It's probably JUNSEO. - It's me.

1766
01:13:17,399 --> 01:13:19,529
HYUNWOO? But he was in 13th place.

1767
01:13:22,399 --> 01:13:23,439
Is it JUNSEO?

1768
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:24,939
This trainee received...

1769
01:13:25,869 --> 01:13:29,979
a global voting score of 757,503 points.

1770
01:13:31,710 --> 01:13:33,680
It's Trainee PARK...

1771
01:13:34,619 --> 01:13:37,279
- JUNSEO. - Gosh.

1772
01:13:37,789 --> 01:13:38,890
Really?

1773
01:13:39,590 --> 01:13:40,890
Gosh, JUNSEO.

1774
01:13:40,890 --> 01:13:42,890
Traine PARK JUNSEO, congratulations.

1775
01:13:45,689 --> 01:13:47,130
- I'm glad. - Trainee PARK JUNSEO...

1776
01:13:47,130 --> 01:13:49,729
has shown improved leadership...

1777
01:13:49,729 --> 01:13:52,930
every time time he went through each project.

1778
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:57,539
For the Original Matching, he showed a tough leader's side...

1779
01:13:57,539 --> 01:14:00,470
while leading his team, contributing a big part...

1780
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:02,310
in creating a perfect performance.

1781
01:14:02,739 --> 01:14:06,180
I'll look forward to his performance in the Final Matching.

1782
01:14:08,819 --> 01:14:11,720
The next trainee's ranking I'll announce...

1783
01:14:12,689 --> 01:14:13,720
There's more?

1784
01:14:14,489 --> 01:14:15,619
There must be.

1785
01:14:16,359 --> 01:14:19,890
HYUNWOO and YICHEN are in the team as well.

1786
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:24,670
I think both HYUNWOO and YICHEN will join us.

1787
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:27,670
The next trainee's ranking I'll announce...

1788
01:14:29,970 --> 01:14:32,069
is 13th place.

1789
01:14:32,069 --> 01:14:33,439
(The next trainee's ranking to be announce is 13th place.)

1790
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:35,109
- No ranking in between? - What?

1791
01:14:36,279 --> 01:14:38,779
- That's too high. - It's 13th place?

1792
01:14:39,449 --> 01:14:40,979
It's probably YICHEN.

1793
01:14:41,949 --> 01:14:43,350
(12th place, YICHEN, Week 6 ranking)

1794
01:14:43,350 --> 01:14:44,590
YICHEN or HYUNWOO?

1795
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:49,020
(13th place, KIM HYUNWOO, Week 6 ranking)

1796
01:14:49,890 --> 01:14:53,130
This trainee shows perfect chemistry...

1797
01:14:53,130 --> 01:14:54,859
with whoever he works with.

1798
01:14:55,430 --> 01:14:57,659
He's a chemistry fairy.

1799
01:14:58,329 --> 01:15:00,130
- Chemistry fairy? - It's HYUNWOO.

1800
01:15:01,029 --> 01:15:02,199
I think it's HYUNWOO.

1801
01:15:02,699 --> 01:15:03,899
It must be HYUNWOO.

1802
01:15:05,109 --> 01:15:06,609
Or it could be YICHEN.

1803
01:15:06,770 --> 01:15:08,510
- I think it's YICHEN. - You should go out.

1804
01:15:09,239 --> 01:15:11,710
YICHEN does show amazing chemistry.

1805
01:15:13,010 --> 01:15:14,279
I was really nervous...

1806
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:18,020
because I was in eighth place, but my ranking kept dropping.

1807
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:21,220
I felt like I was on the line today.

1808
01:15:21,619 --> 01:15:24,119
This trainee has...

1809
01:15:24,659 --> 01:15:27,229
a unique way of speaking...

1810
01:15:28,199 --> 01:15:29,859
- It's HYUNWOO. - and has created...

1811
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:31,970
a certain character for himself.

1812
01:15:31,970 --> 01:15:34,640
It applies to both YICHEN and HYUNWOO.

1813
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:35,640
I know.

1814
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:37,270
I really can't tell.

1815
01:15:37,270 --> 01:15:38,840
No, your name will be called.

1816
01:15:39,810 --> 01:15:40,869
Get out there, YICHEN.

1817
01:15:40,869 --> 01:15:42,180
This trainee received...

1818
01:15:43,210 --> 01:15:46,949
a global voting score of 894,904 points.

1819
01:15:46,949 --> 01:15:48,079
It's a 10,000-point difference.

1820
01:15:52,420 --> 01:15:53,689
It's Trainee YICHEN.

1821
01:15:53,689 --> 01:15:56,989
(13th place, Trainee YICHEN)

1822
01:15:56,989 --> 01:15:58,060
Congratulations.

1823
01:15:58,460 --> 01:15:59,590
Gosh.

1824
01:16:04,359 --> 01:16:05,430
Goodness.

1825
01:16:06,699 --> 01:16:07,800
Am I going home today?

1826
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:09,939
Trainee YICHEN showed a good performance...

1827
01:16:09,939 --> 01:16:11,810
as a main rapper in the Position Matching.

1828
01:16:11,810 --> 01:16:14,140
That's how confident he is in rapping.

1829
01:16:14,369 --> 01:16:17,880
In the Original Matching, he took the vocal position.

1830
01:16:18,380 --> 01:16:20,079
With his tenacity, he pulled it off well,

1831
01:16:20,079 --> 01:16:23,149
winning the World Assemblers' approval once again...

1832
01:16:23,149 --> 01:16:24,550
and passed.

1833
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:27,449
Gosh, his ranking is high.

1834
01:16:29,619 --> 01:16:32,130
The next trainee's ranking...

1835
01:16:32,130 --> 01:16:35,260
I'm going to announce...

1836
01:16:35,359 --> 01:16:36,359
HYUNWOO?

1837
01:16:36,829 --> 01:16:38,470
He should be in 15th or 16th place.

1838
01:16:38,699 --> 01:16:41,770
Otherwise, he'll be in the debut team.

1839
01:16:42,239 --> 01:16:44,569
I'm sure the trainee in 15th place is in that team.

1840
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:47,310
Trainees in 15th, 16th, or 19th place.

1841
01:16:48,510 --> 01:16:51,579
It's 16th place.

1842
01:16:51,579 --> 01:16:54,210
It's all mixed up.

1843
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:56,850
- Gosh. Oh, HYUNWOO. - Yes. HYUNWOO should join us.

1844
01:16:58,119 --> 01:16:59,989
Let's go.

1845
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:05,590
I felt like I was at risk at that moment.

1846
01:17:06,159 --> 01:17:10,829
This trainee is full of positive energy.

1847
01:17:11,199 --> 01:17:12,500
It's HYUNWOO.

1848
01:17:13,069 --> 01:17:14,300
HYUNWOO.

1849
01:17:15,170 --> 01:17:16,470
"There's nothing impossible."

1850
01:17:18,170 --> 01:17:19,340
Positive energy.

1851
01:17:21,340 --> 01:17:23,510
HYUNWOO is coming, so I should wipe it for him.

1852
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:27,250
Through Original Matching,

1853
01:17:27,579 --> 01:17:28,979
this trainee challenged himself...

1854
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:32,550
to the vocal position for the first time in his life.

1855
01:17:32,550 --> 01:17:35,520
(A trainee who challenged himself to the vocal position)

1856
01:17:35,989 --> 01:17:37,189
- What? - What?

1857
01:17:38,529 --> 01:17:39,659
- What? - What?

1858
01:17:39,659 --> 01:17:41,600
- No way! - Vocal position?

1859
01:17:42,029 --> 01:17:43,300
- What? - What?

1860
01:17:44,199 --> 01:17:45,369
Vocal position?

1861
01:17:45,930 --> 01:17:47,430
- I wasn't the vocalist. - LYNNLYNN?

1862
01:17:47,430 --> 01:17:48,500
LYNNLYNN?

1863
01:17:49,199 --> 01:17:51,510
- Didn't HYUNWOO rap? - Yes, he's a rapper.

1864
01:17:51,510 --> 01:17:53,270
- A rapper... - Gosh, what is this?

1865
01:17:53,270 --> 01:17:54,369
LYNNLYNN?

1866
01:17:54,739 --> 01:17:57,279
- No way. Really? - LYNNLYNN with positive energy.

1867
01:17:57,409 --> 01:17:58,810
This trainee received...

1868
01:17:59,210 --> 01:18:03,319
a global voting score of 790,923 points.

1869
01:18:05,350 --> 01:18:06,420
LYNNLYNN.

1870
01:18:06,420 --> 01:18:08,619
(16th place, Trainee LYNNLYNN)

1871
01:18:08,619 --> 01:18:09,689
LYNNLYNN!

1872
01:18:10,689 --> 01:18:11,760
LYNNLYNN.

1873
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:14,829
LYNNLYNN!

1874
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,270
- Gosh. - Gosh.

1875
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:21,770
Gosh!

1876
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:24,069
LYNNLYNN, it's you.

1877
01:18:24,869 --> 01:18:26,840
Gosh, LYNNLYNN!

1878
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:29,409
- Let's go. - I told you you could do it.

1879
01:18:30,380 --> 01:18:31,850
- Go ahead. - You're the best.

1880
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:38,289
Gosh, that's another human victory.

1881
01:18:38,789 --> 01:18:41,220
Gosh, he went up to 16th place from 35th place.

1882
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:43,390
His ranking went up by 19 places.

1883
01:18:44,090 --> 01:18:45,159
Gosh.

1884
01:18:45,430 --> 01:18:49,130
LYNNLYNN's main position is dance and rap,

1885
01:18:49,460 --> 01:18:52,600
but during Original Matching, he was the main vocalist.

1886
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:55,539
He showed his progress as a vocalist...

1887
01:18:55,539 --> 01:18:57,539
with the "I can do it" spirit.

1888
01:18:58,270 --> 01:19:00,510
He even survived in the third Passing Ceremony,

1889
01:19:00,609 --> 01:19:03,510
earning another chance.

1890
01:19:03,710 --> 01:19:05,310
Congratulations again.

1891
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:10,449
- LYNNLYNN! Congratulations. - Oh, my gosh.

1892
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:12,689
Gosh, that's human victory for LYNNLYNN.

1893
01:19:13,550 --> 01:19:15,819
While preparing for "Trigger,"

1894
01:19:16,119 --> 01:19:17,720
LYNNLYNN always said,

1895
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:19,359
"I can be the main vocalist. I don't mind..."

1896
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:21,329
"as long as the team performance looks good."

1897
01:19:21,329 --> 01:19:25,069
He prepared for it with a cool mindset.

1898
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,630
He prepared it so he'd leave no regret,

1899
01:19:27,630 --> 01:19:29,039
and that mindset seemed to have been delivered.

1900
01:19:30,970 --> 01:19:32,310
What's going on today?

1901
01:19:32,510 --> 01:19:34,880
It's all mixed up.

1902
01:19:35,439 --> 01:19:38,010
I'll continue the announcement.

1903
01:19:38,949 --> 01:19:43,380
The trainee from Team "Trigger" who passed...

1904
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:45,920
Maybe it's done.

1905
01:19:46,949 --> 01:19:49,460
He described every trainee who passed...

1906
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:52,789
like it was me.

1907
01:19:53,430 --> 01:19:55,630
He didn't call my name until the end,

1908
01:19:55,659 --> 01:19:58,899
so I thought, "I really might have to go home."

1909
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:01,539
That thought dominated my head.

1910
01:20:03,069 --> 01:20:04,909
There must be more.

1911
01:20:05,939 --> 01:20:07,470
Nineteenth or fifteenth place?

1912
01:20:07,609 --> 01:20:09,109
- There's no more? - No way.

1913
01:20:10,039 --> 01:20:12,210
The trainee who passed from Team "Trigger."

1914
01:20:12,979 --> 01:20:14,050
There's no more.

1915
01:20:14,050 --> 01:20:15,520
(There's no more trainee who passed.)

1916
01:20:15,649 --> 01:20:16,680
There's none.

1917
01:20:16,949 --> 01:20:19,319
(There aren't any more trainees who passed.)

1918
01:20:19,319 --> 01:20:20,420
- Gosh. - What?

1919
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:23,060
- This is impossible. - Then who's going to pass?

1920
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:25,989
This really makes no sense.

1921
01:20:26,829 --> 01:20:28,060
Then are all of them in Top Seven?

1922
01:20:28,090 --> 01:20:30,100
But this doesn't make sense.

1923
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:32,329
Both SIHUN and MINSEO weren't called.

1924
01:20:32,329 --> 01:20:34,529
- Then what about HYUNWOO? - Is HYUNWOO in ninth place?

1925
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,470
JUNSEO, keep up the good work.

1926
01:20:38,609 --> 01:20:40,170
HYUNWOO...

1927
01:20:42,380 --> 01:20:44,340
We still have 21st place...

1928
01:20:44,579 --> 01:20:46,850
and Top Seven left to announce,

1929
01:20:46,850 --> 01:20:50,520
so please stay on your toes until the end.

1930
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:54,520
Gosh, that's a big change in the rankings.

1931
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:56,520
What's happening?

1932
01:20:58,229 --> 01:21:00,829
First, I'd like to thank...

1933
01:21:00,829 --> 01:21:04,460
the World Assemblers who gave me another chance...

1934
01:21:04,729 --> 01:21:06,229
until the end.

1935
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,130
And...

1936
01:21:08,739 --> 01:21:11,439
I believe that all seven members of Team "Trigger..."

1937
01:21:11,439 --> 01:21:14,770
will make it to the finals,

1938
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:18,680
so I hope everyone will make it...

1939
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:22,380
and do the final performance happily.

1940
01:21:24,649 --> 01:21:25,949
You can never tell.

1941
01:21:27,789 --> 01:21:31,520
To the World Assemblers who voted for me...

1942
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:33,189
and support me,

1943
01:21:33,729 --> 01:21:36,430
I'd like to thank them.

1944
01:21:37,300 --> 01:21:39,329
Also, I'd like to...

1945
01:21:39,329 --> 01:21:42,739
congratulate LYNNLYNN from the bottom of my heart...

1946
01:21:42,739 --> 01:21:45,510
because on the way here in the car,

1947
01:21:45,909 --> 01:21:49,380
he told me that it was about time...

1948
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:52,449
he said goodbye.

1949
01:21:52,909 --> 01:21:56,920
I really want to congratulate him,

1950
01:21:56,920 --> 01:21:59,550
and I want to tell the members...

1951
01:21:59,550 --> 01:22:02,420
that I was really grateful and happy,

1952
01:22:02,420 --> 01:22:04,720
although it was just for a short period of time.

1953
01:22:05,090 --> 01:22:06,159
Thank you.

1954
01:22:10,060 --> 01:22:11,670
Trainee YICHEN.

1955
01:22:12,029 --> 01:22:15,600
You seemed to struggle a lot during the last project.

1956
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:18,170
Would you like to say something to Trainee JANG YEOJUN?

1957
01:22:18,170 --> 01:22:19,170
(Something he wants to tell Trainee JANG YEOJUN?)

1958
01:22:19,170 --> 01:22:20,170
Oh, my gosh.

1959
01:22:20,609 --> 01:22:23,539
(They had a little dispute.)

1960
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:27,380
Although YEOJUN talked harshly,

1961
01:22:27,579 --> 01:22:30,350
he's really kind.

1962
01:22:30,850 --> 01:22:31,949
He's a kind friend.

1963
01:22:33,890 --> 01:22:34,949
Even if he talks harshly?

1964
01:22:34,949 --> 01:22:36,720
So please don't hate him so much.

1965
01:22:36,989 --> 01:22:40,359
I'm a little intimidated,

1966
01:22:40,359 --> 01:22:43,500
but next time, I'll become more charming,

1967
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,529
although it won't be as bad as how I was...

1968
01:22:45,529 --> 01:22:48,130
during P5.

1969
01:22:48,439 --> 01:22:50,470
So please look forward to it.

1970
01:22:54,770 --> 01:22:56,979
- No. - He'll become intense again.

1971
01:22:57,609 --> 01:23:00,350
Hello, I'm LYNNLYNN. Gosh.

1972
01:23:03,380 --> 01:23:04,449
Seriously, you can't help but exclaim.

1973
01:23:04,579 --> 01:23:05,720
- You can't help but exclaim. - You can't help but exclaim.

1974
01:23:06,119 --> 01:23:08,050
This is crazy.

1975
01:23:09,220 --> 01:23:10,720
- It's crazy. - Congratulations!

1976
01:23:11,359 --> 01:23:13,659
- It's crazy. - World Assemblers.

1977
01:23:13,659 --> 01:23:14,789
Thank you so much.

1978
01:23:15,029 --> 01:23:16,229
It's amazing.

1979
01:23:17,859 --> 01:23:19,329
Thank you very much.

1980
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:23,670
I'm not sure how to put this,

1981
01:23:23,670 --> 01:23:28,479
but thank you so much for helping me...

1982
01:23:28,810 --> 01:23:33,380
and voting for me every day. You guys are the best.

1983
01:23:33,810 --> 01:23:35,250
I'll continue to work hard.

1984
01:23:35,420 --> 01:23:37,050
Thank you.

1985
01:23:37,050 --> 01:23:39,220
I'll work hard.

1986
01:23:39,949 --> 01:23:44,289
HYUNWOO, hurry up and join us.

1987
01:23:44,689 --> 01:23:45,960
- Me? - Yes. Hurry.

1988
01:23:49,029 --> 01:23:50,359
He wants HYUNWOO to hurry and join him.

1989
01:23:55,699 --> 01:23:56,840
Gosh, he's amazing.

1990
01:23:58,270 --> 01:23:59,340
It's so shocking.

1991
01:24:00,310 --> 01:24:02,810
The next team of trainees whom I'll make an announcement of...

1992
01:24:03,579 --> 01:24:04,939
I bet my ranking dropped a lot.

1993
01:24:05,510 --> 01:24:07,409
Who? You? It must've gone up.

1994
01:24:09,949 --> 01:24:13,090
- It's Team "Merry-Go-Round." - "Merry-Go-Round."

1995
01:24:13,319 --> 01:24:15,289
- Go ahead. - Good luck.

1996
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:17,489
- Don't come back from there. - Gosh, it's cold.

1997
01:24:17,590 --> 01:24:18,789
It's bothersome, so don't come back.

1998
01:24:19,289 --> 01:24:21,090
The remaining seats will be filled by them.

1999
01:24:21,090 --> 01:24:22,899
Everyone in this team is in the debut team.

2000
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:25,270
Look at that. The five of them...

2001
01:24:26,029 --> 01:24:27,069
Second place.

2002
01:24:27,069 --> 01:24:28,069
(2nd place, SAKURADA KENSHIN)

2003
01:24:28,069 --> 01:24:29,069
Third place.

2004
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:30,840
Fifth place.

2005
01:24:31,770 --> 01:24:33,170
(6th place, KIM SUNGMIN, 8th place, NAM JIWOON)

2006
01:24:33,170 --> 01:24:35,939
Team "Merry-Go-Round" endlessly appealed...

2007
01:24:35,939 --> 01:24:38,079
to the World Assemblers with their skills, concept,

2008
01:24:38,079 --> 01:24:41,149
teamwork, and their individual charms.

2009
01:24:41,579 --> 01:24:44,720
From the on-site voting, they won first place...

2010
01:24:44,750 --> 01:24:46,789
in the final team ranking.

2011
01:24:46,789 --> 01:24:48,020
(In the end, they won 1st place.)

2012
01:24:48,020 --> 01:24:50,859
Thanks to that, everyone on the team earned ten percent...

2013
01:24:50,859 --> 01:24:54,159
of their global voting score as their benefit.

2014
01:24:54,460 --> 01:24:56,000
The benefit is huge.

2015
01:24:57,029 --> 01:24:58,899
There's a high chance the first-place winner will change.

2016
01:24:59,199 --> 01:25:02,000
What kind of result will this benefit bring?

2017
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,670
(How will the huge benefit change the result?)

2018
01:25:03,670 --> 01:25:04,670
Now,

2019
01:25:05,310 --> 01:25:08,369
I'll announce the trainees who passed.

2020
01:25:09,079 --> 01:25:11,079
There are only 15th and 19th places.

2021
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:15,949
The ranking of the first trainee who passed...

2022
01:25:15,949 --> 01:25:17,920
(The ranking of the trainee who passed)

2023
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:21,189
is 15th place.

2024
01:25:21,189 --> 01:25:22,560
(3rd Passing Ceremony, 15the place)

2025
01:25:23,090 --> 01:25:24,220
Who could it be?

2026
01:25:25,659 --> 01:25:26,689
Who is it?

2027
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:30,130
ANDY or SEYUN.

2028
01:25:31,430 --> 01:25:32,869
I was really nervous.

2029
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:36,470
I was in last place even in Team "Merry-Go-Round."

2030
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:38,939
My heart was beating so fast.

2031
01:25:39,609 --> 01:25:41,140
My ranking isn't rising.

2032
01:25:41,140 --> 01:25:43,010
It's been dropping continuously.

2033
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:45,149
I wished I could be in 15th place.

2034
01:25:46,579 --> 01:25:48,380
Who do you think it is, ANDY or SEYUN?

2035
01:25:49,949 --> 01:25:51,020
I really can't tell.

2036
01:25:51,819 --> 01:25:52,890
ANDY.

2037
01:25:53,189 --> 01:25:54,189
SEYUN?

2038
01:25:54,649 --> 01:25:55,859
This trainee received...

2039
01:25:56,489 --> 01:26:00,529
a global voting score of 859,803 points.

2040
01:26:03,359 --> 01:26:04,430
ANDY, let's go.

2041
01:26:05,670 --> 01:26:06,699
JUNG SEYUN?

2042
01:26:08,670 --> 01:26:09,970
It's Trainee ANDY.

2043
01:26:10,439 --> 01:26:11,439
ANDY!

2044
01:26:11,439 --> 01:26:13,510
(15th place, ANDY)

2045
01:26:16,340 --> 01:26:19,310
- You're crying again. - You're crying again.

2046
01:26:19,310 --> 01:26:20,949
- You're crying again. - You're crying again.

2047
01:26:22,180 --> 01:26:23,520
It's like Tear Ceremony...

2048
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:25,720
- for ANDY every time. - Right. It's Tear Ceremony.

2049
01:26:28,390 --> 01:26:31,760
While preparing for "Merry-Go-Round,"

2050
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:33,560
ANDY thought it could be his last performance,

2051
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:35,500
so he prepared for it...

2052
01:26:36,260 --> 01:26:37,960
with a desperate heart.

2053
01:26:38,869 --> 01:26:40,770
I knew he'd make it. I mean it.

2054
01:26:41,569 --> 01:26:43,670
ANDY was praised a lot for his vocals this time.

2055
01:26:44,670 --> 01:26:46,939
He's advancing to the next project...

2056
01:26:46,939 --> 01:26:48,369
in a stable ranking.

2057
01:26:50,180 --> 01:26:53,210
The ranking of the next trainee I'm going to announce...

2058
01:26:54,279 --> 01:26:56,449
is 19th place.

2059
01:26:56,449 --> 01:26:57,479
(The next trainee is in 19th place.)

2060
01:26:57,479 --> 01:26:58,520
It's 19th place.

2061
01:26:59,420 --> 01:27:01,449
While preparing for Original Matching,

2062
01:27:01,449 --> 01:27:03,819
this trainee spent nights in tears.

2063
01:27:03,819 --> 01:27:05,960
(Hint 1: A trainee who spent nights in tears)

2064
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:06,989
Is it me?

2065
01:27:09,529 --> 01:27:10,630
This trainee...

2066
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:14,470
was born in 2007.

2067
01:27:14,869 --> 01:27:16,199
Come on out, SEYUN.

2068
01:27:16,970 --> 01:27:18,470
- "Come on out?" - Come out now.

2069
01:27:19,670 --> 01:27:20,739
Do you want to step up first?

2070
01:27:21,310 --> 01:27:22,539
This trainee received...

2071
01:27:22,539 --> 01:27:27,279
a global voting score of 758,744 points.

2072
01:27:27,510 --> 01:27:28,850
SEYUN should get ready.

2073
01:27:30,619 --> 01:27:31,619
Come on out.

2074
01:27:32,619 --> 01:27:33,619
Come on out.

2075
01:27:34,819 --> 01:27:35,960
He told you to come out.

2076
01:27:36,659 --> 01:27:37,659
Okay.

2077
01:27:38,659 --> 01:27:40,689
It's Trainee JUNG SEYUN. Congratulations.

2078
01:27:40,689 --> 01:27:42,199
(19th place, JUNG SEYUN)

2079
01:27:43,359 --> 01:27:44,960
- Come on. - Hey.

2080
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:47,300
- Go on up. - In Team "Merry-Go-Round,"

2081
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:49,340
Trainee JUNG SEYUN went through a lot as a young leader...

2082
01:27:49,340 --> 01:27:51,939
who faced many things for the first time.

2083
01:27:52,170 --> 01:27:54,409
He shed tears every night.

2084
01:27:55,380 --> 01:27:58,109
Today's result could've changed...

2085
01:27:58,109 --> 01:27:59,710
without the benefit he earned.

2086
01:27:59,710 --> 01:28:00,779
Congratulations.

2087
01:28:03,020 --> 01:28:05,890
Right. He could've been eliminated without the benefit.

2088
01:28:06,250 --> 01:28:08,050
Actually, I wasn't sure...

2089
01:28:08,050 --> 01:28:11,520
if I could survive,

2090
01:28:13,029 --> 01:28:14,930
so I still can't believe it.

2091
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:19,529
I want to show the new side of me,

2092
01:28:22,069 --> 01:28:24,539
and it could be my last performance,

2093
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:28,210
so I'll work hard to do it with no regrets.

2094
01:28:28,210 --> 01:28:29,239
Thank you.

2095
01:28:31,609 --> 01:28:33,079
That team must be in a festive mood.

2096
01:28:34,010 --> 01:28:36,649
First, I'd like to thank the World Assemblers...

2097
01:28:36,649 --> 01:28:37,920
who voted for me.

2098
01:28:38,819 --> 01:28:43,220
The seven of us worked really hard.

2099
01:28:43,220 --> 01:28:45,789
I'd like to thank them for following my lead.

2100
01:28:46,789 --> 01:28:49,329
And the trainees who are sitting there,

2101
01:28:49,899 --> 01:28:53,930
SIHUN, ATILLA, and MINSEO,

2102
01:28:54,100 --> 01:28:56,199
who were in the same team with me.

2103
01:28:56,539 --> 01:28:58,970
I hope they can advance to the next round with me.

2104
01:28:59,409 --> 01:29:00,470
Thank you.

2105
01:29:05,409 --> 01:29:06,510
- Well done. - I thought you two would cry,

2106
01:29:06,510 --> 01:29:07,579
but you didn't.

2107
01:29:10,350 --> 01:29:11,850
- ANDY was crying... - Good job.

2108
01:29:11,850 --> 01:29:13,619
even before he was called.

2109
01:29:13,850 --> 01:29:15,460
Your nostrils were flaring up.

2110
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:16,560
I know.

2111
01:29:16,689 --> 01:29:17,890
Gosh, we only have...

2112
01:29:17,890 --> 01:29:20,090
Top 7 candidates and 21st place only.

2113
01:29:20,630 --> 01:29:24,199
In the Third Passing Ceremony,

2114
01:29:24,199 --> 01:29:27,569
every trainee who passed were announced...

2115
01:29:27,569 --> 01:29:30,600
except for Top 7 and 21st place.

2116
01:29:31,699 --> 01:29:32,869
There aren't any seats remaining.

2117
01:29:34,109 --> 01:29:35,609
So this is how it must've felt.

2118
01:29:40,649 --> 01:29:41,649
Goodbye.

2119
01:29:41,680 --> 01:29:42,880
I might cry if you get eliminated.

2120
01:29:43,079 --> 01:29:44,279
- Really? - Yes.

2121
01:29:44,279 --> 01:29:45,350
- Make sure you cry. - Okay.

2122
01:29:46,689 --> 01:29:49,189
That means either MINSEO, SIHUN, or HYUNWOO...

2123
01:29:49,189 --> 01:29:50,420
could get eliminated.

2124
01:29:51,359 --> 01:29:55,130
Either HYUNWOO, MINSEO, or SIHUN.

2125
01:29:55,460 --> 01:29:57,800
One of them is in 21st place and one is in 9th place.

2126
01:29:57,800 --> 01:29:58,829
That means one of them is getting eliminated.

2127
01:29:59,470 --> 01:30:00,829
What's going on?

2128
01:30:00,829 --> 01:30:02,140
(Who will be in Top 7 and 21st place?)

2129
01:30:02,140 --> 01:30:04,670
The trainees in the debut team...

2130
01:30:04,869 --> 01:30:09,279
and the last trainee to pass in 21st place will be announced.

2131
01:30:09,909 --> 01:30:10,909
Before that,

2132
01:30:11,939 --> 01:30:15,380
we'll reveal another video the trainees prepared...

2133
01:30:16,380 --> 01:30:19,250
for the World Assemblers.

2134
01:30:19,789 --> 01:30:21,119
Let's see.

2135
01:30:24,989 --> 01:30:27,029
(One sunny afternoon)

2136
01:30:27,029 --> 01:30:28,430
(Where did the trainees go?)

2137
01:30:28,430 --> 01:30:29,600
Hello.

2138
01:30:29,729 --> 01:30:31,500
(Surprised)

2139
01:30:31,659 --> 01:30:32,699
What is this?

2140
01:30:33,970 --> 01:30:35,399
Gosh, I thought it was a swimming pool.

2141
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:38,670
- Have you ever done it before? - No, never.

2142
01:30:40,170 --> 01:30:41,239
I'm in trouble.

2143
01:30:41,239 --> 01:30:42,409
(What filled the trainees with worries?)

2144
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:45,140
(A special event to welcome the winter)

2145
01:30:45,710 --> 01:30:48,310
Kkakdugi, green onion kimchi, capa cabbage kimchi.

2146
01:30:49,550 --> 01:30:51,779
Capa cabbage is really expensive these days.

2147
01:30:51,779 --> 01:30:53,189
(There are various condiments.)

2148
01:30:53,619 --> 01:30:55,689
- It's pork! - It's meat.

2149
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:57,060
Let's make suyuk.

2150
01:30:57,060 --> 01:30:58,289
(There's pork as well.)

2151
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:00,829
It looks like we are...

2152
01:31:00,829 --> 01:31:02,699
making kimchi today.

2153
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:04,630
- Yes. - Making kimchi sounds fun.

2154
01:31:06,229 --> 01:31:07,229
Making kimchi?

2155
01:31:07,899 --> 01:31:08,970
It never occurred to me.

2156
01:31:09,470 --> 01:31:11,670
The trainees from other countries must've never done it.

2157
01:31:11,670 --> 01:31:13,140
- Right? - I've never done it.

2158
01:31:13,140 --> 01:31:15,109
- I've never done it. - I've never done it either.

2159
01:31:15,810 --> 01:31:17,340
(Exclaiming)

2160
01:31:17,340 --> 01:31:18,409
It's their first time.

2161
01:31:18,949 --> 01:31:22,420
- MINWOOK loves kimchi. - Yes.

2162
01:31:22,579 --> 01:31:23,880
- I feel great about this. - You love kimchi.

2163
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:27,420
That's why when we eat boxed meals, I eat KOTARO's kimchi.

2164
01:31:27,420 --> 01:31:28,520
It's too spicy for him.

2165
01:31:28,819 --> 01:31:31,819
Let's put on the aprons and start making kimchi.

2166
01:31:31,819 --> 01:31:33,359
- Great. - Should we get started?

2167
01:31:33,689 --> 01:31:34,760
Yes.

2168
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:36,229
I see a lot of cute aprons.

2169
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:37,800
They look so cute.

2170
01:31:38,060 --> 01:31:39,100
(Cute aprons are prepared too.)

2171
01:31:39,100 --> 01:31:40,130
What's this?

2172
01:31:42,470 --> 01:31:43,939
Isn't this a bib?

2173
01:31:44,239 --> 01:31:46,069
- Is this a bib? It's not, right? - SEUNGHO.

2174
01:31:46,069 --> 01:31:47,270
- It's a bib. - Who wants this?

2175
01:31:48,069 --> 01:31:49,609
- You look cute, KOTARO. - Wait.

2176
01:31:49,609 --> 01:31:51,140
- You look so cute. - Really?

2177
01:31:52,649 --> 01:31:55,210
- He looks like a fancy rice grain. - You look like a flower. Really?

2178
01:31:55,350 --> 01:31:57,850
- Do I look okay? - Hey, you look so cute!

2179
01:31:58,750 --> 01:32:00,489
- Are you lying to me? - No, I mean it.

2180
01:32:00,489 --> 01:32:01,520
You look like a princess.

2181
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:03,920
How could he look good in this?

2182
01:32:04,359 --> 01:32:05,659
- All right. - Hey.

2183
01:32:05,659 --> 01:32:06,930
Earrings look great on you.

2184
01:32:06,930 --> 01:32:08,689
I put them on him. What do you think?

2185
01:32:08,689 --> 01:32:10,930
We're making kimchi today. I didn't put them on myself.

2186
01:32:10,930 --> 01:32:12,869
- What do you think? Good? - He put them on me.

2187
01:32:13,430 --> 01:32:17,000
(Anyway, they're ready to make kimchi.)

2188
01:32:18,100 --> 01:32:20,439
(We can do this, right?)

2189
01:32:20,670 --> 01:32:23,979
I have the recipes for kimchi and kkakdugi.

2190
01:32:24,340 --> 01:32:25,779
(The recipes are given to the novice kimchi-makers.)

2191
01:32:25,779 --> 01:32:28,079
We also have a recipe for the moist suyuk.

2192
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:31,720
We can make kimchi on one side and kkakdugi on the other side.

2193
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:33,119
- Yes. - Sounds good.

2194
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:36,720
Raise your hands if you're good at cooking.

2195
01:32:36,989 --> 01:32:38,960
- JUNSEO. He can cook. - Do you know how to cook?

2196
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:40,960
- JUNSEO can cook. - I like cooking.

2197
01:32:41,489 --> 01:32:43,060
And I like kimchi.

2198
01:32:44,359 --> 01:32:46,829
What does that have to do with making kimchi?

2199
01:32:46,829 --> 01:32:48,329
- That might come in handy. - Right.

2200
01:32:48,329 --> 01:32:49,569
- You can taste it. - Yes.

2201
01:32:49,569 --> 01:32:50,770
- For the seasoning. - I might be able to tell...

2202
01:32:50,770 --> 01:32:51,970
what's missing when I taste it.

2203
01:32:51,970 --> 01:32:53,239
I could figure that out.

2204
01:32:53,569 --> 01:32:56,279
(Team MINWOOK will make kimchi.)

2205
01:32:56,739 --> 01:32:59,550
(Team JUNSEO will make kkakdugi.)

2206
01:32:59,779 --> 01:33:02,779
Then let's make suyuk first.

2207
01:33:02,779 --> 01:33:03,920
- It takes a long time. - Suyuk...

2208
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:05,020
One person from each team should...

2209
01:33:05,020 --> 01:33:06,750
I'll cook it. I'll volunteer from my team.

2210
01:33:06,750 --> 01:33:07,989
From your team, can JUNWON join me?

2211
01:33:07,989 --> 01:33:09,720
- Sure. Honey. - Honey.

2212
01:33:09,720 --> 01:33:10,720
- Okay. - Yes.

2213
01:33:10,859 --> 01:33:14,529
(JUNSEO and JUNWON will cook suyuk.)

2214
01:33:15,060 --> 01:33:17,430
"Put 1.2kg of pork shoulder in the big pot."

2215
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:20,430
(Putting in the pork shoulder first)

2216
01:33:20,430 --> 01:33:21,500
I did it.

2217
01:33:22,229 --> 01:33:23,699
You did? Good job.

2218
01:33:24,100 --> 01:33:25,140
- And... - I'll do the sauce.

2219
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:28,369
I need half an onion. Great.

2220
01:33:28,770 --> 01:33:31,380
(Things are going smoothly according to the recipe.)

2221
01:33:31,609 --> 01:33:32,680
Garlic.

2222
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:34,550
Let me crush the garlic a little bit.

2223
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:37,449
- No, don't crush it. - I like crushed garlic.

2224
01:33:37,779 --> 01:33:39,119
Honey, trust me on this.

2225
01:33:39,119 --> 01:33:40,550
We don't need crushed garlic.

2226
01:33:40,550 --> 01:33:41,720
- We need garlic cloves. - We can add crushed garlic.

2227
01:33:41,720 --> 01:33:43,119
I've had suyuk too.

2228
01:33:43,159 --> 01:33:44,560
- Honey. - Just follow the recipe.

2229
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:45,729
Why won't you follow it?

2230
01:33:47,930 --> 01:33:49,930
(Adding doenjang and water like the recipe says)

2231
01:33:49,930 --> 01:33:52,000
- Great. We're doing so well. - Yes.

2232
01:33:52,470 --> 01:33:54,229
- I already added... - It already looks tasty.

2233
01:33:54,529 --> 01:33:55,630
Perfect.

2234
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:57,100
(The perfect suyuk is ready to be cooked.)

2235
01:33:57,670 --> 01:33:58,970
I'll turn on the stove.

2236
01:33:58,970 --> 01:34:00,210
(What will happen to the suyuk prepared by JUNSEO and JUNWON?)

2237
01:34:00,670 --> 01:34:01,739
(Meanwhile, non-Korean trainees are new to making kimchi.)

2238
01:34:01,739 --> 01:34:02,810
What's this?

2239
01:34:04,180 --> 01:34:06,409
- I have no idea. - Be careful not to hurt yourselves.

2240
01:34:06,409 --> 01:34:07,510
What's this?

2241
01:34:08,050 --> 01:34:09,050
Fish sauce?

2242
01:34:09,050 --> 01:34:10,050
(They're full of questions.)

2243
01:34:10,050 --> 01:34:11,420
- This? - Yes.

2244
01:34:11,550 --> 01:34:12,619
I see.

2245
01:34:13,020 --> 01:34:14,750
So we have to cut them now.

2246
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:16,789
We have to cut and salt them.

2247
01:34:16,989 --> 01:34:18,119
What does that mean?

2248
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:19,729
- Salting them... - Yes.

2249
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:22,430
(How should I explain this?)

2250
01:34:22,930 --> 01:34:25,100
- We put them in saltwater. - Saltwater.

2251
01:34:25,399 --> 01:34:27,100
We soak them in the water.

2252
01:34:27,270 --> 01:34:28,699
- I see. Okay. - That's it.

2253
01:34:28,869 --> 01:34:30,140
We have to make them look like these.

2254
01:34:30,399 --> 01:34:31,399
Okay.

2255
01:34:31,539 --> 01:34:33,239
- Give me your hands, KOTARO. - Okay.

2256
01:34:33,909 --> 01:34:35,979
Sprinkle them between the leaves.

2257
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:38,739
I hope there's kimchi that's not too spicy.

2258
01:34:39,779 --> 01:34:41,109
Do people do this kind of thing at home?

2259
01:34:41,109 --> 01:34:42,550
Do you guys make natto at home?

2260
01:34:42,649 --> 01:34:44,750
No. We don't do that.

2261
01:34:44,750 --> 01:34:45,920
Families don't cook like this?

2262
01:34:46,020 --> 01:34:48,550
As big as the 50-cent coin. Cut it into bite-sized pieces.

2263
01:34:48,989 --> 01:34:50,489
Cube it in the shape of kkakdugi.

2264
01:34:50,890 --> 01:34:52,960
- JUNSEO knows how to cook. - Like this.

2265
01:34:53,430 --> 01:34:55,829
The pear... We have to wash it.

2266
01:34:56,460 --> 01:34:57,600
- Wash it now. - I'll wash it.

2267
01:34:58,260 --> 01:34:59,729
Then we have to peel it.

2268
01:35:00,170 --> 01:35:01,729
But I can't peel the pear.

2269
01:35:01,729 --> 01:35:02,869
Gosh, I'll do it.

2270
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:05,970
(Peeling)

2271
01:35:05,970 --> 01:35:07,569
- SIHUN. - Yes?

2272
01:35:07,739 --> 01:35:09,239
What about the glutinous rice paste?

2273
01:35:09,579 --> 01:35:10,939
I'll make that.

2274
01:35:11,979 --> 01:35:14,109
(Stirring)

2275
01:35:15,250 --> 01:35:16,479
(He's working out his arm a lot especially today.)

2276
01:35:16,479 --> 01:35:18,550
- Stir it. - My arm muscles...

2277
01:35:20,789 --> 01:35:22,050
So let me tell you.

2278
01:35:22,689 --> 01:35:24,060
- We have to blend only the pear. - Okay.

2279
01:35:24,119 --> 01:35:26,689
- We have to mix the rest. - I already did it. Right.

2280
01:35:27,029 --> 01:35:29,229
- Four cups. I'll do it. - Yes. Four tablespoons.

2281
01:35:29,529 --> 01:35:30,560
Put them on.

2282
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:32,829
(SIHUN ends up making the sauce too.)

2283
01:35:32,829 --> 01:35:34,270
- Do you need help? - By the way,

2284
01:35:34,270 --> 01:35:36,340
from what I know, we have to add julienned radishes into this.

2285
01:35:36,340 --> 01:35:37,640
- Right. - That's right.

2286
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:39,140
- Really? Okay. - Now?

2287
01:35:39,270 --> 01:35:40,569
- No, we have... - I want to try it out.

2288
01:35:40,569 --> 01:35:42,340
- What? - Give me a chance too.

2289
01:35:43,109 --> 01:35:44,810
Gosh, I'm so good at cutting this.

2290
01:35:46,380 --> 01:35:48,409
I didn't use any tools.

2291
01:35:48,550 --> 01:35:51,149
I only used a knife to cut these radishes.

2292
01:35:52,279 --> 01:35:55,420
(He began to feel proud of his radishes after this.)

2293
01:35:55,890 --> 01:35:57,020
- Should I add the radishes? - Add them?

2294
01:35:57,020 --> 01:35:58,119
- Go ahead. - Add them?

2295
01:35:58,119 --> 01:35:59,659
Hey, did you cut two radishes?

2296
01:35:59,989 --> 01:36:01,189
We didn't finish cutting two radishes yet.

2297
01:36:01,659 --> 01:36:03,399
Hey, that's too much.

2298
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:05,229
- Hold on. Stop adding them. - Why?

2299
01:36:05,460 --> 01:36:07,930
Should we stop? No, but kimchi should have a lot of radishes.

2300
01:36:08,430 --> 01:36:09,569
Should I cut more radishes?

2301
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:10,670
No, we're good.

2302
01:36:10,670 --> 01:36:12,939
But you don't have any radishes left.

2303
01:36:15,609 --> 01:36:17,310
- I think we need more radishes. - Okay.

2304
01:36:20,149 --> 01:36:22,350
(Quietly sighing)

2305
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:24,520
(Adding more radishes with the slicer)

2306
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:25,819
- But listen. - Be careful with your fingers.

2307
01:36:25,819 --> 01:36:27,319
- This way, it will take forever. - Okay.

2308
01:36:28,619 --> 01:36:29,819
(Then we can do it this way.)

2309
01:36:29,819 --> 01:36:30,859
Great.

2310
01:36:31,090 --> 01:36:33,130
- That's good. That's enough. - We don't have one.

2311
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:36,460
The recipe said we must add two radishes, but we didn't.

2312
01:36:36,829 --> 01:36:38,899
- No. We have enough. - Tell me. Should I cut it or not?

2313
01:36:38,899 --> 01:36:40,529
- No, we have enough radishes. - I only need two minutes.

2314
01:36:41,199 --> 01:36:43,140
Don't you think we need more radishes?

2315
01:36:43,140 --> 01:36:44,369
- We need more radishes. - We must add more.

2316
01:36:44,369 --> 01:36:46,109
- We must add more radishes. - Let's add more.

2317
01:36:46,109 --> 01:36:48,109
- Hey. We'll only add the radishes. - We need them.

2318
01:36:48,109 --> 01:36:50,279
I understand now why our parents always said...

2319
01:36:50,539 --> 01:36:52,310
"Don't do anything. That's helping me."

2320
01:36:52,310 --> 01:36:53,479
- That's how it feels, right? - Not doing anything...

2321
01:36:53,649 --> 01:36:55,380
"Don't do anything. That's helping me."

2322
01:36:55,380 --> 01:36:56,550
- That's how it feels, right? - Not doing anything...

2323
01:36:56,550 --> 01:36:57,750
I get why they said that now.

2324
01:36:59,289 --> 01:37:02,659
(Stop fighting now. It's time to work.)

2325
01:37:03,189 --> 01:37:04,319
I think this is salt.

2326
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:06,130
No.

2327
01:37:06,130 --> 01:37:07,560
(He tastes it to figure out the ingredient.)

2328
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:08,829
It is salt.

2329
01:37:09,960 --> 01:37:13,170
(They make sure to taste the sauce from time to time too.)

2330
01:37:14,569 --> 01:37:16,300
No, scallions will make it tasty.

2331
01:37:16,300 --> 01:37:17,369
(The sauces for the kimchi are almost ready.)

2332
01:37:17,369 --> 01:37:19,340
I think we need to mix radishes with this now.

2333
01:37:19,770 --> 01:37:21,909
- All right. Team Kimchi, come here. - Should we join you?

2334
01:37:22,539 --> 01:37:24,010
(We'll finally get to mix them.)

2335
01:37:24,010 --> 01:37:26,380
We'll finally get to spread the sauce.

2336
01:37:26,380 --> 01:37:27,479
(Now, this feels like a real kimchi-making session.)

2337
01:37:27,710 --> 01:37:29,449
- All right. Put on the gloves. - What's this?

2338
01:37:29,680 --> 01:37:30,979
- Why is there water here? - I'm hot.

2339
01:37:30,979 --> 01:37:32,250
Take a look at this, KOTARO.

2340
01:37:32,250 --> 01:37:33,819
- Okay. - This is how you do it.

2341
01:37:34,250 --> 01:37:35,350
Just like this.

2342
01:37:35,449 --> 01:37:37,789
Get a handful of the sauce first.

2343
01:37:37,890 --> 01:37:39,460
Then spread it on the napa cabbage.

2344
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:42,960
But before we do that, let's taste one.

2345
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:44,930
We have to taste it with the tiny leaf here.

2346
01:37:44,930 --> 01:37:46,430
(Tasting it while making kimchi is a must.)

2347
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:47,930
It's too salty.

2348
01:37:49,340 --> 01:37:50,539
Do you want to try it, KOTARO?

2349
01:37:50,739 --> 01:37:52,039
- Yes. - It's so salty.

2350
01:37:53,439 --> 01:37:54,640
- It's big. - Okay.

2351
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:56,340
(How does their first kimchi taste?)

2352
01:37:57,079 --> 01:37:58,279
How is it? Is it salty?

2353
01:37:59,079 --> 01:38:01,109
- Yes, it is salty. - It's salty?

2354
01:38:01,109 --> 01:38:02,210
Yes. A bit.

2355
01:38:02,949 --> 01:38:04,819
We should remove some of the sauce.

2356
01:38:05,579 --> 01:38:06,619
Here we go.

2357
01:38:06,619 --> 01:38:07,890
(Team Kkakdugi will start mixing the radishes with the sauce too.)

2358
01:38:07,890 --> 01:38:10,460
Team Kkakdugi, we're ready too. Come here, everyone.

2359
01:38:10,689 --> 01:38:13,260
- We're ready too. - It's ready.

2360
01:38:13,859 --> 01:38:16,000
This is how your parents make kimchi like this at home?

2361
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,029
- Yes. - Yes.

2362
01:38:17,029 --> 01:38:18,060
But we do a lot more than this.

2363
01:38:18,060 --> 01:38:20,100
- So triple the portion. - Really?

2364
01:38:20,470 --> 01:38:21,869
It's harder than I thought.

2365
01:38:21,869 --> 01:38:23,239
It must've been tough on the parents.

2366
01:38:25,199 --> 01:38:26,770
(The kkakdugi reminds him of their parents.)

2367
01:38:26,770 --> 01:38:28,310
(How does kkakdugi taste?)

2368
01:38:28,609 --> 01:38:29,710
Is it good?

2369
01:38:30,579 --> 01:38:31,909
Yes. It's good. But...

2370
01:38:32,210 --> 01:38:34,449
But it's missing something.

2371
01:38:34,449 --> 01:38:35,510
It's a bit bland, right?

2372
01:38:35,710 --> 01:38:38,050
(WU CHENYU has a bite too.)

2373
01:38:38,920 --> 01:38:41,119
Wait. It's bland.

2374
01:38:41,119 --> 01:38:42,689
- It's slightly bland, right? - Yes.

2375
01:38:43,159 --> 01:38:45,560
Yours is salty. Ours is bland.

2376
01:38:45,560 --> 01:38:47,760
- Hey, let's mix our sauces. - Really?

2377
01:38:48,029 --> 01:38:49,260
- Can I taste it... - Ours is...

2378
01:38:49,260 --> 01:38:50,500
- Sure. - to see how salty it is?

2379
01:38:51,829 --> 01:38:53,800
- Let me tear one for you. - You did a good job with that.

2380
01:38:56,470 --> 01:38:58,500
By the way, pork cutlets and kimchi go well together.

2381
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:01,069
- I've never heard of that combo. - I mean it.

2382
01:39:01,210 --> 01:39:02,539
Pork cutlets and kimchi?

2383
01:39:02,539 --> 01:39:05,279
Not the Japanese pork cutlets.

2384
01:39:05,279 --> 01:39:06,609
I'm talking about the Western pork cutlets.

2385
01:39:06,609 --> 01:39:07,949
- The Western pork cutlets. - The Western pork cutlets...

2386
01:39:07,949 --> 01:39:10,380
- Pork cutlets and kimchi? - Are they good together?

2387
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:11,979
I don't know.

2388
01:39:12,250 --> 01:39:14,020
Did you know people have sweet potatoes with kimchi?

2389
01:39:14,020 --> 01:39:15,220
That's a tasty combo.

2390
01:39:15,220 --> 01:39:16,390
(That combo is bound to be tasty.)

2391
01:39:16,390 --> 01:39:17,520
I haven't heard about that in a while.

2392
01:39:17,819 --> 01:39:20,529
Sweet potatoes are best with kimchi. That's right.

2393
01:39:20,529 --> 01:39:21,560
The nostalgic combo.

2394
01:39:24,100 --> 01:39:25,359
(That sounds really good.)

2395
01:39:25,359 --> 01:39:26,569
That sounds so good.

2396
01:39:26,569 --> 01:39:28,569
So you guys know about the combo. I thought you wouldn't.

2397
01:39:28,829 --> 01:39:31,140
I wasn't going to mention it because I thought you didn't know.

2398
01:39:31,300 --> 01:39:32,539
Actually, instead of that,

2399
01:39:32,539 --> 01:39:33,970
I like sweet potato pork cutlets with kimchi.

2400
01:39:36,010 --> 01:39:38,609
- We need some meat. - I've never heard of the combo.

2401
01:39:38,710 --> 01:39:39,949
- We should try it. - You don't know that combo?

2402
01:39:39,949 --> 01:39:41,750
You should try it. I haven't had it either.

2403
01:39:41,750 --> 01:39:43,250
I see. Let's try it together then.

2404
01:39:43,949 --> 01:39:45,880
(Whatever it is, you can enjoy meals as long as there's kimchi.)

2405
01:39:45,989 --> 01:39:47,689
Hey. This guy...

2406
01:39:48,189 --> 01:39:49,560
I have something to share with you guys.

2407
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:52,390
He and I were talking about disposable towels.

2408
01:39:52,390 --> 01:39:55,260
He said, "Should I try using disposable towels?"

2409
01:39:55,260 --> 01:39:56,930
So I told him that BINGHUA used them...

2410
01:39:56,930 --> 01:39:59,399
and I was planning to bring some this time around.

2411
01:39:59,399 --> 01:40:02,529
Then he said, "But are disposable towels really necessary?"

2412
01:40:02,529 --> 01:40:04,340
"How many towels do you use?" He asked me that.

2413
01:40:04,539 --> 01:40:06,840
I said, "Don't you use one towel a day?"

2414
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:09,439
He said, "Really? I use 1 towel every 3 days."

2415
01:40:09,739 --> 01:40:10,739
- What? - I'm serious.

2416
01:40:10,739 --> 01:40:12,949
(SIHUN only lasts 3 days with 1 towel?)

2417
01:40:13,010 --> 01:40:15,010
Come on. What's wrong with you?

2418
01:40:15,109 --> 01:40:17,020
- Gosh, that's not cool. - Come on.

2419
01:40:17,050 --> 01:40:18,149
- Listen. - That's dirty.

2420
01:40:19,449 --> 01:40:20,789
You dry it.

2421
01:40:21,119 --> 01:40:22,789
Using it only once is a waste.

2422
01:40:22,890 --> 01:40:24,760
- Come on. - Let's say you use it once.

2423
01:40:25,159 --> 01:40:26,930
Then you use it again that night.

2424
01:40:27,630 --> 01:40:30,000
You hang the towel you use overnight.

2425
01:40:30,359 --> 01:40:31,630
- Gosh. - You dry it.

2426
01:40:31,630 --> 01:40:32,770
Hanging it in the air...

2427
01:40:32,770 --> 01:40:33,899
- doesn't make it clean. - So...

2428
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:36,069
Using it only once is a waste.

2429
01:40:36,170 --> 01:40:39,039
This is his logic. Even if he used it several times to wipe,

2430
01:40:39,039 --> 01:40:41,340
it's fine since he used it to wipe clean water.

2431
01:40:41,340 --> 01:40:42,810
- Then for him, - That's it. Right?

2432
01:40:42,810 --> 01:40:44,279
let's say a training session lasts two weeks.

2433
01:40:44,279 --> 01:40:46,010
- You'd only need four towels. - No.

2434
01:40:46,909 --> 01:40:48,180
Once in the morning and once in the evening.

2435
01:40:48,180 --> 01:40:49,250
So for three days,

2436
01:40:49,250 --> 01:40:51,579
- If he uses it for 3 days... - you use the same towel 6 times.

2437
01:40:51,579 --> 01:40:52,619
That's good.

2438
01:40:52,619 --> 01:40:54,250
Are there any other secrets to expose?

2439
01:40:54,250 --> 01:40:56,319
- I want something new. - I have one.

2440
01:40:56,760 --> 01:40:59,020
In the middle of the night at the dorm,

2441
01:40:59,020 --> 01:41:00,659
I heard a sound coming from the center of the lobby,

2442
01:41:00,659 --> 01:41:02,060
so I went out to see.

2443
01:41:02,060 --> 01:41:03,260
I saw something shocking.

2444
01:41:04,329 --> 01:41:07,970
(What happened at the dorm in the middle of the night?)

2445
01:41:08,770 --> 01:41:11,199
- He dances. He does that every day. - So...

2446
01:41:11,199 --> 01:41:13,210
- Right. - That's right.

2447
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:15,539
CHENYU started dancing like this all of a sudden.

2448
01:41:15,539 --> 01:41:16,939
(Swaying)

2449
01:41:17,109 --> 01:41:18,340
I was shocked.

2450
01:41:18,739 --> 01:41:21,210
- It was CHENYU and ATILLA. - ATILLA.

2451
01:41:21,479 --> 01:41:23,319
- It was him and CHENYU. - He was lying down on the floor.

2452
01:41:23,319 --> 01:41:24,550
He had his leg up like this.

2453
01:41:24,550 --> 01:41:25,920
He was screaming like this too.

2454
01:41:26,149 --> 01:41:28,289
He dances to the songs of girl groups for 20 minutes.

2455
01:41:28,289 --> 01:41:29,489
He comes back after dancing for 20 minutes.

2456
01:41:29,689 --> 01:41:32,760
- He dances to "RUN" as waacking. - That's so true.

2457
01:41:32,829 --> 01:41:34,390
(FONG ATILLA and WU CHENYU)

2458
01:41:34,829 --> 01:41:37,359
(The waacking version of "RUN")

2459
01:41:38,729 --> 01:41:41,130
(Watching them dance from the 2nd floor)

2460
01:41:41,569 --> 01:41:43,569
(Sparks go off)

2461
01:41:47,539 --> 01:41:50,479
(He can't stop dancing. He dances with YURA.)

2462
01:41:52,439 --> 01:41:54,680
It's 3am right now.

2463
01:41:55,909 --> 01:41:58,649
(They can't stop dancing even late at night.)

2464
01:42:02,220 --> 01:42:04,590
He becomes someone else at night.

2465
01:42:05,060 --> 01:42:06,289
- But ATILLA... - You've never shared...

2466
01:42:06,289 --> 01:42:07,289
a room with ATILLA,

2467
01:42:07,289 --> 01:42:08,289
- so you don't know. Right? - Right.

2468
01:42:08,289 --> 01:42:10,399
- Seriously. - ATILLA and CHENYU are the best.

2469
01:42:10,399 --> 01:42:11,399
I mean it.

2470
01:42:11,399 --> 01:42:12,600
- You must watch their concert. - Thank you.

2471
01:42:15,170 --> 01:42:16,899
Filming the video journal...

2472
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,100
- Right. That's... - Let me check on the suyuk.

2473
01:42:19,100 --> 01:42:20,840
(He suddenly remembers the suyuk.)

2474
01:42:21,170 --> 01:42:23,010
- It's all cooked. - Wait. This...

2475
01:42:23,510 --> 01:42:25,840
(He slices the nicely cooked suyuk.)

2476
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:27,909
Gosh, the suyuk is nice and tender. This is crazy.

2477
01:42:28,380 --> 01:42:30,420
I want to have it with the kimchi right away.

2478
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:31,920
That looks really good.

2479
01:42:33,119 --> 01:42:34,720
But MINWOOK keeps on eating that.

2480
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:35,720
No.

2481
01:42:36,119 --> 01:42:37,989
MINWOOK, wait and have it with the meat.

2482
01:42:38,689 --> 01:42:40,060
It's like today is his birthday.

2483
01:42:42,329 --> 01:42:44,829
(YONGHYUN and JUNSEO slice the suyuk.)

2484
01:42:45,859 --> 01:42:48,430
(Beautifully placing the meat on a plate)

2485
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:50,739
- Doesn't it look good like this? - That's perfect.

2486
01:42:50,739 --> 01:42:51,770
That's nice.

2487
01:42:52,170 --> 01:42:54,010
Let me put some of the filling here.

2488
01:42:54,609 --> 01:42:56,810
(Not to lose out, Team Kkakdugi plates theirs too.)

2489
01:42:56,939 --> 01:42:58,710
Do people have suyuk with kkakdugi?

2490
01:43:00,380 --> 01:43:02,409
(They finish making kkakdugi and kimchi.)

2491
01:43:02,409 --> 01:43:03,479
- That looks really good. - Gosh.

2492
01:43:04,420 --> 01:43:07,590
(Kimchi and kkakdugi look quite tasty.)

2493
01:43:07,649 --> 01:43:09,659
We're done. Can we eat now?

2494
01:43:10,760 --> 01:43:13,460
All right. I'll feed you just like how moms used to feed kids.

2495
01:43:14,359 --> 01:43:16,229
This is a big piece of meat. You need a big piece of kimchi too.

2496
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:19,100
- He can't eat it in one bite. - My gosh.

2497
01:43:19,359 --> 01:43:21,100
- Can you eat it in one go? - Not really.

2498
01:43:21,300 --> 01:43:22,329
He's eating the whole thing.

2499
01:43:23,869 --> 01:43:24,970
This is like green onion kimchi.

2500
01:43:24,970 --> 01:43:26,100
(MINWOOK has a bite of the meat.)

2501
01:43:26,539 --> 01:43:28,810
Personally, I'm not a big fan of kkakdugi.

2502
01:43:29,579 --> 01:43:30,609
- It's salty. - It is.

2503
01:43:30,609 --> 01:43:33,710
(Just like MINWOOK, JOOHYUN eats them separately.)

2504
01:43:35,449 --> 01:43:39,789
(It's tastier because they made it themselves.)

2505
01:43:39,789 --> 01:43:40,920
He has a big mouth.

2506
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:42,989
I became attached to this.

2507
01:43:44,319 --> 01:43:45,390
This is tasty.

2508
01:43:46,630 --> 01:43:51,560
(He can't stop eating the kimchi he made.)

2509
01:43:53,270 --> 01:43:55,500
(Munching)

2510
01:43:55,670 --> 01:43:57,970
Does anyone need kimchi? Should I wrap it up?

2511
01:43:58,270 --> 01:43:59,470
I got it from here.

2512
01:43:59,970 --> 01:44:00,970
Thank you.

2513
01:44:00,970 --> 01:44:02,609
(Packing up the kimchi to take home)

2514
01:44:04,510 --> 01:44:07,250
The radishes aren't spicy at all. How interesting.

2515
01:44:07,350 --> 01:44:08,810
You like food that's not spicy.

2516
01:44:08,810 --> 01:44:09,819
Right.

2517
01:44:10,149 --> 01:44:12,550
The radishes absorb the sauce.

2518
01:44:13,149 --> 01:44:21,090
(They made one more memory today.)

2519
01:44:21,430 --> 01:44:24,029
(Their chaotic kimchi-making session is over!)

2520
01:44:24,430 --> 01:44:26,829
This is the 3rd Passing Ceremony of PROJECT 7.

2521
01:44:27,069 --> 01:44:29,869
The rankings between 10th and 20th places voted...

2522
01:44:30,140 --> 01:44:35,069
by the World Assemblers have been announced.

2523
01:44:35,409 --> 01:44:38,380
Only ten spots remain now.

2524
01:44:38,539 --> 01:44:40,779
Some of the trainees whose names haven't been called...

2525
01:44:41,149 --> 01:44:43,520
may be placed from 1st place to 9th places...

2526
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:46,489
as well as 21st place.

2527
01:44:48,020 --> 01:44:50,520
The debut team will be placed in the center. That's cool.

2528
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:52,789
Who will be ranked 21st?

2529
01:44:53,390 --> 01:44:54,460
We're close.

2530
01:44:57,829 --> 01:45:00,399
I will now announce the trainee...

2531
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:02,800
in seventh place.

2532
01:45:03,170 --> 01:45:04,640
He'll start with seventh place?

2533
01:45:04,840 --> 01:45:06,939
Before I reveal the trainee in seventh place,

2534
01:45:07,239 --> 01:45:10,109
The three candidates for seventh place...

2535
01:45:10,109 --> 01:45:11,810
will be revealed on the screen.

2536
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:14,210
He will reveal 7th, 8th, and 9th places respectively then.

2537
01:45:14,510 --> 01:45:16,550
I hope he just reveals the names without any delay.

2538
01:45:17,420 --> 01:45:19,949
It's important to see the candidates for this group.

2539
01:45:19,949 --> 01:45:21,020
- Right. - A candidate for seventh place?

2540
01:45:21,020 --> 01:45:22,090
MAJINGXIANG.

2541
01:45:22,890 --> 01:45:25,789
(7th place, MAJINGXIANG, Week 6 ranking)

2542
01:45:26,119 --> 01:45:27,829
NAM JIWOON, KIM SUNGMIN,

2543
01:45:28,829 --> 01:45:29,859
and KIM SIHUN.

2544
01:45:30,229 --> 01:45:31,529
I get the feeling I'll be here.

2545
01:45:31,529 --> 01:45:32,859
(9th place, KIM SIHUN, Week 6 ranking)

2546
01:45:32,859 --> 01:45:34,500
Won't it be KIM SUNGMIN?

2547
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:35,930
He was ranked ninth last week.

2548
01:45:36,329 --> 01:45:37,539
- I bet JIWOON's ranking went up. - So...

2549
01:45:37,539 --> 01:45:39,670
(8th place, NAM JIWOON, Week 8 ranking)

2550
01:45:39,710 --> 01:45:40,840
I get the feeling HYUNWOO might be one of them.

2551
01:45:41,470 --> 01:45:44,039
(13th place, KIM HYUNWOO, Week 6 ranking)

2552
01:45:44,939 --> 01:45:46,310
Reveal them now.

2553
01:45:49,680 --> 01:45:51,180
- Who will they be? - Ta-da.

2554
01:45:51,720 --> 01:45:53,289
- One, two, three. - There.

2555
01:45:53,619 --> 01:45:55,119
- I think JIWOON climbed up. - Right.

2556
01:45:55,119 --> 01:45:56,590
He got 50,000 points as the benefit.

2557
01:46:00,289 --> 01:46:01,890
- SUNGMIN? - Ta-da.

2558
01:46:01,890 --> 01:46:02,960
It might be one of them.

2559
01:46:05,359 --> 01:46:06,770
His ranking went up.

2560
01:46:06,770 --> 01:46:07,770
- Oh, my. - Ta-da.

2561
01:46:12,770 --> 01:46:14,109
YEOJUN? Hold on.

2562
01:46:16,039 --> 01:46:17,180
- There's YEOJUN. - YEOJUN?

2563
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:19,979
Didn't YEOJUN rank fourth before?

2564
01:46:20,550 --> 01:46:22,850
- My gosh, YEOJUN. - That's...

2565
01:46:24,220 --> 01:46:26,180
- Gosh, it's SIHUN. - I told you.

2566
01:46:31,319 --> 01:46:33,090
Mr. NAM JIWOON. Lighten up.

2567
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:39,970
How many times will he be included as a candidate?

2568
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:41,829
What about me?

2569
01:46:42,829 --> 01:46:43,840
Your ranking probably went up.

2570
01:46:45,439 --> 01:46:47,909
The benefit played a huge role. Anything could happen.

2571
01:46:48,739 --> 01:46:51,340
The candidates for seventh place are...

2572
01:46:51,739 --> 01:46:56,350
KIM SIHUN, NAM JIWOON, and JANG YEOJUN.

2573
01:46:56,680 --> 01:47:00,090
Which 1 of the trainees will win 7th place...

2574
01:47:00,090 --> 01:47:02,520
and be included in the Top Seven?

2575
01:47:02,989 --> 01:47:04,489
I have no idea, seriously.

2576
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:08,390
I think JIWOON will rank seventh place.

2577
01:47:08,590 --> 01:47:10,100
Right. He got the benefit.

2578
01:47:10,359 --> 01:47:11,800
YEOJUN too.

2579
01:47:11,960 --> 01:47:14,899
- The 10-percent is huge. - The 10-percent.

2580
01:47:15,100 --> 01:47:17,600
All right. Among these three trainees,

2581
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:19,939
I will reveal the trainee in ninth place first.

2582
01:47:19,939 --> 01:47:22,270
(The 3rd Passing Ceremony, 9th place)

2583
01:47:22,510 --> 01:47:25,409
This trainee received a global voting score...

2584
01:47:25,409 --> 01:47:28,449
- of 1,605,578 points. - Did he say 1.6 million points?

2585
01:47:29,180 --> 01:47:30,319
It's 1.6 million points?

2586
01:47:32,319 --> 01:47:34,750
I think it might be SIHUN.

2587
01:47:35,390 --> 01:47:36,420
You might maintain your ranking.

2588
01:47:36,489 --> 01:47:39,489
My ranking has been going down.

2589
01:47:39,489 --> 01:47:42,090
I was a bit worried.

2590
01:47:42,090 --> 01:47:44,229
I don't have any benefits.

2591
01:47:44,229 --> 01:47:45,300
I don't think I can climb up.

2592
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:47,869
I'll wait for you there. Catch up.

2593
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:49,770
It's unsure for YEOJUN.

2594
01:47:49,770 --> 01:47:51,270
The ten-percent benefit is huge.

2595
01:47:51,939 --> 01:47:54,069
I didn't get any benefit. But you...

2596
01:47:54,340 --> 01:47:56,680
I didn't receive any benefit.

2597
01:47:57,109 --> 01:47:59,039
I thought my ranking probably went down.

2598
01:47:59,039 --> 01:48:00,949
I didn't have any expectations.

2599
01:48:03,880 --> 01:48:05,819
When the three of us were on the screen,

2600
01:48:05,819 --> 01:48:07,949
I was the only one with the benefit.

2601
01:48:07,949 --> 01:48:10,960
Since I ranked eighth last time,

2602
01:48:11,090 --> 01:48:12,890
I wanted to be in the Top Seven...

2603
01:48:12,890 --> 01:48:15,159
and establish my spot on the debut team.

2604
01:48:15,729 --> 01:48:16,800
Who could it be?

2605
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:19,329
The trainee in ninth place is...

2606
01:48:21,699 --> 01:48:23,800
NAM JIWOON.

2607
01:48:23,800 --> 01:48:26,810
(9th place, NAM JIWOON)

2608
01:48:26,810 --> 01:48:28,770
NAM JIWOON.

2609
01:48:30,039 --> 01:48:31,380
But he got the benefit points.

2610
01:48:32,609 --> 01:48:34,579
NAM JIWOON.

2611
01:48:34,579 --> 01:48:36,180
JIWOON is in ninth place?

2612
01:48:37,949 --> 01:48:38,979
Congratulations.

2613
01:48:40,390 --> 01:48:42,520
Gosh. He got the ten-percent benefit points too.

2614
01:48:44,489 --> 01:48:46,289
His ranking must've gone down because they could vote for three.

2615
01:48:47,789 --> 01:48:50,600
It's so unpredictable. It's impossible to guess.

2616
01:48:51,260 --> 01:48:52,430
Will SIHUN be back on the debut team?

2617
01:48:53,699 --> 01:48:56,399
Trainee NAM JIWOON displayed improved facial expressions...

2618
01:48:56,399 --> 01:48:59,569
and gestures while performing "Merry-Go-Round."

2619
01:48:59,569 --> 01:49:01,939
He was in better control of his performance this time around.

2620
01:49:01,939 --> 01:49:04,340
As his team won the Original Matching,

2621
01:49:04,340 --> 01:49:05,380
he received...

2622
01:49:05,380 --> 01:49:07,250
an additional ten percent of his own global voting score...

2623
01:49:07,250 --> 01:49:09,750
as the benefit of the winning team.

2624
01:49:09,949 --> 01:49:12,880
His ranking went down by 1 from the 2nd Passing Ceremony.

2625
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:16,489
But he is still placed high.

2626
01:49:17,189 --> 01:49:19,890
He received over 100,000 benefit points.

2627
01:49:19,989 --> 01:49:21,460
- I see. Right. - But he still ranked ninth.

2628
01:49:22,489 --> 01:49:26,060
Today, I realized once again that getting into the Top Seven...

2629
01:49:26,060 --> 01:49:27,829
was a challenge.

2630
01:49:28,029 --> 01:49:31,199
Despite that, I would like to thank the World Assemblers...

2631
01:49:31,199 --> 01:49:34,409
who make it possible for me to maintain my high ranking.

2632
01:49:34,539 --> 01:49:36,609
Moreover, I would like to thank...

2633
01:49:36,609 --> 01:49:39,039
Team "Merry-Go-Round" who helped me get...

2634
01:49:39,039 --> 01:49:40,380
the benefit points.

2635
01:49:40,479 --> 01:49:43,880
We only have one more performance left.

2636
01:49:43,880 --> 01:49:47,149
I will work hard and give my all,

2637
01:49:47,149 --> 01:49:50,119
so that doesn't become my last performance.

2638
01:49:50,119 --> 01:49:51,159
Thank you.

2639
01:49:53,659 --> 01:49:56,189
- Take your spot, in ninth place. - Yes.

2640
01:49:56,699 --> 01:49:58,359
Seriously. JIWOON. I told you to do better.

2641
01:49:58,760 --> 01:50:00,569
- Work harder. - Okay.

2642
01:50:00,729 --> 01:50:01,770
I'm sorry.

2643
01:50:04,970 --> 01:50:06,100
But that must be tough for him too.

2644
01:50:07,140 --> 01:50:08,970
His ranking hasn't changed much from the beginning.

2645
01:50:09,510 --> 01:50:11,409
He keeps trying, but he's in the same spot.

2646
01:50:12,810 --> 01:50:16,350
Between Trainees JANG YEOJUN and KIM SIHUN,

2647
01:50:16,409 --> 01:50:19,449
one of them will be in the Top Seven.

2648
01:50:20,020 --> 01:50:23,890
I will now announce the trainee in seventh place.

2649
01:50:25,060 --> 01:50:26,090
That startled me.

2650
01:50:26,359 --> 01:50:29,130
If your name isn't called, it means you're in eighth place.

2651
01:50:29,260 --> 01:50:33,369
The trainee to take seventh place received...

2652
01:50:33,470 --> 01:50:40,140
a global voting score of 1,875,878 points.

2653
01:50:42,170 --> 01:50:43,270
That's on a different scale.

2654
01:50:43,739 --> 01:50:45,439
My gosh, that's a lot of points for seventh place.

2655
01:50:47,180 --> 01:50:48,409
Will it be SIHUN?

2656
01:50:48,779 --> 01:50:51,649
I would be more at ease if I'm in eighth place.

2657
01:50:52,949 --> 01:50:54,020
If I'm in seventh place...

2658
01:50:55,449 --> 01:50:57,560
Didn't YEOJUN rank 6th place in the 1st Passing Ceremony?

2659
01:50:57,789 --> 01:50:58,989
- Was it 4th or 3rd place? - The last time?

2660
01:50:58,989 --> 01:51:00,289
He had always been on the debut team.

2661
01:51:01,489 --> 01:51:03,399
(Which 1 of the 2 will advance to the top 7?)

2662
01:51:03,399 --> 01:51:04,430
I think it will be YEOJUN.

2663
01:51:05,529 --> 01:51:07,170
Trainee JANG YEOJUN.

2664
01:51:07,170 --> 01:51:08,170
(7th place, JANG YEOJUN)

2665
01:51:08,170 --> 01:51:09,199
Congratulations.

2666
01:51:09,770 --> 01:51:11,199
Trainee JANG YEOJUN.

2667
01:51:18,510 --> 01:51:20,050
Let's go, YEOJUN.

2668
01:51:20,810 --> 01:51:22,779
YEOJUN managed to stay on the debut team.

2669
01:51:23,149 --> 01:51:25,619
Trainee JANG YEOJUN was the youngest member in the team,

2670
01:51:25,619 --> 01:51:27,350
but without feeling intimidated,

2671
01:51:27,350 --> 01:51:29,789
he suggested various performance ideas...

2672
01:51:29,789 --> 01:51:32,420
and helped their practice be smooth sailing.

2673
01:51:32,420 --> 01:51:34,890
Of all the matches in this show,

2674
01:51:34,890 --> 01:51:37,329
this Original Matching was the toughest one for him.

2675
01:51:37,329 --> 01:51:39,130
As a result of racing ahead...

2676
01:51:39,130 --> 01:51:42,130
with his burning passion only for making a debut,

2677
01:51:42,130 --> 01:51:45,100
he gets to continue to chase his dream.

2678
01:51:45,100 --> 01:51:47,569
His rank is lower than the last time,

2679
01:51:47,569 --> 01:51:50,310
but he's still within the Top Seven trainees.

2680
01:51:50,310 --> 01:51:52,079
Only if he hadn't gotten cheeky with YICHEN,

2681
01:51:52,079 --> 01:51:53,239
he would've ranked higher.

2682
01:51:53,579 --> 01:51:55,649
First off, I'd like to take this chance...

2683
01:51:57,050 --> 01:52:01,520
to apologize to YICHEN once again.

2684
01:52:02,020 --> 01:52:04,220
He even treated me to a meal, you know.

2685
01:52:04,390 --> 01:52:06,359
I'll treat you next time, YICHEN.

2686
01:52:07,060 --> 01:52:08,760
I wanted to say this.

2687
01:52:08,760 --> 01:52:09,930
Where did you go?

2688
01:52:10,359 --> 01:52:11,560
A beef galbi restaurant.

2689
01:52:12,229 --> 01:52:14,829
From where I am...

2690
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:16,970
in my given situation, the only thing I can do...

2691
01:52:16,970 --> 01:52:19,439
is do the best I can.

2692
01:52:19,439 --> 01:52:22,409
I'm good at making effort,

2693
01:52:22,409 --> 01:52:24,140
so if you can count on me a little more,

2694
01:52:24,579 --> 01:52:26,109
I'll make sure we face each other with a smile...

2695
01:52:26,109 --> 01:52:29,909
at the end of this long journey.

2696
01:52:29,979 --> 01:52:33,420
I always feel sorry and grateful. And I love you all.

2697
01:52:33,590 --> 01:52:34,689
Thank you.

2698
01:52:37,859 --> 01:52:41,460
Trainee JANG YEOJUN, please sit on the seventh seat.

2699
01:52:43,159 --> 01:52:45,930
With just one final match left,

2700
01:52:46,060 --> 01:52:48,029
my rank got lower for the first time.

2701
01:52:48,029 --> 01:52:50,340
So I'm actually quite anxious.

2702
01:52:50,340 --> 01:52:54,210
I'm telling myself not to lose confidence.

2703
01:52:55,470 --> 01:52:59,039
Trainee KIM SIHUN is ranked eighth place.

2704
01:52:59,039 --> 01:53:00,310
(The 3rd Passing Ceremony, 8th place)

2705
01:53:02,149 --> 01:53:04,550
His rank rather got higher.

2706
01:53:04,819 --> 01:53:10,319
With a global voting score of 1,816,337,

2707
01:53:10,319 --> 01:53:13,859
he's ranked 8th place for the 3rd Passing Ceremony.

2708
01:53:14,260 --> 01:53:15,590
That's so close.

2709
01:53:15,590 --> 01:53:17,159
They have such a close difference.

2710
01:53:17,159 --> 01:53:20,729
This Original Matching was especially tough enough for him...

2711
01:53:20,729 --> 01:53:22,199
to want to give up.

2712
01:53:22,199 --> 01:53:24,340
He even showed tears once.

2713
01:53:24,340 --> 01:53:27,439
But he practiced to overcome his bad condition...

2714
01:53:27,439 --> 01:53:30,979
and pulled off the performance with his firm skills.

2715
01:53:31,579 --> 01:53:35,010
First off, I'm truly grateful to World Assemblers...

2716
01:53:35,010 --> 01:53:38,949
for giving me so many votes again.

2717
01:53:39,380 --> 01:53:41,989
Now, I've grown attached to so many trainees...

2718
01:53:41,989 --> 01:53:46,619
that I don't want to part ways with them.

2719
01:53:46,789 --> 01:53:50,159
I feel like I have to do harder for them...

2720
01:53:50,300 --> 01:53:52,000
when I move up to the finals.

2721
01:53:52,130 --> 01:53:55,829
And my 1st goal on PROJECT 7...

2722
01:53:55,829 --> 01:54:00,270
was to meet my fans in the final real-time broadcast.

2723
01:54:00,270 --> 01:54:03,779
I'm so happy that my wish is to come true.

2724
01:54:04,010 --> 01:54:05,140
Thank you.

2725
01:54:05,279 --> 01:54:06,279
SIHUN.

2726
01:54:10,180 --> 01:54:11,579
It requires so much to place seventh.

2727
01:54:11,579 --> 01:54:13,250
Even a score of 1.8 million is worth 8th place.

2728
01:54:13,689 --> 01:54:15,590
- We meet again here. - I know.

2729
01:54:17,359 --> 01:54:19,520
Maybe they should have us three-legged.

2730
01:54:20,930 --> 01:54:23,060
Let's move on.

2731
01:54:23,260 --> 01:54:26,699
From the sixth place, I'll announce one at a time.

2732
01:54:27,130 --> 01:54:29,069
(JANG YEOJUN, 6th, 5th, 4th, 3rd, 2nd, 1st)

2733
01:54:29,199 --> 01:54:31,039
The debuting candidates haven't changed.

2734
01:54:31,539 --> 01:54:33,569
MAJINGXIANG, SUNGMIN,

2735
01:54:34,069 --> 01:54:35,939
SEUNGHO, KYOUNGBAE,

2736
01:54:36,409 --> 01:54:38,409
KENSHIN, and MINWOOK.

2737
01:54:39,579 --> 01:54:41,409
From here, all of them received benefit points.

2738
01:54:41,680 --> 01:54:43,109
MINWOOK didn't.

2739
01:54:43,779 --> 01:54:46,250
Let me announce the sixth-place trainee.

2740
01:54:46,949 --> 01:54:49,090
This trainee is one of those who have been...

2741
01:54:49,090 --> 01:54:52,560
getting passionate support from World Assemblers...

2742
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:54,159
as PROJECT 7 continues.

2743
01:54:54,760 --> 01:54:55,789
SUNGMIN.

2744
01:54:55,789 --> 01:54:57,500
(9th place, KIM SUNGMIN, Week 8 ranking)

2745
01:54:57,829 --> 01:54:58,829
MAJINGXIANG

2746
01:54:58,829 --> 01:55:00,699
(7th place, MAJINGXIANG, Week 6 ranking)

2747
01:55:01,699 --> 01:55:02,869
Maybe it's SEUNGHO.

2748
01:55:02,869 --> 01:55:04,739
(5th place, SONG SEUNGHO, Week 6 ranking)

2749
01:55:05,539 --> 01:55:07,270
During this Original Matching,

2750
01:55:07,270 --> 01:55:09,810
he took charge of a rapping position.

2751
01:55:10,210 --> 01:55:12,010
KENSHIN and SEUNGHO are the only ones.

2752
01:55:14,250 --> 01:55:15,609
Calm down.

2753
01:55:15,750 --> 01:55:17,420
Did MAJINGXIANG rap?

2754
01:55:18,050 --> 01:55:19,319
He was a vocalist.

2755
01:55:20,319 --> 01:55:22,119
MINWOOK? He'll take this place all of a sudden?

2756
01:55:22,119 --> 01:55:23,250
No way.

2757
01:55:24,489 --> 01:55:25,789
I rapped.

2758
01:55:26,319 --> 01:55:27,689
This trainee received...

2759
01:55:28,029 --> 01:55:29,789
This is enough now.

2760
01:55:30,090 --> 01:55:32,000
This trainee received a global voting score of two...

2761
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:33,430
- It's two million. - Goodness.

2762
01:55:34,100 --> 01:55:37,899
Of 2,024,128.

2763
01:55:38,039 --> 01:55:40,640
That's more than a million votes higher than mine.

2764
01:55:41,840 --> 01:55:43,369
I rapped too.

2765
01:55:49,250 --> 01:55:51,279
- I should get ready to stand up... - Trainee SONG SEUNGHO.

2766
01:55:52,979 --> 01:55:54,250
Trainee SONG SEUNGHO.

2767
01:55:54,649 --> 01:55:56,920
- SEUNGHO. - Congratulations.

2768
01:55:56,920 --> 01:55:58,060
Nice.

2769
01:55:59,119 --> 01:56:01,760
(Trainee SONG SEUNGHO is ranked 6th.)

2770
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:03,329
Where are you going? Give me a hug before you go.

2771
01:56:07,930 --> 01:56:09,630
SUNGMIN, you really...

2772
01:56:10,970 --> 01:56:12,069
Gosh.

2773
01:56:14,840 --> 01:56:17,380
Trainee SONG SEUNGHO...

2774
01:56:17,380 --> 01:56:19,279
has shown off his eye-catching looks...

2775
01:56:19,640 --> 01:56:22,409
as well as his improving skills each round,

2776
01:56:22,409 --> 01:56:25,279
receiving huge support and love from World Assemblers.

2777
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:26,649
He's handsome.

2778
01:56:26,649 --> 01:56:28,149
- SEUNGHO is handsome. - Right.

2779
01:56:28,390 --> 01:56:30,050
He's got such affectionate looks.

2780
01:56:30,819 --> 01:56:32,489
As the benefit for the first-place team,

2781
01:56:32,720 --> 01:56:35,960
he's received ten percent more of his global voting score.

2782
01:56:36,130 --> 01:56:39,260
And for placing first within the team,

2783
01:56:39,260 --> 01:56:41,970
he's also received 50,000 benefit points.

2784
01:56:42,130 --> 01:56:44,439
SEUNGHO placed first of all individuals and teams.

2785
01:56:44,439 --> 01:56:47,909
First off, I'm really grateful to World Assemblers...

2786
01:56:48,069 --> 01:56:50,779
for letting me place high.

2787
01:56:50,939 --> 01:56:53,680
And I'm so grateful to Team "Merry-Go-Round..."

2788
01:56:53,880 --> 01:56:57,880
for helping me receive this many benefit points.

2789
01:56:58,149 --> 01:56:59,920
I think this is...

2790
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:02,750
such a high rank for me.

2791
01:57:02,949 --> 01:57:04,819
I'll give my best efforts...

2792
01:57:05,060 --> 01:57:06,659
to live up to this rank...

2793
01:57:06,659 --> 01:57:08,789
and show a wonderful performance...

2794
01:57:08,930 --> 01:57:10,829
since it's going to be the final match.

2795
01:57:10,899 --> 01:57:13,130
I love you. Thank you.

2796
01:57:16,100 --> 01:57:19,500
Please sit on the sixth-place seat.

2797
01:57:20,510 --> 01:57:21,609
It's hard.

2798
01:57:22,939 --> 01:57:26,510
Let me move on to the fifth-place trainee.

2799
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:27,909
Fifth place.

2800
01:57:27,909 --> 01:57:31,380
This trainee's charm is an innocent smile.

2801
01:57:33,279 --> 01:57:34,390
It's SUNGMIN.

2802
01:57:34,390 --> 01:57:36,090
(9th, KIM SUNGMIN, during the 8th week)

2803
01:57:36,289 --> 01:57:37,590
I think he saw me.

2804
01:57:39,159 --> 01:57:40,390
Does MAJINGXIANG smile often?

2805
01:57:41,289 --> 01:57:45,229
(7th place, MAJINGXIANG, Week 6 ranking)

2806
01:57:45,229 --> 01:57:46,300
SUNGMIN?

2807
01:57:47,829 --> 01:57:48,970
KYOUNGBAE.

2808
01:57:48,970 --> 01:57:51,100
(3rd place, SEO KYOUNGBAE, Week 6 ranking)

2809
01:57:52,739 --> 01:57:53,770
Could it be KENSHIN?

2810
01:57:53,770 --> 01:57:55,670
(2nd place, SAKURADA KENSHIN, Week 6 ranking)

2811
01:57:56,140 --> 01:57:57,180
Me?

2812
01:57:58,680 --> 01:57:59,880
I'm scared.

2813
01:58:00,850 --> 01:58:03,680
All the remaining trainees have a pretty smile.

2814
01:58:04,350 --> 01:58:06,550
And during this Original Matching,

2815
01:58:06,550 --> 01:58:08,250
he showed off his sexy charm,

2816
01:58:08,550 --> 01:58:11,319
which he hadn't shown until then.

2817
01:58:11,420 --> 01:58:13,390
- Sexy? - That's Team "Trigger."

2818
01:58:14,029 --> 01:58:15,130
It's MAJINGXIANG.

2819
01:58:15,630 --> 01:58:17,399
SUNGMIN is sexy.

2820
01:58:18,529 --> 01:58:19,600
You get us.

2821
01:58:20,729 --> 01:58:21,930
This trainee received...

2822
01:58:21,930 --> 01:58:26,569
a global voting score of 2,135,578.

2823
01:58:26,869 --> 01:58:29,239
Would it be SUNGMIN or MAJINGXIANG?

2824
01:58:35,579 --> 01:58:37,079
It's Trainee MAJINGXIANG.

2825
01:58:37,079 --> 01:58:38,420
(The 5th-place trainee is MAJINGXIANG.)

2826
01:58:39,079 --> 01:58:40,520
It's Trainee MAJINGXIANG.

2827
01:58:41,090 --> 01:58:43,090
- It's MAJINGXIANG. - Congratulations.

2828
01:58:46,319 --> 01:58:48,029
Wasn't he placed seventh last time?

2829
01:58:48,029 --> 01:58:49,090
- He was? - Gosh.

2830
01:58:49,529 --> 01:58:52,100
It's not easy to go up within the Top Seven ranks.

2831
01:58:52,600 --> 01:58:54,329
During the self-evaluation,

2832
01:58:54,329 --> 01:58:57,369
he was commented that he was barely visible...

2833
01:58:57,369 --> 01:59:00,539
and that he had no presence, which made him down for a while.

2834
01:59:00,539 --> 01:59:02,310
But after making endless efforts,

2835
01:59:02,310 --> 01:59:04,140
he managed to get a part of the performance...

2836
01:59:04,140 --> 01:59:07,810
and show such splendid improvements within a short time.

2837
01:59:07,810 --> 01:59:10,649
His desperate determination reached World Assemblers,

2838
01:59:10,649 --> 01:59:12,979
and he placed first in the team,

2839
01:59:12,979 --> 01:59:16,350
receiving 50,000 additional benefit points.

2840
01:59:16,390 --> 01:59:19,720
He's continued to be a debuting candidate so far.

2841
01:59:19,760 --> 01:59:23,359
Will his desperateness lead him to achieve his dream?

2842
01:59:23,529 --> 01:59:25,729
Let's watch until the end.

2843
01:59:25,829 --> 01:59:29,800
I'm so happy that I'm ranked higher.

2844
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:34,239
And I'm grateful to Team "Trigger..."

2845
01:59:34,239 --> 01:59:36,810
because when I was part of this team,

2846
01:59:37,010 --> 01:59:40,880
I wasn't that skilled.

2847
01:59:40,880 --> 01:59:42,949
Because my teammates helped me a lot,

2848
01:59:42,949 --> 01:59:47,250
I go to present such a nice performance with them.

2849
01:59:47,789 --> 01:59:49,619
For having me ranked higher than the last time,

2850
01:59:49,619 --> 01:59:53,289
I'm so grateful to World Assemblers. I love you all.

2851
01:59:53,289 --> 01:59:56,159
And the weather has gotten a lot colder.

2852
01:59:56,159 --> 01:59:57,859
Please be careful not to catch a cold.

2853
01:59:57,859 --> 01:59:59,529
Make sure to feed yourselves properly.

2854
02:00:00,829 --> 02:00:01,930
He's cute.

2855
02:00:02,270 --> 02:00:06,270
I'm grateful to my parents for always supporting me...

2856
02:00:06,270 --> 02:00:09,739
and letting me participate in another auditioning program.

2857
02:00:09,939 --> 02:00:13,609
There have been tough moments throughout the show,

2858
02:00:13,739 --> 02:00:20,149
but I've gotten to have good chances thanks to my parents' support.

2859
02:00:20,350 --> 02:00:24,260
I'll do the best I can to prepare for the finals.

2860
02:00:24,989 --> 02:00:28,789
Please support me with loud voices during the finals.

2861
02:00:28,789 --> 02:00:30,899
Dear World Assemblers,

2862
02:00:31,560 --> 02:00:33,029
I love you so much.

2863
02:00:34,199 --> 02:00:35,630
"I love you so much."

2864
02:00:35,869 --> 02:00:36,970
I'm sorry.

2865
02:00:36,970 --> 02:00:38,369
"I love you so much."

2866
02:00:38,840 --> 02:00:39,899
Good.

2867
02:00:40,300 --> 02:00:41,510
He's making a word in so many languages.

2868
02:00:41,770 --> 02:00:43,869
I love you. To the top!

2869
02:00:43,869 --> 02:00:45,640
I'll do better. Thank you.

2870
02:00:45,640 --> 02:00:46,979
"I love you."

2871
02:00:49,750 --> 02:00:54,420
It seems like he was born to think like an idol.

2872
02:00:54,850 --> 02:00:57,560
He's got such a nice attitude.

2873
02:00:57,619 --> 02:01:00,729
- He does have a nice attitude. - He has such a nice attitude.

2874
02:01:09,399 --> 02:01:10,869
Four, three, two, one.

2875
02:01:10,869 --> 02:01:12,439
(JANG YEOJUN, SONG SEUNGHO, MAJINGXIANG, 4th, 3rd, 2nd, 1st)

2876
02:01:12,439 --> 02:01:15,609
Moving on to the fourth-place trainee.

2877
02:01:16,170 --> 02:01:18,909
This trainee has constantly been named as a handsome trainee...

2878
02:01:18,909 --> 02:01:21,210
- of PROJECT 7. - It's SUNGMIN.

2879
02:01:22,050 --> 02:01:23,180
KYOUNGBAE, calm down.

2880
02:01:24,380 --> 02:01:25,449
That's me.

2881
02:01:26,750 --> 02:01:28,750
KYOUNGBAE isn't that handsome, is he?

2882
02:01:29,319 --> 02:01:30,720
- He's rather charming. - He's cute.

2883
02:01:30,960 --> 02:01:32,189
He's handsome.

2884
02:01:32,890 --> 02:01:34,060
It's me.

2885
02:01:34,060 --> 02:01:35,060
(3rd place, SEO KYOUNGBAE, Week 6 ranking)

2886
02:01:35,060 --> 02:01:37,460
- It's got to be SUNGMIN. - SUNGMIN, go out in advance.

2887
02:01:38,130 --> 02:01:43,630
This trainee received a global voting score of 2,152,473.

2888
02:01:45,670 --> 02:01:46,770
It's almost impossible to break that score.

2889
02:01:53,579 --> 02:01:56,279
(Trainee KIM SUNGMIN places 4th.)

2890
02:01:56,579 --> 02:01:59,119
It's Trainee KIM SUNGMIN.

2891
02:02:00,720 --> 02:02:02,090
His rank has gone up so much.

2892
02:02:07,590 --> 02:02:10,529
After watching him perform "Merry-Go-Round,"

2893
02:02:10,529 --> 02:02:14,199
people even wondered if his personal color was pink.

2894
02:02:14,329 --> 02:02:16,630
He pulled off the concept perfectly.

2895
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,500
His team placed first in the Original Matching,

2896
02:02:19,739 --> 02:02:22,210
and he got to obtain ten percent...

2897
02:02:22,210 --> 02:02:25,109
of his global voting score additionally.

2898
02:02:25,310 --> 02:02:27,380
Thanks to it, he's seized a chance...

2899
02:02:27,380 --> 02:02:30,779
to show a wonderful performance during the finals.

2900
02:02:31,050 --> 02:02:33,180
He received almost 200,000 benefit points.

2901
02:02:34,720 --> 02:02:36,119
Benefit points mean so much.

2902
02:02:37,189 --> 02:02:38,420
- I know. - Seriously.

2903
02:02:39,119 --> 02:02:42,829
First off, I'd like to give thanks...

2904
02:02:42,829 --> 02:02:45,899
to World Assemblers for giving me a lot of support.

2905
02:02:46,329 --> 02:02:49,600
Each round, I've thought...

2906
02:02:49,600 --> 02:02:52,439
I should do the best I could to practice and perform...

2907
02:02:52,569 --> 02:02:55,210
even if it didn't work out.

2908
02:02:55,340 --> 02:02:58,680
I'd like to keep making an effort...

2909
02:02:59,109 --> 02:03:03,180
to show a better performance...

2910
02:03:03,750 --> 02:03:06,979
to my family and World Assemblers...

2911
02:03:07,020 --> 02:03:09,350
during the finals.

2912
02:03:09,590 --> 02:03:10,649
Thank you.

2913
02:03:13,520 --> 02:03:17,859
Trainee KIM SUNGMIN, please sit on the fourth-place seat.

2914
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:21,000
Good job.

2915
02:03:27,640 --> 02:03:30,670
Moving on to the third-place trainee.

2916
02:03:33,579 --> 02:03:35,449
It will be KENSHIN, KYOUNGBAE, and MINWOOK again.

2917
02:03:35,609 --> 02:03:38,850
This trainee has been the most popular guy...

2918
02:03:38,850 --> 02:03:40,750
to the trainees within PROJECT 7.

2919
02:03:41,420 --> 02:03:42,420
- What? - KENSHIN?

2920
02:03:42,619 --> 02:03:43,619
JEON MINWOOK?

2921
02:03:44,590 --> 02:03:46,760
He isn't our most popular guy.

2922
02:03:47,159 --> 02:03:48,289
MINWOOK is popular.

2923
02:03:49,090 --> 02:03:50,689
KENSHIN is our most popular guy.

2924
02:03:52,130 --> 02:03:53,529
It's KYOUNGBAE.

2925
02:03:54,300 --> 02:03:56,569
This trainee is said to be good...

2926
02:03:56,729 --> 02:04:00,000
at appeasing his fellow trainees...

2927
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:01,970
with sweet and warm words.

2928
02:04:02,039 --> 02:04:03,409
- Is it MINWOOK? - Hold on.

2929
02:04:03,710 --> 02:04:05,739
The ten-percent benefit is huge.

2930
02:04:06,239 --> 02:04:07,979
Figures. It's huge especially within the top ranks.

2931
02:04:09,010 --> 02:04:10,079
It might be KENSHIN.

2932
02:04:10,109 --> 02:04:12,180
He comforted me yesterday.

2933
02:04:12,420 --> 02:04:13,880
"You're so handsome."

2934
02:04:13,880 --> 02:04:14,890
KENSHIN is ranked third?

2935
02:04:18,020 --> 02:04:19,060
I think it's you.

2936
02:04:20,220 --> 02:04:21,590
Me?

2937
02:04:21,590 --> 02:04:22,659
- KYOUNGBAE. - Me?

2938
02:04:23,630 --> 02:04:24,760
Could it be YONGHYUN?

2939
02:04:25,359 --> 02:04:26,930
Right, he's sweet.

2940
02:04:26,930 --> 02:04:27,970
I know.

2941
02:04:28,170 --> 02:04:29,800
Will there be a twist here?

2942
02:04:34,909 --> 02:04:35,970
- Nice... - Who could it be?

2943
02:04:39,109 --> 02:04:40,310
This trainee received...

2944
02:04:40,609 --> 02:04:41,880
It can't be three million.

2945
02:04:41,880 --> 02:04:43,680
a global voting score of 3 million and 70,000...

2946
02:04:44,180 --> 02:04:45,479
This makes no sense.

2947
02:04:46,050 --> 02:04:48,819
Of 3,078,937.

2948
02:04:51,319 --> 02:04:52,520
It's different.

2949
02:04:52,619 --> 02:04:55,130
This means he received 300,000 benefit points.

2950
02:04:55,390 --> 02:04:57,289
If it's MINWOOK,

2951
02:04:57,430 --> 02:04:58,560
this is without any benefit points.

2952
02:04:59,199 --> 02:05:01,199
- That's right. - It makes no sense.

2953
02:05:02,430 --> 02:05:04,600
- I think it's MINWOOK. - Me too.

2954
02:05:04,939 --> 02:05:07,270
KYOUNGBAE and KENSHIN received benefit points.

2955
02:05:08,010 --> 02:05:09,039
Third place.

2956
02:05:09,210 --> 02:05:10,340
It can't be MINWOOK.

2957
02:05:11,539 --> 02:05:13,210
It can't be KEN... I think it's KYOUNGBAE.

2958
02:05:13,979 --> 02:05:15,149
The third-place trainee is...

2959
02:05:17,720 --> 02:05:18,920
The unchanging first place...

2960
02:05:19,180 --> 02:05:21,619
- Trainee... Congratulations. - Goodness.

2961
02:05:21,649 --> 02:05:22,689
For real?

2962
02:05:23,920 --> 02:05:25,020
Trainee...

2963
02:05:25,319 --> 02:05:26,420
Congratulations.

2964
02:05:29,329 --> 02:05:30,590
The third-place trainee is...

2965
02:05:32,960 --> 02:05:34,529
Trainee JEON MINWOOK.

2966
02:05:35,300 --> 02:05:36,369
Congratulations.

2967
02:05:37,329 --> 02:05:38,869
Trainee JEON MINWOOK.

2968
02:05:39,670 --> 02:05:40,770
Congratulations.

2969
02:05:42,039 --> 02:05:43,069
Top one.

2970
02:05:43,869 --> 02:05:45,409
- Top one. - What...

2971
02:05:49,449 --> 02:05:50,479
(3rd place, JEON MINWOOK)

2972
02:05:50,479 --> 02:05:52,420
It feels strange that he's not ranked first.

2973
02:05:53,619 --> 02:05:55,819
- It's the first time. - I'm getting goosebumps.

2974
02:05:56,750 --> 02:05:59,359
- When there's a new shiny chair... - I know.

2975
02:05:59,689 --> 02:06:00,689
Why this time...

2976
02:06:00,789 --> 02:06:02,159
KYOUNGBAE is flustered.

2977
02:06:02,560 --> 02:06:04,189
KYOUNGBAE is taken aback.

2978
02:06:05,359 --> 02:06:06,630
You might place first.

2979
02:06:06,630 --> 02:06:07,630
You might be 21st.

2980
02:06:07,630 --> 02:06:09,270
What is going on? Will you place first?

2981
02:06:10,470 --> 02:06:13,199
Unlike his cold appearance, Trainee JEON MINWOOK...

2982
02:06:13,199 --> 02:06:15,170
helped his teammates stay calm and focused...

2983
02:06:15,170 --> 02:06:17,470
with sweet and comforting words.

2984
02:06:17,640 --> 02:06:20,239
He placed first in a row...

2985
02:06:20,239 --> 02:06:22,079
during the 1st and 2nd Passing Ceremonies,

2986
02:06:22,079 --> 02:06:25,819
which got him the title of the unchanging first ranker.

2987
02:06:26,149 --> 02:06:29,890
But for the 3rd Passing Ceremony, he's moved 2 ranks lower...

2988
02:06:30,149 --> 02:06:33,420
and placed 3rd for the 1st time.

2989
02:06:33,689 --> 02:06:34,760
So this can be broken.

2990
02:06:35,430 --> 02:06:37,159
Benefit points are that huge.

2991
02:06:37,489 --> 02:06:39,300
- It's changed so much. - This is totally unexpected.

2992
02:06:39,899 --> 02:06:42,970
Unlike the previous rule of voting seven trainees,

2993
02:06:42,970 --> 02:06:46,199
World Assemblers could vote for only three trainees.

2994
02:06:46,199 --> 02:06:49,140
And this has caused an unexpected result.

2995
02:06:49,170 --> 02:06:52,810
Trainee JEON MINWOOK is ranked third. Congratulations again.

2996
02:06:52,810 --> 02:06:56,449
I'll look forward to seeing more of your amazing sides in the finals.

2997
02:06:57,779 --> 02:06:59,649
A score of 3,070,000 without any benefit points?

2998
02:06:59,649 --> 02:07:00,649
Without any benefit points.

2999
02:07:00,819 --> 02:07:05,189
I must say the third place is still very high.

3000
02:07:05,590 --> 02:07:09,390
I'm truly grateful to the World Assemblers...

3001
02:07:09,390 --> 02:07:11,600
who voted for me.

3002
02:07:11,699 --> 02:07:14,829
I wonder how it feels to place 3rd after placing 1st all the time.

3003
02:07:15,630 --> 02:07:19,569
I'm happy to be ranked third.

3004
02:07:20,270 --> 02:07:24,109
Now, I have somewhere to go higher.

3005
02:07:24,539 --> 02:07:27,279
I'll try harder to move up.

3006
02:07:28,149 --> 02:07:31,420
You see, the three Passing Ceremonies...

3007
02:07:31,449 --> 02:07:34,319
made and will make us part ways with a lot of trainees.

3008
02:07:34,390 --> 02:07:38,189
Some of us will have to leave today.

3009
02:07:38,289 --> 02:07:42,390
I know a lot of them are truly desperate.

3010
02:07:42,390 --> 02:07:43,390
So...

3011
02:07:46,760 --> 02:07:48,899
During the finals...

3012
02:07:50,430 --> 02:07:51,670
Once I advance to the finals,

3013
02:07:53,569 --> 02:07:57,470
I'll do much better...

3014
02:07:57,470 --> 02:07:59,909
for the eliminated trainees...

3015
02:07:59,939 --> 02:08:01,350
so that their desperateness...

3016
02:08:01,380 --> 02:08:03,750
won't go in vain.

3017
02:08:03,810 --> 02:08:04,880
Thank you.

3018
02:08:08,520 --> 02:08:09,520
Thanks.

3019
02:08:12,920 --> 02:08:14,090
You're doing well.

3020
02:08:14,859 --> 02:08:16,560
You received three million without any benefit points.

3021
02:08:17,460 --> 02:08:19,659
- I know. - You're unbreakable.

3022
02:08:20,199 --> 02:08:21,199
It makes no sense.

3023
02:08:23,369 --> 02:08:26,300
The first-place seat suddenly got much better.

3024
02:08:26,439 --> 02:08:30,510
I wished they made it that cool last time too.

3025
02:08:30,510 --> 02:08:32,680
I'd really like to take that seat. I'll try harder for it.

3026
02:08:34,109 --> 02:08:37,510
Of the 21 passing seats,

3027
02:08:37,750 --> 02:08:41,890
only the 21st, 2nd,

3028
02:08:42,590 --> 02:08:45,020
and 1st seats are left.

3029
02:08:45,319 --> 02:08:47,020
There are the 21st, 2nd, and 1st seats left.

3030
02:08:47,789 --> 02:08:49,760
KYOUNGBAE, KENSHIN, and the 21st.

3031
02:08:50,359 --> 02:08:52,800
Let me announce...

3032
02:08:53,029 --> 02:08:56,199
the 1st-place trainee of the 3rd Passing Ceremony.

3033
02:08:56,199 --> 02:08:58,600
- We start with the first place? - Goodness.

3034
02:08:58,939 --> 02:09:00,000
The first place?

3035
02:09:01,869 --> 02:09:05,380
To announce the first-place trainee,

3036
02:09:05,380 --> 02:09:06,640
let me reveal the two candidates.

3037
02:09:07,310 --> 02:09:10,279
The 1st-place candidates of the 3rd Passing Ceremony.

3038
02:09:10,609 --> 02:09:11,720
The two of them are...

3039
02:09:11,979 --> 02:09:13,779
HYUNWOO, let's go.

3040
02:09:14,279 --> 02:09:16,090
- Me? - Let's go.

3041
02:09:18,489 --> 02:09:20,220
If my name is mentioned at this timing,

3042
02:09:21,289 --> 02:09:23,260
that will really turn the tables.

3043
02:09:23,960 --> 02:09:25,159
KYOUNGBAE and KENSHIN?

3044
02:09:26,430 --> 02:09:28,199
Trainee SEO KYOUNGBAE...

3045
02:09:28,670 --> 02:09:30,670
and Trainee SAKURADA KENSHIN.

3046
02:09:30,670 --> 02:09:31,670
(The 1st-place candidates are KYOUNGBAE and KENSHIN.)

3047
02:09:31,670 --> 02:09:32,869
As expected.

3048
02:09:33,739 --> 02:09:36,170
Please come forward.

3049
02:09:38,180 --> 02:09:40,239
I can't believe MINWOOK isn't a candidate.

3050
02:09:43,750 --> 02:09:45,779
- KYOUNGBAE is going so much higher. - Really.

3051
02:09:45,779 --> 02:09:46,880
- I know. - This is crazy.

3052
02:09:49,720 --> 02:09:51,119
KENSHIN's hands are sweaty.

3053
02:09:51,619 --> 02:09:53,659
KYOUNGBAE is going up so much.

3054
02:09:54,260 --> 02:09:55,289
KYOUNGBAE.

3055
02:09:57,899 --> 02:09:59,000
Who will place first?

3056
02:09:59,729 --> 02:10:01,029
KYOUNGBAE looks so relaxed.

3057
02:10:01,199 --> 02:10:03,300
He's young. How envious.

3058
02:10:03,300 --> 02:10:04,600
You might place first.

3059
02:10:05,399 --> 02:10:06,600
You.

3060
02:10:12,510 --> 02:10:16,180
Following the 1st 2 Passing Ceremonies,

3061
02:10:16,609 --> 02:10:20,079
Trainee SAKURADA KENSHIN is standing here again...

3062
02:10:20,079 --> 02:10:22,350
for the third Passing Ceremony.

3063
02:10:22,489 --> 02:10:25,720
And Trainee SEO KYOUNGBAE...

3064
02:10:25,720 --> 02:10:28,260
has become a 1st-place candidate for the 1st time.

3065
02:10:29,789 --> 02:10:31,399
KYOUNGBAE is constantly going up.

3066
02:10:31,829 --> 02:10:36,430
KENSHIN is the cute mascot of PROJECT 7.

3067
02:10:36,500 --> 02:10:39,640
He perfectly pulled off performing for the Original Matching...

3068
02:10:39,640 --> 02:10:41,409
and contributed to his team's placing first,

3069
02:10:41,409 --> 02:10:44,270
seizing this huge benefit...

3070
02:10:44,270 --> 02:10:46,710
of getting ten percent of his global voting score.

3071
02:10:46,979 --> 02:10:51,010
Trainee SEO KYOUNGBAE also obtained the benefit points...

3072
02:10:51,010 --> 02:10:53,949
as part of KENSHIN's team.

3073
02:10:54,050 --> 02:10:56,289
Especially through the "Merry-Go-Round" performance,

3074
02:10:56,289 --> 02:10:58,960
he showed off his refreshing and cute charms.

3075
02:10:58,960 --> 02:11:02,060
It got him the nickname, Genius Idol.

3076
02:11:02,560 --> 02:11:04,130
Trainee SAKURADA KENSHIN,

3077
02:11:04,289 --> 02:11:06,000
your first-place rival has changed.

3078
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:09,500
Do you think you can place first this time?

3079
02:11:13,069 --> 02:11:14,300
I...

3080
02:11:14,869 --> 02:11:17,869
For the past two times,

3081
02:11:17,869 --> 02:11:20,810
MINWOOK was ranked first while I was...

3082
02:11:21,350 --> 02:11:22,979
in second place.

3083
02:11:23,310 --> 02:11:25,880
So I can't predict the result.

3084
02:11:26,350 --> 02:11:28,689
But I want to take first place today.

3085
02:11:28,989 --> 02:11:31,289
But I want to take first place today.

3086
02:11:33,560 --> 02:11:35,659
"I can beat KYOUNGBAE today."

3087
02:11:36,989 --> 02:11:40,359
KYOUNGBAE, it's your 1st time becoming the 1st place candidate.

3088
02:11:40,359 --> 02:11:41,729
How are you feeling right now?

3089
02:11:41,729 --> 02:11:42,800
Well...

3090
02:11:45,239 --> 02:11:48,340
I thought it was a wall I couldn't jump over.

3091
02:11:48,739 --> 02:11:52,140
My hands and feet are shaking.

3092
02:11:54,710 --> 02:11:55,779
He's cute.

3093
02:11:55,850 --> 02:11:58,350
Do you think you'll be able to take first place?

3094
02:12:00,020 --> 02:12:01,220
My goodness.

3095
02:12:03,220 --> 02:12:04,319
You can do it.

3096
02:12:04,819 --> 02:12:05,989
Be confident.

3097
02:12:07,119 --> 02:12:09,229
I think I can do it.

3098
02:12:10,130 --> 02:12:12,159
I think I can do it.

3099
02:12:14,869 --> 02:12:15,970
Let's do it.

3100
02:12:17,970 --> 02:12:19,170
You can take first place.

3101
02:12:24,710 --> 02:12:26,539
He's the man.

3102
02:12:28,149 --> 02:12:29,350
They must be nervous.

3103
02:12:30,350 --> 02:12:32,479
The first place's spot shines especially bright today.

3104
02:12:33,520 --> 02:12:35,350
It's especially bling-bling.

3105
02:12:36,619 --> 02:12:40,359
World Assemblers' global voting score determined...

3106
02:12:40,359 --> 02:12:42,560
the results of PROJECT 7's 3rd Passing Ceremony.

3107
02:12:42,560 --> 02:12:44,659
I'll announce the first place.

3108
02:12:45,029 --> 02:12:46,899
Who will it be? I'm curious.

3109
02:12:48,430 --> 02:12:49,600
Who do you think it'll be?

3110
02:12:50,100 --> 02:12:51,899
- KENSHIN. - It must be KENSHIN.

3111
02:12:53,039 --> 02:12:55,140
Will KYOUNGBAE take first place?

3112
02:12:55,140 --> 02:12:56,640
I think it'll be KYOUNGBAE.

3113
02:12:56,640 --> 02:13:00,180
He has so many Chinese fans. Seriously.

3114
02:13:01,010 --> 02:13:02,180
He's popular.

3115
02:13:03,550 --> 02:13:06,220
The trainee who took 1st place in the 3rd Passing Ceremony...

3116
02:13:06,220 --> 02:13:07,680
received...

3117
02:13:07,680 --> 02:13:12,119
the global voting score of 3,531,691 points.

3118
02:13:12,590 --> 02:13:14,020
Gosh, 3.5 million.

3119
02:13:14,020 --> 02:13:15,729
That's 0.5 million more than MINWOOK's.

3120
02:13:15,859 --> 02:13:17,630
I can't believe it's 3.5 million.

3121
02:13:17,829 --> 02:13:21,000
It's a daunting spot, but I have the desire to take it.

3122
02:13:21,199 --> 02:13:23,430
I received the benefit points, even though KENSHIN did too.

3123
02:13:23,500 --> 02:13:26,140
I might be able to beat KENSHIN.

3124
02:13:26,340 --> 02:13:28,210
I might be able to take first place.

3125
02:13:29,840 --> 02:13:33,310
MINWOOK and I took 1st and 2nd places respectively...

3126
02:13:33,310 --> 02:13:35,380
in the two previous ceremonies.

3127
02:13:35,649 --> 02:13:37,880
But today, MINWOOK took third place.

3128
02:13:37,949 --> 02:13:40,680
I'm confident that I'll take first place today.

3129
02:13:41,789 --> 02:13:44,350
KENSHIN should take first place this time.

3130
02:13:46,319 --> 02:13:48,229
If KYOUNGBAE wins, it'll be legendary.

3131
02:13:48,960 --> 02:13:50,489
Will he change the game?

3132
02:13:50,489 --> 02:13:52,659
SEO or SAKURADA?

3133
02:13:53,229 --> 02:13:55,170
If KYOUNGBAE wins, it'll be legendary.

3134
02:13:55,800 --> 02:13:57,369
Will he change the game?

3135
02:13:57,369 --> 02:13:59,640
SEO or SAKURADA?

3136
02:13:59,640 --> 02:14:01,340
SAKURADA KENSHIN.

3137
02:14:01,340 --> 02:14:03,140
(1st, Trainee SAKURADA KENSHIN)

3138
02:14:04,039 --> 02:14:05,609
SAKURADA KENSHIN.

3139
02:14:06,779 --> 02:14:07,979
Oh, my goodness.

3140
02:14:09,050 --> 02:14:10,109
Congratulations.

3141
02:14:12,479 --> 02:14:13,579
He did very well.

3142
02:14:14,720 --> 02:14:15,750
He finally took first place.

3143
02:14:15,750 --> 02:14:17,819
Still, KYOUNGBAE took second place.

3144
02:14:17,890 --> 02:14:19,119
KYOUNGBAE is impressive.

3145
02:14:20,720 --> 02:14:23,989
SAKURADA KENSHIN took first place...

3146
02:14:23,989 --> 02:14:25,600
for the very first time.

3147
02:14:25,600 --> 02:14:26,760
Congratulations.

3148
02:14:27,859 --> 02:14:29,000
It...

3149
02:14:30,100 --> 02:14:32,899
still doesn't feel real.

3150
02:14:33,439 --> 02:14:35,010
But I'm so happy.

3151
02:14:35,210 --> 02:14:39,439
Firstly, World Assemblers, thank you for voting for me.

3152
02:14:39,479 --> 02:14:43,750
I still lack skills,

3153
02:14:44,279 --> 02:14:47,180
so I'll practice harder.

3154
02:14:47,649 --> 02:14:50,689
It's my desire to show my various seeds...

3155
02:14:50,750 --> 02:14:51,989
- "Sides." - "Sides."

3156
02:14:51,989 --> 02:14:53,289
- "Sides?" - "Sides?"

3157
02:14:53,789 --> 02:14:56,529
My various sides in the future.

3158
02:14:56,960 --> 02:14:59,359
- He can speak Korean well. - He improved a lot.

3159
02:14:59,500 --> 02:15:05,199
I really wanted to place first place,

3160
02:15:05,470 --> 02:15:07,170
but only took second place in the past.

3161
02:15:07,399 --> 02:15:12,079
I'm very happy that I took first place thanks to you guys.

3162
02:15:12,079 --> 02:15:16,180
I'll continue to do my absolute best.

3163
02:15:16,180 --> 02:15:19,220
And I could take first place...

3164
02:15:19,319 --> 02:15:25,020
because the trainees in the back helped me.

3165
02:15:26,020 --> 02:15:30,029
So I'll work hard for them.

3166
02:15:35,670 --> 02:15:38,970
The trainee who took 2nd place in the 3rd Passing Ceremony is...

3167
02:15:39,500 --> 02:15:40,970
SEO KYOUNGBAE.

3168
02:15:41,100 --> 02:15:43,310
SEO KYOUNGBAE received...

3169
02:15:43,640 --> 02:15:48,140
the global voting score of 3,182,992 points...

3170
02:15:48,380 --> 02:15:50,310
and placed second.

3171
02:15:50,479 --> 02:15:52,449
KENSHIN took first place by a landslide.

3172
02:15:53,479 --> 02:15:55,020
There's a difference of 400,000 points.

3173
02:15:55,189 --> 02:15:57,590
Without the benefit points, KYOUNGBAE is in third place.

3174
02:15:57,949 --> 02:16:00,789
KYOUNGBAE took second place thanks to the benefit points.

3175
02:16:00,859 --> 02:16:03,529
World Assemblers who gave me...

3176
02:16:03,890 --> 02:16:05,930
a lot of attention, support,

3177
02:16:06,399 --> 02:16:10,270
and love, thank you so much.

3178
02:16:10,270 --> 02:16:13,470
And Team "Merry-Go-Round,"

3179
02:16:13,470 --> 02:16:14,970
we practiced hard...

3180
02:16:15,439 --> 02:16:18,939
and took good rankings.

3181
02:16:19,180 --> 02:16:20,909
Now,

3182
02:16:21,010 --> 02:16:24,649
I'm becoming more ambitious.

3183
02:16:25,380 --> 02:16:29,050
Next time, I think it'll be nice...

3184
02:16:29,119 --> 02:16:31,149
to aim for the seat...

3185
02:16:31,149 --> 02:16:33,590
at the top with the blue frame.

3186
02:16:34,819 --> 02:16:35,959
He's cool.

3187
02:16:36,329 --> 02:16:37,530
He's the man.

3188
02:16:38,159 --> 02:16:39,829
It's good to have such ambitions.

3189
02:16:39,899 --> 02:16:43,200
World Assemblers' voting determined the results...

3190
02:16:43,200 --> 02:16:44,700
of the Third Passing Ceremony.

3191
02:16:44,829 --> 02:16:47,540
First place is SAKURADA KENSHIN.

3192
02:16:48,069 --> 02:16:50,110
Second place is SEO KYOUNGBAE.

3193
02:16:50,540 --> 02:16:52,409
Both trainees, congratulations.

3194
02:16:57,110 --> 02:16:59,780
SEO KYOUNGBAE, please take the second place's seat.

3195
02:16:59,780 --> 02:17:02,120
SAKURADA KENSHIN,

3196
02:17:02,219 --> 02:17:05,319
please take the first place's seat at the very top.

3197
02:17:05,889 --> 02:17:07,059
Gosh, he shines.

3198
02:17:07,059 --> 02:17:09,260
- My goodness. - Gosh.

3199
02:17:09,260 --> 02:17:10,860
- Oh, my goodness. - All right.

3200
02:17:11,360 --> 02:17:12,600
Gosh.

3201
02:17:13,600 --> 02:17:15,069
It's a photo spot.

3202
02:17:16,899 --> 02:17:18,370
- I'm so jealous. - It's a photo spot.

3203
02:17:19,239 --> 02:17:20,399
I'm scared.

3204
02:17:21,540 --> 02:17:23,440
Does it feel different up there,

3205
02:17:23,569 --> 02:17:25,010
KENSHIN?

3206
02:17:25,610 --> 02:17:26,979
KENSHIN, how does it feel?

3207
02:17:27,940 --> 02:17:30,379
It feels really nice.

3208
02:17:31,079 --> 02:17:32,379
But it's scary.

3209
02:17:35,149 --> 02:17:38,690
(20 trainees passed including the top 7.)

3210
02:17:39,389 --> 02:17:40,620
I'm jealous.

3211
02:17:41,559 --> 02:17:43,629
Now, only one seat remains.

3212
02:17:44,790 --> 02:17:46,530
It's the 21st-place's seat.

3213
02:17:46,530 --> 02:17:48,129
(Only the 21st-place's seat remains.)

3214
02:17:48,129 --> 02:17:49,229
It's the last one.

3215
02:17:49,299 --> 02:17:50,870
I'm the most curious about this one.

3216
02:17:51,200 --> 02:17:52,469
Seriously. Who will it be?

3217
02:17:52,940 --> 02:17:56,870
Among 15 trainees who haven't been called,

3218
02:17:57,040 --> 02:17:59,510
who will get chosen by the World Assemblers...

3219
02:17:59,680 --> 02:18:01,780
and receive a chance to participate in the Final Project?

3220
02:18:01,780 --> 02:18:04,680
Who will be the last trainee?

3221
02:18:04,850 --> 02:18:08,120
I'll reveal the trainee who took 21st place.

3222
02:18:08,750 --> 02:18:10,750
Who will it be? I can't even make a guess.

3223
02:18:11,389 --> 02:18:12,860
Gosh, it's hard.

3224
02:18:12,860 --> 02:18:14,059
(3rd Passing Ceremony, 21st place)

3225
02:18:14,489 --> 02:18:17,159
Wasn't HANBIN 21st place?

3226
02:18:18,059 --> 02:18:21,000
Previously,

3227
02:18:21,200 --> 02:18:23,200
I took 21st place.

3228
02:18:23,200 --> 02:18:24,700
So I continued to be worried.

3229
02:18:24,829 --> 02:18:26,799
There are trainees who received benefit points,

3230
02:18:26,799 --> 02:18:28,670
but I didn't receive them this time.

3231
02:18:29,309 --> 02:18:31,709
So I thought, "Will I be able to take 21st place?"

3232
02:18:31,979 --> 02:18:33,680
I haven't gotten eliminated,

3233
02:18:33,680 --> 02:18:35,579
but I also haven't passed by 100 percent.

3234
02:18:35,579 --> 02:18:38,049
So I'm really nervous.

3235
02:18:38,520 --> 02:18:39,920
- My goodness. - It's nerve-racking.

3236
02:18:40,350 --> 02:18:42,450
My ranking was dropping.

3237
02:18:42,620 --> 02:18:45,420
I thought, "I might be in danger."

3238
02:18:46,389 --> 02:18:47,719
HYUNWOO should move up.

3239
02:18:48,590 --> 02:18:52,799
I thought I'd place between 11th and 15th places.

3240
02:18:53,129 --> 02:18:54,729
I felt a sense of emergency.

3241
02:18:54,729 --> 02:18:56,430
I realized that I might go home.

3242
02:18:57,069 --> 02:19:00,600
Now, the 4 candidates for 21st place...

3243
02:19:00,600 --> 02:19:02,510
will be revealed on the screen.

3244
02:19:03,840 --> 02:19:05,010
It's so nerve-racking.

3245
02:19:06,209 --> 02:19:07,340
This is driving me crazy.

3246
02:19:07,840 --> 02:19:09,979
Please let one more trainee from my team pass.

3247
02:19:12,049 --> 02:19:13,520
I can't watch this.

3248
02:19:13,879 --> 02:19:15,090
Please reveal them now.

3249
02:19:18,819 --> 02:19:20,090
- What? - My goodness.

3250
02:19:21,559 --> 02:19:22,590
(3rd Passing Ceremony, 21st place)

3251
02:19:23,889 --> 02:19:27,159
(4 candidates for 21st place)

3252
02:19:27,799 --> 02:19:29,500
(15th place, Trainee KANG MINSEO)

3253
02:19:29,500 --> 02:19:31,200
This is driving me crazy.

3254
02:19:31,670 --> 02:19:33,239
(22nd place, Trainee FONG ATILLA)

3255
02:19:33,239 --> 02:19:34,440
ATILLA is a candidate.

3256
02:19:35,739 --> 02:19:37,110
(13th place, Trainee KIM HYUNWOO)

3257
02:19:37,110 --> 02:19:38,440
HYUNWOO.

3258
02:19:39,209 --> 02:19:41,510
What kind of a picture is this?

3259
02:19:41,510 --> 02:19:42,879
(22nd place, Trainee LEE HANBIN)

3260
02:19:43,250 --> 02:19:45,450
KANG MINSEO,

3261
02:19:45,450 --> 02:19:47,920
KIM HYUNWOO, LEE HANBIN,

3262
02:19:48,049 --> 02:19:49,819
and FONG ATILLA.

3263
02:19:49,950 --> 02:19:51,520
Among these four trainees...

3264
02:19:51,520 --> 02:19:55,129
is the one who will survive last and take 21st place.

3265
02:19:55,260 --> 02:19:56,659
No way.

3266
02:19:56,930 --> 02:19:58,030
I really have no idea.

3267
02:19:58,959 --> 02:20:00,399
KANG MINSEO,

3268
02:20:00,659 --> 02:20:04,270
you and your best friend, LEE HANBIN became candidates.

3269
02:20:04,629 --> 02:20:07,100
- This is driving me crazy. - How does it feel?

3270
02:20:07,100 --> 02:20:08,399
Please say a few words.

3271
02:20:08,610 --> 02:20:11,979
HANBIN and I have been friends for seven years.

3272
02:20:12,139 --> 02:20:14,540
- Seven years? - Yes. The two of them go way back.

3273
02:20:14,840 --> 02:20:16,780
It makes my heart ache...

3274
02:20:16,780 --> 02:20:18,979
that both of us are in this position.

3275
02:20:19,750 --> 02:20:22,549
Still, I want one of us to go up...

3276
02:20:23,190 --> 02:20:25,360
and give the final performance.

3277
02:20:25,959 --> 02:20:27,920
This is a cruel fate.

3278
02:20:29,260 --> 02:20:32,760
I don't know why you and I are on that screen.

3279
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:35,370
No matter the result,

3280
02:20:36,629 --> 02:20:39,000
let's work hard. Yes.

3281
02:20:39,639 --> 02:20:41,770
Through PROJECT 7,

3282
02:20:41,770 --> 02:20:44,709
I met a lot of good people.

3283
02:20:44,739 --> 02:20:47,809
I gave a performance that left no regrets,

3284
02:20:47,979 --> 02:20:50,250
so I won't regret it even if I get eliminated now.

3285
02:20:50,250 --> 02:20:52,719
But still, it'll be very nice to pass.

3286
02:20:54,219 --> 02:20:56,590
The guys who were born in 2001 and ATILLA,

3287
02:20:57,020 --> 02:20:58,489
let's compete against each other in good faith.

3288
02:20:59,959 --> 02:21:01,120
HYUNWOO is cool.

3289
02:21:02,290 --> 02:21:06,600
I was so surprised because I thought that I had no chance.

3290
02:21:06,899 --> 02:21:10,500
So I'm very thankful...

3291
02:21:10,700 --> 02:21:12,270
for the second chance.

3292
02:21:13,770 --> 02:21:15,069
FONG is very nervous too.

3293
02:21:16,809 --> 02:21:19,180
At PROJECT 7's 3rd Passing Ceremony,

3294
02:21:19,639 --> 02:21:22,680
which trainee was chosen by the World Assemblers...

3295
02:21:22,780 --> 02:21:26,149
to become the last one to pass...

3296
02:21:26,149 --> 02:21:27,319
as the 21st place?

3297
02:21:27,819 --> 02:21:28,920
Who will it be?

3298
02:21:29,290 --> 02:21:32,590
I'll reveal the trainees from 24th to 21st place...

3299
02:21:32,790 --> 02:21:35,090
one at a time on the screen.

3300
02:21:36,590 --> 02:21:37,659
One at a time?

3301
02:21:38,260 --> 02:21:39,600
It's too cruel.

3302
02:21:40,200 --> 02:21:42,399
Just check it at home.

3303
02:21:43,329 --> 02:21:45,399
Now comes the 24th place.

3304
02:21:45,399 --> 02:21:46,540
Please reveal it now.

3305
02:21:47,069 --> 02:21:49,340
I must debut.

3306
02:21:49,670 --> 02:21:51,709
I really want to join the team.

3307
02:21:52,139 --> 02:21:54,010
- Usually... - ATILLA.

3308
02:21:54,010 --> 02:21:56,510
- Please don't be like that. - ATILLA.

3309
02:21:57,280 --> 02:21:58,350
HANBIN.

3310
02:21:58,510 --> 02:21:59,719
Today's fortune.

3311
02:21:59,719 --> 02:22:01,219
(15th place, Trainee KANG MINSEO 22nd place, Trainee LEE HANBIN)

3312
02:22:01,219 --> 02:22:02,420
Do you remember today's fortune?

3313
02:22:05,559 --> 02:22:09,590
Worrying won't make a difference,

3314
02:22:09,629 --> 02:22:12,659
so I decided to stay positive and enjoy myself.

3315
02:22:13,600 --> 02:22:14,700
Who will it be?

3316
02:22:19,040 --> 02:22:20,370
- Oh, no. - You worked hard.

3317
02:22:20,370 --> 02:22:24,040
(24th place, Trainee FONG ATILLA)

3318
02:22:28,610 --> 02:22:29,809
(I see.)

3319
02:22:30,780 --> 02:22:31,809
Well done.

3320
02:22:33,120 --> 02:22:36,520
The trainee who unfortunately got eliminated as 24th place...

3321
02:22:36,520 --> 02:22:41,260
received the global voting score of 558,055 points.

3322
02:22:41,989 --> 02:22:44,129
It's FONG ATILLA.

3323
02:22:44,729 --> 02:22:47,729
These four months have genuinely been...

3324
02:22:47,729 --> 02:22:50,500
the most amazing time of my life.

3325
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:52,700
I met so many amazing people,

3326
02:22:52,700 --> 02:22:55,540
and I've had so many amazing opportunities...

3327
02:22:55,540 --> 02:23:00,079
that are priceless and can't be bought with money.

3328
02:23:00,239 --> 02:23:04,579
So even though it's really sad that I can't make it to the final,

3329
02:23:05,579 --> 02:23:09,549
these four months that I spend here in Korea will follow me...

3330
02:23:09,889 --> 02:23:12,389
in my life forever.

3331
02:23:12,760 --> 02:23:16,860
My friends, I'll come back for the final.

3332
02:23:16,860 --> 02:23:19,399
So don't worry.

3333
02:23:19,530 --> 02:23:21,629
You can still meet me.

3334
02:23:22,930 --> 02:23:24,030
Bye.

3335
02:23:26,239 --> 02:23:29,340
FONG ATILLA, thank you for your hard work.

3336
02:23:30,569 --> 02:23:33,409
Now comes the 23rd place.

3337
02:23:33,409 --> 02:23:34,510
(The trainee who took 23rd place will be revealed.)

3338
02:23:34,510 --> 02:23:35,510
The 23rd place.

3339
02:23:36,780 --> 02:23:37,979
This is driving me crazy.

3340
02:23:40,180 --> 02:23:41,520
I can't watch this.

3341
02:23:42,290 --> 02:23:45,049
HANBIN was someone I depended on and stayed close to...

3342
02:23:45,049 --> 02:23:46,659
since Team P1.

3343
02:23:46,659 --> 02:23:48,659
But HANBIN hasn't moved up.

3344
02:23:48,760 --> 02:23:51,290
I really hope that he'll be included.

3345
02:23:52,360 --> 02:23:55,370
Which trainee took 23rd place?

3346
02:23:56,100 --> 02:23:57,530
Please reveal the result now.

3347
02:23:57,530 --> 02:24:00,969
(Which trainee took 23rd place?)

3348
02:24:04,040 --> 02:24:05,540
It's so dark.

3349
02:24:08,139 --> 02:24:11,750
(23rd place, Trainee LEE HANBIN)

3350
02:24:11,750 --> 02:24:13,920
- Oh, my goodness. - LEE HANBIN received...

3351
02:24:13,920 --> 02:24:18,120
the global voting score of 696,435 points...

3352
02:24:18,120 --> 02:24:20,989
and will end his journey on PROJECT 7...

3353
02:24:20,989 --> 02:24:23,889
as the 23rd place.

3354
02:24:25,700 --> 02:24:28,059
HAJOON, stop crying.

3355
02:24:28,559 --> 02:24:30,969
I learned a lot on this show.

3356
02:24:31,600 --> 02:24:34,299
There were many people who consoled me...

3357
02:24:34,299 --> 02:24:35,739
when I was struggling.

3358
02:24:36,040 --> 02:24:37,870
Looking at the friends who are sitting before me...

3359
02:24:38,510 --> 02:24:41,909
motivates me to work harder.

3360
02:24:42,180 --> 02:24:44,379
Thank you so much.

3361
02:24:45,549 --> 02:24:46,620
You worked hard.

3362
02:24:46,620 --> 02:24:48,180
- You worked hard, HANBIN. - Well done.

3363
02:24:50,989 --> 02:24:53,690
All right. For the last spot,

3364
02:24:53,690 --> 02:24:56,129
KANG MINSEO and KIM HYUNWOO are desperately waiting...

3365
02:24:56,129 --> 02:24:58,559
to be called.

3366
02:24:58,629 --> 02:25:03,000
I'll announce the trainee who'll end his journey on the show...

3367
02:25:03,399 --> 02:25:06,399
due to a matter of 1 ranking in 22nd place.

3368
02:25:07,170 --> 02:25:09,170
The one whose name gets called will get eliminated.

3369
02:25:11,270 --> 02:25:12,540
I have no idea.

3370
02:25:14,610 --> 02:25:16,250
The 22nd place?

3371
02:25:16,250 --> 02:25:17,950
- The 22nd place. - I see.

3372
02:25:19,079 --> 02:25:20,819
I want HYUNWOO...

3373
02:25:21,319 --> 02:25:22,649
to move up.

3374
02:25:23,489 --> 02:25:26,120
To be honest, I was certain that it'd be MINSEO.

3375
02:25:26,860 --> 02:25:28,319
It could be anyone.

3376
02:25:29,159 --> 02:25:31,530
This is driving me crazy.

3377
02:25:31,989 --> 02:25:35,329
I have the desire to give the final performance.

3378
02:25:35,969 --> 02:25:38,530
"I really want to take 21st place."

3379
02:25:38,530 --> 02:25:40,600
That was the only thought on my mind.

3380
02:25:41,100 --> 02:25:44,969
Please reveal the trainee who took 22nd place.

3381
02:25:46,110 --> 02:25:47,239
Please.

3382
02:25:47,239 --> 02:25:48,639
(Which trainee got eliminated as 22nd place?)

3383
02:25:52,549 --> 02:25:56,319
Please reveal the trainee who took 22nd place.

3384
02:25:57,049 --> 02:25:58,219
Please.

3385
02:25:58,219 --> 02:25:59,920
(Which trainee got eliminated as 22nd place?)

3386
02:26:05,229 --> 02:26:10,370
(22nd place, Trainee KANG MINSEO)

3387
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:14,899
(21st place, Trainee KIM HYUNWOO)

3388
02:26:16,040 --> 02:26:17,110
HYUNWOO made it.

3389
02:26:17,569 --> 02:26:18,670
Thank goodness.

3390
02:26:20,010 --> 02:26:21,709
The trainee who took 22nd place...

3391
02:26:21,709 --> 02:26:26,979
received the global voting score of 706,541 points.

3392
02:26:27,219 --> 02:26:29,290
It's KANG MINSEO.

3393
02:26:35,420 --> 02:26:37,729
Until the semi-final, I've had many performances.

3394
02:26:38,129 --> 02:26:40,760
At first, I just wanted to prove myself...

3395
02:26:40,760 --> 02:26:43,229
in terms of skills and personal matters.

3396
02:26:43,530 --> 02:26:47,069
I ended up going home when I just began to enjoy myself,

3397
02:26:47,469 --> 02:26:49,170
so I'm a bit disappointed.

3398
02:26:49,170 --> 02:26:52,280
Still, the past four months...

3399
02:26:52,280 --> 02:26:54,540
were like a fantasy.

3400
02:26:57,309 --> 02:26:58,379
A fantasy!

3401
02:26:58,409 --> 02:27:01,719
I won't change these memories for anything in the world.

3402
02:27:02,120 --> 02:27:03,450
He's cheerful until the end.

3403
02:27:04,350 --> 02:27:05,389
He used this chance to promote himself.

3404
02:27:07,190 --> 02:27:08,260
You're cool.

3405
02:27:11,659 --> 02:27:14,799
The last trainee to survive for the Final Project...

3406
02:27:14,799 --> 02:27:18,569
as the 21st place is KIM HYUNWOO,

3407
02:27:18,569 --> 02:27:20,440
(21st place, Trainee KIM HYUNWOO)

3408
02:27:20,440 --> 02:27:21,969
- Congratulations. - You worked hard.

3409
02:27:22,540 --> 02:27:25,579
KIM HYUNWOO received...

3410
02:27:25,579 --> 02:27:29,250
the global voting score of 739,314 points.

3411
02:27:29,879 --> 02:27:33,979
He'll continue on his journey toward debut.

3412
02:27:33,979 --> 02:27:35,719
- HYUNWOO, congratulations. - He's cool.

3413
02:27:38,120 --> 02:27:39,120
Congratulations.

3414
02:27:39,920 --> 02:27:43,090
I would've taken 22nd place without the benefit points.

3415
02:27:43,090 --> 02:27:44,159
Really?

3416
02:27:44,829 --> 02:27:46,260
All members of Team "Trigger" and Team "Merry-Go-Round" made it.

3417
02:27:47,329 --> 02:27:48,659
JEONGMIN and SEYUN...

3418
02:27:49,129 --> 02:27:51,329
made it thanks to the benefit points.

3419
02:27:54,500 --> 02:27:57,870
World Assemblers, thank you very much.

3420
02:27:57,940 --> 02:28:02,649
I'll repay you with a good performance.

3421
02:28:02,750 --> 02:28:06,280
I don't know if I'll ever be this nervous again...

3422
02:28:06,280 --> 02:28:07,979
in my life.

3423
02:28:08,379 --> 02:28:10,649
I won't forget it until the day I die.

3424
02:28:10,989 --> 02:28:13,090
Everyone worked very hard.

3425
02:28:13,090 --> 02:28:14,620
I made many good memories.

3426
02:28:14,989 --> 02:28:17,159
I hope we'll meet again.

3427
02:28:17,159 --> 02:28:18,159
I love you.

3428
02:28:22,569 --> 02:28:23,700
Again, congratulations.

3429
02:28:23,700 --> 02:28:26,069
The trainee who took 21st place, KIM HYUNWOO,

3430
02:28:26,069 --> 02:28:28,370
please take the 21st-place's seat.

3431
02:28:28,500 --> 02:28:31,209
- It was nerve-racking. - I knew you could do it.

3432
02:28:36,250 --> 02:28:37,909
Should it be us seven?

3433
02:28:37,909 --> 02:28:39,350
(All places have been announced.)

3434
02:28:39,350 --> 02:28:42,149
Only the last step toward debut,

3435
02:28:42,149 --> 02:28:44,719
Final Project remains.

3436
02:28:45,120 --> 02:28:47,819
Which seven trainees will be reborn...

3437
02:28:47,819 --> 02:28:51,090
as the members of the world's top-class boy group?

3438
02:28:51,989 --> 02:28:55,700
The trainee who took first place, SAKURADA KENSHIN...

3439
02:28:55,700 --> 02:28:59,700
will say hello to the World Assemblers.

3440
02:29:00,139 --> 02:29:03,309
MINWOOK, what should I say?

3441
02:29:03,709 --> 02:29:05,510
"The trainees of PROJECT 7."

3442
02:29:05,510 --> 02:29:06,739
"The trainees of PROJECT 7."

3443
02:29:06,739 --> 02:29:09,180
"To the World Assemblers,"

3444
02:29:09,180 --> 02:29:10,579
- "say hello." - "Say hello."

3445
02:29:11,379 --> 02:29:13,079
The trainees of PROJECT 7.

3446
02:29:13,350 --> 02:29:16,319
To the World Assemblers, say hello.

3447
02:29:16,389 --> 02:29:18,120
- We'll work hard. - We'll work hard.

3448
02:29:23,760 --> 02:29:26,959
I felt like I was getting a step closer to my dream.

3449
02:29:26,959 --> 02:29:28,860
But now, I think I'm right in front of it.

3450
02:29:29,100 --> 02:29:31,500
As the final performance is my last show,

3451
02:29:31,500 --> 02:29:34,270
I want to show a more upgraded version of me.

3452
02:29:34,270 --> 02:29:37,510
I have a feeling this is going to be my last.

3453
02:29:37,739 --> 02:29:39,479
Whatever happens,

3454
02:29:39,479 --> 02:29:42,209
I'm going to risk my all in the final performance.

3455
02:29:42,379 --> 02:29:45,049
You might all think that I won't get...

3456
02:29:45,049 --> 02:29:46,620
into the debut team,

3457
02:29:46,620 --> 02:29:49,049
but I'll show you a plot twist.

3458
02:29:49,149 --> 02:29:52,620
Because I have fans who believe in me and vote for me,

3459
02:29:52,620 --> 02:29:53,889
I'm confident.

3460
02:29:54,719 --> 02:29:57,889
I'll pour out my last ounce of strength in the final stage.

3461
02:29:59,129 --> 02:30:00,530
Because this is the last performance,

3462
02:30:00,530 --> 02:30:03,170
I'll pour out everything I have.

3463
02:30:03,430 --> 02:30:06,170
I want to make my debut in the final stage.

3464
02:30:06,799 --> 02:30:09,739

3488
02:31:17,940 --> 02:31:20,110
- Great job, guys. - You all worked hard.

3489

I'm going now.

I can't believe it.

3499
02:31:43,469 --> 02:31:45,170
I can't believe it either.

3500
02:31:45,170 --> 02:31:46,440
I didn't know.

3501
02:31:47,399 --> 02:31:48,739
You have to make your debut.

3502
02:31:48,739 --> 02:31:51,510
We need to be comforting you.

3503
02:31:51,639 --> 02:31:53,879
Got it? You have to make your debut.

3504
02:31:54,139 --> 02:31:56,709
- I'll do my best. - I'll be rooting for you.

3505
02:31:57,180 --> 02:31:58,250
Thank you.

3506
02:31:59,479 --> 02:32:01,219
What's wrong?

3507
02:32:01,219 --> 02:32:04,389
You promised to make it to the final stage together.

3508
02:32:04,389 --> 02:32:06,889
I'm sorry, KENSHIN.

3509
02:32:07,290 --> 02:32:09,659
I hope to see you in another place.

3510
02:32:09,760 --> 02:32:11,159
I'll do my best too.

3511
02:32:11,790 --> 02:32:13,430
Do your best, KENSHIN.

3512
02:32:14,559 --> 02:32:16,799
- Congratulations on being the top. - Thanks.

3513
02:32:18,399 --> 02:32:20,340
I really cared for him.

3514
02:32:20,340 --> 02:32:24,510
Thinking of saying goodbye to him...

3515
02:32:24,969 --> 02:32:26,739
made me sad, which is why I cried.

3516
02:32:28,180 --> 02:32:32,680
I gained a lot of supporters through this experience.

3517

(TAEHWAN, WOO HAJOON, HAJOON, YOO YOUNGSEO)

3518
02:32:34,479 --> 02:32:35,989
I may have been through some hardships,

3519
02:32:36,819 --> 02:32:39,219
but I don't have any regrets.

3520
02:32:39,420 --> 02:32:42,760
I don't think it's the end but just another beginning.

3521
02:32:43,059 --> 02:32:46,899
I'll come back with good music and a good performance.

3522
02:32:48,329 --> 02:32:52,329
I hope the time comes for me to greet my fans...

3523
02:32:52,569 --> 02:32:55,370
with a good performance.

3524
02:32:56,270 --> 02:32:59,680
Thank you so much for joining me in this long journey.

3525
02:32:59,879 --> 02:33:01,739
Let's wrap it up with a final clap.

3526
02:33:01,739 --> 02:33:03,649
Okay, here's my last slate.

3527
02:33:03,950 --> 02:33:05,610
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

3528
02:33:06,180 --> 02:33:07,520
- Thank you. - Thank you.

(PROJECT 7 supports the dreams of all trainees.)

3530
02:33:16,959 --> 02:33:20,360
To the 21 trainees who will embark...

3531
02:33:20,559 --> 02:33:22,629
on the final journey with PROJECT 7,

3532
02:33:23,030 --> 02:33:26,270
it's almost four months since you set on this journey...

3533
02:33:26,870 --> 02:33:29,469
towards your dream of making your debut.

3534
02:33:30,040 --> 02:33:31,209
You went through Zero Setting,

3540
02:33:43,489 --> 02:33:46,659
Now, you only have one project left.

3541
02:33:47,090 --> 02:33:48,760
The last project is...

3542
02:33:48,760 --> 02:33:50,260
(What is the last project in PROJECT 7?)

3543
02:33:50,629 --> 02:33:52,190

02:33:57,370 --> 02:33:59,370
- The final. - The last one.

3546
02:34:00,100 --> 02:34:01,370
It's finally the last project.

3547
02:34:01,969 --> 02:34:04,809
The final debut members of PROJECT 7...

3548
02:34:05,270 --> 02:34:07,809
will be decided by adding...

3549
02:34:08,180 --> 02:34:10,180
the fourth global voting score...

3550
02:34:10,180 --> 02:34:12,579
and the online score on the day of performance.

3551
02:34:12,950 --> 02:34:15,180
In the fourth global voting,

3552
02:34:15,180 --> 02:34:19,290
they can only vote for one trainee.

3553
02:34:20,020 --> 02:34:24,190
The final number of trainees to make their debut is seven.

3554
02:34:25,059 --> 02:34:27,159
On December 27th,

3555
02:34:27,899 --> 02:34:30,000
all the trainees here...

3556
02:34:30,930 --> 02:34:33,399
will be performing live.

3557
02:34:33,540 --> 02:34:34,840
Oh, my.

3558
02:34:36,040 --> 02:34:38,209
Live?

3559
02:34:38,209 --> 02:34:39,909
It's finally here.

3560
02:34:40,180 --> 02:34:42,879
After hearing the official announcement,

3561
02:34:43,309 --> 02:34:44,909
I started getting a bit anxious.

3562
02:34:45,049 --> 02:34:49,180
I think I'll feel more nervous since it will be aired live.

3563
02:34:49,819 --> 02:34:52,819
I was determined to do even better.

3564
02:34:53,920 --> 02:34:55,459
In this project,

3565
02:34:55,459 --> 02:34:58,290
you'll be performing with three new songs...

3566
02:34:58,760 --> 02:35:01,930
depending on the assembly by the World Assemblers.

3567
02:35:02,430 --> 02:35:06,469
The composer who composed the top-tier mega-hit K-pop songs...

3568
02:35:07,170 --> 02:35:10,639
for NCT, SHINee, RIIZE, and EXO...

3569
02:35:10,940 --> 02:35:12,510
is Kenzie,

3570
02:35:13,540 --> 02:35:14,680
with her song "PSYCHO."

3571
02:35:18,549 --> 02:35:20,180
- "PSYCHO." - Oh, gosh.

3572
02:35:20,649 --> 02:35:21,750
She's a legend.

3573
02:35:28,459 --> 02:35:31,989
("PSYCHO" is a provocative song with confidence and an attitude.)

3574
02:35:31,989 --> 02:35:33,430
Look at that.

3575
02:35:33,530 --> 02:35:36,129
(The dance was created by Director RyuD.)

3576
02:35:43,940 --> 02:35:45,069
That's crazy.

3577
02:35:46,639 --> 02:35:49,209
It was powerful like hip-hop.

3578
02:35:49,309 --> 02:35:51,510
All the parts were eye-catching.

3579
02:35:53,219 --> 02:35:54,620
If I get assigned with that song,

3580
02:35:54,620 --> 02:35:57,350
I feel like I could perform it well.

3581
02:36:00,659 --> 02:36:02,620
- That was amazing. - It was so powerful.

3582
02:36:02,760 --> 02:36:04,260
This is the second song.

3583
02:36:04,389 --> 02:36:07,899
This is by Producer Young Chance, who produced "KOOL-AID..."

3584
02:36:08,260 --> 02:36:11,329
from the Original Matching, entitled "ACT UP."

3585
02:36:15,670 --> 02:36:19,739
("ACT UP" shows confidence and style with a groovy and hip-hop rhythm.)

3586
02:36:20,379 --> 02:36:24,110
(The choreography was created by Director Bada.)

3587
02:36:24,610 --> 02:36:25,649
So cool.

3588
02:36:26,350 --> 02:36:29,219
It had a rap and cool dance moves.

3589
02:36:29,389 --> 02:36:30,489
I loved it.

3590
02:36:31,319 --> 02:36:34,420
I was attracted...

3591
02:36:35,090 --> 02:36:38,190
to the aggressive and fierce moves.

3592
02:36:45,469 --> 02:36:46,799
Did you see that?

3593
02:36:46,799 --> 02:36:48,270
- Is that real? - That's crazy.

3594
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:50,639
I need to do that dance.

3595
02:36:50,909 --> 02:36:53,579
This is the last song we have.

3596
02:36:53,909 --> 02:36:56,110
This is a song by Producer FRANTS who created the song...

3597
02:36:56,110 --> 02:36:59,309
"Time After Time" from the Original Matching.

3598
02:37:01,520 --> 02:37:02,620
"Antidote."

3599
02:37:17,530 --> 02:37:19,670
("Antidote" is a song that expresses a desperate heart...)

3600
02:37:19,670 --> 02:37:21,069
(holding on to a fading love like an antidote.)

3601
02:37:30,379 --> 02:37:32,010
If I get assigned to "Antidote,"

3602
02:37:32,010 --> 02:37:33,979
I feel like I'd be able to fly around freely.

3603
02:37:35,020 --> 02:37:38,250
The moment I saw the dance, I wanted to perform it the most.

3604
02:37:47,200 --> 02:37:48,799
That was so cool.

3605
02:37:49,159 --> 02:37:51,600
I've fallen for that. I need to perform that song.

3606
02:37:52,729 --> 02:37:54,000
I want to do them all.

3607
02:37:54,739 --> 02:37:57,940
When I call your name,

3608
02:37:58,170 --> 02:38:01,280
please go up to the platform...

3609
02:38:01,280 --> 02:38:03,250
with the song you are assigned to.

3610
02:38:03,879 --> 02:38:07,479
Let's start with KIM HYUNWOO in the 21st place.

3611
02:38:07,549 --> 02:38:08,649
That's me!

3612
02:38:08,649 --> 02:38:09,790
Please come on up.

3613
02:38:10,149 --> 02:38:11,489
I'm curious.

3614
02:38:11,489 --> 02:38:13,120
I think he'll be sent to "ACT UP."

3615
02:38:13,590 --> 02:38:17,290
The song 21st-place KIM HYUNWOO is assembled to is...

3616
02:38:18,530 --> 02:38:19,600
"PSYCHO."

3617
02:38:20,229 --> 02:38:21,329
All right.

3618
02:38:21,329 --> 02:38:23,100
Thank you, World Assemblers.

3619
02:38:23,270 --> 02:38:26,639
Please go and stand on the platform...

3620
02:38:27,100 --> 02:38:28,670
with the song "PSYCHO."

3621

(KIM HYUNWOO is assigned to Team "PSYCHO.")

3622
02:38:30,809 --> 02:38:33,280
Performing with HYUNWOO would come out so good.

3623
02:38:35,479 --> 02:38:36,950
(Which trainee will be assembled next?)

3624
02:38:36,950 --> 02:38:41,319
Next is KIM JEONGMIN on the 18th place.

3626
02:38:43,819 --> 02:38:45,450
I wonder where JEONGMIN will go.

3627
02:38:45,750 --> 02:38:47,459
- JEONGMIN? Is he going to "PSYCHO?" - Please come on up.

3628
02:38:47,559 --> 02:38:49,659
- I think he'll go to "ACT UP." - What if he's going to "ACT UP?"

3629
02:38:50,030 --> 02:38:53,729
The song 18th-place KIM JEONGMIN is assigned to is...

3630
02:38:56,129 --> 02:38:57,200
"PSYCHO."

3631
02:39:03,270 --> 02:39:04,809
- It startled me. - Let's do our best.

3632
02:39:05,010 --> 02:39:07,010
- Yes. - It's our last performance.

3633
02:39:07,010 --> 02:39:08,079
Got it.

3634

It must be "PSYCHO."

3639

"ACT UP."

3640
02:39:23,860 --> 02:39:24,989
I was so glad.

3641
02:39:25,430 --> 02:39:28,829
I was attracted to the bright...

3642
02:39:28,829 --> 02:39:31,270
and cheerful energy of the song.

"Antidote."

02:40:52,909 --> 02:40:54,120
I'm not sure.

3674
02:40:54,950 --> 02:40:58,090
Trainee SONG SEUNGHO in sixth place is assembled to join...

3675
02:40:58,520 --> 02:40:59,790
"PSYCHO."

3676
02:40:59,860 --> 02:41:02,420
- We both got in with SEUNGHO. - I know.

3677
02:41:03,690 --> 02:41:07,229
Next is seventh-place JANG YEOJUN.

3678
02:41:07,229 --> 02:41:09,059
- Please come on up. - Let's go.

3679
02:41:09,059 --> 02:41:10,500
- YEOJUN, you have to come here. - Right.

3680
02:41:10,500 --> 02:41:11,569
Come on.

3681
02:41:12,229 --> 02:41:14,270
It's going to be unbelievable if YEOJUN goes to that team.

3682
02:41:14,770 --> 02:41:17,209
Trainee JANG YEOJUN is assembled to join...

3683
02:41:17,709 --> 02:41:18,739
"PSYCHO."

3684
02:41:18,739 --> 02:41:22,440
(Trainee JANG YEOJUN is assembled to Team "PSYCHO.")

3685
02:41:23,049 --> 02:41:25,510
- Come here. - Let's do this.

3686
02:41:28,620 --> 02:41:29,649
That can't be.

3687
02:41:30,120 --> 02:41:31,850
We currently have one slot left in "ACT UP..."

3688
02:41:31,850 --> 02:41:33,290
with two slots left...

3689
02:41:33,290 --> 02:41:36,020
in both "Antidote" and "PSYCHO" each.

3690
02:41:37,090 --> 02:41:40,399
Fifth-place Trainee MAJINGXIANG, please come on up.

3691
02:41:40,629 --> 02:41:41,760
Will he go to"PSYCHO?"

3692
02:41:42,329 --> 02:41:43,729
He belongs either here or at "ACT UP."

3693
02:41:44,629 --> 02:41:47,440
Trainee MAJINGXIANG in fifth place is assembled to join...

3694
02:41:47,899 --> 02:41:49,040
"ACT UP."

3695
02:41:49,299 --> 02:41:50,510
(MAJINGXIANG is assembled to join Team "ACT UP.")

3696
02:41:50,510 --> 02:41:51,569
Okay.

3697
02:41:51,569 --> 02:41:52,569
Welcome.

3698
02:41:52,569 --> 02:41:53,639
They're complete now.

3699
02:41:54,209 --> 02:41:59,250
- They're filled. - "ACT UP" has now been assembled.

3700
02:41:59,409 --> 02:42:01,819
Next is fourth-place Trainee KIM SUNGMIN.

3701
02:42:01,950 --> 02:42:02,979
Come here.

3702
02:42:03,950 --> 02:42:05,819
- Is he suddenly going to "PSYCHO?" - SUNGMIN might go to "PSYCHO."

3703
02:42:06,049 --> 02:42:08,360
Trainee KIM SUNGMIN in fourth place is assembled to join...

3704
02:42:08,959 --> 02:42:10,030
is "Antidote."

3705
02:42:10,860 --> 02:42:12,889
Trainee JEON MINWOOK, please come on up.

3706
02:42:13,030 --> 02:42:15,360
(3rd-place Trainee JEON MINWOOK moves to the front.)

3707
02:42:15,430 --> 02:42:17,100
What if he ends up going to "Antidote?"

3708
02:42:18,430 --> 02:42:19,469
MINWOOK, come to us.

3709
02:42:20,069 --> 02:42:23,409
Trainee JEON MINWOOK in third place is assembled to join...

3710
02:42:23,809 --> 02:42:24,870
"PSYCHO."

3711
02:42:24,870 --> 02:42:26,709
(JEON MINWOOK is assembled to join Team "PSYCHO.")

3712
02:42:26,709 --> 02:42:27,709
I knew it.

3713
02:42:27,979 --> 02:42:30,250
- We've got this. - This is great.

3714
02:42:30,250 --> 02:42:31,309
Let's do this.

3715
02:42:32,149 --> 02:42:33,879
That team must be a lot of fun.

3716
02:42:33,879 --> 02:42:34,920
I agree.

3717
02:42:34,920 --> 02:42:36,989
- They'll have fun in the finals. - Right.

3718
02:42:37,750 --> 02:42:38,850
It looks like fun.

3719
02:42:41,059 --> 02:42:42,420
We've got a good team too.

3720
02:42:42,420 --> 02:42:44,360
Yes, we've got the looks.

3721
02:42:44,489 --> 02:42:47,559
Only two trainees are waiting to be assembled.

3722
02:42:47,700 --> 02:42:49,229
- Why are they sitting the same? - They have the same pose.

3723
02:42:49,930 --> 02:42:51,500
- They look the same. - They have the perfect fit.

3724
02:42:52,770 --> 02:42:55,139
Please come on up.

3725
02:42:55,139 --> 02:42:56,139
(KENSHIN and KYOUNGBAE move to the front.)

3726
02:42:56,139 --> 02:42:57,270
I think he'll come to "PSYCHO."

3727
02:42:58,639 --> 02:43:01,739
Before seeing the dance, I really wanted to go to "Antidote,"

3728
02:43:02,610 --> 02:43:05,479
but after seeing the dance, I wish to join "ACT UP" now.

3729
02:43:07,120 --> 02:43:08,649
But they're full now.

3730
02:43:10,149 --> 02:43:12,950
I would like to go to "Antidote."

3731
02:43:13,690 --> 02:43:14,690
Come on.

3732
02:43:14,989 --> 02:43:17,530
I want to perform all of them,

3733
02:43:18,530 --> 02:43:20,229
but I want to join "PSYCHO."

3734
02:43:21,600 --> 02:43:24,000
- Yes! - Come to us.

3735
02:43:25,170 --> 02:43:27,200
They're perfectly split up.

3736
02:43:27,440 --> 02:43:30,309
Trainee SAKURADA KENSHIN is assembled to join...

3737
02:43:30,610 --> 02:43:32,569
- I think he'll come to "PSYCHO." - Please come to "PSYCHO."

3738
02:43:32,569 --> 02:43:33,709
I think he will.

3739
02:43:37,250 --> 02:43:38,450
"PSYCHO."

3740
02:43:38,450 --> 02:43:40,719
(SAKURADA KENSHIN is assembled to join Team "PSYCHO.")

3741
02:43:42,049 --> 02:43:43,049
Welcome.

3742
02:43:43,049 --> 02:43:45,149
- I knew you'd come. - We're so happy you're here.

3743
02:43:45,149 --> 02:43:46,450
- We're so happy. - Let's do this.

3744
02:43:46,450 --> 02:43:49,190
- I like this combination. - We're a team.

3745
02:43:50,290 --> 02:43:53,930
The song assembly of 21 trainees for the Final Match is...

3746
02:43:53,930 --> 02:43:55,229
now complete.

3747
02:43:56,229 --> 02:43:59,200
(The Final Matching songs have been assembled.)

3748
02:43:59,200 --> 02:44:01,200
Before moving on to your practice,

3749
02:44:01,899 --> 02:44:04,040
let me announce each of your parts.

3750
02:44:06,540 --> 02:44:07,739
- Now? - Right now?

3751
02:44:09,479 --> 02:44:10,479
Are we doing it now?

3752
02:44:10,479 --> 02:44:11,649
(Assembly of Team "PSYCHO" for the Final Matching)

3753
02:44:11,649 --> 02:44:12,979
(KENSHIN, MINWOOK, SEUNGHO, YEOJUN, HYUNWOO, JEONGMIN, HYUNWOO)

3754
02:44:12,979 --> 02:44:14,450
(Team "ACT UP": MAJINGXIANG, JUNWON, YICHEN,)

3755
02:44:14,450 --> 02:44:15,879
(ANDY, LYNNLYNN, SEYUN, JUNSEO)

3756
02:44:16,049 --> 02:44:17,489
(Team "Antidote": KYOUNGBAE, SUNGMIN, SIHUN,)

3757
02:44:17,489 --> 02:44:18,590
(JIWOON, HAJOON, BINGHUA, YOUNGSEO)

3758
02:44:25,829 --> 02:44:27,200
(Final Matching)

3759
02:44:27,200 --> 02:44:28,629
(Main vocal, all-rounder, sub-rappers 1 and 2, sub-vocalist 1)

3760
02:44:32,530 --> 02:44:33,940
This is how it's assigned.

3761
02:44:36,200 --> 02:44:38,010
We even have a part who's an all-rounder.

3762
02:44:38,969 --> 02:44:41,440
Team "Antidote" only has one rapper.

3763
02:44:42,979 --> 02:44:44,680
(All the trainees have entered.)

3764
02:44:45,010 --> 02:44:48,750
Let us now distribute the parts in each new song...

3765
02:44:48,750 --> 02:44:51,049
for each team in the Final Matching.

3766
02:44:56,159 --> 02:44:58,629
The distribution of parts will not be decided...

3767
02:44:58,790 --> 02:45:01,600
among the trainees.

3768
02:45:03,229 --> 02:45:05,530
- That sounds fun. - This distribution...

3769
02:45:05,530 --> 02:45:06,569
(The distribution of parts in the Final Matching)

3770
02:45:06,569 --> 02:45:11,010
will take place by pushing other parts away.

3771
02:45:11,709 --> 02:45:14,709
You will place your name on the part you want...

3772
02:45:15,340 --> 02:45:18,450
starting from the lowest-ranking trainee in the team.

3773
02:45:19,409 --> 02:45:21,649
For the higher-ranking trainees,

3774
02:45:22,250 --> 02:45:26,290
if the part you wish to take is already taken by another trainee,

3775
02:45:27,459 --> 02:45:30,030
you can push away the trainee...

3776
02:45:30,559 --> 02:45:32,229
and take the part for yourself.

3777
02:45:32,229 --> 02:45:33,629
(Pushing away the existing trainee to take the part)

3778
02:45:33,959 --> 02:45:35,899
Then put the name of that trainee...

3779
02:45:35,899 --> 02:45:38,299
in another part.

3780
02:45:38,469 --> 02:45:40,399
That means you don't have a choice, do you?

3781
02:45:40,670 --> 02:45:41,799
He's right.

3782
02:45:42,069 --> 02:45:44,110
But once YOUNGSEO places his name as the main vocalist,

3783
02:45:44,110 --> 02:45:45,940
who would dare to remove him?

3784
02:45:46,209 --> 02:45:47,909
Let's send YOUNGSEO to the sub-vocalist three.

3785
02:45:48,979 --> 02:45:52,879
It's not easy to be this cruel in so many ways.

3786
02:45:54,420 --> 02:45:57,590
Let's wait and see if everyone will end up...

3787
02:45:57,590 --> 02:45:59,319
with the parts they want.

3788
02:46:00,860 --> 02:46:02,219
Before starting the distribution,

3789
02:46:02,489 --> 02:46:05,360
you will be given 30 minutes to familiarize the song.

3790
02:46:05,360 --> 02:46:06,360
That's important.

3791
02:46:06,430 --> 02:46:08,200
After familiarizing the song,

3792
02:46:08,459 --> 02:46:11,670
we will start with the part removal.

3793
02:46:13,129 --> 02:46:14,840
- That sounds like fun. - So now,

3794
02:46:15,139 --> 02:46:17,309
we need to make a list of the part we want.

3795
02:46:18,370 --> 02:46:19,370
You're right.

3796
02:46:19,540 --> 02:46:22,110
Make a list of the parts you want in order.

3797
02:46:22,110 --> 02:46:23,110
Okay.

3798
02:46:23,110 --> 02:46:24,879
You can't choose twice.

3799
02:46:25,350 --> 02:46:27,219
Let's learn the song first.

3800
02:46:28,850 --> 02:46:29,850
Yes.

3801
02:46:30,790 --> 02:46:32,690
The rap sounds cool.

3802
02:46:34,219 --> 02:46:35,420
The rap part is cool.

3803
02:46:35,920 --> 02:46:38,229
(Glancing)

3804
02:46:39,360 --> 02:46:43,500
(They're learning the song in their own ways.)

3805
02:46:45,069 --> 02:46:46,170
This is driving me crazy.

3806
02:46:46,430 --> 02:46:48,299
I'm going crazy. I don't know what to do.

3807
02:46:48,899 --> 02:46:51,239
I don't know what part to choose.

3808
02:46:53,610 --> 02:46:55,409
There's one part I want.

3809
02:47:00,219 --> 02:47:02,680
It was like a competition...

3810
02:47:03,120 --> 02:47:06,319
where everyone was being careful.

3811
02:47:09,319 --> 02:47:12,790
Baby, you're my antidote

3812
02:47:12,790 --> 02:47:16,729
I only focused on and practiced the main vocal part.

3813
02:47:17,569 --> 02:47:19,100
But then,

3814
02:47:19,329 --> 02:47:20,870
SIHUN was in front of me,

3815
02:47:21,670 --> 02:47:23,840
and he was practicing the same part.

3816
02:47:24,540 --> 02:47:27,510
I felt like I was hanging...

3817
02:47:28,610 --> 02:47:30,309
by the end of a cliff.

3818
02:47:31,649 --> 02:47:32,950
Everyone probably feels the same.

3819
02:47:32,950 --> 02:47:35,850
(How will their part distribution go?)

3820
02:47:37,590 --> 02:47:40,420
Let's start with the lowest-ranking trainee,

3821
02:47:40,420 --> 02:47:42,520
Twenty-first-place Trainee KIM HYUNWOO in Team "PSYCHO."

3822
02:47:42,520 --> 02:47:43,959
- Yes! - Please come to the front.

3823
02:47:43,959 --> 02:47:45,159
Looking good.

3824
02:47:45,659 --> 02:47:48,760
(KIM HYUNWOO's turn to select his part.)

3825
02:47:48,860 --> 02:47:50,829
There's no position for the main dancer.

3826
02:47:51,100 --> 02:47:53,270
He'll probably put his name on something similar.

3827
02:47:57,639 --> 02:47:58,940
- He's quick. - Really?

3828
02:47:59,209 --> 02:48:00,239
He chose the second sub-rapper.

3829
02:48:00,239 --> 02:48:01,379
- That was neat. - He must be certain.

3830
02:48:01,510 --> 02:48:02,709
(KIM HYUNWOO in sub-rapper 2)

3831
02:48:02,709 --> 02:48:03,809
What a neat move.

3832
02:48:04,309 --> 02:48:05,379
Why is this making me nervous?

3833
02:48:06,209 --> 02:48:09,020
Next is 18th-place Trainee KIM JEONGMIN.

3834
02:48:09,020 --> 02:48:10,920
- Let's go. - See you later, JEONGMIN.

3835
02:48:11,319 --> 02:48:12,350
You're not going to push my name away, are you?

3836
02:48:12,719 --> 02:48:14,290
He'll probably take the position of the all-rounder.

3837
02:48:15,020 --> 02:48:17,190
- Or the main rapper. - I think I know where he'll put it.

3838
02:48:20,700 --> 02:48:22,659
(Trainee KIM JEONGMIN chooses the all-rounder.)

3839
02:48:22,659 --> 02:48:24,469
- There you go. - Please!

3840
02:48:24,469 --> 02:48:26,129
- That was a hip-hop move, JEONGMIN. - Hip-hop!

3841
02:48:26,129 --> 02:48:29,940
KIM JEONGMIN chose the position of the all-rounder.

3842
02:48:30,170 --> 02:48:32,739
Next is 17th-place Trainee KANG HYUNWOO.

3843
02:48:32,739 --> 02:48:34,239
- Let's go. - Please.

3844
02:48:34,239 --> 02:48:35,639
Hey, KANG!

3845
02:48:35,780 --> 02:48:37,809
I wonder which part HYUNWOO will take.

3846
02:48:38,110 --> 02:48:39,149
The main vocal?

3847
02:48:39,450 --> 02:48:41,520
You're not aiming for the rap, are you?

3848
02:48:42,120 --> 02:48:43,790
He's not going to take the all-rounder position, is he?

3849
02:48:44,190 --> 02:48:46,690
I joined this show as an all-rounder,

3850
02:48:47,959 --> 02:48:51,090
and I've mostly been doing the main vocalist.

3851
02:48:51,260 --> 02:48:52,559
Which will you choose between the two?

3852
02:48:55,200 --> 02:48:58,129
(The all-rounder or the main vocalist)

3853
02:48:58,129 --> 02:49:02,469
The main vocalist focuses more on the talent than the charm,

3854
02:49:04,040 --> 02:49:06,010
while the all-rounder will have...

3855
02:49:06,010 --> 02:49:08,639
the chance to show off his charm than his talent.

3856
02:49:11,409 --> 02:49:12,709
- Please! - Come on.

3857
02:49:12,750 --> 02:49:14,149
Oh, no.

3858
02:49:15,420 --> 02:49:16,520
(KIM JEONGMIN)

3859
02:49:19,149 --> 02:49:20,219
(Screaming)

3860
02:49:21,760 --> 02:49:24,989
(All-rounder)

3861
02:49:24,989 --> 02:49:26,459
- He took it off. - Please don't.

3862
02:49:26,590 --> 02:49:30,670
(He moved KIM JEONGMIN to the main vocalist position.)

3863
02:49:31,670 --> 02:49:33,170
No.

3864
02:49:33,399 --> 02:49:34,770
JEONGMIN to the main vocalist?

3865
02:49:36,440 --> 02:49:38,709
Goodness.

3866
02:49:38,909 --> 02:49:41,479
The main vocalist.

3867
02:49:41,879 --> 02:49:43,579
I didn't imagine this to be so much fun.

3868
02:49:43,579 --> 02:49:45,180
(KANG HYUNWOO chose the all-rounder position.)

3869
02:49:45,909 --> 02:49:47,120
Seriously?

3870
02:49:47,379 --> 02:49:49,520
Am I the main vocalist?

3871
02:49:51,149 --> 02:49:54,120
First, I felt so betrayed by HYUNWOO...

3872
02:49:54,120 --> 02:49:56,690
because he's the one who said...

3873
02:49:56,930 --> 02:49:58,190
that he wanted to be the main vocalist.

3874
02:49:58,329 --> 02:50:01,129
So I thought, "Okay. Then I'll take the all-rounder position."

3875
02:50:01,360 --> 02:50:02,530
Then he deserted me.

3876
02:50:02,760 --> 02:50:06,100
Next is seventh-place Trainee JANG YEOJUN.

3877
02:50:06,370 --> 02:50:08,399
- Is it me? - What choice would he make?

3878
02:50:09,569 --> 02:50:10,870
YEOJUN, are you going to take off my name?

3879
02:50:12,069 --> 02:50:13,940
Wouldn't YEOJUN take the vocalist position?

3880
02:50:14,040 --> 02:50:15,680
- Go. - No.

3881
02:50:19,280 --> 02:50:21,549
(JANG YEOJUN takes the second sub-vocalist position.)

3882
02:50:21,549 --> 02:50:23,379
- Look at his hips. Cute. - It's the ending part.

3883
02:50:23,520 --> 02:50:25,420
Right. It's the ending part.

3884
02:50:26,250 --> 02:50:29,020
(The second sub-vocalist part ends as the center for the ending.)

3885
02:50:29,159 --> 02:50:31,290
As I see, this part will have fierce competition.

3886
02:50:31,290 --> 02:50:32,389
I agree.

3887
02:50:33,159 --> 02:50:34,600
- He will take something off. - He'd rather take off my name.

3888
02:50:35,299 --> 02:50:38,870
I thought YEOJUN would probably pick the all-rounder.

3889
02:50:38,930 --> 02:50:41,340
But he took the second sub-vocalist position.

3890
02:50:41,469 --> 02:50:43,340
So I thought, "I can be the all-rounder."

3891
02:50:43,569 --> 02:50:46,069
Next is sixth-place Trainee SONG SEUNGHO.

3892
02:50:46,069 --> 02:50:47,639
(Trainee SONG SEUNGHO picks his part.)

3893
02:50:48,139 --> 02:50:49,379
You should do the main rapper.

3894
02:50:49,479 --> 02:50:52,049
You're a rapper.

3895
02:50:52,649 --> 02:50:53,850
I'm sorry.

3896
02:50:57,819 --> 02:50:58,889
Really?

3897
02:50:59,989 --> 02:51:01,319
He's making you nervous.

3898
02:51:01,319 --> 02:51:03,120
(Sub-rapper 2)

3899
02:51:03,120 --> 02:51:05,090
(SONG SEUNGHO moves KIM HYUNWOO.)

3900
02:51:05,090 --> 02:51:06,430
Did he take it off for real?

3901
02:51:06,790 --> 02:51:07,930
Did he really take it off?

3902
02:51:09,700 --> 02:51:11,430
This frightens me.

3903
02:51:12,170 --> 02:51:15,200
(KIM HYUNWOO is placed to the sub-rapper 1 position.)

3904
02:51:15,840 --> 02:51:17,709
(He chooses SONG SEUNGHO as a sub-rapper 2.)

3905
02:51:17,709 --> 02:51:18,969
- Did he take it off for real? - Did he actually take it off?

3906
02:51:19,809 --> 02:51:21,139
He wanted to do the sub-rapper two.

3907
02:51:21,139 --> 02:51:22,610
Did he really take it off?

3908
02:51:23,079 --> 02:51:25,709
Trainee SONG SEUNGHO moved Trainee KIM HYUNWOO...

3909
02:51:25,709 --> 02:51:28,479
to the sub-rapper one position.

3910
02:51:28,579 --> 02:51:30,120
This is thrilling. It's fun.

3911
02:51:30,120 --> 02:51:31,819
That's a better one.

3912
02:51:32,020 --> 02:51:33,549
I wanted to do your part.

3913
02:51:34,319 --> 02:51:36,459
It's okay. Both are fine with me.

3914
02:51:37,290 --> 02:51:40,030
Now is third-place Trainee JEON MINWOOK.

3915
02:51:40,299 --> 02:51:42,030
The real deal starts now.

3916
02:51:43,299 --> 02:51:46,430
Let's go, JEON MINWOOK!

3917
02:51:46,729 --> 02:51:48,340
MINWOOK will go on the top, I guess.

3918
02:51:48,870 --> 02:51:50,969
- He should do the main rapper. - He should go for it.

3919
02:51:51,239 --> 02:51:54,610
(JEON MINWOOK)

3920
02:51:56,040 --> 02:51:57,309
What? All-rounder?

3921
02:52:00,850 --> 02:52:01,950
What is he doing?

3922
02:52:03,149 --> 02:52:04,319
All-rounder?

3923
02:52:05,420 --> 02:52:07,590
- Really? - Is that for real?

3924
02:52:08,059 --> 02:52:09,219
What is he doing?

3925
02:52:10,260 --> 02:52:12,559
(He moves Trainee KANG HYUNWOO.)

3926
02:52:12,559 --> 02:52:13,799
Really?

3927
02:52:14,459 --> 02:52:15,930
That part has very high notes.

3928
02:52:15,930 --> 02:52:17,569
(JEON MINWOOK chooses the all-rounder position.)

3929
02:52:17,569 --> 02:52:18,799
Oh, my gosh.

3930
02:52:18,969 --> 02:52:20,270
Oh, my gosh!

3931
02:52:21,370 --> 02:52:25,010
(What will be KANG HYUNWOO's part?)

3932
02:52:33,250 --> 02:52:35,350
(KIM JEONGMIN)

3933
02:52:35,350 --> 02:52:38,520
(He moves KIM JEONGMIN to the main rapper position.)

3934
02:52:39,049 --> 02:52:40,090
That's not bad.

3935
02:52:40,090 --> 02:52:42,860
(KANG HYUNWOO is placed to the main vocalist position.)

3936
02:52:42,889 --> 02:52:45,629
Is he into singing these days?

3937
02:52:45,629 --> 02:52:47,959
Why did he choose the all-rounder part so suddenly?

3938
02:52:48,399 --> 02:52:51,069
It actually wasn't the first choice for me,

3939
02:52:51,229 --> 02:52:52,569
so I felt bitter.

3940
02:52:52,729 --> 02:52:56,540
The all-rounder part was changed twice already.

3941
02:52:56,739 --> 02:52:58,440
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

3942
02:52:58,739 --> 02:53:00,809
We didn't have to think hard in the first place.

3943
02:53:01,780 --> 02:53:03,540
- Trainee JEON MINWOOK. - Yes.

3944
02:53:03,540 --> 02:53:04,809
What's your strategy?

3945
02:53:04,979 --> 02:53:08,950
Since I joined this show, I wanted an all-rounder position,

3946
02:53:08,950 --> 02:53:10,950
and as the all-rounder position...

3947
02:53:10,950 --> 02:53:13,190
is in the Final Project, I wanted to take it.

3948
02:53:13,350 --> 02:53:15,020
When I watched the video.

3949
02:53:15,020 --> 02:53:19,629
I thought that his arrangement will make us look great.

3950
02:53:19,629 --> 02:53:23,399
So I rearranged other trainees' parts too.

3951
02:53:23,770 --> 02:53:26,870
This is fun when it's happening in another team.

3952
02:53:27,170 --> 02:53:29,469
Trainee SAKURADA KENSHIN is in first place.

3953
02:53:29,540 --> 02:53:34,040
The only part that remains is the first sub-vocalist.

3954
02:53:34,040 --> 02:53:35,879
Is it the part you wanted?

3955
02:53:36,180 --> 02:53:37,309
No, it isn't.

3956
02:53:39,479 --> 02:53:41,520
- Why? - I'm sorry.

3957
02:53:43,350 --> 02:53:44,950
We're going to witness a mass migration.

3958
02:53:44,950 --> 02:53:46,620
I feel he'd take my position.

3959
02:53:47,020 --> 02:53:49,120
It really breaks my heart.

3960
02:53:49,989 --> 02:53:51,329
What shall I do?

3961
02:53:51,329 --> 02:53:53,190
(SAKURADA KENSHIN chooses a part.)

3962
02:53:53,190 --> 02:53:55,799
KENSHIN, it's okay. We're a team. It's fine.

3963
02:53:56,500 --> 02:53:57,770
Do as you like.

3964
02:53:58,329 --> 02:54:00,299
This is hard. I don't know what to do.

3965
02:54:01,170 --> 02:54:02,200
I have no idea.

3966
02:54:02,399 --> 02:54:04,540
- First of all, Trainee KENSHIN. - Yes.

3967
02:54:04,540 --> 02:54:06,370
Which part do you want the most?

3968
02:54:06,639 --> 02:54:08,280
- There are two. - Okay.

3969
02:54:08,840 --> 02:54:09,940
Which ones?

3970
02:54:11,049 --> 02:54:12,280
This one and the one here.

3971
02:54:12,350 --> 02:54:15,520
(Main rapper and sub-vocalist 2)

3972
02:54:15,520 --> 02:54:18,649
JEONGMIN's position keeps changing.

3973
02:54:19,149 --> 02:54:20,219
Main!

3974
02:54:20,559 --> 02:54:24,430
I know JEONGMIN is a great rapper.

3975
02:54:24,590 --> 02:54:27,399
And I know YEOJUN also...

3976
02:54:27,530 --> 02:54:31,670
has a face that fits the ending.

3977
02:54:32,430 --> 02:54:34,540
- So this is too difficult. - Choose what you want.

3978
02:54:34,540 --> 02:54:36,799
- Choose what you like to do. - Choose what you want, KENSHIN.

3979
02:54:36,799 --> 02:54:38,209
- Choose it. - Do whatever you want.

3980
02:54:38,309 --> 02:54:40,409
It's fine with me.

3981
02:54:40,510 --> 02:54:43,709
What choice would Trainee KENSHIN make?

3982
02:54:46,409 --> 02:54:49,950
Everyone on my team is my rival.

3983
02:54:50,149 --> 02:54:53,649
And all of them are better than me,

3984
02:54:54,219 --> 02:54:55,559
so it was so hard for me.

3985
02:55:00,829 --> 02:55:02,329
What's that?

3986
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:06,129
(KIM JEONGMIN)

3987
02:55:07,200 --> 02:55:09,540
(SAKURADA KENSHIN chooses the main rapper position.)

3988
02:55:09,540 --> 02:55:11,440
Changing it again this time?

3989
02:55:12,010 --> 02:55:14,610
When KENSHIN attached his name,

3990
02:55:14,610 --> 02:55:16,180
I was flustered.

3991
02:55:16,309 --> 02:55:19,850
I thought the main rapper part was quite tough.

3992
02:55:21,280 --> 02:55:26,290
(The main rapper part is fast with a lot of lyrics.)

3993
02:55:27,559 --> 02:55:28,920
I wondered if he could make it.

3994
02:55:29,190 --> 02:55:32,590
I thought, "It would require a lot of effort."

3995
02:55:34,229 --> 02:55:35,559
No, KENSHIN. Please.

3996
02:55:35,559 --> 02:55:37,430
Move a bit higher.

3997
02:55:37,729 --> 02:55:39,469
- JEONGMIN. - Yes.

3998
02:55:39,469 --> 02:55:40,799
Are you good at singing?

3999
02:55:42,469 --> 02:55:43,700
Are you good at singing?

4000
02:55:45,440 --> 02:55:47,940
(KIM JEONGMIN is placed for the 1st sub-vocalist position.)

4001
02:55:47,940 --> 02:55:49,209
I'm sorry.

4002
02:55:49,979 --> 02:55:51,350
"Are you good at singing?"

4003
02:55:51,610 --> 02:55:52,649
Singing. Goodness.

4004
02:55:53,110 --> 02:55:55,520
Thank you.

4005
02:55:55,750 --> 02:55:57,120
Thank you for saving me.

4006
02:55:57,420 --> 02:55:58,950
KENSHIN is scary.

4007
02:56:01,489 --> 02:56:02,790
This is going to be fun.

4008
02:56:03,090 --> 02:56:04,659
It's so brutal.

4009
02:56:04,889 --> 02:56:06,260
Trainee KIM JEONGMIN...

4010
02:56:06,260 --> 02:56:08,260
was placed to the first sub-vocalist position...

4011
02:56:08,260 --> 02:56:10,030
in the end.

4012
02:56:11,129 --> 02:56:12,799
I love this.

4013
02:56:13,100 --> 02:56:14,940
- What was my part? - We're sorry, JEONGMIN.

4014
02:56:15,200 --> 02:56:19,469
In fact, I only listened to main vocalist and all-rounder parts.

4015
02:56:20,370 --> 02:56:22,440
So I have no idea what the first sub-vocalist part is.

4016
02:56:23,040 --> 02:56:26,909
Team "PSYCHO" completed its part division.

4017
02:56:26,909 --> 02:56:29,120
- Okay. - Good job, KENSHIN.

4018
02:56:29,120 --> 02:56:31,219
- I'm sorry. - It's okay. I love it.

4019
02:56:31,219 --> 02:56:33,190
- Our parts were changed. - Okay.

4020
02:56:33,250 --> 02:56:37,190
Next, we'll start dividing up the parts for Team "Antidote."

4021
02:56:37,790 --> 02:56:39,629
I'm not ready for this yet.

4022
02:56:39,659 --> 02:56:40,899
Please!

4023
02:56:41,829 --> 02:56:43,299
KYOUNGBAE, thank you in advance.

4024
02:56:44,229 --> 02:56:47,940
Fourteenth-place Trainee YOO YOUNGSEO of Team "Antidote,"

4025
02:56:47,940 --> 02:56:50,940
attach your name to the position you want.

4026
02:56:51,239 --> 02:56:52,739
Is YOUNGSEO the lowest in the ranking?

4027
02:56:52,969 --> 02:56:55,809
That team is higher in ranking on average.

4028
02:56:56,180 --> 02:56:57,950
Main vocalist!

4029
02:56:58,209 --> 02:57:00,350
- Why? - Go for it, YOUNGSEO.

4030
02:57:00,479 --> 02:57:01,520
There you go.

4031
02:57:01,520 --> 02:57:04,319
(Trainee YOO YOUNGSEO takes the main vocalist part.)

4032
02:57:04,350 --> 02:57:05,750
I feel kind of...

4033
02:57:07,790 --> 02:57:09,520
He's the main vocalist, as expected.

4034
02:57:09,819 --> 02:57:11,329
But we never know.

4035
02:57:11,360 --> 02:57:12,889
Trainee YOO YOUNGSEO...

4036
02:57:12,889 --> 02:57:16,360
took the main vocalist part of "Antidote."

4037
02:57:16,500 --> 02:57:19,770
Next is 12th-place Trainee BINGHUA.

4038
02:57:20,739 --> 02:57:22,739
- Let's go. - Go for it.

4039
02:57:23,170 --> 02:57:24,639
Is he going to take the main vocalist?

4040
02:57:25,709 --> 02:57:27,170
I can't see it.

4041
02:57:28,409 --> 02:57:32,409
BINGHUA is actually practicing the main vocalist part.

4042
02:57:32,510 --> 02:57:35,049
I thought BINGHUA could do it.

4043
02:57:35,049 --> 02:57:36,180
Not yet.

4044
02:57:36,319 --> 02:57:39,590
(Trainee BINGHUA takes the 2nd lead vocalist part.)

4045
02:57:41,459 --> 02:57:45,129
In fact, I thought, "That's a relief."

4046
02:57:45,459 --> 02:57:48,700
Seeing its song and dance, the part I wanted the most,

4047
02:57:48,760 --> 02:57:52,170
considering a stable live performance,

4048
02:57:52,930 --> 02:57:54,739
was the second lead vocalist part.

4049
02:57:59,069 --> 02:58:00,370
Why did you feel nervous?

4050
02:58:01,610 --> 02:58:02,979
This is crazy.

4051
02:58:05,149 --> 02:58:08,120
Next is tenth-place Trainee WOO HAJOON.

4052
02:58:08,450 --> 02:58:10,319
Which one would HAJOON pick?

4053
02:58:10,319 --> 02:58:11,420
What would he take?

4054
02:58:11,549 --> 02:58:14,219
I guess HAJOON will take the second lead vocalist part.

4055
02:58:14,520 --> 02:58:16,120
My hands get sweaty.

4056
02:58:16,559 --> 02:58:17,889
This is driving me crazy.

4057
02:58:23,860 --> 02:58:25,229
(Trainee WOO HAJOON takes the rapper position.)

4058
02:58:25,229 --> 02:58:26,700
- What? - Really?

4059
02:58:26,700 --> 02:58:28,969
- Rapper? - Did he put his name on right away?

4060
02:58:29,670 --> 02:58:32,610
Honestly, I wanted two parts the most,

4061
02:58:32,610 --> 02:58:34,209
lead vocalist 2 and sub-vocalist 1.

4062
02:58:34,209 --> 02:58:35,879
But I thought many people would want them too.

4063
02:58:36,180 --> 02:58:38,379
The rapper position stands out in the intro part...

4064
02:58:38,479 --> 02:58:42,750
with a solo performance and performs a whole section.

4065
02:58:44,420 --> 02:58:46,819
- There has been no change. - What's going on?

4066
02:58:47,020 --> 02:58:48,819
They might not take off someone else's name.

4067
02:58:49,020 --> 02:58:50,989
Next is ninth-place Trainee NAM JIWOON.

4068
02:58:51,389 --> 02:58:52,459
Yes.

4069
02:58:52,459 --> 02:58:54,530
(Trainee NAM JIWOON chooses his part.)

4070
02:58:55,559 --> 02:58:57,159
My mouth is going dry.

4071
02:58:59,030 --> 02:59:01,100
He's looking at the central part.

4072
02:59:01,840 --> 02:59:03,040
This is insane.

4073
02:59:05,239 --> 02:59:06,370
No way.

4074
02:59:09,239 --> 02:59:11,750
(Lead vocalist 2)

4075
02:59:11,750 --> 02:59:13,579
(NAM JIWOON selects the 2nd lead vocalist part.)

4076
02:59:13,579 --> 02:59:16,020
To where does he want to move BINGHUA?

4077
02:59:19,719 --> 02:59:21,489
(BINGHUA is placed to the lead vocalist 1.)

4078
02:59:21,489 --> 02:59:23,120
- It's fine. - It's not bad.

4079
02:59:25,860 --> 02:59:26,930
Sorry.

4080
02:59:29,229 --> 02:59:31,399
- Thank you. - What?

4081
02:59:31,399 --> 02:59:34,899
Trainee NAM JIWOON moved Trainee BINGHUA...

4082
02:59:34,899 --> 02:59:37,370
and took the lead vocalist two's part.

4083
02:59:37,809 --> 02:59:40,309
Actually, I wanted the lead vocalist one part too.

4084
02:59:40,309 --> 02:59:43,379
But I prioritize stability, so I picked the lead vocalist two.

4085
02:59:43,540 --> 02:59:44,610
He chose it strategically.

4086
02:59:44,610 --> 02:59:47,110
If I practice harder,

4087
02:59:47,110 --> 02:59:48,579
I think I can perform the lead vocalist one well too.

4088
02:59:48,920 --> 02:59:50,250
- That's nice. - You can do it.

4089
02:59:50,250 --> 02:59:51,489
I'm relieved.

4090
02:59:51,489 --> 02:59:53,649
For me, the sub-vocalist part seemed risky...

4091
02:59:53,649 --> 02:59:56,190
as I saw SUNGMIN and KYOUNGBAE...

4092
02:59:56,190 --> 02:59:57,860
who ranked high practicing.

4093
02:59:57,860 --> 02:59:59,459
I thought that part would get taken no matter what,

4094
02:59:59,459 --> 03:00:01,399
so I put my name on the lead vocalist part.

4095
03:00:01,600 --> 03:00:04,270
Next is Trainee KIM SIHUN who ranked eighth.

4096
03:00:05,229 --> 03:00:06,399
Seriously.

4097
03:00:07,370 --> 03:00:08,899
SIHUN, do not hesitate!

4098
03:00:10,299 --> 03:00:13,239
- I have no courage to see it. - Seriously.

4099
03:00:13,309 --> 03:00:15,079
I'll tell you the result.

4100
03:00:19,350 --> 03:00:20,850
I guess he'll pick the lead vocalist 1 or 2.

4101
03:00:20,850 --> 03:00:23,250
I don't think he'll pick the main vocalist part.

4102
03:00:25,850 --> 03:00:27,049
It's a civil war.

4103
03:00:29,860 --> 03:00:31,489
- Main vocalist? - Is he going for the main vocalist?

4104
03:00:35,659 --> 03:00:37,329
This is driving me insane.

4105
03:00:39,270 --> 03:00:41,969
I really felt sorry,

4106
03:00:42,069 --> 03:00:43,940
but I couldn't help since it's a survival show...

4107
03:00:43,940 --> 03:00:45,340
and I had to survive.

4108
03:00:45,870 --> 03:00:48,739
I was only praying desperately.

4109
03:00:50,280 --> 03:00:51,280
Look at that.

4110
03:00:51,280 --> 03:00:54,950
(He moved Trainee YOO YOUNGSEO.)

4111
03:00:54,950 --> 03:00:56,979
It's important where he moves it.

4112
03:00:57,149 --> 03:00:59,190
Where shall I take you?

4113
03:00:59,290 --> 03:01:01,190
YOUNGSEO, you turned pale. Are you all right?

4114
03:01:01,420 --> 03:01:02,559
It's because YOUNGSEO has fair skin.

4115
03:01:03,860 --> 03:01:05,229
This is the beginning, though.

4116
03:01:06,930 --> 03:01:08,229
This is the beginning, though.

4117
03:01:09,530 --> 03:01:12,129
(YOO YOUNGSEO is placed to the lead vocalist 1.)

4118
03:01:12,129 --> 03:01:13,469
No way.

4119
03:01:15,700 --> 03:01:19,110
(BINGHUA is placed to the sub-vocalist 1.)

4120
03:01:20,540 --> 03:01:21,940
At that time, seriously,

4121
03:01:22,440 --> 03:01:23,809
my team looked dark...

4122
03:01:24,010 --> 03:01:26,280
like the color of our clothes.

4123
03:01:26,549 --> 03:01:28,950
YOUNGSEO looked...

4124
03:01:28,950 --> 03:01:30,149
so upset.

4125
03:01:30,149 --> 03:01:31,690
But meanwhile,

4126
03:01:31,889 --> 03:01:36,190
the look on BINGHUA was tragic and gloomy.

4127
03:01:38,590 --> 03:01:40,360
The lead vocalist one...

4128
03:01:40,360 --> 03:01:41,629
is a beautiful part too.

4129
03:01:42,129 --> 03:01:44,200
There have been a lot of changes already.

4130
03:01:45,270 --> 03:01:48,340
Seeing the atmosphere there, I can't smile.

4131
03:01:49,969 --> 03:01:51,370
I'm sorry.

4132
03:01:51,969 --> 03:01:54,579
Trainee YOO YOUNGSEO is moved to the lead vocalist one,

4133
03:01:54,579 --> 03:01:58,709
and Trainee BINGHUA is moved to the sub-vocalist one.

4134
03:01:59,350 --> 03:02:01,520
Trainee KIM SUNGMIN...

4135
03:02:01,520 --> 03:02:05,090
picked the sub-vocalist two very peacefully.

4136
03:02:05,090 --> 03:02:06,219
(KIM SUNGMIN takes the sub-vocalist 2.)

4137
03:02:06,219 --> 03:02:08,489
(Sub-vocalist 3)

4138
03:02:08,760 --> 03:02:12,059
Trainee SEO KYOUNGBAE is the last one to pick.

4139
03:02:12,329 --> 03:02:13,760
KYOUNGBAE, pick what you want.

4140
03:02:14,860 --> 03:02:17,200
If he puts his name on the empty spot, everything will be set.

4141
03:02:18,000 --> 03:02:20,299
As I see, KYOUNGBAE will pick the sub-vocalist 2 or the rapper.

4142
03:02:21,940 --> 03:02:23,100
I guess his choice is in the upper section.

4143
03:02:24,200 --> 03:02:25,469
He's looking down.

4144
03:02:26,569 --> 03:02:27,569
It's down.

4145
03:02:27,569 --> 03:02:29,139
- Is it SUNGMIN? - No.

4146
03:02:31,479 --> 03:02:33,250
He made a gesture as if he was going to take something off.

4147
03:02:34,209 --> 03:02:35,719
I guess he's trying to measure it.

4148
03:02:36,719 --> 03:02:37,719
Did he take it off?

4149
03:02:39,319 --> 03:02:40,649
I guess he's trying to measure it.

4150
03:02:40,649 --> 03:02:41,889
(Trainee SEO KYOUNGBAE took off BINGHUA's name card.)

4151
03:02:41,889 --> 03:02:42,959
BINGHUA...

4152
03:02:43,819 --> 03:02:45,590
I guess he's trying to help BINGHUA.

4153
03:02:46,559 --> 03:02:48,299
No way. Is he going to put BINGHUA back to the lead vocalist?

4154
03:02:49,000 --> 03:02:51,329
I spent 25 minutes out of 30...

4155
03:02:51,329 --> 03:02:53,170
to see the rapper part only.

4156
03:02:53,569 --> 03:02:55,340
And it seemed to be such a small part.

4157
03:02:56,000 --> 03:02:59,010
So I looked at the sub-vocalist one,

4158
03:02:59,670 --> 03:03:01,139
and it had a killing part.

4159
03:03:02,610 --> 03:03:03,739
I'll go this way.

4160
03:03:08,219 --> 03:03:10,649
(SEO KYOUNGBAE chooses the sub-vocalist 1.)

4161
03:03:10,649 --> 03:03:11,719
He's on the sub-vocalist three.

4162
03:03:12,850 --> 03:03:14,049
BINGHUA is moved.

4163
03:03:14,420 --> 03:03:15,559
Oh, my goodness.

4164
03:03:15,559 --> 03:03:17,760
BINGHUA went down to the bottom.

4165
03:03:19,389 --> 03:03:20,760
I was so bewildered.

4166
03:03:22,000 --> 03:03:24,500
To be honest, the sub-vocalist three...

4167
03:03:24,500 --> 03:03:26,729
was the part I wanted to avoid the most.

4168
03:03:26,799 --> 03:03:29,139
I wanted to avoid it even more than the rapper part.

4169
03:03:29,739 --> 03:03:32,309
Considering the song only,

4170
03:03:33,510 --> 03:03:35,309
the part is so easy.

4171
03:03:36,639 --> 03:03:39,649
Regarding the part, BINGHUA suffers so many difficulties...

4172
03:03:40,850 --> 03:03:41,850
all along...

4173
03:03:42,479 --> 03:03:43,549
in every team.

4174
03:03:44,520 --> 03:03:46,020
He had a hard time because of the part earlier.

4175
03:03:46,020 --> 03:03:47,590
I know. This time, it's because of the part again.

4176
03:03:48,889 --> 03:03:51,329
The moment you take the card off, you get to feel sorry for someone.

4177
03:03:53,260 --> 03:03:54,500
Why?

4178
03:03:55,430 --> 03:03:57,930
You want to perform rap. Why did you...

4179
03:03:57,930 --> 03:03:59,100
Rapper...

4180
03:03:59,399 --> 03:04:01,100
It happened this way.

4181
03:04:02,399 --> 03:04:03,399
Seriously.

4182
03:04:03,739 --> 03:04:05,770
The atmosphere was bleak and gloomy.

4183
03:04:06,969 --> 03:04:08,639
I felt so sorry, in fact,

4184
03:04:09,079 --> 03:04:11,850
but it's a survival show afterall.

4185
03:04:12,979 --> 03:04:14,879
Lastly, Team "ACT UP."

4186
03:04:14,879 --> 03:04:18,090
The one ranked lowest in the Team "ACT UP,"

4187
03:04:18,120 --> 03:04:19,489
twentieth-place Trainee PARK JUNSEO,

4188
03:04:20,049 --> 03:04:22,290
put your name on the part you want to perform.

4189
03:04:22,860 --> 03:04:24,020
JUNSEO.

4190
03:04:24,020 --> 03:04:25,290
JUNSEO, just put it vertically.

4191
03:04:28,159 --> 03:04:29,260
(PARK JUNSEO)

4192
03:04:30,559 --> 03:04:32,100
The parts I wanted were...

4193
03:04:32,129 --> 03:04:34,670
the main rapper, the lead vocalist,

4194
03:04:34,670 --> 03:04:36,299
and lastly, the sub-vocalist two.

4195
03:04:38,469 --> 03:04:39,840
Although I think hard about this, It doesn't matter anyway.

4196
03:04:40,739 --> 03:04:41,940
No, don't give up.

4197
03:04:42,040 --> 03:04:43,440
You should put it on the main vocalist.

4198
03:04:43,510 --> 03:04:45,250
(Surprised)

4199
03:04:45,250 --> 03:04:46,379
He's ambitious.

4200
03:04:46,709 --> 03:04:48,280
You should put it on the main vocalist.

4201
03:04:48,280 --> 03:04:50,719
He's ambitious.

4202
03:04:50,719 --> 03:04:52,219
(PARK JUNSEO takes the lead vocalist part.)

4203
03:04:52,649 --> 03:04:55,860
The lead vocalist is a position which its chorus part...

4204
03:04:55,860 --> 03:04:58,889
keeps the balance with the performance,

4205
03:04:59,360 --> 03:05:00,629
so I thought I could pull it off well.

4206
03:05:01,760 --> 03:05:03,329
- Really? - Seriously?

4207
03:05:04,129 --> 03:05:05,170
Nice.

4208
03:05:05,870 --> 03:05:08,469
Next is 19th-place Trainee JUNG SEYUN.

4209
03:05:08,600 --> 03:05:10,239
(19th-place Trainee JUNG SEYUN makes a choice.)

4210
03:05:10,239 --> 03:05:12,409
- It's okay. Just go for it. - Go!

4211
03:05:12,409 --> 03:05:14,270
SEYUN might go right away and do this.

4212
03:05:19,010 --> 03:05:20,180
What was that?

4213
03:05:20,209 --> 03:05:21,379
He surprised me.

4214
03:05:22,719 --> 03:05:24,649
You surprised me, SEYUN!

4215
03:05:25,549 --> 03:05:26,790
You're wicked.

4216
03:05:26,790 --> 03:05:28,360
(JUNG SEYUN takes the sub-rapper 1 part.)

4217
03:05:28,360 --> 03:05:29,819
JUNSEO really looks surprised.

4218
03:05:30,889 --> 03:05:33,729
Next is 16th-place Trainee LYNNLYNN.

4219
03:05:33,729 --> 03:05:36,229
- Yes. - From 35th to 16th place.

4220
03:05:36,600 --> 03:05:37,930
He's the man who creates a miracle.

4221
03:05:40,700 --> 03:05:42,940
He surprised me.

4222
03:05:42,940 --> 03:05:44,069
(He pretends moving a name card, and takes the main vocalist part.)

4223
03:05:46,209 --> 03:05:49,940
In the Team "ACT UP," no one has moved other members yet.

4224
03:05:50,180 --> 03:05:51,510
They're still peaceful.

4225
03:05:52,350 --> 03:05:53,809
Look at ANDY. It will be over soon.

4226
03:05:53,809 --> 03:05:55,149
- ANDY... - ANDY will end it soon.

4227
03:05:55,149 --> 03:05:56,180
(Trainee ANDY in 15th place makes a choice.)

4228
03:05:56,180 --> 03:05:57,549
It's 15th-place Trainee ANDY.

4229
03:05:58,250 --> 03:05:59,350
ANDY will take the lead vocalist.

4230
03:06:00,190 --> 03:06:01,459
ANDY, it's okay.

4231
03:06:01,489 --> 03:06:02,620
Pick what you want.

4232
03:06:02,819 --> 03:06:04,090
I know it's me, anyway.

4233
03:06:04,690 --> 03:06:06,229
Your pick can also be moved anyway.

4234
03:06:06,860 --> 03:06:08,030
I'm sorry.

4235
03:06:10,729 --> 03:06:12,399
(ANDY pushes away JUNSEO and picks the lead vocalist part.)

4236
03:06:12,930 --> 03:06:14,000
Where will he put it?

4237
03:06:14,299 --> 03:06:16,239
It's also important where he moves my card.

4238
03:06:18,639 --> 03:06:21,309
(PARK JUNSEO is placed to the sub-vocalist 2.)

4239
03:06:21,309 --> 03:06:22,739
Going to the sub-vocalist two.

4240
03:06:24,780 --> 03:06:26,979
Inside, although it's easygoing,

4241
03:06:26,979 --> 03:06:29,219
I was worried about the high notes...

4242
03:06:29,219 --> 03:06:31,219
and I thought, "That's a relief."

4243
03:06:31,219 --> 03:06:33,290
"I won't have to sing high notes."

4244
03:06:33,319 --> 03:06:37,190
Trainee PARK JUNSEO was moved to the sub-vocalist two.

4245
03:06:37,219 --> 03:06:40,559
Next is 13th-place Trainee YICHEN.

4246
03:06:41,459 --> 03:06:42,760
You can go where you want.

4247
03:06:43,159 --> 03:06:45,000
- Okay. - Uncle, go for it!

4248
03:06:45,000 --> 03:06:46,129
You can do it.

4249
03:06:46,329 --> 03:06:47,770
Gosh, what shall I do?

4250
03:06:48,639 --> 03:06:50,340
Your eyes are already fixed.

4251
03:06:50,969 --> 03:06:54,170
He can't decide between the lead vocalist and the main rapper.

4252
03:06:55,579 --> 03:06:57,280
His eyes are so fixed on ANDY's name card.

4253
03:06:58,950 --> 03:07:00,110
Lead vocalist?

4254
03:07:02,879 --> 03:07:04,750
Oh, my gosh!

4255
03:07:04,950 --> 03:07:06,790
- You don't like the uncle? - No.

4256
03:07:06,790 --> 03:07:07,920
- Okay. - Gosh.

4257
03:07:08,489 --> 03:07:09,620
Look at that.

4258
03:07:10,719 --> 03:07:13,430
I have no choice anyway.

4259
03:07:13,889 --> 03:07:15,530
Everyone wants the lead vocalist part.

4260
03:07:15,860 --> 03:07:17,000
I guess the lead vocalist's part is nice.

4261
03:07:17,000 --> 03:07:19,200
It seems to be the center part of the chorus section.

4262
03:07:19,729 --> 03:07:22,700
Trainee YICHEN moved Trainee ANDY...

4263
03:07:22,799 --> 03:07:24,739
and took the lead vocalist part.

4264
03:07:24,870 --> 03:07:27,840
Now is 11th-place Trainee AHN JUNWON.

4265
03:07:27,840 --> 03:07:29,180
Is this getting close...

4266
03:07:29,180 --> 03:07:30,979
to the picture in your mind or not?

4267
03:07:30,979 --> 03:07:33,879
To tell you the truth,

4268
03:07:33,879 --> 03:07:36,020
I think there will be a lot of changes.

4269
03:07:38,420 --> 03:07:40,049
You should go there without hesitation.

4270
03:07:40,489 --> 03:07:42,459
(11th-place Trainee AHN JUNWON makes a choice.)

4271
03:07:42,559 --> 03:07:44,729
- It's all right. - It's fine.

4272
03:07:45,329 --> 03:07:47,030
He's making an apology in advance.

4273
03:07:47,760 --> 03:07:49,430
What part does JUNWON want?

4274
03:07:49,799 --> 03:07:52,069
Is it the main rapper?

4275
03:07:52,069 --> 03:07:53,129
Let's go.

4276
03:07:59,469 --> 03:08:02,010
(AHN JUNWON picks the main vocalist part.)

4277
03:08:02,340 --> 03:08:03,510
Nice.

4278
03:08:03,510 --> 03:08:05,979
(Team members are surprised at his bold choice.)

4279
03:08:07,149 --> 03:08:08,750
Please.

4280
03:08:10,750 --> 03:08:12,420
This is really stressful.

4281
03:08:13,120 --> 03:08:14,489
It's even more stressful if you look at them.

4282
03:08:14,489 --> 03:08:16,219
Do as you like. Just look to the front.

4283
03:08:16,719 --> 03:08:18,790
I'll be a villain only once.

4284
03:08:18,889 --> 03:08:20,690
Instead, I trust myself.

4285
03:08:20,690 --> 03:08:23,159
I trust my insight of seeing the performance.

4286
03:08:23,399 --> 03:08:24,969
(Which part would Trainee LYNNLYNN take?)

4287
03:08:24,969 --> 03:08:26,030
I won't look at you.

4288
03:08:28,139 --> 03:08:29,739
Is he moving him to the sub-rapper position?

4289
03:08:30,540 --> 03:08:31,639
It's tough.

4290
03:08:31,709 --> 03:08:33,270
What's that? Rap?

4291
03:08:33,670 --> 03:08:34,940
Is SEYUN the lead vocalist?

4292
03:08:34,940 --> 03:08:35,979
(Moving Trainee JUNG SEYUN to the sub-vocalist 1?)

4293
03:08:35,979 --> 03:08:37,940
No, never!

4294
03:08:38,510 --> 03:08:40,350
Please.

4295
03:08:41,149 --> 03:08:42,979
It's okay. It's fine.

4296
03:08:45,389 --> 03:08:48,260
(JUNG SEYUN is placed to the sub-vocalist 1.)

4297
03:08:50,520 --> 03:08:51,590
(ANDY is placed to the sub-vocalist 2.)

4298
03:08:51,590 --> 03:08:53,059
He's changing everything.

4299
03:08:53,989 --> 03:08:56,659
JUNWON changed everything all of a sudden.

4300
03:08:56,899 --> 03:08:59,899
Why? It made me so angry.

4301
03:09:00,399 --> 03:09:01,600
Okay, left.

4302
03:09:01,600 --> 03:09:03,639
(Trainee YICHEN's name card is taken off too.)

4303
03:09:04,770 --> 03:09:06,540
JUNWON saved you, JUNSEO.

4304
03:09:06,840 --> 03:09:08,540
Is he moving JUNSEO to the lead vocalist?

4305
03:09:10,209 --> 03:09:11,680
What? What's wrong with him?

4306
03:09:12,049 --> 03:09:13,280
That's so strange.

4307
03:09:14,719 --> 03:09:15,719
(He places YICHEN and LYNNLYNN to the sub-rapper 1 and 2.)

4308
03:09:15,719 --> 03:09:16,950
He changed the whole picture.

4309
03:09:17,350 --> 03:09:18,620
He literally has changed everything.

4310
03:09:18,620 --> 03:09:19,920
- Amazing. - No way.

4311
03:09:19,920 --> 03:09:21,760
Vocalist.

4312
03:09:22,260 --> 03:09:25,360
This is actually assigned by JUNWON.

4313
03:09:26,659 --> 03:09:28,500
When JUNWON moved me back,

4314
03:09:29,200 --> 03:09:32,870
I felt happy, and I also felt puzzled a bit.

4315
03:09:33,200 --> 03:09:35,770
Why did he have to change the part like that?

4316
03:09:35,799 --> 03:09:38,170
I was speechless.

4317
03:09:38,409 --> 03:09:40,709
First, I felt so sorry for team members.

4318
03:09:40,770 --> 03:09:44,879
I clearly knew already what MAJINGXIANG wanted.

4319
03:09:45,209 --> 03:09:47,180
I made the part MAJINGXIANG wants the most vacant...

4320
03:09:47,450 --> 03:09:49,049
and according to what I thought,

4321
03:09:49,280 --> 03:09:51,819
I changed it to the best positions...

4322
03:09:51,819 --> 03:09:55,360
that will show the best performance of "ACT UP."

4323
03:09:56,290 --> 03:10:00,090
Then I'll choose the main rapper part.

4324
03:10:00,559 --> 03:10:03,000
Trainee MAJINGXIANG chose the last place remaining,

4325
03:10:03,399 --> 03:10:07,229
the main rapper part which was vacant.

4326
03:10:08,239 --> 03:10:10,170
So many things happened...

4327
03:10:10,270 --> 03:10:14,370
in the part division of Team "ACT UP," and it's complete now.

4328
03:10:14,670 --> 03:10:16,239
We still...

4329
03:10:16,639 --> 03:10:18,649
did it smoothly.

4330
03:10:19,010 --> 03:10:20,280
This is so brutal.

4331
03:10:21,180 --> 03:10:22,979
We're starting it with conflicts.

4332
03:10:23,350 --> 03:10:26,989
After dividing up parts, there's one thing also important.

4333
03:10:26,989 --> 03:10:27,989
That's...

4334
03:10:27,989 --> 03:10:29,690
- The center? - The center?

4335
03:10:30,659 --> 03:10:32,190
the killing part.

4336
03:10:33,559 --> 03:10:35,629
- Is that so? - Is there a killing part?

4337
03:10:36,200 --> 03:10:37,829
I never predicted it.

4338
03:10:38,129 --> 03:10:41,770
I thought it wouldn't go smoothly.

4339
03:10:41,799 --> 03:10:45,239
In the three new songs for Final Matching, there's a killing part.

4340
03:10:45,440 --> 03:10:49,180
Only one in each team can take it.

4341
03:10:49,440 --> 03:10:53,049
All of you have a chance to try the killing part.

4342
03:10:53,379 --> 03:10:54,979
It will be a fierce competition.

4343
03:10:55,319 --> 03:10:57,750
Now that the main vocalist part was taken by someone else,

4344
03:10:57,750 --> 03:10:59,250
I have to take the killing part.

4345
03:10:59,319 --> 03:11:00,790
This is it.

4346
03:11:00,790 --> 03:11:03,319
I can come one step closer to the debut.

4347
03:11:03,659 --> 03:11:05,930
I will take it.

4348
03:11:06,059 --> 03:11:07,889
I have to debut.

4349
03:11:11,500 --> 03:11:15,170
(Who will take the killing part in each team?)

4350
03:11:17,000 --> 03:11:18,969
World Assemblers, please select...

4351
03:11:18,969 --> 03:11:21,940
trainees to perform the killing parts.

4352
03:11:22,139 --> 03:11:24,739
(How to vote for the killing parts of Final Matching)

4353
03:11:24,739 --> 03:11:27,680
It will be decided by the number of likes for the videos...

4354
03:11:27,680 --> 03:11:29,649
uploaded on the official SNS of PROJECT 7.

4355
03:11:32,649 --> 03:11:35,290
(Vote for the killing parts of Final Matching)

4356
03:11:35,559 --> 03:11:36,719
(The final live broadcast)

4357
03:11:36,719 --> 03:11:40,159
(Incheon Namdong Gymnasium, December 27, Friday)

4358
03:11:43,229 --> 03:11:46,600
Here, 200 trainees have gathered.

4359
03:11:47,129 --> 03:11:48,469
(The first project)

4360
03:11:48,469 --> 03:11:49,940
(Zero Setting)

4361
03:11:49,940 --> 03:11:51,709
- You're eliminated. - You're eliminated.

4362
03:11:51,809 --> 03:11:52,809
You're passed.

4363
03:11:53,510 --> 03:11:55,579
(The second project, Title Song)

4364
03:11:56,680 --> 03:11:58,809
(The third project, Position Matching)

4365
03:12:03,549 --> 03:12:06,319
(The fourth project)

4366
03:12:06,319 --> 03:12:09,190
(The fifth project)

4367
03:12:09,290 --> 03:12:10,860
(The number of trainees who can make it to debut team...)

4368
03:12:10,860 --> 03:12:13,559
(is only 7.)

4369
03:12:16,299 --> 03:12:18,729
(The sixth project)

4370
03:12:21,329 --> 03:12:23,340
(I'm about to open the door to debut.)

4371
03:12:24,200 --> 03:12:26,370
(A chance has come to me like a miracle,)

4372
03:12:26,370 --> 03:12:27,440
(and I won't miss it.)

4373
03:12:28,110 --> 03:12:30,040
(I will break my limits.)

4374
03:12:30,379 --> 03:12:33,010
(I'd like to overcome the barrier of 7th place.)

4375
03:12:33,809 --> 03:12:35,819
(I have confidence to win, no matter what.)

4376
03:12:36,180 --> 03:12:38,590
(I don't want to let go of my dream.)

4377
03:12:39,219 --> 03:12:41,489
(I will pour into everything I have.)

4378
03:12:42,190 --> 03:12:46,329
(Who will make it to the debut team after the seventh project?)

4379
03:12:47,729 --> 03:12:51,930
(PROJECT 7)
