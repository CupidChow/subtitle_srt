1
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:04,540
(At last, Original Matching is revealed.)

2
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:08,949
(They show the performances of new songs on their names.)

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,019
I love that song.

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,690
It's just like a music show.

5
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,260
(JIWOON, you can do it.)

6
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:28,500
(They look like they just came out of a cartoon!)

7
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:36,810
(This is just like a music awards performance.)

8
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,159
I feel like tearing up. I mean it.

9
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:59,229
(Unexpected team benefits?)

10
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:02,929
(10 percent of the individual voting score)

11
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,739
(Unprecedented benefits linked to the voting)

12
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:12,639
I thought I could go to the final with the extra ten percent.

13
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,249
I've won first place for many times in PROJECT 7.

14
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,920
(Fierce competition for 1st place)

15
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:18,980
(Individual ranks)

16
00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:21,090
(The result goes into reverse.)

17
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,030
(Feelings of joy and sadness)

18
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:28,790
I felt sad at that moment.

19
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,000
(Who's the winner to take benefits in Original Matching?)

20
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,328
(PROJECT 7)

21
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:35,500
World Assemblers,

22
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:39,040
the third global voting of PROJECT 7 is in progress.

23
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,238
You can participate in the voting on the official platform...

24
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:44,379
once a day.

25
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,079
Access to the PROJECT 7's community and click on the voting link...

26
00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:50,280
to participate in two kinds of votes.

27
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,120
The first is the Individual Vote.

28
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,590
Among 35 trainees, select 3 trainees you support.

29
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:00,459
After completing the Individual Vote, click the Next button.

30
00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:03,459
The second is the Final Matching Assembly Vote.

31
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:06,560
The new songs of PROJECT 7 will be released now.

32
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:14,939
(Preview of the new song, "ACT UP")

33
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:36,360
(Preview of the new song, "Antidote")

34
00:02:55,449 --> 00:03:03,419
(Preview of the new song, "PSYCHO")

35
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:22,469
After listening to the three new songs revealed,

36
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:25,639
assemble the trainees that match the song on your own.

37
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:29,448
Click the Assemble button, and select seven trainees...

38
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:31,080
that match each song the most.

39
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:34,250
Your participation is complete when you click the Complete button.

40
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:37,489
Your votes will be reflected on the results when completing both.

41
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,889
Don't forget to participate in both votes.

42
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:42,129
World Assemblers, at 7am tomorrow,

43
00:03:42,729 --> 00:03:44,900
the third global voting will be closed.

44
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,269
(Apply to watch the Final Round, November 29 to December 18)

45
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:52,439
(Visit the official SNS for details.)

46
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,939
(The night before the competition)

47
00:03:55,639 --> 00:04:00,650
(Trainees keep practicing although it's late.)

48
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:02,109
Super natural

49
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,879
Dizzy days

50
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,819
Isn't ANDY supposed to hit here?

51
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:09,490
You should hit the pit of the stomach.

52
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:12,019
How many times does SEYUN have to tell you not to hit your eyebrows?

53
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,629
I'm doing it right.

54
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,100
SUNGMIN also kept making mistakes today, to be honest.

55
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,000
Why are you picking on me?

56
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:21,229
It's your part.

57
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,800
- But I did it all right. - That's wrong.

58
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,509
(Reading other people's faces)

59
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,609
(Laughing)

60
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,479
(Meanwhile, team members burst into laughing.)

61
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,680
Why are you considering only your position?

62
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,319
(Only KENSHIN looks serious.)

63
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,050
ANDY, that's what you said.

64
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,550
Hi, KENSHIN.

65
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:44,920
- KENSHIN. - Hi.

66
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,819
It's KENSHIN's birthday today.

67
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,689
Shall we pretend to be arguing for real?

68
00:04:49,029 --> 00:04:50,088
What's the scenario?

69
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:51,659
- First, I'll say... - Tell him this move was wrong.

70
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,929
ANDY, why can't you do this right? We need to perform it tomorrow.

71
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,740
I got one thing wrong, but SUNGMIN got everything wrong today.

72
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,068
- Why are you blaming me? - You got all wrong.

73
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:03,310
We're talking about your fault. What?

74
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:05,339
- We're acting. - All right.

75
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:06,740
It's for KENSHIN's birthday.

76
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:10,680
We argue, you leave the room, and then I leave.

77
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:13,179
- I followed the choreography. - But...

78
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,349
- You could do it right. - We're telling you your fault,

79
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:18,490
but you keep saying you were right. What's the use of saying so?

80
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,388
It's true that I'm not doing this part right,

81
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:21,688
but SUNGMIN isn't doing it right either.

82
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:23,430
Why are you blaming me?

83
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,929
Why do you blame SUNGMIN, all of a sudden?

84
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,870
I got it right just now. SUNGMIN got it wrong.

85
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,269
- So suddenly? - ANDY.

86
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:37,339
You're now making everything worse.

87
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,679
- You should swallow your emotions. - I asked you whether you got this.

88
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,948
I criticized you when my dance was worse than yours.

89
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:43,719
- Did you get angry about that? - No, I didn't.

90
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,720
You did.

91
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:47,318
- You roughly... - They're not..

92
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,649
In a good mood.

93
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,220
(Restless)

94
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,860
Earlier...

95
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,199
Where are you going?

96
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,230
- Where are you going, ANDY? - Where are you going?

97
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,899
What's wrong?

98
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,839
What's wrong with him?

99
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:09,040
What's the matter?

100
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,110
We have a rehearsal tomorrow, ANDY.

101
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:13,139
(You shouldn't leave.)

102
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,110
- Okay. - I'll go see him.

103
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,480
- I should go too. - No.

104
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,849
I should go too.

105
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:23,050
SEYUN, practice the choreography here.

106
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:26,720
(Desperately stopping KENSHIN from leaving the room)

107
00:06:27,629 --> 00:06:30,529
The atmosphere is so heavy.

108
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,300
(ANDY and SEUNGHO are excited to tease KENSHIN.)

109
00:06:40,339 --> 00:06:41,370
ANDY.

110
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:51,319
(Paying attention to others)

111
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,620
What shall I do?

112
00:06:56,089 --> 00:06:57,188
(All you have to do is to get surprised.)

113
00:06:57,189 --> 00:07:00,529
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

114
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:04,230
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

115
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,600
- Happy birthday to you - Gosh!

116
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,839
- Happy birthday, dear KENSHIN - Oh, my!

117
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:15,068
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

118
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:16,938
- Blow the candles. - Oh, gosh.

119
00:07:16,939 --> 00:07:18,609
(Shocked)

120
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:19,938
This one went out.

121
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:20,949
Light it again.

122
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,110
Okay.

123
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,619
Okay. 1, 2, 3.

124
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,990
(Making a wish and blowing candles)

125
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,120
Oh, my goodness!

126
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,720
Gosh.

127
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:37,430
I was really surprised. Gosh.

128
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:39,258
I need to give this to KENSHIN.

129
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:40,829
- KENSHIN. - What's this?

130
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,639
Since it's our dear KENSHIN's birthday...

131
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,499
We wrote a letter to KENSHIN.

132
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,839
(Team members prepared a birthday letter.)

133
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:51,980
(Using a machine translator)

134
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,279
I think this will make KENSHIN cry.

135
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:59,819
KENSHIN? He'd definitely cry when he sees this.

136
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,220
We put so much effort with stickers and all.

137
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:07,759
(They completed a rolling paper for KENSHIN.)

138
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,930
Oh, my goodness. No letters, please.

139
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:14,470
- It will make me cry. - Will you cry?

140
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,499
Gosh, but it's in Korean.

141
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,970
(Bewildered to see the paper filled with Korean)

142
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:21,469
For KENSHIN who is Japanese,

143
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,740
each of us will read the message.

144
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,180
To SAKURADA KENSHIN.

145
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:26,879
Hi, KENSHIN, born in 2007.

146
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,779
For your birthday,

147
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,620
I wrote a rolling paper with team members.

148
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:35,250
I admire KENSHIN practicing hard on his birthday.

149
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:39,019
I hope our performance takes first place for your birthday present.

150
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,529
- Dear KENSHIN. Hi, KENSHIN. - Oh, my goodness.

151
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,829
- SUNGMIN. - For "Pipo Pipo," "Jealousy,"

152
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:45,759
and now "Merry-Go-Round," we're on the same team. I'm SUNGMIN.

153
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,499
Thank you for livening up the team's mood with your smile,

154
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,769
and congratulate your birthday from the bottom of my heart.

155
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,869
Instead of spending your 18th birthday with your family,

156
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,969
you're here with us.

157
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,569
It might not be the perfect one.

158
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,039
I sincerely congratulate you on your birthday.

159
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,950
I hope you keep showing us your great smile, kid.

160
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,750
From KENSHIN's guardian angel, SUNGMIN.

161
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,080
Thank you.

162
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,320
I'm happy.

163
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:12,789
I was moved.

164
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,659
Thank you.

165
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:18,058
- Happy birthday. - Thank you.

166
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:19,259
Yes!

167
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,669
- We can do it! - Yes, we can do it!

168
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,408
(Other teams are completing their practices too.)

169
00:09:29,409 --> 00:09:31,909
- Okay. - I think we have a nice formation.

170
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:33,879
The practice is over!

171
00:09:34,549 --> 00:09:37,379
(Trainees go back to the dormitory after the last practice.)

172
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,179
We're a team.

173
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:45,159
(How are trainees the night before the competition?)

174
00:09:47,289 --> 00:09:48,529
Who's going to take a shower first?

175
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,298
I feel tired, so I'll do it later.

176
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,659
By the way, why are you here?

177
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,799
It's not your room.

178
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:56,969
Why are you sitting here all of a sudden?

179
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,298
Why did you have to come here?

180
00:09:58,299 --> 00:09:59,739
I had so many thoughts in my head, so I came here.

181
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,939
It's the last time, isn't it?

182
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,070
That's right.

183
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,379
Time really flies.

184
00:10:04,909 --> 00:10:06,440
It's been two months.

185
00:10:06,509 --> 00:10:08,509
An hour felt like two days,

186
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,018
but it's almost over already.

187
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:14,349
If an hour equals to two days, we've been here for several days.

188
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,450
I feel like I stayed here for about ten years.

189
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,419
Honestly, it wasn't easy to get here.

190
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,159
- It wasn't easy. - Lots of things happened.

191
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,600
Right, already,

192
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,200
it's the final round after this.

193
00:10:27,429 --> 00:10:30,669
But preparing for the coming competition,

194
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:32,740
I was very excited.

195
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,339
- My song is coming into the world. - I know.

196
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,869
- I see. - Exactly.

197
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,239
- It's the first time in my life. - Right.

198
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,980
I will slay it for sure.

199
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:43,750
This is what I think.

200
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,518
Meanwhile...

201
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,350
- I see what you mean. - I feel...

202
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,789
pressured.

203
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,990
To perform for 2 minutes, 4 minutes at maximum,

204
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:56,758
we practice for a month, a week for shortest,

205
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:59,298
or even for a year in some cases.

206
00:10:59,299 --> 00:11:01,899
For the 2 to 3 minutes, all of us...

207
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,700
are putting our souls into it.

208
00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:06,138
In fact, we feel the happiest doing it,

209
00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:08,210
- so we're holding out here. - You're right.

210
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:11,308
I wondered how I should do it,

211
00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:12,639
and it only feels like yesterday.

212
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,450
We recorded songs...

213
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:15,980
and prepared for performances.

214
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,620
After coming here, I feel like...

215
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:21,418
I've made a lot of improvements besides singing and dancing.

216
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:23,788
- Right. - Like how to deal with people...

217
00:11:23,789 --> 00:11:26,019
and what to do in certain situations.

218
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,529
I don't know how long I would live,

219
00:11:28,929 --> 00:11:30,959
but in my life, I will remember...

220
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,359
- Right. - these three months.

221
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,960
- Right. I agree. - I mean it.

222
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:38,240
If you ask me why I came all the way to Korea and joined this show,

223
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,870
I wanted to put a perfect period...

224
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,639
for my dream in my life.

225
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:49,408
Whether I debut here or not,

226
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:51,450
I think I can make an ending for my dream.

227
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:55,518
Have you ever thought about what would you do in your life...

228
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,120
if the possibility for your debut is only ten percent?

229
00:11:57,389 --> 00:11:59,720
I don't know. I haven't thought about it, and I won't.

230
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:05,799
I just came here thinking it's an opportunity for me.

231
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,000
I never thought about giving up.

232
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:16,309
Even if I can't make a debut, I'll keep going for it.

233
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,710
In a way, in fact,

234
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:21,250
I joined this show after the debut,

235
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:24,319
but people recognize me more since I was in this show...

236
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,980
than they did for the four years after the debut.

237
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,350
"I will show them I have improved since the last time."

238
00:12:29,789 --> 00:12:31,058
"I'll work harder than the last time."

239
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:32,819
These were the thoughts I had so far.

240
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,490
It seems that in PROJECT 7,

241
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:37,659
more people recognize that.

242
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,629
MAJINGXIANG, you worked hard and you're desperate.

243
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,969
People are recognizing it,

244
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,340
as I think.

245
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,808
I think your strength...

246
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:50,340
is that you feel desperate.

247
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:54,580
"What if they don't see me? I should show a good performance."

248
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,149
You're doing a good job.

249
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,120
So don't have a negative thought.

250
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,679
- You're awesome. - Come on.

251
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:03,219
You really helped me a lot...

252
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,090
mentally as well.

253
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:09,129
In Zero Setting,

254
00:13:11,659 --> 00:13:14,370
Dae Hwi evaluated me.

255
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:18,070
And I met Dong Pyo here the other day.

256
00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:19,999
It felt...

257
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,138
You know what I mean?

258
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:23,139
(He had a lot on his mind after meeting old colleagues.)

259
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,539
Life is hard.

260
00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:29,950
I really felt that life was hard.

261
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:34,649
I realized that I have to succeed.

262
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:39,090
I realized again that I have to succeed.

263
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,288
I realized I'd hidden how desperate I was...

264
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:44,460
because...

265
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,369
I was afraid I'd fail again.

266
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,370
I see.

267
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:51,299
Goodness.

268
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,509
- Come on. - Seriously.

269
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:00,139
No. Don't cry.

270
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:06,719
I really want to succeed.

271
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,820
I want to debut through this.

272
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:14,389
I had such a thought today.

273
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:15,730
My gosh.

274
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,860
Come on.

275
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:21,129
I really want to advance to the final round together.

276
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:23,129
- Right. - I mean it.

277
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,169
We got very close this time, right?

278
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:31,808
(Younger members support the older member who was troubled.)

279
00:14:31,809 --> 00:14:32,980
I feel good.

280
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,450
Thank you, MINWOOK. Can I give you a hug?

281
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:36,750
Thank you, MINWOOK.

282
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:39,918
Now all we have to do is give a good performance.

283
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:40,989
I know.

284
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,450
- The most important stage is left. - Right.

285
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,850
Tasty and awesome!

286
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,558
- Let's go. - Thank you for your work.

287
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:46,759
Thank you for your work.

288
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,230
Let's take a shower and go to bed. We have a rehearsal tomorrow.

289
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:51,959
- Thank you. - Thank you.

290
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,329
- Thank you. - We can do it.

291
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,370
(The night before the competition, they share honest feelings.)

296
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,918
- WOO HAJOON, - ANDY,

297
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:13,450
- you can debut! - you can do it!

298
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,289
Go for it. You can do it!

299
00:15:15,419 --> 00:15:16,450
You will debut!

300
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,590
Make your debut!

301
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,919
The prince of Sejong, OH TAEHWAN, you can do it!

302
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:22,529
SEYUN, you can do it.

303
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,129
YEOJUN, I'll always cheer for you.

304
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,860
- LYNNLYNN, go for it! - LYNNLYNN, go for it!

305
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,369
Don't get nervous, and do a good job!

306
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,429
BINGHUA, don't be nervous. You can do it.

307

(Getting prettied up)

320
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,480
That made my skin so moist.

321
00:16:15,549 --> 00:16:16,779
Right? My skin looks pretty good.

322
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:20,980
So moist.

323
00:16:22,789 --> 00:16:24,960
Adding some brightness to my face.

324
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:29,230
(Oh, my)

325
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:30,590
Nice.

326
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,129
So pretty.

327
00:16:33,129 --> 00:16:34,799
You look healthy and bright.

Assemble and upgrade. PROJECT 7.

340
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,959
Hello. I'm the MC of PROJECT 7,

341
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,089
Lee Soo Hyuk.

342
00:17:40,099 --> 00:17:42,230
(Directors' Room)

343
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:46,200
This project that is connected to the trainees' survival...

344
00:17:46,569 --> 00:17:47,569
is...

For Original Matching,

348
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:57,849
the trainees will compete...

349
00:17:58,619 --> 00:17:59,848
with five new songs.

350
00:17:59,849 --> 00:18:01,079
(The trainees will compete with 5 new songs.)

351
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:08,288
Because I thought this performance could be my last,

352
00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:10,490
I came very determined.

353
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:14,328
Since we'll be performing our first song,

354
00:18:14,329 --> 00:18:16,369
I'm especially nervous and anxious.

355
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:18,740
I think I'm a bit nervous.

356
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,940
I'm so excited.

357

477
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,808

- Someone for the 1st verse... - And someone for the 2nd,

479

- and someone for the 3rd, right? - Right.

480

Trainee YOO YOUNGSEO, who got the main vocalist part,

481
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:22,429
had too big of a part,

482
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:23,930
so there were several members who couldn't really stand out.

483
00:25:24,259 --> 00:25:25,799
I thought they should adjust things a bit...

484
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,029
for the team.

485
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:29,869
Oh, "Time After Time."

486
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:33,669
They're all talented, but their performance this time...

487
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:35,470
didn't really stand out.

488
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,910
I was a bit disappointed.

489
00:25:39,309 --> 00:25:42,578
It's okay if all parts do the introduction,

490
00:25:42,579 --> 00:25:44,949
but if it's going to be one person,

491
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:48,119
I think it should be someone other than BINGHUA.

492
00:25:49,619 --> 00:25:52,219
They said everything that I was worried about.

493
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,919
This "Hey! Hey! Hey!" part...

494
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,659
didn't really suit my image.

495
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,328
That was an issue.

496
00:25:58,329 --> 00:26:00,429
And since I had never rapped before,

497
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:04,400
I had issues with vocalization.

498
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,538
I was worried that after watching...

499
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:08,669
"Time After Time," people would think,

500
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:11,269
"Oh, BINGHUA can't rap either."

501
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:14,910
(Team "Time After Time's" training room)

502
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,548
To be completely honest,

503
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:18,720
our rankings are on the lower end, right?

504
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:22,048
- Right. - I want people to see us more.

505
00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:24,549
Because we need to survive.

506
00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:27,088
The overall feedback...

507
00:26:27,089 --> 00:26:28,329
was that I didn't stand out.

508
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:31,490
I was kind of surprised too.

509
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,730
Because the main vocalist part was so big,

510
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:37,169
we talked the most about part distribution.

511
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:39,170
We were thinking about it too.

512
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:42,008
To be honest, I also did think...

513
00:26:42,009 --> 00:26:44,369
the main vocalist part was too big.

514
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:48,809
Performing that live...

515
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,279
was really difficult.

516
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,618
I thought it would be nice...

517
00:26:55,619 --> 00:26:57,650
to split it up a bit.

518
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,288
Since we have a lot of good singers,

519
00:27:01,289 --> 00:27:03,828
I'm thinking we could resolve this...

520
00:27:03,829 --> 00:27:05,929
by distributing the parts...

521
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:08,258
so that each person stands out more.

522
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:09,329
That sounds nice.

523
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:11,798
I think we'll sound much more stable then.

524
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:13,068
- You're right. - And also,

525
00:27:13,069 --> 00:27:14,970
- that part is so hard. - You're right.

526
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,768
We could divide it into three parts.

527
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:18,809
The breathing...

528
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:23,449
(The chorus part which is hard to continue after a break)

529
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:25,118
- Singing it like this... Right. - When you're dancing...

530
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:27,278
It might not look so pretty...

531
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,549
when it's a live performance.

532
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:34,220
(They split up the chorus for a stable live performance.)

533
00:27:35,289 --> 00:27:38,730
(The chorus part was split into a total of 9 parts.)

534
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:41,899
I am giving away my part, right?

535
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,028
So for the chorus,

536
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:47,139
I want 2 parts in the 3rd chorus.

537
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,108
- That's fine. - Right.

538
00:27:49,109 --> 00:27:51,108
- It is your part. - Right.

539
00:27:51,109 --> 00:27:53,479
Honestly, I also feel...

540
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,880
You can be greedy.

541
00:27:55,109 --> 00:27:57,308
We're just splitting it because it looks too tough for you.

542
00:27:57,309 --> 00:28:00,119
You just have to give away enough so it's not too tough.

543
00:28:00,549 --> 00:28:03,618
I'm not interested in the 1st part of the 2nd chorus.

544
00:28:03,619 --> 00:28:06,018
- TAEHWAN wanted this part. - I really want to do the 1st part.

545
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:07,319
How about you?

546
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:08,429
- Here. - Here?

547
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,229
- That's perfect. - That's perfect. I want the 3rd.

548
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,489
- Okay. Sounds good. - Sounds good.

549
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,929
- Okay. - Oh, my gosh.

550
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:13,930
Okay.

551
00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:17,298
(They finished distributing the 9 chorus parts.)

552
00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:19,969
Once we finished changing one part at a time,

553
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:22,440
almost everything had been changed.

554
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,910
I personally feel good about this.

555
00:28:26,309 --> 00:28:28,679
So the next part we need to decide on...

556
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,409
- is the rap part. - I think that's quite important.

557
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:33,779
Is there a part you want, BINGHUA?

558
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:37,288
I like singing much more than rapping.

559
00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:39,518
I just want one part that requires...

560
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:41,559
a pretty voice or face.

561
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:45,500
Do you want a part besides the rap part?

562
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,828
Yes, I think so.

563
00:28:47,829 --> 00:28:49,669
The directors also said so earlier.

564
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:51,199
- Right. - Do you remember that?

565
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,899
- Yes. - To be honest,

566
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,899
looking at the performance overall,

567
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,038
I think the rap part...

568
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,480
suits HANBIN the best.

569
00:29:02,509 --> 00:29:05,950
To be honest, I couldn't really accept that.

570
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,250
(Which part do you want?)

571
00:29:09,349 --> 00:29:10,420
(Lead Vocalist 1)

572
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,920
(I don't need the rest.)

573
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,588
Sun comes down

574
00:29:15,589 --> 00:29:18,390
The orange borderline

575
00:29:18,859 --> 00:29:22,700
(Trainee BINGHUA was eyeing trainee LEE HANBIN's part.)

576
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,999
When I look at your voice and image,

577
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,538
I think it'd fit you well.

578
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:29,269
The part only HANBIN can do.

579
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,739
Our voices are so weak.

580
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,180
Just in terms of who would suit it best.

581
00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:40,380
My ranking is the highest in my team,

582
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:44,048
but my ranking keeps dropping too.

583
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:46,289
So for my ranking,

584
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:50,028
I just want one part...

585
00:29:50,029 --> 00:29:52,630
that I can sing.

586
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:56,598
I just really wanted each of these talented members...

587
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:59,469
to show off what they were best at.

588
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:02,268
Because BINGHUA said he was more confident...

589
00:30:02,269 --> 00:30:05,940
about the singing parts than the rap part...

590
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:09,349
If not, how about we change it like this?

591
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,279
- Wait. That could work. - Like this?

592
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:13,518
But HANBIN...

593
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:17,019
- You wanted this part, right? - I... So...

594
00:30:17,619 --> 00:30:20,220
I did like the part of the Lead Vocalist One.

595
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:23,689
That was the part I was most confident about.

596
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:26,799
That part felt like the reason for me to be part of this song.

597
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,430
"If I don't get to do that part,"

598
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:31,970
"is there a reason for me to be in this team?"

599
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,099
I felt like that.

600
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:39,109
If we're only thinking of the performance quality,

601
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:41,039
that part does really suit you.

602
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:45,480
- Hello. - Hello.

603
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,980
Hello.

604
00:30:47,819 --> 00:30:49,389
(The two members came to the recording booth...)

605
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:50,950
(still undecided on who gets what part.)

606
00:30:51,089 --> 00:30:53,058
- The song is so nice. - Thank you.

607
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,289
- It's so nice. - Thank you so much.

608
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:58,130
(From ENHYPHEN and nTEAM to TXT and GFRIEND, )

609
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,028
(FRANTS has written many famous songs...)

610
00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:02,630
(for HYBE artists.)

611
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,298
This was the most sentimental song...

612
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:08,069
from the list.

613
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,569
I really fell for it.

614
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:13,079
This group is made up of members who have good taste in music, I see.

615
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,109
Let's get started.

616
00:31:16,509 --> 00:31:18,679
(Original part, SHIN JAEWON, I want to stay here)

617
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,619
I want to stay here

618
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,720
(He got an okay in one go.)

619
00:31:22,721 --> 00:31:23,819
That was nice.

620
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:25,489
(The new part he got, SHIN JAEWON, WU CHENYU's ad lib)

621
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:28,459
Even if we get lost I'll be with you

622
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,328
Even if we stop dreaming with you

623
00:31:30,329 --> 00:31:31,730
Good.

624
00:31:31,829 --> 00:31:33,130
I like it.

625
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:39,538
Even if nothing lasts forever

626
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:41,469
I pray that we are forever

627
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:43,170
Oh, my. What a nice voice.

628
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:44,839
There's not much I need to tell you.

629
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,509
Thank you.

630
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,750
When he sings it, it reminds me of Christmas.

631
00:31:49,849 --> 00:31:51,680
It's okay to feel awkward in this scene

632
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,579
The wave of emotions overwhelms me

633
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:56,450
I keep

634
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,990
Did you sing it?

635
00:31:58,589 --> 00:31:59,619
Did you sing it?

636
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,220
Yes.

637
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:02,730
I thought the guide track was on.

638
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:03,859
Thank you.

639
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,299
- I love it. - Thank you.

640
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:07,400
Sure. Your emotions...

641
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:11,068
Steps forming on the sand and our shadows

642
00:32:11,069 --> 00:32:12,969
We can't stop, stop this moment

643
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:15,969
Forever, time after time

644
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:18,809
- My goodness, YOUNGSEO. - Gosh, that was great.

645
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,839
- Thank you. - Okay.

646
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,049
Next, how should we...

647
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:25,980
The order...

648
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,819
- Let's go with BINGHUA next. - Sure.

649
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:32,758
Personally,

650
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:35,289
I really wanted to take the first verse.

651
00:32:35,859 --> 00:32:37,789
I prepared a lot for it too.

652
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:40,829
I thought that I could execute the part well.

653
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:43,029
So I was looking forward to it.

654
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:48,569
Everyone wants to debut on the show.

655
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:51,970
Having one more part...

656
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,740
would give me another chance.

657
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:56,480
So I felt a sense of urgency.

658
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:59,380
Having the right groove is important.

659
00:32:59,819 --> 00:33:02,018
Then the next important part is the emotion. And that's it.

660
00:33:02,019 --> 00:33:03,450
- Let's start recording. - Okay.

661
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:11,960
Sun comes down, it's borderline orange

662
00:33:13,829 --> 00:33:15,999
Your pronunciation...

663
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,098
- Yes. - for "orange" could be better.

664
00:33:17,099 --> 00:33:19,900
But I like the tone of your voice overall.

665
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,768
Could you sing it more energetically?

666
00:33:21,769 --> 00:33:22,808
- More energetically? Okay. - Yes.

667
00:33:22,809 --> 00:33:24,170
I will. Let me try that.

668
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:29,250
Sun comes down, it's borderline orange

669
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,910
Great.

670
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,950
- Let's move on. - Okay.

671
00:33:34,549 --> 00:33:37,149
I thought I could sing the first verse in a low pitch.

672
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:39,789
Since CHENYU sings the next part,

673
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,389
I thought the pitch difference between our voices...

674
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:44,089
could be an element of surprise.

675
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:50,329
Sun comes down, it's borderline orange

676
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,499
I like your voice.

677
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,599
- Thank you. - So that's your voice.

678
00:33:54,569 --> 00:33:56,809
I love your voice. It's perfect for this part.

679
00:33:57,609 --> 00:34:00,779
When you look at everyone's parts, I have the fewest.

680
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:06,119
I tried it out for the part. I think I sang it well.

681
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:08,788
I really want to have a part in the first verse,

682
00:34:08,789 --> 00:34:11,989
so people could hear my voice.

Don't forget to smile.

695
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,619

00:36:16,179 --> 00:36:17,809
- LEE HANBIN! - My gosh.

715
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:33,559
I got goosebumps just now.

716
00:36:45,139 --> 00:36:47,139
Was this BINGHUA's part?

717
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,489
(WOO HAJOON)

718
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,469
Gosh, WU CHENYU. You know?

719
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,519
Goodness, YOUNGSEO.

720
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,380
His voice is perfect for this.

721
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:29,719
I got goosebumps just now.

722
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:33,190
(YOUNGSEO)

723
00:37:41,429 --> 00:37:43,130
I love the lyrics of the song.

724
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:57,480
- Hey. - My gosh, HANBIN!

725
00:38:06,789 --> 00:38:09,889
- Gosh, TAEHWAN. - Did you hear his voice?

726
00:38:40,889 --> 00:38:44,190
There's something sentimental about their performance, right?

727
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:46,829
BINGHUA got emotional for a reason.

728
00:38:56,369 --> 00:38:57,469
What? A pair performance?

729
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,408
(Check out the full performance on the PROJECT 7's YouTube channel.)

730
00:39:37,409 --> 00:39:40,848
(The original track will be revealed at noon on December 14.)

(WOO HAJOON)

739
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,538
- That was so cool. - That was amazing!

740
00:40:02,539 --> 00:40:04,739
- My goodness. - I knew it!

741
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:06,039
Oh, my gosh.

742
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:08,979
Their performance was so touching.

743
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,650
- I feel overwhelmed with emotions. - Didn't you get goosebumps?

744
00:40:11,349 --> 00:40:14,118
How was it? I feel like I could cry at any minute.

745
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:15,380
- Seriously. - I'm trying to hold back.

746
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:18,519
It definitely sounds like this is their song.

747
00:40:19,159 --> 00:40:21,389
- They did well. - Yes, this is nice.

748
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:22,960
I love it.

749
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:26,659
- Well done. - Good work.

750
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,900
Great job, everyone.

751
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,230
To be honest, I was quite let down.

752
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,610
But this performance was a win-win situation for everyone.

753
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:38,768
I feel really bad for HANBIN.

754
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:41,909
I'm really grateful that he let me have the part for our team.

755
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:43,979
I prepared for it without any regret.

756
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,880
While filming this show,

757
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,289
this was the performance I prepared with the most passion.

758
00:40:50,219 --> 00:40:53,360
"Nothing is forever, but I pray that this is forever."

759
00:40:56,659 --> 00:40:59,259
Actually, this was just a temporary team.

760
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:02,130
We worked together a bit over two weeks.

761
00:41:02,929 --> 00:41:04,400
Just like our lyrics,

762
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,638
I want us to have a wish that...

763
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:09,170
our performance to be remembered forever.

764
00:41:09,809 --> 00:41:11,038
(Nothing is forever, )

765
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:12,269
(but our "Time After Time" will be forever.)

766
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:15,178
As for the next team,

767
00:41:15,179 --> 00:41:16,948
the genre of their song is the trendiest of all.

768
00:41:16,949 --> 00:41:20,078
The special traits of the song are the rhythm from New Jack Swing...

769
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:22,019
and the vocal line of rhythm and blues.

770
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:26,190
"KOOL-AID" has the old school and retro concept.

771
00:41:28,989 --> 00:41:30,888
- All right, one last time. - Okay.

772
00:41:30,889 --> 00:41:32,499
- Let's line up. - One last time.

773
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,699
- Okay. - One last time.

774
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:34,929
Get your energy up.

775
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,800
(How did Team "KOOL-AID" prepare for the performance?)

776
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:44,009
- You guys are working hard. - Let's start with Team "KOOL-AID."

777
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:45,239
- Okay. - Okay.

778
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:47,610
Let us say hello. Two, three.

779
00:41:47,809 --> 00:41:49,908
- Hello. We're Team "KOOL-AID." - Hello. Our name is...

780
00:41:49,909 --> 00:41:50,909
Team "KOOL-AID."

781
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:54,079
(Their teamwork is off from their introduction.)

782
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,889
For some reason, you guys...

783
00:41:56,949 --> 00:41:59,050
- Why do you guys look unhappy? - look down.

784
00:42:00,219 --> 00:42:01,360
Why do you look so down?

785
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:07,729
The atmosphere of the team felt so depressing.

786
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:10,969
Something was off about their mood. I wondered if they had a problem.

787
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,599
It's a fact that we're not that close.

788
00:42:12,869 --> 00:42:14,138
I didn't think we'd do well.

789
00:42:14,139 --> 00:42:15,340
We would fall short of their expectations.

790
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,110
So I was nervous.

791
00:42:17,909 --> 00:42:20,409
(The training room for Team "KOOL-AID")

792
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:22,848
- Nice. - That's a great song.

793
00:42:22,849 --> 00:42:24,480
But this is a difficult song.

794
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:27,280
The choreography is one thing. And it's a difficult song to sing.

795
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:29,590
Gosh, I can't seem to memorize this.

796
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:33,589
"I know he's good,"

797
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:35,218
"but he didn't do well with this song."

798
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,389
"It looks like he didn't want to do this."

799
00:42:36,659 --> 00:42:38,589
"In the video, they seemed unhappy."

800
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,400
"It made me uncomfortable just by watching the video."

801
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,698
Did we not practice enough?

802
00:42:43,699 --> 00:42:45,599
(They got negative feedback by other trainees.)

803
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:48,469
My gosh, there are so many movements. Seriously.

804
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:50,368
Let's memorize the choreography together.

805
00:42:50,369 --> 00:42:51,440
- We can split it. - Yes.

806
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,409
Let's calm down.

807
00:42:53,809 --> 00:42:55,678
It's so far. Start moving from this part.

808
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:56,750
- Okay. - Yes.

809
00:42:56,909 --> 00:42:58,480
Here. One.

810
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:02,079
We look really cool. The angle should be 45°.

811
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:05,920
(What kind of feedback will they receive?)

812
00:43:09,929 --> 00:43:11,860
- After that, I'll form the line. - Hold on.

813
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:13,759
- The line... - Could you step out a bit?

814
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:14,929
Play the music.

815
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,400
Let's go hard at it.

816
00:43:17,369 --> 00:43:20,500
(How will their interim evaluation go?)

817
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:47,800
Thank you.

818
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,428
- They're good. I like it. - That's pretty good...

819
00:43:51,429 --> 00:43:52,530
given they only had a day.

820
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,499
So you were assembled to sing this song...

821
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,170
when no one wanted it.

822
00:43:57,869 --> 00:43:59,379
But you guys aren't good at picking out the right songs.

823
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:00,840
You need to change your mind.

824
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:02,238
To exaggerate a bit,

825
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:05,309
this song suits the show the best.

826
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:08,879
Watching the choreography while hearing you sing...

827
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,149
completely won me over.

828
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:11,320
Thank...

829
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,558
"Thank..."

830
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:15,760
(Everyone is puzzled by the unexpected compliment.)

831
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:17,629
(A while ago)

832
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:19,598
- Their voices sound great together. - Yes.

833
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:20,658
They make a good team.

834
00:44:20,659 --> 00:44:21,960
Gosh, this song is so fun.

835
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:23,799
(It was especially well-received by the trainees too.)

836
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,239
Now that I'm hearing it in person, I like it.

837
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,509
This is such a trendy song. It's easy to listen to.

838
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:31,768
If I had to listen to a song 100 times,

839
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:34,738
this would be the best song to listen to 100 times.

840
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:36,609
- Seriously. Right. - "KOOL-AID" is the best.

841
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:38,078
You guys did a pretty good job at learning the choreography...

842
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:39,578
given you only had a day.

843
00:44:39,579 --> 00:44:40,649
- Right. - Thank you.

844
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:41,948
- Thank you. - The choreography is cute too.

845
00:44:41,949 --> 00:44:43,218
- The choreography... - If I could pick,

846
00:44:43,219 --> 00:44:45,288
I wanted to pick this song to make the choreography for.

847
00:44:45,289 --> 00:44:46,460
- Right. - My gosh.

848
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:48,219
- Of course. - Yes.

849
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:51,860
To be honest, I thought we'd get scolded.

850
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:54,799
They gave us a lot of hopeful feedback.

851
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,300
It boosted my confidence.

852
00:44:57,699 --> 00:45:00,239
It became a reason I liked the song even more.

853
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:01,869
I was happy that I was on this team.

854
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:05,110
We got a lot of positive feedback...

855
00:45:06,139 --> 00:45:09,109
- considering what we expected. - Right.

856
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:12,979
The evaluation was a good turning point for us...

857
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:14,750
- Yes. - in my opinion.

858
00:45:14,849 --> 00:45:16,420
I didn't feel confident...

859
00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:20,019
that I could execute this song well. I mean it.

860
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:23,189
So I couldn't focus because of the lack of confidence.

861
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:26,328
I was leading the practice, but I couldn't get our energy up.

862
00:45:26,329 --> 00:45:28,558
As the team's leader,

863
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:31,829
I behaved in a way I shouldn't have.

864
00:45:34,039 --> 00:45:36,339
I'm sorry about that, guys.

865
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:37,639
I'm really sorry.

866
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:40,110
I'll give it another try...

867
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:41,709
as if I was just chosen...

868
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:43,079
- to be the leader. - Okay.

869
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:45,280
- Great. - That's great.

870
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:47,379
You were always our leader.

871
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:49,619
Right. You don't need another chance.

872
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:52,749
We'll now be able to see you in your element...

873
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:53,989
during our practice.

874
00:45:54,619 --> 00:45:56,690
Everyone said it was okay.

875
00:45:57,159 --> 00:45:59,599
So I just had to get my act together.

876
00:45:59,829 --> 00:46:00,960
We just have to bond more.

877
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:04,170
We should be happy to look at each other's faces.

878
00:46:04,369 --> 00:46:06,570
I'm confident that we'll have fun while practicing for the stage.

879
00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:08,738
Shall we practice now?

880
00:46:08,739 --> 00:46:10,639
All right. Everyone, stand up.

881
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,038
One, two, three, and four.

882
00:46:14,039 --> 00:46:15,238
Okay. Great.

883
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:18,150
GUNWOO. You have to be really quick here.

884
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:19,379
The angle isn't tight like this.

885
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,949
(Thoroughly checking the details)

886
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:23,019
JOOHYUN will come out from here...

887
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:25,619
like this. Try to look cute while doing that.

888
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:31,030
I was waiting for SIHUN to be in his element.

889
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:34,300
That's what I really wanted from him.

890
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:38,530
(Team "KOOL-AID" starts to look lively.)

891
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:40,699
- Throw the fans in the air. - Throw the fans in the air.

892
00:46:40,969 --> 00:46:41,969
One, two, three.

893
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:43,039
(Cheering)

894
00:46:43,409 --> 00:46:44,469
(Cheering)

895
00:46:44,869 --> 00:46:47,639
- Gosh, how beautiful. - How beautiful.

896
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:51,279
Great!

897
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,949
- This is hard. Yes. - That's hard?

898
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:54,320
You can do it.

899
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,389
Nice.

900
00:46:58,190 --> 00:46:59,250
That's great.

901
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,190
I had a lot to learn from JEONGMIN.

902
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,529
He could maintain his energy level for a long time.

903
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:05,289
And he shared positive energy too.

904
00:47:05,559 --> 00:47:07,230
So people around him love him.

905
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:10,699
(Team "KOOL-AID" is recharged with good energy.)

906
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:13,569
(They start practicing again with good energy.)

907
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:14,739
HEEJU, you're slightly slow.

908
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:15,839
- I was? - Yes.

909
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,340
HEEJU. You're still bending over a lot.

910
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:18,710
Wait.

911
00:47:18,711 --> 00:47:21,138
- HEEJU. Just bend over less. - I know what it is.

912
00:47:21,139 --> 00:47:22,979
Pretend that you're not bending over.

913
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:24,209
- Okay. I got it. - This much.

914
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:27,118
- Do you know what he means? - I'm bending over too much. Right?

915
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:29,380
Your body... Just do that. Good luck.

916
00:47:29,849 --> 00:47:30,849
Let's try again.

917
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,760
The team spirit is really good.

918
00:47:35,159 --> 00:47:36,789
But JUNWOO is a bit...

919
00:47:37,489 --> 00:47:38,988
I'm not sure if he's upset.

920
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:41,360
He kept acting irritated.

921
00:47:42,969 --> 00:47:45,329
Slowly. Hey.

922
00:47:46,469 --> 00:47:48,269
Why do you keep coming forward?

923
00:47:50,739 --> 00:47:52,710
The rest were having fun.

924
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:55,308
Whenever I raised the spirits,

925
00:47:55,309 --> 00:47:56,880
he kept pulling it down.

926
00:47:56,949 --> 00:47:58,480
The members kept walking on eggshells.

927
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:01,079
I thought this could get bad.

928
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,920
Go straight. Backward.

929
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:06,419
This one...

930
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:08,420
- Just one. - I'll make it.

931
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:10,328
When you do this, it's not inside.

932
00:48:10,329 --> 00:48:11,630
It's outside.

933
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:12,960
Then that would be easier.

934
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,559
No.

935
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:16,300
You don't do it in the same position.

936
00:48:16,929 --> 00:48:18,029
Let's do that later.

937
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:20,038
You can just be in between the two.

938
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:21,199
GUNWOO can just...

939
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,070
I...

940
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:30,510
While SIHUN was leading the practice,

941
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:32,179
other members asked,

942
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:36,619
"How do I do this?" or "Could you do this?"

943
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:39,518
He accepted those as opinions.

944
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:40,820
But whenever I said something,

945
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:43,960
he took that as an unnecessary talk.

946
00:48:45,159 --> 00:48:46,400
Take your hands out of your pockets, JUNWOO.

947
00:48:46,699 --> 00:48:48,500
There's a hole.

948
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:51,800
The hole has nothing to do with the practice, right?

949
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:54,940
(Sighing)

950
00:48:55,139 --> 00:48:56,340
Don't sigh.

951
00:48:56,409 --> 00:48:57,769
Could you say it nicely?

952
00:48:57,969 --> 00:48:59,368
I asked you not to put your hands in your pocket.

953
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:00,510
(The air becomes heavier.)

954
00:49:01,739 --> 00:49:02,880
Let's go.

955
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:04,250
Let's go.

956
00:49:04,449 --> 00:49:05,449
Okay.

957
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:07,118
- You have to be in sync. - Okay.

958
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:08,948
He didn't answer well...

959
00:49:08,949 --> 00:49:10,150
and he kept standing on one foot.

960
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:12,690
He didn't follow the moves when I was showing them.

961
00:49:13,289 --> 00:49:14,760
That's rude.

962
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:17,530
- That was the end. - Right.

963
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:19,030
But why is your attitude like that?

964
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:20,500
My attitude...

965
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,359
I told you.

966
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:25,230
It's about how you speak.

967
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:26,698
You should know how to accept that.

968
00:49:26,699 --> 00:49:29,239
You didn't accept it...

969
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,840
even if we said it like that.

970
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:35,939
Can't you feel how it is there?

971
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:37,209
That's also why...

972
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:38,979
I came out after saying...

973
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:40,549
I'd come back...

974
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:42,380
after organizing my thoughts.

975
00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:45,218
I feel uncomfortable showing people...

976
00:49:45,219 --> 00:49:48,659
how I organize my thoughts there.

977
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:52,289
I don't know why he's angry.

978
00:49:52,929 --> 00:49:56,130
I was angry because he ruined the mood again.

979
00:49:57,199 --> 00:49:59,569
I thought if I left too,

980
00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:02,199
the team members would get more confused.

981
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:03,639
Let's get back to our spirit.

982
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:06,109
We don't need to be depressed.

983
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:07,239
We can do well.

984
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:10,279
One, two, three, and four.

985
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,380
Five, six, and seven, eight.

986
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:14,879
- Let's do this! - Let's do this.

987
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,788
Five, six, seven, eight.

988
00:50:16,789 --> 00:50:19,050
One, two, three, four.

989
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:26,630
(Heavily breathing)

990
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:57,530
I normally don't cry...

991
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:00,260
except when I talk to my mom.

992
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:03,599
I think I'm having a hard time.

993
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,500
I think I was very exhausted.

994
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,539
For the first time,

995
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,170
I wanted to give up.

996
00:51:11,969 --> 00:51:13,809
- I felt anxious too. - You feel anxious?

997
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:16,809
I'm also desperate.

998
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:20,380
- I'm not here for fun. - Right.

999
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:23,889
I'm trying to hide my emotions,

1000
00:51:24,949 --> 00:51:26,050
and that's difficult.

1001
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:27,920
You're doing well.

1002
00:51:31,389 --> 00:51:34,300
(SIHUN finds him crying.)

1003
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:37,730
Why are you crying, JEONGMIN?

1004
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:43,210
I...

1005
00:51:44,539 --> 00:51:45,809
tried my best...

1006
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:47,909
to make a good stage.

1007
00:51:48,610 --> 00:51:49,980
You've been...

1008
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,250
a great help to me.

1009
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:54,379
I should have done more.

1010
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:57,250
We wouldn't have been able to do this without you.

1011
00:51:58,219 --> 00:52:00,289
I shouldn't have done that in front of the members.

1012
00:52:00,889 --> 00:52:02,659
When I saw JEONGMIN cry,

1013
00:52:06,699 --> 00:52:08,130
I felt bad.

1014
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:11,500
He would have felt very pressured.

1015
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:13,699
I'm really sorry.

1016
00:52:14,769 --> 00:52:16,940
I think I ruined the mood.

1017
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:19,510
You did a great job.

1018
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:22,538
And we could lift up the mood...

1019
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:23,710
thanks to you.

1020
00:52:24,179 --> 00:52:25,780
So don't worry about the mood.

1021
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:29,480
I should have held it in. But at the time,

1022
00:52:29,989 --> 00:52:33,559
it felt like all the things I had been keeping in...

1023
00:52:33,889 --> 00:52:36,260
were leaking out.

1024
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:39,829
When I think about it now,

1025
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:43,199
I feel very sorry.

1026
00:52:43,769 --> 00:52:45,170
- JEONGMIN. - Yes?

1027
00:52:45,199 --> 00:52:46,940
You should know this.

1028
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,839
You're being a bigger help...

1029
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:51,139
to this team than you think.

1030
00:52:51,469 --> 00:52:53,039
You're doing well, JEONGMIN.

1031
00:52:53,539 --> 00:52:54,780
I feel thankful.

1032
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:56,210
- Okay? - Okay.

1033
00:52:56,849 --> 00:52:58,150
You look relieved after you cried.

1034
00:52:58,309 --> 00:52:59,949
I feel relieved.

1035
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:05,349
We had a slight mishap...

1036
00:53:05,449 --> 00:53:07,420
on our journey toward the same goal.

1037
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:11,360
But we'll do well in the end.

1038
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:14,129
So I'm not afraid.

1039
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:15,929
We can do well.

1040
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:19,329
We just need to boost the mood.

1041
00:53:19,969 --> 00:53:22,170
Please stop fighting, guys.

1042
00:53:23,969 --> 00:53:26,409
We just need to trust all we've been doing so far...

1043
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,739
But it's okay.

1044
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:32,078
And enjoy the stage.

1045
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:33,479
Drink it up like that

1046
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:36,019
I think that's all we can show you.

1047
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:37,190
It's like this.

1048
00:53:41,219 --> 00:53:43,590
(The stage looks nice.)

1049
00:53:44,489 --> 00:53:48,630
(How will the "KOOL-AID" stage be?)

1050
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,400
I'm looking forward to it.

1051
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,440
I really like this song.

1052
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:54,739
I'm really curious.

1053
00:53:55,469 --> 00:53:57,510
Do well, guys.

1054
00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:00,380
They'll do well. Don't worry.

1055
00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:01,880
- They're good. - Do well.

1056
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:03,079
Have faith in them.

1057
00:54:04,849 --> 00:54:06,079
The stage is wonderful.

1058
00:54:19,659 --> 00:54:20,730
Nice.

1059
00:54:22,099 --> 00:54:23,260
It's a real car.

1060
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:31,739
There's a vending machine too.

1061
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,010
It will burst if you shake it.

1062
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,619
- Nice. - The introduction is cool.

1063
00:54:46,219 --> 00:54:47,259
("KOOL-AID" by KIM SIHUN, KIM JEONGMIN, KIM JOONWOO, )

1064
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:48,320
(LEE GUNWOO, CHAE HEEJU, FONG ATILLA)

1065
00:54:49,090 --> 00:54:51,929
- Let's go. - That's a beverage.

1066
00:54:52,059 --> 00:54:54,429
It's being drunk from a cup.

1067
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:22,190
They're in sync.

1068
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:23,929
They're so good.

1069
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:31,500
Let's go!

1070
00:55:52,019 --> 00:55:53,250
Gosh, I love this part.

1071
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:11,239
- Rapper KIM JEONGMIN! - Gosh. I love the vibe.

1072
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:22,920
JEONGMIN is really good.

1073
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:24,389
JEONGMIN, you're so good.

1074
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:07,659
Gosh, how refreshing!

1075
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:43,460
This team's performance arrangement is fun.

1076
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,840
- Gosh, look at him. - He's good.

1077
00:58:05,789 --> 00:58:07,119
Hey, SIHUN.

(FONG ATILLA)

1086
00:58:58,170 --> 00:58:59,440
Well done!

1087
00:58:59,769 --> 00:59:01,038
HEEJU!

1088
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:02,209
(Check out the full performance on the PROJECT 7's YouTube channel.)

1089
00:59:02,210 --> 00:59:03,210
(The original track will be revealed at noon on December 14.)

1090
00:59:06,010 --> 00:59:07,320
That was refreshing.

1091
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:10,320
The song is really nice.

1092
00:59:10,449 --> 00:59:12,349
- I like the song. It's so nice. - The song is really nice.

1093
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:14,219
It's so refreshing.

1094
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:16,889
It felt like a fizzy drink.

1095
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:19,690
Two, three. Thank you.

1096
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:21,699
(GUNWOO, JEONGMIN, let's debut.)

1097
00:59:24,599 --> 00:59:26,900
We had many struggles. We went through a lot...

1098
00:59:27,239 --> 00:59:29,638
while practicing. But...

1099
00:59:29,639 --> 00:59:33,139
despite all that, I think the performance...

1100
00:59:33,309 --> 00:59:34,809
turned out great.

1101
00:59:35,539 --> 00:59:36,880

I wasn't going to go this far, but...

1108
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,300
Come on, big sisters.

1109
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,369
Come on, big sisters.

1112
01:00:04,510 --> 01:00:06,940

(I'm waiting for your vote.)

1115

You'll vote for our team, Team "KOOL-AID," right?

1116

Please vote for number two, KIM JEONGMIN.

1117
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:18,489
I love you!

1118
01:00:19,789 --> 01:00:20,789
What about your male fans?

1119
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:22,719
I love you guys too!

1120

(Grunting)

1122
01:00:27,829 --> 01:00:30,369
- Come here. Come here, JEONGMIN. - He's different.

1123
01:00:30,429 --> 01:00:32,199
- I'll have to talk to you later. - We'll have to scold him later.

1124
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,539
- Well done, JEONGMIN. - That isn't right.

1125
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,609
- Gosh, it's over. - It's over.

1126
01:00:37,610 --> 01:00:38,610
- Great work. - It was amazing.

1127
01:00:38,909 --> 01:00:40,679
- Great work. - Well done.

1128
01:00:41,809 --> 01:00:44,409
Honestly, preparing for the "KOOL-AID" performance...

1129
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:45,980
was so hard that I wanted to run away.

1130
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:49,150
But I worked hard so I could see...

1131
01:00:49,449 --> 01:00:50,489
the fans' reaction.

1132
01:00:51,019 --> 01:00:52,389
I was glad I worked hard to prepare for it.

1133
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:56,518
We really practiced a lot,

1134
01:00:56,519 --> 01:00:57,530
so I have no regrets.

1137
01:01:04,599 --> 01:01:07,098
- This song is crazy good. - We liked it.

1138
01:01:07,099 --> 01:01:08,300
They're really good.

1139
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,909

With an addictive chorus,

1141
01:01:14,039 --> 01:01:15,908
this song will leave a strong impression...

1142
01:01:15,909 --> 01:01:18,110

I like this song the most.

1147

- The choreography is really nice. - The choreography is nice too.

will blow up...

the stage in JTBC's Ilsan Studio.

1161
01:02:18,039 --> 01:02:20,840
I think we'll be featured in JTBC's breaking news.

1162

- Trainee KANG MINSEO. - Yes.

1163
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:27,679

(The practice is going smoothly.)

1173
01:02:47,239 --> 01:02:49,499
There are many all-rounders in our team.

1174
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,768
I thought our team composition...

1175
01:02:51,769 --> 01:02:54,480
was very reliable.

1176
01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:58,150
HYUNWOO and YONGHYUN who are the main vocalists.

1177
01:02:59,010 --> 01:03:00,919
YURA and KOTARO...

1178
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:03,119
are exceptionally good at dancing.

1179
01:03:03,449 --> 01:03:06,488
As for JIAHN, his strength...

1180
01:03:06,489 --> 01:03:08,159
is in his performance skills.

1181
01:03:08,489 --> 01:03:12,289
MINSEO is really good with facial expressions.

1182
01:03:13,090 --> 01:03:17,329
I think our team is a team of all-rounders.

1183
01:03:17,829 --> 01:03:18,829
Except for me.

1184
01:03:22,139 --> 01:03:27,209

1185

KOTARO and YURA are good dancers.

1186
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:36,880

1188
01:03:41,260 --> 01:03:43,119
The one who needs to work the most.

1189
01:03:44,829 --> 01:03:47,359

(Number 1 member who needs to work the most)

1191
01:03:51,030 --> 01:03:53,800
"I didn't see him at all. I don't even know where his parts are."

1192
01:03:54,570 --> 01:03:57,000
"He doesn't follow the choreography, and he looks flustered."

1193
01:03:58,269 --> 01:04:01,909
I know how much I lack,

1194
01:04:02,539 --> 01:04:04,610
so I expected it.

1195
01:04:05,010 --> 01:04:06,050
However...

1196
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:10,690
This one is quite harsh.

1197
01:04:12,219 --> 01:04:14,619
"Some may think that he's not into it."

1198
01:04:15,159 --> 01:04:17,158
"He's the only one who dances carelessly."

(Evaluation on AHN JUNWON)

1200
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,329
It made me very angry.

1201
01:04:25,199 --> 01:04:27,300
If it's a trainee who survived until now,

1202
01:04:28,469 --> 01:04:31,138
he should understand...

1203
01:04:31,139 --> 01:04:34,679
how I feel about being on PROJECT 7...

1204
01:04:34,909 --> 01:04:36,510
to a degree.

1205
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:39,780
How could he say such a reckless thing?

1206
01:04:40,449 --> 01:04:41,550
It made me very angry.

1207
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:43,780
I wanted to bust him.

1208
01:04:44,849 --> 01:04:45,949
I want to show...

1209
01:04:46,989 --> 01:04:48,659
my skills in earnest on the stage.

1210
01:04:49,389 --> 01:04:51,030
- It's payback time, JUNWON. - Yes.

1211
01:04:52,489 --> 01:04:55,360
I know what I lack better than anyone.

1212
01:04:56,230 --> 01:04:58,469
I worked harder than anyone else,

1213
01:04:59,869 --> 01:05:01,070
so it made me furious.

1214
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:07,280
I received such feedback because I didn't dance well.

1215
01:05:07,610 --> 01:05:10,340
It could be something...

1216
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:12,710
that stimulates me to improve myself.

1217
01:05:13,349 --> 01:05:15,179
I decided to be positive about it.

1218
01:05:15,650 --> 01:05:16,749
Positive.

1219
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:17,750
(Overcoming it with positivity)

1220
01:05:19,489 --> 01:05:21,488
Shall we start from the intro?

1221
01:05:21,489 --> 01:05:22,519
- Okay. - Okay.

(Director Bada's dance lesson)

1223
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,899
This move should look like this.

1224
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:30,058
When you do it,

1225
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:31,729
try to go inside the notebook.

1226
01:05:31,730 --> 01:05:33,369
When you come back out, you jerk back.

1227
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:36,968
Feel it like woo, shake it up, shake shake

1228
01:05:36,969 --> 01:05:39,709
Feel it like woo, shake it up, shake shake

Feel it like woo, shake it up

1230

Ha, ha, don't stop, shake it up

1231
01:05:50,050 --> 01:05:51,650
My body can't keep up with it.

1232
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:54,820
I memorized it in my head, but my body can't keep up with it.

1233
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:57,019
She proceeded so quickly...

1234
01:05:57,090 --> 01:05:59,260
that I didn't have time to breathe.

1235
01:05:59,329 --> 01:06:00,900
It was overwhelming to keep up with it.

1236
01:06:01,099 --> 01:06:04,599
He doesn't seem confident about himself.

1237
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:06,900
He doesn't seem sure of himself.

1238
01:06:08,599 --> 01:06:10,098
- JUNWON, move your shoulders more. - Okay.

1239
01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:11,308
Ready...

1240
01:06:11,309 --> 01:06:13,210
- Can you adjust your level? - Should I go down?

1241
01:06:13,269 --> 01:06:14,638
No, you should go down less.

1242
01:06:14,639 --> 01:06:15,780
- Less? - Yes.

1243
01:06:18,210 --> 01:06:20,049
(He missed the beat.)

1244
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:21,849
JUNWON, why aren't you dancing?

1245
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,579
JUNWON, why aren't you dancing?

1246
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:25,920
- Right away? Okay. - One more time.

1247
01:06:27,489 --> 01:06:28,960
I feel like I'm going to die.

1248
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:37,030
The choreography was difficult.

1249
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:39,199
There were so many combinations.

1250
01:06:41,869 --> 01:06:45,610
JUNWON, stay behind and practice the choreography.

1251
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:46,670
Okay.

1252
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:49,579
- Take it seriously, okay? - Okay.

1253
01:06:49,809 --> 01:06:52,550
- Take it seriously, okay? - Okay.

1254
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:55,479
As soon as you lose your focus,

1255
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:58,190
we can only see you during the performance.

1256
01:06:59,019 --> 01:07:01,219
You stand out in a bad way.

1257
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:02,320
Okay.

1258
01:07:02,590 --> 01:07:05,230
You're no longer covering someone's song. This is yours.

1259
01:07:05,530 --> 01:07:07,659
Soon, someone else will cover your song.

1260
01:07:08,630 --> 01:07:10,969
That's where you're at now,

1261
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:13,230
so you have to do better.

1262
01:07:13,630 --> 01:07:16,638
Particularly, JUNWON has to practice hard.

1263
01:07:16,639 --> 01:07:17,839
- All right? - Yes.

1264
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:20,440
I hope that you'll feel a sense of responsibility.

1265
01:07:21,409 --> 01:07:23,179
I was the only one standing out.

1266
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:25,210
I was the only one making mistakes.

1267
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:28,050
I felt scared...

1268
01:07:28,619 --> 01:07:30,920
that it would happen again on the stage.

1269
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,059
JUNWON.

1270
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:39,230
Are you having a hard time?

1271
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:42,300
With the dance?

1272
01:07:48,969 --> 01:07:49,969
What's wrong?

1273
01:07:51,809 --> 01:07:52,840
Seriously?

1274
01:07:54,210 --> 01:07:56,339
What's wrong? Did something happen?

1275
01:07:56,340 --> 01:07:59,280
No, we had our dance lesson today.

1276
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:04,079
I know that I can't keep up with the others.

1277
01:08:04,820 --> 01:08:06,949
The rest of the members dance so well.

1278
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:10,760
I'm worried about ruining our entire performance.

1279
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:14,900
Suddenly, I felt more scared...

1280
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:17,159
about my worry turning into reality.

1281
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:19,828
JUNWON.

1282
01:08:19,829 --> 01:08:21,100
(Come here, JUNWON.)

1283
01:08:21,939 --> 01:08:24,139
I was called when I was with JIAHN.

1284
01:08:24,140 --> 01:08:25,869
He showed me something.

1285
01:08:26,170 --> 01:08:28,079
It was a message from Bada.

1286
01:08:28,739 --> 01:08:30,979
"Stay strong. You came this far."

1287
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:35,920
It made me emotional.

1288
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:37,488
(Stay strong. You came this far.)

1289
01:08:37,489 --> 01:08:39,519
"Stay strong. You came this far."

1290
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,689
(Stay strong. You came this far.)

1291
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:44,829
It resonated in my heart.

1292
01:08:45,229 --> 01:08:47,228
I think "you came this far" means...

1293
01:08:47,229 --> 01:08:49,000
two things.

1294
01:08:49,699 --> 01:08:52,100
It means that you can do more.

1295
01:08:52,899 --> 01:08:55,539
It also means...

1296
01:08:55,699 --> 01:08:58,139
that it's impressive...

1297
01:08:58,140 --> 01:08:59,939
that you came this far.

1298
01:09:03,479 --> 01:09:04,979
Her message is very...

1299
01:09:05,979 --> 01:09:09,078
I felt awakened ever since then.

1300
01:09:09,079 --> 01:09:10,479
Let's not leave regrets.

1301
01:09:10,550 --> 01:09:12,789
Let's not cause damage to my teammates.

1302
01:09:14,590 --> 01:09:17,359
I want to dance well.

1303
01:09:19,130 --> 01:09:20,729
Worrying won't change anything.

1304
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:23,560
I should work hard to teach him.

1305
01:09:23,899 --> 01:09:25,299
This is the move.

1306
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:26,499
(An intensive dance lesson got started.)

1307
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:27,969
The hands are fixed.

1308
01:09:27,970 --> 01:09:29,199
Twice with the shoulders.

1309
01:09:29,569 --> 01:09:30,839
Go, go, go

1310
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:34,380
She told us to use the torso at the same time.

1311
01:09:34,479 --> 01:09:36,880
Instead of doing a body roll to the front...

1312
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:40,609
Like you're getting sucked into it diagonally.

1313
01:09:41,079 --> 01:09:43,779
I asked around because I wanted to dance well.

1314
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:47,960
I kept asking my teammates and other team members.

1315
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:49,319
That's it.

1316
01:09:49,890 --> 01:09:52,358
I'm not very worried about JUNWON.

1317
01:09:52,359 --> 01:09:55,228
I'm aware that he works hard.

1318
01:09:55,229 --> 01:09:57,198
Who do you see? Shout out, say my name

1319
01:09:57,199 --> 01:09:59,068
That sounds very good.

1320
01:09:59,069 --> 01:10:01,569
(A boost of confidence)

1321
01:10:01,670 --> 01:10:03,439
That's good. Please wait.

1322
01:10:04,539 --> 01:10:06,209

(He goes to the training room right after the recording.)

1326
01:10:17,550 --> 01:10:20,448
I'll practice the choreography as long as possible.

1327
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:23,460
Until all the parts I lack disappear.

1328
01:10:27,189 --> 01:10:30,659
Even if I can't be the first one to arrive in the training room,

1329
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,229
I'll be the last to leave.

1330
01:10:33,329 --> 01:10:34,670
We're leaving.

1331

- Goodbye. - Until I become the best dancer.

1332
01:10:38,369 --> 01:10:39,739
We won't stop.

1333
01:10:40,409 --> 01:10:41,579
Until that day.

1334
01:10:42,109 --> 01:10:43,479
Good work.

1335
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:47,879
(The next day arrives.)

1336
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:49,149

I'll wrap up now.

1348
01:11:33,130 --> 01:11:35,060
I prepared for it without regrets.

1349
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:37,929

01:17:32,619 --> 01:17:34,618
I believe that the next performance...

1423
01:17:34,619 --> 01:17:36,658
will be the sexiest...

1424
01:17:36,659 --> 01:17:39,359
on PROJECT 7.

1425
01:17:40,359 --> 01:17:42,430
I'm also looking forward to it.

1426
01:17:42,829 --> 01:17:44,529
It's the song that everyone wanted.

1427
01:17:45,729 --> 01:17:47,229
I'm the bad guy

1428
01:17:48,199 --> 01:17:51,340
"Trigger" with the sexy and bad man theme.

1429
01:17:53,039 --> 01:17:55,810
Trainees to sing "Trigger," please come onto the stage.

1430
01:18:03,180 --> 01:18:05,050
(MAJINGXIANG to the top)

1431
01:18:06,819 --> 01:18:08,488
We'd like to say hello.

1432
01:18:08,489 --> 01:18:09,489
Two, three.

1433
01:18:09,490 --> 01:18:11,059
- Bang. - Bang.

1434
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:13,729
Hello, you'll definitely fall in love with us.

1435
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:15,899
- We're Team You Love - We're Team You Love.

1436
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,829
- We're Team You Love - We're Team You Love.

1437
01:18:19,670 --> 01:18:22,100
- What? You're not in sync. - They're not in sync.

1438
01:18:22,539 --> 01:18:23,770
You're not in sync.

1439
01:18:24,039 --> 01:18:25,869
- Trainee MAJINGXIANG. - Yes?

1440
01:18:25,909 --> 01:18:29,380
I heard that you're more eager than ever for Original Matching.

1441
01:18:29,810 --> 01:18:33,148
On "Boys Planet," I got eliminated...

1442
01:18:33,149 --> 01:18:37,448
quite early because I lacked skills.

1443
01:18:37,449 --> 01:18:41,019
I haven't performed on stage for about a year,

1444
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:43,420
so I feel more eager than ever this time.

1445
01:18:44,619 --> 01:18:45,858
First,

1446
01:18:45,859 --> 01:18:49,260
we should make changes as we go.

1447
01:18:49,430 --> 01:18:53,099
Giving suitable parts to the best members...

1448
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:56,770
could result in the best performance.

1449
01:18:57,270 --> 01:18:58,568
Here's my thought.

1450
01:18:58,569 --> 01:19:01,840
All our members have different charms.

1451
01:19:01,909 --> 01:19:03,979
"I'm the bad guy" comes up five times.

1452
01:19:04,180 --> 01:19:06,949
If five different people say it each time,

1453
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:09,779
it could look amazing.

1454
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:12,550
There are many members without parts or who don't stand out.

1455
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:14,688
- Give each part... - Right.

1456
01:19:14,689 --> 01:19:15,719
To five different members?

1457
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:17,119
(MINWOOK and HYUNWOO were originally in charge of it all.)

1458
01:19:17,659 --> 01:19:20,389
I just need one. It doesn't matter to me.

1459
01:19:20,390 --> 01:19:23,059
It's only right to have enough parts...

1460
01:19:23,060 --> 01:19:24,199
to show ourselves.

1461
01:19:24,529 --> 01:19:27,270
A lot of trainees were sad not to have enough parts.

1462
01:19:27,829 --> 01:19:30,670
It broke my heart to read their comments.

1463
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:33,239
I understand how they feel more than anyone else,

1464
01:19:33,770 --> 01:19:36,608
so I'd really like us all to shine...

1465
01:19:36,609 --> 01:19:37,810
in this performance.

1466
01:19:38,850 --> 01:19:42,180
The other members have different charms from mine.

1467
01:19:42,819 --> 01:19:45,449
If this can be presented with good quality, I won't mind.

1468
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:48,919
There's a part I want to take charge...

1469
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:50,359
in this case.

1470
01:19:50,590 --> 01:19:52,228
- The 2nd verse. - Rapper 1 in the 2nd verse.

1471
01:19:52,229 --> 01:19:53,288
(He wants the 1st killer part during the 2nd chorus.)

1472
01:19:53,289 --> 01:19:55,129
The 1st "I'm so bad buy" part in the 1st chorus...

1473
01:19:55,130 --> 01:19:57,198
must be done by HYUNWOO,

1474
01:19:57,199 --> 01:19:58,670
I believe.

1475
01:19:59,029 --> 01:20:00,769
Then, the first verse...

1476
01:20:00,770 --> 01:20:02,669
Rapper 1 in the 1st verse.

1477
01:20:02,670 --> 01:20:04,698
MAJINGXIANG, are you okay with this?

1478
01:20:04,699 --> 01:20:06,139
I'm okay.

1479
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:07,339
- It suits you well. - Right.

1480
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:08,479
MAJINGXIANG goes well with this.

1481
01:20:09,939 --> 01:20:11,948
Could I do the "I'm so bad guy" part...

1482
01:20:11,949 --> 01:20:13,050
in the third chorus?

1483
01:20:13,079 --> 01:20:14,409
- Go on. - Sure.

1484
01:20:14,779 --> 01:20:16,819
It's right that I do it after MINWOOK.

1485
01:20:17,119 --> 01:20:18,220
- Right. - Yes.

1486
01:20:18,949 --> 01:20:19,989
This is over.

1487
01:20:21,020 --> 01:20:22,159
Are you okay with this division?

1488
01:20:22,220 --> 01:20:23,220
Yes.

1489
01:20:25,489 --> 01:20:27,630
Anyway, MAJINGXIANG...

1490
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:30,159
You'll have a better presence now.

1491
01:20:30,229 --> 01:20:32,569
- Yes, I think so. - Right.

1492
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,129
- Thanks. - Don't mention it.

1493
01:20:34,130 --> 01:20:36,270
And this during the first verse...

1494
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:40,409
(The 1st killer part in Chorus 1: KIM HYUNWOO)

1495
01:20:41,239 --> 01:20:44,380
(The 2nd killer part in Chorus 1: MAJINGXIANG)

1496
01:20:45,949 --> 01:20:49,550
(The 1st killer part in Chorus 2: JEON MINWOOK)

1497
01:20:52,149 --> 01:20:54,989
(The 2nd killer part in Chorus 2: JANG YEOJUN)

1498
01:20:58,159 --> 01:21:01,189
(The killer part in Chorus 3: PARK JUNSEO)

1499
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:05,199
We're balanced out a little more than before.

1500
01:21:05,470 --> 01:21:08,739
I believe this part division worked well for the team.

1501
01:21:09,170 --> 01:21:10,969
Making such adjustments...

1502
01:21:10,970 --> 01:21:12,640
improved the team a lot.

1503
01:21:13,340 --> 01:21:16,179
We just have to make progress and practice hard now.

1504
01:21:16,180 --> 01:21:18,579
I think our performance can be brilliant enough...

1505
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:20,510
for us to make good results.

1506
01:21:20,979 --> 01:21:23,879
Each member of our team is skilled.

1507
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:26,390
So of all, I know that we can get it ready real fast.

1508
01:21:26,890 --> 01:21:30,619
We'll try as hard as we can.

1509
01:21:30,890 --> 01:21:31,890
Wish us luck.

1510
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:34,788
- Six, seven, eight. - Seven, eight.

1511
01:21:34,789 --> 01:21:38,500
I'm the bad guy

1512
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:40,770
Two, three.

1513
01:21:41,399 --> 01:21:43,438
Three, four, five.

1514
01:21:43,439 --> 01:21:44,500
There you go.

1515
01:21:47,210 --> 01:21:49,140
All the members are good at dancing.

1516
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:52,648
The whole team is enthusiastic.

1517
01:21:52,649 --> 01:21:53,779
The team is overflowing with passion.

1518
01:21:54,210 --> 01:21:56,720
I believe we can do a good job.

1519
01:21:57,520 --> 01:21:59,919
It goes like, "I'm the bad guy."

1520
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:01,049
It's really cool when we do this.

1521
01:22:01,050 --> 01:22:03,288
If we do this, it will be crazy. We'll place first for sure.

1522
01:22:03,289 --> 01:22:04,719
We'll place first for sure.

1523
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:05,728
(Drawing a blueprint of placing first)

1524
01:22:05,729 --> 01:22:07,889
Seven, eight... Get shot

1525
01:22:07,890 --> 01:22:10,259
- Get shot - Right. Seven, eight.

1526
01:22:10,260 --> 01:22:12,600
- Get shot! Okay. - It's too fast.

1527
01:22:13,270 --> 01:22:16,369
This is right. Our hearts get shot

1528
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:17,939
I don't think so.

1529
01:22:18,270 --> 01:22:19,608
- It's right. - It is.

1530
01:22:19,609 --> 01:22:21,038
- Okay. - Because after this...

1531
01:22:21,039 --> 01:22:22,640
- I get it. - After this...

1532
01:22:22,979 --> 01:22:24,209
Let's do it again real hard.

1533
01:22:24,210 --> 01:22:26,049
- All together? - But if...

1534
01:22:26,050 --> 01:22:28,550
If the introduction is too powerful, it may be too much.

1535
01:22:30,279 --> 01:22:31,350
Okay, let's go.

1536
01:22:33,390 --> 01:22:36,759
- Hidden deep within your heart - Hidden deep within your heart

1537
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:37,859
Hold on.

1538
01:22:39,590 --> 01:22:41,859
Hey, we come forward, right?

1539
01:22:41,899 --> 01:22:43,329
We have to move back right away.

1540
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:46,630
But I'm not done with my part at that time.

1541
01:22:46,770 --> 01:22:47,999
- Then, you'll bump into him. - It's too...

1542
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,100
Will I?

1543
01:22:49,140 --> 01:22:50,198
But according to the draft,

1544
01:22:50,199 --> 01:22:52,140
you're supposed to do it in your place without going forward.

1545
01:22:52,909 --> 01:22:54,609
You step forward because you want to,

1546
01:22:55,310 --> 01:22:56,680
so it's only right you move back.

1547
01:22:58,180 --> 01:22:59,478
A little more to the side.

1548
01:22:59,479 --> 01:23:00,810
But LYNNLYNN...

1549
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:04,179
Don't want to try? Don't you deny? Smear without a warning

1550
01:23:04,180 --> 01:23:05,788
Hold on. Let me check the positions first.

1551
01:23:05,789 --> 01:23:07,648
Please wait until I get there.

1552
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:09,920
- I'm confused right now. - Okay.

1553
01:23:13,260 --> 01:23:14,828
There and back.

1554
01:23:14,829 --> 01:23:16,399
- There and... - Gosh.

1555
01:23:16,859 --> 01:23:18,630
- I'm sorry. - This is not good.

1556
01:23:21,630 --> 01:23:22,899
You're not in sync.

1557
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,210
We've agreed to drop at once all together.

1558
01:23:26,310 --> 01:23:27,368
(They're off beat.)

1559
01:23:27,369 --> 01:23:28,579
You're not in sync.

1560
01:23:28,609 --> 01:23:31,078
Guys, when I say you're not in sync,

1561
01:23:31,079 --> 01:23:33,648
check yourselves in the mirror instead of thinking what to do.

1562
01:23:33,649 --> 01:23:34,978
We look at ourselves in the mirror when we practice.

1563
01:23:34,979 --> 01:23:36,818
Why wouldn't you look in the mirror?

1564
01:23:36,819 --> 01:23:37,920
Look at each other.

1565
01:23:39,789 --> 01:23:41,988
None of us are in sync in this part.

1566
01:23:41,989 --> 01:23:43,788
- None of us. - MAJINGXIANG is slow.

1567
01:23:43,789 --> 01:23:46,629
- MAJINGXIANG... - We have good dancers in the team.

1568
01:23:46,630 --> 01:23:47,630
But...

1569
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:49,799
how we practice doesn't suit...

1570
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:51,659
some of the members.

1571
01:23:51,869 --> 01:23:54,430
It's not smooth sailing.

1572
01:23:54,930 --> 01:23:56,938
It feels like we're struggling...

1573
01:23:56,939 --> 01:23:58,300
to go against a waterway.

1574
01:23:59,369 --> 01:24:00,640
This is so hard.

1575
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:03,479
I'm sure and confident...

1576
01:24:03,810 --> 01:24:05,810
that we're...

1577
01:24:05,949 --> 01:24:07,279
trying the hardest of all five teams.

1578
01:24:07,750 --> 01:24:09,949
But we're the slowest of all.

1579
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:13,349
I think the biggest problem is that...

1580
01:24:13,350 --> 01:24:14,590
when we work on details,

1581
01:24:15,189 --> 01:24:17,289
changes are hardly made even with lots of comments.

1582
01:24:19,060 --> 01:24:22,099
All of us are skilled enough...

1583
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:24,399
to get things done.

1584
01:24:24,930 --> 01:24:27,270
But we're too burdened about the live performance.

1585
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:29,569
We have too many concerns...

1586
01:24:29,699 --> 01:24:31,469
even before we're done with the choreography and formation.

1587
01:24:31,470 --> 01:24:33,269
So when we dance, we're not in sync.

1588
01:24:33,270 --> 01:24:34,270
(Their concerns about their parts stop them from being in sync.)

1589
01:24:34,271 --> 01:24:37,209
It causes us to dance out of sync and all.

1590
01:24:37,210 --> 01:24:38,810
We just follow what we feel is right.

1591
01:24:40,079 --> 01:24:41,479
We have to go back to the beginning...

1592
01:24:42,649 --> 01:24:45,188
and work on the basics first.

1593
01:24:45,189 --> 01:24:46,550
Instead of worrying about live-singing...

1594
01:24:46,890 --> 01:24:48,689
and making gestures,

1595
01:24:49,420 --> 01:24:51,929
- we have to work on the beat, - First off, we...

1596
01:24:51,930 --> 01:24:54,430
the choreography, and then the details.

1597
01:24:54,689 --> 01:24:56,300
Right. That will do.

1598
01:24:58,930 --> 01:25:00,100
Let's do it.

1599
01:25:01,069 --> 01:25:02,069
We should do it.

1600
01:25:06,970 --> 01:25:08,210
Should we start from there?

1601
01:25:08,340 --> 01:25:10,579
Get shot

1602
01:25:18,149 --> 01:25:19,449
We aren't in sync.

1603
01:25:20,819 --> 01:25:24,159
(They try again.)

1604
01:25:29,159 --> 01:25:31,329
(YICHEN is a tempo slow.)

1605
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,538
- YICHEN, you're slow. - We're not in sync.

1606
01:25:39,539 --> 01:25:40,839
- I was slow. - Right.

1607
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:42,810
- You've been slow all along. - Really?

1608
01:25:49,149 --> 01:25:50,479
Get shot... YICHEN, you're slow.

1609
01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:52,689
You told me to do it slowly.

1610
01:25:53,050 --> 01:25:54,148
- He... - No,

1611
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:55,220
you're slow.

1612
01:25:56,020 --> 01:25:57,090
So,

1613
01:25:58,189 --> 01:26:00,259
you don't do it fast or slow...

1614
01:26:00,260 --> 01:26:01,689
as you're told.

1615
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:03,800
Listen to the song and dance to the beat.

1616
01:26:04,399 --> 01:26:06,500
- Okay. - Dance to the beat.

1617
01:26:06,729 --> 01:26:08,429
You don't just follow instructions.

1618
01:26:08,430 --> 01:26:09,698
Wait, it's...

1619
01:26:09,699 --> 01:26:11,699
We do this when the song goes, "Get shot," no?

1620
01:26:12,069 --> 01:26:13,169
This is serious.

1621
01:26:13,170 --> 01:26:15,068
I get that there were changes in the details,

1622
01:26:15,069 --> 01:26:16,978
but the "get shot" part is even...

1623
01:26:16,979 --> 01:26:19,250
with no changes whatsoever.

1624
01:26:20,149 --> 01:26:21,578
- Get shot - Get shot

1625
01:26:21,579 --> 01:26:23,879
(Team "Trigger" is faced with an unexpected problem.)

1626
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:25,390
Guys, in general...

1627
01:26:25,850 --> 01:26:27,550
- Please listen to me. - Okay.

1628
01:26:28,119 --> 01:26:30,318
We've been stuck in the same part for days.

1629
01:26:30,319 --> 01:26:31,818
We haven't been able to move on.

1630
01:26:31,819 --> 01:26:34,889
After today, we only have tomorrow...

1631
01:26:34,890 --> 01:26:36,260
to complete our performance.

1632
01:26:37,359 --> 01:26:39,970
We must be on our toes for real.

1633
01:26:43,899 --> 01:26:45,970
Otherwise, our performance will be a mess.

1634
01:26:47,239 --> 01:26:49,738
When we perform in real time,

1635
01:26:49,739 --> 01:26:51,109
we dance in chime with the lyrics, right?

1636
01:26:51,140 --> 01:26:52,778
But sometimes, the timing is a little different.

1637
01:26:52,779 --> 01:26:54,709
The song and the dance.

1638
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:56,279
The lyrics don't synchronize with the dance moves?

1639
01:26:58,050 --> 01:27:00,488
Don't try to dance along the live-singing.

1640
01:27:00,489 --> 01:27:02,960
Sing along the fixed choreography.

1641
01:27:04,819 --> 01:27:07,390
You tend to dance to your live-singing.

1642
01:27:10,159 --> 01:27:11,260
Yesterday...

1643
01:27:12,100 --> 01:27:14,629
We talked about this there yesterday.

1644
01:27:14,630 --> 01:27:16,969
We agreed to work on the choreography first...

1645
01:27:16,970 --> 01:27:18,839
without thinking about live-singing or individual parts.

1646
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:20,068
That's why we're working together to dance in sync.

1647
01:27:20,069 --> 01:27:22,710
So why are you already thinking about live-singing?

1648
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:27,779
Live...

1649
01:27:29,550 --> 01:27:32,390
We must be able to dance in sync for us to move on to live-singing.

1650
01:27:33,850 --> 01:27:36,359
What if we mess up with live-singing?

1651
01:27:37,289 --> 01:27:40,459
So when we discussed the practice,

1652
01:27:40,460 --> 01:27:43,029
we agreed to work on the choreography first.

1653
01:27:43,329 --> 01:27:44,629
Now, we're stuck...

1654
01:27:44,630 --> 01:27:46,499
because we can't dance in sync.

1655
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:48,500
Don't you remember what we talked about there?

1656
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,038
We decided to put live-singing and our individual parts aside...

1657
01:27:51,039 --> 01:27:53,539
and to work on dancing in sync.

1658
01:27:53,739 --> 01:27:56,078
But you keep dancing with your live-singing in mind.

1659
01:27:56,079 --> 01:27:59,180
That's why we're constantly out of sync.

1660
01:28:01,710 --> 01:28:02,720
Tell me if I'm wrong.

1661
01:28:03,050 --> 01:28:04,420
I'm sorry.

1662
01:28:04,819 --> 01:28:06,750
I'll focus on the choreography first.

1663
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,439
It was hard on me too.

1664
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:24,339
We weren't getting any better,

1665
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:25,438
but we only had a few days left to perform.

1666
01:28:25,439 --> 01:28:27,670
This concern was eating me up already.

1667
01:28:28,069 --> 01:28:29,680
We were struggling to dance in sync...

1668
01:28:29,779 --> 01:28:31,139
when he was concerned...

1669
01:28:31,140 --> 01:28:33,609
about live-singing his own part.

1670
01:28:33,979 --> 01:28:36,350
It didn't look so pleasing to me.

1671
01:28:37,380 --> 01:28:39,489
Honestly, I was very angry.

1672
01:28:40,119 --> 01:28:42,920
But if I got angry in that situation,

1673
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:45,289
I didn't think it'd get any better.

1674
01:28:45,430 --> 01:28:47,630
So I gave it some thought...

1675
01:28:47,859 --> 01:28:49,960
and concluded that I was partly at fault too.

1676
01:28:50,199 --> 01:28:52,899
I tried to understand and let it slide.

1677
01:28:54,029 --> 01:28:55,569
Come on.

1678
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:58,140
What? We can just practice.

1679
01:28:58,500 --> 01:28:59,970
Yes, we can.

1680
01:29:00,539 --> 01:29:02,310
So I want to say...

1681
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:05,549
about getting emotional...

1682
01:29:05,550 --> 01:29:07,710
with you earlier.

1683
01:29:07,850 --> 01:29:09,049
- About getting angry at me? - Yes.

1684
01:29:09,050 --> 01:29:10,679
- No, that was my fault. - I'm sorry.

1685
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:11,920
It was because I wasn't enough.

1686
01:29:13,250 --> 01:29:14,689
I think I'll get better if I practice.

1687
01:29:15,689 --> 01:29:16,719
I'm so sorry.

1688
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:18,488
- No, that's okay. - I...

1689
01:29:18,489 --> 01:29:19,529
No, it's fine.

1690
01:29:20,229 --> 01:29:22,529
If you criticize me, I'll take it.

1691
01:29:22,630 --> 01:29:24,099
Gosh, no...

1692
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:25,129
Keep criticizing me.

1693
01:29:25,130 --> 01:29:26,328
- No. - It's fine.

1694
01:29:26,329 --> 01:29:29,339
I'm sorry I got too emotional with you earlier.

1695
01:29:29,340 --> 01:29:31,369
But I understand.

1696
01:29:31,699 --> 01:29:32,969
You're not upset, are you?

1697
01:29:32,970 --> 01:29:34,169
No, never.

1698
01:29:34,170 --> 01:29:36,409
- I'm sorry. - That could happen.

1699
01:29:40,449 --> 01:29:42,619
YEOJUN apologized to me.

1700
01:29:43,020 --> 01:29:44,949
So I said it was okay.

1701
01:29:45,989 --> 01:29:48,420
I understand how he feels.

1702
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:49,720
He's...

1703
01:29:49,989 --> 01:29:51,689
a little afraid too.

1704
01:29:52,130 --> 01:29:54,429
When we opened up to each other,

1705
01:29:54,430 --> 01:29:55,559
it helped us practice better.

1706
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:57,328
Seven, eight.

1707
01:29:57,329 --> 01:29:58,868
In one moment, you

1708
01:29:58,869 --> 01:30:00,868
Right away to me

1709
01:30:00,869 --> 01:30:03,299
It finally feels like we're actually practicing.

1710
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:04,869
It was so nice just now.

1711
01:30:05,399 --> 01:30:07,539
YICHEN, you deserve a good-job sticker.

1712
01:30:08,310 --> 01:30:10,209
Like a destiny

1713
01:30:10,210 --> 01:30:12,149
Lead freely

1714
01:30:12,449 --> 01:30:13,849
Don't want to try?

1715
01:30:13,850 --> 01:30:15,149
Don't you deny?

1716
01:30:15,250 --> 01:30:16,279
Goodness.

1717
01:30:16,649 --> 01:30:17,719
- YICHEN. - Yes?

1718
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:18,788
- Do just like this. - Thank you.

1719
01:30:18,789 --> 01:30:19,818
Dance every move like this.

1720
01:30:19,819 --> 01:30:20,819
- Got it? - Okay.

1721
01:30:20,820 --> 01:30:22,090
- This is good. Okay. - Thank you.

1722
01:30:22,319 --> 01:30:23,319
Good.

1723
01:30:24,460 --> 01:30:25,529
I have a great feeling.

1724
01:30:25,590 --> 01:30:29,029
We just have to keep this up.

1725
01:30:29,729 --> 01:30:32,029
We became a little more honest with each other.

1726
01:30:32,329 --> 01:30:35,199
It brought us together with better teamwork.

1727
01:30:35,329 --> 01:30:37,569
- Nice. - YICHEN, you can sing so high.

1728
01:30:38,470 --> 01:30:39,608
- How neat. - You're the best.

1729
01:30:39,609 --> 01:30:41,269
- We... - YICHEN.

1730
01:30:41,270 --> 01:30:43,809
I praised you first before he did.

1731
01:30:43,810 --> 01:30:45,849
I'm getting certainty...

1732
01:30:45,850 --> 01:30:47,749
that we'll make such a cool performance.

1733
01:30:47,750 --> 01:30:50,219
(They opened up to each other and practiced hard for the stage.)

1734
01:30:50,220 --> 01:30:51,420
We gave all our might...

1735
01:30:51,850 --> 01:30:52,850
for this performance.

1736
01:30:54,050 --> 01:30:56,289
I want this performance...

1737
01:30:56,920 --> 01:30:59,960
to be one which the fans want to keep watching.

1738
01:31:00,460 --> 01:31:02,089
- Go for it. - Go!

1739
01:31:02,090 --> 01:31:03,260
How cool.

1740
01:31:03,359 --> 01:31:04,460
Bang, bang.

1741
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:06,170
I can't wait.

1742
01:31:06,329 --> 01:31:07,970
I'm so curious about their performance.

1743
01:31:08,770 --> 01:31:10,140
They might nail it.

1744
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:11,639
I'm the bad guy

1745
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:13,409
I'm the bad guy

1746
01:31:14,939 --> 01:31:16,079
- Let's watch it. - Let's go.

1747
01:31:21,279 --> 01:31:22,750
This is just like an awards ceremony.

1748
01:31:22,979 --> 01:31:26,590
- They're... They're already sexy. - This is crazy.

1749
01:31:27,289 --> 01:31:29,559
- Guys... - I hope they'll do well.

1750
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:30,920
Just do as you've practiced.

1751
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:33,329
Their performance has a cool introduction.

1752
01:31:34,630 --> 01:31:35,829
How they're standing is already cool.

1753
01:31:37,729 --> 01:31:39,500
- Go! - MAJINGXIANG!

1754
01:31:47,609 --> 01:31:48,739
Oh, my gosh.

1756
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:04,920
Nice.

1757
01:32:19,770 --> 01:32:22,479
- What's with this? - What on earth?

1758
01:32:22,710 --> 01:32:23,779
What the...

1759
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:24,880
This is over.

1760
01:32:25,380 --> 01:32:26,510
They're starting right away.

(PARK JUNSEO)

1780
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:29,260
(LYNNLYNN)

1781
01:36:29,789 --> 01:36:31,759
(Check out the full performance on the PROJECT 7's YouTube channel.)

1782
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:33,659
(The original track will be revealed at noon on December 14.)

1783
01:36:36,229 --> 01:36:37,359
- My goodness. - Gosh.

1784
01:36:39,369 --> 01:36:41,430
- My goodness. - My goodness.

1785
01:36:43,069 --> 01:36:44,170
It was insane.

1786
01:36:45,399 --> 01:36:47,369
- How will anyone beat that? - Seriously.

1787
01:36:47,640 --> 01:36:49,539
People won't remember our performance.

1788
01:36:49,939 --> 01:36:52,210
"Trigger" was so intense.

1789
01:36:52,949 --> 01:36:56,420
- All right. - They did well.

1790
01:36:56,779 --> 01:36:58,978
MAJINGXIANG was invisible during the interim evaluation.

1791
01:36:58,979 --> 01:37:01,250
- Seriously. - With more parts, he stood out.

1792
01:37:01,689 --> 01:37:03,519
Trainees,

1793
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:06,689
please say a few words to the World Assemblers.

1794
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:12,600
We have the team with sexy charms, cool charms,

1795
01:37:13,770 --> 01:37:15,170
and good physiques.

1796
01:37:15,270 --> 01:37:18,869
You have no reason not to vote for us, right?

1797
01:37:18,899 --> 01:37:21,270
I love you, big sisters. Please vote for us.

1798
01:37:21,710 --> 01:37:23,210
(SUNGMIN)

1799
01:37:23,979 --> 01:37:25,038
I love you.

1800
01:37:25,039 --> 01:37:26,779
(MAJINGXIANG to the top)

1801
01:37:27,409 --> 01:37:28,409
I love you.

1802
01:37:30,180 --> 01:37:31,819
- What? - Come on.

1803
01:37:32,350 --> 01:37:33,689
What? Did he look up what to say?

1804
01:37:33,819 --> 01:37:35,119
How would he look that up?

1805
01:37:36,319 --> 01:37:40,689
If our stage delivered our sincerity to you, the World Assemblers,

1806
01:37:41,060 --> 01:37:43,130
please vote for us.

1807
01:37:44,460 --> 01:37:45,559
Thank you.

1808
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:48,270
HYUNWOO!

1809
01:37:48,329 --> 01:37:49,939
- All right. - Well done.

1810
01:37:50,140 --> 01:37:51,239
Thank you.

1811
01:37:51,739 --> 01:37:53,238
Let's turn.

1812
01:37:53,239 --> 01:37:54,369
Thank you.

1813
01:37:54,810 --> 01:37:57,908
There were many complications,

1814
01:37:57,909 --> 01:38:00,979
but we gave a performance without any regrets in the end.

1815
01:38:01,350 --> 01:38:03,350
We had good teamwork too.

1816
01:38:03,449 --> 01:38:07,189
I'm very happy that put on a good performance.

1817
01:38:08,289 --> 01:38:09,358
You have no regrets, do you?

1818
01:38:09,359 --> 01:38:10,359
- Of course not. - That's right.

1819
01:38:10,360 --> 01:38:11,988
- We did well. - Let's meet at the finals.

1820
01:38:11,989 --> 01:38:13,288
- Of course. - Of course.

1821
01:38:13,289 --> 01:38:14,959
- Let's advance together. - Seven sexy men.

1822
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:16,000
Good.

1823
01:38:18,729 --> 01:38:20,568
I'll introduce the next team.

1824
01:38:20,569 --> 01:38:21,669
I watched them when they were practicing.

1825
01:38:21,670 --> 01:38:25,399
I think they're a group of very lovely trainees.

1826
01:38:26,109 --> 01:38:29,140
It's a song that contains the emotions of a boy in love.

1827
01:38:29,510 --> 01:38:31,510
A song with the fresh and cool concept.

1828
01:38:32,039 --> 01:38:33,179
"Merry-Go-Round."

1829
01:38:33,180 --> 01:38:34,909
(SEUNGHO and SUNGMIN)

1830
01:38:36,279 --> 01:38:37,648
As for "Merry-Go-Round,"

1831
01:38:37,649 --> 01:38:42,319
Cho Won Sang of LUCY produced it as he thought about the members.

1832
01:38:42,619 --> 01:38:45,759
It's a synth-pop and dance song with the band sound...

1833
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:47,930
that is characterized by the upbeat guitar riff.

1834
01:38:48,189 --> 01:38:51,529
It's a song that is full of bright and refreshing energy.

1835
01:38:52,159 --> 01:38:54,270
Also, Director RyuD...

1836
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:58,270
choreographed the dance with the theme of an amusement park.

1837
01:38:58,640 --> 01:39:00,069
- What? - Yes.

1838
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:03,739
BEBE was impressed with the choreography.

1839
01:39:03,979 --> 01:39:06,310
- It's so cool. Seriously. - Thank you.

1840
01:39:07,550 --> 01:39:11,318
Trainees who prepared "Merry-Go-Round," please come on up.

1841
01:39:11,319 --> 01:39:13,449
(Team "Merry-Go-Round" enters.)

1842
01:39:17,819 --> 01:39:20,759
- JIWOON! - KYOUNGBAE!

1843
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:22,828
(KYOUNGBAE)

1844
01:39:22,829 --> 01:39:25,130
(SONG SEUNGHO)

1845
01:39:25,630 --> 01:39:26,669
(Pink next to pink)

1846
01:39:26,670 --> 01:39:28,369
They're so refreshing.

1847
01:39:28,899 --> 01:39:30,000
They're babies.

1848
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:33,038
- Look at his shoulders. - Seriously.

1849
01:39:33,039 --> 01:39:34,069
He's handsome.

1850
01:39:34,210 --> 01:39:35,939
Their outfits are so pink.

1851
01:39:36,039 --> 01:39:37,840
They put me in a good mood.

1852
01:39:38,479 --> 01:39:41,309
I introduced them as the lovely team.

1853
01:39:41,310 --> 01:39:42,550
Judging by their outfits,

1854
01:39:43,750 --> 01:39:45,350
they seem to be determined.

1855
01:39:46,250 --> 01:39:48,390
Their average age is 17.

1856
01:39:48,819 --> 01:39:52,289
As their average age is 17, they're the youngest team.

1857
01:39:52,619 --> 01:39:55,488
- Childhood innocence comes back. - It comes back.

1858
01:39:55,489 --> 01:39:56,528
(SONG SEUNGHO)

1859
01:39:56,529 --> 01:39:57,729
Two, three.

1860
01:39:57,930 --> 01:39:58,930
Hello,

1861
01:39:58,931 --> 01:40:01,898
we'll bring back your childhood innocence.

1862
01:40:01,899 --> 01:40:03,340
We're Boomerang.

1863
01:40:03,869 --> 01:40:05,069
(Retrieving the boomerang)

1864
01:40:05,170 --> 01:40:06,209
(KENSHIN)

1865
01:40:06,210 --> 01:40:08,368
All right. SAKURADA KENSHIN.

1866
01:40:08,369 --> 01:40:09,439
Yes?

1867
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:12,909
I heard that you were very happy to be assigned to this song.

1868
01:40:13,449 --> 01:40:14,479
That's right.

1869
01:40:14,710 --> 01:40:17,880
"Merry-Go-Round" is totally me.

1870
01:40:18,279 --> 01:40:19,819
It really suits me.

1871
01:40:20,489 --> 01:40:23,319
Is there a new Korean word you learned?

1872
01:40:24,520 --> 01:40:26,590
The phrase I recently learned is,

1873
01:40:27,130 --> 01:40:30,329
"I'll love you forever."

1874
01:40:31,029 --> 01:40:32,229
(KIM SUNGMIN)

1875
01:40:32,729 --> 01:40:34,299
"I'll love you forever."

1876
01:40:34,300 --> 01:40:36,239
(Was the practice full of love as well?)

1877
01:40:36,640 --> 01:40:39,670
Let's not get our feelings hurt. Let's cheer up.

1878
01:40:40,909 --> 01:40:44,180
Other trainees wanted us to improve.

1879
01:40:44,640 --> 01:40:46,778
They didn't write those things to hurt our feelings.

1880
01:40:46,779 --> 01:40:48,778
(What were the pieces of paper...)

1881
01:40:48,779 --> 01:40:52,050
(that made the atmosphere frigid in the training room?)

1882
01:40:53,020 --> 01:40:55,590
(Upon watching the practice video of Team "Merry-Go-Round,")

1883
01:40:56,050 --> 01:40:59,189
(other trainees filled out the self-evaluation sheet.)

1884
01:40:59,460 --> 01:41:01,289
What feedback did we get from other trainees?

1885
01:41:02,460 --> 01:41:05,059
"He stands out the most. He's cute and cheerful."

1886
01:41:05,060 --> 01:41:07,729
"He has the best energy in the team."

1887
01:41:08,100 --> 01:41:09,699
- "He's doing a good job..." - That's right.

1888
01:41:10,539 --> 01:41:11,839
"with his position."

1889
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:14,039
"His skills are the best and the most stable."

1890
01:41:14,970 --> 01:41:17,179
- Most of them are compliments. - "He's cute."

1891
01:41:17,180 --> 01:41:20,510
"He's one of the members who suits the song the most."

1892
01:41:20,550 --> 01:41:22,108
"But since he doesn't have many parts,"

1893
01:41:22,109 --> 01:41:25,349
"he doesn't catch the eyes."

1894
01:41:25,350 --> 01:41:27,350
"I wish he were more visible."

1895
01:41:28,020 --> 01:41:30,590
- Okay. - Let's begin with SUNGMIN.

1896
01:41:31,159 --> 01:41:33,959
- Let's go. - I'm scared, everyone.

1897
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:35,658
- Shall we read KYOUNGBAE's first? - Yes.

1898
01:41:35,659 --> 01:41:37,059
- Let's do that. - Let's do that.

1899
01:41:37,060 --> 01:41:38,559
I think the two of us are the main ones.

1900
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:40,500
My heart is beating so fast.

1901
01:41:41,399 --> 01:41:42,899
"His vibe is different from the others."

1902
01:41:42,970 --> 01:41:44,899
"He's cute, but he doesn't look cute."

1903
01:41:45,739 --> 01:41:47,340
"He didn't catch the eye."

1904
01:41:48,340 --> 01:41:50,340
- Who wrote that? - He did well, though.

1905
01:41:50,979 --> 01:41:54,049
They wrote, "He was invisible. He didn't suit the song."

1906
01:41:54,050 --> 01:41:58,050
I'm the youngest trainee of PROJECT 7.

1907
01:41:58,119 --> 01:42:00,319
I can't help the fact that I look older.

1908
01:42:00,819 --> 01:42:03,089
I thought I suited the song well.

1909
01:42:03,090 --> 01:42:04,289
(The feedback about him being unsuitable weighs heavily.)

1910
01:42:05,220 --> 01:42:07,989
(Now is the time.)

1911
01:42:08,829 --> 01:42:10,300
I'll read it first.

1912
01:42:11,199 --> 01:42:13,399
"He has many parts, but all of them are unstable."

1913
01:42:13,670 --> 01:42:15,528
Like this

1914
01:42:15,529 --> 01:42:16,839
"He improved a lot."

1915
01:42:16,840 --> 01:42:18,770
"But he really should be better, to be honest."

1916
01:42:19,399 --> 01:42:20,868
"He's really bad at this."

1917
01:42:20,869 --> 01:42:23,539
"Zero points for the expressions, dancing, and singing."

1918
01:42:23,579 --> 01:42:25,879
Gosh, that's so hurtful.

1919
01:42:25,880 --> 01:42:27,009
(The evaluation about his skills is cutting.)

1920
01:42:27,010 --> 01:42:28,250
That's all.

1921
01:42:29,180 --> 01:42:31,449
I was so angry and upset...

1922
01:42:31,720 --> 01:42:33,619
with myself.

1923
01:42:34,149 --> 01:42:36,020
"He seems to be struggling a lot with singing."

1924
01:42:36,189 --> 01:42:39,260
"It looks like he gave up on dancing and expressions because of it."

1925
01:42:40,489 --> 01:42:43,600
"Despite being the main vocalist, his singing skills are terrible."

1926
01:42:44,659 --> 01:42:46,269
"He needs more practice."

1927
01:42:46,270 --> 01:42:48,100
(There are many worries about the main vocalist.)

1928
01:42:48,470 --> 01:42:51,099
"Would I have been criticized this much for another position?"

1929
01:42:51,100 --> 01:42:52,800
I had that thought.

1930
01:42:52,909 --> 01:42:55,938
But I can't back out of it now.

1931
01:42:55,939 --> 01:42:58,310
I had so many worries.

1932
01:42:59,140 --> 01:43:01,379
"It's too bad that a few members didn't smile."

1933
01:43:01,380 --> 01:43:03,350
"They should dance more energetically."

1934
01:43:03,449 --> 01:43:04,520
"The vocal skills are very lacking."

1935
01:43:05,180 --> 01:43:07,250
"They seem to be struggling with the many high-pitched parts."

1936
01:43:07,949 --> 01:43:09,319
Firstly,

1937
01:43:10,020 --> 01:43:14,029
we shouldn't get depressed about it.

1938
01:43:14,829 --> 01:43:16,729
We just need to work hard.

1939
01:43:17,229 --> 01:43:19,398
Three members received compliments,

1940
01:43:19,399 --> 01:43:22,899
but the other four members received criticisms.

1941
01:43:23,239 --> 01:43:26,539
The atmosphere was frigid, so I became worried.

1942
01:43:27,409 --> 01:43:29,609
The atmosphere is very bad.

1943
01:43:30,539 --> 01:43:32,979
I don't know what to do.

1944
01:43:34,109 --> 01:43:36,050
We need to lift up the members' spirits.

1945
01:43:36,920 --> 01:43:38,180
Okay. Now...

1946
01:43:38,579 --> 01:43:40,488
- Let's begin right away. - Let's begin right away.

1947
01:43:40,489 --> 01:43:42,050
Here comes the first formation.

1948
01:43:42,250 --> 01:43:43,689
Please pay attention.

1949
01:43:44,460 --> 01:43:45,818
Shall we lift up our spirits?

1950
01:43:45,819 --> 01:43:47,029
- Okay. - Okay.

1951
01:43:48,189 --> 01:43:49,328
Let's lift up our spirits.

1952
01:43:49,329 --> 01:43:50,960
Let's fight on.

1953
01:43:51,229 --> 01:43:52,759
I said, "Let's fight on,"

1954
01:43:52,760 --> 01:43:55,899
but no one gave a reaction. They kept their faces blank.

1955
01:43:57,100 --> 01:43:59,439
Please put more strength into the movements.

1956
01:44:01,609 --> 01:44:04,479
Just now, no one put more strength into the movements.

1957
01:44:05,510 --> 01:44:07,180
When I talk to you,

1958
01:44:07,579 --> 01:44:09,619
please give some kind of a response.

1959
01:44:09,680 --> 01:44:12,750
We weren't in the mood for the fighting spirit.

1960
01:44:13,189 --> 01:44:15,788
It was wrong to ruin the atmosphere,

1961
01:44:15,789 --> 01:44:18,590
but I felt like I'd be ruined due to the vocals.

1962
01:44:18,819 --> 01:44:21,689
So I couldn't focus on what others were saying.

1963
01:44:22,060 --> 01:44:23,460
I'm very worried.

1964
01:44:25,430 --> 01:44:28,429
(Worried, JIWOON comes out to the hallway by himself.)

1965
01:44:28,430 --> 01:44:30,670
I thought, "He must be having a mental breakdown."

1966
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:32,938
I worried about JIWOON a lot.

1967
01:44:32,939 --> 01:44:34,439
(Trainee SAKURADA KENSHIN)

1968
01:44:36,579 --> 01:44:39,239
(He moves closer to JIWOON.)

1969
01:44:39,340 --> 01:44:41,510
Why are you so handsome?

1970
01:44:42,550 --> 01:44:45,349
- Stop it. - Why are you so pretty?

1971
01:44:45,350 --> 01:44:48,350
You're pretty too, KENSHIN.

1972
01:44:48,619 --> 01:44:53,029
I learned a new word earlier.

1973
01:44:53,260 --> 01:44:55,859
- "Forever." - "Forever."

1974
01:44:57,729 --> 01:44:59,500
World Assemblers,

1975
01:44:59,670 --> 01:45:03,039
please love forever. What?

1976
01:45:03,340 --> 01:45:06,039
- Please love us forever. - Please love us forever.

1977
01:45:06,069 --> 01:45:08,038
- Forever, - Forever.

1978
01:45:08,039 --> 01:45:11,278
- we need to practice. - Forever.

1979
01:45:11,279 --> 01:45:12,578
That's right.

1980
01:45:12,579 --> 01:45:14,380
- Forever. - Forever.

1981
01:45:14,710 --> 01:45:16,778
It was my first time teaming up with KENSHIN.

1982
01:45:16,779 --> 01:45:19,278
He has a smile that makes other people smile.

1983
01:45:19,279 --> 01:45:22,319
He made me think, "I need to cheer up."

1984
01:45:23,619 --> 01:45:25,859
(The two of them begin practicing together.)

1985
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:29,729
(Trainee SONG SEUNGHO joins them.)

1986
01:45:30,359 --> 01:45:32,999
(Another trainee was by himself.)

1987
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:34,970
I was very frustrated.

1988
01:45:35,100 --> 01:45:38,600
My body and head didn't work the way I wanted.

1989
01:45:38,670 --> 01:45:43,039
Compared to his Pipo Pipo days, SUNGMIN has improved so much.

1990
01:45:43,380 --> 01:45:47,609
We were together for Pipo Pipo and "Jealousy."

1991
01:45:47,909 --> 01:45:52,079
He can do it with enough practice.

1992
01:45:52,279 --> 01:45:53,849
Everything

1993
01:45:53,850 --> 01:45:56,488
- Merry-go-around - Merry-go-around

1994
01:45:56,489 --> 01:45:58,159
Go back.

1995
01:45:58,359 --> 01:45:59,728
Go back.

1996
01:45:59,729 --> 01:46:02,430
(Since they spent time together, they believe in each other.)

1997
01:46:02,489 --> 01:46:03,759
Wait.

1998
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:05,060
- Ta-da. - Ta-da.

1999
01:46:05,229 --> 01:46:07,828
Then from here...

2000
01:46:07,829 --> 01:46:09,500
(The two of them practice together.)

2001
01:46:10,270 --> 01:46:11,469
- Around - Around

2002
01:46:11,470 --> 01:46:12,938
- Boom. - Boom.

2003
01:46:12,939 --> 01:46:15,538
This is when you go back, SUNGMIN.

2004
01:46:15,539 --> 01:46:17,180
Okay. My bad.

2005
01:46:17,210 --> 01:46:18,739
All right.

2006
01:46:19,949 --> 01:46:23,010
Thankfully, we steeled our hearts.

2007
01:46:23,180 --> 01:46:25,778
The atmosphere of the team improved a lot.

2008
01:46:25,779 --> 01:46:27,118
- Come. - Now...

2009
01:46:27,119 --> 01:46:29,148
- Disperse. - Disperse like this.

2010
01:46:29,149 --> 01:46:30,859
Like this.

2011
01:46:31,289 --> 01:46:33,020
- It's pretty. - It's pretty.

2012
01:46:33,390 --> 01:46:34,589
It's pretty.

2013
01:46:34,590 --> 01:46:35,929
I think it's pretty.

2014
01:46:35,930 --> 01:46:37,529
(That way, KENSHIN consoled the members.)

2015
01:46:39,770 --> 01:46:41,068
(He stays behind and reads the evaluation sheet.)

2016
01:46:41,069 --> 01:46:42,869
"KENSHIN was invisible."

2017
01:46:43,500 --> 01:46:46,000
"Despite being in second place, he didn't stand out much."

2018
01:46:46,439 --> 01:46:47,710
"He didn't catch the eye."

2019
01:46:48,069 --> 01:46:50,979
"I don't know which parts were his."

2020
01:46:51,180 --> 01:46:54,350
(He hasn't solved his problem yet.)

2021
01:46:54,609 --> 01:46:58,250
Other trainees said,

2022
01:46:59,119 --> 01:47:00,689
"KENSHIN is invisible."

2023
01:47:01,890 --> 01:47:05,659
It would've been okay if I didn't have many parts.

2024
01:47:06,020 --> 01:47:07,630
I don't stand out.

2025
01:47:08,130 --> 01:47:10,659
I need to stand out more.

2026
01:47:11,199 --> 01:47:14,199
Why didn't you say anything earlier?

2027
01:47:14,829 --> 01:47:17,840
Can everyone share an opinion?

2028
01:47:18,140 --> 01:47:20,069
Perhaps, you want to do something in a certain part.

2029
01:47:24,579 --> 01:47:26,309
People said that KENSHIN was invisible...

2030
01:47:26,310 --> 01:47:28,310
- on the evaluation sheet, right? - Yes.

2031
01:47:28,850 --> 01:47:30,319
- Are you okay? - Yes.

2032
01:47:31,149 --> 01:47:33,289
Had I said something,

2033
01:47:34,189 --> 01:47:36,050
the atmosphere would've worsened,

2034
01:47:37,319 --> 01:47:38,489
I think.

2035
01:47:39,020 --> 01:47:41,289
By not saying anything,

2036
01:47:42,289 --> 01:47:43,359
I kept things smooth.

2037
01:47:44,159 --> 01:47:45,829
The practice went smoothly.

2038
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:50,600
(Sighing)

2039
01:47:52,600 --> 01:47:55,640
(With his worries buried deep in his heart, )

2040
01:47:56,840 --> 01:48:00,180
(he begins practicing alone.)

2041
01:48:07,789 --> 01:48:09,419
After the restroom break,

2042
01:48:09,420 --> 01:48:11,060
- we'll resume right away. - We'll resume right away.

2043
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:14,829
- SEUNGHO, shall we check? - Yes?

2044
01:48:16,260 --> 01:48:18,499
- Five, six, seven, eight. - Five, six, seven, eight.

2045
01:48:18,500 --> 01:48:21,068
(They don't stop practicing.)

2046
01:48:21,069 --> 01:48:23,369
If I practice every day...

2047
01:48:24,439 --> 01:48:28,210
If I practice more every day, I'll be able to do it.

2048
01:48:29,239 --> 01:48:30,639
My fans want to see...

2049
01:48:30,640 --> 01:48:33,109
my version of "Merry-Go-Round."

2050
01:48:35,050 --> 01:48:38,149
(KENSHIN does his best to do his part.)

2051
01:48:42,250 --> 01:48:45,459
(After lying down for a second, )

2052
01:48:45,460 --> 01:48:48,189
(he gets up.)

2053
01:48:50,729 --> 01:48:54,600
(He practices nonstop.)

2054
01:48:57,270 --> 01:49:00,909
(He continues on until late at night.)

2055
01:49:02,770 --> 01:49:04,840
- We can do it. - We can do it.

2056
01:49:05,079 --> 01:49:07,108
Let's start from the chorus of the second verse.

2057
01:49:07,109 --> 01:49:10,919
KENSHIN, if you're sick, don't dance too powerfully.

2058
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:12,220
- Okay. - Okay.

2059
01:49:12,779 --> 01:49:14,389
Is KENSHIN sick?

2060
01:49:14,390 --> 01:49:16,960
- Okay. Let's go. - Will you watch?

2061
01:49:17,390 --> 01:49:18,460
You want it too

2062
01:49:19,159 --> 01:49:22,460
(He practices passionately.)

2063
01:49:24,859 --> 01:49:28,670
(But then he staggers.)

2064
01:49:31,340 --> 01:49:32,569
Are you okay?

2065
01:49:34,010 --> 01:49:35,439
I have a headache.

2066
01:49:37,640 --> 01:49:40,249
I practiced until 6am...

2067
01:49:40,250 --> 01:49:43,278
and got an hour of sleep.

2068
01:49:43,279 --> 01:49:45,778
I think that was why I had a headache.

2069
01:49:45,779 --> 01:49:46,789
(He's in a bad condition from exhausting himself.)

2070
01:49:47,619 --> 01:49:48,948
KENSHIN, are you very sick?

2071
01:49:48,949 --> 01:49:50,159
I'm okay.

2072
01:49:51,119 --> 01:49:52,489
I can do it.

2073
01:49:52,619 --> 01:49:53,960
I was worried.

2074
01:49:54,130 --> 01:49:56,029
I watched him during practice.

2075
01:49:56,329 --> 01:49:59,300
His cute smile kept fading.

2076
01:49:59,699 --> 01:50:01,100
"He doesn't catch the eye."

2077
01:50:01,229 --> 01:50:04,170
I think he pushed himself because of that.

2078
01:50:04,539 --> 01:50:07,509
I felt so bad because I hadn't been able to care for him.

2079
01:50:07,510 --> 01:50:09,369
I became thoughtful.

2080
01:50:10,710 --> 01:50:13,510
(During the interim evaluation, )

2081
01:50:15,949 --> 01:50:19,949
(KIM SUNGMIN was in charge of the intro.)

2082
01:50:21,850 --> 01:50:24,488
(It'll be nice to use KENSHIN well.)

2083
01:50:24,489 --> 01:50:26,260
(KENSHIN isn't very visible.)

2084
01:50:27,359 --> 01:50:30,829
(There was a suggestion of making KENSHIN do the intro.)

2085
01:50:31,300 --> 01:50:33,229
I found it shocking.

2086
01:50:33,329 --> 01:50:37,569
It was one part I really wanted to take.

2087
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:40,969
We need to monitor the members too.

2088
01:50:40,970 --> 01:50:44,339
Focus on the formation for now. Then we'll film you guys.

2089
01:50:44,340 --> 01:50:45,408
- Okay. - Thank you.

2090
01:50:45,409 --> 01:50:46,538
Thank you.

2091
01:50:46,539 --> 01:50:47,710
You know,

2092
01:50:48,409 --> 01:50:50,619
during the interim evaluation,

2093
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:55,619
there was feedback about showing KENSHIN more.

2094
01:50:55,949 --> 01:51:01,289
Would it be okay if I did the intro with KENSHIN?

2095
01:51:02,729 --> 01:51:05,259
That sounds like a good idea.

2096
01:51:05,260 --> 01:51:08,728
If you do it, it could seem like the amusement park opened...

2097
01:51:08,729 --> 01:51:10,969
as KENSHIN comes out and gives an introduction.

2098
01:51:10,970 --> 01:51:12,470
You could plan it that way.

2099
01:51:14,270 --> 01:51:15,270
Together?

2100
01:51:15,670 --> 01:51:16,710
Really?

2101
01:51:17,140 --> 01:51:18,880
- Really? - Are you serious?

2102
01:51:19,340 --> 01:51:20,449
Thank you.

2103
01:51:21,079 --> 01:51:22,109
Congratulations.

2104
01:51:22,310 --> 01:51:23,380
Is this real?

2105
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:25,279
- Together? - Really?

2106
01:51:26,750 --> 01:51:30,059
Honestly, KENSHIN is the one...

2107
01:51:30,060 --> 01:51:31,489
that really suits the atmosphere of the song.

2108
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:33,318
I thought it would bring out...

2109
01:51:33,319 --> 01:51:36,460
a bigger synergy if I did it together with KENSHIN.

2110
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:38,130
I was touched.

2111
01:51:39,159 --> 01:51:40,470
I love you, SUNGMIN.

2112
01:51:42,699 --> 01:51:45,239
In the intro,

2113
01:51:46,039 --> 01:51:48,710
- could we do a double-tracking? - Where?

2114
01:51:49,140 --> 01:51:50,939
Yes. Sounds good.

2115
01:51:51,079 --> 01:51:52,810
- Sure. - Okay.

2116
01:51:54,979 --> 01:51:57,778
(The two trainees sing the intro together.)

2117
01:51:57,779 --> 01:52:00,750
- It's good. - You guys sound good.

2118
01:52:01,720 --> 01:52:04,318
(KENSHIN's spirit goes up after solving his issue.)

2119
01:52:04,319 --> 01:52:05,319
Did you see that?

2120
01:52:05,619 --> 01:52:06,689
Run it!

2121
01:52:06,760 --> 01:52:07,789
(His smile is contagious.)

2122
01:52:09,229 --> 01:52:11,059

The Original Matching by the five teams which will be evaluated...

2299
02:02:37,149 --> 02:02:40,260
by the World Assemblers themselves is now over.

2300
02:02:40,460 --> 02:02:43,259
Here's the on-site voting results by the World Assemblers.

2301
02:02:43,260 --> 02:02:46,398
Let me announce the winning team who performed the best...

2302
02:02:46,399 --> 02:02:49,569
and the top trainee of each team.

2303
02:02:50,029 --> 02:02:54,238
Before announcing the result, let me reveal the benefit...

2304
02:02:54,239 --> 02:02:56,038
to be given to the winning team and the top trainee.

2305
02:02:56,039 --> 02:02:57,169
(Revealing the benefit)

2306
02:02:57,170 --> 02:02:58,209
It's finally getting revealed.

2307
02:02:58,210 --> 02:03:00,908
I'm so curious about this.

2308
02:03:00,909 --> 02:03:03,509
To the five trainees who received...

2309
02:03:03,510 --> 02:03:06,819
the most votes from each team,

2310
02:03:07,279 --> 02:03:10,250
they will receive 50,000 benefit points.

2311
02:03:10,390 --> 02:03:12,259
It's 50,000 points.

2312
02:03:12,260 --> 02:03:14,390
- That's a lot. - That could change the ranking.

2313
02:03:14,689 --> 02:03:17,999
All the members in the winning team...

2314
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:19,529
that received the most votes...

2315
02:03:20,100 --> 02:03:21,930
- Is it 20,000 points? - It's 100,000 points.

2316
02:03:22,170 --> 02:03:23,199
It must be 150,000.

2317
02:03:23,500 --> 02:03:25,868
They will receive 10 percent more based on...

2318
02:03:25,869 --> 02:03:27,199
- What? - Really?

2319
02:03:27,270 --> 02:03:28,309
Each of the global voting scores they received...

2320
02:03:28,310 --> 02:03:29,310
(10 percent of each of their global voting scores)

2321
02:03:29,311 --> 02:03:30,979
as their benefit.

2322
02:03:31,840 --> 02:03:32,908
(A benefit of receiving 10 percent of their votes)

2323
02:03:32,909 --> 02:03:34,978
- What's going on? - That's huge.

2324
02:03:34,979 --> 02:03:36,880
- This will change the rankings. - That's a lot.

2325
02:03:37,279 --> 02:03:38,978
- Ten percent? - My gosh.

2326
02:03:38,979 --> 02:03:41,118
- Is everyone getting that? - The higher their ranking...

2327
02:03:41,119 --> 02:03:42,419
People like KENSHIN...

2328
02:03:42,420 --> 02:03:44,050
- would get 300,000 points. - No way.

2329
02:03:45,520 --> 02:03:47,420
Ten percent is quite huge.

2330
02:03:47,560 --> 02:03:49,228
When I heard it was ten percent of the voting score,

2331
02:03:49,229 --> 02:03:51,398
I knew it was a huge benefit.

2332
02:03:51,399 --> 02:03:53,198
The more votes you get,

2333
02:03:53,199 --> 02:03:55,368
the bigger your benefit would be.

2334
02:03:55,369 --> 02:03:57,028
That means the members of the winning team...

2335
02:03:57,029 --> 02:03:58,800
would be receiving a powerful weapon.

2336
02:03:58,970 --> 02:04:01,309
With the extra ten percent,

2337
02:04:01,310 --> 02:04:03,409
I felt like I could make it to the final round.

2338
02:04:03,739 --> 02:04:05,339
Now, let me announce...

2339
02:04:05,340 --> 02:04:07,908
the ranking of each team and each member...

2340
02:04:07,909 --> 02:04:08,979
of the team.

2341
02:04:09,449 --> 02:04:11,119
(Personal ranking)

2342
02:04:11,479 --> 02:04:12,850
That's how they're going to reveal it.

2343
02:04:13,350 --> 02:04:14,949
Are they going to show our personal ranking too?

2344
02:04:15,090 --> 02:04:16,090
Gosh.

2345
02:04:16,091 --> 02:04:20,158
Here is the team in fifth place, which was determined...

2346
02:04:20,159 --> 02:04:21,260
by the World Assemblers' votes.

2347
02:04:23,060 --> 02:04:24,760
- My gosh. - Fifth place?

2348
02:04:24,829 --> 02:04:26,328
I hope we all move on to the final round.

2349
02:04:26,329 --> 02:04:27,359
Let's go to the finals.

2350
02:04:27,670 --> 02:04:30,269
All the best trainees were...

2351
02:04:30,270 --> 02:04:31,938
either in Team "Merry-Go-Round" or "Trigger,"

2352
02:04:31,939 --> 02:04:34,409
so we were just hoping to get third place, at least.

2353
02:04:36,409 --> 02:04:38,908
Our team had a lot of trainees...

2354
02:04:38,909 --> 02:04:40,738
in the lower rankings.

2355
02:04:40,739 --> 02:04:42,648
We did our best...

2356
02:04:42,649 --> 02:04:45,420
with the hopes of avoiding fifth place.

2357
02:04:46,119 --> 02:04:48,619
I hope it's not us.

2358
02:04:48,989 --> 02:04:51,520
Please reveal fifth place now.

2359
02:04:53,159 --> 02:04:55,329
(JEONGMIN, JOOHYUN, JOONWOO, SIHUN, FONG, GUNWOO, HEEJU)

2360
02:04:56,090 --> 02:04:57,799
The team in fifth place for the Original Matching...

2361
02:04:57,800 --> 02:04:59,960
received a total of 54 votes.

2362
02:05:00,329 --> 02:05:02,029
It's Team "KOOL-AID."

2363
02:05:02,329 --> 02:05:04,170
We knew we'd receive a low ranking,

2364
02:05:04,199 --> 02:05:06,199
but after the announcement,

2365
02:05:06,970 --> 02:05:08,470
I though, "We really are at the bottom."

2366
02:05:08,640 --> 02:05:10,809
"Does that mean we didn't stand out at all?"

2367
02:05:10,810 --> 02:05:11,839
It was really disappointing.

2368
02:05:11,840 --> 02:05:13,439
Why did SIHUN's ranking drop so much?

2369
02:05:14,109 --> 02:05:16,108
Out of the seven trainees,

2370
02:05:16,109 --> 02:05:17,879
I had the highest ranking,

2371
02:05:17,880 --> 02:05:19,919
and I had an experience in making it...

2372
02:05:19,920 --> 02:05:21,188
to the debut team,

2373
02:05:21,189 --> 02:05:24,119
so I couldn't believe that I ranked fourth in our team.

2374
02:05:24,489 --> 02:05:26,488
- JEONGMIN won first. - He did great.

2375
02:05:26,489 --> 02:05:29,589
- The top trainee in "KOOL-AID..." - JEONGMIN.

2376
02:05:29,590 --> 02:05:31,028
- to receive 50,000 points... - You were good.

2377
02:05:31,029 --> 02:05:32,959
Is Trainee KIM JEONGMIN.

2378
02:05:32,960 --> 02:05:33,960
(KIM JEONGMIN)

2379
02:05:33,961 --> 02:05:35,329
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

2380
02:05:37,270 --> 02:05:39,568
- JEONGMIN's ranking will go up. - The top trainee...

2381
02:05:39,569 --> 02:05:41,608
After finishing our performance,

2382
02:05:41,609 --> 02:05:43,210
I had a lot of regrets.

2383
02:05:43,970 --> 02:05:47,278
I'm not sure if I deserve...

2384
02:05:47,279 --> 02:05:48,349
being the top trainee.

2385
02:05:48,350 --> 02:05:49,850
I'm a bit in a dilemma.

2386
02:05:50,109 --> 02:05:51,849
This is the first time...

2387
02:05:51,850 --> 02:05:54,390
I won first within our team, so I'm really happy.

2388
02:05:54,789 --> 02:05:56,590
But I wasn't sure if I deserved that ranking.

2389
02:05:56,789 --> 02:05:58,158
I felt cautious.

2390
02:05:58,159 --> 02:06:00,288
I was also worried if I'd be able to get to the final round...

2391
02:06:00,289 --> 02:06:02,890
after receiving 50,000 points.

2392
02:06:03,960 --> 02:06:06,029
Next, let me announce the fourth place.

2393
02:06:06,560 --> 02:06:09,169
I hope we're in one ranking higher.

2394
02:06:09,170 --> 02:06:10,600
Please put us in a higher ranking.

2395
02:06:11,500 --> 02:06:13,769
Director Ryan Sewon Jhun warned us he wasn't going to see us again...

2396
02:06:13,770 --> 02:06:15,840
if we ever ranked in fourth.

2397
02:06:16,710 --> 02:06:18,079
My life is getting shorter.

2398
02:06:18,210 --> 02:06:20,809
Our song and choreography are really beautiful.

2399
02:06:20,810 --> 02:06:23,778
I thought our vocals were...

2400
02:06:23,779 --> 02:06:25,948
more stable compared to other teams.

2401
02:06:25,949 --> 02:06:28,750
I thought we had a chance of winning the 2nd or 3rd place.

2402
02:06:29,020 --> 02:06:30,350
Please reveal it now.

2403
02:06:31,689 --> 02:06:33,060
This is cruel.

2404
02:06:33,489 --> 02:06:35,089
(HAJOON, YOUNGSEO, BINGHUA, HANBIN, )

2405
02:06:35,090 --> 02:06:36,689
(TAEHWAN, JAEWON, CHENYU)

2406
02:06:39,260 --> 02:06:40,399
What's up with HAJOON?

2407
02:06:40,970 --> 02:06:42,300
- BINGHUA is in third place. - My gosh.

2408
02:06:43,329 --> 02:06:44,600
Look at HAJOON's ranking!

2409
02:06:44,869 --> 02:06:46,139
- HAJOON... - What's that, HAJOON?

2410
02:06:46,140 --> 02:06:48,938
(Team Ranking, Individual Ranking)

2411
02:06:48,939 --> 02:06:50,839
Actually, it was quite disappointing.

2412
02:06:50,840 --> 02:06:52,239
The ranking, I mean.

2413
02:06:53,140 --> 02:06:54,710
- Gosh, HAJOON is in 1st place. - HAJOON placed 1st.

2414
02:06:56,909 --> 02:06:57,920
No way.

2415
02:06:59,649 --> 02:07:01,090
He surpassed the main vocalist.

2416
02:07:01,119 --> 02:07:04,618
The trainee in first place in Team "Time After Time..."

2417
02:07:04,619 --> 02:07:07,930
who won 50,000 benefit points is Trainee WOO HAJOON.

2418
02:07:13,630 --> 02:07:16,828
For Position Matching and Rival Matching,

2419
02:07:16,829 --> 02:07:20,169
they let me win first place, and I was grateful.

2420
02:07:20,170 --> 02:07:22,868
But this time, I thought, "Was I not good enough..."

2421
02:07:22,869 --> 02:07:24,479
"to win first place?"

2422
02:07:24,710 --> 02:07:26,140
Gosh, you can never tell.

2423
02:07:26,310 --> 02:07:27,380
I never imagined this.

2424
02:07:27,609 --> 02:07:29,710
- They're all doing so well. - Trainee WOO HAJOON.

2425
02:07:30,210 --> 02:07:32,749
I'm grateful toward the World Assemblers...

2426
02:07:32,750 --> 02:07:34,180
who thought well of me.

2427
02:07:34,520 --> 02:07:36,389
I feel bad for my team members too.

2428
02:07:36,390 --> 02:07:37,989
I'm having mixed feelings.

2429
02:07:38,189 --> 02:07:40,459
It was my first time winning first place...

2430
02:07:40,460 --> 02:07:42,090
through this show.

2431
02:07:42,359 --> 02:07:45,229
I felt a little overwhelmed.

2432
02:07:45,430 --> 02:07:46,829
- Thank you. - Well done.

2433
02:07:46,960 --> 02:07:49,229
- Great job. - Great work.

2434
02:07:49,529 --> 02:07:50,670
Great job.

2435
02:07:51,399 --> 02:07:53,169
- Well done. - Great work.

2436
02:07:53,170 --> 02:07:55,939
I'll announce the team in third place.

2437
02:07:56,170 --> 02:07:58,279
- Please don't call us. Not yet. - We have Team "Trigger."

2438
02:07:58,539 --> 02:07:59,640
It must be us.

2439
02:08:00,079 --> 02:08:01,750
- It's us. - Team "Breaking News."

2440
02:08:02,579 --> 02:08:04,448
And Team "Merry-Go-Round."

2441
02:08:04,449 --> 02:08:05,619
(3rd candidate for 3rd place. Team "Merry-Go-Round")

2442
02:08:06,319 --> 02:08:08,349
It's the team in third place for Original Matching.

2443
02:08:08,350 --> 02:08:09,520
(Which team is in 3rd place?)

2444
02:08:09,890 --> 02:08:11,420
Please reveal it now.

2445
02:08:13,289 --> 02:08:15,090
- I think it's us. - Third place?

2446
02:08:15,460 --> 02:08:17,159
When I watched Team "Trigger" perform,

2447
02:08:17,189 --> 02:08:19,699
there were so many wow points.

2448
02:08:19,859 --> 02:08:22,068
Team "Breaking News" also showcased a lot of sides...

2449
02:08:22,069 --> 02:08:23,569
that suited them.

2450
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,100
I thought the 2 teams would take 1st and 2nd places.

2451
02:08:27,069 --> 02:08:28,140
Not yet.

2452
02:08:28,569 --> 02:08:30,469
Every one of our team members...

2453
02:08:30,470 --> 02:08:31,939
want to make it to the finals.

2454
02:08:33,079 --> 02:08:34,778
"Please just move up by one rank."

2455
02:08:34,779 --> 02:08:37,479
I prayed that we'd advance just by one rank.

2456
02:08:49,329 --> 02:08:50,759
(3rd place, Team "Breaking News")

2457
02:08:50,760 --> 02:08:52,198
(1st place, AHN JUNWON)

2458
02:08:52,199 --> 02:08:54,470
- JUNWON is in 1st place. - The team in 3rd place...

2459
02:08:54,569 --> 02:08:56,500
for the Original Matching received 83 votes in total.

2460
02:08:56,930 --> 02:08:59,869
- It's Team "Breaking News." - Hey.

2461
02:09:01,739 --> 02:09:02,970
JUNWON is in first place.

2462
02:09:03,739 --> 02:09:05,579
It's only a four-vote difference.

2463
02:09:06,409 --> 02:09:07,850
- It was close. - It really was.

2464
02:09:08,409 --> 02:09:11,078
I really wanted our team to place first, no matter what,

2465
02:09:11,079 --> 02:09:14,249
but we made it to third place, at least.

2466
02:09:14,250 --> 02:09:16,550
I was glad about that.

2467
02:09:17,350 --> 02:09:19,260
JUNWON is in first place?

2468
02:09:19,689 --> 02:09:21,020
HYUNWOO is in last place?

2469
02:09:21,529 --> 02:09:23,229
We can't predict...

2470
02:09:23,829 --> 02:09:25,060
what our individual ranking will be.

2471
02:09:25,859 --> 02:09:27,129
I was a bit sad.

2472
02:09:27,130 --> 02:09:28,969
"Why must I realize myself..."

2473
02:09:28,970 --> 02:09:31,799
"that I'm not so popular?"

2474
02:09:31,800 --> 02:09:34,170
That thought occurred to me the most.

2475
02:09:35,210 --> 02:09:36,669
I can't say that I worked harder...

2476
02:09:36,670 --> 02:09:39,310
compared to the other members.

2477
02:09:39,880 --> 02:09:41,949
But considering myself alone,

2478
02:09:42,250 --> 02:09:44,979
I really did my best and performed without any regret.

2479
02:09:45,319 --> 02:09:47,750
That's why I was able to get a good result.

2480
02:09:47,850 --> 02:09:50,849
I'm really grateful toward my members...

2481
02:09:50,850 --> 02:09:51,920
who made me improve once more.

2482
02:09:52,659 --> 02:09:55,129
Great. Now, we have two teams remaining.

2483
02:09:55,130 --> 02:09:57,159
- Congratulations. - And Team "Trigger."

2484
02:09:57,329 --> 02:09:58,430
Well done.

2485
02:09:58,800 --> 02:09:59,829
I'm happy.

2486
02:09:59,859 --> 02:10:02,300
It's my 1st time winning 1st place.

2487
02:10:03,029 --> 02:10:04,868
But here's what I was upset about.

2488
02:10:04,869 --> 02:10:06,868
I'm not sure how many will make it to the finals,

2489
02:10:06,869 --> 02:10:09,568
but there are some members...

2490
02:10:09,569 --> 02:10:11,180
who are on the brink of getting eliminated.

2491
02:10:11,439 --> 02:10:13,309
I'm upset that I couldn't be of help...

2492
02:10:13,310 --> 02:10:15,850
to those members.

2493
02:10:17,680 --> 02:10:19,350
Now, we have two teams remaining.

2494
02:10:19,920 --> 02:10:21,249
Team "Merry-Go-Round..."

2495
02:10:21,250 --> 02:10:22,719
(Only the announcement of 1st and 2nd-place teams remain.)

2496
02:10:22,720 --> 02:10:23,789
and Team "Trigger."

2497
02:10:25,890 --> 02:10:27,659
Gosh, 500 votes were given to those 2 teams.

2498
02:10:28,859 --> 02:10:31,329
Trainer NAM JIWOON of Team "Merry-Go-Round."

2499
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:33,130
Do you think your team will win first place?

2500
02:10:33,800 --> 02:10:38,270
I've never won first place on PROJECT 7,

2501
02:10:38,500 --> 02:10:40,239
but I want to this time.

2502
02:10:40,770 --> 02:10:44,239
Great. Trainee JEON MINWOOK of Team "Trigger."

2503
02:10:44,640 --> 02:10:46,039
Yes, I...

2504
02:10:46,779 --> 02:10:48,379
feel bad for JIWOON,

2505
02:10:48,380 --> 02:10:50,909
but I've won first place many times on PROJECT 7,

2506
02:10:51,079 --> 02:10:52,649
so I want to win first place again.

2507
02:10:53,420 --> 02:10:54,520
That's so cool.

2508
02:10:54,590 --> 02:10:55,689
- So cool. - Great.

2509
02:10:57,590 --> 02:10:59,720
That was intense.

2510
02:10:59,920 --> 02:11:01,229
Swag!

2511
02:11:01,859 --> 02:11:05,800
I'll announce the team in first place for the Original Matching.

2512
02:11:06,199 --> 02:11:08,469
Based on the voting results of the World Assemblers,

2513
02:11:08,470 --> 02:11:10,629
it's the team that pulled off their most well...

2514
02:11:10,630 --> 02:11:12,670
among the five teams.

2515
02:11:12,739 --> 02:11:16,640
Team "Merry-Go-Round" was so refreshing, cute, and energetic.

2516
02:11:17,039 --> 02:11:18,879
Their performance was so well-oriented...

2517
02:11:18,880 --> 02:11:20,979
that I feel a little anxious.

2518
02:11:21,109 --> 02:11:23,978
Team "Trigger" has a different charm than ours.

2519
02:11:23,979 --> 02:11:28,148
I think they'll charm the World Assemblers with sexiness.

2520
02:11:28,149 --> 02:11:30,189
I think they left a stronger impression.

2521
02:11:30,619 --> 02:11:33,319
The team that will win the benefit of the first place...

2522
02:11:33,789 --> 02:11:35,930
This could change the ranking for the team that'd debut.

2523
02:11:36,489 --> 02:11:37,999
The members of a team that places first...

2524
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:39,658
will take ten percent of their votes.

2525
02:11:39,659 --> 02:11:42,499
I thought winning first place as a team was a huge benefit,

2526
02:11:42,500 --> 02:11:43,829
so I really wanted to win first place.

2527
02:11:44,800 --> 02:11:47,340
The benefit itself was huge,

2528
02:11:47,439 --> 02:11:49,239
so I really wanted to win first place.

2529
02:11:52,479 --> 02:11:53,779
It'll be revealed now.

2530
02:11:54,579 --> 02:11:55,609
Team "Trigger."

2531
02:11:55,750 --> 02:11:56,810
Team "Merry-Go-Round."

2532
02:12:00,079 --> 02:12:01,390
(Team Ranking, Individual Ranking)

2533
02:12:05,960 --> 02:12:07,619
It'll be revealed now.

2534
02:12:07,819 --> 02:12:08,890
Team "Trigger."

2535
02:12:09,260 --> 02:12:10,289
Team "Merry-Go-Round."

2536
02:12:13,729 --> 02:12:15,069
(Team Ranking, Individual Ranking)

2537
02:12:24,739 --> 02:12:28,680
(1st place, "Merry-Go-Round")

2538
02:12:29,779 --> 02:12:32,819
(Original Matching 1st place, Team "Merry-Go-Round")

2539
02:12:33,149 --> 02:12:34,380
Oh, my gosh.

2540
02:12:37,090 --> 02:12:38,319
- Goodness. - That was close.

2541
02:12:39,859 --> 02:12:40,859
Well done.

2542
02:12:41,189 --> 02:12:42,189
It's Team "Trigger."

2543
02:12:42,859 --> 02:12:44,130
Team "Merry-Go-Round" won first place?

2544
02:12:46,359 --> 02:12:47,359
That was unexpected.

2545
02:12:48,270 --> 02:12:50,670
- It's Team "Merry-Go-Round?" - They're amazing.

2546
02:12:51,640 --> 02:12:52,640
That's crazy.

2547
02:12:52,641 --> 02:12:54,239
It's four times higher than ours.

2548
02:12:55,640 --> 02:12:57,209
They're indeed a team with trainees who are close to debuting.

2549
02:12:57,210 --> 02:12:58,779
The leader, Trainee JUNG SEYUN.

2550
02:12:59,640 --> 02:13:01,510
The team in first place for the Original Matching...

2551
02:13:01,810 --> 02:13:03,880
won 227 votes.

2552
02:13:04,279 --> 02:13:05,949
It's Team "Merry-Go-Round."

2553
02:13:07,520 --> 02:13:09,250
Congratulations. The leader, Trainee JUNG SEYUN.

2554
02:13:09,789 --> 02:13:10,819
Yes.

2555
02:13:11,960 --> 02:13:14,619
All seven of us worked really hard.

2556
02:13:14,960 --> 02:13:18,699
I know the other teams worked hard to prepare for their performance,

2557
02:13:18,899 --> 02:13:21,029
but we also worked really hard.

2558
02:13:21,300 --> 02:13:24,970
We could win first place because we worked hard.

2559
02:13:25,069 --> 02:13:28,239
All 35 trainees, thank you for your hard work.

2560
02:13:28,369 --> 02:13:29,470
Thank you.

2561
02:13:30,170 --> 02:13:33,340
I became the leader of a team that won first place on PROJECT 7.

2562
02:13:33,609 --> 02:13:35,179
Honestly, it was the best moment...

2563
02:13:35,180 --> 02:13:37,109
of my trainee life.

2564
02:13:37,609 --> 02:13:40,350
Team "Trigger" won 187 votes...

2565
02:13:40,779 --> 02:13:42,318
and placed second, unfortunately.

2566
02:13:42,319 --> 02:13:44,148
Let's hear from the team in second place as well.

2567
02:13:44,149 --> 02:13:47,689
First of all, I want to thank my team members who worked really hard.

2568
02:13:47,720 --> 02:13:49,289
Although we didn't win first place,

2569
02:13:49,430 --> 02:13:52,260
I think all of us felt that we performed without any regrets...

2570
02:13:52,630 --> 02:13:55,500
after we came down from the stage.

2571
02:13:55,829 --> 02:13:57,828
I hope our performance will come to your mind...

2572
02:13:57,829 --> 02:14:00,739
from time to time.

2573
02:14:02,039 --> 02:14:03,109
Thank you.

2574
02:14:05,439 --> 02:14:08,148
Everyone on the team that won first place in Original Matching...

2575
02:14:08,149 --> 02:14:10,278
will win ten percent of the votes you received...

2576
02:14:10,279 --> 02:14:13,350
as benefit points.

2577
02:14:14,819 --> 02:14:17,219
Now that I won benefit points,

2578
02:14:17,220 --> 02:14:19,890
I'll try to advance to the debut team.

2579
02:14:20,960 --> 02:14:22,459
I'm curious about their individual ranking too.

2580
02:14:22,460 --> 02:14:23,460
Before announcing...

2581
02:14:23,630 --> 02:14:26,460
Before announcing the individual ranking of the team in first place,

2582
02:14:26,659 --> 02:14:30,029
I'll reveal the individual ranking of the team in second place first.

2583
02:14:30,130 --> 02:14:31,770
MINWOOK must be in first place.

2584
02:14:31,869 --> 02:14:33,270
Of course MINWOOK is in first place.

2585
02:14:36,069 --> 02:14:38,109
It could be MAJINGXIANG.

2586
02:14:38,539 --> 02:14:39,609
No way.

2587
02:14:40,739 --> 02:14:41,880
I'm really curious.

2588
02:14:42,510 --> 02:14:44,479
It'll be revealed now.

2589
02:14:44,819 --> 02:14:46,220
(Team Ranking, Individual Ranking)

2590
02:14:51,520 --> 02:14:53,288
What?

2591
02:14:53,289 --> 02:14:55,130
What? No way.

2592
02:14:57,229 --> 02:14:58,728
(MAJINGXIANG, JANG YEOJUN, JEON MINWOOK, KIM HYUNWOO, )

2593
02:14:58,729 --> 02:15:00,199
(YICHEN, LYNNLYNN, PARK JUNSEO)

2594
02:15:01,100 --> 02:15:02,828
(1st: MAJINGXIANG, 2nd: JANG YEOJUN, )

2595
02:15:02,829 --> 02:15:04,868
(3rd: JEON MINWOOK, 4th: KIM HYUNWOO, )

2596
02:15:04,869 --> 02:15:06,500
- Who won first place? - You.

2597
02:15:08,210 --> 02:15:09,970
What?

2598
02:15:11,069 --> 02:15:12,509
- Really? - What?

2599
02:15:12,510 --> 02:15:14,539
- This... - Really?

2600
02:15:14,850 --> 02:15:16,850
In Team "Trigger" which is in second place,

2601
02:15:16,979 --> 02:15:18,948
the trainee in first place who won the benefit...

2602
02:15:18,949 --> 02:15:22,288
of 50,000 points was MAJINGXIANG.

2603
02:15:22,289 --> 02:15:23,319
Congratulations.

2604
02:15:24,090 --> 02:15:25,959
Thank you.

2605
02:15:25,960 --> 02:15:27,260
Trainee MAJINGXIANG.

2606
02:15:27,420 --> 02:15:28,729
MINWOOK is in third place?

2607
02:15:29,560 --> 02:15:32,029
I, of course, feel disappointed.

2608
02:15:32,300 --> 02:15:34,159
I can do better next time.

2609
02:15:34,430 --> 02:15:36,430
- JUNSEO is in last place? - Does this make sense?

2610
02:15:37,170 --> 02:15:38,670
I was actually very flustered.

2611
02:15:39,100 --> 02:15:40,769
I thought the seventh place...

2612
02:15:40,770 --> 02:15:44,239
was a low ranking compared to the performance I showed.

2613
02:15:44,340 --> 02:15:47,038
- I keep getting shocked. - I really didn't imagine this.

2614
02:15:47,039 --> 02:15:49,278
You might be in first place, SEUNGHO.

2615
02:15:49,279 --> 02:15:50,350
Congratulations.

2616
02:15:51,279 --> 02:15:55,350
I received lots of feedback that I wasn't noticeable...

2617
02:15:55,720 --> 02:15:59,719
at the first interim evaluation.

2618
02:15:59,720 --> 02:16:03,529
But I took first place at the end.

2619
02:16:03,560 --> 02:16:05,999
I feel very thankful to my team members.

2620
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:10,669
I didn't win first place because I did well.

2621
02:16:10,670 --> 02:16:13,639
I thank MINWOOK, HYUNWOO, JUNSEO,

2622
02:16:13,640 --> 02:16:16,738
YICHEN, LYNNLYNN, and YEOJUN.

2623
02:16:16,739 --> 02:16:21,779
I thank the World Assemblers for liking me.

2624
02:16:21,850 --> 02:16:24,349
I'll do my best with a humble attitude.

2625
02:16:24,350 --> 02:16:25,449
Thank you.

2626
02:16:27,619 --> 02:16:31,149
Next, the individual rankings...

2627
02:16:31,590 --> 02:16:34,120
of the team in first place, Team "Merry-Go-Round" will be revealed.

2628
02:16:34,360 --> 02:16:35,989
KENSHIN must've won first place, right?

2629
02:16:36,530 --> 02:16:38,399
There could be a plot twist here as well.

2630
02:16:39,530 --> 02:16:40,898
I don't think there will be.

2631
02:16:40,899 --> 02:16:42,068
- What? - I don't think there will be.

2632
02:16:42,069 --> 02:16:43,100
KENSHIN?

2633
02:16:43,629 --> 02:16:46,139
- KENSHIN. - KENSHIN.

2634
02:16:46,600 --> 02:16:49,439
It might be SEUNGHO or KYOUNGBAE unexpectedly.

2635
02:16:49,440 --> 02:16:50,440
I think it's KYOUNGBAE.

2636
02:16:50,870 --> 02:16:52,440
I can't predict anything now.

2637
02:16:53,479 --> 02:16:55,450
Who is in first place?

2638
02:16:55,850 --> 02:16:57,648
- Gosh. - Gosh.

2639
02:16:57,649 --> 02:16:58,949
- What? - I told you.

2640
02:16:58,950 --> 02:17:00,079
Amazing.

2641
02:17:00,680 --> 02:17:02,548
(SONG SEUNGHO, NAM JIWOON, SAKURADA KENSHIN, )

2642
02:17:02,549 --> 02:17:04,319
(SEO KYOUNGBAE, KIM SUNGMIN, JUNG SEYUN, ANDY)

2643
02:17:04,989 --> 02:17:06,689
- What? - You see?

2644
02:17:06,690 --> 02:17:08,158
- What? - I told you.

2645
02:17:08,159 --> 02:17:09,259
Amazing.

2646
02:17:09,260 --> 02:17:10,489
JIWOON.

2647
02:17:10,530 --> 02:17:12,059
- SEUNGHO. - SEUNGHO.

2648
02:17:12,899 --> 02:17:15,170
In Team "Merry-Go-Round..."

2649
02:17:15,329 --> 02:17:16,399
KENSHIN.

2650
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:19,139
Really?

2651
02:17:19,340 --> 02:17:20,440
Congratulations, SEUNGHO.

2652
02:17:21,399 --> 02:17:23,068
In Team "Merry-Go-Round,"

2653
02:17:23,069 --> 02:17:25,540
the trainee in 1st place who won the benefit...

2654
02:17:25,840 --> 02:17:29,449
of 50,000 points was Trainee SONG SEUNGHO.

2655
02:17:29,450 --> 02:17:30,548
SEUNGHO.

2656
02:17:30,549 --> 02:17:33,479
SEUNGHO was in 1st place, and I was in 3rd place.

2657
02:17:33,620 --> 02:17:35,389
I was a bit shocked.

2658
02:17:35,850 --> 02:17:39,119
But our team is in first place, so it's okay.

2659
02:17:39,120 --> 02:17:41,629
Everything was turned upside down.

2660
02:17:42,760 --> 02:17:44,789
I really thank the World Assemblers...

2661
02:17:44,790 --> 02:17:47,458
for bringing me up to such a high ranking.

2662
02:17:47,459 --> 02:17:51,430
I received a ranking that I never expected, so I'm very shocked.

2663
02:17:51,770 --> 02:17:53,670
I really thank the members of Team "Merry-Go-Round..."

2664
02:17:53,770 --> 02:17:56,170
that helped me win first place.

2665
02:17:56,409 --> 02:17:59,679
I'll try harder to deserve this ranking.

2666
02:17:59,680 --> 02:18:00,680
Thank you.

2667
02:18:00,681 --> 02:18:01,709
Congratulations.

2668
02:18:02,549 --> 02:18:03,779
Great.

2669
02:18:03,780 --> 02:18:06,479
SEUNGHO's position in the debut team will become stronger.

2670
02:18:07,420 --> 02:18:10,250
As a result of the on-site voting of the World Assemblers,

2671
02:18:10,319 --> 02:18:12,120
the trainees that took first place in their teams,

2672
02:18:12,489 --> 02:18:14,589
Trainees SONG SEUNGHO, MAJINGXIANG,

2673
02:18:14,590 --> 02:18:17,929
AHN JUNWON, WOO HAJOON, and KIM JEONGMIN...

2674
02:18:17,930 --> 02:18:20,959
will each earn 50,000 benefit points each.

2675
02:18:22,129 --> 02:18:25,138
And the members of Team "Merry-Go-Round..."

2676
02:18:25,139 --> 02:18:27,599
that received the most team votes...

2677
02:18:27,600 --> 02:18:30,339
will all be given a benefit.

2678
02:18:30,340 --> 02:18:33,879
(They earn 10 percent of the voting points.)

2679
02:18:34,239 --> 02:18:35,879
That must be nice.

2680
02:18:36,079 --> 02:18:38,420
They're all in high rankings too.

2681
02:18:40,219 --> 02:18:42,090
The last project toward the debut.

2682
02:18:42,250 --> 02:18:45,389
The number of trainees who can be on the final project stage...

2683
02:18:46,889 --> 02:18:47,959
Will it be announced today?

2684
02:18:48,489 --> 02:18:51,829
Will be revealed next week...

2685
02:18:53,100 --> 02:18:54,760
- in the Third Passing Ceremony. - No.

2686
02:18:54,829 --> 02:18:55,829
That's cruel.

2687
02:18:55,830 --> 02:18:58,440
That's right. We have the Passing Ceremony next week.

2688
02:18:58,969 --> 02:19:01,139
Assemble and upgrade. PROJECT 7.

2689
02:19:01,440 --> 02:19:03,968
Who will be the trainees assembled in the final debut group?

2690
02:19:03,969 --> 02:19:06,979
(Who will be the trainees assembled in the final debut group?)

2691
02:19:09,049 --> 02:19:11,078
(The trainees to be in the finals will be decided...)

2692
02:19:11,079 --> 02:19:13,149
(in the last Passing Ceremony in the next episode.)

2693
02:19:15,219 --> 02:19:16,289
(The Original Matching ends.)

2694
02:19:16,290 --> 02:19:17,419
- Thank you. - Well done.

2695
02:19:17,420 --> 02:19:19,290
- Well done. - We took first place.

2696
02:19:19,389 --> 02:19:21,189
- Well done. - You should debut, SEUNGHO.

2697
02:19:21,190 --> 02:19:22,558
You won first place.

2698
02:19:22,559 --> 02:19:24,128
- SEUNGHO. - Congratulations.

2699
02:19:24,129 --> 02:19:25,229
We took first place.

2700
02:19:25,399 --> 02:19:26,859
- What is this? - Your mother would love this.

2701
02:19:26,860 --> 02:19:28,729
I know. SEUNGHO.

2702
02:19:29,030 --> 02:19:30,599
- SEUNGHO. - You did a good job.

2703
02:19:30,600 --> 02:19:32,099
- Hey. - You rapped really well.

2704
02:19:32,100 --> 02:19:33,769
- I told you. - I didn't even have many parts.

2705
02:19:33,770 --> 02:19:35,039
I said you would win.

2706
02:19:35,040 --> 02:19:37,770
Even your style today. It looked like you'd win first place.

2707
02:19:37,969 --> 02:19:39,579
I don't know if I deserve this ranking.

2708
02:19:39,879 --> 02:19:41,680
- You did well. - Of course you deserve it.

2709
02:19:42,010 --> 02:19:43,309
- You did well. - You got that because you did well.

2710
02:19:44,379 --> 02:19:45,379
You did well.

2711
02:19:47,149 --> 02:19:49,089
- It was close. - I'm sorry. I'm not popular.

2712
02:19:49,090 --> 02:19:51,249
- I'm in 34th place. - No. Don't say that.

2713
02:19:51,250 --> 02:19:53,290
- I'm in 34th place. - Don't say that.

2714
02:19:53,459 --> 02:19:55,019
You should win ninth place.

2715
02:19:55,020 --> 02:19:56,558
- In the next Passing Ceremony. - Ninth place?

2716
02:19:56,559 --> 02:19:58,430
If I go above tenth place...

2717
02:19:59,059 --> 02:20:00,599
- Gosh. - You might debut.

2718
02:20:00,600 --> 02:20:02,129
I'd feel more burdened.

2719
02:20:03,200 --> 02:20:05,100
- You should work harder and debut. - Right.

2720
02:20:05,139 --> 02:20:06,200
You should debut.

2721
02:20:07,139 --> 02:20:09,339
I should debut. I should go to the Golden Disc Awards.

2722
02:20:09,340 --> 02:20:10,409
You should.

2723
02:20:11,739 --> 02:20:13,479
- What are you doing? - Congratulations.

2724
02:20:13,579 --> 02:20:16,510
- There you go. - Hey. That's enough.

2725
02:20:16,909 --> 02:20:18,349
- You're doing well. - Congratulations.

2726
02:20:18,350 --> 02:20:19,350
You did it.

2727
02:20:19,351 --> 02:20:20,478
(Some found hope from the unexpected results.)

2728
02:20:20,479 --> 02:20:22,149
Buy me beef short plate.

2729
02:20:22,219 --> 02:20:23,319
Hey.

2730
02:20:24,190 --> 02:20:25,519
- Well done. - Yes.

2731
02:20:25,520 --> 02:20:27,519
(Some faced discouragement.)

2732
02:20:27,520 --> 02:20:29,530
I was cocky because I was in first place many times.

2733
02:20:30,930 --> 02:20:32,228
You were too cocky.

2734
02:20:32,229 --> 02:20:35,099
For three months.

2735
02:20:35,100 --> 02:20:36,298
I thought you'd be in first place.

2736
02:20:36,299 --> 02:20:38,270
Being in last place feels new.

2737
02:20:38,370 --> 02:20:39,370
Great work.

2738
02:20:39,371 --> 02:20:41,299
It's sad. This is the last.

2739
02:20:41,469 --> 02:20:43,770
No. It's not the last.

2740
02:20:44,239 --> 02:20:46,209
We should meet after we debut.

2741
02:20:47,409 --> 02:20:49,709
I'll do my best. It's hard.

2742
02:20:49,950 --> 02:20:52,049
It's hard.

2743
02:20:53,620 --> 02:20:55,818
I'm not sure if I can continue...

2744
02:20:55,819 --> 02:20:58,860
in the last project on PROJECT 7.

2745
02:20:59,620 --> 02:21:02,328
I had this dream of becoming an idol...

2746
02:21:02,329 --> 02:21:05,559
ever since I was young.

2747
02:21:05,829 --> 02:21:08,329
I really want to go to the finals.

2748
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,839
I had many experiences where I couldn't become...

2749
02:21:12,840 --> 02:21:16,040
an idol in the last steps.

2750
02:21:16,370 --> 02:21:19,339
I suddenly felt anxious.

2751
02:21:19,340 --> 02:21:20,379
It's okay.

2752
02:21:22,309 --> 02:21:24,309
I'll do my best as if my life depends on it.

2753
02:21:24,479 --> 02:21:27,450
I want to debut. I'm very desperate.

2754
02:21:29,149 --> 02:21:30,249
I will debut.

2755
02:21:30,250 --> 02:21:31,519
I will do it.

2756
02:21:31,520 --> 02:21:34,559
(Which trainee will move closer to his dream of debuting?)

2757
02:21:37,059 --> 02:21:39,030
(The trainees visit Wolmi Island.)

2758
02:21:39,229 --> 02:21:40,459
(Let's go!)

2759
02:21:41,430 --> 02:21:43,770
(They're having fun.)

2760
02:21:44,069 --> 02:21:45,700
(Meanwhile, the other trainees...)

2761
02:21:46,299 --> 02:21:47,739
(We're making kimchi!)

2762
02:21:48,340 --> 02:21:51,040
(They all make kimchi together.)

2763
02:21:51,510 --> 02:21:53,840
(I heard your son took an audition to become an idol.)

2764
02:21:54,209 --> 02:21:56,110
- He cried a lot. - He cried.

2765
02:21:56,379 --> 02:21:57,509
(Tasting)

2766
02:21:57,510 --> 02:21:58,620
(Eating)

2767
02:21:58,649 --> 02:21:59,680
(Again?)

2768
02:21:59,950 --> 02:22:01,780
(While he confesses his love for kimchi...)

2769
02:22:02,590 --> 02:22:04,319
(They even go to a sauna.)

2770
02:22:05,219 --> 02:22:07,520
(A sight we normally didn't see.)

2771
02:22:07,790 --> 02:22:09,690
(Their aggressive daily lives will be shown.)

2772
02:22:10,159 --> 02:22:12,200
(35 different styles)

2773
02:22:12,760 --> 02:22:15,200
(A therapeutic trip for the trainees)

2774
02:22:16,829 --> 02:22:20,170
(Something they couldn't say until now)

2775
02:22:20,969 --> 02:22:23,109
(I personally thought it was the last project for me.)

2776
02:22:23,110 --> 02:22:24,869
(I did my best.)

2777
02:22:24,870 --> 02:22:26,840
(I want to compete until the end.)

2778
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:29,879
(They're nearer to their dream of debuting.)

2779
02:22:30,780 --> 02:22:32,750
(Who will be the last trainee to advance to the finals?)

2780
02:22:33,920 --> 02:22:36,420
(PROJECT 7)
