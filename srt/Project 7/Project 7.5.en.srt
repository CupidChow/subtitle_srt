00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,060
are all eliminated.

183
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:37,699
I want to survive.

184
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,068
And the trainees' voting scores, after the first Passing Ceremony,

185
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:46,499
will be all reset.

186
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,769
- What? - Really?

187
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:52,310
Through the next project and the global voting,

188
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,779
your ranks can change anytime.

189
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,110
It's reset.

190
00:07:58,149 --> 00:08:01,220
And today, in addition to your pass or fail,

191
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:04,619
the World Assemblers' assembling results...

192
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,490
are revealed for the first time.

193
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,629
Do you see the assembling slot in front of you?

194
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,999
- Yes! - Yes!

195
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,399
Trainees assembled in the same slot after the final exams...

196
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:16,699
will perform together.

197
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:19,040
What? 14 people?

198
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:21,110
Did he say 14 people?

199
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,410
I'd like to take part in the project.

200
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:26,279
The slot located on the highest place...

201
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,079
is A1.

202
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,920
The slot located on the right...

203
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,679
is A2.

204
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,389
A3,

205
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,120
A4.

206
00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:40,190
The slot located on the bottom is A5.

207
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,829
Trainees will be called based on their ranks,

208
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,829
but you don't sit according to your ranks.

209
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:47,599
You're going to sit in the assembled slots.

210
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,570
(They will sit in the assembled slots.)

211
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:50,870
I wonder what will happen.

212
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,940
I'm really curious.

213
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,769
Well, from now on,

214
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,079
the first Passing Ceremony begins.

215
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,210
(The 1st Passing Ceremony)

216
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,378
Let's go.

217
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:02,209
I can do this.

218
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,409
Let's see what happens.

219
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,378
On the crossroads of pass and fail...

220
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:09,089
are trainees ranked 70th and 71st.

221
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,489
Their destinies were decided by a slight difference.

222
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,589
Goodness.

223
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:15,058
The trainee ranked at 70th...

224
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:16,860
who managed to pass,

225
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,259
will be announced...

226
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,129
last.

227
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,329
(70th, Trainee LEE YUJUN)

228
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,669
His name will be announced last.

229
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,569
His name will be announced last.

230
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:30,138
- That will be killing him. - It's giving false hope.

231
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:32,379
The one who's ranked at 71st would feel so sad.

232
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:37,109
I will now announce the trainees in 61st to 69th place.

233
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,350
Right away?

234
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,789
It's a close call for the group.

235
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:43,289
We can do this.

236
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,320
Please. I'm fine with 69th place.

237
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,888
Here are trainees who managed to survive the elimination crisis.

238
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:50,059
My goodness.

239
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:52,330
I will now announce the trainee in 69th place.

240
00:09:53,129 --> 00:09:54,768
Adjusting himself...

241
00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:56,229
to a new environment of PROJECT 7,

242
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,798
this trainee went through growing pains.

243
00:09:58,799 --> 00:09:59,899
Who could that be?

244
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,839
- Is it JUNWOO? - I don't want to go home.

245
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,880
(85th, Trainee KIM JUNWOO)

246
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:05,659
I should be in this group. Otherwise, there's no chance for me.

247
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:11,278
This trainee received a global voting score of 165,569 points.

248
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,778
The one ranked at 69th received 160,000 points?

249
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,549
How come the score is that high?

250
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,289
- It's 160,000? - It's 160,000?

251
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,559
That's a lot. 160,000 points.

252
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:21,279
(The 60th-place trainee is to be revealed.)

253
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:23,758
(69th place)

254
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:26,428
Trainee HOU GUANYI,

255
00:10:26,429 --> 00:10:27,600
congratulations.

256
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,969
Trainee HOU GUANYI's body and mind were exhausted...

257
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,569
as he practiced with 20 other people for the 1st time...

258
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:35,669
and as he had a hard time understanding Korean.

259
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:38,739
In the first Passing Ceremony, he managed to avoid elimination...

260
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,610
and continue to challenge one more time.

261
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:42,908
Congratulations.

262
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:44,120
I envy him.

263
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,249
Go for it.

264
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,449
(69th, Trainee HOU GUANYI)

265
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:50,649
Next, I will announce the trainee in 68th place.

266
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:52,720
My name needs to be called now.

267
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,520
He's a global trainee who came to Korea all the way...

268
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:58,899
to achieve his dream of becoming a K-idol.

269
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:00,398
He's a foreigner.

270
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,769
(93rd, Trainee MANABE JIN)

271
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,999
A global trainee?

272
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,099
- He must be from Thailand. - He's Thai.

273
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,740
This trainee received a global voting score of 168,327 points.

274
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:14,549
I think I have to stay, so I want to remain here.

275
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:16,450
It's Trainee AOM.

276
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,120
Congratulations.

277
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,480
- AOM. - AOM.

278
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,548
Trainee AOM has admired K-idols...

279
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:26,460
and he came from Thailand to achieve his dream.

280
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,359
Although his Korean needs to be improved,

281
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,799
he doesn't lose a smile and practices.

282
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:34,799
A chance comes to the one who works hard.

283
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:37,969
I will look forward to your performance in the next project.

284
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,799
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

285
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:46,509
I will now announce the trainee in 67th place.

286
00:11:46,909 --> 00:11:49,409
He's one of the trainees born in 2004.

287
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,648
He's born in 2004?

288
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:52,820
Is he born in 2004?

289
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,749
Weren't you born in 2004?

290
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,919
I was born in 2007.

291
00:11:56,889 --> 00:11:58,190
Born in 2004?

292
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:01,889
I heard this trainee was serious about working out.

293
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,758
It must be CHANYONG.

294
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:05,399
I guess it's CHANYONG.

295
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:07,969
(60th, Trainee LEE GUNWOO)

296
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,330
It could be me.

297
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:16,439
This trainee received a global voting score of 173,786 points.

298
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,809
(61st to 69th place)

299
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,778
It's Trainee PARK CHANYONG.

300
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:23,710
(67th, Trainee PARK CHANYONG)

301
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,219
- Congratulations. - I'm relieved.

302
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,379
You go there first.

303
00:12:27,889 --> 00:12:30,419
I'm relieved.

304
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:34,189
In the performance of Team "3D," Trainee PARK CHANYONG...

305
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:35,989
showed unbelievable arm muscles...

306
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:38,259
and solid performances,

307
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:41,029
and he was ranked at 67th place.

308
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,569
If Team "3D" didn't win the benefits,

309
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:47,169
the destinies of those who passed and failed would be changed.

310
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,638
It might have been dangerous without the benefit.

311
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,169
They could have been in big trouble.

312
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:52,378
Without the benefit, they might have been eliminated.

313
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:53,379
What?

314
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,508
Benefit.

315
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:56,509
Benefits are really important.

316
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:00,148
I would have been eliminated without the benefit.

317
00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:04,090
I will survive with a dogged spirit among the strong ones.

318
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:06,919
This is real survival.

319
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:11,000
I will now announce the trainee in 66th place.

320
00:13:11,059 --> 00:13:14,970
He's a trainee who tried rapping for the first time in Position Matching.

321
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:17,538
- It must be one in Team "SHALALA." - I know.

322
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:19,439
I think he's in Team "SHALALA."

323
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,870
- It's Team "SHALALA." - "SHALALA."

324
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,740
(He challenged the first rap performance with "SHALALA.")

325
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:27,309
(52nd, Trainee LEE JIHOON)

326
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,980
(82nd, Trainee TSUJII RYOMA)

327
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,349
First, it must be Team "SHALALA."

328
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,190
I'm sure it's Team "SHALALA" first.

329
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:39,888
This trainee received a global voting score of 175,254 points.

330
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:41,929
(82nd, TSUJII RYOMA, 52nd, LEE JIHOON)

331
00:13:43,429 --> 00:13:44,999
It's Trainee LEE JIHOON.

332
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,729
(66th, Trainee LEE JIHOON)

333
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:47,830
Congratulations.

334
00:13:49,669 --> 00:13:51,299
- Thank you. - This is how it begins.

335
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:55,408
Whenever Trainee LEE JIHOON was struggling...

336
00:13:55,409 --> 00:13:56,939
during the Title Song and Position Matching,

337
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,840
he wouldn't hesitate to approach others,

338
00:13:59,179 --> 00:14:02,950
asked for help, and showed the will to improve.

339
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,548
We'll look forward to seeing you improve even more going forward.

340
00:14:05,549 --> 00:14:06,579
Congratulations.

341
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,989
(LEE JIHOON, 66th place, 175,254 points)

342
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,710
(Korea vote score: 119,053 points, Global vote score: 56,201 points)

343
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:14,490
Next is the 65th-place trainee.

344
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:16,489
This trainee has a talent for choreography...

345
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:19,659
and is referred to as the dance teacher.

346
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:20,799
A talent for choreography?

347
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:22,429
KIM JIMIN.

348
00:14:22,669 --> 00:14:23,870
JIMIN?

349
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:25,269
WANGSEOK?

350
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:26,870
WANGSEOK.

351
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,409
What? No.

352
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:34,679
This trainee received 175,518 points.

353
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:37,278
- That's not so different. - Right.

354
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,320
It's almost the same.

355
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,190
Trainee KANG WANGSEOK.

356
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:44,919
Congratulations.

357
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,220
Amazing.

358
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:51,029
WANGSEOK.

359
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,199
Trainee KANG WANGSEOK...

360
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,069
was a team leader for the Position Matching.

361
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:57,168
- Let's go. - He stayed up every night...

362
00:14:57,169 --> 00:14:58,298
creating the choreography...

363
00:14:58,299 --> 00:15:00,799
and really showed his leadership.

364
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:05,109
We look forward to seeing your passion in the next project.

365
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,178
(KANG WANGSEOK, 65th place, 175,518 points)

366
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:09,509
I feel very lucky, and I should work even harder going forward.

367
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:14,490
(Congratulations, WANGSEOK.)

368
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,789
Next is the 64th-place trainee.

369
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:21,289

370
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,729
Trainee KIM JIMIN.

371
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,428
(64th place, Trainee KIM JIMIN)

372
00:15:25,429 --> 00:15:27,359
Yes.

373
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,470
Congratulations.

374
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:33,538
I was told Director Bada and Director RyuD...

375
00:15:33,539 --> 00:15:36,440
praised trainee KIM JIMIN's dancing.

376
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,750
I've been given another chance.

377
00:15:42,049 --> 00:15:44,419
I plan to do my best.

378
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:48,049
Next is the 63rd-place trainee.

379
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,750
With his language abilities,

380
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:54,830
he is the unofficial interpreter of PROJECT 7.

381
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:56,559
YUSEI?

382
00:15:56,929 --> 00:15:58,059
YUSEI?

383
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,360
- YUSEI? - YUSEI?

384
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,570
YUSEI?

385
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:03,330
- EUNSUH? - EUNSUH.

386
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,539
Who could it be?

387
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:07,139
Is it JINGLONG?

388
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,440
Is it JINGLONG?

389
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,370
- JINGLONG? - JINGLONG.

390
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,580
This trainee received 182,363 points.

391
00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:20,518
Trainee LEE EUNSUH.

392
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,389
- Congratulations. - Good job.

393
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:23,590
Thank you.

394
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,758
Trainee LEE EUNSUH. Congratulations.

395
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:28,029
Good job.

396
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:31,729
Trainee LEE EUNSUH helped...

397
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,898
his Position Matching team...

398
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:37,099
get first place with his stable pitch...

399
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,200
and received 20,000 benefit points.

400
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,610
If EUNSUH didn't have the benefit points,

401
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,680
- he could've been in trouble. - You're right.

402
00:16:44,309 --> 00:16:48,610
(LEE EUNSUH, 64th place, 182,363 points)

403
00:16:50,549 --> 00:16:52,820
Next is the 62nd-place trainee.

404
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,649
This trainee can even handle difficult dance techniques.

405
00:16:58,259 --> 00:16:59,360
HYEONSEUNG?

406
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,018
YOO HYEONSEUNG?

407
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:02,028
(71st place, YOO HYEONSEUNG, Week 2 ranking)

408
00:17:02,029 --> 00:17:03,830
Couldn't it also be TAESUNG?

409
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:05,259
It could be TAESUNG.

410
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,829
It could be.

411
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:11,068
I think it's DEUNHAESOL.

412
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:12,669
They received a global vote score...

413
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:17,210
of 184,172 points.

414
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,839
(Which trainee got 62nd place?)

415
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,009
Trainee JEONG DEUNHAESOL.

416
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,849
(62nd place, JEONG DEUNHAESOL)

417
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,220
Congratulations.

418
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,589
Good job.

419
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:32,389
You did it.

420
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:33,588
(JEONG DEUNHAESOL, 62nd place, 184,172 points)

421
00:17:33,589 --> 00:17:36,659
Trainee JEONG DEUNHAESOL played a role on Team "3D..."

422
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,900
for the Position Matching...

423
00:17:38,029 --> 00:17:40,629
and really made an impression...

424
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:41,930
on the World Assemblers.

425
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,569
Next is the 61st-place trainee.

426
00:17:47,069 --> 00:17:49,808
He shows great leadership among the trainees...

427
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:53,380
and really fits his nickname, captain.

428
00:17:54,109 --> 00:17:56,079
What? Me?

429
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,019
No.

430
00:17:58,319 --> 00:17:59,348
HEEDO?

431
00:17:59,349 --> 00:18:01,390
Oh, HEEDO?

432
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:03,288
It could be HEEDO.

433
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:04,689
(32th place, YOO HEEDO, Week 2 ranking)

434
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:05,759
His nickname is captain.

435
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,589
Is it TAEYU?

436
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,690
It's not me.

437
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,599
JOONWOO.

438
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,960
- JOONWOO. - He is the tallest.

439
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:19,970
They received a global vote score of 190,276 points.

440
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,509
Who could it be?

441
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,278
Trainee KIM JOONWOO.

442
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:26,839
(61st place, Trainee KIM JOONWOO)

443
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,380
- JOONWOO! - How impressive.

444
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:29,679
Oh, my.

445
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,379
(KIM JOONWOO, 61st place, 190,276 points)

446
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,149
Trainee KIM JOONWOO was part...

447
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,189
of a Taekwondo demonstration team until last year.

448
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,689
He's a new trainee who just started his journey...

449
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,490
to becoming an idol less than six months ago.

450
00:18:39,789 --> 00:18:41,189
By consistently proving...

451
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,588
that his skills aren't those of a newbie,

452
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:44,930
he got 61st place.

453
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:49,670
(The 61st to 69th-place trainees have all been announced.)

454
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:56,268
The 61st to 69th-place trainees who avoided elimination...

455
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:59,410
and got another chance,

456
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,579
please tell us how you feel.

457
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:06,979
First, I'm very happy that I was one of the 70 who passed this time.

458
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,288
I promise I'll go to even higher places...

459
00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:12,189
so everyone can continue to believe in me, AOM.

460
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,220
Thank you.

461
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,389
Thank you.

462
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,660
Good job.

463
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,329
To be honest, I was very worried before I came here today.

464
00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:24,099
Thank you so much for saving me from elimination.

465
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:25,499
(Sighing)

466
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,700
Oh, no. His hands are shaking.

467
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,839
Oh, no. His hands are shaking so much.

468
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:32,339
Oh, no.

469
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,410
Going forward,

470
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,549
I'll work even harder.

471
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:43,618
To be honest, I would've been in trouble...

472
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:45,518
without the benefit points.

473
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:47,219
I would like to thank...

474
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,930
Team "3D."

475
00:19:49,089 --> 00:19:50,589
I'll work even harder. Thank you.

476
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,229
- Good job. - Good job.

477
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,359
You made it happen.

478
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:59,768
Next, I will announce the combinations...

479
00:19:59,769 --> 00:20:02,038
that the World Assemblers chose.

480
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:04,439
(It's time to announce the teams the World Assemblers made.)

481
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,940
Oh, right.

482
00:20:07,579 --> 00:20:09,508
I'm so curious about the results.

483
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:11,379
- This is the important part. - Yes.

484
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,979
- This is really important. - I'm so curious about this.

485
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,118
How will they show it?

486
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:15,548
(The 1st Passing Ceremony)

487
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:17,848
This is all based on the Assembly Votes...

488
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:19,319
that the fans participated in.

489
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,660
I was most curious about this.

490
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,229
(Which combinations did the World Assemblers make?)

491
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,230
Let's see.

492
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,490
We need to see which team we'll end up with.

493
00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:28,068
Will they show the results for one person at a time?

494
00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:29,929
(Announcing the first assembly team for 61st to 69th place)

495
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:34,000
The slot 69th place, trainee HOU GUANYI, was placed in...

496
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:37,740
The slot trainee HOU GUANYI was placed in...

497
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:39,640
A2.

498
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,140
This is making me nervous.

499
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:44,008
He was assembled into A4.

500
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:46,449
(Trainee HOU GUANYI, 69th place, was assembled into Team A4.)

501
00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:51,690
- A4. - Please move to the A4 slot.

502
00:20:53,089 --> 00:20:54,390
Lucky four.

503
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:57,490
He's the first one to go up to the slots.

504
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:00,329
He's the first one to sit in those many chairs.

505
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:02,900
He's shining.

506
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:04,669
It looks quite high.

507
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:05,999
(One person has been assembled into Team A4.)

508
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,469
They didn't assemble all of the foreigners together, right?

509
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:09,509
I'm sure not.

510
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:13,480
Next, 68th place, trainee AOM,

511
00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:15,950
sixty-fifth place, trainee KANG WANGSEOK,

512
00:21:16,779 --> 00:21:20,119
and 64th place, trainee KIM JIMIN have been assembled...

513
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:22,288
Oh, my. All that once?

514
00:21:22,289 --> 00:21:23,589
Dancing kings.

515
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:26,618
They have been assembled into the A5 slot.

516
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,539
(The dancing kings were assembled into Team A5.)

517
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:33,200
- Weren't they all in "Closer?" - You're right.

518
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,930
I thought those two would be together.

519
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:39,269
I think the fans would've wanted them to be together.

520
00:21:40,339 --> 00:21:41,539
That might be a good team.

521
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:42,739
That team is strong.

522
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,710
Two people who can choreograph went to that team.

523
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,680
They will really dominate with their dancing.

524
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:52,180
Next, 67th place, trainee PARK CHANYONG...

525
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:54,219
was assembled into slot A3.

526
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,780
(Trainee PARK CHANYONG, 67th place, was assembled into Team A3.)

527
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,829
Please move to slot A3.

528
00:22:02,089 --> 00:22:03,359
It's the center.

529
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,799
I like the sound of A3. It kind of sounds like ace.

530
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:07,230
I like A3 too.

531
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:08,670
A3 does feel like the center.

532
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,298
I want to go up there too.

533
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:13,440
They're slowly running out of seats for us.

534
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,045
They're running out of seats. Oh, no.

535
00:22:15,069 --> 00:22:16,140
Oh, no.

536
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:20,140
Yes. The 66th place, trainee LEE JIHOON,

537
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,910
sixty-third place, trainee LEE EUNSUH,

538
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:25,680
and 61st place, trainee KIM JOONWOO.

539
00:22:25,849 --> 00:22:28,990
These three trainees were also assembled into the same slot.

540
00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:30,419
What combination is this?

541
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,559
What a strange combination.

542
00:22:31,619 --> 00:22:32,660
They're on the same team?

543
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:35,730
These three trainees have been assembled...

544
00:22:35,829 --> 00:22:37,230
into slot A5.

545
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,460
(Team A5)

546
00:22:38,461 --> 00:22:40,899
- What? - Come on.

547
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,700
- There are already 6. - There are already 6.

548
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,230
Half the seats are taken.

549
00:22:44,369 --> 00:22:48,369
Out of 14, 6 of us got lower ranks.

550
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,839
JOONWOO, WANGSEOK, and JIMIN are on the same team?

551
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,778
- Yes. - I can't imagine.

552
00:22:55,779 --> 00:22:57,549
Are they putting the dancers together?

553
00:22:57,779 --> 00:22:59,250
But EUNSUH is a vocalist.

554
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:02,789
A5 already has six trainees.

555
00:23:02,819 --> 00:23:06,088
Next, which team was 62nd place, trainee JEONG DEUNHAESOL,

556
00:23:06,089 --> 00:23:07,588
assembled into?

557
00:23:07,589 --> 00:23:09,089
- A1? - A1.

558
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:11,289
- A1. - A2.

559
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:14,359
Trainee JEONG DEUNHAESOL was assembled...

560
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,599
into slot A4.

561
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,000
Oh, my.

562
00:23:18,369 --> 00:23:19,469
HOU GUANYI.

563
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,740
HOU GUANYI.

564
00:23:21,569 --> 00:23:23,470
It must be dangerous to sit in that section.

565
00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:24,569
What do you mean by that?

566
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:26,579
Both of their heads are so small.

567
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,239
You'll be on camera with them.

568
00:23:28,609 --> 00:23:29,808
What order is this?

569
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:32,318
I'm curious what the team numbers mean.

570
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:33,518
Right. I'm so curious right now.

571
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:34,919
What do the numbers mean?

572
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,240
(The 61st to 69th place trainees have all been assembled.)

573
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,230
Next, I'll announce the 60th place to the 51st place.

574
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,029
(The 1st Passing Ceremony, 51st place to 60th place)

575
00:23:48,099 --> 00:23:49,130
Oh, my gosh.

576
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:55,139
HYEONSEUNG. Let's not worry too much.

577
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,639
(71st place, YOO HYEONGSEUNG, Week 2 ranking)

578
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,380
They could be slightly disappointing rankings,

579
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:01,809
but there are many hidden gems...

580
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,509
in this group.

581
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:06,849
- I didn't get much attention. - It's you.

582
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,650
Please.

583
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,660
Please.

584
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,959
If I'm not in this group, I'll head home first.

585
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,299
Don't say that.

586
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:21,899
- Don't say that. - If I'm not in this group.

587
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,069
Don't say that.

588
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,769
Here is the 60th-place trainee.

589
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:28,470
My last ranking was 60th.

590
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,409
They received a global vote score...

591
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:35,480
- of 193,079 points. - They got a lot.

592
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:38,719
Trainee IM SIU.

593
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,818
(60th place, Trainee IM SIU)

594
00:24:40,819 --> 00:24:41,990
Congratulations.

595
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:47,190
- Oh, my. - Oh, my. SIU.

596
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,190
Oh, my.

597
00:24:50,259 --> 00:24:52,400
Yes, P2!

598
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,400
Oh, my.

599
00:24:56,029 --> 00:24:57,099
SIU.

600
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:02,170
Trainee IM SIU...

601
00:25:02,269 --> 00:25:03,768
was the oldest member of Team "Closer..."

602
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:05,240
for the Position Matching.

603
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,639
He's receiving attention from the World Assemblers...

604
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,410
with his pure and youthful look.

605
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:15,450
- Yes! - SIU!

606
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,420
Next is the 59th-place trainee.

607
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:20,859
This trainee truly loves fashion...

608
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:24,899
and is called the fashionista of PROJECT 7.

609
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,060
- Fashionista? - Fashionista?

610
00:25:30,099 --> 00:25:31,700
Who is the fashionista?

611
00:25:32,369 --> 00:25:34,768
Is it SEOKHEE? It's SEOKHEE.

612
00:25:34,769 --> 00:25:36,539
- Me? - Is it you?

613
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,779
YOONSUE?

614
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,308
- It's not me. - You are a fashionista.

615
00:25:40,309 --> 00:25:41,656
I never dressed up while I was here.

616
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,910
A fashionista?

617
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,719
They received a global vote score...

618
00:25:44,849 --> 00:25:48,750
of 195,075 points.

619
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,258
OBAYASHI YUSEI.

620
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,929
(59th place, Trainee OBAYASHI YUSEI)

621
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,258
- YUSEI! Congratulations! - Congratulations.

622
00:25:57,259 --> 00:25:58,259
(OBAYASHI YUSEI, 59th place, 195,075 points)

623
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,599
YUSEI!

624
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,969
YUSEI!

625
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:05,368
- His ranking went up a lot. - You say

626
00:26:05,369 --> 00:26:07,269
I'm crazy

627
00:26:07,569 --> 00:26:10,038
How did he behave here? So many people like him.

628
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:12,740
Seriously. He always exercised with me.

629
00:26:15,509 --> 00:26:17,079
I feel relieved.

630
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:22,119
Because the rap team comes first.

631
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,420
- No. - Since last week.

632
00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:28,959
They all saw your singing abilities,

633
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,230
so it's okay. Don't worry.

634
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,900
Next is the 58th-place trainee.

635
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,799
This trainee used to be an athlete in the past.

636
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,769
TAESUNG.

637
00:26:41,069 --> 00:26:42,170
Who is it?

638
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,739
Oh, an athlete.

639
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,979
It's not me.

640
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,686
Don't give that title to me. Give it to JUYOUNG.

641
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:49,380
There aren't many people here who used to be athletes.

642
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:51,549
It's either TAESUNG or JUYOUNG.

643
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,789
- Isn't it HYOJIN? - Was HYOJIN an athlete?

644
00:26:56,819 --> 00:26:58,819
Didn't HYOJIN study physical education in college?

645
00:27:00,089 --> 00:27:01,629
- I did too. - He did.

646
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:03,329
- He was a total veteran. - What about me?

647
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:05,990
- What sport did you do? - I got a brown belt in Taekwondo.

648
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,230
A brown belt?

649
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:12,940
They received a global vote score of 197,191 points.

650
00:27:13,069 --> 00:27:14,240
I'll see you up there.

651
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:18,169
- Trainee CHO HYOJIN. - HYOJIN.

652
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,409
(58th place, Trainee CHO HYOJIN)

653
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:21,079
- Trainee CHO HYOJIN. - See? I was right.

654
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,180
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

655
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,249
- HYOJIN. - Congratulations, HYOJIN.

656
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,119
Congratulations.

657
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,619
You're even higher, then.

658
00:27:33,859 --> 00:27:35,339
- That means you're higher. - No way.

659
00:27:35,859 --> 00:27:38,399
Trainee CHO HYOJIN is a fan of ONF,

660
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,999
so he chose Team "We Must Love..."

661
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,670
for the Position Matching without hesitation.

662
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,799
HYOJIN deserves to go up.

663
00:27:46,569 --> 00:27:48,940
With his stable and strong high notes,

664
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:51,880
he attacked the hearts of the World Assemblers.

665
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:57,180
I'm jealous.

666
00:28:00,579 --> 00:28:04,048
Next is the 57th-place trainee.

00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:05,118
(Announcing the 57th-place trainee)

668
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:06,719
This trainee looks put-together,

669
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,490
but they surprisingly have a clumsy side to them.

670
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:11,088
- It could be you. - It's not me.

671
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:12,130
I'll get ready.

672
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:13,629
Is it me?

673
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:15,146
(58th place, KIM TAEYU, Week 2 ranking)

674
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:16,598
- Isn't it you? - Right?

675
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:18,099
I just thought of myself too.

676
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:19,470
Seriously.

Congratulations!

684
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:44,288
Trainee JUNG SEUNGWON hasn't been training for so long,

685
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:47,199
so he has struggled, talent-wise, in every project.

686
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,598
But seeing him work himself to the bone...

687
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:52,369
moved the hearts of the World Assemblers.

688
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:55,639
SEUNGWON! You did it, SEUNGWON!

689
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,839
Congratulations.

Next is the 56th-place trainee.

692
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:09,719
This trainee is getting attention for his dancing skills...

693
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,789
despite his young age.

694
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:13,490
Is it JINWON?

695
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,690
Is it JINWON?

696
00:29:15,789 --> 00:29:17,258
- Is it JINWON? - Is it JINWON?

Trainee KANG JIMIN is a shy trainee who is one of the youngest here.

713
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,700
He's a young trainee who was born in 2008,

714
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:56,529
but at practice, he doesn't shy away from teaching older trainees.

715
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:00,200

720
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:20,259
to become an idol for the first time through PROJECT 7.

721
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:23,588
Why does that all sound like that?

722
00:30:23,589 --> 00:30:24,890
Seriously.

723
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:26,630
It is about time.

724
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:28,500

734
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,528
Were you in P3?

735
00:30:56,529 --> 00:30:58,700
No, "Don't Go."

736
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:00,829
Oh, my JIHO.

00:31:11,309 --> 00:31:12,839
you have to become an idol.

741
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:15,509

No matter what situation,

746
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:25,819
this trainee is always talking.

747
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:27,220
Who is that?

748
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:30,190
- He talks too much. - SEOKHEE?

749
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:32,799

calls himself a baby rockstar.

767
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:16,740
He often enjoyed gathering the trainees and busking.

768
00:32:17,309 --> 00:32:19,940
With his strong and charming voice,

769
00:32:20,109 --> 00:32:23,608
he successfully moved the hearts of the World Assemblers.

770
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:25,926

with his swag and confidence...

789
00:33:05,019 --> 00:33:06,318
and played a key role in leading Team "Crayon..."

790
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:07,619
to get first place.

791
00:33:08,059 --> 00:33:11,960
He captured the hearts of the World Assemblers with his strong rapping.

793
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,368
He was a new trainee,

794
00:33:20,369 --> 00:33:22,809
but he's improving very quickly right now.

795
00:33:22,869 --> 00:33:27,278

796
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,078
This is you.

797

- This is you. - I haven't improved yet.

798
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:33,079
- Isn't it GUNWOO? - No.

799
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:35,025
- You're a new trainee. - GUNWOO doesn't have a pure smile.

800
00:33:35,049 --> 00:33:36,690
No, GUNWOO is pure.

- Nice. - Nice.

809
00:33:52,869 --> 00:33:56,439
Trainee CHOI JUYOUNG is a former baseball captain...

810
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,170
who's full of energy and was born in 2009.

811
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:00,508
But he struggled to command his body while dancing.

812
00:34:00,509 --> 00:34:02,480
So the older trainees kept a close eye on him.

813
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,318
Money, make purse

814
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:12,789
(The older trainees on Team "WORK" closely watched him.)

815
00:34:13,059 --> 00:34:14,119
- Gosh. - It's okay.

816
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,129
Thanks to their help, he showed great improvement.

817
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:20,800
And the World Assemblers are rooting for him.

818
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:26,039
I will now announce the trainee in 51st place.

819
00:34:28,809 --> 00:34:31,449
I really have to be one of them. I'll have a shot at staying then.

820
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:34,639
This trainee has a steady vocal tone.

821
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:37,650
Is it LEE HANBIN?

822
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:39,619
Is it me?

823
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,289
- I wouldn't say it's steady. - Come on.

824
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:44,349
Is that so?

825
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,988
Please.

826
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:49,489
(KIM DOHUN and OH TAEHWAN are also vocalists.)

827
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,989
I think it's you.

828
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,400
- Gosh. - Tie your shoelaces first.

829
00:34:54,329 --> 00:34:55,699
No, I'll be going home.

830
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:57,000
You won't.

842
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:29,359
I really hope he doesn't cry.

843
00:35:30,369 --> 00:35:31,500
No!

844
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:34,099
- No. Congratulations. - He's...

845
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,510
(From 51st to 60th places)

846
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:41,039
I'm not going home.

847
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:47,979
CHENYU said this to EUNSUH in last week's episode.

848
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,689
"We're not dating."

849
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:50,930
(He left behind a famous line.)

850
00:35:52,659 --> 00:35:54,119
(We're not dating.)

851
00:35:54,219 --> 00:35:55,730
We're not in a relationship.

852
00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:01,099
(There was a lovers' quarrel in the middle of their practice.)

853
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,670
Trainee KANG JIMIN.

854
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:08,198
Trainee YICHEN shouted at you and said, "Get out!"

855
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:09,539
Say something to YICHEN.

856
00:36:09,769 --> 00:36:11,409
If you're going to keep that up, get out.

857
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:15,178
- Okay. I'll get out then. - No.

858
00:36:15,179 --> 00:36:16,849
To be honest,

859
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,550
I didn't want to do it because of YICHEN.

860
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:22,250
I didn't want to do it.

861
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:31,328
- That's straight up hip-hop! - Oh, my gosh.

862
00:36:31,329 --> 00:36:32,359
That's straight up hip-hop!

863
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,530
- Oh, my! - That was harsh.

864
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:35,879
- There he is. - That's so cool.

865
00:36:35,929 --> 00:36:37,029
You should apologize to him.

866
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:38,329
Apologize to him.

867
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,239
But I watched the episode.

868
00:36:41,269 --> 00:36:43,510
Thank you for getting me a lot of airtime.

869
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:49,830
- Airtime? - He thanked YICHEN for airtime.

870
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,760
- You're indeed a leader. - He's a true leader.

871
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,848
- He thanked me for airtime? - That's...

872
00:36:53,849 --> 00:36:54,849
That was funny.

873
00:36:55,019 --> 00:36:56,888
I will now announce the assembling results...

886
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:37,059
and Trainee WU CHENYU.

887
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,360
- What? - What's going on?

888
00:37:40,699 --> 00:37:42,099
They're all going to join one slot?

889
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:44,929
The six trainees were assembled to join...

890
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:48,038
- If they come here, we're full. No. - Our group will be full then.

891
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:49,170
No way.

892
00:37:49,469 --> 00:37:50,809
A5.

893
00:37:52,309 --> 00:37:53,408
What's happening in A5?

894
00:37:53,409 --> 00:37:54,678
- Hey. - Hold on.

895
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:55,679
Stop looking at us.

896
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,349
- Hello. - Really?

897
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:00,218
- It's full. - It's full, right?

898
00:38:00,219 --> 00:38:01,750
- Is it full? - It's full.

899
00:38:02,289 --> 00:38:03,289
It's fine.

900
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:04,988
- Hello. - Hello.

901
00:38:04,989 --> 00:38:06,420
(Half of A5 is already filled.)

902
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:10,359
Trainee BAEK JIHO was assembled to join...

903
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,360
(55th, Trainee BAEK JIHO)

904
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:13,130
It's A1.

905
00:38:17,769 --> 00:38:20,499
Trainee KIM TAEYU in 53rd place...

906
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,408
and Trainee CHOI JUYOUNG in 52nd place...

907
00:38:22,409 --> 00:38:24,269
were assembled to join the same slot.

908
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:29,409
Trainees TAEYU and JUYOUNG were assembled to join...

909
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:31,308
A4.

910
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,719
(The 2 of them are placed in A4.)

911
00:38:36,449 --> 00:38:37,449
Nice.

912
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,530
I will continue announcing the next rankings.

913
00:38:44,829 --> 00:38:48,799
But before that, there's a video the World Assemblers...

914
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,030
and the trainees must watch.

915
00:38:51,969 --> 00:38:54,300
I wonder what video we will be watching.

916
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,169
Let's watch it now.

917
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:59,280
(It will be revealed now.)

918
00:39:03,349 --> 00:39:04,409
What are we going to do?

919
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,150
I guess we'll be evaluated.

920
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:07,348
I bet the directors are here.

921
00:39:07,349 --> 00:39:08,796
(They can never predict what will happen at the dorm.)

922
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,019
What's going to be in there?

923
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:12,659
Will it be a snack party? With a lot of chips?

924
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,460
What is it?

925
00:39:15,461 --> 00:39:17,659
(What awaits the trainees?)

926
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,059
What is it?

927
00:39:20,699 --> 00:39:21,760
A karaoke machine?

928
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:26,170
(Project Village Karaoke is open!)

929
00:39:26,699 --> 00:39:28,899
- What do you think you'll do? - A singing competition.

930
00:39:28,969 --> 00:39:30,369
- A score battle. - A score battle.

931
00:39:30,539 --> 00:39:32,269
(They catch on fast.)

932
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,416
(Compete to be the best karaoke team between vocalists and rappers!)

933
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,979
The judges will be the cameramen...

934
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,479
- who are working hard right now. - It will be the staff.

935
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,719
- I see. - The staff!

936
00:39:40,349 --> 00:39:41,380
Okay.

937
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:44,488
The team with the best karaoke vocalist...

938
00:39:44,489 --> 00:39:45,489
(What's the benefit?)

939
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,158
will get an unlimited pass at the convenience store.

940
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:49,690
(The benefit is an unlimited pass at the convenience store.)

941
00:39:52,389 --> 00:39:54,659
You have to kill it.

942
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:57,129
We're rappers. What are we going to do?

943
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:59,469
- I can sing. Yes. - Can you? Okay.

944
00:39:59,539 --> 00:40:01,369
- I can sing a ballad song. - A ballad song?

945
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,739
Should I just rap?

946
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,369
Should I just rap?

947
00:40:06,809 --> 00:40:07,879
Show them.

948
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,939
(Team Vocalists will go first with a rap song.)

949
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,479
Yes. Okay. Let's go!

950
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,010
("Dang Dang Dang" by KANG HYUNWOO)

951
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:14,450
- Throw your elbows up - Throw your elbows up

952
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,989
He's hyping everyone up.

953
00:40:23,489 --> 00:40:25,328
(There's a fire, but when we show up)

954
00:40:25,329 --> 00:40:27,099
(No need to call 911)

955
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:32,598
(Men act indifferent)

956
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:34,968
(But they put their arms around my shoulders before they know it)

957
00:40:34,969 --> 00:40:36,408
(When our eyes meet)

958
00:40:36,409 --> 00:40:38,690
(Our nervousness goes away, and everyone gets along well)

959
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,309
(Trainee KIM SIHUN joins too.)

960
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:49,989
(KIM SIHUN is so fly!)

961
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:53,558
(Getting excited)

962
00:40:53,559 --> 00:40:54,860
Why is he so good?

963
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,389
That's pretty cool.

964
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:05,000
It looks like we'll easily be able to hit up the store.

965
00:41:05,699 --> 00:41:06,939
They're quiet.

966
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,546
(Are they suddenly provoking the other team?)

967
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:10,010
Well, how should I put it?

968
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:13,330
I can see where they're from. But they were on a break for too long.

969
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:17,649
Well, they were good at acting cool.

970
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:18,749
But that was all there was to it.

971
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:19,849
(The 2nd attack)

972
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:21,279
But that was all there was to it.

973
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,949
(They're harshly evaluated after one performance.)

974
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,389
There was no foundation.

975
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,089
Okay!

976
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:29,689
(The next trainee will show off his foundation as a rapper.)

977
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:31,360
(Who is the trainee?)

978
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:33,400
Team Vocalists rapped.

979
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:36,230
It was too boring. So I'll perform one myself.

980
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:39,339
It was too boring.

981
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,138
(Today's lesson: What goes around comes around.)

982
00:41:41,139 --> 00:41:43,539
- Go, YECHAN! - He's 17 years old.

983
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:44,670
He was born in 2008.

984
00:41:45,309 --> 00:41:47,239
("One of a Kind" by YEOM YECHAN)

985
00:41:49,949 --> 00:41:53,149
(I rush out after a call, the number is 1988 0818)

986
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:55,618
(Come on, somebody stop me, I'm the top news in the showbiz)

987
00:41:55,619 --> 00:41:58,288
(I'm different, that's who I am, everything I do becomes hip)

988
00:41:58,289 --> 00:42:01,690
(I set and change trends, so I'm never out of touch)

989
00:42:04,059 --> 00:42:08,760
(Trainees YOO HEEDO and KIM TAEYU perform next.)

990
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,400
(Right here)

991
00:42:15,401 --> 00:42:18,069
(Is the wild west)

992
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:19,070
Thank you.

993
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:24,909
They were so good. They didn't mess up. It was great.

994
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:26,848
(Disappointed)

995
00:42:26,849 --> 00:42:28,480
We're in P2 together.

996
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:30,349
But your song selection was too boring.

997
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:32,759
- Everyone picks those songs. - Right.

998
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,360
Those are the songs people always choose on competition shows.

999
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:38,319
We were worried you wouldn't be able to sing if we sang a ballad song.

1000
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:39,929
We were worried.

1001
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,429
Will they show us?

1002
00:42:43,329 --> 00:42:44,499
All right then.

1003
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,069
(Here's the vocalist of Team Rappers.)

1004
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:47,269
I'll go for it!

1005
00:42:49,469 --> 00:42:50,509
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1006
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:51,510
- SHIN JAEWON! - There he goes.

1007
00:42:51,511 --> 00:42:52,639
JAEWON!

("Every Day, Every Moment" by YICHEN)

1009
00:42:59,719 --> 00:43:01,320
YICHEN is the best!

1010
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:05,050
(The thought of that makes me cry)

1011
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:08,420
YICHEN is handsome and the best!

(He's got our respect with this!)

1017
00:43:36,389 --> 00:43:37,449
- My gosh. - Hey!

1018
00:43:37,849 --> 00:43:39,019
He deserves 100 points.

1019
00:43:40,059 --> 00:43:42,259
- You killed it. - Nice.

1020
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:44,489
- Gosh, you're great. - You're amazing.

1021

Who can sing ballad songs?

1023
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,899
We have to show them what's up.

1024
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,598
How about Captain of Team Vocalists?

1025
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:53,369
JUNWON?

1026
00:43:53,739 --> 00:43:56,139
- It's too early for me to sing. - I see.

1027
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:59,909
(It translates to, "I'll sing last.")

1028
00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:02,238
- Not yet. - The battle isn't at its peak.

1029
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:04,009
- I'll perform at its peak. - Okay.

1030
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:06,130
- Is there a really good vocalist? - One last song...

(Glancing)

1060
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,860
(Trainee CHOI JUYOUNG keeps glancing at other trainees.)

1061
00:46:28,019 --> 00:46:30,289
JUYOUNG, do you not go to coin karaoke?

1062
00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:32,559
I don't have many friends.

1063
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:34,459
I don't have many friends.

1064
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:38,768
(Flustered by his honest answer)

1065
00:46:38,769 --> 00:46:39,969
He's cute.

1066
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,309
I don't get an allowance.

1067
00:46:44,139 --> 00:46:45,610
He's 16.

1068
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:47,909
- The youngest is going to sing! - My gosh.

1069
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,109
- Go! - Oh, my. What's going on?

1070
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:51,409
- Let's go. - Go!

1071
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:52,910
These guys are practically babies.

1072
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:55,849
- I wonder what they'll sing. - If you...

1073
00:46:55,949 --> 00:46:58,320
("Siren")

1074
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:10,829
(We were worried about you, our dear youngest.)

1075
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,776
(He showcases a crazy control over the beats with his steps.)

1076
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,368
(It's hard to believe that this is his first time...)

1077
00:47:17,369 --> 00:47:18,929
(as it seems he knows what he's doing.)

1078
00:47:19,639 --> 00:47:20,940
What's this?

1079
00:47:21,309 --> 00:47:22,510
What?

1080
00:47:27,179 --> 00:47:28,650
- What is this? - What?

1081
00:47:34,489 --> 00:47:35,659
What?

1082
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:39,860
- Look at his legs. - His legs!

1083
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:44,098
(As his fellow trainees show him enormous respect...)

1084
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:45,530
Gosh, come on.

1085
00:47:57,010 --> 00:48:02,019
(He's getting a taste of a trot song after a rap song.)

1086
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,550
I'll go to karaoke often now.

1087
00:48:06,019 --> 00:48:07,260
You must be having a blast.

1088
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:09,829
You seem so happy right now.

1089
00:48:09,889 --> 00:48:12,190
- He's so adorable. - I'm so happy.

1090
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,999
- Gosh, you've got our respect. - Totally!

1091
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,299
- Well done. - Gosh, you've got our respect.

1092
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:18,300
All right. Do I have to save my team then?

1093
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,738
(The captain of Team Vocalists finally participates.)

1094
00:48:23,739 --> 00:48:26,020
JUNWON has to perform given the atmosphere we are in now.

1095
00:48:27,539 --> 00:48:29,809
It's hard to feed these little birds.

1096
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:31,679
Okay!

1097
00:48:34,849 --> 00:48:37,089
- Let's go! - He's doing it.

1098
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:38,210
("Confession" by AHN JUNWON)

1099
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:41,819

1100
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:42,820
(Turning sharply)

1101
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:53,599
My gosh. I like it, though.

1102
00:49:07,949 --> 00:49:09,449
That's so outdated.

1103
00:49:09,849 --> 00:49:11,050
That's ancient history.

1104
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:15,960
(His gesture keeps drawing attention.)

1105
00:49:17,789 --> 00:49:19,590
He's targeting one camera operator at a time.

1106
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:25,769
(Sir, here I am.)

1108
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,509
Film me, please.

1109
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:32,469
(A sense of urgency)

1110
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:33,840

1113
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:46,519
Look at that.

1114
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:51,190
There he goes.

1115
00:50:09,309 --> 00:50:11,078
(The captain completes his mission.)

1116
00:50:11,079 --> 00:50:13,880
Go, JUNWON!

1117
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,279
- My gosh. - His singing was good.

1118
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,348
- Goodness. - This isn't a singing competition!

1119
00:50:17,349 --> 00:50:18,989
- It's a comedy competition. - Seriously.

1120
00:50:19,219 --> 00:50:21,019
- I took it seriously. - This is...

1121
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,259
(And there's another trainee who's serious about this battle.)

1122
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:25,630
Let's get it, TAEYU.

1123
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:27,929
I'm better.

1124
00:50:29,429 --> 00:50:31,598
- Singing... - He's talking too much.

1125
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:33,199
Isn't about techniques.

1126
00:50:33,469 --> 00:50:35,538
- It must come from the heart. - Okay. Sing first!

1127
00:50:35,539 --> 00:50:36,710
- Sing it. - Sing first.

00:50:40,739 --> 00:50:43,448

00:50:43,449 --> 00:50:44,650
This is a great one.

1131
00:50:45,079 --> 00:50:47,019
As my attempt to give you a great performance,

1132
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,049
I'll be singing this particular song.

1133
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:50,219
Let's go!

1134
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:01,530
- Hey! - My gosh.

1135
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:04,929
- He's good. - Nice.

1136
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:12,368
- I pour - Yes!

1137
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:13,909
- You pour one too - Pour one too

1138
00:51:16,110 --> 00:51:17,650

- He's great. - Gosh, that's good.

1145
00:51:48,909 --> 00:51:51,110
(the intense battle between the two teams is over.)

1146
00:51:51,579 --> 00:51:53,448
It's time for the evaluation.

1147
00:51:53,449 --> 00:51:54,579
- Yes. - Yes.

1148
00:51:54,719 --> 00:51:57,050
We have 12 camera operators.

1149
00:51:57,690 --> 00:51:59,018
Let's vote by a show of hands.

1150
00:51:59,019 --> 00:52:00,190
Thank you for your hard work.

1155

Raise your hands if you want to vote for Team Rappers.

1156
00:52:09,699 --> 00:52:11,179
(How will the camera operators vote?)

1157
00:52:15,369 --> 00:52:17,940
- Please keep raising your hands. - Yes!

1158
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:19,170
Please raise your hands!

1159
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,280
- They got 6 votes. - They got 6 votes.

1160
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:26,549
Hold on.

1161
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:29,420
(Will they be tied with the score of 6 to 6?)

1162
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:33,218
(The last camera operator joins, so the score becomes 7 to 5.)

1163
00:52:33,219 --> 00:52:34,589
- She raised her hand too. - Okay.

- Yes! - Yes!

1166

- Great. - Nice job.

1167
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:47,469
(Disappointed)

1168
00:52:47,969 --> 00:52:51,969
(Well, there's nothing they can do to fix.)

1169
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,280
(They forget about their practice for a while.)

1170

for the convenience store, right?

1174
00:53:10,789 --> 00:53:13,300
You can grab as much as you can with your hands.

1175
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,599
Go.

1176
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,198
(Their shopping spree at the convenience store begins.)

1177
00:53:16,199 --> 00:53:18,969
- Let's go. - Okay.

1178
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:21,198
- We're emptying it out. - What?

1179
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:22,500
Let's take everything.

1180
00:53:24,039 --> 00:53:25,138
No.

1181
00:53:25,139 --> 00:53:27,155
(Team Rappers also get a chance to empty out the store.)

1182
00:53:27,179 --> 00:53:28,638
Just give me anything.

1183
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:30,480
- Something from the bottom. - The beverages.

1184
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:33,480
Hey, just take everything out. We'll pick them up.

- Hey. Hurry up. - Take it.

00:53:40,989 --> 00:53:42,190
Help!

00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:44,230
Help!

1191
00:53:44,659 --> 00:53:46,379

(A hidden gift for the winning team)

1196
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,538
We needed sun cream too. I'd like some sun cream.

1197
00:53:58,539 --> 00:54:00,809
(The chance to use the makeup vending machine)

1198
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:02,940
I want that.

1199
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:04,579
(Impressed)

1200
00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:10,448
- A sun cream. - Who wants to try it?

1201
00:54:10,449 --> 00:54:11,988
I'm a guy with sensitive skin.

1202
00:54:11,989 --> 00:54:14,489
I tried this, and it's not sticky at all.

1203
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:15,820
It's very moisturizing.

1204
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:19,230
My skin was really dry.

1205
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:23,900
Who wants to try it?

1206
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:25,198
(Let's have the second grader SEYUN try it.)

1207
00:54:25,199 --> 00:54:27,639
- How handsome. - So pretty.

1208
00:54:30,869 --> 00:54:32,639
We tried the lip product.

1209
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:35,039
- What do you guys think? - Do we look good?

1210
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:37,650
- So pretty. - So handsome.

1211
00:54:37,949 --> 00:54:41,079
Now, kiss.

1212
00:54:42,719 --> 00:54:44,550
Let's move on.

1213
00:54:45,519 --> 00:54:46,549
(Shall we have some snacks now?)

1214
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:48,619
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you.

1215
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:50,959
I only have one.

1216
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,135
(His body responds to the taste.)

1217
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:54,699
- Cute. - That's so cute.

1218
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:56,260
That's cute, KENSHIN.

1219
00:54:56,829 --> 00:55:00,940
(Team Rappers enjoys their snacks too.)

1220
00:55:01,639 --> 00:55:03,409
It tastes like cheeseburger.

1221
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:05,570
This is like paradise.

1222
00:55:07,110 --> 00:55:08,179
Paradise!

1223
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:10,409
(Thank you for the food.)

1224
00:55:10,809 --> 00:55:13,819
This rank has a lot of trainees...

1225
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:16,256
who received an advantage from the previous position matching.

1226
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:17,289
That's not me.

1227
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:19,190
- Oh, no. - Could it be Team "3D?"

1228
00:55:20,019 --> 00:55:21,558
Since they had an advantage,

1229
00:55:21,559 --> 00:55:24,530
we can say they are skilled trainees.

1230
00:55:25,059 --> 00:55:29,400
Let me announce the trainees from the 50th to the 41st ranks.

1231
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,599
(YEOM YECHAN)

1232
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:35,070

He's one of the trainees...

1236
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:44,179
who looked perfect in his suit during Position Matching.

1237
00:55:44,349 --> 00:55:45,409
- Suit? - A suit?

1238
00:55:45,679 --> 00:55:46,780
It's Team "Kiwi."

1239
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:48,578
- It must be Team "Kiwi." - A suit.

1240
00:55:48,579 --> 00:55:49,750
This trainee received...

1241
00:55:49,849 --> 00:55:53,789

1245
00:56:01,929 --> 00:56:03,630

00:56:26,289 --> 00:56:28,719
rap-making and writing his own raps.

1255

LYNNLYNN!

1284
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,030
All right.

1285
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:48,069
Unlike LYNNLYNN's silent personality,

1286
00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:51,110
he shows surprising and powerful moves on stage.

1287
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:54,238
He has made an impact as a talented dancer...

1288
00:57:54,239 --> 00:57:56,039
to the World Assemblers.

Next is the 47th-place trainee.

1291
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:10,360

1296
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:20,198
He needs to get that rank.

GUNWOO!

1305
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:47,899
LEE GUNWOO was the center position of Team "Crayon..."

1306
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:49,558
and made a big contribution to his team's win,

1307
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:51,869
receiving up to 20,000 points as a benefit.

1308
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:59,210
(LEE GUNWOO, 47th place, 266,909 points)

1309
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:01,570
That's a big jump. He used to be in the 60th rank.

1310
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:03,520
He rose a lot even without the advantage.

1311
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:05,179

1366

but he tries his best...

1367
01:01:33,059 --> 01:01:36,500
and has given off a good energy to the World Assemblers.

1368

1405
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:19,030
(42nd place, Trainee OK CHANGHYEON)

1406
01:03:20,369 --> 01:03:21,369
Nice.

1407
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:23,039
All right.

1408
01:03:23,639 --> 01:03:26,638
OK CHANGHYEON is known for his eyes,

1409
01:03:26,639 --> 01:03:28,756
and receives a lot of comments that he has a nice smile.

1410
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:32,679
We hope you show us more of your smile in the next project.

1411
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:35,679
Next is the 41st-place trainee.

1412
01:03:36,349 --> 01:03:39,419
He's 1 of the 5 most talkative trainees...

1413
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:41,059
in PROJECT 7.

1414
01:03:41,659 --> 01:03:42,789
Talkative?

1415
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:44,690
That's you.

1416
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:46,989
Who else is talkative?

1417
01:03:47,090 --> 01:03:48,500
- He could mean you. - I agree.

1418
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,030
- Is it SEOKHEE? - He said the five most talkative.

1419
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:53,869
It could be JUNWON.

1420
01:03:54,639 --> 01:03:56,139
Who could it be?

1421
01:03:57,210 --> 01:03:59,570
- It's ADAM. - ADAM!

1422
01:03:59,769 --> 01:04:01,078
This trainee received...

1423
01:04:01,079 --> 01:04:06,179
a global voting score of 317,953 points.

1424
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:08,178
(The 1st Passing Ceremony, 41st place to 50th place)

1425
01:04:08,179 --> 01:04:10,820
Congratulations, Trainee HA SEOKHEE.

1426
01:04:12,289 --> 01:04:14,860
Congratulations, Trainee HA SEOKHEE.

1427
01:04:15,789 --> 01:04:17,090
Is he the most talkative?

1428
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:24,129
HA SEOKHEE stands out wherever he is,

1429
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:26,206
and though he finds himself in the middle of conflict...

1430
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:27,500
The middle of conflict.

1431
01:04:29,469 --> 01:04:31,440
(Are you serious?)

1432
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:34,639
but his easygoing and humble personality...

1433
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:37,980
has received love from the World Assemblers.

1434
01:04:39,409 --> 01:04:41,849
Hello, I'm the one who froze all of P2,

1435
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:44,420
and I am Elsa SONG HYUNGSEOK.

1436
01:04:45,489 --> 01:04:46,849
Let it go.

1437
01:04:47,190 --> 01:04:49,359
I will improve myself, so I can be known...

1438
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:53,058
for my skills and not just my catchphrase "let it go."

1439
01:04:53,059 --> 01:04:56,260
It's an honor to be in the five most talkative trainees.

1440
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:59,468
I'd like to thank P3 and Team "Love..."

1441
01:04:59,469 --> 01:05:02,638
for the happy memories they've given me.

1442
01:05:02,639 --> 01:05:04,569
I changed my style a bit,

1443
01:05:04,570 --> 01:05:06,969
and I noticed a lot of people couldn't recognize me.

1444
01:05:07,610 --> 01:05:09,110
His voice sounds familiar.

1445
01:05:12,309 --> 01:05:14,519
Please remember me, everyone. I'm CHAE HEEJU.

1446
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:16,579
Even with short hair, I'm still CHAE HEEJU.

1447
01:05:20,190 --> 01:05:23,359
I will now announce the assembling results...

1448
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:25,530
of the ten trainees here.

1449
01:05:25,789 --> 01:05:26,828
Here we go.

1450
01:05:26,829 --> 01:05:28,829
I wonder who will get into A5.

1451
01:05:29,630 --> 01:05:31,829
(The 1st Passing Ceremony, 41st place to 50th place)

1452
01:05:34,139 --> 01:05:36,999

1457
01:05:47,050 --> 01:05:49,178
and HA SEOKHEE in the 41st place.

1458
01:05:49,179 --> 01:05:50,719
What?

1459
01:05:51,949 --> 01:05:54,159
The assembled slot for these six trainees...

1460
01:05:54,719 --> 01:05:55,860
It must be A3.

1461
01:05:55,989 --> 01:05:57,190
A4?

1462
01:05:59,130 --> 01:06:02,230
(The 1st Passing Ceremony, 41st place to 50th place)

1463
01:06:02,329 --> 01:06:04,369
The assembled slot for these six trainees...

1464
01:06:05,929 --> 01:06:08,569
- Is it A1? - to slot A1.

1465
01:06:08,570 --> 01:06:09,768
It's JIHO.

1466
01:06:09,769 --> 01:06:11,639
Please move to slot A1.

1467
01:06:14,409 --> 01:06:16,780
A1 suddenly has six members now.

1468
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:23,948
A1 is now half-full.

1469
01:06:23,949 --> 01:06:27,989
(The 1st Passing Ceremony, 41st place to 50th place)

1470
01:06:28,090 --> 01:06:30,860
Next, I will announce the slot first.

1471
01:06:31,389 --> 01:06:33,428
The trainee to be assembled in A2,

1472
01:06:33,429 --> 01:06:35,759
which is still empty...

1473
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:38,369
(Which trainees will be assembled in A2?)

1474
01:06:41,139 --> 01:06:42,139
Who is it?

1475
01:06:43,139 --> 01:06:45,769
It's Trainee YEOM YECHAN in the 49th place.

1476
01:06:46,610 --> 01:06:49,879
YEOM YECHAN is the 1st trainee to be assembled in A2.

1477
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:51,309
No, don't go.

1478
01:06:51,650 --> 01:06:53,110
All right.

1479
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:58,949
(Trainee YEOM YECHAN is the 1st to be assembled in A2.)

1480
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:02,989
Next, the slot where the 42nd place OK CHANGHYEON is assembled to...

1481
01:07:03,159 --> 01:07:05,559
is A5.

1482
01:07:07,530 --> 01:07:09,199
We finally have a leader.

1483
01:07:12,199 --> 01:07:14,670
We promised to meet each other soon, and now we have.

1484
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:18,570
We have two global trainees left.

1485
01:07:18,739 --> 01:07:21,579
They are PETCH in the 46th place...

1486
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:24,750
and LYNNLYNN in the 48th place.

1487
01:07:25,079 --> 01:07:26,848
The slot where these two trainees are assembled in is...

1488
01:07:26,849 --> 01:07:28,980
A4.

1489
01:07:30,550 --> 01:07:32,489
Please move to A4.

1490
01:07:34,820 --> 01:07:36,760
They won't have to worry about their dancing.

1491
01:07:37,059 --> 01:07:38,730
- Man. - Oh, man.

1492
01:07:43,230 --> 01:07:44,300
Sit here.

1493
01:07:47,269 --> 01:07:49,800
This is the first Passing Ceremony in PROJECT 7.

1494
01:07:50,239 --> 01:07:52,368
The slots are getting filled...

1495
01:07:52,369 --> 01:07:54,579
according to the assembly by the World Assemblers.

1496
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:57,880
Who will take the remaining seats?

1497
01:07:58,010 --> 01:08:00,549
Both the World Assemblers and the trainees must be...

1498
01:08:00,550 --> 01:08:04,150
watching the Passing Ceremony with nervousness.

1499
01:08:04,550 --> 01:08:06,448
Let me now announce...

1500
01:08:06,449 --> 01:08:09,360
the ranks from the 40th to the 31st.

1501
01:08:09,619 --> 01:08:11,559
I hope they call me soon.

1502
01:08:12,090 --> 01:08:13,590
I feel like I'll be called here.

1503
01:08:13,789 --> 01:08:15,199
No, you'll be ranked higher.

1504
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:17,130
I should be somewhere here.

1505
01:08:18,729 --> 01:08:20,729
I will now announce the trainee in the 40th place.

1506
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:23,399
The first letter of this trainee's name...

1507
01:08:24,109 --> 01:08:25,710
starts with S.

1508
01:08:26,439 --> 01:08:27,680
- SVIAT? - SVIAT?

1509
01:08:28,439 --> 01:08:30,309
SVIAT?

1510
01:08:30,310 --> 01:08:32,510
I can only think of SVIAT when I think of the letter S.

1511
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:34,479
Everyone's talking about SVIAT.

1512
01:08:35,579 --> 01:08:37,050
I have S in my name too.

1513
01:08:37,449 --> 01:08:38,590
SANTA?

1514
01:08:38,989 --> 01:08:40,819
- Is it SANTA? - SANTA?

1515
01:08:40,989 --> 01:08:42,059
(31st place, SANTA, Week 2 ranking)

1516
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:43,219
Is it JINWON?

1517
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:44,229
SEO JINWON?

1518
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:46,659
(38th place, SEO JINWON, Week 2 ranking)

1519
01:08:47,159 --> 01:08:48,630
This trainee received...

1520
01:08:49,199 --> 01:08:53,329
a global voting score of 331,607 points.

1521
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:55,600
SEO JINWON.

1522
01:08:55,670 --> 01:08:57,568
Me?

1523
01:08:57,569 --> 01:08:58,569
SANTA?

1524
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:01,709
It's SEO JINWON.

1525
01:09:01,710 --> 01:09:03,140
(40th place, Trainee SEO JINWON)

1526
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:04,510
Congratulations.

1527
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:07,380
S is the best!

1528
01:09:07,479 --> 01:09:09,948
Come here!

1529
01:09:09,949 --> 01:09:13,449
SEO JINWON calls himself as the best dancer in Gyeongju...

1530
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:15,659
and showed exceptional skills in dancing,

1531
01:09:15,819 --> 01:09:19,189
gaining support from a lot of World Assemblers.

1532
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:21,460
He'd indeed be a great dancer if he got lessons.

1533
01:09:22,159 --> 01:09:23,229
Congratulations.

1534
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:26,328
Next is the trainee in the 39th place.

1535
01:09:26,329 --> 01:09:27,746
(The 39th-place trainee is to be revealed.)

1536
01:09:27,770 --> 01:09:29,970
He's a vocal fairy...

1537
01:09:30,569 --> 01:09:32,515
whom all the other trainees in PROJECT 7 acknowledged.

1538
01:09:32,539 --> 01:09:33,670
It's HANBIN.

1539
01:09:33,810 --> 01:09:36,079
No, HANBIN will be ranked higher.

1540
01:09:36,109 --> 01:09:37,179
HANBIN.

1541
01:09:37,180 --> 01:09:38,356
(30th place, LEE HANBIN, Week 2 ranking)

1542
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:39,408
Is it DOHUN?

1543
01:09:39,409 --> 01:09:40,826
(29th place, KIM DOHUN, Week 2 ranking)

1544
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:42,478
Please.

1545
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:44,419
Please call TAEHWAN this time.

1546
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:46,090
- TAEHWAN. - Please call him.

1547
01:09:46,590 --> 01:09:47,990
He deserves to be called this time.

1548
01:09:48,819 --> 01:09:50,259
This trainee received...

1549
01:09:50,260 --> 01:09:55,060
a global voting score of 343,633 points.

1550
01:09:56,430 --> 01:09:58,270
It's OH TAEHWAN.

1551
01:09:59,729 --> 01:10:01,698
(39th place, Trainee OH TAEHWAN)

1552
01:10:01,699 --> 01:10:02,770
Congratulations.

1553
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,568
You got it.

1554
01:10:04,569 --> 01:10:05,640
Thank you.

1555
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:09,309
TAEHWAN!

1556
01:10:09,310 --> 01:10:11,408
- TAEHWAN. - Nice one.

1557
01:10:11,409 --> 01:10:12,809
- Nice. - Good job.

1558
01:10:12,810 --> 01:10:14,079
Hey!

1559
01:10:15,579 --> 01:10:17,420
TAEHWAN.

1560
01:10:17,890 --> 01:10:20,249
OH TAEHWAN is known...

1561
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:23,519
to be a vocal fairy who can sing...

1562
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:25,930
any highlight parts with a high pitch.

1563
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:28,580
Did all the members of Team "Love me or Leave Me" make it?

1564
01:10:29,930 --> 01:10:32,470
No, HANBIN might end up going home.

1565
01:10:32,930 --> 01:10:34,699
- That sounds risky. - Right.

1566
01:10:35,899 --> 01:10:39,239
Next, let me announce the trainee in the 38th place.

1567
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:42,739
He's one of the youngest trainees in PROJECT 7,

1568
01:10:42,909 --> 01:10:45,510
and he is known for his cute smile.

1569
01:10:45,810 --> 01:10:47,078
HYUNWOO.

1570
01:10:47,079 --> 01:10:48,148
HYUNWOO?

1571
01:10:48,149 --> 01:10:49,779
(Trainee HYUNWOO was born in 2010.)

1572
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:51,449
Is it ANDY or SVIAT?

1573
01:10:52,149 --> 01:10:54,149
- JUNWOO? - JUNWOO.

1574
01:10:54,390 --> 01:10:55,920
It could be JUNWOO.

1575
01:10:56,119 --> 01:10:57,859
No, it's not me. I don't have a smile.

1576
01:10:58,460 --> 01:11:00,688
- No, you do. - I don't have one.

01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:37,860
(32nd, KWON YANGWOO, 408,877 points)

1751
01:18:38,119 --> 01:18:40,648
In the 1st week, he started off at 44th.

1752
01:18:40,649 --> 01:18:44,059
For the 1st Passing Ceremony, he's in 32nd place,

1753
01:18:44,060 --> 01:18:45,460
which is in the safe zone.

1754
01:18:48,029 --> 01:18:51,029
I feel like YANGWOO will join us.

1755
01:18:53,199 --> 01:18:55,800
Next up is the trainee in 31st place.

1756
01:18:56,239 --> 01:18:57,699
He's already debuted before.

1757
01:18:57,899 --> 01:19:00,569
He's a trainee whose experience stands out.

1758
01:19:00,810 --> 01:19:02,039
- Experience? - Who is it?

1759
01:19:03,439 --> 01:19:04,539
It's me.

1760
01:19:05,979 --> 01:19:07,479
Experience? Could it be HEEDO?

1761
01:19:08,010 --> 01:19:09,420
It's either HEEDO or HYUNJAE.

1762
01:19:10,550 --> 01:19:11,890
If it's one of us, then what?

1763
01:19:12,850 --> 01:19:15,090
Who could it be? There are too many.

1764
01:19:15,590 --> 01:19:16,959
This trainee received...

1765
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:21,529
a global voting score of 445,448 points.

1766
01:19:21,859 --> 01:19:22,899
Who is it?

1767
01:19:23,329 --> 01:19:24,869
It's Trainee YOO HEEDO.

1768
01:19:25,899 --> 01:19:27,828
(31st, Trainee YOO HEEDO)

1769
01:19:27,829 --> 01:19:28,970
Congratulations.

1770
01:19:31,739 --> 01:19:34,169
Trainee YOO HEEDO made use of his experience of debuting...

1771
01:19:34,170 --> 01:19:36,078
and led other trainees,

1772
01:19:36,079 --> 01:19:39,209
giving a lot of realistic pieces of advice.

1773
01:19:39,210 --> 01:19:40,210
(31st, YOO HEEDO, 445,448 points)

1774
01:19:40,211 --> 01:19:42,420
During Position Matching, he won first place,

1775
01:19:42,649 --> 01:19:44,850
winning the benefit of 20,000 points.

1776
01:19:44,989 --> 01:19:47,619
And he's in 31st place now.

1777
01:19:51,390 --> 01:19:52,788
(The trainees from 31st to 40th places are announced.)

1778
01:19:52,789 --> 01:19:54,260
- What? - Thank you.

1779
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:59,029
First of all, I'm really happy.

1780
01:20:00,029 --> 01:20:02,869
I didn't have that much airtime.

1781
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:06,670
But you still voted for me.

1782
01:20:07,609 --> 01:20:08,778
Thank you for that.

1783
01:20:08,779 --> 01:20:12,148
The World Assemblers, my family,

1784
01:20:12,149 --> 01:20:14,819
and my friends from school who kept cheering for me.

1785
01:20:15,350 --> 01:20:16,579
I really miss them.

1786
01:20:17,119 --> 01:20:18,319
Mom, I love you.

1787
01:20:19,390 --> 01:20:20,520
That's cute.

1788
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:25,430
First of all, thank you so much, World Assemblers, who voted for me.

1789
01:20:25,630 --> 01:20:28,398
I will work hard for the future performances...

1790
01:20:28,399 --> 01:20:30,500
and show you good ones. Thank you.

1791
01:20:34,869 --> 01:20:35,970
Hello.

1792
01:20:36,439 --> 01:20:38,639
(33rd, SANTA)

1793
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:41,310
I'm really happy right now.

1794
01:20:42,779 --> 01:20:43,779
He's happy.

1795
01:20:44,010 --> 01:20:45,909
I'll work hard. Thank you.

1796
01:20:46,250 --> 01:20:47,380
Gosh.

1797
01:20:51,020 --> 01:20:52,118
(40th, SEO JINWON)

1798
01:20:52,119 --> 01:20:57,920
My grandfather passed away this week.

1799
01:20:58,460 --> 01:21:03,060
He really adored me.

1800
01:21:05,369 --> 01:21:07,670
He always looked up my fancams and watched them.

1801
01:21:12,340 --> 01:21:13,439
So...

1802
01:21:13,970 --> 01:21:16,609
Because he always rooted for me,

1803
01:21:17,210 --> 01:21:20,210
I'll work even harder...

1804
01:21:20,649 --> 01:21:22,119
so I can get a higher ranking.

1805
01:21:23,350 --> 01:21:25,250
- Thank you. - Let's go!

1806
01:21:28,390 --> 01:21:29,659
Trainee KIM JEONGMIN.

1807
01:21:30,859 --> 01:21:31,988
Yes.

1808
01:21:31,989 --> 01:21:34,960
You scolded CHOI JUYOUNG while you were on Team "WORK."

1809
01:21:35,229 --> 01:21:36,229
Right.

1810
01:21:36,230 --> 01:21:38,868
You said you wanted to tell this...

1811
01:21:38,869 --> 01:21:40,729
to JUYOUNG's parents.

1812
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:44,399
JUYOUNG's mother and father, I'm so sorry!

1813
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:47,340
I'm sorry!

1814
01:21:49,479 --> 01:21:50,979
- That's cute. - He's so cute.

1815
01:21:52,649 --> 01:21:55,550
The first trainee, YOO HEEDO, is assembled to...

1816
01:21:57,579 --> 01:21:59,148
- By himself? - What could it be?

1817
01:21:59,149 --> 01:22:01,619
It's...

1818
01:22:01,859 --> 01:22:02,988
A3.

1819
01:22:02,989 --> 01:22:03,989
(Trainee YOO HEEDO joins A3.)

1820
01:22:03,990 --> 01:22:05,460
Please move to A3.

1821
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:09,100
HEEDO.

1822
01:22:10,729 --> 01:22:12,300
- I'll work hard. - Let's work hard.

1823
01:22:13,430 --> 01:22:15,438
(Trainee YOO HEEDO joins A3.)

1824
01:22:15,439 --> 01:22:16,800
Trainee SANTA.

1825
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:18,439
Trainee KIM JEONGMIN.

01:22:18,569 --> 01:22:20,210
Trainee OH SEUNGCHAN.

1827
01:22:20,539 --> 01:22:21,840
Trainee SEO JINWON.

1828
01:22:22,210 --> 01:22:24,210
The four of them were assembled together.

1829
01:22:25,649 --> 01:22:26,750
I think they'll come to us.

1830
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:30,455
- I think they'll join us. - I think they'll join us.

1831
01:22:30,479 --> 01:22:31,519
- They're joining us for sure. - Really?

1832
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:33,390
- Yes. - The slot you're joining...

1833
01:22:34,289 --> 01:22:37,760
is A2.

1834
01:22:38,189 --> 01:22:39,729
Please move to A2.

1835
01:22:40,689 --> 01:22:41,728
Gosh, that's a lot.

1836
01:22:41,729 --> 01:22:43,000
That team is totally hip-hop.

1837
01:22:44,060 --> 01:22:45,300
Gosh, they look cool.

1838
01:22:46,369 --> 01:22:47,569
They have strong rappers.

1839
01:22:47,899 --> 01:22:50,369
A2 has a great combination.

1840
01:22:52,609 --> 01:22:54,739
Next, Trainee KWON YANGWOO...

1841
01:22:55,109 --> 01:22:56,779
and Trainee OH TAEHWAN...

1842

are assigned to A4.

1843
01:23:00,949 --> 01:23:03,420
(Trainees KWON YANGWOO and OH TAEHWAN join A4.)

1844
01:23:03,819 --> 01:23:05,789
- YANGWOO. - Welcome.

1845
01:23:06,890 --> 01:23:09,288

1848
01:23:14,029 --> 01:23:15,729
and PARK JUNWOO,

1849
01:23:16,399 --> 01:23:18,229
have been assembled to the same slot.

1850
01:23:18,369 --> 01:23:20,406
The two youngest trainees are in the same team again.

1851
01:23:20,430 --> 01:23:21,899
The three of you will join...

1852
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:23,800
A3?

1853
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,569
A1.

1854
01:23:26,810 --> 01:23:28,408
A1.

1855
01:23:28,409 --> 01:23:29,710
- It's here. - It's here.

1856
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:32,278
Please move to A1 together.

1857
01:23:32,279 --> 01:23:34,479
(Trainees YU JIAHN, ASAKA KOTARO, PARK JUNWOO join A1.)

1858
01:23:35,649 --> 01:23:38,250
- KOTARO! - Welcome.

1859
01:23:42,159 --> 01:23:44,459
(10 trainees have been assembled.)

1860
01:23:44,460 --> 01:23:48,359
PROJECT 7's 1st Passing Ceremony is proceeding with a global voting.

1861
01:23:48,630 --> 01:23:50,130
Now we have only...

1862
01:23:50,260 --> 01:23:51,969
(A1 has 4 spots.)

1863
01:23:51,970 --> 01:23:53,630
(A2 has 9 spots.)

1864
01:23:53,729 --> 01:23:55,438
(A3 has 11 spots.)

1865
01:23:55,439 --> 01:23:57,169
(A4 has 6 spots.)

1866
01:23:57,170 --> 01:23:58,839
(A5 has 1 spot.)

1867
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:01,409
half of the spots available.

1868
01:24:03,279 --> 01:24:04,880
Before announcing the next rankings,

1869
01:24:05,010 --> 01:24:07,179
another video is prepared...

1870
01:24:07,180 --> 01:24:09,050
for the World Assemblers.

1871
01:24:13,850 --> 01:24:15,989
(They've come to work again today.)

1872
01:24:18,930 --> 01:24:22,560
(This is where the trainees spend their day.)

1873
01:24:23,130 --> 01:24:26,869
(What will happen in the training room?)

1874
01:24:28,470 --> 01:24:33,770
(They're in the middle of practice.)

1875
01:24:34,340 --> 01:24:35,539
Get in there just like that.

1876
01:24:36,210 --> 01:24:37,530
This is what you call assembling.

1877
01:24:38,279 --> 01:24:40,850
(Crumpling to assemble)

1878
01:24:41,079 --> 01:24:44,249
I believe the youngest needs to be happy...

1879
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:46,688
for the whole team to be happy.

1880
01:24:46,689 --> 01:24:48,219
- Really? - Youngest, use this.

1881
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:49,289
What?

1882
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:50,658
Being considerate like this.

1883
01:24:50,659 --> 01:24:52,759
- Gosh, I've never... - Being thoughtful and considerate.

1884
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:55,729
So this is how JUNWOO must've felt.

1885
01:24:55,829 --> 01:24:58,529
(Who is JUNWOO, the youngest?)

1886
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:01,470
I'm the youngest on the show, PARK JUNWOO.

1887
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,039
(Patting)

1888
01:25:05,109 --> 01:25:07,568
(Trainee PARK JUNWOO is the youngest on the show who was born in 2011.)

1889
01:25:07,569 --> 01:25:08,779
JUNWOO.

1890
01:25:10,510 --> 01:25:13,750
(Giving JUNWOO his name tag)

1891
01:25:15,319 --> 01:25:16,520
JUNWOO.

1892
01:25:18,489 --> 01:25:21,319
(Playing with JUNWOO)

1893
01:25:21,989 --> 01:25:23,989
(Getting in his arms)

1894
01:25:25,329 --> 01:25:27,060
- Is it comfortable? - Yes.

1895
01:25:28,699 --> 01:25:30,800
(Getting in his arms again)

1896
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:33,069
I'm taller than you.

1897
01:25:33,899 --> 01:25:35,029
That's childish.

1898
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:39,908
Sorry.

1899
01:25:39,909 --> 01:25:41,670
Who is the younger one there?

1900
01:25:45,609 --> 01:25:47,850
(The older guys' endless love for JUNWOO)

1901
01:25:48,350 --> 01:25:49,750
You caught a cold,

1902
01:25:49,850 --> 01:25:52,589
so you can't get sick again.

1903
01:25:52,590 --> 01:25:53,948
We have another evaluation tomorrow.

1904
01:25:53,949 --> 01:25:55,020
That's right.

1905
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:56,988
I don't know.

1906
01:25:56,989 --> 01:26:00,590
There are things you don't have to yield, you punk.

1907
01:26:00,930 --> 01:26:03,100
- My head hurts so much. - What about your part?

1908
01:26:03,159 --> 01:26:04,260
Rap.

1909
01:26:05,829 --> 01:26:07,699
(Lifting)

1910
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:11,569

(Among the cute youngest trainees, )

1914
01:26:27,949 --> 01:26:32,029
(another youngest shows off his strong presence.)

1915
01:26:32,460 --> 01:26:34,259
I'm JUNG SEYUN, and I'm 18.

1916
01:26:34,260 --> 01:26:36,029
(Trainee JUNG SEYUN who was born in 2007)

1917
01:26:36,729 --> 01:26:40,000
(Next to the older guys who are working out their abs, )

1918
01:26:40,369 --> 01:26:44,199
(the boy in goggles is working out seriously.)

1919
01:26:45,270 --> 01:26:46,970
Seriously, why do you have goggles?

1920
01:26:47,039 --> 01:26:48,609
They were in my bag.

1921
01:26:49,279 --> 01:26:50,639
They were in your bag?

1922
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:51,680
Yes.

1923
01:26:51,979 --> 01:26:53,659
Didn't you come here straight from school?

1924
01:26:54,050 --> 01:26:55,649
- I did. - Is that so?

1925
01:26:57,020 --> 01:27:01,090
(The goggles were in SEYUN's bag for no reason.)

1926
01:27:01,449 --> 01:27:03,590
(Rummaging)

1927
01:27:05,529 --> 01:27:08,960
(This time, a recorder pops out of his bag.)

1928
01:27:09,659 --> 01:27:11,398
(Do, re, )

1929
01:27:11,399 --> 01:27:14,569
(mi, fa, sol, la, ti, do)

1930
01:27:16,140 --> 01:27:18,269
He looks like a high schooler when he does that.

1931
01:27:18,270 --> 01:27:19,339
(SEYUN's close friend, SEUNGHO)

1932
01:27:19,340 --> 01:27:21,500
(He's been carrying around the recorder all the time.)

1933
01:27:27,350 --> 01:27:28,409
He's cute.

1934
01:27:30,220 --> 01:27:31,220
SEYUN.

1935
01:27:31,420 --> 01:27:32,449
SEUNGHO!

1936
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:40,390
(The ones born in 2007 are happy when they're together.)

1937
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:45,059
(The Project Village is filled with brotherly chemistry.)

1938
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:51,569
(The Project Village is filled with brotherly chemistry.)

1939
01:27:53,569 --> 01:27:56,409
(Another charm of the Project Village)

1940
01:27:56,609 --> 01:27:58,380
If you gargle with salt water,

1941
01:27:58,609 --> 01:28:00,279
it helps with your throat condition.

1942
01:28:00,779 --> 01:28:02,219
- That's true. - Since we're a vocalist team,

1943
01:28:02,220 --> 01:28:04,148
we need to take care of our throats with salt water.

1944
01:28:04,149 --> 01:28:05,648
(How the vocalist team takes care of their throats)

1945
01:28:05,649 --> 01:28:07,609
It's called "flower salt" too. We're butterflies.

1946
01:28:08,659 --> 01:28:10,520
- Mine is "love," though. - What is that?

1947
01:28:13,090 --> 01:28:14,129
Nice.

1948
01:28:14,130 --> 01:28:15,228
(They may be opponents, but they manage their throats together.)

1949
01:28:15,229 --> 01:28:17,229
- Let's clink before drinking it. - Okay.

1950
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,599
Team "Love wins all" and Team "Don't Go," let's go!

1951
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:20,898
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1952
01:28:20,899 --> 01:28:22,100
Hoping this will help.

1953
01:28:24,470 --> 01:28:25,510
(Grossed out)

1954
01:28:30,380 --> 01:28:33,250
(Anyway, it's supposed to be good for your throat.)

1955
01:28:34,210 --> 01:28:36,680
(Team "Love me or Leave me" is also working on something.)

1956
01:28:37,479 --> 01:28:40,489
(A mask is given to SIHUN)

1957
01:28:43,119 --> 01:28:44,119
(Good.)

1958
01:28:45,220 --> 01:28:47,028
You shouldn't talk either.

1959
01:28:47,029 --> 01:28:48,760
(He hands a mask to HANBIN as well.)

1960
01:28:49,529 --> 01:28:51,529
(They all put on a mask with an X.)

1961
01:28:53,699 --> 01:28:57,770
(A unique way Team "Love me or Leave me" manages their throats)

1962
01:29:00,039 --> 01:29:04,239
(A firm determination not to talk)

1963
01:29:05,409 --> 01:29:07,379
(This time, rap teams practice together.)

1964
01:29:07,380 --> 01:29:09,850
JEONGMIN.

1965
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:12,219
Try putting on the glasses on the back of your head...

1966
01:29:12,220 --> 01:29:13,589
like I did earlier.

1967
01:29:13,590 --> 01:29:15,149
I'll copy your style.

1968
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:17,759
Guys, let me introduce him.

1969
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:20,130
He's the leader of Team "Crayon," HEEDO.

1970
01:29:20,189 --> 01:29:23,529
I'm the center member of this team, JEONGMIN.

1971
01:29:25,470 --> 01:29:29,869
(They perform together after changing their identities.)

1972
01:29:31,539 --> 01:29:32,970
We could perform together.

1973
01:29:35,069 --> 01:29:37,409
(They formed a team called "WORKrayon.")

1974
01:29:38,109 --> 01:29:40,148
Gosh, he's so good.

1975
01:29:40,149 --> 01:29:44,350
(Their teamwork is quite good.)

1976
01:29:45,619 --> 01:29:50,590
(They watch it together.)

1977
01:29:52,430 --> 01:29:54,289
It's so cool because there are many people.

1978
01:29:54,630 --> 01:29:56,760
- We should've performed together. - I know.

1979
01:29:59,029 --> 01:30:00,728
(They may be in different teams, )

1980
01:30:00,729 --> 01:30:04,069
(but they show great reactions.)

1981
01:30:04,670 --> 01:30:06,669
It sounds a lot better, right?

1982
01:30:06,670 --> 01:30:10,439
(Giving feedback generously)

1983
01:30:11,409 --> 01:30:12,849
Okay, let's practice until there.

1984
01:30:12,850 --> 01:30:14,609
(Sharing their secret method of twerking)

1985
01:30:15,109 --> 01:30:17,750
Let's go.

1986
01:30:17,949 --> 01:30:19,949
(You need to do it like this.)

1987
01:30:20,250 --> 01:30:21,389
Gosh, how does his hip...

1988
01:30:21,390 --> 01:30:22,920
- go up this high? - I know.

1989
01:30:23,319 --> 01:30:25,689
He's teaching that so seriously?

1990
01:30:28,130 --> 01:30:30,229
(They perform together while they're at it.)

1991
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:35,369
(The Project Village is filled with things to watch.)

1992
01:30:37,199 --> 01:30:39,069
- One, two, three. - Two, three.

1993
01:30:39,270 --> 01:30:41,270
- Ta-da. - Ta-da.

1994
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:44,939
Can I even be seen?

1995
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:47,509
Just let them hear your voice.

1996
01:30:47,510 --> 01:30:49,819
- You can be seen. - It's that one.

1997
01:30:51,779 --> 01:30:54,090
(The next team enters.)

1998
01:30:55,859 --> 01:31:00,130
(Endless trainees enter.)

1999
01:31:01,789 --> 01:31:03,429
- Don't push. - What are you doing?

2000
01:31:03,430 --> 01:31:04,500
Don't push.

2001
01:31:04,630 --> 01:31:05,769
Is everyone in?

2002
01:31:05,770 --> 01:31:07,600
Can the trainee at the back be seen?

2003
01:31:07,670 --> 01:31:09,270
Best dancer from Gyeongju, come on out.

2004
01:31:10,470 --> 01:31:11,770
Okay?

2005
01:31:12,140 --> 01:31:13,538
(The best dancer from Gyeongju, JINWON, appears.)

2006
01:31:13,539 --> 01:31:15,368
- Hello. - The granny.

2007
01:31:15,369 --> 01:31:16,679
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2008
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:17,938
Your haircut is nice.

2009
01:31:17,939 --> 01:31:20,049
- Let's move on. - Who's next?

2010
01:31:20,050 --> 01:31:21,879
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2011
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:23,578
What? He didn't get it.

2012
01:31:23,579 --> 01:31:25,279
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2013
01:31:26,449 --> 01:31:27,590
What did you say?

2014
01:31:27,989 --> 01:31:30,889
Still, we... Who is it?

2015
01:31:30,890 --> 01:31:32,020
First Tier Zone...

2016
01:31:33,130 --> 01:31:36,000
(Wiping clean)

2017
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:39,828
- Let's do this! - Let's do this!

2018
01:31:39,829 --> 01:31:40,969
(As they've been together for a long time, )

2019
01:31:40,970 --> 01:31:42,330
(they formed many great memories.)

2020
01:31:43,340 --> 01:31:44,639
Bye!

2021
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:45,908
Come on.

2022
01:31:45,909 --> 01:31:46,969
Open the door.

2023
01:31:46,970 --> 01:31:48,738
Let your hand go. I'll open the door.

2024
01:31:48,739 --> 01:31:49,939
Let's get out of here!

2025
01:31:52,750 --> 01:31:55,920
(It takes a while for them to exit the room.)

2026
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:59,788
(Let's get back to our practice!)

2027
01:31:59,789 --> 01:32:02,459
Next up is the trainee in 30th place.

2028
01:32:02,460 --> 01:32:04,158
(Revealing the trainee in 30th place)

2029
01:32:04,159 --> 01:32:06,988
When he started calling trainees from 30th place,

2030
01:32:06,989 --> 01:32:08,658
my heart started beating really fast.

2031
01:32:08,659 --> 01:32:10,959
It was about time he called my name,

2032
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:12,669
but he didn't.

2033
01:32:12,670 --> 01:32:15,169
Since the benefit points are applied,

2034
01:32:15,170 --> 01:32:18,140
I thought I'd be called between 20th and 30th places.

2035
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:21,238
He's usually gentle,

2036
01:32:21,239 --> 01:32:25,180
but when he sings, he sings with a great volume.

2037
01:32:25,479 --> 01:32:26,810
What? That's me.

2038
01:32:27,979 --> 01:32:29,578
But you're not gentle.

2039
01:32:29,579 --> 01:32:30,880
Gosh, you...

2040
01:32:31,449 --> 01:32:33,220
JAEWON.

2041
01:32:33,949 --> 01:32:36,460
Is it me? But the ranking is too low.

2042
01:32:36,859 --> 01:32:38,499
Who else has a voice with a great volume?

2043
01:32:39,130 --> 01:32:40,289
DOHUN?

2044
01:32:41,460 --> 01:32:42,829
This trainee received...

2045
01:32:43,460 --> 01:32:47,770
a global voting score of 455,487 points.

2046
01:32:49,939 --> 01:32:51,599
It's Trainee KIM DOHUN.

2047
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:53,408
(30th, Trainee KIM DOHUN)

2048
01:32:53,409 --> 01:32:55,039
- Congratulations. - You made it.

2049
01:32:55,340 --> 01:32:57,710
- DOHUN. - DOHUN.

2050
01:32:57,810 --> 01:32:59,449
DOHUN. I told you you'd make it.

2051
01:33:00,550 --> 01:33:01,949
DOHUN is so...

2052
01:33:02,850 --> 01:33:05,078
- Gosh, his ranking went up a lot. - How amazing.

2053
01:33:05,079 --> 01:33:06,749
(His ranking jumped a lot from 91st to 30th.)

2054
01:33:06,750 --> 01:33:08,149
He's tearing up.

2055
01:33:09,189 --> 01:33:12,429
Despite being in the vocal position,

2056
01:33:12,430 --> 01:33:14,459
he challenged himself to a dance position for Position Matching.

2057
01:33:14,460 --> 01:33:17,829
He showed his potential to become an all-rounder.

2058
01:33:19,899 --> 01:33:21,029
It's nice.

2059
01:33:21,399 --> 01:33:23,699
Next up is the trainee in 29th place.

2060
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:25,970
Unlike his cold first impression,

2061
01:33:26,010 --> 01:33:29,579
he's really playful, which is his unexpected charm.

2062
01:33:30,439 --> 01:33:32,510
- JUNSEO? - It could be JUNSEO.

2063
01:33:32,779 --> 01:33:34,078
JUNSEO will get the benefit.

2064
01:33:34,079 --> 01:33:35,550
It's not JUNSEO.

2065
01:33:35,609 --> 01:33:37,880
- HAJOON? - It must be HAJOON.

2066
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:39,688
Is that so?

2067
01:33:39,689 --> 01:33:41,189
(27th, WOO HAJOON)

2068
01:33:41,390 --> 01:33:42,590
Do I look cold?

2069
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:44,890
- No. I know it's not you. - It's not me?

2070
01:33:45,390 --> 01:33:46,759
This trainee received...

2071
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:51,199
a global voting score of 475,213 points.

2072
01:33:54,630 --> 01:33:55,840
It should be HAJOON.

2073
01:33:57,170 --> 01:33:59,739
It's LEE HANBIN. Congratulations.

2074
01:34:01,369 --> 01:34:07,210
(29th place, Trainee LEE HANBIN)

2075
01:34:07,310 --> 01:34:08,579
Right.

2076
01:34:08,909 --> 01:34:10,050
Right.

2077
01:34:10,149 --> 01:34:11,550
- Cold. - Do I look cold?

2078
01:34:11,649 --> 01:34:13,119
- Do I? - You look cold.

2079
01:34:13,649 --> 01:34:15,449
HANBIN looks sharp.

2080
01:34:15,890 --> 01:34:19,189
Trainee LEE HANBIN seized the center position...

2081
01:34:19,390 --> 01:34:22,399
of Team "Love me or Leave me" with his memorable husky voice.

2082
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:27,470
(Trainee LEE HANBIN, the center in the vocal position)

2083
01:34:28,729 --> 01:34:29,899
Thank you.

2084
01:34:30,399 --> 01:34:32,840
He once shed tears with the desire to do better.

2085
01:34:33,109 --> 01:34:37,180
I hope he gets to show his passion again during the next project.

2086
01:34:38,079 --> 01:34:40,278
Next, it's the 28th-place trainee.

2087
01:34:40,279 --> 01:34:41,279
(The 28th-place trainee is to be revealed.)

2088
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:43,720
He's the golden youngest trainee of PROJECT 7.

2089
01:34:44,779 --> 01:34:47,318
It's the global trainee...

2090
01:34:47,319 --> 01:34:49,260
with the never-ending energy.

2091
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:52,288
(28th place, SVIAT, Week 2 ranking)

2092
01:34:52,289 --> 01:34:53,728
- He's raising his hand. - Gosh.

2093
01:34:53,729 --> 01:34:54,760
SVIAT.

2094
01:34:57,159 --> 01:34:59,000
- He raised his hand. - Oh, gosh.

2095
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:01,029
Okay, let's go.

2096
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:07,310
He received a global voting score of 487,773.

2097
01:35:09,409 --> 01:35:12,209

(28th place, Trainee SVIAT)

2099
01:35:13,779 --> 01:35:15,380
Okay.

2100
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:21,750
Trainee SVIAT is a young global trainee,

2101
01:35:21,789 --> 01:35:24,559
but he adapted himself to PROJECT 7 better than anyone else...

2102
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:27,629
and has shown off his cute charm beyond limits every episode.

2103
01:35:27,630 --> 01:35:31,529
He's made a strong impression on World Assemblers for sure.

2104
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:33,829
Good job, SVIAT.

2105
01:35:34,529 --> 01:35:36,869

2107
01:35:41,170 --> 01:35:42,238
Who could it be?

2108
01:35:42,239 --> 01:35:43,709
Sculpture-like abs? That's me.

2109
01:35:43,710 --> 01:35:46,030
What are you talking about? I saw your belly this morning.

2110
01:35:47,649 --> 01:35:49,449
I shaved my belly hair in case this happened.

2111
01:35:49,619 --> 01:35:51,050
Just a moment. Let me check.

2112
01:35:51,180 --> 01:35:52,520
- Is it me? - I think it's me.

2113
01:35:54,449 --> 01:35:56,659
Who showed his abs during the competition?

2114
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:58,019
RYOMA?

2115
01:35:58,020 --> 01:35:59,020

Sculpture-like abs... YICHEN.

2119
01:36:02,659 --> 01:36:03,659
(Trainee YICHEN)

2120
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:04,899
Could it be...

2121
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,300
A global voting score...

2122
01:36:07,930 --> 01:36:11,939
- of 530,000... - All of a sudden?

2123
01:36:12,470 --> 01:36:13,809
- Gosh, 530,000? - That's a lot.

2124
01:36:13,810 --> 01:36:16,439
A global voting score of 539,189.

2125
01:36:16,609 --> 01:36:17,779
It's almost 540,000.

2126
01:36:17,939 --> 01:36:20,978
Trainee KIM HYUNJAE. Congratulations.

2127
01:36:20,979 --> 01:36:22,299
(27th place, Trainee KIM HYUNJAE)

2128
01:36:25,119 --> 01:36:28,590
Hot body!

2129
01:36:28,689 --> 01:36:30,559
Trainee KIM HYUNJAE tried out for a survival show again...

2130
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:32,119
without giving up,

2131
01:36:32,189 --> 01:36:34,288
and his desperate attitude for his dream...

2132
01:36:34,289 --> 01:36:37,500
has gotten him a lot of support from World Assemblers.

2133
01:36:38,060 --> 01:36:39,228
- Right now. - Yes.

2134
01:36:39,229 --> 01:36:41,699
(Hot body)

2135
01:36:42,399 --> 01:36:44,840
Next is the 26th-place trainee.

2136
01:36:45,170 --> 01:36:48,038
This trainee tried out for a vocal position...

2137
01:36:48,039 --> 01:36:49,199
during the Position Matching.

2138
01:36:50,539 --> 01:36:51,640
Maybe it's me.

2139
01:36:51,739 --> 01:36:52,979
Oh, it's past tense.

2140
01:36:54,380 --> 01:36:55,920
It's me.

2141
01:36:56,579 --> 01:36:57,649
It's me.

2142
01:36:58,479 --> 01:36:59,590
Who could it be?

2143
01:37:00,020 --> 01:37:01,420
He received...

2144
01:37:01,489 --> 01:37:05,220
- a global voting score of 542,082. - Me?

2145
01:37:06,189 --> 01:37:07,229

- Thank you. - Go.

2154
01:37:28,180 --> 01:37:30,278
Trainee KIM JOOHYUN is said to have a bold personality.

2155
01:37:30,279 --> 01:37:33,019
He's one of the youngest trainees, but he speaks his mind freely...

2156
01:37:33,020 --> 01:37:34,665
to the older trainees without getting intimidated.

2157
01:37:34,689 --> 01:37:38,719
I believe a sense of confidence is his charm.

2158
01:37:38,720 --> 01:37:40,360
(26th place, KIM JOOHYUN, 542,082 points)

This trainee also drew attention with his singing skills.

2162
01:37:50,699 --> 01:37:51,840
YONGHYUN?

2163
01:37:52,399 --> 01:37:54,470
I think it's YONGHYUN.

2164
01:37:55,210 --> 01:37:56,439
JAEWON or HYUNWOO?

2165
01:37:57,279 --> 01:37:58,640

have pointed him as a lead vocalist candidate.

2174
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,269
During the Position Matching,

2175
01:38:26,270 --> 01:38:29,538
he proved himself to be good at both singing and rapping.

2176
01:38:29,539 --> 01:38:33,709
He's been showing various sides each project.

2177
01:38:33,710 --> 01:38:35,390

are said to be a gate to becoming a fan of his.

2182
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:47,989
Who could it be?

2183
01:38:48,289 --> 01:38:49,300

It has to be HAJOON.

playful and boyish at ordinary times,

2203
01:39:25,529 --> 01:39:28,300
but in a training room, he changes from the look in his eyes.

2204
01:39:28,529 --> 01:39:31,169
He's also shown a real quality of being a leader...

2205
01:39:31,170 --> 01:39:33,539

HYUNWOO? MINSEO?

2235
01:40:56,859 --> 01:40:58,760
It's around time HYUNWOO is mentioned.

2236
01:40:58,989 --> 01:41:01,489
- There's YOUNGSEO. - Oh, right.

2241
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:14,608
Hold on. The number is on another level from here.

2242
01:41:14,609 --> 01:41:15,810
It's strange.

2243
01:41:15,970 --> 01:41:17,279
What a huge gap.

2244
01:41:17,409 --> 01:41:21,148

01:41:36,859 --> 01:41:39,260

2253
01:41:41,270 --> 01:41:42,629
Without the MVP benefit points,

2254
01:41:42,630 --> 01:41:44,869
he may not have been ranked this high.

2255
01:41:45,239 --> 01:41:48,739
He's proven how much the benefit points matter.

2256
01:41:49,479 --> 01:41:50,608
He's already received the points, right?

Could it be YURA?

2264
01:42:08,359 --> 01:42:09,430
It has to be him.

2265
01:42:10,159 --> 01:42:12,100
Could it be me?

2266
01:42:12,430 --> 01:42:14,369
- I was ranked 22nd last time. - Right.

2267

2269
01:42:18,039 --> 01:42:19,369
He's the most passionate one.

2270
01:42:19,640 --> 01:42:23,779
He received a global voting score of 920,109.

2271
01:42:25,439 --> 01:42:26,979
- Who could it be? - Who is it?

2272
01:42:28,479 --> 01:42:30,448
- It's Trainee ABE YURA. - Gosh.

2273
01:42:30,449 --> 01:42:31,519
(21st, Trainee ABE YURA)

2274
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:33,090
- YURA. - You moved up.

2275
01:42:33,319 --> 01:42:34,448
You're ranked higher.

2276
01:42:34,449 --> 01:42:37,760
Trainee ABE YURA taught other trainees like a teacher...

2277
01:42:37,890 --> 01:42:39,889
in a row for the Title Song Trainees' Self Assembly...

2278
01:42:39,890 --> 01:42:41,289
and Position Matching,

2279
01:42:41,390 --> 01:42:44,630
showing off his hidden strength as a good performer.

2280
01:42:44,699 --> 01:42:45,959
The scores of those within the top 20...

2281
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:47,246
I wonder what score the first-place trainee has.

2282
01:42:47,270 --> 01:42:49,470
Even without any benefit points, YURA received 920,000.

2283
01:42:49,539 --> 01:42:50,739
Please say a word.

2284
01:42:52,170 --> 01:42:53,569
Hello.

2285
01:42:55,270 --> 01:43:00,310
I'm so grateful to all the members of PROJECT 7.

2286
01:43:01,710 --> 01:43:06,149
And I'd like to send great love to my family.

2287
01:43:07,090 --> 01:43:08,220
Thank you.

2288
01:43:09,960 --> 01:43:11,818
I'll do my best.

2289
01:43:11,819 --> 01:43:12,930
- Good. - Go for it.

2290
01:43:14,789 --> 01:43:17,500
Hello. I'm SHIN JAEWON, the master of pansori.

2291
01:43:21,470 --> 01:43:24,399
I'd like to give thanks to the P4 trainees...

2292
01:43:24,470 --> 01:43:27,709
and Shalalala Land...

2293
01:43:27,710 --> 01:43:29,710
for helping me reach here.

2294
01:43:30,340 --> 01:43:32,310
I won't settle for this place...

2295
01:43:32,380 --> 01:43:36,108
and will improve myself to be a threat...

2296
01:43:36,109 --> 01:43:38,250
to those who will be named from now on. Thank you.

2297
01:43:40,890 --> 01:43:43,519
Okay. Hello, I'm FUKUYAMA SOTA.

2298
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:44,689
He's so cute.

2299
01:43:45,159 --> 01:43:46,289
I love it!

2300
01:43:47,430 --> 01:43:48,630
I...

2301
01:43:55,029 --> 01:43:56,349
- Is he crying? - It's all right.

2302
01:43:57,500 --> 01:43:58,640
Oh, dear.

2303
01:44:00,909 --> 01:44:01,970
Why is he crying?

2304
01:44:02,510 --> 01:44:03,710
It's all right.

2305
01:44:04,380 --> 01:44:05,579
It's all right.

2306
01:44:07,479 --> 01:44:08,609
Go for it.

2307
01:44:09,750 --> 01:44:13,420
I'm poor at dancing, singing,

2308
01:44:15,319 --> 01:44:17,590
and speaking Korean.

2309
01:44:18,760 --> 01:44:20,560
I'll practice...

2310
01:44:22,189 --> 01:44:24,229
hard and a lot.

2311
01:44:25,859 --> 01:44:28,398
I'm troubled to know that POP SHY...

2312
01:44:28,399 --> 01:44:31,539
and JIN from P3...

2313
01:44:33,069 --> 01:44:35,939
are still on the other side.

2314
01:44:44,819 --> 01:44:49,420
For helping me so much,

2315
01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:58,159
I'm truly grateful.

2316
01:45:00,130 --> 01:45:02,198
Go for it.

2317
01:45:02,199 --> 01:45:03,369
Wink.

2318
01:45:11,739 --> 01:45:13,750
You gave him a lot of help.

2319
01:45:13,949 --> 01:45:15,279
It's such a relief.

2320
01:45:18,050 --> 01:45:21,220
The assembly chosen directly by World Assemblers.

2321
01:45:21,689 --> 01:45:23,590

2324
01:45:29,899 --> 01:45:31,699
Gosh, the assembly... I'm nervous.

2325
01:45:32,060 --> 01:45:33,470

01:45:51,279 --> 01:45:52,880
Gosh. Let's see.

2333
01:45:53,989 --> 01:45:55,219
Maybe they'll come here.

2334
01:45:55,220 --> 01:45:56,996

2342
01:46:13,569 --> 01:46:14,710
It's full.

2343
01:46:15,439 --> 01:46:16,839
A1...

2344
01:46:16,840 --> 01:46:18,779
- has all been assembled... - There's one left.

2345
01:46:19,279 --> 01:46:20,880
Except for only one seat.

2346
01:46:21,050 --> 01:46:22,210
It's a nice team.

2347
01:46:22,649 --> 01:46:25,520
The World Assemblers got it perfectly in balance.

2348
01:46:29,289 --> 01:46:31,720

(Which slot will they be placed in?)

2354
01:46:45,239 --> 01:46:46,839

2365
01:47:11,100 --> 01:47:13,529
What... Yes, I love it.

2366
01:47:13,569 --> 01:47:15,729

Everyone in A3 is ranked high.

2403
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:41,019

01:48:46,729 --> 01:48:47,889
So many seats are left in A3.

2408
01:48:47,890 --> 01:48:49,459
They might have all the high rankers.

2409
01:48:49,460 --> 01:48:50,940
(Trainee ABE YURA is placed into A3.)

2410
01:48:54,569 --> 01:48:58,170
A lot of seats still aren't taken in A3.

2411
01:48:58,739 --> 01:49:01,510
Now, let me announce the high-ranked trainees.

2412
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:03,539
How jealous.

2413
01:49:04,039 --> 01:49:06,438
- He calls them high-rankers. - I know.

2414
01:49:06,439 --> 01:49:07,879
They aren't ranked high enough to make a debut,

2415
01:49:07,880 --> 01:49:09,349
but depending on their future performances,

2416
01:49:09,350 --> 01:49:12,520
they may have chances to debut.

2417
01:49:13,250 --> 01:49:14,949
(10th place, KANG MINSEO, Week 2 ranking)

2418
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:16,920
(19th, JUNG SEYUN, during the 2nd week)

2419
01:49:16,921 --> 01:49:18,241
- I'm nervous. - When will it be?

2420
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:22,929
The first Passing Ceremony...

2421
01:49:22,930 --> 01:49:24,675
determined by the global voting of World Assemblers.

2422
01:49:24,699 --> 01:49:29,000

2424
01:49:32,470 --> 01:49:34,150
- What was your rank? - I was ranked 16th.

2425
01:49:35,069 --> 01:49:36,779
It's the 20th-place trainee.

2426
01:49:36,810 --> 01:49:39,108
He was recognized for his singing skills...

2427
01:49:39,109 --> 01:49:42,510
by the directors and World Assemblers.

2428
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:46,180

01:49:46,619 --> 01:49:48,550
(13th place, NAM JIWOON, Week 2 ranking)

2430
01:49:48,649 --> 01:49:49,920
It has to be YONGHYUN.

2431
01:49:50,520 --> 01:49:51,889
It will be such a shame if he gets eliminated now.

2432
01:49:51,890 --> 01:49:53,329
Oh, HYUNWOO!

2433
01:49:53,829 --> 01:49:55,689

He received...

2439
01:50:18,050 --> 01:50:19,619
a global voting score...

2440
01:50:20,149 --> 01:50:23,220
- It's 940,000. - of 948,050.

01:50:33,930 --> 01:50:35,199
Congratulations.

2444
01:50:35,500 --> 01:50:36,500
Thank you so much.

2445
01:50:36,501 --> 01:50:37,969
Trainee KWON YONGHYUN is called...

2446
01:50:37,970 --> 01:50:40,908
to have a guaranteed pass to gaining in-laws' favor.

2447
01:50:40,909 --> 01:50:42,709
He greets everyone...

2448
01:50:42,710 --> 01:50:45,109
with a bright smile anywhere, anytime.

2449
01:50:45,340 --> 01:50:46,809
It's like seeing him at a wedding.

2450
01:50:46,810 --> 01:50:48,680
- I know. - A wedding.

2451
01:50:49,380 --> 01:50:50,850
I'll look forward to seeing him...

2452

01:50:58,819 --> 01:51:01,460
Moving onto the 19th-place trainee.

2456
01:51:01,659 --> 01:51:04,460
He's always bright with his untiring positive energy.

2457
01:51:04,659 --> 01:51:07,800
He's known to give out his vitamin-like charm.

2458
01:51:08,729 --> 01:51:10,399
It might be JUNWON.

2459
01:51:11,300 --> 01:51:12,399
ANDY?

2460
01:51:13,470 --> 01:51:14,568
That's me.

2461
01:51:14,569 --> 01:51:15,885

He received...

2463
01:51:17,939 --> 01:51:23,350
a global voting score of 986,379.

2464
01:51:23,850 --> 01:51:26,119
Gosh, that's 40,000 higher.

2465
01:51:26,279 --> 01:51:27,850
It's close to a million.

2466
01:51:31,060 --> 01:51:32,259
Trainee ANDY.

2467
01:51:32,260 --> 01:51:34,089
(19th place, Trainee ANDY)

2468
01:51:34,090 --> 01:51:35,829

- Gosh. - Congratulations.

2471
01:51:42,529 --> 01:51:45,670
Trainee ANDY was ranked 60th during the 1st week.

2472
01:51:45,899 --> 01:51:49,140
Only after a week, he moved up by 43 ranks.

2473
01:51:49,810 --> 01:51:52,179
Becoming a stable high-ranker in an instant,

2474
01:51:52,180 --> 01:51:55,010
he showed what a miracle was.

2475
01:51:55,109 --> 01:51:56,680
He cries so easily.

2476
01:51:58,250 --> 01:52:00,750
He cries too often.

2477
01:52:03,020 --> 01:52:05,920
I can't wait to see...

2478
01:52:06,289 --> 01:52:08,858
what kinds of new sides he'll show during the next project.

2479
01:52:08,859 --> 01:52:10,219
(19th place, ANDY, 986,379 points)

2480
01:52:10,529 --> 01:52:11,630
Good job.

2481
01:52:12,630 --> 01:52:14,170
ANDY.

2482
01:52:17,670 --> 01:52:21,770
Moving onto the 18th-place trainee.

2483
01:52:24,279 --> 01:52:25,710
From this trainee,

2484
01:52:26,180 --> 01:52:27,850
a global voting score...

2485
01:52:31,149 --> 01:52:34,788
is higher than a million.

2486
01:52:34,789 --> 01:52:36,448
(Stunned)

2487
01:52:36,449 --> 01:52:37,520
A million.

2488
01:52:37,859 --> 01:52:39,920
Is it actually possible? Goodness.

2489
01:52:41,229 --> 01:52:42,260
Gosh.

2490
01:52:42,829 --> 01:52:44,060
Did he say a million?

2491
01:52:45,130 --> 01:52:48,198
The 18th-place trainee is...

2492
01:52:48,199 --> 01:52:49,898
one of those who got benefit points from the Position Matching.

2493
01:52:49,899 --> 01:52:51,239
Who could it be?

2494
01:52:51,369 --> 01:52:53,669
- What? That's me. - Benefit?

2495
01:52:53,670 --> 01:52:54,909
It's me.

2496
01:53:00,810 --> 01:53:02,879
(Team "Love wins all" placed 1st in the vocal position...)

2497
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:05,649
(and obtained 20,000 benefit points.)

2498
01:53:09,090 --> 01:53:11,519

2500
01:53:17,229 --> 01:53:18,429
No.

2501
01:53:18,430 --> 01:53:19,600
"3D."

2502
01:53:20,500 --> 01:53:22,229
"Love wins all." BINGHUA.

2503
01:53:22,470 --> 01:53:24,039
It's likely to be BINGHUA.

2504
01:53:25,699 --> 01:53:27,010
He received...

2505
01:53:27,869 --> 01:53:33,380
a global voting score of 1,052,843.

2506
01:53:37,250 --> 01:53:38,618
It's Trainee PARK JUNSEO.

2507
01:53:38,619 --> 01:53:40,288
(18th place, Trainee PARK JUNSEO)

2508
01:53:40,289 --> 01:53:41,420
Congratulations.

2509
01:53:47,829 --> 01:53:49,288
During the past two projects,

2510
01:53:49,289 --> 01:53:52,199
acting as a leader,

2511
01:53:53,329 --> 01:53:56,198
trainee PARK JUNSEO delivered good results.

2512
01:53:56,199 --> 01:53:58,300
He showed ideal leadership.

2513
01:53:59,539 --> 01:54:01,809
During Position Matching, he gained benefit points...

2514
01:54:01,810 --> 01:54:04,309
from placing first as a team and being MVP.

2515
01:54:04,310 --> 01:54:06,738
As a result, he placed 18th.

2516
01:54:06,739 --> 01:54:08,125
(PARK JUNSEO, 18th place, 1,052,843 points)

2517
01:54:08,149 --> 01:54:11,479
Next is the trainee who placed 17th.

2518
01:54:12,119 --> 01:54:15,648
He'd like to be someone classy and haughty.

2519
01:54:15,649 --> 01:54:16,688
(Trainee in 17th place wants to be classy and haughty.)

2520
01:54:16,689 --> 01:54:17,818
It sounds like YEOJUN.

2521
01:54:17,819 --> 01:54:19,220
I bet his score is very high.

2522
01:54:19,960 --> 01:54:22,159
- Are you haughty? - "Haughty?"

2523
01:54:22,260 --> 01:54:24,430
It's not what I hope for. I'm naturally haughty.

2524
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:26,000
Then it can't be me.

2525
01:54:26,359 --> 01:54:27,568
It could be SEUNGHO.

2526
01:54:27,569 --> 01:54:28,600
(SONG SEUNGHO)

2527
01:54:28,930 --> 01:54:30,270

(The classy youngest, JUNG SEYUN)

2538
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,228
As SEYUN was born in 2007, he's at the age...

2539
01:54:59,229 --> 01:55:00,930
when he needs a lot of sleep.

2540
01:55:01,229 --> 01:55:04,339
As he worked hard, he ranked high.

2541
01:55:04,340 --> 01:55:06,599

(Announcing the trainee in 16th place)

2547
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:20,590
It's a trainee whose charm is speaking in a regional dialect.

2548
01:55:21,250 --> 01:55:23,619
It's time for HYUNWOO to go up.

2549
01:55:23,859 --> 01:55:25,590
I don't know which HYUNWOO it is.

2550
01:55:26,420 --> 01:55:28,159
Could it be me?

2551
01:55:28,729 --> 01:55:29,829
Do you speak in a dialect?

2552
01:55:30,189 --> 01:55:31,329
Good job.

It's KIM HYUNWOO. Congratulations.

2563
01:56:05,699 --> 01:56:07,529
- It was KIM HYUNWOO instead. - Right.

2564
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:11,369
- Despite his leg injury, - You should dance.

2565
01:56:11,439 --> 01:56:13,100
He showed enough of his charms.

2566
01:56:13,500 --> 01:56:15,738
Now that his leg got completely recovered,

2567
01:56:15,739 --> 01:56:18,840
we hope to see him do even better in the next mission.

He's the life of the party.

01:56:39,159 --> 01:56:40,229
It must be JUNWON.

01:58:14,090 --> 01:58:17,429
As soon as PROJECT 7 teaser was released, SONG SEUNGHO...

2614
01:58:17,430 --> 01:58:21,069
became the talk of the town due to his attractive looks.

2615
01:58:21,529 --> 01:58:24,999
Not only does he look handsome, but he also has a strong foundation.

2616
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:26,738
He's a trainee who's ready.

2617
01:58:26,739 --> 01:58:28,246
(SONG SEUNGHO, 14th place 1,557,118 points)

2618
01:58:28,270 --> 01:58:30,479

He's a global trainee with cute looks.

2620
01:58:34,609 --> 01:58:35,779
My gosh.

2621
01:58:36,380 --> 01:58:37,949
Which place were you in before?

2622
01:58:38,119 --> 01:58:39,579
- In 11th place. - What?

2623
01:58:41,090 --> 01:58:42,389
It might be ATILLA.

2624
01:58:42,390 --> 01:58:43,859
(12th, Trainee FONG ATILLA)

2625
01:58:46,359 --> 01:58:47,590
This trainee received...

2626
01:58:48,029 --> 01:58:49,789
a global voting score...

2627
01:58:50,859 --> 01:58:52,059

World Assemblers have been praising him.

2635
01:59:14,850 --> 01:59:17,560
He speaks Korean clearly.

2636
01:59:18,189 --> 01:59:22,029
His body lines are elegant from his ballet training.

2637
01:59:25,359 --> 01:59:27,430
I will now announce the trainee in 12th place.

2638
01:59:28,100 --> 01:59:29,769

2657
02:00:14,010 --> 02:00:15,810
Singing, rapping,

2658

and performance.

2659
02:00:20,279 --> 02:00:21,449
Appearance.

2660
02:00:22,250 --> 02:00:24,489
He's an all-rounder with complete skills.

2661
02:00:24,789 --> 02:00:27,859
He's caught our attention since Zero Setting.

2662
02:00:28,060 --> 02:00:30,060
Is it YICHEN? It could be him.

2663
02:00:30,159 --> 02:00:31,929
It's either HYUNWOO or YICHEN.

2664
02:00:31,930 --> 02:00:34,800
- You're right. It could be HYUNWOO. - HYUNWOO or YICHEN.

2665
02:00:34,930 --> 02:00:36,569
It's either HYUNWOO or YICHEN.

2666
02:00:44,479 --> 02:00:46,539
- He's good. - He's very good.

02:01:11,539 --> 02:01:13,340
KANG HYUNWOO.

2674
02:01:18,279 --> 02:01:19,438
It's YICHEN.

2675
02:01:19,439 --> 02:01:20,439
(11th, Trainee YICHEN)

2676
02:01:21,949 --> 02:01:22,979
My gosh.

2677
02:01:24,020 --> 02:01:26,050
- Is it YICHEN? - It's YICHEN.

2678
02:01:28,119 --> 02:01:29,188

2679
02:01:29,189 --> 02:01:30,858
- YICHEN. - Congratulations.

2680
02:01:30,859 --> 02:01:31,859
Thank you.

2681
02:01:32,289 --> 02:01:34,288
During one of the missions,

2682
02:01:34,289 --> 02:01:36,089
YICHEN was the leader of his team.

2683
02:01:36,090 --> 02:01:38,159
He had a small conflict with his team members.

2684
02:01:39,399 --> 02:01:42,069
After watching the show, his mother who's in China...

2685
02:01:43,130 --> 02:01:46,899
told him, "I didn't raise you that way."

2686
02:01:48,439 --> 02:01:49,840
She gave him a scolding.

2687
02:01:52,939 --> 02:01:55,779
Gosh, really? Oh, my.

2688
02:01:58,420 --> 02:02:00,849
During Position Matching, he was in the center as the main rapper.

2689
02:02:00,850 --> 02:02:03,118
He increased the team's morale,

2690
02:02:03,119 --> 02:02:07,220
and he was recognized again by World Assemblers.

2691
02:02:09,489 --> 02:02:12,399
(1st Passing Ceremony, 11th to 20th place)

2692
02:02:14,729 --> 02:02:15,970
This is ANDY.

2693
02:02:21,140 --> 02:02:23,810
- ANDY, stay strong. - Don't cry.

2694
02:02:24,909 --> 02:02:26,340
- Don't cry. - Don't cry.

2695
02:02:27,079 --> 02:02:29,449
ANDY!

2696

ANDY.

2697
02:02:32,050 --> 02:02:33,279
Are you okay?

2698
02:02:34,090 --> 02:02:37,319
I lack in many ways, but you still believed in me.

2699
02:02:37,720 --> 02:02:41,359
I'd like to thank World Assemblers from the bottom of my heart...

2700
02:02:41,460 --> 02:02:44,359
for voting for me.

2701
02:02:47,430 --> 02:02:50,000
On PROJECT 7,

2702
02:02:52,439 --> 02:02:55,510
I still haven't shown you all of me.

2703
02:02:55,840 --> 02:02:57,579
I wanted to survive no matter what.

2704
02:02:58,210 --> 02:03:01,510
I was hoping to perform better...

2705
02:03:01,949 --> 02:03:03,278
during the next performance.

2706
02:03:03,279 --> 02:03:06,380
I'm so happy and thankful that I made the cut.

2707
02:03:12,090 --> 02:03:14,590
Hello, I'm KIM HYUNWOO.

2708
02:03:14,890 --> 02:03:19,229
First of all, I'd like to thank World Assemblers.

2709
02:03:20,029 --> 02:03:23,829
As I couldn't perform during Position Matching,

2710
02:03:24,439 --> 02:03:28,239
I'm quite embarrassed to be ranked...

2711
02:03:28,840 --> 02:03:30,909
so high.

2712
02:03:31,479 --> 02:03:35,148
Starting with the next match, I won't make you regret...

2713
02:03:35,149 --> 02:03:36,909
choosing me.

2714
02:03:37,380 --> 02:03:39,519
I'll do my best to stand here...

2715
02:03:39,520 --> 02:03:41,119
with dignity. Thank you.

2716
02:03:44,359 --> 02:03:46,159
Hello, I'm NAM JIWOON.

2717
02:03:46,859 --> 02:03:49,028
Instead of showing you my good side,

2718
02:03:49,029 --> 02:03:51,300
I showed qualities that I lacked.

2719
02:03:51,500 --> 02:03:54,528
Despite that, you believed in me.

2720
02:03:54,529 --> 02:03:57,970
Thank you so much for voting for me.

2721
02:03:58,239 --> 02:04:01,238
There's something I'd like to say to YONGHYUN.

2722
02:04:01,239 --> 02:04:03,238
I meant to say it during the interview,

2723
02:04:03,239 --> 02:04:04,810
but I'll say it now.

2724
02:04:05,609 --> 02:04:07,108
I love you, YONGHYUN.

2725
02:04:07,109 --> 02:04:08,250
I love you.

2726
02:04:09,510 --> 02:04:10,919
I love you too.

2727
02:04:10,920 --> 02:04:11,949
Me too.

2728
02:04:12,880 --> 02:04:14,789
I will now announce the assembling results...

2729
02:04:15,689 --> 02:04:19,060
of the trainees ranked from 11th to 20th.

2730
02:04:19,689 --> 02:04:21,289
I hope any one of them will join us.

2731
02:04:22,289 --> 02:04:23,590
Everyone is so good.

2732
02:04:24,060 --> 02:04:25,960

(Only one vacant seat in A1)

2736
02:04:35,369 --> 02:04:39,479
(Which slot will be assembled first?)

2737
02:04:39,880 --> 02:04:41,710
- Us? - Our team?

2738
02:04:45,050 --> 02:04:46,818
Among the ten of you,

2739
02:04:46,819 --> 02:04:49,449
the last trainee to join A1 is...

2740
02:04:50,789 --> 02:04:52,289
It might be JUNSEO.

2741
02:04:55,130 --> 02:04:57,828
It's Trainee KWON YONGHYUN in 20th place.

2742
02:04:57,829 --> 02:05:00,260
(Trainee KWON YONGHYUN is placed into A1.)

2743
02:05:02,600 --> 02:05:05,369
My gosh, he's an ace.

2744
02:05:05,739 --> 02:05:06,970
We lost him.

2745
02:05:07,840 --> 02:05:09,539
We lost the vocalist.

2746
02:05:10,909 --> 02:05:12,180
We have a vocalist.

2747
02:05:15,380 --> 02:05:17,720
I look forward to working with you.

2748
02:05:18,079 --> 02:05:20,549
- Hello. - I look forward to it.

2749
02:05:20,550 --> 02:05:22,318
As KWON YONGHYUN as the last trainee,

2750
02:05:22,319 --> 02:05:26,720
A1 is the first to be assembled.

2751
02:05:27,119 --> 02:05:28,728
Team A1 has...

2752
02:05:28,729 --> 02:05:32,199
a group of vocalists who can sing high notes.

2753
02:05:32,359 --> 02:05:33,630
That's what I thought.

2754
02:05:34,729 --> 02:05:37,669
Now, I'll call out the trainee...

2755
02:05:37,670 --> 02:05:39,170
to join A3.

2756
02:05:39,770 --> 02:05:42,909

A total of 3 trainees were assembled to join A3.

2764
02:06:07,770 --> 02:06:09,729
A3 is the strongest team.

2765
02:06:09,869 --> 02:06:11,439
Strong trainees are coming.

2766
02:06:11,739 --> 02:06:13,000

Four trainees including two global trainees...

2774
02:06:38,560 --> 02:06:40,159
were assembled to join one team.

2775
02:06:40,829 --> 02:06:43,170
The four trainees were assembled to join...

2776
02:06:43,569 --> 02:06:45,500
- A... - It could be our team.

2777
02:06:45,699 --> 02:06:46,938
We have four seats left.

2778
02:06:46,939 --> 02:06:48,239
There are exactly four.

2779
02:06:48,640 --> 02:06:49,739
It has to be us.

2780
02:06:50,270 --> 02:06:51,539
There are exactly four.

2781
02:06:52,539 --> 02:06:54,880

02:07:04,250 --> 02:07:05,759
That team got completed in one go.

2787
02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:07,289
- What? - In one go.

2788
02:07:07,789 --> 02:07:11,100
As a result, A4 has been assembled.

2789
02:07:12,329 --> 02:07:14,368
We're trendy, and we have personality.

2790
02:07:14,369 --> 02:07:17,068
The members of our team...

2791
02:07:17,069 --> 02:07:19,000
also have a popular appeal.

2792
02:07:20,369 --> 02:07:21,810
The remaining teams are...

2793
02:07:22,170 --> 02:07:24,979
A2, A3,

2794
02:07:25,880 --> 02:07:27,479
and A5.

2795
02:07:28,579 --> 02:07:31,420
I'll announce where the remaining trainees will join.

2796
02:07:33,880 --> 02:07:35,649
Don't you think HYUNWOO will join us?

2797
02:07:35,750 --> 02:07:37,550
I think that he will.

2798
02:07:39,460 --> 02:07:42,259
Both Trainee FONG ATILLA in 13th place...

2799
02:07:42,260 --> 02:07:44,460
and Trainee KIM HYUNWOO in 16th place...

2800
02:07:45,199 --> 02:07:46,260
will join...

2801
02:07:46,899 --> 02:07:48,869
- A2. - A2.

2802
02:07:49,130 --> 02:07:50,199
A2.

2803
02:07:51,140 --> 02:07:54,069
They will join A2.

2804
02:07:54,510 --> 02:07:55,809
(KIM HYUNWOO and FONG ATILLA join A2.)

2805
02:07:55,810 --> 02:07:57,270
Nice.

2806
02:07:57,439 --> 02:07:59,778
FONG ATILLA and KIM HYUNWOO.

2807
02:07:59,779 --> 02:08:01,299
(KIM HYUNWOO and FONG ATILLA join A2.)

2808
02:08:05,720 --> 02:08:08,090
- My goodness. - Gosh.

2809
02:08:09,250 --> 02:08:11,060
My gosh, SVIAT.

2810
02:08:11,619 --> 02:08:13,520
- Gosh. - My goodness.

2811
02:08:14,020 --> 02:08:15,420
I look forward to working with you.

2812
02:08:15,989 --> 02:08:18,198
PROJECT 7, the first Passing Ceremony.

2813
02:08:18,199 --> 02:08:21,699
The ranking of 98 trainees have been revealed.

2814
02:08:22,170 --> 02:08:23,569
We have ten people left.

2815
02:08:23,770 --> 02:08:25,800
- We have seven people left. - Right.

2816
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:27,746
Won't all trainees from the first place join A3?

2817
02:08:27,770 --> 02:08:28,840
I know.

2818
02:08:28,909 --> 02:08:31,238
I will be announcing the ranking...

2819
02:08:31,239 --> 02:08:33,579
of trainees in the highest rank.

2820
02:08:33,710 --> 02:08:35,250
Before that,

2821
02:08:35,449 --> 02:08:37,448
this is the last video...

2822
02:08:37,449 --> 02:08:39,049
for the World Assemblers.

2823
02:08:39,050 --> 02:08:40,149
Take a look.

2824
02:08:43,020 --> 02:08:45,189
(It's the middle of the night at Project Village.)

2825
02:08:46,590 --> 02:08:50,060
(A special time given to the trainees)

2826
02:08:50,590 --> 02:08:54,899
(Whose voice do they want to hear the most at this moment?)

2827
02:08:55,170 --> 02:08:56,630
- Hello? - Mom?

2828
02:08:56,899 --> 02:08:58,898
YECHAN,

2829
02:08:58,899 --> 02:09:00,340
- how did you call me? - What?

2830
02:09:00,569 --> 02:09:02,310
- Mom. - Yes?

2831
02:09:02,439 --> 02:09:03,510
It's me, SEUNGHO.

2832
02:09:03,739 --> 02:09:05,340
SEUNGHO.

2833
02:09:05,439 --> 02:09:06,779
- Is that you? - Yes.

2834
02:09:07,140 --> 02:09:08,409
Hello?

2835
02:09:08,810 --> 02:09:09,909
Mom.

2836
02:09:10,250 --> 02:09:12,149
- Who's this? - It's JEONGMIN.

2837
02:09:12,680 --> 02:09:14,989
- Why are you crying? - I miss you.

2838
02:09:15,350 --> 02:09:16,789
- Is it difficult? - Yes.

2839
02:09:17,720 --> 02:09:18,819
I'm sorry to hear that.

2840
02:09:19,289 --> 02:09:21,329
But we're filming right now.

2841
02:09:21,390 --> 02:09:23,989
- Okay. - We can't say anything strange.

2842
02:09:26,500 --> 02:09:28,229
- JEONGMIN. - Yes?

2843
02:09:28,430 --> 02:09:29,510
Are you having a hard time?

2844
02:09:30,869 --> 02:09:32,568
Is there anything you'd like to eat at home?

2845
02:09:32,569 --> 02:09:34,169
Shall I prepare you something delicious?

2846
02:09:34,270 --> 02:09:35,439
How about some ribs?

2847
02:09:35,840 --> 02:09:36,840
No.

2848
02:09:36,841 --> 02:09:38,238
I want some pork belly.

2849
02:09:38,239 --> 02:09:39,439
Pork belly?

2850
02:09:39,710 --> 02:09:41,779
Mom, I'm craving some ramyeon.

2851
02:09:41,979 --> 02:09:44,449
I miss your cooking so much.

2852
02:09:45,079 --> 02:09:47,949
I miss the last meal...

2853
02:09:48,649 --> 02:09:49,649
that you made for me.

2854
02:09:50,050 --> 02:09:51,119
Mom?

2855
02:09:51,390 --> 02:09:53,459
Yes, how is it going?

2856
02:09:53,460 --> 02:09:55,659
I'm working hard...

2857
02:09:56,489 --> 02:09:57,788
right now.

2858
02:09:57,789 --> 02:10:00,028
I'm eating a lot.

2859
02:10:00,029 --> 02:10:02,130
I'm eating much more than before.

2860
02:10:02,329 --> 02:10:04,270
- Hello? - Mom?

2861
02:10:05,270 --> 02:10:07,140
- Gosh. - Mom.

2862
02:10:08,539 --> 02:10:09,539
What's wrong?

2863
02:10:14,279 --> 02:10:15,949
It's very stressful.

2864
02:10:17,109 --> 02:10:18,778
Really? Why?

2865
02:10:18,779 --> 02:10:20,779
My son, don't get stressed out so much.

2866
02:10:20,949 --> 02:10:23,390
Don't take it so seriously.

2867
02:10:23,590 --> 02:10:25,019
When you come back,

2868
02:10:25,020 --> 02:10:27,890
even if you get eliminated, we'll come and pick you up.

2869
02:10:28,689 --> 02:10:33,198
Your entire family is...

2870
02:10:33,199 --> 02:10:37,470
your huge fan, and we're rooting for you.

2871
02:10:37,699 --> 02:10:41,270
Every day, I hope that your dream...

2872
02:10:41,840 --> 02:10:43,270
will come true.

2873
02:10:50,750 --> 02:10:52,079
The number you have dialed...

2874
02:10:53,720 --> 02:10:55,850
(His mom isn't picking up the phone.)

2875
02:10:56,890 --> 02:11:01,020
Hello? She doesn't pick up.

2876
02:11:01,630 --> 02:11:05,260
(He calls his sister instead of his mom.)

2877
02:11:07,130 --> 02:11:10,169
- I love you. - I love you, too.

2878
02:11:10,170 --> 02:11:11,568
Good luck.

2879
02:11:11,569 --> 02:11:14,000
I have to go. I love you.

2880
02:11:14,300 --> 02:11:17,340
(He couldn't hear his mom's voice.)

2881
02:11:17,710 --> 02:11:19,979
You'll do well in whatever you do.

2882
02:11:20,439 --> 02:11:23,880
It isn't difficult, but it's certainly not easy.

2883
02:11:24,619 --> 02:11:26,180
It's full of talented people here.

2884
02:11:26,420 --> 02:11:28,789
Of course. There must be a lot.

2885
02:11:29,819 --> 02:11:31,890
Among them, you're doing well too.

2886
02:11:33,659 --> 02:11:35,289
Just enjoy it, HEEJU.

2887
02:11:35,859 --> 02:11:39,060
- Okay. - Enjoy it as much as you can.

2888
02:11:40,199 --> 02:11:41,329
Are you crying?

2889
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:43,029
Are you crying?

2890
02:11:43,970 --> 02:11:45,270
I miss you so much.

2891
02:11:45,869 --> 02:11:47,238
What do you mean?

2892
02:11:47,239 --> 02:11:48,469
Aren't you having fun over there?

2893
02:11:48,470 --> 02:11:49,640
It's so difficult.

2894
02:11:50,069 --> 02:11:51,140
It's so difficult?

2895
02:11:51,880 --> 02:11:53,608
Gosh, why would you cry?

2896
02:11:53,609 --> 02:11:55,680
You're doing what you want. It should be fun.

2897
02:11:56,649 --> 02:11:58,920
You won't be able to serve in the military.

2898
02:12:00,279 --> 02:12:03,019
Other guys called their mom first.

2899
02:12:03,020 --> 02:12:05,619
They cried because they haven't talked to their mom in a while.

2900
02:12:06,760 --> 02:12:07,859
Why would they cry?

2901
02:12:08,359 --> 02:12:09,919
Because they were talking to their mom.

2902
02:12:11,600 --> 02:12:12,828
I don't see why they would cry.

2903
02:12:12,829 --> 02:12:14,260
I mean...

2904
02:12:14,560 --> 02:12:15,669
- SEUNG, - Yes?

2905
02:12:15,670 --> 02:12:18,699
Don't laugh like this in front of the camera.

2906
02:12:19,069 --> 02:12:22,169
You should be careful of how you act.

2907
02:12:22,170 --> 02:12:23,210
(Mom, I'm already...)

2908
02:12:23,270 --> 02:12:26,180
You look like a mystic prince,

2909
02:12:26,239 --> 02:12:28,608
so act like one, okay?

2910
02:12:28,609 --> 02:12:29,680
Okay.

2911
02:12:30,109 --> 02:12:32,119
- Hello? - Mom!

2912
02:12:32,350 --> 02:12:33,419
SEOKHEE.

2913
02:12:33,420 --> 02:12:35,050
They gave us time to talk on the phone.

2914
02:12:35,149 --> 02:12:38,590
I miss you, my son.

2915
02:12:38,619 --> 02:12:39,959
You can't come home.

2916
02:12:39,960 --> 02:12:41,158
I won't come home.

2917
02:12:41,159 --> 02:12:43,528
- I'll try my best to survive. - Yes.

2918
02:12:43,529 --> 02:12:45,129
You'll be busted if you come home.

2919
02:12:45,130 --> 02:12:46,159
I know.

2920
02:12:46,260 --> 02:12:48,800
Did you hear that? I'll be busted if I come home.

2921
02:12:50,569 --> 02:12:52,069
I have good skills,

2922
02:12:52,640 --> 02:12:54,439
but here's the problem.

2923
02:12:56,340 --> 02:12:59,009
I still haven't been able...

2924
02:12:59,010 --> 02:13:00,510
to prove myself to them.

2925
02:13:02,750 --> 02:13:04,850
It'll be worse if you feel pressed,

2926
02:13:05,279 --> 02:13:06,819
so relax.

2927
02:13:07,119 --> 02:13:09,318
- Okay. - Then you'll show off your skills.

2928
02:13:09,319 --> 02:13:11,090
Then you won't regret it later.

2929
02:13:11,119 --> 02:13:13,359
I'll give it a try.

2930
02:13:14,359 --> 02:13:16,728
It's great to hear that voice.

2931
02:13:16,729 --> 02:13:18,099
I'm tearing up.

2932
02:13:18,100 --> 02:13:20,499
- I love you, my son. - I love you too.

2933
02:13:20,500 --> 02:13:22,329
I need to go. I don't have much time.

2934
02:13:22,430 --> 02:13:24,299
Okay, I love you so much.

2935
02:13:24,300 --> 02:13:26,139
- Sleep well. - Bye.

2936
02:13:26,140 --> 02:13:27,170
Bye.

2937
02:13:27,869 --> 02:13:29,970
My parents are probably sleeping.

2938
02:13:32,010 --> 02:13:33,739
- Hello? - Hello?

2939
02:13:34,010 --> 02:13:35,850
- Who is this? - It's me.

2940
02:13:36,350 --> 02:13:37,409
Hey.

2941
02:13:38,920 --> 02:13:42,489
There are many trainees here.

2942
02:13:42,890 --> 02:13:44,719
They're full of energy,

2943
02:13:44,720 --> 02:13:46,890
young, and talented.

2944
02:13:47,520 --> 02:13:49,390
From seeing them,

2945
02:13:50,529 --> 02:13:52,229
many thoughts cross my mind.

2946
02:13:53,659 --> 02:13:54,869
I...

2947
02:13:59,199 --> 02:14:02,239
may not be someone...

2948
02:14:04,569 --> 02:14:06,640
as good as I thought.

2949
02:14:09,210 --> 02:14:10,449
That's not true.

2950
02:14:12,979 --> 02:14:15,850
There is the time you've been doing that so far.

2951
02:14:17,090 --> 02:14:18,420
That won't disappear so easily.

2952
02:14:20,359 --> 02:14:22,689
Don't think you're not as good as them.

2953
02:14:25,399 --> 02:14:27,960
You should also pour out what you've been doing so far.

2954
02:14:33,340 --> 02:14:34,869
I should pull myself together again.

2955
02:14:35,340 --> 02:14:36,470
Yes. You can do it.

2956
02:14:39,079 --> 02:14:43,279
(The one goal of debuting)

2957
02:14:44,710 --> 02:14:48,289
(The trainees run toward that goal.)

2958
02:14:48,890 --> 02:14:50,089
(I'll practice pronunciation harder. I should work harder.)

2959
02:14:50,090 --> 02:14:52,788
I always thought I wanted an opportunity.

2960
02:14:52,789 --> 02:14:55,159
And I thought this was my opportunity.

2961
02:14:57,189 --> 02:15:00,828
I'm very worried that I may be causing harm to the team.

2962
02:15:00,829 --> 02:15:02,746
(I should do my best while waiting for the stage I dreamed of.)

2963
02:15:02,770 --> 02:15:06,140
I'll do my best and show you a good performance.

2964
02:15:07,500 --> 02:15:09,770
I'll show you a good performance...

2965
02:15:10,340 --> 02:15:11,509
and improvement.

2966
02:15:11,510 --> 02:15:13,755
(I got the song "Kiwi," and thankfully I became the leader.)

2967
02:15:13,779 --> 02:15:15,409
I'll shine here.

2968
02:15:15,850 --> 02:15:18,549
I'll come back as a different NAM JIWOON.

2969
02:15:18,550 --> 02:15:20,719
(It's scary as elimination comes nearer, but I'll win and survive.)

2970
02:15:20,720 --> 02:15:22,649
My goal is to debut.

2971
02:15:23,949 --> 02:15:26,220
I'll try to show you my worth.

2972
02:15:26,789 --> 02:15:29,489
My knees, back, neck, and head.

2973
02:15:30,130 --> 02:15:32,500
I'll go for it even if all those break.

2974
02:15:33,159 --> 02:15:35,899
I'll do my best.

2975
02:15:36,100 --> 02:15:37,300
Let's go.

2976
02:15:38,739 --> 02:15:39,899
Thank you.

2977
02:15:43,170 --> 02:15:44,938
(YOO YOUNGSEO: I've been doing well and will do better.)

2978
02:15:44,939 --> 02:15:46,709
(NAM JIWOON: I'll become the 1st. KWON YONGHYUN: 1st, let's go!)

2979
02:15:46,710 --> 02:15:48,478
(KWON YANGWOO: Let's do better and go up!)

2980
02:15:48,479 --> 02:15:49,749
(AHN JUNWON: All the best until the debut!)

2981
02:15:49,750 --> 02:15:51,186
(KIM TAESUNG: Let's practice like crazy not to leave any regrets!)

2982
02:15:51,210 --> 02:15:53,679
Now, I'll announce the ranks...

2983
02:15:53,680 --> 02:15:55,649
of the trainees who have the highest ranks.

2984
02:15:56,220 --> 02:15:57,549
Three people at a time?

2985
02:15:57,550 --> 02:15:58,819
From 8th to 10th?

2986
02:15:59,359 --> 02:16:00,889
Those 3 who rank from 8th to 10th?

2987
02:16:00,890 --> 02:16:02,289
Since it's PROJECT 7.

2988
02:16:02,659 --> 02:16:05,500
Since I'm in the top ten,

2989
02:16:05,659 --> 02:16:07,499
- I want to be in the top seven too. - I know.

2990
02:16:07,930 --> 02:16:09,930
That's how our greed works.

2991
02:16:10,699 --> 02:16:13,369
First, I'll announce the trainee in tenth place.

2992
02:16:13,699 --> 02:16:14,739
HYUNWOO?

2993
02:16:15,210 --> 02:16:16,869
MINSUNG?

2994
02:16:17,369 --> 02:16:20,908
He got an S rank in the first project, Title Song,

2995
02:16:20,909 --> 02:16:21,948
(2nd place: SAKURADA KENSHIN, Week 2 ranking)

2996
02:16:21,949 --> 02:16:23,049
KENSHIN?

2997
02:16:23,050 --> 02:16:24,550
- Is it me? - KIM SUNGMIN?

2998
02:16:25,050 --> 02:16:28,390
This trainee received a global voting score...

2999
02:16:29,520 --> 02:16:31,449
of 1,636,021 points.

3000
02:16:31,989 --> 02:16:32,989
That's a lot.

3001
02:16:33,319 --> 02:16:34,389
It's one of the three.

3002
02:16:35,159 --> 02:16:37,489
Trainee KANG MINSEO. Congratulations.

3003
02:16:38,260 --> 02:16:39,459
Let's go.

3004
02:16:40,899 --> 02:16:42,700
KANG MINSEO.

3005
02:16:42,770 --> 02:16:45,599
Trainee KANG MINSEO has a cute duck-like face,

3006
02:16:45,600 --> 02:16:47,499
but he showed moments as a strong type T.

3007
02:16:47,500 --> 02:16:50,840
He's receiving support from World Assemblers for that charm.

3008
02:16:52,079 --> 02:16:53,379
He hurt his leg.

3009
02:16:53,780 --> 02:16:54,879
He's a dancing member.

3010
02:16:55,350 --> 02:16:59,180
Finally, I'll announce the single-digit rankings.

3011
02:16:59,979 --> 02:17:02,388
- Ninth. - The trainee in ninth place.

3012
02:17:02,389 --> 02:17:03,420
Who would it be?

3013
02:17:03,649 --> 02:17:07,020
- He cries a lot. - Me?

3014
02:17:11,059 --> 02:17:14,559
(Trainee BINGHUA showed tears.)

3015
02:17:14,899 --> 02:17:16,406
What are you doing, BINGHUA? Aren't you going to get up?

3016
02:17:16,430 --> 02:17:18,029
Isn't it KYOUNGBAE?

3017
02:17:18,030 --> 02:17:20,539
KYOUNGBAE cried in every preview.

3018
02:17:20,540 --> 02:17:21,610
Really?

3019
02:17:23,840 --> 02:17:28,780
(Trainee SEO KYOUNGBAE was always in tears.)

3020
02:17:29,579 --> 02:17:30,750
It's so hard.

3021
02:17:31,209 --> 02:17:33,549
- Don't cry. - But...

3022
02:17:34,920 --> 02:17:36,090
No.

3023
02:17:37,049 --> 02:17:38,290
This trainee received...

3024
02:17:38,959 --> 02:17:40,889
a global voting score of 169,000...

3025
02:17:41,190 --> 02:17:43,270
That would be the population of a metropolitan city.

3026
02:17:43,659 --> 02:17:46,299
1,698,883 points.

3027
02:17:47,360 --> 02:17:50,030
It's Trainee BINGHUA. Congratulations.

3028
02:17:50,670 --> 02:17:52,968
BINGHUA.

3029
02:17:52,969 --> 02:17:54,000
He would debut.

3030
02:17:55,170 --> 02:17:56,909
- I want to be on the same team. - Me too.

3031
02:17:57,139 --> 02:17:58,479
I'll go first.

3032
02:17:59,409 --> 02:18:02,579
BINGHUA got Tier One in the title song.

3033
02:18:03,350 --> 02:18:07,180
He was the center in Team "Love wins all" during the position match.

3034
02:18:07,280 --> 02:18:09,190
His team came in first place.

3035
02:18:09,590 --> 02:18:11,349
He's been receiving a good result.

3036
02:18:11,350 --> 02:18:13,719
We'll look forward to your performance in the next project.

3037
02:18:15,290 --> 02:18:16,659
I need to follow BINGHUA.

3038
02:18:17,930 --> 02:18:20,559
I will now announce the trainee in 8th place.

3039
02:18:21,670 --> 02:18:22,930
I'm so nervous.

3040
02:18:25,870 --> 02:18:26,899
No.

3041
02:18:27,200 --> 02:18:28,200
Don't get scared.

3042
02:18:28,809 --> 02:18:32,180
He's the self-proclaimed and approved all-rounder of PROJECT 7.

3043
02:18:32,879 --> 02:18:34,139
It's either HYUNWOO or SIHUN.

3044
02:18:34,979 --> 02:18:37,549
He's a trainee who is reattempting for the survival.

3045
02:18:38,010 --> 02:18:39,020
JANG YEOJUN?

3046
02:18:39,219 --> 02:18:40,719
I guess it's YEOJUN.

3047
02:18:40,979 --> 02:18:41,989
Is it YEOJUN?

3048
02:18:42,290 --> 02:18:43,888
- It's either you or me. - I want to go first.

3049
02:18:43,889 --> 02:18:44,920
It's either you or me.

3050
02:18:45,459 --> 02:18:47,120
- I think it's me. - Me...

3051
02:18:47,959 --> 02:18:49,260
This trainee received...

3052
02:18:49,989 --> 02:18:51,829
a global voting score of 170,000...

3053
02:18:53,030 --> 02:18:54,159
A score over 170,000.

3054
02:18:54,829 --> 02:18:56,929
1,701,936 points.

3055
02:18:56,930 --> 02:18:58,570
(Global voting score of 1,701,936 points)

3056
02:18:58,799 --> 02:19:00,539
It's Trainee KANG HYUNWOO.

3057
02:19:00,540 --> 02:19:02,239
- KANG HYUNWOO. - Congratulations.

3058
02:19:03,209 --> 02:19:04,409
Thank you.

3059
02:19:06,780 --> 02:19:08,180
HYUNWOO's rank is really high.

3060
02:19:08,809 --> 02:19:12,180
Trainee KANG HYUNWOO is an all-rounder.

3061
02:19:12,350 --> 02:19:14,548
In the Title Song evaluation, he showed us his dance skills...

3062
02:19:14,549 --> 02:19:17,290
and in the Position Match, he showed us his vocal skills.

3063
02:19:17,950 --> 02:19:21,790
He proved to the World Assemblers that he was a main vocalist.

3064
02:19:25,159 --> 02:19:28,430
The trainee in tenth place can say a word first.

3065
02:19:28,799 --> 02:19:31,870
It wasn't an easy decision...

3066
02:19:31,899 --> 02:19:33,899
to join a survival program again.

3067
02:19:34,469 --> 02:19:36,610
I really thank my P1 and Closer members...

3068
02:19:36,909 --> 02:19:38,879
who covered my weaknesses...

3069
02:19:38,940 --> 02:19:41,280
and helped me improve.

3070
02:19:41,379 --> 02:19:44,709
I also thank the World Assemblers who voted for me.

3071
02:19:47,579 --> 02:19:51,190
First, I really thank the World Assemblers...

3072
02:19:51,450 --> 02:19:52,989
who voted for me.

3073
02:19:53,389 --> 02:19:54,690
Thank you.

3074
02:19:56,260 --> 02:19:57,389
Right now, I...

3075
02:19:58,559 --> 02:20:00,100
(BINGHUA)

3076
02:20:00,159 --> 02:20:04,000
There are many P4 members who are sitting here.

3077
02:20:06,100 --> 02:20:07,469
So I feel very nervous now.

3078
02:20:07,840 --> 02:20:09,770
I want us to...

3079
02:20:13,280 --> 02:20:14,978
- Don't cry. - Don't cry.

3080
02:20:14,979 --> 02:20:16,879
- BINGHUA. - Don't cry.

3081
02:20:18,379 --> 02:20:20,219
I was really happy...

3082
02:20:20,819 --> 02:20:22,090
being with the P4 members.

3083
02:20:22,149 --> 02:20:23,620
Thank you so much.

3084
02:20:24,889 --> 02:20:26,659
Thank you for supporting me.

3085
02:20:27,290 --> 02:20:29,659
There's something I want to say to my parents.

3086
02:20:30,829 --> 02:20:33,658
I really miss you, and I'm doing well here.

3087
02:20:33,659 --> 02:20:34,898
Everyone is so nice to me.

3088
02:20:34,899 --> 02:20:37,469
I'm eating well and sleeping well.

3089
02:20:37,600 --> 02:20:40,899
I'll keep going, so don't worry about me.

3090
02:20:41,500 --> 02:20:44,808
I'll work harder from now on.

3091
02:20:44,809 --> 02:20:45,839
Thank you.

3092
02:20:45,840 --> 02:20:47,279
(MAJINGXIANG)

3093
02:20:47,280 --> 02:20:48,280
That was cool.

3094
02:20:49,409 --> 02:20:51,308
I didn't receive high ranks that much...

3095
02:20:51,309 --> 02:20:53,219
when I was in survival programs.

3096
02:20:53,250 --> 02:20:55,818
I did my best so far...

3097
02:20:55,819 --> 02:20:59,488
thinking I wanted to achieve that rank.

3098
02:20:59,489 --> 02:21:01,929
But it doesn't feel as good as I thought...

3099
02:21:01,930 --> 02:21:04,589
being in this position.

3100
02:21:04,590 --> 02:21:07,959
If I rise to a certain position,

3101
02:21:08,229 --> 02:21:10,029
someone else wouldn't be able...

3102
02:21:10,030 --> 02:21:11,999
to be in that position...

3103
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:13,270
since it's survival.

3104
02:21:13,639 --> 02:21:15,770
I hope I don't make it unfair for those people.

3105
02:21:16,110 --> 02:21:19,808
I'll do my best so that...

3106
02:21:19,809 --> 02:21:23,350
everyone would acknowledge my effort. Thank you.

3107
02:21:28,319 --> 02:21:31,790
From now on, I will announce the assembling results one by one.

3108
02:21:32,760 --> 02:21:34,589
The trainees can all turn behind.

3109
02:21:34,590 --> 02:21:35,628
(A2: 3 spots, A3: 7 spots, A5: 1 spot)

3110
02:21:35,629 --> 02:21:38,389
Please. Anyone can come. I'd be thankful.

3111
02:21:39,600 --> 02:21:41,960
Trainee KANG MINSEO in tenth place was assembled to join...

3112
02:21:42,770 --> 02:21:43,930
I think he'll come here.

3113
02:21:44,729 --> 02:21:46,489
Hold on. Why do I feel like he'll come here?

3114
02:21:47,469 --> 02:21:49,468
A3.

3115
02:21:49,469 --> 02:21:51,069
(Trainee KANG MINSEO is placed into A3.)

3116
02:21:53,379 --> 02:21:55,309
A3.

3117
02:21:55,950 --> 02:21:57,680
Please move to A3.

3118
02:22:00,420 --> 02:22:01,920
I thought he would come here.

3119
02:22:02,420 --> 02:22:03,620
Maybe they'll all go there.

3120
02:22:04,690 --> 02:22:05,810
Please take good care of me.

3121
02:22:06,389 --> 02:22:07,520
Welcome.

3122
02:22:08,860 --> 02:22:11,389
- Why did you get your feet hurt? - I don't know.

3123
02:22:12,899 --> 02:22:14,899
- He's good-looking. - Next is Trainee BINGHUA...

3124
02:22:15,870 --> 02:22:17,599
in ninth place.

3125
02:22:17,600 --> 02:22:19,239
Trainee BINGHUA was assembled to join...

3126
02:22:19,670 --> 02:22:20,670
BINGHUA.

3127
02:22:21,600 --> 02:22:22,770
I hope he comes here.

3128
02:22:24,110 --> 02:22:25,239
A3.

3129
02:22:25,879 --> 02:22:27,439
Please move to A3.

3130
02:22:27,440 --> 02:22:28,880
(Trainee BINGHUA is placed into A3.)

3131
02:22:28,909 --> 02:22:30,149
A3.

3132
02:22:30,709 --> 02:22:32,849
- Please move to A3. - No.

3133
02:22:32,850 --> 02:22:35,119
This isn't right.

3134
02:22:35,120 --> 02:22:36,120
Hold on.

3135
02:22:36,319 --> 02:22:38,549
BINGHUA.

3136
02:22:38,590 --> 02:22:39,590
Let's go.

3137
02:22:39,889 --> 02:22:41,020
BINGHUA.

3138
02:22:42,260 --> 02:22:43,530
You're too good.

3139
02:22:43,930 --> 02:22:45,500
HYUNWOO might also join A3.

3140
02:22:46,299 --> 02:22:50,399
I will announce the assembling results of Trainee KANG HYUNWOO.

3141
02:22:50,870 --> 02:22:53,670
Will we be having all of them join A3?

3142
02:22:54,170 --> 02:22:55,239
I hope HYUNWOO comes here.

3143
02:22:55,809 --> 02:22:57,110
I hope HYUNWOO comes here.

3144
02:22:57,469 --> 02:22:58,709
I hope he comes here.

3145
02:22:59,739 --> 02:23:01,540
Trainee KANG HYUNWOO was assembled to join...

3146
02:23:06,520 --> 02:23:07,578
A3.

3147
02:23:07,579 --> 02:23:09,619
(Trainee KANG HYUNWOO is placed into A3.)

3148
02:23:09,620 --> 02:23:12,219
- Please move to A3. - What is this?

3149
02:23:12,559 --> 02:23:13,620
A3.

3150
02:23:14,090 --> 02:23:15,290
He's in A3?

3151
02:23:15,590 --> 02:23:17,529
Hold on.

3152
02:23:17,530 --> 02:23:19,799
Give us someone too.

3153
02:23:20,659 --> 02:23:22,829
- We meet here again. - I missed you.

3154
02:23:23,170 --> 02:23:24,828
- Hello. - Hello.

3155
02:23:24,829 --> 02:23:25,940
It's been a while, SEUNGHO.

3156
02:23:26,540 --> 02:23:27,969
That's a disaster.

3157
02:23:28,399 --> 02:23:29,468
A3 is too hard to beat.

3158
02:23:29,469 --> 02:23:30,770
They have HYUNWOO and everyone.

3159
02:23:31,340 --> 02:23:33,940
The three who just joined A3 can crush us.

3160
02:23:35,010 --> 02:23:36,079
It's okay.

3161
02:23:36,809 --> 02:23:38,209
We still have four spots.

3162
02:23:38,680 --> 02:23:39,750
Four?

3163
02:23:40,920 --> 02:23:44,520
I will now announce the rank of the next trainee.

3164
02:23:45,319 --> 02:23:47,218
The trainees whose names will be called from now on...

3165
02:23:47,219 --> 02:23:49,659
are very close to debuting.

3166
02:23:50,360 --> 02:23:52,260
Their global voting scores...

3167
02:23:52,500 --> 02:23:54,029
are above two million points.

3168
02:23:54,030 --> 02:23:56,370
(Global voting scores of above 2 million points)

3169
02:23:56,930 --> 02:23:58,199
It's two million points.

3170
02:23:58,200 --> 02:23:59,239
What?

3171
02:24:00,170 --> 02:24:01,269
Ten times of my votes.

3172
02:24:01,270 --> 02:24:02,509
(OH YOUNGWOONG: 223,039 points)

3173
02:24:02,510 --> 02:24:05,679
We'll soon be announcing the person...

3174
02:24:05,680 --> 02:24:07,309
who ranked first in PROJECT 7.

3175
02:24:07,479 --> 02:24:09,649
Among the seven trainees I'll announce now,

3176
02:24:09,750 --> 02:24:12,148
we have the trainee who ranked first.

3177
02:24:12,149 --> 02:24:13,378
(The 1st Passing Ceremony, 1st place to 7th place)

3178
02:24:13,379 --> 02:24:14,879
It's the debut rankings from now on.

3179
02:24:15,950 --> 02:24:18,090
I was most curious about this.

3180
02:24:18,819 --> 02:24:21,090
It's like a league of their own.

3181
02:24:21,260 --> 02:24:23,389
The first candidate in the first place...

3182
02:24:23,760 --> 02:24:25,289
that the World Assemblers chose.

3183
02:24:25,290 --> 02:24:27,010
(The 1st top 7 are finally being revealed.)

3184
02:24:30,670 --> 02:24:32,299
Please show us now.

3185
02:24:34,200 --> 02:24:35,370
That startled me.

3186
02:24:40,040 --> 02:24:41,680
They're handsome.

3187
02:24:43,209 --> 02:24:45,520
- They're handsome. - They're really handsome.

3188
02:24:46,020 --> 02:24:47,450
He's so cute.

3189
02:24:47,719 --> 02:24:48,950
What's that, MINWOOK?

3190
02:24:49,620 --> 02:24:52,020
Who will be the first member...

3191
02:24:52,260 --> 02:24:53,790
among the seven here...

3192
02:24:53,989 --> 02:24:56,530
who will win first place?

3193
02:24:56,860 --> 02:24:57,959
Now,

3194
02:24:59,059 --> 02:25:00,930
I'll announce the trainee in the seventh...

3195
02:25:01,500 --> 02:25:03,100
- This is how it's done? - place.

3196
02:25:03,129 --> 02:25:05,129
- That startled me. - Card.

3197
02:25:06,770 --> 02:25:07,899
This is fun.

3198
02:25:09,739 --> 02:25:12,040
You should go up, KYOUNGBAE.

3199
02:25:14,780 --> 02:25:16,908
The trainee in seventh place will be revealed.

3200
02:25:16,909 --> 02:25:18,079
(7th)

3201
02:25:18,280 --> 02:25:19,579
It's YEOJUN or SUNGMIN.

3202
02:25:21,120 --> 02:25:24,020
He's a trainee with charming smiling eyes.

3203
02:25:25,049 --> 02:25:26,159
KENSHIN?

3204
02:25:27,159 --> 02:25:28,459
It could be KYOUNGBAE.

3205
02:25:28,559 --> 02:25:30,430
There's KENSHIN too.

3206
02:25:33,760 --> 02:25:35,159
This trainee received...

3207
02:25:35,430 --> 02:25:41,139
a global voting score of 2,197,266 points.

3208
02:25:41,469 --> 02:25:43,170
Who do you think it is?

3209
02:25:43,340 --> 02:25:44,469
- KYOUNGBAE. - KYOUNGBAE.

3210
02:25:44,510 --> 02:25:47,280
(Who will be the trainee in 7th place?)

3211
02:25:47,840 --> 02:25:50,148
It's Trainee SEO KYOUNGBAE.

3212
02:25:50,149 --> 02:25:51,609
KYOUNGBAE.

3213
02:25:51,610 --> 02:25:52,619
Congratulations.

3214
02:25:52,620 --> 02:25:54,450
(7th place, Trainee SEO KYOUNGBAE)

3215
02:25:54,850 --> 02:25:56,119
Trainee SEO KYOUNGBAE...

3216
02:25:56,120 --> 02:25:59,159
learned how to dance and sing on his own at home.

3217
02:25:59,620 --> 02:26:01,589
He was complimented by the directors...

3218
02:26:01,590 --> 02:26:04,030
for his confident stage manners.

3219
02:26:04,530 --> 02:26:07,860
He started from a 2-digit rank on the 1st week,

3220
02:26:08,030 --> 02:26:09,729
but he showed us his charm...

3221
02:26:09,969 --> 02:26:12,099
and entered the debut candidates.

3222
02:26:12,100 --> 02:26:13,476
(7th place, SEO KYUNGBAE, 2,197,266 points)

3223
02:26:13,500 --> 02:26:16,939
I want to thank...

3224
02:26:16,940 --> 02:26:18,638
the World Assemblers...

3225
02:26:18,639 --> 02:26:21,239
who gave me their precious votes.

3226
02:26:21,879 --> 02:26:24,149
And Team "Closer..."

3227
02:26:24,610 --> 02:26:26,350
and P3.

3228
02:26:26,850 --> 02:26:29,389
Thank you for trusting me and having me.

3229
02:26:29,690 --> 02:26:30,789
Wink.

3230
02:26:30,790 --> 02:26:31,950
(Smiling with his eyes)

3231
02:26:32,690 --> 02:26:35,859
Now I will announce the assembling results...

3232
02:26:35,860 --> 02:26:37,159
of Trainee SEO KYOUNGBAE.

3233
02:26:37,590 --> 02:26:41,100
Which of the empty slots do you want to go to?

3234
02:26:42,030 --> 02:26:44,469
I want to go to A3.

3235
02:26:46,540 --> 02:26:48,040
Let him get A2.

3236
02:26:49,139 --> 02:26:50,340
I think he'll come here.

3237
02:26:50,770 --> 02:26:52,610
Trainee SEO KYOUNGBAE was assembled to join...

3238
02:26:54,139 --> 02:26:56,209
A3.

3239
02:26:59,819 --> 02:27:01,280
They're too strong.

3240
02:27:01,579 --> 02:27:02,889
Too strong.

3241
02:27:03,319 --> 02:27:05,350
Congratulations, KYOUNGBAE.

3242
02:27:05,590 --> 02:27:07,559
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

3243
02:27:08,159 --> 02:27:09,430
KYOUNGBAE.

3244
02:27:09,829 --> 02:27:10,959
It's the best.

3245
02:27:11,430 --> 02:27:13,500
They're the most powerful team.

3246
02:27:13,829 --> 02:27:15,500
They have a center now.

3247
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,840
I will now announce the trainee in sixth place.

3248
02:27:20,500 --> 02:27:23,540
This is a trainee who took up the challenge again.

3249
02:27:24,969 --> 02:27:26,110
Is it me?

3250
02:27:26,739 --> 02:27:27,809
Is it me?

3251
02:27:28,010 --> 02:27:29,809
It would be YEOJUN or SIHUN.

3252
02:27:30,579 --> 02:27:31,709
It's MAJINGXIANG.

3253
02:27:33,420 --> 02:27:34,780
This trainee received...

3254
02:27:35,149 --> 02:27:40,559
a global voting score of 2,218,299 points.

3255
02:27:41,659 --> 02:27:42,989
YEOJUN? SIHUN?

3256
02:27:45,229 --> 02:27:46,599
It's Trainee JANG YEOJUN.

3257
02:27:46,600 --> 02:27:49,628
(6th place, Trainee JANG YEOJUN)

3258
02:27:49,629 --> 02:27:50,870
Congratulations.

3259
02:27:54,370 --> 02:27:56,908
It's Trainee JANG YEOJUN's...

3260
02:27:56,909 --> 02:27:58,808
third attempt in survival programs.

3261
02:27:58,809 --> 02:28:00,840
It's amazing that he's only 19 years old.

3262
02:28:01,139 --> 02:28:04,450
He has an energy that doesn't tire due to his desperate wish to debut.

3263
02:28:04,879 --> 02:28:06,619
He was the main dancer and center...

3264
02:28:06,620 --> 02:28:08,780
of Team "3D..."

3265
02:28:09,190 --> 02:28:11,489
and led them to win first place by a large difference.

3266
02:28:11,819 --> 02:28:13,558
He thus won the benefit.

3267
02:28:13,559 --> 02:28:14,888
(6th place, JANG YEOJUN, 2,218,299 points)

3268
02:28:14,889 --> 02:28:16,266
(Korean voting score: 977,033 Global voting score: 1,221,266)

3269
02:28:16,290 --> 02:28:19,360
Actually, I already feel thankful...

3270
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,199
that I get an opportunity...

3271
02:28:22,200 --> 02:28:25,199
to carry on with the challenge.

3272
02:28:25,200 --> 02:28:28,870
I'm getting to carry on with the next challenge...

3273
02:28:28,899 --> 02:28:30,870
with the rank of 6th place.

3274
02:28:31,170 --> 02:28:33,239
I'll show you a better performance...

3275
02:28:33,440 --> 02:28:36,609
to satisfy your expectations.

3276
02:28:36,610 --> 02:28:37,780
Thank you.

3277
02:28:42,319 --> 02:28:43,450
Come here.

3278
02:28:43,889 --> 02:28:45,149
It's A3.

3279
02:28:46,459 --> 02:28:48,579
- I think he'll come here. - I think he'll come here.

3280
02:28:48,860 --> 02:28:50,328
Trainee JANG YEOJUN...

3281
02:28:50,329 --> 02:28:53,030
(The assembling result of Trainee JANG YEOJUN)

3282
02:28:53,229 --> 02:28:57,200
was assembled to join A3.

3283
02:28:59,370 --> 02:29:00,739
I knew it.

3284
02:29:01,600 --> 02:29:03,510
This is wrong.

3285
02:29:05,370 --> 02:29:07,440
- They're so strong. - Where are you going?

3286
02:29:07,579 --> 02:29:09,610
- I'm in sixth place. - Hey.

3287
02:29:10,149 --> 02:29:11,509
- Hi. - We're regulars.

3288
02:29:11,510 --> 02:29:14,020
We see each other often.

3289
02:29:14,520 --> 02:29:15,750
The same team.

3290
02:29:16,020 --> 02:29:17,350
We just saw each other.

3291
02:29:17,549 --> 02:29:18,849
(Trainee JANG YEOJUN is placed into A3.)

3292
02:29:18,850 --> 02:29:20,120
I'm so nervous.

3293
02:29:21,120 --> 02:29:22,389
It looked like it.

3294
02:29:24,860 --> 02:29:27,199
Next, I will announce the trainee in fifth place.

3295
02:29:27,200 --> 02:29:28,328
(The 5th-place trainee is to be revealed.)

3296
02:29:28,329 --> 02:29:29,809
He is a trainee with a great build...

3297
02:29:30,229 --> 02:29:32,739
and appearance.

3298
02:29:33,739 --> 02:29:35,739
It would be MAJINGXIANG if it's about great build.

3299
02:29:37,069 --> 02:29:38,469
MAJINGA Z.

3300
02:29:40,079 --> 02:29:41,139
Me?

3301
02:29:41,340 --> 02:29:42,679
(5th place, KIM SUNGMIN, Week 2 ranking)

3302
02:29:42,680 --> 02:29:43,780
Is that me?

3303
02:29:44,579 --> 02:29:46,420
Is it?

3304
02:29:47,020 --> 02:29:48,079
It's not me.

3305
02:29:48,450 --> 02:29:49,849
If it's someone with a great build.

3306
02:29:49,850 --> 02:29:51,226
(3rd place, KIM SIHUN, Week 2 ranking)

3307
02:29:51,250 --> 02:29:52,620
This trainee received...

3308
02:29:53,290 --> 02:29:58,229
a global voting score of 2,481,524 points.

3309
02:29:59,100 --> 02:30:00,459
The score was 2,481,524 points?

3310
02:30:01,200 --> 02:30:03,100
A million points more than me.

3311
02:30:03,829 --> 02:30:04,869
Please.

3312
02:30:04,870 --> 02:30:06,246
(Who will be the trainee in 5th place?)

3313
02:30:06,270 --> 02:30:07,870
It's Trainee MAJINGXIANG.

3314
02:30:08,239 --> 02:30:10,339
(5th, Trainee MAJINGXIANG)

3315
02:30:10,340 --> 02:30:11,540
Congratulations.

3316
02:30:12,879 --> 02:30:14,239
SUNGMIN...

3317
02:30:14,409 --> 02:30:16,110
How high is your rank?

3318
02:30:16,649 --> 02:30:17,779
Trainee MAJINGXIANG...

3319
02:30:17,780 --> 02:30:21,379
posed for the camera whenever and wherever.

3320
02:30:21,719 --> 02:30:25,149
He showed his charm as a prepared idol.

3321
02:30:25,819 --> 02:30:27,958
His skills and looks improved...

3322
02:30:27,959 --> 02:30:29,629
as time went by,

3323
02:30:29,760 --> 02:30:33,100
and he received constant support by the World Assemblers.

3324
02:30:35,100 --> 02:30:37,930
This is my second attempt.

3325
02:30:38,629 --> 02:30:41,839
I feel sorry for my fans who supported me.

3326
02:30:41,840 --> 02:30:43,270
I was a bit late.

3327
02:30:43,510 --> 02:30:47,779
I really thank you for still supporting me, voting for me,

3328
02:30:47,780 --> 02:30:50,010
and loving me.

3329
02:30:50,409 --> 02:30:52,719
I'll work harder. Thank you.

3330
02:30:56,389 --> 02:30:58,049
I think he'll come to A3.

3331
02:30:58,690 --> 02:31:00,059
I think he'll go here.

3332
02:31:01,059 --> 02:31:03,090
I think he'll go there. Next to SVIAT.

3333
02:31:05,190 --> 02:31:06,899
Trainee MAJINGXIANG...

3334
02:31:07,459 --> 02:31:10,099
(The assembling result of MAJINGXIANG is to be revealed.)

3335
02:31:10,100 --> 02:31:12,500
was assembled to join A2.

3336
02:31:12,870 --> 02:31:14,999
- Please move to A2. - Let's go.

3337
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:16,839
The best partner to SVIAT.

3338
02:31:16,840 --> 02:31:17,869
How did you know?

3339
02:31:17,870 --> 02:31:19,739
He's like a partner to SVIAT.

3340
02:31:20,309 --> 02:31:22,039
We're finally on the same team.

3341
02:31:22,040 --> 02:31:24,780
It's been a while, MAJINGXIANG.

3342
02:31:24,850 --> 02:31:26,020
Sit here.

3343
02:31:26,250 --> 02:31:27,648
MAJINGXIANG.

3344
02:31:27,649 --> 02:31:29,249
(Trainee MAJINGXIANG is placed into A2.)

3345
02:31:29,590 --> 02:31:32,659
A2 seems to be the refreshing type.

3346
02:31:37,760 --> 02:31:40,000
Next, I will announce the trainee in fourth place.

3347
02:31:40,399 --> 02:31:42,360
This trainee is normally playful,

3348
02:31:42,770 --> 02:31:44,269
but he is the most serious...

3349
02:31:44,270 --> 02:31:46,739
when it comes to practicing.

3350
02:31:47,239 --> 02:31:49,309
Who is it? SUNGMIN?

3351
02:31:50,270 --> 02:31:51,409
Is that me?

3352
02:31:52,739 --> 02:31:55,109
(There are 4 candidates left.)

3353
02:31:55,110 --> 02:31:58,549
This trainee received a global voting score...

3354
02:31:59,479 --> 02:32:02,079
- of 2,521,103 points. - Is that me?

3355
02:32:02,989 --> 02:32:05,219
(5th place, KIM SUNGMIN, Week 2 ranking)

3356
02:32:06,120 --> 02:32:07,888
It's Trainee KIM SIHUN.

3357
02:32:07,889 --> 02:32:09,689
(4th place, Trainee KIM SIHUN)

3358
02:32:09,690 --> 02:32:10,790
Congratulations.

3359
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,199
Trainee KIM SIHUN challenged...

3360
02:32:20,200 --> 02:32:21,599
himself for survival program three times so far.

3361
02:32:21,600 --> 02:32:23,739
He ran forward to achieve his dream...

3362
02:32:24,010 --> 02:32:27,209
which greatly touched the hearts of the World Assemblers.

3363
02:32:28,110 --> 02:32:29,630
He was in 3rd place in the 1st week...

3364
02:32:29,850 --> 02:32:31,280
and in 3rd place in the 2nd week.

3365
02:32:31,510 --> 02:32:33,850
He has been securing his place in the top ranks.

3366
02:32:34,819 --> 02:32:35,950
I...

3367
02:32:36,819 --> 02:32:40,389
was never in the top ranking...

3368
02:32:41,319 --> 02:32:44,360
when I performed outside.

3369
02:32:45,090 --> 02:32:49,670
I want to really thank the World Assemblers...

3370
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:53,899
for giving me this ranking that feels like a gift.

3371
02:32:54,170 --> 02:32:57,340
I'll do my best to get into the final debut group.

3372
02:32:57,440 --> 02:32:58,610
Thank you.

3373
02:33:01,079 --> 02:33:02,649
SUNGMIN.

3374
02:33:03,409 --> 02:33:04,850
SUNGMIN would be feeling nauseous.

3375
02:33:08,549 --> 02:33:10,319
I will now announce the assembling result...

3376
02:33:10,489 --> 02:33:12,889
of Trainee KIM SIHUN.

3377
02:33:13,659 --> 02:33:15,930
Which slot would you like to be assembled into?

3378
02:33:16,729 --> 02:33:18,030
I don't mind any.

3379
02:33:19,959 --> 02:33:21,128
Confidence.

3380
02:33:21,129 --> 02:33:22,569
Trainee KIM SIHUN...

3381
02:33:23,200 --> 02:33:24,430
Come here, SIHUN.

3382
02:33:25,370 --> 02:33:26,500
SIHUN.

3383
02:33:27,899 --> 02:33:30,309
Was assembled to join A3.

3384
02:33:31,670 --> 02:33:33,078
Please move to A3.

3385
02:33:33,079 --> 02:33:34,339
I knew it.

3386
02:33:34,340 --> 02:33:36,308
Why do you keep following me?

3387
02:33:36,309 --> 02:33:37,549
That was really high.

3388
02:33:38,309 --> 02:33:39,919
I knew you'd come, so I prepared your chair.

3389
02:33:39,920 --> 02:33:41,620
- You placed it here? - I placed it there.

3390
02:33:41,680 --> 02:33:45,090
(Trainee KIM SIHUN is placed into A3.)

3391
02:33:46,659 --> 02:33:50,290
(There are four seats left now.)

3392
02:33:52,290 --> 02:33:53,530
Trainee SAKURADA KENSHIN,

3393
02:33:54,260 --> 02:33:55,399
Trainee JEON MINWOOK,

3394
02:33:55,930 --> 02:33:57,100
and Trainee KIM SUNGMIN.

3395
02:33:58,270 --> 02:34:02,040
Among these 3 trainees, 1 is in 3rd place.

3396
02:34:03,209 --> 02:34:06,280
The trainee in 3rd place is 1 of the Visual Top 7...

3397
02:34:06,680 --> 02:34:10,149
of PROJECT 7, selected by trainees.

3398
02:34:11,809 --> 02:34:12,879
All 3 of them are Top 7.

3399
02:34:14,850 --> 02:34:16,019
They all look nice.

3400
02:34:16,020 --> 02:34:17,780
(3 people with a good look gather as Top 3.)

3401
02:34:17,819 --> 02:34:19,120
This trainee received...

3402
02:34:20,360 --> 02:34:25,290
a global voting score of 2,564,404 points.

3403
02:34:26,399 --> 02:34:27,399
Is it KENSHIN?

3404
02:34:28,100 --> 02:34:30,430
Now I don't know what's going on.

3405
02:34:32,639 --> 02:34:34,239
It's Trainee KIM SUNGMIN.

3406
02:34:34,670 --> 02:34:36,269
(3rd place, Trainee KIM SUNGMIN)

3407
02:34:36,270 --> 02:34:37,440
Congratulations.

3408
02:34:40,110 --> 02:34:43,078
From his first appearance in Zero Setting, Trainee KIM SUNGMIN...

3409
02:34:43,079 --> 02:34:45,879
attracted other trainees with his look.

3410
02:34:46,280 --> 02:34:48,920
He was in 4th place in the 1st week, in 5th place in the 2nd week,

3411
02:34:49,250 --> 02:34:51,049
and in the first Passing Ceremony,

3412
02:34:51,920 --> 02:34:55,289
he took the third place, which is quite a high position.

3413
02:34:55,290 --> 02:34:57,290
(3rd place, Trainee KIM SUNGMIN, 2,564,404 points)

3414
02:34:58,430 --> 02:34:59,930
Hello, I'm KIM SUNGMIN.

3415
02:35:07,540 --> 02:35:08,739
Don't cry.

3416
02:35:11,969 --> 02:35:14,340
It's my first time to see SUNGMIN crying.

3417
02:35:18,909 --> 02:35:20,719
As I took the third place,

3418
02:35:22,319 --> 02:35:24,318
I wonder if it's right.

3419
02:35:24,319 --> 02:35:27,420
There are many people with talents, and I...

3420
02:35:29,729 --> 02:35:31,559
Don't cry.

3421
02:35:33,959 --> 02:35:35,360
He must be under a lot of pressure.

3422
02:35:37,200 --> 02:35:41,469
First, thank you for supporting me.

3423
02:35:42,770 --> 02:35:46,909
I will work harder to show you how I can improve.

3424
02:35:47,010 --> 02:35:48,409
- Thank you. - You can do it!

3425
02:35:53,979 --> 02:35:55,479
I wish SUNGMIN joins us.

3426
02:35:56,520 --> 02:35:58,290
Please come here.

3427
02:35:59,590 --> 02:36:01,988
Trainee KIM SUNGMIN was assembled to join...

3428
02:36:01,989 --> 02:36:03,829
(The assembling result of Trainee KIM SUNGMIN)

3429
02:36:05,459 --> 02:36:06,559
I guess he's going to A3.

3430
02:36:08,500 --> 02:36:09,670
Here.

3431
02:36:09,799 --> 02:36:11,229
A2.

3432
02:36:12,430 --> 02:36:13,799
A2.

3433
02:36:14,340 --> 02:36:16,040
Please move to A2.

3434
02:36:17,440 --> 02:36:19,510
They get so strong, then.

3435
02:36:19,879 --> 02:36:21,579
Don't cry.

3436
02:36:22,040 --> 02:36:23,149
Why are you crying?

3437
02:36:23,250 --> 02:36:25,249
SUNGMIN, why are you crying?

3438
02:36:25,250 --> 02:36:26,250
(Trainee KIM SUNGMIN is placed into A2.)

3439
02:36:26,251 --> 02:36:27,680
Welcome, SUNGMIN.

3440
02:36:28,350 --> 02:36:29,450
Did you feel sad?

3441
02:36:32,649 --> 02:36:35,190
Now, only two trainees are left,

3442
02:36:36,229 --> 02:36:37,930
Trainee SAKURADA KENSHIN...

3443
02:36:38,959 --> 02:36:41,500
and Trainee JEON MINWOOK.

3444
02:36:43,129 --> 02:36:46,738
Between these 2, 1 will be in 1st place...

3445
02:36:46,739 --> 02:36:48,940
in the 1st Passing Ceremony of PROJECT 7.

3446
02:36:50,440 --> 02:36:53,139
Both of them deserve it.

3447
02:36:55,209 --> 02:36:56,279
Good luck to both of them.

3448
02:36:56,280 --> 02:36:57,926
(Candidates for 1st place in the 1st Passing Ceremony)

3449
02:36:57,950 --> 02:37:01,819
Trainee SAKURADA KENSHIN was selected as the center...

3450
02:37:02,579 --> 02:37:03,919
in the Title Song "RUN" and appealed...

3451
02:37:03,920 --> 02:37:07,020
to World Aseemblers first.

3452
02:37:10,690 --> 02:37:13,629
Trainee JEON MINWOOK has not only a good look,

3453
02:37:13,829 --> 02:37:15,558
but also an outstanding rapping ability.

3454
02:37:15,559 --> 02:37:18,500
He's a trainee that's creating the biggest popularity.

3455
02:37:19,370 --> 02:37:23,170
He's been keeping 1st place for 2 weeks.

3456
02:37:24,969 --> 02:37:27,180
You took the 1st place for 2 consecutive weeks.

3457
02:37:27,979 --> 02:37:30,879
Do you think you will have to concede first place...

3458
02:37:31,450 --> 02:37:33,379
to Trainee KENSHIN this week?

3459
02:37:35,879 --> 02:37:37,590
I don't want to concede,

3460
02:37:38,590 --> 02:37:40,559
but since KENSHIN is popular,

3461
02:37:41,590 --> 02:37:43,829
I have a feeling that he took first place.

3462
02:37:44,860 --> 02:37:47,000
- Trainee SAKURADA KENSHIN. - Yes.

3463
02:37:47,959 --> 02:37:49,439
Do you think you can win first place?

3464
02:37:50,770 --> 02:37:51,930
I can do it.

3465
02:37:54,370 --> 02:37:55,670
This is going to be fun.

3466
02:37:55,940 --> 02:37:57,339
This is fun.

3467
02:37:57,340 --> 02:37:58,739
KENSHIN!

3468
02:38:00,010 --> 02:38:02,079
I will now announce the trainee in first place...

3469
02:38:03,209 --> 02:38:05,950
in the 1st Passing Ceremony of PROJECT 7.

3470
02:38:06,579 --> 02:38:07,648
(2nd place and 1st place)

3471
02:38:07,649 --> 02:38:09,850
The trainee in first place received...

3472
02:38:10,190 --> 02:38:11,590
a global voting score...

3473
02:38:12,389 --> 02:38:13,389
of four million...

3474
02:38:14,920 --> 02:38:16,059
- Four million. - What?

3475
02:38:16,329 --> 02:38:18,328
- What? - Four million?

3476
02:38:18,329 --> 02:38:20,299
It's more than over 3 million, but 4 million.

3477
02:38:21,629 --> 02:38:25,468
He received 4,260,040 points.

3478
02:38:25,469 --> 02:38:27,189
(A global voting score of 4,260,040 points)

3479
02:38:28,239 --> 02:38:29,398
It's four million?

3480
02:38:29,399 --> 02:38:30,739
Most of the voters selected him.

3481
02:38:31,770 --> 02:38:33,239
It's almost unanimous.

3482
02:38:33,479 --> 02:38:34,739
I guess most people picked him.

3483
02:38:35,879 --> 02:38:37,378
The trainee in first place...

3484
02:38:37,379 --> 02:38:39,099
(The 1st palace trainee is to be revealed.)

3485
02:38:39,620 --> 02:38:41,879
KENSHIN received the benefit.

3486
02:38:42,219 --> 02:38:43,739
I guess KENSHIN will take first place.

3487
02:38:45,149 --> 02:38:47,090
MINWOOK is first place without a change.

3488
02:38:47,690 --> 02:38:49,050
He has 100,000 benefit points too.

3489
02:38:49,729 --> 02:38:51,359
It's 100,000 benefit points for MINWOOK.

3490
02:38:51,360 --> 02:38:52,898
(Would the benefits influence their ranks?)

3491
02:38:52,899 --> 02:38:54,059
The trainee in first place...

3492
02:38:57,670 --> 02:38:59,169
MINWOOK has 100,000 benefit points.

3493
02:38:59,170 --> 02:39:00,839
(Would the benefits influence their ranks?)

3494
02:39:00,840 --> 02:39:02,069
The trainee in first place...

3495
02:39:05,809 --> 02:39:07,339
is JEON MINWOOK.

3496
02:39:07,340 --> 02:39:09,808
(1st place, Trainee JEON MINWOOK)

3497
02:39:09,809 --> 02:39:10,950
Congratulations.

3498
02:39:13,350 --> 02:39:15,020
I envy him.

3499
02:39:16,180 --> 02:39:17,988
In the 1st Passing Ceremony of PROJECT 7,

3500
02:39:17,989 --> 02:39:20,290
the one who has the honor of winning first place...

3501
02:39:20,620 --> 02:39:22,458
is Trainee JEON MINWOOK.

3502
02:39:22,459 --> 02:39:24,729
(1st place, JEON MINWOOK, 4,260,040 points)

3503
02:39:25,059 --> 02:39:28,899
Trainee SAKURADA KENSHIN received...

3504
02:39:29,229 --> 02:39:31,898
- a global voting score... - He's out of my league.

3505
02:39:31,899 --> 02:39:34,399
Of 4,162,794 points...

3506
02:39:35,139 --> 02:39:36,408
and won second place.

3507
02:39:36,409 --> 02:39:38,068
(2nd place, SAKURADA KENSHIN, 4,162,794 points)

3508
02:39:38,069 --> 02:39:40,010
If Trainee JEON MINWOOK...

3509
02:39:40,280 --> 02:39:42,209
didn't have the benefit of 100,000 points,

3510
02:39:43,209 --> 02:39:45,010
today's 1st place and 2nd place...

3511
02:39:45,649 --> 02:39:46,979
would have been changed.

3512
02:39:49,450 --> 02:39:51,190
- The benefit matters. - I know.

3513
02:39:52,149 --> 02:39:55,620
I sincerely give my thanks to World Assemblers...

3514
02:39:56,260 --> 02:39:59,329
who made me win first place, a high position.

3515
02:39:59,959 --> 02:40:02,158
I will always do my best...

3516
02:40:02,159 --> 02:40:04,200
to show you a lot of amazing performances.

3517
02:40:04,299 --> 02:40:08,170
I will appreciate it if you could keep supporting me.

3518
02:40:08,340 --> 02:40:09,709
Thank you, everyone.

3519
02:40:11,069 --> 02:40:12,139
He's like an idol star.

3520
02:40:13,139 --> 02:40:14,879
Hello, World Assemblers.

3521
02:40:15,479 --> 02:40:17,479
Thank you for your voting.

3522
02:40:21,180 --> 02:40:22,680
Through this training,

3523
02:40:23,090 --> 02:40:25,620
I've practiced...

3524
02:40:35,600 --> 02:40:40,799
I've practiced with you for a long time.

3525
02:40:45,739 --> 02:40:47,579
To be honest, I wanted...

3526
02:40:48,909 --> 02:40:50,549
to make a debut with all of you.

3527
02:40:56,120 --> 02:40:58,690
I will practice harder...

3528
02:40:59,649 --> 02:41:00,860
and study Korean more.

3529
02:41:01,690 --> 02:41:02,690
And...

3530
02:41:04,129 --> 02:41:05,989
I want to make a debut. Thank you.

3531
02:41:11,370 --> 02:41:14,600
(The assembling results of the trainees ranked 1st and 2nd)

3532
02:41:16,040 --> 02:41:18,370
- Who would come here? - Wipe the seat off first.

3533
02:41:19,979 --> 02:41:21,139
Wipe it off.

3534
02:41:21,510 --> 02:41:22,840
Any of them will be fine.

3535
02:41:23,379 --> 02:41:24,750
He might come here.

3536
02:41:25,409 --> 02:41:26,420
Please.

3537
02:41:27,680 --> 02:41:30,020
Trainee JEON MINWOOK was assembled to join...

3538
02:41:31,020 --> 02:41:32,049
A3?

3539
02:41:32,250 --> 02:41:34,360
Is A3.

3540
02:41:38,559 --> 02:41:40,000
KENSHIN!

3541
02:41:40,600 --> 02:41:42,898
- KENSHIN, here! - KENSHIN.

3542
02:41:42,899 --> 02:41:43,899
KENSHIN!

3543
02:41:43,900 --> 02:41:46,739
Trainee SAKURADA KENSHIN was assembled to join A2.

3544
02:41:46,840 --> 02:41:49,239
Both trainees, please move to your slots.

3545
02:41:51,040 --> 02:41:52,969
MINWOOK. What were you doing?

3546
02:41:54,479 --> 02:41:55,540
JEON MINWOOK!

3547
02:41:56,680 --> 02:41:59,750
(Trainee JEON MINWOOK is placed into A3.)

3548
02:42:00,350 --> 02:42:02,549
- Welcome. - Hello.

3549
02:42:05,590 --> 02:42:09,090
(Trainee SAKURADA KENSHIN is placed into A2.)

3550
02:42:09,889 --> 02:42:13,199
World Assemblers' voting decided...

3551
02:42:13,200 --> 02:42:18,799
your ranks, and I announced the trainees ranked from 1st to 69th.

3552
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,000
Among 70 seats in the slots,

3553
02:42:23,239 --> 02:42:25,739
only one seat is left now.

3554
02:42:27,180 --> 02:42:28,939
Among the trainees whose name hasn't been called,

3555
02:42:28,940 --> 02:42:30,780
there's the last one to be announced.

3556
02:42:31,180 --> 02:42:32,849
This is so brutal.

3557
02:42:32,850 --> 02:42:33,879
My goodness.

3558
02:42:37,149 --> 02:42:39,389
This is crazy.

3559
02:42:39,489 --> 02:42:40,769
This makes me feel more nervous.

3560
02:42:41,190 --> 02:42:42,319
I can do this.

3561
02:42:43,459 --> 02:42:45,229
LIN WEICHEN in the 70th place.

3562
02:42:46,600 --> 02:42:47,760
I wish NOYUL joins us.

3563
02:42:49,829 --> 02:42:52,469
NOYUL, please come here.

3564
02:42:54,840 --> 02:42:57,039
(Who will take the last seat?)

3565
02:42:57,040 --> 02:42:59,040
- I'm the one to go. - Why does your hand tremble?

3566
02:43:00,379 --> 02:43:02,780
The last seat of the slots will be taken...

3567
02:43:02,940 --> 02:43:06,450
by 1 of 4 trainees, who are candidates for 70th place.

3568
02:43:07,280 --> 02:43:08,819
I will reveal them on the screen.

3569
02:43:17,190 --> 02:43:18,558
Nothing is holding me.

3570
02:43:18,559 --> 02:43:22,030
(88th place, Trainee KWON YEUNG, Week 2 ranking)

3571
02:43:22,860 --> 02:43:24,568
(70th place, Trainee LEE YUJUN, Week 2 ranking)

3572
02:43:24,569 --> 02:43:25,600
Please.

3573
02:43:27,870 --> 02:43:29,068
This is crazy.

3574
02:43:29,069 --> 02:43:30,949
(69th place, Trainee YANG JUHO, Week 2 ranking)

3575
02:43:31,639 --> 02:43:32,808
HYEONSEUNG is one of them.

3576
02:43:32,809 --> 02:43:34,940
(71st place, Trainee YOO HYEONSEUNG, Week 2 ranking)

3577
02:43:37,280 --> 02:43:38,450
HYEONSEUNG!

3578
02:43:38,850 --> 02:43:40,449
HYEONSEUNG, my friend. He should come here.

3579
02:43:40,450 --> 02:43:42,530
(Trainee YOO HYEONSEUNG showed outstanding dancing.)

3580
02:43:42,950 --> 02:43:45,689
YUJUN!

3581
02:43:45,690 --> 02:43:47,770
(Trainee LEE YUJUN was a sub-dancer in Team "Kiwi.")

3582
02:43:49,020 --> 02:43:51,360
I wish YANG JUHO comes here.

3583
02:43:54,760 --> 02:43:56,100
YEUNG.

3584
02:43:56,670 --> 02:43:58,790
YEUNG should come here. He showed a good performance.

3585
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:01,799
YEUNG is the only one who received the benefit among them.

3586
02:44:03,139 --> 02:44:05,069
Among these four trainees,

3587
02:44:06,010 --> 02:44:09,280
who will take the last seat?

3588
02:44:10,149 --> 02:44:11,249
Who will that be?

3589
02:44:11,250 --> 02:44:12,779
The trainee in 70th place...

3590
02:44:12,780 --> 02:44:15,649
who is qualified to be assembled...

3591
02:44:16,120 --> 02:44:18,120
by World Assemblers again...

3592
02:44:19,959 --> 02:44:21,159
Please.

3593
02:44:37,139 --> 02:44:38,739
Now, please reveal...

3594
02:44:39,139 --> 02:44:40,579
the trainee in 70th place.

3595
02:44:48,319 --> 02:44:49,839
Now, reveal the trainee in 70th place.

3596
02:44:58,889 --> 02:45:00,030
That's amazing.

3597
02:45:00,799 --> 02:45:02,798
- All right. - The trainee in 70th place...

3598
02:45:02,799 --> 02:45:07,540
received a global voting score of 165,122 points.

3599
02:45:07,600 --> 02:45:09,270
It's Trainee KWON YEUNG.

3600
02:45:09,370 --> 02:45:10,440
It's all right.

3601
02:45:18,309 --> 02:45:19,708
Trainee KWON YEUNG received...

3602
02:45:19,709 --> 02:45:21,718
the benefit of 20,000 points...

3603
02:45:21,719 --> 02:45:24,149
given to the top team in Position Matching.

3604
02:45:24,350 --> 02:45:26,549
If he hadn't received the benefit,

3605
02:45:26,760 --> 02:45:30,989
his challenge in PROJECT 7 must have been stopped today.

3606
02:45:31,829 --> 02:45:33,329
The benefit matters.

3607
02:45:33,659 --> 02:45:34,898
The benefit plays a big part.

3608
02:45:34,899 --> 02:45:36,158
(They realize the power of the benefit.)

3609
02:45:36,159 --> 02:45:37,329
Congratulations!

3610
02:45:38,670 --> 02:45:40,739
He's the top one today, actually.

3611
02:45:41,670 --> 02:45:42,870
He's the top one today.

3612
02:45:44,270 --> 02:45:47,809
My name was called the last from Zero Setting,

3613
02:45:47,909 --> 02:45:51,479
and I advanced by passing after being deferred.

3614
02:45:51,780 --> 02:45:54,420
I blamed myself,

3615
02:45:54,620 --> 02:45:56,179
but I met Team "Crayon..."

3616
02:45:56,180 --> 02:45:59,090
and won first place, fortunately.

3617
02:46:00,090 --> 02:46:03,289
The ones who practiced with me are in front of me now.

3618
02:46:03,290 --> 02:46:06,999
I will think that you're all on my shoulders...

3619
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:08,500
and do my best until the end.

3620
02:46:08,700 --> 02:46:10,329
I hope you support me.

3621
02:46:11,770 --> 02:46:12,829
Thank you.

3622
02:46:18,440 --> 02:46:19,469
YEUNG.

3623
02:46:19,610 --> 02:46:21,909
Trainee KWON YEUNG...

3624
02:46:22,110 --> 02:46:24,479
is placed into A5. He took the last seat left.

3625
02:46:32,020 --> 02:46:35,590
(70th-place trainee KWON YEUNG is placed into A5.)

3626
02:46:36,989 --> 02:46:38,930
He's on the same team with YUSEI.

3627
02:46:39,290 --> 02:46:41,500
He showed a history.

3628
02:46:43,030 --> 02:46:45,369
The five assemblies selected...

3629
02:46:45,370 --> 02:46:48,569
by World Assemblers are complete.

3630
02:46:49,239 --> 02:46:51,468
I thought my team was well-balanced.

3631
02:46:51,469 --> 02:46:54,839
We had trainees for vocal, rap,

3632
02:46:54,840 --> 02:46:57,250
and ones who are good at dancing.

3633
02:46:57,549 --> 02:46:59,450
I think our team...

3634
02:46:59,680 --> 02:47:02,219
has the combination World Assemblers...

3635
02:47:02,479 --> 02:47:04,350
want to see the most.

3636
02:47:04,450 --> 02:47:07,158
I think we have people who deserve to be the center...

3637
02:47:07,159 --> 02:47:08,458
in PROJECT 7,

3638
02:47:08,459 --> 02:47:11,488
considering their skills and looks.

3639
02:47:11,489 --> 02:47:13,058
I think they assembled us properly...

3640
02:47:13,059 --> 02:47:15,699
by including people who can rap, sing, and dance.

3641
02:47:15,700 --> 02:47:18,898
I think it's a balanced assembly.

3642
02:47:18,899 --> 02:47:21,569
We all looked similar in a way.

3643
02:47:21,670 --> 02:47:23,669
We looked pure and gentle, like tofu.

3644
02:47:23,670 --> 02:47:26,110
I think they gathered us based on that standard.

3645
02:47:26,440 --> 02:47:29,439
As World Assemblers assembled you,

3646
02:47:29,440 --> 02:47:32,180
I hope you create wonderful performances.

3647
02:47:32,549 --> 02:47:34,449
Trainees of PROJECT 7!

3648
02:47:34,450 --> 02:47:36,949
Greet World Assemblers!

3649
02:47:36,950 --> 02:47:38,620
- We'll do our best! - We'll do our best!

3650
02:47:46,360 --> 02:47:49,429

It's all right.

3676
02:48:52,159 --> 02:48:53,859
JUYOUNG, you worked hard too. Let's do our best.

I will vote for you all. I'll keep watching you.

3679

Let's get together when the show ends.

3680
02:48:59,100 --> 02:49:00,669
Congratulations.

3681
02:49:00,670 --> 02:49:02,440
Make sure you go up to the top.

3682
02:49:02,540 --> 02:49:03,770
You need to work hard for me.

3683
02:49:03,840 --> 02:49:05,170
- Yes! - You should do that.

3684
02:49:06,540 --> 02:49:07,809
You really worked hard.

3685
02:49:12,909 --> 02:49:14,749

Okay.

3692
02:49:44,149 --> 02:49:45,409
Is it always like this?

3693
02:49:47,649 --> 02:49:50,020
Seriously.

3694
02:49:53,219 --> 02:49:54,360
You can do it!

3695
02:49:55,420 --> 02:49:57,259
- You worked hard. - I'll treat you to a meal.

3696

You worked so hard. You were great.

3701
02:50:07,899 --> 02:50:09,600
I'm sorry that I scolded you so much.

3702
02:50:10,340 --> 02:50:12,638
You should advance to the final stage.

3703
02:50:12,639 --> 02:50:14,208
I'll do that for you.

3704
02:50:14,209 --> 02:50:15,780
I'll do that for you.

3705
02:50:15,809 --> 02:50:17,148
Let's meet on the stage later.

3706
02:50:17,149 --> 02:50:18,429
I'll treat you at the cafeteria.

3707
02:50:18,680 --> 02:50:20,420
I'll do everything I can to make a debut.

3708
02:50:21,020 --> 02:50:22,279
Gosh.

3709
02:50:22,280 --> 02:50:24,120
- You work hard. - We...

3710
02:50:24,590 --> 02:50:26,120
should meet up later. I mean it.

3711
02:50:26,450 --> 02:50:27,519
Don't cry.

3712
02:50:27,520 --> 02:50:28,859
- I'll wait for you in my dream. - Okay.

3713
02:50:28,860 --> 02:50:30,430
Let's eat something nice together.

3714
02:50:31,489 --> 02:50:33,798
I give my thanks to World Assemblers...

3715
02:50:33,799 --> 02:50:35,999
who have supported me so far.

3716
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:37,568
I won't give up...

3717
02:50:37,569 --> 02:50:39,828
and continue challenging for my dream.

3718
02:50:39,829 --> 02:50:41,670
I loved PROJECT 7.

3719
02:50:42,170 --> 02:50:45,209
To me, all the team members...

3720
02:50:46,069 --> 02:50:47,340
felt like shining lights.

3721
02:50:47,540 --> 02:50:49,610
We created a performance together...

3722
02:50:50,139 --> 02:50:53,378
and showed our performance on the stage.

3723
02:50:53,379 --> 02:50:56,120
Those are such happy memories to me.

3724
02:50:57,149 --> 02:51:00,090
I guess that's why I'm crying now.

3725
02:51:00,659 --> 02:51:02,289
We're going to meet outside too.

3726
02:51:02,290 --> 02:51:04,128
I'm not crying because I'm sad.

3727
02:51:04,129 --> 02:51:05,859
I'm crying because I'm so happy.

3728
02:51:05,860 --> 02:51:07,530
I'm not crying because I'm sad.

3729
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:09,398
I'm crying because I'm happy.

3730
02:51:09,399 --> 02:51:11,068
(Check out the preview of a new song on the PROJECT 7's YouTube channel.)
