6
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,399
High schooler?

7
00:00:15,868 --> 00:00:17,639
- High schooler. - High schooler.

8
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:19,397
High schooler.

9
00:00:19,398 --> 00:00:20,569
High schooler. I see.

10
00:00:21,738 --> 00:00:22,839
Hello.

11
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:27,148
I'm SAKURADA KENSHIN.

12
00:00:27,808 --> 00:00:30,048
I'm Japanese.

13
00:00:30,049 --> 00:00:33,647
I'm not Korean.

14
00:00:33,648 --> 00:00:35,489
Nice to meet you.

15
00:00:36,618 --> 00:00:38,459
Thank you for your work.

16
00:00:40,389 --> 00:00:41,529
Do you want some vitamins?

17
00:00:42,588 --> 00:00:44,257
- Do you know what this is? - Of course.

18
00:00:44,258 --> 00:00:45,428
(Reacting right away to healthy things)

19
00:00:45,429 --> 00:00:46,999
I always want more of these.

20
00:00:47,999 --> 00:00:51,139
(The trainees share things that are good for their bodies.)

21
00:00:52,139 --> 00:00:53,709
I have to dry it like this.

22
00:00:54,669 --> 00:00:57,309
(Carefully styling his bangs too)

23
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:02,209
(Humming)

24
00:01:05,478 --> 00:01:09,049
I'm going to be the charming, handsome boy today.

25
00:01:10,088 --> 00:01:11,758
- Wink. - You're good at taking videos.

26
00:01:12,019 --> 00:01:13,828
(He can't be the only one who gets prettied up.)

27
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:15,257
What do you think? You're becoming prettier.

28
00:01:15,258 --> 00:01:16,828
(Slapping)

29
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:19,958
BINGHUA told me that this was how you get rid of the puffiness.

30
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:20,997
You're right.

31
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:22,268
You look like an artist.

32
00:01:22,269 --> 00:01:24,038
(BINGHUA joins in to do some contouring.)

33
00:01:24,838 --> 00:01:27,307
It's different. The left is dark, and the right is bright, right?

34
00:01:27,308 --> 00:01:28,569
There's no difference.

35
00:01:29,038 --> 00:01:30,638
Should we do some stretching?

36
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:34,008
- Nation exercise. Start. - Start.

37
00:01:34,508 --> 00:01:39,078
One, two, three. Six, seven.

38
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:40,888
- You need to follow him. - Okay.

39
00:01:40,918 --> 00:01:41,918
Open up.

40
00:01:41,919 --> 00:01:43,117
(Taking off his shirt)

41
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:44,219
Hey.

42
00:01:45,388 --> 00:01:48,287
(Revealing their muscles)

43
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,558
- Let's go. - Okay.

44
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:51,659
One.

45
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,697
(Beginning strength training)

46
00:01:52,698 --> 00:01:53,929

Five.

48
00:01:56,528 --> 00:01:58,167
- Six. - Nice.

49
00:01:58,168 --> 00:01:59,239
Seven.

50
00:01:59,338 --> 00:02:01,307
- Fifty-two. - Nice.

51
00:02:01,308 --> 00:02:02,308
Fifty-three.

52
00:02:02,638 --> 00:02:05,008
- Fifty-four. - YONGHYUN's are so good.

53
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:06,238
Sixty.

54
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:08,347
(They're already at 60 push-ups.)

55
00:02:08,348 --> 00:02:10,548
Let's stop here.

56
00:02:10,549 --> 00:02:11,817
- Your muscles will be sore. - What?

57
00:02:11,818 --> 00:02:14,718
(Trainee YU JIAHN continues on after the 60th push-up.)

58
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,318
(Did you see that?)

59
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:18,618
Amazing.

60
00:02:19,558 --> 00:02:20,758
Good job.

61
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:22,489
(Their successful morning exercise session is over.)

62
00:02:22,688 --> 00:02:23,828
How cute.

63
00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:25,699
(What is this sound coming from the room?)

64
00:02:26,299 --> 00:02:29,329
(Trainee PARK JUNWOO's morning wake-up song)

65
00:02:30,098 --> 00:02:32,597

66

(Eyes fixed)

67
00:02:35,438 --> 00:02:37,337
(Great job.)

68
00:02:37,338 --> 00:02:39,579
- How impressive. - Oh, my.

69
00:02:40,308 --> 00:02:43,209
(Meanwhile, this trainee isn't moving at all.)

70
00:02:44,979 --> 00:02:48,218
(The morning is tough for trainee SVIAT.)

71
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,158
(Getting some deep sleep with the sound of the hair dryer.)

72
00:02:54,558 --> 00:02:56,527
SVIAT. We need to go now.

73
00:02:56,528 --> 00:02:57,528
(AOM finally wakes him up.)

74
00:02:57,829 --> 00:02:58,958
Everyone, say hello.

75
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,898
- Hello. - Hello.

76
00:03:01,898 --> 00:03:05,338
Aren't SVIAT's pyjamas so cute?

77
00:03:06,568 --> 00:03:08,067
- Aren't they cute? - Yes.

78
00:03:08,068 --> 00:03:09,308
(The pyjamas are fitting for the youngest on the team.)

79
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:12,578
Right. SVIAT said...

80
00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:15,908
he had a bedtime routine. Could you tell us about it?

81
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:18,647
Solving a Rubik's Cube?

82
00:03:18,648 --> 00:03:19,648
(He solves a Rubik's Cube!)

83

84
00:03:24,058 --> 00:03:25,718
Oh, are you almost done?

85
00:03:27,688 --> 00:03:29,187
(Done)

86
00:03:29,188 --> 00:03:30,289
He finished.

87
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:33,057
Please come in.

88
00:03:33,058 --> 00:03:34,368
(Moving to another room)

89
00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:38,098
The reason I came to this room...

90
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:41,968
is to have a Rubik's Cube battle.

91
00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:45,139
(SVIAT versus LIN WEI CHEN)

92
00:03:46,808 --> 00:03:48,908
Your hands are so fast.

93
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:50,209
They're so fast.

94
00:03:54,188 --> 00:03:56,688
SVIAT. You should be nervous.

95
00:03:57,588 --> 00:03:58,618
Seriously.

96
00:03:59,218 --> 00:04:02,489
(LIN WEI CHEN finished in 1 minute and 34 seconds.)

97
00:04:03,058 --> 00:04:04,729
You can start now.

98
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:08,897

99
00:04:08,898 --> 00:04:09,929
What?

100
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:17,339
(SVIAT finished in 1 minute and 18 seconds.)

101
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:19,077
SVIAT, good.

102
00:04:19,078 --> 00:04:20,207
(Trainee SVIAT won the Rubik's Cube battle!)

103
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:21,279
He's so good.

104
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:24,118
Good job. That was really amazing.

I think we can be a bit greedy...

185
00:07:56,089 --> 00:07:58,399
- but make it fair too. - Right.

186
00:07:59,328 --> 00:08:01,029
- Love Me Five and Juliet. - Love Me Five and Juliet?

187
00:08:01,799 --> 00:08:03,697
Can you sing it for us?

188
00:08:03,698 --> 00:08:05,298
- Okay. - Okay.

189
00:08:05,299 --> 00:08:07,099
- Okay. Let's go. - Let's go.

190
00:08:08,068 --> 00:08:11,008
Everything hangs on you

191
00:08:11,539 --> 00:08:14,649
I can only stand back and watch

192
00:08:15,748 --> 00:08:20,148
I will hold my breath and wait for your answer

193
00:08:20,149 --> 00:08:24,017
While you take your turn

194
00:08:24,018 --> 00:08:25,888
- Thank you. - Thank you.

195
00:08:26,618 --> 00:08:27,729
You're good.

196
00:08:28,828 --> 00:08:31,299
Oh, gosh. You're really good.

197
00:08:31,498 --> 00:08:35,128
You did really well, HYUNWOO.

198
00:08:35,129 --> 00:08:36,129
Thank you.

199
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:38,399
TAEHWAN. Your verse...

200
00:08:39,198 --> 00:08:42,538
You supported each other so perfectly.

201
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,009
I think that was perfect.

202
00:08:44,238 --> 00:08:46,538
I think you did the best.

203
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:47,549
(The "Love me or Leave me" team received high praise.)

204
00:08:48,009 --> 00:08:49,978
OH TAEHWAN is so good.

205
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,978
- Thank you. - Good job, HANBIN.

206
00:08:52,848 --> 00:08:56,248
In a way, I had an important part.

207
00:08:56,249 --> 00:08:58,458
Because this is a competition, I wanted to do well.

208
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:00,687
We put in a lot of care,

209
00:09:00,688 --> 00:09:02,558
and I think the results reflected that.

210
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,568
I'm so sad.

211
00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:12,438
It was the perfect balance.

212
00:09:12,499 --> 00:09:14,539
Honestly, I'm sad too.

213
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:17,139
It's understandable because we lost two.

214
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:18,708
It is what it is.

215
00:09:19,009 --> 00:09:20,639
Everyone,

216
00:09:20,948 --> 00:09:23,477
please vote within your teams...

217
00:09:23,478 --> 00:09:25,717
to begin the center member selection.

218
00:09:25,718 --> 00:09:26,779
(They suddenly announced the center member selection.)

219
00:09:26,978 --> 00:09:28,817
Trainees who are selected as the center member...

220
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:32,088
will receive the benefit of a center member fancam.

221
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:34,687
Also, the center member...

222
00:09:34,688 --> 00:09:36,457
(They will get the song's highlight.)

223
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,458
The center member will sing the song's highlight.

224
00:09:38,598 --> 00:09:40,029
Are the parts going to change?

225
00:09:40,058 --> 00:09:41,597
Will the highlight part be fixed?

226
00:09:41,598 --> 00:09:43,669
- Seriously? This is no joke. - Incredible.

227
00:09:44,238 --> 00:09:45,467
- Man... - This is the center position,

228
00:09:45,468 --> 00:09:46,869
and we don't know what these are.

229
00:09:47,338 --> 00:09:49,368
Did the first verse go to the center member?

230
00:09:49,369 --> 00:09:51,338
- The verse goes to the center. - My gosh.

231
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:54,077
That's too bad. TAEHWAN sang this well.

232
00:09:54,078 --> 00:09:55,408
I agree. He was great here.

233
00:09:55,409 --> 00:09:57,779
So the part here goes to the center member.

234
00:09:57,818 --> 00:10:01,217
The part I set my eyes on was given to someone else.

235
00:10:01,218 --> 00:10:03,718
It almost broke me down.

236
00:10:05,488 --> 00:10:07,317
But everyone agrees...

237
00:10:07,318 --> 00:10:08,987
that TAEHWAN sang that part so well.

238
00:10:08,988 --> 00:10:12,258
We've been saying that over and over again.

239
00:10:12,259 --> 00:10:14,298
And we're not that ambitious when it comes to what part we get.

240
00:10:14,299 --> 00:10:16,597
- We want our team to do well. - We want the team to win.

241
00:10:16,598 --> 00:10:20,799
(They can't delay choosing the center member any longer.)

242
00:10:21,068 --> 00:10:23,768
Just like you said earlier, to induce more views,

243
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:24,977
I was thinking...

244
00:10:24,978 --> 00:10:26,678
of you two as the center member.

245
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:27,779
I agree to that.

246
00:10:27,978 --> 00:10:31,878
HANBIN defined the identity of the song,

247
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:34,288
- and I thought... - It was his image.

248
00:10:34,289 --> 00:10:37,249
he'd be able to create that image for us.

249
00:10:38,488 --> 00:10:40,158
But now, it's over there.

250
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:42,828
(My part is over there now.)

251
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:46,357
The factor which I thought could show...

252
00:10:46,358 --> 00:10:48,899
my potential was the verse.

253
00:10:49,098 --> 00:10:51,798
Without the verse,

254
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:55,369
I don't know if I'll be able to show who I am.

255
00:10:57,978 --> 00:10:59,238
I don't know.

256
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:01,078
Seriously.

257
00:11:04,478 --> 00:11:07,118
TAEHWAN didn't look too happy.

258
00:11:07,119 --> 00:11:09,587
He really practised hard for it,

259
00:11:09,588 --> 00:11:12,158
and he loved it more than anybody else.

260
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:13,758
I got worried.

261
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:15,128
(Not a simple decision for the leader)

262
00:11:15,129 --> 00:11:17,758
I'll try to give my members...

263
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:20,029
moral support as much as I can.

264
00:11:20,558 --> 00:11:23,899
(Who will be the center member of Team "Love Me Love Me?")

265
00:11:24,499 --> 00:11:26,368
What do you think? Did you practice hard?

266
00:11:26,369 --> 00:11:27,668
(LEE HANBIN is standing in the center.)

267
00:11:27,669 --> 00:11:29,068
Did you guys decide on the parts?

268
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:30,768
Yes, we did.

269
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:33,937
This is a rehearsal, so check everything.

270
00:11:33,938 --> 00:11:35,077
- Yes. - Yes.

271
00:11:35,078 --> 00:11:38,077
TAEHWAN seemed to feel awkward,

272
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:39,149
so I feel bad.

273
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:42,119
But the members chose me,

274
00:11:42,688 --> 00:11:44,888
so I'll take this burden...

275
00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:48,688
to put on a great performance.

276
00:12:15,119 --> 00:12:19,159
I don't know if it's HANBIN's voice or if he's not feeling well,

277
00:12:19,818 --> 00:12:23,558
but I felt like his tone was a bit off.

278
00:12:24,088 --> 00:12:26,558
Wait a minute.

279
00:12:26,828 --> 00:12:29,498
The rest of you did well.

280
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:32,467
HANBIN, you don't need to bring the mood down...

281
00:12:32,468 --> 00:12:33,697
just because it's the first verse.

282
00:12:33,698 --> 00:12:36,238
I think you should be careful of your tone a little.

283
00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:37,707
When you start the intro,

284
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,508
your tone goes up because you're nervous.

285
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:42,408
You just need to sing sincerely. Do you understand?

286
00:12:42,409 --> 00:12:43,848
- Yes, sir. - Yes.

287
00:12:54,529 --> 00:12:56,789
I've always felt sorry.

288
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:58,858
Now that we're here,

289
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:00,327
(Overcoming the pressure as the center member)

290
00:13:00,328 --> 00:13:01,429
I'm...

291
00:13:01,598 --> 00:13:03,268
(Will he be able to perform well?)

292
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:04,369
I think...

293
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:24,488
("Love me or Leave me" by Love Me Five And Juliet)

294
00:13:39,139 --> 00:13:40,968
He must be so nervous.

295
00:13:41,808 --> 00:13:43,208
Don't be nervous, LEE HANBIN.

296
00:13:46,838 --> 00:13:48,279
Listen to TAEHWAN's voice.

297
00:13:57,688 --> 00:13:59,289
Our teacher is doing great.

298
00:14:31,358 --> 00:14:32,889
(SIHUN)

299
00:15:01,889 --> 00:15:03,588
Look at his eyes!

300
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:19,639
This is giving me chills.

301
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,009
I want to be able to sing like that.

302
00:15:31,419 --> 00:15:33,049
He's definitely the center member.

303
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:58,408
(Check out the full performance on the PROJECT 7's YouTube channel.)

304
00:15:58,409 --> 00:16:01,779

00:16:19,659 --> 00:16:21,159
That was amazing.

(That gave me...)

00:16:23,068 --> 00:16:24,097
(goosebumps.)

313
00:16:24,098 --> 00:16:25,139
What was that?

314
00:16:26,539 --> 00:16:28,208
Throwing it was a good idea.

315
00:16:28,608 --> 00:16:30,909
Your tone wasn't even off at the start.

316
00:16:31,169 --> 00:16:32,478
(Amazed)

317
00:16:32,539 --> 00:16:34,207
- We did a good job. - I agree.

318
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,648
This is great.

319
00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:37,748
- This is great. - I know.

320
00:16:37,749 --> 00:16:39,847
I was really worried about HANBIN.

321
00:16:39,848 --> 00:16:42,218
I think he did better than he did during practice.

322
00:16:42,619 --> 00:16:44,448
I think we can win first place.

323
00:16:46,488 --> 00:16:48,088
I want to tell all my teammates...

324
00:16:48,789 --> 00:16:51,629
that they did so well,

325
00:16:52,558 --> 00:16:55,567
and that I'm thankful they believed in me.

This is the performance I've been waiting for.

I've been looking forward to this.

330
00:17:04,438 --> 00:17:06,839
This is the second performance for the vocal position.

331
00:17:07,278 --> 00:17:08,508
It's a song by IU...

Hello, everyone. In 2, 3.

343

Hi, we are...

344
00:17:43,008 --> 00:17:44,778
- Team Love. - Team Love.

(Intimidating others with a harmony)

00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:49,819
What just happened?

347
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,248
Their greeting made an impact.

348
00:17:51,659 --> 00:17:53,488
Didn't they get into a big fight?

349
00:17:53,859 --> 00:17:55,788
- They did. All the time. - I know.

(What's the truth behind the fight in Team Love?)

351
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:03,398
Okay, let's hear your song.

00:18:03,399 --> 00:18:04,428
- Okay. - Okay.

353
00:18:04,429 --> 00:18:05,998
- Let's go. - Good luck.

354
00:18:06,498 --> 00:18:07,698
This is a difficult song.

(Trainee YOO YOUNGSEO is singing the intro.)

356
00:18:17,849 --> 00:18:21,079
I think EUNSUH will sound good with the verse too.

357
00:18:21,248 --> 00:18:23,318
Can we listen to EUNSUH?

358
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:24,419
Okay.

359
00:18:34,399 --> 00:18:36,399
- Sounds good. - That sounded way better.

360
00:18:37,899 --> 00:18:40,038
I think EUNSUH should sing it.

361
00:18:40,069 --> 00:18:42,069
Can I sing it again?

362
00:18:43,238 --> 00:18:45,278
- I guess you want this part. - Yes.

363
00:18:45,978 --> 00:18:49,477
Honestly, from the moment I chose this song,

364
00:18:49,478 --> 00:18:53,119
I've always wanted to do the first verse.

365
00:18:53,248 --> 00:18:54,889
- Go ahead. - Okay.

366
00:18:56,149 --> 00:18:59,859
(He tries singing the verse again.)

367
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,899
You sing well,

368
00:19:06,028 --> 00:19:08,497
but the vibe...

369
00:19:08,498 --> 00:19:10,429
suits EUNSUH better.

370
00:19:10,968 --> 00:19:14,497
- You guys should talk about it. - Okay.

371
00:19:14,498 --> 00:19:16,309
(It ends with a suggestion for reassigning the parts.)

372
00:19:19,339 --> 00:19:21,947
I think we need to finalize who's going to sing the first verse.

373
00:19:21,948 --> 00:19:23,448
Here's my personal opinion.

374
00:19:23,649 --> 00:19:25,618
EUNSUH's vibe might be more suitable for the song.

375
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:28,848
But YOUNGSEO sounded more stable when he sang.

376
00:19:28,849 --> 00:19:30,487
Let's decide who's going to sing this part and focus on our practice.

377
00:19:30,488 --> 00:19:32,819
I thought this was already settled that I was going to sing it.

378
00:19:33,288 --> 00:19:34,517
But they told us...

379
00:19:34,518 --> 00:19:36,589
to discuss it among ourselves.

380
00:19:36,629 --> 00:19:39,928
But in my opinion, it will be more helpful to our team...

381
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,698
if YOUNGSEO sings this part.

382
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,738
- Can I say something? - Sure.

383
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:48,338
I know what you mean, but the director kept commenting...

384
00:19:48,339 --> 00:19:50,968
that I was a better fit for this part than YOUNGSEO.

385
00:19:51,069 --> 00:19:54,808
YOUNGSEO has two main parts of the song.

386
00:19:54,809 --> 00:19:56,579
I understand that he's ambitious.

387
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:59,248
But I hope he can be kind and give one of the parts to me.

388
00:20:00,048 --> 00:20:02,818
But honestly, there's something that's bothering me.

389
00:20:02,819 --> 00:20:05,988
EUNSUH. It's true that your voice suits this part better.

390
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,257
But your voice sounds a little shaky when you sing.

391
00:20:09,258 --> 00:20:10,958
I was concerned about that.

392
00:20:12,258 --> 00:20:15,298
But with some practice, I'll be able to fix my shaky pitch.

393
00:20:15,468 --> 00:20:18,238
I'm sure I can improve.

394
00:20:19,339 --> 00:20:22,069
To be honest, I'm very angry right now.

395
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:26,738
He kept saying that he couldn't trust me to pull it off.

396
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:30,248
I didn't think fairness should have any role...

397
00:20:30,448 --> 00:20:32,149
in assigning parts.

398
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:34,447
(The 3 of them will vote.)

399
00:20:34,448 --> 00:20:36,619
- Close your eyes. - Close them.

400
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:40,319
(YOUNGSEO gets 1 vote.)

401
00:20:40,659 --> 00:20:43,428
This is the first part of our performance.

402
00:20:43,429 --> 00:20:45,958
So getting the vibe right is more important.

403
00:20:46,099 --> 00:20:47,498
I agree too.

404
00:20:47,758 --> 00:20:49,797
So EUNSUH will take this part for now.

405
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:50,968
(The first verse goes to EUNSUH.)

406
00:20:51,169 --> 00:20:52,599
I wasn't thrilled.

407
00:20:52,968 --> 00:20:54,838
It didn't feel like I got the part...

408
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:56,669
because they believed that I would be good at it.

409
00:20:56,738 --> 00:20:58,937
"Sure. You try it, EUNSUH."

410
00:20:58,938 --> 00:21:01,139
It felt more like they just gave up on it.

411
00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:05,879
(Team "Love wins all" continues with their practice.)

412
00:21:09,589 --> 00:21:10,649
Hold on.

413
00:21:17,129 --> 00:21:20,659
Actually, I'm the main vocalist.

414
00:21:20,758 --> 00:21:24,298
But I didn't get a part where I could shine as a vocalist.

415
00:21:25,298 --> 00:21:29,139
(During the 2nd interim evaluation)

416
00:21:33,478 --> 00:21:35,148
The song was divided in a way...

417
00:21:35,149 --> 00:21:36,809
that made you look like the main vocalist.

418
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:39,919
(The feedback was that YOUNGSEO was more like the main vocalist.)

419
00:21:40,248 --> 00:21:44,588
Other people might not see that I'm the main vocalist of the group.

420
00:21:44,589 --> 00:21:47,017
- I get what you mean, CHENYU. - Yes.

421
00:21:47,018 --> 00:21:48,958
- I agree too. - That's because...

422
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:50,527
I have something to say too.

423
00:21:50,528 --> 00:21:53,828
Thanks to you, I got the center position.

424
00:21:53,829 --> 00:21:55,768
But as for this part,

425
00:21:56,268 --> 00:21:58,168
someone else could sing this.

426
00:21:58,169 --> 00:22:00,139
I thought about it.

427
00:22:00,438 --> 00:22:01,669
Then...

428
00:22:02,038 --> 00:22:04,309
I would like to say something about the second half.

429
00:22:04,569 --> 00:22:06,878
Could I get one of the parts...

430
00:22:06,879 --> 00:22:08,679
with the high notes toward the end?

431
00:22:09,778 --> 00:22:11,178
Then I won't have...

432
00:22:11,179 --> 00:22:13,618
- any parts with high notes. - Your part isn't the problem.

433
00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:15,687
Honestly, I think you're being too greedy.

434
00:22:15,688 --> 00:22:17,118
Think about it. BINGHUA...

435
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:18,618
- just gave up his part. - Right.

436
00:22:18,619 --> 00:22:21,089
I only have one solo part too.

437
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:23,559
I think you're just being too greedy.

438
00:22:24,188 --> 00:22:26,457
He was trying to take the part BINGHUA was going to give away.

439
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:28,059
He seemed quite selfish.

440
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:29,669
When I saw how he behaved,

441
00:22:29,768 --> 00:22:32,268
I wondered if it would benefit our team.

442
00:22:32,538 --> 00:22:34,339
The directors said that...

443
00:22:34,968 --> 00:22:37,868
they wanted to hear me sing a little more...

444
00:22:37,869 --> 00:22:39,978
toward the end. That was the feedback.

445
00:22:40,139 --> 00:22:41,879
So I got a bit greedy.

446
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:44,679
(While sharing feedback during the 2nd interim evaluation)

447
00:22:44,809 --> 00:22:47,149
- Great. - EUNSUH's role is too small.

448
00:22:47,379 --> 00:22:50,788
I just want to hear EUNSUH's clean voice one more time.

449
00:22:50,889 --> 00:22:53,688
They spoke highly of me during the evaluation.

450
00:22:53,859 --> 00:22:56,787
He said he didn't need to sing one of his parts.

451
00:22:56,788 --> 00:22:58,929
So I asked if I could take it.

452
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:03,099
But they made it sound like I was stealing other people's parts.

453
00:23:04,129 --> 00:23:06,098
It made me wonder why I even bothered to do this.

454
00:23:06,099 --> 00:23:08,069
That kept crossing my mind.

455
00:23:09,738 --> 00:23:13,879
Okay. Let's sing it enthusiastically.

456
00:23:16,349 --> 00:23:19,047
(EUNSUH seems particularly down.)

457
00:23:19,048 --> 00:23:20,879
- Perfect. - I love it.

458
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:22,348
Sing it like you did the second time around.

459
00:23:22,349 --> 00:23:24,187
He kept listening to the music.

460
00:23:24,188 --> 00:23:26,187
He didn't talk much.

461
00:23:26,188 --> 00:23:28,929
So I was a bit worried about him.

462
00:23:29,589 --> 00:23:31,329
I wouldn't say...

463
00:23:31,929 --> 00:23:33,758
we were getting along well.

464
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:38,169
I thought that no one would be able to sympathize with me.

465
00:23:38,698 --> 00:23:42,139
So I was slowly losing my interest in the team.

466
00:23:43,938 --> 00:23:45,578
What was that? During the bridge of the song,

467
00:23:45,579 --> 00:23:48,138
EUNSUH and SEOKHEE will sing in turns to harmonize.

468
00:23:48,139 --> 00:23:50,208
- It'd be nice to check the balance. - Okay.

469
00:23:50,849 --> 00:23:55,018
In that part, his pitch goes flat and causes the harmony to sound off.

470
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:00,488
The main melody went flat.

471
00:24:01,288 --> 00:24:03,388
How should I put it?

472
00:24:03,389 --> 00:24:05,528
EUNSUH kept pointing out my flaws on purpose.

473
00:24:05,998 --> 00:24:07,458
Who harmonized here?

474
00:24:07,698 --> 00:24:10,197
I don't know who did it.

475
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:11,669
But he keeps causing the harmony sound off.

476
00:24:12,038 --> 00:24:13,569
That's what I did.

477
00:24:14,669 --> 00:24:16,268
(Chuckling)

478
00:24:16,468 --> 00:24:17,767
I guess it was SEOKHEE.

479
00:24:17,768 --> 00:24:19,079
- What? - What?

480
00:24:19,339 --> 00:24:21,478
When EUNSUH gave his feedback,

481
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:26,218
he sounded slightly harsh.

482
00:24:26,379 --> 00:24:29,447
I think his feedback might have upset...

483
00:24:29,448 --> 00:24:30,688
some of the guys.

484
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:33,358
(Team "Love wins all" checks the harmony.)

485
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:35,228
- Something is off. - Right.

486
00:24:36,788 --> 00:24:39,798
(They take turns to sing the part one at a time.)

487
00:24:40,829 --> 00:24:42,728
- That's not right. - Your pitch is off.

488
00:24:43,468 --> 00:24:45,169
I can't do it.

489
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:46,898
It's too low.

490
00:24:46,899 --> 00:24:49,507
No, it's not that you can't do it. You just have to fix your pitch.

491
00:24:49,508 --> 00:24:51,668
It goes like this. This is the pitch.

492
00:24:51,669 --> 00:24:53,409
During BINGHUA's part,

493
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,349
his pitch goes back and forth between sharp and flat.

494
00:24:56,909 --> 00:24:59,678
The verse too. His pitch is...

495
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,518
always off. He's out of tune.

496
00:25:02,589 --> 00:25:04,488
EUNSUH said things like this to BINGHUA.

497
00:25:04,518 --> 00:25:07,359
"You got it wrong here."

498
00:25:09,389 --> 00:25:11,389
- It was right just now. - I got it wrong.

499
00:25:11,429 --> 00:25:13,428
You got it wrong?

500
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:17,098
- No. - Why do you keep talking about it?

501
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:19,198
Why do you keep telling me about my pitch?

502
00:25:20,468 --> 00:25:21,538
What?

503
00:25:21,909 --> 00:25:25,379
If there's something you want to say to me, go ahead.

504
00:25:26,139 --> 00:25:28,339
I don't think this has anything to do with my pitch.

505
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:30,447
If you keep this up, we'll end up fighting.

506
00:25:30,448 --> 00:25:32,179
Why do you do that?

507
00:25:32,379 --> 00:25:33,778
I really don't understand you.

508
00:25:34,349 --> 00:25:37,419
I'm a feeling type. I focus more...

509
00:25:37,788 --> 00:25:40,987
on people's facial expressions than what they say.

510
00:25:40,988 --> 00:25:42,287
Can we switch and listen to it?

511
00:25:42,288 --> 00:25:45,598
EUNSUH's facial expression looked a bit off.

512
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:48,798
Back then, I was really sad.

513
00:25:50,429 --> 00:25:52,398
- It's the way he talks. - The way he talks.

514
00:25:52,399 --> 00:25:54,038
You always sound like...

515
00:25:54,369 --> 00:25:57,608
You always say things like this. "You got it wrong."

516
00:25:57,609 --> 00:26:00,578
It sounds like you're talking...

517
00:26:00,579 --> 00:26:04,007
to your junior. Like you're our boss.

518
00:26:04,008 --> 00:26:05,379
So it's upsetting.

519
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,277
I'm sorry if you guys felt that...

520
00:26:08,278 --> 00:26:10,548
because of the way I spoke.

521
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,788
To be honest, ever since joining this team,

522
00:26:17,929 --> 00:26:21,998
it felt like no one on the team was rooting for me.

523
00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:26,798
If you want people to root for you, shouldn't you be nice to us first?

524
00:26:26,899 --> 00:26:28,198
We're a team.

525
00:26:30,139 --> 00:26:32,278
I wanted to sound gentle.

526
00:26:35,448 --> 00:26:36,978
Could you stop...

527
00:26:38,879 --> 00:26:40,778
Could you stop cornering me like this?

528
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:44,349
Are you serious?

529
00:26:47,589 --> 00:26:48,788
Did you really mean that?

530
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:06,037
Actually, this wasn't the first time...

531
00:27:06,038 --> 00:27:07,608
our team faced a problem.

532
00:27:07,609 --> 00:27:09,678
The first problem was about the part...

533
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,348
between EUNSUH and YOUNGSEO.

534
00:27:11,349 --> 00:27:13,178
The second one was about the part between EUNSUH and CHENYU.

535
00:27:13,179 --> 00:27:15,819
Today, there was a problem between EUNSUH and BINGHUA.

536
00:27:15,988 --> 00:27:18,559
I tried not to be emotional about it.

537
00:27:18,758 --> 00:27:20,119
We're a team.

538
00:27:20,458 --> 00:27:23,058
Why...

539
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:24,328
I couldn't understand him.

540
00:27:24,329 --> 00:27:27,227
There had already been a problem regarding our parts before.

541
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:30,298
From the beginning of this project,

542
00:27:30,629 --> 00:27:31,968
I was upset about some things.

543
00:27:32,198 --> 00:27:33,899
And things got tough.

544
00:27:34,669 --> 00:27:36,738
So I got emotional.

545
00:27:37,409 --> 00:27:40,277
This isn't a dating show.

546
00:27:40,278 --> 00:27:42,908
This show is about aspiring idol stars.

547
00:27:42,909 --> 00:27:44,879
We must practice a lot more.

548
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,349
Honestly,

549
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:49,849
I want us to forget about drama.

550
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:52,089
I just want us to focus on our performance.

551
00:27:52,619 --> 00:27:54,159
We brought in too much drama...

552
00:27:54,988 --> 00:27:57,158
into this performance.

553
00:27:57,159 --> 00:27:58,488
- I agree. - Into our performance.

554
00:27:59,258 --> 00:28:02,399
All of us need to be more objective.

555
00:28:03,169 --> 00:28:05,339
We're not dating.

556
00:28:06,238 --> 00:28:07,839
We're not in a relationship.

557
00:28:09,139 --> 00:28:10,609
We're just a team.

558
00:28:10,938 --> 00:28:13,278
Seriously. Like the title,

559
00:28:13,538 --> 00:28:15,308
I want us to do well.

560
00:28:15,309 --> 00:28:17,849
(Will Team Love be able to win all of it like the title?)

561
00:28:18,309 --> 00:28:19,819
- Good luck! - Good luck!

562
00:28:20,849 --> 00:28:23,247
We argued a lot while preparing for this performance.

563
00:28:23,248 --> 00:28:25,889
We made several mistakes too.

564
00:28:26,089 --> 00:28:29,028
I thought, "Let's just think about us five and do well."

565
00:28:29,429 --> 00:28:31,359
I want us to have a successful performance,

566
00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:33,997
so this moment will be a good memory for us.

567
00:28:33,998 --> 00:28:35,298

This is crazy. Why is he so good?

Dear members of Team Love whom I love with all of my heart,

629
00:34:00,889 --> 00:34:04,329
we were all hurt while preparing for this performance.

630
00:34:04,458 --> 00:34:06,098
Because we went through a hard time,

631
00:34:06,099 --> 00:34:08,757
we were able to sing as one at last.

632
00:34:08,758 --> 00:34:10,228
Once we focused on the performance,

633
00:34:10,229 --> 00:34:13,068

There's something free-spirited about you,

716
00:37:24,829 --> 00:37:26,828
so I thought this song would be perfect for you.

717
00:37:26,829 --> 00:37:28,728
When you have a chance like this...

718
00:37:28,729 --> 00:37:31,468
(She commented on his potential and urged him to take imitative.)

719
00:37:32,398 --> 00:37:34,397

720
00:37:34,398 --> 00:37:36,309
- My gosh. - Nice.

721
00:37:36,809 --> 00:37:38,639

722

- Yes. - Yes.

The others mentioned me twice,

748
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:04,628

- is about 40 to 50 seconds. - Yes.

792
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:12,858
Doesn't the vibe for the dance break change drastically?

793
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:16,987
(A strong beat added to the lyrical melody)

794

I wanted to switch up the mood.

795

796
00:41:21,329 --> 00:41:22,769

797
00:41:23,229 --> 00:41:24,628

You should've joined Team "3D."

804
00:41:46,689 --> 00:41:49,289
You were doing this and suddenly went...

805
00:41:49,758 --> 00:41:51,987
I'm worried that this dance wouldn't suit the song.

806
00:41:51,988 --> 00:41:54,197
The song's mood is lyrical...

807
00:41:54,198 --> 00:41:56,128

808
00:41:56,698 --> 00:41:59,098
The viewers might think it's boring...

809
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:00,998
if we don't add the damping move.

810
00:42:00,999 --> 00:42:03,008
It's not about the move. It's about the choreography.

811
00:42:03,209 --> 00:42:05,138
- How we approach it... - It's about the choreography.

812
00:42:05,139 --> 00:42:08,007
Moves like these...

813
00:42:08,008 --> 00:42:10,378
are hip-hop based.

814
00:42:10,709 --> 00:42:13,278
You would've added these moves for a hip-hop song.

815
00:42:13,648 --> 00:42:15,418
That's what I was most worried about.

816
00:42:15,579 --> 00:42:19,588

Are you being stubborn or what?

821
00:42:44,148 --> 00:42:46,519
I thought it could cause us trouble.

822
00:42:47,849 --> 00:42:51,619
The mood of these moves doesn't suit the song at all.

823
00:42:51,988 --> 00:42:53,487
- Okay. - So you need to...

824
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:57,628

Oh, okay.

826
00:43:01,628 --> 00:43:03,298
It's a lot harder than I thought.

827
00:43:05,128 --> 00:43:07,138

828
00:43:07,139 --> 00:43:08,499
Was it that bad?

829
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:11,868
- That's not what she meant. - Is it...

830
00:43:11,869 --> 00:43:13,008
Am I interpreting it wrong?

831
00:43:13,338 --> 00:43:16,378
I was stressed and concerned about the members.

832
00:43:17,378 --> 00:43:19,148
I could tell that they were having a really hard time,

833
00:43:19,619 --> 00:43:22,018

Yes.

899

I heard you practised hard,

900
00:49:20,409 --> 00:49:22,508
always getting to the training room first.

901
00:49:22,778 --> 00:49:24,548
Are you satisfied with your performance?

902
00:49:25,378 --> 00:49:29,849
We worked hard until late at night...

903
00:49:33,758 --> 00:49:36,389
We got to show...

904
00:49:36,959 --> 00:49:38,828
what we practised hard together...

905
00:49:38,829 --> 00:49:41,857
to the World Assemblers,

906
00:49:41,858 --> 00:49:44,769
and I'm really glad and satisfied with it.

907
00:49:45,128 --> 00:49:46,668
- You did well. - You did well.

908
00:49:50,039 --> 00:49:52,608
I'm grateful to everyone.

909
00:49:53,309 --> 00:49:54,309

915

I'm curious about their performance.

916

in the training room...

930
00:50:44,159 --> 00:50:45,828
because they're so shy.

931
00:50:45,829 --> 00:50:47,559
Oh, they're all introverts.

932
00:50:47,858 --> 00:50:50,297

Next team, Team "Pop." Please come on out.

945
00:51:18,689 --> 00:51:20,357
There are many members I have high expectations of.

(Team "Pop" interim evaluation)

947
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:24,698
There are many members I have high expectations of in this team.

948
00:51:25,698 --> 00:51:27,039
That team is like the Avengers.

949
00:51:27,798 --> 00:51:29,338
I wanted to see their performance the most.

950

00:52:02,439 --> 00:52:03,508
Thank you.

954
00:52:07,238 --> 00:52:09,139
Okay. I have a lot to say.

955
00:52:09,278 --> 00:52:11,147
After seeing who were in this team,

956
00:52:11,148 --> 00:52:13,878
I thought they'd be successful.

957
00:52:14,519 --> 00:52:17,648
But I got shocked after seeing their performance.

958
00:52:17,889 --> 00:52:21,788
First of all, I'm not sure if CHANGHYEON is leading them well.

959
00:52:21,789 --> 00:52:25,559
(I'm not sure if CHANGHYEON is leading them well.)

960
00:52:25,858 --> 00:52:28,059
You lack a lot in terms of details.

961
00:52:28,128 --> 00:52:29,458
You'll need to practice a lot.

962
00:52:29,459 --> 00:52:30,567
(Director Bada continues to give harsh criticism.)

963
00:52:30,568 --> 00:52:35,998
I think it'll be better if CHANGHYEON focused on his dance...

964
00:52:35,999 --> 00:52:39,837
and a trainee who is good at dancing...

965
00:52:39,838 --> 00:52:41,377
become a leader and lead you.

966
00:52:41,378 --> 00:52:45,079
I feel like you'll get better quickly that way.

967
00:52:46,309 --> 00:52:50,019
I don't think the leader is doing much as a leader.

968
00:52:50,218 --> 00:52:51,248
Let's start.

969
00:52:51,249 --> 00:52:53,289
(They're practising together.)

970
00:52:54,619 --> 00:52:58,329
(He doesn't participate and watches the choreography by himself.)

971
00:52:58,429 --> 00:53:00,398
I think he could be better...

972
00:53:00,959 --> 00:53:02,698
in terms of skills.

973
00:53:05,499 --> 00:53:09,238
(What's worse is that the leader learns the choreography slowly.)

974
00:53:14,738 --> 00:53:16,679
It's meaningless to practice as a group.

975
00:53:17,349 --> 00:53:20,749
No one can follow it.

976
00:53:21,548 --> 00:53:23,248
After finishing the first verse,

977
00:53:23,249 --> 00:53:25,748
we realized that CHANGHYEON made the most mistakes.

978
00:53:25,749 --> 00:53:26,758
(The leader)

979
00:53:26,988 --> 00:53:29,789
Three, four. And five, six, seven.

980
00:53:31,329 --> 00:53:33,429
- Get up! - Get up.

981
00:53:33,528 --> 00:53:36,559
He dozed off openly in front of us,

982
00:53:37,229 --> 00:53:39,528
so I thought, "How can he sleep?"

983
00:53:40,698 --> 00:53:42,197
I think a leader...

984
00:53:42,198 --> 00:53:43,297
(A meeting to come up with a plan after the interim evaluation)

985
00:53:43,298 --> 00:53:45,508
should lead the whole team.

986
00:53:46,008 --> 00:53:49,039
So I think he should be more passionate.

987
00:53:49,378 --> 00:53:52,948
I think it's better to switch our leader.

988
00:53:57,718 --> 00:54:00,118
I'm feeling a lot of pressure.

989
00:54:00,119 --> 00:54:01,119
(New leader, Trainee KO MINSUNG)

990
00:54:01,159 --> 00:54:05,087
Leading 14 people by himself...

991
00:54:05,088 --> 00:54:06,758
could be hard.

992
00:54:06,898 --> 00:54:08,728
So I want to help him.

993
00:54:08,729 --> 00:54:11,198

995
00:54:13,698 --> 00:54:14,968
Cute.

996
00:54:15,738 --> 00:54:18,809

1010

1015

01:00:22,168 --> 01:00:23,909
and supported each other.

1069
01:00:24,309 --> 01:00:26,908
I was honoured to work with nice team members.

1070
01:00:26,909 --> 01:00:29,179
I'd like to tell them I love them.

1071
01:00:29,378 --> 01:00:33,277
It'd be so nice if I could perform with them again.

1072
01:00:33,278 --> 01:00:34,318
Thank you.

1073
01:00:35,579 --> 01:00:39,488
The next performance expresses fluttering feelings of young love.

1074
01:00:39,918 --> 01:00:41,087
This team will perform EXO's...

1075
01:00:41,088 --> 01:00:42,788
(Buzzing)

1076
01:00:42,789 --> 01:00:44,258
(Excited)

1077
01:00:44,689 --> 01:00:46,159
"Don't Go."

1078
01:00:46,729 --> 01:00:48,559
("Don't Go" by EXO, performed by Bee Boys)

1079
01:00:48,628 --> 01:00:50,258
(Screaming)

1080
01:00:54,869 --> 01:00:57,039
Here they come!

1081
01:00:57,139 --> 01:00:58,809
(KWON YONGHYUN)

1082
01:00:58,869 --> 01:00:59,967
(NAM JIWOON)

1083
01:00:59,968 --> 01:01:01,878
My first love!

1084
01:01:02,809 --> 01:01:04,508
Goodness, they look perfect.

1085
01:01:04,608 --> 01:01:06,148
Is this a team of good looks?

1086
01:01:06,409 --> 01:01:08,378
They look so nice.

1087
01:01:09,079 --> 01:01:11,147
They look great.

1088
01:01:11,148 --> 01:01:12,817
(Trainee KIM SUNGMIN)

1089
01:01:12,818 --> 01:01:14,317
(Trainee JANG HYEONSEOK)

1090
01:01:14,318 --> 01:01:17,019
You came up on the stage energetically.

1091
01:01:17,289 --> 01:01:18,659
Please greet the audience.

1092
01:01:18,858 --> 01:01:19,858
In 1, 2!

1093
01:01:19,859 --> 01:01:21,558
- Anybody looking for honey? - Anybody looking for honey?

1094
01:01:21,559 --> 01:01:22,697
- Buzz. - Buzz.

1095
01:01:22,698 --> 01:01:24,999
- Hello, we're Bee Boys! - Hello, we're Bee Boys!

1096
01:01:26,128 --> 01:01:27,797
(JUNWON)

1097
01:01:27,798 --> 01:01:29,238
(SUNGMIN)

1098
01:01:29,539 --> 01:01:32,068
- Trainee KIM SUNGMIN. - Yes.

1099
01:01:33,709 --> 01:01:36,138
Contrary to your pure and cool appearance,

1100
01:01:36,139 --> 01:01:39,508
I heard you're called the silliest one in PROJECT 7.

1101
01:01:40,008 --> 01:01:43,249
I cling to YONGHYUN calling him "Dad."

1102
01:01:43,349 --> 01:01:45,087
- Dad! - Hey.

1103
01:01:45,088 --> 01:01:46,147
Dad.

1104
01:01:46,148 --> 01:01:48,417
And I readily approach other trainees...

1105
01:01:48,418 --> 01:01:49,987
to start conversations.

1106
01:01:49,988 --> 01:01:53,229
So I guess that makes me look a bit silly.

1107
01:01:53,389 --> 01:01:56,357
Rather than a cute and silly puppy,

1108
01:01:56,358 --> 01:01:58,167
I'll try to look...

1109
01:01:58,168 --> 01:02:00,229
like a cool and charming cat. Meow.

1110
01:02:03,238 --> 01:02:04,468
What was that?

1111
01:02:05,209 --> 01:02:06,608
He's like AI.

1112
01:02:07,508 --> 01:02:08,579
Meow.

1113
01:02:08,809 --> 01:02:10,778
The center position, Trainee NAM JIWOON.

1114
01:02:10,909 --> 01:02:12,008
- Yes. - Yes.

1115
01:02:12,948 --> 01:02:15,918
I heard another trainee, not you, was in the center position first.

1116
01:02:16,148 --> 01:02:17,849
How was it changed?

1117
01:02:18,119 --> 01:02:20,659
(Another trainee was in the center position?)

1118
01:02:27,798 --> 01:02:31,468
(Sirens go off from the start of their practice.)

1119
01:02:33,329 --> 01:02:34,439
You're good.

1120
01:02:34,539 --> 01:02:37,809
And you can press both sides of your neck here.

1121
01:02:37,939 --> 01:02:39,539
You should pinch those parts.

1122
01:02:39,738 --> 01:02:41,608
It might hurt if it's your first time doing it.

1123
01:02:41,738 --> 01:02:42,778
Gosh.

1124
01:02:42,809 --> 01:02:44,148
- It hurts, right? - It hurts.

1125
01:02:46,948 --> 01:02:48,348
Is this also related to vocal cords?

1126
01:02:48,349 --> 01:02:50,078
- You need to relax these muscles. - I see.

1127
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:51,289
You're going to use them a lot.

1128
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:56,389
(Taking care of their voices and giving 1-on-1 vocal lessons)

1129
01:02:57,389 --> 01:02:58,829
Let's sing it this way.

1130
01:02:59,389 --> 01:03:03,459
(Trainee KWON YONGHYUN leads the team's practice.)

1131
01:03:04,229 --> 01:03:05,728
- It was nice. - I think so.

1132
01:03:05,729 --> 01:03:06,929
I liked that.

1133
01:03:07,128 --> 01:03:09,568
I felt things proceeded smoothly.

1134
01:03:09,639 --> 01:03:11,038
Our harmony was good,

1135
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:12,909
and we proceeded so well.

1136
01:03:15,679 --> 01:03:19,079
(Proceeding without stopping)

1137
01:03:19,409 --> 01:03:22,647
Take me with you

1138
01:03:22,648 --> 01:03:25,848
I assigned their parts as the main vocalist...

1139
01:03:25,849 --> 01:03:28,558
and added harmonies.

1140
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:30,288
I think my position...

1141
01:03:30,289 --> 01:03:32,758
needs to think more and be responsible.

1142
01:03:33,858 --> 01:03:39,168
Take me with you to where you live

1143
01:03:40,229 --> 01:03:42,138
(Thinking)

1144
01:03:42,139 --> 01:03:44,108
Everyone, hold on.

1145
01:03:45,209 --> 01:03:49,438
First, I think it'd be nice if we changed the first chorus a bit.

1146
01:03:49,439 --> 01:03:51,248
It's a very important part,

1147
01:03:51,249 --> 01:03:52,909
and the bridge part is also important.

1148
01:03:53,048 --> 01:03:55,818
JIWOON, your part starts here, right?

1149
01:03:56,749 --> 01:04:00,048
You kept singing this part,

1150
01:04:00,318 --> 01:04:01,959
but your voice didn't have a presence at all.

1151
01:04:02,258 --> 01:04:04,229
So I think I can sing this part...

1152
01:04:04,628 --> 01:04:07,158
I will follow you to the end of the world

1153
01:04:07,159 --> 01:04:09,028
HYEONSEOK can sing this part.

1154
01:04:09,099 --> 01:04:10,127
Okay.

1155
01:04:10,128 --> 01:04:11,729
I was upset...

1156
01:04:11,968 --> 01:04:14,599
but I thought it was for the team.

1157
01:04:17,238 --> 01:04:19,769
I shouldn't have been happy about having the bridge verse part.

1158
01:04:21,838 --> 01:04:24,179
(Trainee KIM SUNGMIN looks on.)

1159
01:04:24,278 --> 01:04:27,418
My voice sounded bad due to a cold.

1160
01:04:27,519 --> 01:04:29,019
(When dividing up the parts)

1161
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:32,088
SUNGMIN can perform this part nicely.

1162
01:04:32,289 --> 01:04:34,558
- It's kind of the song's highlight. - Right.

1163
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:37,258
I think SUNGMIN can show his charm very well here.

1164
01:04:37,959 --> 01:04:40,729
(Only one verse is given due to his bad condition.)

1165
01:04:40,858 --> 01:04:42,659
I think it's a very small part,

1166
01:04:43,028 --> 01:04:46,628
but I decided to do my best for what was given to me.

1167
01:04:48,039 --> 01:04:50,099
- Let us listen to your song. - Okay.

1168
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:55,809
(They sing according to the parts they divided.)

1169
01:05:17,099 --> 01:05:19,628
(How would the Directors evaluate it?)

1170
01:05:20,028 --> 01:05:21,898
- Thank you. - Okay.

1171
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:24,438
Wait.

1172
01:05:24,439 --> 01:05:26,568
As far as I can see, your parts...

1173
01:05:27,338 --> 01:05:29,439
need to be changed a bit.

1174
01:05:29,909 --> 01:05:31,309
You can't equally divide the amount of the parts.

1175
01:05:31,508 --> 01:05:32,909
You all have different talents.

1176
01:05:33,108 --> 01:05:35,047
It's enough if each of you can show what you have.

1177
01:05:35,048 --> 01:05:36,118
That's what a team is about.

1178
01:05:36,119 --> 01:05:38,717
So, if YONGHYUN is capable,

1179
01:05:38,718 --> 01:05:40,349
it's right that he leads the team.

1180
01:05:40,818 --> 01:05:44,527
I tried to divide the parts equally...

1181
01:05:44,528 --> 01:05:46,159
and make a balance at the same time.

1182
01:05:46,889 --> 01:05:48,658
But the Directors advised...

1183
01:05:48,659 --> 01:05:50,898
to improve the quality for sure.

1184
01:05:51,429 --> 01:05:54,167
Therefore, I thought there was no other way.

1185
01:05:54,168 --> 01:05:55,869
HYEONSEOK and I...

1186
01:05:56,338 --> 01:05:58,439
would have to sing most of the parts.

1187
01:05:58,639 --> 01:06:00,238
In short, the bridge part...

1188
01:06:00,439 --> 01:06:01,878
goes to HYEONSEOK and JUNWON.

1189
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:04,277
"Quiet and eye-catching gestures and strong and tender eyes,"

1190
01:06:04,278 --> 01:06:08,048
JIWOON and SUNGMIN will take this part.

1191
01:06:08,479 --> 01:06:10,749
We'll see how it is when we sing in the training room.

1192
01:06:10,948 --> 01:06:13,817
Let's work together as we practice.

1193
01:06:13,818 --> 01:06:15,959
This part also needs to stand out.

1194
01:06:16,159 --> 01:06:18,987
Listen. JUNWON sings the second chorus, "Take me."

1195
01:06:18,988 --> 01:06:21,357
I sing from this section to "follow to the end of the world."

1196
01:06:21,358 --> 01:06:23,229
You sing "Oh, no."

1197
01:06:23,329 --> 01:06:25,869
HYEONSEOK will take "my view."

1198
01:06:26,128 --> 01:06:27,397
And I'll sing the ad-lib.

1199
01:06:27,398 --> 01:06:28,668
Would that be fine?

1200
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:33,338
In the case of JIHO, SUNGMIN, JIWOON, and me,

1201
01:06:33,769 --> 01:06:37,409
the vocal range of "Don't Go" was very high.

1202
01:06:38,709 --> 01:06:41,947
YONGHYUN and HYEONSEOK, the good singers, did every part nicely.

1203
01:06:41,948 --> 01:06:42,948
(Trainees capable of singing high notes)

1204
01:06:42,949 --> 01:06:45,648
Naturally, YONGHYUN took a lot of the parts.

1205
01:06:46,088 --> 01:06:49,718
Then I lost confidence in my team's distribution of parts.

1206
01:06:51,729 --> 01:06:53,059
I felt confused.

1207
01:06:54,059 --> 01:06:57,059
I have fewer parts than before, but I will overcome the crisis...

1208
01:06:57,929 --> 01:07:00,697
by making my voice tone distinctive...

1209
01:07:00,698 --> 01:07:02,738
and using harmonies.

1210
01:07:02,999 --> 01:07:04,338
I was given two parts.

1211
01:07:04,608 --> 01:07:06,039
I will do my best.

1212
01:07:06,468 --> 01:07:08,238
I will make myself shine here.

1213
01:07:09,139 --> 01:07:11,749
Take me with you

1214
01:07:11,849 --> 01:07:13,209
(How was it?)

1215
01:07:14,349 --> 01:07:15,579
Take me

1216
01:07:16,119 --> 01:07:19,718
(KIM SUNGMIN is begging to take him along.)

1217
01:07:21,059 --> 01:07:23,189
I got a phrase.

1218
01:07:24,189 --> 01:07:25,888
"Take me with you."

1219
01:07:25,889 --> 01:07:27,729
JUNWON wanted...

1220
01:07:27,929 --> 01:07:30,898
to give me a part, no matter what.

1221
01:07:31,329 --> 01:07:33,027
To show your presence,

1222
01:07:33,028 --> 01:07:34,737
you need to tell the audience,

1223
01:07:34,738 --> 01:07:36,438
- "Take me with you." - Yes.

1224
01:07:36,439 --> 01:07:39,038
Then what should you do? You need to express emotions more.

1225
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:40,438
- Take me with you - Like this.

1226
01:07:40,439 --> 01:07:42,479
Take me with you

1227
01:07:42,709 --> 01:07:44,408
(Like something will happen if you're not taken)

1228
01:07:44,409 --> 01:07:45,607
Try to practice like this even if you have to press it.

1229
01:07:45,608 --> 01:07:47,378
Take me with you

1230
01:07:47,508 --> 01:07:48,817
You need to practice no matter what.

1231
01:07:48,818 --> 01:07:51,217
(Expressing desperation according to the Director's advice)

1232
01:07:51,218 --> 01:07:52,788
See? That's how you should practice.

1233
01:07:52,789 --> 01:07:53,848
You need to overdo it like that.

1234
01:07:53,849 --> 01:07:56,118
(Very desperate)

1235
01:07:56,119 --> 01:07:58,758
Great! That's how you should approach your practice.

1236
01:07:59,459 --> 01:08:02,258
I was given only two parts. I needed to stand out doing them.

1237
01:08:02,528 --> 01:08:05,999
That's what I decided, and I'll show you what I practised today.

1238
01:08:06,168 --> 01:08:07,298
Take

1239
01:08:08,238 --> 01:08:10,668
(Warming up to be desperate)

1240
01:08:11,439 --> 01:08:15,738
(A desperate request from a newbie trainee)

1241
01:08:16,208 --> 01:08:17,577
(Urgent notice to the trainees)

1242
01:08:17,578 --> 01:08:19,377
Now, you need to start...

1243
01:08:19,378 --> 01:08:21,779
to select center positions.

1244
01:08:22,078 --> 01:08:23,877
A center member in a vocal position team...

1245
01:08:23,878 --> 01:08:26,449
will sing the song's highlight.

1246
01:08:26,788 --> 01:08:28,287
I looked at the part,

1247
01:08:28,288 --> 01:08:32,288
and thought I could do it and applied right away.

1248
01:08:32,788 --> 01:08:36,729
I received a compliment that my voice matched this song.

1249
01:08:37,029 --> 01:08:39,627
JIWOON sings pretty nicely.

1250
01:08:39,628 --> 01:08:41,337
(He received a compliment from the evaluation.)

1251
01:08:41,338 --> 01:08:43,038
He's good.

1252
01:08:43,599 --> 01:08:46,309
I'd like to apply for the center position,

1253
01:08:47,008 --> 01:08:50,739
and I think I'll do it well if I'm given that position.

1254
01:08:51,149 --> 01:08:52,747
I'm confident...

1255
01:08:52,748 --> 01:08:55,077
that I can show a steady performance...

1256
01:08:55,078 --> 01:08:57,748
with nice facial expressions...

1257
01:08:58,149 --> 01:08:59,489
to express the mood of this song.

1258
01:09:00,949 --> 01:09:02,157
Here's the result.

1259
01:09:02,158 --> 01:09:04,058
(Which trainees will take the center position?)

1260
01:09:04,059 --> 01:09:05,658
Trainee KWON YONGHYUN will take it.

1261
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:07,828
Congratulations.

1262
01:09:08,599 --> 01:09:10,297
The pressure is on.

1263
01:09:10,298 --> 01:09:12,699
- I will work harder. - Congratulations.

1264
01:09:13,298 --> 01:09:14,797
Thank you, everyone. I'll work hard.

1265
01:09:14,798 --> 01:09:17,569
(It seemed they finished the process amicably.)

1266
01:09:17,838 --> 01:09:20,808
To be honest, YONGHYUN took a lot of parts,

1267
01:09:20,809 --> 01:09:22,208
and now he's in the center position too.

1268
01:09:22,508 --> 01:09:24,478
That's why I didn't vote for YONGHYUN.

1269
01:09:24,479 --> 01:09:25,948
Even if YONGHYUN isn't in the center position,

1270
01:09:25,949 --> 01:09:28,717
he has a greater presence than the center position.

1271
01:09:28,718 --> 01:09:29,718
I agree.

1272
01:09:29,719 --> 01:09:32,618
And although those parts belong to YONGHYUN,

1273
01:09:33,088 --> 01:09:35,488
he doesn't need to take them.

1274
01:09:35,489 --> 01:09:37,728
Right. Anyone can sing those parts.

1275
01:09:37,729 --> 01:09:38,889
So...

1276
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:43,229
Gosh. It's a shame I didn't get the center position.

1277
01:09:44,158 --> 01:09:46,168
I thought my position in the team improved.

1278
01:09:47,168 --> 01:09:48,599
I have six seconds to perform.

1279
01:09:48,798 --> 01:09:50,239
JUNWON has eight seconds.

1280
01:09:51,639 --> 01:09:54,309
Thinking that, it feels like I'm in big trouble.

1281
01:09:56,439 --> 01:09:57,678
(That night, members are troubled thinking about their parts.)

1282
01:09:57,679 --> 01:09:59,778
During the two and a half minutes we have,

1283
01:09:59,779 --> 01:10:01,849
YONGHYUN performs around one and a half minutes.

1284
01:10:01,979 --> 01:10:04,819
The introduction takes 30 seconds. Is it 20?

1285
01:10:04,989 --> 01:10:06,649
He takes 1 minute and 30 to 40 seconds.

1286
01:10:07,859 --> 01:10:10,158
He's in the prelude and ending too.

1287
01:10:10,359 --> 01:10:13,729
- Gosh, my life is ruined. - Each of us has eight seconds.

1288
01:10:13,929 --> 01:10:16,529
No, you only have 1 part, so you'll take about 4 seconds.

1289
01:10:17,359 --> 01:10:19,269
Seriously.

1290
01:10:19,998 --> 01:10:23,368
I wondered if they would see it as a team performance.

1291
01:10:24,269 --> 01:10:28,139
From the chorus and the ad-lib,

1292
01:10:28,279 --> 01:10:31,279
he's performing all the highlights, in fact.

1293
01:10:32,309 --> 01:10:34,449
I was worried that the audience would see it...

1294
01:10:35,019 --> 01:10:36,649
as YONGHYUN's performance.

1295
01:10:39,288 --> 01:10:40,819
It's not easy for me to bring up this topic.

1296
01:10:42,319 --> 01:10:44,588
You know,

1297
01:10:44,889 --> 01:10:46,788
when we selected the center position,

1298
01:10:47,559 --> 01:10:49,859
YONGHYUN was selected as our center.

1299
01:10:50,758 --> 01:10:54,769
This song lasts for two and a half minutes from start to end.

1300
01:10:55,498 --> 01:10:57,238
And you perform...

1301
01:10:57,239 --> 01:10:59,568
- for one and a half minutes. - I see.

1302
01:10:59,569 --> 01:11:02,007
And the other 5 members perform for a total of 1 minute.

1303
01:11:02,008 --> 01:11:05,649
Each member performs 10 to 12 seconds at maximum.

1304
01:11:06,248 --> 01:11:11,889
I thought, "Would the audience see it as a team performance?"

1305
01:11:11,989 --> 01:11:13,849
That's what I'm worried about.

1306
01:11:14,019 --> 01:11:15,258
I was taken aback.

1307
01:11:15,519 --> 01:11:19,628
We decided on the center position by vote yesterday.

1308
01:11:20,088 --> 01:11:24,429
Hearing that we need to reverse the decision...

1309
01:11:25,569 --> 01:11:27,328
Honestly, although I'm smiling now,

1310
01:11:27,968 --> 01:11:29,468
I feel kind of taken aback.

1311
01:11:34,508 --> 01:11:36,109
I understand your opinion.

1312
01:11:36,878 --> 01:11:39,979
I'll give up the center position. That's the right thing to do.

1313
01:11:41,279 --> 01:11:44,748
It was a shame, of course.

1314
01:11:45,088 --> 01:11:49,158
I felt so excited to take the center position...

1315
01:11:49,458 --> 01:11:52,858
and was preparing for the performance,

1316
01:11:52,859 --> 01:11:54,929
although it lasted for a day.

1317
01:11:55,298 --> 01:11:57,698
Then I thought it wouldn't be all that bad.

1318
01:11:57,699 --> 01:11:59,728
The parts I yield to the other members...

1319
01:11:59,729 --> 01:12:03,368
will be used by them to show their talents.

1320
01:12:03,939 --> 01:12:05,867
If my team members feel happy,

1321
01:12:05,868 --> 01:12:08,407
and if that helps with the team's performance,

1322
01:12:08,408 --> 01:12:10,279
that's a good thing for me.

1323
01:12:10,609 --> 01:12:13,748
So I changed my mind to let someone else do it.

1324
01:12:23,458 --> 01:12:26,328
("Don't Go" performed by Bee Boys)

1325
01:12:27,029 --> 01:12:28,359
They look nice.

1326
01:12:28,458 --> 01:12:29,699
Let's go!

1327
01:12:30,529 --> 01:12:32,468
(SUNGMIN)

1328
01:12:41,378 --> 01:12:42,908
It's totally different from the interim evaluation.

1329
01:12:49,048 --> 01:12:51,078
It's really awesome.

1330
01:12:59,229 --> 01:13:01,229
(JUNWON)

1331
01:13:06,029 --> 01:13:07,099
They're cute.

1332
01:13:19,309 --> 01:13:20,748
Look at YONGHYUN!

1333
01:13:21,109 --> 01:13:23,479
It's so nice. YONGHYUN is nailing it!

1334
01:13:37,899 --> 01:13:38,998
He's a good singer.

1335
01:13:39,569 --> 01:13:41,569
YONGHYUN gives such a stable performance.

1336
01:14:15,599 --> 01:14:17,139
(JIWOON, SUNGMIN)

1337
01:14:40,529 --> 01:14:41,657
What was that?

1338
01:14:41,658 --> 01:14:43,729
- What did JUNWON just do? - He did it nicely.

1339
01:14:51,739 --> 01:14:53,467
(Check out the full performance on the PROJECT 7's YouTube channel.)

1340
01:14:53,468 --> 01:14:54,837

(AHN JUNWON)

1347
01:15:11,218 --> 01:15:13,158
They made eye contact with the audience too.

1348
01:15:13,429 --> 01:15:15,529
It seems that they have great teamwork.

1349
01:15:15,699 --> 01:15:17,257
Trainee AHN JUNWON.

1350
01:15:17,258 --> 01:15:18,328
Yes.

1351
01:15:18,729 --> 01:15:22,099
Please say a word to your team members as a leader.

1352
01:15:23,399 --> 01:15:24,498
Well...

1353
01:15:24,838 --> 01:15:26,038
You're awesome!

1354
01:15:26,338 --> 01:15:28,179
What is it?

1355
01:15:37,019 --> 01:15:39,319
First of all,

1356
01:15:40,319 --> 01:15:42,258
I wasn't a leader...

1357
01:15:42,958 --> 01:15:46,059
who was very competent or had a lot of experience.

1358
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:49,998
But my members listened to me very well. I appreciate that.

1359
01:15:50,458 --> 01:15:52,298
I learned so much doing this.

1360
01:15:52,968 --> 01:15:54,598
I hope we improve together,

1361
01:15:54,599 --> 01:15:58,668
and show you lots of good performances.

1362
01:15:59,038 --> 01:16:01,408
I thank my team members. I love you.

1363
01:16:01,538 --> 01:16:03,139
- I love you. - I love you.

1364
01:16:03,439 --> 01:16:07,048
So many things happened in such a short time.

1365
01:16:07,508 --> 01:16:11,518
I relied on my team members during that time.

1366
01:16:11,519 --> 01:16:12,819
(Team "Don't Go" proceeded while relying on each other.)

1367
01:16:12,918 --> 01:16:16,417
I think the performance shone brighter thanks to team members.

1368
01:16:16,418 --> 01:16:18,788
I'm grateful to the members.

1369
01:16:19,889 --> 01:16:22,327
Here's the last vocal position performance.

1370
01:16:22,328 --> 01:16:25,099
The trainees are confident...

1371
01:16:25,699 --> 01:16:29,199
that after World Assemblers watch their performance,

1372
01:16:29,939 --> 01:16:31,668
the audience will fall in love with them.

1373
01:16:32,439 --> 01:16:33,708
It's a song by ONF.

are the team that will make you fall in love. We're Team...

Where will you assemble?

- Trainee KIM YOUNGHOON. - Yes.

1396
01:17:20,519 --> 01:17:23,018
I heard that only Team "We Must Love..."

1397
01:17:23,019 --> 01:17:24,788
has choreography among the four vocal teams.

1398
01:17:24,828 --> 01:17:26,059
That's right.

1399
01:17:26,458 --> 01:17:29,628
"We Must Love" is the only dance song.

1400
01:17:33,399 --> 01:17:35,298
(The training room for Team "We Must Love")

1401
01:17:35,699 --> 01:17:39,268
We'll make a V like this when we move one step.

1402
01:17:39,269 --> 01:17:40,309
And...

1403
01:17:41,708 --> 01:17:44,778
(The same vocal training room)

1404
01:17:44,779 --> 01:17:46,278
The shoelaces keep untying

1405
01:17:46,279 --> 01:17:47,747
Stand up and move.

1406
01:17:47,748 --> 01:17:48,878
(Two different practices in the same vocal training room?)

1407
01:17:49,418 --> 01:17:51,118
When we sing this part,

1408
01:17:51,918 --> 01:17:54,288
you can move a step.

1409
01:17:54,748 --> 01:17:56,458
We're a vocal team,

1410
01:17:56,918 --> 01:17:59,488
but we have a dance song.

1411
01:17:59,489 --> 01:18:01,458
I think that's the most difficult part.

1412
01:18:02,798 --> 01:18:04,928
- I want there to be a dance. - Dance?

1413
01:18:04,929 --> 01:18:09,139
I think the others will sing while standing.

1414
01:18:09,439 --> 01:18:12,367
We can tell that from the songs.

1415
01:18:12,368 --> 01:18:13,368
(They're planning to set themselves apart by dancing.)

1416
01:18:13,369 --> 01:18:16,007
If we go there with only vocals,

1417
01:18:16,008 --> 01:18:18,679
I think we'll be at a disadvantage compared to the other vocal teams.

1418
01:18:19,149 --> 01:18:21,349
We can do this,

1419
01:18:21,479 --> 01:18:23,747
and one person can do this.

1420
01:18:23,748 --> 01:18:26,618
YOUNGHOON is making the formation,

1421
01:18:26,949 --> 01:18:29,757
and I'm working...

1422
01:18:29,758 --> 01:18:33,189
on making the choreography where needed.

1423
01:18:35,399 --> 01:18:36,657
We're not supposed to hold, right?

1424
01:18:36,658 --> 01:18:37,928
- No. - Later...

1425
01:18:37,929 --> 01:18:39,199
I think you should...

1426
01:18:39,529 --> 01:18:41,938
explain one more time to JEONGYUN.

1427
01:18:41,939 --> 01:18:43,368
JEONGYUN didn't understand well.

1428
01:18:43,739 --> 01:18:45,238
You'll love me

1429
01:18:45,239 --> 01:18:47,408
- We would hit each other. - You should go this way.

1430
01:18:47,439 --> 01:18:49,078
Let's start.

1431
01:18:49,508 --> 01:18:52,348
(Several trainees can't follow the choreography.)

1432
01:18:52,349 --> 01:18:53,878
- Like that. - Okay.

1433
01:18:57,748 --> 01:19:01,588
Is it only the first verse...

1434
01:19:02,989 --> 01:19:03,989
with so much choreography?

1435
01:19:03,990 --> 01:19:06,358
Yes. But there isn't that much choreography.

1436
01:19:06,359 --> 01:19:08,189
I thought it was more of a formation.

1437
01:19:08,998 --> 01:19:11,628
There were members who were having a hard time following.

1438
01:19:12,498 --> 01:19:14,797
I think the members are a bit exhausted...

1439
01:19:14,798 --> 01:19:17,038
and confused.

1440
01:19:17,769 --> 01:19:19,069
Look.

1441
01:19:20,338 --> 01:19:22,609
Two, three, four, and...

1442
01:19:23,109 --> 01:19:24,979
I know one thing

1443
01:19:25,479 --> 01:19:26,479
Hold on.

1444
01:19:27,408 --> 01:19:29,679
We have to focus more on the vocals.

1445
01:19:30,078 --> 01:19:33,087
I think we need to practice for many hours...

1446
01:19:33,088 --> 01:19:36,718
on building harmony to improve the quality.

1447
01:19:37,088 --> 01:19:38,158
Pull it behind.

1448
01:19:38,489 --> 01:19:40,189
That's right. And pull it down.

1449
01:19:40,729 --> 01:19:42,457
I thought,

1450
01:19:42,458 --> 01:19:44,457
"If we work on this well,"

1451
01:19:44,458 --> 01:19:46,569
"we'll be able to get a good result."

1452
01:19:47,099 --> 01:19:48,399
Shall we sing?

1453
01:19:49,069 --> 01:19:50,769
Let's concentrate on this.

1454
01:19:50,998 --> 01:19:52,907
Let's do it until that part.

1455
01:19:52,908 --> 01:19:54,639
(The day ended after they danced the whole day.)

1456
01:19:54,968 --> 01:19:57,508
I think we shouldn't do something that's risky.

1457
01:20:00,078 --> 01:20:01,078
That's my honest opinion.

1458
01:20:01,479 --> 01:20:03,949
That's true.

1459
01:20:05,288 --> 01:20:08,018
There are so many things. We're a vocal team.

1460
01:20:08,019 --> 01:20:10,118
Singing should be the main aspect in the end.

1461
01:20:10,389 --> 01:20:11,658
We should show them how we sing.

1462
01:20:12,288 --> 01:20:13,958
We can just sing.

1463
01:20:14,189 --> 01:20:15,797
Let's do it like that.

1464
01:20:15,798 --> 01:20:18,769
(People are getting worried in the training room.)

1465
01:20:20,729 --> 01:20:23,498
This stage will decide whether we pass or get eliminated.

1466
01:20:23,899 --> 01:20:27,639
I want to focus on ending the stage perfectly.

1467
01:20:28,939 --> 01:20:31,708
If our aim is to show our vocal skills...

1468
01:20:31,748 --> 01:20:34,808
The dance teams would be amazing.

1469
01:20:34,809 --> 01:20:37,319
They won't sing. They'll just dance.

1470
01:20:37,378 --> 01:20:38,449
They're good at it too.

1471
01:20:38,489 --> 01:20:41,889
But if we dance from the start like this,

1472
01:20:42,658 --> 01:20:44,319
I think people will keep comparing us and them.

1473
01:20:44,918 --> 01:20:47,359
Then do we forget about everything we practised so far?

1474
01:20:47,788 --> 01:20:50,599
I don't think what we've done so far...

1475
01:20:50,798 --> 01:20:52,828
harms anything.

1476
01:20:53,029 --> 01:20:54,698
We're a vocal team,

1477
01:20:54,699 --> 01:20:57,769
but the dance wasn't too much.

1478
01:20:58,139 --> 01:21:01,108
I think it increases the chance of us making mistakes.

1479
01:21:01,109 --> 01:21:04,779
I think the chances of forgetting the lines while dancing...

1480
01:21:04,908 --> 01:21:06,679
is very dangerous.

1481
01:21:09,179 --> 01:21:12,988
The dance shouldn't stand out so much like a live performance,

1482
01:21:12,989 --> 01:21:15,388
but if there is no dance,

1483
01:21:15,389 --> 01:21:17,819
the song being a dance song would be meaningless.

1484
01:21:18,359 --> 01:21:21,728
I think finding the middle ground...

1485
01:21:21,729 --> 01:21:22,797
(They can't find an agreement.)

1486
01:21:22,798 --> 01:21:24,998
was the point of discussion.

1487
01:21:25,998 --> 01:21:29,968
(What conclusion did they come to?)

1488
01:21:39,649 --> 01:21:42,618

1489

He's so good.

1491
01:22:01,968 --> 01:22:03,069

ended in 2 minutes and 30 seconds.

"I think I'd perform better the next time."

I heard this team was voted...

1545
01:25:57,269 --> 01:26:00,368
the weakest dance team.

1546
01:26:00,908 --> 01:26:03,938
Yes, because we're a team of people who gathered...

1547
01:26:03,939 --> 01:26:07,708
after not being selected into other teams.

1548
01:26:07,949 --> 01:26:10,417
They wanted to go to vocal teams, but they were sent out.

1549
01:26:10,418 --> 01:26:12,988
They went to the rap team, but they were sent out again.

1550
01:26:12,989 --> 01:26:16,218
It's a team of members who were sent out multiple times.

During the team evaluation mission,

1562
01:26:43,149 --> 01:26:44,748
I hurt my ankle.

1563

We were very worried when the team was formed.

1566
01:26:54,788 --> 01:26:57,798
What's more, the situation was bad.

1575
01:27:19,319 --> 01:27:20,418
- Okay. - Okay.

1576
01:27:20,718 --> 01:27:22,958
I'm really looking forward to the performance by Team "Kiwi."

1577
01:27:23,918 --> 01:27:25,319
There are two people with leg injuries.

1578
01:27:25,729 --> 01:27:26,929
That's true.

1579
01:27:27,088 --> 01:27:32,059
Team "Kiwi" is a team with the weakest dancers.

1580
01:27:32,668 --> 01:27:35,098
I want you all to perform with confidence.

1581
01:27:35,099 --> 01:27:36,168
- Okay. - Okay.

1583
01:27:37,699 --> 01:27:39,207

1587
01:27:56,158 --> 01:27:58,019

1588

I was very worried about this team.

1589
01:28:02,628 --> 01:28:05,429
I was very shocked because they did much better than I expected.

1590
01:28:05,929 --> 01:28:07,828
You picked the main dancer well.

01:28:13,639 --> 01:28:15,139
was nice.

1594
01:28:15,508 --> 01:28:18,279
Honestly, I thought you'd be the weakest team,

1595
01:28:18,679 --> 01:28:20,548
but you performed the best out of the four teams.

1596
01:28:20,649 --> 01:28:22,778
- Thank you. - Thank you!

1597
01:28:22,779 --> 01:28:23,978
(The weakest team received the best evaluation.)

1598
01:28:23,979 --> 01:28:25,479
There was a bit of hope.

1599
01:28:25,889 --> 01:28:27,819
(When selecting the position song)

1600
01:28:28,118 --> 01:28:32,828
Actually, I thought people didn't come because of me.

1601
01:28:33,389 --> 01:28:35,628
My strength is in dancing.

1602
01:28:35,729 --> 01:28:37,797
I should do what I can to help.

1603
01:28:37,798 --> 01:28:40,228
(Trainee KIM HYUNWOO tried to be of help to the team.)

1604
01:28:40,229 --> 01:28:41,768
It was a short period of time,

1605
01:28:41,769 --> 01:28:44,698
and there were members who never danced before.

1606
01:28:44,699 --> 01:28:47,507
It would have been very difficult if HYUNWOO wasn't there.

1607
01:28:47,508 --> 01:28:48,508
It works.

1608
01:28:48,639 --> 01:28:50,938
I think Team "Kiwi" was the best team for me.

1609
01:28:50,939 --> 01:28:53,348
I think Team "Kiwi" comes in first place.

1610
01:28:53,349 --> 01:28:55,818
I also think Team "Kiwi" is in first place.

1611
01:28:55,819 --> 01:28:56,978
Thank you!

1612
01:28:56,979 --> 01:29:00,087
I'm so glad that my abilities...

1613
01:29:00,088 --> 01:29:01,117
could help the team.

1614
01:29:01,118 --> 01:29:02,319
Well done.

1615
01:29:02,958 --> 01:29:04,558
(Exclaiming)

1616
01:29:04,559 --> 01:29:05,928
We came first!

1617
01:29:05,929 --> 01:29:07,587
We're the MVP. The first.

1618
01:29:07,588 --> 01:29:08,688
Right.

1619
01:29:08,689 --> 01:29:10,997
We're the first-place team.

1620
01:29:10,998 --> 01:29:12,529
Three people said our team was the best.

1621
01:29:12,599 --> 01:29:13,867
We came last.

1622
01:29:13,868 --> 01:29:15,069
I envy you.

1623
01:29:15,498 --> 01:29:17,439
I want to dance too.

1624
01:29:20,338 --> 01:29:21,667
Why are you about to cry again?

1625
01:29:21,668 --> 01:29:22,678
(Things seem to be serious in the training room.)

1626
01:29:22,679 --> 01:29:23,838
What's wrong?

1627
01:29:23,878 --> 01:29:25,078
When making the formation...

1628
01:29:26,479 --> 01:29:29,979
(He leaves the room.)

1629
01:29:32,048 --> 01:29:34,649
(What happened to Team "Kiwi" that used to be cheerful?)

1630
01:29:35,718 --> 01:29:38,928
I have something to tell you.

1631
01:29:38,929 --> 01:29:40,088
What is it?

1632
01:29:41,489 --> 01:29:45,258
Before coming here,

1633
01:29:46,199 --> 01:29:47,199
I was told...

1634
01:29:47,868 --> 01:29:50,099
to be admitted to the hospital not come to the camp.

1635
01:29:51,069 --> 01:29:53,908
My ankle should get better with time,

1636
01:29:54,538 --> 01:29:57,779
but instead of getting better, the pain worsened.

1637
01:29:57,939 --> 01:29:59,978
One, two.

1638
01:29:59,979 --> 01:30:01,077
This is...

1639
01:30:01,078 --> 01:30:05,788
The ligaments are very torn.

1640
01:30:06,149 --> 01:30:07,588
It looks like...

1641
01:30:08,418 --> 01:30:12,217
you'd need to rest for at least two weeks.

1642
01:30:12,218 --> 01:30:13,458
You need to rest.

1643
01:30:14,889 --> 01:30:16,098
I think...

1644
01:30:16,099 --> 01:30:17,099
(He decided to go to the hospital in the end.)

1645
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:18,359
I better go to the hospital.

1646
01:30:18,828 --> 01:30:21,069
I'm really sorry,

1647
01:30:24,239 --> 01:30:27,139
but I don't think I'll be joining you for this performance.

1648
01:30:28,468 --> 01:30:30,878
If I can't help them on the stage,

1649
01:30:31,739 --> 01:30:33,779
I want to be helpful with my skills,

1650
01:30:34,179 --> 01:30:37,548
but even if I want to teach them, I can't do that because of my leg.

1651
01:30:37,849 --> 01:30:39,989
I felt really bad...

1652
01:30:40,418 --> 01:30:43,288
that I could only sit and watch them.

1653
01:30:43,859 --> 01:30:45,258
I'm very sad,

1654
01:30:46,458 --> 01:30:49,059
but I think I should put that down and focus on getting treated.

1655
01:30:49,628 --> 01:30:51,199
I think that's the right way.

1656
01:30:51,958 --> 01:30:55,599
I'm very sorry. I'm sorry.

1657
01:30:57,368 --> 01:30:59,438
It's okay. Get well soon.

1658
01:30:59,439 --> 01:31:00,608
- It can't be helped. - Right.

1659
01:31:00,609 --> 01:31:01,667
Your body comes first.

1660
01:31:01,668 --> 01:31:04,278
You should get better soon.

1661
01:31:04,279 --> 01:31:05,337
Right.

1662
01:31:05,338 --> 01:31:07,679
I felt a bit empty.

1663
01:31:07,979 --> 01:31:11,078
He was someone who held me together.

1664
01:31:11,718 --> 01:31:12,818
HYUNWOO.

1665
01:31:12,819 --> 01:31:13,918
Well done.

1666
01:31:14,319 --> 01:31:15,918
Good luck.

1667
01:31:15,958 --> 01:31:17,019
I'll cheer for you.

1668
01:31:17,519 --> 01:31:18,788
Well done.

1669
01:31:22,258 --> 01:31:24,498
Bye, brother.

1670
01:31:24,529 --> 01:31:26,327
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1671
01:31:26,328 --> 01:31:27,328
(Cheerful until the end)

1672
01:31:27,329 --> 01:31:28,498
Let's go.

1673
01:31:29,199 --> 01:31:30,699
Hold on.

1674
01:31:32,069 --> 01:31:34,908
I could bear it for the most part thanks to HYUNWOO.

1675
01:31:35,708 --> 01:31:37,109
I'm trying to pull myself together.

1676
01:31:37,708 --> 01:31:39,648
Then we have a part that needs to be changed.

1677
01:31:39,649 --> 01:31:40,748
(He focuses and edits the choreography.)

1678
01:31:41,349 --> 01:31:42,848
The last part...

1679
01:31:42,849 --> 01:31:44,078
(They have to divide the parts.)

1680
01:31:44,279 --> 01:31:46,118
That leaves only these two anyway.

1681
01:31:46,248 --> 01:31:47,389
One of you two.

1682
01:31:48,349 --> 01:31:50,889
Do you want to do it? Why are you about to cry again?

1683
01:31:51,519 --> 01:31:52,828
- Why are you about to cry again? - What happened?

1684
01:31:55,328 --> 01:31:56,328
Hey.

1685
01:31:58,559 --> 01:32:00,269
What is it, INJAE?

1686
01:32:03,099 --> 01:32:04,967
I can't do his part.

1687
01:32:04,968 --> 01:32:06,008
What?

1688
01:32:06,239 --> 01:32:07,768
You can't do HYUNWOO's part?

1689
01:32:07,769 --> 01:32:10,309
- Yes. - What will we do?

1690
01:32:11,939 --> 01:32:15,208
I must have been relying on HYUNWOO a lot.

1691
01:32:15,408 --> 01:32:16,418
Right.

1692
01:32:17,578 --> 01:32:20,087
(He relied on his skills...)

1693
01:32:20,088 --> 01:32:23,618
(and him as a person.)

1694
01:32:24,189 --> 01:32:26,328
He listened to me well.

1695
01:32:26,389 --> 01:32:28,859
(His absence left a huge gap in Team "Kiwi.")

1696
01:32:29,658 --> 01:32:30,858
(Trainee JOONWOO isn't fine too.)

1697
01:32:30,859 --> 01:32:33,868
Honestly, if HYUNWOO came to this team...

1698
01:32:34,328 --> 01:32:35,699
without any injury,

1699
01:32:36,139 --> 01:32:39,968
I think he would have been the main dancer and center.

1700
01:32:40,838 --> 01:32:42,639
That's why...

1701
01:32:43,109 --> 01:32:44,608
I feel bad about it.

1702
01:32:44,609 --> 01:32:45,639
(He created the choreography even when it wasn't his part.)

1703
01:32:46,508 --> 01:32:48,877
I felt very grateful too.

1704
01:32:48,878 --> 01:32:49,878
(He was a reliable helper.)

1705
01:32:49,879 --> 01:32:52,377
I feel like I had to do better too.

1706
01:32:52,378 --> 01:32:53,389
(As the main dancer)

1707
01:32:53,449 --> 01:32:55,548
(What influence did Trainee HYUNWOO's absence make?)

1708
01:32:55,788 --> 01:32:57,118
What's with the props?

1709
01:32:57,288 --> 01:32:58,458
They're whiteboards.

1710
01:32:58,918 --> 01:32:59,928
(Curious)

1711
01:32:59,929 --> 01:33:01,158
What is that?

1712
01:33:01,328 --> 01:33:02,729
I guess they decorated it themselves.

1713
01:33:03,128 --> 01:33:06,068
- There's, "I miss you, HYUNWOO." - "Meeting after five minutes."

1714
01:33:06,069 --> 01:33:09,199
"I miss you, HYUNWOO." That's so sad.

1715
01:33:10,939 --> 01:33:14,038
I'm taking HYUNWOO's part.

1716
01:33:14,139 --> 01:33:17,239
So I want us to come in first place.

1717
01:33:18,508 --> 01:33:21,008
- It's sexy from the beginning. - What's going to happen?

1718
01:33:21,078 --> 01:33:22,679
(When do we get off work?)

1719
01:33:34,689 --> 01:33:35,828
Goodness.

1720
01:33:38,529 --> 01:33:39,769
Yes.

1721
01:33:45,338 --> 01:33:46,508
That's it!

1722
01:33:49,979 --> 01:33:52,008
- What is that? - That's a twist.

1723
01:33:52,748 --> 01:33:53,779
What is this?

1724
01:34:05,458 --> 01:34:06,588
This is nice.

1725
01:34:25,708 --> 01:34:26,779
YOONSUE.

1726
01:34:32,689 --> 01:34:34,519
SATOSHI is really sexy.

1727
01:34:34,819 --> 01:34:36,088
That's sexy.

1728
01:34:39,489 --> 01:34:41,458
Why is SATOSHI so good?

1729
01:34:46,368 --> 01:34:47,429
This is fun.

1730
01:34:48,569 --> 01:34:49,769
It's like a musical.

1731
01:34:59,908 --> 01:35:01,149
They're good-looking.

1732
01:35:05,578 --> 01:35:06,618
How cute.

1733
01:35:06,989 --> 01:35:08,618
What is this? It's so fun.

1734
01:35:09,389 --> 01:35:10,989
What is this? Why are they so good?

1735
01:35:13,029 --> 01:35:14,029
It's cute.

1736
01:35:14,828 --> 01:35:16,229
Why is SVIAT so cute?

1737
01:35:17,529 --> 01:35:19,269
HYEONGSEOK.

1738
01:35:20,128 --> 01:35:21,968
- Nice! - That's cool!

(Choreography creation section)

1743
01:35:37,578 --> 01:35:38,819
That's amazing.

1744
01:35:40,048 --> 01:35:41,389
(Goodness)

(Choreography creation section)

1747
01:35:52,929 --> 01:35:53,998
That's cool.

1748
01:35:55,099 --> 01:36:01,038
(Choreography creation section)

1749
01:36:13,588 --> 01:36:16,088
What? Why is it so cool?

1750
01:36:16,418 --> 01:36:17,689
What was that?

1751
01:36:20,859 --> 01:36:22,287
- My gosh. - Look at them.

1752
01:36:22,288 --> 01:36:23,529
Amazing.

1753
01:36:23,798 --> 01:36:24,899
They're good.

1754
01:36:25,729 --> 01:36:26,868
Oh, my gosh!

1755
01:36:27,128 --> 01:36:28,269
All right.

1756
01:36:29,838 --> 01:36:32,139
Who would've thought of them as the bottom-ranking team?

1757
01:36:35,639 --> 01:36:37,309
Let's go!

1758
01:36:38,479 --> 01:36:40,449
Go for it!

1759
01:36:41,309 --> 01:36:44,149
- Look at them. - It's like a musical.

1760
01:36:45,748 --> 01:36:47,149
They're good.

1761
01:36:49,048 --> 01:36:50,658
All right.

1762
01:37:07,868 --> 01:37:09,038
Let's go!

1763
01:37:10,378 --> 01:37:11,439
That was great.

1764
01:37:21,418 --> 01:37:24,717
(Check out the full performance on the PROJECT 7's YouTube channel.)

1765
01:37:24,718 --> 01:37:28,088
(Fancams and the center's videos will be released after the show.)

1766
01:37:29,359 --> 01:37:31,699
- All right! - Gosh.

1767
01:37:31,828 --> 01:37:33,729
- Oh, my gosh. - What was that?

1768
01:37:34,468 --> 01:37:35,698
What just happened?

1769
01:37:35,699 --> 01:37:38,298
- What was that? - It's so shocking I got chills.

1770
01:37:38,769 --> 01:37:41,238
- They're good. - They did so well.

1771
01:37:41,239 --> 01:37:43,537
- They were good. - We were so worried about them.

1772
01:37:43,538 --> 01:37:45,139
- They were so good. - I agree.

1773
01:37:45,309 --> 01:37:47,478
Look at them.

1774
01:37:47,479 --> 01:37:49,349
Their teamwork was amazing.

1775
01:37:50,048 --> 01:37:52,078
- Who said they were the worst? - Seriously.

1776
01:37:52,418 --> 01:37:53,788
Oh, my gosh.

1777
01:37:54,548 --> 01:37:55,689
They're good.

1778
01:37:55,748 --> 01:37:57,689
- They're unbeatable. - I agree.

1779
01:37:58,618 --> 01:38:01,058
Their performance showed...

1780
01:38:01,059 --> 01:38:05,158
how an office worker's rebellion turned out to be a dream.

1781
01:38:05,628 --> 01:38:07,367
That was so fun to watch.

1782
01:38:07,368 --> 01:38:09,398
Are they from "Street Man Fighter"? They look like it.

1783
01:38:09,399 --> 01:38:10,468
Are they?

1784
01:38:10,699 --> 01:38:12,338
Why are you crying?

1785
01:38:12,439 --> 01:38:14,508
Our baby's crying.

1786
01:38:15,408 --> 01:38:17,738
- Our baby... - I can now say this.

1787
01:38:17,739 --> 01:38:20,208
- We got to see his weak side. - This is our baby.

1788
01:38:21,048 --> 01:38:22,979
To Team "WE-KEY" who worked so hard,

1789
01:38:23,349 --> 01:38:26,318
to our leader HAJOON, and to all teammates,

1790
01:38:26,319 --> 01:38:27,948
including HYUNWOO, who wasn't able to join us,

1791
01:38:27,949 --> 01:38:29,518
I wanted to tell them...

1792
01:38:29,519 --> 01:38:31,388
that I'm so grateful for them.

1793
01:38:31,389 --> 01:38:34,559
- WE-KEY. - Let's go!

1794
01:38:36,399 --> 01:38:41,128
(SAKURADA KENSHIN's interview of his honest feelings)

1795
01:38:43,639 --> 01:38:47,338
The practice atmosphere was scary.

1796
01:38:47,508 --> 01:38:49,838
So the atmosphere of the team...

1797
01:38:51,479 --> 01:38:52,738
The team atmosphere...

1798
01:38:52,739 --> 01:38:54,047
(Peeking at his Korean notebook)

1799
01:38:54,048 --> 01:38:56,078
The team atmosphere was bad.

1800
01:38:57,378 --> 01:39:00,889
(What issues did Team "3D" have?)

1801
01:39:01,618 --> 01:39:03,388
You have to take a deep breath in the beginning.

1802
01:39:03,389 --> 01:39:04,519
(Looking around)

1803
01:39:05,389 --> 01:39:06,728
(An interpreter was needed for each explanation.)

1804
01:39:06,729 --> 01:39:09,229
Exert some force and take a deep breath.

1805
01:39:09,699 --> 01:39:10,827
(Next is the Thai trainees.)

1806
01:39:10,828 --> 01:39:12,398
The right hand.

1807
01:39:12,399 --> 01:39:14,399
(Practising by himself using his body language)

1808
01:39:14,569 --> 01:39:16,099
Down and slide.

1809
01:39:17,069 --> 01:39:21,109
Can someone ask LYNNLYNN if he doesn't get it?

1810
01:39:22,038 --> 01:39:24,139
(Interpreting)

1811
01:39:24,739 --> 01:39:26,037
(Delays due to communication issues)

1812
01:39:26,038 --> 01:39:27,679
I think he'll get it if he practices it repeatedly.

1813
01:39:28,548 --> 01:39:30,319
The language barrier is hard to overcome.

1814
01:39:32,019 --> 01:39:35,488
(Because of that, the team atmosphere was down.)

1815
01:39:35,489 --> 01:39:38,518
Guys, this dance isn't supposed to be dreary.

1816
01:39:38,519 --> 01:39:40,858
We're all drooping right now.

1817
01:39:40,859 --> 01:39:43,157
The dance has a very gloomy vibe right now.

1818
01:39:43,158 --> 01:39:45,997
We need to be energetic when dancing to this song.

1819
01:39:45,998 --> 01:39:47,367
- Yes. - Yes.

1820
01:39:47,368 --> 01:39:50,138
I'd like to see Team "3D" first.

1821
01:39:50,139 --> 01:39:52,199
(What feedback will they get?)

1822
01:39:53,668 --> 01:39:56,978
A lot of good dancers went over to Team "3D."

1823
01:39:56,979 --> 01:39:58,638
They had a good lineup.

1824
01:39:58,639 --> 01:40:00,547
They were our rivals.

1825
01:40:00,548 --> 01:40:02,309
We were watchful of them.

1826
01:40:02,378 --> 01:40:04,878
They have a center. It's KENSHIN.

1827
01:40:05,019 --> 01:40:06,448
- Oh, my. - They had KENSHIN.

1828
01:40:06,449 --> 01:40:08,189
Is YEOJUN the main dancer?

1829
01:40:08,288 --> 01:40:10,658
They have JUNSEO and HEEJU too.

1830
01:40:10,958 --> 01:40:12,117
They also have JEONG DEUNHAESOL.

1831
01:40:12,118 --> 01:40:14,757
Everyone with the potential to be the main dancer is here.

1832
01:40:14,758 --> 01:40:15,958
I agree.

1833
01:40:52,559 --> 01:40:55,167
They had great members, so I had high expectations.

1834
01:40:55,168 --> 01:40:56,639
I was disappointed when I saw them.

1835
01:40:56,838 --> 01:41:00,707
KENSHIN, you were the center during "RUN."

1836
01:41:00,708 --> 01:41:03,979
- Yes. - You stood out in an upbeat song.

1837
01:41:04,139 --> 01:41:06,407
But now that the song has a cool and sexy tone,

1838
01:41:06,408 --> 01:41:09,718
I can see your weaknesses.

1839
01:41:09,748 --> 01:41:12,117
First of all, I have a question.

1840
01:41:12,118 --> 01:41:15,747
I want to know how you interpreted the song concept.

1841
01:41:15,748 --> 01:41:17,757
We discussed among ourselves...

1842
01:41:17,758 --> 01:41:21,087
to show a laid-back, mature, and sexy version of ourselves.

1843
01:41:21,088 --> 01:41:23,758
All right, and YEOJUN did that well.

1844
01:41:24,328 --> 01:41:26,868
- Thank you. - But here's a criticism.

1845
01:41:27,199 --> 01:41:29,399
The criticism is that only YEOJUN did it right.

1846
01:41:29,599 --> 01:41:30,739
I see.

1847
01:41:30,998 --> 01:41:33,408
The other members didn't get it.

1848
01:41:33,538 --> 01:41:34,808
They just memorized it blindly.

1849
01:41:34,809 --> 01:41:37,478
You should've picked up on this detail...

1850
01:41:37,479 --> 01:41:38,877
- in order to be the main dancer. - Yes.

1851
01:41:38,878 --> 01:41:41,907
Just dancing well by yourself doesn't make you the main dancer.

1852
01:41:41,908 --> 01:41:42,948
Got it.

1853
01:41:42,949 --> 01:41:44,478
You can remember the dance at first.

1854
01:41:44,479 --> 01:41:46,689
You can remember the choreography at first.

1855
01:41:46,819 --> 01:41:49,718
But even then, it was chaotic.

1856
01:41:50,059 --> 01:41:51,288
You need to be scolded for that.

1857
01:41:51,458 --> 01:41:53,689
The team has to stand out.

1858
01:41:53,859 --> 01:41:56,598
Right now, the others may be dancing,

1859
01:41:56,599 --> 01:41:57,859
but only JUNSEO stands out.

1860
01:41:58,559 --> 01:42:01,928
I don't think it's a good thing to stand out by myself...

1861
01:42:01,929 --> 01:42:04,098
when I'm the leader.

1862
01:42:04,099 --> 01:42:07,838
I felt like our team was the most unprepared.

1863
01:42:07,939 --> 01:42:10,078
I shouldn't make any cute expressions.

1864
01:42:10,239 --> 01:42:12,779
I needed to make a sexy expression.

1865
01:42:12,939 --> 01:42:15,907
I feel like our team hasn't fully unified yet.

1866
01:42:15,908 --> 01:42:19,048
I was sad that we couldn't give off that kind of energy.

1867
01:42:19,078 --> 01:42:20,917
If this continues,

1868
01:42:20,918 --> 01:42:22,949
I'm afraid we might get a negative result.

1869
01:42:24,359 --> 01:42:26,889
(While they're modifying their formation)

1870
01:42:27,359 --> 01:42:29,327
After this part,

1871
01:42:29,328 --> 01:42:31,698
move your hand down sexily.

1872
01:42:31,699 --> 01:42:33,268
Then point your hand like this.

1873
01:42:33,269 --> 01:42:37,568
It'll look even better if you pop it.

1874
01:42:37,569 --> 01:42:38,638
- All right. - Okay.

1875
01:42:38,639 --> 01:42:39,707
Let's do it.

1876
01:42:39,708 --> 01:42:40,868
- Come on. - Let's go.

1877
01:42:41,468 --> 01:42:43,109
This feels great. It's refreshing.

1878
01:42:43,479 --> 01:42:45,708
Mark your positions as you recall the steps.

1879
01:42:45,809 --> 01:42:47,279
- Let's go. - Let's do this.

1880
01:42:47,378 --> 01:42:49,109
(Chaotic)

1881
01:42:49,918 --> 01:42:52,479
(They can't seem to focus.)

1882
01:42:52,748 --> 01:42:54,319
Let's hang in there, guys.

1883
01:42:54,418 --> 01:42:55,819
Come on!

1884
01:42:57,658 --> 01:42:59,217
They were all cheering each other,

1885
01:42:59,218 --> 01:43:01,189
but they had a straight face on.

1886
01:43:01,689 --> 01:43:03,798
It made me feel embarrassed trying to cheer everyone up.

1887
01:43:04,059 --> 01:43:05,257
Let's go!

1888
01:43:05,258 --> 01:43:07,967
- Come on. - Only the same ones were cheering.

1889
01:43:07,968 --> 01:43:10,367
- Come on! - I know everyone's tired.

1890
01:43:10,368 --> 01:43:13,507
But if people sat down just because they were tired,

1891
01:43:13,508 --> 01:43:16,577
I think that's being irresponsible as teammates.

1892
01:43:16,578 --> 01:43:21,707
I was more concerned about communication than the dance.

1893
01:43:21,708 --> 01:43:26,117
I feel like I've become a burden to my teammates...

1894
01:43:26,118 --> 01:43:27,548
because I couldn't speak Korean.

1895
01:43:27,989 --> 01:43:30,657
I'm a slow learner,

1896
01:43:30,658 --> 01:43:34,087
and I was the only one who couldn't get it.

1897
01:43:34,088 --> 01:43:36,028
I was a bit worried...

1898
01:43:36,029 --> 01:43:37,529
that I would be a hindrance.

1899
01:43:38,158 --> 01:43:39,158
Honestly,

1900
01:43:39,868 --> 01:43:42,199
I don't know if what we're doing is right.

1901
01:43:43,199 --> 01:43:44,668
Our teammates don't look desperate.

1902
01:43:45,199 --> 01:43:49,069
My question is if we need to bring unmotivated people with us.

1903
01:43:49,809 --> 01:43:51,078
This is a survival.

1904
01:43:51,639 --> 01:43:53,979
We don't have the luxury to look out for others.

1905
01:43:54,748 --> 01:43:56,519
I really need to make my debut here.

1906
01:43:56,949 --> 01:43:59,649
I think we all have different standards.

1907
01:44:00,389 --> 01:44:01,988
But the date is a few days away.

1908
01:44:01,989 --> 01:44:04,417
I'm worried the others might feel down...

1909
01:44:04,418 --> 01:44:06,758
if we bring this up.

1910
01:44:07,689 --> 01:44:11,029
I'm not sure how the others might take this.

1911
01:44:11,559 --> 01:44:13,628
I keep asking myself if bringing them with us...

1912
01:44:14,099 --> 01:44:15,998
is the right thing to do.

1913
01:44:17,668 --> 01:44:20,638
JUNSEO will not let them go.

1914
01:44:20,639 --> 01:44:21,739
Right.

1915
01:44:24,139 --> 01:44:28,849
(Will they be able to overcome this obstacle?)

1916
01:44:30,849 --> 01:44:32,479
LYNNLYNN, can we talk now?

1917
01:44:32,979 --> 01:44:35,318
- Can we talk now there? - Okay.

1918
01:44:35,319 --> 01:44:37,418
- Talk a little bit. - Okay.

1919
01:44:38,288 --> 01:44:41,529
(Creating a place to talk)

1920
01:44:42,389 --> 01:44:45,698
During our practice,

1921
01:44:45,699 --> 01:44:49,599
he must be having a hard time due to communication issues.

1922
01:44:49,798 --> 01:44:53,408
There may be things he couldn't say because we couldn't communicate.

1923
01:44:53,609 --> 01:44:58,338
I tried so hard because I didn't do well...

1924
01:44:58,508 --> 01:45:02,778
during the dance class.

1925
01:45:02,779 --> 01:45:06,148
But when I tried to dance again,

1926
01:45:06,149 --> 01:45:08,548
I didn't have the energy left.

1927
01:45:08,649 --> 01:45:11,489
We understand that you're struggling.

1928
01:45:11,918 --> 01:45:14,257
It's admirable to work so hard...

1929
01:45:14,258 --> 01:45:16,457
in a foreign country.

1930
01:45:16,458 --> 01:45:19,028
But if he could gather up more energy,

1931
01:45:19,029 --> 01:45:21,827
I just think we could build better teamwork.

1932
01:45:21,828 --> 01:45:25,898
Can you ask him if he could try just...

1933
01:45:25,899 --> 01:45:27,368
a bit harder?

1934
01:45:28,139 --> 01:45:29,309
Got it.

1935
01:45:29,908 --> 01:45:31,008
- You can do it. - Yes.

1936
01:45:31,679 --> 01:45:35,008
I want to thank not only the leader but also JIAHN...

1937
01:45:35,408 --> 01:45:39,889
for looking out for us.

1938
01:45:40,449 --> 01:45:41,917
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1939
01:45:41,918 --> 01:45:43,518
You're welcome. Don't mention it.

1940
01:45:43,519 --> 01:45:44,658
That's okay!

1941
01:45:46,258 --> 01:45:47,327
Let's do this.

1942
01:45:47,328 --> 01:45:49,158
- Come on! - Let's do this!

1943
01:45:49,458 --> 01:45:51,327
(How will this talk affect them?)

1944
01:45:51,328 --> 01:45:52,399
- Let's do this. - All right.

1945
01:45:53,099 --> 01:45:56,868
(It's super effective.)

1946
01:45:58,199 --> 01:46:00,708
(But there are some side effects.)

1947
01:46:01,439 --> 01:46:02,907
This is how hyper you get at dawn.

1948
01:46:02,908 --> 01:46:04,138
(It's currently 3am.)

1949
01:46:04,139 --> 01:46:06,648
You get this hyper at dawn.

1950
01:46:06,649 --> 01:46:07,779
(The leader is highly satisfied.)

1951
01:46:08,048 --> 01:46:10,077
It brought up the mood first.

1952
01:46:10,078 --> 01:46:12,949
I'm starting to see our teamwork get better.

1953
01:46:13,078 --> 01:46:16,149
The leader and members were great.

1954
01:46:16,689 --> 01:46:19,288
(They used to rest individually during a break.)

1955
01:46:19,588 --> 01:46:21,428
- Did you? - Where?

1956
01:46:21,429 --> 01:46:22,729
(Now they rest together.)

1957
01:46:23,699 --> 01:46:24,699
Hey.

1958
01:46:25,229 --> 01:46:27,268
(LIN WEI CHEN's surprise magic show)

1959
01:46:27,269 --> 01:46:28,468
Gosh, this...

1960
01:46:28,569 --> 01:46:29,797
(Another magic show)

1961
01:46:29,798 --> 01:46:31,038
(Impressed)

1962
01:46:31,468 --> 01:46:32,998
(He sensed he messed up.)

1963
01:46:33,269 --> 01:46:34,468
Sorry.

1964
01:46:36,109 --> 01:46:39,948
I want to try to speak Korean...

1965
01:46:39,949 --> 01:46:41,508
I'll do my best.

1966
01:46:42,779 --> 01:46:44,218
It's okay.

1967
01:46:44,748 --> 01:46:46,377
- "Close." - "Close."

1968
01:46:46,378 --> 01:46:47,519
Close.

1969
01:46:47,849 --> 01:46:49,649
"A lot. Delicious."

1970
01:46:49,889 --> 01:46:51,918
It's very hard.

1971
01:46:52,418 --> 01:46:54,628
"High. Late."

1972
01:46:54,889 --> 01:46:57,158
"Different. Same."

1973
01:46:57,458 --> 01:47:00,328
I don't think it's something that our leader can do alone.

1974
01:47:00,468 --> 01:47:03,268
Everyone else has to help out and do it all together with him.

1975
01:47:03,269 --> 01:47:07,109
We practised as if it were first place or nothing.

1976
01:47:07,309 --> 01:47:09,337
We've practised hard so far,

1977
01:47:09,338 --> 01:47:11,779
and I'm sure we can place first.

1978
01:47:12,139 --> 01:47:14,648
Team "3D" by Jung Kook, please come up to the stage.

1979
01:47:14,649 --> 01:47:18,548
(How will they perform with the newly built teamwork?)

1980
01:47:21,989 --> 01:47:23,319
(JUNSEO)

1981
01:47:24,658 --> 01:47:26,019
(KENSHIN, JUNSEO)

1982

(Jung Kook's "3D" by T. T)

1983
01:47:30,298 --> 01:47:31,728
Gosh, look how popular they are.

1984
01:47:31,729 --> 01:47:33,729
This team has a lot of skilled trainees too.

1985
01:47:33,998 --> 01:47:36,068

(Trainees LYNNLYNN, LIN WEI CHEN, and LEE JUNSEON)

1989
01:47:42,168 --> 01:47:44,337
All right. Please say hello.

1990
01:47:44,338 --> 01:47:45,338
(Trainees CHAE HEEJU, PETCH, and ZHANG JINGLONG)

1991
01:47:45,479 --> 01:47:47,877
Let us introduce ourselves. In 2 and 3.

1992
01:47:47,878 --> 01:47:49,778
Cutie, pretty.

1993
01:47:49,779 --> 01:47:51,979
We're T. T! We hope you like us!

1994
01:47:52,048 --> 01:47:54,118
(PARK JUNSEO)

1995
01:47:54,389 --> 01:47:56,518
I see a lot of non-Korean members in this team.

1996
01:47:56,519 --> 01:47:58,688
Trainee SAKURADA KENSHIN.

1997
01:47:58,689 --> 01:47:59,788
Yes.

1998
01:48:00,328 --> 01:48:02,458
I hear your close friend is a Korean learning book.

1999
01:48:02,828 --> 01:48:05,099
That's right.

2000
01:48:05,298 --> 01:48:09,399
Then, what's the Korean word that you use most often?

2001
01:48:09,968 --> 01:48:11,439
There are four Korean words I often use.

2002
01:48:12,639 --> 01:48:13,769
The first one is...

2003
01:48:14,408 --> 01:48:15,609
spicy.

2004
01:48:16,139 --> 01:48:17,679
Spicy.

2005
01:48:18,578 --> 01:48:19,639
The second one is...

2006
01:48:20,508 --> 01:48:21,809
wait.

2007
01:48:23,109 --> 01:48:24,779
(Flinching)

2008
01:48:25,449 --> 01:48:26,578
The third one is...

2009
01:48:26,949 --> 01:48:28,288
hungry.

2010
01:48:29,149 --> 01:48:30,359
- It's all about eating. - The fourth one is...

2011
01:48:31,359 --> 01:48:32,458
The fourth one is,

2012
01:48:32,859 --> 01:48:34,088
"Honey,"

2013
01:48:37,059 --> 01:48:38,729
- "please..." - "Let's go out?"

2014
01:48:40,168 --> 01:48:41,298
"I love you?"

2015
01:48:42,029 --> 01:48:43,199
"Marry me?"

2016
01:48:43,769 --> 01:48:44,798
"Please..."

2017
01:48:46,168 --> 01:48:48,467
"adore..."

2018
01:48:48,468 --> 01:48:51,139
"Adore us."

2019
01:48:51,208 --> 01:48:53,038
(Please adore us.)

2020
01:48:55,378 --> 01:48:57,978
He charms the audience.

2021
01:48:57,979 --> 01:48:59,278
I wish he were my younger brother.

2022
01:48:59,279 --> 01:49:00,918
He's two years older than JUYOUNG.

(Let's watch their performance now.)

2026
01:49:15,468 --> 01:49:18,069
None of the performances were as sexy as ours so far.

2027
01:49:19,139 --> 01:49:21,168
I'm most excited about their performance.

2028
01:49:29,809 --> 01:49:31,649
- Yes! - Oh, my.

Hey, LYNNLYNN!

2032
01:50:52,429 --> 01:50:53,668
Yes!

2033
01:51:04,609 --> 01:51:05,739
What the... KENSHIN!

2034
01:51:06,309 --> 01:51:07,949
Nice. Great.

2035
01:51:18,989 --> 01:51:21,189
KENSHIN is all grown up.

01:51:41,908 --> 01:51:43,077
How cute.

Goodness.

2048
01:52:30,458 --> 01:52:32,199
Look at their swagger.

(CHAE HEEJU, PETCH, ZHANG JINGLONG)

2056
01:53:12,298 --> 01:53:14,038
They did well without making any mistakes.

2057
01:53:15,069 --> 01:53:17,978
JUNSEO is so good at keeping the team's balance.

2058
01:53:17,979 --> 01:53:19,408
He made all the choreography too.

2059
01:53:19,679 --> 01:53:23,149
I'm impressed that his energy is evident even on screen.

2060
01:53:23,548 --> 01:53:26,019
Gosh. This team is so sexy.

2061
01:53:26,319 --> 01:53:28,088
- That's what it means to be sexy. - Right.

2062
01:53:28,588 --> 01:53:30,588
If I were told to vote for one, I wouldn't be able to do it.

2063
01:53:30,788 --> 01:53:32,688
It must be so hard to choose one.

2064
01:53:32,689 --> 01:53:34,859
(The voting results for every team will be revealed shortly.)

2065
01:53:36,559 --> 01:53:37,658
It's over!

2066
01:53:38,429 --> 01:53:39,798
- It's over. - Okay.

2067
01:53:40,929 --> 01:53:42,127
It was tough.

2068
01:53:42,128 --> 01:53:44,497
If not for the leader and others,

2069
01:53:44,498 --> 01:53:47,109
it would've been much harder for the non-Korean members.

2070
01:53:47,408 --> 01:53:49,309
- I feel great. - You feel great.

2071
01:53:49,609 --> 01:53:51,238
- I feel great. - "I feel great."

2072

Again.

2075
01:53:58,849 --> 01:54:00,048
Check it.

2076
01:54:02,889 --> 01:54:04,388
Dear World Assemblers,

2077
01:54:04,389 --> 01:54:07,388
all the performances for Position Matching are over.

2078
01:54:07,389 --> 01:54:09,788
(Position Matching is over.)

2079
01:54:09,828 --> 01:54:12,599
Now, let's begin the voting...

2080
01:54:13,658 --> 01:54:14,967
for Position Matching.

2081
01:54:14,968 --> 01:54:16,327
(The on-site voting begins.)

2082
01:54:16,328 --> 01:54:20,569
First off, it's the team voting.

2083
01:54:20,708 --> 01:54:23,609
In the vocal, rap, and dance positions,

2084
01:54:23,779 --> 01:54:25,707
press the number of one team...

2085
01:54:25,708 --> 01:54:28,808
which you think best pulled off the song.

2086
01:54:28,809 --> 01:54:30,479
(Abstentions and invalid votes will not be counted.)

2087
01:54:31,078 --> 01:54:33,179
I'm going to vote for the one who sang really well.

2088
01:54:33,449 --> 01:54:35,149
I think this guy is just skilled.

2089
01:54:35,349 --> 01:54:37,787
(The directors' votes will be counted only for the team rankings.)

2090
01:54:37,788 --> 01:54:41,128
Next is the MVP voting.

2091
01:54:41,389 --> 01:54:44,358
Press the number of the trainee...

2092
01:54:44,359 --> 01:54:48,167
who you think best pulled off the song.

2093
01:54:48,168 --> 01:54:50,668
(The MVPs will be decided solely through on-site voting.)

2094
01:54:51,699 --> 01:54:53,498
I'm actually so nervous.

2095
01:54:54,739 --> 01:54:56,269
It's just impossible to imagine.

2096
01:54:56,468 --> 01:54:58,038
I hoped that our team would place first.

2097
01:54:58,309 --> 01:54:59,809
This was all I had in my mind.

2098
01:55:00,239 --> 01:55:02,878
I really wanted to be one of the MVPs.

2099
01:55:03,149 --> 01:55:05,378
It's just too crazy to get the benefit points of 100,000.

2100
01:55:05,418 --> 01:55:07,849
If things go south, I could easily be eliminated.

2101
01:55:08,389 --> 01:55:12,188
I thought it'd greatly affect the rankings.

2102
01:55:12,189 --> 01:55:13,689
(How will the voting results affect the rankings?)

2103
01:55:14,389 --> 01:55:17,628
(The World Assemblers are done with on-site voting.)

2104
01:55:21,269 --> 01:55:23,428
(The trainees are waiting for the final result announcement.)

2105
01:55:23,429 --> 01:55:24,439
I'm so nervous.

2106
01:55:25,998 --> 01:55:27,099
I'm nervous.

2107
01:55:27,368 --> 01:55:29,037
The first-place teams...

2108
01:55:29,038 --> 01:55:30,808
in vocal, rap,

2109
01:55:30,809 --> 01:55:32,939
and dance positions.

2110
01:55:33,479 --> 01:55:36,407
Every trainee in these three top-ranking teams...

2111
01:55:36,408 --> 01:55:38,948
will be given 20,000 points each.

2112
01:55:38,949 --> 01:55:40,849
- That's crazy. - It's a lot.

2113
01:55:41,149 --> 01:55:44,189
And the three MVP trainees...

2114
01:55:45,158 --> 01:55:47,628
- will be given 100,000 points... - Goodness.

2115
01:55:48,588 --> 01:55:50,559
- Gosh, 100,000 points. - in addition.

2116
01:55:50,699 --> 01:55:52,058
That will guarantee them to make the debut.

2117
01:55:52,059 --> 01:55:53,099
I know.

2118
01:55:54,599 --> 01:55:56,168
I'd be lying if I said I didn't want it.

2119
01:55:56,229 --> 01:55:57,968
I thought I wouldn't be eliminated...

2120
01:55:58,599 --> 01:56:00,939
if I obtained those points.

2121
01:56:01,139 --> 01:56:02,809
Let's start with the voting result...

2122
01:56:03,069 --> 01:56:04,609
for the vocal position.

2123
01:56:05,508 --> 01:56:07,908
(Rankings, Team Names)

2124
01:56:08,748 --> 01:56:09,809
Right away?

2125
01:56:10,949 --> 01:56:12,649
The rankings from 1st to 4th will all be revealed?

2126
01:56:13,949 --> 01:56:15,718
The rankings from 1st to 4th will all be revealed?

2127
01:56:16,519 --> 01:56:19,188
First off, I'll announce...

2128
01:56:19,189 --> 01:56:22,359
the 3rd-place and 4th-place teams for the vocal position.

2129
01:56:23,559 --> 01:56:25,128
- Please... - The vocal position.

2130
01:56:25,298 --> 01:56:26,529
Please.

2131
01:56:27,168 --> 01:56:30,568
(Rankings, Team Names)

2132
01:56:30,569 --> 01:56:33,298
("Don't Go" by Bee Boys, "We Must Love" by Assemble Here)

2133
01:56:33,639 --> 01:56:34,938
Good work.

2134
01:56:34,939 --> 01:56:37,508
(Assemble Here is on 4th with a score of 47.)

2135
01:56:38,578 --> 01:56:39,907
(Bee Boys are on 3rd with a score of 132.)

2136
01:56:39,908 --> 01:56:41,778
Regardless of the result,

2137
01:56:41,779 --> 01:56:44,248
you've presented amazing performances.

2138
01:56:44,649 --> 01:56:46,478
Gosh, please.

2139
01:56:46,479 --> 01:56:49,088
Please... Let's hold hands.

2140
01:56:50,718 --> 01:56:53,287
Love Me Five And Juliet and Love...

2141
01:56:53,288 --> 01:56:55,559
are currently the first-place candidates.

2142
01:56:56,158 --> 01:56:58,498
My guess is "Love wins all."

2143
01:56:58,658 --> 01:57:00,698
Let's go, HANBIN. HYUNWOO.

2144
01:57:00,699 --> 01:57:01,929
HANBIN. HYUNWOO.

2145
01:57:01,998 --> 01:57:04,598
Now, the first-place winner of the vocal position.

2146
01:57:04,599 --> 01:57:06,399
(The 1st-place vocal team is to be announced.)

2147
01:57:07,168 --> 01:57:08,639
I expect us to place first for sure.

2148
01:57:08,708 --> 01:57:10,809
I think we'll place first.

2149
01:57:11,139 --> 01:57:13,538
I think I nailed it today.

2150
01:57:13,838 --> 01:57:16,247
- The first-place vocal team is... - Please.

2151
01:57:16,248 --> 01:57:18,078
(Which vocal team will place 1st for Position Matching?)

2152
01:57:18,378 --> 01:57:19,818
It's Team Love.

2153
01:57:19,819 --> 01:57:24,758
(Team Love places 1st with a score of 163.)

2154
01:57:25,218 --> 01:57:26,388
Good job.

2155
01:57:26,389 --> 01:57:27,889
- Congratulations. - YOUNGSEO.

2156
01:57:28,458 --> 01:57:29,888
- Good work. - We did well.

2157
01:57:29,889 --> 01:57:31,028
- Congratulations. - What a shame.

2158
01:57:31,029 --> 01:57:32,429
All members of Team Love, the first-place winner,

2159
01:57:32,899 --> 01:57:34,428
will each be given...

2160
01:57:34,429 --> 01:57:35,827
(Every member of Team Love is given 20,000 benefit points.)

2161
01:57:35,828 --> 01:57:38,439
a total of 20,000 benefit points. Congratulations.

2162
01:57:38,939 --> 01:57:40,609
- Thank you. - Gosh.

2163
01:57:41,208 --> 01:57:42,368
Good work.

2164
01:57:44,109 --> 01:57:46,037
While preparing for the performance,

2165
01:57:46,038 --> 01:57:48,809
the five of us struggled with injuries...

2166
01:57:49,048 --> 01:57:51,679
and argued with each other.

2167
01:57:51,979 --> 01:57:54,288
But I felt like it all paid off.

2168
01:57:54,618 --> 01:57:56,547
I tried my best to congratulate them,

2169
01:57:56,548 --> 01:57:58,559
but I couldn't hide...

2170
01:57:59,019 --> 01:58:01,489
the frustration, to be honest.

2171
01:58:02,989 --> 01:58:06,429
Let's move on to the voting result...

2172
01:58:06,859 --> 01:58:08,168
for the dance position.

2173
01:58:08,868 --> 01:58:09,998
Please.

2174
01:58:10,599 --> 01:58:12,939
This is exciting.

2175
01:58:13,769 --> 01:58:17,167
Let me announce the 3rd and 4th-place teams.

2176
01:58:17,168 --> 01:58:18,338
Please...

2177
01:58:19,338 --> 01:58:20,439
Let's please avoid just this one.

2178
01:58:23,979 --> 01:58:26,417
(Rankings, Team Names)

2179
01:58:26,418 --> 01:58:27,849
- What? - What?

2180
01:58:29,389 --> 01:58:33,158
(WE-KEY places 4th with a score of 46.)

2181
01:58:33,189 --> 01:58:34,228
No.

2182
01:58:34,229 --> 01:58:38,058
(POP SHY places 3rd with a score of 72.)

2183
01:58:38,059 --> 01:58:39,899
Gosh, this is crazy.

2184
01:58:40,158 --> 01:58:41,199
Seriously.

2185
01:58:41,399 --> 01:58:42,728
- It's driving me crazy. - Please.

2186
01:58:42,729 --> 01:58:43,929
- This is crazy. - Please.

2187
01:58:43,968 --> 01:58:46,498
The first-place winner...

2188
01:58:47,199 --> 01:58:48,268
of the dance position...

2189
01:58:48,269 --> 01:58:50,538
- Please... - will be announced now.

2190
01:58:50,679 --> 01:58:52,078
Please.

2191
01:58:52,279 --> 01:58:53,979
Honestly speaking,

2192
01:58:54,708 --> 01:58:56,109
I have confidence that we will place first.

2193
01:58:57,309 --> 01:58:58,448
The strongest team?

2194
01:58:58,449 --> 01:59:00,279
Team "Closer," of course.

2195
01:59:00,889 --> 01:59:03,417
The first-place winner of the dance position is...

2196
01:59:03,418 --> 01:59:06,288
(Which dance team will place first for Position Matching?)

2197
01:59:08,088 --> 01:59:10,657
Congratulations. It's T. T.

2198
01:59:10,658 --> 01:59:12,658
(1st: "3D" by T. T, 2nd: "Closer" by Your Four-leaf Clover)

2199
01:59:13,328 --> 01:59:18,998
(T. T places 1st with a score of 233.)

2200
01:59:20,338 --> 01:59:21,438
Great job.

2201
01:59:21,439 --> 01:59:26,679
(Your Four-leaf Clover places 2nd with a score of 117.)

2202
01:59:27,779 --> 01:59:29,308
- Good job. - Gosh.

2203
01:59:29,309 --> 01:59:30,609
Well done!

2204
01:59:32,378 --> 01:59:33,548
What a bummer.

2205
01:59:33,949 --> 01:59:36,247
Automatically, each member of T. T...

2206
01:59:36,248 --> 01:59:40,018
gets to have 20,000 benefit points.

2207
01:59:40,019 --> 01:59:41,127
Congratulations.

2208
01:59:41,128 --> 01:59:43,229
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2209
01:59:45,128 --> 01:59:47,059
Gosh, this is crazy.

2210
01:59:47,569 --> 01:59:49,729
It's insane. Is this a dream?

2211
01:59:50,029 --> 01:59:51,438
It was a huge shame.

2212
01:59:51,439 --> 01:59:54,108
I almost cried when I was standing there.

2213
01:59:54,109 --> 01:59:55,239
But I held my tears back.

2214
01:59:55,868 --> 01:59:58,438
Let me now announce the voting result...

2215
01:59:58,439 --> 01:59:59,679
of the rap position.

2216
02:00:00,479 --> 02:00:01,849
Gosh, this group really is not easy.

2217
02:00:03,008 --> 02:00:06,319
(The 3rd and 4th-place teams are to be revealed.)

2218
02:00:06,819 --> 02:00:08,489
Team "WORK" or Team" Crayon" might place first.

2219
02:00:09,149 --> 02:00:10,587
(Rankings, Team Names)

2220
02:00:10,588 --> 02:00:12,819
(3rd: "MOMMAE" by Spank, 4th: "SHALALA" by Shalalala Land)

2221
02:00:12,958 --> 02:00:14,358
Good job.

2222
02:00:14,359 --> 02:00:16,588
(Shalalala Land places 4th with a score of 47.)

2223
02:00:17,389 --> 02:00:21,029
(Spank places 3rd with a score of 69.)

2224
02:00:21,668 --> 02:00:25,098
Team Oh Is That So and Workers are...

2225
02:00:25,099 --> 02:00:27,297
the candidates for the 1st and 2nd places.

2226
02:00:27,298 --> 02:00:29,668
Gosh, it's tricky.

2227
02:00:31,439 --> 02:00:34,878
The first-place winner for the rap position.

2228
02:00:35,779 --> 02:00:37,617
I thought Team "WORK" was...

2229
02:00:37,618 --> 02:00:39,418
our only rival.

2230
02:00:39,949 --> 02:00:42,048
I believe my team will place first for sure.

2231
02:00:42,649 --> 02:00:44,318
The first-place winner of the rap position.

2232
02:00:44,319 --> 02:00:46,117
(Which rap team will place first for Position Matching?)

2233
02:00:46,118 --> 02:00:47,288
Congratulations.

2234
02:00:47,788 --> 02:00:49,827
It's Oh Is That So.

2235
02:00:49,828 --> 02:00:52,559
(Oh Is That So places 1st with a score of 192.)

2236
02:00:54,059 --> 02:00:58,867
(Workers places 2nd with a score of 160.)

2237
02:00:58,868 --> 02:01:00,399
- Gosh. - Great job.

2238
02:01:00,668 --> 02:01:02,138
- Well done. - Good job.

2239
02:01:02,139 --> 02:01:04,138
- Good job. - We did it.

2240
02:01:04,139 --> 02:01:05,809
- Gosh. - Well done.

2241
02:01:06,239 --> 02:01:07,547
Each member of the first-place team, Oh Is That So,

2242
02:01:07,548 --> 02:01:10,378
gets to have 20,000 benefit points.

2243
02:01:10,548 --> 02:01:11,779
Congratulations.

2244
02:01:12,479 --> 02:01:13,679
Congratulations.

2245
02:01:14,519 --> 02:01:16,088
Look.

2246
02:01:17,118 --> 02:01:18,319
We placed first.

2247
02:01:18,458 --> 02:01:20,189
(Excited)

2248
02:01:21,128 --> 02:01:23,288
I was worried that my teammates...

2249
02:01:23,929 --> 02:01:26,898
were blaming themselves for failing to place first.

2250
02:01:26,899 --> 02:01:28,868
I felt bad for the team.

2251
02:01:29,399 --> 02:01:33,098
Now, I'll announce the MVPs of each position,

2252
02:01:33,099 --> 02:01:36,309
who will be given 100,000 benefit points.

2253
02:01:37,269 --> 02:01:38,438
For the MVP announcement,

2254
02:01:38,439 --> 02:01:40,878
only down to seventh place will be revealed.

2255
02:01:41,109 --> 02:01:44,717
In short, your rankings will be pushed down.

2256
02:01:44,718 --> 02:01:46,218
What does that mean?

2257
02:01:47,048 --> 02:01:48,318
(Rankings, Names)

2258
02:01:48,319 --> 02:01:50,718
For the MVP announcement,

2259
02:01:51,088 --> 02:01:53,558
each team's individual scores will be revealed one team at a time...

2260
02:01:53,559 --> 02:01:54,858
only to the seventh place.

2261
02:01:54,859 --> 02:01:56,087
(Team 1's Trainee A, Team 2's Trainee E,)

2262
02:01:56,088 --> 02:01:57,997
(Team 2's Trainee G, Team 3's Trainee L)

2263
02:01:57,998 --> 02:02:00,797
If you remain in the first place until the end,

2264
02:02:00,798 --> 02:02:04,127
you'll be given a total of 100,000 benefit points.

2265
02:02:04,128 --> 02:02:05,139
(1st place: Team 1's Trainee A, MVP)

2266
02:02:05,439 --> 02:02:08,038
Let's start with the vocal position.

2267
02:02:08,639 --> 02:02:10,569
Among the trainees of PROJECT 7,

2268
02:02:10,639 --> 02:02:12,479
who will get to place first in the vocal position?

2269
02:02:13,378 --> 02:02:15,608
I'll announce the individual scores...

2270
02:02:15,609 --> 02:02:18,578
of Love Me Five And Juliet first.

2271
02:02:19,019 --> 02:02:21,288
That will be from 1st to 5th within the team...

2272
02:02:21,418 --> 02:02:22,588
since there are 5 of us.

2273
02:02:23,149 --> 02:02:24,218
How cruel.

2274
02:02:24,519 --> 02:02:27,059
I expected it'd be HANBIN.

2275
02:02:27,258 --> 02:02:28,827
Please show us now.

2276
02:02:28,828 --> 02:02:30,458
(The individual scores of Love Me Five And Juliet)

2277
02:02:31,298 --> 02:02:33,399
- Gosh. - Goodness.

2278
02:02:34,158 --> 02:02:36,199
(KIM SIHUN, OH TAEHWAN, LEE HANBIN, KANG HYUNWOO, OH YOUNGWOONG)

2279
02:02:36,699 --> 02:02:38,337
(The current first-place trainee is Trainee KIM SIHUN.)

2280
02:02:38,338 --> 02:02:41,468
SIHUN is currently in first place for the vocal position.

2281
02:02:42,208 --> 02:02:43,968
SIHUN dropped his head.

2282
02:02:44,708 --> 02:02:48,247
I actually focused more on placing first as a team.

2283
02:02:48,248 --> 02:02:49,778
I was rated highly,

2284
02:02:49,779 --> 02:02:51,779
but I wasn't too happy.

2285
02:02:52,019 --> 02:02:53,617
Will he get...

2286
02:02:53,618 --> 02:02:56,248
to keep this first place?

2287
02:02:56,288 --> 02:02:58,457
Let me announce the individual scores...

2288
02:02:58,458 --> 02:03:01,729
of Team Love in the vocal position.

2289
02:03:01,828 --> 02:03:04,228
I thought BINGHUA dominated the others.

2290
02:03:04,229 --> 02:03:06,257
When he was on screen,

2291
02:03:06,258 --> 02:03:07,797
his aura and voice were just crazy.

2292
02:03:07,798 --> 02:03:10,599
YOUNGSEO. He was most memorable for me.

2293
02:03:10,798 --> 02:03:13,098
Only in terms of singing skills,

2294
02:03:13,099 --> 02:03:15,368
the MVP might be WU CHENYU.

2295
02:03:16,269 --> 02:03:17,938
Please show us.

2296
02:03:17,939 --> 02:03:19,378
(The individual scores of Love are to be revealed.)

2297
02:03:19,739 --> 02:03:22,077
(YOO YOUNGSEO, HA SEOKHEE, WU CHENYU, BINGHUA, LEE EUNSUH)

2298
02:03:22,078 --> 02:03:23,179
Gosh, YOUNGSEO.

2299
02:03:25,179 --> 02:03:26,348
(Trainee YOO YOUNGSEO places 1st.)

2300
02:03:26,349 --> 02:03:28,917
Trainee YOO YOUNGSEO of Love...

2301
02:03:28,918 --> 02:03:30,819
is now in first place.

2302
02:03:31,158 --> 02:03:32,559
Congratulations.

2303
02:03:33,618 --> 02:03:34,788
Gosh.

2304
02:03:35,029 --> 02:03:38,258
(YOUNGSEO is currently in 1st place for the vocal position.)

2305
02:03:38,758 --> 02:03:40,497
Moving on to the individual scores...

2306
02:03:40,498 --> 02:03:43,368
of Team Bee Boys.

2307
02:03:44,069 --> 02:03:45,467
I didn't expect much for myself,

2308
02:03:45,468 --> 02:03:47,907
but a lot more for YONGHYUN in my team.

2309
02:03:47,908 --> 02:03:51,678
YONGHYUN pulled off singing high notes perfectly.

2310
02:03:51,679 --> 02:03:53,309
Will the rankings change again?

2311
02:03:54,578 --> 02:03:57,149
(Will he get to stay in 1st place?)

2312
02:03:57,408 --> 02:03:59,377
Please show us now.

2313
02:03:59,378 --> 02:04:01,118
(The individual scores of Bee Boys are to be revealed.)

2314
02:04:02,118 --> 02:04:04,488
(KIM SUNGMIN, KWON YONGHYUN, AHN JUNWON)

2315
02:04:04,489 --> 02:04:05,859
- This is crazy. - Oh, my.

2316
02:04:06,859 --> 02:04:08,559
I thought YONGHYUN would replace him.

2317
02:04:09,889 --> 02:04:12,698
Trainee YOO YOUNGSEO of Love...

2318
02:04:12,699 --> 02:04:15,167
is still in first place.

2319
02:04:15,168 --> 02:04:16,497
(Trainee YOO YOUNGSEO stays in first place.)

2320
02:04:16,498 --> 02:04:18,438
It's time for the individual scores...

2321
02:04:18,439 --> 02:04:21,668
of Assemble Here.

2322
02:04:22,069 --> 02:04:23,467
YOUNGHOON...

2323
02:04:23,468 --> 02:04:25,407
sounded so stable when he sang.

2324
02:04:25,408 --> 02:04:28,808
I hoped my name would be within the top seven.

2325
02:04:28,809 --> 02:04:30,547
My team placed first,

2326
02:04:30,548 --> 02:04:32,948
which meant we got a lot of votes, to begin with.

2327
02:04:32,949 --> 02:04:35,889
I thought I had a chance to be the MVP.

2328
02:04:36,949 --> 02:04:39,257
Please show us now.

2329
02:04:39,258 --> 02:04:40,418
(The individual scores of Assemble Here)

2330
02:04:41,258 --> 02:04:43,288
(YOO YOUNGSEO, KIM SIHUN, KIM SUNGMIN, KWON YONGHYUN)

2331
02:04:45,859 --> 02:04:47,229
Nothing changed?

2332
02:04:47,668 --> 02:04:50,569
Assemble Here's individual scores have been announced,

2333
02:04:50,668 --> 02:04:52,997
but there are no changes in the rankings.

2334
02:04:52,998 --> 02:04:54,868
(There are no changes in the overall rankings.)

2335
02:04:55,508 --> 02:04:57,269
YOUNGSEO is the MVP.

2336
02:04:57,668 --> 02:04:59,407
YOUNGSEO, good job.

2337
02:04:59,408 --> 02:05:01,348
- Don't cry. - The MVP of the vocal position...

2338
02:05:01,349 --> 02:05:02,448
- Congratulations. - Don't cry.

2339
02:05:02,449 --> 02:05:04,717
The final MVP of the vocal position...

2340
02:05:04,718 --> 02:05:08,148
is Trainee YOO YOUNGSEO of Team Love.

2341
02:05:08,149 --> 02:05:10,217
(The final MVP of the vocal position is YOO YOUNGSEO.)

2342
02:05:10,218 --> 02:05:11,957
- Good job! - YOUNGSEO.

2343
02:05:11,958 --> 02:05:13,188
Congratulations.

2344
02:05:13,189 --> 02:05:14,189
- Congratulations. - Congratulations!

2345
02:05:14,190 --> 02:05:15,327
I wish things were better in the end.

2346
02:05:15,328 --> 02:05:16,929
- Great job. - It's a bummer.

2347
02:05:17,529 --> 02:05:20,827
I take this as their expectation...

2348
02:05:20,828 --> 02:05:22,467
to do much better in the future.

2349
02:05:22,468 --> 02:05:24,837
I'll do the best I can...

2350
02:05:24,838 --> 02:05:27,368
to show how much I improve.

2351
02:05:29,208 --> 02:05:30,238
How cool.

2352
02:05:30,239 --> 02:05:31,838
(The final 2nd-place trainee in the vocal position is KIM SIHUN.)

2353
02:05:32,008 --> 02:05:35,747
Trainee YOO YOUNGSEO has obtained 20,000 team benefit points...

2354
02:05:35,748 --> 02:05:39,077
and 100,000 MVP benefit points.

2355
02:05:39,078 --> 02:05:43,718
Thus, he now has a total of 120,000 benefit points.

2356
02:05:44,859 --> 02:05:46,758
- Good for him. - I know.

2357
02:05:47,718 --> 02:05:50,628
Let's move on to the dance position.

2358
02:05:50,658 --> 02:05:54,798
Who will get to become the MVP dancer of PROJECT 7?

2359
02:05:55,529 --> 02:05:58,497
Let me announce the individual scores...

2360
02:05:58,498 --> 02:06:00,868
of Your Four-leaf Clover first.

2361
02:06:01,109 --> 02:06:03,069
- I wonder who will place first. - WANGSEOK?

2362
02:06:03,809 --> 02:06:06,279
I'll be humble and expect to be in second place.

2363
02:06:06,378 --> 02:06:10,408
I thought I deserved to be within the top seven for sure.

2364
02:06:11,048 --> 02:06:14,118
I hope I'll be the MVP.

2365
02:06:15,019 --> 02:06:16,349
Please show us...

2366
02:06:17,319 --> 02:06:18,917
the individual scores now.

2367
02:06:18,918 --> 02:06:20,689
(The individual scores of Your Four-leaf Clover)

2368
02:06:21,059 --> 02:06:22,627
(KANG MINSEO, SEO KYOUNGBAE, OH SEUNGCHAN, ASAKA KOTARO,)

2369
02:06:22,628 --> 02:06:23,628
(KANG WANGSEOK, KIM JIMIN, YANG JUHO)

2370
02:06:23,629 --> 02:06:24,958
- MINSEO? - I knew it.

2371
02:06:25,699 --> 02:06:26,699
(Trainee KANG MINSEO is currently in 1st place.)

2372
02:06:26,700 --> 02:06:30,699
The current MVP dancer is Trainee KANG MINSEO.

2373
02:06:31,498 --> 02:06:35,238
Moving on to the individual scores...

2374
02:06:35,239 --> 02:06:37,368
of T. T in the dance position.

2375
02:06:37,769 --> 02:06:38,938
- YEOJUN. - YEOJUN.

2376
02:06:38,939 --> 02:06:40,837
From the way I saw it, YEOJUN seemed like an idol the most,

2377
02:06:40,838 --> 02:06:43,578
not to mention his perfect dancing skills.

2378
02:06:43,679 --> 02:06:48,417
The word, MVP, itself was enticing.

2379
02:06:48,418 --> 02:06:49,548
I really wanted it.

2380
02:06:49,649 --> 02:06:53,058
KENSHIN was so good, even with his facial expressions.

2381
02:06:53,059 --> 02:06:54,928
I think it's impossible to stop him from becoming the MVP.

2382
02:06:54,929 --> 02:06:58,058
JUNSEO just rocked it,

2383
02:06:58,059 --> 02:07:00,729
so it might be hard for me to place first.

2384
02:07:01,529 --> 02:07:03,098
Please show us the result.

2385
02:07:03,099 --> 02:07:04,939
(The individual scores of T. T are to be revealed.)

2386
02:07:05,699 --> 02:07:08,138
(Rankings, Names)

2387
02:07:08,139 --> 02:07:09,707
(PARK JUNSEO, SAKURADA KENSHIN, JANG YEOJUN, YU JIAHN)

2388
02:07:09,708 --> 02:07:12,038
- JUNSEO. - Goodness. KENSHIN.

2389
02:07:14,439 --> 02:07:17,007
The MVP has changed to be Trainee PARK JUNSEO.

2390
02:07:17,008 --> 02:07:20,648
Trainee SAKURADA KENSHIN...

2391
02:07:20,649 --> 02:07:22,948
is placed second too.

2392
02:07:22,949 --> 02:07:24,047
(SAKURADA KENSHIN is in 2nd place.)

2393
02:07:24,048 --> 02:07:26,218
- Goodness. KENSHIN. - Gosh, KENSHIN.

2394
02:07:28,958 --> 02:07:32,627
Moving on to the individual scores...

2395
02:07:32,628 --> 02:07:34,867
of WE-KEY in the dance position.

2396
02:07:34,868 --> 02:07:39,898
Trainee KIM JOONWOO was most memorable for me.

2397
02:07:39,899 --> 02:07:42,609
He led the performance as if it was a one-man show.

2398
02:07:42,908 --> 02:07:45,478
It's actually not easy for the MVP to be from the bottom team.

2399
02:07:45,479 --> 02:07:47,108
So I put down my expectations.

2400
02:07:47,109 --> 02:07:49,308
Still, I'm having my last bit of hope...

2401
02:07:49,309 --> 02:07:50,849
as JOONWOO performed quite well.

2402
02:07:50,949 --> 02:07:53,248
Please show us...

2403
02:07:53,949 --> 02:07:55,448
the individual scores of WE-KEY now.

2404
02:07:55,449 --> 02:07:57,489
(The individual scores of WE-KEY are to be revealed.)

2405
02:08:01,019 --> 02:08:03,929
(KIM JOONWOO)

2406
02:08:04,059 --> 02:08:07,398
Trainee KIM JOONWOO is the only member of WE-KEY...

2407
02:08:07,399 --> 02:08:09,498
to be within the top seven.

2408
02:08:09,798 --> 02:08:12,438
If Trainee PARK JUNSEO manages to keep his place,

2409
02:08:12,439 --> 02:08:15,238
he'll be given 100,000 benefit points.

2410
02:08:15,239 --> 02:08:18,979
Will he get to secure the 100,000 benefit points?

2411
02:08:19,179 --> 02:08:21,547
Let me announce the individual scores...

2412
02:08:21,548 --> 02:08:24,279
of POP SHY in the dance position.

2413
02:08:25,279 --> 02:08:27,218
MAJINGXIANG might come up.

2414
02:08:28,418 --> 02:08:30,848
The audience cheered so much for MAJINGXIANG,

2415
02:08:30,849 --> 02:08:32,519
and a lot of them were holding banners with his name on them.

2416
02:08:32,658 --> 02:08:35,389
I thought the chances were high enough.

2417
02:08:35,458 --> 02:08:38,797
If anyone asks who's the best dancer of all in PROJECT 7,

2418
02:08:38,798 --> 02:08:41,729
the answer is obviously Trainee PARK JUNSEO.

2419
02:08:42,069 --> 02:08:44,938
(Who will be the MVP in the dance position in the end?)

2420
02:08:44,939 --> 02:08:47,337
Please show us the individual scores...

2421
02:08:47,338 --> 02:08:49,167
of POP SHY now.

2422
02:08:49,168 --> 02:08:50,769
(The individual scores of POP SHY are to be revealed.)

2423
02:08:51,908 --> 02:08:54,207
(MAJINGXIANG)

2424
02:08:54,208 --> 02:08:55,479
The rankings changed.

2425
02:08:57,208 --> 02:09:01,149
(Trainee PARK JUNSEO remains in 1st place.)

2426
02:09:01,449 --> 02:09:02,449
The rankings changed.

2427
02:09:02,450 --> 02:09:05,457
The final MVP in the dance position...

2428
02:09:05,458 --> 02:09:08,587
is Trainee PARK JUNSEO of T. T.

2429
02:09:08,588 --> 02:09:09,658
Congratulations.

2430
02:09:11,298 --> 02:09:13,398
Gosh, MAJINGXIANG is in second place?

2431
02:09:13,399 --> 02:09:14,997
(The final 2nd-place trainee is MAJINGXIANG.)

2432
02:09:14,998 --> 02:09:18,167
I'm delighted to place first as a team...

2433
02:09:18,168 --> 02:09:21,408
and as an individual in the position.

2434
02:09:21,769 --> 02:09:24,608
There were a lot of difficulties throughout the period,

2435
02:09:24,609 --> 02:09:27,877
and I feel like the World Assemblers voted for me...

2436
02:09:27,878 --> 02:09:30,608
to give me credit for my hard work, which makes me even happier.

2437
02:09:30,609 --> 02:09:32,748
I'll devote myself more. Thank you.

2438
02:09:36,118 --> 02:09:39,518
With 20,000 team benefit points...

2439
02:09:39,519 --> 02:09:41,728
and 100,000 individual benefit points,

2440
02:09:41,729 --> 02:09:45,429
Trainee PARK JUNSEO has a total of 120,000 benefit points.

2441
02:09:46,158 --> 02:09:47,958
I'm happy that JUNSEO and YOUNGSEO became the MVPs.

2442
02:09:48,269 --> 02:09:49,298
It's good.

2443
02:09:49,729 --> 02:09:52,399
- Both of their teams placed first. - You...

2444
02:09:53,139 --> 02:09:55,268
Let's move on to the rap position.

2445
02:09:55,269 --> 02:09:56,269
(It's time to announce the MVP in the rap position.)

2446
02:09:56,270 --> 02:09:58,479
Who will be the first-place winner in the rap position?

2447
02:09:59,139 --> 02:10:02,949
I'll announce the individual scores of Spank first.

2448
02:10:03,708 --> 02:10:04,878
It will be SEYUN for sure.

2449
02:10:05,519 --> 02:10:08,889
Trainee JUNG SEYUN of Spank was the only one who caught my eye.

2450
02:10:08,918 --> 02:10:11,217
He rapped with passion,

2451
02:10:11,218 --> 02:10:12,218
and his lyrics were so entertaining.

2452
02:10:12,219 --> 02:10:15,188
YICHEN showed off his sexy side so well too.

2453
02:10:15,189 --> 02:10:16,858
He was very energetic too.

2454
02:10:16,859 --> 02:10:19,728
Please show us the individual scores now.

2455
02:10:19,729 --> 02:10:21,368
(The individual scores of Spank are to be revealed.)

2456
02:10:22,029 --> 02:10:23,029
SEYUN did really well, though.

2457
02:10:23,030 --> 02:10:24,229
(YICHEN, JUNG SEYUN, KIM HYUNJAE, KANG HEEMIN)

2458
02:10:25,038 --> 02:10:26,138
SEYUN did really well, though.

2459
02:10:26,139 --> 02:10:29,007
(The current MVP in the rap position is YICHEN.)

2460
02:10:29,008 --> 02:10:30,638
I wonder if Trainee YICHEN...

2461
02:10:30,639 --> 02:10:33,537
will get to keep his place.

2462
02:10:33,538 --> 02:10:36,178
Moving on to the individual scores...

2463
02:10:36,179 --> 02:10:38,718
of Shalalala Land in the rap position.

2464
02:10:39,048 --> 02:10:42,818
Objectively speaking, I thought it was impossible for me.

2465
02:10:42,819 --> 02:10:45,018
I hoped SEUNGHO would become the MVP...

2466
02:10:45,019 --> 02:10:47,559
since he was the only rapper in our team.

2467
02:10:47,918 --> 02:10:50,229
- SEUNGHO? - SEUNGHO.

2468
02:10:51,128 --> 02:10:52,698
Please show us now.

2469
02:10:52,699 --> 02:10:54,228
(The individual scores of Shalalala Land)

2470
02:10:54,229 --> 02:10:55,728
(YICHEN, JUNG SEYUN, KIM HYUNJAE, KANG HEEMIN)

2471
02:10:55,729 --> 02:10:57,367
(SONG SEUNGHO, SHIN JAEWON, LEE JIHOON, TSUJII RYOMA)

2472
02:10:57,368 --> 02:10:58,398
- SEUNGHO. - What?

2473
02:10:58,399 --> 02:10:59,399
SEUNGHO!

2474
02:11:01,199 --> 02:11:02,907
(Trainee SONG SEUNGHO takes the 1st place.)

2475
02:11:02,908 --> 02:11:04,208
The first-place trainee has been replaced.

2476
02:11:04,439 --> 02:11:06,338
Trainee SONG SEUNGHO...

2477
02:11:06,809 --> 02:11:08,508
has taken the first place.

2478
02:11:09,248 --> 02:11:11,818
Let's move on to the individual scores...

2479
02:11:11,819 --> 02:11:14,377
of Oh Is That So...

2480
02:11:14,378 --> 02:11:15,649
in the rap position.

2481
02:11:16,389 --> 02:11:18,418
The MVP might come from the first-place team.

2482
02:11:19,319 --> 02:11:22,787
TAEYU just dominated the performance.

2483
02:11:22,788 --> 02:11:26,297
His rap was well-delivered.

2484
02:11:26,298 --> 02:11:28,699
He made a strong impression for sure.

2485
02:11:29,429 --> 02:11:32,568
(Will Trainee SONG SEUNGHO get to keep his place?)

2486
02:11:32,569 --> 02:11:35,838
Please show us the individual scores.

2487
02:11:36,508 --> 02:11:38,707
(1st: SONG SEUNGHO, 2nd: YICHEN)

2488
02:11:38,708 --> 02:11:42,149
(KIM TAEYU, YOO HEEDO, LEE GUNWOO, KWON YEUNG)

2489
02:11:43,248 --> 02:11:45,617
(Trainee SONG SEUNGHO remains in 1st place.)

2490
02:11:45,618 --> 02:11:49,449
- SEUNGHO, you might make it. - SEUNGHO is still in first place.

2491
02:11:49,849 --> 02:11:51,087
If he keeps his place,

2492
02:11:51,088 --> 02:11:55,029
he will get to obtain 100,000 benefit points.

2493
02:11:55,658 --> 02:11:58,957
Now, let me announce the individual scores...

2494
02:11:58,958 --> 02:12:01,729
of Workers in the rap position.

2495
02:12:02,998 --> 02:12:04,428
Everyone on this team deserves to be the MVP.

2496
02:12:04,429 --> 02:12:06,098
I agree.

2497
02:12:06,099 --> 02:12:08,568
Trainee JEON MINWOOK. He's so good with his expressions.

2498
02:12:08,569 --> 02:12:09,907
It wouldn't be an exaggeration...

2499
02:12:09,908 --> 02:12:12,507
to call him the textbook example of an idol rapper.

2500
02:12:12,508 --> 02:12:16,108
I loved how Trainee YEOM YECHAN rapped.

2501
02:12:16,109 --> 02:12:19,948
I honestly thought I was better than anyone...

2502
02:12:19,949 --> 02:12:21,787
in the rap position,

2503
02:12:21,788 --> 02:12:23,218
so I expected I'd be within the top three.

2504
02:12:23,288 --> 02:12:25,257
I hoped SEUNGHO would place first for sure...

2505
02:12:25,258 --> 02:12:26,617
so my team could have the MVP...

2506
02:12:26,618 --> 02:12:29,088
even though we couldn't place first as a team.

2507
02:12:29,128 --> 02:12:32,098
Please show us the individual scores...

2508
02:12:32,099 --> 02:12:33,099
of Workers.

2509
02:12:33,958 --> 02:12:35,698
(The individual scores of Workers are to be revealed.)

2510
02:12:35,699 --> 02:12:37,467
Keep your place, SEUNGHO.

2511
02:12:37,468 --> 02:12:38,497
(1st: SONG SEUNGHO, 2nd: YICHEN)

2512
02:12:38,498 --> 02:12:41,908
(JEON MINWOOK, YEOM YECHAN)

2513
02:12:43,968 --> 02:12:45,678
(Trainee JEON MINWOOK places 1st.)

2514
02:12:45,679 --> 02:12:47,877
The final MVP in the rap position...

2515
02:12:47,878 --> 02:12:50,047
is Trainee JEON MINWOOK. Congratulations.

2516
02:12:50,048 --> 02:12:51,578
(The final MVP in the rap position is JEON MINWOOK.)

2517
02:12:52,618 --> 02:12:55,587
(The final 2nd-place trainee is SONG SEUNGHO.)

2518
02:12:55,588 --> 02:12:58,617
As the leader of this team,

2519
02:12:58,618 --> 02:13:02,528
I didn't get us to take the team benefit points,

2520
02:13:02,529 --> 02:13:04,957
and I came to place first alone.

2521
02:13:04,958 --> 02:13:06,628
It feels a little strange.

2522
02:13:10,569 --> 02:13:12,069
Trainee JEON MINWOOK...

2523
02:13:12,668 --> 02:13:15,569
has obtained 100,000 MVP benefit points.

2524
02:13:15,769 --> 02:13:16,769
Congratulations.

2525
02:13:16,769 --> 02:13:17,769
(He's given 100,000 MVP benefit points.)

2526
02:13:18,239 --> 02:13:19,239
(Check out the benefit performances on the PROJECT 7's YouTube channel.)

2527
02:13:19,240 --> 02:13:23,908
(Position Matching is over.)

2528
02:13:24,529 --> 02:13:27,849
(A battle opens in the peaceful dorm.)

2529
02:13:28,519 --> 02:13:31,048
We're going to select the best dancer today.

2530
02:13:31,689 --> 02:13:34,158
(A huge benefit for the winner?)

2531
02:13:34,519 --> 02:13:36,729
(Competing fiercely for the benefit)

2532
02:13:37,628 --> 02:13:39,958
(Highly competitive)

2533
02:13:41,158 --> 02:13:43,699
(The vocal and rap teams are busy competing too.)

2534
02:13:44,328 --> 02:13:47,338
(Sentimental singing performances by the vocal team)

2535
02:13:48,838 --> 02:13:51,508
(Unexpected performances by the rap team)

2536
02:13:51,979 --> 02:13:53,878
(The air is getting heated up.)

2537
02:13:55,008 --> 02:13:56,179
I can't believe I'm watching this for free.

2538
02:13:56,578 --> 02:13:58,779
(Available only on PROJECT 7)

2539
02:13:59,248 --> 02:14:01,248
(The dance battle between RyuD and Bada)

2540
02:14:03,418 --> 02:14:04,648
(How are things hanging?)

2541
02:14:04,649 --> 02:14:07,088
(I joined this to make it big.)

2542
02:14:10,158 --> 02:14:12,498
(But I feel like I want to give up.)

2543
02:14:12,958 --> 02:14:14,798
(It's so hard.)

2544
02:14:15,328 --> 02:14:17,667
Down from 71st place will all be eliminated.

2545
02:14:17,668 --> 02:14:18,668
What was to come has come.

2546
02:14:18,669 --> 02:14:20,569
This is a survival after all.

2547
02:14:21,498 --> 02:14:22,609
I was a little scared.

2548
02:14:23,439 --> 02:14:24,439
(It'll be over for real if I can't pull it off.)

2549
02:14:24,440 --> 02:14:25,707
(What if I can't even make it within the top 70?)

2550
02:14:25,708 --> 02:14:26,808
(It's mentally draining.)

2551
02:14:26,809 --> 02:14:28,108
(I feel like I'm standing on the edge of a cliff.)

2552
02:14:28,109 --> 02:14:29,507
(Everything crumbles in an instant.)

2553
02:14:29,508 --> 02:14:30,577
(I felt most anxious.)

2554
02:14:30,578 --> 02:14:31,747
(I didn't know what to do.)

2555
02:14:31,748 --> 02:14:33,077
(Please...)

2556
02:14:33,078 --> 02:14:35,288
(I wanted to survive.)

2557
02:14:36,288 --> 02:14:38,218
(The result of the first elimination will be revealed next week.)

2558
02:14:40,418 --> 02:14:42,088
