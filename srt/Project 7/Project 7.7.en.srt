1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:01,910
I feel hungry.

2
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:03,292
I'm so hungry.

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:07,060
- What are we going to have? - What's this?

4
00:00:07,199 --> 00:00:08,259
It smells good.

5
00:00:08,499 --> 00:00:10,498
- Did you see what's inside? - Fried chicken, pizza...

6
00:00:10,499 --> 00:00:11,699
(What's in the box?)

7
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,820
- No way those things are in here. - I agree, though.

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,669
It says, "We support PROJECT 7 trainees."

9
00:00:18,939 --> 00:00:20,386
- I want to open it now. - Shall we do it?

10
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,008
This is the lunchbox prepared for us.

11
00:00:23,009 --> 00:00:24,250
I'm so excited.

12
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:25,609
Shall we open this?

13
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:26,950
- Let's open it. - In 1, 2, 3!

14
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,750
- It's stir-fried pork! - There's stir-fried pork.

15
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:32,419
- I have stir-fried pork. - Great.

16
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:33,420
It looks good.

17
00:00:33,421 --> 00:00:35,221
First, there's a lot of meat, so it's a pass.

18
00:00:36,259 --> 00:00:37,960
- A vitamin too. - Vitamin!

19
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,159
This is what we need the most.

20
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:43,999
- Eating nuts is very important. - Of course.

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,320
You need to eat seven nuts a day.

22
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,946
The quality of the side dishes looks good even at a glance.

23
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:49,899
- It looks good. - Vegetables in rolled omelet.

24
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,460
It's a pass. There are six side dishes.

25
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,469
- Shall we eat it now? - Shall we?

26
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,510
- Thank you for the food! - Thank you for the food!

27
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,808
- This is seriously good. - The rice is good.

28
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,749
Is this actually sold at a convenience store?

29
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,780
- This tastes good. - Thank you for the food!

30
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,050
It has so many side dishes.

31
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,790
The amount is so generous.

32
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:10,659
Meat and sausage. It's a pass.

33
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:11,759
It's good.

34
00:01:12,889 --> 00:01:14,960
Goodness, it looks like us. I can't eat this.

35
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:16,660
I know. It breaks my heart.

36
00:01:17,499 --> 00:01:19,129
- It has seven sections. - This one too?

37
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,899
It has exactly seven sections.

38
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,240
Is this in a formation?

39
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,109
As I see, this one is the center.

40
00:01:25,309 --> 00:01:28,179
- Right. This is the main one. - The meat is the center.

41
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,416
(Only a popular side dish can take the center section.)

42
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,979
Everyone, lift the egg. There's ham under the egg.

43
00:01:32,949 --> 00:01:34,150
I guess it's Shadow Zone.

44
00:01:38,089 --> 00:01:39,609
Is pork cutlet the most delicious one?

45
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,460
- Right. - I see.

46
00:01:41,589 --> 00:01:43,460
Pork cutlet takes first place.

47
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:48,429
- Pork cutlet is in first place. - Pork cutlet is JEON MINWOOK.

48
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,910
- It's in first place. - First place.

49
00:01:51,369 --> 00:01:52,698
May I have the old-fashioned sausage?

50
00:01:52,699 --> 00:01:54,570
(First place: pork cutlet)

51
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,169
ATILLA, which is the number one for you?

52
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,039
- Pork cutlet. - This one, JEON MINWOOK. Okay.

53
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,138
- JEON MINWOOK. - JEON MINWOOK.

54
00:02:02,139 --> 00:02:03,850
- SAKURADA KENSHIN. - Really?

55
00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:06,449
- This is in second place. - Really?

56
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,179
- I've enjoyed the food. - I'm done.

57
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,450
I'm finished.

58
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,788
I'll have the desert.

59
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:12,849
There's almond.

60
00:02:13,789 --> 00:02:15,359
I need vitamins to dance.

61
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,919
You don't need to swallow a pill.

62
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,990
That's what I'm saying.

63
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:22,200
I feel tired, especially today.

64
00:02:23,529 --> 00:02:24,930
It's an orange-flavored jelly!

65
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,399
I can't resist this.

66
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,400
(Eating)

67
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:29,069
I'm filled with energy.

68
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:31,938
- Give him a big hand. - He surely is good.

69
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:33,039
He's a professional.

70
00:02:33,339 --> 00:02:36,378
If you feel energetic, practice singing hard later.

71
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:38,210
Yes. Right.

72
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:40,009
- Pluck up. - Brace your energies.

73
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,150
- All right. - Eat the jelly first.

74
00:02:42,619 --> 00:02:44,049
Eat the jelly and let it go.

75
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,990
(Work hard on practicing.)

76
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:48,260
Assemble and upgrade.

77
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,990
Welcome to PROJECT 7, where a new world-class boy group will be born.

78

84

(they have fierce competition.)

106
00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:16,209
Since there's Team Black, our rival,

107
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:17,950
we only thought of winning.

108
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:21,820

I felt so thankful to those who voted for us.

But to be honest, as the other team's members close to me...

156

were not ranked high...

157
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,699
I couldn't feel safe even with the benefit,

158

The one ranked last in the opposite team...

I just felt sorry.

176
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,910
(AHN JUNWON is in 6th place of Team "Make A Wish.")

177
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,210
(CHOI JUYOUNG: 5 votes, ANDY: 43 votes)

178
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,809
They're tied for fifth.

179
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:34,810
(PETCH and CHOI JUYOUNG are in 5th place of Team "TOUCH.")

180
00:07:34,811 --> 00:07:38,478
I thought that I could have been...

181
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,020
ranked higher than I was,

182
00:07:41,549 --> 00:07:44,989
but I tried to think as positive as I could.

183
00:07:46,089 --> 00:07:48,820
(HOU GUANYI: 7 votes, LYNNLYNN: 66 votes)

184
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:52,089
(HOU GUANYI and LYNNLYNN are in 4th place.)

185
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:55,099
(Each team's high ranks are left to be announced.)

186
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:56,260
I felt nervous.

187
00:07:56,659 --> 00:08:00,029
To be honest, I wanted to get in the first place.

188
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:03,440
(KWON YANGWOO: 12 votes, YICHEN: 71 votes)

189
00:08:03,469 --> 00:08:06,339
YICHEN and I are next to each other all the time.

190
00:08:06,909 --> 00:08:08,439
I got in third place, again.

191
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,680
(YICHEN is in 3rd place of Team "Make A Wish" that won.)

192
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,908
When would I be able to take the first place?

193
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,126
(He took 3rd place in Title Song, Position, and Rival Matchings.)

194
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,019
(The one ranked 1st in losing team will lose less votes.)

195
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,489
(The one ranked 1st in winning team will take more votes.)

196
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,259
(KIM TAEYU: 14 votes, NAM JIWOON: 81 votes)

197
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,588
I didn't expect that I'd be ranked higher than ANDY.

198
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:25,905
(NAM JIWOON is in 2nd place of Team "Make A Wish" that won.)

199
00:08:25,929 --> 00:08:28,199
I'd be gone foot if I were in your team.

200
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,598
I got the same number of votes as SOTA.

201
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,799
(Both the 2nd place and the 7th place earned 14 votes.)

202
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,740
(How many votes did Trainee YOO YOUNGSEO, the 1st place get?)

203
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,110
YOUNGSEO, as expected.

204
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,178
(OH TAEHWAN: 15 votes, YOO YOUNGSEO: 157 votes)

205
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:44,448
- Your efforts were rewarded. - YOUNGSEO.

206
00:08:44,449 --> 00:08:46,178
You got as many votes as you went through.

207
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:47,179
(YOO YOUNGSEO is in 1st place of Team "Make A Wish" that won.)

208
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,778
I feel that now I'm showing the outcome...

209
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,649
of the efforts I've put into so far.

210
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,390
I sort of feel rewarded.

211
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,520
Goodness, TAEHWAN.

212
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,289
- You did a good job. - Well done.

213
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:00,799
I don't know.

214
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,799
Since there were other members ranked low,

215
00:09:04,329 --> 00:09:06,529
I couldn't express my joy.

216
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,600
I couldn't just be happy.

217
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,709
It was a battle to take the other one's votes.

218
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:15,278
Even if I won,

219
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,850
I didn't want to take DEUNHAESOL's votes, I thought.

220
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:22,449
But that was the result, so I felt bad.

221
00:09:22,549 --> 00:09:26,390
At first, I only thought of winning.

222
00:09:26,689 --> 00:09:29,090
But PETCH really worked hard.

223
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,689
I could see how desperate he was from his eyes.

224
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:35,230
Also, they were the members I didn't pick.

225
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:38,829
I felt bad and sorry.

226
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,069
I feel this is too brutal.

227
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:43,798
JUNWON really took my votes, after all.

228
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,770
I'm sorry.

229
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,110
I didn't intend it.

230
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,078
If my team won and I was in the first place,

231
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:55,049
I could get 70,000 points.

232
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,620
It feels that I cannot but lose precious votes.

233
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:01,919
I felt so...

234
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:03,890
upset, to be honest.

235
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,828
YOUNGSEO, you really went through a lot.

236
00:10:06,829 --> 00:10:07,928
- You worked hard. - Everyone worked hard.

237
00:10:07,929 --> 00:10:10,459
We gave such a great performance all thanks to you.

238
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,110
Why are you crying?

239
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,909
- Why? - Are you okay?

240
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,209
- It's okay. - Don't cry.

241
00:10:26,309 --> 00:10:28,480
You did a good job.

242
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:31,090
- PETCH, you did a good job. - It's all right.

243
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,620
I wasn't in the safe rank in the first place,

244
00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:39,689
and then I didn't get the benefit and even lost my score.

245
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,600
It's all right.

246
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,370
Thank you.

247
00:10:45,329 --> 00:10:47,699
- Don't cry. - PETCH, you're so cool.

248
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:49,140
You're so cool.

249
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,400
- It's all right. - We...

250
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:54,139
used the same practice room with them.

251
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,979
So I know so well how hard they practiced.

252
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:01,179
(They supported each other, going beyond the competition.)

253
00:11:01,319 --> 00:11:03,579
I felt so sorry...

254
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,449
about taking that team's score.

255
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:11,189
(Meanwhile, the heat of the crowd...)

256
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:15,929
(fills the Rival Matching site.)

257
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:18,829
There are so many people out there.

258
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:21,039
I began to feel nervous. My goodness.

259
00:11:22,569 --> 00:11:25,010
Here are the teams to compete next.

260
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,938
They achieved a million seller one week after their debut...

261
00:11:27,939 --> 00:11:29,908
and created the boom for easy-listening music.

262
00:11:29,909 --> 00:11:32,025
They're an idol band representing the fifth generation.

263
00:11:32,049 --> 00:11:33,980
(The 5th-generation idol?)

264
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,449
They're RIIZE.

265
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,490
(YOO YOUNGSEO)

266
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,760
RIIZE.

267
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,520
I'm excited.

268
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:47,090
These are the RIIZE songs they'll perform.

269
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:49,658
A song filled with a vibe of nostalgia...

270
00:11:49,659 --> 00:11:52,770
and fresh feelings, "Memories."

271
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:57,609
And an attractive song with heart-pounding bass sounds...

272
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:01,510
and restrained sexy charms, "Boom Boom Bass."

273
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,249
Performing "Memories" and "Boom Boom Bass,"

274
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,379
two rival teams will have a match.

275
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,250
Please come up on the stage.

276
00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:11,589
(Team White, "Boom Boom Bass")

277
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,826
(KWON YONGHYUN, let's get married.)

278
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,819
(Team Black, "Memories")

279
00:12:25,699 --> 00:12:27,499
(I'm so excited to see the "Boom Boom Bass" performance.)

280
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,140
I'm also waiting to see "Boom Boom Bass."

281
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,630
I'm most curious about this match.

282
00:12:30,669 --> 00:12:31,808
In 1, 2, 3!

283
00:12:31,809 --> 00:12:33,340
Give me that beat!

284
00:12:33,409 --> 00:12:36,140
- Hello, we're Best Memories. - Hello, we're Best Memories.

285
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,349
- We're Best Memories. - We're Best Memories.

286
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,220
KIM HYUNJAE, let's go for "Memories!"

287
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,679
Let us introduce ourselves.

288
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:44,119
We got that

289
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,489
- Boom Ba doom boom boom, baby - Boom Ba doom boom boom, baby

290
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,895
- Boom Ba doom boom boom, baby - Boom Ba doom boom boom, baby

291
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:50,289
- Baby - Baby

292
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,960
- Hello, we're Boom Boom Baby. - Hello, we're Boom Boom Baby.

293
00:12:55,459 --> 00:12:57,669
They're cute.

294
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,769
Let's listen to each team's determination.

295
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,970
Trainee KIM DOHUN of Team "Memories."

296
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,839
I heard that the average age...

297
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,539
of Team White was higher than that of Team Black, us.

298
00:13:08,939 --> 00:13:10,609
JIAHN and YONGHYUN,

299
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:13,350
we prepared a song for you.

300
00:13:14,049 --> 00:13:15,249
In 1, 2, 3.

301
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,289
Dad, cheer up

302
00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:22,458
- This is too intense. - Goodness.

303
00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:23,490
It's a killer move.

304
00:13:25,689 --> 00:13:28,559
- I'm a mom, then. - We have Ryan Sewon Jhun here.

305
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:30,699
Then I'm a grandfather?

306
00:13:33,299 --> 00:13:36,140
Best Memories, are you keeping your memories well on a note?

307
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:40,140
We'll tear off that note.

308
00:13:40,169 --> 00:13:41,439
(Tearing off)

309
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:43,678
(Throwing away)

310
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:44,679
Gosh.

311
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,610
"We'll tear off." That's so scary.

312
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:50,778
The leader of Team "Boom Boom Bass," Trainee KWON YONGHYUN.

313
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:51,889
Yes.

314
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:54,990
I heard that your team members kept shedding tears during the practice.

315
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,220
What happened?

316
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:59,929
First, most of the members are ranked in the middle,

317
00:14:00,189 --> 00:14:01,949
so they're on the verge of being eliminated.

318
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:04,328
So, we prepared for this mission...

319
00:14:04,329 --> 00:14:07,269
putting our desperate hearts into it.

320
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,670
(How did Team "Boom Boom Bass" prepare for the performance?)

321
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,408
(The practice room of Team RIIZE, A1)

322
00:14:11,409 --> 00:14:12,539
From the beginning.

323
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,480
Rise at this part.

324
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:17,639
Let's arrange the foot move here.

325
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,979
(Trainee YU JIAHN leads the practice.)

326
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,010
This.

327
00:14:20,449 --> 00:14:22,918
After this, make three foot moves, everyone.

328
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:26,419
From here, go 1, 2, 3, and finish.

329
00:14:27,319 --> 00:14:28,390
KOTARO, are you okay?

330
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,458
- Are you okay? - Yes, I'm fine.

331
00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:31,459
Let's do it.

332
00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:34,159
Let's go.

333
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:40,328
The atmosphere wasn't all good.

334
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:42,640
I feel we're missing something.

335
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:47,610
It could have been different if I were in 35th place.

336
00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:50,640
But after being ranked 36th,

337
00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:54,880
I thought I could be eliminated after the next mission.

338
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,350
I need to take a good part and do a good job,

339
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:01,559
and I'm so worried.

340
00:15:04,189 --> 00:15:06,490
(Interim evaluation)

341
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,510
(Trainee SONG HYUNGSEOK makes a mistake in lyrics.)

342
00:15:21,909 --> 00:15:24,039
(Trainee YU JIAHN also makes a mistake in lyrics.)

343
00:15:37,419 --> 00:15:40,090
HYUNGSEOK, are you a rapper?

344
00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:43,529
- Yes. - But you haven't practiced any.

345
00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:45,449
You weren't prepared at all.

346
00:15:45,699 --> 00:15:48,299
It looks like you're performing something you don't want to.

347
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,099
The level of detail is so low.

348
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,409
You're totally off the beat in some parts.

349
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:54,509
What I emphasize all the time...

350
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:57,380
is the 1st verse and the center of the 1st chorus.

351
00:15:57,409 --> 00:15:59,308
- JIAHN does both parts. - Yes.

352
00:15:59,309 --> 00:16:01,349
You have such nice parts now.

353
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:03,048
As I see, other members...

354
00:16:03,049 --> 00:16:06,120
- surely would desire the parts. - Yes.

355
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,089
You need to show your charm,

356
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:10,159
but I can't see any.

357
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,759
I felt frustrated.

358
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,528
Even though I'm the center,

359
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:17,529
I couldn't show it.

360
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:19,568
That made me so frustrated.

361
00:16:19,569 --> 00:16:21,240
How can I solve this problem?

362
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:24,470
Now, let me explain the benefit...

363
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,309
the winning team will take.

364
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,939
This time,

365
00:16:29,409 --> 00:16:32,610
it's taking away benefit points.

366
00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:34,620
Are they going to deduct our points?

367
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:38,650
It doesn't simply end with losing the match.

368
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:42,090
Your global voting score will be deducted.

369
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,589
If I don't show my presence here,

370
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:46,558
I won't be able to take a chance even if it approaches.

371
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:50,029
Even if we win, I might not be able to catch the chance.

372
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:54,900
There's competition among team members too...

373
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,769
about the benefits and all.

374
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:59,740
YONGHYUN is in my team,

375
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:02,980
and he's ranked higher than me.

376
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:06,110
I can't predict the rankings from this match.

377
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:14,219
KOTARO said he had something to talk about. Let's listen.

378
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:16,919
Well,

379
00:17:18,159 --> 00:17:20,530
if JIAHN is fine with it,

380
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,530
I'd like to challenge...

381
00:17:23,659 --> 00:17:24,698
for the center position.

382
00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:26,330
I'd like to challenge...

383
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,540
for the center...

384
00:17:29,199 --> 00:17:31,100
position.

385
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,870
I'd like to challenge for that.

386
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:36,708
I'd like to challenge for that.

387
00:17:36,709 --> 00:17:39,050
(YU JIAHN ranked 35th in the 1st Passing Ceremony.)

388
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,810
Honestly, I was bewildered.

389
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:45,389
Everyone had the equal chance,

390
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:48,259
and we came up with the result by voting.

391
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:51,158
I wondered if it was right to do so now.

392
00:17:51,159 --> 00:17:52,258
(Trainee KOTARO suddenly wants to rechallenge for the center.)

393
00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:55,228
I need to rise in the ranks...

394
00:17:55,229 --> 00:17:56,658
in my team.

395
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:58,729
Now, in this team,

396
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,728
I didn't take many parts.

397
00:18:00,729 --> 00:18:04,439
I feel like I'm a back dancer.

398
00:18:04,769 --> 00:18:05,810
It feels so...

399
00:18:10,739 --> 00:18:13,179
I thought a lot...

400
00:18:13,749 --> 00:18:16,350
about the possibility of getting eliminated...

401
00:18:17,019 --> 00:18:18,689
after this mission.

402
00:18:20,689 --> 00:18:24,689
What matters the most is what JIAHN, the current center, thinks.

403
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:28,129
Personally, as one of the members,

404
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:30,560
I think JIAHN would be very upset.

405
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,469
To be honest,

406
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:37,870
I didn't feel good.

407
00:18:38,269 --> 00:18:41,880
I made the overall structure of the "Boom Boom Bass" performance,

408
00:18:42,479 --> 00:18:44,609
taught them the choreography,

409
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,909
and proceeded with the practice.

410
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,049
As if you were sliding.

411
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:50,719
What on earth is going on now?

412
00:18:51,489 --> 00:18:52,749
I was really surprised.

413
00:18:53,419 --> 00:18:54,620
First of all,

414
00:18:55,989 --> 00:18:58,030
I consider...

415
00:18:58,459 --> 00:19:01,259
PROJECT 7 my last attempt.

416
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,530
As a sincere participant,

417
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:07,370
I want to keep my position.

418
00:19:07,469 --> 00:19:09,570
That's how I honestly feel.

419
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:12,739
But if I say, "I'll just do my part,"

420
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:17,008
I think you'll feel regretful,

421
00:19:17,009 --> 00:19:19,679
even during the performance.

422
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,579
I think that'll make it harder for you to give a good performance.

423
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,849
Whether it's me or KOTARO,

424
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:28,360
if we go with the better option,

425
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,560
I'm okay with that.

426
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:33,959
Let's do that.

427
00:19:34,489 --> 00:19:35,498
I'm okay.

428
00:19:35,499 --> 00:19:36,599
(Trainee YU JIAHN accepted KOTARO's challenge to be center.)

429
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,699
Thank you.

430
00:19:39,769 --> 00:19:44,239
(They will decide the center part based on the dance break.)

431
00:19:45,239 --> 00:19:47,669
(35th place, YU JIAHN, 36th place, ASAKA KOTARO)

432
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:02,219
When I saw someone dancing in my spot,

433
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:07,830
it made me want to keep my spot even more.

434
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:10,800
It was so tough.

435
00:20:13,699 --> 00:20:14,968
Did you decide?

436
00:20:14,969 --> 00:20:16,238
(Nodding)

437
00:20:16,239 --> 00:20:17,300
This is hard.

438
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:19,610
This is so hard.

439
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:27,649
First of all, I'm sure this decision...

440
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:30,150
was hard for all members.

441
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:33,519
I'll be honest.

442
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,489
To be honest,

443
00:20:37,189 --> 00:20:39,428
I knew JIAHN was good,

444
00:20:39,429 --> 00:20:41,900
but I was surprised at how good KOTARO was.

445
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:44,429
But I was surprised at how good KOTARO was.

446
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:45,869
His lines were very nice.

447
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,870
Maybe it's because you do ballet, but your lines were very pretty.

448
00:20:54,739 --> 00:20:57,209
If JIAHN is the center,

449
00:20:57,739 --> 00:20:59,579
we can't showcase KOTARO's abilities.

450
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,550
I thought that would be a waste.

451
00:21:05,419 --> 00:21:08,050
(Trainee KWON YONGHYUN gives 1 vote to ASAKA KOTARO.)

452
00:21:08,189 --> 00:21:10,320
I vote for KOTARO.

453
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:12,330
Thank you.

454
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:19,600
My thoughts got complicated.

455
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:23,140
I felt so nervous...

456
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:24,840
that my ears became red.

457
00:21:26,269 --> 00:21:27,469
I was...

458
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:32,850
also very surprised at how good KOTARO was.

459
00:21:33,009 --> 00:21:34,780
Is that already two votes for him?

460
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:39,219
But I think the person who fits the mood...

461
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,219
of the song best should be the center.

462
00:21:43,189 --> 00:21:44,389
So I vote for JIAHN.

463
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:46,129
(Trainee CHAE HEEJU gives 1 vote to YU JIAHN.)

464
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,959
I give one vote to JIAHN.

465
00:21:49,259 --> 00:21:52,268
I was surprised at how good KOTARO was.

466
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,969
When I looked at the overall picture,

467
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:57,040
I thought JIAHN being in the center...

468
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,870
fit the mood of the song better.

469
00:22:00,009 --> 00:22:04,080
It felt like we discovered a new side of KOTARO.

470
00:22:04,509 --> 00:22:09,550
It is true that we saw strengths we didn't see before.

471
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,519
(Who will be the center Team "Boom Boom Bass?")

472
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:17,458
In the end, we decided...

473
00:22:17,459 --> 00:22:19,458
that JIAHN would be the center.

474
00:22:19,459 --> 00:22:24,100
I do feel very sad and disappointed.

475
00:22:24,459 --> 00:22:26,268
But JIAHN is very good,

476
00:22:26,269 --> 00:22:29,870
and he does fit the song well. So I also thought...

477
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:33,110
that JIAHN should be the center.

478
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,908
I feel that being the center...

479
00:22:35,909 --> 00:22:38,310
is a lot of pressure.

480
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,880
I really felt that this time.

481
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:46,689
I'll have to work very hard.

482
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:56,258
(The only way to endure the weight of being the center...)

483
00:22:56,259 --> 00:22:58,968
(is to practice.)

484
00:22:58,969 --> 00:23:03,840
Now what we have to do is get Team Black's benefit.

485
00:23:04,169 --> 00:23:07,310
We have to win so that my team members...

486
00:23:07,739 --> 00:23:10,439
aren't put at risk because of the benefit.

00:27:26,999 --> 00:27:29,539
- You wrapped it up well, JIAHN. - Really?

530
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,299
I had so much fun at the end.

531
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,008
- You really did wrap it up. - I really did...

532
00:27:33,009 --> 00:27:34,340
wrap it up.

533
00:27:34,469 --> 00:27:36,280
I think we all felt the same.

534
00:27:36,939 --> 00:27:39,749
We gave a good performance. We have no regrets.

535
00:27:40,009 --> 00:27:41,279
- Let's do a cheer. Let's go. - Let's go.

536
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,949
I felt happy. It was exhilarating.

537
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:46,389
- Boom Boom Baby, let's go! - Boom Boom Baby, let's go!

538
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:48,819
- Good work! - Good work!

539
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,019
(Boom Boom Baby, let's go!)

540
00:27:52,459 --> 00:27:55,800
(After the performance by Team "Boom Boom Bass")

541
00:27:56,259 --> 00:27:58,130
- They're good. - They did a good job.

542
00:28:06,209 --> 00:28:07,570
- Let's go. - Okay.

543
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,809
Let's go!

544
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:11,880
Let's go!

545
00:28:12,979 --> 00:28:15,079
These members didn't have a choice in being on this team.

546
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,150
Right.

547
00:28:17,949 --> 00:28:19,050
I'm curious.

548
00:28:20,189 --> 00:28:23,120
(The interim evaluation begins.)

549
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,570
(They suddenly stop dancing.)

550
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,939
What happened?

551
00:28:41,239 --> 00:28:43,909
(Team "Memories" hasn't finished learning the choreography.)

552
00:28:44,239 --> 00:28:46,086
Have you not finished learning the choreography?

553
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:48,230
I thought that was part of the choreography just now.

554
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,559
- Thank you. - Thank you.

555
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,935
(They finish the performance they prepared.)

556
00:28:58,959 --> 00:29:01,728
Why were you only able to learn...

557
00:29:01,729 --> 00:29:05,499
the choreography up to the bridge?

558
00:29:05,929 --> 00:29:08,600
We didn't finish learning up to the third verse,

559
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,099
and we had many messy parts in the second verse.

560
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,810
And we hadn't practiced performing live much either.

561
00:29:13,969 --> 00:29:16,080
Team White...

562
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,979
prepared everything and showed us everything.

563
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:23,019
This evaluation is to see what you've prepared...

564
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,448
and give you feedback,

565
00:29:25,449 --> 00:29:27,619
but we don't even know the choreography of the last part,

566
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,780
and we don't know what kind of performance it will be.

567
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,129
I felt bad...

568
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:35,299
because I talked a lot about our part distribution.

569
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,059
Could I possibly have...

570
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:40,030
another chance to try again?

571
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:42,069
Are we doing this mission together?

572
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:45,669
Or am I just a backup for the chorus?

573
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:50,238
To be completely honest,

574
00:29:50,239 --> 00:29:53,709
I feel like, "I don't want to do this."

575
00:29:54,009 --> 00:29:57,019
That delayed our practice.

576
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,479
I thought...

577
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,688
the members could be uncomfortable with me...

578
00:30:01,689 --> 00:30:03,919
because of that.

579
00:30:06,729 --> 00:30:09,029
We're finally starting the third verse.

580
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,175
(Training room of Team "Memories")

581
00:30:10,199 --> 00:30:11,728
Let's bring up our energy.

582
00:30:11,729 --> 00:30:14,300
- Bring it up. - Yes!

583
00:30:14,769 --> 00:30:17,400
- It's okay. - Yes. I'm a queen.

584
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:21,169
If I brought down the mood of the team

585
00:30:21,239 --> 00:30:23,478
and caused practice to be delayed,

586
00:30:23,479 --> 00:30:24,908
and if the members felt that,

587
00:30:24,909 --> 00:30:27,850
I thought I should do something to help with practice.

588
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:29,820
- One. - Like this?

589
00:30:30,019 --> 00:30:32,820
(Team "Memories" started intensely practicing.)

590
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,590
One, two.

591
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:40,259
- This looks neater. - Okay.

592
00:30:40,459 --> 00:30:41,560
That's how it looks to me.

593
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:43,228
How does the original choreography go?

594
00:30:43,229 --> 00:30:44,959
We decided to do it exactly like that.

595
00:30:44,999 --> 00:30:47,229
- A kick. - Originally, they do a kick.

596
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,698
- Then we can kick... - But when we kick,

597
00:30:49,699 --> 00:30:51,400
you guys lose balance.

598
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:54,039
We could practice, and if we still can't do it,

599
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,269
we could just give up.

600
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,179
Okay.

601
00:31:01,979 --> 00:31:03,120
I think...

602
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:06,549
it'll be better to all do this.

603
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:07,650
Let's do that.

604
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,659
Let's do that.

605
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:12,889
Okay. Let's go with this.

606
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:15,059
I think this will look neater.

607
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,100
Let's go with this.

608
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,498
Since we had the interim evaluation coming up...

609
00:31:18,499 --> 00:31:20,229
and we were in a rush,

610
00:31:20,269 --> 00:31:23,100
I understand why they had to do that.

611
00:31:23,469 --> 00:31:26,208
- Shout it out - Shout it out

612
00:31:26,209 --> 00:31:28,610
We had to do this, then move.

613
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,679
Apparently so.

614
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:35,249
Let's practice looking this way at the number.

615
00:31:39,449 --> 00:31:40,650
Do we do it in place?

616
00:31:41,219 --> 00:31:42,759
Don't we start right away?

617
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,289
Out of our team, I'm closest to GUNWOO...

618
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:48,459
because we were in P3 together.

619
00:31:48,999 --> 00:31:52,299
And even after the P3 performance, we became the closest.

620
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,630
I'm serious.

621
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,899
If someone would ask me,

622
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,238
"Who are you closest to out of the 100 trainees?"

623
00:31:58,239 --> 00:32:00,268
He would be in my top five.

624
00:32:00,269 --> 00:32:03,140
That's how close I am to GUNWOO.

625
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,948
Five, six...

626
00:32:05,949 --> 00:32:07,550
He's not usually like that.

627
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,880
He kept looking upset.

628
00:32:10,419 --> 00:32:11,519
Moonwalk.

629
00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:16,689
- I can't do it. - Okay.

630
00:32:17,689 --> 00:32:19,258
If he has a problem with me,

631
00:32:19,259 --> 00:32:21,759
I wish he would tell me.

632
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:24,958
I was worried about creating another uncomfortable situation...

633
00:32:24,959 --> 00:32:27,669
by bringing this up.

634
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,099
I kept telling myself, "It'll be okay,"

635
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,640
and tried to ignore it.

636
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:34,569
(Trainee HA SEOKHEE is unsure what to do.)

637
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:35,739
Our arms up like this?

638
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:41,179
This is a personal concern.

639
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:43,049
I don't know why,

640
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:44,810
but I haven't talked to GUNWOO for two days.

641
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,789
I really don't know the reason.

642
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,248
I don't know if GUNWOO is being careful with me,

643
00:32:48,249 --> 00:32:50,060
or if I'm being careful with him.

644
00:32:51,259 --> 00:32:53,259
Why do you feel that way?

645
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,060
(At the same time in trainee LEE GUNWOO's room)

646
00:32:56,061 --> 00:32:57,560
It's not for a particular reason.

647
00:32:59,229 --> 00:33:01,999
I was the closest to SEOKHEE here.

648
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:03,140
I see.

649
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:07,169
I think we've grown apart because we're on the same team.

650
00:33:07,409 --> 00:33:08,840
- You feel that way? - Yes.

651
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,140
I'm sure SEOKHEE is feeling this too.

652
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:17,820
(The two trainees grow more concerned.)

653
00:33:20,019 --> 00:33:23,590
(Team "Memories" is in the middle of practice.)

654
00:33:24,219 --> 00:33:26,790
Hit.

655
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:29,159
- Nice. - Okay.

656
00:33:29,729 --> 00:33:30,999
That was pretty good.

657
00:33:31,699 --> 00:33:33,299
- It looks great from the center. - The formation isn't right.

658
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,099
- What? - The formation isn't right.

659
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,876
Right, but I think this was the best we've done with the choreography.

660
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,369
But we need to be expressive.

661
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:42,439
- You're right. - We need to be more expressive.

662
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,110
I'm tired.

663
00:33:44,179 --> 00:33:45,179
(Glancing over)

664
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:56,790
(Glancing over)

665
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,090
GUNWOO.

666
00:34:02,659 --> 00:34:03,659
GUNWOO.

667
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:07,600
(SEOKHEE asks to talk to GUNWOO.)

668
00:34:11,169 --> 00:34:12,438
Are you upset about something?

669
00:34:12,439 --> 00:34:13,809
- Me? No. - Yes.

670
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,168
- Are you sure? - Yes.

671
00:34:15,169 --> 00:34:16,180
I'm really fine.

672
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:19,079
You're saying you're fine, but you don't look fine at all.

673
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,208
To be honest, it's worrying me a lot.

674
00:34:22,209 --> 00:34:24,169
You know we haven't talked for three days, right?

675
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,820
What's going on?

676
00:34:26,919 --> 00:34:29,590
I'm really fine.

677
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:34,058
Other than the day we got on the same team...

678
00:34:34,059 --> 00:34:36,030
and chose the leader,

679
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:40,070
we suddenly stopped talking...

680
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,098
and pretended not to see each other.

681
00:34:42,099 --> 00:34:44,699
And to be honest, I still don't know why.

682
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,709
I'm sure you don't know why I did that either.

683
00:34:47,269 --> 00:34:49,538
That's why...

684
00:34:49,539 --> 00:34:51,610
I'm so upset.

685
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,578
Why is he...

686
00:34:54,579 --> 00:34:56,019
So I even thought,

687
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:58,380
"Was it a bad thing that we got on the same team?"

688
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,848
I thought the same.

689
00:34:59,849 --> 00:35:01,248
I thought,

690
00:35:01,249 --> 00:35:04,888
"Are we growing apart because we got on the same team?"

691
00:35:04,889 --> 00:35:06,630
And I thought...

692
00:35:06,829 --> 00:35:09,160
the problem might be me.

693
00:35:10,059 --> 00:35:13,369
If I am the problem, I want you to tell me.

694
00:35:13,499 --> 00:35:14,530
I see.

695
00:35:17,139 --> 00:35:18,269
So...

696
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,539
Why are you crying?

697
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:23,840
What?

698
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,880
I'm sorry.

699
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:29,519
Oh, gosh.

700
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,660
I'm a mess.

701
00:35:39,689 --> 00:35:40,729
A tissue.

702
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,400
This is nothing to cry about.

703
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,669
You're right.

704
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:51,939
I've changed a bit after I came here.

705
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:53,610
Seriously.

706
00:35:54,769 --> 00:35:55,809
First,

707
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,280
when you first failed to become the main vocalist,

708
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:01,050
you seemed so upset.

709
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:04,680
Thank you. Let's go with this then.

710
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:09,990
(GUNWOO was worried about SEOKHEE.)

711
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:12,429
And you became the sub-vocalist,

712
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:15,490
and it was very apparent that the part was small.

713
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,760
So I thought...

714
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,729
about whether I could console you.

715
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:23,939
But I got a pretty good part.

716
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:26,840
So I didn't feel...

717
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:29,308
like I was in the position to console you.

718
00:36:29,309 --> 00:36:30,910
I didn't know what to do.

719
00:36:31,139 --> 00:36:32,680
I didn't know how to do so.

720
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:35,779
It was really fast. Like this.

721
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,418
(GUNWOO could only stand back and watch.)

722
00:36:37,419 --> 00:36:39,220
The beat was very fast here.

723
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,860
I haven't seen SEOKHEE look happy...

724
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:48,129
being on our team except for the first day.

725
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:49,260
I see.

726
00:36:50,059 --> 00:36:51,900
I feel bad about that.

727
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,099
Why do you feel bad?

728
00:36:55,169 --> 00:36:56,539
We're a team.

729
00:36:57,939 --> 00:37:00,840
We should've taken better care of each other.

730
00:37:01,809 --> 00:37:04,039
We were in different rooms, but you never came by.

731
00:37:04,439 --> 00:37:06,910
You might not know, but I went to your door a lot.

732
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:15,650
(He lingered around SEOKHEE's room all night.)

733
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:21,188
If someone had said something,

734
00:37:21,189 --> 00:37:23,359
it would've been resolved already.

735
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,998
But we couldn't because we were both being careful.

736
00:37:25,999 --> 00:37:28,430
It's so funny.

737
00:37:28,729 --> 00:37:31,169
I felt this after making up with SEOKHEE.

738
00:37:31,869 --> 00:37:35,070
Our team's mood naturally became brighter.

739
00:37:35,139 --> 00:37:37,779
The World Assemblers will decide on this.

740
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,910
Of course.

741
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,780
Oh the whole universe

742
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:42,578
- We finally resolved things. - My playlist that will make

743
00:37:42,579 --> 00:37:43,719
everyone happy

744
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,820
I'll prepare a good performance with SEOKHEE and Team Best Memories.

745
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:50,919
We will make sure we beat Team White.

746
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:53,030
Let's go.

747
00:37:53,459 --> 00:37:54,660
I love you, SEOKHEE.

748
00:38:04,669 --> 00:38:05,970
I love "Memories."

749
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,538
I love this song. I always listen to this.

750
00:38:08,539 --> 00:38:10,110
Seriously, always

751
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:14,380
("Memories" by Best Memories)

752
00:38:18,249 --> 00:38:19,749
How cute.

753
00:38:19,789 --> 00:38:21,019
It suits him.

754
00:38:31,459 --> 00:38:33,669
- Yes! - GUNWOO, SEOKHEE!

755
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:41,269
- HYUNJAE! - KIM HYUNJAE!

756
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:43,039
HYUNJAE is on this team?

757
00:38:48,709 --> 00:38:50,919
What? You're so good, HYUNJAE.

758
00:38:59,389 --> 00:39:00,459
I love it.

759
00:39:11,139 --> 00:39:12,970
- Hey, they're so good! - I love it.

760
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,050
DOHUN's vocalization is so stable.

761
00:39:37,499 --> 00:39:39,930
- Hey, his singing is great. - He's killing it

762
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:46,869
So cute!

763
00:40:05,959 --> 00:40:07,590
My gosh, what's happening?

764
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:28,749
GUNWOO's rap sounds so clear.

765
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,439
- Gosh, one more time! - Goodness, that's beautiful.

766
00:41:02,349 --> 00:41:03,949
My gosh, I'm getting goosebumps from head to toe.

767
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:06,519
This is such a touching performance.

(Check out the full performance on the PROJECT 7's YouTube channel.)

777
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:37,179
Their performance put me in a good mood.

778
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,650
They brought me joy just now.

779
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,848
- Why am I so touched by this? - This is so good.

780
00:41:40,849 --> 00:41:42,388
- My heart feels warm and fuzzy. - Right?

781
00:41:42,389 --> 00:41:43,719
- It's like a year-end performance. - Toward the end...

782
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,889
Why are you crying?

783
00:41:45,459 --> 00:41:47,829
- My gosh. - Oh, my. No.

784
00:41:47,959 --> 00:41:49,660
Their performance made me emotional.

785
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:52,030
- They definitely gave that vibe. - Yes.

First of all, it's GUNWOO's birthday today.

791
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:04,478
His birthday fell on the day of our performance.

792
00:42:04,479 --> 00:42:07,550
We couldn't celebrate his birthday in a grand way or anything.

793
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:08,910
- GUNWOO. - Yes?

794
00:42:08,911 --> 00:42:10,550
- Happy birthday. - Happy birthday.

795
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,950
Right.

796
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,889
It's his birthday today.

797
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,359
- I hope his birthday present... - The benefit.

798
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,089
- He should get the benefit. - Let's get it. He deserves it.

799
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:20,688
- You'll get the present soon. - Okay.

Thank you.

806
00:42:30,999 --> 00:42:32,475
- Right. That was so cool. - I'm not sure about this match.

807
00:42:32,499 --> 00:42:34,245
- They were both great. - It's up to their preferences.

808
00:42:34,269 --> 00:42:36,578
No. Team "Boom Boom Bass" will be more popular.

809
00:42:36,579 --> 00:42:38,316
- That's true. - They're a lot more popular.

810
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:39,909
You know what I think?

811
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:42,079
Team "Boom Boom Bass" was better in terms of skills.

812
00:42:42,579 --> 00:42:44,899
But wasn't the performance of Team "Memories" more moving?

813
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:45,979
Good luck!

814
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,550
- So... - If you have to choose one?

815
00:42:48,349 --> 00:42:50,829

- Yes. - My gosh.

817
00:42:52,889 --> 00:42:53,889
They'll reveal it right away.

818
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:55,059
- Just like that? - My gosh.

819
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:57,029
- My gosh. Oh, no. - I'm so nervous!

820
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:58,130
This is so cruel.

831
00:43:29,829 --> 00:43:34,169
worried me that it might affect the accumulated votes for the team.

00:45:39,889 --> 00:45:40,889
(KWON YONGHYUN takes 70,000 points BAEK JIHO and KIM DOHUN.)

883
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:42,810
But I was quite sorry about taking their points.

884
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:46,930
It was a cruel moment for us to enjoy the victory.

885
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,429
I had to take someone else's points.

886
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:50,745
(CHAE HEEJU takes 50,000 points from AYALON ADAM.)

887
00:45:50,769 --> 00:45:53,340
I had never won anything on a competition show.

888
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:55,910
I could understand how it would feel to lose points.

889
00:45:55,939 --> 00:45:57,639
So I couldn't be just happy.

890
00:45:58,039 --> 00:46:00,279
The score difference between me and HYUNGSEOK is 40,000.

891
00:46:00,849 --> 00:46:03,680
I'll try my best not to feel disappointed that day.

892
00:46:03,979 --> 00:46:07,090
I should brace myself not to cry.

893
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:11,018
I strongly believed that the universe would be on our side.

894
00:46:11,019 --> 00:46:12,090
So it's a pity.

895
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:15,289
(The RIIZE match is over.)

896
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,999
Here are the teams who will compete next.

897
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,429
This group sings about the story of the youth...

898
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:22,200
with the keyword, the boy's coming of age.

899
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:24,539
It's TOMORROW X TOGETHER.

900
00:46:25,269 --> 00:46:27,169
(KWON YONGHYUN)

901
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:29,729
I'm looking forward to this match.

902
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,439
- TOMORROW X TOGETHER. - Good luck.

903
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:37,050
You can feel their unique sense of sorrow and overwhelming energy...

904
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,379
with this song, "Deja Vu."

905
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:40,189
(Let's Get Assembled with "Deja Vu")

906
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:42,489
Their groovy and dreamy melody was joined...

907
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:45,719
by the lyrics, asking to meet tomorrow.

908
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,589
"I'll See You There Tomorrow."

909
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:49,289
(Assemble Us, We'll Wait)

910
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:51,760
These two rival teams prepared to perform before you.

911
00:46:51,829 --> 00:46:53,430
Let's invite them to the stage.

912
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:59,769
(Team White, "I'll See You There Tomorrow")

913
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:02,840
(Team Black, "Deja Vu")

914
00:47:07,709 --> 00:47:10,179
Let us say hello. Two, three.

915
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:12,518
Hello. Let's make a debut...

916
00:47:12,519 --> 00:47:14,320
- with "Deja Vu!" - With "Deja Vu!"

917
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:19,389
Assemble us, we'll wait!

918
00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:21,989
Hello, we're Team Assemble Us, We'll Wait.

919
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:23,959
(EUNSUH)

920
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,558
We'll do it for you.

921
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:26,629
(Chuckling)

922
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:27,970
They're so straightforward.

923
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:30,638
Actually, it's a match between a title track versus a B-side track.

924
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:32,769
- Right. - They're from the same album.

925
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:35,739
- You're right. - They're like twin songs.

926
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:36,909
(A5 will compete with the songs from the same album.)

927
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:39,010
I would like to provoke them.

928
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,809
This message is for Team Black.

929
00:47:41,979 --> 00:47:43,699
- We'll make their faces turn ashen. - Yes.

930
00:47:47,249 --> 00:47:48,749
We'll make their faces turn ashen.

931
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:53,130
That's a hip-hop attitude.

932
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:55,329
Team "I'll See You There Tomorrow."

933
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:58,729
I don't know what you'll see tomorrow.

934
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:03,138
You can win tomorrow.

935
00:48:03,139 --> 00:48:05,400
We'll win today.

936
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,309
He crushed it.

937
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:16,078
He killed it.

938
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:18,519
(The tension between them is intense. How will they perform?)

939
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:19,789
Let's start.

940
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:22,219
Five, six, seven, eight.

941
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:24,959
There can be only one person, someone like you

942
00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:26,659
(KIM JIMIN: 64th place, OK CHANGHYEON: 42nd place)

943
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:27,958
We tamed each other

944
00:48:27,959 --> 00:48:29,729
As for the trainees in low rankings,

945
00:48:30,099 --> 00:48:32,160
every vote counts.

946
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:34,899
In my opinion, we must get the benefit...

947
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:38,800
to increase our chance of advancing to the next phase.

948
00:48:38,869 --> 00:48:41,340
So I was more desperate to win the benefit.

949
00:48:42,639 --> 00:48:44,939
(During the interim evaluation)

950
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:50,979
We did an awful job at the interim evaluation.

951
00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:56,248
(You guys can just go home.)

952
00:48:56,249 --> 00:48:58,319
You guys barely made the cut.

953
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,529
(During the interim evaluation, they received negative feedback.)

954
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:01,730
I wanted to take their points.

955
00:49:02,289 --> 00:49:05,328
I think World Assemblers...

956
00:49:05,329 --> 00:49:08,268
will keep thinking about the trainees...

957
00:49:08,269 --> 00:49:10,299
in high rankings throughout the show.

958
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:12,700
But despite that,

959
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:15,708
somehow finding a way to win them over...

960
00:49:15,709 --> 00:49:18,180
is what I need to do.

961
00:49:18,579 --> 00:49:20,579
The only thing I could think about was winning.

962
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:25,078
(Stepping to the side)

963
00:49:25,079 --> 00:49:26,179
You don't have to step to the side.

964
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:27,248
- Just move to the front. - Just move?

965
00:49:27,249 --> 00:49:29,150
- I'll step back to avoid you. - Okay.

966
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:31,889
Let's try this part again. From "You said."

967
00:49:33,059 --> 00:49:35,090
(They try the same part again.)

968
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:37,660
(Hesitant)

969
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:39,360
- Just move to the front. - Okay.

970
00:49:43,269 --> 00:49:45,015
(He still steps to the side when moving up.)

971
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:47,469
(Trying again)

972
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:49,309
(He steps to the side again.)

973
00:49:49,439 --> 00:49:51,808
Don't step to the side and come back in.

974
00:49:51,809 --> 00:49:53,249
How many times must I tell you?

975
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:54,709
I'm sorry.

976
00:49:56,650 --> 00:49:59,889
(Trainee KANG JIMIN is struggling to fix his movement.)

977
00:50:00,689 --> 00:50:01,849
(Bumping)

978
00:50:07,229 --> 00:50:12,099
(OH YOUNGWOONG can't keep up with the choreography.)

979
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:15,570
The tempo was quite difficult.

980
00:50:15,869 --> 00:50:17,638
When do we squat down? On "you?" Or on "and?"

981
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:19,400
- On "you." - We just went over that.

982
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:22,209
Is there a movement with the chest?

983
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:24,079
I just said there was.

984
00:50:24,539 --> 00:50:26,749
Are you in a different world? Why can't you focus?

985
00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:29,809
They got the same thing wrong over and over again.

986
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:36,219
You have to be the first one.

987
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:38,618
- You must be the first one. - Right. I have to do this.

988
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:40,828
Wait. After this move, I have to go right away.

989
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:42,360
- Yes. - Okay.

990
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,400
- You keep coming here. - I see.

991
00:50:46,570 --> 00:50:47,869
- I'm sorry. - What?

992
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,169
I got too close when I moved back.

993
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:52,700
"Why do something that he has to apologize for?"

994
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:55,240
We need to focus.

995
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:01,410
(But their moves aren't still in sync.)

996
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:04,379
Let's try again.

997
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:06,419
Why do you keep messing up the parts we went over?

998
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:09,510
I don't get how you can mess up the parts we're going over.

999
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:12,189
We need to practice.

1000
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,530
(Sighing)

1001
00:51:15,459 --> 00:51:17,539
We should take a break after we finish our practice.

1002
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,469
It made me wonder if all of us were trying our best.

1003
00:51:23,470 --> 00:51:25,970
I started to question that.

1004
00:51:26,669 --> 00:51:28,409
We were given the same amount of time.

1005
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:31,538
Would we be able to say confidently we put on the best performance...

1006
00:51:31,539 --> 00:51:32,638
we could possibly give?

1007
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:33,809
Would we not be embarrassed?

1008
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:36,820
(Staring)

1009
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:41,519
The three of them seem out of it.

1010
00:51:42,389 --> 00:51:43,990
They're totally losing it.

1011
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:47,558
To be honest, I thought...

1012
00:51:47,559 --> 00:51:49,688
we would easily win the benefit.

1013
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:51,530
That's why I chose them.

1014
00:51:52,459 --> 00:51:55,529
But it made me wonder if I should have brought...

1015
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:58,700
KANG WANGSEOK who is leading his group's choreography.

1016
00:51:58,939 --> 00:52:02,410
I think I regret my decision.

1017
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:05,610
(Team Black is practicing as a group.)

1018
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:08,849
(But Team White is practicing individually.)

1019
00:52:09,249 --> 00:52:12,519
To be honest, I was envious of them.

1020
00:52:13,249 --> 00:52:15,649
I wanted to work with people who were working hard.

1021
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:16,919
Honestly,

1022
00:52:17,419 --> 00:52:19,360
having talented people on the team...

1023
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,959
isn't everything.

1024
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:23,430
It was embarrassing.

1025
00:52:23,999 --> 00:52:25,599
And I was envious of them too.

1026
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:27,900
I wanted to practice as diligently as they did.

1027
00:52:30,599 --> 00:52:31,970
Well,

1028
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:36,169
if we go with this kind of atmosphere,

1029
00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:39,709
we're wasting the strength of this song.

1030
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:41,409
- Right. I agree. - Ultimately,

1031
00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:45,419
we need to have a cheerful vibe even when we're practicing.

1032
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:47,490
So we do a good job on stage too.

1033
00:52:47,849 --> 00:52:50,389
I think everyone is walking on eggshells.

1034
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:52,189
That's not helping the mood.

1035
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,729
If people were unhappy...

1036
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:56,590
or felt negative about something,

1037
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,459
I thought they should share it with the team.

1038
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:01,199
Since we were a team,

1039
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,130
I wanted to listen to their honest opinions.

1040
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,899
I thought about going around the room...

1041
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:07,610
and talk about our feelings.

1042
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:09,839
To be honest,

1043
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:13,380
when I tried to figure out why our mood suddenly got sour,

1044
00:53:13,579 --> 00:53:14,680
I thought that...

1045
00:53:14,849 --> 00:53:17,849
JOONWOO was telling us what we needed to hear.

1046
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:21,650
Although his feedback was valid, it was the way he dealt with it.

1047
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:23,918
For example, let's think about the things...

1048
00:53:23,919 --> 00:53:26,490
he said to JIMIN, his gesture, and gaze.

1049
00:53:26,789 --> 00:53:30,729
In my opinion, the way he behaved made JIMIN walk on eggshells.

1050
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,728
But JIMIN wasn't the only one who had to walk on eggshells.

1051
00:53:33,729 --> 00:53:36,499
But the rest of us could feel how the mood had changed.

1052
00:53:36,970 --> 00:53:38,900
Because of the atmosphere,

1053
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:42,439
contrary to the mood of the song, we started to feel down.

1054
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:46,410
Even when we were practicing, it didn't feel like we were a team.

1055
00:53:52,550 --> 00:53:54,549
I should have focused more.

1056
00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:56,689
And I couldn't understand the choreography.

1057
00:53:56,889 --> 00:54:00,229
So I'm sorry that I kept messing up the choreography.

1058
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:01,889
But I would like it...

1059
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:05,329
if you could tone down the way you speak to me.

1060
00:54:05,459 --> 00:54:09,869
Then maybe, I might have tried to work harder.

1061
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:12,269
To be honest,

1062
00:54:12,599 --> 00:54:13,808
when JOONWOO spoke to me,

1063
00:54:13,809 --> 00:54:17,479
I was taken aback. I wondered, "Why is he talking to me like this?"

1064
00:54:18,479 --> 00:54:20,880
Everyone is upset.

1065
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:23,010
So I didn't feel comfortable asking for help.

1066
00:54:28,389 --> 00:54:29,550
What about you, JOONWOO?

1067
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:33,118
There's nothing for me to say.

1068
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:35,058
You already turned me into this bad guy.

1069
00:54:35,059 --> 00:54:36,959
I don't know what you want me to say.

1070
00:54:37,459 --> 00:54:39,399
You already turned me into this bad guy.

1071
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,300
I don't know what you want me to say.

1072
00:54:42,329 --> 00:54:46,340
I didn't think that I had to be nice when I was sharing my feedback.

1073
00:54:53,309 --> 00:54:54,348
Then...

1074
00:54:54,349 --> 00:54:56,309
(The conversation ended without any improvement.)

1075
00:54:57,349 --> 00:54:59,220
(At the dorm that night)

1076
00:55:02,789 --> 00:55:05,059
(Trainee CHO HYOJIN is looking for someone.)

1077
00:55:07,130 --> 00:55:08,889
- Did you get scolded? - No.

1078
00:55:11,499 --> 00:55:12,559
JOONWOO.

1079
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:13,969
Can we talk?

1080
00:55:13,970 --> 00:55:15,499
Sure. Give me a second.

1081
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:18,339
If this offended him,

1082
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:19,938
I thought apologizing to him and telling him...

1083
00:55:19,939 --> 00:55:21,899
it wasn't my intention was the right thing to do.

1084
00:55:22,669 --> 00:55:24,380
I wanted to talk to you...

1085
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:26,978
because I wanted to apologize to you.

1086
00:55:26,979 --> 00:55:28,659
- But I didn't get a chance. - You said...

1087
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:32,479
I didn't initiate the conversation to turn you into a bad guy.

1088
00:55:34,119 --> 00:55:36,419
Had I put it in a better way,

1089
00:55:37,559 --> 00:55:39,789
it wouldn't have come across like that.

1090
00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:43,659
After the practice session,

1091
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:46,130
I was able to empty my mind.

1092
00:55:47,229 --> 00:55:51,099
So I could start to evaluate the situation more rationally...

1093
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:53,470
rather than emotionally.

1094
00:55:55,139 --> 00:55:56,880
I realized that...

1095
00:55:57,410 --> 00:55:59,208
I had ruined the atmosphere...

1096
00:55:59,209 --> 00:56:00,979
some time later.

1097
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:04,320
Of course, I wanted to apologize.

1098
00:56:05,349 --> 00:56:06,819
A part of me was concerned that...

1099
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:08,926
you might think I took it out on you when I was in a bad mood,

1100
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:10,819
and now that I was feeling better, I was apologizing.

1101
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:13,859
I was afraid it might come across like that.

1102
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:17,260
So I thought that it wasn't right of me to talk to you right away.

1103
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:19,998
I want us to practice more energetically.

1104
00:56:19,999 --> 00:56:21,999
Whatever happened in the training room,

1105
00:56:22,169 --> 00:56:25,539
we can leave it there.

1106
00:56:27,209 --> 00:56:29,169
We kept practicing again and again.

1107
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:31,610
- Let's do this. - Let's go.

1108
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:35,179
We'll give each other feedback. And when we execute it precisely...

1109
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:37,248
with the World Assemblers as our audience...

1110
00:56:37,249 --> 00:56:39,579
on top of the adrenaline rush we'll get from it,

1111
00:56:39,919 --> 00:56:42,389
I believe we'll put on a great performance.

1112
00:56:42,490 --> 00:56:44,219
The benefit for this team is really important.

1113
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:45,220
- This is their last chance. - Right.

1114
00:56:45,221 --> 00:56:47,228
Their rankings are low.

1115
00:56:47,229 --> 00:56:48,360
Right.

1116
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:50,359
They were neck and neck.

1117
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:51,958
I want JOONWOO to smile.

1118
00:56:51,959 --> 00:56:53,399
- Please. - Please.

1119
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:54,969
- I hope they perform well on stage. - If they smile...

1120
00:56:54,970 --> 00:56:55,970
- Right. Don't be nervous. - Do a good job.

1121
00:56:55,971 --> 00:56:57,039
They have a shot then.

1122
00:56:57,369 --> 00:56:59,099
As for the benefit,

1123
00:56:59,939 --> 00:57:01,709
I'll treat it as my last chance...

1124
00:57:02,209 --> 00:57:05,039
and make sure to win it.

1125
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:10,650
("I'll See You There Tomorrow" by Assemble Us, We'll Wait)

1126
00:57:14,619 --> 00:57:15,919
He's handsome.

1127
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:30,400
So cute.

1128
00:57:42,979 --> 00:57:44,150
Let's go.

1129
00:57:52,889 --> 00:57:55,259

1130

1133
00:58:16,479 --> 00:58:17,820
They're so youthful.

1134
00:58:20,349 --> 00:58:21,490
Let's go.

1135
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:31,300
- Hey! - My gosh.

1136
00:58:32,829 --> 00:58:33,829
It's JIMIN.

1137
00:58:34,769 --> 00:58:36,229
(That's so cool.)

1138
00:58:36,269 --> 00:58:37,598
JIMIN is the coolest when he dances.

1139
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:39,369
- Totally. Yes. - He looks so happy.

1140

Well done!

Great job!

1152

- Look at this. - I got goosebumps.

1153

- Why are they so good? - What was with JIMIN?

1154

What was with KIM JIMIN?

1155
01:00:25,309 --> 01:00:29,079
I'm always learning a lot from them.

1156
01:00:29,110 --> 01:00:30,519
I'm always thankful for that.

1157
01:00:31,019 --> 01:00:32,879
We performed well, just like we practiced.

1158
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,419
So I'm really thankful.

1159
01:00:34,650 --> 01:00:37,919
I want to say they did a great job.

1160
01:00:38,490 --> 01:00:40,659
I'm very thankful because...

1161
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:42,459
they always told me that I could do it.

1162
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:45,599
I hope I can survive and see them again.

1163
01:00:46,099 --> 01:00:47,130
Good luck, everyone.

1164
01:00:50,369 --> 01:00:53,969
We'll watch the stage of the opposing team, Team "Deja Vu."

(Opposing team, Team "Deja Vu")

1166
01:01:03,209 --> 01:01:05,019
- Let's go! - Good luck!

1167
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:08,759
I'm looking forward to "Deja Vu" as well.

1168
01:01:08,990 --> 01:01:10,248
I'm curious.

1169
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:12,019
- CHENYU sings really well. - Right.

1170
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:14,130
Is WANGSEOK the center?

1171
01:01:14,389 --> 01:01:15,929
I think WANGSEOK is the center.

1172
01:01:15,930 --> 01:01:18,998
- He is? It's dancer versus dancer. - Dance battle.

1173
01:01:18,999 --> 01:01:20,279
(It's a battle between dancers.)

1174
01:01:23,099 --> 01:01:25,438
I thought it would be a lie...

1175
01:01:25,439 --> 01:01:27,439
to say there was a more desperate team than ours.

1176
01:01:28,209 --> 01:01:30,639
"Would we be able to be on stage like this and win?"

1177
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:33,039
I feel very burdened.

1178
01:01:35,950 --> 01:01:38,418
The most realistic way...

1179
01:01:38,419 --> 01:01:39,526
(Training room of A5, Team "Deja Vu" )

1180
01:01:39,550 --> 01:01:41,918
to go up is to win.

1181
01:01:41,919 --> 01:01:44,090
That's right. We have to win.

1182
01:01:44,389 --> 01:01:47,260
I think the balance of the team is good, just like before.

1183
01:01:47,930 --> 01:01:48,930
That's right.

1184
01:01:49,829 --> 01:01:51,728
- There's a good mood. - Right.

1185
01:01:51,729 --> 01:01:52,729
Just there.

1186
01:01:54,229 --> 01:01:56,030
- He's never danced before. - Right.

1187
01:01:57,099 --> 01:02:00,868
(Trainee JUNG SEUNGWON received severe criticisms.)

1188
01:02:00,869 --> 01:02:03,410
(Why are you half-singing the lyrics?)

1189
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:06,479
(Didn't you practice?)

1190
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:09,420
If there's something we don't know, we could ask CHENYU for vocals.

1191
01:02:09,950 --> 01:02:11,479
He could teach us how to dance.

1192
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:14,449
Let's actively ask each other if there are things we don't know.

1193
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:16,788
- We'll help you well from now on. - Right.

1194
01:02:16,789 --> 01:02:18,160
So don't worry.

1195
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:23,189
Let's continue this good spirit...

1196
01:02:23,729 --> 01:02:24,930
and get the benefit.

1197
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:26,699
- Right. - We're at the lowest position.

1198
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:29,299
- But we could turn the tables. - Right.

1199
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:31,199
Let's show them what we've got. Let's go.

1200
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,200
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1201
01:02:32,201 --> 01:02:33,899
(Team "Deja Vu" gets motivated.)

1202
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:35,438
Then, this.

1203
01:02:35,439 --> 01:02:36,969

1204
01:02:36,970 --> 01:02:38,979

1205
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:42,649
We'll first practice with SEUNGWON...

1206
01:02:42,650 --> 01:02:44,549

01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:46,348

1208
01:02:46,349 --> 01:02:47,820
- Up. - Okay.

1209
01:02:48,289 --> 01:02:50,389
Seven, eight.

1210
01:02:51,459 --> 01:02:53,160
Seven, eight.

1211
01:02:53,459 --> 01:02:56,828
Seven, eight.

1212
01:02:56,829 --> 01:02:58,360
Seven, eight.

1213
01:03:03,269 --> 01:03:04,340
That's right.

1214
01:03:04,970 --> 01:03:06,439
We'll check SEUNGWON's dance moves.

1215
01:03:07,470 --> 01:03:09,209
If you do this on the first attempt,

1216
01:03:09,809 --> 01:03:11,479
I'll buy you beef.

1217
01:03:12,209 --> 01:03:13,410
Hold on.

1218
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:18,019
(He passes the wave part.)

1219
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:20,079
No, that's wrong.

1220
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:21,518
(He moved his hands too early.)

1221
01:03:21,519 --> 01:03:22,650
I'm relieved.

1222
01:03:22,849 --> 01:03:25,160
It's not like this.

1223
01:03:25,519 --> 01:03:27,829
If you get it correct now, I'll buy you pork belly.

1224
01:03:28,030 --> 01:03:29,159
Pork belly is nice.

1225
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:30,360
(The second attempt)

1226
01:03:37,639 --> 01:03:39,669
(He's satisfied.)

1227
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,439
Pork belly.

1228
01:03:41,639 --> 01:03:43,038
Congratulations.

1230
01:03:45,079 --> 01:03:46,339

1231

1233

(But he makes a mistake.)

1234
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:54,189
That was wrong.

1235
01:03:58,119 --> 01:04:01,030
You're too close. You have to go further.

1238
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:09,599
- He practices the most, though. - Right.

1239
01:04:09,769 --> 01:04:11,400
It's important to practice hard.

1240
01:04:11,769 --> 01:04:13,399
But you have to be good.

1241
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:17,379
Actually, people who watch don't know how hardworking you were.

1242
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:18,979
So you have to do it well.

1243
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:21,808
It's sad, but it's reality.

1244
01:04:21,809 --> 01:04:23,208
- It can't be helped. - That's right.

1245
01:04:23,209 --> 01:04:24,820
- I'll do it. - Okay.

Since I'm tone-deaf, a bad dancer, and I can't keep to the rhythm,

1249
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:35,189
it was so hard to find the right tune.

1258

Why?

1259

1262

barely managing to survive here.

1266
01:05:16,729 --> 01:05:19,269
I thought he would bring down the team.

1267
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:22,709
(His anxiety rises as time goes by.)

1268
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:25,780
- I want to ask you something. - Okay.

1269
01:05:26,510 --> 01:05:28,349
Do you think you can do that part well?

1270
01:05:29,780 --> 01:05:31,478
- I can do it well. - Can you do it well?

1271
01:05:31,479 --> 01:05:34,189
- Yes. - I'm saying this since I'm worried.

1272
01:05:34,820 --> 01:05:37,289
I know. I'm worried too, but I should do it.

1273
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:39,889
I'll give that part to AOM.

1274

So...

1275
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:43,958
- Can you do it or not? - I can do it.

1276
01:05:43,959 --> 01:05:45,328
- Okay. Then it's fine. - I can do it.

1277
01:05:45,329 --> 01:05:47,059
He said he could do it.

1278
01:05:47,669 --> 01:05:50,169
But his expression said otherwise.

1279
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:53,970

1282
01:06:01,050 --> 01:06:03,649
I'm really curious.

1283
01:06:03,650 --> 01:06:05,380
- Are you making fun of me? - No.

1284
01:06:06,919 --> 01:06:09,789
How could you do this?

1285
01:06:10,749 --> 01:06:12,260
- I'm not. - Look.

1286
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:14,860
Actually, he'd be frustrated too.

1287
01:06:15,189 --> 01:06:18,160
He practiced a lot.

1288
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:20,598

1289
01:06:20,599 --> 01:06:23,228

1292
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:28,869
That's right.

1293
01:06:31,539 --> 01:06:32,780
It's driving me crazy.

1294
01:06:33,939 --> 01:06:35,809
My body isn't listening to me.

1295
01:06:36,110 --> 01:06:37,880
Since I'm getting stressed while doing this,

1296
01:06:38,950 --> 01:06:40,720
I don't want to be on stage.

1297
01:06:42,019 --> 01:06:44,220
It feels like I'm only a nuisance to the team.

1298
01:06:49,889 --> 01:06:52,130
Did you cry?

1299
01:06:53,059 --> 01:06:55,099
It feels like it will all get ruined because of me.

1300
01:06:55,729 --> 01:06:56,769
That's not true.

1301
01:06:57,369 --> 01:06:59,240
If you have the will to do this,

1302
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:03,169
you can practice harder and achieve it.

1303
01:07:04,139 --> 01:07:05,679
You can do it.

1304
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:06,740
I can do it.

1305
01:07:08,910 --> 01:07:10,455
(He pulls himself together again and starts practicing.)

1306
01:07:10,479 --> 01:07:12,519
No.

1307
01:07:12,919 --> 01:07:15,150
There were many people on the team who were desperate.

1308
01:07:15,820 --> 01:07:20,019
I'll never let them fail because they lost points because of me.

1309
01:07:22,590 --> 01:07:23,760
Good luck!

1310
01:07:25,729 --> 01:07:27,498
Good luck!

1311

1316

They're in a risky position.

1317
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:50,289
They have to do well to advance to the next project.

1318
01:07:51,189 --> 01:07:52,660

1492

We'll start with Team White.

1556
01:20:41,490 --> 01:20:43,559
Sing like you're really performing.

1558
01:21:25,370 --> 01:21:27,638
- This is serious. - What do we do?

1559
01:21:27,639 --> 01:21:29,110
How should I put this?

1560
01:21:29,509 --> 01:21:32,639
We've seen performances by so many other teams.

1561
01:21:33,009 --> 01:21:39,749
Out of all the teams, you lack the most.

1562

You lack the most.

Regarding SUNGMIN...

1565
01:21:48,629 --> 01:21:51,259
I consider having good looks a talent.

1566
01:21:51,660 --> 01:21:54,599
If you sing your part like this, you'll ruin the whole team.

1567
01:21:54,929 --> 01:21:56,329
This isn't how you should practice.

1568
01:21:56,929 --> 01:22:00,169
Everyone has a position including the main vocalist.

1569
01:22:00,170 --> 01:22:02,910
Did you make the best decision possible?

1570
01:22:03,969 --> 01:22:08,080
Can anyone else sing SUNGMIN's high notes?

1571
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:09,809
- Would it be hard? - Yes.

1572
01:22:10,250 --> 01:22:11,279

1573
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:13,219

01:22:13,549 --> 01:22:16,588
I hope that you'll improve and show us.

01:22:16,589 --> 01:22:19,518
Improve yourself so that we feel bad about giving you this feedback.

01:22:19,519 --> 01:22:22,388
I'd like you to perform well just once...

1577
01:22:22,389 --> 01:22:23,530
and make us admire you.

1578
01:22:24,089 --> 01:22:26,499
I could become someone useless...

1579
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:28,400
on this team.

1580
01:22:29,599 --> 01:22:32,639
I thought that it went smoothly,

1581
01:22:32,769 --> 01:22:34,669
but the result was contrary to my belief.

1582
01:22:34,670 --> 01:22:38,610
There are parts that we must figure out quickly.

1583
01:22:38,939 --> 01:22:41,439
What worries me the most is SUNGMIN's part.

1584
01:22:42,450 --> 01:22:45,319
If someone else can sing his part,

1585
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:47,019
they should be switched.

1586
01:22:47,219 --> 01:22:50,120
But it's physically impossible.

1587
01:22:51,790 --> 01:22:54,160
To be honest, I'm at a loss.

1588
01:22:55,259 --> 01:22:57,188
Jealousy

1589
01:22:57,189 --> 01:22:58,258
(While assigning parts)

1590
01:22:58,259 --> 01:23:00,228
What I'm not

1591
01:23:00,229 --> 01:23:02,569
This part has...

1592
01:23:02,570 --> 01:23:03,830
sub vocalist 1, 2, and 3.

1593
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:07,099
Only HANBIN, JEONGMIN, and I can sing this part, right?

1594
01:23:07,299 --> 01:23:08,299
(They need one more person to sing the high notes.)

1595
01:23:08,300 --> 01:23:09,670
What should we do?

1596
01:23:11,170 --> 01:23:13,109
- JINWON, is your voice changing? - Yes.

1597
01:23:13,110 --> 01:23:14,855
- In that case... - It could be hard for him.

1598
01:23:14,879 --> 01:23:16,548
Your sincerity

1599
01:23:16,549 --> 01:23:18,449
- Sincerity - Sincerity...

1600
01:23:18,450 --> 01:23:20,120
(He's not even close.)

1601
01:23:20,479 --> 01:23:22,489
I'm just curious about your sincerity

1602
01:23:22,490 --> 01:23:23,889
I'm just...

1603
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:25,258
Okay.

1604
01:23:25,259 --> 01:23:26,535
(It's also impossible for KENSHIN.)

1605
01:23:26,559 --> 01:23:27,758
I'm just...

1606
01:23:27,759 --> 01:23:29,329
I'm just curious

1607
01:23:29,330 --> 01:23:32,459
I'm just curious about your sincerity

1608
01:23:32,460 --> 01:23:34,400
You're mixing the notes.

1609
01:23:34,599 --> 01:23:36,000
He might be able to do it.

1610
01:23:36,330 --> 01:23:37,500
I think you can do it.

1611
01:23:38,330 --> 01:23:39,400
I'll be honest.

1612
01:23:39,769 --> 01:23:42,210
No one else other than you can do it.

1613
01:23:44,170 --> 01:23:46,610
Okay, I'll try my best.

1614
01:23:46,939 --> 01:23:49,410
SUNGMIN isn't singing that part because he wants to.

1615
01:23:49,809 --> 01:23:52,979
He's our last resort because no one else can sing high.

1616
01:23:53,219 --> 01:23:54,950
If I were SUNGMIN,

1617
01:23:55,450 --> 01:23:57,750
I'd have done anything to avoid singing that part.

1618
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:02,058
On the other hand, SUNGMIN agreed to do it.

1619
01:24:02,059 --> 01:24:06,200
I felt sorry and grateful at the same time.

1620
01:24:06,799 --> 01:24:08,729
In my opinion,

1621
01:24:09,229 --> 01:24:13,069
it'd be difficult to give SUNGMIN's part...

1622
01:24:13,070 --> 01:24:15,339
- to someone else. - I agree.

1623
01:24:15,370 --> 01:24:17,070
- No one else can sing it. - Right.

1624
01:24:17,370 --> 01:24:21,609
SUNGMIN, practice with me and JAEWON.

1625
01:24:21,610 --> 01:24:23,409
Let's try to fix it.

1626
01:24:23,410 --> 01:24:25,579
We'll help you as much as possible.

1627
01:24:25,580 --> 01:24:27,879
Please follow our lead as much as you can.

1628
01:24:28,049 --> 01:24:29,150
Okay.

1629
01:24:29,689 --> 01:24:33,059
I should just focus on doing my best.

1630
01:24:35,219 --> 01:24:38,490
They said that I might ruin the entire team.

1631
01:24:40,059 --> 01:24:41,830
I'll try to avoid causing harm.

1632
01:24:42,870 --> 01:24:46,369
After watching the show, I read many people's comments.

1633
01:24:46,370 --> 01:24:49,939
I got criticized a lot for my skills.

1634
01:24:50,870 --> 01:24:54,280
(For his potential, he got S rank.)

1635
01:24:54,679 --> 01:24:56,950
(With help from P4 teammates)

1636
01:24:57,549 --> 01:25:00,080
(First Tier Zone during Title Song Trainees' Self Assembly)

1637
01:25:00,479 --> 01:25:02,589
I lacked a lot of skills.

1638
01:25:03,990 --> 01:25:07,189
(He ranked 3rd during the 1st Passing Ceremony.)

1639
01:25:08,729 --> 01:25:11,959
People who have better skills than me got eliminated.

1640
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:15,798
So I thought that I should pull my weight...

1641
01:25:15,799 --> 01:25:17,169
and more for them.

1642
01:25:17,170 --> 01:25:19,838
Instead of being known as someone who survived...

1643
01:25:19,839 --> 01:25:21,638
for his popularity,

1644
01:25:21,639 --> 01:25:25,309
I want to show people that I'm here to work hard.

1645
01:25:26,710 --> 01:25:28,379
What I'm doing

1646
01:25:29,150 --> 01:25:31,080
Actually, I'm enjoying it

1647
01:25:31,650 --> 01:25:33,849
Rest time. Let's take a break.

1648
01:25:35,490 --> 01:25:39,259
(He practices even during the break.)

1649
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:44,329
I must improve myself quickly and reach their average skill.

1650
01:25:44,330 --> 01:25:48,000
I was worried because I didn't have much time.

1651
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:50,769
- That's good. - Whenever you look at me,

1652
01:25:50,969 --> 01:25:52,849
why do you keep scratching your head and think,

1653
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:55,170
"That looks strange."

1654
01:25:55,469 --> 01:25:56,469
(He looks less confident.)

1655
01:25:56,470 --> 01:25:58,939
No way. When did I do that?

1656
01:25:59,009 --> 01:26:01,110
I'll try my best not to stand out.

1657
01:26:01,809 --> 01:26:04,250
I could tell that SUNGMIN was less enthusiastic.

1658
01:26:04,849 --> 01:26:06,019
The reality is hitting me.

1659
01:26:09,019 --> 01:26:11,548
It must be very frustrating for him.

1660
01:26:11,549 --> 01:26:13,120
It can't be what he wants.

1661
01:26:14,559 --> 01:26:16,759
(Suddenly getting up)

1662
01:26:16,860 --> 01:26:17,990
I'm enduring it.

1663
01:26:18,729 --> 01:26:19,830
Which part?

1664
01:26:20,530 --> 01:26:23,529
One and two, three and four...

1665
01:26:23,530 --> 01:26:25,700
and five, six.

1666
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:27,269
That's good.

1667
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:30,909
You know tug-of-war?

1668
01:26:30,910 --> 01:26:33,079
JEONGMIN taught me in detail...

1669
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:35,749
at my eye level.

1670
01:26:35,750 --> 01:26:38,109
Someone pushed your shoulder. It's that feeling,

1671
01:26:38,110 --> 01:26:39,219
but do it slowly.

1672
01:26:39,650 --> 01:26:41,620
And one. That's good.

1673
01:26:42,189 --> 01:26:43,869
- Three, four. That's good. - Three, four.

1674
01:26:44,519 --> 01:26:45,519
(Swinging)

1675
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:46,558
(Exclaiming)

1676
01:26:46,559 --> 01:26:47,920
- Did I do it? - That's it.

1677
01:26:49,059 --> 01:26:51,860
Whenever he complimented me, I felt more confident.

1678
01:26:52,129 --> 01:26:54,330
It made me make more effort.

1679
01:26:55,670 --> 01:26:58,128
That's good. You look sexy already.

1680
01:26:58,129 --> 01:27:00,570
- Do I look sexy? - It looks sexy when the hair moves.

1681
01:27:00,900 --> 01:27:03,569
Since it's about survival, the individual comes first.

1682
01:27:03,570 --> 01:27:06,910
But I don't want to think only about myself.

1683
01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:09,809
I want to share what I know.

1684
01:27:10,309 --> 01:27:13,279
One and two, three and four and five.

1685
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:15,518
- You got it now. - He totally got it.

1686
01:27:15,519 --> 01:27:16,519
I got it?

1687
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:18,619
I didn't know which one was JEONGMIN based on your dancing.

1688
01:27:18,620 --> 01:27:19,790
I was JEONGMIN.

1689
01:27:19,820 --> 01:27:21,089
SUNGMIN, JEONGMIN.

1690
01:27:22,129 --> 01:27:25,929
(Two MIN's succeed in dancing in sync.)

1691
01:27:26,860 --> 01:27:30,268
I'm just curious about your sincerity

1692
01:27:30,269 --> 01:27:31,670
Just use it.

1693
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:33,768
Don't say that you can't do it.

1694
01:27:33,769 --> 01:27:35,509
That's the right way to go.

1695
01:27:36,870 --> 01:27:39,410
(SHIN JAEWON is in charge of checking the high notes.)

1696
01:27:39,710 --> 01:27:42,249
That's it. Your voice doesn't crack, right?

1697
01:27:42,250 --> 01:27:43,679
You sound like SVIAT.

1698
01:27:44,349 --> 01:27:45,820
Hello.

1699
01:27:46,120 --> 01:27:47,519
(When he can't reach the note, )

1700
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:50,120
(he turns into SVIAT.)

1701
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:53,120
(He came up with SVIAT's singing method.)

1702
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:54,360
(Singing)

1703
01:27:54,361 --> 01:27:55,789
You missed the note from the start.

1704
01:27:55,790 --> 01:27:57,030
Look for SVIAT.

1705
01:27:57,089 --> 01:27:59,099
- Hello. - That's right.

1706
01:27:59,429 --> 01:28:01,400
What I'm not

1707
01:28:01,460 --> 01:28:03,469
What I'm not

1708
01:28:03,629 --> 01:28:06,570
SUNGMIN's voice sounds like it's getting higher.

1709
01:28:06,740 --> 01:28:08,339
He's good.

1710
01:28:08,439 --> 01:28:10,338
Get lower. Okay.

1711
01:28:10,339 --> 01:28:11,339
Sing.

1712
01:28:11,340 --> 01:28:14,279
I'm just curious about your sincerity

1713
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:16,479
You almost got it. Try it again.

1714
01:28:16,679 --> 01:28:18,279
I'm just curious

1715
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:20,449
I'm just curious about your sincerity

1716
01:28:20,450 --> 01:28:21,949
That's it. You got it.

1717
01:28:21,950 --> 01:28:23,449
Jealousy

1718
01:28:23,450 --> 01:28:25,419
What I'm not

1719
01:28:25,420 --> 01:28:26,688
- That's it. - Gosh.

1720
01:28:26,689 --> 01:28:29,165
You got it, but let's do it again. You need to sing like this.

1721
01:28:29,189 --> 01:28:33,399
I thought that SUNGMIN would have a hard time understanding,

1722
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:35,969
but he understood quickly, and his singing got fixed.

1723
01:28:36,269 --> 01:28:40,570
I thought that it'd be the most difficult thing in his life.

1724
01:28:40,870 --> 01:28:42,610
SUNGMIN, you can sing. What did I tell you?

1725
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:46,139
- Thank you. - Right? You have a good voice.

1726
01:28:46,540 --> 01:28:47,679
- It's sexy. - Yes.

1727
01:28:47,979 --> 01:28:49,008
There you go.

1728
01:28:49,009 --> 01:28:50,649
- Did you see it, guys? - Yes.

1729
01:28:50,650 --> 01:28:52,179
- Do you get it? - Yes.

1730
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:53,879
You've got to do it like this.

1731
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:55,649
Hearing repeated compliments,

1732
01:28:55,650 --> 01:28:59,719
I eventually felt like I could do it.

1733
01:29:00,019 --> 01:29:01,620
It's fun to practice.

1734
01:29:01,719 --> 01:29:02,790
Let's go again.

1735
01:29:02,830 --> 01:29:04,665
It's going to work. It's going to work for sure.

1736
01:29:04,689 --> 01:29:05,860
We're going to get it done.

1737
01:29:06,660 --> 01:29:10,500
I've been getting help from many people within the show.

1738
01:29:10,900 --> 01:29:13,799
Maybe I saved a country in my past life or something.

1739
01:29:14,269 --> 01:29:16,710
SUNGMIN, relax. You can do it. Let's go.

1740
01:29:16,740 --> 01:29:17,869
Don't be so tense.

1741
01:29:17,870 --> 01:29:21,580
I wanted to show what I could do this time.

1742
01:29:21,839 --> 01:29:23,950
And I wanted to pull it off at least for once.

1743
01:29:25,450 --> 01:29:27,450
I'm most excited about this team's performance.

1744
01:29:27,679 --> 01:29:29,920
We'll finally get to watch HYUNWOO dance.

1745
01:29:29,950 --> 01:29:32,289
Now that his leg is all better, he'll be all free.

1746
01:29:32,290 --> 01:29:35,360
I hope they gain strength from the fans' support.

1747
01:29:35,929 --> 01:29:38,259
SUNGMIN might burst out crying after the performance.

1748
01:29:40,530 --> 01:29:44,000
("Jealousy" by Gureurung)

1749
01:30:06,089 --> 01:30:07,188
HANBIN!

1750
01:30:07,189 --> 01:30:08,719
HANBIN just nailed the intro part.

1751
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:10,259
His voice sounds so cool.

1752
01:30:25,979 --> 01:30:27,240
My goodness.

1753
01:30:34,750 --> 01:30:35,790
Goodness!

1755
01:31:08,620 --> 01:31:10,226
I've never seen KENSHIN like that before.

1756
01:31:10,250 --> 01:31:12,189
What an unexpected charm.

1757
01:31:48,059 --> 01:31:49,589
Gosh, his voice is so...

1758
01:31:59,900 --> 01:32:01,400
This part sure is high-pitched.

1759
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:27,559
How sexy.

1760
01:32:42,549 --> 01:32:45,478

01:33:02,599 --> 01:33:03,929
Goodness.

1770
01:33:04,269 --> 01:33:06,339
I love it. I love this performance.

1771
01:33:06,740 --> 01:33:09,740
They sure are unbelievably skilled.

1772
01:33:09,870 --> 01:33:12,139
- They prepared it well. - They're so good.

1773
01:33:12,439 --> 01:33:14,178
HYUNWOO is like a cheat key.

1774
01:33:14,179 --> 01:33:16,450
How did he hold back thus far?

1775
01:33:21,420 --> 01:33:22,420
Nice.

1776
01:33:22,549 --> 01:33:24,249
- Sorry. - Good job.

1777
01:33:24,250 --> 01:33:25,289
It's all right.

1778
01:33:25,290 --> 01:33:28,620
Others could be eliminated because of me.

1779
01:33:28,759 --> 01:33:29,759
It's all right.

1780
01:33:30,759 --> 01:33:33,999
I could've performed much better.

1781
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:37,129
I was disappointed in myself in some ways.

1782
01:33:37,370 --> 01:33:39,099
I feel so bad.

1783
01:33:40,639 --> 01:33:43,609
I'm truly grateful to Team "Jealousy..."

1784
01:33:43,610 --> 01:33:46,478
for following the lead so well without any conflicts or wavering.

1785
01:33:46,479 --> 01:33:48,315
Will you shed tears this time again? Are you going to cry?

1786
01:33:48,339 --> 01:33:50,750
I wouldn't cry anymore. I'm a macho now.

1787
01:33:51,210 --> 01:33:52,309
I'm a macho.

1788
01:33:52,679 --> 01:33:54,049
Together...

1789
01:33:54,120 --> 01:33:56,289
We love you, World Assemblers.

1790

1797
01:34:10,129 --> 01:34:11,769
Their center is MAJINGXIANG.

1798
01:34:12,540 --> 01:34:15,869
When we were first given this mission,

1799
01:34:15,870 --> 01:34:18,468
the other team's rank...

1800
01:34:18,469 --> 01:34:20,610
was higher than ours.

1801
01:34:22,549 --> 01:34:24,950
(During the team selection for Rival Matching)

1802
01:34:24,979 --> 01:34:27,120
Did you choose the trainees?

1803

(KENSHIN's 1st pick, Trainee KIM HYUNWOO)

1804

(Team "GAMBLER" is composed of trainees who weren't chosen.)

1810
01:34:44,070 --> 01:34:46,468
We're the leftover trainees...

1811
01:34:46,469 --> 01:34:49,040
who weren't chosen by Team White.

1812
01:34:49,099 --> 01:34:52,070
So we're disheartened to begin with.

1813
01:34:52,580 --> 01:34:55,209
We'd try to do something if we had enthusiasm or passion.

1814
01:34:55,210 --> 01:34:56,450
But we don't seem to have any.

1815
01:34:57,610 --> 01:34:58,750
I feel lost.

1816
01:34:59,349 --> 01:35:00,450
Why don't we get to it?

1817
01:35:00,620 --> 01:35:01,679
Let's practice hard.

1818
01:35:01,879 --> 01:35:05,888
(Trainee OH SEUNGCHAN leads the team's practice.)

1819
01:35:05,889 --> 01:35:07,259
And there.

1820
01:35:07,490 --> 01:35:09,559
Our team's leader is HAJOON.

1821
01:35:09,689 --> 01:35:11,859
I've been helping him...

1822
01:35:11,860 --> 01:35:14,500
lead the choreography practice.

1823
01:35:14,729 --> 01:35:16,900
But I'm honestly frustrated.

1824
01:35:17,330 --> 01:35:18,969
When I was memorizing the choreography,

1825
01:35:19,269 --> 01:35:22,040
I didn't get to see if my teammates were practicing or not.

1826
01:35:22,939 --> 01:35:26,540
When I checked for a bit, I saw one of them asleep.

1827
01:35:27,080 --> 01:35:29,349
They aren't enthusiastic to practice. That's one issue.

1828
01:35:29,950 --> 01:35:33,250
But the unenthusiastic teammates...

1829
01:35:33,450 --> 01:35:35,119
seem lost without a backbone.

1830
01:35:35,120 --> 01:35:37,549
I think that's the biggest problem.

1831
01:35:38,019 --> 01:35:41,219
Aside from the details, we have to go over the whole choreography.

1832
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:45,460
I think it will take until 6pm for us to do the whole thing.

1833
01:35:45,530 --> 01:35:46,700
We must.

1834
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:48,199
Are you saying we should do it until 6pm?

1835
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:50,146
Wouldn't it be prettier with our feet moving like this?

1836
01:35:50,170 --> 01:35:51,298
Like this?

1837
01:35:51,299 --> 01:35:54,499
This isn't in the video. I don't think it's necessary.

1838
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:57,309
I don't get why you call it unnecessary.

1839
01:35:57,509 --> 01:35:58,968
If unnecessary...

1840
01:35:58,969 --> 01:36:01,410
I'm talking about convenience.

1841
01:36:01,740 --> 01:36:03,508
The leader and SEUNGCHAN...

1842
01:36:03,509 --> 01:36:06,048
have different opinions in some ways.

1843
01:36:06,049 --> 01:36:08,719
It put a stop to our practice.

1844
01:36:09,849 --> 01:36:12,419
Let me tell you this in case you're mistaken.

1845
01:36:12,420 --> 01:36:14,719
Honestly speaking, I think you are...

1846
01:36:15,219 --> 01:36:18,628
looking down on me to some degree.

1847
01:36:18,629 --> 01:36:21,298
I'm trying to lead the practice.

1848
01:36:21,299 --> 01:36:24,000
I rather think that's a behavior of looking down on me.

1849
01:36:24,629 --> 01:36:26,170
What are they talking about?

1850
01:36:28,339 --> 01:36:29,509
I don't know.

1851
01:36:29,870 --> 01:36:32,509
That honestly wasted a lot of time.

1852
01:36:32,710 --> 01:36:34,210
Why don't we just talk outside?

1853
01:36:35,009 --> 01:36:38,379
(The two of them even leave the training room.)

1854
01:36:39,179 --> 01:36:42,250
If you were going to do that, you should've been the leader.

1855
01:36:42,820 --> 01:36:45,420
If you were going to boss it without any talking.

1856
01:36:46,219 --> 01:36:47,759
No...

1857
01:36:48,460 --> 01:36:49,990
I could be eliminated for real.

1858
01:36:51,889 --> 01:36:53,830
If our team loses,

1859
01:36:54,660 --> 01:36:55,729
we will lose our points.

1860
01:36:55,900 --> 01:36:58,070
It got me so mad.

1861
01:36:58,370 --> 01:37:00,769
I'm ranked 49th right now.

1862
01:37:00,839 --> 01:37:03,938
If I get my points taken away, I'll be out for real.

1863
01:37:03,939 --> 01:37:05,009
So...

1864
01:37:05,740 --> 01:37:08,138
- Hey, when can we resume... - Oh, I'm sorry.

1865
01:37:08,139 --> 01:37:09,209
Is everyone not practicing?

1866
01:37:09,210 --> 01:37:11,978
I'm so sorry, but tell them to practice the third verse.

1867
01:37:11,979 --> 01:37:13,320
I'm so sorry. I'll be right back.

1868
01:37:16,719 --> 01:37:17,789
Are they over?

1869
01:37:17,790 --> 01:37:19,889
He wants us to practice, but how are we supposed to?

1870
01:37:20,059 --> 01:37:21,160
I mean...

1871
01:37:21,889 --> 01:37:23,859
(And another guy is getting frustrated.)

1872
01:37:23,860 --> 01:37:27,428
We don't have much time left.

1873
01:37:27,429 --> 01:37:30,229
But they took an hour and 30 minutes.

1874
01:37:30,330 --> 01:37:32,870
I honestly think it's wrong.

1875
01:37:33,099 --> 01:37:35,599
I'm a member of this team myself.

1876
01:37:35,639 --> 01:37:37,839
So I think it's part of my responsibility.

1877
01:37:38,240 --> 01:37:39,679
I want to save this team.

1878
01:37:40,179 --> 01:37:42,910
- Dance and one more time. - Guys.

1879
01:37:43,210 --> 01:37:44,349
Let's do it first.

1880
01:37:44,580 --> 01:37:48,049
(MAJINGXIANG leads the practice on the leader's behalf.)

1881
01:37:49,650 --> 01:37:50,820
Stand by.

1882
01:37:51,650 --> 01:37:54,018
Focus when I talk about the key moves.

1883
01:37:54,019 --> 01:37:56,729
If you listen, please answer yes.

1884
01:37:57,059 --> 01:37:59,159
Don't do this part half-heartedly.

1885
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:00,929
Be more expressive.

1886
01:38:01,030 --> 01:38:02,928
A little more to this side.

1887
01:38:02,929 --> 01:38:04,170
Just a little.

1888
01:38:04,229 --> 01:38:05,969
SANTA, move a little to the side.

1889
01:38:06,099 --> 01:38:07,170
Okay.

1890
01:38:07,240 --> 01:38:10,138
I think we have to stay a little more focused.

1891
01:38:10,139 --> 01:38:11,768
We don't lack skills.

1892
01:38:11,769 --> 01:38:13,009
I think the mood...

1893
01:38:13,710 --> 01:38:16,149
should change.

1894
01:38:16,150 --> 01:38:19,679
I'd like us to be determined to win.

1895
01:38:20,580 --> 01:38:24,018
MAJINGXIANG played a leader on my behalf.

1896
01:38:24,019 --> 01:38:25,289
I'm so grateful for it.

1897
01:38:25,290 --> 01:38:28,119
I could tell that MAJINGXIANG was trying...

1898
01:38:28,120 --> 01:38:31,790
to lead the team somehow as we practiced.

1899
01:38:32,189 --> 01:38:35,299
That was how we eventually gained focus.

1900
01:38:35,599 --> 01:38:37,329
We were getting close...

1901
01:38:37,330 --> 01:38:38,599
just when...

1902
01:38:38,929 --> 01:38:40,399
You doze off every day, no?

1903
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:41,768
- Yes. - You doze off all the time.

1904
01:38:41,769 --> 01:38:42,808
So why would you get playful?

1905
01:38:42,809 --> 01:38:45,438
It wasn't when things were tough.

1906
01:38:45,439 --> 01:38:47,679
It was a long time ago.

1907
01:38:49,450 --> 01:38:50,649
Let's look at ourselves in the mirror.

1908
01:38:50,650 --> 01:38:52,090
(They're about to begin practicing.)

1909
01:38:52,650 --> 01:38:54,450
SVIAT.

1910
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:58,789
You have to be in your positions. You shouldn't do it as you walk.

1911
01:38:58,790 --> 01:39:00,359
(A new challenge was given to Team "GAMBLER.")

1912
01:39:00,360 --> 01:39:01,518
Did you hear it?

1913
01:39:01,519 --> 01:39:02,990
- Yes. - SVIAT.

1914
01:39:04,330 --> 01:39:05,360
Focus.

1915
01:39:10,370 --> 01:39:12,128
- Stop getting playful. - What?

1916
01:39:12,129 --> 01:39:14,069
- Don't get playful. - SVIAT. One more time.

1917
01:39:14,070 --> 01:39:15,099
Don't get playful.

1918
01:39:16,099 --> 01:39:19,210
SVIAT hardly focuses when we practice.

1919
01:39:19,740 --> 01:39:24,309
He keeps getting distracted and missing the timing.

1920
01:39:24,580 --> 01:39:26,650
The performance is near,

1921
01:39:26,719 --> 01:39:29,650
so I'm getting more anxious.

1922
01:39:30,019 --> 01:39:31,019
Okay, let's do it.

1923
01:39:31,020 --> 01:39:33,089
(When they're about to continue with the practice)

1924
01:39:33,759 --> 01:39:35,789
Nice.

(SVIAT jokes around with Team White.)

1926
01:39:37,129 --> 01:39:39,959
SVIAT, stop it.

1927
01:39:39,960 --> 01:39:41,129
Knock it off.

1928
01:39:42,660 --> 01:39:45,799
Focus already. I keep telling you.

1929
01:39:47,439 --> 01:39:50,710
Don't get playful with the other team.

1930
01:39:57,150 --> 01:39:58,649
I'm lost.

1931
01:39:58,650 --> 01:40:04,750

1932
01:40:05,490 --> 01:40:08,519
We're soon to perform on stage...

1933
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:12,360
We have SVIAT, one of the youngest members.

1934
01:40:13,160 --> 01:40:15,099
He could be frustrated too.

1935
01:40:15,559 --> 01:40:19,330
As an older member myself,

1936
01:40:19,839 --> 01:40:21,098
I want to help him out.

1937
01:40:21,099 --> 01:40:23,170
Consider this as your balance.

1938
01:40:24,410 --> 01:40:25,539
- I like that - I like that

1939
01:40:25,540 --> 01:40:26,809
Don't sing someone else's part.

1940
01:40:28,639 --> 01:40:29,749
- Secret - Secret

1941
01:40:29,750 --> 01:40:30,808
Don't do it, SVIAT.

1942
01:40:30,809 --> 01:40:33,819
- This is a practice. Don't sing. - Okay.

1943
01:40:33,820 --> 01:40:36,178
SVIAT, you must not get playful.

1944
01:40:36,179 --> 01:40:37,289
You must focus more.

1945
01:40:37,290 --> 01:40:38,319
(MAJINGXIANG flat-out scolds him unlike usual.)

1946
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:39,790
Do the ending here, guys.

1947
01:40:39,990 --> 01:40:41,388
SVIAT, don't move.

1948
01:40:41,389 --> 01:40:42,460
Eight and...

1949
01:40:43,660 --> 01:40:45,429
- SVIAT, you're fast. - Okay.

1950
01:40:45,790 --> 01:40:46,799
Again.

1951
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:51,870
(What's the result of his Spartan training?)

1952
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,539
I think...

1953
01:40:53,540 --> 01:40:55,799
SVIAT is dancing so hard.

1954
01:40:56,540 --> 01:40:59,040
- You're doing a good job. - Okay.

1955
01:41:00,179 --> 01:41:02,308
- Your help... - You didn't miss it.

1956
01:41:02,309 --> 01:41:03,978

1958
01:41:05,580 --> 01:41:08,219
This is my second time participating in a survival show.

1959
01:41:08,280 --> 01:41:11,388
Last time, I got eliminated during the second competition.

1960
01:41:11,389 --> 01:41:14,059
I really want to make a debut this time.

1961
01:41:14,089 --> 01:41:17,490
So we must win no matter what.

1962
01:41:17,660 --> 01:41:20,460
But I lack in many ways.

1963
01:41:20,530 --> 01:41:22,099
I need to practice much harder.

1964
01:41:22,229 --> 01:41:25,099
If I'm determined to even practice sleeplessly,

1965
01:41:25,330 --> 01:41:26,798
I believe I'll make it.

1966
01:41:26,799 --> 01:41:29,910
You don't know

1967
01:41:30,809 --> 01:41:32,438
Why do you practice so much?

1968
01:41:32,439 --> 01:41:33,610
I want to do well.

1969
01:41:34,439 --> 01:41:35,479
Let's go.

1970
01:41:36,610 --> 01:41:38,009
Nice confidence.

They're so good.

1974
01:41:54,330 --> 01:41:56,029
I don't think we should finish here.

1975
01:41:56,030 --> 01:41:57,245
(They got intimidated on their way to the dorm.)

1976
01:41:57,269 --> 01:42:00,069
Okay, everyone. Let's give all our might.

1978

Our practice was delayed a lot.

1980

I thought we were hopeless at first.

1981
01:42:10,110 --> 01:42:14,080
We're going to show a twist as Team Black.

1982
01:42:14,219 --> 01:42:16,150
We'll do our best. We can do it!

01:49:34,059 --> 01:49:36,420
I felt troubled.

2099
01:49:37,929 --> 01:49:41,030
(Each team's 1st and 2nd places remain.)

2100
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:43,499
(WOO HAJOON: 44 votes, KIM HYUNWOO: 98 votes)

2101
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:46,400
(MAJINGXIANG: 98 votes, SAKURADA KENSHIN: 100 votes)

2102
01:49:46,530 --> 01:49:48,438
(WOO HAJOON: 2nd place, KIM HYUNWOO: 2nd place)

2103
01:49:48,439 --> 01:49:50,268
(MAJINGXIANG: 1st place, SAKURADA KENSHIN: 1st place)

2104
01:49:50,269 --> 01:49:51,939
That's impressive.

2105
01:49:52,269 --> 01:49:53,609
You're MVP.

2106
01:49:53,610 --> 01:49:55,508
- You're MVP. - KENSHIN.

2107
01:49:55,509 --> 01:49:56,739
- Well done. - Well done.

2108
01:49:56,740 --> 01:49:58,049
MAJINGXIANG, nice.

2109
01:49:58,809 --> 01:50:01,080
- Gosh. 98 votes. - He received a lot of votes.

2110
01:50:01,219 --> 01:50:02,978
He's behind KENSHIN by two votes.

2111
01:50:02,979 --> 01:50:04,489
That's a small difference.

2112
01:50:04,490 --> 01:50:06,610
HYUNWOO, he received the same number of votes as you.

2113
01:50:06,990 --> 01:50:10,389
(Despite placing 1st, KENSHIN doesn't look very happy.)

2114
01:50:11,589 --> 01:50:13,089
My heart aches.

2115
01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:16,399
I saw SVIAT...

2116
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:19,500
in the practice room every day.

2117
01:50:20,500 --> 01:50:21,599
Seriously.

2118
01:50:23,870 --> 01:50:27,710
My heart aches.

2119
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:31,308
Happiness isn't the only thing I feel.

2120
01:50:31,309 --> 01:50:34,150
I'm sure all winning teams feel that way.

2121
01:50:34,519 --> 01:50:36,219
I felt so bad.

2122
01:50:36,580 --> 01:50:38,849
ATILLA's high notes...

2123
01:50:39,290 --> 01:50:42,660
made me think, "I should sing like that."

2124
01:50:43,019 --> 01:50:45,729
I almost shed tears right then and there,

2125
01:50:45,889 --> 01:50:47,200
but I pushed them down.

2126
01:50:47,860 --> 01:50:51,670
I felt so bad for the World Assemblers.

2127
01:50:51,929 --> 01:50:54,639
I feel the responsibility...

2128
01:50:54,740 --> 01:50:57,469
for the team's score with my entire body.

2129
01:50:58,240 --> 01:50:59,768
In many ways...

2130
01:50:59,769 --> 01:51:01,056
(As the leader of the defeated team)

2131
01:51:01,080 --> 01:51:03,649
I feel bad for my teammates.

2132
01:51:03,650 --> 01:51:07,450
I'm not someone who has the best techniques.

2133
01:51:08,349 --> 01:51:10,189
Seriously,

2134
01:51:10,719 --> 01:51:13,389
we practiced very diligently.

2135
01:51:13,820 --> 01:51:15,519
(Hugging)

2136
01:51:16,120 --> 01:51:18,530
That's why I think...

2137
01:51:18,990 --> 01:51:20,399
that we won as well.

2138
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:21,575
(They lost, but it isn't the end.)

2139
01:51:21,599 --> 01:51:23,928
- Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you for your hard work.

2140
01:51:23,929 --> 01:51:25,029
They worked hard.

2141
01:51:25,030 --> 01:51:26,939
We saw how hard they worked.

2142
01:51:27,439 --> 01:51:29,269
Team "GAMBLER" worked very hard too.

2143
01:51:29,570 --> 01:51:32,109
We'll have to work hard...

2144
01:51:32,110 --> 01:51:34,009
so that we wouldn't be embarrassed as winners.

2145
01:51:34,080 --> 01:51:36,809
I want to show my improvements to everyone.

2146
01:51:37,009 --> 01:51:40,620
I'll push myself and practice.

2147
01:51:41,150 --> 01:51:43,250
Now comes the last group for the Rival Matching.

2148
01:51:43,349 --> 01:51:44,919
(SONG SEUNGHO)

2149
01:51:44,920 --> 01:51:47,360
This is a group with the ability to produce themselves...

2150
01:51:47,460 --> 01:51:49,289
which paves the path...

2151
01:51:49,290 --> 01:51:51,830
for the genre that is as intense and addictive as mala.

2152
01:51:52,030 --> 01:51:54,299
It's Stray Kids.

2153
01:51:58,170 --> 01:51:59,969
Stray Kids.

2154
01:52:00,099 --> 01:52:02,468
One song is from 2022 with the lyrics...

2155
01:52:02,469 --> 01:52:05,709
about having endless confidence even before love.

2156
01:52:05,710 --> 01:52:07,040
It's "CASE 143."

2157
01:52:07,780 --> 01:52:10,138
Then there's a song from 2023...

2158
01:52:10,139 --> 01:52:12,548
which received 100 million views for its music video on YouTube...

2159
01:52:12,549 --> 01:52:14,419
and became a mega-hit song. It's "LALALALA."

2160
01:52:14,420 --> 01:52:16,100
(Stray Kids: "CASE 143" versus "LALALALA")

2161
01:52:19,019 --> 01:52:22,120
Lalalala

2162
01:52:22,389 --> 01:52:24,159
Two rival teams that'll compete...

2163
01:52:24,160 --> 01:52:27,058
with "CASE 143" and "LALALALA,"

2164
01:52:27,059 --> 01:52:28,629
please come up to the stage.

2165
01:52:29,229 --> 01:52:32,099
(Team White, "LALALALA")

2166
01:52:33,670 --> 01:52:36,069
(Team Black, "CASE 143")

2167
01:52:36,070 --> 01:52:39,769
(Stray Kids: "CASE 143" versus "LALALALA")

2168
01:52:45,009 --> 01:52:46,349
(YOO HEEDO)

2169
01:52:46,379 --> 01:52:47,849
(SEUNGHO)

2170
01:52:49,879 --> 01:52:51,319
They're the Avengers.

2171
01:52:51,320 --> 01:52:53,149
- This is really insane. - Seriously.

2172
01:52:53,150 --> 01:52:54,319
This is really insane.

2173
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:56,519
There are so many debut candidates in that one row.

2174
01:52:56,920 --> 01:52:58,790
Team "LALALALA" is like the dream team.

2175
01:52:59,030 --> 01:53:01,258
It'll be hard to pick the best one...

2176
01:53:01,259 --> 01:53:02,598
since so many members are talented.

2177
01:53:02,599 --> 01:53:04,098
It'll also be hard to pick the better team.

2178
01:53:04,099 --> 01:53:05,200
Both teams are good.

2179
01:53:05,929 --> 01:53:08,239
- We'll take this case. - We'll take this case.

2180
01:53:08,240 --> 01:53:09,938
- Two, three. Hello. - Hello.

2181
01:53:09,939 --> 01:53:11,539
- We're Lover Cops. - We're Lover Cops.

2182
01:53:11,540 --> 01:53:13,139
(KIM SIHUN)

2183
01:53:13,240 --> 01:53:15,580
Team "LALALALA" will say hello as well.

2184
01:53:15,939 --> 01:53:18,379
We'll fall into the arms of the World Assemblers.

2185
01:53:18,450 --> 01:53:20,379
Older boys and girls, come to me.

2186
01:53:20,420 --> 01:53:23,179
Hello, we're Team Warack.

2187
01:53:28,790 --> 01:53:30,059
How cute.

2188
01:53:30,219 --> 01:53:34,099
KIM SIHUN, you're the leader of Team Black with "CASE 143."

2189
01:53:34,160 --> 01:53:36,829
- Yes. - Although you didn't get picked,

2190
01:53:36,830 --> 01:53:38,170
your self-esteem is at its max.

2191
01:53:38,429 --> 01:53:39,769
MINWOOK...

2192
01:53:40,439 --> 01:53:42,170
didn't pick me.

2193
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:46,938
However, I've already proven my skills...

2194
01:53:46,939 --> 01:53:49,580
through previous competitions.

2195
01:53:49,740 --> 01:53:51,409
So my confidence, self-esteem,

2196
01:53:51,410 --> 01:53:54,420
and combat power are at their max.

2197
01:53:54,519 --> 01:53:57,290
We're a very hungry team.

2198
01:53:57,589 --> 01:53:58,989
We'll think of the opposing team...

2199
01:53:59,450 --> 01:54:02,218
as a packed lunch and eat them up.

2200
01:54:02,219 --> 01:54:03,830
(We'll eat them up.)

2201
01:54:06,629 --> 01:54:08,200
Team "LALALALA" is a packed lunch.

2202
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:12,670
Gosh, what's that facial expression?

2203
01:54:12,769 --> 01:54:14,170
MINWOOK looks a bit hurt.

2204
01:54:14,700 --> 01:54:16,639
KANG HYUNWOO,

2205
01:54:16,769 --> 01:54:19,070
please share the key points of your team's performance.

2206
01:54:19,439 --> 01:54:21,138
Team "LALALALA" had...

2207
01:54:21,139 --> 01:54:23,579
many members that tried something new.

2208
01:54:23,580 --> 01:54:26,808
YEOJUN became a rapper for the first time.

2209
01:54:26,809 --> 01:54:28,289
(Will the vocalist, JANG YEOJUN rap?)

2210
01:54:28,719 --> 01:54:30,218
What's wrong with me?

2211
01:54:30,219 --> 01:54:31,579
(Training room of Team "LALALALA")

2212
01:54:32,920 --> 01:54:34,320
I forgot again.

2213
01:54:34,420 --> 01:54:38,089
Day and night, I live joyously

2214
01:54:38,360 --> 01:54:41,099
"Wherever the sounds come out,"

2215
01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:44,599
"move and show it. Day and night..."

2216
01:54:45,769 --> 01:54:48,900
To be honest, I've never learned how to rap.

2217
01:54:49,540 --> 01:54:51,539
Since the vocal range for the song was so high,

2218
01:54:51,540 --> 01:54:53,710
I had to be a rapper instead of a vocalist.

2219
01:54:54,280 --> 01:54:56,379
(Dividing up the parts)

2220
01:54:56,679 --> 01:54:58,450
I can't use vocal damping.

2221
01:54:58,809 --> 01:55:01,879
Even this part is too high-pitched for me.

2222
01:55:02,920 --> 01:55:05,320
(Thus, JANG YEOJUN took a rap part.)

2223
01:55:05,420 --> 01:55:07,689
I wasn't familiar with rap,

2224
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:11,490
but I received a very difficult rap part.

2225
01:55:11,629 --> 01:55:14,558
(I'm not picky, so sick Wherever the sounds come out)

2226
01:55:14,559 --> 01:55:19,728
(It's a low-pitched part with a difficult rhythm.)

2227
01:55:19,729 --> 01:55:21,670
(Day and night, I live joyously)

2228
01:55:21,740 --> 01:55:24,070
Day and night, I live joyously

2229
01:55:24,170 --> 01:55:25,669
I live joyously

2230
01:55:25,670 --> 01:55:28,039
I live joyously

2231
01:55:28,040 --> 01:55:30,950
I live joyously

2232
01:55:31,110 --> 01:55:32,609
Day and night

2233
01:55:32,610 --> 01:55:35,518
I think that's why I'm very lost.

2234
01:55:35,519 --> 01:55:37,589
I live... For goodness' sake.

2235
01:55:38,150 --> 01:55:39,150
Gosh.

2236
01:55:39,889 --> 01:55:40,920
How upsetting.

2237
01:55:43,360 --> 01:55:45,989
(He continues to practice rapping at the dorm.)

2238
01:55:45,990 --> 01:55:49,729
Day and night, I live joyously

2239
01:55:50,530 --> 01:55:51,700
TAEYU.

2240
01:55:51,929 --> 01:55:53,769
- Is TAEYU there? - YEOJUN.

2241
01:55:54,439 --> 01:55:56,939
How do I do a low-pitched rap as if I was talking?

2242
01:55:57,139 --> 01:56:00,040
You shouldn't be too mindful of it.

2243
01:56:01,809 --> 01:56:03,808
(A quick lesson on rapping)

2244
01:56:03,809 --> 01:56:05,780
Do it like that.

2245
01:56:06,250 --> 01:56:07,919
I'm not picky, so

2246
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:12,219
(He practices endlessly.)

2247
01:56:12,950 --> 01:56:15,089
Day and night

2248
01:56:15,189 --> 01:56:17,019
I need to hurry up and memorize my part.

2249
01:56:18,490 --> 01:56:21,099
I'm not picky, so sick

2250
01:56:25,629 --> 01:56:28,439
(Next day, at the training room)

2251
01:56:28,639 --> 01:56:30,639
So sick

2252
01:56:30,910 --> 01:56:33,109
- Wherever the sounds come out - It's lower.

2253
01:56:33,110 --> 01:56:34,509
So sick

2254
01:56:35,780 --> 01:56:38,410
(After the lyrics, the key gives him trouble.)

2255
01:56:39,049 --> 01:56:41,219
This is driving me crazy.

2256
01:56:42,349 --> 01:56:44,018
Due to pressure,

2257
01:56:44,019 --> 01:56:47,490
he seemed to be a bit lost. I was worried about that.

2258
01:56:48,160 --> 01:56:50,389
I think you should be more relaxed.

2259
01:56:50,689 --> 01:56:52,688
- More relaxed? - Useless thoughts and worries

2260
01:56:52,689 --> 01:56:55,428
(JEON MINWOOK gives him a rap lesson.)

2261
01:56:55,429 --> 01:56:57,629
Okie dokie, I don't play around

2262
01:56:57,870 --> 01:57:00,029
- Okay. - Put yourself at ease.

2263
01:57:00,030 --> 01:57:01,900
- It shouldn't be rigid. - Okay.

2264
01:57:02,469 --> 01:57:04,838
Useless thoughts and worries, okie dokie

2265
01:57:04,839 --> 01:57:06,869
I don't play around or run away

2266
01:57:06,870 --> 01:57:08,210
- It's much better. - Okay.

2267
01:57:09,139 --> 01:57:10,580
- I think it's nice. - It's good.

2268
01:57:11,750 --> 01:57:14,519
This is the real match. They're the Avengers.

2269
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:18,189
They're different. They have a different vibe.

2270
01:57:18,290 --> 01:57:19,389

2276

2277
01:57:42,639 --> 01:57:44,750
Even if the lyrics are long,

2278
01:57:44,809 --> 01:57:47,750
the main rapper should pull them off.

2279
01:57:48,080 --> 01:57:49,149

2284
01:58:01,929 --> 01:58:06,129
I'm disappointed that he didn't do a single part right.

(SONG SEUNGHO makes a mistake at the same part.)

2286
01:58:18,309 --> 01:58:21,819
As a friend, I was very worried.

2287
01:58:21,820 --> 01:58:23,718
As a member of the opposing team,

2288
01:58:23,719 --> 01:58:26,889
I thought, "It'll be a piece of cake."

2289
01:58:27,150 --> 01:58:28,620
- SEUNGHO. - Yes.

2290
01:58:28,660 --> 01:58:30,688
You started off the song...

2291
01:58:30,689 --> 01:58:32,829
with no energy whatsoever.

2292
01:58:32,830 --> 01:58:34,758
- It messed up the balance. - Okay.

2293
01:58:34,759 --> 01:58:36,298
You need to keep it balanced...

2294
01:58:36,299 --> 01:58:37,429
- with other members. - Yes.

2295
01:58:37,700 --> 01:58:41,069
When you begin, people will go, "What's going on?"

2296
01:58:41,070 --> 01:58:44,508
There's something I want to say to YEOJUN and SEUNGHO.

2297
01:58:44,509 --> 01:58:46,209
It's time to prove yourselves...

2298
01:58:46,210 --> 01:58:51,048
with skills, not potential. I think that'll be very cool.

2299
01:58:51,049 --> 01:58:53,348
And this is a conceptual song.

2300
01:58:53,349 --> 01:58:56,950
So you need to become absorbed and go insane.

2301
01:58:57,219 --> 01:59:00,349
I'm disappointed that there wasn't such a mood.

2302
01:59:00,660 --> 01:59:03,989
Actually, the quality was lacking for a short performance like this.

2303
01:59:03,990 --> 01:59:08,298
It didn't meet my expectations for this team.

2304
01:59:08,299 --> 01:59:09,459
(The quality didn't meet the expectations.)

2305
01:59:09,460 --> 01:59:11,469
I was embarrassed.

2306
01:59:11,500 --> 01:59:13,099
We could've done better.

2307
01:59:14,200 --> 01:59:17,439
In any case, the picked members made up Team White...

2308
01:59:17,509 --> 01:59:19,469
while the remaining members made up Team Black.

2309
01:59:19,610 --> 01:59:22,279
Doing worse than the team of remaining members...

2310
01:59:22,280 --> 01:59:25,580
hurt my pride. I thought it was...

2311
01:59:25,650 --> 01:59:27,379
embarrassing.

2312
01:59:27,479 --> 01:59:29,779
It's time for us to show more.

2313
01:59:29,780 --> 01:59:33,719
Let's work much harder than we did in the past...

2314
01:59:34,860 --> 01:59:36,559
in order to prove ourselves.

2315
01:59:36,620 --> 01:59:38,960
Today, we were negligent.

2316
01:59:39,629 --> 01:59:42,359
If we want to show that we're deserving...

2317
01:59:42,360 --> 01:59:45,298
of our current rankings or higher,

2318
01:59:45,299 --> 01:59:48,000
we need to be ambitious and work as hard as we can.

2319
01:59:48,139 --> 01:59:49,299
Let's not become intimidated.

2320
01:59:50,370 --> 01:59:51,438

2321

2326

I suddenly forgot the lyrics. This is bad.

2327
02:00:08,120 --> 02:00:11,660
I didn't think that SEUNGHO had failed to memorize the lyrics.

2328
02:00:11,990 --> 02:00:15,928
He was the main rapper who needed to sing the first part...

2329
02:00:15,929 --> 02:00:18,598
that was different from his usual rapping style.

2330
02:00:18,599 --> 02:00:19,879
It needed much more intensity...

2331
02:00:20,129 --> 02:00:22,139
and confidence.

2332
02:00:22,870 --> 02:00:26,809
I thought he kept messing up since he was timid and unconfident.

2333
02:00:27,740 --> 02:00:31,379
It was our first time having a group practice, so I became wary.

2334
02:00:32,379 --> 02:00:35,349
Our rival, Team Black was right next to us.

2335
02:00:36,580 --> 02:00:39,689
It made me even warier.

2336
02:00:40,250 --> 02:00:42,389
I kept making a mistake because of that.

2337
02:00:42,990 --> 02:00:45,789
- SEUNGHO, you need more confidence. - Okay.

2338
02:00:45,790 --> 02:00:49,598
You need to go all out so that we can do well.

2339

have an advantage.

2368

I'm sure there's a difference...

It's my goal to debut.

2371
02:02:02,339 --> 02:02:04,508
But older members who debuted in the past...

2372
02:02:04,509 --> 02:02:08,280
might have the goal of gaining popularity.

2373
02:02:09,580 --> 02:02:11,049
We have different goals.

2374
02:02:11,450 --> 02:02:13,650
I'm sure it makes a difference in how desperate we are.

02:08:15,939 --> 02:08:18,178
failing to memorize the choreography...

2447
02:08:18,179 --> 02:08:21,080
is equivalent to failing to memorize the lyrics.

2448
02:08:21,110 --> 02:08:23,378
I hope you take this seriously.

2449
02:08:23,379 --> 02:08:24,589
All right.

2450
02:08:24,820 --> 02:08:29,589
Also, CHANYONG, you were only looking at the ground.

2451
02:08:31,490 --> 02:08:35,229
(He kept looking at the ground.)

2452
02:08:37,129 --> 02:08:39,968
That makes you become less appealing.

2453
02:08:39,969 --> 02:08:41,869
- Okay. - Dance with more confidence.

2454
02:08:41,870 --> 02:08:42,900
All right.

2455
02:08:43,139 --> 02:08:46,309
SIU, your ranking is quite low.

2456
02:08:47,439 --> 02:08:49,110
- CHANYONG also. - Gosh, SIU.

2457
02:08:49,139 --> 02:08:50,479
- You're right. - And CHANYONG.

2458
02:08:51,080 --> 02:08:54,178
To some, this could be a crisis,

2459
02:08:54,179 --> 02:08:58,250
but to others, it could be a chance to jump up in ranking.

2460
02:08:58,320 --> 02:09:00,450
So this Rival Match is really important.

2461
02:09:00,689 --> 02:09:03,588
So I hope you'll take this seriously.

2462
02:09:03,589 --> 02:09:04,759
- Okay. - Okay.

2463
02:09:05,729 --> 02:09:08,159
We have 170,000 points, but to lose 70,000 points?

2464
02:09:08,160 --> 02:09:11,830
That means my points will be halved.

2465
02:09:12,629 --> 02:09:14,329
If we lose 70,000 points,

2466
02:09:14,330 --> 02:09:16,900
it'll be over. That'll be it for me.

2467
02:09:17,099 --> 02:09:21,309
I feel like I was hit in the head to wake up.

2468
02:09:21,679 --> 02:09:24,339
As it's a team mission,

2469
02:09:24,910 --> 02:09:27,580
our team could lose because of my mistake.

2470
02:09:27,879 --> 02:09:31,349
That was the biggest pressure I felt.

2471
02:09:32,450 --> 02:09:33,888
One, two...

2472
02:09:33,889 --> 02:09:37,559
(They resume practicing after the Directors' interim check.)

2473
02:09:37,860 --> 02:09:39,689
Three. "I love you."

2474
02:09:40,129 --> 02:09:42,500
There you go. That's it.

2475
02:09:42,599 --> 02:09:46,899
For those who have memorized the choreography,

2476
02:09:46,900 --> 02:09:48,699
try practicing excitedly.

2477
02:09:48,700 --> 02:09:50,370
- Okay. - Let's sing as well.

2478
02:09:51,769 --> 02:09:54,410
(They dance to the song.)

2479
02:09:56,379 --> 02:09:59,650
(Trainee IM SIU can't catch up.)

2480
02:10:01,250 --> 02:10:02,580
- Yes! - That was good.

2481
02:10:03,280 --> 02:10:04,718
This part is fun.

2482
02:10:04,719 --> 02:10:06,388
- Yes, this part is fun. - Our choreography is fun.

2483
02:10:06,389 --> 02:10:08,258
- It makes you excited. - This part is great.

2484
02:10:08,259 --> 02:10:09,389
It makes us energized.

2485
02:10:09,620 --> 02:10:10,920
This part is fun.

2486
02:10:11,089 --> 02:10:13,088
It's cool. It's exciting.

2487
02:10:13,089 --> 02:10:14,700
I'll go to this side.

2488
02:10:16,229 --> 02:10:18,370
SIHUN, I'm sorry, but could we try it again?

2489
02:10:21,670 --> 02:10:24,870
(But he's still struggling.)

2490
02:10:33,009 --> 02:10:34,849
- Let's move on for now. - Okay.

2491
02:10:35,179 --> 02:10:36,878
I'll keep learning the dance and become familiar with it.

2492
02:10:36,879 --> 02:10:37,920
Great.

2493
02:10:38,089 --> 02:10:40,120
We look at ourselves in the mirror as we practice,

2494
02:10:40,219 --> 02:10:42,689
and I can tell that I'm the only one who is struggling.

2495
02:10:43,290 --> 02:10:45,990
The other members are following quite well,

2496
02:10:46,360 --> 02:10:47,859
but I'm the only one who is falling behind.

2497
02:10:47,860 --> 02:10:50,599
So I got mad at myself.

2498
02:10:52,530 --> 02:10:54,739
(Reviewing the choreography as he listens to the song)

2499
02:10:54,740 --> 02:10:57,040
Your part was nice.

2500
02:10:57,099 --> 02:10:58,610
Oh, for this song?

2501
02:10:59,610 --> 02:11:01,479
It looked the coolest the first time I saw it.

2502
02:11:01,780 --> 02:11:04,678
But it slowly became less cool.

2503
02:11:04,679 --> 02:11:05,949
Oh, right. That's...

2504
02:11:05,950 --> 02:11:08,080
- You're becoming discouraged. - I know. I...

2505
02:11:10,049 --> 02:11:13,019
(Even during the practice just now)

2506
02:11:13,389 --> 02:11:16,290
I'm filled with words I want to tell you, my case

2507
02:11:16,320 --> 02:11:18,759
CHANYONG is really good,

2508
02:11:19,089 --> 02:11:21,160
but he keeps looking at the ground.

2509
02:11:22,330 --> 02:11:24,199
(Trainee PARK CHANYONG got the same feedback again.)

2510
02:11:24,200 --> 02:11:25,330
Still?

2511
02:11:25,769 --> 02:11:28,139
Gosh, I don't know why I feel so intimidated.

2512
02:11:28,670 --> 02:11:31,839
Our team has trainees in 4th and 10th places.

2513
02:11:32,269 --> 02:11:33,969
And I'm the only one who is in 67th place.

2514
02:11:34,139 --> 02:11:36,939
I just kept feeling intimidated by myself.

2515
02:11:39,110 --> 02:11:41,420
Have you given up on debuting?

2516
02:11:42,679 --> 02:11:45,719
- No, I'm not giving up. - That's right.

2517
02:11:46,689 --> 02:11:48,089
But the situation is making me...

2518
02:11:49,320 --> 02:11:51,689
I'm in worse place in terms of our situations.

2519
02:11:51,860 --> 02:11:53,588
Didn't you see MINWOOK fixing my rap part,

2520
02:11:53,589 --> 02:11:55,329
which I can't even pull off?

2521
02:11:55,330 --> 02:11:57,299
I'm third from the bottom, so be quiet.

2522
02:11:58,030 --> 02:12:00,729
That can't console him since you're in sixth place.

2523
02:12:01,700 --> 02:12:02,900
Actually, YEOJUN and I...

2524
02:12:03,170 --> 02:12:06,210
practiced together for over three years.

2525
02:12:06,339 --> 02:12:09,409
So we promised each other to do well...

2526
02:12:09,410 --> 02:12:11,878
and debut together.

2527
02:12:11,879 --> 02:12:15,119
YEOJUN is maintaining a good score by being in sixth place.

2528
02:12:15,120 --> 02:12:19,250
But I'm struggling in 67th place.

2529
02:12:20,049 --> 02:12:22,759
Because I was struggling to survive,

2530
02:12:23,059 --> 02:12:24,388
that made me feel small.

2531
02:12:24,389 --> 02:12:26,530
"Will I really be able to survive in this place?"

2532
02:12:27,330 --> 02:12:29,159
"Is this it for me?"

2533
02:12:29,160 --> 02:12:31,670
That kind of thought was deeply etched in my mind.

2534
02:12:34,370 --> 02:12:37,599
It really broke my heart.

2535
02:12:44,379 --> 02:12:47,079
- Why do I keep getting attracted? - Why do I keep getting attracted?

2536
02:12:47,080 --> 02:12:50,219

2537
02:12:51,150 --> 02:12:52,750

2539

2541
02:13:05,099 --> 02:13:08,400
(But these two keep practicing without taking a break.)

2542
02:13:09,339 --> 02:13:11,969
(Even when his team members are gathered, )

2543
02:13:12,939 --> 02:13:15,580

(he continues to practice.)

2546
02:13:22,549 --> 02:13:24,579
I couldn't memorize the choreography fully,

2547
02:13:24,580 --> 02:13:26,419
so I thought I had no time to rest.

2548
02:13:26,420 --> 02:13:28,189
That's why I kept working hard.

2549
02:13:28,920 --> 02:13:31,058
CHANYONG and SIU are practicing...

2550
02:13:31,059 --> 02:13:34,030
more than how much they should.

2551
02:13:36,429 --> 02:13:39,599
(Even after the other trainees left the training room...)

2552
02:13:41,170 --> 02:13:42,570
Which part are you struggling with?

2553
02:13:43,200 --> 02:13:45,740
I'll help you so that the World Assemblers...

2554
02:13:47,070 --> 02:13:49,009
can only remember you.

2555
02:13:49,679 --> 02:13:50,780
I can sleep on the couch.

2556

2558
02:13:59,219 --> 02:14:02,589
"We must win and win the benefit points."

2559
02:14:02,719 --> 02:14:03,960
I'm really desperate.

2560
02:14:05,330 --> 02:14:07,830
There's a reason we must win,

2561
02:14:07,990 --> 02:14:11,129
so CHANYONG and SIU must pull it off.

2562
02:14:11,460 --> 02:14:13,228
- Let's do it for real now. - Let's do it like crazy.

2563
02:14:13,229 --> 02:14:14,599
- Let's do it like crazy. - Yes!

2564
02:14:16,099 --> 02:14:17,798
- I'll get my energy up. - Let's do this.

02:14:18,910 --> 02:14:20,210
- Yes. - Okay.

2567
02:14:22,139 --> 02:14:23,638
They have the charm of controlling their moves.

2568
02:14:23,639 --> 02:14:24,950
That's right.

02:18:45,570 --> 02:18:47,070
It's somewhat nerve-racking.

2620
02:18:48,309 --> 02:18:49,509

It was a disastrous result.

2626
02:19:00,049 --> 02:19:02,420
At first, I couldn't control my expression.

2627
02:19:03,559 --> 02:19:06,659
CHANYONG was in a rank that could get him eliminated.

2628
02:19:06,660 --> 02:19:09,330
That made me feel bad.

2629
02:19:11,760 --> 02:19:14,770
CHANYONG's name popped up, not mine.

2630
02:19:15,029 --> 02:19:16,600

I lost my precious points,

so the first thing I worried about was whether I'd survive or not.

Our team's performance was the best for me,

I was glad that we won,

2702
02:22:26,889 --> 02:22:28,930

2703
02:22:29,059 --> 02:22:33,369
Because we lost, we might not be able to do the next mission.

I wanted our team to win the benefit points,

that means the other guys who practiced with us...

2710
02:22:52,789 --> 02:22:54,590
would lose something.

2721
02:23:27,389 --> 02:23:29,919
I know. You shouldn't cry more sadly than them.

2722
02:23:29,920 --> 02:23:30,989
CHANYONG would feel more uncomfortable.

2723
02:23:30,990 --> 02:23:32,019
