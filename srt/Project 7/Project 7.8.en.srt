Right, but we lost ours.

174
00:07:22,149 --> 00:07:25,449

will be revealed as well.

184
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:55,779
I'm so curious about that too.

185
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,720
The assembling results will be announced...

186
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,119
after the rankings of all trainees are announced.

187
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,089
So please see how it goes to the end.

188
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,159
And the rankings of the second Passing Ceremony...

189
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,588
will be announced differently from the first Passing Ceremony.

190
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:12,729
Each two teams that competed in Rival Matching...

191
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:13,970
will come up to the platform.

192
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,698
Then in the two teams,

193
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:19,198
candidates for Top Seven and passing trainees...

194
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,240
except for the 35th will be announced.

195
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:23,110
It makes us feel more miserable.

196
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:26,040
If he's the only one who isn't called...

197
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,779
It's so cruel.

198
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,449
Oh, my gosh.

199
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:33,080
After we announce the trainees from 34th to 10th places,

200
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,918
we'll announce the trainee in 35th place...

201
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,258
and the Top Seven candidates last.

202
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:38,460
Goodness.

203
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:40,759
Top Seven? That's awesome.

204
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,189
Even if your name isn't called when you step up,

205
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,059
you could be a candidate for Top Seven...

206
00:08:46,429 --> 00:08:48,000
or in 35th place and pass.

207
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:51,370
All right. Now,

208
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:54,539
PROJECT 7's 2nd Passing Ceremony...

209
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,370
will begin.

210
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,740
Should we clap to this or not?

211
00:09:01,409 --> 00:09:02,480
It's starting.

212
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:05,919
I don't think I can clap in joy.

213
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,889
- This is driving me crazy. - I'm nervous.

214
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,860
(2nd Passing Ceremony)

215
00:09:13,059 --> 00:09:14,889
Before announcing your rankings,

216
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:16,460
Gosh, I'm so nervous.

217
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:20,500
there's a clip that the World Assemblers would enjoy.

218
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,600
- What is it? - What could it be?

219
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,269
I think I know what it is.

220
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,669
Hold on. No.

221
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,039
They can't show MINSEO.

222
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,240
No!

223
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:30,740
It'll be revealed now.

224
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,508
- What? - What is it?

225
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:36,049
What on earth is it?

226
00:09:37,049 --> 00:09:39,750
(It's been three months since they came to Project Village.)

227
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:42,649
(A room for sharing how the trainees actually feel is open.)

228
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,889
(They're reacting fervently at the room.)

229
00:09:45,289 --> 00:09:46,620
It's that one.

230
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,090
Gosh, what?

231
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:50,730
That can't be revealed.

232
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:52,029
They can't show it.

233
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,629
(Why is everyone saying they can't be shown?)

234
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,799
"Tell us how you truly feel."

235
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,940
"Ask the following questions to each other."

236
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,399
"Answer the questions as honestly as possible."

237
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:03,570
It was a set where we couldn't help but share our true feelings.

238
00:10:03,809 --> 00:10:06,178
"When was the moment you wanted to give up the most..."

239
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:10,110
"or run away the most while you were on PROJECT 7?"

240
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,519
When I was assigned to the Shadow Zone.

241
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:14,220
No! P2!

242
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:18,959
(P2 was assigned to the Shadow Zone.)

243
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,230
I really felt...

244
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:23,059
that everything was over.

245
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:26,299
I was...

246
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,899
I was really craving ice cream.

247
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:32,970
Come on, YOUNGSEO.

248
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:36,039
The hardest time for him was when he couldn't have ice cream.

249
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,308
YOUNGSEO.

250
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:39,479
I'll get one for you.

251
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,278
- Let's eat it when we're done. - I was...

252
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,408
YOUNGSEO is cute.

253
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:44,178
I was really craving something sweet like a cake.

254
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:46,349
I thought, "I want to go to a cafe right now."

255
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,350
I'll buy it for you when we're done with the show.

256
00:10:47,351 --> 00:10:48,850
Gosh! Hello.

257
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,990
- What? Where did he go? - What happened?

258
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:54,128
I thought, "I want to go to a cafe right now."

259
00:10:54,129 --> 00:10:55,189
I'll buy it for you when we're done with the show.

260
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,690
Gosh! Hello.

261
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:00,159
(What on earth happened?)

262
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,129
- What's going on? - What's going on?

263
00:11:02,299 --> 00:11:03,699
- YOUNGSEO. - He flew away.

264
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,840
- YOUNGSEO. - YOUNGSEO is gone.

265
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:07,969
I thought, "I want to go to a cafe right now."

266
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,439
(A ghost is watching them?)

267
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,110
Look at that. How can you not be scared after seeing that?

268
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:14,709
(Actually, this is a haunted room.)

269
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,110
It was so scary.

270
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,219
Gosh, it's scary even after knowing its existence.

271
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,919
What? It's so scary.

272
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,620
(He saw the ghost.)

273
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:25,690
Gosh!

274
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:29,929
Look at TAEYU.

275
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:31,500
TAEYU.

276
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,959
(After TAEYU was surprised, everyone else was.)

277
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,069
YOUNGSEO. Gosh, YOUNGSEO.

278
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,870
You...

279
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:41,240
(They were so scared to see the ghost.)

280
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:42,339
(Elk ANDY with a loud voice)

281
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,409
What? Who is that?

282
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:48,179
ANDY is so cute.

283
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:50,580
I was scared too.

284
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:51,879
Are you okay, YOUNGSEO?

285
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:53,349
It's scary even though I know.

286
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,519
- Oh, gosh. - That's right. It was so scary.

287
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,719
- Performing on stage... - Goodness.

288
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,259
and practicing together...

289
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,989
- He's going to fly away. - I think nothing can scare me now.

290
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,859
He said nothing would scare him now.

291
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,960
I think I grew a lot.

292
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:06,330
Let's see.

293
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,970
(Total chaos)

294
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:13,570
(Shaking)

295
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:15,710
(His words don't match his actions.)

296
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:17,308
(Shaking after what he said)

297
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:18,739
Gosh, SEUNGWON.

298
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,940
(Shaking after what he said)

299
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,549
(Meanwhile)

300
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,049
Where are you going, EUNSUH?

301
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:27,690
I was really scared then.

302
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:30,990
(The ghost in the corridor was waiting for the trainees.)

303
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:34,129
(He returns after seeing the ghost in the corridor.)

304
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:38,299
(Witnessing the scaredy-cats as a group)

305
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,830
(Embarrassed)

306
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,500
(Falling)

307
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,269
They're so cute.

308
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,370
"When was the moment..."

309
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,939
"you wanted to give up the most..."

310
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,379
- Hello. - Gosh.

311
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,849
Gosh, YOUNGWOONG. You're amazing.

312
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,609
YOUNGWOONG! You're so manly.

313
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,820
He's a hero.

314
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,849
This is what you call a rock spirit.

315
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,619
- "When was the moment..." - Hello.

316
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,019
"Or..."

317
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,729
(JUNWOO runs away the fastest.)

318
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:10,929
- What? - He left.

319
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:13,628
- I hate it! - Isn't he a taekwondo dan holder?

320
00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:15,700
I was so scared.

321
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:17,369
- I was so scared. - I hate it.

322
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,799
(They come outside to check on JUNWOO.)

323
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,309
(Screaming)

324
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,079
HYOJIN.

325
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,179
(The scaredy-cat wants to hide.)

326
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,809
- You... - Oh, no.

327
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:31,179
(Rolling)

328
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,350
His legs totally gave way.

329
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,288
Gosh, HYOJIN.

330
00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:35,489
(Save me!)

331
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:36,549
Hey!

332
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,689
She stayed in character...

333
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:38,919
- until the end. - I hate this.

334
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,490
It's still scary for me.

335
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,860
Actually, the directors...

336
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,699
(Shocked)

337
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,729
Hey!

338
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,899
- Marine Corps! What was that? - Marine Corps!

339
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:53,298
What was that, Marine Corps?

340
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:54,809
Don't Marine Corps soldiers even catch ghosts?

341
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:55,870
What was that?

342
00:13:57,409 --> 00:13:58,609
Where are you going, JUYOUNG?

343
00:13:58,610 --> 00:13:59,779
(He tried to escape by himself.)

344
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:01,879
JUYOUNG.

345
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:03,679
Gosh!

346
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:09,819
Who was that?

347
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,360
(It was me.)

348
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,419
(He failed to escape.)

349
00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:18,100
He's such a baby.

350
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:20,529
Gosh, it's crazy.

351
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:22,970
It was so scary.

352
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,669
Hey. Wait.

353
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,638
- Gosh. - What is it?

354
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:28,769
I feel anxious.

355
00:14:29,009 --> 00:14:30,009
You are?

356
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:32,480
XIANG can sense it.

357
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:34,779
Gosh, he's experienced.

358
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:38,179
(With his sense, he ran away faster than anyone.)

359
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,620
(Rolling)

360
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,720
Come on, YECHAN.

361
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,759
Gosh, I didn't expect that from a rapper.

362
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:50,489
- Gosh. - Gosh.

363
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,459
- What is it? - Gosh!

364
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,000
I hate this!

365
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,529
JTBC!

366
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,240
I won't go out.

367
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,039
I really won't go out.

368
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,309
- I hate this so much! - Come here. We have to go.

369
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,179
(His scream resonates in the corridor.)

370
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:08,710
What is it?

371
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:10,950
XIANG.

372
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:15,320
- Gosh, it's scary. - What is it?

373
00:15:15,419 --> 00:15:16,490
Why?

374
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,319
Are you sure you're a rapper?

375
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,389
(Are you sure this is what a rapper looks like?)

376
00:15:19,789 --> 00:15:20,990
YECHAN, it's okay.

377
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:22,830
Who is it?

378
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:23,830
(He forgets about hip-hop.)

379
00:15:23,831 --> 00:15:24,899
She's coming!

380
00:15:27,929 --> 00:15:28,970
This is crazy.

381
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:32,169
- Gosh, YEOM YECHAN. - Why is YECHAN so funny?

382
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:34,939
It's already...

383
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,169
(Thud)

384
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,048
- What's with him? - HYUNJAE.

385
00:15:42,049 --> 00:15:43,148
(What's with this guy?)

386
00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:44,850
What's with HYUNJAE?

387
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:46,019
What's with you?

388
00:15:46,049 --> 00:15:47,789
- It's... Gosh, it scared me. - No way.

389
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,419
What is that?

390
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,519
- What's with KIM HYUNJAE? - Gosh, he's legendary.

391
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,990
Who are you?

392
00:15:55,059 --> 00:15:56,159
Hello.

393
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:57,999
No way.

394
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,529
- I didn't know that was possible. - Isn't HYUNJAE the ghost?

395
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,129
(You guys should just come out.)

396
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,440
She wants us to come out.

397
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:06,940
What was that?

398
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:09,610
(This is the horror interview of the manly men.)

399
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,409
Whenever I see a music video...

400
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,110
I always work hard by myself.

401
00:16:14,409 --> 00:16:15,750
- He saw her. - What was that?

402
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,179
What's going on?

403
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,090
What?

404
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,018
(He runs at lightning speed...)

405
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:24,919
(and grabs the name tag.)

406
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:27,460
That's so funny.

407
00:16:30,929 --> 00:16:33,299
I knew she was here, but it was still scary.

408
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:36,169
(Only the strings remain on him.)

409
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,440
(Here's your name tag.)

410
00:16:38,669 --> 00:16:41,570
(They can't believe it.)

411
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:43,539
It was like you were on "Running Man."

412
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,409
It was like you were on "Running Man."

413
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,149
Hey.

414
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,509
(WOO HAJOON is out.)

415
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,120
What do I do with this?

416
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,120
(Screaming)

417
00:16:53,419 --> 00:16:54,419
He's cute.

418
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:58,820
Get out!

419
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:01,460
"Get out!"

420
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:03,590
ATILLA is crazy funny.

421
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:10,500
(Upon seeing the ghost's face that came close boldly...)

422
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:14,509
(Don't come near us.)

423
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:20,009
(The victim was really scared.)

424
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:21,779
(And the witness.)

425
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,619
(Scared a 2nd time by the staff)

426
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,749
(JIWOON and TAEHWAN are just amused by this situation.)

427
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,660
How can they laugh like that in that situation?

428
00:17:34,089 --> 00:17:35,359
How is that possible?

429
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:36,890
(Crashing)

430
00:17:36,891 --> 00:17:37,930
That scared me.

431
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,259
(This time, the ghost appeared from in front.)

432
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,970
(YONGHYUN defends the members.)

433
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,909
- That scared me. - Oh, my.

434
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,209
- He's cool. - He's cool.

435
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:50,338
He's cool.

436
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:51,480
(Reliable)

437
00:17:53,309 --> 00:17:54,548
(He even blocked a surprise attack right away.)

438
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:55,910
I should've done that too.

439
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:00,349
(And in front of YOUNGHYUN...)

440
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:02,549
(Are you okay?)

441
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:05,660
(Sweet GUNWOO was also there.)

442
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:07,660
Gentlemen.

443
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:09,059
How sweet.

444
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,430
Why are they so heart-warming?

445
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,660
I don't think they should show me.

446
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:17,699
(His video is being shown.)

447
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,039
Oh, no.

448
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,710
(Flinching)

449
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,269
(Scared to death)

450
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,508
- Look at MINWOOK. - MINWOOK.

451
00:18:26,509 --> 00:18:27,849
Come on, JEON MINWOOK.

452
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,348
(Shaking his head)

453
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:30,880
- Oh, JEON MINWOOK. - MINWOOK!

454
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,079
(While YEOJUN, the second oldest, took care of the young member)

455
00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:36,819
He ran away before anyone else.

456
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,619
He ran away before anyone else.

457
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,118
(Deeply ashamed)

458
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,730
- Oh, JEON MINWOOK. - MINWOOK!

459
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:45,900
- Come on. - What was that?

460
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,269
We should go out.

461
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,029
- How cute. - MINWOOK.

462
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,740
- Let's go. - What is this?

463
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,439
Hold on.

464
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,838
- I'm scared. - Hold on.

465
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:58,039
- Hold on. - Let's put SEYUN in front.

466
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,750
How could you put SEYUN in the front?

467
00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:04,008
I'm scared.

468
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:05,220
I'm scared too.

469
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,250
SEYUN has stopped talking to MINWOOK since then.

470
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,960
He has stopped talking to MINWOOK since then.

471
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,588
"PROJECT 7..."

472
00:19:15,589 --> 00:19:17,088
- It's us. - Let's go.

473
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:18,230
- Oh, no. - Let's go.

474
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,558
Oh, it's LEE HANBIN.

475
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,669
There he is.

476
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:22,670
I didn't get scared.

477
00:19:22,671 --> 00:19:23,700
(He confidently claimed, "I didn't get scared.")

478
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,500
"Next..."

479
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:28,440
(But there wasn't a single person who didn't get scared.)

480
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:29,838
"Next..."

481
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:31,740
(Eyes, nose, and mouth all opening to their maximum sizes)

482
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,109
Oh, my. You're something else.

483
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:40,319
(His whole body is shaking.)

484
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:43,849
(Behind him, someone is crying like a crow.)

485
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,420
(It's a total mess.)

486
00:19:46,589 --> 00:19:48,589
Come on. What is this?

487
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,229
It was so scary.

488
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:53,660
(It was so scary.)

489
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,499
Oh, my goodness!

490
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,528
(The ghost returns very satisfied.)

491
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:58,640
Oh, my goodness!

492
00:20:00,869 --> 00:20:02,369
Who's behind the refrigerator?

493
00:20:02,609 --> 00:20:03,609
Me.

494
00:20:04,339 --> 00:20:05,838
Me.

495
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:06,839
(The crying crow in the back was HANBIN.)

496
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:08,480
HANBIN is crying.

497
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,179
- Oh, that was so scary. - He's crying?

498
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,318
- HANBIN is crying. - I wasn't crying.

499
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:13,079
What was that?

500
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,690
Come on!

501
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,118
- Come on! - Come on!

502
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:17,649
No!

503
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:18,818
I didn't cry!

504
00:20:18,819 --> 00:20:20,390
Hey, LEE HANBIN.

505
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,389
What's this? Hold on.

506
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,430
(Panicking a 2nd time in the hall on their way out)

507
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,230
(Screaming)

508
00:20:26,231 --> 00:20:27,430
Seriously, stop it!

509
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:29,670
What?

510
00:20:29,671 --> 00:20:31,029
(Popping out)

511
00:20:31,339 --> 00:20:32,439
He's running away.

512
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,940
(Leaving his team members behind and running away)

513
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:36,139
(They escape one by one.)

514
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,838
Seriously, go away!

515
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:39,009
Seriously, stop it.

516
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,649
No!

517
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,119
No!

518
00:20:45,349 --> 00:20:47,380
I didn't know HANBIN’s voice could sound like that.

519
00:20:50,819 --> 00:20:52,318
Go away!

520
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:53,519
(A clear and beautiful voice that calls the ghost)

521
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,400
Seriously, stop it.

522
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,430
Wait for me!

523
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:02,099
Hey!

524
00:21:02,369 --> 00:21:04,529
Hold on!

525
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,239
I'm sorry. It's not that.

526
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,869
Seriously, hold on.

527
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,240
Wait for me.

528
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:12,839
My throat hurts.

529
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,109
How could you leave me behind?

530
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,278
(On guard)

531
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:20,318
Stop it!

532
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:22,818
Stop it! Turn it off.

533
00:21:22,819 --> 00:21:24,249
- Stop it! - So, just now,

534
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,259
I was... Oh, my!

535
00:21:25,289 --> 00:21:27,519
(Getting scared at even small noises)

536
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:28,789
What was that?

537
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:32,130
Hey, that was too much.

538
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:34,969
This is legendary.

539
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,069
It really wasn't like that.

540
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,569
This isn't it.

541
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,339
- I'm scared. - HANBIN.

542
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,239
- Hello. - Why was it SVIAT of all people?

543
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,240
I'm here with SVIAT today.

544
00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:47,308
Actually, I was so surprised...

545
00:21:47,309 --> 00:21:49,250
(Banging)

546
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,380
Seriously, stop it.

547
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,990
That was me.

548
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,420
Both of them.

549
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,619
Hold on. Someone is going to pop out.

550
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,229
- I just got a feeling. - Someone is here, right?

551
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,358
I seriously can't.

552
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:06,959
- I seriously can't. - Open the refrigerator.

553
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,000
- Hold on. - Hold on.

554
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,528
Hold on.

555
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:12,038
You're such a big guy...

556
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,539
I'm going into the refrigerator.

557
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:16,108
I really can't do this.

558
00:22:16,109 --> 00:22:17,569
Should we just try opening it?

559
00:22:18,309 --> 00:22:19,779
You can't fit in there.

560
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,180
What is he doing?

561
00:22:21,579 --> 00:22:24,180
It's not, right? Seriously, don't do it.

562
00:22:25,349 --> 00:22:26,750
I'm afraid of people.

563
00:22:27,549 --> 00:22:30,019
You must escape this room starting now.

564
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,960
Seriously.

565
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,759
Why are we here?

566
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:36,788
"Tell us your true feelings."

567
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:38,230
(Linking arms)

568
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:40,430
MINSEO. Weren't you a true man?

569
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,829
What's wrong with you two?

570
00:22:47,869 --> 00:22:50,539
(Scared out of their minds)

571
00:22:54,509 --> 00:22:55,979
Why are you doing this?

572
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,180
(Ghosts appearing from the front and the back)

573
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,619
Seriously.

574
00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:02,950
Why are you doing this?

575
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:04,549
Seriously, don't do that.

576
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:06,490
- But... - What did I just see?

577
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,789
Why did you pass out?

578
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:12,500
Come on.

579
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:16,098
JUNSEO. Hold onto this.

580
00:23:16,099 --> 00:23:17,200
It's here.

581
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,940
- Are you holding the door? - Yes.

582
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,039
He's hanging on the door.

583
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:24,508
What about our sincere talk?

584
00:23:24,509 --> 00:23:27,740
- I have a happy moment... - I knew it.

585
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,509
- I have a happy moment. - He's disappointed.

586
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,548
- JUNSEO is disappointed. - I have a happy moment.

587
00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:34,619
It's outside. I really can't do this.

588
00:23:35,019 --> 00:23:36,749
(They have to go out now.)

589
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,219
Don't do it.

590
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,259
Let's go. Hurry.

591
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:41,890
Come on, MINSEO.

592
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,359
That wasn't me.

593
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,130
- Seriously. - MINSEO.

594
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,400
Did you cry?

595
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,129
Hold me.

596
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,599
KANG MINSEO.

597
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,569
KANG MINSEO.

598
00:23:53,069 --> 00:23:54,670
You're really crying.

599
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:56,768
Oh, gosh.

600
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:58,240
(The four scaredy cats pass while wiping away their tears.)

601
00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:00,180
So mean.

602
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:01,848
Oh, my gosh.

603
00:24:01,849 --> 00:24:04,920
(The ghost slowly crawls out.)

604
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:07,920
- But... - Let's see.

605
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,660
(Kicking their chair back)

606
00:24:18,329 --> 00:24:19,599
(Arms flailing)

607
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,440
Were HYUNGSEOK's high notes always that good?

608
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:30,769
(Blocking the ghost with his chair)

609
00:24:31,579 --> 00:24:33,680
(Creating a defense wall with their chairs)

610
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:37,048
(Screaming)

611
00:24:37,049 --> 00:24:38,349
Oh, my gosh.

612
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:40,618
This is so funny.

613
00:24:40,619 --> 00:24:42,019
(The only place they can hide is behind their chairs.)

614
00:24:44,819 --> 00:24:45,819
Seriously.

615
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:47,618
We have to go.

616
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,559
- Let's go. - Let's go.

617
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:50,630
- Hold on. - Oh, seriously...

618
00:24:50,631 --> 00:24:52,859
- Let's hold hands. - I'm so scared.

619
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,999
Let's go.

620
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,268
I'm so scared.

621
00:24:55,269 --> 00:24:57,199
- Run - Run

622
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,740
- I run to you - I run to you

623
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,140
(Screaming)

624
00:25:00,141 --> 00:25:01,400
They love "Up To You."

625
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,578
Oh, my gosh!

626
00:25:05,579 --> 00:25:07,640
(The chaotic horror interviews are over.)

627
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,549
That was fun.

628
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,480
That was fun.

629
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,149
I wasn't that bad.

630
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,849
Something went wrong.

631
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:18,190
I was just acting.

632
00:25:18,819 --> 00:25:20,220
HANBIN was legendary.

633
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,390
- Don't act serious from now on. - It's not like that.

634
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,899
It's not like that.

635
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,960
(He has said "It's not like that" dozens of times just today.)

636
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,599
We will now begin...

637
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:30,299
the second Passing Ceremony.

638
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,069
This is the really scary part.

639
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:35,769
This is the really scary part.

640
00:25:38,309 --> 00:25:40,608
The first team we will announce the results for...

641
00:25:40,609 --> 00:25:42,480
is A1, who performed...

642
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,980
to RIIZE's songs.

643
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,150
Right away?

644
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,450
- From A1. - Nice.

645
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:52,490
All A1 members, please come up to the platform.

646
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:56,429
Let's go. You can do it.

647
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,430
- We'll be back. - Let's go.

648
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,559
Oh, my gosh.

649
00:26:00,329 --> 00:26:02,129
- Hey. This really isn't it. - What?

650
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,269
You can do it!

651
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,339
- You can do it. - Being called made me nervous.

652
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:07,940
Please all go up and don't come back down.

653
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,240
Just leave a spot for me.

654
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,410
A1 completed with RIIZE's songs.

655
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,210
Team "Boom Boom Bass" expressed an understated sexiness well.

656
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,890
Team "Memories" was very clean and fresh.

657
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:26,089
Out of the two teams in the RIIZE match,

658
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:29,288
Team "Boom Boom Bass" won by a small margin...

659
00:26:29,289 --> 00:26:32,559
- of just 20 votes. - Oh, my.

660
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:35,000
- Just 20 votes? - Just 20 votes...

661
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,029
That was so close. Just 20 votes.

662
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:41,299
Whose destiny will change by this result?

663
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,640
I'm more nervous.

664
00:26:47,509 --> 00:26:48,578
Please.

665
00:26:48,579 --> 00:26:49,950
From Team RIIZE,

666
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:54,819
I will announce the members who passed...

667
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,259
with the exception of the 35th place and those in the Top 7.

668
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:02,089
The first ranking I will announce...

669
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:04,289
is the 23rd place.

670
00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:06,999
(The 2nd Passing Ceremony, 23rd place)

671
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,869
The 23rd place.

672
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,140
- YONGHYUN? - YONGHYUN.

673
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,569
YONGHYUN got 20th place last time.

674
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,440
I think it'll be JOOHYUN.

675
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:23,049
I think JIAHN will survive.

676
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:24,950
HEEJU's ranking rose a lot too.

677
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:30,450
This trainee's eyes are always sparkling.

678
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:33,559
This trainee's eyes are always sparkling.

679
00:27:33,589 --> 00:27:34,619
Isn't that me?

680
00:27:35,089 --> 00:27:36,429
- Well... - Isn't that me?

681
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:37,630
It's YONGHYUN.

682
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,000
- YONGHYUN. - YONGHYUN.

683
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,430
He has pretty eyes.

684
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:47,099
He also takes good care of each of the members.

685
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,170
JIAHN is caring too.

686
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:51,369
I think it will be JIAHN.

687
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,578
- JIAHN or YONGHYUN. - You're right.

688
00:27:53,579 --> 00:27:54,980
- JIAHN. - One of the two.

689
00:27:55,809 --> 00:27:56,809
Is it YONGHYUN?

690
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,579
It could be JIAHN.

691
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:00,819
This trainee...

692
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,489
received a global voting score...

693
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:04,589
How many points?

694
00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:06,160
They received...

695
00:28:08,259 --> 00:28:11,389
a total of 792,843 points.

696
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,130
(Global voting score, 792,843 points)

697
00:28:13,829 --> 00:28:15,069
Trainee KWON YONGHYUN.

698
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,730
Congratulations.

699
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,069
Congratulations.

700
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,240
Congratulations.

701
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:23,740
The first one to pass today.

702
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:28,849
Not only did trainee KWON YONGHYUN win at Rival Matching...

703
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,379
with his stable vocals,

704
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,519
he got 1st place in the Individual Vote...

705
00:28:32,819 --> 00:28:35,889
and succeeded in taking 70,000 points...

706
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:37,349
of the global voting score away from trainees...

707
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:40,689
KIM DOHUN and BAEK JIHO on the opposing team.

708
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:42,390
(KWON YONGHYUN, 23rd place, 792,843 points including benefits)

709
00:28:42,529 --> 00:28:44,559
I knew YONGHYUN would pass.

710
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:46,460
He's my friend.

711
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,769
My real friend.

712
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,299
The next ranking I'll announce...

713
00:28:52,339 --> 00:28:54,799
is the 28th-place trainee.

714
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,609
- They're five rankings apart. - Right.

715
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,140
The 28th place.

716
00:28:59,609 --> 00:29:01,279
To give you some hints,

717
00:29:01,609 --> 00:29:04,508
he's one of the trainees who melted the hearts...

718
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:06,249
of the World Assemblers with his pure smile.

719
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:07,519
- KOTARO. - KOTARO.

720
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,548
- KOTARO. - It's KOTARO or JOOHYUN.

721
00:29:09,549 --> 00:29:10,788
- JOOHYUN? - Me?

722
00:29:10,789 --> 00:29:12,490
Right. There's JOOHYUN too.

723
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:13,818
(Shooting a pure smile at them)

724
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:15,019
Maybe not.

725
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,230
- HEEJU, please. - Isn't it HEEJU?

726
00:29:20,829 --> 00:29:22,068
Isn't this JIHO?

727
00:29:22,069 --> 00:29:24,000
(BAEK JIHO, 70th place at week 5)

728

(PARK JUNWOO, 51st place at week 5)

730
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,670
And this trainee...

731
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,470
tried out...

732
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,440
to be the center...

733
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,848
for the Rival Matching.

734
00:29:35,849 --> 00:29:36,950
(Hint 2, A trainee that tried out to be the center for Rival Matching)

735
00:29:37,741 --> 00:29:39,220
A trainee that tried out to be the center, he said.

736
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,950
- KOTARO. - You tried out too.

737
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,390
- I don't know. - It's one of the two.

738
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:48,359
He received a global voting score...

739
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:52,900
of 483,736 points.

740
00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:54,630
There's a 300,000-point difference when they're just 5 rankings apart?

741
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,400
That's unbelievable.

742
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,869
That's a big difference.

743
00:29:58,539 --> 00:30:00,470
They'll finally call my name now.

744
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,940
I think I was very nervous.

It's KOTARO?

751
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:16,018
KOTARO went up a lot.

752
00:30:16,019 --> 00:30:17,220
Oh, my.

00:30:20,259 --> 00:30:23,089
ended up at 36th place, outside of the surviving ranks,

755
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:25,258
after the first Passing Ceremony.

756
00:30:25,259 --> 00:30:27,558
He showed how sincerely he wanted to survive...

757
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,329
by trying out for the center part twice.

758
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:31,368

00:30:31,369 --> 00:30:33,769
40,000 benefit points from trainee KIM HYUNJAE,

760
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:37,109

He went up from 36th place to 28th place.

765
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,589

(The 29th place is trainee KIM JOOHYUN.)

785
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,469
That's right. At least one person from Team "Memories" should survive.

(Team "Memories'" first survivor, trainee KIM JOOHYUN)

787

We have three survivors from A1 so far.

796
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:08,000
Will there be more survivors from A1?

797
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:09,868
I had predicted...

798
00:32:09,869 --> 00:32:11,230
about that much.

799
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,599
There has to be.

801

Honestly.

824
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:12,159
But the benefit points...

825
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,660
- Right. - It could be tough.

00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,849
Oh, my.

906
00:36:21,019 --> 00:36:23,590
Sadly, because his team lost at the Rival Matching,

907
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:26,760
he lost 20,000 points of the global voting score...

908
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,460
to trainee SONG HYUNGSEOK.

909
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,729
Despite his points being deducted,

910
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:33,760
he survived the second Passing Ceremony.

911
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,899
Congratulations.

912
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,099
(LEE GUNWOO, 32nd place, 456,922 points including benefits)

913
00:36:42,969 --> 00:36:45,879
I will continue on with the announcements.

914
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,179
This trainee...

915
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:49,750
Oh, my.

916
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:52,679
The last one?

917
00:36:53,179 --> 00:36:54,480
From A1...

918
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,949
The last one.

919
00:36:58,119 --> 00:36:59,719
This will be the last survivor.

920
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,789
This will be the last survivor.

921
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:05,860
This could really be my last day.

922
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:10,230
I thought my chances weren't great.

923
00:37:10,699 --> 00:37:13,670
The ranking of the trainee that I will announce now...

924
00:37:13,699 --> 00:37:15,638
is 33rd place.

925
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:16,769
(The 2nd Passing Ceremony, 33rd place)

926
00:37:17,269 --> 00:37:20,210
So we have the 31st, 32nd, and the 33rd place now.

927
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,650
Oh, gosh.

928
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,920
My gosh, the competition is fierce for A1.

929
00:37:27,019 --> 00:37:29,619
Okay. Let me give you some hints. When this trainee smiles,

930
00:37:29,889 --> 00:37:31,389
a corner of his mouth...

931
00:37:32,889 --> 00:37:35,488
curves up. And that's his charming feature.

932
00:37:35,489 --> 00:37:36,489
(KIM HYUNJAE ranked 31st on the 5th week.)

933
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:37,559
How do you do that?

934
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,730
- JUNWOO smiles like that too. - Yes.

935
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:42,769
(PARK JUNWOO ranked 51st on the 5th week.)

936
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,669
He's doing that even now.

937
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:45,670
(YU JIAHN ranked 31st on the 6th week.)

938
00:37:45,671 --> 00:37:46,839
Is it ADAM?

939
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,599
(AYALON ADAM ranked 66th on the 5th week.)

940
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:51,138
And this trainee went through many hardships...

941
00:37:51,139 --> 00:37:53,610
while practicing for the Rival Matching.

942
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,509
I'm not sure who it is now. I don't know.

943
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,849
This trainee received...

944
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:04,349
a global voting score of 455,473 points.

945
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:06,460
SEOKHEE.

946
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,619
Let's go. That's my daddy.

947
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,499
It's Trainee YU JIAHN.

948
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,198
(33rd, Trainee YU JIAHN)

949
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:19,599
Congratulations. It's Trainee YU JIAHN.

950
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,570
Congratulations.

951
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:27,238
- Thank you. - His center position was...

952
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:29,009
- Well done. - at risk several times.

953
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:31,909
But he kept the center position with his solid skills.

954
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:35,319
He won the Rival Matching...

955
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,488
and took 60,000 points from his opponents.

956
00:38:37,489 --> 00:38:38,519
(He obtained 60,000 points from KIM DOHUN and BAEK JIHO.)

957
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:42,289
Without the benefit, Trainee YU JIAHN's journey...

958
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:45,659
could have ended today.

959
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:51,599
They can't be all that relieved to be standing there...

960
00:38:51,699 --> 00:38:52,868
though they passed.

961
00:38:52,869 --> 00:38:53,869
Right. They're forced to...

962
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:55,000
- face their teammates. - Yes.

963
00:38:56,309 --> 00:38:58,139
It's heartbreaking that they have to face each other.

964
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,610
The truth is...

965
00:39:02,809 --> 00:39:05,719
before I decided to join this journey on PROJECT 7,

966
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,820
I wondered if I was going after a pipe dream.

967
00:39:09,019 --> 00:39:11,219
That made me hesitate.

968
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:13,559
As the show progressed...

969
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:18,730
and as I spent more time with other trainees,

970
00:39:19,429 --> 00:39:23,869
I thought that I was glad I decided to try out for the show.

971
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:27,400
As I'm grateful that I passed,

972
00:39:27,739 --> 00:39:32,909
I will work harder to show you a better performance...

973
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,349
next time. Thank you.

974
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,150
JIAHN is so cool.

975
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:45,419
I know that everyone who competed in the RIIZE match...

976
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,518
worked so hard.

977
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:48,119
Team "Memories" especially...

978
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:52,530
Are you crying?

979
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,639
I want to cry for them.

980
00:40:05,139 --> 00:40:06,679
I think I might cry too.

981
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:12,820
I have no doubt that we will meet again.

982
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:16,119
I hope everyone will keep trying out for their dream...

983
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:19,159
in the best way they can.

984
00:40:19,659 --> 00:40:20,789
Thank you.

985
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:28,530
Trainee HA SEOKHEE hasn't been called yet.

986
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:32,869
If there's anything you want to say to him, go ahead.

987
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:37,170
Let's stop.

988
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:41,239
What am I going to do with their love story?

989
00:40:42,179 --> 00:40:43,449
The new love-hate relationship.

990
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:45,610
Aren't they dating?

991
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,388
SEOKHEE has a shot to make it...

992
00:40:50,389 --> 00:40:52,789
into the top 7, rather than being ranked 35th.

993
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,889
How will he take responsibility for that later?

994
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,489
I'm sorry. I had nothing to do with that.

995
00:40:58,630 --> 00:40:59,960
I had nothing to do with that.

996
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,769
I have no doubt...

997
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,199
SEOKHEE will advance.

998
00:41:10,539 --> 00:41:11,969
Yes, SEOKHEE ought to.

999
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,440
SEOKHEE can't get eliminated.

1000
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:19,078
I truly hoped that...

1001
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:20,849
everyone in A1 would survive together.

1002
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:24,249
But standing on two different sides like this...

1003
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:26,019
doesn't feel good.

1004
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,760
And all of us worked really hard.

1005
00:41:30,659 --> 00:41:31,829
I'd like to say you did an amazing job...

1006
00:41:31,929 --> 00:41:33,800
and thank you for doing this together.

1007
00:41:34,329 --> 00:41:35,429
JUNWOO, don't cry.

1008
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:37,900
I wish you could smile instead.

1009
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,639
Thank you, JUNWOO.

1010
00:41:40,869 --> 00:41:44,638
Thank you for giving me...

1011
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:46,010
a good ranking.

1012
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:48,408
I will work hard to match this ranking...

1013
00:41:48,409 --> 00:41:49,809
and advance to the final round.

1014
00:41:50,409 --> 00:41:53,320
I was able to move my ranking up...

1015
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:57,420
from 36th place to 28th place.

1016
00:41:57,690 --> 00:42:00,518
I would like to thank World Assemblers...

1017
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:02,159
who voted for me to make this happen.

1018
00:42:02,489 --> 00:42:04,460
I'll work hard. Thank you.

1019
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:09,929
It's been seven years since my debut.

1020
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:14,800
I think I made a proper appearance on TV for the first time.

1021
00:42:15,639 --> 00:42:16,809
There were...

1022
00:42:27,179 --> 00:42:30,649
There were many incidents that almost made me want to...

1023
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:34,090
give up on my dream of becoming an idol star.

1024
00:42:34,789 --> 00:42:37,129
But because I didn't give up and kept trying,

1025
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:40,260
I had this great chance to be on PROJECT 7.

1026
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:44,670
So I would like to tell all 70 trainees here...

1027
00:42:45,369 --> 00:42:47,539
not to give up even when things get tough.

1028
00:42:47,869 --> 00:42:49,840
I hope you will keep going after your dream...

1029
00:42:49,909 --> 00:42:51,710
and that one day, your dream will come true.

1030
00:42:51,909 --> 00:42:52,940
Thank you.

1031
00:42:58,210 --> 00:42:59,210
He's like a dad.

1032
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,788
All right. The trainees whose names were not called...

1033
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:05,649
have a shot at making it to the top 7...

1034
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:07,420
or being ranked 35th.

1035
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:12,629
(The announcement for trainees in A1 is over.)

1036
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:13,630
Third place?

1037
00:43:15,329 --> 00:43:16,570
This is so cruel.

1038
00:43:17,699 --> 00:43:18,828
This is so cruel.

1039
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:21,340
(The members of Team A1 are facing each other now.)

1040
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:22,940
Why are you crying?

1041
00:43:24,469 --> 00:43:26,510
- Why are you crying? - You did well.

1042
00:43:27,409 --> 00:43:28,840
The spot for 35th place is still open yet.

1043
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:31,349
Don't give up until the end.

1044
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,650
This is heartbreaking.

1045
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:37,289
They've gotten so attached to each other.

1046
00:43:38,889 --> 00:43:42,019
There are 29 spots available now.

1047
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:43,829
- That's a lot. - Right.

1048
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:47,800
Who will take those remaining spots?

1049
00:43:49,769 --> 00:43:51,869
Please stay tuned to find out.

1050
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:54,239
Now, we will continue with...

1051
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,139
Is it A2?

1052
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:58,275
- With... - A2?

1053
00:43:59,475 --> 00:44:00,980
- A5. - What? That's us.

1054
00:44:02,076 --> 00:44:03,720
- A5 is next? - My gosh.

1055
00:44:04,286 --> 00:44:05,455
- Really? - My goodness.

1056
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:08,420
TXT.

1057
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:11,320
This is cruel.

1058
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:15,920
A5 competed with a song of TOMORROW X TOGETHER.

1059
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:18,659
As all 14 trainees in A5 had low rankings,

1060
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:21,500
I was told they participated in the match...

1061
00:44:21,829 --> 00:44:23,929
with great desperation to survive on the show.

1062
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,070
Between the two teams for the match,

1063
00:44:29,139 --> 00:44:31,239
Team "Deja Vu" came out on top.

1064
00:44:31,539 --> 00:44:33,739
As a benefit, they took points...

1065
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:36,380
from trainees of Team "I'll See You There Tomorrow."

1066
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:38,980
It's okay, guys. Good work.

1067
00:44:40,449 --> 00:44:41,480
All right.

1068
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:44,019
I will now announce the trainees...

1069
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:46,690
who will survive...

1070
00:44:47,659 --> 00:44:49,059
from the TOMORROW X TOGETHER match.

1071
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:50,690
Some of their ranks...

1072
00:44:50,691 --> 00:44:52,460
- might be in the 20s. - I guess so.

1073
00:44:52,929 --> 00:44:54,030
You think so?

1074
00:44:54,659 --> 00:44:58,199
As the majority of the trainees in A5 were in the lower rankings,

1075
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:02,439
there was a rumor that none of them would survive.

1076
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,869
(LEE EUNSUH ranked 62nd on the 5th week.)

1077
00:45:04,269 --> 00:45:05,368
That startled me.

1078
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,340
- That's not true. - That wasn't cool.

1079
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,749
- Get a grip. - Don't worry.

1080
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:12,079
It's okay, CHENYU. There's a spot for you. I'm sure.

1081
00:45:12,679 --> 00:45:13,750
I'm scared.

1082
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:16,419
The trainees from the previous team...

1083
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:20,659
took the lower rankings from 31st, 32nd, and 33rd.

1084
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:23,159
There aren't a lot of spots left.

1085
00:45:24,829 --> 00:45:27,598
"No one from A5 might survive."

1086
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,500
I kept hearing that from people.

1087
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:31,800
It made me wonder if anyone from our team would pass.

1088
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:36,940
Since my ranking is far from the cutoff point,

1089
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:39,808
I was telling myself that I didn't stand a chance.

1090
00:45:39,809 --> 00:45:42,309
But despite that, I was hoping I could keep going.

1091
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:46,749
Will any trainee from A5 advance to the next round?

1092
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:49,320
(Did any trainee from A5 pass?)

1093
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:52,149
The answer is yes.

1094
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:53,719
(Some trainees did pass from A5.)

1095
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:55,760
- Of course. - That's right.

1096
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:57,859
Let's go.

1097
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:59,460
We can do it, A5.

1098
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:00,929
- Let's go. - You can do this.

1099
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,069
- We were great. - We were.

1100
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:04,269
We were great.

1101
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:06,468
The ranking of the trainee that survived is...

1102
00:46:06,469 --> 00:46:07,599
(What's the ranking that will be announced first?)

1103
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,539
What if it's 34th place?

1104
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,340
What if it's 30th place? That will be shocking.

1105
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,210
Or 20th place?

1106
00:46:16,909 --> 00:46:18,579
- A rank in the 20s. - Right.

1107
00:46:19,579 --> 00:46:22,749
(The ranking of the surviving trainee is...)

1108
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:24,550
(30th place.)

1109
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:25,888
It's 30th place.

1110
00:46:25,889 --> 00:46:26,919
(The 2nd Passing Ceremony, 30th place)

1111
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,119
That's pretty high.

1112
00:46:28,489 --> 00:46:30,928
This trainee cries very easily and is known...

1113
00:46:30,929 --> 00:46:32,900
as the crybaby.

1114
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,099
It's JOONWOO.

1115
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:36,428
- It must be CHENYU. - No, it's must JOONWOO.

1116
00:46:36,429 --> 00:46:38,170
There are so many crybabies in A5.

1117
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:39,939
They cry so much.

1118
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:42,570
By the way, each team has one representative crybaby.

1119
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:43,768
(KIM JOONWOO and WU CHENYU are the representative crybabies.)

1120
00:46:43,769 --> 00:46:45,869
- Stop crying. - I'm not crying.

1121
00:46:46,309 --> 00:46:48,409
I want all of us to survive.

1122
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:51,880
(Both trainees shed tears of passion.)

1123
00:46:54,449 --> 00:46:55,718
This trainee received...

1124
00:46:55,719 --> 00:46:57,049
(Which trainee is in 30th place?)

1125
00:46:57,050 --> 00:47:01,859
a global voting score of 470,729 points.

1126
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,288
(A global voting score of 470,729 points)

1127
00:47:03,289 --> 00:47:04,359
That's high.

1128
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,959
The ranks in the 30s have similar scores.

1129
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:06,960
Right.

1130
00:47:07,559 --> 00:47:09,900
The 4 of their scores are only off by 10,000 points.

1131
00:47:09,969 --> 00:47:12,769
That's why the points from the benefit played a huge role.

1132
00:47:14,769 --> 00:47:16,408
Trainee KIM JOONWOO.

1133
00:47:16,409 --> 00:47:18,669
(30th, Trainee KIM JOONWOO)

1134
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:19,679
Congratulations.

1135
00:47:20,539 --> 00:47:21,639
So if he's in 30th place...

1136
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:24,050
Seriously.

1137
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:27,319
Trainee KIM JOONWOO is nothing without his passion.

1138
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,018
While sharing his intense passion,

1139
00:47:29,019 --> 00:47:30,948
he remained as a strict, disciplined leader of the group.

1140
00:47:30,949 --> 00:47:33,920
He received the highest number of individual votes within his team.

1141
00:47:34,889 --> 00:47:38,960
He successfully won over the hearts of the World Assemblers.

1142
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:40,800
The crybaby is about to burst into tears.

1143
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,059
He's on the verge of tears.

1144
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,429
Smile.

1145
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:44,969
JOONWOO, smile.

1146
00:47:46,099 --> 00:47:48,469
So the 1st trainee that passed was in 30th place.

1147
00:47:49,739 --> 00:47:52,510
The next ranking I'm going to announce is...

1148
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:54,179
Please be 34th place.

1149
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:58,249
(The ranking that will be announced is...)

1150
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,879
It's 34th place.

1151
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,919
- My gosh. - My gosh. No way.

1152
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:02,920
(The trainee in 34th place is in A5.)

1153
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:04,349
What a relief.

1154
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:06,759
(Other than 35th place,)

1155
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:07,989
(all the ranks in the 30s are filled.)

1156
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:09,190
It's okay, CHANYONG.

1157
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:11,189
There's still one spot.

1158
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:13,300
- Okay, 35th place. - Okay, 35th place.

1159
00:48:13,829 --> 00:48:15,029
(The 2nd Passing Ceremony, 34th place)

1160
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:17,030
(The 34th-place trainee is to be revealed.)

1161
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:19,000
I got the highest number of votes in my team from the audience.

1162
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:22,840
I had some expectations  that people might recognize my talent.

1163
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:25,510
I got 40,000 points as the benefit...

1164
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:27,809
and had the center position.

1165
00:48:28,139 --> 00:48:30,678
I was holding onto this hope that there may be...

1166
00:48:30,679 --> 00:48:32,280
a huge change in the rankings.

1167
00:48:33,449 --> 00:48:36,388
This trainee was able to win the benefit...

1168
00:48:36,389 --> 00:48:39,150
in this project as well as in his last one.

1169
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:41,218
- CHENYU. - It's CHENYU.

1170
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:42,320
He got it with "Love wins all."

1171
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,189
- Gosh, CHENYU. - CHENYU.

1172
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:45,459
- Two benefits in a row. - Right.

1173
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:46,460
I knew it.

1174
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,699
I want to go up higher.

1175
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:50,030
Right.

1176
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:52,098
- On stage... - I did too.

1177
00:48:52,099 --> 00:48:53,099
(Trainee OBAYASHI YUSEI also won two benefits in a row...)

1178
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:54,169
(with "Crayon" and "Deja Vu.")

1179
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:55,940
This felt like a cruel world of competitions.

1180
00:48:56,139 --> 00:49:00,440
I was hoping I would be able to survive this.

1181
00:49:01,139 --> 00:49:02,380
This trainee received...

1182
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:07,218
a global voting score of 445,263 points.

1183
00:49:07,219 --> 00:49:08,480
(A global voting score of 445,263 points)

1184
00:49:09,849 --> 00:49:11,518
- Trainee WU CHENYU. - Yes.

1185
00:49:11,519 --> 00:49:13,419
(34th, Trainee WU CHENYU)

1186
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:14,789
- You got it. - Congratulations.

1187
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:16,559
- Well done. - Congratulations.

1188
00:49:17,789 --> 00:49:18,888
My goodness.

1189
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:20,960
- My friend! - Good luck.

1190
00:49:23,099 --> 00:49:24,828
People have no doubt about his vocal skills.

1191
00:49:24,829 --> 00:49:26,269
His clean high notes...

1192
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:28,598
are a delight for the ears...

1193
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:30,610
- of the World Assemblers. - That's too close.

1194
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:33,539
Congratulations.

1195
00:49:36,949 --> 00:49:39,609
The next surviving trainee...

1196
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:46,589
(The next trainee that passed...)

1197
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:47,719
does not exist.

1198
00:49:49,059 --> 00:49:52,889
(Unfortunately, the next trainees didn't make the cut.)

1199
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,569
I'm not sure if I should clap or not.

1200
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:02,599
Right.

1201
00:50:03,409 --> 00:50:04,639
I liked...

1202
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:09,340
the members of my team for this project.

1203
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:14,679
So I really wanted all of us to survive.

1204
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:17,590
But this is sad.

1205
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,460
- He's about to cry. - He's going to cry.

1206
00:50:21,559 --> 00:50:22,989
- No. - "No."

1207
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:24,090
No.

1208
00:50:26,059 --> 00:50:30,099
There were people who said I would pass...

1209
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:31,570
and believed in me.

1210
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:34,199
I'd like to thank them.

1211
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,710
- Yes. - Thank you.

1212
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:44,610
First of all, I would like...

1213
00:50:44,809 --> 00:50:46,749
to thank the World Assemblers...

1214
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:50,019
for their support and votes.

1215
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:53,189
I will keep working hard,

1216
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:55,260
so I can be a trainee that...

1217
00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:58,388
only puts on great performances.

1218
00:50:58,389 --> 00:50:59,429
Thank you.

1219
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:06,400
Good job.

1220
00:51:06,539 --> 00:51:08,039
- Good work. - Good job.

1221
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:12,409
- We survived. - Yes.

1222
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:14,579
We're not going home.

1223
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:21,578
I finished announcing...

1224
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:23,489
surviving trainees in A1 and A5 so far.

1225
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:25,690
As for now,

1226
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:28,960
only 27 spots remain.

1227
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:34,659
My gosh.

1228
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,529
The lower rankings are already filled.

1229
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:39,840
Except for 35th place.

1230
00:51:40,239 --> 00:51:42,170
(35th place is the only open spot.)

1231
00:51:42,539 --> 00:51:44,769
I can detect a desire to survive in your faces...

1232
00:51:45,639 --> 00:51:48,139
as you gaze at the empty chairs.

1233
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,750
The next team I will announce from...

1234
00:51:51,079 --> 00:51:52,449
Is it A2?

1235
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:53,650
Is it us?

1236
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:55,619
Just let us go next.

1237
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:57,449
I really hope it's not A4.

1238
00:51:57,690 --> 00:51:58,690
A2?

1239
00:51:58,691 --> 00:52:01,159
They competed in the MONSTA X match.

1240
00:52:01,489 --> 00:52:03,889
They competed in the MONSTA X match.

1241
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:06,460
It's A2.

1242
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:08,959
- Let's go. - Go.

1243
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:09,969
- Good luck. - My gosh.

1244
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,199
- Hey. - You'll be back.

1245
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:16,439
Team "GAMBLER" of A2 performed...

1246
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,170
(Team Black performed MONSTA X's "GAMBLER.")

1247
00:52:21,809 --> 00:52:24,149
against Team "Jealousy." And their performances...

1248
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:25,710
left a strong impression on the World Assemblers.

1249
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:30,789
Team "Jealousy" won the match.

1250
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:33,118
So they took points...

1251
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:35,319
from the global voting scores of Team "GAMBLER."

1252
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:36,360
Good job.

1253
00:52:37,829 --> 00:52:38,829
Right away?

1254
00:52:38,830 --> 00:52:41,230
(Team Black: "GAMBLER," Team While: "Jealousy")

1255
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,570
- They will take a lot of the spots. - Right.

1256
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,099
And the spots in the top seven too.

1257
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:48,739
They will take most of the middle and high rankings.

1258
00:52:49,369 --> 00:52:51,570
Don't you think they'll take about ten spots?

1259
00:52:51,909 --> 00:52:53,280
Don't take 35th place.

1260
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:55,178
Why are there so many of them?

1261
00:52:55,179 --> 00:52:56,210
(OH TAEHWAN ranked 34th on the 5th week.)

1262
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:59,049
A2 competed against each other with MONSTA X's songs.

1263
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,849
The first ranking I will announce for them will be...

1264
00:53:01,579 --> 00:53:02,679
I'm nervous.

1265
00:53:03,519 --> 00:53:04,789
I'm scared.

1266
00:53:05,289 --> 00:53:08,259
I was insecure because I wasn't sure if I could maintain...

1267
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:09,889
my ranking.

1268
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:12,530
In the 1st Passing Ceremony, I was in 13th place.

1269
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:14,900
Then I was in 20th place.

1270
00:53:14,929 --> 00:53:16,500
So I was worried.

1271
00:53:17,329 --> 00:53:20,139
There was a time I ranked above 35th place.

1272
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:23,039
Maybe, I might be able to advance with some crazy luck.

1273
00:53:23,369 --> 00:53:25,139
(MAJINGXIANG ranked 8th on the 5th week.)

1274
00:53:25,309 --> 00:53:26,840
(SAKURADA KENSHIN ranked 1st on the 5th week.)

1275
00:53:27,179 --> 00:53:31,550
I will now announce the trainee in 13th place.

1276
00:53:31,849 --> 00:53:32,979
What? In 13th place?

1277
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:34,949
(The 2nd Passing Ceremony, 13th place)

1278
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,948
Maybe, it's you. MAJINGXIANG might be...

1279
00:53:37,949 --> 00:53:39,050
in the top seven.

1280
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:40,460
Is it me?

1281
00:53:41,659 --> 00:53:43,460
What was MAJINGXIANG's previous ranking?

1282
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:44,960
He was in eighth place last week.

1283
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:47,829
His ranking wouldn't drop to 13th place, right?

1284
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:52,170
The top 7... Can I make it back into the top 7?

1285
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:53,840
It might be really tough.

1286
00:53:55,099 --> 00:53:58,038
(His ranking dropped to 5th place after previously ranking 3rd.)

1287
00:53:58,039 --> 00:53:59,109
(The 2nd Passing Ceremony, 13th place)

1288
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:01,139
This trainee in 13th place...

1289
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:06,050
belongs to the older group of his team.

1290
00:54:06,679 --> 00:54:07,679
HAJOON?

1291
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,949
It might be HANBIN or HYUNWOO.

1292
00:54:13,789 --> 00:54:14,860
MAJINGXIANG?

1293
00:54:14,889 --> 00:54:16,360
He's one of the older trainees.

1294
00:54:20,329 --> 00:54:23,129
He was one of the trainees who stepped up...

1295
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:25,900
and taught other trainees during practice.

1296
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:27,800
HANBIN helped them with singing too.

1297
00:54:28,969 --> 00:54:30,610
They all taught other trainees.

1298
00:54:32,469 --> 00:54:34,909
(Trainee KIM HYUNWOO was their dance teacher.)

1299
00:54:35,409 --> 00:54:38,050
(Trainee LEE HANBIN was their vocal teacher.)

1300
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,619
This trainee received...

1301
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:45,690
a global voting score in the millions.

1302
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:48,190
A medium-sized city votes for him.

1303
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:51,389
In the millions? That's a huge jump.

1304
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:54,359
He received 1,290,839 points.

1305
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:56,429
(A global voting score of 1,290,839 points)

1306
00:54:58,269 --> 00:55:00,639
Congratulations, Trainee KIM HYUNWOO.

1307
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:05,070
(13th, Trainee KIM HYUNWOO)

1308
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:09,440
That's so cool.

1309
00:55:10,179 --> 00:55:11,349
Go and wait for me there.

1310
00:55:11,849 --> 00:55:12,849
I'll catch up.

1311
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:14,849
- Yes. - Yes.

1312
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:20,359
Trainee KIM HYUNWOO was the center of Team "Jealousy."

1313
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,460
And his team won the Rival Matching.

1314
00:55:22,789 --> 00:55:25,889
As the winning benefit, Trainee KIM HYUNWOO...

1315
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:28,530
took 60,000 points...

1316
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:31,699
from Trainee SANTA's global voting score.

1317
00:55:32,869 --> 00:55:34,439
After recovering from his leg injury,

1318
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:36,968
he showed an excellent performance on stage.

1319
00:55:36,969 --> 00:55:39,869
He won over the hearts of the World Assemblers once again.

1320
00:55:40,039 --> 00:55:41,639
And he passed with a high ranking.

1321
00:55:43,079 --> 00:55:44,150
- That's great. - Hey.

1322
00:55:44,909 --> 00:55:47,980
Will the next trainee be ranked in the tens as well?

1323
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:49,250
I'm not sure about this.

1324
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:52,349
The next trainee I will announce is...

1325
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:56,960
in 20th place.

1326
00:55:57,159 --> 00:55:58,589
(WOO HAJOON ranked 21st on the 5th week.)

1327
00:55:58,590 --> 00:56:00,030
(FONG ATILLA ranked 20th on the 5th week.)

1328
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:01,729
(SHIN JAEWON ranked 26th on the 5th week.)

1329
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:03,199
(LEE HANBIN ranked 24th on the 5th week.)

1330
00:56:03,469 --> 00:56:06,269
(KIM JEONGMIN ranked 25th on the 5th week.)

1331
00:56:06,429 --> 00:56:07,439
It will jump to 20th place...

1332
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,599
- from 13th place? - So listen.

1333
00:56:09,539 --> 00:56:10,969
This trainee ranked quite high...

1334
00:56:11,269 --> 00:56:14,710
in the Individual Vote of the Rival Matching.

1335
00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:17,550
ATILLA? ATILLA ranked high.

1336
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:20,849
No, he didn't. He was in fifth place...

1337
00:56:21,019 --> 00:56:22,179
in the Individual Vote.

1338
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:25,849
Is it HANBIN?

1339
00:56:27,489 --> 00:56:28,989
And no one...

1340
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:32,260
can look as young as this trainee does.

1341
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:34,460
Gosh, it's not HANBIN then.

1342
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,459
- Is it me? - It's not HANBIN then.

1343
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:38,069
- It's not me? - It can't be HANBIN.

1344
00:56:38,070 --> 00:56:39,829
- Come on. What a bummer. - It's not you.

1345
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,170
This trainee received...

1346
00:56:43,239 --> 00:56:44,710
just under 1,000,000 points.

1347
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:48,079
- Gosh, just under 1,000,000 points? - He received 940,282 points.

1348
00:56:51,050 --> 00:56:52,880
Trainee WOO HAJOON.

1349
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:56,078
(20th, Trainee WOO HAJOON)

1350
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,090
Congratulations.

1351
00:57:00,989 --> 00:57:02,019
My gosh, HAJOON.

1352
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:04,460
His ranking went up a lot.

1353
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:06,529
- Baby face. - Trainee WOO HAJOON was...

1354
00:57:06,530 --> 00:57:07,960
the leader of Team "GAMBLER."

1355
00:57:08,030 --> 00:57:09,799
He did a great job leading his job.

1356
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,400
Unfortunately, his team lost the match.

1357
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:14,339
Even though he lost some of his points,

1358
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:16,440
with the support of the World Assemblers,

1359
00:57:16,539 --> 00:57:18,269
he safely made it through this project.

1360
00:57:19,409 --> 00:57:20,980
HAJOON's ranking went up a lot too.

1361
00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:23,909
Last week, I was in 22nd place.

1362
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:25,909
No one is in 22nd place yet.

1363
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:30,820
Next, I'll announce the trainee...

1364
00:57:31,019 --> 00:57:32,920
in 22nd place.

1365
00:57:33,789 --> 00:57:35,019
The 22nd place.

1366
00:57:36,489 --> 00:57:40,559
He's one of the most talented trainee on the show.

1367
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:44,599
- JAEWON? - No, it's KIM JEONGMIN.

1368
00:57:45,869 --> 00:57:47,840
JEONGMIN is like an all-rounder.

1369
00:57:48,869 --> 00:57:50,809
ATILLA? He's also talented.

1370
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:54,639
ATILLA, HANBIN, or JEONGMIN.

1371
00:57:55,079 --> 00:57:56,509
A lot of talented trainees are in that team.

1372
00:57:56,510 --> 00:57:57,679
(A2 has a lot of talented trainees.)

1373
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:00,719
And in the last performance,

1374
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:04,888
he let us hear his refreshing high notes.

1375
00:58:04,889 --> 00:58:06,289
- It's JAEWON. - It's you.

1376
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,320
- It's ATILLA. - Is it ATILLA?

1377
00:58:08,619 --> 00:58:09,789
He did show us refreshing high notes.

1378
00:58:10,829 --> 00:58:13,329
(Trainee FONG ATILLA pulled off refreshing high notes.)

1379
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:17,530
(LEE HANBIN was in charge of high notes.)

1380
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:21,139
(SHIN JAEWON was in charge of high notes as well.)

1381
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:22,840
This trainee received...

1382
00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:28,780
a global voting score of 842,084 points.

1383
00:58:32,179 --> 00:58:33,948
It's Trainee FONG ATILLA.

1384
00:58:33,949 --> 00:58:36,049
- Oh, my gosh! It's you. - Congratulations.

1385
00:58:36,050 --> 00:58:37,820
- Congratulations. - Gosh.

1386
00:58:40,659 --> 00:58:42,919
- My best friend! - My best friend!

1387
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:43,929
My best friend!

1388
00:58:45,929 --> 00:58:47,059
Congratulations.

1389
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:51,400
- Good work. - You did well.

1390
00:58:52,329 --> 00:58:54,699
Our team did well thanks to you.

1391
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:55,769
Thank you so much.

1392
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:58,738
Trainee FONG ATILLA showed stable skills...

1393
00:58:58,739 --> 00:59:01,209
and great stage manners in every project,

1394
00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:04,179
showing off his sides as a well-prepared idol.

1395
00:59:04,679 --> 00:59:08,019
I can't wait to see what kind of side he'll show...

1396
00:59:08,449 --> 00:59:09,619
in the next project.

1397
00:59:10,349 --> 00:59:12,189
We didn't have refreshing high notes.

1398
00:59:12,190 --> 00:59:13,519
They weren't refreshing.

1399
00:59:15,059 --> 00:59:17,888
Trainees from Team "GAMBLER" passed in a row.

1400
00:59:17,889 --> 00:59:20,329
Let's see which trainee from which team passed this time.

1401
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:22,300
It's about time we have one too.

1402
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:25,630
The ranking of the next trainee who passed...

1403
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:26,730
The 24th?

1404
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:28,768
is 24th.

1405
00:59:28,769 --> 00:59:32,110
(The 24th-place trainee is to be revealed.)

1406
00:59:32,469 --> 00:59:33,469
Why did I get that right?

1407
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:35,038
You should be a fortune-teller.

1408
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:36,110
Why did I get that right?

1409
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:39,709
This trainee is one of the trainees whose great chemistry...

1410
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:41,119
with his teammate stood out.

1411
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:43,420
Great chemistry with his teammate?

1412
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:46,150
We don't have to go far to guess.

1413
00:59:46,849 --> 00:59:49,789
(24th, Trainee LEE HANBIN)

1414
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:52,159
- It's obviously you. - Isn't it you?

1415
00:59:52,530 --> 00:59:53,800
With the guy who used color-neutralizing shampoo.

1416
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:56,199
(HANBIN showed great chemistry with HYUNWOO.)

1417
00:59:56,429 --> 00:59:57,469
JAEWON?

1418
00:59:59,130 --> 01:00:00,469
This trainee...

1419
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:03,500
specializes in vocals.

1420
01:00:03,769 --> 01:00:05,769
Which one out of the two great singers is it?

1421
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:08,079
This trainee received...

1422
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:15,280
a global voting score of 722,648 points.

1423
01:00:19,389 --> 01:00:20,789
It's Trainee LEE HANBIN.

1424
01:00:22,219 --> 01:00:24,488
- Let's give him a hug. - Congratulations.

1425
01:00:24,489 --> 01:00:25,529
(24th, Trainee LEE HANBIN)

1426
01:00:25,530 --> 01:00:27,529
- Great job. - Thank you.

1427
01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:28,598
- Trainee LEE HANBIN... - Thank you.

1428
01:00:28,599 --> 01:00:31,828
took 30,000 points from Trainee OH SEUNGCHAN...

1429
01:00:31,829 --> 01:00:33,368
after his team won...

1430
01:00:33,369 --> 01:00:35,340
in the Rival Match.

1431
01:00:35,869 --> 01:00:39,210
- Congratulations. - He showed great chemistry...

1432
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:41,879
with his same-age friend, Trainee KIM HYUNWOO.

1433
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:43,639
- We're not close. - In the last performance,

1434
01:00:43,710 --> 01:00:46,349
he showed his presence that draws everyone's attention,

1435
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:49,519
winning the support of the World Assemblers.

1436
01:00:49,849 --> 01:00:50,920
Congratulations.

1437
01:00:55,889 --> 01:00:59,730
We already have 4 trainees who passed from A2.

1438
01:01:01,159 --> 01:01:02,329
So many of them passed.

1439
01:01:03,929 --> 01:01:06,129
He continued to not call my name.

1440
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:08,769
It was about time he did, but he didn't.

1441
01:01:09,099 --> 01:01:11,239
I was worried about being the only one who didn't pass.

1442
01:01:11,309 --> 01:01:12,909
That's the only thought I had.

1443
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:16,979
Apparently, there are more trainees from A2...

1444
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:19,009
(There are more trainees from A2...)

1445
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:20,518
who passed.

1446
01:01:20,519 --> 01:01:22,250
(who passed?)

1447
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:23,920
I thought I'd be the only one.

1448
01:01:24,650 --> 01:01:27,289
I thought I could be called by now.

1449
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:29,288
(53rd, Trainee IM SIU)

1450
01:01:29,289 --> 01:01:30,489
"This can't happen."

1451
01:01:31,429 --> 01:01:32,760
They're all being called.

1452
01:01:34,699 --> 01:01:36,059
They'll fill all the spots.

1453
01:01:37,369 --> 01:01:40,130
The ranking of the next trainee who passed...

1454
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:43,198
is 25th.

1455
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:44,809
(The 25th-place trainee is to be revealed.)

1456
01:01:47,079 --> 01:01:48,280
That was my ranking.

1457
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:50,138
Will I keep it?

1458
01:01:50,139 --> 01:01:51,480
(25th, Trainee KIM JEONGMIN)

1459
01:01:51,550 --> 01:01:52,649
Despite being young,

1460
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:55,920
this trainee showed his sexiness in earnest...

1461
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:59,920
during the Rival Match.

1462
01:02:00,659 --> 01:02:01,920
I think it's JEONGMIN.

1463
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:03,829
Is it YECHAN?

1464
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:12,099
(The sexiness of a trainee born in 2007, KIM JEONGMIN)

1465
01:02:13,269 --> 01:02:16,769
(The sexiness of a trainee born in 2008, YEOM YECHAN)

1466
01:02:17,809 --> 01:02:21,238
I did think I could get eliminated,

1467
01:02:21,239 --> 01:02:24,380
but I thought I could pass by around ten percent.

1468
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:26,510
This trainee received...

1469
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:32,550
a global voting score of 634,648 points.

1470
01:02:36,289 --> 01:02:37,630
It's Trainee KIM JEONGMIN.

1471
01:02:37,989 --> 01:02:39,360
- Hey, JEONGMIN. - Let's give him a hug.

1472
01:02:39,530 --> 01:02:41,058
- Let's give him a hug. - Congratulations.

1473
01:02:41,059 --> 01:02:42,099
Bring it!

1474
01:02:43,969 --> 01:02:45,099
Thank you.

1475
01:02:45,829 --> 01:02:47,139
Good luck with the next performance.

1476
01:02:47,969 --> 01:02:50,738
With his cute looks and solid dance skills,

1477
01:02:50,739 --> 01:02:52,570
Trainee KIM JEONGMIN...

1478
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:54,578
showed off his presence on stage,

1479
01:02:54,579 --> 01:02:56,839
stealing the hearts of the World Assemblers...

1480
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:59,010
and winning a safe ranking. Congratulations.

1481
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:04,649
I will continue with the announcement.

1482
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:05,650
(Which ranking will he announce next?)

1483
01:03:05,651 --> 01:03:07,289
The ranking I'm about to reveal...

1484
01:03:12,159 --> 01:03:13,730
is 26th.

1485
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:15,130
They're all revealed here.

1486
01:03:15,530 --> 01:03:17,328
The trainees in 22nd, 24th, 25th, and 26th are all revealed.

1487
01:03:17,329 --> 01:03:19,429
The rankings are revealed in a row.

1488
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:21,138
In a row.

1489
01:03:21,139 --> 01:03:22,900
He's officially in charge...

1490
01:03:23,139 --> 01:03:26,139
of reactions on PROJECT 7.

1491
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:28,738
It's JAEWON.

1492
01:03:28,739 --> 01:03:31,009
- JAEWON's reactions are great. - Right.

1493
01:03:31,010 --> 01:03:32,849
(26th, SHIN JAEWON)

1494
01:03:34,679 --> 01:03:36,119
Isn't SVIAT the best with his reactions?

1495
01:03:37,949 --> 01:03:39,288
- SVIAT? - SVIAT?

1496
01:03:39,289 --> 01:03:41,019
- I think it's SVIAT. - Isn't it SVIAT?

1497
01:03:41,159 --> 01:03:43,960
(39th, SVIAT)

1498
01:03:44,230 --> 01:03:45,630
This trainee received...

1499
01:03:46,659 --> 01:03:51,500
a global voting score of 529,123 points.

1500
01:03:56,039 --> 01:03:58,809
It's Trainee SHIN JAEWON.

1501
01:03:58,969 --> 01:04:00,468
- Congratulations. - Give me a hug too.

1502
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:01,479
- Great job. - Pipo Pipo.

1503
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:03,379
- Pipo Pipo. - Oh, it's Pipo Pipo.

1504
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:04,809
- That's right. - We're the members of Pipo Pipo.

1505
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:07,519
- The main vocalist. - Thank you.

1506
01:04:07,949 --> 01:04:10,018
As though he was relieving his frustrations...

1507
01:04:10,019 --> 01:04:13,349
of not being able to show his vocal skills during Position Match,

1508
01:04:13,489 --> 01:04:15,718
Trainee SHIN JAEWON proved his stable vocal skills...

1509
01:04:15,719 --> 01:04:16,789
through the last performance...

1510
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:19,559
and won a safe ranking. Congratulations.

1511
01:04:20,972 --> 01:04:23,613
JAEWON!

1512
01:04:25,275 --> 01:04:27,570
I'll announce the next ranking.

1513
01:04:28,369 --> 01:04:29,469
There's more?

1514
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:34,179
A trainee from A2 who performed with a song by MONSTA X and passed.

1515
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:46,320
There isn't any.

1516
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:49,590
There isn't any.

1517
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:54,399
JINWON didn't make it.

1518
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:58,029
A total number of trainees from A2 who passed is 6.

1519
01:04:58,030 --> 01:04:59,030
(6 trainees from A2 passed.)

1520
01:04:59,670 --> 01:05:02,569
Gosh, YECHAN...

1521
01:05:02,570 --> 01:05:04,670
- That's it. - I feel bad for YECHAN.

1522
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:09,809
I had hopes because I was in 36th place.

1523
01:05:10,679 --> 01:05:12,579
I did think I could...

1524
01:05:12,809 --> 01:05:15,920
make it to 35th place if luck followed.

1525
01:05:16,219 --> 01:05:18,249
Oh, KENSHIN, SUNGMIN, and MAJINGXIANG...

1526
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:19,420
must be in Top Seven.

1527
01:05:24,289 --> 01:05:27,900
First of all, I'd like to thank...

1528
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:31,199
the members of Team "JEALOUSY."

1529
01:05:32,869 --> 01:05:36,469
That's why JINWON is lingering on my mind.

1530
01:05:38,570 --> 01:05:39,639
That's how I feel.

1531
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:44,550
You can do well.

1532
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:50,949
World Assemblers.

1533
01:05:51,590 --> 01:05:54,059
Thank you so much for giving me another chance.

1534
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:56,619
I love you, Mom and Dad.

1535
01:05:56,659 --> 01:05:58,559
SEUNGHO and SEYUN, I love you too.

1536
01:06:02,199 --> 01:06:03,360
That's right.

1537
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,630
During the first Passing Ceremony,

1538
01:06:06,269 --> 01:06:08,670
I wasn't proud of being at this spot.

1539
01:06:08,699 --> 01:06:11,369
But I can stand here proudly now, and I'm happy about it.

1540
01:06:11,969 --> 01:06:14,908
I'll work even harder to show my good sides...

1541
01:06:14,909 --> 01:06:18,449
and good performances to the World Assemblers.

1542
01:06:18,710 --> 01:06:22,380
I don't know how many more performances I can do,

1543
01:06:22,449 --> 01:06:24,948
but I'll do my best...

1544
01:06:24,949 --> 01:06:27,659
and prove myself.

1545
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:32,659
Honestly, being in Team "GAMBLER..."

1546
01:06:32,829 --> 01:06:35,929
was a little difficult for me.

1547
01:06:36,530 --> 01:06:39,500
But because every member helped me,

1548
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:43,869
I can be where I am now.

1549
01:06:44,309 --> 01:06:47,439
So I learned a lot through them.

1550
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:48,539
Thank you so much.

1551
01:06:53,349 --> 01:06:54,519
Our team...

1552
01:06:56,579 --> 01:06:57,650
What is it?

1553
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:02,119
Our team...

1554
01:07:03,059 --> 01:07:05,059
had a lot of concerns,

1555
01:07:06,030 --> 01:07:09,703
but we made a great performance.

1556
01:07:14,570 --> 01:07:18,268
So I'm really sad that we can't...

1557
01:07:18,269 --> 01:07:19,369
do the next mission together.

1558
01:07:20,570 --> 01:07:23,940
But we can meet again.

1559
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:25,650
I'm going to miss you.

1560
01:07:31,449 --> 01:07:34,090
(6 trainees who passed move to the seats.)

1561
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:36,989
- You went through a lot. - You worked hard.

1562
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:38,960
Come here.

1563
01:07:39,730 --> 01:07:41,329
We can meet again.

1564
01:07:41,530 --> 01:07:42,599
All right.

1565
01:07:44,730 --> 01:07:45,829
Gosh.

1566
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:48,900
Congratulations.

1567
01:07:50,039 --> 01:07:52,739
(Trainee KIM HYUNWOO is ranked 13th.)

1568
01:07:53,010 --> 01:07:55,038
- Hello. - Hello.

1569
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:56,039
(Other trainees who passed take a seat too.)

1570
01:07:57,139 --> 01:07:59,349
No, you're really ranked 35th.

1571
01:07:59,650 --> 01:08:00,820
You can't leave.

1572
01:08:01,579 --> 01:08:03,380
It's all right. We have 35th left.

1573
01:08:05,449 --> 01:08:07,320
You can take 35th.

1574
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:10,618
(The number of seats left now...)

1575
01:08:10,619 --> 01:08:12,429
(is 21.)

1576
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:14,159
Before announcing the next one,

1577
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:15,929
we'll take a break.

1578
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:17,869
After watching the video we prepared,

1579
01:08:18,029 --> 01:08:20,130
we'll go on with the Passing Ceremony.

1580
01:08:21,470 --> 01:08:23,398
(The 2nd Passing Ceremony will continue.)

1581
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:25,239
- What is it? - What did we do?

1582
01:08:27,210 --> 01:08:30,079
(A few days before the contest)

1583
01:08:30,810 --> 01:08:32,108
Why are we gathering like this?

1584
01:08:32,109 --> 01:08:35,279
What's going on on such a nice day?

1585
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:37,319
What's this?

1586
01:08:37,689 --> 01:08:38,818
What is it?

1587
01:08:38,819 --> 01:08:40,319
We have a situation.

1588
01:08:40,350 --> 01:08:41,619
A situation?

1589
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:43,419
- What? - Arm wrestling?

1590
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:44,930
(There's a draw box in the center of the room.)

1591
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:46,060
There are drawing straws.

1592
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,430
(What's going on?)

1593
01:08:50,529 --> 01:08:52,629
You're divided into black and white.

1594
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:54,399
- Yes. - What do you think you will do?

1595
01:08:54,739 --> 01:08:56,569
We'll decide the order by drawing.

1596
01:08:57,069 --> 01:08:58,609
Convenience store match.

1597
01:09:01,739 --> 01:09:03,479
- All right! - Really?

1598
01:09:05,109 --> 01:09:06,649
We need to win, no matter what!

1599
01:09:07,409 --> 01:09:08,949
We're going to decide the order you perform.

1600
01:09:09,819 --> 01:09:10,849
- The order. - I see.

1601
01:09:10,850 --> 01:09:13,019
We'll decide who will go first for the performance.

1602
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:14,359
It's not for the convenience store?

1603
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:16,789
Are you disappointed?

1604
01:09:17,390 --> 01:09:18,529
Don't be.

1605
01:09:18,630 --> 01:09:20,760
This matters more to me.

1606
01:09:23,229 --> 01:09:26,100
(Team MONSTA X of A2 goes first.)

1607
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:27,600
Okay.

1608
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:30,670
(The event for competition is written on the note.)

1609
01:09:32,939 --> 01:09:35,140
- What is it? - Show it here, SVIAT.

1610
01:09:35,779 --> 01:09:36,938
(Limbo)

1611
01:09:36,939 --> 01:09:38,148
It's limbo.

1612
01:09:38,149 --> 01:09:40,549
- I think you can do it well. - He's too tall.

1613
01:09:40,550 --> 01:09:42,119
Tall. I see.

1614
01:09:42,750 --> 01:09:44,750
SVIAT is tense.

1615
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:47,020
(Nervous)

1616
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:48,889
We will win easily.

1617
01:09:48,890 --> 01:09:50,289
We'll win.

1618
01:09:50,659 --> 01:09:51,929
Like the white T-shirts you're wearing now,

1619
01:09:51,930 --> 01:09:53,760
we'll make you turn pale.

1620
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:57,229
But I'm not going to do it.

1621
01:09:57,359 --> 01:09:59,328
ATILLA will do it.

1622
01:09:59,329 --> 01:10:00,500
(Trainee FONG ATILLA has learned ballet for 4 years.)

1623
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:03,639
We'll start from 130cm.

1624
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:04,710
This is so easy.

1625
01:10:05,010 --> 01:10:06,909
(Limbo begins.)

1626
01:10:07,069 --> 01:10:08,609
This is easy.

1627
01:10:09,979 --> 01:10:11,909
It's disadvantageous to MAJINGXIANG.

1628
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:15,520
(Trainee MAJINGXIANG is 188cm, the tallest.)

1629
01:10:16,449 --> 01:10:17,619
(Trainee KIM SUNGMIN is another tall one.)

1630
01:10:18,289 --> 01:10:19,890
It's been easy up to now.

1631
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:21,220
Are you all right, SUNGMIN?

1632
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:23,118
I have a backache.

1633
01:10:23,119 --> 01:10:24,119
(Team MONSTA X has tall members.)

1634
01:10:24,859 --> 01:10:27,060
(Challenging 100cm)

1635
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:28,729
Okay.

1636
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:33,869
MAJINGXIANG is good.

1637
01:10:34,770 --> 01:10:35,770
MAJINGXIANG!

1638
01:10:35,771 --> 01:10:36,938
Although he's so tall.

1639
01:10:36,939 --> 01:10:38,409
MAJINGXIANG is the best player.

1640
01:10:39,310 --> 01:10:41,939
(Flexibility from 188cm!)

1641
01:10:42,510 --> 01:10:43,840
He's so flexible.

1642
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:45,509
SVIAT is the worst.

1643
01:10:45,510 --> 01:10:47,510
- What's that? - SVIAT is the worst player.

1644
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:49,750
Go for it.

1645
01:10:49,949 --> 01:10:51,949
- SANTA! - SANTA, what is that?

1646
01:10:54,489 --> 01:10:56,789
(The first one to be eliminated?)

1647
01:11:00,029 --> 01:11:01,328
(Trainee FONG ATILLA...)

1648
01:11:01,329 --> 01:11:03,260
(is eliminated.)

1649
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:07,228
(Happy)

1650
01:11:07,229 --> 01:11:09,539
ATILLA!

1651
01:11:10,199 --> 01:11:11,939
The only hope of our team has fallen.

1652
01:11:12,869 --> 01:11:15,309
- We can win this. - Do you want to attack or defend?

1653
01:11:15,310 --> 01:11:16,409
- ATILLA! - I want to defend.

1654
01:11:16,539 --> 01:11:17,609
We won!

1655
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:19,549
We can win.

1656
01:11:19,550 --> 01:11:20,649
We're almost there.

1657
01:11:21,479 --> 01:11:25,350
(Meanwhile, MAJINGXIANG is warming up.)

1658
01:11:25,449 --> 01:11:26,449
You can do it.

1659
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:31,329
What's that?

1660
01:11:33,130 --> 01:11:34,630
He goes straightforward without hesitation.

1661
01:11:38,329 --> 01:11:40,399
(Trainee SHIN JAEWON of Team "Jealousy" is eliminated.)

1662
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:44,169
(Trainee KIM JEONGMIN of Team "Jealousy" is eliminated.)

1663
01:11:44,170 --> 01:11:45,939
What? Is JEONGMIN not flexible?

1664
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:47,470
Wait.

1665
01:11:47,779 --> 01:11:50,380
(Members of Team "Jealousy" get eliminated in a row.)

1666
01:11:50,909 --> 01:11:51,949
Goodness.

1667
01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:53,550
He's quick.

1668
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:55,949
How come everyone on our team fails so suddenly?

1669
01:11:57,279 --> 01:11:59,449
(Team "Gambler" versus Team "Jealousy")

1670
01:12:00,189 --> 01:12:01,420
You need to win only one person.

1671
01:12:02,619 --> 01:12:03,659
Oh, my!

1672
01:12:05,130 --> 01:12:06,629
You did a good job.

1673
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:07,630
- What's that? - He's excited.

1674
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:10,829
- What's that? - He's excited.

1675
01:12:11,630 --> 01:12:12,728
What was that?

1676
01:12:12,729 --> 01:12:13,829
SUNGMIN.

1677
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:18,369
He's like a piece of paper.

1678
01:12:19,069 --> 01:12:20,970
Do you miss a spring in your body?

1679
01:12:22,310 --> 01:12:24,310
(After that)

1680
01:12:27,350 --> 01:12:29,550
(Now even his back makes people laugh.)

1681
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:32,289
(He plays limbo in an unusual pose.)

1682
01:12:32,350 --> 01:12:33,648
He looks like a large green onion that went bad.

1683
01:12:33,649 --> 01:12:35,659
(He looks like a large green onion that went bad.)

1684
01:12:39,090 --> 01:12:40,760
- What's that? - My goodness.

1685
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:44,300
(While Trainee KIM SUNGMIN is holding on)

1686
01:12:45,229 --> 01:12:46,630
I'm not seeing you off. Bye.

1687
01:12:47,470 --> 01:12:50,899
(Members of Team "Gambler" fail in a row.)

1688
01:12:52,039 --> 01:12:53,270
They're good.

1689
01:12:57,710 --> 01:12:58,948
(Last 2 contenders)

1690
01:12:58,949 --> 01:13:00,750
- He's the tallest one. - MAJINGXIANG.

1691
01:13:01,350 --> 01:13:02,920
The tallest ones are left.

1692
01:13:03,779 --> 01:13:05,090
The tall ones are left.

1693
01:13:05,949 --> 01:13:07,050
He's the tallest.

1694
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,259
See how the tallest ones are left.

1695
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:10,590
(They challenge for playing limbo of 70cm height.)

1696
01:13:10,890 --> 01:13:12,989
This is...

1697
01:13:14,430 --> 01:13:16,560
(Trainee MAJINGXIANG goes.)

1698
01:13:21,369 --> 01:13:24,340
(Trainee MAJINGXIANG succeeds.)

1699
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:32,050
SUNGMIN, you need to make it!

1700
01:13:32,310 --> 01:13:33,448
SUNGMIN, you can do it!

1701
01:13:33,449 --> 01:13:35,420
- You can do it. - Let's go, rotten green onion.

1702
01:13:35,449 --> 01:13:36,579
Turn your body.

1703
01:13:38,149 --> 01:13:40,119
(Let's go, rotten green onion.)

1704
01:13:41,289 --> 01:13:43,188
(The last survivor shows competence in bending.)

1705
01:13:43,189 --> 01:13:44,288
Goodness.

1706
01:13:44,289 --> 01:13:46,359
Gosh.

1707
01:13:47,029 --> 01:13:49,029
MAJINGXIANG is good.

1708
01:13:50,229 --> 01:13:52,269
- They're so good. - It's 65cm.

1709
01:13:52,270 --> 01:13:53,600
(Going for 65cm!)

1710
01:13:54,670 --> 01:13:56,840
It's as high as their thighs.

1711
01:13:58,239 --> 01:14:00,340
- I don't they can do it. - It's too tough.

1712
01:14:00,539 --> 01:14:02,840
- Let's go. - You can do it.

1713
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:04,479
Go for it!

1714
01:14:04,850 --> 01:14:06,279
- MAJINGXIANG! - I think MAJINGXIANG can do it.

1715
01:14:06,979 --> 01:14:09,479
(Who's the last one to win?)

1716
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:10,520
MAJINGXIANG!

1717
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:15,020
(Trainee MAJINGXIANG goes.)

1718
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:18,960
(Please!)

1719
01:14:22,329 --> 01:14:24,898
(Trainee MAJINGXIANG succeeds!)

1720
01:14:24,899 --> 01:14:26,170
This is insane.

1721
01:14:27,770 --> 01:14:30,199
(If Trainee KIM SUNGMIN succeeds, they'll have a rematch.)

1722
01:14:30,970 --> 01:14:32,369
That's crazy.

1723
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:37,109
(Is he going to make it?)

1724
01:14:42,579 --> 01:14:43,778
Goodness.

1725
01:14:43,779 --> 01:14:45,449
(Passed out)

1726
01:14:49,159 --> 01:14:50,719
(The limbo showdown of tall trainees was intense!)

1727
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:52,489
- Nice! - Come on.

1728
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:54,090
You worked hard.

1729
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:56,299
MAJINGXIANG did a good job.

1730
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:57,930
How come he's so good?

1731
01:14:59,069 --> 01:15:00,729
He's 188cm tall.

1732
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:01,899
Well done.

1733
01:15:01,970 --> 01:15:03,368
(Team "Gambler" wins!)

1734
01:15:03,369 --> 01:15:05,010
- How can they do that? - Good job.

1735
01:15:05,470 --> 01:15:06,710
- Well done. - Thank you.

1736
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:09,278
Going for 1m 30cm.

1737
01:15:09,279 --> 01:15:10,439
(Team RIIZE of A1 also competes in the limbo match.)

1738
01:15:18,220 --> 01:15:21,050
(I'm the center of Team "Boom Boom Bass"!)

1739
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:23,920
(Bending his neck)

1740
01:15:24,289 --> 01:15:25,329
Is that allowed?

1741
01:15:25,489 --> 01:15:27,189
That eliminates him.

1742
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:28,560
You should bend your body.

1743
01:15:28,899 --> 01:15:31,300
- You should leave. - You're not supposed to do this.

1744
01:15:31,369 --> 01:15:32,699
You shouldn't do this.

1745
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:35,698
He's doing it right.

1746
01:15:35,699 --> 01:15:37,069
(The game resumes.)

1747
01:15:37,270 --> 01:15:38,770
Okay.

1748
01:15:39,170 --> 01:15:40,608
- How come they're so good? - They're so good.

1749
01:15:40,609 --> 01:15:42,909
(130cm is easy for them.)

1750
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:51,079
(Unrivaled flexibility)

1751
01:15:52,119 --> 01:15:53,750
- KOTARO! - Come on, KOTARO.

1752
01:15:53,949 --> 01:15:55,460
KOTARO's performance was unbelievable.

1753
01:15:56,220 --> 01:15:58,229
- Let's go! - Watch out for your head.

1754
01:16:02,199 --> 01:16:04,060
(Careful)

1755
01:16:07,329 --> 01:16:08,399
They might get eliminated.

1756
01:16:10,569 --> 01:16:11,770
How come they're so good?

1757
01:16:12,609 --> 01:16:13,840
How come they're so good?

1758
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:17,239
(He's the first one that gets eliminated.)

1759
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:20,149
(Trainee SONG HYUNGSEOK of Team "Boom Boom Bass" fails.)

1760
01:16:20,279 --> 01:16:21,779
- It's all right. - Let it go!

1761
01:16:21,949 --> 01:16:23,220
Let it go!

1762
01:16:26,350 --> 01:16:27,989
(Did he make it?)

1763
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:32,459
(It must hurt.)

1764
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:33,529
It must hurt a lot.

1765
01:16:35,130 --> 01:16:36,259
That was close.

1766
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:38,470
- My goodness. - It's all right.

1767
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:40,999
Limbo doesn't go with you.

1768
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,270
You did your best.

1769
01:16:43,069 --> 01:16:44,069
Okay.

1770
01:16:47,140 --> 01:16:49,510
(Trainee KIM YOUNGHOON of Team "Boom Boom Bass" fails.)

1771
01:16:50,380 --> 01:16:51,750
JIAHN!

1772
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:54,210
- Give it up! - JIAHN, you can give it up now.

1773
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,778
Come here. You really can get hurt.

1774
01:16:56,779 --> 01:16:58,819
- You might get injured. - I mean it.

1775
01:16:59,350 --> 01:17:00,520
Your bone won't heal soon.

1776
01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:02,519
It takes time for you to heal.

1777
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:03,988
You don't recover fast.

1778
01:17:03,989 --> 01:17:05,089
(I'll show you what the challenge is.)

1779
01:17:05,090 --> 01:17:06,760
Going for 85cm is so tough.

1780
01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:10,658
(JIAHN,)

1781
01:17:10,659 --> 01:17:12,229
(We trust you.)

1782
01:17:17,140 --> 01:17:18,639
(Trainee YU JIAHN of Team "Boom Boom Bass" fails.)

1783
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:19,710
It's all right.

1784
01:17:20,609 --> 01:17:22,640
It's all right.

1785
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:24,180
This is hard.

1786
01:17:24,579 --> 01:17:25,608
Let's go.

1787
01:17:25,609 --> 01:17:27,310
It's a little below the waistline.

1788
01:17:27,550 --> 01:17:28,550
Let's go.

1789
01:17:32,890 --> 01:17:35,920
(They get eliminated in a row without passing the height of 85cm.)

1790
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:39,590
This is too difficult.

1791
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:41,898
What are you doing?

1792
01:17:41,899 --> 01:17:43,158
(Trainee ASAKA KOTARO's turn)

1793
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:44,429
You can do it.

1794
01:17:44,430 --> 01:17:45,500
- No way. - You can do it.

1795
01:17:55,510 --> 01:17:57,739
- Good job. - Nice.

1796
01:17:58,050 --> 01:17:59,609
We're going to win.

1797
01:17:59,949 --> 01:18:01,380
Did everyone fail except KOTARO?

1798
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:04,250
He made it.

1799
01:18:04,890 --> 01:18:06,189
(Trainee KIM HYUNJAE is the last one to go.)

1800
01:18:06,250 --> 01:18:07,449
Only HYUNJAE remains.

1801
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:09,159
You're the only one left.

1802
01:18:10,659 --> 01:18:13,760
(If he fails, Team "Boom Boom Bass" will win.)

1803
01:18:16,529 --> 01:18:18,000
You're the only one left.

1804
01:18:19,829 --> 01:18:22,970
(HYUNJAE, please go through.)

1805
01:18:28,579 --> 01:18:29,609
(Did you see that?)

1806
01:18:30,939 --> 01:18:32,009
What was that?

1807
01:18:32,010 --> 01:18:33,079
(Unbelievable)

1808
01:18:33,149 --> 01:18:34,449
Good job.

1809
01:18:35,119 --> 01:18:36,948
- How is he so good? - What?

1810
01:18:36,949 --> 01:18:38,119
What's going on?

1811
01:18:38,689 --> 01:18:39,720
How?

1812
01:18:39,989 --> 01:18:41,189
Let's go.

1813
01:18:41,460 --> 01:18:43,219
- HEEJU. - HEEJU.

1814
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:44,760
(Touching)

1815
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:45,988
(Trainee CHAE HEEJU's knee touched the floor.)

1816
01:18:45,989 --> 01:18:47,188
He didn't make it.

1817
01:18:47,189 --> 01:18:48,698
HEEJU is eliminated.

1818
01:18:48,699 --> 01:18:49,759
(Trainee CHAE HEEJU is eliminated.)

1819
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:51,059
Good job.

1820
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:52,568
- Good work. - You worked hard.

1821
01:18:52,569 --> 01:18:54,028
(Trainee ASAKA KOTARO versus Trainee KIM HYUNJAE)

1822
01:18:54,029 --> 01:18:55,499
You look like a fairy against a fiend.

1823
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:56,669
They're really black and white.

1824
01:18:56,670 --> 01:18:59,270
(No one expected the two to remain.)

1825
01:18:59,569 --> 01:19:01,739
Our team's ace. Let's go, ballet dancer.

1826
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:04,408
One of them has done ballet, and the other hasn't.

1827
01:19:04,409 --> 01:19:06,380
- Right. - Right? That's impressive.

1828
01:19:07,350 --> 01:19:09,250
(Trying the height of 65cm)

1829
01:19:09,619 --> 01:19:11,319
I wouldn't be able to crawl under it.

1830
01:19:12,449 --> 01:19:13,519
Is this even possible?

1831
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:14,750
(Trainee ASAKA KOTARO gives a try.)

1832
01:19:15,789 --> 01:19:17,358
KOTARO, don't feel pressured.

1833
01:19:17,359 --> 01:19:18,630
It's okay to lose, so take your time.

1834
01:19:19,359 --> 01:19:20,789
It's okay to lose, so take your time.

1835
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:24,658
Let's go.

1836
01:19:24,659 --> 01:19:25,669
You must pass through it.

1837
01:19:25,670 --> 01:19:27,269
(Trainee ASAKA KOTARO is out.)

1838
01:19:27,270 --> 01:19:28,368
You must pass through it.

1839
01:19:28,369 --> 01:19:29,898
(That isn't easy.)

1840
01:19:29,899 --> 01:19:30,938
- You must pass through it. - You can do it.

1841
01:19:30,939 --> 01:19:32,010
Let's go.

1842
01:19:32,369 --> 01:19:34,369
You must make it.

1843
01:19:34,539 --> 01:19:36,510
You have to make it.

1844
01:19:37,109 --> 01:19:39,609
- KIM HYUNJAE - KIM HYUNJAE

1845
01:19:39,850 --> 01:19:42,148
- KIM HYUNJAE - Goodness.

1846
01:19:42,149 --> 01:19:43,720
(Extremely focused)

1847
01:19:43,979 --> 01:19:45,889
- KIM HYUNJAE - Goodness.

1848
01:19:45,890 --> 01:19:47,148
Please.

1849
01:19:47,149 --> 01:19:48,559
- KIM HYUNJAE - Please.

1850
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:49,720
- KIM HYUNJAE - Hey.

1851
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:52,359
KIM HYUNJAE

1852
01:19:53,430 --> 01:19:55,560
(Trainee KIM HYUNJAE made it.)

1853
01:20:00,829 --> 01:20:02,238
- Good job, KOTARO. - He nailed it.

1854
01:20:02,239 --> 01:20:03,639
- He's really good. - Good job.

1855
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:04,698
He's really good.

1856
01:20:04,699 --> 01:20:06,709
(Team "Memories" wins.)

1857
01:20:06,710 --> 01:20:07,770
He's really good.

1858
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:10,239
We're up next.

1859
01:20:10,510 --> 01:20:12,750
What should we do? We're so relaxed.

1860
01:20:12,810 --> 01:20:14,009
They're frightening.

1861
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:15,349
(Team "CASE 143" has many members with strong physiques.)

1862
01:20:15,350 --> 01:20:16,978
Don't lie. If not, it won't count.

1863
01:20:16,979 --> 01:20:19,119
- You're younger than ANDY. - You were born in 2008.

1864
01:20:20,989 --> 01:20:22,059
Arm wrestling?

1865
01:20:22,060 --> 01:20:23,060
(Arm wrestling)

1866
01:20:23,260 --> 01:20:25,158
(Joy)

1867
01:20:25,159 --> 01:20:26,329
This is the worst.

1868
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:29,960
CHANYONG, get up and show off your muscles.

1869
01:20:30,729 --> 01:20:32,398
CHANYONG, get up and show off your muscles.

1870
01:20:32,399 --> 01:20:34,829
(Muscle Man, Trainee PARK CHANYONG)

1871
01:20:35,939 --> 01:20:37,340
What do we do now?

1872
01:20:37,470 --> 01:20:39,239
How are we going to fight against them?

1873
01:20:39,439 --> 01:20:41,109
- There's a mountain in his arm. - There's a ball.

1874
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:43,609
There's a tennis ball in his arm.

1875
01:20:44,439 --> 01:20:45,550
The strongest on our team...

1876
01:20:45,850 --> 01:20:47,579
should play first.

1877
01:20:47,949 --> 01:20:49,250
Let's be strategic.

1878
01:20:49,420 --> 01:20:50,649
I'll go against...

1879
01:20:51,250 --> 01:20:52,350
their best player.

1880
01:20:52,689 --> 01:20:54,550
Since I'll be useless...

1881
01:20:55,119 --> 01:20:56,158
Are you bad at arm wrestling?

1882
01:20:56,159 --> 01:20:58,188
First player, please come out.

1883
01:20:58,189 --> 01:21:00,358
- Show them what you've got. - Let's go.

1884
01:21:00,359 --> 01:21:01,658
MINSEO is good at arm wrestling.

1885
01:21:01,659 --> 01:21:04,899
(KANG MINSEO versus JEON MINWOOK)

1886
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:09,438
This is serious.

1887
01:21:09,439 --> 01:21:10,569
Are you taking off your clothes?

1888
01:21:12,140 --> 01:21:13,710
(Showing off his muscles)

1889
01:21:14,140 --> 01:21:16,179
You train with a personal trainer.
Show us yours too.

1890
01:21:16,180 --> 01:21:17,579
(Embarrassed)

1891
01:21:17,710 --> 01:21:19,810
It'll be over soon, so I won't say much.

1892
01:21:23,149 --> 01:21:25,689
- MINWOOK. - Stay strong.

1893
01:21:25,989 --> 01:21:27,649
We came up with a strategy.

1894
01:21:28,090 --> 01:21:29,220
I'm a useless player.

1895
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:32,630
We won't waste energy on fights that we'll lose.

1896
01:21:33,090 --> 01:21:34,960
We'll win games where we have a chance.

1897
01:21:35,359 --> 01:21:36,399
He's a strategist.

1898
01:21:36,930 --> 01:21:38,159
Let's go, MINSEO.

1899
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,739
(The game starts.)

1900
01:21:45,170 --> 01:21:46,239
He's backing up.

(Shaking)

1903
01:21:52,149 --> 01:21:54,010
That's good, MINSEO.

1904
01:21:54,310 --> 01:21:55,680
That's good, MINSEO.

1905
01:21:57,920 --> 01:21:59,090
Look at his legs.

1906
01:22:00,119 --> 01:22:01,149
Look at his legs.

1907
01:22:01,319 --> 01:22:02,488
That's good, MINSEO.

1908
01:22:02,489 --> 01:22:04,460
(Making a last-ditch effort)

1909
01:22:05,489 --> 01:22:07,590
- Look at his legs. - It's neck and neck.

1910

- This is... - No, MINWOOK.

1911

(No, MINWOOK...)

1912
01:22:12,130 --> 01:22:14,130
- No, MINWOOK. - We won.

1913
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:17,340
He was really useless.

1914
01:22:17,939 --> 01:22:19,438
- Nice. - Good job.

1915
01:22:19,439 --> 01:22:20,709

01:22:34,149 --> 01:22:37,560
(Quietly discouraging his opponent)

1923
01:22:40,289 --> 01:22:41,630

He's older, and he'll show it to him.

1926
01:22:45,270 --> 01:22:46,500
Is SEYUN older than him?

1927
01:22:47,729 --> 01:22:49,840
(You can go easy on me so that I don't get hurt.)

1928
01:22:50,170 --> 01:22:52,340
You can go easy on me so that I don't get hurt.

1929
01:22:53,539 --> 01:22:54,869
SEYUN, you can do it.

1930
01:22:54,909 --> 01:22:57,010
- It's okay, SEYUN. - Let's go.

1931

Get ready.

1948
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:56,039
(PARK JUNSEO and SONG SEUNGHO are standing face to face.)

1949
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:02,210
(Smiling)

1950
01:24:02,409 --> 01:24:03,409
(Struggling)

1951
01:24:03,410 --> 01:24:04,539
Oh, no.

1952
01:24:04,609 --> 01:24:06,109
No.

1953
01:24:10,220 --> 01:24:12,550
(Team "CASE 143": 2, Team "LALALALA": 1)

1954
01:24:14,449 --> 01:24:16,260
Who wants to go next?

1955
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:18,629
YEOJUN, you should play.

1956
01:24:18,630 --> 01:24:20,359
I doubt that I'll make it fun to watch.

1957
01:24:20,890 --> 01:24:23,000
- Okay. - Go and play against him.

1958
01:24:23,060 --> 01:24:24,130
Okay.

1959
01:24:33,239 --> 01:24:36,079
(Muscle Man PARK CHANYONG appears.)

1960
01:24:39,010 --> 01:24:41,109
- It's CHANYONG. - Do it one more time.

1961
01:24:41,949 --> 01:24:44,720
(Showing off his muscles)

1962
01:24:48,119 --> 01:24:49,920
(Crying)

1963
01:24:50,020 --> 01:24:52,488
- Show us. - No one is cheering for me.

1964
01:24:52,489 --> 01:24:53,529
Look forward to it.

1965
01:24:53,630 --> 01:24:55,630
- You can do it. - Okay.

1966
01:24:56,260 --> 01:24:58,229
- You can do it. - It'll be a quick game.

1967
01:24:58,699 --> 01:24:59,829
Get ready.

1968
01:25:00,270 --> 01:25:02,239
(Look at his blood vessels.)

1969
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:03,840
- Look at his blood vessels. - His arm.

1970
01:25:04,899 --> 01:25:06,269
- Look at his arm. - Goodness.

1971
01:25:06,270 --> 01:25:08,369
Something is wrong with him.

1972
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:10,009
He's blaming the innocent guy.

1973
01:25:10,010 --> 01:25:11,180
"Something is wrong?"

1974
01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:12,680
Is there a problem?

1975
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:15,180
Get ready, set, go.

1976
01:25:16,649 --> 01:25:19,390
(Surprisingly, the game is neck and neck.)

1977
01:25:21,350 --> 01:25:23,319
Hey, CHANYONG.

1978
01:25:23,819 --> 01:25:25,060
Hey, CHANYONG.

1979
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:33,829
Show us what we've been waiting for.

1980
01:25:41,439 --> 01:25:42,439
(Team "CASE 143": 3, Team "LALALALA": 1)

1981
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:45,180
(Match point)

1982
01:25:45,710 --> 01:25:47,649
- It's the last round. - You should go.

1983
01:25:48,850 --> 01:25:50,079
Goodness.

1984
01:25:51,149 --> 01:25:52,350
SIHUN.

1985
01:25:52,590 --> 01:25:54,020
This will be a real fight.

1986
01:25:54,489 --> 01:25:55,859
It will be neck and neck for real.

1987
01:25:57,090 --> 01:25:59,060
Goodness, they look very weak.

1988
01:26:00,729 --> 01:26:03,899
(A match between the official weak players on PROJECT 7)

1989
01:26:05,029 --> 01:26:06,300
They've seen it somewhere.

1990
01:26:08,369 --> 01:26:10,239
It's impossible to lose unless it's an accident.

1991
01:26:10,399 --> 01:26:12,210
Get ready, set, go.

1992
01:26:13,609 --> 01:26:15,438
(A big match where it's hard to tell who's better)

1993
01:26:15,439 --> 01:26:16,909
It's impossible to lose unless it's an accident.

1994
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:21,810
Endure it.

1995
01:26:22,119 --> 01:26:23,919
Endure it.

1996
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:25,119
(Make an accident happen.)

1997
01:26:25,619 --> 01:26:26,890
All right!

1998
01:26:28,689 --> 01:26:30,260
(KIM SIHUN is the winner of the weakest match.)

1999
01:26:30,590 --> 01:26:31,618
(He officially becomes the weakest.)

2000
01:26:31,619 --> 01:26:33,329
(Even his ears turn red.)

2001
01:26:34,390 --> 01:26:36,899
(Team "CASE 143" wins.)

2002
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:39,369
Team "CASE 143" is the winner.

2003
01:26:41,670 --> 01:26:44,169
(A5 decides which team will go first.)

2004
01:26:44,170 --> 01:26:45,539
- Okay. - What is it?

2005
01:26:46,270 --> 01:26:47,340
Shoving Hands.

2006
01:26:47,609 --> 01:26:48,840
Shoving Hands?

2007
01:26:49,140 --> 01:26:51,739
The first round was so much fun. Will we be as fun as they are?

2008
01:26:52,779 --> 01:26:54,448
- You'd better win. - I'm weak.

2009
01:26:54,449 --> 01:26:56,448
(Round 1 starts.)

2010
01:26:56,449 --> 01:26:57,819
Let's do it fast.

2011
01:26:58,079 --> 01:26:59,489
You can do it.

2012
01:27:00,786 --> 01:27:01,832
Like a man,

2013
01:27:02,193 --> 01:27:04,890
I'll push you hard only once. Bring it on.

2014
01:27:06,659 --> 01:27:11,359
You'd better not do that because...

2015
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:14,170
I didn't wash my hands after using the restroom.

2016
01:27:19,869 --> 01:27:21,010
He's so funny.

2017
01:27:21,510 --> 01:27:22,779
Like this?

2018
01:27:23,409 --> 01:27:24,439
Like this?

2019
01:27:24,539 --> 01:27:26,050
YUSEI is an idol singer.

2020
01:27:26,510 --> 01:27:27,779
You're an idol singer.

2021
01:27:28,210 --> 01:27:30,079
HYOJIN has to push him off in one go.

2022
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:44,060
Good job.

2023
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:46,269
Come out, JIHOON.

2024
01:27:46,270 --> 01:27:47,399
- What? - What?

2025
01:27:49,399 --> 01:27:51,039
Go out.

2026
01:27:51,170 --> 01:27:52,609
It's O versus M.

2027
01:27:53,569 --> 01:27:54,670
In the count of three?

2028
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:55,840
One, two.

2029
01:27:57,880 --> 01:27:59,279
AOM is so tough.

2030
01:27:59,350 --> 01:28:00,380
One, two, three.

2031
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:04,949
(Both of his feet come off first.)

2032
01:28:10,489 --> 01:28:11,789
I thought that he lost.

2033
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:13,829
- Good work. - Your friend.

2034
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:16,229
It's a battle between dancers.

2035
01:28:18,529 --> 01:28:20,100
He must be having fun.

2036
01:28:20,569 --> 01:28:23,000
(Giggling)

2037
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:24,599
Go away.

2038
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:26,069
What are they doing?

2039
01:28:28,210 --> 01:28:29,880
(Team "Deja Vu": 2, Team "I'll See You There Tomorrow": 1)

2040
01:28:30,310 --> 01:28:32,250
(KWON YEUNG versus KIM JOONWOO)

2041
01:28:32,350 --> 01:28:35,350
Why are your hands so thick?

2042
01:28:37,649 --> 01:28:39,449
Why are your hands so thick?

2043
01:28:42,590 --> 01:28:44,390
What did he say?

2044
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:47,229
- I know. - I won.

2045
01:28:47,260 --> 01:28:49,629
He talked about his hands.

2046
01:28:49,630 --> 01:28:51,858
He totally distracted me.

2047
01:28:51,859 --> 01:28:52,999
- Hey. - This is fun.

2048
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,069
It's like watching TV.

2049
01:28:55,470 --> 01:28:57,600
(Who will play next?)

2050
01:28:59,909 --> 01:29:02,579
(A big match is expected.)

2051
01:29:03,010 --> 01:29:05,109
(Trainee WU CHENYU and LEE EUNSUH appear.)

2052
01:29:05,310 --> 01:29:07,449
We aren't lovers.

2053
01:29:08,409 --> 01:29:09,949
We aren't in a relationship.

2054
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:12,350
"We aren't in a relationship."

2055
01:29:14,649 --> 01:29:16,590
There it is again.

2056
01:29:17,189 --> 01:29:18,760
Don't push me into a corner.

2057
01:29:20,630 --> 01:29:22,560
I'm so curious about the result.

2058
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:25,970
Get ready, set, go.

2059
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:32,810
- Yes. - Push him off.

2060
01:29:33,140 --> 01:29:35,140
Is it okay to win once?

2061
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:40,250
I didn't know that it was CHENYU.

2062
01:29:41,779 --> 01:29:44,350
(He asks for a time-out.)

2063
01:29:46,590 --> 01:29:47,720
I love you, EUNSUH.

2064
01:29:57,699 --> 01:29:59,729
(Team "Deja Vu" wins the game to determine who goes first.)

2065
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:01,630
He made it.

2066
01:30:02,399 --> 01:30:05,000
(The passionate game to determine who goes first ends.)

2067
01:30:05,810 --> 01:30:08,170
The 2nd Passing Ceremony on PROJECT 7.

2068
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:11,738
Between A3 and A4, which team passed is...

2069
01:30:11,739 --> 01:30:13,278
yet to be announced.

2070
01:30:13,279 --> 01:30:15,149
(The result for A3 and A4 remains.)

2071
01:30:15,550 --> 01:30:16,949
Who could it be? Is it us?

2072
01:30:18,319 --> 01:30:19,550
Will it be NCT?

2073
01:30:21,090 --> 01:30:24,220
The next team to present is A4.

2074
01:30:26,359 --> 01:30:28,390
- Let's go. - Let's go, NCT.

2075
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:29,960
It's finally here.

2076
01:30:33,229 --> 01:30:34,569
Are we going last again?

2077
01:30:34,630 --> 01:30:35,670
Good luck.

2078
01:30:36,399 --> 01:30:38,869
Many of them have a chance of getting highly ranked.

2079
01:30:40,239 --> 01:30:41,608
None of you should come back.

2080
01:30:41,609 --> 01:30:42,779
Just sit over there.

2081
01:30:43,239 --> 01:30:46,609
A4 sang a song by NCT in the competition.

2082
01:30:46,710 --> 01:30:48,179
Team "TOUCH" showed...

2083
01:30:48,180 --> 01:30:51,079
a lot of their lovely and cute side.

2084
01:30:57,220 --> 01:31:00,629
Team "Make A Wish" presented a powerful performance.

2085
01:31:00,630 --> 01:31:02,199
(The powerful performance by Team "Make A Wish" stood out.)

2086
01:31:05,199 --> 01:31:07,270
Between two teams in the NCT match,

2087
01:31:07,829 --> 01:31:09,239
Team "Make A Wish" won...

2088
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:14,770
- by a wide margin of 411 votes. - Well done.

2089
01:31:16,939 --> 01:31:18,010
You punks.

2090
01:31:19,550 --> 01:31:20,949
I'll announce...

2091
01:31:21,409 --> 01:31:24,020
the trainees who passed from Team NCT.

2092
01:31:30,319 --> 01:31:32,328
All the seats in the middle row...

2093
01:31:32,329 --> 01:31:33,760
will be filled.

2094
01:31:35,699 --> 01:31:37,529
Seat 8, 9, 10, and 11 will be taken.

2095
01:31:41,229 --> 01:31:44,939
I didn't expect him to call out names from Team "TOUCH."

2096
01:31:45,369 --> 01:31:49,079
Many of the trainees in the other team were highly ranked.

2097
01:31:50,239 --> 01:31:51,908
Many will be from the high rank.

2098
01:31:51,909 --> 01:31:55,920
(Will the result be what they expect?)

2099
01:31:57,420 --> 01:31:59,289
The place I'll announce...

2100
01:32:00,350 --> 01:32:02,489
is close to making his debut.

2101
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:04,590
The tenth place.

2102
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:08,260
(The 2nd Passing Ceremony, 10th place)

2103
01:32:08,489 --> 01:32:09,659
The tenth place?

2104
01:32:10,300 --> 01:32:11,399
YICHEN?

2105
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:13,130
- YICHEN? - YICHEN?

2106
01:32:13,729 --> 01:32:15,029
I was very nervous.

2107
01:32:15,369 --> 01:32:18,469
I really hoped that I'd be...

2108
01:32:18,470 --> 01:32:19,710
ranked higher.

2109
01:32:20,369 --> 01:32:21,938
No, could it be NAM JIWOON?

2110
01:32:21,939 --> 01:32:23,908
Right, there's NAM JIWOON.

2111
01:32:23,909 --> 01:32:25,180
- JIWOON? - JIWOON?

2112
01:32:25,909 --> 01:32:28,978
Only up the seventh place...

2113
01:32:28,979 --> 01:32:30,550
will make his debut.

2114
01:32:30,720 --> 01:32:32,789
I didn't want my rank to go down.

2115
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:35,989
The trainee who placed tenth...

2116
01:32:36,319 --> 01:32:38,390
has a matchless character...

2117
01:32:38,930 --> 01:32:40,659
of his own.

2118
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:43,299
- Is it ANDY? - ANDY?

2119
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:44,600
- ANDY? - It could be ANDY.

2120
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:46,300
ANDY?

2121
01:32:46,301 --> 01:32:47,500
(29th, Trainee ANDY)

2122
01:32:47,899 --> 01:32:49,199
"Matchless?"

2123
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:51,539
I didn't know that JUNWON ranked that high.

2124
01:32:52,170 --> 01:32:54,209
- He has a likable character. - That's true.

2125
01:32:54,210 --> 01:32:55,439
(11th, AHN JUNWON)

2126
01:32:55,810 --> 01:32:58,908
He continues to rank higher.

2127
01:32:58,909 --> 01:33:01,710
His ranking keeps going up.

2128
01:33:02,420 --> 01:33:04,579
- JUNWON. - It's JUNWON.

2129
01:33:04,979 --> 01:33:06,819
Which place was JUNWON in before?

2130
01:33:08,390 --> 01:33:09,760
His global voting score is...

2131
01:33:10,189 --> 01:33:15,390
1,427,410 points.

2132
01:33:16,899 --> 01:33:20,068
It's Trainee AHN JUNWON.

2133
01:33:20,069 --> 01:33:24,499
(10th, Trainee AHN JUNWON)

2134
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:25,710
Congratulations.

2135
01:33:25,810 --> 01:33:28,038
- You placed tenth. - All right.

2136
01:33:28,039 --> 01:33:29,840
- Good work. - You placed tenth.

2137
01:33:30,079 --> 01:33:31,310
Did JUNWON place that high?

2138
01:33:32,850 --> 01:33:34,079
He keeps going up.

2139
01:33:34,909 --> 01:33:37,478
While practicing for Rival Matching,

2140
01:33:37,479 --> 01:33:39,720
Trainee AHN JUNWON listened to his teammates' feedback.

2141
01:33:40,220 --> 01:33:41,788
To make up for what he lacked,

2142
01:33:41,789 --> 01:33:44,760
he stayed behind the training room every day to practice more.

2143
01:33:45,060 --> 01:33:47,390
As a result, his team won.

2144
01:33:47,894 --> 01:33:50,405
From Team Black's KIM TAEYU,

2145
01:33:50,430 --> 01:33:54,199
he took 20,000 points.

2146
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:56,569
With his consistent effort,

2147
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:59,639
he was recognized by World Assemblers.

2148
01:33:59,640 --> 01:34:00,710
Congratulations.

2149
01:34:02,170 --> 01:34:04,779
- Salute. - Salute!

2150
01:34:06,350 --> 01:34:09,050
Guys, where will I sit now?

2151
01:34:09,250 --> 01:34:11,479
- You lost your seat. - This is terrible.

2152
01:34:13,420 --> 01:34:15,489
Here's another trainee in the high rank.

2153
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:19,159
I'll announce who placed 12th.

2154
01:34:20,329 --> 01:34:21,829
(The 2nd Passing Ceremony, 12th place)

2155
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:24,260
Twelfth place? There are so many in the high rank.

2156
01:34:25,159 --> 01:34:26,229
Who could it be?

2157
01:34:27,829 --> 01:34:29,739
Isn't it either YICHEN or JIWOON?

2158
01:34:31,069 --> 01:34:33,810
I feel like getting farther away from making a debut.

2159
01:34:34,640 --> 01:34:36,179
I felt scared.

2160
01:34:36,180 --> 01:34:37,180
(14th, YICHEN)

2161
01:34:37,510 --> 01:34:41,249
My name has to be called next.

2162
01:34:41,250 --> 01:34:42,579
(7th, NAM JIWOON)

2163
01:34:43,079 --> 01:34:45,350
The trainee who placed 12th...

2164
01:34:45,479 --> 01:34:48,519
tends to be brutal with his words.

2165
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:51,590
(A trainee who's brutal with his words)

2166
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:54,359
Get out. Go home.

2167
01:34:57,930 --> 01:34:59,000
It must be YICHEN.

2168
01:34:59,670 --> 01:35:00,699
Go, 12th place.

2169
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:02,670
Go home.

2170
01:35:03,539 --> 01:35:06,608
When it comes to caring about his teammates,

2171
01:35:06,609 --> 01:35:08,069
- "Get out?" - he's number one.

2172
01:35:09,739 --> 01:35:11,180
His global voting score is...

2173
01:35:11,835 --> 01:35:16,350
1,328,922 points.

2174
01:35:17,279 --> 01:35:18,479
It's Trainee YICHEN.

2175
01:35:19,319 --> 01:35:20,989
Congratulations.

2176
01:35:21,050 --> 01:35:23,389
- Get out, YICHEN. - Hey, get out.

2177
01:35:23,390 --> 01:35:24,858
Trainee YICHEN led his teammates...

2178
01:35:24,859 --> 01:35:27,390
while seeing from their perspective.

2179
01:35:27,590 --> 01:35:30,060
He definitely grew as a leader.

2180
01:35:30,699 --> 01:35:33,899
Thanks to his struggle and leading his team well,

2181
01:35:34,199 --> 01:35:36,439
his team won the Rival Matching.

2182
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:38,739
He took 50,000 points...

2183
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,739
from the opposing team.

2184
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:45,909
Next, I'll announce...

2185
01:35:47,180 --> 01:35:49,720
the 16th place.

2186
01:35:51,149 --> 01:35:55,520
(The 2nd Passing Ceremony, 16th place)

2187
01:35:56,090 --> 01:35:57,260
All of them ranked high.

2188
01:35:58,619 --> 01:35:59,890
Why did all of them rank high?

2189
01:36:00,989 --> 01:36:03,060
With his unique and clear voice,

2190
01:36:03,199 --> 01:36:06,300
he's responsible for the eardrums...

2191
01:36:06,430 --> 01:36:07,800
of World Assemblers.

2192
01:36:09,140 --> 01:36:10,269
A clear voice?

2193
01:36:10,270 --> 01:36:12,000
- YOUNGSEO? - Really?

2194
01:36:12,100 --> 01:36:13,909
- It must be YOUNGSEO. - It's YOUNGSEO.

2195
01:36:15,239 --> 01:36:16,680
It definitely sounds like YOUNGSEO.

2196
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:20,078
No, it's TAEHWAN.

2197
01:36:20,079 --> 01:36:22,310
- It could be TAEHWAN. - It's definitely TAEHWAN.

2198
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:24,649
(34th, OH TAEHWAN)

2199
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:29,319
His global voting score...

2200
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:32,119
is 1,232,645 points.

2201
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:34,829
Who could it be?

2202
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:36,828
It's Trainee YOO YOUNGSEO.

2203
01:36:36,829 --> 01:36:40,528
(16th, YOO YOUNGSEO)

2204
01:36:40,529 --> 01:36:41,970
YOUNGSEO.

2205
01:36:42,170 --> 01:36:43,599
- YOUNGSEO. - Congratulations.

2206
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:44,600
Congratulations.

2207
01:36:44,601 --> 01:36:45,699
- Hey. - Congratulations.

2208
01:36:46,310 --> 01:36:47,970
Congratulations, YOUNGSEO.

2209
01:36:48,970 --> 01:36:52,379
For his gentle way of talking and overpowering vocal skills,

2210
01:36:52,380 --> 01:36:55,479
he's very popular among the trainees.

2211
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:58,179
During the Rival Matching, he was a reliable member...

2212
01:36:58,180 --> 01:37:00,489
- Good job. - who gave vocal lessons...

2213
01:37:00,989 --> 01:37:02,350
and helped with the choreography.

2214
01:37:02,819 --> 01:37:04,219
He contributed a lot...

2215
01:37:04,220 --> 01:37:06,260
to improving his teammates' skills.

2216
01:37:06,489 --> 01:37:07,729
Well done.

2217
01:37:08,930 --> 01:37:12,029
We look forward to seeing his surprising charms...

2218
01:37:12,399 --> 01:37:13,729
in the next project.

2219
01:37:15,970 --> 01:37:17,439
Next, I'll announce...

2220
01:37:18,300 --> 01:37:20,210
the 18th place.

2221
01:37:21,810 --> 01:37:26,210
(The 2nd Passing Ceremony, 18th)

2222
01:37:26,850 --> 01:37:27,949
I was ranked 18th.

2223
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:33,350
We've had members of Team "Make A Wish" pass in a row.

2224
01:37:34,189 --> 01:37:36,920
From which team will the survivor be this time?

2225
01:37:38,159 --> 01:37:39,489
What if TAEHWAN's name is suddenly called?

2226
01:37:39,960 --> 01:37:40,960
(34th, OH TAEHWAN, during the 5th week)

2227
01:37:40,961 --> 01:37:42,930
TAEHWAN's name may be called.

2228
01:37:44,460 --> 01:37:46,329
This survivor is...

2229
01:37:46,529 --> 01:37:48,799
always bright and cheerful.

2230
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:49,898
ANDY?

2231
01:37:49,899 --> 01:37:53,538
He's one of the youngest trainees adored by the older trainees.

2232
01:37:53,539 --> 01:37:55,010
(One of the youngest trainees with a bright personality)

2233
01:37:55,369 --> 01:37:58,310
- ANDY. - ANDY.

2234
01:37:59,750 --> 01:38:04,020
I was ranked 22nd, and I received benefit points too.

2235
01:38:04,350 --> 01:38:06,420
I may get to be ranked higher.

2236
01:38:07,649 --> 01:38:09,420
- It may be SOTA. - It may be SOTA.

2237
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:11,819
Oh, SOTA?

2238
01:38:14,260 --> 01:38:17,100
(27th, FUKUYAMA SOTA, during the 5th week)

2239
01:38:17,359 --> 01:38:22,430
He received a global voting score of 1,041,670.

2240
01:38:24,140 --> 01:38:25,738
It's Trainee ANDY. Congratulations.

2241
01:38:25,739 --> 01:38:30,609
(Trainee ANDY is ranked 18th.)

2242
01:38:31,180 --> 01:38:32,380
He jumped only a little.

2243
01:38:32,579 --> 01:38:33,579
He refrained himself.

2244
01:38:35,079 --> 01:38:37,849
Trainee ANDY challenged himself to be a center lead rapper,

2245
01:38:37,850 --> 01:38:41,250
but he failed all his attempts which brought him to tears.

2246
01:38:41,649 --> 01:38:43,359
However, during the interim evaluation,

2247
01:38:43,689 --> 01:38:47,260
the directors highly praised him for being a proven center material.

2248
01:38:47,359 --> 01:38:50,100
In the end, he managed to seize the center position.

2249
01:38:51,260 --> 01:38:55,130
(He managed to seize the center position.)

2250
01:38:55,430 --> 01:38:59,510
During this Passing Ceremony, he gets to survive...

2251
01:38:59,739 --> 01:39:00,970
in the stable place of 18th.

2252
01:39:04,180 --> 01:39:05,679
Moving on.

2253
01:39:05,680 --> 01:39:09,210
(What's the next rank?)

2254
01:39:09,949 --> 01:39:11,149
It's the 27th.

2255
01:39:11,680 --> 01:39:13,619
(The 2nd Passing Ceremony, 27th)

2256
01:39:13,989 --> 01:39:16,619
It's the last remaining rank in the 20s.

2257
01:39:17,859 --> 01:39:19,220
All the ranks are taken except for the 35th.

2258
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:22,329
This survivor...

2259
01:39:23,199 --> 01:39:27,728
is a trainee from Team "TOUCH."

2260
01:39:27,729 --> 01:39:29,199
- It's TAEHWAN. - TAEHWAN.

2261
01:39:30,100 --> 01:39:31,739
It might be TAEHWAN.

2262
01:39:32,539 --> 01:39:36,310
I was ranked 34th and close to getting eliminated.

2263
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:39,549
I had no idea about my survival,

2264
01:39:39,550 --> 01:39:41,149
which made me even more nervous.

2265
01:39:42,050 --> 01:39:43,520
This trainee finally...

2266
01:39:43,979 --> 01:39:47,189
showed his true charm during the Rival Matching.

2267
01:39:48,420 --> 01:39:49,520
TAEYU?

2268
01:39:50,460 --> 01:39:51,560
TAEYU?

2269
01:39:51,789 --> 01:39:53,760
- He finally showed his cute charm. - Stop. It hurts.

2270
01:39:55,260 --> 01:39:58,199
(TAEYU tried out for an innocent and cute style for the first time.)

2271
01:40:00,329 --> 01:40:01,600
It certainly was a true charm.

2272
01:40:02,199 --> 01:40:04,970
I'm ranked 38th, and it's not safe from elimination.

2273
01:40:05,439 --> 01:40:06,739
But who knows?

2274
01:40:07,670 --> 01:40:08,970
This trainee received...

2275
01:40:09,239 --> 01:40:12,750
a global voting score of 509,490.

2276
01:40:17,050 --> 01:40:20,118
It's Trainee OH TAEHWAN.

2277
01:40:20,119 --> 01:40:24,759
(27th, Trainee OH TAEHWAN)

2278
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:26,059
- Good job. - Congratulations.

2279
01:40:26,060 --> 01:40:27,359
- Good job. - Well done.

2280
01:40:29,029 --> 01:40:31,760
During the Rival Matching, Trainee OH TAEHWAN...

2281
01:40:32,359 --> 01:40:35,600
seized the lead vocalist position and showed off his true charms.

2282
01:40:35,670 --> 01:40:37,100
- Good job. - Hey.

2283
01:40:37,439 --> 01:40:38,699
I told you yesterday...

2284
01:40:39,059 --> 01:40:40,458
to go up together.

2285
01:40:41,569 --> 01:40:43,340
Right, one of us made it.

2286
01:40:43,680 --> 01:40:45,640
Thanks to World Assemblers' support,

2287
01:40:45,810 --> 01:40:48,778
he gets to continue with his challenge...

2288
01:40:48,779 --> 01:40:50,849
despite the point deduction.

2289
01:40:50,850 --> 01:40:51,880
Congratulations.

2290
01:40:53,590 --> 01:40:54,619
Good job.

2291
01:40:58,760 --> 01:41:02,260
The next survivor of A4 is...

2292
01:41:03,448 --> 01:41:04,607
No one.

2293
01:41:06,280 --> 01:41:07,329
No one.

2294
01:41:09,029 --> 01:41:10,170
No one.

2295
01:41:19,680 --> 01:41:22,710
(Trainee OH TAEHWAN is the only survivor of Team "TOUCH.")

2296
01:41:23,020 --> 01:41:25,680
There are a total of five survivors in A4.

2297
01:41:26,750 --> 01:41:31,520
I was so eager to perform at least one more time.

2298
01:41:32,720 --> 01:41:36,599
I'm truly grateful to World Assemblers...

2299
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:39,670
for giving me another chance to perform on stage.

2300
01:41:40,270 --> 01:41:41,869
Team "TOUCH" actually...

2301
01:41:42,270 --> 01:41:46,069
let me do a lot of parts in the performance.

2302
01:41:46,439 --> 01:41:49,140
I believe this result is also thanks to them.

2303
01:41:49,680 --> 01:41:51,840
I'm really grateful to the teammates.

2304
01:41:53,109 --> 01:41:55,909
I was the youngest member of Team "Make A Wish,"

2305
01:41:56,520 --> 01:41:59,119
but the teammates let me take charge of the important center position.

2306
01:41:59,550 --> 01:42:02,149
I'm grateful that they counted on me.

2307
01:42:02,920 --> 01:42:04,220
I love you guys.

2308
01:42:09,560 --> 01:42:10,760
Goodness.

2309
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:12,729
- ANDY. - Gosh.

2310
01:42:13,930 --> 01:42:16,069
Don't cry.

2311
01:42:19,539 --> 01:42:20,670
SOTA.

2312
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:33,420
(ANDY and SOTA were best friends.)

2313
01:42:38,420 --> 01:42:41,689
I can't believe I have to keep telling you.

2314
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:43,199
I'm getting tired of it.

2315
01:42:44,430 --> 01:42:47,229
I really can't stand it. We'll be eliminated for real at this rate.

2316
01:42:53,140 --> 01:42:54,770
I'm so sorry...

2317
01:42:55,869 --> 01:42:59,010
I often got mad at you when we practiced.

2318
01:43:04,550 --> 01:43:07,788
KENSHIN and I will do the best we can...

2319
01:43:07,789 --> 01:43:09,020
for your sake, SOTA.

2320
01:43:12,090 --> 01:43:14,460
Please support us lots.

2321
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:25,039
I'm happy that I get to join the next performance.

2322
01:43:28,609 --> 01:43:29,739
I want to present an awesome performance...

2323
01:43:30,109 --> 01:43:33,079
with a bigger sense of confidence.

2324
01:43:38,020 --> 01:43:40,349
The 35th place isn't taken yet.

2325
01:43:40,350 --> 01:43:41,420
You still have a chance.

2326
01:43:43,489 --> 01:43:45,289
Being part of PROJECT 7,

2327
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:47,659
I've learned so much.

2328
01:43:48,390 --> 01:43:52,130
And I've been inspired a lot...

2329
01:43:52,729 --> 01:43:54,699
by the fellow trainees here.

2330
01:43:56,569 --> 01:43:59,270
I'll try harder...

2331
01:44:00,539 --> 01:44:03,408
so that each and every vote for me...

2332
01:44:03,409 --> 01:44:04,909
was worth it.

2333
01:44:05,640 --> 01:44:08,478
I'll give all my might to achieve...

2334
01:44:08,479 --> 01:44:12,079
my goal and dream no matter what.

2335
01:44:12,380 --> 01:44:14,149
I always have this in mind.

2336
01:44:14,890 --> 01:44:16,890
My position right now...

2337
01:44:17,119 --> 01:44:20,259
isn't thanks to my skills.

2338
01:44:20,260 --> 01:44:22,960
I'm aware that I'm hardly good enough.

2339
01:44:23,199 --> 01:44:25,560
That I need to make more effort...

2340
01:44:25,800 --> 01:44:27,899
and do the best I can.

2341
01:44:28,529 --> 01:44:32,600
I'll keep doing my best also for TAEYU.

2342
01:44:32,869 --> 01:44:36,909
I know that 20,000 is a big number.

2343
01:44:37,210 --> 01:44:40,310
I'll try harder to keep making good results.

2344
01:44:44,350 --> 01:44:47,020
I'm glad that it's at least JUNWON...

2345
01:44:47,890 --> 01:44:49,119
who took those points from me.

2346
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:53,829
By taking the points from me,

2347
01:44:54,260 --> 01:44:57,600
he managed to place the highest among the two-digit ranks.

2348
01:44:57,800 --> 01:45:01,500
I'm thinking he may get to be within the one-digit ranks...

2349
01:45:01,829 --> 01:45:03,270
in the next round.

2350
01:45:09,979 --> 01:45:12,380
I'd like to say good job to everyone. Thank you.

2351
01:45:21,550 --> 01:45:23,220
There's no need to cry.

2352
01:45:23,590 --> 01:45:25,390
Don't cry.

2353
01:45:38,369 --> 01:45:39,470
Good.

2354
01:45:40,170 --> 01:45:41,709
I get to sit next to you.

2355
01:45:41,710 --> 01:45:43,609
Gosh, thank you.

2356
01:46:00,489 --> 01:46:02,760
(Now, there are only 16 seats left.)

2357
01:46:02,859 --> 01:46:05,260
The Second Passing Ceremony of PROJECT 7.

2358
01:46:05,529 --> 01:46:08,069
Currently, there are...

2359
01:46:08,399 --> 01:46:09,939
a total of 16 remaining seats.

2360
01:46:11,439 --> 01:46:13,640
My hands feel cold.

2361
01:46:15,170 --> 01:46:16,409
There's one team left.

2362
01:46:19,109 --> 01:46:21,649
Let me announce the survival results...

2363
01:46:23,010 --> 01:46:25,050
of the last A3 trainees.

2364
01:46:25,449 --> 01:46:27,449
Of the last A3 trainees.

2365
01:46:27,550 --> 01:46:28,949
- I'll be back. - Don't come back.

2366
01:46:29,859 --> 01:46:31,020
You should be there.

2367
01:46:31,119 --> 01:46:34,028
A3, please all come up to the podium.

2368
01:46:34,029 --> 01:46:35,389
I'm off. See you.

2369
01:46:35,390 --> 01:46:36,560
(It's time to announce the results of A3.)

2370
01:46:38,159 --> 01:46:40,329
Go, YURA. You can do it.

2371
01:46:41,300 --> 01:46:43,368
A3 is a group...

2372
01:46:43,369 --> 01:46:46,469
with a lot of high-ranked trainees assembled in it.

2373
01:46:46,470 --> 01:46:49,569
They competed with the songs by Stray Kids.

2374
01:46:50,340 --> 01:46:52,810
Both teams perfectly pulled off their performances...

2375
01:46:53,180 --> 01:46:55,608
and received credit from World Assemblers.

2376
01:46:55,609 --> 01:47:00,318
("LALALALA" by Team White)

2377
01:47:00,319 --> 01:47:03,889
Team "LALALALA" became the winner of the match.

2378
01:47:03,890 --> 01:47:04,960
(Team "CASE 143": 176, Team "LALALALA": 365)

2379
01:47:07,029 --> 01:47:08,960
This group is so competitive indeed.

2380
01:47:09,489 --> 01:47:11,399
All of A3 might survive.

2381
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,099
(18th, ABE YURA, during the 5th week)

2382
01:47:13,100 --> 01:47:14,899
This group might pass as a whole.

2383
01:47:15,399 --> 01:47:16,599
(10th, BINGHUA, during the 5th week)

2384
01:47:16,600 --> 01:47:19,000
The trainees took and lost global voting points.

2385
01:47:19,239 --> 01:47:22,109
I wonder how it affected the final survival results.

2386
01:47:22,739 --> 01:47:26,310
Let me reveal the results now.

2387
01:47:27,109 --> 01:47:28,448
I feel so nervous.

2388
01:47:28,449 --> 01:47:30,279
My heart is beating so fast.

2389
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:32,949
I felt like I was sent to the guillotine.

2390
01:47:33,050 --> 01:47:34,649
It was either survival or elimination.

2391
01:47:35,189 --> 01:47:38,489
I was dying to survive.

2392
01:47:39,319 --> 01:47:42,358
I got my 60,000 benefit points taken away,

2393
01:47:42,359 --> 01:47:45,100
so I felt very anxious and nervous.

2394
01:47:45,359 --> 01:47:47,199
I was ranked sixth previously,

2395
01:47:47,229 --> 01:47:51,139
but I was worried I might be ranked...

2396
01:47:51,140 --> 01:47:53,810
lower than the top debut ranks.

2397
01:47:54,270 --> 01:47:56,840
The rank of the 1st survivor in A3...

2398
01:47:58,039 --> 01:47:59,539
is 21st.

2399
01:48:00,380 --> 01:48:02,310
The 21st-place trainee...

2400
01:48:02,409 --> 01:48:04,819
is said to give such a bright energy...

2401
01:48:05,680 --> 01:48:07,090
among the older trainees.

2402
01:48:08,649 --> 01:48:09,720
SEUNGHO?

2403
01:48:12,420 --> 01:48:13,590
It might be our SEYUN.

2404
01:48:14,390 --> 01:48:15,560
SEYUN is cheerful.

2405
01:48:18,199 --> 01:48:19,229
It's SEYUN.

2406
01:48:19,478 --> 01:48:20,655
This trainee received...

2407
01:48:21,646 --> 01:48:26,399
a global voting score of 874,362.

2408
01:48:29,370 --> 01:48:30,509
It's Trainee JUNG SEYUN.

2409
01:48:30,510 --> 01:48:32,680
(21st, Trainee JUNG SEYUN)

2410
01:48:34,949 --> 01:48:36,310
Congratulations.

2411
01:48:38,149 --> 01:48:40,189
"I'm SEYUN in second grade"

2412
01:48:40,350 --> 01:48:42,288
Trainee JUNG SEYUN...

2413
01:48:42,289 --> 01:48:43,789
got his global voting score of 60,000...

2414
01:48:43,859 --> 01:48:45,560
taken away by Trainee SEO KYOUNGBAE...

2415
01:48:46,090 --> 01:48:49,229
as his team was defeated during the Rival Matching.

2416
01:48:50,229 --> 01:48:52,560
He lost 60,000 points and still placed 21st.

2417
01:48:53,130 --> 01:48:54,399
You're right.

2418
01:48:55,329 --> 01:48:58,840
Despite getting a big score of 60,000 taken away,

2419
01:48:58,939 --> 01:49:01,709
he has survived again in the Second Passing Ceremony.

2420
01:49:01,710 --> 01:49:04,279
His secret must be that...

2421
01:49:04,439 --> 01:49:06,810
he captivated World Assemblers...

2422
01:49:06,909 --> 01:49:08,909
with his untiring voice and energy.

2423
01:49:12,720 --> 01:49:14,119
The next rank...

2424
01:49:15,119 --> 01:49:16,549
is the 19th.

2425
01:49:16,550 --> 01:49:18,319
(The 19th-place trainee is to be revealed.)

2426
01:49:20,729 --> 01:49:22,130
Gosh, this is driving me nuts.

2427
01:49:23,899 --> 01:49:26,100
It's such an obvious hint.

2428
01:49:27,369 --> 01:49:30,039
This trainee has...

2429
01:49:32,100 --> 01:49:35,310
his own signature hairstyle.

2430
01:49:35,439 --> 01:49:37,180
Hairstyle.

2431
01:49:37,710 --> 01:49:39,609
Isn't it me? It's me for sure.

2432
01:49:39,779 --> 01:49:41,050
- It's not you for sure. - Right.

2433
01:49:41,149 --> 01:49:42,979
- Not me? - Not you.

2434
01:49:43,010 --> 01:49:44,449
Because it's a hairstyle.

2435
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:45,949
Blue hair?

2436
01:49:46,649 --> 01:49:48,189
ABE YURA.

2437
01:49:51,720 --> 01:49:52,960
It could be BINGHUA.

2438
01:49:53,329 --> 01:49:54,989
Oh, BINGHUA?

2439
01:49:56,390 --> 01:49:57,399
Me?

2440
01:49:57,800 --> 01:49:58,858
Could it be me?

2441
01:49:58,859 --> 01:50:00,170
No?

2442
01:50:01,199 --> 01:50:02,600
This trainee received...

2443
01:50:03,300 --> 01:50:06,739
a global voting score of 1,008,053.

2444
01:50:06,770 --> 01:50:08,210
Gosh, that's a lot.

2445
01:50:10,210 --> 01:50:11,438
It's Trainee ABE YURA.

2446
01:50:11,439 --> 01:50:13,579
(19th, Trainee ABE YURA)

2447
01:50:13,979 --> 01:50:15,108
I'm ranked 19th.

2448
01:50:15,109 --> 01:50:16,849
- Gosh. - Congratulations.

2449
01:50:16,850 --> 01:50:18,979
- I'm ranked higher. - You are? Go higher.

2450
01:50:19,119 --> 01:50:20,919
During the Rival Matching,

2451
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:22,349
he focused on practicing making facial expressions...

2452
01:50:22,350 --> 01:50:25,560
and even improved his strength, dance moves.

2453
01:50:25,619 --> 01:50:29,090
It got him to capture the hearts of World Assemblers on the stage.

2454
01:50:34,729 --> 01:50:36,000
The next rank...

2455
01:50:36,199 --> 01:50:38,068
is the 17th.

2456
01:50:38,069 --> 01:50:39,869
(The 2nd Passing Ceremony, 17th)

2457
01:50:40,109 --> 01:50:42,640
This trainee has a big difference...

2458
01:50:43,010 --> 01:50:44,840
between when he smiles...

2459
01:50:44,939 --> 01:50:46,510
and when he makes a straight face.

2460
01:50:47,210 --> 01:50:48,310
MINSEO?

2461
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:51,579
JUNSEO?

2462
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:53,949
BINGHUA?

2463
01:50:55,890 --> 01:50:57,020
Who could it be?

2464
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:00,960
This trainee got his points...

2465
01:51:01,130 --> 01:51:03,959
taken away by the other team.

2466
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:05,728
(The 17th-place trainee is from the defeated Team "CASE 143.")

2467
01:51:05,729 --> 01:51:07,029
He received...

2468
01:51:07,100 --> 01:51:10,340
a global voting score of 1,110,859.

2469
01:51:11,939 --> 01:51:13,169
It's Trainee PARK JUNSEO.

2470
01:51:13,170 --> 01:51:14,640
(17th, Trainee PARK JUNSEO)

2471
01:51:14,840 --> 01:51:17,140
Trainee PARK JUNSEO took charge of the center position...

2472
01:51:17,210 --> 01:51:19,010
for the first time during the Rival Matching.

2473
01:51:19,210 --> 01:51:21,078
Showing off his charming low-tone voice,

2474
01:51:21,079 --> 01:51:22,810
he left an impressive performance.

2475
01:51:25,050 --> 01:51:26,989
His team was defeated in the Rival Matching,

2476
01:51:27,149 --> 01:51:29,849
and he got 10,000 points taken away...

2477
01:51:29,850 --> 01:51:31,920
by Trainee KANG HYUNWOO.

2478
01:51:32,619 --> 01:51:34,559
Nevertheless with World Assemblers' support,

2479
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:38,399
he is placed in the safe rank of 17th.

2480
01:51:40,130 --> 01:51:41,529
The next rank is...

2481
01:51:42,729 --> 01:51:44,339
the 15th.

2482
01:51:44,340 --> 01:51:46,539
(The 2nd Passing Ceremony)

2483
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:49,140
This trainee takes good care...

2484
01:51:51,109 --> 01:51:52,539
of the younger trainees.

2485
01:51:53,609 --> 01:51:54,609
HYUNWOO?

2486
01:51:57,380 --> 01:51:58,519
Maybe it's SIHUN.

2487
01:51:58,520 --> 01:51:59,778
(9th KIM SIHUN, during the 5th week)

2488
01:51:59,779 --> 01:52:01,119
I think it's SIHUN.

2489
01:52:01,720 --> 01:52:02,989
I doubt his rank...

2490
01:52:03,090 --> 01:52:04,489
has fallen that much.

2491
01:52:05,720 --> 01:52:08,689
And his individual votes for the Rival Matching...

2492
01:52:09,390 --> 01:52:12,199
are in the high ranks.

2493
01:52:12,630 --> 01:52:13,669
(KIM SIHUN: 40, KANG HYUNWOO: 12)

2494
01:52:13,670 --> 01:52:15,970
(It's not HYUNWOO as his votes are in the lower ranks.)

2495
01:52:16,529 --> 01:52:18,569
Wait. It's not me.

2496
01:52:21,170 --> 01:52:22,509
He received...

2497
01:52:22,510 --> 01:52:26,539
a global voting score of 1,240,214.

2498
01:52:27,579 --> 01:52:29,479
In this case, SIHUN will be placed a lot lower.

2499
01:52:31,579 --> 01:52:33,688
It's Trainee KANG MINSEO.

2500
01:52:33,689 --> 01:52:35,689
(15th, Trainee KANG MINSEO)

2501
01:52:37,189 --> 01:52:38,189
Congratulations.

2502
01:52:38,190 --> 01:52:41,329
Trainee KANG MINSEO was defeated during the Rival Matching...

2503
01:52:41,930 --> 01:52:43,429
and had his 30,000 points taken away...

2504
01:52:43,430 --> 01:52:45,859
by Trainee BINGHUA.

2505
01:52:47,270 --> 01:52:48,698
And after the performance,

2506
01:52:48,699 --> 01:52:50,770
he shed tears because he wasn't satisfied...

2507
01:52:51,439 --> 01:52:52,999
with how he performed.

2508
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:54,210
(He ended up showing tears.)

2509
01:52:55,569 --> 01:52:57,640
No, that wasn't me.

2510
01:52:57,939 --> 01:53:00,880
I'll look forward to seeing a more determined side of him...

2511
01:53:01,409 --> 01:53:02,550
during the next project.

2512
01:53:04,579 --> 01:53:07,149
So far, we've had more survivors...

2513
01:53:07,420 --> 01:53:10,989
in Team "CASE 143," the losing team.

2514
01:53:11,359 --> 01:53:13,189
(Team "CASE 143" had 3 survivors.)

2515
01:53:13,729 --> 01:53:15,960
(Team "LALALALA" had 1 survivor.)

2516
01:53:16,760 --> 01:53:19,999
I didn't think I'd be ranked high.

2517
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,970
But as my teammates were named one after another...

2518
01:53:24,270 --> 01:53:25,470
Trainee PARK JUNSEO.

2519
01:53:26,399 --> 01:53:28,369
Trainee KANG MINSEO.

2520
01:53:28,640 --> 01:53:31,979
Those left behind felt miserable.

2521
01:53:32,380 --> 01:53:34,849
I just wanted that situation to end soon...

2522
01:53:34,850 --> 01:53:37,079
so that the 35th-place trainee...

2523
01:53:37,149 --> 01:53:38,720
could be announced.

2524
01:53:39,649 --> 01:53:41,920
Let me announce the next survivor.

2525
01:53:42,319 --> 01:53:44,959
The rank is the 14th this time.

2526
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:47,989
(The 2nd Passing Ceremony, 14th)

2527
01:53:48,229 --> 01:53:52,100
This survivor is from Team "LALALALA."

2528
01:53:52,430 --> 01:53:55,399
He is a skilled trainee...

2529
01:53:55,670 --> 01:53:58,170
that everyone wants to team up with.

2530
01:53:58,739 --> 01:53:59,840
It's HYUNWOO.

2531
01:53:59,869 --> 01:54:00,869
It might be him.

2532
01:54:01,739 --> 01:54:02,770
Go out there.

2533
01:54:04,210 --> 01:54:05,609
He received...

2534
01:54:05,810 --> 01:54:09,810
a global voting score of 1,282,656.

2535
01:54:10,279 --> 01:54:11,449
It's 1,280,000.

2536
01:54:12,979 --> 01:54:14,789
It's Trainee KANG HYUNWOO.

2537
01:54:15,720 --> 01:54:17,259
- Good job. - Good work.

2538
01:54:17,260 --> 01:54:18,319
- Good job. - Congratulations.

2539
01:54:18,390 --> 01:54:20,788
Thanks to the team's victory,

2540
01:54:20,789 --> 01:54:24,460
he took 10,000 points away from Trainee PARK JUNSEO.

2541
01:54:24,600 --> 01:54:26,260
With these precious benefit points,

2542
01:54:26,659 --> 01:54:29,198
he's landed on the safe rank. Congratulations.

2543
01:54:29,199 --> 01:54:30,600
(14th, KANG HYUNWOO)

2544
01:54:34,840 --> 01:54:36,539
The next rank is...

2545
01:54:37,939 --> 01:54:39,438
the 11th.

2546
01:54:39,439 --> 01:54:40,510
(The 11th-place trainee is to be revealed.)

2547
01:54:41,779 --> 01:54:42,880
So far,

2548
01:54:43,210 --> 01:54:46,478
this trainee received benefit points twice.

2549
01:54:46,479 --> 01:54:47,649
(He received benefit points for a total of two times.)

2550
01:54:47,720 --> 01:54:48,789
- BINGHUA? - BINGHUA.

2551
01:54:49,119 --> 01:54:50,260
I received benefit points twice.

2552
01:54:51,090 --> 01:54:53,930
It's either YEOJUN or BINGHUA from Team "3D."

2553
01:54:56,090 --> 01:54:57,500
He received...

2554
01:54:58,100 --> 01:54:59,699
a global voting score...

2555
01:55:01,199 --> 01:55:04,039
of 1,422,048.

2556
01:55:04,369 --> 01:55:05,470
Congratulations.

2557
01:55:07,039 --> 01:55:08,469
It's Trainee BINGHUA.

2558
01:55:08,470 --> 01:55:10,909
(11th, Trainee BINGHUA)

2559
01:55:12,279 --> 01:55:13,948
- Good job. - Good job.

2560
01:55:13,949 --> 01:55:15,810
Our performance wouldn't have been possible without you.

2561
01:55:16,180 --> 01:55:19,180
Trainee BINGHUA became a First Tier during Title Song Self Assembly,

2562
01:55:19,420 --> 01:55:21,188
became a center and placed first in his team...

2563
01:55:21,189 --> 01:55:22,550
during the Position Matching,

2564
01:55:22,590 --> 01:55:25,259
and won the Rival Matching too.

2565
01:55:25,260 --> 01:55:27,390
He's walking on a flowery path, so to speak.

2566
01:55:28,130 --> 01:55:29,829
Let's look forward...

2567
01:55:29,960 --> 01:55:32,028
to seeing his amazing sides again during the next project.

2568
01:55:32,029 --> 01:55:33,060
(11th, BINGHUA)

2569
01:55:34,300 --> 01:55:35,869
Let me continue.

2570
01:55:37,170 --> 01:55:39,670
The trainee who will enjoy the joy of survival in A3...

2571
01:55:50,680 --> 01:55:51,779
is no one else.

2572
01:55:52,649 --> 01:55:53,688
No one else.

2573
01:55:53,689 --> 01:55:54,689
What?

2574
01:55:54,890 --> 01:55:55,890
No one else.

2575
01:55:56,020 --> 01:55:57,220
Gosh.

2576
01:55:59,060 --> 01:56:00,118
What?

2577
01:56:00,119 --> 01:56:03,390
(No one else has survived in A3.)

2578
01:56:04,399 --> 01:56:07,369
The group had a lot of high-placed trainees.

2579
01:56:08,029 --> 01:56:11,469
When HEEDO, SIU, and CHANYONG...

2580
01:56:11,470 --> 01:56:12,869
weren't named,

2581
01:56:13,199 --> 01:56:15,470
I was troubled, to be honest.

2582
01:56:16,470 --> 01:56:19,509
I'm truly grateful to World Assemblers...

2583
01:56:19,510 --> 01:56:22,010
for helping me survive.

2584
01:56:22,710 --> 01:56:25,750
Practicing as part of Team "CASE 143,"

2585
01:56:26,079 --> 01:56:29,919
I was really happy.

2586
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:31,359
I was so grateful,

2587
01:56:31,489 --> 01:56:33,560
and I got to learn a lot as well.

2588
01:56:34,560 --> 01:56:39,500
I believe I've improved a lot through this mission.

2589
01:56:39,699 --> 01:56:41,270
I'll work on my facial expressions more...

2590
01:56:41,630 --> 01:56:44,938
and try harder to improve more.

2591
01:56:44,939 --> 01:56:45,970
Thank you.

2592
01:56:46,399 --> 01:56:48,670
I enjoyed performing as part of Team "CASE 143..."

2593
01:56:48,770 --> 01:56:51,079
without leaving any regrets.

2594
01:56:51,539 --> 01:56:54,750
Half the trainees will be eliminated today,

2595
01:56:54,909 --> 01:56:56,618
but I want them to train constantly...

2596
01:56:57,119 --> 01:56:59,278
without being disheartened too much...

2597
01:56:59,279 --> 01:57:01,449
so that we can meet again later on the same stage.

2598
01:57:01,789 --> 01:57:04,618
I actually wasn't in good condition...

2599
01:57:04,619 --> 01:57:05,759
during this mission.

2600
01:57:05,760 --> 01:57:06,858
I hurt my leg...

2601
01:57:06,859 --> 01:57:09,359
and caught a cold on the performing day.

2602
01:57:09,390 --> 01:57:11,858
So I couldn't do as well as I wanted.

2603
01:57:11,859 --> 01:57:14,500
I think my rank fell just as much.

2604
01:57:14,829 --> 01:57:17,198
I must say it makes me more desperate...

2605
01:57:17,199 --> 01:57:18,840
and determined.

2606
01:57:18,939 --> 01:57:21,409
I'll show a cool performance next time...

2607
01:57:21,539 --> 01:57:23,939
and move up once more. Thank you.

2608
01:57:24,010 --> 01:57:27,478
Trainees who worked hard with me,

2609
01:57:27,479 --> 01:57:31,350
I hope we'll meet again on a nice stage in the future.

2610
01:57:31,649 --> 01:57:34,419
I want to thank you...

2611
01:57:34,420 --> 01:57:37,760
for motivating me. Thank you.

2612
01:57:38,890 --> 01:57:41,829
I still lack in many ways,

2613
01:57:41,960 --> 01:57:43,489
but I'll work hard toward the end.

2614
01:57:44,100 --> 01:57:46,659
I'll keep myself from letting people down...

2615
01:57:46,760 --> 01:57:48,899
and work hard to make everyone proud.

2616
01:57:49,930 --> 01:57:52,500
And I'd like to say the last part in Chinese.

2617
01:57:52,770 --> 01:57:56,309
For this performance, I had no choice...

2618
01:57:56,310 --> 01:58:00,139
but to take on a part I couldn't have normally pulled off.

2619
01:58:00,140 --> 01:58:04,420
Even though it was a small part, I put in a lot of effort.

2620
01:58:04,550 --> 01:58:07,818
I did my absolute best...

2621
01:58:07,819 --> 01:58:09,189
to do well.

2622
01:58:09,850 --> 01:58:13,959
Please have expectations for me instead of disappointment.

2623
01:58:13,960 --> 01:58:15,729
Please continue to root for me. Thank you.

2624
01:58:25,300 --> 01:58:26,869
- Thank you for your hard work. - My goodness.

2625
01:58:26,970 --> 01:58:28,509
- Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you.

2626
01:58:28,510 --> 01:58:29,738
- Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you.

2627
01:58:29,739 --> 01:58:31,180
JUNSEO.

2628
01:58:35,210 --> 01:58:36,380
You did well.

2629
01:58:42,750 --> 01:58:45,260
- My goodness. - My goodness, the 35th place.

2630
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:47,260
Yes. One spot remains.

2631
01:58:47,659 --> 01:58:48,789
Anything is possible.

2632
01:58:49,159 --> 01:58:53,029
HEEDO, why did you come here? For goodness' sake.

2633
01:58:54,829 --> 01:58:56,500
- I was going to leave, - Okay.

2634
01:58:57,029 --> 01:58:58,399
but I suddenly thought of something I wanted to eat.

2635
01:59:04,310 --> 01:59:08,148
Thus, all trainees have been called...

2636
01:59:08,149 --> 01:59:11,420
except for the 35th place and the top 7.

2637
01:59:15,489 --> 01:59:21,289
(Only the 35th place and the 1st to 9th places remain.)

2638
01:59:22,460 --> 01:59:26,060
I will now announce the trainee in 35th place.

2639
01:59:26,899 --> 01:59:28,300
Will he announce the trainee in 35th place 1st?

2640
01:59:28,800 --> 01:59:31,100
He'll announce the trainee in 35th place 1st.

2641
01:59:31,500 --> 01:59:34,340
"Don't I have a pretty good chance of placing 35th?"

2642
01:59:34,770 --> 01:59:35,939
I had that thought.

2643
01:59:36,510 --> 01:59:39,809
I was anxious that I wouldn't place 35th.

2644
01:59:39,810 --> 01:59:40,949
(39th, SEO JINWON)

2645
01:59:41,310 --> 01:59:44,350
Both CHANYONG who was sitting next to me and I...

2646
01:59:44,449 --> 01:59:47,920
hoped to place 35th.

2647
01:59:48,989 --> 01:59:50,119
Before that,

2648
01:59:50,890 --> 01:59:53,420
another video has been prepared...

2649
01:59:53,619 --> 01:59:56,390
for the World Assemblers.

2650
01:59:57,260 --> 01:59:58,658
After the video ends,

2651
01:59:58,659 --> 02:00:00,970
I'll continue on with the announcements.

2652
02:00:03,729 --> 02:00:07,568
(They've already spent 3 months in the Project Village.)

2653
02:00:07,569 --> 02:00:09,009
- Hello. - Hello.

2654
02:00:09,010 --> 02:00:10,270
- Hello. - Hello.

2655
02:00:10,369 --> 02:00:11,909
- All right. - What's this?

2656
02:00:12,779 --> 02:00:14,109
- Why is there a TV? - Seriously.

2657
02:00:14,710 --> 02:00:15,880
JOONWOO, sit here.

2658
02:00:16,779 --> 02:00:17,880
Okay.

2659
02:00:18,619 --> 02:00:19,749
Hello.

2660
02:00:19,750 --> 02:00:21,519
- Hello. - Hello.

2661
02:00:21,520 --> 02:00:22,520
What's this?

2662
02:00:23,319 --> 02:00:24,390
I'm scared.

2663
02:00:24,819 --> 02:00:26,260
It has been a while.

2664
02:00:27,159 --> 02:00:28,789
I think I have an idea.

2665
02:00:29,630 --> 02:00:31,898
Maybe we'll write a letter to ourselves one month from now.

2666
02:00:31,899 --> 02:00:33,129
(Is that it?)

2667
02:00:33,130 --> 02:00:35,369
A video letter from the World Assemblers?

2668
02:00:38,340 --> 02:00:39,599
I don't have a clue.

2669
02:00:39,600 --> 02:00:40,909
I don't know what it is.

2670
02:00:42,239 --> 02:00:43,368
- Who are they? - What?

2671
02:00:43,369 --> 02:00:44,478
My goodness.

2672
02:00:44,479 --> 02:00:46,939
(Why are the trainees surprised?)

2673
02:00:47,810 --> 02:00:50,309
- What's up with HEEJU's hair? - Hey.

2674
02:00:50,310 --> 02:00:51,379
(The Joker hairstyle appears in a preliminary video.)

2675
02:00:51,380 --> 02:00:52,649
(Screaming)

2676
02:00:52,949 --> 02:00:54,289
- Isn't that YURA? - What?

2677
02:00:55,020 --> 02:00:57,090
- I thought it was YURA. - What's this?

2678
02:00:57,289 --> 02:00:58,659
Oh, my goodness.

2679
02:01:00,489 --> 02:01:02,060
There are two YURA.

2680
02:01:02,529 --> 02:01:03,659
There are two YURA.

2681
02:01:03,890 --> 02:01:06,460
(What's going on?)

2682
02:01:06,630 --> 02:01:08,799
You know the mops that are used...

2683
02:01:08,800 --> 02:01:10,229
in schools, right?

2684
02:01:10,970 --> 02:01:12,139
In schools,

2685
02:01:12,140 --> 02:01:14,108
there are blue mops.

2686
02:01:14,109 --> 02:01:15,539
(The blue mop hairstyle)

2687
02:01:15,739 --> 02:01:18,180
How could you call my hair a mop?

2688
02:01:19,010 --> 02:01:20,809
- It's SIHUN. - It's SIHUN.

2689
02:01:20,810 --> 02:01:21,849
(Jumping)

2690
02:01:21,850 --> 02:01:23,509
- What's up with his hairstyle? - No!

2691
02:01:23,510 --> 02:01:24,779
What? Who's that?

2692
02:01:25,180 --> 02:01:26,180
What?

2693
02:01:26,479 --> 02:01:28,189
Did someone keep you from going to a hair salon?

2694
02:01:29,449 --> 02:01:32,119
Hello, my name is KIM SIHUN and I was born in 1999.

2695
02:01:32,560 --> 02:01:35,329
Were you going through an emotional hardship back then?

2696
02:01:35,829 --> 02:01:36,829
(He's going through an emotional hardship now.)

2697
02:01:36,830 --> 02:01:38,300
You should grab a guitar.

2698
02:01:39,460 --> 02:01:40,600
I'm in your care.

2699
02:01:40,970 --> 02:01:41,970
All right.

2700
02:01:42,130 --> 02:01:44,340
- Oh, no. - Like a period drama character.

2701
02:01:45,699 --> 02:01:47,140
- What? - Did you perform "LALALALA?"

2702
02:01:47,810 --> 02:01:48,969
Gosh, SIHUN.

2703
02:01:48,970 --> 02:01:50,979
I bet you really wanted to take "LALALALA."

2704
02:01:52,939 --> 02:01:54,510
I bet you resented MINWOOK.

2705
02:01:55,949 --> 02:01:57,850
(Embarrassed)

2706
02:01:58,050 --> 02:02:00,420
- Why didn't you perform "LALALALA?" - Why didn't you do it?

2707
02:02:01,420 --> 02:02:03,689
(What are you guys talking about?)

2708
02:02:05,689 --> 02:02:07,729
- Is that SEUNGHO? - Are you serious?

2709
02:02:08,930 --> 02:02:10,159
Was his hair that long?

2710
02:02:11,500 --> 02:02:13,300
(A preliminary performance)

2711
02:02:13,630 --> 02:02:15,970
(My goodness)

2712
02:02:18,170 --> 02:02:21,609
(He suddenly asks to redo the performance.)

2713
02:02:21,670 --> 02:02:23,069
My goodness.

2714
02:02:23,510 --> 02:02:26,239
- "One more chance." - He made a mistake.

2715
02:02:26,710 --> 02:02:29,279
Out of ten, how many points would you give to your own face?

2716
02:02:30,310 --> 02:02:32,579
Please spare me.

2717
02:02:34,449 --> 02:02:35,749
Eight points.

2718
02:02:35,750 --> 02:02:37,189
(8 points?)

2719
02:02:37,220 --> 02:02:38,389
SEUNGHO is so handsome.

2720
02:02:38,390 --> 02:02:40,559
(His looks deserve 8 points.)

2721
02:02:40,560 --> 02:02:42,188
How do you look so handsome with long hair?

2722
02:02:42,189 --> 02:02:43,989
Seriously. It's hard to look good with that hair.

2723
02:02:44,260 --> 02:02:45,399
You have good looks.

2724
02:02:46,529 --> 02:02:48,169
- No, go back. - JAEWON.

2725
02:02:48,170 --> 02:02:49,670
- He's wearing the same outfit. - That's right.

2726
02:02:49,899 --> 02:02:51,368
(He wore the same outfit back then!)

2727
02:02:51,369 --> 02:02:52,868
- Go back. - My goodness.

2728
02:02:52,869 --> 02:02:54,438
- It's the same outfit. - Go home!

2729
02:02:54,439 --> 02:02:55,439
(Same outfit, different people)

2730
02:02:55,569 --> 02:02:57,979
- Go home. - Were you going to a job interview?

2731
02:03:00,510 --> 02:03:02,509
(Impressed)

2732
02:03:02,510 --> 02:03:03,579
He's good.

2733
02:03:03,979 --> 02:03:05,349
He's really good.

2734
02:03:05,350 --> 02:03:06,949
- My goodness. - Is that the original song?

2735
02:03:07,949 --> 02:03:09,049
How nice.

2736
02:03:09,050 --> 02:03:10,089
Is there recorded audio?

2737
02:03:10,090 --> 02:03:11,619
JAEWON, you became...

2738
02:03:12,060 --> 02:03:14,229
very stylish.

2739
02:03:14,489 --> 02:03:15,989
(He agrees.)

2740
02:03:17,060 --> 02:03:19,500
(Whom will they see this time?)

2741
02:03:19,960 --> 02:03:22,770
(Trainee KIM SUNGMIN)

2742
02:03:23,970 --> 02:03:25,038
(Performing diligently)

2743
02:03:25,039 --> 02:03:26,239
- He performed well. - Yes.

2744
02:03:27,039 --> 02:03:28,238
How cute.

2745
02:03:28,239 --> 02:03:30,010
(Cute steps)

2746
02:03:30,369 --> 02:03:31,640
- He performed well. - Yes.

2747
02:03:32,380 --> 02:03:33,640
How cute.

2748
02:03:35,579 --> 02:03:36,909
You should watch the video.

2749
02:03:38,149 --> 02:03:39,380
Seriously,

2750
02:03:39,850 --> 02:03:43,020
I think he's better compared to that time.

2751
02:03:43,289 --> 02:03:44,858
- That's right. - In what way?

2752
02:03:44,859 --> 02:03:45,989
- Dance. - Dance?

2753
02:03:46,989 --> 02:03:48,029
Thank you.

2754
02:03:48,789 --> 02:03:50,359
(Embarrassed)

2755
02:03:53,529 --> 02:03:55,169
- Why are you playing this video? - It's you.

2756
02:03:55,170 --> 02:03:56,528
- Why are you playing this video? - JUNWON.

2757
02:03:56,529 --> 02:03:57,800
Why are you playing this video?

2758
02:03:58,100 --> 02:03:59,569
Don't play this video.

2759
02:04:00,739 --> 02:04:03,140
Hey, did you perform "Memories?"

2760
02:04:03,609 --> 02:04:05,578
- Seriously. - It holds our good memories

2761
02:04:05,579 --> 02:04:08,209
The smile in the photo, it's all you

2762
02:04:08,210 --> 02:04:09,448
How cute.

2763
02:04:09,449 --> 02:04:11,420
(His movements are quite cute.)

2764
02:04:12,449 --> 02:04:13,449
(Mehemories)

2765
02:04:16,720 --> 02:04:18,489
(Mehemories)

2766
02:04:18,720 --> 02:04:21,329
JUNWON, you were suited for variety shows even back then.

2767
02:04:22,859 --> 02:04:24,459
JUNWON is a member who grows.

2768
02:04:24,460 --> 02:04:25,600
He has improved so much.

2769
02:04:25,800 --> 02:04:28,929
Watching the video lets me know that I'm better now.

2770
02:04:28,930 --> 02:04:31,039
- Seriously. - I'm better now.

2771
02:04:31,170 --> 02:04:33,038
- SVIAT. - Is that SVIAT?

2772
02:04:33,039 --> 02:04:34,170
(SVIAT is next.)

2773
02:04:34,640 --> 02:04:36,770
Hello, I'm SVIAT.

2774
02:04:37,140 --> 02:04:38,680
I was born in 2010.

2775
02:04:39,640 --> 02:04:40,710
Fifteen years old.

2776
02:04:41,109 --> 02:04:42,479
Oh, my goodness.

2777
02:04:42,779 --> 02:04:43,949
It's SVIAT.

2778
02:04:44,779 --> 02:04:47,920
(He performed "Replay" by SHINee for the preliminary.)

2779
02:04:49,750 --> 02:04:52,659
- My goodness. - Gosh, look at SVIAT's steps.

2780
02:04:53,619 --> 02:04:56,028
(He's ready to steal older women's hearts.)

2781
02:04:56,029 --> 02:04:57,189
"Pretty."

2782
02:04:57,430 --> 02:04:59,429
- "Pretty." - "Pretty."

2783
02:04:59,430 --> 02:05:01,169
(Hiding behind an older trainee)

2784
02:05:01,170 --> 02:05:02,470
Okay.

2785
02:05:03,470 --> 02:05:04,669
How cute.

2786
02:05:04,670 --> 02:05:06,000
(He's so cute.)

2787
02:05:06,170 --> 02:05:07,199
Sit here.

2788
02:05:10,270 --> 02:05:13,609
Hello, my name is SEO JINWON, and I was born in 2009.

2789
02:05:13,739 --> 02:05:14,879
(Oh, no!)

2790
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:16,909
Why was I so chubby back then?

2791
02:05:17,680 --> 02:05:20,579
(He was Gyeongju's best dancer even back then.)

2792
02:05:22,449 --> 02:05:24,618
(Gyeongju's groove)

2793
02:05:24,619 --> 02:05:25,859
That pose was perfect.

2794
02:05:27,630 --> 02:05:30,460
(The older trainees are impressed.)

2795
02:05:32,329 --> 02:05:35,470
(Gyeongju's best dancer even has the best facial expression.)

2796
02:05:36,229 --> 02:05:37,769
- What? - What?

2797
02:05:37,770 --> 02:05:39,270
(My goodness)

2798
02:05:39,699 --> 02:05:40,738
(This trainee has his face covered.)

2799
02:05:40,739 --> 02:05:42,039
Who is it? It's YEOJUN.

2800
02:05:42,340 --> 02:05:43,509
What?

2801
02:05:43,510 --> 02:05:44,539
(Who is it?)

2802
02:05:44,909 --> 02:05:46,609
- KENSHIN? - Is it KENSHIN?

2803
02:05:46,779 --> 02:05:48,579
- KENSHIN? - KENSHIN.

2804
02:05:49,510 --> 02:05:52,649
(Embarrassed)

2805
02:05:54,250 --> 02:05:55,889
- My goodness. - My goodness.

2806
02:05:55,890 --> 02:05:57,619
- My goodness. - My goodness.

2807
02:05:57,819 --> 02:05:59,118
- Gosh. - My goodness.

2808
02:05:59,119 --> 02:06:00,158
(Screaming)

2809
02:06:00,159 --> 02:06:01,288
Hey.

2810
02:06:01,289 --> 02:06:02,359
(KENSHIN's past makes the trainees smile.)

2811
02:06:03,329 --> 02:06:05,430
(Embarrassed)

2812
02:06:05,899 --> 02:06:07,698
(The next person makes them scream in unison.)

2813
02:06:07,699 --> 02:06:09,430
- JEONGMIN. - Oh, no.

2814
02:06:10,130 --> 02:06:11,669
(Trainee KIM JEONGMIN)

2815
02:06:11,670 --> 02:06:12,699
Oh, no.

2816
02:06:15,210 --> 02:06:17,809
(He's serious about dance.)

2817
02:06:17,810 --> 02:06:19,309
- He's cool. - He's good.

2818
02:06:19,310 --> 02:06:20,439
No, I'm bad.

2819
02:06:20,909 --> 02:06:23,750
(He even uses a standing microphone.)

2820
02:06:24,819 --> 02:06:25,849
(He feels embarrassed.)

2821
02:06:25,850 --> 02:06:27,050
I can't watch this.

2822
02:06:29,520 --> 02:06:31,020
He's absorbed in himself.

2823
02:06:31,220 --> 02:06:33,659
No. I was nervous.

2824
02:06:34,890 --> 02:06:35,929
(The next one is...)

2825
02:06:35,930 --> 02:06:38,159
(Trainee KANG MINSEO.)

2826
02:06:38,659 --> 02:06:41,069
(This is the only place he can hide.)

2827
02:06:41,529 --> 02:06:42,800
He chose a cute song.

2828
02:06:46,399 --> 02:06:48,609
(The cute past makes him hide.)

2829
02:06:49,039 --> 02:06:51,279
(Now comes his sexy side.)

2830
02:06:51,579 --> 02:06:53,439
(Explosive reactions)

2831
02:06:57,979 --> 02:06:59,618
What? What's this?

2832
02:06:59,619 --> 02:07:01,688
Please. I seriously can't watch this.

2833
02:07:01,689 --> 02:07:02,789
(He hides once again.)

2834
02:07:03,289 --> 02:07:06,060
(Another trainee who's full of confidence)

2835
02:07:06,890 --> 02:07:08,528
(Oh, no)

2836
02:07:08,529 --> 02:07:10,229
Let's go.

2837
02:07:11,159 --> 02:07:13,130
Can you sense something with those feelers?

2838
02:07:13,500 --> 02:07:15,429
(Sensing with his feelers)

2839
02:07:15,430 --> 02:07:16,899
I think he's searching for something.

2840
02:07:17,500 --> 02:07:18,699
He dropped something.

2841
02:07:19,270 --> 02:07:20,500
He dropped something.

2842
02:07:20,640 --> 02:07:22,369
My name is ANDY, and I was born in 2007.

2843
02:07:22,670 --> 02:07:25,340
(ANDY screams like a water deer in the studio.)

2844
02:07:27,279 --> 02:07:29,880
(ANDY is embarrassed.)

2845
02:07:30,680 --> 02:07:33,449
My goodness. Please.

2846
02:07:33,779 --> 02:07:35,349
(Winking)

2847
02:07:35,350 --> 02:07:37,119
- He winked. - My goodness.

2848
02:07:38,260 --> 02:07:41,089
(He was hiding his tumbling skills behind his cuteness.)

2849
02:07:41,090 --> 02:07:43,129
What was wrong with me?

2850
02:07:43,130 --> 02:07:44,329
You were desperate.

2851
02:07:45,029 --> 02:07:47,100
(One more tumbling of desperation)

2852
02:07:47,300 --> 02:07:48,599
When we were picking the center member,

2853
02:07:48,600 --> 02:07:50,770
- you should've shown that. - You did everything you could do.

2854
02:07:51,039 --> 02:07:54,810
I wanted to do a handspring, but I couldn't do it.

2855
02:07:54,840 --> 02:07:56,868
- Do it now. - What?

2856
02:07:56,869 --> 02:07:58,209
- Do it now. - Show us.

2857
02:07:58,210 --> 02:07:59,710
ANDY is ambitious.

2858
02:07:59,909 --> 02:08:03,010
(Ta-da!)

2859
02:08:03,250 --> 02:08:05,149
- Bye. - How cool.

2860
02:08:05,850 --> 02:08:07,219
- Hello. - I didn't have much hair.

2861
02:08:07,220 --> 02:08:08,988
You're right. Your hair...

2862
02:08:08,989 --> 02:08:11,119
(His hairstyle was very different back then.)

2863
02:08:12,289 --> 02:08:13,819
CHENYU.

2864
02:08:18,760 --> 02:08:20,399
(Serious)

2865
02:08:21,069 --> 02:08:22,829
(What's this?)

2866
02:08:23,069 --> 02:08:24,899
(Embarrassed)

2867
02:08:25,470 --> 02:08:28,310
(WU CHENYU was serious until the end.)

2868
02:08:30,970 --> 02:08:32,738
It wasn't CHENYU I know now.

2869
02:08:32,739 --> 02:08:33,779
CHENYU.

2870
02:08:34,649 --> 02:08:35,850
I had no skills whatsoever.

2871
02:08:38,649 --> 02:08:40,778
Your dance and other things didn't stand out.

2872
02:08:40,779 --> 02:08:41,919
But your hair stood out so much.

2873
02:08:41,920 --> 02:08:42,989
Seriously.

2874
02:08:43,149 --> 02:08:44,619
Just my hair? You were the same.

2875
02:08:45,260 --> 02:08:46,760
(You're right.)

2876
02:08:47,090 --> 02:08:48,658
(You were the same.)

2877
02:08:48,659 --> 02:08:50,359
CHENYU speaks Korean so well.

2878
02:08:50,960 --> 02:08:53,529
I'm from Eomsa-myeon, Gyeryong-si, South Chungcheong Province.

2879
02:08:53,899 --> 02:08:54,970
That startled me.

2880
02:08:55,829 --> 02:08:57,569
KYOUNGBAE is the same as he is now.

2881
02:08:58,899 --> 02:09:01,310
(Dancing)

2882
02:09:01,840 --> 02:09:04,679
Like the vibe you and I have Make it and get started

2883
02:09:04,680 --> 02:09:06,279
- It's cute. - Why is it cute?

2884
02:09:07,109 --> 02:09:08,609
(Proud)

2885
02:09:09,079 --> 02:09:10,749
- Hello. - Hello.

2886
02:09:10,750 --> 02:09:12,680
(Another trainee appears after SHIN JAEWON.)

2887
02:09:13,479 --> 02:09:15,949
(Trainee MAJINGXIANG)

2888
02:09:16,020 --> 02:09:17,919
- MAJINGXIANG. - My goodness.

2889
02:09:17,920 --> 02:09:19,020
How is he so big?

2890
02:09:20,020 --> 02:09:21,859
What do you think is your charm?

2891
02:09:22,159 --> 02:09:24,229
I'm someone who makes an effort.

2892
02:09:24,829 --> 02:09:26,430
And I'm a bit handsome.

2893
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,069
(Trainee MAJINGXIANG is a bit handsome.)

2894
02:09:30,170 --> 02:09:31,539
A bit handsome?

2895
02:09:32,199 --> 02:09:33,270
Just a bit.

2896
02:09:33,539 --> 02:09:35,038
- "I'm a bit handsome." - Just a bit.

2897
02:09:35,039 --> 02:09:36,839
- It isn't just a bit. - You're very handsome.

2898
02:09:36,840 --> 02:09:38,239
- Very handsome. - Just a bit.

2899
02:09:39,640 --> 02:09:41,310
(The trainee who's a bit handsome, MAJINGXIANG raps passionately.)

2900
02:09:41,880 --> 02:09:43,210
(Impressed)

2901
02:09:43,310 --> 02:09:45,050
It's my first time seeing MAJINGXIANG like that.

2902
02:09:45,279 --> 02:09:46,279
I know.

2903
02:09:48,149 --> 02:09:50,948
(MAJINGXIANG showed off his unexpected charms.)

2904
02:09:50,949 --> 02:09:52,420
I'm more used to seeing his penguin-like side.

2905
02:09:53,420 --> 02:09:54,489
That's right.

2906
02:09:56,060 --> 02:09:57,158
Hello.

2907
02:09:57,159 --> 02:09:58,929
My name is YOO HEEDO, and I was born in 1996.

2908
02:09:58,930 --> 02:09:59,930
I'm in your care.

2909
02:10:00,760 --> 02:10:02,368
- It's JIAHN. - You auditioned with JIAHN.

2910
02:10:02,369 --> 02:10:03,469
The oldest members.

2911
02:10:03,470 --> 02:10:05,399
- My goodness. - What's up with HEEDO?

2912
02:10:06,500 --> 02:10:08,670
It's an individual match,

2913
02:10:09,640 --> 02:10:12,238
so I don't want to be like an older brother...

2914
02:10:12,239 --> 02:10:14,010
in this competition.

2915
02:10:14,039 --> 02:10:16,609
Now, I'm too sick and tired...

2916
02:10:16,850 --> 02:10:18,819
of being desperate.

2917
02:10:19,949 --> 02:10:21,789
I'm so used to being desperate.

2918
02:10:22,119 --> 02:10:25,819
So now, I want to relieve my desperation...

2919
02:10:26,359 --> 02:10:28,229
and switch it with confidence.

2920
02:10:29,090 --> 02:10:31,199
I will do my absolute best.

2921
02:10:32,930 --> 02:10:34,430
(Making a V-sign)

2922
02:10:35,229 --> 02:10:37,399
(The oldest trainee's cuteness)

2923
02:10:41,100 --> 02:10:42,310
I can't watch this.

2924
02:10:44,510 --> 02:10:46,778
(See you again tomorrow, bye)

2925
02:10:46,779 --> 02:10:48,350
(Screaming)

2926
02:10:48,750 --> 02:10:50,979
(HEEDO also competes with cuteness.)

2927
02:10:51,350 --> 02:10:52,979
(Shaking his head)

2928
02:10:53,479 --> 02:10:57,148
(It's shocking to see the older trainee's cute side.)

2929
02:10:57,149 --> 02:10:58,289
What was that?

2930
02:10:58,760 --> 02:11:00,560
I can do something like that too.

2931
02:11:01,359 --> 02:11:02,629
(The dance of the man who can do something like this)

2932
02:11:02,630 --> 02:11:03,630
(Furious)

2933
02:11:03,631 --> 02:11:04,659
His legs...

2934
02:11:07,930 --> 02:11:10,100
(Even the ending was perfect.)

2935
02:11:10,970 --> 02:11:13,000
(Screaming)

2936
02:11:13,239 --> 02:11:15,340
(Shaking)

2937
02:11:15,369 --> 02:11:16,909
TAEYU of "TOUCH."

2938
02:11:17,069 --> 02:11:18,509
HYUNJAE of "Memories."

2939
02:11:18,510 --> 02:11:20,710
- "Plot Twist." - HEEDO of "Plot Twist."

2940
02:11:21,180 --> 02:11:22,250
I can do that...

2941
02:11:22,710 --> 02:11:24,779
when I put my mind to it.

2942
02:11:25,220 --> 02:11:27,479
How was the oldest trainee's "Plot Twist?"

2943
02:11:28,149 --> 02:11:29,220
It was hard to watch.

2944
02:11:30,789 --> 02:11:31,819
It was hard to watch.

2945
02:11:33,090 --> 02:11:35,129
- Hold on. - "It was hard to watch."

2946
02:11:35,130 --> 02:11:36,658
I didn't mean it like that.

2947
02:11:36,659 --> 02:11:38,500
- Come to your senses. - I didn't mean it like that.

2948
02:11:38,829 --> 02:11:40,430
- Gosh. - It's CHANYONG.

2949
02:11:40,600 --> 02:11:41,670
My goodness.

2950
02:11:42,670 --> 02:11:45,600
- Hello, I'm PARK CHANYONG. - Why was I so chubby?

2951
02:11:46,300 --> 02:11:48,669
I felt a bit of pain when I danced,

2952
02:11:48,670 --> 02:11:51,109
but I suppressed it and kept going.

2953
02:11:51,239 --> 02:11:52,939
Then I sustained a big injury.

2954
02:11:53,039 --> 02:11:55,510
I had a torn meniscus.

2955
02:11:55,979 --> 02:11:59,020
Back then, the doctor told me...

2956
02:11:59,250 --> 02:12:00,920
that I might need to stop dancing.

2957
02:12:02,289 --> 02:12:03,989
But I decided...

2958
02:12:04,050 --> 02:12:08,090
to challenge myself to achieve my dream one last time.

2959
02:12:08,829 --> 02:12:10,359
That was why I applied for the show.

2960
02:12:10,760 --> 02:12:12,260
That was the backstory.

2961
02:12:16,029 --> 02:12:17,728
- My goodness. - He's good.

2962
02:12:17,729 --> 02:12:18,739
Seriously.

2963
02:12:19,670 --> 02:12:21,169
- Was it a freestyle dance? - Yes, it was.

2964
02:12:21,170 --> 02:12:23,239
(He danced freestyle.)

2965
02:12:24,069 --> 02:12:27,310
(He was desperate since it was his last chance.)

2966
02:12:28,579 --> 02:12:30,510
To me, PROJECT 7 is...

2967
02:12:31,579 --> 02:12:33,579
the last of the three opportunities...

2968
02:12:33,619 --> 02:12:35,289
I had in life.

2969
02:12:35,920 --> 02:12:38,420
It's a chance for me to prove myself.

2970
02:12:39,060 --> 02:12:42,729
I think it's time to show the fruit of my practice.

2971
02:12:42,930 --> 02:12:45,328
I want to show everyone...

2972
02:12:45,329 --> 02:12:48,270
what kind of a person I became through the past days.

2973
02:12:48,569 --> 02:12:52,269
I won't let go of this opportunity.

2974
02:12:52,270 --> 02:12:55,039
I have a strong desire to show people...

2975
02:12:55,670 --> 02:12:58,478
that I can do it.

2976
02:12:58,479 --> 02:13:00,210
I really wanted to go home, but...

2977
02:13:01,649 --> 02:13:03,479
I really want to be an idol.

2978
02:13:05,949 --> 02:13:08,589
I'll compete with the thought that this is the last chance.

2979
02:13:08,590 --> 02:13:11,789
I want to seize this chance.

2980
02:13:13,819 --> 02:13:16,260
It's a little bit...

2981
02:13:17,529 --> 02:13:20,159
It's a tiny bit exhausting.

2982
02:13:21,329 --> 02:13:23,300
I'm exhausted.

2983
02:13:27,439 --> 02:13:29,239
JIAHN, please work hard.

2984
02:13:30,569 --> 02:13:31,680
It's an opportunity.

2985
02:13:32,239 --> 02:13:33,340
Wake up.

2986
02:13:34,279 --> 02:13:37,949
Through this last chance, I want to make...

2987
02:13:38,520 --> 02:13:40,380
many people remember...

2988
02:13:40,880 --> 02:13:43,350
who YU JIAHN is.

2989
02:13:45,119 --> 02:13:50,029
It's difficult, but I won't give up.

2990
02:13:50,189 --> 02:13:53,659
I want to practice hard and dance well.

2991
02:13:56,500 --> 02:13:58,369
I need to work hard...

2992
02:13:59,140 --> 02:14:00,568
because I want to reach the end.

2993
02:14:00,569 --> 02:14:02,210
(I want to reach the end.)

2994
02:14:03,170 --> 02:14:06,039
The 10th to 34th places...

2995
02:14:06,140 --> 02:14:09,908
that were chosen by the World Assemblers' votes...

2996
02:14:09,909 --> 02:14:11,520
have been revealed.

2997
02:14:11,979 --> 02:14:13,619
Out of 35 seats,

2998
02:14:13,979 --> 02:14:15,819
the number of the remaining seats for the trainees who passed...

2999
02:14:16,090 --> 02:14:17,250
is ten.

3000
02:14:18,619 --> 02:14:20,590
Out of the trainees whose names haven't been called,

3001
02:14:21,159 --> 02:14:22,489
the 1st to 9th places...

3002
02:14:22,859 --> 02:14:27,600
and the last one, the 35th place remain.

3003
02:14:28,130 --> 02:14:30,000
Who will be the 35th place?

3004
02:14:30,270 --> 02:14:31,899
I'm really curious about the 35th place.

3005
02:14:32,270 --> 02:14:35,140
I'll now announce the trainee in 35th place.

3006
02:14:35,710 --> 02:14:37,170
That one will be revealed first.

3007
02:14:37,939 --> 02:14:39,479
Isn't that the highlight?

3008
02:14:40,210 --> 02:14:41,310
I'm expectant.

3009
02:14:43,680 --> 02:14:45,849
At the crossroads of survival and elimination,

3010
02:14:45,850 --> 02:14:49,489
this trainee will stay and continue competing on PROJECT 7.

3011
02:14:49,590 --> 02:14:52,020
I will reveal the four trainees...

3012
02:14:52,819 --> 02:14:55,829
who became the candidate for 35th place.

3013
02:14:56,430 --> 02:14:58,198
I think SEOKHEE will be included.

3014
02:14:58,199 --> 02:14:59,300
I think so too.

3015
02:15:00,399 --> 02:15:02,430
Yesterday, I was in 35th place.

3016
02:15:02,529 --> 02:15:03,930
So I thought that I had a chance.

3017
02:15:04,630 --> 02:15:06,970
Please let it be SOTA. Please.

3018
02:15:07,739 --> 02:15:11,909
I was in 34th place in Episode 7.

3019
02:15:12,039 --> 02:15:13,939
I really hope JINWON passes.

3020
02:15:14,210 --> 02:15:15,409
JINWON, come over here.

3021
02:15:15,449 --> 02:15:18,948
The older members said, "You'll be in 35th place."

3022
02:15:18,949 --> 02:15:23,590
They cut off at 35th place, but I was in 37th place earlier.

3023
02:15:24,750 --> 02:15:26,260
I hope it's me.

3024
02:15:27,119 --> 02:15:30,859
I really wanted to be included.

3025
02:15:30,989 --> 02:15:34,329
I really hoped that I'd be on the screen.

3026
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:36,930
- Who'll be in 35th place? - Oh, my goodness.

3027
02:15:37,130 --> 02:15:38,199
Seriously.

3028
02:15:38,399 --> 02:15:42,539
The 4 trainees who became the candidates for 35th place...

3029
02:15:43,069 --> 02:15:44,840
will be revealed now.

3030
02:15:45,640 --> 02:15:46,979
- Where will we see them? - Let's see their faces.

3031
02:15:47,539 --> 02:15:49,210
You never know. It might be you.

3032
02:15:49,750 --> 02:15:51,648
If I get included in the candidates for 35th place,

3033
02:15:51,649 --> 02:15:53,180
I might get lucky and pass.

3034
02:15:53,319 --> 02:15:55,188
I was in 36th place,

3035
02:15:55,189 --> 02:15:57,489
so I thought that I might be included.

3036
02:15:57,789 --> 02:15:58,819
- Will we see them on the screen? - Ta-da.

3037
02:15:59,560 --> 02:16:00,689
It's TAEYU.

3038
02:16:00,789 --> 02:16:01,960
- Really? - KIM TAEYU!

3039
02:16:03,159 --> 02:16:06,159
(38th, KIM TAEYU, 37th, LYNNLYNN)

3040
02:16:06,699 --> 02:16:10,300
(34th, FUKUYAMA SOTA, 35th, HA SEOKHEE)

3041
02:16:11,939 --> 02:16:14,868
To be honest, I hoped...

3042
02:16:14,869 --> 02:16:16,568
that SOTA would survive.

3043
02:16:16,569 --> 02:16:18,068
- LYNNLYNN! - SEOKHEE!

3044
02:16:18,069 --> 02:16:19,179
- SOTA! - SOTA!

3045
02:16:19,180 --> 02:16:20,239
KIM TAEYU!

3046
02:16:20,439 --> 02:16:22,510
- SEOKHEE! - Oh, my goodness.

3047
02:16:22,880 --> 02:16:24,949
LYNNLYNN was one of the candidates.

3048
02:16:25,420 --> 02:16:27,819
I had taken TAEYU's points before.

3049
02:16:28,079 --> 02:16:30,449
So I didn't know whom I should root for.

3050
02:16:30,649 --> 02:16:32,059
LYNNLYNN and SEOKHEE.

3051
02:16:32,520 --> 02:16:33,719
SEOKHEE and LYNNLYNN.

3052
02:16:34,760 --> 02:16:36,558
- What? - JINWON isn't among them.

3053
02:16:36,559 --> 02:16:37,629
TAEYU!

3054
02:16:37,860 --> 02:16:40,798
I was a bit upset since I wasn't even a candidate.

3055
02:16:40,799 --> 02:16:43,128
It hit me that I won't be able to do...

3056
02:16:43,129 --> 02:16:46,200
the next mission on PROJECT 7.

3057
02:16:46,370 --> 02:16:49,040
I really couldn't believe it.

3058
02:16:49,709 --> 02:16:52,680
Among the four, which trainee will take...

3059
02:16:53,209 --> 02:16:57,110
the last passing spot, 35th place?

3060
02:16:58,520 --> 02:17:00,280
I don't know what to do. I want to bring all of them.

3061
02:17:01,549 --> 02:17:03,249
I'll feel so sad no matter who gets eliminated.

3062
02:17:03,250 --> 02:17:04,350
I know.

3063
02:17:05,590 --> 02:17:06,760
Four trainees...

3064
02:17:07,159 --> 02:17:10,229
stand at the crossroads of a pass or an elimination...

3065
02:17:10,790 --> 02:17:12,260
for PROJECT 7's 2nd Passing Ceremony.

3066
02:17:12,530 --> 02:17:14,558
Who will receive the right...

3067
02:17:14,559 --> 02:17:16,829
to continue getting assembled by the World Assemblers?

3068
02:17:18,100 --> 02:17:19,569
The trainee in 35th place...

3069
02:17:19,870 --> 02:17:21,370
will be revealed on the screen.

3070
02:17:24,340 --> 02:17:25,579
This makes you nervous the most.

3071
02:17:26,409 --> 02:17:27,709
I'm very curious about this.

3072
02:17:28,780 --> 02:17:31,309
I had given up on it a bit,

3073
02:17:32,250 --> 02:17:34,548
but I wanted to stay...

3074
02:17:34,549 --> 02:17:36,020
after I saw that.

3075
02:17:36,290 --> 02:17:37,549
Seriously.

3076
02:17:38,420 --> 02:17:39,790
Please.

3077
02:17:40,020 --> 02:17:43,558
People around me kept saying I could be in 35th place.

3078
02:17:43,559 --> 02:17:46,229
That somewhat made me have hope.

3079
02:17:48,569 --> 02:17:53,369
Moving up two ranks in a day...

3080
02:17:53,370 --> 02:17:54,569
is a difficult thing.

3081
02:17:55,909 --> 02:17:57,839
I knew it wouldn't work,

3082
02:17:57,840 --> 02:18:01,340
but I was still hoping. That felt somewhat bad.

3083
02:18:01,850 --> 02:18:04,209
I know this feeling.

3084
02:18:04,879 --> 02:18:09,020
Please reveal the trainee in 35th place.

3085
02:18:09,649 --> 02:18:10,889
- Who is it? - Who will it be?

3086
02:18:10,989 --> 02:18:12,120
Who is it?

3087
02:18:12,690 --> 02:18:13,860
I'm nervous.

3088
02:18:15,959 --> 02:18:17,389
Who?

3089
02:18:29,069 --> 02:18:34,879
(35th, Trainee LYNNLYNN)

3090
02:18:37,649 --> 02:18:39,120
He's the one who won today.

3091
02:18:40,049 --> 02:18:41,280
The 35th-place trainee...

3092
02:18:42,020 --> 02:18:43,649
is LYNNLYNN.

3093
02:18:45,290 --> 02:18:46,718
LYNNLYNN!

3094
02:18:46,719 --> 02:18:48,120
(Congratulations, LYNNLYNN.)

3095
02:18:48,190 --> 02:18:49,530
You won't go home!

3096
02:18:50,690 --> 02:18:51,929
He contributed to the victory...

3097
02:18:51,930 --> 02:18:55,200
in the Rival Matching with his outstanding dance moves.

3098
02:18:55,930 --> 02:18:58,669
He took a global voting score of 40,000 points...

3099
02:18:58,670 --> 02:19:02,870
from HOU GUANYI in the opponent team.

3100
02:19:03,540 --> 02:19:04,610
It's unfortunate for TAEYU.

3101
02:19:05,979 --> 02:19:09,078
I wanted to perform on a stage that amazed people.

3102
02:19:09,079 --> 02:19:10,409
I'm disappointed I couldn't do that.

3103
02:19:10,850 --> 02:19:12,979
LYNNLYNN had the benefit.

3104
02:19:14,049 --> 02:19:16,420
It's about the benefit in the end.

3105
02:19:17,420 --> 02:19:19,959
SOTA was eliminated.

3106
02:19:20,120 --> 02:19:23,089
I made so many memories,

3107
02:19:23,090 --> 02:19:25,430
so I felt a bit sad.

3108
02:19:27,530 --> 02:19:29,329
I have mixed feelings.

3109
02:19:29,829 --> 02:19:31,270
It's touching for LYNNLYNN,

3110
02:19:32,139 --> 02:19:35,139
but it's sad for SEOKHEE, TAEYU, and SOTA.

3111
02:19:36,569 --> 02:19:41,540
Thank you so much, World Assemblers.

3112
02:19:42,979 --> 02:19:46,120
I also thank the members of Team "Make A Wish."

3113
02:19:46,479 --> 02:19:49,850
I really thank...

3114
02:19:51,120 --> 02:19:53,319
the Japanese World Assemblers.

3115
02:19:55,260 --> 02:20:00,299
I think I'm very lucky to join...

3116
02:20:01,059 --> 02:20:04,398
the next project...

3117
02:20:04,399 --> 02:20:06,669
as the last member.

3118
02:20:06,670 --> 02:20:08,940
Thank you.

3119
02:20:10,610 --> 02:20:12,638
You earned a precious opportunity.

3120
02:20:12,639 --> 02:20:16,309
I hope you'll improve more in the next stage.

3121
02:20:16,879 --> 02:20:21,578
Trainee LYNNLYNN, please sit on the 35th place's seat.

3122
02:20:21,579 --> 02:20:22,620
Thank you.

3123
02:20:23,489 --> 02:20:24,520
That's cool!

3124
02:20:30,860 --> 02:20:31,899
It's done.

3125
02:20:33,459 --> 02:20:36,569
(The 35th-place trainee was announced.)

3126
02:20:36,700 --> 02:20:39,700
Assemble and upgrade. PROJECT 7.

3127
02:20:39,899 --> 02:20:43,670
The second Passing Ceremony deciding the survival of the trainees.

3128
02:20:44,010 --> 02:20:48,750
Now, I'll announce the trainees of the highest ranking.

3129
02:20:48,780 --> 02:20:49,809
The debut members.

3130
02:20:50,350 --> 02:20:54,020
- It's here. - Who will be the top members...

3131
02:20:54,120 --> 02:20:56,090
that the World Assemblers chose?

3132
02:20:58,190 --> 02:20:59,519
(1st individual vote results)

3133
02:20:59,520 --> 02:21:00,520
(1st, JEON MINWOOK 2nd, SAKURADA KENSHIN)

3134
02:21:00,521 --> 02:21:04,590
(The debut group rankings had large fluctuations.)

3135
02:21:06,159 --> 02:21:09,099
My ranking was lower than at the first Passing Ceremony.

3136
02:21:09,100 --> 02:21:10,398
I got very stressed.

3137
02:21:10,399 --> 02:21:12,599
If the ranking goes down,

3138
02:21:12,600 --> 02:21:14,469
it may not go up again.

3139
02:21:15,170 --> 02:21:17,568
I was in fourth place in the first Passing Ceremony.

3140
02:21:17,569 --> 02:21:20,039
But my ranking was going lower.

3141
02:21:20,040 --> 02:21:22,280
I'm of course worried.

3142
02:21:22,409 --> 02:21:24,449
I was in third place in the Passing Ceremony.

3143
02:21:24,450 --> 02:21:27,649
I thought I'd be in fifth place if the ranking dropped.

3144
02:21:27,750 --> 02:21:29,950
I did my best on the "Jealousy" stage.

3145
02:21:30,520 --> 02:21:33,159
My ranking was seventh during the interim votes.

3146
02:21:33,190 --> 02:21:35,229
I hoped the ranking wouldn't drop.

3147
02:21:36,229 --> 02:21:39,299
I was sixth the last time I checked.

3148
02:21:39,360 --> 02:21:41,899
I predicted to be in seventh place.

3149
02:21:42,170 --> 02:21:45,700
First, to reveal the trainee in seventh place,

3150
02:21:45,870 --> 02:21:49,139
three candidates to be in seventh place...

3151
02:21:50,289 --> 02:21:51,469
will be shown on the screen.

3152
02:21:53,010 --> 02:21:54,110
Seventh, eighth, and ninth?

3153
02:21:54,209 --> 02:21:55,450
SIHUN.

3154
02:21:55,549 --> 02:21:57,709
(9th, KIM SIHUN)

3155
02:21:58,309 --> 02:21:59,578
I'm nervous.

3156
02:21:59,579 --> 02:22:00,719
MAJINGXIANG.

3157
02:22:02,120 --> 02:22:03,318
NAM JIWOON.

3158
02:22:03,319 --> 02:22:05,319
(7th, NAM JIWOON)

3159
02:22:05,590 --> 02:22:06,718
SEONGHO.

3160
02:22:06,719 --> 02:22:09,690
(6th, SEONGHO)

3161
02:22:09,860 --> 02:22:11,090
It's difficult.

3162
02:22:12,129 --> 02:22:13,260
I'm nervous.

3163
02:22:14,030 --> 02:22:16,129
(The 3 7th-place candidates...)

3164
02:22:19,600 --> 02:22:20,739
What?

3165
02:22:22,739 --> 02:22:23,870
What?

3166
02:22:26,510 --> 02:22:28,379
They're all good-looking.

3167
02:22:30,110 --> 02:22:34,850
Trainees KIM SIHUN, NAM JIWOON, and MAJINGXIANG.

3168
02:22:35,180 --> 02:22:38,818
Who will be the trainee in 7th place...

3169
02:22:38,819 --> 02:22:40,519
and be among the Top 7?

3170
02:22:40,520 --> 02:22:41,520
(Who will get the last ticket to be in the Top 7?)

3171
02:22:42,129 --> 02:22:44,689
Trainee NAM JIWOON was in 12th place...

3172
02:22:44,690 --> 02:22:45,959
in the first Passing Ceremony.

3173
02:22:46,200 --> 02:22:49,100
Your ranking rose very much. How do you feel now?

3174
02:22:49,200 --> 02:22:52,068
During the interim check,

3175
02:22:52,069 --> 02:22:53,940
my ranking rose to the seventh place.

3176
02:22:54,200 --> 02:22:57,540
I'm very nervous.

3177
02:23:00,840 --> 02:23:03,179
Trainee KIM SIHUN, your ranking went down...

3178
02:23:03,180 --> 02:23:04,780
compared to the result in the first Passing Ceremony.

3179
02:23:05,479 --> 02:23:07,148
He was in fourth place.

3180
02:23:07,149 --> 02:23:10,549
SIHUN in 9th place, MAJINGXIANG in 8th, and JIWOON in 7th.

3181
02:23:11,590 --> 02:23:13,059
How do you feel now?

3182
02:23:14,590 --> 02:23:18,290
If my ranking drops, there's still a place for me to climb up.

3183
02:23:19,629 --> 02:23:20,760
Look at that mindset.

3184
02:23:21,100 --> 02:23:23,898
Rather than looking at the current result,

3185
02:23:23,899 --> 02:23:26,069
I'll do my best for the later results.

3186
02:23:27,069 --> 02:23:30,468
The same goes with Trainee MAJINGXIANG.

3187
02:23:30,469 --> 02:23:31,670
Your ranking went down compared to the first Passing Ceremony.

3188
02:23:31,809 --> 02:23:34,610
I of course want to be in seventh place.

3189
02:23:34,709 --> 02:23:36,950
But even if I don't get that result,

3190
02:23:37,079 --> 02:23:38,379
I'll work harder.

3191
02:23:38,450 --> 02:23:40,079
But still, I'd like to be in that ranking.

3192
02:23:44,090 --> 02:23:47,090
Then, I'll reveal the trainee in ninth place first.

3193
02:23:47,790 --> 02:23:49,228
(2nd Passing Ceremony, 9th)

3194
02:23:49,229 --> 02:23:50,430
The trainee in ninth place...

3195
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:53,860
received a global voting score...

3196
02:23:54,399 --> 02:23:56,770
of 1,612,771...

3197
02:23:57,170 --> 02:24:00,739
- That's very high. - points.

3198
02:24:01,639 --> 02:24:03,309
That's 200,000 points more than mine.

3199
02:24:08,340 --> 02:24:09,808
Trainee KIM SIHUN.

3200
02:24:09,809 --> 02:24:11,208
(9th, KIM SIHUN)

3201
02:24:11,209 --> 02:24:12,250
Congratulations.

3202
02:24:24,790 --> 02:24:26,129
SIHUN's ranking dropped a lot.

3203
02:24:26,899 --> 02:24:28,628
(Sighing)

3204
02:24:28,629 --> 02:24:29,629
Goodness.

3205
02:24:29,630 --> 02:24:32,340
Trainee KIMSIHUN acts as the center of the team...

3206
02:24:32,500 --> 02:24:34,700
with stable and strong skills.

3207
02:24:34,969 --> 02:24:38,908
The team lost in the Stray Kids challenge,

3208
02:24:38,909 --> 02:24:41,739
and he lost a global voting score of 200,000 points to ABE YURA.

3209
02:24:42,649 --> 02:24:44,479
But he still maintained his high ranking.

3210
02:24:46,319 --> 02:24:48,648
I think PROJECT 7 will be a program

3211
02:24:48,649 --> 02:24:52,090
that will be a turning point in my life.

3212
02:24:52,489 --> 02:24:55,388
I gained some hope through the program.

3213
02:24:55,389 --> 02:24:58,930
While watching the other trainees,

3214
02:24:59,229 --> 02:25:03,069
I could reflame the passion that was dying in me.

3215
02:25:03,270 --> 02:25:06,399
Although my ranking dropped from 4th to 9th,

3216
02:25:07,100 --> 02:25:09,110
I think I would just have to keep going up...

3217
02:25:09,809 --> 02:25:13,940
and keep trying to enter the debut group.

3218
02:25:14,139 --> 02:25:15,340
Thank you.

3219
02:25:17,809 --> 02:25:19,180
Let's go, KIM SIHUN!

3220
02:25:19,319 --> 02:25:20,420
He did well.

3221
02:25:22,090 --> 02:25:23,120
Goodness.

3222
02:25:24,090 --> 02:25:25,319
Well done.

3223
02:25:25,389 --> 02:25:27,119
(The announcements for 7th and 8th place are left.)

3224
02:25:27,120 --> 02:25:31,289
Currently, Trainees NAM JIWOON and MAJINGXIANG...

3225
02:25:31,290 --> 02:25:32,558
are seventh-place candidates.

3226
02:25:32,559 --> 02:25:33,559
(Trainee NAM JIWOON Trainee MAJINGXIANG)

3227
02:25:33,560 --> 02:25:36,770
I will now announce the trainee in seventh place.

3228
02:25:37,270 --> 02:25:40,669
The trainee whose name doesn't get called...

3229
02:25:40,670 --> 02:25:42,170
will automatically be in eighth place.

3230
02:25:43,840 --> 02:25:45,840
The second Passing Ceremony of PROJECT 7.

3231
02:25:46,110 --> 02:25:48,978
The trainee is in 7th place among the Top 7...

3232
02:25:48,979 --> 02:25:49,979
(The trainee in 7th place in the 2nd Passing Ceremony)

3233
02:25:49,980 --> 02:25:55,620
received a global voting score of 1,733,055 points.

3234
02:25:55,950 --> 02:25:58,148
- I think it would be JIWOON. - I think so too.

3235
02:25:58,149 --> 02:25:59,519
He received the benefit too.

3236
02:25:59,520 --> 02:26:01,690
Only JIWOON received the benefit here.

3237
02:26:02,159 --> 02:26:03,589
It was 60,000 points.

3238
02:26:03,590 --> 02:26:05,360
(7th place with 60,000 benefit points)

3239
02:26:05,700 --> 02:26:07,199
(8th place with minus 10,000 benefit points.)

3240
02:26:07,200 --> 02:26:08,399
You can do it, MAJINGXIANG.

3241
02:26:09,899 --> 02:26:13,999
That one rank determines whether or not you make your debut.

3242
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,610
So I will get in the seventh place.

3243
02:26:18,110 --> 02:26:19,478
What do I do?

3244
02:26:19,479 --> 02:26:22,110
Can I get back to being in the Top Seven?

3245
02:26:24,250 --> 02:26:25,649
Is it NAM or MA?

3246
02:26:26,479 --> 02:26:28,579
I think it would be JIWOON. Right?

3247
02:26:29,889 --> 02:26:32,190
- It's Trainee MAJINGXIANG. - Thank you.

3248
02:26:32,790 --> 02:26:34,718
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

3249
02:26:34,719 --> 02:26:35,989
Nice.

3250
02:26:36,690 --> 02:26:37,889
I'm nervous.

3251
02:26:40,860 --> 02:26:42,299
He came back up.

3252
02:26:44,770 --> 02:26:46,370
- I thought it would be JIWOON. - Me too.

3253
02:26:50,739 --> 02:26:53,138
MAJINGXIANG's team lost...

3254
02:26:53,139 --> 02:26:54,539
in the Rival Matching,

3255
02:26:54,540 --> 02:26:58,610
and he lost a global voting score of 10,000 points to SHIN JAEWON.

3256
02:26:58,950 --> 02:27:00,919
While preparing for the "GAMBLER" stage,

3257
02:27:00,920 --> 02:27:04,290
he stimulated the team members by urging them to practice.

3258
02:27:04,420 --> 02:27:07,658
I think the fact that he kept practicing without resting...

3259
02:27:07,659 --> 02:27:11,030
moved the hearts of the World Assemblers.

3260
02:27:11,860 --> 02:27:14,100
He won even when he didn't get the benefit.

3261
02:27:15,360 --> 02:27:17,629
Even after being in the Top Seven,

3262
02:27:17,729 --> 02:27:19,340
I'll keep myself focused,

3263
02:27:19,739 --> 02:27:24,040
and I want to maintain this position well.

3264
02:27:24,409 --> 02:27:27,378
Voting and supporting aren't easy.

3265
02:27:27,379 --> 02:27:30,579
So I hope the World Assemblers...

3266
02:27:30,909 --> 02:27:32,819
will rest well when they can...

3267
02:27:33,180 --> 02:27:35,649
and eat well too.

3268
02:27:36,520 --> 02:27:37,920
He takes care of their health as well.

3269
02:27:38,520 --> 02:27:39,659
He's a good son.

3270
02:27:41,319 --> 02:27:42,329
I love you.

3271
02:27:42,889 --> 02:27:44,729
I love you.

3272
02:27:45,290 --> 02:27:47,860
To the top! Higher. I'll do well.

3273
02:27:47,930 --> 02:27:49,000
Thank you.

3274
02:27:53,969 --> 02:27:57,339
Please sit in the seventh-place's seat.

3275
02:27:57,340 --> 02:28:01,280
(The first Top 7 member, Trainee MAJINGXIANG)

3276
02:28:01,639 --> 02:28:02,649
I envy you.

3277
02:28:05,049 --> 02:28:06,719
Trainee NAM JIWOON...

3278
02:28:06,750 --> 02:28:08,849
is automatically in eighth place.

3279
02:28:08,850 --> 02:28:11,389
(8th, Trainee NAM JIWOON)

3280
02:28:12,459 --> 02:28:14,689
Trainee NAM JIWOON received...

3281
02:28:14,690 --> 02:28:18,829
a global voting score of 1,726,112 points.

3282
02:28:18,889 --> 02:28:20,430
That's only 10,000 points less.

3283
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:22,000
That's right.

3284
02:28:22,159 --> 02:28:25,870
He came in 8th place in the 2nd Passing Ceremony.

3285
02:28:26,239 --> 02:28:28,599
Every time I perform on stage,

3286
02:28:28,600 --> 02:28:32,610
I see so many things to improve.

3287
02:28:32,680 --> 02:28:34,680
I'll perform well on the next stage...

3288
02:28:34,809 --> 02:28:37,679
and show you the reason...

3289
02:28:37,680 --> 02:28:39,120
why I should be in the Top Seven.

3290
02:28:40,420 --> 02:28:43,019
I also thank Team Wishlist...

3291
02:28:43,020 --> 02:28:46,090
for helping me earn the benefit.

3292
02:28:46,360 --> 02:28:49,728
I love you, World Assemblers.

3293
02:28:49,729 --> 02:28:53,059
I love you.

3294
02:28:53,329 --> 02:28:54,399
Thank you.

3295
02:28:58,069 --> 02:29:00,739
- Did you practice those words? - I just practiced it.

3296
02:29:01,040 --> 02:29:02,170
You should practice more.

3297
02:29:04,940 --> 02:29:07,808
I will continue to announce...

3298
02:29:07,809 --> 02:29:09,950
the top rankings.

3299
02:29:11,010 --> 02:29:14,049
Starting from the sixth-place, I'll announce them one by one.

3300
02:29:15,319 --> 02:29:16,989
(6th, 5th, 4th, 3rd, 2nd, 1st)

3301
02:29:17,120 --> 02:29:18,989
Who would that be?

3302
02:29:20,059 --> 02:29:21,558
I wonder what changes were made at the top.

3303
02:29:21,559 --> 02:29:23,590
I used to be there.

3304
02:29:24,629 --> 02:29:26,799
I'll announce the trainee in sixth place.

3305
02:29:27,100 --> 02:29:29,269
I heard he was a trainee who was the most serious...

3306
02:29:29,270 --> 02:29:31,430
in the Rival Matching stage.

3307
02:29:31,670 --> 02:29:32,968
I think it's SEUNGHO.

3308
02:29:32,969 --> 02:29:34,170
SEUNGHO.

3309
02:29:34,340 --> 02:29:35,540
Or KYOUNGBAE?

3310
02:29:36,110 --> 02:29:37,370
It would be YEOJUN.

3311
02:29:38,569 --> 02:29:40,639
It's me. He looked at me.

3312
02:29:41,440 --> 02:29:42,610
He looked at you.

3313
02:29:42,909 --> 02:29:46,620
(Rankings in the 5th week)

3314
02:29:46,649 --> 02:29:48,280
The global voting score...

3315
02:29:48,680 --> 02:29:51,719
was higher than 2,000,000 points.

3316
02:29:51,819 --> 02:29:54,659
Higher than 2,000,000 points.

3317
02:29:55,360 --> 02:29:56,559
That's from the sixth place?

3318
02:29:56,760 --> 02:29:58,659
It jumped from 1,700,000 to 2,000,000?

3319
02:29:59,600 --> 02:30:01,029
The trainee received...

3320
02:30:01,030 --> 02:30:05,670
a global voting score of 2,013,677 points.

3321
02:30:12,010 --> 02:30:13,908
It's Trainee KIM SUNGMIN.

3322
02:30:13,909 --> 02:30:15,609
(6th, Trainee KIM SUNGMIN)

3323
02:30:15,610 --> 02:30:16,709
Congratulations.

3324
02:30:17,409 --> 02:30:19,049
SUNGMIN would be in 3rd or 4th place.

3325
02:30:19,149 --> 02:30:20,879
It's Trainee KIM SUNGMIN.

3326
02:30:22,350 --> 02:30:23,450
What?

3327
02:30:26,190 --> 02:30:28,090
SUNGMIN's ranking keeps dropping.

3328
02:30:28,819 --> 02:30:31,860
Trainee KIM SUNGMIN's team won in the Rival Matching,

3329
02:30:32,090 --> 02:30:34,599
and he took a global voting score of 50,000 points...

3330
02:30:34,600 --> 02:30:36,700
from FONG ATILLA.

3331
02:30:37,069 --> 02:30:39,469
He said he wanted to improve more to suit...

3332
02:30:39,670 --> 02:30:43,040
the high ranking you received at the first Passing Ceremony.

3333
02:30:43,139 --> 02:30:45,068
So while preparing for the "Jealousy" stage,

3334
02:30:45,069 --> 02:30:48,340
he kept practicing even when others rested.

3335
02:30:48,739 --> 02:30:51,450
He practiced harder than anyone else.

3336
02:30:51,649 --> 02:30:54,378
I first want to thank...

3337
02:30:54,379 --> 02:30:56,290
the World Assemblers...

3338
02:30:56,420 --> 02:30:58,920
for giving me so much attention.

3339
02:30:58,950 --> 02:31:01,290
I think it's thanks to the attention...

3340
02:31:01,959 --> 02:31:03,930
that I keep trying harder.

3341
02:31:04,260 --> 02:31:06,030
I could see that I was improving...

3342
02:31:06,299 --> 02:31:08,459
through that,

3343
02:31:09,059 --> 02:31:11,000
so I got a desire to achieve more.

3344
02:31:11,100 --> 02:31:14,398
I want to show you...

3345
02:31:14,399 --> 02:31:18,440
a more amazing stage later.

3346
02:31:18,670 --> 02:31:23,679
I also want to thank the other trainees...

3347
02:31:23,680 --> 02:31:25,549
who helped me improve.

3348
02:31:25,780 --> 02:31:29,249
Whenever I was tired and low,

3349
02:31:29,250 --> 02:31:32,459
I was always taken care of...

3350
02:31:34,459 --> 02:31:36,159
There's just JINWON in front of him.

3351
02:31:36,790 --> 02:31:40,828
He's a trainee that I really care about.

3352
02:31:40,829 --> 02:31:42,798
It's SEO JINWON who was adorable...

3353
02:31:42,799 --> 02:31:47,069
ever since we were in P4.

3354
02:31:47,540 --> 02:31:48,599
He really...

3355
02:31:48,600 --> 02:31:49,769
(They sweated, cried, and laughed together for a long time.)

3356
02:31:49,770 --> 02:31:51,770
He taught me a lot...

3357
02:31:52,040 --> 02:31:54,340
and practiced with me a lot.

3358
02:31:54,680 --> 02:31:56,850
But unfortunately,

3359
02:31:57,680 --> 02:32:00,449
he won't be able to stay with us.

3360
02:32:00,450 --> 02:32:02,450
I'm very sad about that.

3361
02:32:02,719 --> 02:32:06,459
But JINWON is always a bright...

3362
02:32:06,590 --> 02:32:08,318
and positive person.

3363
02:32:08,319 --> 02:32:10,829
So I think good luck will follow him...

3364
02:32:11,159 --> 02:32:13,100
no matter where he goes.

3365
02:32:13,500 --> 02:32:15,159
I love you, JINWON.

3366
02:32:16,877 --> 02:32:17,829
I love you.

3367
02:32:22,440 --> 02:32:23,469
Well done.

3368
02:32:24,110 --> 02:32:25,708
(6th, Trainee KIM SUNGMIN)

3369
02:32:25,709 --> 02:32:26,739
Thank you.

3370
02:32:26,940 --> 02:32:28,010
Thank you.

3371
02:32:33,680 --> 02:32:34,750
I'll now announce...

3372
02:32:35,750 --> 02:32:38,420
the trainee in fifth place.

3373
02:32:38,690 --> 02:32:41,259
This is a trainee whose looks and skills...

3374
02:32:41,260 --> 02:32:43,489
are improving every day.

3375
02:32:43,930 --> 02:32:46,030
If it's the improvement of skills, it would be KYOUNGBAE.

3376
02:32:46,299 --> 02:32:47,659
SEUNGHO or YEOJUN?

3377
02:32:48,629 --> 02:32:50,670
Everyone's skills are improving.

3378
02:32:50,899 --> 02:32:52,229
Does it mean consistent improvement?

3379
02:32:53,399 --> 02:32:56,770
(Will 1 of these 3 be in 5th place?)

3380
02:32:58,739 --> 02:33:01,940
This trainee has charming eyes that fold in half when he smiles.

3381
02:33:02,780 --> 02:33:04,049
- It's KYOUNGBAE. - KYOUNGBAE.

3382
02:33:04,450 --> 02:33:05,850
- It's KYOUNGBAE. - It's KYOUNGBAE.

3383
02:33:05,979 --> 02:33:06,979
It's KYOUNGBAE.

3384
02:33:09,850 --> 02:33:10,889
Is it me?

3385
02:33:11,250 --> 02:33:12,319
It's SEUNGHO.

3386
02:33:13,120 --> 02:33:14,120
(Smiling)

3387
02:33:14,121 --> 02:33:15,659
Me? Really?

3388
02:33:17,290 --> 02:33:19,129
YEOJUN's eyes fold in half too.

3389
02:33:22,159 --> 02:33:23,170
KENSHIN?

3390
02:33:25,799 --> 02:33:27,199
This trainee received a global voting score...

3391
02:33:27,200 --> 02:33:30,638
of 2,044,509 points.

3392
02:33:30,639 --> 02:33:32,540
(A global voting score of 2,044,509 points)

3393
02:33:33,979 --> 02:33:35,808
It's Trainee SONG SEUNGHO.

3394
02:33:35,809 --> 02:33:36,978
(5th, Trainee SONG SEUNGHO)

3395
02:33:36,979 --> 02:33:37,979
Congratulations.

3396
02:33:38,950 --> 02:33:40,350
Your ranking rose a lot.

3397
02:33:40,920 --> 02:33:42,450
It's Trainee SONG SEUNGHO.

3398
02:33:42,950 --> 02:33:44,819
It's SEUNGHO.

3399
02:33:45,049 --> 02:33:46,459
His ranking rose, right?

3400
02:33:46,819 --> 02:33:48,120
- Yes. - Right?

3401
02:33:48,590 --> 02:33:49,690
Goodness.

3402
02:33:50,889 --> 02:33:52,389
SEUNGHO keeps going up.

3403
02:33:53,030 --> 02:33:56,329
Team "LALALALA" that SEUNGHO was in won,

3404
02:33:56,430 --> 02:33:59,369
and he took a global voting score...

3405
02:33:59,370 --> 02:34:01,200
of 50,000 points from IM SIU.

3406
02:34:02,139 --> 02:34:04,409
He won because of the benefit.

3407
02:34:05,639 --> 02:34:08,409
Many of you will remember his voice...

3408
02:34:08,780 --> 02:34:11,309
that nailed the intro of "LALALALA."

3409
02:34:11,950 --> 02:34:13,679
He was a different person compared to when he cried...

3410
02:34:13,680 --> 02:34:16,619
because of the burden in Team "SHALALA."

3411
02:34:16,620 --> 02:34:19,189
He showed us his perfect looks and skills...

3412
02:34:19,190 --> 02:34:22,360
that amazed the World Assemblers.

3413
02:34:23,090 --> 02:34:25,888
I want to thank the World Assemblers...

3414
02:34:25,889 --> 02:34:29,899
for making me be in 5th place from 14th place.

3415
02:34:31,030 --> 02:34:34,440
I want to thank Team "LALALA"'s members...

3416
02:34:34,899 --> 02:34:38,139
for helping me enjoy the stage with them.

3417
02:34:38,569 --> 02:34:39,909
Also,

3418
02:34:40,309 --> 02:34:43,349
I had a hard time because the style of the rap...

3419
02:34:43,350 --> 02:34:44,578
wasn't what I usually do.

3420
02:34:44,579 --> 02:34:46,579
But I think I was able to do it well...

3421
02:34:46,879 --> 02:34:48,579
because of MINWOOK's help.

3422
02:34:48,680 --> 02:34:51,949
I'll try harder to keep improving.

3423
02:34:51,950 --> 02:34:53,090
Thank you.

3424
02:34:56,129 --> 02:34:58,290
(5th, Trainee SONG SEUNGHO)

3425
02:34:58,760 --> 02:35:00,229
You would make your debut.

3426
02:35:00,860 --> 02:35:02,229
This is trouble.

3427
02:35:03,170 --> 02:35:06,200
I'll announce the trainee in fourth place.

3428
02:35:06,799 --> 02:35:08,370
Will it be KYOUNGBAE and YEOJUN?

3429
02:35:08,969 --> 02:35:11,709
Will it be YEOJUN and KYOUNGBAE, or KYOUNGBAE and YEOJUN?

3430
02:35:11,770 --> 02:35:16,010
This is a trainee who is working harder with time...

3431
02:35:16,110 --> 02:35:18,309
for the debut that he desperately wants.

3432
02:35:18,750 --> 02:35:19,920
It must be YEOJUN.

3433
02:35:20,250 --> 02:35:22,020
(4th, JANG YEOJUN)

3434
02:35:22,049 --> 02:35:23,290
I think it's SEO KYOUNGBAE.

3435
02:35:23,690 --> 02:35:25,620
Really? I think KYOUNGBAE would have a higher rank.

3436
02:35:26,360 --> 02:35:27,958
He received a global voting score...

3437
02:35:27,959 --> 02:35:32,530
of 2,542,295 points.

3438
02:35:32,729 --> 02:35:33,899
It's 500,000 points higher?

3439
02:35:34,829 --> 02:35:36,100
I got 500,000 points.

3440
02:35:39,899 --> 02:35:42,138
It's Trainee JANG YEOJUN.

3441
02:35:42,139 --> 02:35:43,308
(4th, Trainee JANG YEOJUN)

3442
02:35:43,309 --> 02:35:44,408
Congratulations.

3443
02:35:44,409 --> 02:35:45,770
Congratulations.

3444
02:35:45,809 --> 02:35:47,440
Thank you.

3445
02:35:48,440 --> 02:35:50,850
(4th, JANG YEOJUN)

3446
02:35:52,379 --> 02:35:53,979
How high will KYOUNGBAE be?

3447
02:35:54,920 --> 02:35:56,889
How high is KYOUNGBAE going?

3448
02:35:59,690 --> 02:36:00,989
This doesn't make sense.

3449
02:36:01,520 --> 02:36:03,658
I'm really thankful...

3450
02:36:03,659 --> 02:36:06,530
that I can compete...

3451
02:36:06,860 --> 02:36:08,898
with such talented people...

3452
02:36:08,899 --> 02:36:10,899
through PROJECT 7.

3453
02:36:11,229 --> 02:36:13,769
There are many talented...

3454
02:36:13,770 --> 02:36:16,909
and good-looking trainees in the waiting area.

3455
02:36:17,309 --> 02:36:20,540
CHANYONG is also in the waiting area.

3456
02:36:21,040 --> 02:36:22,879
I feel sorry...

3457
02:36:23,244 --> 02:36:24,750
and thankful.

3458
02:36:25,049 --> 02:36:27,620
I'm not sure what to say,

3459
02:36:28,137 --> 02:36:29,920
but there's something I really want to say.

3460
02:36:30,049 --> 02:36:32,860
Out of the five years...

3461
02:36:33,449 --> 02:36:35,819
I've seen him,

3462
02:36:36,260 --> 02:36:37,959
he was the coolest on the stage...

3463
02:36:39,290 --> 02:36:41,799
in PROJECT 7.

3464
02:36:42,602 --> 02:36:43,799
That's what I want to tell him.

3465
02:36:44,129 --> 02:36:45,899
This isn't the end,

3466
02:36:46,270 --> 02:36:50,409
so I hope I can see him again looking awesome.

3467
02:36:53,510 --> 02:36:55,209
At first,

3468
02:36:55,940 --> 02:36:58,110
before this show began,

3469
02:36:58,909 --> 02:37:01,250
we told each other that we should make our debut here...

3470
02:37:01,620 --> 02:37:05,318
and leave our difficult past behind us.

3471
02:37:05,319 --> 02:37:08,190
I'm very sorry that I won't be with him in that.

3472
02:37:08,860 --> 02:37:09,930
Yes.

3473
02:37:11,930 --> 02:37:13,829
If he makes his debut...

3474
02:37:14,200 --> 02:37:15,958
and continues his career,

3475
02:37:15,959 --> 02:37:18,629
I'll work hard and make a debut.

3476
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:21,299
And go on to the stage, so wait for me.

3477
02:37:21,469 --> 02:37:22,569
You went through a lot.

3478
02:37:28,809 --> 02:37:29,979
I'm tearing up.

3479
02:37:30,979 --> 02:37:32,978
I said sorry because...

3480
02:37:32,979 --> 02:37:35,578
I was eliminated too soon although I'm older than him.

3481
02:37:35,579 --> 02:37:37,189
Seeing him crying endlessly...

3482
02:37:37,190 --> 02:37:39,458
reminded me of how he was when he was younger,

3483
02:37:39,459 --> 02:37:40,819
so it broke my heart.

3484
02:37:40,920 --> 02:37:44,558
I feel sorry that only I survived.

3485
02:37:44,559 --> 02:37:48,360
CHANYONG joined this show saying it was his last chance,

3486
02:37:48,430 --> 02:37:50,328
and I hope he keeps challenging...

3487
02:37:50,329 --> 02:37:52,898
making a stepping stone of this opportunity.

3488
02:37:52,899 --> 02:37:54,670
(They hope to see a day they can smile on the stage together.)

3489
02:37:56,569 --> 02:37:59,979
(Trainee JANG YEOJUN ranked 4th.)

3490
02:38:07,879 --> 02:38:11,190
Now, I'll announce the trainee in third place.

3491
02:38:11,450 --> 02:38:15,159
This person is the best at absorbing PROJECT 7's training system,

3492
02:38:15,520 --> 02:38:17,429
and he made progress so fast.

3493
02:38:17,430 --> 02:38:18,589
(The trainee who progressed so fast)

3494
02:38:18,590 --> 02:38:20,729
KYOUNGBAE, stand up.

3495
02:38:21,700 --> 02:38:22,930
His global voting score...

3496
02:38:23,829 --> 02:38:25,870
recorded...

3497
02:38:26,870 --> 02:38:29,039
2,596,704 points.

3498
02:38:29,040 --> 02:38:30,040
(Global voting score of 2,596,704 points)

3499
02:38:30,340 --> 02:38:32,739
It's one million points different from mine.

3500
02:38:34,239 --> 02:38:35,439
(3rd, SEO KYOUNGBAE, as of the 5th week)

3501
02:38:35,440 --> 02:38:36,809
KYOUNGBAE has a high possibility.

3502
02:38:37,180 --> 02:38:38,208
There could be a twist.

3503
02:38:38,209 --> 02:38:39,249
(2nd, JEON MINWOOK, as of the 5th week)

3504
02:38:39,250 --> 02:38:40,450
KYOUNGBAE can go up to second place.

3505
02:38:40,520 --> 02:38:42,578
I'll bet the other way. It could be KENSHIN.

3506
02:38:42,579 --> 02:38:43,850
(1st, SAKURADA KENSHIN, as of the 5th week)

3507
02:38:47,459 --> 02:38:49,058
Trainee SEO KYOUNGBAE.

3508
02:38:49,059 --> 02:38:50,589
(3rd, Trainee SEO KYOUNGBAE)

3509
02:38:50,590 --> 02:38:51,690
Congratulations.

3510
02:38:52,229 --> 02:38:56,128
(3rd, SEO KYOUNGBAE, 2,596,704 points)

3511
02:38:56,129 --> 02:38:57,229
I'm glad.

3512
02:38:57,969 --> 02:39:00,068
- KYOUNGBAE. - KYOUNGBAE.

3513
02:39:00,069 --> 02:39:01,939
(3rd, SEO KYOUNGBAE)

3514
02:39:01,940 --> 02:39:04,839
Trainee SEO KYOUNGBAE is a self-taught trainee.

3515
02:39:04,840 --> 02:39:06,540
He only practiced at home.

3516
02:39:07,209 --> 02:39:09,239
Through training together in PROJECT 7,

3517
02:39:09,579 --> 02:39:11,208
his skills in performance improved quickly,

3518
02:39:11,209 --> 02:39:13,950
and he developed to be a most outstanding trainee.

3519
02:39:14,319 --> 02:39:16,590
He was ranked 19th in the 1st week,

3520
02:39:16,719 --> 02:39:18,690
he rose to 7th in the 1st Passing Ceremony,

3521
02:39:18,950 --> 02:39:22,219
and he soared to the current 3rd,

3522
02:39:22,719 --> 02:39:24,430
proving himself.

3523
02:39:25,260 --> 02:39:28,430
Actually, I thought it would be impossible.

3524
02:39:28,860 --> 02:39:31,670
I thought I had limits...

3525
02:39:32,229 --> 02:39:35,899
in becoming an idol,

3526
02:39:36,469 --> 02:39:39,138
but this show, PROJECT 7,

3527
02:39:39,139 --> 02:39:41,809
came to me like a miracle.

3528
02:39:42,180 --> 02:39:45,209
I won't let this opportunity go, and I'll do my best.

3529
02:39:45,649 --> 02:39:49,420
This ranking wasn't achieved by myself.

3530
02:39:50,149 --> 02:39:53,818
I think it was made possible thanks to help from many people.

3531
02:39:53,819 --> 02:39:57,988
I won't flatter myself, and work harder.

3532
02:39:57,989 --> 02:39:59,090
Thank you.

3533
02:40:02,700 --> 02:40:04,828
- He took third place. - He rose up to there.

3534
02:40:04,829 --> 02:40:06,170
(3rd, Trainee SEO KYOUNGBAE)

3535
02:40:07,500 --> 02:40:10,669
Now we have only two seats left,

3536
02:40:10,670 --> 02:40:12,009
each for 1st and 2nd.

3537
02:40:12,010 --> 02:40:13,139
(Rankings left are 1st and 2nd.)

3538
02:40:13,340 --> 02:40:16,139
The 2nd Passing Ceremony of PROJECT 7.

3539
02:40:17,010 --> 02:40:19,648
I'll announce the trainee in the first place.

3540
02:40:19,649 --> 02:40:20,649
(A long-awaited trainee in 1st place is revealed.)

3541
02:40:20,650 --> 02:40:23,190
I'll announce the trainee in the first place.

3542
02:40:24,090 --> 02:40:26,020
I guess it will be KENSHIN.

3543
02:40:26,290 --> 02:40:27,718
I want to see KENSHIN smile.

3544
02:40:27,719 --> 02:40:30,159
(1st, SAKURADA KENSHIN, as of 5th week)

3545
02:40:30,829 --> 02:40:32,360
See how MINWOOK turned modest.

3546
02:40:32,959 --> 02:40:34,659
He's like that after being in second place.

3547
02:40:35,600 --> 02:40:38,899
In the 2nd Passing Ceremony of PROJECT 7, trainee in 1st place...

3548
02:40:51,510 --> 02:40:54,420
will be revealed soon.

3549
02:40:59,290 --> 02:41:00,658
(We'll come back soon.)

3550
02:41:00,659 --> 02:41:01,789
(Disappointed)

3551
02:41:01,790 --> 02:41:02,790
HOU GUANYI.

3552
02:41:03,059 --> 02:41:04,360
We'll come back after a commercial.

3553
02:41:06,530 --> 02:41:09,829
To announce the first, we'll reveal...

3554
02:41:10,270 --> 02:41:11,430
two candidates first.

3555
02:41:12,530 --> 02:41:13,899
It could be me and you.

3556
02:41:14,399 --> 02:41:15,569
No way.

3557
02:41:15,940 --> 02:41:17,109
The candidates for the first place...

3558
02:41:17,110 --> 02:41:20,639
(2 candidates for the 1st place)

3559
02:41:22,680 --> 02:41:24,479
Trainee JEON MINWOOK...

3560
02:41:26,149 --> 02:41:28,319
and Trainee SAKURADA KENSHIN.

3561
02:41:32,389 --> 02:41:33,719
It's a battle between those two.

3562
02:41:34,760 --> 02:41:35,819
It's a revenge match.

3563
02:41:36,690 --> 02:41:39,929
In the 1st Passing Ceremony, these 2 trainees...

3564
02:41:39,930 --> 02:41:41,728
were standing there.

3565
02:41:41,729 --> 02:41:44,569
Would the result today be the same as the first Passing Ceremony?

3566
02:41:45,030 --> 02:41:46,840
Please keep watching.

3567
02:41:47,969 --> 02:41:49,670
- Who won last time? - MINWOOK did.

3568
02:41:50,870 --> 02:41:52,670
KENSHIN took first place in the last voting.

3569
02:41:53,709 --> 02:41:55,479
They keep going back and forth.

3570
02:41:58,250 --> 02:42:02,850
The candidates for first place, JEON MINWOOK and SAKURADA KENSHIN,

3571
02:42:03,190 --> 02:42:06,458
both took a victory in Rival Matching...

3572
02:42:06,459 --> 02:42:10,190
and received 70,000 points.

3573
02:42:10,389 --> 02:42:11,790
It's so neck and neck.

3574
02:42:13,899 --> 02:42:15,759
- Trainee JEON MINWOOK. - Yes.

3575
02:42:15,760 --> 02:42:18,228
You took 1st place in the 1st Passing Ceremony,

3576
02:42:18,229 --> 02:42:21,099
and you're a candidate for 1st place in the 2nd Passing Ceremony again.

3577
02:42:21,100 --> 02:42:22,700
Do you think you can take first place?

3578
02:42:23,040 --> 02:42:25,870
Now that I'm standing here again with KENSHIN,

3579
02:42:27,579 --> 02:42:29,280
I want to take first place again.

3580
02:42:30,780 --> 02:42:31,879
All right.

3581
02:42:31,979 --> 02:42:34,280
He's a real go-getter.

3582
02:42:34,549 --> 02:42:36,790
- Trainee SAKURADA KENSHIN. - Yes.

3583
02:42:37,520 --> 02:42:40,488
With MINWOOK standing next to you,

3584
02:42:40,489 --> 02:42:42,959
it's already the second competition to take first place.

3585
02:42:43,159 --> 02:42:46,629
Please say a word to Trainee JEON MINWOOK.

3586
02:42:48,430 --> 02:42:53,340
I'd like to take first place too.

3587
02:42:56,200 --> 02:42:57,610
Goodness.

3588
02:42:58,239 --> 02:43:00,209
- Wait and see. - Wait and see.

3589
02:43:00,579 --> 02:43:04,809
The global voting scores by World Assemblers...

3590
02:43:05,450 --> 02:43:08,120
decided the result of PROJECT 7's 2nd Passing Ceremony.

3591
02:43:08,479 --> 02:43:10,319
The first place is revealed now.

3592
02:43:11,090 --> 02:43:12,719
- Are we going to be shocked? - Who's going to take it?

3593
02:43:16,959 --> 02:43:19,030
The trainee who took first place...

3594
02:43:19,459 --> 02:43:24,569
received the global voting score...

3595
02:43:25,829 --> 02:43:28,100
of 3,396,154 points.

3596
02:43:28,600 --> 02:43:29,840
He's out of my league.

3597
02:43:30,770 --> 02:43:31,770
Goodness.

3598
02:43:31,771 --> 02:43:33,979
There was a shorter term,
compared to the first Passing Ceremony.

3599
02:43:35,239 --> 02:43:36,649
Who's going to take it this time?

3600
02:43:38,079 --> 02:43:39,950
I think it will be KENSHIN.

3601
02:43:40,750 --> 02:43:42,520
I hope KENSHIN takes first place this time.

3602
02:43:42,979 --> 02:43:45,219
I think KENSHIN will take first place.

3603
02:43:45,750 --> 02:43:47,659
I predict MINWOOK is in first place.

3604
02:43:48,719 --> 02:43:49,959
It's MINWOOK and then KENSHIN.

3605
02:43:50,489 --> 02:43:51,729
I have no clue now.

3606
02:43:52,430 --> 02:43:54,499
How will the dynamics change?

3607
02:43:54,500 --> 02:43:55,530
(Which trainee will take 1st place?)

3608
02:43:55,930 --> 02:43:59,898
Gratefully, since they kept voting for me to take first place,

3609
02:43:59,899 --> 02:44:02,898
now, for World Assemblers,

3610
02:44:02,899 --> 02:44:04,340
I should keep taking first place.

3611
02:44:05,370 --> 02:44:08,479
I want to take first place more than MINWOOK does.

3612
02:44:11,450 --> 02:44:12,679
The trainee who took first place...

3613
02:44:12,680 --> 02:44:13,950
(The trainee in 1st place in the 2nd Passing Ceremony)

3614
02:44:17,120 --> 02:44:18,488
is Trainee JEON MINWOOK.

3615
02:44:18,489 --> 02:44:20,658
(1st, Trainee JEON MINWOOK)

3616
02:44:20,659 --> 02:44:21,860
Trainee JEON MINWOOK.

3617
02:44:22,620 --> 02:44:24,158
(1st, JEON MINWOOK, 3,396,154 points)

3618
02:44:24,159 --> 02:44:25,559
- It's unexpected. - Congratulations.

3619
02:44:26,329 --> 02:44:28,558
He won it back after all.

3620
02:44:28,559 --> 02:44:30,499
He's unbeatable.

3621
02:44:30,500 --> 02:44:32,628
(1st, JEON MINWOOK)

3622
02:44:32,629 --> 02:44:34,540
- He's currently in 1st place. - He kept 1st place.

3623
02:44:35,870 --> 02:44:38,209
- It didn't change. - KENSHIN did a good job too.

3624
02:44:39,639 --> 02:44:42,079
In the midway count last week,

3625
02:44:42,180 --> 02:44:44,450
KENSHIN took first place.

3626
02:44:45,110 --> 02:44:47,850
So thinking I'd take second place, sitting there,

3627
02:44:48,420 --> 02:44:52,719
I was thinking about the acceptance speech for second place.

3628
02:44:53,120 --> 02:44:55,059
I appreciate it so much.

3629
02:44:56,360 --> 02:44:59,289
While I'm PROJECT 7,

3630
02:44:59,290 --> 02:45:02,599
World Assemblers allow me to take first place.

3631
02:45:02,600 --> 02:45:06,739
I sincerely give my thanks to them.

3632
02:45:07,469 --> 02:45:10,010
I cannot say that I'm perfect yet,

3633
02:45:10,040 --> 02:45:11,709
but as I've been in first place all along so far,

3634
02:45:13,440 --> 02:45:17,149
I will prove that I deserve to remain in first place.

3635
02:45:17,209 --> 02:45:18,280
Thank you.

3636
02:45:22,579 --> 02:45:26,349
All right. The one who took second place, Trainee SAKURADA KENSHIN.

3637
02:45:26,350 --> 02:45:27,360
Yes.

3638
02:45:27,659 --> 02:45:33,759
In the global voting score, you received 3,393,536 points.

3639
02:45:33,760 --> 02:45:37,530
There was a slight difference from Trainee JEON MINWOOK's points.

3640
02:45:38,069 --> 02:45:40,139
That's right. It's less than 10,000 points difference.

3641
02:45:41,139 --> 02:45:43,909
World Assemblers, thank you for your voting.

3642
02:45:44,309 --> 02:45:46,569
Trainees love you.

3643
02:45:48,079 --> 02:45:49,180
I love them too.

3644
02:45:49,510 --> 02:45:53,110
Since I'm on good terms...

3645
02:45:54,379 --> 02:45:56,620
with all trainees,

3646
02:45:56,719 --> 02:46:00,790
when I look at those who didn't advance,

3647
02:46:01,790 --> 02:46:03,489
it breaks my heart so much.

3648
02:46:04,290 --> 02:46:05,559
SOTA,

3649
02:46:07,260 --> 02:46:08,430
ADAM,

3650
02:46:09,030 --> 02:46:10,170
YUSEI,

3651
02:46:10,930 --> 02:46:13,030
and everyone...

3652
02:46:13,399 --> 02:46:16,200
supported me.

3653
02:46:17,540 --> 02:46:20,079
Thanks to you, I could work hard here so far.

3654
02:46:22,040 --> 02:46:24,908
So, on behalf of everyone,

3655
02:46:24,909 --> 02:46:29,450
I'll practice harder.

3656
02:46:30,889 --> 02:46:35,620
I'll work harder.

3657
02:46:36,420 --> 02:46:37,629
I love you.

3658
02:46:38,430 --> 02:46:41,129
I'll practice harder. I love you.

3659
02:46:41,559 --> 02:46:45,628
I'll keep practicing harder.

3660
02:46:45,629 --> 02:46:46,599
Thank you.

3661
02:46:51,270 --> 02:46:55,179
World Assemblers' voting decides...

3662
02:46:55,180 --> 02:46:57,250
the 2nd Passing Ceremony of PROJECT 7.

3663
02:46:57,780 --> 02:46:59,780
Trainee JEON MINWOOK took first place,

3664
02:47:00,579 --> 02:47:03,180
and Trainee SAKURADA KENSHIN took second place.

3665
02:47:04,319 --> 02:47:06,089
Congratulations, everyone.

3666
02:47:06,090 --> 02:47:07,158
(Announcement of 35 trainees who passed is complete.)

3667
02:47:07,159 --> 02:47:09,360
- KENSHIN is crying. - Goodness.

3668
02:47:12,930 --> 02:47:15,759
We have 35 trainees selected by World Assemblers.

3669
02:47:15,760 --> 02:47:18,628
They will continue with their challenge...

3670
02:47:18,629 --> 02:47:21,899
in PROJECT 7 from now on.

3671
02:47:22,440 --> 02:47:23,870
I congratulate you heartily.

3672
02:47:25,709 --> 02:47:27,139
Congratulations.

3673
02:47:27,780 --> 02:47:28,979
Thank you for your cooperation.

3674
02:47:29,340 --> 02:47:31,409
We started with 200 trainees,

3675
02:47:31,680 --> 02:47:33,979
and now only 35 trainees are left.

3676
02:47:34,379 --> 02:47:36,989
It also means you're closer to the debut.

3677
02:47:37,719 --> 02:47:39,389
Trainees of PROJECT 7,

3678
02:47:39,450 --> 02:47:41,559
greet World Assemblers.

3679
02:47:41,690 --> 02:47:43,459
- We'll do our best! - We'll do our best!

3680
02:47:58,370 --> 02:48:03,408
(The result of the 2nd Individual Vote)

3681

3691
02:48:29,170 --> 02:48:30,339
Goodbye.

3692
02:48:30,340 --> 02:48:31,839
(The 2nd Passing Ceremony is over.)

3693
02:48:31,840 --> 02:48:33,409
You worked hard.

3694
02:48:33,510 --> 02:48:35,078
I feel lighthearted.

3695
02:48:35,079 --> 02:48:36,079
(It's time to say goodbye again.)

3696
02:48:36,209 --> 02:48:37,609
We've worked hard.

3697
02:48:37,610 --> 02:48:39,609
JIAHN, I congratulate you from the bottom of my heart!

3698
02:48:39,610 --> 02:48:41,280
I congratulate you heartily.

3699
02:48:41,350 --> 02:48:42,519
I support you,

3700
02:48:42,520 --> 02:48:44,488
- and I'll promote you outside. - Thank you.

3701
02:48:44,489 --> 02:48:46,620
- I'll tell people to vote for you. - Thank you.

3702
02:48:46,889 --> 02:48:48,860
- Go for it. - You've been through a lot.

3703
02:48:49,559 --> 02:48:50,690
You worked hard.

3704
02:48:51,260 --> 02:48:52,430
Let's hug.

3705
02:48:53,129 --> 02:48:55,200
I can't see you here after this.

3706
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:57,129
Gosh.

3707
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:00,340
I wanted to work with you more.

3708
02:49:02,899 --> 02:49:04,209
He's crying again.

3709
02:49:05,409 --> 02:49:08,309
I wanted to perform with you just once.

3710
02:49:08,780 --> 02:49:11,010
How come performing together is so hard?

3711
02:49:11,079 --> 02:49:12,350
Seriously.

3712
02:49:12,909 --> 02:49:14,979
It's all right.

3713
02:49:17,350 --> 02:49:20,459
You went through a lot...

3714
02:49:21,489 --> 02:49:23,489
at such a young age.

3715
02:49:24,989 --> 02:49:26,059
JUNWOO,

3716
02:49:26,729 --> 02:49:28,299
you'll go to a better place.

3717
02:49:30,059 --> 02:49:33,329
I won't forget the friends I met...

3718
02:49:33,969 --> 02:49:37,040
and experiences I had here.

3719
02:49:37,540 --> 02:49:39,969
It was an experience I won't exchange for anything.

3720
02:49:41,709 --> 02:49:43,378
ABE YURA and KENSHIN.

3721
02:49:43,379 --> 02:49:45,549
- What is it? - Here you go.

3722
02:49:47,620 --> 02:49:48,620
What's this?

3723
02:49:49,549 --> 02:49:53,559
When you feel exhausted, read this and cheer up.

3724
02:49:54,260 --> 02:49:55,519
Thank you.

3725
02:49:55,520 --> 02:49:57,229
I wrote this in the dormitory.

3726
02:49:58,260 --> 02:50:03,829
I said it would be the last time for me the other day.

3727
02:50:04,129 --> 02:50:07,369
So I thought about what I could do,

3728
02:50:07,370 --> 02:50:08,940
and I wrote this.

3729
02:50:09,639 --> 02:50:10,709
Thank you.

3730
02:50:11,239 --> 02:50:12,670
- He got this. - From whom?

3731
02:50:12,870 --> 02:50:13,879
YUSEI.

3732
02:50:19,750 --> 02:50:22,350
I made so many good friends here,

3733
02:50:22,620 --> 02:50:24,520
so I feel very happy.

3734
02:50:25,049 --> 02:50:28,620
I learned one by one during the experiences I had.

3735
02:50:28,860 --> 02:50:33,430
To remain in the memory for a long time...

3736
02:50:33,760 --> 02:50:35,459
I won't be afraid of facing difficulties.

3737
02:50:36,399 --> 02:50:38,829
I'll progress and come back again.

3738
02:50:41,139 --> 02:50:44,569
Although my journey in PROJECT 7 ends here...

3739
02:50:45,270 --> 02:50:47,879
On behalf of 35 of us...

3740
02:50:48,040 --> 02:50:49,379
Show what you got nicely on the stage.

3741
02:50:49,680 --> 02:50:52,149
I hope you don't get into an accident or get injured.

3742
02:50:52,350 --> 02:50:54,218
Make sure you advance to the final stage.

3743
02:50:54,219 --> 02:50:58,090
Be the main figure you've dreamed of, an idol singer.

3744
02:50:58,190 --> 02:51:01,190
I hope we can make a debut.

3745
02:51:02,190 --> 02:51:03,959
When we were filming the music video of "RUN,"

3746
02:51:05,159 --> 02:51:06,590
as confetti was falling,

3747
02:51:07,360 --> 02:51:08,930
after the Ending Fairy filming,

3748
02:51:08,959 --> 02:51:10,370
we looked at each other's faces.

3749
02:51:10,469 --> 02:51:12,170
They were all crying.

3750
02:51:13,129 --> 02:51:15,239
We were running toward one goal.

3751
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:17,691
I loved the atmosphere.

3752
02:51:21,280 --> 02:51:24,209
Let's get together later.

3753
02:51:24,680 --> 02:51:25,528
I love you.

3754
02:51:28,879 --> 02:51:30,318
(PROJECT 7 will root for every trainee...)

3755
02:51:30,319 --> 02:51:33,049
(who's been in the show so far.)

3756
02:51:35,090 --> 02:51:36,519
World Assemblers,

3757
02:51:36,520 --> 02:51:38,260
the voting so far is reset.

3758
02:51:38,659 --> 02:51:41,959
The third global voting of PROJECT 7 begins now.

3759
02:51:42,559 --> 02:51:45,099
You can participate in the voting...

3760
02:51:45,100 --> 02:51:47,139
on the official PROJECT 7 platform once a day.

3761
02:51:47,540 --> 02:51:50,969
Access to the PROJECT 7 community and click on the link...

3762
02:51:51,209 --> 02:51:53,239
to participate in two kinds of voting.

3763
02:51:53,469 --> 02:51:55,110
The first one is Individual Vote.

3764
02:51:55,450 --> 02:51:56,978
Among 35 trainees,

3765
02:51:56,979 --> 02:51:59,450
select three trainees you support.

3766
02:51:59,792 --> 02:52:03,219
After completing Individual Vote,
click on the "Next vote" button.

3767
02:52:03,690 --> 02:52:06,290
The second one is Final Matching Assembly Vote.

3768
02:52:06,612 --> 02:52:09,459
The new songs of PROJECT 7 are revealed now.

3769
02:52:36,286 --> 02:53:09,924
(Preview of new songs in Final Round: "ACT UP")

3770
02:53:36,184 --> 02:54:14,701
(Preview of new songs in Final Round: "Antidote")

3771
02:54:15,479 --> 02:55:16,633
(Preview of new songs in Final Round: "PSYCHO")

3772
02:55:18,850 --> 02:55:20,879
After listening to all three new songs revealed,

3773
02:55:21,149 --> 02:55:24,120
assemble trainees that match the songs.

3774
02:55:24,489 --> 02:55:25,988
Click on the "Assemble" button,

3775
02:55:25,989 --> 02:55:29,520
select seven trainees who match the most for each song,

3776
02:55:29,760 --> 02:55:32,760
and press the "Complete" button to complete your participation.

3777
02:55:32,829 --> 02:55:35,899
Your votes are reflected only after completing two votes,

3778
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:37,469
so don't forget to participate in both.

3779
02:55:37,569 --> 02:55:39,870
The third global voting of PROJECT 7.

3780
02:55:40,500 --> 02:55:43,299
Three, two, one.

3781
02:55:44,239 --> 02:55:45,408
It starts now.

3782
02:55:45,409 --> 02:55:50,409
(The voting starts right after Episode 8 ends.)

3783
02:55:51,180 --> 02:55:54,349
(Apply to watch the Final Round from November 29 to December 18.)

3784
02:55:54,350 --> 02:55:58,319
(For more details, please refer to the official SNS.)

3785
02:55:59,389 --> 02:56:02,090
(After the 2nd Passing Ceremony ends)

3786
02:56:06,430 --> 02:56:08,058
You survived the second Passing Ceremony,

3787
02:56:08,059 --> 02:56:11,370
and you are qualified to be assembled by World Assemblers.

3788
02:56:11,930 --> 02:56:14,170
Here are 35 trainees.

3789
02:56:15,465 --> 02:56:16,370
Now,

3790
02:56:16,569 --> 02:56:20,739
the fifth project is revealed.

3791
02:56:22,979 --> 02:56:24,180
- Here we go! - Let's go.

3792
02:56:26,209 --> 02:56:27,620
- What is that? - All right.

3793
02:56:28,438 --> 02:56:29,850
This project...

3794
02:56:32,120 --> 02:56:34,319
is Original Matching.

3795
02:56:35,219 --> 02:56:37,289
(Original Matching)

3796
02:56:37,290 --> 02:56:39,488
- Original Matching. - That's awesome.

3797
02:56:39,489 --> 02:56:40,489
This is nice.

3798
02:56:40,490 --> 02:56:42,898
While Position Matching and Rival Matching earlier...

3799
02:56:42,899 --> 02:56:44,469
were cover song missions,

3800
02:56:44,629 --> 02:56:47,129
for Original Matching,

3801
02:56:48,600 --> 02:56:51,270
you compete performing five new songs.

3802
02:56:52,909 --> 02:56:55,280
Trainees don't select the songs.

3803
02:56:55,309 --> 02:56:59,149
You will compete performing the songs...

3804
02:56:59,280 --> 02:57:00,950
as World Assemblers assemble you.

3805
02:57:01,979 --> 02:57:05,089
Which trainees are assembled to which songs?

3806
02:57:05,090 --> 02:57:07,690
I'll announce the results now.

3807
02:57:08,360 --> 02:57:10,760
- Why? Now? - What?

3808
02:57:11,129 --> 02:57:13,389
- They assembled us. - I have no idea.

3809
02:57:13,489 --> 02:57:14,499
Please.

3810
02:57:14,500 --> 02:57:16,459
Now, trainees whose name is called...

3811
02:57:17,100 --> 02:57:21,069
will go to the room into which they're assembled.

3812
02:57:21,469 --> 02:57:24,208
(They go to 5 practice rooms with the song title.)

3813
02:57:24,209 --> 02:57:27,440
Now I'll call the trainees. First place, Trainee JEON MINWOOK.

3814
02:57:28,540 --> 02:57:29,680
Right now?

3815
02:57:30,007 --> 02:57:31,208
Oh, my goodness.

3816
02:57:31,680 --> 02:57:34,420
Second place, Trainee SAKURADA KENSHIN.

3817
02:57:35,219 --> 02:57:36,219
Bye-bye.

3818
02:57:36,220 --> 02:57:38,389
Go to the rooms you're assigned.

3819
02:57:39,719 --> 02:57:40,760
Bye-bye.

3820
02:57:42,920 --> 02:57:45,829
(What awaits trainees?)

3821
02:57:47,760 --> 02:57:48,631
Hello.

3822
02:57:51,062 --> 02:57:52,162
Hello.

3823
02:57:54,540 --> 02:57:56,369
MINWOOK. Goodness.

3824
02:57:56,370 --> 02:57:57,370
(3 trainees in the Top 7 are assembled into the same team.)

3825
02:57:57,371 --> 02:58:00,639
You're two people that I predicted to be here.

3826
02:58:01,639 --> 02:58:02,739
- Good. - Both of you are here.

3827
02:58:04,397 --> 02:58:05,428
What is it?

3828
02:58:06,610 --> 02:58:07,850
What's this?

3829
02:58:08,120 --> 02:58:09,379
KYOUNGBAE is here too!

3830
02:58:11,250 --> 02:58:12,350
Wait a minute.

3831
02:58:12,462 --> 02:58:13,732
Why are you here?

3832
02:58:14,590 --> 02:58:15,689
YURA.

3833
02:58:15,690 --> 02:58:17,090
What?

3834
02:58:19,690 --> 02:58:20,829
What's going on?

3835
02:58:21,129 --> 02:58:22,559
Why is he here?

3836
02:58:22,760 --> 02:58:23,929
All right.

3837
02:58:23,930 --> 02:58:25,299
Wait. We're all vocalists.

3838
02:58:29,899 --> 02:58:30,968
(Unexpected assemblies unfold.)

3839
02:58:30,969 --> 02:58:33,309
- Close the door. - Close it.

3840
02:58:33,940 --> 02:58:35,439
Someone entered the wrong room earlier.

3841
02:58:35,440 --> 02:58:36,610
ANDY!

3842
02:58:39,549 --> 02:58:40,879
Yes!

3843
02:58:41,450 --> 02:58:43,478
I think this is right.

3844
02:58:43,479 --> 02:58:44,488
(Check out the preview of new songs on the PROJECT 7's YouTube channel.)

3845
02:58:44,489 --> 02:58:46,019
(KIM HYUNWOO, LYNNLYNN, MAJINGXIANG, PARK JUNSEO,)

3846
02:58:46,020 --> 02:58:47,458
(YICHEN, JANG YEOJUN, JEON MINWOOK)

3847
02:58:47,459 --> 02:58:49,019
(KIM SUNGMIN, NAM JIWOON, SAKURADA KENSHIN, SEO KYOUNGBAE,)

3848
02:58:49,020 --> 02:58:50,458
(SONG SEUNGHO, ANDY, JUNG SEYUN)

3849
02:58:50,459 --> 02:58:52,328
(KIM SIHUN, KIM JEONGMIN, KIM JOOHYUN, KIM JOONWOO,)

3850
02:58:52,329 --> 02:58:53,488
(LEE GUNWOO, CHAE HEEJU, FONG ATILLA)

3851
02:58:53,489 --> 02:58:55,359
(SHIN JAEWON, BINGHUA, OH TAEHWAN, WU CHENYU,)

3852
02:58:55,360 --> 02:58:56,599
(WOO HAJOON, YOO YOUNGSEO, LEE HANBIN)

3853
02:58:56,600 --> 02:58:57,929
(KANG MINSEO, KANG HYUNWOO, KWON YONGHYUN, ABE YURA,)

3854
02:58:57,930 --> 02:58:59,170
(ASAKA KOTARO, AHN JUNWON, YU JIAHN)

3855
02:59:00,000 --> 02:59:02,700
(A new project begins.)

3856
02:59:04,069 --> 02:59:05,769
(Seven of us are assembled like this.)

3857
02:59:05,770 --> 02:59:06,770
I felt confident.

3858
02:59:07,110 --> 02:59:09,479
(100 percent satisfied with the assembly)

3859
02:59:09,909 --> 02:59:12,309
(While trainees are getting ambitious)

3860
02:59:13,079 --> 02:59:15,079
(I actually came to the team I didn't want to.)

3861
02:59:15,450 --> 02:59:17,049
(True feelings are revealed.)

3862
02:59:18,020 --> 02:59:20,250
(They face limits.)

3863
02:59:20,690 --> 02:59:22,219
(So who's the main vocalist?)

3864
02:59:22,590 --> 02:59:24,389
(The part distribution gets fiercer.)

3865
02:59:24,760 --> 02:59:26,489
(Self-evaluations follow.)

3866
02:59:26,860 --> 02:59:28,659
(The evaluation made me collapse today.)

3867
02:59:28,829 --> 02:59:31,200
("The facial expression, dance, and vocal ability are a mess.")

3868
02:59:31,770 --> 02:59:33,670
("I argued a lot with team members due to my personality.")

3869
02:59:34,150 --> 02:59:35,480
(What you said is incoherent.)

3870
02:59:35,700 --> 02:59:37,398
(I felt very angry.)

3871
02:59:37,399 --> 02:59:38,809
Does he have to express it like this?

3872
02:59:39,040 --> 02:59:40,309
(I really wanted to kill him.)

3873
02:59:41,139 --> 02:59:42,709
(I don't want to do this at all.)

3874
02:59:45,010 --> 02:59:47,350
(What endings await the trainees on the edge of a cliff?)

3875
02:59:49,180 --> 02:59:52,989
(PROJECT 7)
