(The journey for the perfect 7)

00:00:09,717 --> 00:00:10,956
PROJECT 7.

4
00:00:12,057 --> 00:00:14,086
(The beginning of the Assembly)

5
00:00:14,087 --> 00:00:16,557
(Self Assembly)

6
00:00:17,697 --> 00:00:20,365
(Trainees assembled
their teams on their own...)

7
00:00:20,366 --> 00:00:22,897
(and upgraded the teams.)

8
00:00:23,696 --> 00:00:26,176
(The Title Song performance was
made by assembly and upgrade.)

9
00:00:26,236 --> 00:00:27,805
(The second assembly)

(Vocal, dance, rap)

12
00:00:30,207 --> 00:00:32,005
(By assembling and upgrading once again, )

13
00:00:32,006 --> 00:00:34,406
(70 trainees survived.)

14
00:00:34,476 --> 00:00:35,876
(And)

15
00:00:36,317 --> 00:00:37,946
(World Assemblers participated...)

16
00:00:38,077 --> 00:00:40,287
(in the third assembly, Rival Matching.)

17
00:00:40,847 --> 00:00:43,957
(Two rival teams assembled by
World Assemblers' choice clashed.)

18
00:00:44,787 --> 00:00:47,186
(Contrasting results)

19
00:00:47,787 --> 00:00:50,327
(The fourth assembly, Original Matching)

20
00:00:50,626 --> 00:00:52,666
(Performing new songs...)

21
00:00:52,667 --> 00:00:55,527
(was the final test for the Final Match.)

22
00:00:55,896 --> 00:00:57,666
(Selected by World Assemblers
in about 180 countries...)

23
00:00:57,667 --> 00:00:59,866
(for 4 months' journey, )

24
00:00:59,867 --> 00:01:01,735
(21 trainees survived.)

25
00:01:01,736 --> 00:01:03,535
(Among them, the number
of people who can debut...)

26
00:01:03,536 --> 00:01:05,036
(is only 7.)

27
00:01:07,007 --> 00:01:09,076
(Surviving the Final Match, )

28
00:01:09,077 --> 00:01:16,356
(who will be the last 7...)

29
00:01:16,357 --> 00:01:18,486
(to run toward their goal of debuting?)

30
00:01:19,486 --> 00:01:20,786
You can do it!

31
00:01:22,456 --> 00:01:24,426
Nice!

32
00:01:24,727 --> 00:01:26,796
Go for it!

33
00:01:27,227 --> 00:01:31,296
("RUN" by PROJECT 7)

34
00:06:25,797 --> 00:06:31,166
(100 trainees ran together for 1 goal)

35
00:06:33,206 --> 00:06:36,636
("RUN")

36
00:06:36,637 --> 00:06:37,905
(The first step towards their dream)

37
00:06:37,906 --> 00:06:39,645
Hello. Thank you in advance.

38
00:06:39,646 --> 00:06:42,206
("RUN", the first step towards their dream)

39
00:06:43,177 --> 00:06:45,216
I wondered if I could have...

40
00:06:45,476 --> 00:06:47,915
a dream of being an idol.

41
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:51,786
It started with that question,
and I challenged myself first.

42
00:06:52,557 --> 00:06:56,057
There were so many awesome
people older than me in the waiting room,

43
00:06:56,127 --> 00:06:57,856
so I was very intimidated.

44
00:06:58,327 --> 00:07:00,497
At first, I thought it'd
be a good experience.

45
00:07:00,766 --> 00:07:02,526
I decided to enjoy it and do my best.

46
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:06,166
I was so excited about
starting something new.

47
00:07:07,637 --> 00:07:11,306
To those who thought I
won't be able to debut,

48
00:07:11,307 --> 00:07:13,006
I wanted to show that I could.

49
00:07:13,007 --> 00:07:16,247
This challenge started from that anger.

50
00:07:16,877 --> 00:07:19,987
So I decided to prove myself...

51
00:07:20,146 --> 00:07:22,855
and thought I could
debut if I prove myself.

52
00:07:22,856 --> 00:07:24,557
That's how I engaged myself in this.

53
00:07:25,516 --> 00:07:28,987
I began to dream of being an
idol when I was ten years old,

54
00:07:29,057 --> 00:07:31,827
and I've run for it until
now without a break.

55
00:07:34,197 --> 00:07:36,336
I had so many moments of trouble.

56
00:07:36,637 --> 00:07:37,936
So many of them.

57
00:07:37,937 --> 00:07:38,937
(The infinite unknown: Our
dream wasn't an easy one.)

58
00:07:38,938 --> 00:07:41,336
I have been a trainee since I was little.

59
00:07:42,466 --> 00:07:44,036
As I experienced a slump,

60
00:07:44,106 --> 00:07:46,247
there were so many
moments I wanted to give up.

61
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:49,145
I wanted to become an idol,

62
00:07:49,146 --> 00:07:52,447
so I came to Korea alone, and it was tough.

63
00:07:52,687 --> 00:07:54,716
But I practiced hard.

64
00:07:56,086 --> 00:07:59,786
I was most worried about
doing well in the show.

65
00:07:59,987 --> 00:08:01,867
I participated in the
show risking many things.

66
00:08:02,257 --> 00:08:05,257
I'm afraid I might not
show anything I have here.

67
00:08:05,456 --> 00:08:07,965
Compared to what I thought,

68
00:08:07,966 --> 00:08:10,997
I might not be good enough.

69
00:08:11,297 --> 00:08:15,666
So I wanted to give up many times.

70
00:08:17,276 --> 00:08:19,746
(We could get this far thanks to...)

71
00:08:19,747 --> 00:08:22,947
("Up to you")

72
00:08:24,917 --> 00:08:28,287
I realized that there are
people who came to see me.

73
00:08:28,447 --> 00:08:29,786
It just feels like a dream.

74
00:08:29,787 --> 00:08:33,226
I wonder if everything I'm
doing now is reality or not.

75
00:08:34,057 --> 00:08:35,986
Every word of support...

76
00:08:36,496 --> 00:08:39,667
really encourages me,
and I appreciate that.

77
00:08:39,797 --> 00:08:43,136
I've found the reason
why I want to perform.

78
00:08:43,496 --> 00:08:47,706
For those people, I've decided
to make it, no matter what.

79
00:08:48,267 --> 00:08:49,436
I worked hard.

80
00:08:49,437 --> 00:08:51,235
I worked hard with all my heart.

81
00:08:51,236 --> 00:08:52,475
(I'm running, I'm almost there)

82
00:08:52,476 --> 00:08:54,907
I'll give the last performance here soon.

83
00:08:55,307 --> 00:08:57,316
Getting this far...

84
00:08:57,317 --> 00:08:59,586
was very intense.

85
00:08:59,787 --> 00:09:03,986
I didn't think I'd make
it to the Final Match.

86
00:09:04,287 --> 00:09:07,027
I'm afraid it might be my last performance.

87
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:11,096
My dream of making a debut
became more desperate.

88
00:09:11,297 --> 00:09:14,866
I could run this far since I
wanted to realize my dream.

89
00:09:15,626 --> 00:09:18,336
I want to shine on the stage.

90
00:09:19,437 --> 00:09:22,976
I want to be an idol and realize my dream.

91
00:09:23,476 --> 00:09:26,677
- My dream... - My dream...

92
00:09:26,907 --> 00:09:28,246
It's making my debut.

93
00:09:28,807 --> 00:09:30,716
The dream of making my
debut was the beginning.

94
00:09:30,976 --> 00:09:33,547
When I started to dream
it, I met PROJECT 7.

95
00:09:34,017 --> 00:09:35,586
Since it's the last performance,

96
00:09:35,917 --> 00:09:38,755
I want to give a performance
that I won't regret.

97
00:09:38,756 --> 00:09:41,196
(I want the last performance
to be something I won't regret.)

In September 2024,

100
00:10:17,756 --> 00:10:19,327
two hundred trainees,

101
00:10:20,067 --> 00:10:21,797
for a dream of becoming an idol,

102
00:10:22,096 --> 00:10:24,267
participated in PROJECT 7.

103
00:10:27,807 --> 00:10:29,037
And here, now,

104
00:10:30,037 --> 00:10:31,807
after going through five projects,

105
00:10:32,606 --> 00:10:34,647
twenty-one trainees who were...

106
00:10:35,077 --> 00:10:37,917
assembled and upgraded remain here.

107
00:10:51,297 --> 00:10:53,327
Twenty-one trainees here...

108
00:10:54,327 --> 00:10:55,847
are on the stage they've dreamed of...

109
00:10:56,267 --> 00:10:59,067
through PROJECT 7.

110
00:11:05,307 --> 00:11:06,577
And today, finally,

111
00:11:08,177 --> 00:11:09,277
these trainees...

112
00:11:10,017 --> 00:11:12,647
will complete the last
project for their dream,

113
00:11:13,746 --> 00:11:14,787
their debut.

114
00:11:20,226 --> 00:11:22,626
Who will be the trainees
selected by the World Assemblers...

115
00:11:22,827 --> 00:11:25,397
and make their debut?

116
00:11:32,297 --> 00:11:34,537
The top seven members who will debut...

117
00:11:34,907 --> 00:11:36,307
as a global top-class idol group...

118
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,706

the final project will be broadcast live.

122
00:11:57,927 --> 00:12:01,126
And the fates of the trainees...

123
00:12:01,996 --> 00:12:03,897
depend on the last global voting.

124
00:12:05,037 --> 00:12:07,106
The voting begins now.

(PROJECT 7's real-time
global voting for the Final Match)

131
00:12:44,206 --> 00:12:45,676
The final result of the
Final Match is decided...

132
00:12:45,677 --> 00:12:48,447

and the Director's benefit score.

The real-time global voting...

136
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:00,386
is available on PROJECT

137

141
00:13:10,966 --> 00:13:12,596
The first one is the Individual Vote.

142
00:13:13,336 --> 00:13:17,335
Among 21 trainees,
select 1 trainee you support,

143
00:13:17,336 --> 00:13:19,653
(Vote 1 trainee you support. It
will be reflected in the ranking.)

144
00:13:19,677 --> 00:13:22,505
Second, the Assembly
Vote for the final debut group.

145
00:13:22,506 --> 00:13:23,745
(Select 7 trainees you want to
assemble your very own idols.)

00:14:59,577 --> 00:15:01,705
Hello, I'm MC Lee Soo Hyuk.

184
00:15:01,706 --> 00:15:06,147
(MC Lee Soo Hyuk)

185
00:15:10,356 --> 00:15:12,816
It's already been four months...

186
00:15:12,817 --> 00:15:15,187
since I met the World Assemblers.

187
00:15:16,157 --> 00:15:19,966
I remember that when I first met you...

188
00:15:20,496 --> 00:15:22,996
I felt as nervous as the trainees.

189
00:15:23,496 --> 00:15:26,506
And I still can't forget...

190
00:15:26,907 --> 00:15:28,966
the trainees' eyes that had dreams...

191
00:15:29,807 --> 00:15:32,777
when they first appeared on the stage.

192
00:15:34,277 --> 00:15:35,446
Every Friday,

193
00:15:35,447 --> 00:15:38,317
I was so happy to meet
the World Assemblers.

194
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:42,886
Until now, we've seen the Zero Setting,

195
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:46,827
the Title Song, the Position Matching,

196
00:15:47,586 --> 00:15:48,725
the Rival Matching,

197
00:15:48,726 --> 00:15:49,786
(KIM SIHUN)

198
00:15:49,787 --> 00:15:50,956
and the Original Matching.

199
00:15:52,956 --> 00:15:54,427
World Assemblers saw...

200
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:57,037
every moment...

201
00:15:57,636 --> 00:16:00,907
the trainees grew, staying closest to them.

202
00:16:08,307 --> 00:16:10,716
Now, we have...

203
00:16:12,517 --> 00:16:13,886
only one left,

204
00:16:15,116 --> 00:16:17,716
the last project to
assemble the debut team.

205
00:16:24,397 --> 00:16:26,226
Among 200 trainees...

206
00:16:26,927 --> 00:16:30,336
who participated in PROJECT 7,

207
00:16:31,267 --> 00:16:33,136
only 21 trainees are waiting...

208
00:16:34,106 --> 00:16:38,506
for the last votes by the World Assemblers.

209
00:16:44,547 --> 00:16:48,116
Since all 21 trainees are qualified...

210
00:16:48,886 --> 00:16:50,787
with talents to be an idol,

211
00:16:51,356 --> 00:16:54,626
it's very difficult to predict
which one will debut.

212
00:16:57,656 --> 00:16:58,727
Tonight,

213
00:16:59,997 --> 00:17:03,366
by your votes, World Assemblers,

214
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,336
the debut team members will be selected.

215
00:17:10,777 --> 00:17:11,807
Starting today,

216
00:17:12,807 --> 00:17:15,477
according to the global voting score,

217
00:17:16,047 --> 00:17:18,277
a total of 7 people in 1st to 7th place...

218
00:17:18,717 --> 00:17:20,346
are not trainees anymore.

219
00:17:20,787 --> 00:17:24,287
They will take the first step
as an idol through a debut.

220
00:17:33,696 --> 00:17:36,797
Since the third Passing Ceremony to today,

221
00:17:36,997 --> 00:17:40,436
the fourth global voting
has been on for a week.

222
00:17:40,807 --> 00:17:44,037
The real-time voting score
during the live broadcast...

223
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:45,606
and...

224
00:17:46,507 --> 00:17:48,747
the scores given by
the directors are added...

225
00:17:49,247 --> 00:17:52,777
to decide the final
ranking of the trainees.

226
00:17:56,386 --> 00:17:59,916
For the real-time voting, one
person can participate once.

227
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:03,156
It consists of the Individual
Vote and the Assembly Vote.

228
00:18:04,926 --> 00:18:05,926
Also,

229
00:18:06,797 --> 00:18:08,896
the votes cast during the live broadcast...

230
00:18:10,267 --> 00:18:12,596
will be counted twice.

231
00:18:15,366 --> 00:18:19,136
The real-time voting will
close after an hour from now.

232
00:18:19,477 --> 00:18:21,307
Please remember that.

233
00:18:25,346 --> 00:18:27,047
For the last week,

234
00:18:28,017 --> 00:18:29,685
the fourth global voting was conducted.

235
00:18:29,686 --> 00:18:33,286
From about 180 countries,

236
00:18:33,287 --> 00:18:36,926
World Assemblers
participated in the voting.

237
00:18:38,626 --> 00:18:40,396
For the trainees in PROJECT 7,

238
00:18:41,527 --> 00:18:46,436
World Assemblers are sending
continuous support and attention.

239
00:18:46,866 --> 00:18:49,336
I give my sincere gratitude for that.

240
00:18:54,077 --> 00:18:55,346
World Assemblers,

241
00:18:56,946 --> 00:18:59,416
which trainee's debut are you supporting?

242
00:19:04,787 --> 00:19:05,915
(KIM SIHUN, let's make your debut!)

243
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:06,957
And,

244
00:19:07,086 --> 00:19:09,026
(SEO KYOUNGBAE, please make your debut!)

245
00:19:09,027 --> 00:19:11,797
would that trainee be able to realize...

246
00:19:12,727 --> 00:19:14,797
his dream of making a debut tonight?

247
00:19:15,096 --> 00:19:17,797
- Yes! - Yes!

248
00:19:19,067 --> 00:19:22,906
Since the fate of 21
people is in your hands,

249
00:19:23,577 --> 00:19:26,336
until the moment the debut team is created,

250
00:19:27,007 --> 00:19:29,606
please stay with us to the end.

251
00:19:35,346 --> 00:19:39,386
To witness the moment the debut
team is created from the closest,

252
00:19:39,517 --> 00:19:41,327
here in Namdong Gymnasium,

253
00:19:41,787 --> 00:19:46,126
five thousand World Assemblers joined us.

254
00:19:48,426 --> 00:19:51,767
Thank you for coming
here in the cold weather.

255
00:19:51,967 --> 00:19:54,766
Please send your support to the end.

256
00:19:54,767 --> 00:19:57,048
(Incheon Namdong Gymnasium,
final special live broadcast)

257
00:19:57,277 --> 00:20:00,777
(LYNNLYNN)

258
00:20:02,077 --> 00:20:03,146
Now,

259
00:20:04,517 --> 00:20:06,217
here's the last project...

260
00:20:07,317 --> 00:20:10,957
trainees need to go
through for their debut.

261
00:20:12,386 --> 00:20:15,586
I will now announce the
name of the last project.

262
00:20:17,196 --> 00:20:18,327
The last project...

263
00:20:22,727 --> 00:20:24,366
is the Final Match.

264
00:20:25,636 --> 00:20:30,136
(Last project, Final Match)

265
00:20:39,946 --> 00:20:42,945
Final Match is the final project
to be an important standard...

266
00:20:42,946 --> 00:20:46,886
for selecting the final
members of the debut team.

267
00:20:47,926 --> 00:20:49,457
World Assemblers,

268
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:53,026
according to your assembly,

269
00:20:53,027 --> 00:20:54,767
each seven trainees built a team...

270
00:20:55,067 --> 00:20:59,366
and three performances
in total were prepared.

271
00:21:04,237 --> 00:21:05,852
As they are on the
threshold of their debut,

272
00:21:05,876 --> 00:21:09,406
they prepared the
performances intenser than ever.

273
00:21:09,807 --> 00:21:11,946
Please look forward to seeing it.

274
00:21:13,217 --> 00:21:15,746
(You're the only one I
can see, JUNG SEYUN.)

275
00:21:15,747 --> 00:21:16,957
(AHN JUNWON, I love you.)

276
00:21:18,717 --> 00:21:19,817
This is the last time.

277
00:21:21,686 --> 00:21:25,126
We only have the final
project performances left.

278
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:29,566
I feel very nervous as
much as trainees are tense.

279
00:21:29,567 --> 00:21:33,037
And I see many people
excited and nervous...

280
00:21:33,196 --> 00:21:36,807
for the trainees they support.

281
00:21:37,936 --> 00:21:40,646
Until the trainees could come
up to the live broadcast stage,

282
00:21:42,007 --> 00:21:43,207
these people guided them.

283
00:21:43,817 --> 00:21:45,415
Without their help, the trainees...

284
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:49,047
wouldn't have been able to
prepare for perfect performances.

285
00:21:50,787 --> 00:21:51,856
They are...

286
00:21:52,656 --> 00:21:56,126
the directors of PROJECT 7.

287
00:21:58,856 --> 00:22:01,826
(Ryan Sewon Jhun, Ha Sung Woon, )

288
00:22:01,827 --> 00:22:04,797
(Lee Hae In, Bada, RyuD)

289
00:22:11,507 --> 00:22:14,676
I've been to the Project Village
once to cheer trainees up,

290
00:22:14,807 --> 00:22:17,116
and I saw them giving lessons so hard,

291
00:22:17,676 --> 00:22:19,817
day and night with the trainees...

292
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:23,716
to show great performances.

293
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,686
That made me feel a lot of emotions.

294
00:22:27,126 --> 00:22:29,085
Now I'll ask some questions to them.

295
00:22:29,086 --> 00:22:30,126
Director Bada.

296
00:22:31,896 --> 00:22:34,767
Hello, I'm Director Bada.

297
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:39,695
I heard PROJECT 7...

298
00:22:39,696 --> 00:22:42,136
was in charge of increasing
your dopamine level.

299
00:22:42,267 --> 00:22:43,577
Please say a word.

300
00:22:43,807 --> 00:22:44,875
Yes.

301
00:22:44,876 --> 00:22:48,445
I think not only I, but also
many World Assemblers...

302
00:22:48,446 --> 00:22:51,916
had their dopamine and
endorphin increased watching it.

303
00:22:52,116 --> 00:22:53,845
In fact, I felt happy...

304
00:22:53,846 --> 00:22:56,326
not only on Friday but also at
every moment with the trainees.

305
00:22:56,416 --> 00:23:00,556
And I hope today, the 21
trainees on the great stage...

306
00:23:00,557 --> 00:23:04,096
do not get nervous and show
everything they want to show.

307
00:23:04,196 --> 00:23:05,227
You can do it!

308
00:23:11,396 --> 00:23:13,666
Now, based on his own experience,

309
00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:17,136
he always gave sincere advice.

310
00:23:17,636 --> 00:23:19,037
Here's Director Ha Sung Woon.

311
00:23:23,207 --> 00:23:24,416
Hello, I'm Ha Sung Woon.

312
00:23:24,876 --> 00:23:27,685
Since you've been through
the same moment like this,

313
00:23:27,686 --> 00:23:30,855
you'd understand how the
trainees feel more than anyone.

314
00:23:30,856 --> 00:23:32,116
- Yes. - Please say...

315
00:23:32,356 --> 00:23:34,086
a word to cheer the trainees up.

316
00:23:35,386 --> 00:23:38,327
First of all, you've worked so hard...

317
00:23:39,227 --> 00:23:40,727
until you get to the Final Match.

318
00:23:42,027 --> 00:23:46,665
Now, I actually think that
you can make a debut.

319
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:50,936
So, I hope you don't get nervous
and finish the performance well.

320
00:23:51,136 --> 00:23:52,237
This is the beginning.

321
00:23:52,507 --> 00:23:56,706
Today, I hope you run towards your dream.

322
00:23:56,707 --> 00:23:57,747
You can do it!

323
00:23:58,977 --> 00:24:01,487
(Ha Sung Woon)

324
00:24:03,346 --> 00:24:05,257
Sometimes as a strict instructor,

325
00:24:06,686 --> 00:24:08,327
and sometimes as a warm senior singer,

326
00:24:09,086 --> 00:24:10,925
the directors guided them well,

327
00:24:10,926 --> 00:24:12,596
so they could put on great performances.

328
00:24:12,626 --> 00:24:15,067
And this was the trainees'
last class from them.

329
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:18,666
We have the video of their class.

330
00:24:23,366 --> 00:24:25,707
The last class of PROJECT 7.

331
00:24:27,906 --> 00:24:28,906
We will watch it...

332
00:24:30,176 --> 00:24:31,176
now.

333
00:24:37,186 --> 00:24:38,717
- Let's just begin. - Okay.

334
00:24:39,416 --> 00:24:41,026
- All right. - Someone will light them up.

335
00:24:41,027 --> 00:24:42,585
- When he places it down
like this, - One at a time.

336
00:24:42,586 --> 00:24:44,203
- Bring it? - Someone has to make a path.

337
00:24:44,227 --> 00:24:45,556
- Here. - I'll light and place them.

338
00:24:45,557 --> 00:24:46,625
(Everyone seems busy with
something for some reason.)

339
00:24:46,626 --> 00:24:47,997
How do I cut this?

340
00:24:48,666 --> 00:24:50,327
Hey, can I do this instead?

341
00:24:50,366 --> 00:24:52,466
- "A lot." - "A lot."

342
00:24:52,467 --> 00:24:53,936
That's good. Let's go with that.

343
00:24:54,037 --> 00:24:56,557
- Gosh, it could've pricked me.
- You're working so hard on it.

344
00:24:58,577 --> 00:25:00,945
Gosh, I love throwing
surprise events like this.

345
00:25:00,946 --> 00:25:02,866
(What is this event the
trainees have prepared?)

346
00:25:03,507 --> 00:25:04,946
My gosh, I'm going in.

347
00:25:05,346 --> 00:25:06,416
Are you okay?

348
00:25:07,946 --> 00:25:10,217
(The kindness of teachers)

349
00:25:13,886 --> 00:25:15,425
- Gosh, I'm not going in. - What? Go in.

350
00:25:15,426 --> 00:25:17,196
- No. You go in first.
- Come on, go inside.

351
00:25:17,457 --> 00:25:18,956
- I'm not going in. It's too much.
- Come in.

352
00:25:18,957 --> 00:25:20,256
My gosh, what's all this?

353
00:25:20,257 --> 00:25:21,496
- What is this? - Oh, my.

354
00:25:21,497 --> 00:25:23,395
(Feeling awkward)

355
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:24,467
No way.

356
00:25:25,436 --> 00:25:26,467
My gosh.

357
00:25:26,497 --> 00:25:29,336
- What is this? - I can't do this.

358
00:25:29,666 --> 00:25:30,905
- Oh, my. - We have to go like this.

359
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:32,436
- Goodness. - I can't believe this.

360
00:25:33,906 --> 00:25:36,946
(They barely make it to the heart zone.)

361
00:25:37,676 --> 00:25:38,747
Did you guys do this?

362
00:25:38,977 --> 00:25:41,787
- No one's ever done this for me.
- Gosh, look at that.

363
00:25:41,817 --> 00:25:43,787
Goodness, this is so sweet.

364
00:25:45,116 --> 00:25:46,956
(An hour ago)

365
00:25:46,957 --> 00:25:48,763
- Hey, that's way too dense.
- Aren't they too spread apart?

366
00:25:48,787 --> 00:25:49,855
- Really? - No.

367
00:25:49,856 --> 00:25:51,273
The candles on that
side are too spread out.

368
00:25:51,297 --> 00:25:52,655
We might run out of them.

369
00:25:52,656 --> 00:25:54,227
- So I widened the gaps. - Right.

370
00:25:54,426 --> 00:25:56,466
- Let's go with this for now.
- Yes, let's do this.

371
00:25:56,467 --> 00:25:58,567
- We'll widen them later.
- Let's move them later.

372
00:26:00,666 --> 00:26:02,605
Okay. Let's stop there. We
have to spread them out again.

373
00:26:02,606 --> 00:26:03,807
- Like this again? - Yes.

374
00:26:04,207 --> 00:26:06,375
Or we could close this part in like this.

375
00:26:06,376 --> 00:26:07,645
(It's not easy to make a
candlelit path for the surprise.)

376
00:26:07,646 --> 00:26:08,976
- Let's spread them out a bit more.
- Hold on.

377
00:26:08,977 --> 00:26:10,523
- The path should be longer. - Come here.

378
00:26:10,547 --> 00:26:12,175
Okay. I realized something with this today.

379
00:26:12,176 --> 00:26:14,416
I won't ever use candles
when I propose to a girl.

380
00:26:15,247 --> 00:26:16,987
- Here? - Yes, there.

381
00:26:17,957 --> 00:26:19,056
- Here? - Yes.

382
00:26:19,057 --> 00:26:20,257
(Let's decorate the wall now.)

383
00:26:20,957 --> 00:26:21,957
Is it not sticking well?

384
00:26:21,958 --> 00:26:23,318
(The height only makes him laugh.)

385
00:26:23,626 --> 00:26:25,027
- JIWOON. - Jump.

386
00:26:25,297 --> 00:26:26,957
Or you hold onto it here.

387
00:26:27,196 --> 00:26:28,196
There.

388
00:26:28,467 --> 00:26:29,997
(Barely touching the paper)

389
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:33,267
- Anyone over 180cm? - Yes!

390
00:26:33,497 --> 00:26:35,537
- Anyone over 180cm? - Yes!

391
00:26:35,767 --> 00:26:37,335
- Yes. - Can you come and help?

392
00:26:37,336 --> 00:26:38,477
- Sure. - Yes.

393
00:26:38,606 --> 00:26:40,175
- Can you come and help?
- Anyone over 180cm?

394
00:26:40,176 --> 00:26:41,247
Do you need help?

395
00:26:41,707 --> 00:26:43,547
YOUNGSEO, you said
your height was over 180cm.

396
00:26:43,846 --> 00:26:45,017
I'm slightly under 180cm.

397
00:26:45,446 --> 00:26:47,046
- Can you press on the tapes?
- Can you get the tapes?

398
00:26:47,047 --> 00:26:49,086
- Great. - My gosh. You're so tall.

399
00:26:49,217 --> 00:26:50,616
Nice.

400
00:26:51,616 --> 00:26:53,787
What is a good message?

401
00:26:54,626 --> 00:26:55,686
Something simple.

402
00:26:55,886 --> 00:26:57,057
What a great sight.

403
00:26:57,856 --> 00:26:58,956
- Did you finish? - It does look like...

404
00:26:58,957 --> 00:27:00,096
we're doing our best.

405
00:27:01,497 --> 00:27:03,296
- Whom is this present for?
- Ryan Sewon Jhun.

406
00:27:03,297 --> 00:27:04,466
- Ryan Sewon Jhun? - Yes.

407
00:27:04,467 --> 00:27:05,935
What should we do with this?

408
00:27:05,936 --> 00:27:07,896
- What do you think we should do?
- It's so cute.

409
00:27:08,567 --> 00:27:11,037
This is for Director Hae In.

410
00:27:11,136 --> 00:27:12,776
- I should write that.
- It resembles her, right?

411
00:27:12,777 --> 00:27:14,376
Director Bada...

412
00:27:14,747 --> 00:27:16,406
Director Bada...

413
00:27:16,646 --> 00:27:17,816
I know her well.

414
00:27:17,817 --> 00:27:19,345
She likes the right side of her face.

415
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,416
So...

416
00:27:21,017 --> 00:27:22,786
I have to cover up her left side...

417
00:27:22,787 --> 00:27:24,586
to show her right side with the bandanna.

418
00:27:24,957 --> 00:27:26,556
I think that will make her happy.

419
00:27:26,557 --> 00:27:27,987
(I did a good job, didn't I?)

420
00:27:28,426 --> 00:27:29,456
(This guy is customizing the doll too.)

421
00:27:29,457 --> 00:27:30,457
This is fun.

422
00:27:31,126 --> 00:27:32,756
KYOUNGBAE. Are you good at sewing?

423
00:27:32,757 --> 00:27:33,797
No.

424
00:27:34,797 --> 00:27:36,266
(He's sewing for the
first time in his life.)

425
00:27:36,267 --> 00:27:38,165
Okay. I did it right.

426
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:39,395
(His sewing skills are
improving little by little.)

427
00:27:39,396 --> 00:27:40,736
Nice.

428
00:27:40,737 --> 00:27:42,335
- Grab it like this.
- You can grab it like that.

429
00:27:42,336 --> 00:27:43,405
(They work on the teddy bears
from the bottom of their heart.)

430
00:27:43,406 --> 00:27:44,436
- Hey. - Isn't this cute?

431
00:27:44,737 --> 00:27:47,077
What if they're so touched by our presents?

432
00:27:47,446 --> 00:27:49,145
(Director Bada)

433
00:27:49,146 --> 00:27:52,816
(They also signed the paper
with messages for directors.)

434
00:27:52,817 --> 00:27:54,616
(Director Hae In)

435
00:27:54,787 --> 00:27:56,685
Baby fairies, let's start.

436
00:27:56,686 --> 00:27:57,916
- Start. - What? There's more.

437
00:27:58,057 --> 00:28:00,186
- Let's go, cuties. - What's this?

438
00:28:00,416 --> 00:28:01,757
- My gosh. - The babies.

439
00:28:07,327 --> 00:28:09,595
(Dear Directors)

440
00:28:09,596 --> 00:28:10,796
(They express their
gratitude all of a sudden.)

441
00:28:10,797 --> 00:28:12,165
(Hello)

442
00:28:12,166 --> 00:28:13,237
"Hello."

443
00:28:13,767 --> 00:28:15,936
(Actually...)

444
00:28:16,866 --> 00:28:19,436
(We...)

445
00:28:19,636 --> 00:28:22,506
Let's make your singing sound sweeter.

446
00:28:22,507 --> 00:28:23,507
(Singing more sweetly)

447
00:28:23,747 --> 00:28:24,747
(Singing more sweetly)

448
00:28:27,446 --> 00:28:29,916
(You guys helped us a lot.)

449
00:28:30,017 --> 00:28:31,355
(Feeling proud)

450
00:28:31,356 --> 00:28:34,126
(So we're grateful.)

451
00:28:34,227 --> 00:28:35,957
(We love you.)

452
00:28:36,126 --> 00:28:37,186
Me too.

453
00:28:37,497 --> 00:28:38,926
(We love you.)

454
00:28:39,057 --> 00:28:40,596
- Yes. - This is amazing.

455
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:42,425
We love you.

456
00:28:42,426 --> 00:28:44,267
- Thank you. - Thank you.

457
00:28:44,497 --> 00:28:45,635
- Thank you. - Thank you.

458
00:28:45,636 --> 00:28:46,766
- Thank you. - Seriously.

459
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:48,743
- Thank you. I mean it.
- This could've been grander.

460
00:28:48,767 --> 00:28:50,606
- It's not over yet. - What?

461
00:28:51,376 --> 00:28:53,406
- What? - This one is for you, Director Ha.

462
00:28:53,577 --> 00:28:54,806
- What's this? - No way.

463
00:28:54,807 --> 00:28:56,407
- A doll. - And we all signed the paper.

464
00:28:56,446 --> 00:28:58,517
- Really? This is amazing. - No way.

465
00:28:58,616 --> 00:29:00,716
Director Hae In. I made this for you.

466
00:29:00,717 --> 00:29:03,146
- Really? Thank you. - When you press this,

467
00:29:03,487 --> 00:29:05,686
- you'll hear our recorded message. - Okay.

468
00:29:06,186 --> 00:29:09,287
- Director Hae In is awesome!
- Director Hae In is awesome!

469
00:29:09,487 --> 00:29:11,195
- Director Ryan. Let's meet again.
- Director Ryan. Let's meet again.

470
00:29:11,196 --> 00:29:12,895
- Director Ryan. Let's meet again.
- Director Ryan. Let's meet again.

471
00:29:12,896 --> 00:29:14,026
Wait.

472
00:29:14,027 --> 00:29:15,497
- Director RyuD. - Director RyuD.

473
00:29:15,596 --> 00:29:17,296
(Each teddy bear has its unique message.)

474
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:18,366
Great!

475
00:29:18,537 --> 00:29:20,466
- Really? - We personally...

476
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:23,106
- recorded messages in the dolls.
- Please accept our heart!

477
00:29:24,077 --> 00:29:26,307
"Please accept our heart!"

478
00:29:26,737 --> 00:29:27,807
So cute.

479
00:29:28,007 --> 00:29:30,306
- We need luck. - We need luck.

480
00:29:30,307 --> 00:29:32,047
- Thank you. - Luck named you!

481
00:29:32,176 --> 00:29:33,736
What? You spoke without the honorifics.

482
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:38,356
Seriously.

483
00:29:38,616 --> 00:29:40,156
Did you also decorate the paper?

484
00:29:40,457 --> 00:29:41,557
- Yes. - Yes.

485
00:29:41,787 --> 00:29:43,385
Did you also print it out?

486
00:29:43,386 --> 00:29:44,426
- Yes. - Yes.

487
00:29:44,457 --> 00:29:45,855
- This is cute. - This is incredible.

488
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,796
- My gosh. Thank you.
- I'll hang it on the wall.

489
00:29:47,797 --> 00:29:48,966
- Thank you. - Thank you.

490
00:29:48,967 --> 00:29:50,296
- I'll frame it and keep it. - Thank you.

491
00:29:50,297 --> 00:29:52,067
- Totally. - Thank you.

492
00:29:52,436 --> 00:29:54,866
They had fun with the event we prepared.

493
00:29:55,166 --> 00:29:57,576
Seeing them being happy with
our presents brought joy to me too.

494
00:29:57,577 --> 00:30:00,747
Our effort to prepare this
was completely worth it.

495
00:30:01,247 --> 00:30:03,277
- Thank you. - Teaching you paid off.

496
00:30:03,807 --> 00:30:05,615
- Thank you. Let's clean it up. - Nice.

497
00:30:05,616 --> 00:30:07,987
- Hurry up.
- You guys should clean this up.

498
00:30:08,487 --> 00:30:09,547
Actually,

499
00:30:10,317 --> 00:30:13,085
we also prepared something for you guys.

500
00:30:13,086 --> 00:30:14,956
- What? - We'll reveal it here?

501
00:30:14,957 --> 00:30:16,626
- I'm going to cry. - No way.

502
00:30:16,787 --> 00:30:18,027
- Really? - My gosh.

503
00:30:19,096 --> 00:30:21,696
(They wrote letters for all 21 trainees.)

504
00:30:23,797 --> 00:30:28,135
(They wrote down each word
from the bottom of their heart.)

505
00:30:28,136 --> 00:30:29,136
(BINGHUA, NAM JIWOON, WOO HAJOON)

506
00:30:29,136 --> 00:30:30,136
(You've been my number
one pick. I bet you didn't know.)

507
00:30:30,136 --> 00:30:31,136
(I've become a fan of yours
through this show, HYUNWOO.)

508
00:30:31,136 --> 00:30:32,136
(I'll always root for you.
(I know you'll do well.)

509
00:30:32,137 --> 00:30:33,253
(You always work hard to reach your goal.)

510
00:30:33,277 --> 00:30:36,106
We only had to write a
message to five directors.

511
00:30:36,247 --> 00:30:38,317
But they wrote a message for 21 people.

512
00:30:38,517 --> 00:30:39,817
- MINWOOK. - Really?

513
00:30:40,247 --> 00:30:41,386
- Thank you. - HAJOON.

514
00:30:41,416 --> 00:30:42,486
My goodness.

515
00:30:42,487 --> 00:30:43,987
- Inside... - This is amazing.

516
00:30:44,186 --> 00:30:45,186
- Oh, my. - Gosh.

517
00:30:45,187 --> 00:30:46,685
- HYUNWOO. - Thank you.

518
00:30:46,686 --> 00:30:47,956
- LYNNLYNN. - YEOJUN.

519
00:30:47,957 --> 00:30:49,656
- Yes. Thank you. - Where's LYNNLYNN?

520
00:30:50,027 --> 00:30:51,095
- Oh, my. - LYNNLYNN.

521
00:30:51,096 --> 00:30:53,527
- Could we read it now? - LYNNLYNN.

522
00:30:54,467 --> 00:30:55,567
- This is... - My gosh.

523
00:30:55,727 --> 00:30:57,435
- Thank you. - Thank you.

524
00:30:57,436 --> 00:30:58,596
- Thank you. - My gosh.

525
00:30:58,696 --> 00:31:01,016
- No way. There's a picture of me.
- This is unbelievable.

526
00:31:02,366 --> 00:31:04,507
(Marines don't cry.)

527
00:31:04,977 --> 00:31:06,376
You can't cry, come on.

528
00:31:07,606 --> 00:31:08,646
Oh, my!

529
00:31:09,406 --> 00:31:10,446
My goodness.

530
00:31:13,277 --> 00:31:17,346
"I can feel sincerity
in everything you do."

531
00:31:17,487 --> 00:31:20,586
"It made me think that you were
an amazing kid for your age."

532
00:31:20,957 --> 00:31:22,226
"In due time,"

533
00:31:22,227 --> 00:31:26,156
"everyone will see the time,
effort, and heart you put into this."

534
00:31:26,626 --> 00:31:28,902
During my journey on PROJECT
7, there hasn't been a moment...

535
00:31:28,926 --> 00:31:30,967
I wasn't giving my all.

536
00:31:31,297 --> 00:31:33,237
I always gave my best to this.

537
00:31:33,596 --> 00:31:36,007
She wrote that she could see it.

538
00:31:36,767 --> 00:31:38,606
It felt like I earned her recognition.

539
00:31:39,277 --> 00:31:40,335
"Hello, KYOUNGBAE."

540
00:31:40,336 --> 00:31:42,675
"I was truly shocked when
you came to our booth."

541
00:31:42,676 --> 00:31:44,317
"You reminded me of my young self."

542
00:31:47,987 --> 00:31:49,747
She said I reminded
her of her younger self.

543
00:31:51,717 --> 00:31:53,416
I'm feeling confident now.

544
00:31:54,426 --> 00:31:55,556
Do you like yours?

545
00:31:55,557 --> 00:31:57,497
"Dear SEYUN." And there's a heart too.

546
00:31:58,426 --> 00:31:59,896
(Giggling)

547
00:32:00,557 --> 00:32:02,067
"I bet it's been tough."

548
00:32:02,196 --> 00:32:05,037
"But I trust that you're
learning a lot here."

549
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:08,207
"I truly hope you can shine for your team."

550
00:32:11,577 --> 00:32:13,612
"Dear SEUNGHO who is
handsome and good at everything."

551
00:32:13,636 --> 00:32:15,796
"Well done. I want to applaud
you for your hard work."

552
00:32:16,477 --> 00:32:17,976
"I'll root for your dream."

553
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:19,317
"Keep running like this."

554
00:32:19,477 --> 00:32:21,787
"Let's meet on stage someday. Good luck."

555
00:32:22,186 --> 00:32:23,746
(Sniffling)

556
00:32:23,747 --> 00:32:26,286
I keep hearing sniffling sounds.

557
00:32:26,287 --> 00:32:28,586
(Where?)

558
00:32:31,356 --> 00:32:32,855
"You have more days..."

559
00:32:32,856 --> 00:32:34,496
I think SUNGMIN is crying way too much.

560
00:32:34,497 --> 00:32:35,896
"Show us..."

561
00:32:39,436 --> 00:32:41,537
"SUNGMIN, you were in my class."

562
00:32:41,666 --> 00:32:43,365
"It must've been tough to be in my class."

563
00:32:43,366 --> 00:32:44,577
Try it.

564
00:32:44,876 --> 00:32:46,335
Yes. That's it. Did you see that?

565
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,706
"Thank you for always being so positive..."

566
00:32:48,707 --> 00:32:50,467
"and trying your best
instead of giving up."

567
00:32:50,777 --> 00:32:53,375
"All of your hard efforts will
come back and help you later."

568
00:32:53,376 --> 00:32:54,616
"I'll always wish you luck."

569
00:32:55,186 --> 00:32:58,057
Getting the letter in person...

570
00:32:58,217 --> 00:33:00,186
made me more emotional.

571
00:33:10,327 --> 00:33:12,497
You're crying way too much. Come on.

572
00:33:14,037 --> 00:33:16,136
Why are you crying so much?

573
00:33:20,237 --> 00:33:21,675
YOUNGSEO is crying too? My gosh.

574
00:33:21,676 --> 00:33:24,176
It looks like the guys
in black are all crying.

575
00:33:24,277 --> 00:33:27,176
(This guy in black is also crying.)

576
00:33:28,086 --> 00:33:29,886
(Feeling proud)

577
00:33:29,987 --> 00:33:31,787
I'm really grateful.

578
00:33:32,057 --> 00:33:33,386
Right, me too.

579
00:33:34,586 --> 00:33:37,527
Some of you will make a debut.

580
00:33:37,656 --> 00:33:39,557
But some of you will not.

581
00:33:39,856 --> 00:33:40,967
That could be...

582
00:33:41,666 --> 00:33:44,026
because it's not your time yet.

583
00:33:44,027 --> 00:33:46,396
If you keep working hard like this,

584
00:33:46,537 --> 00:33:48,906
maybe, we'll be able to see each other...

585
00:33:49,037 --> 00:33:50,707
at the top one day.

586
00:33:51,176 --> 00:33:52,616
I've experienced that firsthand too.

587
00:33:53,176 --> 00:33:54,306
I hope you'll keep trying.

588
00:33:54,307 --> 00:33:57,446
Then we might be able to
see each other at the top.

589
00:33:59,716 --> 00:34:01,156
Why do I feel like I'm going to cry?

590
00:34:01,486 --> 00:34:03,147
- Hold on. - Don't cry.

591
00:34:03,486 --> 00:34:05,286
I'm a feeling type. Okay.

592
00:34:05,287 --> 00:34:07,086
(Feeling her emotions too)

593
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:08,156
First of all,

594
00:34:08,557 --> 00:34:12,596
as the director of this show, PROJECT 7,

595
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:15,666
I had always given my best to you.

596
00:34:15,667 --> 00:34:18,565
Personally, I wanted
to teach you guys a lot.

597
00:34:18,566 --> 00:34:21,405
It was an honor that I could
be part of your journey...

598
00:34:21,406 --> 00:34:23,506
to make a debut as a team.

599
00:34:23,667 --> 00:34:25,587
And... Why do I feel like
I'm going to choke up?

600
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,477
Cry!

601
00:34:30,546 --> 00:34:31,815
It was an honor.

602
00:34:31,816 --> 00:34:32,816
(Are you crying?)

603
00:34:32,817 --> 00:34:34,657
I'll help you all the
way to the last mission.

604
00:34:34,886 --> 00:34:39,017
I know too well how you guys feel. So...

605
00:34:44,187 --> 00:34:45,596
Don't cry.

606
00:34:48,997 --> 00:34:50,026
My gosh.

607
00:34:55,906 --> 00:34:57,307
I wasn't going to cry.

608
00:34:57,636 --> 00:35:01,276
(Don't cry.)

609
00:35:02,247 --> 00:35:03,307
Anyway,

610
00:35:04,006 --> 00:35:06,076
I'll keep rooting for you guys to the end.

611
00:35:06,077 --> 00:35:07,576
I would be thankful...

612
00:35:07,577 --> 00:35:10,716
if you guys don't lose
the passion you have now.

613
00:35:11,316 --> 00:35:12,756
- Okay. - Good luck.

614
00:35:12,886 --> 00:35:14,216
- Thank you. - Thank you.

615
00:35:18,596 --> 00:35:20,096
It felt like a goodbye.

616
00:35:20,397 --> 00:35:22,565
It didn't feel like it
had been a long time.

617
00:35:22,566 --> 00:35:24,296
But the show is already nearing its end.

618
00:35:24,966 --> 00:35:28,707
I haven't shown the best
version of myself so far.

619
00:35:28,736 --> 00:35:33,107
I'm grateful that they
didn't give up on me.

620
00:35:33,377 --> 00:35:35,647
It really felt like the last mission.

621
00:35:35,776 --> 00:35:39,517
I realized that I could give my all
because I met such good directors.

622
00:35:39,917 --> 00:35:40,945
Attention, everyone.

623
00:35:40,946 --> 00:35:43,106
(Showing their respect to
the directors one last time)

624
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:45,816
Bow to the directors.

625
00:35:46,116 --> 00:35:48,263
- Thank you for everything.
- Thank you for everything.

626
00:35:48,287 --> 00:35:49,727
- We love you. - We love you.

627
00:35:50,127 --> 00:35:51,357
- We love you. - Thank you.

628
00:35:51,796 --> 00:35:52,926
Thank you.

629
00:35:56,327 --> 00:35:58,767
(As they hope to meet again...)

630
00:35:59,096 --> 00:36:01,937
- Directors, let's meet again.
- Directors, let's meet again.

631
00:36:02,167 --> 00:36:03,167
Wait for us.

632
00:36:03,168 --> 00:36:06,077
(Run with us, Directors.)

633
00:36:18,057 --> 00:36:20,215
During the trainees' journey on PROJECT 7,

634
00:36:20,216 --> 00:36:23,357
the directors cherished
them wholeheartedly.

635
00:36:25,857 --> 00:36:27,057
Director Ryan Sewon Jhun.

636
00:36:28,526 --> 00:36:29,526
Yes.

637
00:36:29,796 --> 00:36:32,566
It sometimes seemed you
didn't care about the cameras.

638
00:36:33,196 --> 00:36:35,806
You truly cared for them
from the bottom of your heart.

639
00:36:35,807 --> 00:36:36,936
- Yes. - After this,

640
00:36:36,937 --> 00:36:38,837
you won't be able to
see them as often as now.

641
00:36:39,077 --> 00:36:40,752
Would you like to say
something to the trainees?

642
00:36:40,776 --> 00:36:45,077
So today is the final episode of the show.

643
00:36:45,846 --> 00:36:48,946
I couldn't sleep well last
night. I was sad that it was over.

644
00:36:49,716 --> 00:36:52,857
I am not a father yet.

645
00:36:53,517 --> 00:36:57,287
But I treated and thought
of them as my own sons.

646
00:36:58,296 --> 00:37:00,096
Actually, I had trouble
sleeping last night.

647
00:37:01,596 --> 00:37:03,426
So that's where I am now. But I don't know.

648
00:37:04,026 --> 00:37:06,837
I still consider myself a student of music.

649
00:37:07,366 --> 00:37:10,436
I'm studying idol groups
and K-pop every day.

650
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:11,957
The thing is, I don't settle for less.

651
00:37:12,807 --> 00:37:16,707
Well, some of the trainees
were eliminated, unfortunately.

652
00:37:17,647 --> 00:37:22,086
I thought a lot about what kind
of helpful message I could give...

653
00:37:22,087 --> 00:37:25,417
to you and the trainees
who will debut soon.

654
00:37:26,256 --> 00:37:28,457
So I'd like to say this.
Don't settle for less.

655
00:37:28,926 --> 00:37:31,426
Keep looking ahead and look up to the sky.

656
00:37:31,796 --> 00:37:35,096
I hope you will become brave
kids who can keep charging forward.

657
00:37:36,296 --> 00:37:38,596
And love yourselves.

658
00:37:38,866 --> 00:37:41,307
Whatever happens today,

659
00:37:42,136 --> 00:37:43,766
tomorrow might give you
something entirely different.

660
00:37:43,767 --> 00:37:47,377
So I don't want you to
settle for less. That's my wish.

661
00:37:47,877 --> 00:37:52,247
Here's my conclusion. Feel
the new vibe and the time.

662
00:37:52,377 --> 00:37:54,446
As you feel the vibe, keep
challenging yourselves.

663
00:37:54,787 --> 00:37:57,816
So you could become people
who can open up the next chapter.

664
00:37:58,917 --> 00:38:00,486
Lastly,

665
00:38:01,227 --> 00:38:04,357
thanks to the fans who
came here to see the trainees,

666
00:38:04,497 --> 00:38:06,595
these trainees can perform.

667
00:38:06,596 --> 00:38:08,525
So I just want to thank everyone.

668
00:38:08,526 --> 00:38:11,896
Please love and support them,

669
00:38:11,897 --> 00:38:15,235
so they could be a great team
together. And cheer for them too.

670
00:38:15,236 --> 00:38:16,267
Thank you.

671
00:38:20,577 --> 00:38:23,446
Thank you for your sincere advice.

672
00:38:23,807 --> 00:38:25,377
Director RyuD.

673
00:38:25,676 --> 00:38:26,747
Yes.

674
00:38:27,276 --> 00:38:30,486
You taught them the fundamentals
of dance in an organized way.

675
00:38:30,816 --> 00:38:34,087
Your affection for the
trainees must run deep.

676
00:38:34,656 --> 00:38:38,096
Could you give them a
message as they wait to perform?

677
00:38:39,426 --> 00:38:42,627
First of all, I mostly deal
with intense choreographies.

678
00:38:43,066 --> 00:38:45,865
So the trainees who learned
from me must have had a hard time.

679
00:38:45,866 --> 00:38:49,307
There were times I made them
practice 1 move over 50 times.

680
00:38:49,667 --> 00:38:52,877
Because I wasn't a
talented dancer at first,

681
00:38:53,176 --> 00:38:55,275
I wanted them to perform well...

682
00:38:55,276 --> 00:38:57,276
even if they weren't the best dancers.

683
00:38:57,676 --> 00:39:01,587
I really hope that my lessons come
in handy when they make a debut.

684
00:39:01,816 --> 00:39:04,216
I also want to wish them
luck for tonight's performance.

685
00:39:04,787 --> 00:39:09,256
I hope everyone walks away from
this with good, happy memories.

686
00:39:12,997 --> 00:39:14,026
Thank you.

687
00:39:14,526 --> 00:39:18,366
She cried quite a lot
during the last class.

688
00:39:18,566 --> 00:39:20,196
Director Lee Hae In.

689
00:39:21,196 --> 00:39:23,036
Could you also give a
message to the trainees?

690
00:39:25,337 --> 00:39:27,736
I couldn't stop crying.

691
00:39:27,906 --> 00:39:30,977
I became emotional just
by watching the video.

692
00:39:31,917 --> 00:39:34,686
Firstly, due to the nature of the show,

693
00:39:34,687 --> 00:39:38,087
we must often give them harsh feedback.

694
00:39:38,187 --> 00:39:41,186
But they only got one
or half a day to practice...

695
00:39:41,187 --> 00:39:42,885
before we evaluated them.

696
00:39:42,886 --> 00:39:45,996
I would like to tell them that
what we see on this show...

697
00:39:45,997 --> 00:39:49,667
doesn't reflect all the
potential they have.

698
00:39:49,796 --> 00:39:51,595
And no one knows...

699
00:39:51,596 --> 00:39:54,965
about their potential
better than themselves.

700
00:39:54,966 --> 00:39:55,966
I want to tell them to trust...

701
00:39:55,966 --> 00:39:56,966
the time and effort they put into this.

702
00:39:56,967 --> 00:39:59,707
I hope they do their best
today as they have always done.

703
00:39:59,877 --> 00:40:02,006
I'll root for them too. Good luck.

00:40:09,687 --> 00:40:11,287
Before we begin the Final Match,

707
00:40:12,256 --> 00:40:14,626
I will make an announcement...

708
00:40:14,627 --> 00:40:16,627
everyone must be itching to find out.

709
00:40:18,327 --> 00:40:19,327
Tonight,

710
00:40:20,227 --> 00:40:21,827
a global top-class idol group...

711
00:40:23,426 --> 00:40:25,596
will be formed.

712
00:40:27,537 --> 00:40:28,537
The name of the group.

713
00:40:28,966 --> 00:40:35,006
(The name of the debut
group will be revealed.)

714
00:40:42,386 --> 00:40:45,087
I'm sure everyone here is curious...

715
00:40:45,486 --> 00:40:47,655
about the name of the group...

716
00:40:47,656 --> 00:40:50,557
that the top seven
trainees will perform under.

717
00:40:57,466 --> 00:40:58,736
The name...

718
00:41:00,037 --> 00:41:02,366
of PROJECT 7's final debut group...

719
00:41:03,707 --> 00:41:04,776
will be...

720
00:41:05,636 --> 00:41:06,807
revealed now.

721
00:41:07,607 --> 00:41:09,945
(I can't wait!)

722
00:41:09,946 --> 00:41:12,147
I can't wait.

723
00:41:16,687 --> 00:41:20,256
The name of the final debut group...

724
00:41:25,957 --> 00:41:27,897
will be revealed now.

725
00:41:38,207 --> 00:41:40,937
We close our eyes for
countless moments in a day.

726
00:41:41,776 --> 00:41:44,207
All the brief moments we close our eyes...

727
00:41:47,977 --> 00:41:49,986
Even the moment we close our eyes...

728
00:41:54,827 --> 00:41:57,627
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

729
00:42:12,136 --> 00:42:13,136
All right.

730
00:42:14,176 --> 00:42:15,377
The name...

731
00:42:16,377 --> 00:42:18,276
of PROJECT 7's debut group is...

732
00:42:19,216 --> 00:42:21,517
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

733
00:42:23,747 --> 00:42:25,017
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

734
00:42:25,457 --> 00:42:27,087
The group will captivate the audience...

735
00:42:27,886 --> 00:42:29,386
not only through their performance...

736
00:42:29,687 --> 00:42:32,557
but also with their music,
even with their eyes closed.

737
00:42:33,457 --> 00:42:35,537
Every time the audience
closes and opens their eyes,

738
00:42:35,627 --> 00:42:37,526
the group will transform...

739
00:42:38,296 --> 00:42:41,837
into the idol group of their
dreams and continue improving.

740
00:42:44,537 --> 00:42:45,636
I wonder...

741
00:42:46,477 --> 00:42:47,877
which trainees...

742
00:42:49,176 --> 00:42:52,577
will debut as members of CLOSE YOUR EYES.

743
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:57,087
Stay tuned to find out.

744
00:43:00,517 --> 00:43:02,386
Moreover, CLOSE YOUR EYES...

745
00:43:03,327 --> 00:43:05,857
will debut with the sponsorship...

746
00:43:06,897 --> 00:43:09,096
of UNCORE, a joint label of YG PLUS, SLL,

747
00:43:10,426 --> 00:43:12,667
and STUDIO SLAM.

748
00:43:14,537 --> 00:43:16,906
They plan to perform actively...

749
00:43:17,366 --> 00:43:20,676
on music shows and concert tours.

750
00:43:23,776 --> 00:43:26,716
CLOSE YOUR EYES
will be a global idol group.

751
00:43:27,577 --> 00:43:29,537
You can visit the social
media page of the group,

752
00:43:30,087 --> 00:43:31,416
CLOSE YOUR EYES,

753
00:43:31,417 --> 00:43:33,656
to find out about their future activities.

754
00:43:34,017 --> 00:43:36,926
Please show them your
support and wish them luck.

755
00:43:40,057 --> 00:43:42,226
All right. Let me ask another question.

756
00:43:42,227 --> 00:43:43,596
Director Ryan.

757
00:43:44,566 --> 00:43:45,596
Yes.

758
00:43:47,096 --> 00:43:49,036
The name of the group has been revealed.

759
00:43:49,037 --> 00:43:50,037
What do you think?

760
00:43:50,307 --> 00:43:52,676
First of all, let me close my eyes.

761
00:43:55,207 --> 00:43:56,776
I can see seven guys.

762
00:43:58,176 --> 00:43:59,346
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

763
00:43:59,747 --> 00:44:01,716
That has a nice feel
to it. What do you think?

764
00:44:03,216 --> 00:44:05,656
They like it. And I like it too.

765
00:44:09,787 --> 00:44:10,926
All right.

766
00:44:12,327 --> 00:44:13,826
This will play a huge role
in selecting the trainees...

767
00:44:13,827 --> 00:44:16,127
for the final debut group.

768
00:44:17,866 --> 00:44:19,336
This last project will
be an important factor...

769
00:44:19,337 --> 00:44:20,796
for the selection.

770
00:44:22,736 --> 00:44:25,506
It's time for their Final Match.

771
00:44:29,906 --> 00:44:33,977
The World Assemblers put
together 3 groups of 7 trainees.

772
00:44:34,216 --> 00:44:36,346
"ACT UP."

773
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:39,787
"Antidote." "PSYCHO."

774
00:44:40,616 --> 00:44:44,127
We will watch three
performances from the trainees.

775
00:44:46,897 --> 00:44:50,296
Moreover, after the Third Passing Ceremony,

776
00:44:50,426 --> 00:44:52,636
the voting clips for the
highlights of the songs aired.

777
00:44:54,397 --> 00:44:56,506
The World Assemblers...

778
00:44:57,136 --> 00:45:00,736
selected the members
to perform the highlights.

779
00:45:09,287 --> 00:45:11,786
Which trainees got the honor...

780
00:45:11,787 --> 00:45:14,255
of performing the
highlights at the Final Match?

781
00:45:14,256 --> 00:45:16,216
(Which trainees won the
highlights of the songs?)

782
00:45:16,857 --> 00:45:18,557
The selected trainees...

783
00:45:21,997 --> 00:45:23,095
(Always PARK JUNSEO)

784
00:45:23,096 --> 00:45:24,195
(Let's debut, WOO HAJOON.)

785
00:45:24,196 --> 00:45:25,866
(KENSHIN)

786
00:45:30,437 --> 00:45:32,607
You will find out through the video.

787
00:45:37,807 --> 00:45:39,977
The first new song of the Final Match...

788
00:45:40,816 --> 00:45:42,546
is "ACT UP." We will watch...

789
00:45:43,417 --> 00:45:44,646
their training process
and their performance...

790
00:45:44,647 --> 00:45:45,755
for the very first time.

791
00:45:45,756 --> 00:45:47,836
(The performance of "ACT
UP" will be revealed soon.)

792
00:45:50,256 --> 00:45:52,796
Let's watch it now.

793
00:46:02,006 --> 00:46:03,266
- Nice to meet you. - Yes.

794
00:46:03,267 --> 00:46:04,667
Nice to meet you.

795
00:46:05,607 --> 00:46:06,675
Let's begin.

796
00:46:06,676 --> 00:46:07,736
- Let's go. - Okay.

797
00:46:09,207 --> 00:46:11,405
(They watch the choreography
video of "ACT UP" first.)

798
00:46:11,406 --> 00:46:13,046
You can come closer to watch it.

799
00:46:14,846 --> 00:46:17,287
(Director Bada created the choreography.)

800
00:46:20,187 --> 00:46:21,187
(Impressed)

801
00:46:21,557 --> 00:46:22,986
The choreography was really cool.

802
00:46:23,287 --> 00:46:25,596
The choreography was totally my style.

803
00:46:25,756 --> 00:46:26,996
It was really cool.

804
00:46:26,997 --> 00:46:28,526
I love it. I love all of it.

805
00:46:28,997 --> 00:46:30,426
I love the choreography.

806
00:46:30,727 --> 00:46:32,796
Director Bada is indeed the best.

807
00:46:35,437 --> 00:46:36,437
(Chuckling)

808
00:46:38,776 --> 00:46:39,776
That's so cool.

809
00:46:41,846 --> 00:46:45,016
(Unlike other trainees, ANDY
seems especially unhappy.)

810
00:46:45,017 --> 00:46:48,517
I couldn't get the part I wanted.

811
00:46:48,687 --> 00:46:50,286
When I was watching it,

812
00:46:50,287 --> 00:46:51,763
I thought I wouldn't
stand out during my part.

813
00:46:51,787 --> 00:46:53,957
Because he was able to push me out,

814
00:46:54,656 --> 00:46:56,687
I ended up with a different part.

815
00:46:57,957 --> 00:47:00,757
(It was Trainee AHN JUNWON's
turn to push out a trainee for his part.)

816
00:47:00,926 --> 00:47:02,667
- He usually... - LYNNLYNN.

817
00:47:02,866 --> 00:47:05,566
(He took the main vocalist's
role and pushed out LYNNLYNN.)

818
00:47:07,796 --> 00:47:09,396
YICHEN is going to be the lead vocalist.

819
00:47:09,966 --> 00:47:12,406
No!

820
00:47:13,037 --> 00:47:14,135
Please.

821
00:47:14,136 --> 00:47:17,446
(Trainee JUNG SEYUN was
inserted into Trainee ANDY's spot.)

822
00:47:18,176 --> 00:47:21,147
(Then Trainee ANDY lost the
spot to Trainee PARK JUNSEO.)

823
00:47:21,577 --> 00:47:23,345
(What? What's he doing?)

824
00:47:23,346 --> 00:47:25,156
(That's just weird now.)

825
00:47:25,486 --> 00:47:28,425
(JUNWON suddenly changed everything.)

826
00:47:28,426 --> 00:47:30,026
(I was really angry.)

827
00:47:30,256 --> 00:47:33,457
(Trainee AHN JUNWON brought
major changes to their positions.)

828
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:37,066
(Sighing)

829
00:47:37,997 --> 00:47:39,136
Do you not like this part?

830
00:47:39,566 --> 00:47:40,566
No.

831
00:47:42,636 --> 00:47:44,565
I thought that some of my teammates...

832
00:47:44,566 --> 00:47:46,506
wouldn't be happy with my decision.

833
00:47:46,707 --> 00:47:48,707
I could clearly see that ANDY...

834
00:47:49,147 --> 00:47:51,046
and YICHEN weren't happy with the changes.

835
00:47:51,816 --> 00:47:52,946
I realized that...

836
00:47:53,816 --> 00:47:54,977
I had a small part.

837
00:47:55,616 --> 00:47:57,517
JUNWON pushed me down.

838
00:47:57,846 --> 00:47:59,385
Other than that, I'm
just disappointed that...

839
00:47:59,386 --> 00:48:00,917
this is our final performance.

840
00:48:01,116 --> 00:48:04,155
It will be my last
performance on PROJECT 7.

841
00:48:04,156 --> 00:48:06,327
So that's a bit disappointing.

842
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:08,796
My part is really minimal.

843
00:48:10,727 --> 00:48:11,796
I'm done.

844
00:48:14,236 --> 00:48:15,606
(Vocalizing)

845
00:48:15,607 --> 00:48:17,066
(Vocalizing)

846
00:48:17,466 --> 00:48:19,106
(Giggling)

847
00:48:19,107 --> 00:48:20,876
Since this is our final
performance, I want us...

848
00:48:20,877 --> 00:48:22,997
to practice in a friendly
mood without any conflicts.

849
00:48:23,247 --> 00:48:25,123
I hope we can get along
while preparing for it.

850
00:48:25,147 --> 00:48:27,345
Okay. No problem.

851
00:48:27,346 --> 00:48:28,985
Actually, I don't mind...

852
00:48:28,986 --> 00:48:32,256
if I don't have a singing
part in this performance.

853
00:48:32,557 --> 00:48:35,986
Completing the stage well is important.

854
00:48:36,127 --> 00:48:39,196
It's okay even if I don't get a part.

855
00:48:39,957 --> 00:48:42,327
(But there was a part that wasn't okay.)

856
00:48:42,497 --> 00:48:44,226
Step over all the limits

857
00:48:44,227 --> 00:48:46,167
(There's a pronunciation issue.)

858
00:48:46,437 --> 00:48:49,366
Step over all the limits

859
00:48:50,267 --> 00:48:53,776
Step over

860
00:48:53,977 --> 00:48:56,107
Over. Gosh.

861
00:48:56,477 --> 00:48:59,276
Step over all the limits,
Kill what's troublesome

862
00:48:59,377 --> 00:49:00,815
- Yes. - Yes.

863
00:49:00,816 --> 00:49:02,446
Kill what's troublesome

864
00:49:05,687 --> 00:49:07,315
(The kick and bass become
louder, I flick my fingers on the stage)

865
00:49:07,316 --> 00:49:10,486
(Another member with a pronunciation issue)

866
00:49:10,587 --> 00:49:11,755
Lift the spirits higher

867
00:49:11,756 --> 00:49:15,267
I have to pronounce one syllable at a time.

868
00:49:15,296 --> 00:49:18,596
I think I should practice
how to pronounce more.

869
00:49:20,236 --> 00:49:22,106
(There is another problem.)

870
00:49:22,107 --> 00:49:24,807
(The high notes)

871
00:49:25,107 --> 00:49:26,376
(Laughing)

872
00:49:26,377 --> 00:49:27,506
(Goodness)

873
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:30,945
(We follow our own style)

874
00:49:30,946 --> 00:49:33,077
(We jump up without fear again)

875
00:49:33,716 --> 00:49:34,846
What's the tune?

876
00:49:35,846 --> 00:49:37,446
The only person who could manage that...

877
00:49:37,546 --> 00:49:40,486
was LYNNLYNN.

878
00:49:40,787 --> 00:49:44,127
(Can sing high notes,
Can't sing high notes)

879
00:49:44,426 --> 00:49:47,255
But for LYNNLYNN to do it,

880
00:49:47,256 --> 00:49:50,526
the pronunciation issue made it difficult.

881
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:52,016
The note for the main vocalist...

882
00:49:52,337 --> 00:49:53,337
was...

883
00:49:53,397 --> 00:49:56,135
It kept staying on the second octave...

884
00:49:56,136 --> 00:49:58,505
la and ti.

885
00:49:58,506 --> 00:50:01,107
I think the note is very
high for the main vocalist.

886
00:50:01,377 --> 00:50:04,107
How do I make this sound?

887
00:50:04,276 --> 00:50:06,376
(He's in a panic because
of the high notes.)

888
00:50:06,377 --> 00:50:08,885
(He's also in a panic
because of the high notes.)

889
00:50:08,886 --> 00:50:11,215
(I'll gladly be the new wanna be)

890
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:13,417
(A fixed role is not for us)

891
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:15,485
Do you think you'll be
able to do it with practice?

892
00:50:15,486 --> 00:50:17,386
- What? - Will practice make it possible?

893
00:50:17,526 --> 00:50:20,127
Actually, I'm losing hope while practicing.

894
00:50:20,696 --> 00:50:23,866
I was given an important, central,

895
00:50:23,897 --> 00:50:27,997
and leading part. It's a
part with lots of high notes.

896
00:50:28,236 --> 00:50:32,536
I'm a bit worried because of the burden...

897
00:50:32,537 --> 00:50:33,937
that I want to create a good stage.

898
00:50:35,607 --> 00:50:38,346
(They practice separately.)

899
00:50:38,546 --> 00:50:40,316
(He practices the choreography separately.)

900
00:50:41,946 --> 00:50:43,886
(They practice singing separately.)

901
00:50:45,787 --> 00:50:50,156
We each were very
worried about our own parts.

902
00:50:51,386 --> 00:50:53,333
I think that was why we couldn't
build the team chemistry...

903
00:50:53,357 --> 00:50:55,966
and proceeded slowly.

904
00:50:57,926 --> 00:51:01,236
(There's another problem waiting for them.)

905
00:51:01,937 --> 00:51:03,566
- Everyone. - Focus.

906
00:51:04,406 --> 00:51:05,607
There is...

907
00:51:05,776 --> 00:51:08,946
one important thing left for you.

908
00:51:09,307 --> 00:51:11,906
(There's an important announcement.)

909
00:51:13,377 --> 00:51:14,416
It's...

910
00:51:14,417 --> 00:51:16,046
(Announcement about the highlight part)

911
00:51:16,187 --> 00:51:17,316
about the highlight part.

912
00:51:18,616 --> 00:51:19,656
Goodness.

913
00:51:19,716 --> 00:51:22,425
In the songs of the Final
Match, there are highlight parts...

914
00:51:22,426 --> 00:51:24,957
that only one member in a team can take.

915
00:51:25,857 --> 00:51:26,897
The highlight part.

916
00:51:27,796 --> 00:51:31,327
All the trainees must
try out the highlight part.

917
00:51:31,696 --> 00:51:33,267
Okay.

918
00:51:33,437 --> 00:51:35,636
The trainees will all take turns...

919
00:51:35,736 --> 00:51:40,235
to record a live performance
video of the highlight part for voting.

920
00:51:40,236 --> 00:51:41,956
(Record a highlight part video for voting.)

921
00:51:43,977 --> 00:51:46,546
The member who will take the
highlight part will be decided...

922
00:51:47,417 --> 00:51:48,537
By the votes of the members?

923
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:50,507
The votes of the World Assemblers?

924
00:51:51,647 --> 00:51:53,716
By the World Assemblers.

925
00:51:55,557 --> 00:51:56,587
What?

926
00:51:56,957 --> 00:51:58,655
I see.

927
00:51:58,656 --> 00:52:02,127
I was curious about what
the highlight parts were,

928
00:52:02,227 --> 00:52:05,596
and I thought, "Will I be able to get it?"

929
00:52:05,897 --> 00:52:07,167
I'm really confident.

930
00:52:07,437 --> 00:52:10,207
I'm the most confident
when it comes to this song.

931
00:52:10,937 --> 00:52:13,736
This is the final stage.

932
00:52:14,006 --> 00:52:15,307
I thought...

933
00:52:15,477 --> 00:52:19,077
I should do my best
to get the highlight part.

934
00:52:21,216 --> 00:52:23,715
The highlight part was cut out.

935
00:52:23,716 --> 00:52:24,716
(They check the highlight
part for "ACT UP.")

936
00:52:24,717 --> 00:52:27,517
- It's JUNWON's part. - That's me.

937
00:52:27,816 --> 00:52:29,556
It could be playing from the previous part.

938
00:52:29,557 --> 00:52:30,586
Is that so?

939
00:52:30,587 --> 00:52:32,326
The highlight part could be my part...

940
00:52:32,327 --> 00:52:34,096
or JUNSEO's chorus part.

941
00:52:34,196 --> 00:52:36,496
I'd like the intro part...

942
00:52:36,497 --> 00:52:38,767
and of course, I want the chorus part.

943
00:52:39,196 --> 00:52:42,267
I think I'll get the chorus part.

944
00:52:42,406 --> 00:52:44,866
At least one of the chorus parts.

945
00:52:45,136 --> 00:52:47,136
There's a part that goes, "Act up."

946
00:52:47,307 --> 00:52:51,247
I think I fit the part well...

947
00:52:51,477 --> 00:52:53,522
considering the choreography
and performance as well.

948
00:52:53,546 --> 00:52:54,846
I like it the most.

949
00:52:54,977 --> 00:52:58,046
I think I'd feel very
bad if I lose the part.

950
00:52:58,986 --> 00:53:01,187
- Can you all see it?
- It's the first verse's chorus.

951
00:53:01,417 --> 00:53:04,017
- It's the first verse's chorus.
- It's the first verse's chorus.

952
00:53:04,156 --> 00:53:06,756
- It's the first verse's chorus.
- It's the first verse's chorus.

953
00:53:06,957 --> 00:53:07,997
Right.

954
00:53:10,966 --> 00:53:13,595
(Highlight Part: Chorus 1)

955
00:53:13,596 --> 00:53:15,813
- It's the first verse's chorus.
- It's the first verse's chorus.

956
00:53:15,837 --> 00:53:17,836
(He's about to lose the part he liked.)

957
00:53:17,837 --> 00:53:20,576
I don't think I'm scared
about losing the part...

958
00:53:20,577 --> 00:53:23,446
because I'm not good.

959
00:53:23,577 --> 00:53:25,937
I'm confident, and I'd like to
get the part no matter what.

960
00:53:26,077 --> 00:53:27,816
Act up

961
00:53:28,787 --> 00:53:30,845
Act up

962
00:53:30,846 --> 00:53:32,255
- Act up - Act up

963
00:53:32,256 --> 00:53:34,886
- Everyone is singing the part.
- They're all on fire.

964
00:53:35,087 --> 00:53:36,956
I'm confident in singing this.

965
00:53:36,957 --> 00:53:39,226
JUNSEO might be better than me in dancing.

966
00:53:39,227 --> 00:53:41,926
But considering everything,

967
00:53:42,227 --> 00:53:45,636
I thought I had a chance to win the part.

968
00:53:46,397 --> 00:53:48,436
In terms of the physical aspects,

969
00:53:48,437 --> 00:53:52,405
I think I'd lose against
JUNSEO or MAJINGXIANG.

970
00:53:52,406 --> 00:53:55,006
But in terms of the charm
or the unexpected charm,

971
00:53:55,377 --> 00:53:57,747
I think I can do better
than the other members.

972
00:53:57,906 --> 00:54:00,247
I'm trying to be careful...

973
00:54:00,517 --> 00:54:02,147
because there are members without parts.

974
00:54:02,247 --> 00:54:05,146
But honestly, it will be voted,

975
00:54:05,147 --> 00:54:06,615
so I have to try.

976
00:54:06,616 --> 00:54:10,357
The person who does it best
has to stand in that position.

977
00:54:10,957 --> 00:54:12,596
I don't know who will take the part,

978
00:54:12,926 --> 00:54:15,397
but I hope it will be
me. I want to keep it.

979
00:54:16,267 --> 00:54:19,667
Act up

980
00:54:20,466 --> 00:54:22,536
(One who tries to keep...)

981
00:54:22,537 --> 00:54:25,607
(and one who tries to take)

982
00:54:27,906 --> 00:54:30,506
I think I put in a lot of effort
in the highlight part challenge.

983
00:54:30,807 --> 00:54:32,517
I'm the most desperate for it.

984
00:54:32,946 --> 00:54:34,316
I'll practice hard,

985
00:54:35,687 --> 00:54:37,787
and I hope I get the highlight part.

986
00:54:38,957 --> 00:54:40,786
I should grab the chance...

987
00:54:40,787 --> 00:54:42,156
to show more of myself.

988
00:54:43,787 --> 00:54:46,897
This is the final chance.

989
00:54:47,096 --> 00:54:50,327
That's why I want to
get the highlight part.

990
00:54:51,566 --> 00:54:55,136
I want to sing the highlight part too.

991
00:54:55,636 --> 00:54:58,937
We're going to act up

992
00:55:00,977 --> 00:55:02,506
Act up

993
00:55:02,906 --> 00:55:05,206
Please vote for me, World Assemblers.

994
00:55:05,207 --> 00:55:07,775
Please vote for me.

995
00:55:07,776 --> 00:55:09,486
The highlight part. Nice.

996
00:55:10,587 --> 00:55:13,616
Hello. I'm Trainee
LYNNLYNN of Team "ACT UP."

997
00:55:13,687 --> 00:55:17,256
Hello. I'm Trainee
MAJINGXIANG of Team "ACT UP."

998
00:55:17,457 --> 00:55:19,026
I'll try out for the highlight part.

999
00:55:27,736 --> 00:55:32,336
(Who will take the highlight part...)

1000
00:55:32,337 --> 00:55:36,877
(for "ACT UP?")

1008
01:00:51,727 --> 01:00:52,957
The first new song...

1009
01:00:53,296 --> 01:00:56,426
of the Final Project was "ACT UP."

1010
01:00:57,227 --> 01:01:00,436
The seven trainees who prepared "ACT UP..."

1011
01:01:00,437 --> 01:01:02,966
performed first.

1012
01:01:04,607 --> 01:01:06,477
The stage expressed
the trainees' confidence,

1013
01:01:07,006 --> 01:01:11,107
composure, and style in their own way.

1014
01:01:15,986 --> 01:01:19,287
The person who took the highlight part...

1015
01:01:19,687 --> 01:01:21,756
was selected by the World Assemblers.

1016
01:01:23,357 --> 01:01:25,755
It was Trainee YICHEN.

1017
01:01:25,756 --> 01:01:28,996
(YICHEN took the
highlight part for "ACT UP.")

1018
01:01:28,997 --> 01:01:31,267
(YICHEN)

1019
01:01:32,767 --> 01:01:36,207
Director Bada, you were in charge
of the choreography of "ACT UP."

1020
01:01:37,736 --> 01:01:38,767
Yes.

1021
01:01:39,477 --> 01:01:41,837
Do you think the trainees
performed well on stage?

1022
01:01:42,107 --> 01:01:44,807
They did so well. Did you all see that?

1023
01:01:45,107 --> 01:01:46,977
- Yes! - Yes.

1024
01:01:47,216 --> 01:01:49,586
While making the choreography of this song,

1025
01:01:49,587 --> 01:01:52,616
I put a lot of thought
into it with the trainees...

1026
01:01:52,886 --> 01:01:54,956
as it was a very powerful
and charming song.

1027
01:01:54,957 --> 01:01:58,626
My team, BEBE also worked
hard in making the choreography.

1028
01:01:58,627 --> 01:02:02,425
I want to say I feel
proud of the trainees...

1029
01:02:02,426 --> 01:02:05,166
for performing so well on the stage.

1030
01:02:05,167 --> 01:02:06,897
I feel very proud as the choreographer.

1031
01:02:07,136 --> 01:02:09,196
Well done. It was so awesome.

1032
01:02:10,906 --> 01:02:13,776
(Let's debut, YICHEN.)

1033
01:02:15,707 --> 01:02:18,207
Director Ha Sung Woon.

1034
01:02:18,577 --> 01:02:21,116
Could you please say
a word about the stage?

1035
01:02:22,787 --> 01:02:26,017
First of all, I watched the
stage with my mouth open.

1036
01:02:27,216 --> 01:02:29,756
I think they did 100 times better...

1037
01:02:30,587 --> 01:02:32,426
than at the practice and the rehearsal.

1038
01:02:32,587 --> 01:02:36,926
When I put the concept and
visuals into consideration,

1039
01:02:37,526 --> 01:02:38,996
they pulled it off so well.

1040
01:02:38,997 --> 01:02:41,066
I think they were assembled very well.

1041
01:02:41,337 --> 01:02:44,565
I thought they could debut like that.

1042
01:02:44,566 --> 01:02:46,906
It was like watching a
stage on a music show.

1043
01:02:47,406 --> 01:02:48,537
It was amazing!

1044
01:02:50,207 --> 01:02:53,116
(MAJINGXIANG)

1045
01:02:55,147 --> 01:02:57,885
The trainees worked day and night...

1046
01:02:57,886 --> 01:03:00,216
to complete the "ACT UP" performance.

1047
01:03:00,716 --> 01:03:03,557
I hope they will get good results.

1048
01:03:06,827 --> 01:03:09,056

1049
01:03:09,057 --> 01:03:10,426

who support the trainees...

1052
01:03:18,437 --> 01:03:22,506
are voting at the moment.

1053

Now,

1054
01:03:27,247 --> 01:03:29,616
before revealing the second stage,

1055
01:03:31,287 --> 01:03:33,856
I think you'd be curious
about the rank of the trainee...

1056
01:03:33,857 --> 01:03:35,557
you're rooting for.

1057
01:03:44,026 --> 01:03:46,596
Based on the fourth global voting score,

1058
01:03:47,736 --> 01:03:51,037
there are two trainees who
are on the boundary of passing...

1059
01:03:52,006 --> 01:03:55,477
and being eliminated.

(MAJINGXIANG)

1062
01:04:13,227 --> 01:04:14,596
You must be very curious...

1063
01:04:15,997 --> 01:04:18,127
about who the two trainees are.

1064
01:04:19,696 --> 01:04:21,196
The two trainees...

1065
01:04:22,337 --> 01:04:24,636
who are on the verge of being eliminated.

1066
01:04:24,937 --> 01:04:31,147
(The 2 elimination
candidates will be revealed.)

1067

(JUNWON)

1068
01:04:35,577 --> 01:04:37,647
They will be revealed on the screen.

1072
01:04:53,497 --> 01:04:54,695

(KIM SUNGMIN, SONG SEUNGHO)

1075
01:05:06,577 --> 01:05:08,346
They are Trainee KIM SUNGMIN...

1076
01:05:08,716 --> 01:05:12,386
and Trainee SONG SEUNGHO.

1077
01:05:14,187 --> 01:05:17,687
The ranks of the
trainees won't be revealed.

(NAM JIWOON)

1080
01:05:22,026 --> 01:05:24,096
We still have more stages left.

1081
01:05:24,227 --> 01:05:27,167
It's getting harder to
predict the final result.

1082
01:05:27,866 --> 01:05:29,482
The result can be turned around any time...

1083
01:05:29,506 --> 01:05:33,276
until the voting is closed.

1084
01:05:35,207 --> 01:05:36,275

Now,

1089
01:05:48,616 --> 01:05:50,687
we'll see the trainees...

1090
01:05:52,187 --> 01:05:53,356
of the second new song of the Final Match,

1091
01:05:53,357 --> 01:05:54,695
(The stage of "Antidote" will be revealed.)

1093
01:06:02,236 --> 01:06:04,065
Who will be singing...

1094
01:06:04,066 --> 01:06:06,136
the highlight part of
"Antidote," the second stage?

1095
01:06:07,107 --> 01:06:10,446
And how amazing would their stage be?

1096
01:06:11,676 --> 01:06:14,077
The practicing process
of the seven trainees...

1097
01:06:14,616 --> 01:06:16,316
and the stage of the new song...

1098
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:20,587
will be revealed...

1099
01:06:21,587 --> 01:06:22,687
now.

(Training room of Team "Antidote")

1101
01:06:30,366 --> 01:06:31,525
To me

1102
01:06:31,526 --> 01:06:33,195
I can't endure it

1103
01:06:33,196 --> 01:06:34,537
It only goes

1104
01:06:37,406 --> 01:06:40,675
Because baby, you are

1105
01:06:40,676 --> 01:06:41,735
Right.

1106
01:06:41,736 --> 01:06:43,107
The song is really nice.

1107
01:06:44,046 --> 01:06:47,176
It's nice. It's really nice. I
wanted to try this mood.

1108
01:06:48,747 --> 01:06:49,986
We were one

1109
01:06:52,216 --> 01:06:53,687
The choreography is so pretty.

1110
01:06:54,457 --> 01:06:55,686
- Is it difficult? - No.

1111
01:06:55,687 --> 01:06:57,126
It's not difficult. It's so pretty.

1112
01:06:57,127 --> 01:06:58,926
It's pretty.

1113
01:07:00,256 --> 01:07:03,566
(The draft of the
choreography of "Antidote")

1114
01:07:07,897 --> 01:07:09,905
It's so difficult.

1115
01:07:09,906 --> 01:07:11,406
(It's so difficult.)

1116
01:07:12,337 --> 01:07:13,817
It must be easier than theirs, right?

1117
01:07:14,006 --> 01:07:15,336
- What? - Than the other teams'.

1118
01:07:15,337 --> 01:07:17,537
- It's easier than the other teams'.
- That's a relief.

1119
01:07:17,946 --> 01:07:19,546
I was worried about SUNGMIN.

1120
01:07:19,946 --> 01:07:22,877
I watched the choreography of "Antidote."

1121
01:07:23,046 --> 01:07:24,687
It was very difficult.

1122
01:07:25,647 --> 01:07:26,656
One.

1123
01:07:29,216 --> 01:07:30,886
What was after this?

1124
01:07:32,256 --> 01:07:36,997
(Trainee KIM SUNGMIN is
slowly learning the choreography.)

1125
01:07:39,227 --> 01:07:40,636
I learned it from BINGHUA.

1126
01:07:41,037 --> 01:07:42,295
- I can dance now. - You can...

1127
01:07:42,296 --> 01:07:43,736
- show us from the front. - Okay.

1128
01:07:44,236 --> 01:07:45,807
Watch me and dance.

1129
01:07:46,136 --> 01:07:47,537
I'll watch SUNGMIN.

1130
01:08:01,116 --> 01:08:02,616
SUNGMIN dances well.

1131
01:08:04,057 --> 01:08:05,956
- How did he improve so much?
- Did I improve?

1132
01:08:05,957 --> 01:08:07,672
- It's better than I thought.
- You improved a lot.

1133
01:08:07,696 --> 01:08:09,296
I'm shocked. You're really good.

1134
01:08:09,297 --> 01:08:10,997
I can do it.

1135
01:08:11,127 --> 01:08:13,097
I'm not the KIM SUNGMIN from "RUN."

1136
01:08:14,037 --> 01:08:16,097
(Even in the vocal lesson)

1137
01:08:17,137 --> 01:08:19,007
- SUNGMIN improved a lot. - Thank you.

1138
01:08:19,406 --> 01:08:20,507
Good. Well done.

1139
01:08:21,707 --> 01:08:23,046
I think SUNGMIN improved a lot.

1140
01:08:23,047 --> 01:08:24,567
His dancing skills improved a lot too.

1141
01:08:25,177 --> 01:08:27,047
I was with SUNGMIN in P4.

1142
01:08:28,946 --> 01:08:31,515
He was bad at dancing at the time,

1143
01:08:31,516 --> 01:08:33,016
so I was very worried this time.

1144
01:08:33,587 --> 01:08:34,686
I can't memorize it.

1145
01:08:37,087 --> 01:08:38,726
But he did really well this time.

1146
01:08:39,387 --> 01:08:42,656
I think the phrase that says,
"Hard work never betrays you..."

1147
01:08:42,927 --> 01:08:44,427
isn't wrong.

1148
01:08:47,297 --> 01:08:49,707
(Director's interim evaluation)

1149
01:08:50,306 --> 01:08:53,007

1150
01:08:53,236 --> 01:08:55,177
In a large room

1151
01:08:56,207 --> 01:08:59,106
You and I blazed up

1152
01:08:59,377 --> 01:09:01,046
Baby, I don't want to be

1153
01:09:01,047 --> 01:09:04,016
I don't want to be alone

1154
01:09:04,347 --> 01:09:06,116
Now run to you

1155
01:09:07,417 --> 01:09:09,387
Faster even if my breath runs out

1156
01:09:11,257 --> 01:09:13,056
Antidote

1157
01:09:14,257 --> 01:09:15,856
Antidote

1158
01:09:21,537 --> 01:09:22,566
KYOUNGBAE.

1159
01:09:23,537 --> 01:09:25,707
- They're good. - Right.

1160
01:09:25,906 --> 01:09:29,636
There are many good vocalists
like YOUNGSEO and BINGHUA.

1161
01:09:29,637 --> 01:09:30,645
Yes.

1162
01:09:30,646 --> 01:09:32,305
YOUNGSEO was assembled well.

1163
01:09:32,306 --> 01:09:33,445
I think they were assembled well.

1164
01:09:33,446 --> 01:09:36,686
I think you fit this type of song well.

1165
01:09:36,787 --> 01:09:37,916
Even the previous song.

1166
01:09:37,917 --> 01:09:39,787
Right. You're a crucial member.

1167
01:09:40,016 --> 01:09:41,217
SUNGMIN.

1168
01:09:41,356 --> 01:09:43,025
- What happened? - You improved a lot.

1169
01:09:43,026 --> 01:09:44,887
You did that in one day?

1170
01:09:45,127 --> 01:09:47,226
I was shocked.

1171
01:09:47,757 --> 01:09:50,195
- You're amazing, SUNGMIN.
- You improved a lot.

1172
01:09:50,196 --> 01:09:51,396
Seriously.

1173
01:09:51,667 --> 01:09:53,235
What are you doing, SUNGMIN?

1174
01:09:53,236 --> 01:09:54,695
- You were slow. - I'm sorry.

1175
01:09:54,696 --> 01:09:56,466
No. You can practice.

1176
01:09:56,467 --> 01:09:57,805
You have to practice more.

1177
01:09:57,806 --> 01:09:59,935
Is this the best you can do?

1178
01:09:59,936 --> 01:10:01,076
Is this the best you can do?

1179
01:10:01,077 --> 01:10:03,717
If you do this part like this,
it'll all be ruined because of you.

1180
01:10:04,007 --> 01:10:05,353
You shouldn't prepare it like this.

1181
01:10:05,377 --> 01:10:06,577
I'm getting a reality hit.

1182
01:10:10,186 --> 01:10:13,156
(He kept practicing to
make a perfect stage.)

1183
01:10:13,856 --> 01:10:16,316
KYOUNGBAE. What's after this?

1184
01:10:23,297 --> 01:10:26,226
RyuD said he was shocked.

1185
01:10:26,766 --> 01:10:28,766
"You did this in one day?"

1186
01:10:28,936 --> 01:10:31,366
He said that.

1187
01:10:31,606 --> 01:10:35,105
I guess my efforts were shown.

1188
01:10:35,106 --> 01:10:36,547
Whenever I hear things like that,

1189
01:10:36,806 --> 01:10:40,347
I get to think I want to try
harder and show people more.

1190
01:10:40,577 --> 01:10:42,976
KYOUNGBAE looks cool.

1191
01:10:43,417 --> 01:10:44,586
Why is he cool...

1192
01:10:44,587 --> 01:10:45,786
- when he's the youngest? - KYOUNGBAE...

1193
01:10:45,787 --> 01:10:47,716
has a sexy charm that
can't exist at his age.

1194
01:10:47,717 --> 01:10:48,916
- Right.
- He doesn't seem like the youngest.

1195
01:10:48,917 --> 01:10:50,225
It's a sexy charm you
can't find from the youngest.

1196
01:10:50,226 --> 01:10:51,826
When he did this at the end.

1197
01:10:51,827 --> 01:10:53,225
- That's right. - It was sexy.

1198
01:10:53,226 --> 01:10:54,226
He's the youngest.

1199
01:10:54,227 --> 01:10:55,856
Personally,

1200
01:10:56,327 --> 01:10:58,967
when creating the choreography
for "ACT UP" and "Antidote,"

1201
01:10:59,597 --> 01:11:01,935
I felt happy as a choreographer.

1202
01:11:01,936 --> 01:11:04,605
It's not common for a choreographer...

1203
01:11:04,606 --> 01:11:06,736
to create a choreography
for such a good song.

1204
01:11:06,877 --> 01:11:09,776
I worked even harder this time.

1205
01:11:09,946 --> 01:11:13,746
So I personally want
you to feel that feeling too.

1206
01:11:13,747 --> 01:11:15,975
Your abilities and talent...

1207
01:11:15,976 --> 01:11:19,417
should become one so that it goes well.

1208
01:11:19,547 --> 01:11:22,286
So I want you to pour
out everything you got.

1209
01:11:22,287 --> 01:11:23,287
Right.

1210
01:11:24,556 --> 01:11:27,757
(They face the moment too.)

1211
01:11:31,066 --> 01:11:32,196
The highlight part.

1212
01:11:33,396 --> 01:11:35,766
I just hoped it wasn't my part.

1213
01:11:35,936 --> 01:11:38,006
Let it not be my part.

1214
01:11:38,007 --> 01:11:39,305
Let it not be my part.

1215
01:11:39,306 --> 01:11:41,346
- Let it not be my part.
- I hope it's not my part.

1216
01:11:42,406 --> 01:11:44,047
I hope it's not my part.

1217
01:11:44,306 --> 01:11:46,247
It won't be.

1218
01:11:46,516 --> 01:11:49,116
If I lose the verse, I'd
have three lines only.

1219
01:11:49,887 --> 01:11:51,086
Isn't that my part?

1220
01:11:51,087 --> 01:11:52,486
No. It's a relief.

1221
01:11:52,917 --> 01:11:54,087
Is it this part?

1222
01:11:54,486 --> 01:11:56,316
- Okay. - It's verse two.

1223
01:11:57,457 --> 01:11:58,485
Hold on.

1224
01:11:58,486 --> 01:12:01,996
(The highlight part for
"Antidote" is the 2nd chorus.)

1225
01:12:01,997 --> 01:12:04,526
(Highlight part)

1226
01:12:05,627 --> 01:12:07,337
It has my part as well.

1227
01:12:07,667 --> 01:12:08,696
Right.

1228
01:12:10,167 --> 01:12:13,507
I thought, "Why did my
part have to be there too?"

1229
01:12:13,837 --> 01:12:15,077
But since it's my part,

1230
01:12:15,106 --> 01:12:17,306
I can practice SIHUN's part as well...

1231
01:12:17,406 --> 01:12:19,347
and take it.

1232
01:12:19,747 --> 01:12:20,976
It's a chance for me.

1233
01:12:24,587 --> 01:12:26,887
I lost the main vocalist's position.

1234
01:12:27,587 --> 01:12:29,656
This is driving me crazy.

1235
01:12:30,127 --> 01:12:33,025
It could be a chance for me since
I lost the main vocalist's position.

1236
01:12:33,026 --> 01:12:34,225
(Main vocalist: KIM SIHUN,
Lead vocalist 1: YOO YOUNGSEO)

1237
01:12:34,226 --> 01:12:37,497
The highlight part is a really good part.

1238
01:12:37,766 --> 01:12:39,427
I'm confident.

1239
01:12:39,967 --> 01:12:41,797
Teach me this part, BINGHUA.

1240
01:12:43,406 --> 01:12:45,967
Run to you

1241
01:12:49,337 --> 01:12:53,247
It was the chorus, so
I really wanted to do it.

1242
01:12:54,276 --> 01:12:56,347
I think I can now leave an impression...

1243
01:12:56,717 --> 01:12:59,186
on the World Assemblers...

1244
01:12:59,217 --> 01:13:01,856
that I can pull it off.

1245
01:13:03,686 --> 01:13:06,797
I want to take this part no matter what.

1246
01:13:07,627 --> 01:13:10,525
Since it's our last performance,
I want to look good...

1247
01:13:10,526 --> 01:13:13,366
to the people who are
supporting me, even just by little.

1248
01:13:14,366 --> 01:13:17,507
I think the highlight part is the part...

1249
01:13:17,667 --> 01:13:21,306
that draws all the attention.

1250
01:13:21,707 --> 01:13:23,547
I thought taking the highlight...

1251
01:13:24,406 --> 01:13:28,377
could affect our ranking as well.

1252
01:13:29,247 --> 01:13:31,485
I think I'm the one who
knows how high of a wall it is...

1253
01:13:31,486 --> 01:13:33,757
to be in seventh place.

1254
01:13:34,457 --> 01:13:37,757
As I'm really close to debuting,

1255
01:13:38,726 --> 01:13:42,797
I think the chance of me debuting...

1256
01:13:42,896 --> 01:13:45,597
will increase if I take the highlight.

1257
01:13:46,196 --> 01:13:50,766
Doing each project on PROJECT 7,

1258
01:13:52,007 --> 01:13:55,776
I loved the cheers I
received from the crowd...

1259
01:13:56,037 --> 01:13:57,547
on the stage.

1260
01:13:59,547 --> 01:14:02,476
So I've become more desperate to debut.

1261
01:14:04,186 --> 01:14:06,186
Each time I did a performance,

1262
01:14:06,316 --> 01:14:08,387
I grew greedier.

1263
01:14:09,356 --> 01:14:12,386
I didn't simply have
fun. I wanted to do better,

1264
01:14:12,387 --> 01:14:16,297
and I wanted to perform
better for the World Assemblers.

1265
01:14:17,797 --> 01:14:19,396
Actually, during Zero Setting,

1266
01:14:19,597 --> 01:14:23,707
I thought of just
giving it a try and leave.

1267
01:14:24,467 --> 01:14:26,566
And that was because I
hadn't trained myself at all.

1268
01:14:28,476 --> 01:14:30,905
But now, I can confidently say...

1269
01:14:30,906 --> 01:14:34,616
that I must debut.

1270
01:14:36,347 --> 01:14:40,087
I think I've become more
desperate to become an idol.

1271
01:14:41,316 --> 01:14:43,457
I want to shine on stage.

1272
01:14:46,356 --> 01:14:49,426

Yes.

01:20:55,627 --> 01:20:57,526
How did you enjoy the performance?

First of all,

01:20:59,566 --> 01:21:02,235
my hands are really sweaty.

1315
01:21:02,236 --> 01:21:05,266
I was also really nervous
while watching them.

1316
01:21:05,366 --> 01:21:08,376
While they practiced for "Antidote,"

1317
01:21:08,377 --> 01:21:12,405
I made them practice
expressing their emotions more.

1318
01:21:12,406 --> 01:21:17,047
Delivering your emotions
on stage takes a big part.

1319
01:21:17,316 --> 01:21:19,346
The trainees did really well on that part,

1320
01:21:19,347 --> 01:21:21,193
so I'm really proud of
them as the choreographer.

I didn't know they
could be this expressive.

1329

Not just their dancing and singing skills,

1330
01:21:51,686 --> 01:21:55,855
but their expressions
on stage improved a lot...

1331

directors and the World Assemblers,

1332

01:25:33,606 --> 01:25:35,137
- Move it like this. - Like this.

1410
01:25:35,637 --> 01:25:39,747
HYUNWOO is good at leading
the team with positive vibes.

1411
01:25:41,276 --> 01:25:42,646
I can't pull myself together.

1412
01:25:43,047 --> 01:25:45,986
I've always wanted to team up with SEUNGHO.

1413
01:25:46,087 --> 01:25:47,985
Finally, this is our last performance.

1414
01:25:47,986 --> 01:25:50,457
It's so nice that we
get to perform together.

1415
01:25:51,457 --> 01:25:52,626
(Oh, my. The beat is...)

1416
01:25:52,627 --> 01:25:53,656
The beat is...

1417
01:25:54,427 --> 01:25:55,597
SEUNGHO, which part?

1418
01:25:56,556 --> 01:25:57,666
- Right. - I think it was here.

1419
01:25:57,667 --> 01:25:59,865
I know that JEONGMIN is talented.

1420
01:25:59,866 --> 01:26:01,967
He's also good at sharing tips.

1421
01:26:02,266 --> 01:26:04,266
That's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

1422
01:26:05,467 --> 01:26:08,305
(Showing great teamwork while practicing)

1423
01:26:08,306 --> 01:26:09,306
Psycho...

1424
01:26:09,307 --> 01:26:11,406
I think there is great energy...

1425
01:26:11,606 --> 01:26:13,106
because I'm so happy with my team.

1426
01:26:13,446 --> 01:26:16,247
The team consists of seven
people I wanted to pick...

1427
01:26:16,516 --> 01:26:19,347
if they gave me a chance to pick.

1428
01:26:20,347 --> 01:26:21,987
- I'll play the music. - Is it your turn?

1429
01:26:22,486 --> 01:26:24,256
(Sub-vocalist)

1430
01:26:24,257 --> 01:26:26,757
(All-rounder)

1431
01:26:26,957 --> 01:26:28,457
Run...

1432
01:26:28,757 --> 01:26:29,895
(This man froze as he sang.)

1433
01:26:29,896 --> 01:26:32,565
Turn this up, Psycho who looks like me

1434
01:26:32,566 --> 01:26:33,566
(Patting)

1435
01:26:33,567 --> 01:26:34,667
We're going right

1436
01:26:35,997 --> 01:26:39,306
(Going out of tune)

1437
01:26:39,736 --> 01:26:42,606
(Drinking water)

1438
01:26:43,137 --> 01:26:45,246
Oh, my. Why isn't this working?

1439
01:26:45,247 --> 01:26:46,847
(The all-rounder has a lot on his mind.)

1440
01:26:47,847 --> 01:26:50,146
(Even the main rapper...)

1441
01:26:50,417 --> 01:26:51,445
Make it like that

1442
01:26:51,446 --> 01:26:54,516
(Struggling as he faces the
rap part with a lot of Korean)

1443
01:26:55,457 --> 01:26:57,457
The lyrics are too hard for me.

1444
01:26:57,787 --> 01:27:00,626
KENSHIN and I wanted
to show that we were good.

1445
01:27:00,627 --> 01:27:03,356
He and I took the main
rapper and all-rounder parts.

1446
01:27:03,757 --> 01:27:05,297
Pulling it off...

1447
01:27:05,696 --> 01:27:09,667
is the most important
thing for our team right now.

1448
01:27:11,537 --> 01:27:12,707
Tonight...

1449
01:27:13,066 --> 01:27:14,436
This is making me go crazy.

1450
01:27:14,707 --> 01:27:17,746
I thought, "Was I too greedy about this?"

1451
01:27:17,747 --> 01:27:19,507
Did I lower the team's
overall performance?"

1452
01:27:22,577 --> 01:27:26,217
Nonetheless, I have to make it work.

1453
01:27:26,686 --> 01:27:27,986
How come I can't do this?

1454
01:27:28,356 --> 01:27:29,656
(Singing)

1455
01:27:30,717 --> 01:27:31,786
Try it three times.

1456
01:27:31,787 --> 01:27:33,225
(Singing)

1457
01:27:33,226 --> 01:27:34,725
(Learning how to sing like a cat)

1458
01:27:34,726 --> 01:27:36,532
You have to make the
sound come out from the side.

1459
01:27:36,556 --> 01:27:38,827
(Practicing as he gets singing tips)

1460
01:27:39,896 --> 01:27:42,196
(On the other hand, Trainee KENSHIN...)

1461
01:27:42,597 --> 01:27:43,597
SEUNGHO.

1462
01:27:45,736 --> 01:27:47,236
How do I pull this part off?

1463
01:27:48,436 --> 01:27:50,507
- What you want... - What you want...

1464
01:27:50,847 --> 01:27:52,506
- What you want... - What you want...

1465
01:27:52,507 --> 01:27:53,577
What you want...

1466
01:27:54,247 --> 01:27:57,515
(Other trainees joining)

1467
01:27:57,516 --> 01:27:58,586
Do you think you got it?

1468
01:27:58,587 --> 01:27:59,747
What you want...

1469
01:28:00,816 --> 01:28:01,887
No, that's not it.

1470
01:28:02,257 --> 01:28:04,555
- Want... - Want...

1471
01:28:04,556 --> 01:28:05,926
Make the sound ring from the back.

1472
01:28:05,927 --> 01:28:06,927
There you go.

1473
01:28:07,087 --> 01:28:09,247
KENSHIN, you've improved
a lot compared to "Jealousy."

1474
01:28:09,656 --> 01:28:11,127
Thank you.

1475
01:28:12,827 --> 01:28:14,337
What you want...

1476
01:28:14,667 --> 01:28:17,366
KENSHIN practiced so hard.

1477
01:28:17,936 --> 01:28:19,805
We've been more like rivals...

1478
01:28:19,806 --> 01:28:21,976
fighting for 1st and 2nd places.

1479
01:28:22,306 --> 01:28:25,377
I think he can improve
a lot if we help him.

1480
01:28:25,806 --> 01:28:28,116
KENSHIN, let's practice together.

1481
01:28:28,877 --> 01:28:32,386
KENSHIN and I have to
practice hard to perform well.

1482
01:28:32,387 --> 01:28:34,717
You do it my way...

1483
01:28:35,717 --> 01:28:36,933
I can't wait to see their performance.

1484
01:28:36,957 --> 01:28:38,986
- These psychos. - Psychos?

1485
01:28:39,056 --> 01:28:40,356
The team assembly is amazing.

1486
01:28:41,127 --> 01:28:43,026
- They are all talented.
- It's a strong team.

1487
01:28:43,297 --> 01:28:45,137
It's impossible that
they cannot perform well.

1488
01:28:45,196 --> 01:28:46,967
(Flattered)

1489
01:28:47,637 --> 01:28:49,136
- Shall we start? - Yes.

1490
01:28:49,137 --> 01:28:50,137
Let's see it right away.

1491
01:28:55,537 --> 01:28:56,606
- Goodness. - Nice.

1492
01:28:57,276 --> 01:28:58,276
They are so talented.

1493
01:28:58,277 --> 01:28:59,517
- Of course. - What's going on?

1494
01:28:59,776 --> 01:29:02,445
Tonight, we are above our instinct

1495
01:29:02,446 --> 01:29:04,917
Run, now we're free

1496
01:29:05,186 --> 01:29:06,686
MINWOOK is a great singer.

1497
01:29:07,186 --> 01:29:08,746
Has MINWOOK always been a great singer?

1498
01:29:09,016 --> 01:29:11,226
Make you like that, hands over head

1499
01:29:11,387 --> 01:29:13,456
What you want, Yes, we get it

1500
01:29:13,457 --> 01:29:15,096
(Impressed)

1501
01:29:15,097 --> 01:29:16,097
(Amazed)

1502
01:29:19,097 --> 01:29:20,766
They are good!

1503
01:29:21,467 --> 01:29:22,565
They're talented.

1504
01:29:22,566 --> 01:29:23,996
The team assembly is too good.

1505
01:29:23,997 --> 01:29:25,597
- Yes, it's too good. - In just one day?

1506
01:29:25,667 --> 01:29:27,305
You all did better than I thought.

1507
01:29:27,306 --> 01:29:29,236
Maybe they have their know-how now.

1508
01:29:29,476 --> 01:29:31,446
They have great teamwork.

1509
01:29:31,976 --> 01:29:36,177
When MINWOOK and KENSHIN teamed up,

1510
01:29:36,816 --> 01:29:37,945
I was very worried.

1511
01:29:37,946 --> 01:29:39,645
"These two will team up as a duo?"

1512
01:29:39,646 --> 01:29:42,206
I was actually very worried. But
when I saw their performance...

1513
01:29:42,516 --> 01:29:44,797
These two were a great team
when they performed together.

1514
01:29:44,887 --> 01:29:46,526
They were just like one team.

1515
01:29:46,787 --> 01:29:49,002
You two did a great job as a
duo. The performance was great.

1516
01:29:49,026 --> 01:29:51,765
The assembly is excellent. I
can't wait to see the final one.

1517
01:29:51,766 --> 01:29:53,765
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1518
01:29:53,766 --> 01:29:55,337
(Team Psycho got great feedback.)

1519
01:29:56,497 --> 01:29:57,497
Well done.

1520
01:29:57,606 --> 01:29:59,906
(They did well for the interim check.)

1521
01:30:00,806 --> 01:30:03,476
We still have to go through one big stage.

1522
01:30:04,037 --> 01:30:05,576
Let's just face it.

1523
01:30:05,577 --> 01:30:06,577
The song's highlight.

1524
01:30:06,578 --> 01:30:08,546
- Let's take a guess.
- It's going to be fun.

1525
01:30:08,547 --> 01:30:09,815
Which part do you think it would be?

1526
01:30:09,816 --> 01:30:12,145
Make you lose your mind

1527
01:30:12,146 --> 01:30:14,286
- Maybe that one. - No, it's my part.

1528
01:30:14,287 --> 01:30:16,167
- This part.
- Maybe it's KENSHIN's solo dance.

1529
01:30:16,316 --> 01:30:17,316
I mean it.

1530
01:30:17,887 --> 01:30:19,367
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

1531
01:30:20,957 --> 01:30:22,026
- This is it. - What?

1532
01:30:22,597 --> 01:30:24,895
- So this is the highlight.
- Yes, it's that part.

1533
01:30:24,896 --> 01:30:27,596
- You were right. - So it's that part.

1534
01:30:27,597 --> 01:30:28,736
(His prediction is correct.)

1535
01:30:31,467 --> 01:30:33,265
(Highlight)

1536
01:30:33,266 --> 01:30:34,266
(Screaming)

1537
01:30:34,267 --> 01:30:36,236
- Oh, no. - This is where I thought.

1538
01:30:36,377 --> 01:30:38,376
- I knew it was the highlight.
- It is cool, though.

1539
01:30:38,377 --> 01:30:42,677
(The highlight part)

1540
01:30:43,976 --> 01:30:44,986
This is it.

1541
01:30:47,217 --> 01:30:48,886
(Tormented)

1542
01:30:48,887 --> 01:30:51,327
This is where it can give chills.

1543
01:30:51,656 --> 01:30:55,656
I feel like this is where
it would excite the fans.

1544
01:30:55,896 --> 01:30:59,066
I think HYUNWOO will
do well with this part.

1545
01:30:59,766 --> 01:31:04,037
Luckily, the highlight
was where I could do well.

1546
01:31:04,196 --> 01:31:06,806
I think I can perform it well.
So I want to take this part.

1547
01:31:07,007 --> 01:31:08,677
I really want to take it.

1548
01:31:09,007 --> 01:31:10,876
- I wanted this part.
- You wanted this part?

1549
01:31:10,877 --> 01:31:13,547
I took the main rapper part
because I wanted this part.

1550
01:31:13,776 --> 01:31:14,945
- Really? - Because of this part?

1551
01:31:14,946 --> 01:31:16,015
Because of this part?

1552
01:31:16,016 --> 01:31:18,547
I wanted to do this
part. That's why I chose...

1553
01:31:18,787 --> 01:31:21,457
When I first saw the
"PSYCHO" performance...

1554
01:31:23,287 --> 01:31:24,886
(Who is it?)

1555
01:31:24,887 --> 01:31:26,486
(An all-rounder?)

1556
01:31:27,387 --> 01:31:29,997
(He was after the solo dance
part from the very beginning.)

1557
01:31:30,656 --> 01:31:34,766
I really want to take this part.

1558
01:31:35,837 --> 01:31:38,406
So I'm very anxious...

1559
01:31:40,366 --> 01:31:41,707
(Lying down)

1560
01:31:42,007 --> 01:31:43,207
SAKURADA KENSHIN.

1561
01:31:43,976 --> 01:31:45,047
You can do it.

1562
01:31:45,606 --> 01:31:46,606
Yes.

1563
01:31:47,776 --> 01:31:50,546
I've been memorizing the lyrics...

1564
01:31:50,547 --> 01:31:51,616
- Get... - Get...

1565
01:31:52,186 --> 01:31:54,685
(He has been doing his best
to pull off the main rapper part.)

1566
01:31:54,686 --> 01:31:57,616
I've been practicing the dance moves.

1567
01:31:57,986 --> 01:32:00,856
There's a chance that
someone else take the part.

1568
01:32:01,396 --> 01:32:05,066
I think you'll take the highlight.

1569
01:32:05,427 --> 01:32:06,497
I don't think so.

1570
01:32:06,927 --> 01:32:09,297
I think... Pork cutlet...

1571
01:32:10,736 --> 01:32:12,766
(Pork cutlet is confused.)

1572
01:32:14,137 --> 01:32:15,406
This part is really cool.

1573
01:32:17,177 --> 01:32:18,976
I really wanted to take this part.

1574
01:32:20,047 --> 01:32:22,417
Gosh, I'm in big trouble. I
have to practice really hard.

1575
01:32:23,377 --> 01:32:25,486
I could feel it...

1576
01:32:25,717 --> 01:32:27,417
when KENSHIN was upset.

1577
01:32:27,757 --> 01:32:30,257
I also wanted to do the highlight.

1578
01:32:31,056 --> 01:32:33,356
There would be competition within the team.

1579
01:32:33,986 --> 01:32:36,997
I realized, "This is a survival show."

1580
01:32:38,597 --> 01:32:40,695
If you want it

1581
01:32:40,696 --> 01:32:43,136
(Everyone's practicing his part...)

1582
01:32:43,137 --> 01:32:45,007
(after the highlight was revealed.)

1583
01:32:46,866 --> 01:32:49,406
(Thinking)

1584
01:32:50,736 --> 01:32:52,546
(As SEUNGHO resumes with his practice)

1585
01:32:52,547 --> 01:32:54,006
- With the new... - That's how you...

1586
01:32:54,007 --> 01:32:55,645
Here is my tip.

1587
01:32:55,646 --> 01:32:57,846
This is how you say it. "With the..."

1588
01:32:57,847 --> 01:32:59,716
But you accentuate the first word.

1589
01:32:59,717 --> 01:33:01,186
- Look. - The night full of...

1590
01:33:01,316 --> 01:33:02,586
- There you go. - With the new...

1591
01:33:02,587 --> 01:33:03,686
No, you sounded like...

1592
01:33:04,016 --> 01:33:07,186
We have to perform as a team.

1593
01:33:07,556 --> 01:33:09,927
If SEUNGHO can make his debut on this show,

1594
01:33:10,297 --> 01:33:12,866
he would be making his
debut with this performance.

1595
01:33:13,266 --> 01:33:15,736
Then he has to excel at this.

1596
01:33:16,967 --> 01:33:18,906
Can't you make it cooler?

1597
01:33:19,606 --> 01:33:20,707
- Like this. - JEONGMIN.

1598
01:33:21,337 --> 01:33:23,037
This is how you do it.

1599
01:33:23,507 --> 01:33:25,106
Do it the other way.

1600
01:33:26,247 --> 01:33:27,676
And you need to start with a ready pose.

1601
01:33:27,677 --> 01:33:29,816
You're just hitting it here.

1602
01:33:31,616 --> 01:33:32,786
- That's it. - I get it.

1603
01:33:32,787 --> 01:33:33,917
You got it now.

1604
01:33:34,787 --> 01:33:36,856
He and I are doing the final performance.

1605
01:33:37,257 --> 01:33:39,417
So I wanted to improve the
quality of his dance moves.

1606
01:33:40,587 --> 01:33:41,695
Just once...

1607
01:33:41,696 --> 01:33:44,096
(The reason why he takes great
care of Trainee SONG SEUNGHO)

1608
01:33:44,356 --> 01:33:48,336
JEONGMIN saved my life
as a trainee at the agency...

1609
01:33:48,337 --> 01:33:51,406
even when I was not talented at all.

1610
01:33:52,167 --> 01:33:54,536
I can tell you this for sure.

1611
01:33:54,537 --> 01:33:55,707
I helped him from scratch.

1612
01:33:56,207 --> 01:33:58,146
I'm sure SEUNGHO will agree.

1613
01:33:58,547 --> 01:34:01,917
We met when we were 17. Now we turned 18.

1614
01:34:02,047 --> 01:34:04,917
We're about to turn 19 soon.

1615
01:34:05,616 --> 01:34:06,936
We've been friends for two years.

1616
01:34:08,356 --> 01:34:09,916
I've been teaching him
the dance moves every time.

1617
01:34:09,917 --> 01:34:12,077
I've been helping him with
the basic dance moves also.

1618
01:34:12,186 --> 01:34:16,127
He was more like a savior.

1619
01:34:17,927 --> 01:34:19,565
We joined the show together,

1620
01:34:19,566 --> 01:34:23,235
but if I get to make a debut
alone with my ranking going up...

1621
01:34:23,236 --> 01:34:25,636
(Trainee SONG SEUNGHO made
it to the debut team by himself.)

1622
01:34:26,037 --> 01:34:29,577
Honestly, I feel insecure without him.

1623
01:34:31,646 --> 01:34:33,406
This is how I feel.

1624
01:34:34,077 --> 01:34:35,577
This is the Final Match.

1625
01:34:36,047 --> 01:34:39,316
This is the final stage for
both SEUNGHO and me.

1626
01:34:39,747 --> 01:34:41,456
As in, practicing together...

1627
01:34:41,457 --> 01:34:43,856
and living together as trainees.

1628
01:34:45,887 --> 01:34:46,927
Oh, no!

1629
01:34:49,226 --> 01:34:50,257
Hold on.

1630
01:34:51,097 --> 01:34:52,496
This will be aired for sure.

1631
01:34:52,497 --> 01:34:54,967
No! SEUNGHO shouldn't see this.

1632
01:34:57,667 --> 01:34:59,507
Here's why I cried during the interview.

1633
01:35:00,406 --> 01:35:01,537
I felt like...

1634
01:35:03,306 --> 01:35:05,806
it was our last time to
practice as trainees here.

1635
01:35:07,507 --> 01:35:09,227
Do you want me to share one more fun story?

1636
01:35:09,976 --> 01:35:12,445
I couldn't sleep well...

1637
01:35:12,446 --> 01:35:13,787
when I first joined the show.

1638
01:35:14,146 --> 01:35:16,216
You and your friends...

1639
01:35:16,217 --> 01:35:17,416
(They started together
at the same starting point.)

1640
01:35:17,417 --> 01:35:19,127
Your popularity went up so fast.

1641
01:35:20,026 --> 01:35:21,296
So I was really envious.

1642
01:35:21,297 --> 01:35:22,426
(He couldn't sleep
well as he felt anxious.)

1643
01:35:22,427 --> 01:35:25,297
I was waiting until I had more fans.

1644
01:35:26,226 --> 01:35:27,667
You have a lot of fans now.

1645
01:35:28,797 --> 01:35:29,967
So I'm happy!

1646
01:35:30,236 --> 01:35:33,167
I achieved a big goal after a long time.

1647
01:35:34,207 --> 01:35:37,406
When I first made it to the Top Seven,

1648
01:35:38,146 --> 01:35:42,646
the first thing that
worried me was my skills.

1649
01:35:43,547 --> 01:35:45,516
"If I really get to debut,"

1650
01:35:46,287 --> 01:35:49,116
"I don't think I can survive
with my skills. I'm in trouble."

1651
01:35:49,417 --> 01:35:50,655
- This is what I thought. - So...

1652
01:35:50,656 --> 01:35:53,457
This is how I really feel.

1653
01:35:54,656 --> 01:35:56,497
I feel like you'll really debut now.

1654
01:35:57,927 --> 01:35:59,565
I'm so grateful to this
show that I could help...

1655
01:35:59,566 --> 01:36:01,167
with your final performance.

1656
01:36:02,266 --> 01:36:03,706
I'm actually realizing my dream now.

1657
01:36:04,066 --> 01:36:05,936
I've always wanted to perform with you.

1658
01:36:06,207 --> 01:36:08,707
- We're finally performing together.
- In such a huge stadium.

1659
01:36:09,877 --> 01:36:12,406
We're putting on the biggest
performance together in the end.

1660
01:36:13,247 --> 01:36:17,677
We might not be able to
practice together anymore.

1661
01:36:18,616 --> 01:36:21,247
I wanted to do the last
performance well with JEONGMIN.

1662
01:36:21,787 --> 01:36:23,686
It would be nice if I
could make a debut here.

1663
01:36:24,417 --> 01:36:28,427
But I have to say goodbye to my team.

1664
01:36:28,927 --> 01:36:33,327
This situation has been
bugging me in my head.

1665
01:36:33,997 --> 01:36:36,967
We thought we would be
together. But one of us has to leave.

1666
01:36:37,566 --> 01:36:38,866
It would make me feel empty.

1667
01:36:39,637 --> 01:36:44,507
However, we got this chance
to perform our final performance.

1668
01:36:44,747 --> 01:36:46,677
I really want to make it exciting.

1669
01:36:47,077 --> 01:36:50,217
Since we're at it already,
I want to leave no regrets.

1670
01:36:50,677 --> 01:36:52,287
I'll do my best with what I can.

1671
01:36:53,717 --> 01:36:55,555
- Hold on. This isn't right.
- This is not the one.

1672
01:36:55,556 --> 01:36:56,587
We have to do this...

1673
01:36:57,116 --> 01:37:00,787
I wish we could do more
than just this performance.

1674
01:37:01,026 --> 01:37:03,096
I wish we could perform together...

1675
01:37:03,097 --> 01:37:05,126
for many other occasions.

1676
01:37:05,127 --> 01:37:07,866
But I know it's hard to do that.

1677
01:37:08,766 --> 01:37:10,396
He keeps smiling at me.

1678
01:37:10,866 --> 01:37:12,007
He smiled at me too.

1679
01:37:12,167 --> 01:37:15,276
Since the Final Match
could be the last performance,

1680
01:37:15,306 --> 01:37:17,336
I thought not only the
outcome but also the process...

1681
01:37:17,337 --> 01:37:20,547
should be beautiful when we look back.

1682
01:37:22,476 --> 01:37:24,946
If we feel happy at every moment together,

1683
01:37:25,186 --> 01:37:28,356
it will make the
competition better in the end.

1684
01:37:28,957 --> 01:37:30,015
That's great!

1685
01:37:30,016 --> 01:37:31,485
(The day of filming the song's highlight)

1686
01:37:31,486 --> 01:37:32,656
The last one.

1687
01:37:33,787 --> 01:37:36,555
Hello, I'm Trainee SONG
SEUNGHO of Team "PSYCHO."

1688
01:37:36,556 --> 01:37:38,966
I'll try the song's highlight.

1689
01:37:38,967 --> 01:37:41,797
(Who will take the song's highlight?)

1690
01:37:45,606 --> 01:37:47,265
JEON MINWOOK!

1691
01:37:47,266 --> 01:37:49,806
- KENSHIN, go for it! - JEON MINWOOK!

1692
01:38:26,747 --> 01:38:28,146
KIM JEONGMIN!

1693
01:38:34,986 --> 01:38:36,116
KIM JEONGMIN!

1694
01:38:39,427 --> 01:38:42,656
(KENSHIN, MINWOOK)

1695
01:38:42,696 --> 01:38:44,927

(SAKURADA KENSHIN)

1704
01:42:32,026 --> 01:42:34,686
The last new song of the Final Match,

1705
01:42:35,856 --> 01:42:38,156
"PSYCHO" was prepared...

1706
01:42:38,927 --> 01:42:40,667
by seven trainees,

1707
01:42:41,526 --> 01:42:42,896
and they finished the performance.

1708
01:42:44,097 --> 01:42:46,707
I could feel the trainees' attitude...

1709
01:42:46,967 --> 01:42:49,706
that's intense and confident.

1710
01:42:49,707 --> 01:42:50,976
(YEOJUN did the greatest job.)

1711
01:42:52,577 --> 01:42:54,276
The World Assemblers selected...

1712
01:42:54,976 --> 01:42:58,516
the one who performed
the highlight of "PSYCHO."

1713
01:43:00,316 --> 01:43:03,055
It was KIM HYUNWOO.

1714
01:43:03,056 --> 01:43:07,555
(KIM HYUNWOO performed
the highlight of "PSYCHO.")

1715

(KIM HYUNWOO, GOAT)

1716

Director RyuD created the
choreography of "PSYCHO."

- Yes. - Director RyuD.

1718
01:43:20,606 --> 01:43:23,137
Do you think the trainees
completed the performance well?

1719
01:43:24,337 --> 01:43:26,677
First of all,

1720
01:43:26,776 --> 01:43:29,047
on Christmas Eve, we, all men, gathered...

1721
01:43:29,247 --> 01:43:32,347
and practiced all day long.

1722
01:43:32,747 --> 01:43:36,417
I was in charge of
upgrading the performance,

1723
01:43:36,787 --> 01:43:40,087
so my focus was on making an
awesome performance, no matter what.

1724
01:43:40,427 --> 01:43:43,056
For Team "PSYCHO," without a worry,

1725
01:43:43,396 --> 01:43:46,327
I could enjoy preparing
for the performance.

1726
01:43:46,766 --> 01:43:49,065
They're such nice people.

1727
01:43:49,066 --> 01:43:51,537
They have great teamwork,

1728
01:43:51,766 --> 01:43:53,667
and they gave a wonderful performance.

1729
01:43:53,967 --> 01:43:56,507
I'm so proud of them and
I feel thankful for them.

1730
01:43:57,306 --> 01:43:58,446
I loved it.

(KENSHIN, KIM HYUNWOO)

1732
01:44:04,476 --> 01:44:06,216
Director Ryan Sewon Jhun,

1733
01:44:06,217 --> 01:44:09,387
please tell us what you
think about the performance.

1734
01:44:09,717 --> 01:44:10,986
This is...

1735
01:44:11,757 --> 01:44:14,427
not a performance of music, I thought.

1736
01:44:14,787 --> 01:44:18,196
I thought it was a performance of art.

1737
01:44:20,097 --> 01:44:22,365
That's because...

1738
01:44:22,366 --> 01:44:25,337
if you look at it from the
beginning to the end of the music,

1739
01:44:26,007 --> 01:44:29,137
it has a complicated organization.

1740
01:44:29,406 --> 01:44:30,726
The song needs a lot of practice.

1741
01:44:31,236 --> 01:44:34,077
Of course, the other two
teams were also great.

1742
01:44:34,906 --> 01:44:38,616
I think this is a song that
requires a lot of practice.

1743
01:44:39,486 --> 01:44:41,216
But it was amazing.

1744
01:44:41,217 --> 01:44:43,387
Oh, my. They're awesome. You're the best.

1745
01:44:43,717 --> 01:44:44,856
You did a good job.

1747
01:44:55,797 --> 01:44:57,236

1748
01:44:58,236 --> 01:45:00,936
until the voting closes.

1749
01:45:01,236 --> 01:45:03,735

01:45:19,686 --> 01:45:22,056
who hasn't participated
in real-time global voting,

1755
01:45:22,457 --> 01:45:26,896
you can cast your valuable vote...

1756
01:45:27,066 --> 01:45:29,936
for the trainees you support.

1757
01:45:31,436 --> 01:45:34,606
Please support the trainees' dream...

1758
01:45:35,207 --> 01:45:36,606
to the end.

1759
01:45:37,677 --> 01:45:39,377
(HAJOON)

1760
01:45:40,747 --> 01:45:42,077
(YEOJUN, you were the best.)

1761
01:45:44,217 --> 01:45:47,216
While World Assemblers...

1762
01:45:47,217 --> 01:45:48,957
cast the last vote,

1763
01:45:49,186 --> 01:45:52,257
we can watch a video.

1764
01:45:55,356 --> 01:45:58,226
The 21 trainees...

1765
01:45:58,866 --> 01:46:00,866
received special gifts.

1766
01:46:03,167 --> 01:46:07,366
Let's watch the video now.

1767
01:46:13,606 --> 01:46:16,077
(Project Village in snow)

1768
01:46:17,677 --> 01:46:19,416
(In Project Village, )

1769
01:46:19,417 --> 01:46:21,216
I'm having Christmas with PROJECT 7.

1770
01:46:21,217 --> 01:46:23,056
(Christmas has come.)

1771
01:46:27,757 --> 01:46:29,473
Let's write, "Realizing
the dream of debut."

1772
01:46:29,497 --> 01:46:31,396
- Debut. - Is it "b?"

1773
01:46:33,327 --> 01:46:35,567
(My wish is to debut and win
1st place on a music show.)

1774
01:46:35,967 --> 01:46:37,496
- Or... - Yes, a wish.

1775
01:46:37,497 --> 01:46:39,736
(Trainees wrote letters with their wishes.)

1776
01:46:39,766 --> 01:46:41,782
(I wish my parents and the people
I love stay healthy and happy.)

1777
01:46:41,806 --> 01:46:43,637
(My wish is to make a debut!)

1778
01:46:44,137 --> 01:46:45,946
I can't reach it.

1779
01:46:49,616 --> 01:46:50,816
It hurts.

1780
01:46:51,016 --> 01:46:52,087
You managed it.

1781
01:46:52,787 --> 01:46:54,115
(They're excited to decorate
the Christmas tree together.)

1782
01:46:54,116 --> 01:46:55,492
It's been a while since I decorated a tree.

1783
01:46:55,516 --> 01:46:57,316
I did it when I was very little.

1784
01:46:57,556 --> 01:46:58,957
How do you hang this?

1785
01:47:01,186 --> 01:47:02,656
(Putting on a ribbon)

1786
01:47:04,257 --> 01:47:05,627
A ribbon doesn't go with you.

1787
01:47:05,797 --> 01:47:07,365
(My wish)

1788
01:47:07,366 --> 01:47:10,236
(Hoping everyone's wishes come true)

1789
01:47:11,097 --> 01:47:13,805
- It's beautiful.
- I need to take a proof shot here.

1790
01:47:13,806 --> 01:47:15,446
(The tree 21 trainees decorated together)

1791
01:47:20,906 --> 01:47:23,417
(Under the tree, that night)

1792
01:47:24,016 --> 01:47:25,146
- What's that? - Oh, my.

1793
01:47:25,417 --> 01:47:26,546
We have gifts.

1794
01:47:26,547 --> 01:47:29,756
- I guess Santa Claus visited us.
- It was Santa!

1795
01:47:29,757 --> 01:47:31,416
- It was Santa! - Santa Claus?

1796
01:47:31,417 --> 01:47:32,486
What's inside?

1797
01:47:32,986 --> 01:47:34,586
Each has a name on it.

1798
01:47:34,587 --> 01:47:36,025
- That's amazing. - It's true.

1799
01:47:36,026 --> 01:47:37,257
- It's a real gift. - Really?

1800
01:47:37,356 --> 01:47:38,626
- What's in it? - It's heavy.

1801
01:47:38,627 --> 01:47:39,896
That's true.

1802
01:47:40,097 --> 01:47:42,196
- This is mine. - KENSHIN.

1803
01:47:42,696 --> 01:47:44,137
How come he has such a big one?

1804
01:47:44,936 --> 01:47:46,242
- It's also heavy. - Not every big gift...

1805
01:47:46,266 --> 01:47:47,736
is expensive, right?

1806
01:47:47,866 --> 01:47:48,906
Shake it.

1807
01:47:49,406 --> 01:47:51,235
I envy you. You got a big one.

1808
01:47:51,236 --> 01:47:53,076
- Thank you! - Thank you!

1809
01:47:53,077 --> 01:47:55,077
(What are the gifts arrived for trainees?)

1810
01:47:55,677 --> 01:47:57,315
I'm most curious about JUNWON's gift.

1811
01:47:57,316 --> 01:47:58,547
Let's open it first.

1812
01:47:58,917 --> 01:48:00,717
- We should open this last. - No.

1813
01:48:02,957 --> 01:48:05,316
- Stop it. - I can't see it.

1814
01:48:05,787 --> 01:48:06,987
- I can't see any. - LYNNLYNN.

1815
01:48:07,026 --> 01:48:09,555
I think it's NCT's album.

1816
01:48:09,556 --> 01:48:11,696
- An album. - It must be expensive.

1817
01:48:14,196 --> 01:48:17,136
I think, since it's in the box,

1818
01:48:17,137 --> 01:48:18,637
- it's a book. - A book?

1819
01:48:18,837 --> 01:48:21,606
- I like comics.
- Right, you read comics a lot.

1820
01:48:22,606 --> 01:48:23,677
What could be this?

1821
01:48:24,106 --> 01:48:25,276
What's inside?

1822
01:48:25,646 --> 01:48:28,306
I think it must be a
department store certificate.

1823
01:48:28,547 --> 01:48:30,646
- I think it's a candy. See?
- He's guessing.

1824
01:48:31,446 --> 01:48:32,685
It's a candy.

1825
01:48:32,686 --> 01:48:34,967
- I hear the sound of a can.
- Something like star candy.

1826
01:48:35,587 --> 01:48:37,387
I think it's something like cookies.

1827
01:48:37,787 --> 01:48:40,986
As I see SEYUN's gift is
the most nicely wrapped.

1828
01:48:41,186 --> 01:48:42,326
I'm curious.

1829
01:48:42,327 --> 01:48:44,396
- SEYUN's gift is wrapped nicely. - Right.

1830
01:48:44,927 --> 01:48:46,365
- Shoes? - Shoes.

1831
01:48:46,366 --> 01:48:47,765
- No. - What is it?

1832
01:48:47,766 --> 01:48:49,637
- Chocolate? - Shoes?

1833
01:48:50,167 --> 01:48:51,696
It's a snack.

1834
01:48:52,037 --> 01:48:53,566
It's a snack.

1835
01:48:53,637 --> 01:48:57,037
(JUNG SEYUN's gift is a snack.)

1836
01:48:59,207 --> 01:49:00,577
- What is it? - There's a letter.

1837
01:49:00,707 --> 01:49:02,646
- What is it? - There's a letter.

1838
01:49:02,847 --> 01:49:04,316
- What is it? - There's a letter.

1839
01:49:04,847 --> 01:49:06,886
What is it?

1840
01:49:06,887 --> 01:49:07,887
Seriously.

1841
01:49:07,888 --> 01:49:09,786
Why? What is it?

1842
01:49:09,787 --> 01:49:11,555
(Trainee JUNG SEYUN suddenly sheds tears.)

1843
01:49:11,556 --> 01:49:13,226
- JUNG SEYUN. - What is it?

1844
01:49:19,427 --> 01:49:20,596
Is there a letter too?

1845
01:49:20,597 --> 01:49:22,195
Seriously.

1846
01:49:22,196 --> 01:49:24,337
- I feel like tearing up. - No.

1847
01:49:26,467 --> 01:49:27,606
Hello, SEYUN.

1848
01:49:28,106 --> 01:49:30,436
It's Mom. I guess you're surprised.

1849
01:49:31,137 --> 01:49:32,377
Did your mom send it?

1850
01:49:32,747 --> 01:49:33,877
His mom?

1851
01:49:34,806 --> 01:49:36,676
In 1, 2, 3.

1852
01:49:36,677 --> 01:49:38,037
(Meanwhile, Team "PSYCHO" also...)

1853
01:49:38,887 --> 01:49:40,316
It's a snack set.

1854
01:49:40,587 --> 01:49:41,716
It's snacks.

1855
01:49:41,717 --> 01:49:43,156
- It's a snack set. - It's snacks.

1856
01:49:43,486 --> 01:49:44,586
It's really snacks.

1857
01:49:44,587 --> 01:49:46,086
- It's really snacks.
- Is it a toy for a puppy?

1858
01:49:46,087 --> 01:49:47,986
- Wait, this is.. - What's that?

1859
01:49:48,757 --> 01:49:49,796
What's this?

1860
01:49:49,797 --> 01:49:51,437
(A dog toy in Trainee KIM HYUNWOO's gift)

1861
01:49:51,597 --> 01:49:53,627
It's what my dog plays with.

1862
01:49:54,026 --> 01:49:55,566
Is it sent by your parents?

1863
01:49:57,797 --> 01:49:59,507
Seriously, this is what they're doing?

1864
01:50:04,037 --> 01:50:05,276
It's a volleyball.

1865
01:50:05,547 --> 01:50:06,646
A volleyball?

1866
01:50:09,616 --> 01:50:12,787
(Christmas gifts from trainees' families)

1867
01:50:13,917 --> 01:50:15,556
My son, you must be having a hard time.

1868
01:50:16,056 --> 01:50:17,315
I worried about you a lot,

1869
01:50:17,316 --> 01:50:20,656
but I'm so relieved that
you seem to be doing great.

1870
01:50:21,457 --> 01:50:24,127
It's already been over three
years since you became a trainee.

1871
01:50:25,156 --> 01:50:28,565
You and I once had a conflict
and resented each other,

1872
01:50:28,566 --> 01:50:31,736
but I don't think it was a waste.

1873
01:50:33,236 --> 01:50:36,306
You shed sweat and tears in sadness.

1874
01:50:36,776 --> 01:50:38,946
I know that more than anyone in the world.

1875
01:50:39,776 --> 01:50:40,806
You...

1876
01:50:41,877 --> 01:50:42,946
You...

1877
01:50:45,816 --> 01:50:47,247
As you're away from home,

1878
01:50:47,587 --> 01:50:50,486
it makes me only think of
how I made you feel sorry.

1879
01:50:51,056 --> 01:50:52,655
Dear my youngest boy SEYUN,

1880
01:50:52,656 --> 01:50:54,127
you've been through a lot.

1881
01:50:54,686 --> 01:50:56,726
I love you, my boy. You can do it, SEYUN!

1882
01:51:07,806 --> 01:51:09,507
I miss Mom so much.

1883
01:51:12,707 --> 01:51:15,917
This is my favorite snack.

1884
01:51:16,116 --> 01:51:17,116
I see.

1885
01:51:17,377 --> 01:51:20,446
Seeing it in the box, I
knew my mom sent it.

1886
01:51:21,717 --> 01:51:24,686
But I was so charged with emotion...

1887
01:51:29,757 --> 01:51:31,856
My baby SEUNGHO, it must be tough for you.

1888
01:51:43,137 --> 01:51:44,837
I thought you were still too young,

1889
01:51:45,377 --> 01:51:46,406
but seeing you on TV...

1890
01:51:47,677 --> 01:51:50,646
But seeing you on TV, I feel proud.

1891
01:51:51,547 --> 01:51:53,716
You're praiseworthy, and
I also feel sorry for you.

1892
01:51:53,717 --> 01:51:58,756
(I haven't done much for you, and
I thought you were still too young.)

1893
01:51:58,757 --> 01:52:03,655
(But seeing you on TV, I feel
proud. You're praiseworthy, )

1894
01:52:03,656 --> 01:52:08,327
(and I also feel sorry for you.)

1895
01:52:09,866 --> 01:52:10,966
I hope...

1896
01:52:10,967 --> 01:52:14,265
(I hope your effort leads to happiness.)

1897
01:52:14,266 --> 01:52:16,305
your effort leads...

1898
01:52:16,306 --> 01:52:21,805
(I hope your effort leads to happiness.)

1899
01:52:21,806 --> 01:52:27,387
(I hope your effort leads to happiness.)

1900
01:52:30,387 --> 01:52:33,156
I remembered that I
complained since I was tired...

1901
01:52:34,087 --> 01:52:36,327
and argued with my mom sometimes.

1902
01:52:40,967 --> 01:52:44,597
KENSHIN, you had a cute
smile since you were little.

1903
01:52:44,866 --> 01:52:47,036
You were a child everyone loved...

1904
01:52:47,037 --> 01:52:48,736
and you made everyone happy.

1905
01:52:50,507 --> 01:52:54,207
You went to Korea alone,
where a different language is used.

1906
01:53:00,087 --> 01:53:04,015
When I first saw you dancing...

1907
01:53:04,016 --> 01:53:06,927
as the center for the
title song of PROJECT 7,

1908
01:53:10,026 --> 01:53:12,725
I was so happy that I
shed a flood of tears.

1909
01:53:12,726 --> 01:53:14,896
(I was so happy that I
shed a flood of tears.)

1910
01:53:16,436 --> 01:53:19,736
I cheer for you with all my
heart. You can do it, KENSHIN.

1911
01:53:19,806 --> 01:53:21,066
From your mom and dad.

1912
01:53:35,816 --> 01:53:38,886
It doesn't match JUNSEO's concept at all.

1913
01:53:38,887 --> 01:53:40,855
- That's it. - What on earth...

1914
01:53:40,856 --> 01:53:42,257
What on earth is this?

1915
01:53:43,957 --> 01:53:46,827
(Trainee PARK JUNSEO's
gift is a teddy bear and a letter.)

1916
01:53:47,297 --> 01:53:48,766
Dear my boy.

1917
01:53:49,297 --> 01:53:51,167
Are you doing all right?

1918
01:53:52,667 --> 01:53:55,935
You must be tired physically and
mentally being in an audition show,

1919
01:53:55,936 --> 01:53:57,877
but you always have a bright look,

1920
01:54:00,976 --> 01:54:04,015
think positively, and do a good job.

1921
01:54:04,016 --> 01:54:06,146
I'm so proud of you, son.

1922
01:54:08,917 --> 01:54:13,427
I'm so thankful that you came to me.

1923
01:54:17,356 --> 01:54:19,167
Happy birthday, son.

1924
01:54:20,467 --> 01:54:22,695
And what I sent to you is a teddy bear...

1925
01:54:22,696 --> 01:54:24,766
to celebrate your birthday
on behalf of the family.

1926
01:54:25,806 --> 01:54:27,007
What's this?

1927
01:54:27,537 --> 01:54:29,106
This isn't even working.

1928
01:54:29,537 --> 01:54:30,707
Gosh, it surprised me.

1929
01:54:31,976 --> 01:54:34,975
(The teddy bear celebrates his
birthday on behalf of his family.)

1930
01:54:34,976 --> 01:54:36,247
She got a great gift for you.

1931
01:54:39,446 --> 01:54:41,985
- For me, - Happy birthday to you

1932
01:54:41,986 --> 01:54:42,986
it was encouraging.

1933
01:54:42,987 --> 01:54:45,655
Happy birthday, dear friend

1934
01:54:45,656 --> 01:54:48,127
(His mom's gift stopped his tears.)

1935
01:54:48,486 --> 01:54:50,427
(Next, Trainee YICHEN opens his present.)

1936
01:54:50,757 --> 01:54:52,056
I guess it's a video.

1937
01:54:52,797 --> 01:54:54,797
It's my grandmother.

1938
01:54:57,337 --> 01:54:58,837
Did my grandmother film it?

1939
01:55:00,266 --> 01:55:02,537
Hello, dear YICHEN. It's your grandmother.

1940
01:55:04,707 --> 01:55:06,747
- It's my grandmother. - How are you?

1941
01:55:08,146 --> 01:55:09,577
My grandmother...

1942
01:55:10,476 --> 01:55:12,516
is Ahn Myung Geun's granddaughter.

1943
01:55:13,047 --> 01:55:16,616
She's almost over 80 years old now.

1944
01:55:17,587 --> 01:55:19,356
I miss you so much,

1945
01:55:20,056 --> 01:55:21,936
and I'm so glad that I
can see you on the show.

1946
01:55:22,387 --> 01:55:25,997
I loved to see you sing and
dance since you were little.

1947
01:55:27,266 --> 01:55:29,797
I hope you take good care of your health.

1948
01:55:30,537 --> 01:55:34,566
I always cheer for you with a glad heart.

1949
01:55:38,837 --> 01:55:42,646
My grandmother filmed
the video like this for me.

1950
01:55:44,417 --> 01:55:46,186
I hope you stay healthy for a long time,

1951
01:55:46,646 --> 01:55:49,686
and I'll go home soon to see you.

1952
01:55:51,717 --> 01:55:53,856
- BINGHUA? - It's BINGHUA's turn.

1953
01:55:54,127 --> 01:55:55,355
- Let's go. - Wait a minute.

1954
01:55:55,356 --> 01:55:56,696
I need to get my heart ready.

1955
01:55:57,627 --> 01:55:58,696
You're right.

1956
01:55:58,997 --> 01:56:00,866
Did they send a video message?

1957
01:56:01,327 --> 01:56:02,467
Is it a video message?

1958
01:56:03,137 --> 01:56:06,707
I hope the path you walk
for your dream to shine.

1959
01:56:07,106 --> 01:56:11,236
BINGHUA, if you have a dream, run to it.

1960
01:56:11,306 --> 01:56:13,906
Have courage, find your dream,
and enjoy your performance.

1961
01:56:14,906 --> 01:56:17,276
We'll cheer for you forever. You can do it!

1962
01:56:22,516 --> 01:56:24,156
(Is he crying?)

1963
01:56:25,257 --> 01:56:27,156
(Is he not crying?)

1964
01:56:27,587 --> 01:56:29,226
Now, is he laughing or crying?

1965
01:56:29,597 --> 01:56:30,797
He scares me.

1966
01:56:34,927 --> 01:56:36,336
I mean,

1967
01:56:36,337 --> 01:56:40,667
I mean, I've never heard them saying...

1968
01:56:40,736 --> 01:56:43,077
something like this.

1969
01:56:43,736 --> 01:56:46,876
I guess filming the video
made them say that way.

1970
01:56:46,877 --> 01:56:49,676
(Everyone looks so nervous.)

1971
01:56:49,677 --> 01:56:51,877
In fact, it's kind of funny.

1972
01:56:52,917 --> 01:56:54,416
(Trainee BINGHUA's
family gave him a laugh.)

1973
01:56:54,417 --> 01:56:58,186
I'm going to be on the
final stage after the practice.

1974
01:56:58,457 --> 01:57:01,156
With the cheer from my parents,

1975
01:57:01,287 --> 01:57:04,356
I got more confident to
move on to the next level.

1976
01:57:04,927 --> 01:57:07,467
I think I can really work harder.

1977
01:57:08,297 --> 01:57:10,337
I'll do my best not to disappoint them...

1978
01:57:10,566 --> 01:57:12,566
and make them feel proud of me.

1979
01:57:13,837 --> 01:57:15,507
Dear my SUNGMIN.

1980
01:57:16,177 --> 01:57:19,106
I guess you must be tired
from practice these days.

1981
01:57:19,306 --> 01:57:21,706
There's nothing I can do for
you except for sending support.

1982
01:57:22,047 --> 01:57:23,716
Since you've been doing all right,

1983
01:57:23,717 --> 01:57:25,847
you'll bear a fruit as much as your effort.

1984
01:57:26,116 --> 01:57:28,485
Seeing my son putting
in effort and growing up,

1985
01:57:28,486 --> 01:57:31,916
I'm worried that it must be tiring,

1986
01:57:31,917 --> 01:57:34,457
but I also feel proud of you.

1987
01:57:36,356 --> 01:57:39,396
However, when we see you putting
effort with passion day and night...

1988
01:57:40,026 --> 01:57:43,667
for your dream to be an idol singer,

1989
01:57:44,597 --> 01:57:47,565
we always feel sorry that we
can't give you more things for you,

1990
01:57:47,566 --> 01:57:50,806
and we still feel sorry
now as your parents,

1991
01:57:58,077 --> 01:58:00,686
You only have a little time
left there. With your colleagues,

1992
01:58:10,726 --> 01:58:11,797
we hope you give a fun...

1993
01:58:13,526 --> 01:58:15,726
and nice performance.

1994
01:58:18,597 --> 01:58:22,566
I'll say one thing that made
me upset watching the show.

1995
01:58:26,976 --> 01:58:30,347
You never say "I love you" to your parents,

1996
01:58:30,747 --> 01:58:33,347
but you said it to YONGHYUN.

1997
01:58:34,717 --> 01:58:36,116
(YONGHYUN, I love you.)

1998
01:58:36,856 --> 01:58:39,386
(The expression of affection
made his parents get jealous.)

1999
01:58:39,387 --> 01:58:40,486
You made us upset.

2000
01:58:40,957 --> 01:58:44,395
Still, you're our favorite forever, JIWOON.

2001
01:58:44,396 --> 01:58:46,196
We love you so much.

2002
01:58:46,396 --> 01:58:47,967
Your mom and dad.

2003
01:58:49,026 --> 01:58:51,766
I never said I love you,

2004
01:58:52,866 --> 01:58:53,935
but I love you.

2005
01:58:53,936 --> 01:58:54,967
(Embarrassed)

2006
01:58:55,667 --> 01:58:59,177
If I have time after this performance,

2007
01:58:59,406 --> 01:59:02,076
I'll go home and hug you tight.

2008
01:59:02,077 --> 01:59:03,217
I love you, Mom.

2009
01:59:05,717 --> 01:59:08,347
It's almost been over ten years.

2010
01:59:08,946 --> 01:59:11,457
Look at that. His mom
put so much sincerity.

2011
01:59:11,656 --> 01:59:12,786
How come it's so long?

2012
01:59:12,787 --> 01:59:14,155
(Dear my MINWOOK)

2013
01:59:14,156 --> 01:59:15,185
Oh, my.

2014
01:59:15,186 --> 01:59:17,225
Wait, this won't be easy.

2015
01:59:17,226 --> 01:59:19,026
(His mom sent him a three-page letter.)

2016
01:59:20,696 --> 01:59:22,997
Dear MINWOOK my sweetie,

2017
01:59:24,266 --> 01:59:27,037
I guess it's my first time...

2018
01:59:27,406 --> 01:59:29,306
to send you a handwritten letter.

2019
01:59:30,906 --> 01:59:34,207
My precious son MINWOOK.

2020
01:59:35,177 --> 01:59:38,816
You were a bit picky and sensitive.

2021
01:59:39,446 --> 01:59:42,485
You were beautiful,
good-looking, cute, and smart...

2022
01:59:42,486 --> 01:59:44,056
since you were little.

2023
01:59:45,356 --> 01:59:47,655
And when you were a 12th
grader, you suddenly said...

2024
01:59:47,656 --> 01:59:50,327
you wanted to be a rapper,
and that surprised me a lot.

2025
01:59:51,457 --> 01:59:54,266
I thought you'd do what
you want without a regret,

2026
01:59:54,396 --> 01:59:56,065
and after three years,
after you serve in the army,

2027
01:59:56,066 --> 01:59:58,936
you'd find your career.

2028
01:59:59,537 --> 02:00:02,775
But you were so busy
and diligent practicing,

2029
02:00:02,776 --> 02:00:05,236
working part-time, and having auditions.

2030
02:00:17,457 --> 02:00:20,387
If I had supported you more back then,

2031
02:00:20,986 --> 02:00:24,355
the path you're walking on now...

2032
02:00:24,356 --> 02:00:28,666
(If I had supported you more back then)

2033
02:00:28,667 --> 02:00:30,297
must have been easier for you.

2034
02:00:31,837 --> 02:00:32,866
Because I...

2035
02:00:34,066 --> 02:00:35,405
Because I was ignorant,

2036
02:00:35,406 --> 02:00:42,305
(I was ignorant that you
went through more difficulties.)

2037
02:00:42,306 --> 02:00:44,516
you went through more difficulties.

2038
02:00:45,677 --> 02:00:47,685
I didn't know how to help you...

2039
02:00:47,686 --> 02:00:50,556
(I didn't know how to help you.)

2040
02:01:00,266 --> 02:01:02,997
except for watching and waiting.

2041
02:01:04,936 --> 02:01:05,966
MINWOOK.

2042
02:01:05,967 --> 02:01:08,637
You've been working hard every moment,

2043
02:01:09,236 --> 02:01:13,207
and you always made me proud.

2044
02:01:15,776 --> 02:01:17,917
I love you. Hang in there, my boy.

2045
02:01:18,217 --> 02:01:19,377
Everything will be all right.

2046
02:01:24,917 --> 02:01:25,917
Right.

2047
02:01:28,127 --> 02:01:31,457
It's been a while since I cried this much.

2048
02:01:33,427 --> 02:01:36,366
I want to stop my mom
from feeling sorry for me.

2049
02:01:37,066 --> 02:01:38,236
"I want to find..."

2050
02:01:39,337 --> 02:01:40,806
"success..."

2051
02:01:41,837 --> 02:01:45,637
"and make my mom
happy." I had that thought.

2052
02:01:47,276 --> 02:01:49,446
Despite the difficult times,

2053
02:01:50,217 --> 02:01:52,145
you've worked diligently until today.

2054
02:01:52,146 --> 02:01:55,146
All of us are proud of you, ANDY.

2055
02:01:55,787 --> 02:01:59,116
Do you remember when you
first went to Korea to practice?

2056
02:01:59,417 --> 02:02:05,396
To be honest, I cried secretly
every time I answered your call.

2057
02:02:05,927 --> 02:02:08,797
Adhere to the Korean rules.

2058
02:02:09,667 --> 02:02:11,936
Work and live upright.

2059
02:02:13,137 --> 02:02:16,336
Don't touch anything dangerous.

2060
02:02:16,337 --> 02:02:18,177
(Gosh, Dad.)

2061
02:02:18,906 --> 02:02:21,645
"When I saw you prepare for the show..."

2062
02:02:21,646 --> 02:02:24,077
"and practice without anyone's help,"

2063
02:02:24,547 --> 02:02:27,986
"I was half worried and half apologetic."

2064
02:02:29,016 --> 02:02:33,156
"You couldn't play with friends,
eat, or make good memories."

2065
02:02:34,887 --> 02:02:38,326
"Seeing you spend the teenage
years, the golden age that way..."

2066
02:02:38,327 --> 02:02:39,927
"made my heart ache so much."

2067
02:02:41,927 --> 02:02:43,735
"I saw you practice until
your hat was soaked..."

2068
02:02:43,736 --> 02:02:45,936
"and your toenails were broken..."

2069
02:02:46,066 --> 02:02:48,306
"before you fell asleep
in an exhausted state."

2070
02:02:48,707 --> 02:02:51,677
"My heart ached because
I couldn't do it for you."

2071
02:02:52,476 --> 02:02:55,177
"But I also learned a lot from you..."

2072
02:02:55,347 --> 02:02:58,516
"since you always enjoyed
yourself and stayed serious."

2073
02:02:59,177 --> 02:03:02,886
"HYUNWOO, you have to be
the star wherever you're at..."

2074
02:03:02,887 --> 02:03:05,087
"these days. I'm rooting for you."

2075
02:03:05,587 --> 02:03:07,326
"You must've struggled a
lot and had many worries."

2076
02:03:07,327 --> 02:03:10,297
"I'm proud of you for
persevering and coming this far."

2077
02:03:10,497 --> 02:03:14,196
"When I watch you sing and dance on TV,"

2078
02:03:15,066 --> 02:03:18,065
"I feel like I've taken the
most effective energy drink..."

2079
02:03:18,066 --> 02:03:20,007
"in that moment."

2080
02:03:20,967 --> 02:03:24,007
"I'll always stay reliable
and cheer you on."

2081
02:03:24,507 --> 02:03:27,146
"JEONGMIN, it's time for
you to look ahead and run."

2082
02:03:27,906 --> 02:03:30,377
"You're running diligently
even at this moment."

2083
02:03:30,476 --> 02:03:33,347
"YOUNGSEO, I'll always root for
you as you run toward your dream."

2084
02:03:34,287 --> 02:03:36,217
"My precious son, YOUNGSEO."

2085
02:03:37,516 --> 02:03:39,626
- "I love you." - "I love you, HYUNWOO."

2086
02:03:39,627 --> 02:03:41,725
- "I love you." - "I love you. Heart."

2087
02:03:41,726 --> 02:03:42,886
"I love you, my son."

2088
02:03:42,887 --> 02:03:44,555
"Your loving mom and dad."

2089
02:03:44,556 --> 02:03:47,526
"Your loving dad who
will always cheer you on."

2090
02:03:49,366 --> 02:03:51,366
I stayed manly and didn't shed tears.

2091
02:03:51,766 --> 02:03:53,183
I'll become successful and go home, Mom.

2092
02:03:53,207 --> 02:03:54,266
Just you watch.

2093
02:03:54,707 --> 02:03:56,106
Please root for me until the end.

2094
02:03:56,537 --> 02:03:57,677
I love you.

2095
02:03:58,406 --> 02:03:59,406
I love you.

2096
02:03:59,577 --> 02:04:00,606
I love you, Mom.

2097
02:04:00,877 --> 02:04:02,207
I love you guys.

2098
02:04:02,976 --> 02:04:04,316
I love you so much.

2099
02:04:07,986 --> 02:04:13,787
(Their Christmas on PROJECT 7
was warm thanks to the families.)

2100
02:04:27,936 --> 02:04:29,236
It's okay.

2101
02:04:29,837 --> 02:04:30,936
Don't cry.

2102
02:04:33,847 --> 02:04:37,316
They're the trainees' first fans...

2103
02:04:37,917 --> 02:04:39,616
who'll remain their fans forever.

2104
02:04:39,946 --> 02:04:41,645
The parents' supportive words...

2105
02:04:41,646 --> 02:04:44,087
moved me as well.

2106
02:04:44,186 --> 02:04:46,787
(Always PARK JUNSEO)

2107
02:04:46,887 --> 02:04:48,526
Thanks to the parents...

2108
02:04:48,887 --> 02:04:50,556
who always remained supportive...

2109
02:04:51,327 --> 02:04:52,796
as dependable allies,

2110
02:04:52,797 --> 02:04:55,626
the trainees could endure
the exhausting practice...

2111
02:04:55,627 --> 02:04:58,696
and come this far.

2112
02:05:00,866 --> 02:05:03,677
I personally wondered what to do...

2113
02:05:04,507 --> 02:05:05,636
with the heavy atmosphere.

2114
02:05:05,637 --> 02:05:07,577
I thank Director Bada...

2115
02:05:08,476 --> 02:05:11,347
and LYNNLYNN's father.

2116
02:05:12,677 --> 02:05:15,717
Assemble and upgrade, PROJECT 7.

2117
02:05:16,656 --> 02:05:20,457
The real-time global voting will end soon.

2118
02:05:21,327 --> 02:05:24,327
If you haven't voted for the trainee...

2119
02:05:24,957 --> 02:05:26,497
you were rooting for,

2120
02:05:26,696 --> 02:05:30,297
please make sure to
cast your precious vote.

2121
02:05:34,766 --> 02:05:36,476
Let me make the announcement again.

2122
02:05:37,106 --> 02:05:38,137
Soon,

2123
02:05:39,406 --> 02:05:42,806
the real-time global voting will end.

2124
02:05:47,186 --> 02:05:50,257
After the voting comes to an
end, the votes will be counted.

2125
02:05:51,087 --> 02:05:52,156
Then...

2126
02:05:53,757 --> 02:05:57,356
the final rankings will be announced...

2127
02:05:58,056 --> 02:06:01,566
to determine the debut team of PROJECT 7.

2128
02:06:04,896 --> 02:06:06,366
Which seven trainees...

2129
02:06:07,106 --> 02:06:09,667
will enjoy the happiness of debuting?

2130
02:06:12,406 --> 02:06:14,247
Will the trainees you're rooting for...

2131
02:06:14,806 --> 02:06:17,377
be able to realize their
dreams of debuting?

2132
02:06:21,087 --> 02:06:24,616
With the trainees that were
chosen by the World Assemblers,

2133
02:06:25,917 --> 02:06:27,226
the world-class...

2134
02:06:28,526 --> 02:06:30,297
idol group will be born.

2135
02:06:30,457 --> 02:06:33,497
Please watch until the end.

2136
02:06:33,526 --> 02:06:35,395
(JANG YEOJUN, SONG SEUNGHO, JEON MINWOOK, )

2137
02:06:35,396 --> 02:06:37,096
(KYOUNGBAE, SUNGMIN)

2138
02:06:37,097 --> 02:06:38,817
(JEON MINWOOK, debut as the center member.)

2139
02:06:41,007 --> 02:06:44,037
The members of CLOSE YOUR EYES...

2140
02:06:45,707 --> 02:06:47,146
will be revealed soon.

2141
02:06:49,816 --> 02:06:50,847
Soon,

2142
02:06:51,776 --> 02:06:53,696
the final members who
debut through PROJECT 7...

2143
02:06:54,446 --> 02:06:56,855
and work as CLOSE YOUR EYES...

2144
02:06:56,856 --> 02:06:59,927
will be revealed.

2145
02:07:00,226 --> 02:07:03,427
So please stay with us until the end.

2146
02:07:11,037 --> 02:07:12,167
Now,

2147
02:07:13,366 --> 02:07:15,306
the real-time global voting...

2148
02:07:17,507 --> 02:07:18,577
will end.

2149
02:07:25,976 --> 02:07:26,986
Ten.

2150
02:07:28,247 --> 02:07:29,287
Nine.

2151
02:07:30,356 --> 02:07:31,387
Eight.

2152
02:07:32,686 --> 02:07:33,686
Seven.

2153
02:07:34,656 --> 02:07:35,656
Six.

2154
02:07:36,797 --> 02:07:37,797
Five.

2155
02:07:38,696 --> 02:07:39,696
Four.

2156
02:07:40,927 --> 02:07:41,997
Three.

2157
02:07:42,967 --> 02:07:43,997
Two.

2158
02:07:45,097 --> 02:07:46,097
One.

2159
02:07:46,637 --> 02:07:48,037
The voting is closed.

2160
02:07:50,736 --> 02:07:52,706
(Is there another present
that awaits the trainees?)

2161
02:07:52,707 --> 02:07:53,877
What's this?

2162
02:07:54,446 --> 02:07:57,247
(What's this room?)

2163
02:07:58,047 --> 02:07:59,347
What's this?

2164
02:08:01,816 --> 02:08:05,587
(It contains the World Assemblers' love.)

2165
02:08:06,887 --> 02:08:10,226
(The room is full of
messages for the trainees.)

2166
02:08:10,556 --> 02:08:11,556
What?

2167
02:08:12,457 --> 02:08:13,467
My goodness.

2168
02:08:14,467 --> 02:08:15,566
There's me.

2169
02:08:18,236 --> 02:08:19,337
My goodness.

2170
02:08:19,696 --> 02:08:20,806
Where am I?

2171
02:08:20,967 --> 02:08:22,306
I'm right here.

2172
02:08:22,837 --> 02:08:27,146
(The World Assembler Room
is full of precious memories.)

2173
02:08:31,146 --> 02:08:32,876
(Our lovely and talented
MINWOOK, all of us know...)

2174
02:08:32,877 --> 02:08:34,462
(how hard you worked to prove your talent.)

2175
02:08:34,486 --> 02:08:35,945
(MINWOOK, you always did your best.)

2176
02:08:35,946 --> 02:08:37,363
(The world will give
you the fitting result.)

2177
02:08:37,387 --> 02:08:39,015
(MINWOOK, I've been very
sick since July of this year.)

2178
02:08:39,016 --> 02:08:41,216
(You gave me laughter and
strength to support someone!)

2179
02:08:41,587 --> 02:08:44,497
"MINWOOK, I've been very
sick since July of this year."

2180
02:08:45,056 --> 02:08:46,765
"There were many stressful moments..."

2181
02:08:46,766 --> 02:08:48,597
"and days I passed out,"

2182
02:08:48,967 --> 02:08:50,736
"so I was quite depressed."

2183
02:08:51,997 --> 02:08:54,967
"I was sick and stressed out,
but watching you perform..."

2184
02:08:55,766 --> 02:08:58,637
"made me forget about
my struggles and smile."

2185
02:08:59,577 --> 02:09:00,975
"You gave me laughter..."

2186
02:09:00,976 --> 02:09:04,347
"and strength to support someone!"

2187
02:09:06,347 --> 02:09:08,645
I hope that you won't be depressed.

2188
02:09:08,646 --> 02:09:10,115
I hope that you'll be healthy.

2189
02:09:10,116 --> 02:09:12,616
I'll do better...

2190
02:09:12,957 --> 02:09:15,787
and shine more on the stage.

2191
02:09:16,226 --> 02:09:18,327
I hope that you'll become happy...

2192
02:09:18,656 --> 02:09:20,497
through me.

2193
02:09:24,667 --> 02:09:26,565
(YEOJUN, hello! I'm proud
of you for improving yourself...)

2194
02:09:26,566 --> 02:09:28,337
(and growing through each competition.)

2195
02:09:28,637 --> 02:09:30,376
(Watching you grow a bit at
a time made me want to cry.)

2196
02:09:30,377 --> 02:09:32,697
(I hope your wish and my
wish will come true this winter!)

2197
02:09:33,106 --> 02:09:35,206
"The all-rounder, YEOJUN."

2198
02:09:35,207 --> 02:09:38,047
"It's nice that you always
work hard for your dream."

2199
02:09:38,877 --> 02:09:40,586
"It's my dream to become a trainee,"

2200
02:09:40,587 --> 02:09:43,016
"so you give me a lot of courage."

2201
02:09:44,116 --> 02:09:46,757
I haven't debuted yet,
but there's someone...

2202
02:09:47,127 --> 02:09:50,896
who's motivated by me
to work toward her dream.

2203
02:09:51,627 --> 02:09:54,196
I'm quite surprised.

2204
02:09:54,627 --> 02:09:57,695
Had the 16-year-old YEOJUN...

2205
02:09:57,696 --> 02:09:59,797
who first began to dream watched this,

2206
02:10:00,266 --> 02:10:01,906
he would've cried a lot.

2207
02:10:02,537 --> 02:10:05,707
I'd like to give one reply.

2208
02:10:06,436 --> 02:10:08,806
I hope that it won't be your
dream to become a trainee.

2209
02:10:09,747 --> 02:10:12,876
I'll diligently prepare
for the final on this show.

2210
02:10:12,877 --> 02:10:15,847
I hope we'll be able to
meet on the stage later.

2211
02:10:17,717 --> 02:10:19,516
I can feel so much love.

2212
02:10:24,457 --> 02:10:28,526
"I had a stressful year as a 12th grader."

2213
02:10:28,896 --> 02:10:30,596
"During the stressful time
of preparing for CSAT,"

2214
02:10:30,597 --> 02:10:32,337
"you were my best comedian..."

2215
02:10:32,696 --> 02:10:33,766
"Comedian?"

2216
02:10:34,167 --> 02:10:36,136
"Idol, vitamin,"

2217
02:10:36,137 --> 02:10:38,076
"and oxygen tank."

2218
02:10:38,077 --> 02:10:40,445
"Now, I'll support you always."

2219
02:10:40,446 --> 02:10:43,077
"So please continue to move forward."

2220
02:10:44,047 --> 02:10:45,475
(A heartwarming message
from a World Assembler...)

2221
02:10:45,476 --> 02:10:47,023
(who wants him to
continue marching forward)

2222
02:10:47,047 --> 02:10:49,486
Thanks to you, I could come here...

2223
02:10:49,646 --> 02:10:52,886
without giving up in the past four years.

2224
02:10:52,887 --> 02:10:53,986
I'm serious.

2225
02:10:58,056 --> 02:10:59,396
(To HYUNWOO)

2226
02:10:59,927 --> 02:11:02,026
"Whenever I struggle with the job hunt,"

2227
02:11:02,327 --> 02:11:06,396
"I get energized by
watching you work hard."

2228
02:11:06,866 --> 02:11:08,805
"Don't forget..."

2229
02:11:08,806 --> 02:11:12,537
"that you make more
people happy than you think."

2230
02:11:13,976 --> 02:11:16,377
One performance remains.

2231
02:11:17,247 --> 02:11:21,016
If I can give more
performances in the future,

2232
02:11:21,917 --> 02:11:24,217
I'll continue to give you strength.

2233
02:11:26,587 --> 02:11:28,457
It says, "Big Brother SEUNGHO."

2234
02:11:29,257 --> 02:11:32,327
"There must've been times you cried a lot."

2235
02:11:32,757 --> 02:11:34,566
"Thank you for persevering."

2236
02:11:35,566 --> 02:11:37,866
"There's a phrase I like very much."

2237
02:11:38,266 --> 02:11:40,207
"If you can't avoid it, enjoy it."

2238
02:11:41,066 --> 02:11:44,436
"I hope our words will comfort you."

2239
02:11:45,537 --> 02:11:47,446
I'll be a big brother and work hard.

2240
02:11:50,516 --> 02:11:51,516
"Big Brother JEONGMIN."

2241
02:11:51,517 --> 02:11:52,677
(His cheeks go red.)

2242
02:11:52,877 --> 02:11:55,247
"I love you so much. I'll
vote for you diligently."

2243
02:11:55,816 --> 02:11:57,485
"Please come to the graduation ceremony."

2244
02:11:57,486 --> 02:11:59,816
"I'll bring paper and a pen
and get your autograph."

2245
02:12:00,056 --> 02:12:03,056
"I'll get your photos too. I hope
that you'll always be happy."

2246
02:12:03,257 --> 02:12:05,356
"Stay healthy and don't
catch a cold. I love you."

2247
02:12:06,026 --> 02:12:07,097
My goodness.

2248
02:12:08,797 --> 02:12:11,696
I'll go to the graduation ceremony.

2249
02:12:13,137 --> 02:12:14,606
"HAJOON,"

2250
02:12:15,007 --> 02:12:17,936
"I hope that you'll
perform with confidence."

2251
02:12:18,236 --> 02:12:19,975
"I'll root for you in every moment."

2252
02:12:19,976 --> 02:12:21,446
"So let's debut."

2253
02:12:21,847 --> 02:12:24,717
I also want to be with
the World Assemblers...

2254
02:12:25,316 --> 02:12:28,787
in every moment.

2255
02:12:30,656 --> 02:12:32,256
"Big Brother AHN JUNWON."

2256
02:12:32,257 --> 02:12:36,327
It's nice that there's a fan
who calls me "Big brother."

2257
02:12:37,696 --> 02:12:39,957
"I know that you work hard."

2258
02:12:40,427 --> 02:12:43,266
"So I hope that you'll continue to smile."

2259
02:12:44,637 --> 02:12:47,066
"We'll follow you until then."

2260
02:12:48,137 --> 02:12:50,637
I hope the World Assemblers
who are walking with me...

2261
02:12:50,806 --> 02:12:54,077
will be full of happiness and good fortune.

2262
02:12:55,007 --> 02:12:56,846
"Thank you for showing your smile always."

2263
02:12:56,847 --> 02:13:01,486
"You shined the most when
you became the center member."

2264
02:13:02,646 --> 02:13:04,957
It's nice.

2265
02:13:06,656 --> 02:13:09,927
(KENSHIN looks for another
message by a World Assembler.)

2266
02:13:10,757 --> 02:13:13,566
"KENSHIN, don't forget Korean."

2267
02:13:15,297 --> 02:13:17,396
"KENSHIN,"

2268
02:13:17,566 --> 02:13:20,365
"I'll always root for you."

2269
02:13:20,366 --> 02:13:21,936
Thank you.

2270
02:13:22,266 --> 02:13:25,507
Please continue to root for me.

2271
02:13:28,847 --> 02:13:30,105
(My beloved ANDY, words can't express...)

2272
02:13:30,106 --> 02:13:31,346
(how special you are.)

2273
02:13:31,347 --> 02:13:32,576
(ANDY, hello. Don't regret it...)

2274
02:13:32,577 --> 02:13:33,992
(even if you don't get
the result you wanted.)

2275
02:13:34,016 --> 02:13:35,916
"No matter where you're at,"

2276
02:13:35,917 --> 02:13:38,116
"I can find you in 0.5 seconds..."

2277
02:13:38,217 --> 02:13:40,226
"because you shine..."

2278
02:13:40,257 --> 02:13:43,387
"more than anyone on the stage."

2279
02:13:43,856 --> 02:13:47,266
"It was really nice to meet
ANDY on PROJECT 7."

2280
02:13:47,497 --> 02:13:48,497
"Good luck!"

2281
02:13:48,498 --> 02:13:50,566
(Good luck!)

2282
02:13:51,396 --> 02:13:54,366
"SUNGMIN, hello. I'm your fan."

2283
02:13:54,707 --> 02:13:56,707
"Let me criticize you first."

2284
02:13:56,866 --> 02:13:59,936
"I was shocked when I watched
your 'Hype Boy' performance."

2285
02:14:02,476 --> 02:14:04,746
"But your 'Merry-Go-Round' performance..."

2286
02:14:04,747 --> 02:14:07,087
"moved me and made me feel proud."

2287
02:14:07,486 --> 02:14:10,485
"I want to see you grow even more."

2288
02:14:10,486 --> 02:14:11,556
"I'll root for you."

2289
02:14:11,816 --> 02:14:13,116
"I'm your fan."

2290
02:14:13,316 --> 02:14:16,627
I really like that part.

2291
02:14:16,997 --> 02:14:20,667
It's very precious that
there's a fan of mine.

2292
02:14:23,266 --> 02:14:24,297
This is incredible.

2293
02:14:28,037 --> 02:14:29,037
"YICHEN,"

2294
02:14:29,038 --> 02:14:31,436
"I love watching you
laugh, cry, and get angry."

2295
02:14:31,837 --> 02:14:33,376
I think this person liked it...

2296
02:14:33,377 --> 02:14:36,606
when I got angry as a P5 member.

2297
02:14:37,446 --> 02:14:39,646
"I'll root for you..."

2298
02:14:40,146 --> 02:14:42,746
"so that your dream will come
true and you'll continue to smile."

2299
02:14:43,516 --> 02:14:46,156
Thank you so much. With this energy,

2300
02:14:47,186 --> 02:14:49,556
I'll work hard on the final stage.

2301
02:14:50,226 --> 02:14:51,226
Thank you.

2302
02:14:51,227 --> 02:14:54,366
I'm so thankful that this person
loves even my angry side.

2303
02:14:55,526 --> 02:14:57,565
"I'm a World Assembler..."

2304
02:14:57,566 --> 02:14:59,896
"who has rooted for you
since your last challenge."

2305
02:15:00,537 --> 02:15:03,467
"Thank you for not giving up on
your dream of becoming an idol."

2306
02:15:04,106 --> 02:15:08,707
There are fans who waited
for me. Thank you so much.

2307
02:15:10,007 --> 02:15:11,876
"JUNSEO, you're very talented,"

2308
02:15:11,877 --> 02:15:13,946
"precious, valuable, and special."

2309
02:15:14,047 --> 02:15:16,686
"You're more perfect than you think."

2310
02:15:17,356 --> 02:15:19,257
I don't know if I'm that perfect.

2311
02:15:19,587 --> 02:15:24,327
I'm so thankful for the
fans' words of support.

2312
02:15:24,556 --> 02:15:26,656
I'll work hard.

2313
02:15:26,997 --> 02:15:28,026
Thank you.

2314
02:15:32,266 --> 02:15:33,566
"LYNNLYNN,"

2315
02:15:34,007 --> 02:15:38,106
"I was moved by your effort on PROJECT 7."

2316
02:15:38,707 --> 02:15:44,677
"I was so moved when you placed 35th..."

2317
02:15:45,816 --> 02:15:50,186
"in the Second Passing
Ceremony that I cried."

2318
02:15:51,217 --> 02:15:54,087
Thank you. Without you,
that wouldn't have happened.

2319
02:15:55,186 --> 02:15:57,655
I didn't know if I could
give the third performance.

2320
02:15:57,656 --> 02:16:00,226
I didn't know if I could perform "Trigger."

2321
02:16:00,427 --> 02:16:02,426
I can't believe I did so well.

2322
02:16:02,427 --> 02:16:04,667
Thank you for voting for me.

2323
02:16:10,167 --> 02:16:11,177
What's this?

2324
02:16:12,976 --> 02:16:14,047
Am I included too?

2325
02:16:17,077 --> 02:16:19,347
"You're much more charming than you think."

2326
02:16:19,877 --> 02:16:23,316
"People like you and
want to be with you..."

2327
02:16:24,117 --> 02:16:25,786
"more than you think,"

2328
02:16:26,156 --> 02:16:28,087
"but there will be moments of doubt."

2329
02:16:29,056 --> 02:16:30,656
"If you tell me then,"

2330
02:16:30,997 --> 02:16:32,697
"I'll tell you once more..."

2331
02:16:33,197 --> 02:16:34,767
"that you're very cool."

2332
02:16:37,396 --> 02:16:39,796
(Moved)

2333
02:16:39,937 --> 02:16:43,337
Thanks to people who continue
to support me without giving up,

2334
02:16:43,806 --> 02:16:47,906
I could reach the
finals with gritted teeth.

2335
02:16:48,347 --> 02:16:50,576
I'll put it up on the wall and
read it when things get hard.

2336
02:16:50,577 --> 02:16:53,246
Thank you so much for
writing this message...

2337
02:16:53,247 --> 02:16:55,117
with sincerity.

2338
02:16:55,947 --> 02:16:56,986
Thank you so much.

2339
02:16:58,757 --> 02:17:02,857
"I know that you had
difficult days in the past."

2340
02:17:05,497 --> 02:17:07,827
"I'll stay by your side always."

2341
02:17:11,396 --> 02:17:15,767
My fans are looking forward to seeing me.

2342
02:17:16,406 --> 02:17:19,375
So I must keep on running without stopping.

2343
02:17:19,376 --> 02:17:22,846
That was why I loved listening...

2344
02:17:22,847 --> 02:17:26,177
to "RUN" on PROJECT 7.

2345
02:17:26,417 --> 02:17:28,517
"RUN." That's how I feel.

2346
02:17:29,046 --> 02:17:33,117
I want to run to the World Assemblers.

2347
02:17:34,357 --> 02:17:35,426
I love you.

2348
02:17:35,427 --> 02:17:37,896
(I love you.)

2349
02:17:40,097 --> 02:17:41,367
"Hello, KYOUNGBAE."

2350
02:17:41,466 --> 02:17:44,635
"Words can't express the
difficult path you've taken."

2351
02:17:44,636 --> 02:17:46,066
"But I'm so proud of you."

2352
02:17:47,066 --> 02:17:48,166
"Whenever things get tough,"

2353
02:17:48,167 --> 02:17:50,535
"don't forget that we're
always rooting for you."

2354
02:17:50,536 --> 02:17:51,805
"KYOUNGBAE, let's debut!"

2355
02:17:51,806 --> 02:17:52,875
(Let's debut!)

2356
02:17:52,876 --> 02:17:54,777
I said that what I wanted to hear...

2357
02:17:55,306 --> 02:17:58,716
the most was, "KYOUNGBAE, let's debut."

2358
02:17:59,546 --> 02:18:01,146
Thank you so much...

2359
02:18:01,716 --> 02:18:03,447
for writing this heartfelt message.

2360
02:18:05,257 --> 02:18:06,586
I like all of them.

2361
02:18:06,587 --> 02:18:09,687
(I like all of them.)

2362
02:18:10,456 --> 02:18:11,497
"BINGHUA,"

2363
02:18:11,796 --> 02:18:15,867
"thank you for making my life happier."

2364
02:18:16,497 --> 02:18:19,667
"I'll always love you..."

2365
02:18:20,136 --> 02:18:22,705
"and support you..."

2366
02:18:22,706 --> 02:18:26,107
"even when there are difficulties."

2367
02:18:27,646 --> 02:18:30,476
I'll make sure to realize my
dream of becoming an idol.

2368
02:18:30,847 --> 02:18:34,447
I'll never give up.

2369
02:18:34,587 --> 02:18:35,816
I won't give up.

2370
02:18:37,316 --> 02:18:38,357
There it is!

2371
02:18:41,386 --> 02:18:45,357
"YOUNGSEO, you're the
kindest and gentlest person."

2372
02:18:46,757 --> 02:18:48,065
"Your voice is like..."

2373
02:18:48,066 --> 02:18:51,136
"the passing wind in the starry night sky."

2374
02:18:52,796 --> 02:18:55,235
"YOUNGSEO, don't forget
this even during the dark time."

2375
02:18:55,236 --> 02:18:57,936
"Light finds its way in the end."

2376
02:18:57,937 --> 02:19:00,306
(Light finds its way in the end.)

2377
02:19:02,247 --> 02:19:03,277
It's very...

2378
02:19:06,316 --> 02:19:07,847
Like this person said,

2379
02:19:08,216 --> 02:19:11,517
there were many difficult times...

2380
02:19:13,087 --> 02:19:14,927
that could be described as the dark age.

2381
02:19:16,986 --> 02:19:18,896
But whenever that happened...

2382
02:19:32,536 --> 02:19:35,077
There were fans who rooted for me.

2383
02:19:38,747 --> 02:19:40,347
Through PROJECT 7,

2384
02:19:41,816 --> 02:19:43,587
I could challenge myself.

2385
02:19:47,257 --> 02:19:51,126
I think I found my way and
am running toward my goal.

2386
02:19:52,697 --> 02:19:54,166
Thank you always.

2387
02:19:54,167 --> 02:19:56,167
(Thank you always.)

2388
02:19:56,396 --> 02:19:58,597
During the Heart Assembling Event,

2389
02:19:59,466 --> 02:20:03,706
there were so many fans.

2390
02:20:04,437 --> 02:20:06,405
(The trainees met the World Assemblers...)

2391
02:20:06,406 --> 02:20:07,805
(for the first time at the
Heart Assembling Event.)

2392
02:20:07,806 --> 02:20:09,176
It was my first time...

2393
02:20:09,177 --> 02:20:11,816
meeting people who rooted
for me and paid attention to me.

2394
02:20:13,417 --> 02:20:16,546
I felt both awkward and happy.

2395
02:20:17,386 --> 02:20:18,616
Many people...

2396
02:20:18,617 --> 02:20:22,886
who root for me and
truly wish for my success...

2397
02:20:24,226 --> 02:20:25,997
made me feel thankful.

2398
02:20:26,357 --> 02:20:28,997
I won't forget them until the day I die.

2399
02:20:30,396 --> 02:20:32,135
It's thanks to the World Assemblers...

2400
02:20:32,136 --> 02:20:35,066
that I can practice until late at night.

2401
02:20:35,806 --> 02:20:37,906
Words can't express it.

2402
02:20:38,706 --> 02:20:41,447
They're this much precious.

2403
02:20:41,976 --> 02:20:44,046
If I think about my fans
when I'm exhausted,

2404
02:20:45,216 --> 02:20:46,417
I can dance 100 more times.

2405
02:20:47,786 --> 02:20:48,986
That's how precious they are.

2406
02:20:50,786 --> 02:20:54,757
Instead of just receiving support,
I want to give them energy.

2407
02:20:55,556 --> 02:20:58,726
I want to be someone
who can give happiness...

2408
02:20:59,597 --> 02:21:00,997
to the World Assemblers.

2409
02:21:01,296 --> 02:21:04,497
I want to be remembered as a trainee...

2410
02:21:05,036 --> 02:21:08,007
who happily runs toward his dream.

2411
02:21:08,437 --> 02:21:10,007
A cool trainee.

2412
02:21:14,806 --> 02:21:16,305
What are we doing here today?

2413
02:21:16,306 --> 02:21:17,846
- Recording! - Recording!

2414
02:21:17,847 --> 02:21:19,545
We're here to record a fan song...

2415
02:21:19,546 --> 02:21:20,815
- for the World Assemblers. - A fan song.

2416
02:21:20,816 --> 02:21:22,286
- A fan song. - With love.

2417
02:21:26,617 --> 02:21:29,527
It's a fan song for the World Assemblers.

2418
02:21:29,786 --> 02:21:32,296
That was why I thought,

2419
02:21:32,626 --> 02:21:35,496
"I'll deliver my sincerity..."

2420
02:21:35,497 --> 02:21:37,896
"to my fans."

2421
02:21:38,536 --> 02:21:42,336
"I want to sing this song
in a precious and nice way."

2422
02:21:42,337 --> 02:21:44,036
I had that desire.

2423
02:21:47,206 --> 02:21:49,746
I sang the song while thinking...

2424
02:21:49,747 --> 02:21:52,316
about my fans and family.

2425
02:22:04,927 --> 02:22:06,296
What do you want to do?

2426
02:22:06,796 --> 02:22:08,125
What do you want to show?

2427
02:22:08,126 --> 02:22:09,466
The game of guessing the number.

2428
02:22:11,236 --> 02:22:13,367
- Hello. - Hello.

2429
02:22:13,736 --> 02:22:15,507
- I'm in your care. - Okay.

2430
02:22:17,036 --> 02:22:19,106
(They begin recording "Yesterday,
Today, and Tomorrow...")

2431
02:22:19,107 --> 02:22:20,806
(for the World Assemblers.)

2432
02:22:26,417 --> 02:22:31,286
(They want to repay for
the World Assemblers' love.)

2433
02:22:32,386 --> 02:22:35,456
I really thank the World Assemblers.

2434
02:22:35,757 --> 02:22:38,197
I want to show them my cool side.

2435
02:22:40,396 --> 02:22:44,896
There are many people who
believe in me and wait for me.

2436
02:22:47,396 --> 02:22:50,007
I felt emotional...

2437
02:22:50,136 --> 02:22:52,507
because I wanted to repay them.

2438
02:22:57,107 --> 02:23:01,087
I'm always thankful for my fans.

2439
02:23:01,517 --> 02:23:02,947
They give me strength and support.

2440
02:23:03,216 --> 02:23:05,456
I want them to be happy.

2441
02:23:05,857 --> 02:23:07,216
I'm so thankful.

2442
02:23:07,687 --> 02:23:11,196
Being able to perform before
people who root for me...

2443
02:23:11,197 --> 02:23:15,197
makes me the happiest in the world.

2444
02:23:16,527 --> 02:23:20,097
I'll continue to give them strength.

(Including small and cute
items that the trainees love)

02:28:03,187 --> 02:28:06,587
(There's even a cozy
bed. Where is this place?)

2462
02:28:07,986 --> 02:28:09,586
(A pajama party on PROJECT 7)

2463
02:28:09,587 --> 02:28:11,496

02:28:21,036 --> 02:28:22,107
No way.

2469
02:28:22,906 --> 02:28:24,677
You look like Principal Ench.

2470
02:28:24,777 --> 02:28:26,437
Right, I'm that man.

2471
02:28:26,906 --> 02:28:28,545
We have one dinosaur called Dooly.

2472
02:28:28,546 --> 02:28:29,946
This is really cute.

2473
02:28:29,947 --> 02:28:32,475
(And two cats)

2474
02:28:32,476 --> 02:28:33,645
We should put this down.

2475
02:28:33,646 --> 02:28:34,716
What?

2476
02:28:35,886 --> 02:28:37,956
(The MCs for the pajama
party Part 1 appear.)

2477
02:28:38,316 --> 02:28:39,955
- Assemble and upgrade, PROJECT 7.
- PROJECT 7.

2478
02:28:39,956 --> 02:28:42,527
(Assemble and upgrade, PROJECT 7.)

2479
02:28:43,757 --> 02:28:45,156
They sounded like him.

2480
02:28:45,296 --> 02:28:46,496
They sounded exactly like him.

2481
02:28:46,497 --> 02:28:48,737
- You sound just like him.
- You sound exactly like him.

2482
02:28:49,667 --> 02:28:51,596

02:29:07,417 --> 02:29:08,645
It's starting now.

2489
02:29:08,646 --> 02:29:10,617
(I really can't wait!)

2490
02:29:12,857 --> 02:29:13,917
You're good.

2491
02:29:14,786 --> 02:29:16,786
KENSHIN, which award would you like to win?

2492
02:29:17,327 --> 02:29:19,697
A cute award.

2493
02:29:20,156 --> 02:29:21,427
Cute Trainee Award?

2494
02:29:22,367 --> 02:29:23,367
What about you, BINGHUA?

2495
02:29:23,827 --> 02:29:25,796
What kind of award do you expect to win?

2496
02:29:26,267 --> 02:29:27,566
Tough Man Award.

2497
02:29:28,107 --> 02:29:29,235
Tough Man Award.

2498
02:29:29,236 --> 02:29:30,466
Tough Man Award?

2499
02:29:30,806 --> 02:29:32,507
(BINGHUA wants to win Tough Man Award.)

2500
02:29:32,536 --> 02:29:33,705
No way.

2501
02:29:33,706 --> 02:29:35,906
Trainee BINGHUA, do you have a conscience?

2502
02:29:39,376 --> 02:29:42,486
We will announce the award winners.

2503
02:29:42,747 --> 02:29:45,716
First of all, YICHEN, please come up.

2504
02:29:45,886 --> 02:29:46,985
Me?

2505
02:29:46,986 --> 02:29:48,563
(YICHEN is the first
honorable award winner.)

2506
02:29:48,587 --> 02:29:50,456
Is this done 1 by 1?

2507
02:29:51,226 --> 02:29:52,257
I'm curious.

2508
02:29:52,697 --> 02:29:53,726
I'm curious.

2509
02:29:54,027 --> 02:29:55,027
(What kind of award will YICHEN win?)

2510
02:29:55,028 --> 02:29:56,226
This award is given...

2511
02:29:56,327 --> 02:29:58,735
to a good son who listens to his mom.

2512
02:29:58,736 --> 02:30:01,437
(Good Son Who Listens to His Mom Award)

2513
02:30:02,607 --> 02:30:04,337
- Is he a good son? Why? - Good Son Award.

2514
02:30:04,706 --> 02:30:06,405
After his mom kicked
him out and scolded him,

2515
02:30:06,406 --> 02:30:08,447
- he became a good son. - Really?

2516
02:30:08,577 --> 02:30:09,875
That's why he got scolded.

2517
02:30:09,876 --> 02:30:11,156
(I'm happy even if I'm scolded.)

2518
02:30:11,247 --> 02:30:14,046
(What YICHEN's mother who's in China said)

2519
02:30:14,447 --> 02:30:17,517
(That's not what I taught you.)

2520
02:30:17,617 --> 02:30:19,056
She scolded him.

2521
02:30:19,886 --> 02:30:22,055
Since then, he has been
saying "Everyone, join me."

2522
02:30:22,056 --> 02:30:25,327
He changed completely including
his gentle way of talking and look.

2523
02:30:25,556 --> 02:30:28,895
As he acted as a good
son who listens to his mom,

2524
02:30:28,896 --> 02:30:30,027
this award is given to him.

2525
02:30:31,236 --> 02:30:33,096
- Do you obey your mom? - Of course.

2526
02:30:33,097 --> 02:30:34,166
- He's a good son. - Really?

2527
02:30:34,167 --> 02:30:35,337
He's a good son.

2528
02:30:35,837 --> 02:30:36,905
Congratulations.

2529
02:30:36,906 --> 02:30:38,535
- Congratulations, YICHEN.
- Congratulations.

2530
02:30:38,536 --> 02:30:40,035
- Congratulations. - It's an award.

2531
02:30:40,036 --> 02:30:41,706
I'm really obedient towards my mom.

2532
02:30:45,347 --> 02:30:46,777
The next award is called...

2533
02:30:47,716 --> 02:30:50,316
I Put It in My Assembly Basket Award.

2534
02:30:51,017 --> 02:30:52,786
What does "basket" mean?

2535
02:30:53,517 --> 02:30:56,527
It might be someone who
got many Assembly Votes.

2536
02:30:57,757 --> 02:30:58,757
Is it KENSHIN?

2537
02:31:00,197 --> 02:31:02,466
- Or SEUNGHO? - Is it one of us?

2538
02:31:03,066 --> 02:31:05,767
The award goes to WOO HAJOON.

2539
02:31:06,136 --> 02:31:07,236
Please come out.

2540
02:31:07,536 --> 02:31:08,867
- Congratulations. - It's HAJOON.

2541
02:31:10,167 --> 02:31:13,776
His "Time After Time" costume
looked like a shopping basket,

2542
02:31:13,777 --> 02:31:15,577
and so it became the talk of the town.

2543
02:31:15,976 --> 02:31:19,416
Compared to before, his
ranking increased by a lot.

2544
02:31:19,417 --> 02:31:22,417
This award is given to him as
we can't wait to see his next move.

2545
02:31:23,046 --> 02:31:24,145
Gosh.

2546
02:31:24,146 --> 02:31:25,656
That's the best award.

2547
02:31:26,486 --> 02:31:28,886
- Congratulations. - Nice.

2548
02:31:29,327 --> 02:31:32,155
The next award is given...

2549
02:31:32,156 --> 02:31:34,295

people laugh on PROJECT 7.

LYNNLYNN, please come out.

2554
02:31:42,236 --> 02:31:43,806
(It's LYNNLYNN, not KANG HYUNWOO.)

2555
02:31:44,777 --> 02:31:46,607
That's true. "Please."

2556
02:31:46,677 --> 02:31:47,805
Congratulations.

2557
02:31:47,806 --> 02:31:49,205
On PROJECT 7,

2558
02:31:49,206 --> 02:31:52,715
LYNNLYNN's Korean has
been improving every day.

2559
02:31:52,716 --> 02:31:54,577
Not only can he sing,
dance, and speak Korean,

2560
02:31:54,847 --> 02:31:57,616
but he also has a sense of humor in Korean.

2561
02:31:57,617 --> 02:32:00,586
We recognize him for
making many trainees laugh.

2562
02:32:00,587 --> 02:32:02,107
That's why this award is given to him.

2563
02:32:02,156 --> 02:32:04,857

looking his best these days.

(the trainees cried a lot.)

2570
02:32:24,107 --> 02:32:25,617
- We should comfort him. - It's okay.

2571
02:32:26,677 --> 02:32:28,947
(Which of them cried the most beautifully?)

2572
02:32:29,316 --> 02:32:32,017
Congratulations, BINGHUA. Please come out.

2573

The queen of tears looks beautiful.

2577
02:32:38,757 --> 02:32:40,096
As the sensitive and sympathetic type,

2578
02:32:40,097 --> 02:32:42,697
he cried a lot throughout the show.

2579
02:32:42,796 --> 02:32:44,796
Among PROJECT 7 trainees,

2580
02:32:44,896 --> 02:32:46,937
he had the most crying scenes.

2581
02:32:46,966 --> 02:32:50,007
BINGHUA tugged at World
Assemblers' heartstrings.

2582
02:32:50,607 --> 02:32:52,776
People were impressed by...

2583
02:32:52,777 --> 02:32:55,847
how beautiful he looked
even when he was crying.

2584
02:32:55,876 --> 02:32:58,576
In hopes that he'll only
cry out of happiness,

02:32:58,577 --> 02:32:59,746
this award is given to him.

2586

2619
02:34:15,956 --> 02:34:17,786
I don't want to look at them.

2620
02:34:18,357 --> 02:34:20,357
I don't want to look at them.

2621
02:34:20,757 --> 02:34:23,267
The next award is called...

2622
02:34:23,667 --> 02:34:26,667
The Gap is Insanely Huge Award.

2623
02:34:28,236 --> 02:34:29,805
- The Gap is Insanely Huge Award.
- The Gap is Insanely Huge Award?

2624
02:34:29,806 --> 02:34:31,206
- Why? - KIM JEONGMIN.

2625
02:34:31,236 --> 02:34:32,277
What about me?

2626
02:34:33,236 --> 02:34:34,337
- HYUNWOO. - Is it me?

2627
02:34:35,476 --> 02:34:36,975
- It's either JEONGMIN or HYUNWOO.
- KIM HYUNWOO.

2628
02:34:36,976 --> 02:34:38,816
I think that it's HYUNWOO.

2629
02:34:39,847 --> 02:34:41,687
We need to be consistent.

2630
02:34:42,447 --> 02:34:44,986
It's KIM HYUNWOO who isn't consistent.

2631
02:34:45,056 --> 02:34:47,216
Congratulations, HYUNWOO.

2632
02:34:48,357 --> 02:34:50,156
(It's an athletic meet.)

2633
02:34:50,486 --> 02:34:53,196
KIM HYUNWOO is called
PROJECT 7's main dancer...

2634
02:34:53,197 --> 02:34:54,455
you can count on.

2635
02:34:54,456 --> 02:34:57,527
Unlike being innocent
and mischievous like usual,

2636
02:34:57,626 --> 02:35:00,266
he completely changes
and becomes charismatic...

2637
02:35:00,267 --> 02:35:01,937
when he's on stage.

2638
02:35:04,206 --> 02:35:06,305
With the shocking gap in personality,

2639
02:35:06,306 --> 02:35:09,076
he won the hearts of the World Assemblers.

2640
02:35:09,077 --> 02:35:10,397
That's why the award goes to him.

2641
02:35:11,107 --> 02:35:12,545
(He tries to look amazing...)

2642
02:35:12,546 --> 02:35:14,046
(but fails.)

2643
02:35:14,247 --> 02:35:16,447
(Trembling yellow socks)

2644
02:35:18,986 --> 02:35:20,156
What's that?

2645
02:35:20,386 --> 02:35:21,417
It's "Jealousy."

2646
02:35:21,486 --> 02:35:22,526
(He's back to being innocent KIM HYUNWOO.)

2647
02:35:22,527 --> 02:35:24,087
Congratulations.

2648
02:35:24,786 --> 02:35:28,156
This award is very "SHALALA."

2649
02:35:28,497 --> 02:35:29,565
Go up, SEUNGHO.

2650
02:35:29,566 --> 02:35:31,735
You can tell that it's "SHALALA" from afar.

2651
02:35:31,736 --> 02:35:33,042
(You can tell that it's
"SHALALA" from afar.)

2652
02:35:33,066 --> 02:35:34,396
We got the bow.

2653
02:35:36,736 --> 02:35:38,735
With his pretty looks,

2654
02:35:38,736 --> 02:35:41,646
SONG SEUNGHO makes
other trainees around him happy.

2655
02:35:41,706 --> 02:35:45,117
During Original Matching, he
showed off his lovely charms.

2656
02:35:45,146 --> 02:35:47,947
He was noticed by many World Assemblers.

2657
02:35:48,046 --> 02:35:51,087
As he made the stage shine like "SHALALA,"

2658
02:35:51,146 --> 02:35:52,917
the award goes to him.

2659
02:35:54,816 --> 02:35:56,956
- HO SEUNGSONG. - You're handsome.

2660
02:35:57,226 --> 02:35:58,357
HO SEUNGSONG.

2661
02:35:59,296 --> 02:36:01,456
For the next award,

2662
02:36:01,767 --> 02:36:03,997
only one person comes to mind.

2663
02:36:04,796 --> 02:36:08,167
I didn't expect such a name for an award.

2664
02:36:08,636 --> 02:36:10,236
It's called...

2665
02:36:10,536 --> 02:36:12,936
Happy Nutria Award.

2666
02:36:12,937 --> 02:36:16,077
(Happy Nutria Award)

2667
02:36:20,216 --> 02:36:21,886
- It's finally here. - What is it?

2668
02:36:21,947 --> 02:36:24,016
We don't know who it is yet.

2669
02:36:24,017 --> 02:36:25,216
We don't know yet.

2670
02:36:26,156 --> 02:36:27,956
KANG HYUNWOO, please come out.

2671
02:36:29,027 --> 02:36:31,056
- Yes. - Oh, yes.

2672
02:36:31,226 --> 02:36:34,526
He brought laughter and
energy to Project Village.

2673
02:36:34,527 --> 02:36:38,535
As he always had the look for Happy Nutria,

2674
02:36:38,536 --> 02:36:40,097
the award goes to him.

2675
02:36:40,736 --> 02:36:44,107
Postscript. Happy Nutria, Happy New Year.

2676
02:36:45,937 --> 02:36:47,007
Help him.

2677
02:36:47,607 --> 02:36:49,906
The name of this award is very sexy.

2678
02:36:50,677 --> 02:36:53,177
Puddle in the Collarbone Award.

2679
02:36:53,476 --> 02:36:55,486
- The buttocks? - What did you say?

2680
02:36:55,587 --> 02:36:57,117
Puddle in the Collarbone.

2681
02:36:57,486 --> 02:36:58,517
Right here.

2682
02:36:58,617 --> 02:37:00,816
(This is a puddle in the collarbone.)

2683
02:37:03,126 --> 02:37:04,155
Thank you.

2684
02:37:04,156 --> 02:37:06,296
- I can't see your collarbone.
- Congratulations.

2685
02:37:06,357 --> 02:37:07,396
Thank you.

2686
02:37:08,527 --> 02:37:10,427
The next award is...

2687
02:37:11,226 --> 02:37:13,736
Good Job on Korean Award.

2688
02:37:14,466 --> 02:37:15,806
KENSHIN.

2689
02:37:16,767 --> 02:37:18,336
- KENSHIN. - Me?

2690
02:37:18,337 --> 02:37:20,235
SAKURADA KENSHIN, please come out.

2691
02:37:20,236 --> 02:37:21,646
Thank you.

2692
02:37:23,277 --> 02:37:26,376
(As a beginner in Korean,
he could only say hello.)

2693
02:37:26,447 --> 02:37:27,777
Nice to meet you.

2694
02:37:28,517 --> 02:37:29,947
"I love you, girls."

2695
02:37:30,247 --> 02:37:32,155
"Girls, please love us."

2696
02:37:32,156 --> 02:37:34,816
As we're proud of him
for learning Korean...

2697
02:37:34,956 --> 02:37:38,027
that stole the hearts of many
girls, this award goes to him.

2698
02:37:38,357 --> 02:37:40,597
(Here is another heartbreaker.)

2699
02:37:41,867 --> 02:37:43,267
Becoming Girls Award.

2700
02:37:44,626 --> 02:37:46,197
I wasn't going to say it today.

2701
02:37:46,937 --> 02:37:48,097
Come on, girls.

2702
02:37:49,706 --> 02:37:52,876
(Feeling embarrassed by
JEONGMIN's acting cute)

2703
02:37:56,906 --> 02:37:58,577
The next award is...

2704
02:37:59,517 --> 02:38:01,447
Human Sleeping Pill Award.

2705
02:38:02,587 --> 02:38:04,017
It must be NAM JIWOON.

2706
02:38:05,316 --> 02:38:06,715
Why? Is it because he sleeps a lot?

2707
02:38:06,716 --> 02:38:07,716
No.

2708
02:38:07,917 --> 02:38:09,126
He talks slowly.

2709
02:38:09,927 --> 02:38:10,927
Yes.

2710
02:38:12,257 --> 02:38:14,896
(Passing out right away)

2711
02:38:15,167 --> 02:38:17,296
(Snoring)

2712
02:38:18,896 --> 02:38:20,767
- What? - This is NAM JIWOON.

2713
02:38:21,806 --> 02:38:23,367
This is NAM JIWOON.

2714
02:38:25,777 --> 02:38:27,337
This is NAM JIWOON.

2715
02:38:27,636 --> 02:38:29,077
- Have you started? - Yes.

2716
02:38:29,777 --> 02:38:31,046
Did I really fall asleep?

2717
02:38:31,376 --> 02:38:33,476
By making more trainees fall asleep,

2718
02:38:33,646 --> 02:38:36,315
I'll become more suitable for this award.

2719
02:38:36,316 --> 02:38:37,446
- He's slow. - Thank you.

2720
02:38:37,447 --> 02:38:39,917
- He's really slow. - He talks very slowly.

2721
02:38:41,187 --> 02:38:42,455
JIWOON.

2722
02:38:42,456 --> 02:38:45,056
Finally, we have only one award to give.

2723
02:38:45,226 --> 02:38:46,726
Cute Cutlet.

2724
02:38:46,927 --> 02:38:48,666
- Pork Cutlet. - Pork Cutlet.

2725
02:38:48,667 --> 02:38:49,926
- Pork Cutlet. - Pork Cutlet.

2726
02:38:49,927 --> 02:38:53,497
This award is Popular Big Brother Award.

2727
02:38:54,197 --> 02:38:55,466
JEON MINWOOK.

2728
02:38:56,406 --> 02:38:58,066
Congratulations, MINWOOK.

2729
02:38:58,206 --> 02:39:00,405
One of the eldest trainees on PROJECT 7,

2730
02:39:00,406 --> 02:39:02,846
JEON MINWOOK always tries to help out...

2731
02:39:02,847 --> 02:39:05,546
his younger members and the team.

2732
02:39:05,747 --> 02:39:08,416
He's popular among all the trainees.

2733
02:39:08,417 --> 02:39:09,446
- Right. - That's corruption.

2734
02:39:09,447 --> 02:39:10,447
That's corruption.

2735
02:39:10,687 --> 02:39:12,815
That's why this award goes to him.

2736
02:39:12,816 --> 02:39:13,917
All right.

2737
02:39:14,357 --> 02:39:16,356
- I like MINWOOK. - Yes.

2738
02:39:16,357 --> 02:39:17,986
- I like him, too. - Me too.

2739
02:39:18,357 --> 02:39:20,257
- Thank you. - MINWOOK, you're so cute.

2740
02:39:21,226 --> 02:39:22,796
Is there any award for the MCs?

2741
02:39:23,027 --> 02:39:24,097
Hello.

2742
02:39:24,427 --> 02:39:26,497

02:39:30,337 --> 02:39:31,906
- You're amazing. - All right.

2745
02:39:32,476 --> 02:39:35,747
There's also an award for
MC JUNWON and SUNGMIN.

2746
02:39:36,507 --> 02:39:38,446
- What is it? - AHN JUNWON.

2747
02:39:38,447 --> 02:39:40,146
(He makes himself nervous.)

2748
02:39:40,876 --> 02:39:43,346
Skill Improvement is Breaking News Award.

2749
02:39:43,347 --> 02:39:45,357
(Skill Improvement is Breaking News Award)

2750
02:39:45,556 --> 02:39:46,886
Breaking news.

2751
02:39:47,056 --> 02:39:49,587
The main character of the event is here

2752
02:39:50,587 --> 02:39:52,155
There's something moving about it.

2753
02:39:52,156 --> 02:39:53,757
It's really moving.

2754
02:39:53,896 --> 02:39:54,956
That's amazing.

2755
02:39:55,796 --> 02:39:57,497
Amazing.

2756
02:39:57,626 --> 02:39:58,696
What kind of award...

2757
02:39:58,697 --> 02:40:01,135
will go to SUNGMIN?

2758
02:40:01,136 --> 02:40:02,566
He went out on his own.

2759
02:40:02,966 --> 02:40:05,405
Morning Sun in Cold Winter Award.

2760
02:40:05,406 --> 02:40:07,035
- What? - What did you say?

2761
02:40:07,036 --> 02:40:08,506
- Morning Sun... - It's called...

2762
02:40:08,507 --> 02:40:10,247
Morning Sun in Cold Winter Award.

2763
02:40:10,507 --> 02:40:13,447
Whatever the situation,

2764
02:40:13,777 --> 02:40:16,947
KIM SUNGMIN never lost his bright smile.

2765
02:40:17,146 --> 02:40:20,555
As his smile melted the cold dormitory,

2766
02:40:20,556 --> 02:40:22,055
this award goes to him.

2767
02:40:22,056 --> 02:40:23,226
(Sparkling)

2768
02:40:24,327 --> 02:40:25,757
KIM SUNGMIN, you look handsome.

2769
02:40:25,927 --> 02:40:30,626
I will keep trying to smile.

2770
02:40:30,726 --> 02:40:32,596
- Thank you. - Gosh.

2771
02:40:32,597 --> 02:40:34,296
That was nice and clean.

2772
02:40:34,437 --> 02:40:35,437
All right.

2773
02:40:35,566 --> 02:40:38,035
Unfortunately, this is the end...

2774
02:40:38,036 --> 02:40:40,806
of the 2024 PROJECT 7 Award Ceremony.

2775
02:40:41,406 --> 02:40:43,146
Good job, guys.

2776
02:40:44,146 --> 02:40:45,347
That's a bummer.

2777
02:40:46,216 --> 02:40:47,417
Next time,

2778
02:40:48,917 --> 02:40:50,885
I hope that all 21 of us will succeed...

2779
02:40:50,886 --> 02:40:54,156
and meet at a real award ceremony.

2780
02:40:54,556 --> 02:40:55,625
That's moving.

2781
02:40:55,626 --> 02:40:57,757
This was one-day MC AHN JUNWON.

2782
02:40:58,027 --> 02:40:59,357
And KIM SUNGMIN.

2783
02:40:59,827 --> 02:41:01,927
- Thank you.
- Give them a round of applause.

2784
02:41:02,197 --> 02:41:03,625
Well done.

2785
02:41:03,626 --> 02:41:05,226
(2024 PROJECT 7 Award Ceremony is over.)

2786
02:41:06,066 --> 02:41:07,366

2787
02:41:07,367 --> 02:41:08,367

(Part 2 MC KIM JEONGMIN)

2793
02:41:18,007 --> 02:41:19,546
Cutie. What?

2794
02:41:20,417 --> 02:41:22,747
It can be said that all 21 trainees here...

2795
02:41:22,917 --> 02:41:26,756
dedicated their everything
on PROJECT 7 in 2024.

2796
02:41:26,757 --> 02:41:29,756
They worked very hard only for PROJECT 7.

2797
02:41:29,757 --> 02:41:30,956
- Right. - That's true.

2798
02:41:31,056 --> 02:41:33,395
Shall we reflect on the year 2024...

2799
02:41:33,396 --> 02:41:35,927
and recall the past
according to the keywords?

2800
02:41:36,097 --> 02:41:37,366
- Okay. - Okay.

2801
02:41:37,367 --> 02:41:38,396
Here we go.

2802
02:41:38,636 --> 02:41:41,036
The keyword is Friendship Among Men.

2803
02:41:41,236 --> 02:41:42,507
"Friendship Among Men?"

2804
02:41:42,937 --> 02:41:45,676
To narrow down 200 trainees to 21,

2805
02:41:45,677 --> 02:41:47,636
we said goodbye to many people.

2806
02:41:47,906 --> 02:41:50,106
It couldn't be helped
because it's a survival show,

2807
02:41:50,107 --> 02:41:52,677
but we can never get
used to saying goodbye.

2808
02:41:53,417 --> 02:41:55,377
It's so hard to get a
chance to perform with you.

2809
02:41:56,046 --> 02:41:58,087
- Seriously. - I know what you mean.

2810
02:41:58,386 --> 02:42:00,757
Is there any eliminated trainee
whom you miss the most?

2811
02:42:01,386 --> 02:42:02,427
There are so many.

2812
02:42:02,786 --> 02:42:04,785
I can think of so many people.

2813
02:42:04,786 --> 02:42:06,927
- There are many. - ABE YURA.

2814
02:42:08,597 --> 02:42:10,327
There's one person.

2815
02:42:10,527 --> 02:42:12,795
I really miss JEONG DEUNHAESOL.

2816
02:42:12,796 --> 02:42:16,606
During our practice for
"3D," he was very helpful.

2817
02:42:16,607 --> 02:42:19,077
He relied on him a lot.

2818
02:42:19,837 --> 02:42:20,937
So I miss him very much.

2819
02:42:22,507 --> 02:42:24,447
I really miss SVIAT.

2820
02:42:25,107 --> 02:42:27,247
SVIAT, are you doing well?

2821
02:42:27,816 --> 02:42:29,886
Don't eat too much snack. I love you.

2822
02:42:30,986 --> 02:42:33,757
I miss FONG ATILLA.

2823
02:42:34,257 --> 02:42:35,625
- ATILLA. - ATILLA.

2824
02:42:35,626 --> 02:42:37,326
- ATILLA. - ATILLA.

2825
02:42:37,327 --> 02:42:39,226
My friend.

2826
02:42:39,296 --> 02:42:40,955
- You can do it, my friend. - My friend.

2827
02:42:40,956 --> 02:42:42,597
(You can do it, my friend.)

2828
02:42:43,126 --> 02:42:46,035
We've gotten very close on PROJECT 7.

2829
02:42:46,036 --> 02:42:47,266
- Yes. - Right.

2830
02:42:47,267 --> 02:42:48,905
Before PROJECT 7 is over,

2831
02:42:48,906 --> 02:42:51,206
is there any trainee that
you feel awkward with?

2832
02:42:51,337 --> 02:42:52,406
Yes, there is.

2833
02:42:53,077 --> 02:42:54,906
(Yes, there is.)

2834
02:42:55,206 --> 02:42:56,766
Why does he sound so positive about it?

2835
02:42:57,747 --> 02:43:01,617
Among the remaining trainees,
there's only one who's my age.

2836
02:43:02,747 --> 02:43:04,947
- Mr. KIM SUNGMIN. - Yes?

2837
02:43:05,146 --> 02:43:06,656
He calls him Mr. SUNGMIN.

2838
02:43:06,986 --> 02:43:08,087
Mr. KIM SUNGMIN?

2839
02:43:08,656 --> 02:43:11,125
Hold hands and talk
while looking at each other.

2840
02:43:11,126 --> 02:43:12,496
- Seriously? - Make...

2841
02:43:12,497 --> 02:43:14,427
three compliments about each other.

2842
02:43:14,597 --> 02:43:16,026
I didn't expect it to become a big deal.

2843
02:43:16,027 --> 02:43:17,666
- Say three of his strengths. - Okay.

2844
02:43:17,667 --> 02:43:19,097
Say each other's strengths.

2845
02:43:19,536 --> 02:43:21,036
This feels so awkward.

2846
02:43:21,466 --> 02:43:22,906
It's so awkward.

2847
02:43:24,007 --> 02:43:27,706
When I saw SUNGMIN for the first time...

2848
02:43:28,107 --> 02:43:29,905
- Look at him in the eye.
- Make eye contact.

2849
02:43:29,906 --> 02:43:31,006
- For the first time...
- Look at him in the eye.

2850
02:43:31,007 --> 02:43:32,246
Make eye contact.

2851
02:43:32,247 --> 02:43:34,145
(They can't hide feeling
awkward and embarrassed.)

2852
02:43:34,146 --> 02:43:35,146
At first...

2853
02:43:35,847 --> 02:43:37,087
Keep looking at him in the eye.

2854
02:43:39,757 --> 02:43:41,197
You have a nicely proportioned body.

2855
02:43:41,786 --> 02:43:43,827
You're very handsome.

2856
02:43:44,056 --> 02:43:46,857
It's good to see you work hard.

2857
02:43:49,497 --> 02:43:51,625
(Cringing)

2858
02:43:51,626 --> 02:43:52,736
What are you guys doing?

2859
02:43:52,966 --> 02:43:54,437
You won't be close friends.

2860
02:43:54,597 --> 02:43:56,065
- What are you doing? - The two of them...

2861
02:43:56,066 --> 02:43:57,205
(Stammering)

2862
02:43:57,206 --> 02:43:58,267
YEOJUN.

2863
02:43:59,206 --> 02:44:00,507
They might grow apart even more.

2864
02:44:00,937 --> 02:44:04,007
You reminded me of DOYOUNG
of NCT when I first saw you.

2865
02:44:04,277 --> 02:44:05,475
Don't say that.

2866
02:44:05,476 --> 02:44:07,576
I thought that you were handsome.

2867
02:44:07,577 --> 02:44:09,546
- What's wrong with you?
- They do look similar.

2868
02:44:10,247 --> 02:44:13,455
You're a good dancer.

2869
02:44:13,456 --> 02:44:16,087
I thought that I could practice with you...

2870
02:44:16,726 --> 02:44:21,357
if we got on the same team.

2871
02:44:21,796 --> 02:44:23,625
I imagined it several times.

2872
02:44:23,626 --> 02:44:24,767
I see.

2873
02:44:25,466 --> 02:44:27,466
- Thank you. - Thank you?

2874
02:44:28,097 --> 02:44:29,235
- Let's be friends. - I love you.

2875
02:44:29,236 --> 02:44:30,337
I love you too.

2876
02:44:32,736 --> 02:44:35,076
- You two should be friends.
- That was so awkward.

2877
02:44:35,077 --> 02:44:36,606
I shouldn't have said it. It's so awkward.

2878
02:44:36,607 --> 02:44:37,976
This is really awkward.

2879
02:44:39,117 --> 02:44:41,876
Tonight is our last
night in Project Village.

2880
02:44:42,216 --> 02:44:43,645
I'm sure that you spent...

2881
02:44:43,646 --> 02:44:46,656
an unforgettable year on PROJECT 7.

2882
02:44:47,087 --> 02:44:49,155
Tell us your new goals...

2883
02:44:49,156 --> 02:44:51,456
and resolutions in 2025.

2884
02:44:52,027 --> 02:44:54,456
I want to sing a lot, which is what I love.

2885
02:44:54,726 --> 02:44:57,396
I won Eardrums Got Melted Award.

2886
02:44:57,597 --> 02:45:00,965
Performing as much as possible...

2887
02:45:00,966 --> 02:45:05,437
to melt more people's
eardrums is my resolution.

2888
02:45:08,736 --> 02:45:10,976
I hope that next year,

2889
02:45:11,206 --> 02:45:13,417
all 100 trainees on the show...

2890
02:45:14,117 --> 02:45:16,847
will make their debut somewhere.

2891
02:45:17,187 --> 02:45:19,256
And we'll get to perform together.

2892
02:45:19,257 --> 02:45:20,315
- I agree. - Yes.

2893
02:45:20,316 --> 02:45:22,036
I hope that we'll be more amazing than now.

2894
02:45:22,286 --> 02:45:23,357
That sounds good.

2895
02:45:23,956 --> 02:45:24,986
All right.

2896
02:45:27,597 --> 02:45:30,166
Isn't this our first time...

2897
02:45:30,167 --> 02:45:32,437
that 21 of us gathered for a talk?

2898
02:45:32,767 --> 02:45:33,795
You're right.

2899
02:45:33,796 --> 02:45:35,066
We should have tangerines.

2900
02:45:36,206 --> 02:45:38,106
- Good job, JEONGMIN. - You worked hard.

2901
02:45:38,107 --> 02:45:40,176
- Well done. - Well done, JEONGMIN.

2902
02:45:40,177 --> 02:45:42,106
(It's already time to sleep
after a lot of laughing.)

2903
02:45:42,107 --> 02:45:43,506
- SUNGMIN, - Sleep well.

2904
02:45:43,507 --> 02:45:46,016
- SEUNGHO... - KYOUNGBAE.

2905
02:45:46,017 --> 02:45:47,545
SUNGMIN, on your right.

2906
02:45:47,546 --> 02:45:50,917
(They wrote in the practice
journal at the end of each day.)

2907
02:45:55,626 --> 02:45:56,725
We finally became successful.

2908
02:45:56,726 --> 02:45:59,126
(What will they write in their
last practice journal entry?)

2909
02:46:01,126 --> 02:46:02,167
Look at this.

2910
02:46:02,796 --> 02:46:05,367
Some days, I wrote
a lot. I wrote a lot too.

2911
02:46:05,497 --> 02:46:06,635
In September...

2912
02:46:06,636 --> 02:46:08,966
I was a leader in the center.
It was for "LALALALA."

2913
02:46:10,767 --> 02:46:12,607
I had a sense of responsibility then.

2914
02:46:13,036 --> 02:46:14,236
It probably wasn't obvious.

2915
02:46:14,607 --> 02:46:16,405
"HYUNWOO brought a lot of energy,"

2916
02:46:16,406 --> 02:46:18,506
"so I expected his energy
to continue on stage."

2917
02:46:18,507 --> 02:46:19,546
Yes.

2918
02:46:19,947 --> 02:46:21,645
"I don't think I'm fit for being a leader."

2919
02:46:21,646 --> 02:46:23,045
(Inside their practice journal, )

2920
02:46:23,046 --> 02:46:24,446
(there's a record of their
memories up to now.)

2921
02:46:24,447 --> 02:46:26,956
"If I can be in the next
project, I won't be the leader."

2922
02:46:28,386 --> 02:46:30,655
Weren't you being too honest?

2923
02:46:30,656 --> 02:46:32,086
This isn't a journal.

2924
02:46:32,087 --> 02:46:34,197
- It's an autobiography.
- It was difficult.

2925
02:46:34,357 --> 02:46:35,456
What's this?

2926
02:46:37,226 --> 02:46:39,936
(The trainees read their
journal and recall their past.)

2927
02:46:39,937 --> 02:46:41,035
Time passed by fast.

2928
02:46:41,036 --> 02:46:43,507
(The trainees read their
journal and recall their past.)

2929
02:46:44,007 --> 02:46:45,036
It's done.

2930
02:46:46,736 --> 02:46:48,236
My handwriting looks so good.

2931
02:46:48,806 --> 02:46:51,447
"Tonight is our last
night in Project Village."

2932
02:46:51,947 --> 02:46:54,847
"We had 6 projects
during the last 4 months."

2933
02:46:55,247 --> 02:46:57,367
"Both internally and
externally, my skills improved."

2934
02:46:57,417 --> 02:47:01,117
"I also matured a lot as a person."

2935
02:47:01,687 --> 02:47:04,357
"It seems like the second
turning point in my life."

2936
02:47:05,087 --> 02:47:08,056
"For me, 2024 was spent on PROJECT 7."

2937
02:47:08,257 --> 02:47:10,496
"Two hundred trainees..."

2938
02:47:10,497 --> 02:47:12,566
"and staff members, you worked very hard."

2939
02:47:13,966 --> 02:47:15,367
Thank you.

2940
02:47:16,507 --> 02:47:18,136
It was really moving.

2941
02:47:19,007 --> 02:47:20,007
(Snoring)

2942
02:47:21,906 --> 02:47:23,607
Now that I'm about to start...

2943
02:47:24,777 --> 02:47:26,917
- He's starting now. - He's starting now.

2944
02:47:28,146 --> 02:47:29,146
Here I go.

2945
02:47:30,216 --> 02:47:31,587
"I was busy today."

2946
02:47:32,017 --> 02:47:34,417
(Laughing)

2947
02:47:34,757 --> 02:47:36,285
"We had a talk that
we've been waiting for..."

2948
02:47:36,286 --> 02:47:37,786
"during the pajama party."

2949
02:47:38,056 --> 02:47:40,196
"The award ceremony made me realize..."

2950
02:47:40,197 --> 02:47:42,367
"that this is really the last time."

2951
02:47:42,867 --> 02:47:45,096
"The next time 21 of us gather again..."

2952
02:47:45,097 --> 02:47:47,097
"will be right before the performance."

2953
02:47:47,497 --> 02:47:48,565
"It makes me sad."

2954
02:47:48,566 --> 02:47:51,666
"I hope that everyone's
practice goes well until the 27th..."

2955
02:47:51,667 --> 02:47:54,136
"without getting injured."

2956
02:47:54,337 --> 02:47:56,446
"I also hope that the performance..."

2957
02:47:56,447 --> 02:47:58,545
"of the remaining three teams
will turn out to be their best."

2958
02:47:58,546 --> 02:48:00,017
"Good luck, everyone."

2959
02:48:00,976 --> 02:48:02,517
- You can do it. - Let's go.

2960
02:48:02,847 --> 02:48:03,986
We can do it.

2961
02:48:04,386 --> 02:48:06,356
"The practice journal that
started on September 6..."

2962
02:48:06,357 --> 02:48:08,216
"reached its end."

2963
02:48:08,357 --> 02:48:10,986
"Each of us had a different life..."

2964
02:48:11,257 --> 02:48:13,857
"before joining PROJECT
7 with one goal in mind."

2965
02:48:14,226 --> 02:48:17,396
"Only 21 out of 200 trainees remain now."

2966
02:48:18,126 --> 02:48:20,936
"I met many different friends,
sang and danced with them."

2967
02:48:20,937 --> 02:48:23,206
"It was very hard, but I was happy."

2968
02:48:23,507 --> 02:48:24,866
"I learned many things."

2969
02:48:24,867 --> 02:48:28,206
"I also met good
people in Project Village."

2970
02:48:28,607 --> 02:48:30,876
"I will never forget this place."

2971
02:48:31,306 --> 02:48:33,546
"Now, it's time for us to leave..."

2972
02:48:33,677 --> 02:48:36,786
"and show how amazing we
can be in the bigger world."

2973
02:48:36,917 --> 02:48:38,687
"I didn't vacate because I was nervous."

2974
02:48:38,986 --> 02:48:41,955
"The thought of vacating
after surviving until the end..."

2975
02:48:41,956 --> 02:48:43,687
"makes me feel proud of myself."

2976
02:48:43,927 --> 02:48:47,257
"I'd like to say to the 21
trainees that they worked hard."

2977
02:48:47,726 --> 02:48:50,026
"There were both sad and happy days."

2978
02:48:50,027 --> 02:48:52,896
"I want to thank myself
for overcoming them."

2979
02:48:53,167 --> 02:48:55,866
"Let's make our final
performance amazing..."

2980
02:48:55,867 --> 02:48:57,536
"and unforgettable."

2981
02:48:57,706 --> 02:49:00,606
"When there's a start,
there's always an end."

2982
02:49:00,607 --> 02:49:02,375
"After my experience here,"

2983
02:49:02,376 --> 02:49:04,906
"I think I can do well anything anywhere."

2984
02:49:05,146 --> 02:49:08,077
"I feel sad that this is our last day."

2985
02:49:08,447 --> 02:49:10,485
"We went through many difficult..."

2986
02:49:10,486 --> 02:49:13,586
"and joyful times, and I enjoyed them all."

2987
02:49:13,587 --> 02:49:15,956
"This experience has been very precious."

2988
02:49:16,486 --> 02:49:18,285
"I made many friends."

2989
02:49:18,286 --> 02:49:20,956
"I learned and grew a lot too."

2990
02:49:21,456 --> 02:49:25,197
"It will be the last day
and our last time together."

2991
02:49:25,427 --> 02:49:30,306
"I hope to achieve what I
want to do in the future."

2992
02:49:30,607 --> 02:49:31,607
"I can do it."

2993
02:49:31,608 --> 02:49:33,106
"It's a message..."

2994
02:49:33,107 --> 02:49:35,236
"to myself now and in the future."

2995
02:49:35,376 --> 02:49:38,177
"From the first step I
took in the hot summer,"

2996
02:49:38,206 --> 02:49:40,276
"difficult days started."

2997
02:49:40,277 --> 02:49:41,315
It looks so pretty.

2998
02:49:41,316 --> 02:49:45,347
(PROJECT 7 trainees took their
first step during the hot summer.)

2999
02:49:46,286 --> 02:49:48,316
"After a long journey, PROJECT 7 is..."

3000
02:49:48,617 --> 02:49:50,587
"coming to an end in the cold winter."

3001
02:49:51,556 --> 02:49:53,496
"Every day had been difficult."

3002
02:49:53,497 --> 02:49:54,737
(Days that weren't always easy)

3003
02:49:55,027 --> 02:49:57,396
"Trainees who overcame
the hardship together."

3004
02:49:57,827 --> 02:49:59,267
"I'd simply like to say this."

3005
02:50:00,837 --> 02:50:02,167
"Well done, everyone."

3006
02:50:02,337 --> 02:50:03,705
"December 21, 2024."

3007
02:50:03,706 --> 02:50:05,406
"KYOUNGBAE who loves everyone."

3008
02:50:07,177 --> 02:50:08,205
That was great.

3009
02:50:08,206 --> 02:50:10,106
- We wrote a letter to us. - That's insane.

3010
02:50:10,107 --> 02:50:12,917
I have affections for you too.

3011
02:50:13,976 --> 02:50:15,177
- I love you. - "Affections?"

3012
02:50:19,257 --> 02:50:26,097
(PROJECT 7 practice journal
is completed up to the last page.)

3013
02:50:26,726 --> 02:50:29,667
For the final performance, we
should take care of ourselves.

3014
02:50:29,927 --> 02:50:32,326
JIWOON, could you say something?

3015
02:50:32,327 --> 02:50:33,597
Here we go.

3016
02:50:35,036 --> 02:50:36,065
Sleep well.

3017
02:50:36,066 --> 02:50:37,735
Sleep well. Sweet dreams.

3018
02:50:37,736 --> 02:50:39,635
(It's really time to fall asleep.)

3019
02:50:39,636 --> 02:50:41,756
- Sweet dreams, everyone.
- I can't sleep right away.

3020
02:50:43,947 --> 02:50:45,747
My goodness.

3021
02:50:47,376 --> 02:50:49,077
Goodnight, everyone.

3022
02:50:50,886 --> 02:50:54,886
(Their last night, another
unforgettable memory)

3023
02:51:03,597 --> 02:51:06,437
This is live PROJECT 7.

3024
02:51:07,337 --> 02:51:11,636
The real-time global voting has ended.

3025
02:51:14,306 --> 02:51:16,146

3026
02:51:16,947 --> 02:51:20,046

Tonight,

3030
02:51:30,486 --> 02:51:34,556

their debut will be decided.

3031

3032
02:51:43,066 --> 02:51:45,736
the real-time global voting score,

3033
02:51:45,906 --> 02:51:47,007
and...

3034
02:51:48,077 --> 02:51:49,906
the directors' scores will be totaled...

3035
02:51:50,206 --> 02:51:52,546

only seven of them will make
their debut dream come true.

3063

3064
02:54:53,456 --> 02:54:55,857
the 14 trainees who won't get selected...

3065
02:54:56,527 --> 02:55:00,066

one of those who almost didn't make...

3092
02:57:01,556 --> 02:57:03,886
the cut.

3093
02:57:18,806 --> 02:57:20,206
During today's Final Match,

his facial expression was perfect.

3095
02:57:23,447 --> 02:57:25,777
It completed the performance.

3096
02:57:41,827 --> 02:57:44,497
One word that describes...

3097
02:57:44,667 --> 02:57:47,466
this trainee would be "passion."

3098
02:57:48,697 --> 02:57:51,806

eighth during the interim check.

3127
03:00:17,087 --> 03:00:18,347
That's why...

3128
03:00:20,556 --> 03:00:22,156
I didn't prepare my speech...

3129
03:00:22,517 --> 03:00:24,786
as not to expect anything.

3130
03:00:26,257 --> 03:00:27,296

on PROJECT 7?

3222
03:07:45,726 --> 03:07:48,895
Actually, I hadn't performed much on stage.

3223
03:07:48,896 --> 03:07:51,036
No, I nearly had zero experience.

3224
03:07:51,667 --> 03:07:53,636
At first, I was really nervous.

3225
03:07:54,107 --> 03:07:55,805

on the first night here...

3308
03:14:43,046 --> 03:14:44,923
as he wasn't familiar with
the place and was tired.

3309
03:14:44,947 --> 03:14:48,417
But he grew strong in no time...

3310
03:14:48,617 --> 03:14:50,826
and became someone who could console...

3311
03:14:50,827 --> 03:14:54,097

and I'm proud of him for that.

3312

03:15:52,546 --> 03:15:57,056
In every project, he
showed off his presence.

3319
03:15:59,757 --> 03:16:02,237
Even during difficult times, he
didn't show he was struggling.

3320
03:16:04,626 --> 03:16:06,566
He quietly held out...

3321
03:16:07,466 --> 03:16:10,466
and became even stronger.

He was chosen as the
trainee who'd certainly debut.

03:31:40,497 --> 03:31:43,197

3493
03:31:44,337 --> 03:31:46,267
of 6,004,528.

3494
03:31:56,777 --> 03:32:01,117
He has received a score of 6,004,528.

3495
03:32:16,066 --> 03:32:19,107
It's Trainee MAJINGXIANG. Congratulations.

3496
03:32:19,466 --> 03:32:23,336
(MAJINGXIANG is the
1st-place winner of the final top 7.)

3497
03:32:23,337 --> 03:32:27,805
(MAJINGXIANG is the
1st-place winner of the final top 7.)

3498
03:32:27,806 --> 03:32:31,616
MAJINGXIANG practiced day and night...

3499
03:32:31,617 --> 03:32:34,187
to improve more each time,

3500
03:32:34,747 --> 03:32:36,656
and like his signature greeting,

3501
03:32:37,156 --> 03:32:39,926
"To the top,"

3502
03:32:39,927 --> 03:32:41,285
(MAJINGXIANG, to the top)

3503
03:32:41,286 --> 03:32:44,456
he has reached the top at last.

3504
03:32:47,267 --> 03:32:48,296
Congratulations.

3505
03:32:48,636 --> 03:32:50,512
We'll look forward to
seeing your new charms...

3506
03:32:50,536 --> 03:32:53,036
which you will show as
part of CLOSE YOUR EYES.

3507
03:32:58,077 --> 03:33:03,617
(MAJINGXIANG, to the top)

3508
03:33:11,386 --> 03:33:12,726
Trainee MAJINGXIANG,

3509
03:33:14,527 --> 03:33:18,867
you've achieved your dream to
debut as the first-place winner.

3510
03:33:19,267 --> 03:33:20,697
Please say a word.

3511
03:33:21,126 --> 03:33:22,197
Okay.

3512
03:33:25,337 --> 03:33:27,166
I love you so much,

3513
03:33:27,167 --> 03:33:29,337
World Assemblers.

3514
03:33:30,077 --> 03:33:32,806
Mom, I love you too.

3515
03:33:33,077 --> 03:33:37,117
She's watching this right here today.

3516
03:33:38,046 --> 03:33:39,187
Mom.

3517
03:33:40,986 --> 03:33:42,156
I love you.

3518
03:33:43,656 --> 03:33:45,027
And...

3519
03:33:45,956 --> 03:33:48,226
I actually...

3520
03:33:49,257 --> 03:33:51,656
- Well... - You can feel free...

3521
03:33:51,896 --> 03:33:54,026
to speak to your mother in Chinese.

3522
03:33:54,027 --> 03:33:55,065
Sure.

3523
03:33:55,066 --> 03:33:58,096
Since a year ago,

3524
03:33:58,097 --> 03:34:01,905
I've wanted to make a debut.

3525
03:34:01,906 --> 03:34:03,976
But at that time,

3526
03:34:06,947 --> 03:34:08,975
I wasn't good enough...

3527
03:34:08,976 --> 03:34:13,116
to achieve my dream.

3528
03:34:13,117 --> 03:34:14,486
I was truly sorry for it.

3529
03:34:15,716 --> 03:34:16,757
So,

3530
03:34:17,587 --> 03:34:21,757
I'd like to say to my fans
and World Assemblers...

3531
03:34:22,056 --> 03:34:26,626
who have supported me
that I love them so much.

3532
03:34:27,767 --> 03:34:31,497
I always tell them that I'm sorry.

3533
03:34:32,136 --> 03:34:34,837
Whenever I check the Internet,

3534
03:34:35,607 --> 03:34:37,405
they always tell me not to get intimidated.

3535
03:34:37,406 --> 03:34:40,276
So I'm not going to cry today.

3536
03:34:40,277 --> 03:34:43,177
I'm going to make a happy smile today.

3537
03:34:43,816 --> 03:34:48,386
And my wish is for World Assemblers...

3538
03:34:48,886 --> 03:34:52,956
to be healthy and happy every day.

3539
03:34:53,386 --> 03:34:58,327
I'd also like to meet World
Assemblers every day.

3540
03:35:00,697 --> 03:35:02,597
To the top.

3541
03:35:02,997 --> 03:35:06,306
Please remember my name. I love you.

3542
03:35:08,036 --> 03:35:10,337
Now,

3543
03:35:11,236 --> 03:35:14,406
I'd like to say a word in Chinese.

3544
03:35:41,236 --> 03:35:42,276
I love you.

3545
03:35:42,277 --> 03:35:45,107
I'm not so good at speaking Japanese,

3546
03:35:45,976 --> 03:35:48,917
but I'll learn a lot from KENSHIN.

3547
03:35:49,447 --> 03:35:50,517
I'm sorry.

3548
03:35:51,117 --> 03:35:55,857
And I'd like to give
thanks to the directors...

3549
03:35:56,456 --> 03:35:58,785
for supporting and helping me...

3550
03:35:58,786 --> 03:36:03,796
whenever I was struggling.

3551
03:36:04,027 --> 03:36:05,296
I love you so much.

3552
03:36:05,896 --> 03:36:08,767
And the production crew.

3553
03:36:09,597 --> 03:36:11,666
The producers and scriptwriters...

3554
03:36:11,667 --> 03:36:15,837
always had meals with us every day.

3555
03:36:16,507 --> 03:36:19,146
We met and spent time together every day.

3556
03:36:19,706 --> 03:36:23,646
Actually, I was in bad condition yesterday.

3557
03:36:23,816 --> 03:36:25,146
I was very sick.

3558
03:36:25,587 --> 03:36:29,357
And the production crew...

3559
03:36:29,486 --> 03:36:32,427
looked after me as if I was their family.

3560
03:36:32,786 --> 03:36:36,455
Now that I did the best I
could and got to make a debut...

3561
03:36:36,456 --> 03:36:38,867
through PROJECT 7,

3562
03:36:41,367 --> 03:36:44,836
I'd like to send thanks and
love to the production crew.

3563
03:36:44,837 --> 03:36:49,107
(MAJINGXIANG,
congratulations on your debut.)

3564
03:36:50,577 --> 03:36:52,146
Congratulations once again.

3565
03:36:53,476 --> 03:36:54,806
And with a final score...

3566
03:36:55,146 --> 03:37:00,146
of 5,107,798,

3567
03:37:01,017 --> 03:37:03,087
Trainee SAKURADA KENSHIN...

3568
03:37:04,117 --> 03:37:06,586
placed second.

3569
03:37:06,587 --> 03:37:08,186
(SAKURADA KENSHIN is...)

3570
03:37:08,187 --> 03:37:09,867
(the 2nd-place winner of the final top 7.)

3571
03:37:11,896 --> 03:37:13,866
SAKURADA KENSHIN has the charm...

3572
03:37:13,867 --> 03:37:16,096
of making everyone smile...

3573
03:37:16,097 --> 03:37:18,706
with his positive energy
which no one can refuse.

3574
03:37:18,966 --> 03:37:20,866
Throughout the show,

3575
03:37:20,867 --> 03:37:24,176
he has been adored by everyone.

3576
03:37:24,177 --> 03:37:26,846
(KENSHIN, I love you forever.)

3577
03:37:26,847 --> 03:37:28,815
(KENSHIN)

3578
03:37:28,816 --> 03:37:30,416
I'll support him to be an idol singer...

3579
03:37:30,917 --> 03:37:33,687
who delivers happiness
through amazing performances.

3580
03:37:35,716 --> 03:37:38,985
Now, let's hear a word...

3581
03:37:38,986 --> 03:37:41,257
from the second-place
winner, SAKURADA KENSHIN.

3582
03:37:42,296 --> 03:37:43,326
Yes.

3583
03:37:43,327 --> 03:37:44,395
(2nd, SAKURADA KENSHIN)

3584
03:37:44,396 --> 03:37:45,795
Dear World Assemblers,

3585
03:37:45,796 --> 03:37:49,566
thank you so much for your votes.

3586
03:37:50,697 --> 03:37:52,437
There's a story...

3587
03:37:53,367 --> 03:37:57,736
I'd like to share with you.

3588
03:37:58,376 --> 03:38:01,246
I'm not so good at Korean yet,

3589
03:38:01,247 --> 03:38:06,587
so let me read this slowly.

3590
03:38:14,757 --> 03:38:18,027
Until two years ago...

3591
03:38:19,697 --> 03:38:20,796
when I was...

3592
03:38:22,197 --> 03:38:23,767
a freshman in high school,

3593
03:38:24,597 --> 03:38:29,436
I lived in Aomori...

3594
03:38:29,437 --> 03:38:35,376
located below Hokkaido of Japan.

3595
03:38:36,417 --> 03:38:40,785
At that time, I was
simply a high schooler...

3596
03:38:40,786 --> 03:38:43,716
who liked K-pop.

3597
03:38:44,617 --> 03:38:46,056
During my...

3598
03:38:47,327 --> 03:38:48,556
freshman...

3599
03:38:49,497 --> 03:38:51,656
During my freshman year,

3600
03:38:52,367 --> 03:38:58,197
something happened that changed me.

3601
03:39:06,406 --> 03:39:12,316
(KENSHIN)

3602
03:39:21,556 --> 03:39:26,427
In February of my
freshman year in high school,

3603
03:39:28,736 --> 03:39:31,367
my family...

3604
03:39:31,966 --> 03:39:37,406
suffered from a big fire accident.

3605
03:39:37,806 --> 03:39:39,406
A big fire accident.

3606
03:39:40,107 --> 03:39:45,316
Everything in our house
was burned to ashes.

3607
03:39:46,417 --> 03:39:48,786
The cause...

3608
03:39:49,687 --> 03:39:52,286
of the fire...

3609
03:39:52,886 --> 03:39:58,197
was the cables on the roof.

3610
03:39:59,327 --> 03:40:03,866
There was nothing...

3611
03:40:03,867 --> 03:40:10,607
our family could do to prevent it.

3612
03:40:11,077 --> 03:40:16,316
I couldn't take anything from the house.

3613
03:40:16,447 --> 03:40:21,386
Everything was burned to ashes.

3614
03:40:24,956 --> 03:40:26,357
Fortunately,

3615
03:40:27,187 --> 03:40:32,056
no one got hurt.

3616
03:40:33,427 --> 03:40:34,497
However...

3617
03:40:37,497 --> 03:40:40,205
But after that day,

3618
03:40:40,206 --> 03:40:46,476
I happened to lose my smile.

3619
03:40:48,206 --> 03:40:52,316
Just by seeing a flame, my body shook.

3620
03:40:53,286 --> 03:40:56,516
I felt lethargic...

3621
03:40:56,517 --> 03:41:00,456
and depressed.

3622
03:41:36,827 --> 03:41:41,526
But I didn't stop...

3623
03:41:41,527 --> 03:41:46,736
taking dance lessons...

3624
03:41:47,066 --> 03:41:50,706
because when I danced,

3625
03:41:51,337 --> 03:41:56,376
I could forget about the fire accident...

3626
03:41:56,917 --> 03:42:02,087
and enjoy that moment.

3627
03:42:15,197 --> 03:42:18,636
(KENSHIN)

3628
03:42:18,867 --> 03:42:20,337
(Please hug me.)

3629
03:42:21,466 --> 03:42:24,806
I realized...

3630
03:42:25,206 --> 03:42:31,347
how precious music was to me.

3631
03:42:31,417 --> 03:42:36,786
When I told my parents,

3632
03:42:37,587 --> 03:42:42,226
they suggested I take it more seriously.

3633
03:42:42,257 --> 03:42:44,926
So I dropped out of high school...

3634
03:42:44,927 --> 03:42:50,896
and joined a dance school in Tokyo alone.

3635
03:42:51,937 --> 03:42:56,236
After that, I happened...

3636
03:42:57,577 --> 03:43:00,706
to pass the audition...

3637
03:43:01,507 --> 03:43:06,316
and come to Korea alone.

3638
03:43:07,587 --> 03:43:10,316
My family...

3639
03:43:10,656 --> 03:43:14,257
must've worried...

3640
03:43:19,997 --> 03:43:24,197
a lot about me...

3641
03:43:24,937 --> 03:43:28,066
for chasing my dream alone.

3642
03:43:29,507 --> 03:43:33,577
But they trusted my smile...

3643
03:43:34,247 --> 03:43:37,517
and sent me here.

3644
03:44:16,486 --> 03:44:21,956
Throughout PROJECT 7,

3645
03:44:23,626 --> 03:44:29,337
I tried to smile as much as I could.

3646
03:44:30,597 --> 03:44:32,906
I wonder if I could deliver you...

3647
03:44:33,867 --> 03:44:40,046
how precious a smile is...

3648
03:44:40,876 --> 03:44:43,546
at least by a bit.

3649
03:44:55,556 --> 03:45:00,626
I hope your everyday life...

3650
03:45:02,697 --> 03:45:05,936
is full of what makes you smile.

3651
03:45:05,937 --> 03:45:09,876
I'll try my best...

3652
03:45:10,236 --> 03:45:16,077
to be an idol singer...

3653
03:45:16,947 --> 03:45:21,416
who always makes you smile.

3654
03:45:21,417 --> 03:45:26,056
I want to do that for you no matter what.

3655
03:45:26,757 --> 03:45:29,196
I'll keep doing my best.

3656
03:45:29,197 --> 03:45:30,896
(KENSHIN)

3657
03:45:34,267 --> 03:45:35,396
And...

3658
03:45:37,667 --> 03:45:40,607
I'd like to give thanks...

3659
03:45:43,306 --> 03:45:46,277
to the directors,

3660
03:45:46,806 --> 03:45:49,546
my family,

3661
03:45:50,677 --> 03:45:52,786
and the other trainees.

3662
03:45:58,216 --> 03:45:59,757
And...

3663
03:46:00,827 --> 03:46:05,097
I want to talk about my friend, ANDY.

3664
03:46:10,636 --> 03:46:13,466
During the Zero Setting,

3665
03:46:14,437 --> 03:46:19,577
I was on good terms with him at first.

3666
03:46:23,117 --> 03:46:25,347
I didn't know,

3667
03:46:26,247 --> 03:46:28,786
but ANDY...

3668
03:47:09,556 --> 03:47:11,757
I'll do the best I can. Thank you.

3669
03:47:14,296 --> 03:47:17,097
The two trainees achieved
their dream to make a debut.

3670
03:47:17,296 --> 03:47:19,367
Congratulations to you both.

3671
03:47:19,636 --> 03:47:22,267
Please sit down on the

3722
03:53:59,097 --> 03:54:02,035
Through PROJECT 7, he received...

3723
03:54:02,036 --> 03:54:05,976
dance and singing
lessons for the first time,

3724
03:54:06,546 --> 03:54:08,447
growing his dream to become an idol singer.

3725
03:54:08,777 --> 03:54:10,145
Each project,

3726
03:54:10,146 --> 03:54:11,146

03:54:11,147 --> 03:54:14,215
he constantly made hard efforts.

3728

(SUNGMIN, let's debut.)

3729
03:54:15,947 --> 03:54:20,357
As a result, he managed to improve
more than all the other trainees...

3730
03:54:20,757 --> 03:54:24,126
and safely made it to the debuting group.

3731
03:54:26,296 --> 03:54:27,626
He started from zero...

3732
03:54:28,796 --> 03:54:31,197
and came all the way up to making a debut.

3733
03:54:31,837 --> 03:54:32,867
Congratulations.

3734
03:54:34,206 --> 03:54:36,937

3735

(7th, KIM SUNGMIN)

3736
03:54:40,347 --> 03:54:42,776
I was named as an
elimination candidate earlier,

3737
03:54:42,777 --> 03:54:47,417
so when I performed "Antidote,"

3738
03:54:48,087 --> 03:54:52,087
I was worried if I was
getting the choreography right.

3739
03:54:52,617 --> 03:54:56,427
I wasn't sure if I could
pull off the performance.

3740
03:54:58,656 --> 03:55:02,566
Thank you for giving me this seventh place.

3741
03:55:02,667 --> 03:55:07,607
For supporting me to place seventh,

3742
03:55:08,107 --> 03:55:12,506
I'd like to give thanks to
the World Assemblers...

3743
03:55:12,507 --> 03:55:16,177

3745
03:55:19,947 --> 03:55:23,017
and sisters. I love you all.

3746
03:55:23,156 --> 03:55:26,016
My parents couldn't make
it here today due to work.

3747
03:55:26,017 --> 03:55:30,097
I'd like to say that I love them so much.

3748
03:55:30,357 --> 03:55:34,926
And the directors helped me a lot...

3749
03:55:34,927 --> 03:55:39,036
so I could improve. I love you so much!

3750
03:55:40,937 --> 03:55:44,876
Yesterday was my birthday.

3751
03:55:45,706 --> 03:55:49,077
For you,

3752
03:55:50,017 --> 03:55:54,786
I practiced with the other
trainees in the training room.

3753
03:55:55,117 --> 03:55:56,756
I wondered...

3754
03:55:56,757 --> 03:55:57,856
(KIMSUNGMIN is debuting.)

3755
03:55:57,857 --> 03:56:02,486
how excitingly I should spend my birthday.

3756
03:56:03,126 --> 03:56:05,895
The trainees, the scriptwriters,

3757
03:56:05,896 --> 03:56:08,367
and the producers...

3758
03:56:09,167 --> 03:56:13,306
said happy birthday to me
as soon as it turned midnight.

3759
03:56:13,566 --> 03:56:16,066
It was so touching.

3760
03:56:16,607 --> 03:56:21,145
I wanted a debut...

3761
03:56:21,146 --> 03:56:24,617
for my birthday present.

3762
03:56:25,117 --> 03:56:27,687

3763
03:56:28,087 --> 03:56:31,917
that I did get a debut...

3764

I love you all.

3767
03:56:42,427 --> 03:56:45,767
