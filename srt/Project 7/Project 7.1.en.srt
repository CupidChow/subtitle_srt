00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,250
Hello.

2
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,088
I'm here for the shoot...

3
00:00:17,089 --> 00:00:20,230
of the idol survival show called "Project 7."

4
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,429
This show has many features that set it apart from other shows,

5
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,399
so you can look forward to it.

6
00:00:28,969 --> 00:00:32,700
You may not have heard these in other survival shows.

7
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:36,109
They're assembly and enhancement.

8
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:40,909
These are the main keywords of "Project 7."

9
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,950
Most of all,

10
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,460
it's you who's watching this right now,

11
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,929
because you, World Assemblers, will be creating...

12
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,898
the most perfect boy group.

13
00:00:56,899 --> 00:00:57,899
(The birth of a perfect boy group)

14
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,170
Let me show you how.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,200
Just like the various figurines here,

16
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,640
you'll be choosing a combination...

17
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:15,579
among dozens of trainees gathered from around the world.

18
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,489
You will create the perfect chemistry...

19
00:01:22,219 --> 00:01:24,920
and build your very own world-class boy group.

20
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:31,128
The outcome will vary depending on how you assemble...

21
00:01:31,129 --> 00:01:32,399
and select the trainees.

22
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,400
(Their fate lies in your assembly.)

23
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:37,500
If you throw together a mix that doesn't fit,

24
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,670
it's bound to end up in chaos, right?

25
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:42,569
Stop acting like you're the victim here.

26
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,878
We can't go around talking about other people's passion.

27
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:47,150
Go ahead and be the leader.

28
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:51,549
But when you put together the perfect combination,

29
00:01:54,849 --> 00:01:56,620
you'll create a breathtaking harmony.

30
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:00,530
Doesn't that sound exciting?

31
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,760
You, the World Assemblers, will be involved...

32
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:05,799
in every step of this process from start to finish.

33
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:10,438
As you handpick and assemble...

34
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:11,740
these trainees,

35
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:16,609
they'll grow stronger as they overcome their limits.

36
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:17,780
(Upgrade)

37
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:19,639
In the end,

38
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:23,649
they'll come together...

39
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:24,650
(The most perfect boy group of 7)

40
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,650
as Project 7.

41
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:37,099
Dear World Assemblers, are you ready?

42
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:45,300
(The birth of the most perfect boy group)

43
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:50,710
(Their journey begins now.)

44
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,460
To assemble and upgrade.

45
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,199
A massive survival audition to create...

46
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,469
the ultimate world-class boy group,

47
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:19,270
"Project 7."

48
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,569
From this moment on,

49
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:27,409
global K-pop fans who are watching the rise of "Project 7..."

50
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:32,449
will be known as World Assemblers.

51
00:03:34,689 --> 00:03:36,348
The different combinations...

52
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:39,020
created by World Assemblers within "Project 7..."

53
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:43,129
will have a major impact on the trainees' survival,

54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,900
elimination, and even their debut.

55
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:53,139
Now, let's meet the trainees who will be assembled, upgraded,

56
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:57,110
and reborn as world-class idols...

57
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,139
at the palm of the fans.

58
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,910
Assemble your very own idols. Let's assemble.

59
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:33,139
"Project 7" begins now.

60
00:04:40,649 --> 00:04:42,750
Dear trainees of "Project 7,"

61
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,959
greet our World Assemblers.

62
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:50,560
- We'll do our best! - We'll do our best!

63
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,329
- We'll do our best! - We'll do our best!

64
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,709
Assemble and upgrade.

65
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,938
Welcome to "Project 7," where a new world-class boy group will be born.

66
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:06,939
(The first global voting will end on November 2nd at 7am.)

67
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,110
Dear World Assemblers,

68
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,479
The first global vote...

69
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,250
for "Project 7" starts now.

70
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,490
You can vote on the official "Project 7" voting platform...

71
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,759
once a day.

72
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,758
Go to the "Project 7" forum...

73
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,259
and click the voting link...

74
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,759
in order to participate in two rounds of voting.

75
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,069
First is the individual vote.

76
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:32,939
Choose 7 out of 100 trainees to show your support.

77
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:35,068
After the individual vote,

78
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:37,379
click on "proceed to next vote."

79
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,680
Next is the assembly vote.

80
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:42,078
Select 14 trainees...

81
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:44,350
you want to see assembled as your ideal group.

82
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:47,589
Click "vote" to complete your vote.

83
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,258
Your vote is only counted after you complete both rounds,

84
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:52,990
so make sure to participate in both votes.

85
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,189
Now, for the first global vote.

86
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,199
Three,

87
00:05:59,029 --> 00:06:00,100
two,

88
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:01,629
one.

89
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:03,599
Let us begin.

90
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,339
(Voting starts now until November 2nd at 7am)

91
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,239
Hello, trainees.

92
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,410
I'm Lee Soo Hyuk, your host for "Project 7."

93
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,350
You're so cool!

94
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,350
I love his voice.

95
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,560
He's so good-looking. It's incredible.

96
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:28,959
He looked like a sculpture.

97
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,999
He looked like a handsome vampire.

98
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,170
When he walked in, I thought he was an elf or something.

99
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:38,939
Today, we have 200 trainees gathered here...

100
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,568
ready to be assembled and upgraded into world-class idols.

101
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:42,708
(A total of 200 idols in one place!)

102
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:44,639
These trainees...

103
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,109
come not only from Korea,

104
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:49,679
but also from China, Hong Kong, the United States,

105
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,979
Australia, Ukraine, Japan,

106
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,819
the Philippines, Thailand, and Malaysia.

107
00:06:57,019 --> 00:06:59,860
They have come from all around the world.

108
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,489
How did they manage to gather 200 trainees?

109
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,898
I've never seen 200 trainees at once like this.

110
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:08,198
They were all tall, good-looking,

111
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:10,399
and more talented than me.

112
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,399
I felt like there was a wall between me and them.

113
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:15,370
They all seemed like rivals to me.

114
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:18,338
The trainees will go through...

115
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:21,149
a total of six projects.

116
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:24,518
Throughout this journey, the World Assemblers will watch...

117
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:27,120
and vote for the trainees they support.

118
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:29,588
Those who successfully complete the assembly and upgrade process...

119
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:32,188
through the voting rounds without being eliminated...

120
00:07:32,189 --> 00:07:33,930
will have the chance to debut...

121
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:38,128
as a world-class boy group through "Project 7."

122
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:39,229
(Making the debut as a world-class boy group)

123
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:44,138
So how many of the 200 trainees gathered here can make their debut?

124
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:45,438
(How many among the 200?)

125
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:48,509
Only seven trainees who successfully complete...

126
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:51,278
the assembly and upgrade process through the global voting...

127
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:53,410
will be selected as the final members.

128
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:56,208
- Seven? - That's harsh.

129
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,850
- That's so few. - It's a perfect number.

130
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,079
Only seven out of everyone here?

131
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:03,149
I thought about how many people I had to compete with.

132
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:06,019
This show was going to be harder than I thought.

133
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,659
The 200 trainees gathered here...

134
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,759
will experience the unique training system of "Project 7..."

135
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:16,899
designed to help them develop world-class skills.

136
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,698
Now, let me introduce the directors of "Project 7..."

137
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:22,338
who will be guiding you as you train, practice, and grow...

138
00:08:22,339 --> 00:08:25,239
on your journey to become the top idols.

139
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,379
(The directors of "Project 7")

140
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:33,179
Is that Bada?

141
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:36,220
That's the leader of the Auspicious Crew.

142
00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:38,259
Oh, my. That's Ha Sung Woon.

143
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:41,029
This is crazy.

144
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,889
It's Lee Hae In!

145
00:08:44,929 --> 00:08:46,259
What a crazy lineup.

146
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,029
They're all legendary.

147
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,340
This is it.

148
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,609
We have assembled only the very best directors...

149
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,639
who will bring out your potential to the maximum.

150
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:00,179
I'm Ryan Jhun, and I'm the Music Director.

151
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:03,048
(His top hits include "Kick It" and "Sticker" by NCT127,)

152
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:06,219
("ELEVEN" and "LOVE DIVE" by IVE,)

153
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,148
("LOVE ME RIGHT" and "Obsession" by EXO,)

154
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:13,019
(and "View" and "Lucifer" by SHINee.)

155
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,428
I have 15 years of production in K-pop,

156
00:09:17,429 --> 00:09:20,329
so I'm going to share my tips drawn from those experiences.

157
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,699
I'm Lee Hae In, the Creative Director...

158
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,768
for "Project 7."

159
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:27,369
I've only participated in auditions as a trainee,

160
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:30,839
but it feels different to participate as a director.

161
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,378
When I got to direct KISS OF LIFE,

162
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:38,018
I knew I'd be able to bring out each of their unique strengths.

163
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:42,788
I also think it's the director's job to see beyond their potential.

164
00:09:42,789 --> 00:09:46,220
So I want to help the trainees bring out their maximum charms.

165
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:48,288
I'm Bada, the Dance Director.

166
00:09:48,289 --> 00:09:50,259
I'm RyuD, the Dance Director.

167
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:53,100
(RyuD is the leader of the Auspicious dance crew.)

168
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,629
(Bada is the leader of the BEBE dance crew,)

169
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:59,799
(which won first place in "Street Woman Fighter.")

170
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,038
(They made legendary choreographies for countless songs.)

171
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:07,479
With my experience in working with various artists,

172
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,719
I'll make sure they get compliments that they're great dancers.

173
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,219
As a director, I'm confident that I can upgrade them.

174
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:19,659
I'll share my tips with them and do the best I can.

175
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:22,289
Hi, I'm Ha Sung Woon, the Vocal Director.

176
00:10:22,629 --> 00:10:25,330
(He started as the main vocalist for Wanna One...)

177
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:28,869
(and is now known as an all-rounder artist.)

178
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:31,939
Hello, everyone.

179
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,339
As a fellow trainee and artist...

180
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,668
who successfully made my debut through a survival show,

181
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:38,878
I have come to root for you and help you make your debut.

182
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:41,079
As the survival goes on,

183
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,479
you won't find yourself in a lot of favourable circumstances.

184
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,548
As long as you show your best in whatever situation you're in,

185
00:10:48,549 --> 00:10:50,589
I'm sure you'll make it to your debut.

186
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:51,590
Good luck!

187
00:10:51,591 --> 00:10:52,860
- Thank you! - Thank you!

188
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:55,629
We'll do our best.

189
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,199
Good luck.

190
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,059
(Sooner or later)

191
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:02,570
(Searching for trainees like a diamond in the rough)

192
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,069
You know what I'm thinking, seeing you guys all nervous?

193
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,340
It's embarrassing.

194
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:07,809
(It's disturbing.)

195
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:10,539
(Their keen feedbacks are coming soon...)

196
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,909
(based on their strict and high standards.)

197
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:19,850
Let me show you the first project that the trainees will be taking on.

198
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,960
The first project...

199
00:11:25,659 --> 00:11:27,659
to become a global idol group is...

200
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,200
Zero Setting.

201
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:37,439
(Zero Setting)

202
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,539
Zero Setting?

203
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,610
Zero Setting?

204
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:43,440
Well, I know zero coke.

205
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,309
Zero is the trend these days.

206
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,379
In Zero Setting,

207
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:52,620
your training period, debut career, and agencies...

208
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,490
won't matter at all.

209
00:11:54,889 --> 00:11:59,889
All 200 trainees will start off with the same rank.

210
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,460
So we'll be competing regardless of our rankings.

211
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,100
So that's why it's called zero.

212
00:12:04,929 --> 00:12:10,840
It's a totally different setting from previous survival shows.

213
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,710
I couldn't find the area where the judges would sit.

214
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:19,440
But it didn't seem like we were going to perform in the center.

215
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:22,080
I was wondering how it would take place.

216
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:24,980
There are four booths here.

217
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,850
So that's what the doors were for.

218
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:31,959
(Four booths located in each corner)

219
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:36,230
Each director will be waiting in their respective booths.

220
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:38,898
You will enter the booth...

221
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:42,298
and show your performance as best as you can.

222
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:44,138
(Judging their performance inside the booths)

223
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:45,269
Oh, my gosh.

224
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:47,440
I have goosebumps.

225
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,070
So we're not doing it here.

226
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,038
Are we doing it inside?

227
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:55,179
We'll be performing inside the booth like an audition.

228
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,110
Right in front of them?

229
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:00,450
If I meet Bada, I'll be dancing to "Smoke" in front of her.

230
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,250
Then I guess the performances will be shown.

231
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:07,559
(While the judging takes place simultaneously,)

232
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:12,360
(the performances will be broadcast live.)

233
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,569
Once the performance is over, the directors will evaluate

234
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:16,898
each trainee based on their debut readiness,

235
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:18,469
which reflects their potential

236
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,470
for the final upgrade after the assembly.

237
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,039
You've passed.

238
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:27,240
They will classify them as passed, deferred, or failed.

239
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,250
I'd like to mention one more thing.

240
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:31,720
In the case of those who entered as a team,

241
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,418
team members might receive different results...

242
00:13:35,419 --> 00:13:38,090
and there might be team members who get eliminated.

243
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,519
So even if four of us enter,

244
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,929
only one might get eliminated.

245
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:43,690
Only I might get eliminated.

246
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:46,599
And you need to prove your possibility...

247
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,970
to be assembled and reinforced by World Assemblers.

248
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,408
The trainees who were judged not enough to be assembled...

249
00:13:54,409 --> 00:13:56,039
as a result of Zero Setting,

250
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:59,109
will be sent home right away today.

251
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,950
(Those who lost the chance to be assembled will be sent home today.)

252
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:03,008
How can we leave in one day?

253
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,149
I just got here today.

254
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,519
It's possible that we get eliminated on the day we came.

255
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,590
It's so cruel.

256
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:11,820
We can do this. Don't sigh.

257
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:13,419
We can do it.

258
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,089
Among the 200 people gathered here,

259
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,628
how many trainees will get a chance...

260
00:14:17,629 --> 00:14:20,730
to survive Zero Setting and continue to challenge...

261
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:23,230
to be world-class idols?

262
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:25,669
Have they set the number for that?

263
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:27,370
I guess it's 190 people.

264
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:29,039
It'd be 150 people.

265
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,909
I guess it's a multiple of seven.

266
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,038
The number of trainees who can continue to challenge...

267
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,580
(The number of survivors of Zero Setting...)

268
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,620
is 100.

269
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,549
(is only 100.)

270
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:46,320
- It's a 50 percent chance. - Half.

271
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:47,789
Half of the people here are going home?

272
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:50,759
Two of the seats here will be torn down.

273
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:52,559
They're eliminating half on the first day.

274
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,799
Half of us will disappear.

275
00:14:55,129 --> 00:14:56,629
Among 200 trainees,

276
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:00,799
who will survive and who will leave this place?

277
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,539
Now, we'll begin the first project,

278
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,649
Zero Setting.

279
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:18,159
Forget your gentle look. Bring out the survival eyes.

280
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:21,359
- Let's go. - Three of us can make it.

281
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,189
Do you think we'll be three of the hundred people?

282
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,190
We can do this.

283
00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:25,999
Zero Setting...

284
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,669
is the project that I can show everything I've got.

285
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:32,070
(A voice and one chance)

286
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,269
- We have the main vocalist. - He's the main vocalist.

287
00:15:38,179 --> 00:15:40,279
(Show your dance.)

288
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:42,980
This is it.

289
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,519
(That's quite nice.)

290
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:50,990
(One more trainee with a nice look)

291
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,518
(You're good-looking.)

292
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:53,619
(Expressing favour by blinking)

293
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,529
I think he's a gem.

294
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,230
(I can support him with my own money if I have to.)

295
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:01,100
(Among 200 shining gems,)

296
00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:04,129
(who will be the 100 survivors?)

297
00:16:04,299 --> 00:16:06,898
I've been a singer for four years...

298
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,240
and if I'm not selected among 100 people here,

299
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,908
I'm not qualified to be a singer.

300
00:16:10,909 --> 00:16:12,638
I don't think it matters.

301
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,610
I'm going to do well anyway.

302
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:17,779
I'll show that good things come in small packages.

303
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:21,549
Are they starting now?

304
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,289
I'm so scared.

305
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,719
(In a very tense atmosphere)

306
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,389
I can do this.

307
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:31,830
Is that the dance director's booth?

308
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,768
I'm not sure which room is which.

309
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:36,428
(They're most curious about which director they'd meet.)

310
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:37,669
If I have a choice,

311
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,539
I want to be evaluated by Bada.

312
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,539
If only I had a choice.

313
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,409
I think we'll meet Ha Sung Woon.

314
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:48,980
That thought makes me nervous. My heart is racing.

315
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:55,289
It's very nice here. They can warm up their voices.

316
00:16:56,019 --> 00:16:57,690
Back then, I didn't have a chance to warm up my voice.

317
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,830
- You didn't? - It was so quiet and solemn.

318
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:03,629
Hello.

319
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:06,058
(Suddenly, a familiar face enters.)

320
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:08,170
- Hello. - Hello.

321
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:10,670
- Hello. - Hello.

322
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:15,169
(MIYEON from (G)I-DLE in the directors' booth?)

323
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:17,309
Is this your first time as a judge?

324
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,508
I'm so nervous.

325
00:17:20,509 --> 00:17:21,749
- It's the same for us too. - Same here.

326
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,109
- Really? - Yes.

327
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,920
(Special Directors are in each booth.)

328
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,149
(Director Ryan Sewon Jhun's booth)

329
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:33,618
It's my first time being a judge in this kind of audition.

330
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:36,789
- Really? - I think it'd be more nervous here.

331
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:40,328
(Director Lee Hae In's booth)

332
00:17:40,329 --> 00:17:42,699
- I'm doing this again. - I know.

333
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,268
You were in "Produce 101" in the past.

334
00:17:45,269 --> 00:17:47,838
It was hard to judge 100 people, and now it's 200.

335
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:49,440
What's your standard to judge, usually?

336
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:50,740
They need to be competent.

337
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,949
(Director Bada's booth)

338
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,848
- Why do I feel nervous? - The air feels heavy.

339
00:17:58,849 --> 00:17:59,980
(Moonbyul and Yoo Hwe Seung)

340
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,190
It's making me more nervous because the booth is like a room.

341
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:06,558
Is the test going on separately in each room?

342
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:07,559
Yes.

343
00:18:08,089 --> 00:18:09,960
What are you going to focus on?

344
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,130
For me, how desperate they are.

345
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:15,029
I can tell who's desperate at a glance.

346
00:18:15,769 --> 00:18:18,500
I think the possibility is very important.

347
00:18:18,569 --> 00:18:19,669
You mean the possibility of growth?

348
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,769
- Potential matters. - Right.

349
00:18:22,069 --> 00:18:25,839
I think members with a character are needed in a team.

350
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,679
I think for the first one to be evaluated,

351
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:32,219
it's hard to set a standard.

352
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,220
Right.

353
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,149
The first one might feel more nervous.

354
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,219
(The directors' attention is focused on the first person.)

355
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,220
Of course.

356
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,789
The first one among 200 people.

357
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,160
- I hope I'm not the first one. - Really?

358
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:49,099
Number one, LEE HANBIN.

359
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,399
- Stop it. - Really?

360
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,470
I'm scared.

361
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,768
Why do I feel nervous all of a sudden?

362
00:18:53,769 --> 00:18:55,809
My heart is pounding so much.

363
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:59,609
I feel like my heart is going to burst.

364
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:07,649
(The first one to go is revealed.)

365
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,150
- That surprised me. - Oh, my.

366
00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:11,289
That surprised me.

367
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:15,028
(Who's going to be the first one to perform?)

368
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,390
Oh, my gosh.

369
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,789
I guess it's a team.

370
00:19:18,099 --> 00:19:19,200
Who are they?

371
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:20,430
The first one. Goodness.

372
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,769
(KIM JEONGMIN, SONG SEUNGHO, JUNG SEYUN)

373
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,400
You can do it!

374
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,568
- Way to go! - You can do it!

375
00:19:28,569 --> 00:19:29,808
(KIM JEONGMIN, SONG SEUNGHO, JUNG SEYUN)

376
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:30,970
- We'll do our best. - Okay.

377
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:33,909
- You can do it! - Way to go!

378
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,278
(Three trainees step up amid cheers.)

379
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:36,809
Hi.

380
00:19:39,349 --> 00:19:41,789
- Okay, let's do this. - Here we go.

381
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,750
They must be so nervous.

382
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,259
Gosh, I'm nervous.

383
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,960
Which director? Which room?

384
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:53,528
As the three of us worked hard to prepare for this,

385
00:19:53,529 --> 00:19:55,970
I hope we receive a good result.

386
00:19:57,369 --> 00:19:58,969
(Which booth are the three trainees heading to?)

387
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,538
- Hello. - Hello.

388
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:01,608
- Hello. - Hello.

389
00:20:01,609 --> 00:20:02,670
Welcome.

390
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:05,479
Please introduce yourselves.

391
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,239
- Okay. - In 1, 2, 3.

392
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,479
- Hello. - Hello.

393
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,808
- We're JUNG SEYUN, - KIM JEONGMIN,

394
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:11,449
- and SONG SEUNGHO. - In 1, 2, 3.

395
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,750
- Thank you in advance. - Thank you in advance.

396
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,749
(Showing passionate energy from their greeting)

397
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,989
- They're passionate. - Indeed.

398
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,549
Could you show us your performance?

399
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,160
- Let's do this. - Let's do this.

400
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:20,589
- Let's go. - Let's go.

401
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,499
What is it?

402
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,258
(The trainees' performance is broadcast live to others.)

403
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:28,299
We can watch.

404
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:31,369
If they don't do well, it'll be a public humiliation.

405
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:33,999
It makes me nervous.

406
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,109
Tell me about it.

407
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,179
Let's start.

408
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,210
(Will they overcome the pressure of being the first and survive?)

409
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:44,980
("Hmm-cheat" by KIM JEONGMIN, SONG SEUNGHO, JUNG SEYUN)

410
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:46,650
What?

411
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:59,359
Their singing live.

412
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:49,180
How can they sing live while dancing so powerfully?

413
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:00,519
They're so good.

414
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:21,579
They're on another level.

415
00:22:23,349 --> 00:22:24,410
They're awesome.

416
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:27,380
- In 1, 2, 3. Thank you! - Thank you!

417
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:33,059
Is there a reason you chose this song?

418
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:35,929
We chose "Hmm-cheat..."

419
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:39,098
as it's a song with funky and rhythmical vibes.

420
00:22:39,099 --> 00:22:41,229
Three of us are of the same age.

421
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,629
We're fresh and young 17-year-olds.

422
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,598
(They're of the same age, 17 year olds.)

423
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:46,739
- Young and fresh 17 year olds. - We chose this song...

424
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,268
because we thought it could show our young energy.

425
00:22:49,269 --> 00:22:50,539
(They chose this song to show the energy of teens.)

426
00:22:50,609 --> 00:22:51,979
- Shall we discuss? - Yes.

427
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,538
- We need to discuss. - Yes.

428
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:54,808
- Please wait. - Thank you.

429
00:22:54,809 --> 00:22:55,848
- Thank you. - Thank you.

430
00:22:55,849 --> 00:22:56,979
(The result will be announced after the directors' discussion.)

431
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:00,619
- I think he's so good. - Yes.

432
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:02,118
He's good at almost everything.

433
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:05,089
His expressions are good, and he can sing, rap, and dance.

434
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:08,130
This guy is very good-looking.

435
00:23:10,029 --> 00:23:11,999
(Looks are also an important element to be considered.)

436
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,930
- That's also important. - In my opinion,

437
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:17,769
it seems that the three of them make one another shine.

438
00:23:18,369 --> 00:23:20,669
And I wonder what will happen if they're separated.

439
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:23,209
While watching their performance, I thought,

440
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:25,680
"What would happen if they were separated?"

441
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:27,579
We got this.

442
00:23:30,349 --> 00:23:31,579
I was so scared.

443
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,019
I was super nervous.

444
00:23:35,089 --> 00:23:38,219
We'll announce the result.

445
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,289
- Yes. - Yes.

446
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:41,490
Trainee JUNG SEYUN.

447
00:23:43,059 --> 00:23:44,159
You passed.

448
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,230
Thank you!

449
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:49,029
And next,

450
00:23:49,369 --> 00:23:51,400
Trainee KIM JEONGMIN.

451
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:55,869
Trainee KIM JEONGMIN.

452
00:23:57,869 --> 00:23:59,479
- You passed. - Thank you.

453
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,980
(Trainee KIM JEONGMIN passes.)

454
00:24:02,779 --> 00:24:04,710
- And the last one, SEUNGHO. - Yes.

455
00:24:05,619 --> 00:24:07,450
- Two members have passed. - Yes.

456
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:10,119
- If... - Yes.

457
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:13,889
If only one member fails, what will you do?

458
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:15,160
What are you going to do?

459
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:17,058
I'd feel very sad.

460
00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:19,059
We worked very hard together to prepare for this.

461
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,029
Then are you willing to exchange your pass for his fail?

462
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,339
Then are you willing to exchange your pass for his fail?

463
00:24:26,069 --> 00:24:28,338
(He means no.)

464
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:31,009
- What does that mean? - What does that mean?

465
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,539
- He's honest. - He's honest.

466
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,679
I like that.

467
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,150
I'll announce the result.

468
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:38,150
- Trainee SONG SEUNGHO. - Yes.

469
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,920
- You passed. - Thank you!

470
00:24:43,089 --> 00:24:44,250
- You passed. - Thank you!

471
00:24:44,589 --> 00:24:46,419
(All the team members pass.)

472
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,959
- Congratulations. - Good job.

473
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,190
- Thank you! - Thank you!

474
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:53,258
- You auditioned as a team. - Yes.

475
00:24:53,259 --> 00:24:55,369
Do you think it was good or bad?

476
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:57,868
I think it was good.

477
00:24:57,869 --> 00:24:59,768
- I think it was good. - I think so too.

478
00:24:59,769 --> 00:25:01,169
I definitely liked the performance.

479
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:02,910
- Thank you! - Thank you!

480
00:25:03,069 --> 00:25:04,508
- However, - Yes.

481
00:25:04,509 --> 00:25:06,008
you looked like one person.

482
00:25:06,009 --> 00:25:07,680
- Right. - No one stood out.

483
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:11,650
Now that you're here, it's about surviving.

484
00:25:11,849 --> 00:25:13,880
- Now, you might not be a team. - Right.

485
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,989
You need to find what you can do well as an individual.

486
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:20,660
I think this can be a chance for you to grow.

487
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,289
All of you did a great job.

488
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,288
- Thank you. - Thank you!

489
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:26,328
- We really felt your energy. - Yes.

490
00:25:26,329 --> 00:25:28,328
- Thank you! - Congratulations.

491
00:25:28,329 --> 00:25:29,730
- Thank you! - Thank you!

492
00:25:29,869 --> 00:25:32,470
- Bye. - Bye. Thank you.

493
00:25:33,069 --> 00:25:34,240
Bye.

494
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:37,269
They're cute. They have a lot of charms.

495
00:25:37,609 --> 00:25:40,179
- They're almost ready. - Right.

496
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,849
It seems that they've practised a lot for a long time.

497
00:25:43,609 --> 00:25:47,019
(The first performance ended nicely.)

498
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:49,589
It's a good vibe.

499
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,289
- The atmosphere is hot. - They're awesome.

500
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:57,788
Who enters as the first team is really important...

501
00:25:57,789 --> 00:25:59,329
for a show like this.

502
00:25:59,529 --> 00:26:01,829
(Who's the first trainee to enter Ryan Sewon Jhun's booth?)

503
00:26:02,329 --> 00:26:06,839
(YICHEN)

504
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:09,839
What?

505
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,809
- Wait, what? - It's me.

506
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,480
YICHEN! YICHEN! YICHEN!

507
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:18,079
You can do it.

508
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,920
His aura overwhelmed me.

509
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,950
I thought he'd be very good.

510
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:29,759
It's beginning at last. I was happy.

511
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,558
(Entering with confidence)

512
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:35,529
Hello.

513
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:36,970
Hello.

514
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:39,699
(The directors gladly welcome the first trainee.)

515
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,000
- You're good-looking! - Good for you.

516
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,969
You must feel nervous being the first one.

517
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:45,140
Please introduce yourself.

518
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:48,509
Hello, I'm YICHEN from China.

519
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:51,508
I usually act charming and have a nice smile,

520
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:53,549
so ladies at diners often serve me side dishes for free.

521
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,649
And when I go to cafes, many people support me.

522
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:59,088
I'll do my best to become a shining global star.

523
00:26:59,089 --> 00:27:00,220
Thank you.

524
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,758
- You're so good at Korean. - You're so good at Korean.

525
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:04,660
- Thank you. - Why are you so good at Korean?

526
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:07,598
I was a trainee for a long time. For about six years.

527
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:09,028
- Six years. - I see.

528
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:10,969
I see. You were a trainee.

529
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:12,199
(He learned Korean during his long trainee period.)

530
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,038
I see here that you're the descendant

531
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,710
of independence activist Ahn Jung Geun.

532
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:19,979
I see here that you're the descendant

533
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,649
of independence activist Ahn Jung Geun.

534
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,578
- Yes, I am. - How are you related to him?

535
00:27:24,579 --> 00:27:28,420
My great-great-grandfather is Ahn Myung Geun.

536
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:33,058
Ahn Myung Geun is the cousin of Ahn Jung Geun.

537
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:35,829
They fought for independence together.

538
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:37,389
That's amazing.

539
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:39,729
- You must have pride in that. - Yes, pride.

540
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:40,899
Of course, I do.

541
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:44,598
Because I feel a great sense of responsibility.

542
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:47,038
I feel that pressure.

543
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,909
I feel I need to be even more cautious.

544
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:51,470
(He has a sense of responsibility as Ahn Jung Geun's descendant.)

545
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:54,308
Shall we watch your performance first...

546
00:27:54,309 --> 00:27:56,349
- and talk more afterward? - Yes.

547
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:57,509
I'm confident in everything.

548
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:00,779
I believe I'll be able to show them as much as I've practised.

549
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,990
I really practised a lot for this first performance.

550
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:07,358
I've been a trainee for a little over six years.

551
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:08,429
(He ran toward his dream for the past 6 years.)

552
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,259
I don't think I ever took a break.

553
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:12,329
I desperately want this.

554
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,700
I really do.

555
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:18,200
I will achieve my dream.

556
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,200
Please get started.

557
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,839
Oh, I was curious about him.

558
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:29,480
("Beatbox" by YICHEN)

559
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:37,890
He's good.

560
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,849
Look at his groove.

561
00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:18,529
He's no joke.

562
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,670
Good job!

563
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,940
Oh, my.

564
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,549
- Oh, my. - YICHEN.

565
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:37,548
- Oh, my. - You're good.

566
00:29:37,549 --> 00:29:39,650
- You're good. - Thank you.

567
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,380
Well...

568
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:43,919
I almost thought, "Why is he here?"

569
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,920
- Thank you. - That's how I felt.

570
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:49,129
I can see...

571
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:52,529
that YICHEN has a unique charm.

572
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:56,230
- He can be cute but also sexy. - You're right.

573
00:29:56,369 --> 00:29:59,038
I had to write my notes,

574
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,268
but my eyes kept going to you.

575
00:30:00,269 --> 00:30:02,269
I think you have a way of drawing people to you.

576
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:11,179
(His charms made her forget about being a judge.)

577
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,778
He seems like the type that girls really like.

578
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:15,118
I got that feeling too.

579
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:18,119
I think you must have many different charms.

580
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,720
Thank you.

581
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:22,659
The directors evaluated me highly,

582
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:25,160
so I'm really grateful and happy.

583
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:28,670
I'll announce the result now.

584
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,899
Trainee YICHEN.

585
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:36,308
(Trainee YICHEN)

586
00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:38,170
You passed.

587
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:41,410
- You passed. - Thank you.

588
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:43,679
- Thank you, HUI. - Congratulations.

589
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,420
It's such an honour. Thank you.

590
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,380
We'll see you in the next project.

591
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,190
- Good work. - Thank you.

592
00:30:51,089 --> 00:30:52,189
- You can do it. - See you later.

593
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:53,258
- Goodbye. - Bye.

594
00:30:53,259 --> 00:30:54,558
- Goodbye. - Bye.

595
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:55,889
(Trainee YICHEN passed the first round.)

596
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:56,960
He's good.

597
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:58,829
He seems Korean.

598
00:30:59,299 --> 00:31:01,400
- He's really good. - He's good.

599
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,298
Look at everyone.

600
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:06,338
This is the most contestant I've seen on any show.

601
00:31:06,339 --> 00:31:07,470
(Countless trainees wait for their turn.)

602
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:09,970
There are many more contestants compared to other audition shows.

603
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,109
I'm getting so nervous.

604
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:18,049
I didn't imagine that there'd be 200 people here.

605
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,519
I thought, "200 must be..."

606
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:23,990
"the most among all shows."

607
00:31:24,619 --> 00:31:28,730
(Handsome faces)

608
00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:34,200
(Unique styles)

609
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,400
(Various ages)

610
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,929
- Let's go. - Let's go.

611
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:40,970
(Various nationalities)

612
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:45,809
(Various concepts)

613
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:49,179
How did they think to gather 200 people?

614
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,980
I don't know how they did it.

615
00:31:51,349 --> 00:31:52,778
Let's do our best...

616
00:31:52,779 --> 00:31:55,250
to make them comfortable and draw out their charms.

617
00:31:56,019 --> 00:31:57,588
I want to find a gem.

618
00:31:57,589 --> 00:31:59,959
Right. Someone that makes us say, "Oh, this is the one."

619
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:03,089
(Will they be able to find a trainee who's like a gem?)

620
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:05,130
Please introduce yourself.

621
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:08,769
Hello. I'm PARK DOYOON. I'll do my best.

622
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,429
Don't be nervous. Relax.

623
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,440
Okay.

624
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:23,679
To be honest, you can't pass with what you just showed us.

625
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,779
(Eliminated)

626
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:27,779
(Eliminated)

627
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:33,119
(Eliminated)

628
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:37,758
We don't have many who passed.

629
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:39,098
(Finding a gem is proving to be harder than they expected.)

630
00:32:39,099 --> 00:32:41,429
I think it's better not to give passes...

631
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:43,230
if we're not absolutely sure.

632
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,440
(The waiting area is tense from all of the eliminations.)

633
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,640
I heard it was really tough.

634
00:32:49,369 --> 00:32:51,210
At first, it seemed really cute.

635
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,309
Now the logos look so scary.

636
00:32:55,579 --> 00:32:57,109
Isn't it too cruel?

637
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:00,379
You spend all that time practising for this, and...

638
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,720
(And then you get eliminated.)

639
00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:04,019
One chance?

640
00:33:06,289 --> 00:33:07,789
How can we...

641
00:33:07,859 --> 00:33:09,258
How can we leave in one day?

642
00:33:09,259 --> 00:33:10,729
I just got here today.

643
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:12,130
I just got here.

644
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:16,400
I'm so nervous.

(NAM JIWOON)

646
00:33:21,769 --> 00:33:22,910
- It's you. - You got this.

647
00:33:23,539 --> 00:33:24,608
It's finally your turn.

648
00:33:24,609 --> 00:33:26,579
(The timid boy on the verge of tears heads to his audition.)

649
00:33:27,109 --> 00:33:28,710
He's handsome.

650
00:33:29,109 --> 00:33:30,548
- Let's go! - Let's go!

651
00:33:30,549 --> 00:33:32,219
- Let's go! - Let's go!

652
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,880
- Let's go! - Let's go!

653
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:37,220
(I can do it... Cheering)

654
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:40,089
(Entering the booth with a weak cheer)

655
00:33:41,259 --> 00:33:42,529
He's handsome.

656
00:33:43,259 --> 00:33:44,359
Oh, my.

657
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,700
Nice to meet you. Please introduce yourself.

658
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,129
Hello,

I'm NAM JIWOON. I was born on July 7,

660
00:33:51,099 --> 00:33:53,368
and now I'm on Project 7. I have a connection to the number 7.

661
00:33:53,369 --> 00:33:55,809
- I'll do my best. - Yes, nice to meet you.

662
00:33:56,609 --> 00:33:58,808
Do you usually talk like that?

663
00:33:58,809 --> 00:34:01,809
- I'm very nervous right now. - You seem nervous.

664
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:03,910
Don't be nervous. Relax.

665
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:05,519
Yes, I will.

666
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:08,579
- Show us what you've prepared. - Okay.

667
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:13,019
(What performance will he show them?)

00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:20,000
("BOSS" by NAM JIWOON)

669
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,099
The look in his eyes changed.

670
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:45,119
He's good.

671
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:04,710
Very clean.

672
00:35:16,849 --> 00:35:18,348
- Okay. - Thank you.

673
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:19,360
All right.

00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,658
(Trainee NAM JIWOON showed off a different side of himself.)

675
00:35:22,659 --> 00:35:24,889
He's cool.

676
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:27,058
- He's good. - He's so cool.

00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:28,158

00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:29,199
He's pretty good.

679
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:30,969
Good job.

680
00:35:31,269 --> 00:35:32,440
- Thank you. - Yes.

681
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:34,739
- We'll have a quick meeting. - Okay.

682
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,510
I think he's charming.

683
00:35:39,139 --> 00:35:42,809
He's good-looking, and I think he has potential.

684
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:44,849
The potential to improve.

685
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:48,719
I think this show...

686
00:35:49,019 --> 00:35:52,420
will be the best chance for him to improve.

687
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:55,559
- I'll announce the result. - Okay.

- Congratulations. - Thank you.

692
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:05,499
Thank you. I'll do my best.

693
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:09,439
Our show doesn't just look at skill.

694
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,379
We consider the potential to improve to be very important as well.

695
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,138
- Yes. - It's true...

696
00:36:14,139 --> 00:36:16,309
- that you're lacking in many ways. - Yes.

697
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,280
But your body lines aren't bad when you dance.

698
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:21,779
If you put in more effort and challenge yourself,

699
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,989
I think you have the potential to improve a lot.

700
00:36:25,789 --> 00:36:28,690
- Okay. - As for your vocals and rap,

701
00:36:28,889 --> 00:36:32,499
I felt your potential to improve.

702
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,459
I think it'll be good...

703
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,929
- if you improve from now. - Okay.

704
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,139
You're good-looking.

705
00:36:39,469 --> 00:36:41,599

- About two to three weeks. - How much weight did you lose?

I didn't have anywhere to practice,

778
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:23,800
so I practised alone in my room at home.

779

00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:16,078
I think it'll be really cool if you can show us...

892
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:17,948
that you can improve much within a few months.

893
00:46:17,949 --> 00:46:19,618
Okay. I'll show you.

894
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:21,419
I hope you'll become the best singer and rapper too.

895
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:22,578
- All right. - Good luck.

896
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:24,348
- Thank you. Bye. - You must work hard.

897
00:46:24,349 --> 00:46:25,889
- I'll go and check. - Okay.

898
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:28,319
- JINWON is good. - He has a good vibe too.

899
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,388
How come he's an independent trainee?

900
00:46:29,389 --> 00:46:31,158
- Why doesn't he have an agency? - Tell me about it.

901
00:46:31,159 --> 00:46:32,999
I'd have picked him if I had an agency.

902
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,029
These days... I know.

903
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:35,859
If he's this good as an independent trainee,

904
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:37,399
he'll improve a lot with lessons.

905
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,768
He's good.

906
00:46:38,769 --> 00:46:39,900
(They discovered a gem full of potential.)

907
00:46:40,369 --> 00:46:42,268
Trainee SEO KYOUNGBAE.

908
00:46:42,269 --> 00:46:45,440
(What's the fate of Room Best Dancer?)

909
00:46:47,309 --> 00:46:48,409
You passed.

910
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:50,649
(Trainee Seo Kyoung Bae passed.)

911
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:52,610
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

912
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:54,518
I feel like he'll become more solid...

913
00:46:54,519 --> 00:46:57,420
if he learns professionally.

914
00:46:58,090 --> 00:47:00,658
He has the possibility to improve more.

915
00:47:00,659 --> 00:47:03,459
- I feel like he has the power... - Yes.

916
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:05,559
- to catch key points. - Right.

917
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:08,800
Thank you so much.

918
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,828
Let me comment on your dancing.

919
00:47:10,829 --> 00:47:13,768
You have a good sense of rhythm and showmanship.

920
00:47:13,769 --> 00:47:14,868
You can meet the eyes...

921
00:47:14,869 --> 00:47:16,340
- of the audience well. - I know.

922
00:47:17,139 --> 00:47:18,840
(He showed showmanship confidently.)

923
00:47:19,309 --> 00:47:21,380
(He boldly made eye contact.)

924
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:23,050
(She noticed his charming points.)

925
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,379
- Thank you. - Also, it shows...

926
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:26,820
that you learned to dance by yourself.

927
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:28,579
You didn't dance fully.

928
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:29,888
You were like...

929
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:30,889
(It felt like he didn't finish his moves well.)

930
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:31,889
- It felt like this. - I see.

931
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:33,959
You can develop such habits if you learn to dance by yourself.

932
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:37,058
Please pay attention to such details...

933
00:47:37,059 --> 00:47:38,729
and show us an improved version...

934
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:40,799
- All right. - in the next project. Can you?

935
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,129
- Yes. - Great.

936
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:44,169
- Great job. - Great job.

937
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:47,198
- He's good. - Thank you.

938
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:49,039
- Bye. - Bye.

939
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:53,179
- Gosh. - Gosh, he's good.

940
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:56,479
Wasn't it really charming when he danced...

941
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,880
- Wasn't he really charming? - while smiling with his eyes?

942
00:47:59,079 --> 00:48:01,820
(It's too beautiful a smile to just keep it to himself.)

943
00:48:02,849 --> 00:48:04,389
His smile with eyes was... Gosh.

944
00:48:06,019 --> 00:48:09,829
(Many gems are still on standby.)

945
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:12,230
- I know. - There are so many people.

946
00:48:13,059 --> 00:48:15,259
It really is a big project.

947
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:16,598
(As it's a survival show of the biggest scale...)

948
00:48:16,599 --> 00:48:18,599
- Everyone is handsome. - I know.

949
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,138
They're so handsome.

950
00:48:21,139 --> 00:48:22,198
(Filled with handsome trainees everywhere)

951
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:25,269
- Gosh. - That guy is really handsome.

952
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:27,510
Right. I was surprised when I first got here.

953
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:31,409
It feels like they only gathered handsome guys.

954
00:48:33,019 --> 00:48:34,019
That guy...

955
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:35,079
(There was one trainee who drew everyone's attention.)

956
00:48:35,179 --> 00:48:37,119
He looks like a member of TWS.

957
00:48:37,449 --> 00:48:38,888
Gosh, that's crazy.

958
00:48:38,889 --> 00:48:40,760
(A trainee everyone can't take their eyes off of)

959
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:44,388
(When he turns his head...)

960
00:48:44,389 --> 00:48:46,300
Gosh, what's with his looks?

961
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:47,730
- Gosh. - What's with his looks?

962
00:48:48,829 --> 00:48:50,468
He looks like SHINYU.

963
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:51,629
A member of TWS...

964
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:53,469
- SHINYU. - That's right.

965
00:48:53,739 --> 00:48:56,969
There's a trainee named KIM SUNGMIN.

966
00:48:57,639 --> 00:48:58,809
He's really handsome.

967
00:48:59,309 --> 00:49:03,510
Trainee KIM SUNGMIN whom I saw during the preliminary evaluation.

968
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:05,780
He's so handsome...

969
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,848
that I'm still in awe.

970
00:49:07,849 --> 00:49:09,280
He's really handsome.

971
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:12,619
His face was really small and handsome.

972
00:49:12,889 --> 00:49:15,420
Gosh, he's really handsome.

973
00:49:16,659 --> 00:49:17,689
Hi.

974
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:19,488
(He took everyone's attention and dominated the camera.)

975
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:20,800
Let's make a heart.

976
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,000
Hi.

977
00:49:23,269 --> 00:49:24,799
Gosh, that guy...

978
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,768
He's like a model.

979
00:49:26,769 --> 00:49:28,399
(While SUNGMIN was mesmerizing every trainee...)

980
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,599
You're handsome.

981
00:49:31,809 --> 00:49:34,710
Who will it be next?

982
00:49:35,079 --> 00:49:36,949
- Gosh. - SUNGMIN!

983
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:39,649
- Who will it be? - Gosh.

984
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:41,820
- Go ahead. - Gosh.

985
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,118
- Wait. - Wait.

986
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:44,820
- Yes! - Good luck.

987
00:49:45,019 --> 00:49:48,089
(Staring fixedly)

988
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:50,859
Gosh, this guy... He's excellent.

989
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:53,030
- The next trainee? - He's really...

990
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:55,099
He must be popular.

991
00:49:56,969 --> 00:49:58,929
- Welcome. - Hello.

992
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:02,669
- Hello. - Hello.

993
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:03,670
Welcome.

994
00:50:03,909 --> 00:50:05,509
- He's more handsome in person. - You're right.

995
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:06,610
- Hello. - Hello.

996
00:50:07,409 --> 00:50:10,308
Hello, I appeared here like a meerkat.

997
00:50:10,309 --> 00:50:11,579
I'm KIM SUNGMIN.

998
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,050
- You're handsome. - Thank you.

999
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,349
Do people treat you nicely...

1000
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:19,489
when you just throw them a smile?

1001
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:21,719
Well, no. Other than my family...

1002
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:23,159
Not really.

1003
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:24,690
I'm just jealous.

1004
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:26,599
Thank you.

1005
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:29,558
It says here that you have an agency,

1006
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:31,598
but you didn't ask the staff for help...

1007
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:34,399
and submitted the application yourself.

1008
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,039
Is there a reason?

1009
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:39,408
- I'm signed with a model agency. - I see.

1010
00:50:39,409 --> 00:50:41,578
But before joining the agency,

1011
00:50:41,579 --> 00:50:44,279
I had a dream of becoming an idol singer.

1012
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:48,379
And I happened to learn about this show.

1013
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:50,190
That's why I applied for it.

1014
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:52,649
- Let's see it. - All right.

1015
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:55,920
(Trainee KIM SUNGMIN's performance is highly anticipated.)

1016
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:57,460
Here he comes.

1017
00:50:58,289 --> 00:51:00,099
- SUNGMIN is performing. - Here he comes!

1018
00:51:00,929 --> 00:51:02,960
- Gosh, I can't wait to see. - I'm also curious.

1019
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:04,269
He must be really good.

1020
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:07,000
Let's begin if you're ready.

1021
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:18,079
("Hype Boy" by KIM SUNGMIN)

1022
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,360
He's cute.

1023
00:51:52,349 --> 00:51:54,118
- He's handsome. - It's easy on the eyes...

1024
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:55,119
because he's handsome.

1025
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:05,360
He's cute.

1026
00:52:14,639 --> 00:52:16,039
His face is really small.

1027
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:22,078
Goodness. Thank you.

1028
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:23,408
- Gosh. - He's handsome.

1029
00:52:23,409 --> 00:52:24,750
That was great.

1030
00:52:25,579 --> 00:52:27,249
I saw his potential.

1031
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:29,579
I got seduced by a man.

1032
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:33,689
Gosh.

1033
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:37,289
(The air among the directors seems different from the trainees'.)

1034
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:40,959
First of all, let's talk about your dancing.

1035
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,670
Let me put this straight. You shouldn't dance like that.

1036
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:46,198
- Okay. - You see,

1037
00:52:46,199 --> 00:52:47,569
dancing is all connected,

1038
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:50,268
and there's a flow and rhythm to follow.

1039
00:52:50,269 --> 00:52:51,468
But you just went with the rhythm only.

1040
00:52:51,469 --> 00:52:53,408
(She points out that he didn't follow the flow at all.)

1041
00:52:53,409 --> 00:52:54,409
It felt like this.

1042
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:56,009
You dance so easily.

1043
00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:57,448
But it's not an easy choreography.

1044
00:52:57,449 --> 00:52:59,919
It's neither an easy song nor an easy choreography.

1045
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,079
You can't dance like that.

1046
00:53:01,349 --> 00:53:05,089
Have you ever learned to dance?

1047
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:07,619
- From the basics, the basic moves. - Professionally?

1048
00:53:08,289 --> 00:53:09,289
No, right?

1049
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:11,289
Actually, no.

1050
00:53:11,659 --> 00:53:12,760
All right, then.

1051
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:16,459
- I don't know what to do. - This is hard.

1052
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:17,469
- Right. - I know.

1053
00:53:18,269 --> 00:53:20,098
But his looks...

1054
00:53:20,099 --> 00:53:22,638
- Seriously... - Good looks...

1055
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:25,169
play a big role among idols these days.

1056
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:27,109
The performance begins with their looks...

1057
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:28,908
- even before singing. - That's true.

1058
00:53:28,909 --> 00:53:31,408
I feel like he can draw the attention with his looks.

1059
00:53:31,409 --> 00:53:33,319
But honestly...

1060
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,678
You don't agree?

1061
00:53:34,679 --> 00:53:37,319
But I want to see him perform after he gets trained.

1062
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:40,788
He's like a blank paper who hasn't learned anything.

1063
00:53:40,789 --> 00:53:42,189
- The potential to improve. - Right.

1064
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:43,828
Okay. I got it.

1065
00:53:43,829 --> 00:53:44,859
(The directors end their discussion. What's his fate?)

1066
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:46,829
We'll announce the result.

1067
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:49,199
Trainee KIM SUNGMIN.

1068
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:54,940
You passed.

1069
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,038
Thank you.

1070
00:53:56,039 --> 00:53:57,069
You passed.

1071
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:58,439
- Thank you. - All right.

1072
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,609
(Trainee KIM SUNGMIN passed.)

1073
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:01,179
SUNGMIN.

1074
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:04,448
I hope you can feel the pressure of passing.

1075
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:05,510
- Right. - Here's why.

1076
00:54:06,179 --> 00:54:08,218
This means you have to show more from now on.

1077
00:54:08,219 --> 00:54:09,219
Yes.

1078
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:11,288
When I saw you singing and dancing,

1079
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:13,618
- it was a bit lacking. - I see.

1080
00:54:13,619 --> 00:54:16,788
But looks matter when it comes to idols.

1081
00:54:16,789 --> 00:54:18,859
In that sense, I think you have...

1082
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:21,729
the charms to draw people's attention.

1083
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:24,170
But you need singing and dancing skills...

1084
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:28,268
that can back up your good looks.

1085
00:54:28,269 --> 00:54:30,138
I hope you'll develop your skills...

1086
00:54:30,139 --> 00:54:33,480
to become more perfect.

1087
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,050
It broke my heart.

1088
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:41,219
I lacked a lot in terms of skills,

1089
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:44,789
and I'm feeling the pressure in that sense.

1090
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:48,788
I'll prove it myself...

1091
00:54:48,789 --> 00:54:51,328
that the directors made a choice...

1092
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:53,829
that they will not regret.

1093
00:54:55,429 --> 00:54:58,329
Tell the viewers who are watching...

1094
00:54:58,969 --> 00:55:01,800
your promise.

1095
00:55:01,969 --> 00:55:03,869
Show them a cute ending pose.

1096
00:55:04,309 --> 00:55:07,709
I, KIM SUNGMIN, will work on the basics...

1097
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:09,409
and listen to the trainers well...

1098
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:12,249
to improve myself.

1099
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:13,280
Thank you.

1100
00:55:13,719 --> 00:55:15,050
- An ending pose. - An ending pose.

1101
00:55:19,090 --> 00:55:20,690
(Satisfied)

1102
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:22,389
He's cute.

1103
00:55:22,989 --> 00:55:24,489
- He's really cute. - He's so cute.

1104
00:55:27,059 --> 00:55:30,500
Saying I love you

1105
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:32,469
- A heart? - Heart.

1106
00:55:33,469 --> 00:55:34,739
It's up there.

1107
00:55:36,269 --> 00:55:38,210
(The actors are dominating the cameras here.)

1108
00:55:38,869 --> 00:55:40,380
(While we're having endless ending pose fairies here,)

1109
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,038
(the directors are waiting for the next trainee.)

1110
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:44,109
Wait.

1111
00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:45,980
Wait. I recognize him.

1112
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,249
- I saw him a lot on Instagram. - He's really famous.

1113
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:50,788
Didn't pretty much everyone see this?

1114
00:55:50,789 --> 00:55:53,249
- I think most Gen MZ saw this. - Right. I bet it's the most famous.

1115
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:55,218
I know. I saw the image a lot.

1116
00:55:55,219 --> 00:55:56,889
I think it was more popular in Japan.

1117
00:55:58,090 --> 00:55:59,288
Hello.

1118
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:01,158
(Right then, a trainee enters.)

1119
00:56:01,159 --> 00:56:02,828
- Hello. - Hello.

1120
00:56:02,829 --> 00:56:04,029
- Hello. - Oh, my.

1121
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:07,238
Hello, my name is GUTIEREZ TAKERU.

1122
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:09,900
I was on "Produce 101 Japan."

1123
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:11,808
We were both ending pose fairies.

1124
00:56:11,809 --> 00:56:14,780
Gosh, it's funny that he even brought an iPad.

1125
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:16,440
It's this one.

1126
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:19,309
(Revealing the ending pose clip that was the talk of the town)

1127
00:56:20,449 --> 00:56:21,479
(The legendary clip that stirred the ending pose fairy world)

1128
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:24,420
- It drew much attention in Korea. - Right.

1129
00:56:24,719 --> 00:56:26,389
It drew more attention than I thought.

1130
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:28,359
I remember how it was more famous than my ending pose.

1131
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,389
That's right.

1132
00:56:29,789 --> 00:56:31,229
- I think so. - Right.

1133
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:33,499
- Thank you. - It was the best.

1134
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:34,828
- Let's see it. - All right.

1135
00:56:34,829 --> 00:56:36,969
(What performance did the ending fairy TAKERU prepare?)

1136
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:42,440
("Who's Your Mama?" by GUTIEREZ TAKERU)

1137
00:56:43,269 --> 00:56:44,269
(Shouting)

1138
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:45,869
Gosh.

1139
00:56:46,039 --> 00:56:47,809
- Gosh. - Yes!

1140
00:56:50,909 --> 00:56:52,949
(A huge shock)

1141
00:56:53,449 --> 00:56:54,579
Where did he go?

1142
00:56:57,489 --> 00:57:00,489
(Charging forward to the directors without hesitation)

1143
00:57:10,670 --> 00:57:11,730
(Shouting)

1144
00:57:14,070 --> 00:57:15,070
Good girl.

1145
00:57:15,071 --> 00:57:16,198
Goodness.

1146
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:18,069
- Thank you for the performance. - Thank you for the performance.

1147
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:19,139
Thank you.

1148
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:21,880
Well...

1149
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:23,710
Well...

1150
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:27,050
Wait.

1151
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:31,249
- I feel like he's full of talent, - Yes?

1152
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:34,388
but that has to be likeable for the audience.

1153
00:57:34,389 --> 00:57:36,889
If it feels like it's too much, then the audience...

1154
00:57:37,289 --> 00:57:38,459
(They wouldn't watch your performance.)

1155
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:40,130
- wouldn't watch your performance. - Right.

1156
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:42,658
So I think you need to practice...

1157
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:45,169
making your talent likeable.

1158
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:47,800
- That's what I thought. - Okay. Thank you.

1159
00:57:47,969 --> 00:57:51,238
When you became famous for your ending pose,

1160
00:57:51,239 --> 00:57:53,709
I bet you were teased a lot.

1161
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:56,849
I think it's really cool...

1162
00:57:57,250 --> 00:58:01,348
that you returned with improved skills.

1163
00:58:01,349 --> 00:58:03,150
Right. Thank you.

1164
00:58:03,449 --> 00:58:05,448
- Great job. - Thank you.

1165
00:58:05,449 --> 00:58:07,360
- We'll announce the result. - Okay.

1166
00:58:09,389 --> 00:58:11,929
- Trainee GUTIEREZ TAKERU. - Yes?

1167
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:14,229
- The decision is deferred. - Okay.

1168
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:16,329
(Trainee GUTIEREZ TAKERU, deferred)

1169
00:58:16,969 --> 00:58:18,468
- Thank you. - See you again.

1170
00:58:18,469 --> 00:58:20,739
- Okay. See you again. Thank you. - Good luck!

1171
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:23,908
It breaks my heart...

1172
00:58:23,909 --> 00:58:25,538
- whenever I see foreign trainees. - I know.

1173
00:58:25,539 --> 00:58:26,669
- They came all the way here. - In another country...

1174
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:27,709
I know.

1175
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:28,839
If I was told to be a trainee in another country,

1176
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:30,949
- I'd never be able to do it. - I'd never be able to do it.

1177
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:35,880
(A lot of foreign trainees are on standby here.)

1178
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:38,089
There are so many foreigners too.

1179
00:58:38,090 --> 00:58:40,920
- It's so global. - Exactly.

1180
00:58:41,219 --> 00:58:43,019
- There are so many. - There really are.

1181
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:44,888
I'm from Sichuan, China.

1182
00:58:44,889 --> 00:58:46,359
I'm from Taipei.

1183
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:48,729
- I'm from Japan. - I'm from Thailand.

1184
00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:49,928
I'm from Ukraine.

1185
00:58:49,929 --> 00:58:52,400
I'm from LA, and I'm 17-year-old Genius Boy Andy.

1186
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:55,368
(The ways they wait for their turns are all different.)

1187
00:58:55,369 --> 00:58:57,170
- We can do it. - Let's go.

1188
00:58:57,739 --> 00:58:58,809
- That's pretty. - Let's go.

1189
00:58:59,170 --> 00:59:01,110
- Gosh. - It's pretty.

1190
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:05,210
(And trainees who are just bright and innocent)

1191
00:59:08,119 --> 00:59:11,949
Why do you want to become a K-pop idol?

1192
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:17,359
Ever since I was young, my interest in K-pop...

1193
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,388
was bigger than anyone.

1194
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:22,400
I started listening to K-pop and learned the choreographies...

1195
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:25,900
since middle school.

1196
00:59:26,070 --> 00:59:27,138
I love K-pop...

1197
00:59:27,139 --> 00:59:28,698
because of Girls' Generation.

1198
00:59:28,699 --> 00:59:31,968
I came to Korea because I like K-pop.

1199
00:59:31,969 --> 00:59:35,509
Actually, I'm a freshman at Stanford University.

1200
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:37,749
But I wanted to become an idol so much...

1201
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:39,448
that I even took a break.

1202
00:59:39,449 --> 00:59:41,119
I...

1203
00:59:41,679 --> 00:59:43,848
had to give up everything...

1204
00:59:43,849 --> 00:59:46,590
to come here.

1205
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,618
There's no way back.

1206
00:59:48,619 --> 00:59:50,059
I must make it.

1207
00:59:53,530 --> 00:59:56,129
I'm so nervous because it's my first time...

1208
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:59,169
competing against so many people.

1209
00:59:59,170 --> 01:00:01,569
I came to Korea...

1210
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:04,339
to make a debut.

1211
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:06,939
I'm very excited, but a bit nervous...

1212
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:09,339
because it's the first time I've done anything...

1213
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:13,250
this far into K-pop or into achieving my dream.

1214
01:00:13,349 --> 01:00:16,519
These are probably one of the happiest times of my life.

1215
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:19,420
I'll debut, no matter what.

1216
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:20,859
Please look kindly upon me.

1217
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:22,158
(Who are the global trainees that will get one step closer...)

1218
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:23,159
(in achieving their dreams?)

1219
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:26,659
Please remember me.

1220
01:00:27,559 --> 01:00:29,599
Please look kindly upon me. Thank you.

1221
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:32,468
- Oh, my - Oh, my

1222
01:00:32,469 --> 01:00:33,529
Totally.

1223
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:35,968
The foreign trainees must sing Korean songs.

1224
01:00:35,969 --> 01:00:38,570
It must be hard to sing in Korean.

1225
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:43,139
(There's a foreign trainee who seems especially nervous.)

1226
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:45,649
I prepared "CROWN" by TOMORROW X TOGETHER.

1227
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:46,809
Through this performance...

1228
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:51,519
I'll show you my cute and red side.

1229
01:00:51,719 --> 01:00:52,819
Hello.

1230
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:55,788
I'm 16-year-old FONG ATILLA from Australia.

1231
01:00:55,789 --> 01:00:57,229
Please look kindly upon me.

1232
01:00:57,230 --> 01:00:59,759
I've been a fan of K-pop for a long time.

1233
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:03,399
And when it's that close, and when it's specifically like...

1234
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,698
K-pop idols that are in front of me,

1235
01:01:05,699 --> 01:01:08,070
it made me so much more nervous.

1236
01:01:08,539 --> 01:01:10,239
I'm so nervous.

1237
01:01:11,070 --> 01:01:12,669
(When the rule of Zero Setting was being explained)

1238
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:13,738
Today?

1239
01:01:13,739 --> 01:01:17,149
- You can be eliminated today. - After my performance,

1240
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:18,249
I could be eliminated?

1241
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:19,309
(Yes.)

1242
01:01:19,449 --> 01:01:20,518
- Today? - If you get eliminated,

1243
01:01:20,519 --> 01:01:22,319
you have to go home today.

1244
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:24,988
- I have to go home? - Yes, you have to.

1245
01:01:24,989 --> 01:01:28,059
You'll never be able to come back here.

1246
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:29,559
You can't come back.

1247
01:01:30,889 --> 01:01:31,960
Gosh.

1248
01:01:32,530 --> 01:01:34,659
This really is my last chance.

1249
01:01:35,429 --> 01:01:37,570
- I really want to pass. - Me as well.

1250
01:01:38,829 --> 01:01:39,829
You can do it.

1251
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:42,939
Let's go. Confidence.

1252
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:44,369
Right. Confidence.

1253
01:01:45,469 --> 01:01:47,009
(FONG ATILLA)

1254
01:01:47,010 --> 01:01:48,709
Gosh, finally.

1255
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:49,780
(FONG ATILLA)

1256
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:52,280
- Let's go, FONG ATILLA. - Let's go!

1257
01:01:53,079 --> 01:01:54,119
Gosh.

1258
01:01:54,179 --> 01:01:55,718
- Let's go! - Atilla!

1259
01:01:55,719 --> 01:01:57,050
- Nice. - With pride.

1260
01:01:57,349 --> 01:01:59,218
- Let's go! - It's FONG ATILLA.

1261
01:01:59,219 --> 01:02:00,488
(The worrying trainee from Australia, FONG ATILLA)

1262
01:02:00,489 --> 01:02:01,718
(What fate awaits him?)

1263
01:02:01,719 --> 01:02:02,719
Good luck!

1264
01:02:03,719 --> 01:02:05,389
(Staggering)

1265
01:02:05,829 --> 01:02:07,058
FONG ATILLA.

1266
01:02:07,059 --> 01:02:08,130
(Welcome.)

1267
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:12,569
Hello.

1268
01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:14,800
- Nice to meet you. - Hello.

1269
01:02:15,269 --> 01:02:16,339
Hello.

1270
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:19,709
I'm 16-year-old FONG ATILLA from Australia.

1271
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:20,979
FONG ATILLA.

1272
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:24,279
I have the sharp eyes of a fox,

1273
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:26,909
so people say I look cold...

1274
01:02:27,849 --> 01:02:29,379
- I'm sorry. - Not at all.

1275
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:30,888
- I'm sorry. - Not at all.

1276
01:02:30,889 --> 01:02:31,989
That's what they say.

1277
01:02:32,449 --> 01:02:35,459
I prepared "CROWN" by TOMORROW X TOGETHER.

1278
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:38,589
Through this performance,

1279
01:02:38,590 --> 01:02:42,098
I'll show you my cute and bright side.

1280
01:02:42,099 --> 01:02:44,968
- Thank you. - All right. Good luck!

1281
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:46,570
(Good luck!)

1282
01:02:49,170 --> 01:02:51,669
Show us the performance you prepared.

1283
01:02:51,670 --> 01:02:52,710
Okay.

1284
01:02:56,409 --> 01:02:57,610
I was really nervous.

1285
01:02:59,579 --> 01:03:02,049
- Good luck. - MIYEON helped calm me down.

1286
01:03:02,050 --> 01:03:04,118
"Oh, I can do this. I can get through this stage..."

1287
01:03:04,119 --> 01:03:07,219
"with confidence, and I can do my best."

1288
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:14,130
("CROWN" by FONG ATILLA)

1289
01:03:45,789 --> 01:03:46,829
Gosh.

1290
01:03:47,929 --> 01:03:49,229
- Gosh. - Gosh.

1291
01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:50,460
He's good.

1292
01:03:59,610 --> 01:04:00,639
He's cute.

1293
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:09,449
He's a good singer.

1294
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:25,630
Gosh.

1295
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:37,380
Hey.

1296
01:04:47,619 --> 01:04:48,960
Gosh.

1297
01:04:51,559 --> 01:04:52,658
That was bubbly!

1298
01:04:52,659 --> 01:04:53,889
(It was a bubbly performance!)

1299
01:04:54,099 --> 01:04:55,360
Goodness, there are so many strong contenders.

1300
01:04:56,929 --> 01:04:58,070
Thank you.

1301
01:04:59,170 --> 01:05:03,799
He was like a really cute dancing teddy bear.

1302
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,539
Like the heart on his jeans.

1303
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:07,538
Right? That's the key.

1304
01:05:07,539 --> 01:05:08,539
Right.

1305
01:05:09,010 --> 01:05:10,238
(He's cute.)

1306
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:12,848
All right. We'll announce the result.

1307
01:05:12,849 --> 01:05:13,849
Okay.

1308
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:16,519
Trainee FONG ATILLA.

1309
01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:20,619
(What's the fate of Trainee FONG ATILLA who is full of worries?)

1310
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:23,190
You passed.

1311
01:05:23,519 --> 01:05:25,260
Thank you.

1312
01:05:25,389 --> 01:05:26,460
Congratulations.

1313
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:29,429
Thank you, teachers.

1314
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,699
- FONG ATILLA. - Yes.

1315
01:05:32,329 --> 01:05:34,169
Besides your cute appearance,

1316
01:05:34,170 --> 01:05:36,198
you have great expressions when you perform.

1317
01:05:36,199 --> 01:05:39,539
Your moves were big and nice, and your live singing was great.

1318
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:41,039
Thank you.

1319
01:05:41,409 --> 01:05:43,578
You're someone I'm highly looking forward to.

1320
01:05:43,579 --> 01:05:44,808
Thank you.

1321
01:05:44,809 --> 01:05:46,609
I hope you'll show us good performances...

1322
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:48,979
- Thank you. - and make it to the top.

1323
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:50,419
Okay. I'll do my best.

1324
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:53,150
- Good luck. - Thank you.

1325
01:05:53,590 --> 01:05:55,519
Trainees like him have a good character too.

1326
01:05:57,090 --> 01:05:59,190
Those who are good at one thing are good at everything.

1327
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:01,828
Dear World Assemblers.

1328
01:06:01,829 --> 01:06:04,869
I'm going to debut.

1329
01:06:06,670 --> 01:06:08,869
Next trainee, please come in.

1330
01:06:09,570 --> 01:06:11,070
I think he's a foreigner.

1331
01:06:11,369 --> 01:06:12,409
I see.

1332
01:06:13,969 --> 01:06:15,038
Hello.

1333
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:16,539
- Hello. - Hello.

1334
01:06:16,739 --> 01:06:17,779
They have long legs.

1335
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:18,808
(A long-legged duo came into the booth.)

1336
01:06:18,809 --> 01:06:20,110
Please introduce yourselves.

1337
01:06:20,679 --> 01:06:21,849
In 1, 2, 3.

1338
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:24,018
- Hello. - Hello.

1339
01:06:24,019 --> 01:06:25,988
I'm PETCH from Thailand.

1340
01:06:25,989 --> 01:06:28,558
- And I'm SANTA. - Nice to meet you.

1341
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:33,189
My name means "diamond" in Thai.

1342
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:34,558
- Diamond. - Diamond.

1343
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:37,769
- I was born on Christmas, - SANTA.

1344
01:06:37,969 --> 01:06:40,698
so my name means Santa Claus.

1345
01:06:40,699 --> 01:06:42,038
- Your name is so pretty. - Yes.

1346
01:06:42,039 --> 01:06:45,110
We'll shine like diamonds...

1347
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:46,968
And like Santa Claus' gifts,

1348
01:06:46,969 --> 01:06:50,979
we'll show you an exciting performance.

1349
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:53,149
- Please look kindly upon us. - All right.

1350
01:06:53,150 --> 01:06:55,078
- Here we go. - All right.

1351
01:06:55,079 --> 01:06:56,279
Welcome to Korea.

1352
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:59,320
Tell me about it. They came far since they flew in from Thailand.

1353
01:07:00,489 --> 01:07:02,888
(What's the reason they came to Korea all the way from Thailand?)

1354
01:07:02,889 --> 01:07:07,698
I came to Korea to achieve my dream of becoming an idol.

1355
01:07:07,699 --> 01:07:10,558
When I first met SANTA,

1356
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:13,929
I didn't think we'd suit each other this well.

1357
01:07:14,969 --> 01:07:17,869
PETCH always told me what I lacked...

1358
01:07:18,139 --> 01:07:19,869
and fixed them for me,

1359
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:25,550
so I was grateful during practice.

1360
01:07:28,119 --> 01:07:30,480
(What performance will the Thai duo, SANTA and PETCH, show?)

1361
01:07:30,719 --> 01:07:32,420
Let's watch the performance you guys prepared.

1362
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:36,360
- Here. - Okay.

1363
01:07:37,829 --> 01:07:42,130
I was very nervous since it was my first time performing...

1364
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:44,869
- at an audition like this. - Start.

1365
01:07:47,199 --> 01:07:48,939
("Girls Girls Girls" by SANTA and PETCH)

1366
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:49,940
I love this song.

1367
01:07:52,739 --> 01:07:53,739
I love this song.

1368
01:09:06,149 --> 01:09:07,149
Well done.

1369
01:09:08,649 --> 01:09:09,680
They did well.

1370
01:09:10,819 --> 01:09:12,119
Good.

1371
01:09:13,449 --> 01:09:14,560
- Thank you for your hard work. - Okay.

1372
01:09:14,659 --> 01:09:17,460
- What a surprise. - They have nice teamwork.

1373
01:09:18,029 --> 01:09:19,459
There was another reason why I was surprised.

1374
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:21,000
- You guys are Thai. - Yes.

1375
01:09:21,229 --> 01:09:23,999
I was surprised at how great your pronunciation was.

1376
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,069
- Same here. - Yes.

1377
01:09:26,069 --> 01:09:27,398
You must've made a lot of effort.

1378
01:09:27,399 --> 01:09:29,039
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1379
01:09:29,199 --> 01:09:32,669
The vocals at the beginning of the song,

1380
01:09:32,670 --> 01:09:34,479
- sounded so good. - That's right.

1381
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:39,449
(PETCH sang the intro with his solid voice.)

1382
01:09:40,210 --> 01:09:43,250
(SANTA's charming voice followed.)

1383
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:47,318
However, you were a bit shaky when you hit the high notes.

1384
01:09:47,319 --> 01:09:48,560
Working on that...

1385
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:52,229
will make you guys become much better vocalists.

1386
01:09:52,729 --> 01:09:55,229
- Okay. Thank you. - Okay. Thank you.

1387
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:58,129
We'll announce the result.

1388
01:09:58,130 --> 01:09:59,130
(SANTA and PETCH's results will be announced.)

1389
01:09:59,369 --> 01:10:00,599
Trainee SANTA...

1390
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:03,169
(The Thai duo, SANTA and PETCH)

1391
01:10:03,170 --> 01:10:04,809
- Trainee PETCH... - Yes.

1392
01:10:04,810 --> 01:10:07,880
(What will be the fate of the two trainees?)

1393
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:14,680
(SANTA's result)

1394
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:17,380
My result was...

1395
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:18,789
a pass.

1396
01:10:19,449 --> 01:10:23,519
As for PETCH, the decision...

1397
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:26,130
was deferred.

1398
01:10:27,659 --> 01:10:30,829
I have no regrets because I did my best.

1399
01:10:31,569 --> 01:10:34,999
I'm very happy that SANTA passed.

1400
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,569
I hope I'll receive a chance to perform with SANTA again.

1401
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:42,180
I want us to stay together, help each other out,

1402
01:10:42,609 --> 01:10:44,810
and work toward our goal here.

1403
01:10:46,779 --> 01:10:49,479
(Zero Setting continues.)

1404
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:54,658
(The studio gets filled with the melody...)

1405
01:10:54,659 --> 01:10:55,920
(of a song.)

1406
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:58,129
Someone is performing "Energetic."

1407
01:10:58,130 --> 01:10:59,289
(He was the main vocalist of the group.)

1408
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:05,399
(The moment you saw me)

1409
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:08,238
(As if they're in a trance,)

1410
01:11:08,239 --> 01:11:10,039
(they dance automatically as a group.)

1411
01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:13,970
Everyone is dancing.

1412
01:11:14,279 --> 01:11:17,608
I love Ha Sung Woon so much.

1413
01:11:17,609 --> 01:11:21,949
As a vocalist, Ha Sung Woon is an all-rounder.

1414
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:24,890
MIYEON is also someone who's good in every area.

1415
01:11:24,989 --> 01:11:27,318
The two of them are the main vocalists...

1416
01:11:27,319 --> 01:11:29,060
who represent the K-pop scene.

1417
01:11:29,159 --> 01:11:31,189
We need to be good a singing too.

1418
01:11:31,289 --> 01:11:33,159
Did you practice singing a lot?

1419
01:11:34,329 --> 01:11:36,799
Can you sing for me?

1420
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:37,800
Sing?

1421
01:11:38,430 --> 01:11:42,269
(Thus began the first song,)

1422
01:11:42,270 --> 01:11:47,169
(the second song,)

1423
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:51,409
(and the third song.)

1424
01:11:52,409 --> 01:11:53,509
(What?)

1425
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:55,479
- Unfortunately, you're eliminated. - Okay.

1426
01:11:55,579 --> 01:11:57,219
You need to practice singing a lot.

1427
01:11:57,220 --> 01:11:59,219
- Okay. - It's hard to sing live...

1428
01:11:59,220 --> 01:12:00,419
while dancing.

1429
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:01,759
- It's very hard. - It's not easy.

1430
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:03,059
Did you practice singing?

1431
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:04,789
I'd like to hear you sing more. Your vocals.

1432
01:12:04,890 --> 01:12:07,289
I think you need to practice singing more.

1433
01:12:07,529 --> 01:12:10,698
Singing while dancing is incredible.

1434
01:12:10,699 --> 01:12:12,270
Singing while dancing isn't easy.

1435
01:12:12,970 --> 01:12:13,970
My goodness.

1436
01:12:13,971 --> 01:12:15,170
(Trying to find the main vocalist exhausts them.)

1437
01:12:17,369 --> 01:12:19,210
I think he's a vocalist.

1438
01:12:19,539 --> 01:12:21,479
He's the main vocalist for sure.

1439
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:24,239
(Did a talented vocalist finally appear?)

1440
01:12:24,479 --> 01:12:25,810
Did he graduate from Hanlim Arts School?

1441
01:12:25,909 --> 01:12:27,350
He majored in musical theatre at Hanlim Arts School.

1442
01:12:27,609 --> 01:12:28,949
He's totally talented.

1443
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:31,289
I do that.

1444
01:12:33,819 --> 01:12:34,960
How do you breathe then?

1445
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:37,390
It's like breathing through the gills.

1446
01:12:38,029 --> 01:12:39,788
He must be a good singer.

1447
01:12:39,789 --> 01:12:40,789
(Attending Hongik University as a musical theatre major)

1448
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:45,529
Hello.

1449
01:12:45,569 --> 01:12:46,569
- Hello. - Hello.

1450
01:12:46,570 --> 01:12:49,568
I'm KIM DOHU, and I have a soft voice.

1451
01:12:49,569 --> 01:12:50,800
Thank you for having me.

1452
01:12:51,340 --> 01:12:53,139
(Right back at you.)

1453
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:56,439
Please do a good job of showing us the performance you prepared.

1454
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:57,680
Okay.

1455
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:03,250
This song is hard to sing.

1456
01:13:03,251 --> 01:13:04,489
(Can he sing it?)

1457
01:13:06,449 --> 01:13:09,460
(Is Trainee KIM DOHUN a talented singer?)

1458
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:11,429
(Meanwhile, in another booth)

1459
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:13,429
The way he's holding the microphone...

1460
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:15,658
screams, "I can sing well."

1461
01:13:15,659 --> 01:13:17,659
- "I've frequented the karaoke." - That's right.

1462
01:13:19,699 --> 01:13:23,068
Hello, I want to be the youngest one in the JTBC family.

1463
01:13:23,069 --> 01:13:25,239
My name is SHIN JAEWON, and I'm 21 years old.

1464
01:13:25,810 --> 01:13:26,969
- The youngest one. - Good job.

1465
01:13:26,970 --> 01:13:28,279
- That's funny. - Good job.

1466
01:13:28,739 --> 01:13:31,510
All right. Please show us the performance you prepared.

1467
01:13:31,609 --> 01:13:32,609
Okay.

1468
01:13:33,710 --> 01:13:35,979
They need a main vocalist among the seven members,

1469
01:13:36,319 --> 01:13:39,850
so I thought that I'd like to take the spot.

1470
01:13:41,789 --> 01:13:45,390
("90's Love" by SHIN JAEWON)

1471
01:13:46,390 --> 01:13:48,560
He chose "90's Love," so he must be talented.

1472
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:50,800
Can he sing "90's Love" with a handheld microphone?

1473
01:13:51,470 --> 01:13:52,600
How will he sing that song...

1474
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:54,199
with a handheld microphone?

1475
01:14:26,699 --> 01:14:27,699
He's the main vocalist.

1476
01:14:28,399 --> 01:14:29,470
We have the main vocalist.

1477
01:14:57,460 --> 01:14:58,970
- Thank you. - You're like an idol.

1478
01:15:00,770 --> 01:15:02,640
I can't help but clap.

1479
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:04,639
I'm jealous.

1480
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:06,170
He hits the high notes easily.

1481
01:15:07,739 --> 01:15:08,880
He can sing incredibly well.

1482
01:15:10,810 --> 01:15:12,709
- What? - He's singing this song?

1483
01:15:12,710 --> 01:15:14,679
He's singing this live?

1484
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:15,750
Isn't this "MAMA?"

1485
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:21,050
This song is hard to sing.

1486
01:15:21,859 --> 01:15:23,720
He's that musical theatre major.

1487
01:15:32,829 --> 01:15:33,869
He's the main vocalist.

1488
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:44,210
He's really good.

1489
01:15:44,510 --> 01:15:46,009
(The volume of his voice is insane.)

1490
01:15:46,010 --> 01:15:47,380
His vocalization is different.

1491
01:16:17,109 --> 01:16:18,709
It's my first time seeing someone sing "MAMA" live.

1492
01:16:18,710 --> 01:16:19,779
- Seriously. - His vocals...

1493
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:21,979
He's insanely good.

1494
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:32,460
His voice is so solid.

1495
01:16:52,109 --> 01:16:53,149
Thank you.

1496
01:16:53,949 --> 01:16:54,949
It was great.

1497
01:16:56,750 --> 01:16:59,649
- His singing was great. - He did well.

1498
01:16:59,949 --> 01:17:01,289
I'm glad someone freshened up the atmosphere.

1499
01:17:01,859 --> 01:17:03,619
There are a few people who'll pass no matter what.

1500
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:06,358
We'll announce the result.

1501
01:17:06,359 --> 01:17:08,859
We'll announce the result for JAEWON.

1502
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:11,829
(A deep sigh)

1503
01:17:12,329 --> 01:17:14,470
Unfortunately, you've been eliminated.

1504
01:17:16,369 --> 01:17:21,778
Just kidding. You passed. Congratulations.

1505
01:17:21,779 --> 01:17:24,140
Thank you.

1506
01:17:24,579 --> 01:17:27,978
I think he's fully capable...

1507
01:17:27,979 --> 01:17:32,689
of becoming the main vocalist of an idol group.

1508
01:17:32,989 --> 01:17:36,158
The tone of his voice was strong.

1509
01:17:36,159 --> 01:17:39,929
I thought, "Whatever it is, he'll be able to do it."

1510
01:17:39,930 --> 01:17:40,930
Thank you.

1511
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:45,630
Trainee KIM DOHUN, you passed.

1512
01:17:45,899 --> 01:17:47,069
Thank you.

1513
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:50,038
(Trainee KIM DOHUN passed.)

1514
01:17:50,039 --> 01:17:51,469
- Thank you. - DOHUN,

1515
01:17:51,470 --> 01:17:53,309
your vocalization is great.

1516
01:17:53,310 --> 01:17:54,938
I guess it's because you're in musical theatre.

1517
01:17:54,939 --> 01:17:56,938
And your voice is naturally nice.

1518
01:17:56,939 --> 01:17:58,009
- Okay. - Your speaking voice too.

1519
01:17:58,010 --> 01:18:01,479
Among the trainees I've seen, you did the best.

1520
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:02,720
Thank you.

1521
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:05,648
- I hope that you'll debut. - Okay.

1522
01:18:05,649 --> 01:18:07,319
- Okay. I'll work hard. - Okay.

1523
01:18:07,489 --> 01:18:08,719
See you in the next project.

1524
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:10,020
Okay. Thank you.

1525
01:18:12,130 --> 01:18:13,159
Thank you.

1526
01:18:13,729 --> 01:18:17,499
He sings the best.

1527
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:20,198
He sang really well.

1528
01:18:20,199 --> 01:18:22,970
That's right. His vocals were the best we've seen.

1529
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:25,239
There are many people who can sing well.

1530
01:18:26,270 --> 01:18:28,609
I think the team needs a strong main vocalist.

1531
01:18:28,810 --> 01:18:30,880
With my voice,

1532
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:33,409
I want to console someone.

1533
01:18:33,510 --> 01:18:36,849
I want the World Assemblers to see and remember me...

1534
01:18:36,850 --> 01:18:40,350
as someone who is needed for the team.

1535
01:18:41,319 --> 01:18:42,358
We got one!

1536
01:18:42,359 --> 01:18:44,788
(We got the main vocalist!)

1537
01:18:44,789 --> 01:18:45,989
He sang well.

1538
01:18:48,260 --> 01:18:49,859
- There are many rhythmical songs. - Yes.

1539
01:18:50,630 --> 01:18:54,369
One of the contestants is doing the choreography I made.

1540
01:18:55,039 --> 01:18:57,199
- It's quite a risky choice. - Oh, no.

1541
01:18:57,300 --> 01:18:58,510
That's right.

1542
01:18:59,439 --> 01:19:00,769
I know it too well, so it's a risky choice.

1543
01:19:00,770 --> 01:19:02,379
- I know the dance too well. - Down to the smallest details.

1544
01:19:02,380 --> 01:19:03,939
- Yes. - He's in trouble.

1545
01:19:04,079 --> 01:19:06,549
Is there a director you want to be judged by?

1546
01:19:06,550 --> 01:19:09,079
Bada. I'm a big fan.

1547
01:19:09,449 --> 01:19:11,419
Master Bada.

1548
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:12,889
- Bada. - Bada.

1549
01:19:12,890 --> 01:19:14,749
- Bada. - Bada.

1550
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:15,889
Director Bada.

1551
01:19:15,890 --> 01:19:16,959
(Many trainees want to be judged by Director Bada.)

1552
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:19,489
I want to be judged by her.

1553
01:19:20,659 --> 01:19:21,960
- Gosh. - They're going right away.

1554
01:19:22,899 --> 01:19:24,259
- Really? - What?

1555
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:26,170
Let's go.

1556
01:19:26,699 --> 01:19:27,829
It's loud out there.

1557
01:19:28,939 --> 01:19:30,869
I think the ones who debuted are coming.

1558
01:19:31,670 --> 01:19:32,670
I'm nervous.

1559
01:19:33,170 --> 01:19:34,409
- Please. - Come on!

1560
01:19:35,539 --> 01:19:36,738
(My goodness!)

1561
01:19:36,739 --> 01:19:38,350
Hello.

1562
01:19:40,510 --> 01:19:42,448
- Hello. - Hello.

1563
01:19:42,449 --> 01:19:43,449
What?

1564
01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:44,719
(Startled)

1565
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:45,720
Is it strange?

1566
01:19:46,119 --> 01:19:48,020
(How cute)

1567
01:19:50,390 --> 01:19:51,829
Please introduce yourself.

1568
01:19:52,829 --> 01:19:53,889
One, two, three.

1569
01:19:53,890 --> 01:19:56,130
- Hello, we're Two Kids. - Hello, we're Two Kids.

1570
01:19:58,529 --> 01:20:00,229
Let's watch the performance you prepared.

1571
01:20:01,970 --> 01:20:04,340
("Smoke")

1572
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:23,960
(Trainee LEE GEON adds popping moves!)

1573
01:20:26,329 --> 01:20:28,500
What? He does popping.

1574
01:20:35,369 --> 01:20:36,369
I got goosebumps.

1575
01:20:36,370 --> 01:20:38,470
(The young trainees show unexpected dance skills.)

1576
01:20:46,850 --> 01:20:48,149
(Well done.)

1577
01:20:48,449 --> 01:20:49,978
- Come to the center. - I can't believe it.

1578
01:20:49,979 --> 01:20:52,090
- Seriously. - I can't believe it.

1579
01:20:52,789 --> 01:20:54,319
(However)

1580
01:20:57,590 --> 01:20:59,590
You didn't sort out the basics.

1581
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:12,109
It was very disappointing.

1582
01:21:12,810 --> 01:21:15,639
(Director Bada's choreography, "Rover" by KAI)

1583
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:18,579
(Director Bada's choreography, "Reason" by KAI)

1584
01:21:19,710 --> 01:21:22,880
(Many trainees performed the dances Bada choreographed.)

1585
01:21:25,550 --> 01:21:27,920
While I'm judging you as a choreographer,

1586
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:31,519
I would've thought that your performance was lacking...

1587
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:32,858
even if I weren't a choreographer.

1588
01:21:32,859 --> 01:21:35,229
You'll need to practice a lot. Start with the basics.

1589
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:36,859
It was very disappointing.

1590
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:40,028
This trainee's specialty is dance.

1591
01:21:40,029 --> 01:21:41,698
I'm excited.

1592
01:21:41,699 --> 01:21:43,239
He put it under his specialty.

1593
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:46,339
During my time on "Project 7,"

1594
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:49,279
I want to get up once.

1595
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:51,310
I want to get up because I love the performance.

1596
01:21:51,979 --> 01:21:53,648
I'm excited about this one.

1597
01:21:53,649 --> 01:21:54,948
Next trainee, please come on in.

1598
01:21:54,949 --> 01:21:57,750
(Will he be able to satisfy Director Bada?)

1599
01:22:00,090 --> 01:22:01,960
- It's nice to meet you. - Hello.

1600
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:03,920
He's very tall.

1601
01:22:06,390 --> 01:22:07,890
- It's nice to meet you. - Hello.

1602
01:22:10,430 --> 01:22:11,828
- It's nice to meet you. - Hello.

1603
01:22:11,829 --> 01:22:12,868
- Hello. - Hello.

1604
01:22:12,869 --> 01:22:14,170
He's very tall.

1605
01:22:15,199 --> 01:22:18,140
- It's nice to meet you. - It says here that you were...

1606
01:22:18,340 --> 01:22:20,938
on an idol survival show called "BOYS PLANET."

1607
01:22:20,939 --> 01:22:22,679
(He was on a survival show!)

1608
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:25,550
Firstly, MAJINGXIANG...

1609
01:22:25,979 --> 01:22:27,380
MAJINGXIANG.

1610
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:30,220
I saw him for the first time on "BOYS PLANET."

1611
01:22:30,550 --> 01:22:32,489
Wasn't he on "BOYS PLANET?"

1612
01:22:33,619 --> 01:22:35,220
- Really? - I think he was on "BOYS PLANET."

1613
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:40,188
I was like, "I know him."

1614
01:22:40,189 --> 01:22:43,158
He was so handsome in real life.

1615
01:22:43,159 --> 01:22:45,729
(Everyone recognized a former survival show contestant.)

1616
01:22:46,630 --> 01:22:49,198
You were on "BOYS PLANET."

1617
01:22:49,199 --> 01:22:51,939
Among the top four contestants in terms of looks,

1618
01:22:52,439 --> 01:22:54,609
the other three...

1619
01:22:54,869 --> 01:22:58,010
- debuted as ZEROBASEONE. - Yes.

1620
01:22:58,210 --> 01:23:01,979
How did you feel seeing them?

1621
01:23:02,449 --> 01:23:05,189
Since I lacked skills back then,

1622
01:23:05,689 --> 01:23:06,889
I couldn't debut.

1623
01:23:06,890 --> 01:23:09,789
So I practised hard since then.

1624
01:23:10,390 --> 01:23:13,630
I want to hurry up and meet them, so I'm working hard.

1625
01:23:15,460 --> 01:23:17,560
I'm very sad, to be honest.

1626
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:19,600
It's my second try,

1627
01:23:21,069 --> 01:23:23,270
so I know I have to work hard.

1628
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:28,270
With disappointment in my heart, I practised hard in the past year.

1629
01:23:29,479 --> 01:23:30,680
I have confidence now.

1630
01:23:31,210 --> 01:23:35,319
No matter the hardship, I can overcome it.

1631
01:23:38,619 --> 01:23:39,720
Let's go.

1632
01:23:40,489 --> 01:23:43,359
("MAVERICK" by MAJINGXIANG)

1633
01:24:02,039 --> 01:24:04,079
His moves are so clean and clear. His limbs are so long.

1634
01:24:59,029 --> 01:25:00,670
Even the ending was perfect.

1635
01:25:00,829 --> 01:25:01,839
Really?

1636
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:02,840
(Embarrassed)

1637
01:25:02,841 --> 01:25:05,269
It was nice. He definitely gave the vibe...

1638
01:25:05,270 --> 01:25:06,270
- of an experienced contestant. - Yes.

1639
01:25:06,609 --> 01:25:10,879
I participated in the choreography of "MAVERICK" by THE BOYZ.

1640
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:12,109
This part in particular.

1641
01:25:12,609 --> 01:25:13,750
- This one? - Yes.

1642
01:25:14,609 --> 01:25:16,849
- I didn't know. - Really?

1643
01:25:16,850 --> 01:25:19,520
I participated in that part. Anyway,

1644
01:25:19,619 --> 01:25:21,420
- I want to tell you this. - Okay.

1645
01:25:23,859 --> 01:25:26,060
- You did very well. - Thank you.

1646
01:25:26,159 --> 01:25:30,159
I don't think you watched THE BOYZ's practice video...

1647
01:25:30,260 --> 01:25:32,199
and made an effort.

1648
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:33,729
I think you studied it a lot.

1649
01:25:33,829 --> 01:25:36,398
- I see. - With each dance move,

1650
01:25:36,399 --> 01:25:39,109
- you had a specific hand gesture. - Yes.

1651
01:25:41,239 --> 01:25:45,010
(MAJINGXIANG even studied the hand gestures.)

1652
01:25:45,380 --> 01:25:49,318
You even paid attention to the hand gestures.

1653
01:25:49,319 --> 01:25:51,220
I think it's an incredible talent.

1654
01:25:51,319 --> 01:25:52,550
It takes skills.

1655
01:25:52,649 --> 01:25:54,189
- That's right. - You mean this.

1656
01:25:54,489 --> 01:25:56,789
- That's right. You're good. - How cute.

1657
01:25:57,420 --> 01:25:58,729
(He's cute.)

1658
01:25:58,859 --> 01:26:01,028
I loved the balance of the dance.

1659
01:26:01,029 --> 01:26:02,130
Thank you.

1660
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:04,659
- We'll announce the result. - Okay.

1661
01:26:06,069 --> 01:26:07,228
Do you think you'll pass?

1662
01:26:07,229 --> 01:26:08,568
Thank you.

1663
01:26:08,569 --> 01:26:11,368
- No, that wasn't... - Not yet.

1664
01:26:11,369 --> 01:26:13,839
- It was a question. - Do you think you'll pass?

1665
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:14,840
I see.

1666
01:26:15,279 --> 01:26:17,810
- So you think you passed. - I'm nervous.

1667
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:20,250
I have confidence.

1668
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:24,349
We'll announce the result.

1669
01:26:24,350 --> 01:26:26,590
- He's confident. - Trainee MAJINGXIANG.

1670
01:26:28,319 --> 01:26:30,818
- You passed. - Thank you.

1671
01:26:30,819 --> 01:26:32,389
- Thank you. - Congratulations.

1672
01:26:32,390 --> 01:26:33,430
I'll work hard.

1673
01:26:33,829 --> 01:26:35,059
- Thank you. - Thank you for your hard work.

1674
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:36,430
- Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you for your hard work.

1675
01:26:36,859 --> 01:26:39,129
- That's the exit. - Thank you.

1676
01:26:39,130 --> 01:26:40,828
- Thank you for your hard work. - He's so tall.

1677
01:26:40,829 --> 01:26:43,139
- He's so tall. - Slide.

1678
01:26:43,140 --> 01:26:44,170
Guess.

1679
01:26:44,270 --> 01:26:46,738
I don't know English. Do I push the door?

1680
01:26:46,739 --> 01:26:48,979
- Push to the right. - Okay.

1681
01:26:49,079 --> 01:26:51,340
- No. To the right. - The right.

1682
01:26:51,439 --> 01:26:52,849
- The right. - The right. The side.

1683
01:26:52,850 --> 01:26:54,550
- Like this? - The side.

1684
01:26:55,010 --> 01:26:57,179
This is confusing.

1685
01:26:57,180 --> 01:26:59,148
- Just stay here. - Do this.

1686
01:26:59,149 --> 01:27:00,649
- Do this. - This?

1687
01:27:01,090 --> 01:27:02,159
There you go.

1688
01:27:02,590 --> 01:27:03,689
Sorry.

1689
01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:05,389
- He's cute. - "Sorry?"

1690
01:27:05,390 --> 01:27:07,659
"Sorry?" That's too casual.

1691
01:27:08,460 --> 01:27:10,599
- He's cute. He's clumsy. - Yes.

1692
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:13,469
He has the cuteness fans would like.

1693
01:27:13,470 --> 01:27:14,630
- It's a bit... - Does he lack in any way?

1694
01:27:15,270 --> 01:27:16,299
He's like a cute big-sized dog.

1695
01:27:16,300 --> 01:27:17,670
Yes. He's tall.

1696
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:20,809
- He's good-looking. - He's handsome and tall.

1697
01:27:20,810 --> 01:27:22,579
- He's well-proportioned. - He's young.

1698
01:27:23,109 --> 01:27:25,239
- He can dance well. - Seriously.

1699
01:27:28,010 --> 01:27:31,279
(Someone is farting with his mouth.)

1700
01:27:31,550 --> 01:27:32,749
(Warming up his throat)

1701
01:27:32,750 --> 01:27:33,750
Shall we warm up?

1702
01:27:35,390 --> 01:27:37,720
(Let's see how people prepare for their performances.)

1703
01:27:38,659 --> 01:27:41,029
(A good student who takes care of his throat)

1704
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:44,659
(Meow)

1705
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:46,770
- Are you a cat? - I don't know.

1706
01:27:47,399 --> 01:27:50,038
- How old are you? - Me? I'm 23.

1707
01:27:50,039 --> 01:27:51,738
I'm 23. Are you older than me?

1708
01:27:51,739 --> 01:27:53,209
- Yes. How old are you? - Hello.

1709
01:27:53,210 --> 01:27:54,839
- I was born in 2004. - Call me big brother.

1710
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:55,979
He's lying.

1711
01:27:56,079 --> 01:27:57,609
- I was born in 2005. - I see.

1712
01:28:00,079 --> 01:28:01,779
- You can talk casually to me. - Okay.

1713
01:28:02,220 --> 01:28:04,249
- Just like that? - Let's talk casually.

1714
01:28:04,250 --> 01:28:05,920
- All right. - Okay.

1715
01:28:07,289 --> 01:28:10,189
(They pump up their energy before the performance.)

1716
01:28:12,329 --> 01:28:15,430
(This trainee is quite dark.)

1717
01:28:16,699 --> 01:28:19,569
(Not moving an inch)

1718
01:28:21,100 --> 01:28:22,100
(Glancing over)

1719
01:28:22,101 --> 01:28:24,369
He was charismatic.

1720
01:28:24,869 --> 01:28:27,169
He was a bit scary.

1721
01:28:27,170 --> 01:28:28,539
(Loneliness in the crowd)

1722
01:28:30,380 --> 01:28:31,380
Who is it?

1723
01:28:31,381 --> 01:28:34,078
(KIM HYUNJAE)

1724
01:28:34,079 --> 01:28:36,779
- Good luck. - Trainee KIM HYUNJAE.

1725
01:28:37,079 --> 01:28:38,949
- All right. - You got this.

1726
01:28:39,420 --> 01:28:40,420
Good luck.

1727
01:28:41,590 --> 01:28:42,590
HYUNJAE.

1728
01:28:43,119 --> 01:28:44,159
HYUNJAE, good luck.

1729
01:28:45,430 --> 01:28:46,689
HYUNJAE, let's go!

1730
01:28:47,390 --> 01:28:49,799
- Right Now. - Right Now.

1731
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:52,398
- Kim Right Now. - Kim Right Now, let's go.

1732
01:28:52,399 --> 01:28:53,399
Okay.

1733
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:55,970
(The identity of the lonely and popular man)

1734
01:28:56,770 --> 01:28:58,969
- Hello. - Hello.

1735
01:28:58,970 --> 01:28:59,970
Hello.

1736
01:28:59,971 --> 01:29:01,770
- Please introduce yourself. - What are you doing here?

1737
01:29:02,439 --> 01:29:04,078
- Please introduce yourself. - Okay.

1738
01:29:04,079 --> 01:29:05,609
(He seems to know Ryan Sewon Jhun.)

1739
01:29:07,649 --> 01:29:10,979
Hello, my name is KIM HYUNJAE.

1740
01:29:11,750 --> 01:29:12,750
It's nice to meet you.

1741
01:29:12,751 --> 01:29:16,590
Do you want to be a singer that badly?

1742
01:29:17,659 --> 01:29:19,090
- Yes. - Why?

1743
01:29:19,890 --> 01:29:21,430
I love the stage so much.

1744
01:29:23,859 --> 01:29:28,670
You quit another audition show due to a controversy.

1745
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:31,100
What's the current situation?

1746
01:29:32,939 --> 01:29:35,710
On "Peak Time,"

1747
01:29:36,279 --> 01:29:38,949
I was preparing for a performance with Team 24 Hours...

1748
01:29:39,279 --> 01:29:42,220
when someone made a post about my involvement in school violence.

1749
01:29:42,319 --> 01:29:43,619
So I left the show.

1750
01:29:44,380 --> 01:29:47,050
I wanted to prove that it wasn't true,

1751
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:51,289
but people already saw me as a perpetrator.

1752
01:29:52,590 --> 01:29:54,090
After quitting the show,

1753
01:29:56,659 --> 01:29:59,630
I felt lost for a very long time.

1754
01:30:00,699 --> 01:30:02,869
I filed a lawsuit in order to prove my innocence...

1755
01:30:03,970 --> 01:30:09,510
and fought my way for about a year.

1756
01:30:10,479 --> 01:30:13,149
The situation has been completely resolved.

1757
01:30:14,479 --> 01:30:15,648
I won the lawsuit.

1758
01:30:15,649 --> 01:30:16,680
("KIM HYUNJAE Cleared of School Violence Allegations")

1759
01:30:18,050 --> 01:30:19,890
I'm sure it must've been tough for you.

1760
01:30:21,090 --> 01:30:25,020
I personally think you did well on "Peak Time."

1761
01:30:26,289 --> 01:30:29,300
When I left "Peak Time,"

1762
01:30:29,899 --> 01:30:32,529
I was preparing for a performance called "Be Mine."

1763
01:30:32,729 --> 01:30:36,869
I watched the performance hundreds and thousands of times.

1764
01:30:37,369 --> 01:30:39,069
I really wanted to perform.

1765
01:30:39,609 --> 01:30:42,979
So as soon as I heard news about this show,

1766
01:30:43,779 --> 01:30:45,909
I applied.

1767
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:50,148
Hello. My name is KIM HYUNJAE, and I was born in 2000.

1768
01:30:50,149 --> 01:30:51,579
(He mustered up the courage once more.)

1769
01:30:53,390 --> 01:30:55,419
Let's watch the performance first.

1770
01:30:55,420 --> 01:30:56,989
- Okay. - Let's talk afterward.

1771
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:04,398
("WATERFALL" by KIM HYUNJAE)

1772
01:31:04,399 --> 01:31:05,460
It's a difficult song.

1773
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:36,760
Well done.

1774
01:32:38,619 --> 01:32:39,630
Great job.

1775
01:32:40,859 --> 01:32:44,430
To be honest, when I listened to your rap,

1776
01:32:44,699 --> 01:32:47,029
my heart ached a bit.

1777
01:32:47,470 --> 01:32:51,569
I don't know how to describe it, but it was nice.

1778
01:32:51,670 --> 01:32:53,770
Isn't that what an artist does?

1779
01:32:54,810 --> 01:32:56,408
I was moved.

1780
01:32:56,409 --> 01:32:59,448
Seriously, it was the first performance today...

1781
01:32:59,449 --> 01:33:01,279
- I watched with my heart. - Thank you.

1782
01:33:01,380 --> 01:33:02,949
It was very nice.

1783
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:07,049
I could feel that you were immersed...

1784
01:33:07,050 --> 01:33:09,560
- in the lyrics. - Perhaps that was why.

1785
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:12,159
But there was one thing that was a bit disappointing.

1786
01:33:12,890 --> 01:33:17,358
Your facial expressions were a bit dry.

1787
01:33:17,359 --> 01:33:18,398
That's right.

1788
01:33:18,399 --> 01:33:23,199
And there's another thing. You kept looking at the ground.

1789
01:33:29,180 --> 01:33:32,279
(He kept glancing downward.)

1790
01:33:33,479 --> 01:33:36,949
It did make me wonder why you kept looking at the ground.

1791
01:33:39,590 --> 01:33:42,889
After what happened,

1792
01:33:42,890 --> 01:33:46,390
I became scared of looking at people.

1793
01:33:46,859 --> 01:33:48,859
- It's understandable. - It became a habit.

1794
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:51,100
- I'll fix it. - You shouldn't do that.

1795
01:33:51,199 --> 01:33:52,199
Okay.

1796
01:33:52,829 --> 01:33:56,369
Unfortunately, you have to hear the result now.

1797
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:59,310
We'll announce the result.

1798
01:34:02,510 --> 01:34:03,510
Unfortunately,

1799
01:34:05,380 --> 01:34:06,880
Trainee KIM HYUNJAE.

1800
01:34:11,050 --> 01:34:13,288
You passed.

1801
01:34:13,289 --> 01:34:14,289
Thank you.

1802
01:34:14,290 --> 01:34:16,118
(Trainee KIM HYUNJAE passed.)

1803
01:34:16,119 --> 01:34:17,318
- Congratulations. - Thank you for your hard work.

1804
01:34:17,319 --> 01:34:18,959
You did really well.

1805
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:20,658
I'm sorry. Thank you.

1806
01:34:20,659 --> 01:34:21,759
It was a great performance.

1807
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:23,629
Good luck!

1808
01:34:23,630 --> 01:34:24,698
See you next time.

1809
01:34:24,699 --> 01:34:25,770
He's good.

1810
01:34:26,069 --> 01:34:27,170
He did a great job.

1811
01:34:28,770 --> 01:34:31,499
It felt like they acknowledged...

1812
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:35,270
all of my hard efforts to be an artist of my own voice.

1813
01:34:36,079 --> 01:34:38,039
I'm really grateful that...

1814
01:34:38,109 --> 01:34:40,750
I'm sitting right here.

1815
01:34:41,149 --> 01:34:42,310
I'll do my best.

1816
01:34:44,350 --> 01:34:46,249
So many guys are making us cry.

1817
01:34:46,250 --> 01:34:47,749
This show...

1818
01:34:47,750 --> 01:34:49,689
- captures the realities of life. - It does.

1819
01:34:49,789 --> 01:34:52,059
- Right. Keep starring on the show. - My goodness.

1820
01:34:52,060 --> 01:34:53,259
You'll understand why I cry.

1821
01:34:53,260 --> 01:34:55,559
People call me Crying Ryan. You'll end up crying too.

1822
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:57,930
- Right. - You'll be Crying HUI too.

1823
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:01,398
- I'm serious. - Seriously. Goodness.

1824
01:35:01,399 --> 01:35:02,568
(Tearful HUI...)

1825
01:35:02,569 --> 01:35:04,600
(is smiling again thanks to...)

1826
01:35:05,399 --> 01:35:07,840
(these adorable and cheerful trainees.)

1827
01:35:08,039 --> 01:35:09,039
How cute.

1828
01:35:09,779 --> 01:35:12,278
- How old are you? - I'm 16.

1829
01:35:12,279 --> 01:35:13,549
- You're 16? - Yes.

1830
01:35:13,550 --> 01:35:16,180
- You were born in 2008. My gosh. - Yes, he was born in 2008.

1831
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:18,478
- He's a baby. - This one is younger.

1832
01:35:18,479 --> 01:35:20,049
- I know. - He was born in 2009.

1833
01:35:20,050 --> 01:35:21,119
He was born in 2009?

1834
01:35:21,420 --> 01:35:22,960
- Everyone is so young. - Yes, they're so young.

1835
01:35:23,359 --> 01:35:24,960
There are so many young kids here.

1836
01:35:25,590 --> 01:35:28,559
They are so young and fresh. Is that the right word?

1837
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:30,229
These young kids are good.

1838
01:35:30,859 --> 01:35:33,069
He was born in 2010. That's crazy.

1839
01:35:33,470 --> 01:35:35,199
- So cute. - They're so cute.

1840
01:35:35,529 --> 01:35:36,669
They're so young.

1841
01:35:36,670 --> 01:35:37,969
- Hello. - Look at these kids.

1842
01:35:37,970 --> 01:35:38,999
They're so cute.

1843
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:42,069
(A blue-eyed boy attracts attention.)

1844
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:44,639
Where are you from?

1845
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:46,409
- Ukraine. - Ukraine.

1846
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:49,009
He has beautiful eyes.

1847
01:35:49,010 --> 01:35:50,979
(This trainee from Ukraine looks obviously very young.)

1848
01:35:53,050 --> 01:35:54,389
(He's friendly to someone he met today.)

1849
01:35:54,390 --> 01:35:56,090
Hey, I'm not your pillow.

1850
01:35:57,689 --> 01:35:58,760
Did you go?

1851
01:35:59,689 --> 01:36:01,430
You went, right?

1852
01:36:01,829 --> 01:36:03,929
- Try that again. Be polite. - Did you go, sir?

1853
01:36:03,930 --> 01:36:06,469
- "Did you go, sir?" - Did you go, sir?

1854
01:36:06,470 --> 01:36:07,529
Yes, I did.

1855
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:09,868
- Right. - Right.

1856
01:36:09,869 --> 01:36:11,099
Everyone here is older than you.

1857
01:36:11,100 --> 01:36:13,339
- Okay. Yes. - Be polite.

1858
01:36:13,340 --> 01:36:14,969
- Yes. - "Yes, sir."

1859
01:36:14,970 --> 01:36:17,840
- Yes, man. - Yes, man? Okay.

1860
01:36:18,279 --> 01:36:19,609
Not bad. It's so-so.

1861
01:36:21,449 --> 01:36:22,719
- SVIAT. - SVIAT.

1862
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:23,750
SVIAT!

1863
01:36:25,619 --> 01:36:28,289
Hello. I'm SVIAT.

1864
01:36:28,449 --> 01:36:31,289
I'm from Ukraine, and I'm 13 years old.

1865
01:36:33,090 --> 01:36:35,328
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

1866
01:36:35,329 --> 01:36:36,399
Thank you.

1867
01:36:37,460 --> 01:36:39,368
- He's nervous. - Are you nervous?

1868
01:36:39,369 --> 01:36:40,699
- Yes. - I see.

1869
01:36:40,829 --> 01:36:41,829
Relax.

1870
01:36:41,830 --> 01:36:43,438
- SVIAT. - Yes.

1871
01:36:43,439 --> 01:36:45,739
I was told you prepared a self-introduction.

1872
01:36:46,510 --> 01:36:49,979
I'm cute and handsome.

1873
01:36:52,710 --> 01:36:53,710
Could you show us a pose?

1874
01:36:54,779 --> 01:36:56,449
(Posing right away)

1875
01:36:58,119 --> 01:36:59,618
- He's like a model. - He's cute.

1876
01:36:59,619 --> 01:37:01,819
Right. He'll look very handsome when he grows up.

1877
01:37:02,689 --> 01:37:04,618
He's only 14 years old, and he wrote that...

1878
01:37:04,619 --> 01:37:06,630
he wanted to be an idol after watching SHINee.

1879
01:37:06,829 --> 01:37:07,890
- Right. - Yes.

1880
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:11,359
I like SHINee. TAEMIN is my favourite.

1881
01:37:12,199 --> 01:37:17,399
I want to sing and dance on stage just like TAEMIN.

1882
01:37:18,340 --> 01:37:21,368
His face suits the song, "Replay."

1883
01:37:21,369 --> 01:37:22,579
(Song selection: "Replay" by SHINee)

1884
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:25,479
- Okay. Show us what you prepared. - Good luck.

1885
01:37:26,409 --> 01:37:29,149
(He's aiming to become the global younger brother.)

1886
01:37:30,619 --> 01:37:33,819
("Replay" by SVIAT)

1887
01:37:35,590 --> 01:37:36,720
All the big brothers are watching.

1888
01:37:40,229 --> 01:37:42,229
(Impressed by his energy)

1889
01:37:44,659 --> 01:37:45,930
(Winking)

1890
01:37:48,529 --> 01:37:49,539
He's so cute.

1891
01:37:53,010 --> 01:37:54,010
(Messing up)

1892
01:37:54,909 --> 01:37:55,909
He's so cute.

1893
01:37:55,910 --> 01:37:56,979
(Sharp movements)

1894
01:37:58,140 --> 01:37:59,210
(Focused movements)

1895
01:37:59,449 --> 01:38:00,549
He's adorable.

1896
01:38:00,550 --> 01:38:02,819
(His focused, sharp movements are adorable.)

1897
01:38:09,989 --> 01:38:10,989
He's cute.

1898
01:38:14,130 --> 01:38:15,159
Thank you.

1899
01:38:16,260 --> 01:38:18,828
- He's cute. - This song suits him.

1900
01:38:18,829 --> 01:38:20,430
- Right. - He's adorable.

1901
01:38:21,670 --> 01:38:23,669
I was surprised that his pronunciation...

1902
01:38:23,670 --> 01:38:25,000
- was better than I thought. - Right.

1903
01:38:26,470 --> 01:38:28,568
As soon as the song started,

1904
01:38:28,569 --> 01:38:29,809
- he was full of life. - Yes.

1905
01:38:29,810 --> 01:38:33,209
He moved with intentions, and that was great.

1906
01:38:33,210 --> 01:38:35,609
- He was energetic. - I liked his energy.

1907
01:38:35,810 --> 01:38:38,318
All right. We'll announce the result.

1908
01:38:38,319 --> 01:38:39,519
(What's the result?)

1909
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:41,390
SVIAT.

1910
01:38:42,420 --> 01:38:43,590
We'll defer our decision.

1911
01:38:44,319 --> 01:38:46,430
Okay. I see. Thank you.

1912
01:38:46,890 --> 01:38:49,359
By the way, you have a lot of potential.

1913
01:38:50,060 --> 01:38:51,300
You're still young,

1914
01:38:51,560 --> 01:38:53,569
and you just started.

1915
01:38:53,970 --> 01:38:56,140
We want you to practice hard.

1916
01:38:56,369 --> 01:38:59,068
Eliminating you would be too harsh,

1917
01:38:59,069 --> 01:39:00,840
so we're deferring our decision.

1918
01:39:00,869 --> 01:39:02,039
Thank you.

1919
01:39:02,310 --> 01:39:04,409
- Good work. - Okay. Thank you.

1920
01:39:04,710 --> 01:39:05,710
He's cute.

1921
01:39:06,279 --> 01:39:08,149
Thank you, MIYEON.

1922
01:39:09,210 --> 01:39:11,720
As they deferred their decision, I don't know if I'll make it.

1923
01:39:12,449 --> 01:39:14,220
But I really want to pass.

1924
01:39:14,890 --> 01:39:18,089
Wouldn't we know for sure if we see him perform again?

1925
01:39:18,090 --> 01:39:20,890
But given how passionate he is, he'll make something of himself.

1926
01:39:21,359 --> 01:39:22,489
- I agree. - He will.

1927
01:39:22,859 --> 01:39:25,930
(There are 2 more young trainees here.)

1928
01:39:26,130 --> 01:39:28,599
Hello. My name is CHOI JUYOUNG, and I used to be the captain...

1929
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:31,569
of the baseball team at Isu Middle School in Suncheon.

1930
01:39:31,939 --> 01:39:34,038
I quit baseball to pursue my dream of becoming an idol star,

1931
01:39:34,039 --> 01:39:35,810
and that's when I realized...

1932
01:39:36,079 --> 01:39:38,278
"By the time I die, I want to smile."

1933
01:39:38,279 --> 01:39:41,309
"But I'll make the world cry."

1934
01:39:41,310 --> 01:39:42,680
That's my life motto.

1935
01:39:42,819 --> 01:39:45,278
Okay. Let's do this.

1936
01:39:45,279 --> 01:39:46,448
(While this young trainee tries to make the world cry...)

1937
01:39:46,449 --> 01:39:47,590
Let's do this.

1938
01:39:48,020 --> 01:39:50,090
(This young trainee wants to cry.)

1939
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:52,259
- Hello. - Good luck.

1940
01:39:52,260 --> 01:39:53,329
Good luck.

1941
01:39:54,329 --> 01:39:55,528
We won't do it here, right?

1942
01:39:55,529 --> 01:39:57,630
- I think we will. - Gosh, no way.

1943
01:39:57,800 --> 01:40:00,529
- We've done this before. - Right.

1944
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:01,829
We recently got a taste of this.

1945
01:40:02,069 --> 01:40:03,399
You're experienced indeed.

1946
01:40:03,899 --> 01:40:05,169
- That's cool. - Cool.

1947
01:40:05,170 --> 01:40:06,170
(He only listens.)

1948
01:40:06,909 --> 01:40:09,710
(Even when the announcement was made...)

1949
01:40:09,939 --> 01:40:11,009
One hundred.

1950
01:40:11,010 --> 01:40:12,039
This is it.

1951
01:40:13,479 --> 01:40:14,778
I'm getting a rush of dopamine.

1952
01:40:14,779 --> 01:40:17,019
- Right. This is the survival show. - Right.

1953
01:40:17,020 --> 01:40:18,749
(He only felt sick instead of a rush of dopamine.)

1954
01:40:18,750 --> 01:40:21,550
I saw a lot of cool guys.

1955
01:40:22,619 --> 01:40:25,590
When I compared myself to them, I felt small.

1956
01:40:26,890 --> 01:40:28,389
(LEE JUNSEON)

1957
01:40:28,390 --> 01:40:29,399
Who's that?

1958
01:40:31,199 --> 01:40:32,199
(His turn came up when he was feeling small.)

1959
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:33,399
- Good luck. - Let's go.

1960
01:40:34,100 --> 01:40:35,300
Good luck!

1961
01:40:35,930 --> 01:40:37,569
He's super young. He was born in 2009.

1962
01:40:38,939 --> 01:40:41,139
Even if I end up getting eliminated,

1963
01:40:41,140 --> 01:40:43,340
I should give it my all.

1964
01:40:44,680 --> 01:40:45,738
Hello.

1965
01:40:45,739 --> 01:40:47,709
- Hello. - You look good!

1966
01:40:47,710 --> 01:40:48,850
(Welcome!)

1967
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:51,720
Please introduce yourself.

1968
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:54,148
- Please introduce yourself. - Introduce yourself first.

1969
01:40:54,149 --> 01:40:55,149
(Oh, right!)

1970
01:40:55,220 --> 01:40:56,920
- Don't be nervous. - It's okay.

1971
01:40:58,590 --> 01:41:01,289
I'm LEE JUNSEON. Hello.

1972
01:41:02,090 --> 01:41:03,559
(His introduction is all over the place.)

1973
01:41:03,560 --> 01:41:04,658
- You look good! - He's so cute.

1974
01:41:04,659 --> 01:41:05,960
- Let's break the ice. - You look great.

1975
01:41:06,470 --> 01:41:07,470
Great.

1976
01:41:07,670 --> 01:41:09,899
Hello. I'm LEE JUNSEON.

1977
01:41:10,100 --> 01:41:12,809
Compared to the 200 trainees here,

1978
01:41:12,810 --> 01:41:15,369
I'm sort of like...

1979
01:41:16,939 --> 01:41:18,510
a newborn.

1980
01:41:20,050 --> 01:41:21,810
- I may be lacking. - Don't ask him to do extra stuff.

1981
01:41:22,050 --> 01:41:23,079
But...

1982
01:41:23,949 --> 01:41:25,350
I'll do my best.

1983
01:41:26,079 --> 01:41:28,220
I'd like to debut...

1984
01:41:28,789 --> 01:41:30,119
from "Project 7."

1985
01:41:33,029 --> 01:41:34,930
(The baseball boy will also face the judges now.)

1986
01:41:35,430 --> 01:41:37,159
(He enters while holding the bat.)

1987
01:41:37,329 --> 01:41:39,129
(He brought a prop?)

1988
01:41:39,130 --> 01:41:42,769
Hello. I'm 16 years old, and my name is CHOI JUYOUNG.

1989
01:41:42,770 --> 01:41:43,969
I used to be the captain...

1990
01:41:43,970 --> 01:41:45,670
of the baseball team at Isu Middle School in Suncheon.

1991
01:41:46,170 --> 01:41:48,408
What made you want to try out for our show...

1992
01:41:48,409 --> 01:41:50,380
when you were the captain of a baseball team?

1993
01:41:51,310 --> 01:41:53,908
Becoming an idol star...

1994
01:41:53,909 --> 01:41:56,819
is close to the dream I have in mind.

1995
01:41:57,380 --> 01:42:00,250
So I participated because I thought it was a good opportunity.

1996
01:42:01,149 --> 01:42:04,319
Have you taken vocal or dance lessons before?

1997
01:42:04,689 --> 01:42:07,930
I took a three-hour dance lesson.

1998
01:42:08,159 --> 01:42:10,099
I've never taken vocal lessons.

1999
01:42:10,100 --> 01:42:11,329
- Is that so? - Yes.

2000
01:42:11,560 --> 01:42:13,528
- Three hours? - Just three hours.

2001
01:42:13,529 --> 01:42:15,199
- In your entire life? - Yes.

2002
01:42:15,970 --> 01:42:17,839
You haven't been practising for that long...

2003
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:19,438
- to be an idol star. - Right.

2004
01:42:19,439 --> 01:42:23,339
You must have met many older guys who have been training...

2005
01:42:23,340 --> 01:42:26,479
- to become an idol star for years. - Right.

2006
01:42:26,609 --> 01:42:28,510
How will you go against them?

2007
01:42:28,680 --> 01:42:30,379
- You have to compete with them. - It's a competition.

2008
01:42:30,380 --> 01:42:32,179
- That was sharp. - You'll have to compete.

2009
01:42:32,180 --> 01:42:34,089
What kind of charm will you show us?

2010
01:42:34,090 --> 01:42:35,549
- His question is sharp. - Do you have a plan?

2011
01:42:35,550 --> 01:42:37,960
- The older guys... - Yes.

2012
01:42:38,289 --> 01:42:41,188
- are handsome and sexy. - Right.

2013
01:42:41,189 --> 01:42:46,569
But I can be the cute, innocent guy among them.

2014
01:42:47,100 --> 01:42:48,329
So I'll go with that.

2015
01:42:49,229 --> 01:42:50,369
"I'll go with that."

2016
01:42:50,539 --> 01:42:52,469
Brooklyn, let's go!

2017
01:42:52,470 --> 01:42:53,640
He's cute.

2018
01:42:53,869 --> 01:42:54,869
All right.

2019
01:42:55,210 --> 01:42:57,909
Hold on. We have some questions before your performance.

2020
01:42:58,180 --> 01:42:59,979
- Hold on. - You need to relax.

2021
01:43:00,109 --> 01:43:03,179
First of all, you chose...

2022
01:43:03,180 --> 01:43:07,289
- "Eusha! Eusha!" by SHINHWA. - Yes.

2023
01:43:07,420 --> 01:43:10,559
This came out 11 years before you were born.

2024
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:11,589
- Yes. - Right?

2025
01:43:11,590 --> 01:43:13,028
- That's crazy. - Tell us what it was like...

2026
01:43:13,029 --> 01:43:14,760
preparing for this performance.

2027
01:43:14,890 --> 01:43:18,000
As I told you earlier, I'm like a newborn.

2028
01:43:18,260 --> 01:43:21,568
So instead of focusing on my singing or dancing,

2029
01:43:21,569 --> 01:43:24,898
I wanted to pick an original song...

2030
01:43:24,899 --> 01:43:27,270
and take an original path. That was my plan.

2031
01:43:27,409 --> 01:43:29,408
- So you pivoted. - Yes.

2032
01:43:29,409 --> 01:43:30,409
(The newborn had a plan.)

2033
01:43:30,539 --> 01:43:35,109
You prepared to perform RAIN's "Instead of Saying Goodbye."

2034
01:43:35,409 --> 01:43:36,849
Did you know about this song before?

2035
01:43:36,850 --> 01:43:41,090
Yes. I watched SOOBIN's cover video.

2036
01:43:43,420 --> 01:43:44,488
Okay.

2037
01:43:44,489 --> 01:43:46,488
- All right, don't be nervous. - Okay.

2038
01:43:46,489 --> 01:43:48,529
Please show us your performance when you're ready.

2039
01:43:48,630 --> 01:43:49,699
Okay.

2040
01:43:50,859 --> 01:43:54,329
("Instead of Saying Goodbye" by CHOI JUYOUNG)

2041
01:43:58,399 --> 01:44:00,739
(A performance with a baseball bat)

2042
01:44:01,869 --> 01:44:03,710
(That's a great idea.)

2043
01:44:06,380 --> 01:44:07,380
(A home run)

2044
01:44:13,649 --> 01:44:14,689
That's it!

2045
01:44:30,039 --> 01:44:32,600
- He's so adorable. - Gosh, he's so cute.

2046
01:44:50,189 --> 01:44:53,590
(His made-up rap is his last move.)

2047
01:44:58,260 --> 01:44:59,329
Okay.

2048
01:45:00,270 --> 01:45:01,399
Thank you.

2049
01:45:01,869 --> 01:45:05,399
I can tell that you only practised dancing for three hours.

2050
01:45:05,699 --> 01:45:06,710
I see.

2051
01:45:06,909 --> 01:45:10,640
There was a part of his voice that sounded good.

2052
01:45:11,310 --> 01:45:12,738
He tried his best...

2053
01:45:12,739 --> 01:45:14,880
- to be expressive. - Right.

2054
01:45:15,949 --> 01:45:17,578
- All right. Let's see it then. - Okay.

2055
01:45:17,579 --> 01:45:18,979
(It's time for the well-prepared newborn's performance.)

2056
01:45:21,289 --> 01:45:23,560
("Eusha! Eusha!" by LEE JUNSEON)

2057
01:45:34,029 --> 01:45:35,229
He's so cute.

2058
01:45:43,510 --> 01:45:44,939
(Melting)

2059
01:45:45,340 --> 01:45:46,550
Watching him puts me in a good mood.

2060
01:45:53,250 --> 01:45:54,250
He's so cute.

2061
01:45:55,989 --> 01:45:58,090
(Energetic)

2062
01:45:58,789 --> 01:45:59,789
Gosh, he's cute.

2063
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:05,698
(Energetic)

2064
01:46:05,699 --> 01:46:07,800
He's really good. How energetic.

2065
01:46:15,069 --> 01:46:16,069
(Yes!)

2066
01:46:23,880 --> 01:46:24,979
(The microphone escapes.)

2067
01:46:26,689 --> 01:46:27,920
Oh, no. The microphone transmitter fell off.

2068
01:46:28,989 --> 01:46:30,520
(Continuing)

2069
01:46:31,659 --> 01:46:32,720
(Energetic)

2070
01:46:37,529 --> 01:46:38,729
It looks like a tail.

2071
01:46:39,460 --> 01:46:40,600
(Everyone shouts it with him.)

2072
01:46:49,239 --> 01:46:50,640
I knew it. His pink shirt was unusual.

2073
01:46:52,640 --> 01:46:55,279
(They can't stop smiling.)

2074
01:46:57,250 --> 01:46:58,849
(His energy lingers.)

2075
01:46:58,850 --> 01:47:01,520
- He's so cute. - He did the chorus really well.

2076
01:47:02,649 --> 01:47:03,818
- You aced it. - So cute.

2077
01:47:03,819 --> 01:47:04,858
(Feeling proud)

2078
01:47:04,859 --> 01:47:06,960
Here's what I noticed about you, JUNSEON.

2079
01:47:07,829 --> 01:47:09,689
Putting your singing or dancing skills aside,

2080
01:47:09,729 --> 01:47:11,729
you have a unique charm.

2081
01:47:12,500 --> 01:47:13,670
- Thank you. - You're so adorable.

2082
01:47:14,399 --> 01:47:18,139
- You're a likeable person. - Thank you.

2083
01:47:18,140 --> 01:47:19,299
(When things seem to be going well for him,)

2084
01:47:19,300 --> 01:47:21,439
(this man is pondering.)

2085
01:47:21,869 --> 01:47:24,180
- Let us discuss. - Okay.

2086
01:47:25,479 --> 01:47:26,479
What do you think?

2087
01:47:26,579 --> 01:47:28,849
- But his singing... - Right.

2088
01:47:28,850 --> 01:47:30,448
- It wasn't good at all. - Right.

2089
01:47:30,449 --> 01:47:31,750
- But... - Yes.

2090
01:47:32,220 --> 01:47:33,448
- I think charms are... - Right.

2091
01:47:33,449 --> 01:47:35,550
- the most important for idol stars. - That's why.

2092
01:47:36,250 --> 01:47:39,159
- Well, I found him cute. - Yes.

2093
01:47:39,560 --> 01:47:42,890
- He's young. But... - His potential to grow...

2094
01:47:43,060 --> 01:47:45,460
- But this is a bit iffy. - Right.

2095
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:47,799
All right, we'll announce the result.

2096
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:48,800
(What will happen to these two young trainees?)

2097
01:47:49,130 --> 01:47:50,670
Trainee CHOI JUYOUNG.

2098
01:47:51,470 --> 01:47:52,539
We'll defer our decision.

2099
01:47:53,039 --> 01:47:54,039
Thank you.

2100
01:47:54,140 --> 01:47:55,839
JUYOUNG.

2101
01:47:55,840 --> 01:47:57,539
- We see potential in you. - Okay.

2102
01:47:57,680 --> 01:47:59,379
We can't pass you right now.

2103
01:47:59,380 --> 01:48:01,549
But if there's a chance you can perform again,

2104
01:48:01,550 --> 01:48:03,419
I'd advise you to practice a lot.

2105
01:48:03,420 --> 01:48:05,579
Okay. I got it. Thank you.

2106
01:48:05,720 --> 01:48:07,550
(A disappointing result is announced first.)

2107
01:48:07,949 --> 01:48:09,420
LEE JUNSEON.

2108
01:48:10,159 --> 01:48:11,260
I'll announce the result.

2109
01:48:11,689 --> 01:48:12,720
Unfortunately...

2110
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:16,390
you passed!

2111
01:48:17,500 --> 01:48:20,328
(Trainee LEE JUNSEON passed.)

2112
01:48:20,329 --> 01:48:21,430
That was good.

2113
01:48:22,770 --> 01:48:25,499
All right. Now that you're on the show,

2114
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:26,709
this should consume your life.

2115
01:48:26,710 --> 01:48:28,368
- You must be crazy about the show. - Okay.

2116
01:48:28,369 --> 01:48:30,339
You must practice a lot for the next project.

2117
01:48:30,340 --> 01:48:31,608
- Yes, sir. - Okay?

2118
01:48:31,609 --> 01:48:34,278
- See you next time. Good luck. - Good work. Good luck.

2119
01:48:34,279 --> 01:48:35,380
- Bye. - Bye.

2120
01:48:35,779 --> 01:48:37,578
It would be fascinating...

2121
01:48:37,579 --> 01:48:40,749
- if we see a huge improvement. - Right?

2122
01:48:40,750 --> 01:48:42,090
- It would be great. - I think that might be the case.

2123
01:48:42,489 --> 01:48:45,219
And putting everything aside like his talent or whatnot,

2124
01:48:45,220 --> 01:48:47,560
he did a great job at pulling off the chorus.

2125
01:48:48,260 --> 01:48:50,099
- He's got a talent. - He does.

2126
01:48:50,100 --> 01:48:51,100
(He executed the highlight wonderfully.)

2127
01:48:51,101 --> 01:48:54,099
HUI told me that I had a unique charm.

2128
01:48:54,100 --> 01:48:57,340
When I heard that, that boosted my confidence.

2129
01:48:57,670 --> 01:49:02,409
It gave me the confidence to do well in the next performance.

2130
01:49:02,970 --> 01:49:04,479
(I'll give it my all in the next performance too!)

2131
01:49:05,210 --> 01:49:08,180
(Look forward to the rapid growth of the newborn trainee!)

2132
01:49:08,779 --> 01:49:11,420
(The shy young trainees' performances are over.)

2133
01:49:12,350 --> 01:49:15,250
(There's another trainee who seems busy.)

2134
01:49:15,949 --> 01:49:18,289
(He's acting playful without a break...)

2135
01:49:19,319 --> 01:49:20,659
(even in front of trainees whom he never met before.)

2136
01:49:22,060 --> 01:49:24,898
The guy named ANDY. He was wearing a blue jersey.

2137
01:49:24,899 --> 01:49:25,899
ANDY.

2138
01:49:26,399 --> 01:49:27,399
He's so cute.

2139
01:49:28,100 --> 01:49:30,039
(There's no one sitting next to him.)

2140
01:49:31,300 --> 01:49:32,739
Aren't you bored?

2141
01:49:33,569 --> 01:49:34,710
What's this?

2142
01:49:35,010 --> 01:49:38,078
It's from a Korean YouTuber.

2143
01:49:38,079 --> 01:49:39,079
- Chewy. - What's this?

2144
01:49:39,080 --> 01:49:41,180
- Chewy. - Chewy.

2145
01:49:42,949 --> 01:49:45,819
(It's finally ANDY's turn.)

2146
01:49:46,350 --> 01:49:47,849
(He enters Bada's booth.)

2147
01:49:47,850 --> 01:49:49,890
- Hello. - Hello.

2148
01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:54,828
Hello. I'd like to be a global idol star.

2149
01:49:54,829 --> 01:49:56,629
A. I'm from LA, the United States.

2150
01:49:56,630 --> 01:49:58,859
I'm 17 years old, the genius boy. I'm ANDY.

2151
01:49:59,329 --> 01:50:02,469
I can speak English, Japanese, and Korean,

2152
01:50:02,470 --> 01:50:04,568
so I can communicate with a lot of people.

2153
01:50:04,569 --> 01:50:06,640
(He's trilingual?)

2154
01:50:07,170 --> 01:50:08,709
Hello. A.

2155
01:50:08,710 --> 01:50:11,779
(Japanese)

2156
01:50:11,979 --> 01:50:13,709
What's up, guys? A. My name is ANDY.

2157
01:50:13,710 --> 01:50:15,850
I'm from Los Angeles, California, and I'm 17 years old.

2158
01:50:16,250 --> 01:50:18,520
(He can also speak Spanish!)

2159
01:50:18,850 --> 01:50:21,249
All right. Let's see it. Show us what you got.

2160
01:50:21,250 --> 01:50:22,920
(What kind of performance will the multi-talented ANDY show them?)

2161
01:50:23,960 --> 01:50:26,359
It's a chance to show the world who I am.

2162
01:50:26,460 --> 01:50:28,760
So I'll show you everything I've got.

2163
01:50:31,460 --> 01:50:33,729
("TAP" by ANDY)

2164
01:50:49,680 --> 01:50:50,720
He's cute.

2165
01:50:59,289 --> 01:51:00,289
Gosh, he's cute.

2166
01:51:30,760 --> 01:51:32,289
How can he sing live while doing all that?

2167
01:51:40,729 --> 01:51:43,670
(I'll tap on you guys.)

2168
01:51:44,739 --> 01:51:46,238
(He finishes the performance with a prop.)

2169
01:51:46,239 --> 01:51:47,239
Magic.

2170
01:51:48,310 --> 01:51:49,639
(Rushing over)

2171
01:51:49,640 --> 01:51:50,879
Thank you.

2172
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:52,510
- My gosh. - It suits your red jacket.

2173
01:51:53,140 --> 01:51:55,350
- I only brought two. - Give it to her.

2174
01:51:55,550 --> 01:51:58,078
- Thank you. - Gosh, he only had two.

2175
01:51:58,079 --> 01:51:59,379
He even prepared props.

2176
01:51:59,380 --> 01:52:00,590
(ANDY delivers them his heart.)

2177
01:52:02,420 --> 01:52:03,960
Will it violate the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act?

2178
01:52:05,390 --> 01:52:06,959
- It's just a heart. - It's not over 50 dollars.

2179
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:10,430
- Here's one for you too. - Okay. I got it.

2180
01:52:11,359 --> 01:52:14,300
All right. I'll announce the result.

2181
01:52:14,970 --> 01:52:17,038
Trainee ANDY.

2182
01:52:17,039 --> 01:52:18,399
(What's the result for ANDY?)

2183
01:52:19,770 --> 01:52:20,938
You passed.

2184
01:52:20,939 --> 01:52:23,909
(Trainee ANDY passes.)

2185
01:52:25,880 --> 01:52:27,850
- Congratulations. - My gosh.

2186
01:52:28,010 --> 01:52:29,449
Don't cry.

2187
01:52:30,250 --> 01:52:32,079
(Crying)

2188
01:52:34,119 --> 01:52:37,460
I'm a feeling type. My MBTI is ENFP.

2189
01:52:37,890 --> 01:52:42,828
I was afraid that I wouldn't make it and became so anxious.

2190
01:52:42,829 --> 01:52:45,198
But despite the anxiety, I passed.

2191
01:52:45,199 --> 01:52:47,000
I didn't see it coming.

2192
01:52:47,300 --> 01:52:50,339
- Don't cry. - When I was watching him,

2193
01:52:50,340 --> 01:52:52,970
I saw his potential to become an all-rounder.

2194
01:52:53,199 --> 01:52:55,068
Don't cry. Here's the heart.

2195
01:52:55,069 --> 01:52:56,939
- Here's the heart. Don't cry. - Here.

2196
01:52:57,939 --> 01:52:59,238
You did well.

2197
01:52:59,239 --> 01:53:02,078
He's the complete package. I mean, he's got...

2198
01:53:02,079 --> 01:53:04,379
- all the talents an idol needs. - Right.

2199
01:53:04,380 --> 01:53:06,449
It seems like you're a good fit for this path.

2200
01:53:06,750 --> 01:53:10,019
When you were dancing, I could clearly see that...

2201
01:53:10,020 --> 01:53:13,390
you were so talented based on your gestures.

2202
01:53:14,390 --> 01:53:15,390
Well done.

2203
01:53:16,260 --> 01:53:17,328
- You're doing well. - Thank you.

2204
01:53:17,329 --> 01:53:19,698
Just keep going. Well done.

2205
01:53:19,699 --> 01:53:21,469
- Thank you. - Well done.

2206
01:53:21,470 --> 01:53:22,630
- Thank you. - Good job.

2207
01:53:23,430 --> 01:53:24,898
Thank you. Here's my heart.

2208
01:53:24,899 --> 01:53:25,939
(Playful)

2209
01:53:26,270 --> 01:53:29,438
- He has a vitamin-like energy. - Yes.

2210
01:53:29,439 --> 01:53:31,609
- He can draw people in. - Yes.

2211
01:53:32,909 --> 01:53:34,880
He's cute. He's so charming.

2212
01:53:35,149 --> 01:53:36,810
- He has a different kind of charm. - Yes.

2213
01:53:38,220 --> 01:53:39,479
Jellyfish and Mystic?

2214
01:53:40,789 --> 01:53:42,090
He's experienced then.

2215
01:53:42,149 --> 01:53:43,590
This is his third time on a survival show.

2216
01:53:43,960 --> 01:53:45,560
It is, but look at his age.

2217
01:53:45,789 --> 01:53:46,959
- He's young. - He's still young.

2218
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:48,260
Then he can keep trying.

2219
01:53:48,630 --> 01:53:49,929
He must've started out really young.

2220
01:53:49,930 --> 01:53:52,028
(Who is this trainee on his third survival show?)

2221
01:53:52,029 --> 01:53:53,059
Let's go.

2222
01:53:53,060 --> 01:53:55,930
(JANG YEOJUN)

2223
01:53:57,239 --> 01:53:59,139
(Relaxed)

2224
01:53:59,140 --> 01:54:00,769
- It's YEOJUN. - What?

2225
01:54:00,770 --> 01:54:04,779
- Good luck! - Good luck!

2226
01:54:05,140 --> 01:54:06,840
- JANG YEOJUN. - Good luck!

2227
01:54:08,649 --> 01:54:09,779
- Let's go! - YEOJUN?

2228
01:54:09,979 --> 01:54:11,319
Yes, he was on "Boys Planet."

2229
01:54:11,880 --> 01:54:14,850
- YEOJUN! - Let's go!

2230
01:54:17,159 --> 01:54:20,189
Actually, when I saw other contestants' performances,

2231
01:54:20,329 --> 01:54:22,559
there wasn't a single performance...

2232
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:24,729
I thought I couldn't beat so far.

2233
01:54:26,100 --> 01:54:28,898
(He's watching other trainees and enjoying their performances.)

2234
01:54:28,899 --> 01:54:30,738
So I was confident.

2235
01:54:30,739 --> 01:54:32,170
I'll pass no matter what.

2236
01:54:36,310 --> 01:54:37,310
This is his third time.

2237
01:54:39,180 --> 01:54:40,549
- Hello. - Hello.

2238
01:54:40,550 --> 01:54:42,479
- He's got a nice charm. - Hello. I'm JANG YEOJUN.

2239
01:54:42,550 --> 01:54:43,979
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

2240
01:54:45,079 --> 01:54:47,648
You've already been on many shows.

2241
01:54:47,649 --> 01:54:50,759
How old were you when you were on the first one?

2242
01:54:50,760 --> 01:54:53,629
I was about 16 years old.

2243
01:54:53,630 --> 01:54:55,590
- That's when you joined the wild? - Yes.

2244
01:54:55,789 --> 01:54:56,999
You're well-trained by now.

2245
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:58,000
(He became an experienced trainee on survival shows.)

2246
01:54:58,001 --> 01:55:00,059
- You were so close... - Yes.

2247
01:55:00,060 --> 01:55:04,038
to making a debut twice it seems, but you couldn't.

2248
01:55:04,039 --> 01:55:06,100
- That's what it says here. - Right.

2249
01:55:06,270 --> 01:55:09,108
After "Boys Planet" ended,

2250
01:55:09,109 --> 01:55:11,939
a trainee named PARK GUN WOOK who was on the show with me...

2251
01:55:12,409 --> 01:55:14,409
made his debut as a member of ZEROBASEONE.

2252
01:55:14,479 --> 01:55:16,608
So without him,

2253
01:55:16,609 --> 01:55:21,590
I've been practising hard with other trainees at my agency.

2254
01:55:21,819 --> 01:55:24,288
However, due to an internal problem at the agency,

2255
01:55:24,289 --> 01:55:25,420
the plan for our debut fell through.

2256
01:55:26,090 --> 01:55:27,688
Afterward,

2257
01:55:27,689 --> 01:55:31,829
I got lucky and was preparing for my debut at Mystic Story.

2258
01:55:32,159 --> 01:55:36,699
But things didn't work out again, so I had to leave the agency.

2259
01:55:36,899 --> 01:55:39,799
I wasn't able to make my debut,

2260
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:41,470
but I got so close.

2261
01:55:41,569 --> 01:55:45,180
That's why I'm more passionate about making my debut.

2262
01:55:45,380 --> 01:55:49,479
(He couldn't stop training as he was desperate.)

2263
01:55:52,149 --> 01:55:56,250
Perhaps, this show might be my last chance.

2264
01:55:56,390 --> 01:55:58,420
So I'm more desperate.

2265
01:55:58,659 --> 01:56:01,689
I did my best while practising for this performance.

2266
01:56:02,859 --> 01:56:03,859
- Good luck. - Let's begin.

2267
01:56:03,860 --> 01:56:05,260
- You can do this. - I like his vibe.

2268
01:56:08,899 --> 01:56:11,569
("MANIAC" by JANG YEOJUN)

2269
01:56:30,390 --> 01:56:31,390
(Surprised)

2270
01:56:32,720 --> 01:56:34,359
It sounds like the original track.

2271
01:56:34,590 --> 01:56:35,630
Is he singing that live?

2272
01:56:51,439 --> 01:56:52,439
Sexy.

2273
01:57:08,630 --> 01:57:10,229
- Gosh, he's good. - He's good.

2274
01:57:10,329 --> 01:57:11,529
- He's good. - He's great.

2275
01:57:12,229 --> 01:57:13,260
Well done.

2276
01:57:15,329 --> 01:57:16,970
- Well done. - Thank you.

2277
01:57:17,140 --> 01:57:19,399
- That was a nice performance. - Yes.

2278
01:57:20,539 --> 01:57:23,039
What do you think? How would you evaluate your performance?

2279
01:57:24,010 --> 01:57:26,408
My rhythm and beat during the performance...

2280
01:57:26,409 --> 01:57:29,210
- Right? You were too excited. - Yes. I got too excited.

2281
01:57:29,579 --> 01:57:30,949
That's a bit disappointing.

2282
01:57:31,050 --> 01:57:34,288
I think you could've done better if you calmed down a bit.

2283
01:57:34,289 --> 01:57:36,750
- It could've been better. - Right.

2284
01:57:37,520 --> 01:57:39,919
I know that I don't look likeable...

2285
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:42,590
when I get too excited while performing.

2286
01:57:43,090 --> 01:57:46,659
He caught that. His feedback was spot on.

2287
01:57:47,869 --> 01:57:49,170
What kind of position do you want?

2288
01:57:49,300 --> 01:57:51,499
- I would like to be a dancer. - A dancer?

2289
01:57:51,500 --> 01:57:53,769
- Yes. - Then you have to do much better.

2290
01:57:53,770 --> 01:57:56,868
- Way better. - This is just average.

2291
01:57:56,869 --> 01:57:58,209
- You have to do a lot better. - Okay.

2292
01:57:58,210 --> 01:57:59,510
- If you want to be a dancer. - Okay.

2293
01:57:59,710 --> 01:58:01,380
I have one more important piece of advice.

2294
01:58:02,380 --> 01:58:04,749
You look very charming when you're not doing anything.

2295
01:58:04,750 --> 01:58:06,750
But you frown too much while performing.

2296
01:58:12,289 --> 01:58:14,829
- That covers up your handsome face. - Okay.

2297
01:58:15,890 --> 01:58:17,659
Fans love it when idol stars smile softly.

2298
01:58:18,260 --> 01:58:19,300
I'll keep that in mind.

2299
01:58:19,760 --> 01:58:21,369
All right, I'll announce the result.

2300
01:58:21,930 --> 01:58:23,469
Trainee JANG YEOJUN.

2301
01:58:23,470 --> 01:58:25,840
(What's the result for Trainee JANG YEOJUN?)

2302
01:58:26,039 --> 01:58:28,039
- Will you practice smiling softly? - Yes.

2303
01:58:28,109 --> 01:58:30,310
- You passed. You promised. - Thank you.

2304
01:58:30,710 --> 01:58:32,908
- I'll do better next time. - Okay.

2305
01:58:32,909 --> 01:58:33,909
That's the smile I'm talking about.

2306
01:58:33,910 --> 01:58:35,349
- That's it! - You look great now!

2307
01:58:35,350 --> 01:58:37,108
- Smile like that while performing. - Yes.

2308
01:58:37,109 --> 01:58:38,449
That's the maniac smile.

2309
01:58:38,880 --> 01:58:40,489
- He's got a charming face. - Right.

2310
01:58:40,720 --> 01:58:42,288
- He has a great voice too. - Yes.

2311
01:58:42,289 --> 01:58:43,988
I love his voice when he raps.

2312
01:58:43,989 --> 01:58:45,159
He's my favourite.

2313
01:58:45,220 --> 01:58:46,719
- He's mine too so far. - Right.

2314
01:58:46,720 --> 01:58:49,390
He can carry on a conversation too. I like him. He's got charms.

2315
01:58:49,930 --> 01:58:53,630
(Humming)

2316
01:58:53,869 --> 01:58:56,630
(A trainee is enjoying the vibe.)

2317
01:58:56,869 --> 01:58:59,000
(Looking relaxed)

2318
01:59:00,239 --> 01:59:03,880
MINKYU, why don't you drink water before you start?

2319
01:59:04,609 --> 01:59:06,339
Drink water. That might help.

2320
01:59:06,340 --> 01:59:07,350
(He gives loving advice too.)

2321
01:59:08,350 --> 01:59:09,750
Wasn't he on that show?

2322
01:59:10,109 --> 01:59:13,079
- "Fantasy Boys." - "LOUD" too.

2323
01:59:13,279 --> 01:59:14,349
Good luck!

2324
01:59:14,350 --> 01:59:17,220
(The experienced trainee, KANG HYUNWOO, seems relaxed.)

2325
01:59:17,960 --> 01:59:19,858
(And there's a deep sigh.)

2326
01:59:19,859 --> 01:59:20,929
(Sighing)

2327
01:59:20,930 --> 01:59:23,560
It's about time that my name shows up on the screen.

2328
01:59:24,529 --> 01:59:25,559
It's about time.

2329
01:59:25,560 --> 01:59:27,229
(There's another trainee who seems to be at ease.)

2330
01:59:29,170 --> 01:59:31,670
(KIM SIHUN)

2331
01:59:32,170 --> 01:59:34,139
- No way. - He's very good.

2332
01:59:34,140 --> 01:59:37,239
- Yes. - Good luck.

2333
01:59:38,680 --> 01:59:39,939
There he is.

2334
01:59:40,210 --> 01:59:41,310
Good luck.

2335
01:59:41,680 --> 01:59:43,609
Did he make a debut?

2336
01:59:44,180 --> 01:59:46,720
- "Produce X 101?" - He was on "Peak Time" too.

2337
01:59:46,920 --> 01:59:49,319
He's in BDC. He made his debut with Brand New Music.

2338
01:59:50,050 --> 01:59:52,459
This is my third survival show.

2339
01:59:52,460 --> 01:59:55,629
Considering the reality I'm in,

2340
01:59:55,630 --> 01:59:58,029
I'm getting older as time goes by.

2341
01:59:59,500 --> 02:00:03,069
Honestly, this is probably my last opportunity.

2342
02:00:03,270 --> 02:00:05,100
So I'm really desperate.

2343
02:00:05,569 --> 02:00:06,770
I really want this.

2344
02:00:11,880 --> 02:00:13,579
Hello. I'm KIM SIHUN.

2345
02:00:14,880 --> 02:00:15,880
Nice to meet you.

2346
02:00:16,880 --> 02:00:20,118
Hello. This is my third time on a competition show.

2347
02:00:20,119 --> 02:00:23,960
I'm the competition-show-chaser, KANG HYUNWOO.

2348
02:00:25,390 --> 02:00:27,329
- The competition-show-chaser. - The competition-show-chaser.

2349
02:00:27,829 --> 02:00:29,528
Who gave you that nickname?

2350
02:00:29,529 --> 02:00:31,060
I did.

2351
02:00:31,430 --> 02:00:33,658
- You're so witty. - That's a good nickname.

2352
02:00:33,659 --> 02:00:36,068
- So this is your third time. - Yes, it is.

2353
02:00:36,069 --> 02:00:37,470
You must be a pro by now.

2354
02:00:38,399 --> 02:00:39,840
That's amazing. It's your third try.

2355
02:00:40,069 --> 02:00:42,439
Whenever I heard that there was an audition,

2356
02:00:42,640 --> 02:00:45,180
I just went for it. I always did.

2357
02:00:45,739 --> 02:00:48,608
Actually, repeatedly challenging yourself to something...

2358
02:00:48,609 --> 02:00:51,118
despite realizing that it won't happen for you...

2359
02:00:51,119 --> 02:00:53,380
is the hardest thing in life.

2360
02:00:53,720 --> 02:00:55,420
If I give up now,

2361
02:00:55,890 --> 02:00:59,759
it feels like I won't be able to accomplish anything in life.

2362
02:00:59,760 --> 02:01:00,760
So...

2363
02:01:01,289 --> 02:01:04,500
I think it's only right that I give it my all.

2364
02:01:06,800 --> 02:01:08,930
Show us everything you've got.

2365
02:01:08,970 --> 02:01:10,469
- Okay. - Good luck.

2366
02:01:10,470 --> 02:01:13,069
(These two trainees won't give up.)

2367
02:01:15,069 --> 02:01:16,710
("WONDERLAND" by KANG HYUNWOO)

2368
02:01:42,899 --> 02:01:44,600
- Gosh. - Wow, he's really going for it.

2369
02:01:59,279 --> 02:02:00,380
Goodness.

2370
02:02:14,930 --> 02:02:16,670
Gosh, he's crazy.

2371
02:02:17,800 --> 02:02:19,000
He's really good.

2372
02:02:19,069 --> 02:02:20,600
He's the best of all the ones we've watched so far.

2373
02:02:24,479 --> 02:02:26,680
- I like his energy. - Do or die.

2374
02:02:27,109 --> 02:02:30,010
- Do or die. - I'd like to give him some water.

2375
02:02:30,079 --> 02:02:33,020
- His energy was something else. - I agree.

2376
02:02:33,979 --> 02:02:37,959
It would've been a shame if he only had the energy.

2377
02:02:37,960 --> 02:02:40,728
- But his vocals were very stable. - It was very stable.

2378
02:02:40,729 --> 02:02:41,929
- That's right. - Right.

2379
02:02:41,930 --> 02:02:44,398
And he could sing really high.

2380
02:02:44,399 --> 02:02:45,459
Thank you.

2381
02:02:45,460 --> 02:02:47,698
It's incredible to perform with this level of energy...

2382
02:02:47,699 --> 02:02:50,568
with such a stable voice.

2383
02:02:50,569 --> 02:02:51,698
It's impressive.

2384
02:02:51,699 --> 02:02:53,939
He sure is the chaser in the audition field.

2385
02:02:54,039 --> 02:02:55,769
He's called the chaser for a reason.

2386
02:02:55,770 --> 02:02:56,969
He's the chaser.

2387
02:02:56,970 --> 02:02:59,238
Well, a chaser has to chase.

2388
02:02:59,239 --> 02:03:01,349
(Satisfied)

2389
02:03:01,350 --> 02:03:02,908
He's so cool.

2390
02:03:02,909 --> 02:03:04,419
Our tiger moth.

2391
02:03:04,420 --> 02:03:06,079
You should change your name to KANG CHASER.

2392
02:03:06,119 --> 02:03:07,689
(Trainee KIM SIHUN gets ready to perform as well.)

2393
02:03:08,119 --> 02:03:09,420
I hope he does well.

2394
02:03:13,119 --> 02:03:15,130
("Supernatural" by KIM SIHUN)

2395
02:03:29,640 --> 02:03:31,479
He's so good at dancing.

2396
02:03:55,500 --> 02:03:56,699
How stable.

2397
02:03:56,770 --> 02:03:58,699
He's got the firm basics.

2398
02:04:20,060 --> 02:04:21,260
How refreshing.

2399
02:04:23,329 --> 02:04:25,029
Isn't he like a foreign artist?

2400
02:04:37,340 --> 02:04:38,579
Thanks for the performance.

2401
02:04:40,010 --> 02:04:41,078
Thank you.

2402
02:04:41,079 --> 02:04:43,680
(Unlike the trainees, the directors seem serious.)

2403
02:04:43,850 --> 02:04:44,979
How was it?

2404
02:04:46,149 --> 02:04:48,849
I think you have to enjoy performing first.

2405
02:04:48,850 --> 02:04:52,059
I mean, you clearly have a purpose...

2406
02:04:52,060 --> 02:04:53,618
which makes you too stiff.

2407
02:04:53,619 --> 02:04:56,729
I can easily tell that you're desperate.

2408
02:04:57,029 --> 02:04:58,859
You try so hard to do well.

2409
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:02,300
It shows and makes the audience feel uncomfortable to watch.

2410
02:05:02,369 --> 02:05:05,199
My concept of this performance was relaxation.

2411
02:05:05,399 --> 02:05:07,770
- Then, you've failed. - I guess it's a complete failure.

2412
02:05:08,670 --> 02:05:10,409
- Let us discuss first. - Sure.

2413
02:05:12,279 --> 02:05:15,409
I did the best I could as it was my last shot.

2414
02:05:15,680 --> 02:05:19,520

(What are the results of these two experienced trainees?)

2418
02:05:35,500 --> 02:05:36,930
a pass.

- Congratulations. - Thank you.

2427
02:05:53,020 --> 02:05:56,148
None of us gave you a pass for the performance just now.

2428
02:05:56,149 --> 02:05:57,219
Right.

2429
02:05:57,220 --> 02:06:00,719
We gave you a pass because we knew you had much more to show.

2430
02:06:00,720 --> 02:06:03,930
- Prove that we were right. - Got it.

He was trying to do well.

2435
02:06:13,569 --> 02:06:15,840
He was too stiff.

(The trainees' performances continued without a break.)

2437
02:06:29,449 --> 02:06:33,220
(The trainees get more and more tired.)

I can fight off the sleep.

02:06:36,430 --> 02:06:38,158
Of course. He can be forgiven...

2440
02:06:38,159 --> 02:06:40,229
- because he's a baby. - Right.

2441
02:06:41,569 --> 02:06:45,669
(The directors are just as tired.)

2442
02:06:45,670 --> 02:06:47,869
- You must be tired. - Yes, I'm exhausted.

Good luck.

- Gosh, the little boys. - The boys.

02:07:42,659 --> 02:07:43,688
They're cute.

2466
02:07:43,689 --> 02:07:45,658
(They bring good energy just by standing still.)

2467
02:07:45,659 --> 02:07:46,800
All right, then.

2468
02:07:47,100 --> 02:07:49,569
Please show us what you prepared.

2469
02:07:49,670 --> 02:07:51,100
- Please start. - Okay.

2470
02:07:55,840 --> 02:07:57,710
Look at him. He never stops smiling.

2471
02:07:58,380 --> 02:07:59,609
He's really cute.

2472
02:08:01,409 --> 02:08:04,979
("Candy" by SAKURADA KENSHIN and FUKUYAMA SOTA)

2473
02:08:08,250 --> 02:08:09,420
How cute.

2474
02:08:23,569 --> 02:08:24,670
How cute.

2475
02:08:38,819 --> 02:08:41,090
- How cute. - He's so cute!

2476
02:08:41,619 --> 02:08:42,720
Oh, my.

2477
02:08:55,930 --> 02:08:57,469
Everyone must be watching with a smile on their faces.

2478
02:08:57,470 --> 02:08:58,970
(Smiling like an older brother)

2479
02:09:15,149 --> 02:09:16,390
Goodness.

2480
02:09:37,010 --> 02:09:38,140
- Candy! - Candy!

2481
02:09:40,409 --> 02:09:41,609
They're cute.

2482
02:09:42,510 --> 02:09:44,249
- How cute. - So cute.

2483
02:09:44,250 --> 02:09:45,649
(Their performance blew off everyone's exhaustion.)

2484
02:09:46,550 --> 02:09:47,648
(The happiness spread everywhere in the booth too.)

2485
02:09:47,649 --> 02:09:48,920
They're so cute.

2486
02:09:49,350 --> 02:09:52,060
They're so pleasant.

2487
02:09:52,319 --> 02:09:54,460
- How cute. - Goodness.

2488
02:09:54,760 --> 02:09:55,859
Gosh.

2489
02:09:56,789 --> 02:09:58,359
- KENSHIN. - Yes?

2490
02:09:59,100 --> 02:10:02,699
Can you show us a K-pop dance performance?

2491
02:10:02,970 --> 02:10:04,569
- Something else. - Yes.

2492
02:10:05,300 --> 02:10:06,339
Dance.

2493
02:10:06,340 --> 02:10:07,739
- Okay. - Yes.

2494
02:10:08,310 --> 02:10:10,869
(Why is KENSHIN so confident about dancing?)

2495
02:10:11,310 --> 02:10:13,510
His expertise is K-pop dance.

2496
02:10:16,409 --> 02:10:20,949
(KENSHIN is a skilled dancer who's true to K-pop.)

2497
02:10:21,989 --> 02:10:26,060
(His unexpected charm is hidden behind his cuteness.)

2498
02:10:28,289 --> 02:10:30,659
- "MANIAC" by Stray Kids. - Okay.

2499
02:10:30,789 --> 02:10:31,929
- Okay. - Yes.

2500
02:10:31,930 --> 02:10:32,959
Let's go.

2501
02:10:32,960 --> 02:10:35,170
"MANIAC" has a totally different vibe.

2502
02:10:35,529 --> 02:10:37,939
- It's different. - I'm curious.

2503
02:10:37,970 --> 02:10:39,340
- It's strong. - Right.

2504
02:10:39,640 --> 02:10:40,770
I can't wait.

2505
02:10:46,680 --> 02:10:47,979
(Surprised)

2506
02:10:48,409 --> 02:10:49,479
What's with him?

2507
02:10:53,220 --> 02:10:54,720
(The look in his eyes suddenly changes.)

2508
02:10:59,460 --> 02:11:00,890
Goodness.

2509
02:11:12,239 --> 02:11:14,100
(Surprised)

2510
02:11:29,119 --> 02:11:30,390
Thank you.

2511
02:11:31,489 --> 02:11:33,188
- The look in his eyes just changed. - I love it.

2512
02:11:33,189 --> 02:11:34,288
He's charming.

2513
02:11:34,289 --> 02:11:36,389
- He uses his face as he dances. - It's so nice.

2514
02:11:36,390 --> 02:11:37,658
I like how he uses his facial expressions.

2515
02:11:37,659 --> 02:11:38,929
His performance just now...

2516
02:11:38,930 --> 02:11:40,130
- made me so happy. - I know.

2517
02:11:40,859 --> 02:11:43,130
We'll announce the results.

2518
02:11:43,369 --> 02:11:46,000
Trainee SAKURADA KENSHIN.

2519
02:11:46,699 --> 02:11:47,898
You passed.

2520
02:11:47,899 --> 02:11:48,939
Thank you.

2521
02:11:50,569 --> 02:11:53,079
Trainee FUKUYAMA SOTA.

2522
02:11:53,710 --> 02:11:55,349
- We'll defer our decision. - I see.

2523
02:11:55,350 --> 02:11:56,608
(Trainee FUKUYAMA SOTA is deferred.)

2524
02:11:56,609 --> 02:11:58,319
I see. Thank you.

2525
02:11:59,579 --> 02:12:04,119
SOTA, you feel a little timid.

2526
02:12:04,890 --> 02:12:08,829
- I see. - However, you have a lot of charm.

2527
02:12:09,060 --> 02:12:12,659
That's why we deferred you, hoping to see a different side.

2528
02:12:13,800 --> 02:12:15,399
Okay. Thank you.

2529
02:12:15,899 --> 02:12:16,969
Good work.

2530
02:12:16,970 --> 02:12:19,170
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2531
02:12:20,170 --> 02:12:22,069
See you in the next project.

2532
02:12:22,210 --> 02:12:24,409
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2533
02:12:27,609 --> 02:12:29,710
This guy is a gem.

2534
02:12:30,710 --> 02:12:32,850
- KENSHIN. - He's charming.

2535
02:12:33,350 --> 02:12:35,550
- Right? He's quite good. - Yes.

2536
02:12:36,489 --> 02:12:39,319
Good work.

2537
02:12:40,260 --> 02:12:41,560
You did so well.

2538
02:12:43,329 --> 02:12:46,430
I'm quite disappointed.

2539
02:12:46,560 --> 02:12:51,539
I'm so sad that I couldn't pass together with KENSHIN.

2540
02:12:52,140 --> 02:12:58,609
I don't want to go back to Japan as a failure.

2541
02:13:00,710 --> 02:13:02,509
I can't stop smiling.

2542
02:13:02,510 --> 02:13:03,510
(The performance full of endorphins is over.)

2543
02:13:06,979 --> 02:13:09,319
- Did you see that? - What is it?

2544
02:13:10,850 --> 02:13:14,619
(The contestants who transcend an idol audition show up.)

2545
02:13:16,029 --> 02:13:18,630
(From a taekwondo performance)

2546
02:13:18,760 --> 02:13:20,629
I'm a TikToker with 2.3 million followers.

2547
02:13:20,630 --> 02:13:22,069
- What, 2.3 million? - What?

2548
02:13:22,300 --> 02:13:23,770
(Even the popular dance is performed.)

2549
02:13:24,399 --> 02:13:25,569
Isn't it twerking?

2550
02:13:25,739 --> 02:13:28,109
(All girl groups, move aside.)

2551
02:13:29,340 --> 02:13:30,608
(Next comes the Techtonik dance.)

2552
02:13:30,609 --> 02:13:31,939
How restrained.

2553
02:13:32,680 --> 02:13:33,739
He's restrained.

2554
02:13:35,550 --> 02:13:38,449
(The girl group dance party)

2555
02:13:39,420 --> 02:13:41,420
(Performances continue.)

2556
02:13:42,590 --> 02:13:43,749
(Modern dance)

2557
02:13:43,750 --> 02:13:46,090
(And tutting)

2558
02:13:50,359 --> 02:13:52,460
(Even rhumba)

2559
02:13:52,630 --> 02:13:54,869
(Their evaluations are giving way completely.)

2560
02:13:55,699 --> 02:13:57,670
(An unimagined classy specialty)

2561
02:13:58,340 --> 02:14:00,438
(And this healthy-teeth dance marks the peak.)

2562
02:14:00,439 --> 02:14:01,840
Thank you.

2563
02:14:01,909 --> 02:14:03,539
(You're welcome.)

2564
02:14:03,739 --> 02:14:05,310
Stop now.

2565
02:14:05,979 --> 02:14:07,978
(The 4 models are here for the idol audition.)

2566
02:14:07,979 --> 02:14:09,310
What a model.

2567
02:14:09,510 --> 02:14:11,519
(To take over "Project 7,")

2568
02:14:11,520 --> 02:14:13,180
(the tall contestants have come.)

2569
02:14:13,550 --> 02:14:15,419
His face changes immediately.

2570
02:14:15,420 --> 02:14:17,550
(Professional)

2571
02:14:18,789 --> 02:14:20,260
Don't come too close.

2572
02:14:20,890 --> 02:14:22,589
Why would you...

2573
02:14:22,590 --> 02:14:24,090
(Leaving a strong impression)

2574
02:14:24,659 --> 02:14:27,028
I deliver facts quickly and precisely with my young spirit.

2575
02:14:27,029 --> 02:14:29,198
Do you mind if I ask you a question?

2576
02:14:29,199 --> 02:14:31,739
(The model trainees are so talented.)

2577
02:14:32,569 --> 02:14:35,068
Let's talk more after your performance.

2578
02:14:35,069 --> 02:14:36,170
Oh, sure.

2579
02:14:36,869 --> 02:14:38,340
(Will their skills be as good as their talents?)

2580
02:14:38,810 --> 02:14:41,140
(Singing)

2581
02:14:56,859 --> 02:14:59,729
(Unlike their flashy appearances, the performances are disappointing.)

2582
02:15:00,430 --> 02:15:01,899
NA YOONJAE.

2583
02:15:02,369 --> 02:15:04,069
- You're eliminated. - Okay.

2584
02:15:04,229 --> 02:15:06,840
What you have isn't enough...

2585
02:15:07,170 --> 02:15:09,369
to go up against those guys.

2586
02:15:11,109 --> 02:15:13,109
Trainee KIM YOONSUE.

2587
02:15:14,479 --> 02:15:16,479
- We'll defer our decision. - Okay.

2588
02:15:17,210 --> 02:15:21,249
Okay. It's time for the most important part, your performance.

2589
02:15:21,250 --> 02:15:22,250
Okay.

2590
02:15:23,090 --> 02:15:25,259
Before I became a model,

2591
02:15:25,260 --> 02:15:28,189
I was an idol trainee.

2592
02:15:30,989 --> 02:15:33,760
(A dream he has kept deep inside of his heart)

2593
02:15:35,199 --> 02:15:37,670
(He finds another opportunity)

2594
02:15:37,699 --> 02:15:38,868
I like being a model too,

2595
02:15:38,869 --> 02:15:42,539
but my ultimate goal was to become an idol.

2596
02:15:43,170 --> 02:15:45,439
I really want to achieve my dream.

2597
02:15:47,510 --> 02:15:50,180
("Euphoria" by KWON YANGWOO)

2598
02:16:27,979 --> 02:16:29,220
Thank you.

2599
02:16:33,989 --> 02:16:36,328
I'll announce the result.

2600
02:16:36,329 --> 02:16:37,329
Okay.

2601
02:16:38,760 --> 02:16:41,030
Trainee KWON YANGWOO.

2602
02:16:41,600 --> 02:16:45,540
(Will he pass and continue his dream to become an idol?)

2603
02:16:47,700 --> 02:16:49,639
- You passed. - Thank you.

2604
02:16:50,469 --> 02:16:51,639
Thank you.

2605
02:16:52,409 --> 02:16:55,548
There are a lot of parts in this dance...

2606
02:16:55,549 --> 02:16:57,779
where you have to extend your limbs.

2607
02:16:57,780 --> 02:16:59,718
You have an advantage in that sense.

2608
02:16:59,719 --> 02:17:02,950
There are many people who can't do that even if they want to.

2609
02:17:03,889 --> 02:17:06,189
You have a good style, and your song selection was good.

2610
02:17:06,190 --> 02:17:07,360
Thank you.

2611
02:17:08,090 --> 02:17:09,388
- Good job. - Good job.

2612
02:17:09,389 --> 02:17:10,459
Thank you.

2613
02:17:11,829 --> 02:17:15,600
I'm so thrilled that I passed.

2614
02:17:15,799 --> 02:17:18,068
Since they gave me a pass,

2615
02:17:18,069 --> 02:17:19,769
I'll try very hard...

2616
02:17:19,770 --> 02:17:23,238
and show everyone my debut through "Project 7."

2617
02:17:23,239 --> 02:17:24,339
Please keep an eye on me.

2618
02:17:24,340 --> 02:17:26,479
(Please keep an eye on me.)

2619
02:17:29,549 --> 02:17:31,379
The main characters are coming now.

2620
02:17:31,920 --> 02:17:33,578
- Who? - The people who have debuted.

2621
02:17:33,579 --> 02:17:35,048
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2622
02:17:35,049 --> 02:17:38,049
(Many trainees are excited to see this team.)

2623
02:17:38,149 --> 02:17:39,159
Hello.

2624
02:17:40,120 --> 02:17:41,420
Hello.

2625
02:17:42,129 --> 02:17:44,229
- Hello. - Oh, my.

2626
02:17:44,290 --> 02:17:45,958
- Two, three. Hello. - Hello.

2627
02:17:45,959 --> 02:17:47,229
- Thank you for having us. - Thank you for having us.

2628
02:17:48,430 --> 02:17:50,629
- Thank you. - You're here again?

2629
02:17:51,129 --> 02:17:53,340
- Hello. Thank you for having us. - Hello. Thank you for having us.

2630
02:17:54,500 --> 02:17:56,840
- Thank you. - You're here again?

2631
02:17:57,309 --> 02:17:58,478
Yes.

2632
02:17:58,479 --> 02:18:00,510
(These trainees who surprised Ryan Sewon Jhun...)

2633
02:18:00,940 --> 02:18:04,379
(were on "Peak Time" last year.)

2634
02:18:04,850 --> 02:18:08,250
(They're a talented idol group who showed off...)

2635
02:18:09,090 --> 02:18:12,190
(their perfect looks and performances and got 5th place.)

2636
02:18:15,959 --> 02:18:17,658
- Two, three. Hello. - Hello.

2637
02:18:17,659 --> 02:18:18,959
- Thank you for having us. - Thank you for having us.

2638
02:18:20,959 --> 02:18:22,129
Well...

2639
02:18:23,569 --> 02:18:25,340
I can't ask them any questions.

2640
02:18:25,770 --> 02:18:27,440
I can't ask them any questions.

2641
02:18:28,739 --> 02:18:29,869
That's how I feel.

2642
02:18:29,870 --> 02:18:32,979
(Surprised)

2643
02:18:33,010 --> 02:18:35,349
Please go ahead. I can't.

2644
02:18:35,350 --> 02:18:36,378
(The directors are surprised too.)

2645
02:18:36,379 --> 02:18:37,850
- All right. - Please go ahead.

2646
02:18:43,190 --> 02:18:45,919
I'll ask you some questions.

2647
02:18:45,920 --> 02:18:47,619
You're joining another survival show...

2648
02:18:47,620 --> 02:18:50,228
after being on "Peak Time."

2649
02:18:50,229 --> 02:18:51,360
- Yes. - Yes.

2650
02:18:51,700 --> 02:18:53,959
What made you want to do that?

2651
02:18:54,930 --> 02:18:59,340
We joined "Peak Time" because we wanted people...

2652
02:18:59,600 --> 02:19:01,340
to know about our group.

2653
02:19:01,739 --> 02:19:04,039
Of course, more people recognized us,

2654
02:19:04,040 --> 02:19:05,908
supported us,

2655
02:19:05,909 --> 02:19:07,510
and listened to our music after that.

2656
02:19:07,909 --> 02:19:09,749
But there wasn't a big change.

2657
02:19:09,750 --> 02:19:12,648
We're still seeking more,

2658
02:19:12,649 --> 02:19:15,850
and we still want to share our music with more people.

2659
02:19:16,590 --> 02:19:18,019
Of course, we were worried...

2660
02:19:18,020 --> 02:19:21,190
about joining as individuals and not as a team.

2661
02:19:21,690 --> 02:19:25,559
But we thought it was more important...

2662
02:19:25,700 --> 02:19:29,969
to make the music and performances we want to make.

2663
02:19:30,670 --> 02:19:32,799
So no matter how many tries it takes,

2664
02:19:33,100 --> 02:19:35,540
we'll keep joining these shows...

2665
02:19:35,569 --> 02:19:38,209
in order to chase and achieve that dream.

2666
02:19:38,979 --> 02:19:40,680
- So I... - Yes?

2667
02:19:41,680 --> 02:19:43,379
- So I... - Yes?

2668
02:19:46,620 --> 02:19:50,620
I can't ask them any questions.

2669
02:19:53,489 --> 02:19:55,589
Why are you here?

2670
02:19:55,590 --> 02:19:57,629
I didn't even imagine that they'd be here.

2671
02:19:58,459 --> 02:19:59,600
And...

2672
02:20:03,899 --> 02:20:05,000
You go ahead.

2673
02:20:09,239 --> 02:20:12,139
As for Director Ryan Sewon Jhun,

2674
02:20:13,180 --> 02:20:16,609
we worked with him on the title song...

2675
02:20:16,610 --> 02:20:18,579
of our third mini album from two years ago.

2676
02:20:18,780 --> 02:20:20,780
After working with him on that,

2677
02:20:20,850 --> 02:20:23,889
he became like an older brother...

2678
02:20:24,020 --> 02:20:26,619
who watched everything we went through.

2679
02:20:26,620 --> 02:20:28,159
Of course, he's our director now.

2680
02:20:28,729 --> 02:20:31,430
He always told us,

2681
02:20:31,829 --> 02:20:34,860
"You guys can do it. You can succeed."

2682
02:20:34,959 --> 02:20:36,930
He told us that a lot.

2683
02:20:37,569 --> 02:20:39,969
But we didn't succeed.

2684
02:20:40,569 --> 02:20:42,610
And it's been about two years.

2685
02:20:43,409 --> 02:20:46,280
I think Director Ryan Sewon Jhun...

2686
02:20:46,639 --> 02:20:51,920
became emotional because he saw that we were still trying hard.

2687
02:20:52,520 --> 02:20:56,420
So we wanted to show him that we have improved.

2688
02:20:56,620 --> 02:21:00,059
We're going to do our best so we don't have any regrets.

2689
02:21:03,860 --> 02:21:05,158
("Jopping" by KIM HYUNWOO, PARK JUNSEO,)

2690
02:21:05,159 --> 02:21:06,559
(YOO YOUNGSEO, JEON MINWOOK)

2691
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:08,128
Oh, "Jopping."

2692
02:21:08,129 --> 02:21:09,600
They're so cool.

2693
02:21:23,149 --> 02:21:25,479
- They're so in sync. - Look at their power.

2694
02:21:35,229 --> 02:21:37,489
- Their synchronization. - The sound of their steps.

2695
02:21:40,299 --> 02:21:41,559
His mic transmitter fell off.

2696
02:22:01,319 --> 02:22:03,590
- They're so good. - Oh, my.

2697
02:22:15,159 --> 02:22:16,569
They're real idols.

2698
02:22:23,340 --> 02:22:24,709
They really came prepared.

2699
02:22:34,350 --> 02:22:35,790
Their energy.

2700
02:22:46,700 --> 02:22:47,959
He's so good at dancing.

2701
02:22:50,170 --> 02:22:51,829
They're different.

2702
02:22:53,399 --> 02:22:55,200
This choreography is intense.

2703
02:23:01,809 --> 02:23:03,750
That was basically a real performance.

2704
02:23:04,049 --> 02:23:05,450
That's a true team.

2705
02:23:06,180 --> 02:23:08,790
- "Project 7" is over. - That was insane.

2706
02:23:18,659 --> 02:23:19,930
How can I put this?

2707
02:23:20,200 --> 02:23:22,069
You did so well today.

2708
02:23:22,770 --> 02:23:26,000
When you first started,

2709
02:23:26,700 --> 02:23:29,509
your choreography was so in sync.

2710
02:23:29,510 --> 02:23:31,239
You were so cool.

2711
02:23:31,940 --> 02:23:33,738
Of course, there are aspects...

2712
02:23:33,739 --> 02:23:36,648
you have to improve on individually.

2713
02:23:36,649 --> 02:23:42,189
But your performance as a team of four was great.

2714
02:23:42,190 --> 02:23:45,489
It was very energetic and nice.

2715
02:23:45,590 --> 02:23:47,488
- Yes. I enjoyed it. - Thank you.

2716
02:23:47,489 --> 02:23:48,889
- I... - Yes.

2717
02:23:49,059 --> 02:23:50,259
To be honest,

2718
02:23:50,260 --> 02:23:52,599
I noticed many mistakes during the performance.

2719
02:23:52,600 --> 02:23:53,959
- There were many mistakes. - Yes.

2720
02:23:54,360 --> 02:23:56,828
I think it's really important...

2721
02:23:56,829 --> 02:23:58,638
how you deal with those mistakes.

2722
02:23:58,639 --> 02:24:02,309
But you have some experience being on stage.

2723
02:24:02,809 --> 02:24:04,209
You took your name tag off.

2724
02:24:05,639 --> 02:24:07,138
- The mic transmitter fell off, - He just...

2725
02:24:07,139 --> 02:24:09,279
but you naturally grabbed it and kept going.

2726
02:24:09,280 --> 02:24:11,279
Those things...

2727
02:24:11,280 --> 02:24:14,449
- made the performance high-quality. - Right.

2728
02:24:14,450 --> 02:24:15,818
You know I was on a different audition program...

2729
02:24:15,819 --> 02:24:17,319
- last year, right? - Yes.

2730
02:24:17,889 --> 02:24:20,760
While I was watching your performance,

2731
02:24:21,190 --> 02:24:25,359
the way you danced so hard with your whole body...

2732
02:24:25,360 --> 02:24:27,299
- You put everything into it. - That really...

2733
02:24:28,770 --> 02:24:30,170
That was really cool.

2734
02:24:30,370 --> 02:24:31,969
- Thank you. - It was...

2735
02:24:32,200 --> 02:24:33,969
It was really awesome. It was really cool.

2736
02:24:36,670 --> 02:24:40,709
It really touched me.

2737
02:24:41,440 --> 02:24:43,110
And actually,

2738
02:24:44,250 --> 02:24:47,819
we debuted around the same time, and we're in the same field.

2739
02:24:48,790 --> 02:24:49,989
I want you to do your best...

2740
02:24:50,620 --> 02:24:55,590
so we can all work hard and perform.

2741
02:24:56,159 --> 02:24:58,958
I'll announce the result.

2742
02:24:58,959 --> 02:25:00,059
(Time to announce the result)

2743
02:25:02,399 --> 02:25:03,568

02:25:08,299 --> 02:25:10,110

02:25:10,139 --> 02:25:11,370
- Thank you! - Thank you!

- Thank you. - Call me sometimes.

2749
02:25:13,440 --> 02:25:14,510
Okay.

2750
02:25:16,149 --> 02:25:17,808
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2751
02:25:17,809 --> 02:25:19,250
- Thank you. - Good job.

2752
02:25:19,450 --> 02:25:20,450
Thank you.

2753
02:25:20,579 --> 02:25:22,819
I didn't even imagine that they'd be here.

2754
02:25:23,520 --> 02:25:25,049
That surprised me.

2755
02:25:26,260 --> 02:25:27,318
We'll defer our decision.

2756
02:25:27,319 --> 02:25:28,789
(Zero Setting is coming to an end.)

2757
02:25:28,790 --> 02:25:29,889
You're eliminated.

2758
02:25:30,090 --> 02:25:31,459
- Okay. - Good work.

2759
02:25:31,559 --> 02:25:34,599
My standards are getting higher the longer we do this.

2760
02:25:34,600 --> 02:25:35,629
Right.

2761
02:25:35,729 --> 02:25:36,769
We'll defer our decision.

2762
02:25:36,770 --> 02:25:40,270
(Many trainees didn't make the cut.)

2763
02:25:40,840 --> 02:25:43,440
(Through the pass draught?)

2764
02:25:43,709 --> 02:25:45,010
- You passed. - You passed.

2765
02:25:45,170 --> 02:25:47,940

(Zero Setting is over.)

2767
02:25:51,510 --> 02:25:54,620
(Of the 68 deferred trainees, a total of 30 will pass.)

2768
02:25:54,879 --> 02:25:56,919
I saw many trainees...

2769
02:25:56,920 --> 02:26:00,359
who had great looks but lacked in dancing and singing.

2770
02:26:00,360 --> 02:26:03,259
But I thought they could improve quickly...

2771
02:26:03,260 --> 02:26:04,728
with our coaching.

2772
02:26:04,729 --> 02:26:09,200
I've seen many bad dancers become good dancers.

2773
02:26:09,569 --> 02:26:12,239
I want to see number four in person.

2774
02:26:12,569 --> 02:26:14,739
- I like this one. - He's good.

2775
02:26:15,040 --> 02:26:18,339
Why would they defer a trainee like this?

2776
02:26:18,340 --> 02:26:20,078
Is he a bit short?

2777
02:26:20,079 --> 02:26:21,739
Height doesn't matter, does it?

2778
02:26:22,280 --> 02:26:24,378
- You can't judge by their height. - I wasn't...

2779
02:26:24,379 --> 02:26:26,979
I didn't mean it like that. Hold on.

2780
02:26:27,079 --> 02:26:31,449
I think it's quality versus novelty.

2781
02:26:31,450 --> 02:26:35,489
I think failing him could cause a big controversy.

2782
02:26:38,590 --> 02:26:41,030
So far, 70 trainees have passed.

2783
02:26:41,229 --> 02:26:42,929
Of the 100 available spots,

2784
02:26:42,930 --> 02:26:45,370
only 30 spots remain.

2785
02:26:45,600 --> 02:26:47,468
I'll now announce the additional 30 trainees...

2786
02:26:47,469 --> 02:26:49,239
who have passed.

2787
02:26:54,239 --> 02:26:58,110

(30 additional trainees)

2795
02:27:16,870 --> 02:27:19,869
Through Zero Setting, we now have 100 trainees...

2796
02:27:19,870 --> 02:27:22,040
who will be part of the global vote.

(This is Project Village.)

2804
02:27:46,229 --> 02:27:47,700
It feels kind of like Europe.

2805

(The 100 trainees are here.)

2806
02:27:51,600 --> 02:27:53,600
I didn't know there was a place like this in Korea.

2808
02:27:56,909 --> 02:27:58,539
- Where are we going? - This place is huge.

2809
02:27:58,540 --> 02:27:59,878
Oh, my gosh.

2810
02:27:59,879 --> 02:28:01,110
The camera is filming us.

2811
02:28:01,239 --> 02:28:02,579
Hello!

2812
02:28:02,709 --> 02:28:03,909
What are we doing here today?

2813
02:28:03,950 --> 02:28:05,209
I'm excited.

2814
02:28:05,450 --> 02:28:07,619
(Episode 2 will begin in a moment.)

2815
02:28:07,620 --> 02:28:09,750
Can this place house all 100 of us?
