1
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,310
Husband, look.

2
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,560
Jianxing is back.

3
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,840
So you do remember to come home.

4
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,070
Say a little less.

5
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,070
Jianxing, it's been so long.

6
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,310
Why are you only coming back now?

7
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,510
Come, let your mother take a look at you.

8
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,400
Madam, you spoil him too much.

9
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,310
Go on, tell us.

10
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,790
Where did you run off to this time?

11
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,480
Just say a little less, will you?

12
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,310
Look how thin the child has gotten.

13
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,870
The banquet is about to start.

14
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,760
Mother even made your favorite osmanthus cake.

15
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,200
Come on, it's time to go home.

16
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,920
Brother Jianxing.

17
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,310
It seems the scene brings back memories.

18
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,560
Probably when you were young,

19
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,680
you came here with your father, right?

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,680
Lord Hu.

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,310
You have been here before too, haven't you?

22
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,910
I'm ashamed.

23
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,120
Although I've known General Li for many years,

24
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,150
I've only met him a few times in the capital.

25
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,870
I've never set foot in Lingzhou.

26
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:47,710
My lord, hurry.

27
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:52,870
Hurry up, hurry up.

28
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,750
Move faster, a bit higher.

29
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:55,870
To the right.

30
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,150
Higher.

31
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,190
Higher, higher.

32
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,310
To the left, to the left.

33
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,000
Is that good?

34
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,680
A bit to the right.

35
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,630
To the right.

36
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,470
Excuse me, brother, may I ask—

37
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,750
I...

38
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,400
Who is that?

39
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,590
No idea.

40
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:32,750
Sir.

41
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,430
This family is quite strange.

42
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,910
What are you doing? Get to work.

43
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,080
Don't miss the time.

44
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,280
Yes.

45
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,190
May I ask who you are?

46
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,240
I am Hu Li.

47
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,590
I was formerly a broker at Guangyuan Trading Company.

48
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,680
Recently, I've been traveling the world with my family.

49
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,310
This is my daughter, Hu Lailei.

50
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,800
This brave young man

51
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,360
is my son,

52
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,190
Hu Tu.

53
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,000
This handsome young man

54
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,680
is my attendant.

55
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,310
Today, I happened to pass through Lingzhou.

56
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,680
I was delighted to hear of your happy occasion.

57
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,520
So I came to offer my congratulations.

58
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,390
I've prepared a small gift, please kindly accept it.

59
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:29,830
Please, accept it quickly.

60
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,510
Thank you so much.

61
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,560
The wedding is scheduled for tomorrow.

62
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:39,390
Why don't you honored guests stay with us for a couple of days?

63
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,480
Our household

64
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,510
hasn't been this lively in a long time.

65
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,390
Thank you for your hospitality.

66
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:52,720
Then we shall gladly accept your invitation.

67
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:53,830
Very well.

68
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,190
Qiao'er.

69
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,000
Come with me and take our guests to their rooms.

70
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,390
Yes, Madam.

71
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,310
This way, please.

72
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,630
After you, sister.

73
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,920
To be honest with everyone,

74
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,560
this ritual is for my son's late wives.

75
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,430
I'm afraid they might not rest in peace.

76
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,190
This doesn't seem like a ceremony for the afterlife.

77
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,070
It feels more like a ritual to calm restless spirits.

78
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,040
I'm sure you've all heard

79
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:03,190
that several of my son Xu Qiyan's previous wives

80
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,870
all died in this very garden.

81
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,040
There are rumors outside

82
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,270
that it's the ghost of General Li Zuo causing trouble.

83
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,160
That's pure nonsense.

84
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,160
Back then, General Li once saved my husband's life.

85
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,430
Everyone in the Xu household

86
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,160
is grateful for General Li's kindness.

87
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,480
But outsiders don't believe that.

88
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,120
In recent years, whenever we've held celebrations,

89
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,310
very few friends or relatives

90
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,750
have been willing to come and congratulate us.

91
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,000
I don't believe there are ghosts in this world.

92
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,600
But if there really are,

93
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,310
I'd actually like to meet one.

94
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,240
Young people should know respect and fear.

95
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,040
Do you know that those vengeful spirits

96
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,510
might be watching you right now?

97
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,190
I have a clear conscience.

98
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,430
I'm not afraid of ghosts knocking at my door.

99
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,720
Young master, this is your guest room.

100
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:23,430
Thank you.

101
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,190
Jianxing

102
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,000
Jianxing

103
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:01,870
Jianxing

104
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,190
Mother, I'm scared.

105
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,680
Don't be afraid, Jianxing. Mother is here.

106
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,000
In a moment,

107
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,310
No matter what you see in a moment,

108
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,240
you must be like your father,

109
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,310
and be a strong and upright man, okay?

110
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:10,950
Okay.

111
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,240
Like this,

112
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,360
Mother will take you to

113
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,430
the secret room where we used to play hide-and-seek.

114
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,190
We must hide well, all right?

115
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,160
Okay.

116
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,190
We must hide well.

117
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,240
Let's go.

118
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,310
Young master.

119
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:30,720
Qiao'er, Qiao'er.

120
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,560
Look what tasty treat I brought you.

121
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:34,950
Here you go.

122
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,680
I secretly took this from the kitchen.

123
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,720
I was almost caught by my mother.

124
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,920
Thank you, young master.

125
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,200
Is it tasty?

126
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,360
It's delicious.

127
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,150
I love osmanthus cake the most.

128
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,320
All of these are for you.

129
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,750
Eat slowly, don't rush.

130
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,870
Li Jianxing

131
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:53,720
Run, you rascal!

132
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,030
Did you sneak into the kitchen for food again?

133
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:56,790
Stop right there!

134
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,600
Miss Qiao'er

135
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,030
Long time no see.

136
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,120
When Madam Xu just called you Qiao'er,

137
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,550
I thought it was just someone with the same name.

138
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,960
I didn't expect it to really be you.

139
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,150
Young master, you've changed so much over the years.

140
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,360
I almost didn't recognize you at first.

141
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,200
I just didn't expect all these things to happen afterward.

142
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:17,720
In a way, it was lucky.

143
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,000
You happened to sneak into the kitchen to steal some osmanthus cake.

144
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,750
And fell asleep in the firewood pile.

145
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,200
That's how you escaped the disaster.

146
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,670
Yes.

147
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,320
But ever since then,

148
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,390
the young master and I have been separated.

149
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,790
For these twelve years,

150
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,440
I haven't heard any news about you.

151
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,120
All these years,

152
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,960
life must have been hard for you.

153
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,550
I'm alright.

154
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,150
But what about you?

155
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,750
Why are you working as a maid again?

156
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,750
I'm just a poor family's daughter.

157
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,270
Being a maid is my fate.

158
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,120
Besides,

159
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,150
Madam Li treated me very well back then.

160
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,150
I still have feelings for this place.

161
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,200
There's always a bit of attachment in my heart.

162
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,390
By the way,

163
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,320
Miss Qiao'er,

164
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,550
can you do me a favor?

165
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,200
Please don't tell anyone about my identity.

166
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:04,600
Including

167
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,480
the people who are traveling with me.

168
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,200
Don't worry, young master.

169
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,200
I understand.

170
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:12,840
Thank you.

171
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,120
Then I won't disturb your rest any longer.

172
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,480
Brother Jianxing, sword—

173
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:40,750
Brother Jianxing, you really are quite the ladies' man.

174
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,440
Judging by Lord Hu's tone,

175
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:43,720
he sounds jealous.

176
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,670
There was a case at the Dali Court recently.

177
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,630
A playboy,

178
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,910
because he flirted everywhere,

179
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,720
was torn apart by several women.

180
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,480
Brother Jianxing,

181
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,240
you'd better be careful.

182
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,960
Thank you for your concern, Lord Hu.

183
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:08,510
I, Li Jianxing, have a clear conscience.

184
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,200
I'm not afraid of ghosts knocking at my door at midnight.

185
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,150
What brings you to me?

186
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,440
Madam Xu is inviting us to a banquet tonight.
