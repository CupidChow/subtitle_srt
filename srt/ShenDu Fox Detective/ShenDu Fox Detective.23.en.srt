1
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,950
The bride's rouge

2
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,070
I understand.

3
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,710
After arriving at the stage,

4
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:18,190
Qiao'er made a net with rope and a curtain.

5
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,520
She placed the bride onto the net.

6
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,190
She pulled it up to a height close to the beam.

7
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,030
Qiao'er secured it.

8
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,080
After the bride was positioned on the beam,

9
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,630
she tied the rope around the bride.

10
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,840
She staged a scene to make it look like the bride committed suicide.

11
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,520
Then she returned to the bridal room.

12
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,150
She placed a paper figure in front of the window.

13
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,470
Miss Qiao'er, I'm here to return the key.

14
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,150
Qiao'er, here's your key back.

15
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:19,840
Thank you.

16
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,310
You're welcome. I'll head back now.

17
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,400
Alright, go ahead.

18
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,960
When Tiantian comes back to return the key,

19
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,030
she'll see the shadow by the window and testify for her.

20
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,000
This proves Madam Liu was still alive at that time.

21
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,590
This shows

22
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,910
even Tiantian losing the key

23
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,630
was all part of her plan.

24
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,190
It was to create her alibi.

25
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,750
If we reason with Qiao'er as the real culprit,

26
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,800
then Xu Qiyan is not the murderer.

27
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,910
So how did she enter the locked room

28
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,190
and kill Xu Qiyan?

29
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,400
Xu Qiyan's bloodstains

30
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,310
were all cleaned up.

31
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,510
It seems all the evidence has been wiped clean.

32
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,000
Rotting corpse

33
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,160
Candle

34
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,430
Blood

35
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,160
Body fragrance

36
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:54,630
Young master

37
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,680
It's Qiao'er's body fragrance

38
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,870
With a scent of osmanthus incense

39
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,240
It's right here

40
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,560
Qiao'er's body fragrance remained here

41
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,800
How did Qiao'er kill someone

42
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,120
and still leave the secret room

43
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,560
Or maybe she never left at all

44
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,800
but hid among the paper figures

45
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,390
Tiantian

46
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,560
At that time, Hu Zhengyi saw the woman performing opera

47
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:01,000
That was also Qiao'er in heavy makeup, pretending

48
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,600
All for the purpose of

49
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,510
making the haunting seem real

50
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,600
and misleading everyone

51
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,390
Young master, you're still as clever as ever.

52
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,040
I knew you would figure it out.

53
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:39,750
Qiao'er

54
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,390
I never thought you could be so ruthless.

55
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,630
Hurting so many innocent people.

56
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,240
Innocent?

57
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,000
Who is truly innocent?

58
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,390
Are these two your daughters?

59
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,240
Yes, yes.

60
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,430
How much silver?

61
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,270
Five taels for the older one, three for the younger.

62
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,560
No, that's too expensive.

63
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,830
The younger one will be sent to the general's mansion as a maid.

64
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,950
They might not even want her.

65
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,000
The younger one isn't worth much, but the older one is.

66
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:08,950
The older one can sing opera.

67
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,000
Sell her to the opera troupe.

68
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,830
She'll definitely fetch more than that.

69
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,160
Fine, eight taels it is.

70
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,480
Father, I don't want to be separated from my sister.

71
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,160
Go, go.

72
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,430
Qiao'er

73
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,750
Sister, I don't want to be apart from you.

74
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,480
Qiao'er, be good.

75
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,000
Qiao'er, don't cry.

76
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,720
Once I've sung opera for two years and earned enough money,

77
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,120
I'll definitely buy your freedom.

78
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,870
Wait for me, okay?

79
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,080
She sings so well.

80
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:44,790
Yes, it's beautiful.

81
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,840
Really impressive.

82
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,510
This performance is also good.

83
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,320
Look, she's so pretty.

84
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,270
This part is great.

85
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,480
Thank you.

86
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,030
Troupe leader.

87
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,360
Young master, what can I do for you?

88
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,240
What is this young lady's name?

89
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,120
Yun Yin.

90
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,670
I want to buy Yun Yin's freedom.

91
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,550
My lady

92
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,670
Drink this cup of wedding wine

93
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,440
and we will be husband and wife.

94
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,790
Drink.

95
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,150
Stop! Don't run!

96
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,030
Madam Yunyin, stop running.

97
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,000
Come back with us.

98
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,510
Gentlemen,

99
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,270
please have mercy.

100
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,910
Let me go.

101
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,030
I...

102
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,480
I'll kneel before you.

103
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,360
Enough talk.

104
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,840
Don't take me back.

105
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,630
Let's go.

106
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,750
Let go, move!

107
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,390
I don't want to go back.

108
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,870
Let me go!

109
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,550
Dear, you can't run anymore.

110
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,840
It pains me.

111
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,030
Look,

112
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,750
I bought you a new opera costume.

113
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,440
This color suits you so well.

114
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,670
You'll look stunning in it.

115
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,030
My dear,

116
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,080
I'll have the steward

117
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,870
build a big stage at the residence.

118
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,000
Then, whenever you want to perform,

119
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,670
you can sing anytime.

120
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,630
And also,

121
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,390
I'll have the servants

122
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,510
plant all your favorite flowers at the residence.

123
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,600
Everything you like,

124
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,480
I'll make sure you have it.

125
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:14,910
But there's one thing,

126
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,480
just one thing.

127
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,790
From now on, you can't leave the residence.

128
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,670
Not even a single step.

129
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,240
Be good.

130
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,000
Water

131
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:41,960
Fire

132
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,630
Fire

133
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,240
Someone, help!

134
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:47,600
Someone, help!

135
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,080
Quick, put out the fire!

136
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,240
Someone, help!

137
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:52,840
Hurry, someone!

138
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,840
Someone, help!

139
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,720
It was midnight at the time.

140
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,000
The servants were all asleep.

141
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,720
By the time they noticed the fire,

142
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,390
it was already too late.
