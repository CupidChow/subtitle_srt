1
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,430
It seems

2
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:07,880
you're quite familiar with this place.

3
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,680
Fox Emperor

4
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:27,840
Fox Emperor

5
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,040
I've heard of you.

6
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,000
Three years ago,

7
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,000
in the martial world,

8
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:39,680
five highly skilled heroes appeared one after another.

9
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,950
They became known as the Five Emperors.

10
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,310
I didn't expect you to be one of them.

11
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,710
Impressive, very impressive.

12
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,120
You're too kind.

13
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,040
Where is Dao Xing Nishi?

14
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,680
Fox Emperor, let me take you there.

15
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,350
Let's go, let's go.

16
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:13,120
Is it because of your sharp nose

17
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,400
that you're called the Fox Emperor?

18
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,000
That's just a rumor in the martial world.

19
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,750
But my abilities aren't limited to my nose.

20
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,400
Where did you get your mask made?

21
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,430
Tomorrow I'll have Zeng Sheng make one for me too.

22
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,870
This material is rare black iron from the Western Regions.

23
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,310
It's extremely rare.

24
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,870
It can't be replicated.

25
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,430
Master Hu,

26
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,240
I must remind you,

27
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,960
don't pretend to be one of the Five Emperors lightly.

28
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,240
You might bring disaster upon yourself.

29
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,520
Who, who, who is this?

30
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,470
Fox Emperor, you're joking.

31
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,750
I just thought it looked nice, that's all.

32
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,470
What's so funny?

33
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,470
In official circles,

34
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:02,710
everyone secretly calls me the old fox.

35
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,520
I never thought

36
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,280
I'd get to know a young fox like you.

37
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,840
It's fate.

38
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,310
Do you know how a fox cries?

39
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,000
The martial arts contest begins now.

40
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,590
Alright, alright, alright.

41
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,960
Excuse me, coming through.

42
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:27,680
Thank you.

43
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,590
This is Dao Xing, the Reverse Master, right?

44
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,520
Let me introduce you.

45
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,400
This arena event is held once a month.

46
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,000
If we win,

47
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,680
we can have the Three-Eyed Demon Daoist

48
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,430
bring over the person we're looking for.

49
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,840
The Three-Eyed Demon Daoist.

50
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,470
That's right.

51
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,680
Legend has it he has three eyes.

52
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,360
In my experience,

53
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,120
divination isn't suitable for solving cases or catching criminals.

54
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,910
But we don't have any leads right now anyway.

55
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,360
So why not let him try?

56
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:06,910
The match is decided.

57
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,400
The winner is Ghost Scholar.

58
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,680
Wow, impressive.

59
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,800
Are there any more challengers?

60
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,430
But you're still injured.

61
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,910
It's not suitable for you to fight again.

62
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,030
Isn't there still you?

63
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,150
Master Hu, it's your turn.

64
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,830
Alright, the contestant has entered.

65
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,560
The match begins.

66
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,160
This joke has gone too far.

67
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,390
I'm not good at arena fighting.

68
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,310
What weapon do you excel at?

69
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,040
I'm not skilled with weapons.

70
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,160
Use my sword.

71
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,600
Catch.

72
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,040
Don't you still owe me a life?

73
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,000
It's a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding.

74
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,800
I admit defeat.

75
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,120
There's no such thing as admitting defeat in the Ghost Market.

76
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,720
Since you've come up here,

77
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,630
you're my opponent.

78
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,430
This is the final round.

79
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,630
As long as you beat me,

80
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,510
you'll be the champion.

81
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,830
Let's just go easy on each other.

82
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,750
Brother.

83
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,040
Alright.

84
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,600
Then let's just go easy.

85
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,120
Your skills are impressive.

86
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,040
I didn't expect you to be so skilled.

87
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,070
I lost.

88
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,750
Alright.

89
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,800
The outcome is decided.

90
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,870
The outcome is decided.

91
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,270
The winner is the Golden Rooster Hero.

92
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,480
Alright.

93
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,560
Hurry, take us to meet the person.

94
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,190
Yes, yes, of course.

95
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:53,920
What's going on?

96
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:57,160
Old friend, it's just for show.

97
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,720
Couldn't you have told me in advance?

98
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,310
What do you think of my "chickens fly and eggs break" move?

99
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,190
Alright, alright, alright.

100
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:18,480
You won the match and still used tricks.

101
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:25,120
As long as it follows your rules, isn't that enough?

102
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:26,950
You won't refuse to count it, will you?

103
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,870
Fox Emperor, you really know how to joke.

104
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,390
You came to ask me—how could I not answer?

105
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,510
Why talk about rules now?

106
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,190
You know them too?

107
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,000
An old friend.

108
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,870
Then why did you make me fight in the match?

109
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,510
Friends are friends,

110
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,000
but we still have to follow their rules.

111
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,630
Since they're your friend,

112
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,800
why aren't you the one following the rules?

113
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,920
Why aren't you the one fighting in the match?

114
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,390
What do you want to ask?

115
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:07,270
Who is the real culprit behind the Phoenix case?

116
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,040
This...

117
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,240
The person you're looking for is

118
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,430
wearing a red robe,

119
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,360
and wearing a mask.

120
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:35,920
Wearing a mask.

121
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,630
Wearing a red robe and a mask.

122
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:40,510
What does that mean?

123
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,270
In the martial world, like you,

124
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,310
are there many people who wear masks?

125
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,720
The Five Emperors roam the martial world

126
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,270
and all appear wearing masks.

127
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,040
People in the martial world only recognize the masks,

128
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:55,950
not the people behind them.

129
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,480
Are you saying

130
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,870
it's one of the Five Emperors?

131
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,270
Have you asked the victim's family?

132
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:12,560
Daoist Master.

133
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,950
Dao Xing, Master Ni—respected elders.

134
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,160
Is it convenient for you?

135
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,800
I am her parent.

136
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,160
Who exactly killed her?

137
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:27,040
I will definitely tear that person to pieces.

138
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,070
This...

139
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,310
The master just said,

140
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,040
it was my daughter.

141
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:36,600
Who exactly killed her?

142
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:40,040
He must make sure this person is torn to pieces.

143
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,790
Why does Master Nishi speak like this?

144
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,910
Practicing the technique led to going astray.

145
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,320
There are aftereffects.

146
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,320
I think I understood that sentence.

147
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,120
Practiced early.

148
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,600
No, not that.

149
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:55,840
Going astray in cultivation.

150
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,840
Aftereffects, right?

151
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,960
But in the martial world, your daughter...

152
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,910
Did she have any enemies?

153
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,600
This...

154
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,390
When mentioning my daughter...

155
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:10,200
Blood God Sect and Bloodbath Technique...

156
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,670
My daughter mentioned them before.

157
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,080
The Bloodbath Technique and the Blood God Sect.

158
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,630
Blood God Sect?

159
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,390
Have you heard of it?

160
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,150
It seems this is the breakthrough.

161
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,390
On those corpses...

162
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,120
there was a strong smell of blood.

163
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,870
It seems before they died, the Blood God Sect...

164
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,790
they had been in a place full of blood.

165
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,960
Right, my daughter mentioned before...

166
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,600
she discovered an evil cult.

167
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:36,550
They wanted to harm people.

168
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,120
She said it needed to be investigated.

169
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,390
I advised her not to meddle anymore.

170
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,840
I didn't expect...

171
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,910
I didn't expect...

172
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,910
My condolences to both of you.

173
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,960
The murder weapon used by the killer

174
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:56,240
should also be an eagle hook.

175
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:03,080
Divine blood and fire illuminate the heavens.

176
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:08,120
May this light forever shine upon the world.

177
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:13,240
Divine blood and fire illuminate the heavens.

178
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,000
May this light

179
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,510
Who?

180
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:32,910
Chase!

181
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,120
After your daughter was injured,

182
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,320
she had already escaped danger.

183
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,870
But because the weapon was tainted with blood poison,

184
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,150
her blood could not clot.

185
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,960
She lost too much blood.

186
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,150
In the end,

187
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:50,270
she died at the gates of the Dali Temple.

188
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,360
How could this happen?

189
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,320
She is gone now.

190
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,750
I hope you both can find peace in this loss.

191
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,240
This Pure Yang Sword

192
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,200
was found by your daughter's side.

193
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,750
I am returning it to you now.

194
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,750
Please keep this sword.

195
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,510
We hope, Lord Fox Emperor,

196
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:21,000
that you can use this treasured sword to slay the murderer

197
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,240
and avenge our lost daughter.

198
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,670
My daughter...

199
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,000
My daughter...

200
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:50,480
It seems just as Dao Xing and Master Ni said.

201
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,390
The killer is connected to the Blood God Sect.

202
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,960
They need a large amount of blood.

203
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,840
There will definitely be more victims.

204
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:04,000
And the red robes mentioned by the Three-Eyed Daoist

205
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,790
also match up.

206
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,320
We finally have some clues.

207
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,510
Shen Xuan's sedative incense.

208
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:14,870
Lord Hu.

209
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,200
There’s so much miasma here.

210
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,670
Don’t get knocked out by it.

211
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,080
Don’t worry.

212
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,840
I’m well prepared.

213
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:50,910
Hu Zhengyi.

214
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,030
Hu Zhengyi.
