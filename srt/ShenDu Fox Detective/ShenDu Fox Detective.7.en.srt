1
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,200
Strange.

2
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,920
This poison is also colorless and tasteless.

3
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,230
I've never seen it before.

4
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,120
Sir.

5
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,040
There's powder from the flame stone all over the body.

6
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,590
Flame stone ignites easily.

7
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,040
Zeng Sheng, knife.

8
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:31,950
Come with me.

9
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,000
Zeng Sheng, go find a branch.

10
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:46,680
Here.

11
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,560
Don't make a sound in a moment.

12
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,120
Make him faint.

13
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,150
I'm not carrying you if you pass out.

14
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,070
Take it away from me.

15
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,280
If I so much as make a sound,

16
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,280
you'll be my godfather from now on.

17
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,920
I've heard of blood poison.

18
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,310
For now, we're just temporarily blocking it.

19
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,000
It won't spread throughout the body for a while.

20
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,240
However,

21
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,630
this is only a temporary solution.

22
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,240
It can't be eradicated.

23
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,150
It's fine.

24
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,280
I will definitely find the person behind this.

25
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,150
Let's go back.

26
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,030
If we don't leave now, it'll be curfew.

27
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,430
I don't want to stay here.

28
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,030
Let's go.

29
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,310
I... I want to...

30
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,310
I...

31
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,310
Hurry!

32
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:08,360
A ghost!

33
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:09,710
Ghost!

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,520
Sir

35
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,400
Something's wrong, sir!

36
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,400
What happened?

37
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,120
There's a ghost!

38
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,080
A faceless monster!

39
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,030
There's a ghost! A ghost!

40
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:26,960
Nonsense.

41
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,910
How could there be ghosts in broad daylight?

42
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,190
A faceless monster.

43
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,560
It just floated over like this.

44
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,590
Is this the faceless monster you mentioned?

45
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,030
That's strange.

46
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,710
It really didn't have a face just now.

47
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,150
The wounds are the same.

48
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,910
They all died from excessive blood loss.

49
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:52,120
This corpse is a bit different from the others.

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,710
The other corpses were completely drained of blood.

51
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,960
But this one

52
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,080
still has a lot of blood left.

53
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,960
We left the tavern

54
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,840
less than half an hour ago.

55
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,310
By this calculation,

56
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,630
a new killer has appeared.

57
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,080
This victim was seriously injured.

58
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,960
But was still able to use qinggong.

59
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,680
Their martial arts must be extraordinary.

60
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,360
So young, yet with such qinggong skills.

61
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,160
There are still such people in the martial world.

62
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,000
Master Daoxing's qinggong is truly impressive.

63
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,160
I heard she has a daughter

64
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,070
who has been gifted since childhood.

65
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,750
She inherited her skills.

66
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,310
They've exposed themselves.

67
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:53,750
Sir

68
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:02,630
The air is dry, be careful with fire.

69
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:09,190
The air is dry, be careful with fire.

70
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,240
Brother Jianxing,

71
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,750
It's curfew time now.

72
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,000
If you get caught, it'll be hard to explain.

73
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,040
Lord Hu,

74
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,680
The Pure Yang Sword behind me

75
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,070
belongs to my close friends, the Dao Xingni couple.

76
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,040
It's their unique treasured sword.

77
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,630
It seems they've already passed the sword

78
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,630
on to their daughter.

79
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,600
Tonight, I'm going to return the sword.

80
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,830
Return the sword?

81
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,190
Then why not go during the day?

82
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,270
The place they stay is the Ghost Market.

83
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,830
You can't enter during the day.

84
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,040
The Ghost Market?

85
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:51,950
What is the Ghost Market like?

86
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,480
How about we go together?

87
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,070
How come I've never heard of this Ghost Market before?

88
00:06:59,190 --> 00:06:59,800
Have you been there?

89
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,870
Why so many questions? Go if you want.

90
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,750
W-What's going on?

91
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,680
Brother Jianxing, are you alright?

92
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,950
I'm fine, the arrow didn't hit me.

93
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,390
I really didn't expect

94
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,510
that in a single day

95
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,190
you would save me twice.

96
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,000
I, Hu, owe you my life.

97
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:41,560
Lord Hu,

98
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,560
maybe someday in the future

99
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,920
I'll really ask you to repay me.

100
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,040
Alright.

101
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,600
As long as it doesn't go against morality or principles,

102
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,680
you can name your terms.

103
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,310
Just kidding.

104
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,070
Lord Hu, you don't need to take it so seriously.

105
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:02,830
Alright.

106
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:05,800
This...

107
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,830
Who is trying to assassinate me?

108
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,190
This arrow

109
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,680
is the same as the one that was shot into the Dali Court before.

110
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,430
The design is identical.

111
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,160
This is a feather from a sparrowhawk.

112
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,430
A small bird.

113
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,870
They're usually raised in Xiaoshan, north of the city.

114
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,000
That's the stronghold of the Armory Division.

115
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,310
I guess it's some

116
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:38,310
people who have long despised the corrupt officials of the Dali Court

117
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,480
and want to use this chance to get rid of me.

118
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,870
It seems, sir, that in the court

119
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,600
you're not very good at making friends either.

120
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,630
You have a sharp nose, try smelling it.

121
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,750
I'm not a dog.

122
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,120
Why should I smell it just because you say so?

123
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,390
Brother Jianxing,

124
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,910
you've already saved my life twice.

125
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,910
We're brothers through life and death.

126
00:08:59,030 --> 00:08:59,790
Just smell it.

127
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:00,750
Be good.

128
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,720
If you find a clue by smelling it, we can be better prepared.

129
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,630
Right?

130
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,360
It should be birch wood.

131
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:10,600
Birch wood.

132
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,510
That matches up.

133
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,870
This is the Yangzhou armory.

134
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,120
The batch of arrows stolen five years ago.

135
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,200
The assassin from earlier.

136
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,080
Might be one of the thieves who stole the arrows back then.

137
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,080
You're overthinking it.

138
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,750
Just based on a broken arrow,

139
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:30,910
it doesn't prove anything.

140
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,270
Besides, this arrow has been missing for five years.

141
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,240
Who knows how many times it's changed hands.

142
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,670
That makes sense.

143
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,320
But us going to the black market tonight

144
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,150
was purely by chance.

145
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,320
Setting up an assassination would take at least fifteen minutes.

146
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,240
Which means the other side

147
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,270
has been watching us the whole time.

148
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,030
Sir,

149
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,720
even if you solve this assassination case,

150
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,080
there won't be much of a reward.

151
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,440
But what about the Phoenix case?

152
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,550
If the Phoenix case isn't solved soon,

153
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,480
we'll be in big trouble.

154
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,750
Wait for me!

155
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,870
This is the Ghost Market.

156
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:28,030
It's a gathering place for people with nowhere else to go.

157
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,360
Master Hu.

158
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,670
There's miasma everywhere here.

159
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,600
You could get dizzy at any moment.

160
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,120
Be careful.

161
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,670
No wonder.

162
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:43,390
So this place is easy to defend and hard to attack.

163
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,630
By the way,

164
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,870
how do you know so much about this place?

165
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,630
When it comes to court affairs,

166
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,790
I'm not as knowledgeable as you.

167
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,720
But in the world of the martial arts,

168
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,320
I definitely know more than you.

169
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,480
You're that sure?

170
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,200
Of course.

171
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,480
Without me,

172
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,030
in this Ghost Market,

173
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,150
you'd never find Dao Xing or Ni Shi.

174
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,550
Looks like you underestimate

175
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,360
my ability to deal with people.

176
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,440
Let's make a bet.

177
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,240
Two taels of silver.

178
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,630
That's all you're offering?

179
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:23,360
Yeah.

180
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,630
So stingy.

181
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:25,600
Excuse me, sir.

182
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,910
May I ask where Dao Xing and Ni Shi, the two masters, live?

183
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,030
Where do they live?

184
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,720
Master Hu.

185
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,270
He won't tell you.

186
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,840
Let me tell you,

187
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,120
these are all people who can't show their faces in public.

188
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,960
Some are wanted by the authorities,

189
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,720
some have enemies,

190
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,910
and some have nowhere else to go.

191
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,440
But you,

192
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,320
with your unfamiliar face,

193
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,080
what if you're here for revenge?

194
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,120
Wouldn't he be putting others in danger?

195
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,240
It seems

196
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,790
you're already a regular here.

197
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,910
Fox Emperor.
