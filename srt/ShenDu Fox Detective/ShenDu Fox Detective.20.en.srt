1
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:07,920
All the case files from the Xu household's past incidents

2
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:09,390
Are they all here?

3
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,430
Yes, sir.

4
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,640
Today, in my capacity as a member of the Court of Judicial Review,

5
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:13,560
I went to the local authorities

6
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,920
and transferred all the cases here.

7
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,950
Among these past cases,

8
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,840
some involved drowning suicides,

9
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,790
this one was burned to death,

10
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:23,790
and some were killed by sharp weapons.

11
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,430
There was one who died tragically in the garden.

12
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,560
The causes of death are all different.

13
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,280
Could they really just be suicides?

14
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,760
What makes you think so?

15
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,950
If they were really killed by someone,

16
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,640
the killer probably wouldn't keep changing their methods.

17
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,560
That's not necessarily true.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,120
There have been cases before

19
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:46,480
of serial killers who kept changing their methods.

20
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:48,920
In these cases,

21
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,040
although the victims died in different ways,

22
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,480
they were all

23
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,950
daughters from poor families,

24
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,430
Xu Qiyan's brides,

25
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,350
and all young and beautiful.

26
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,280
Moreover,

27
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,870
from the portraits,

28
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,000
these women

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,840
all bear some resemblance to her.

30
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,920
Isn't that normal?

31
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,680
Xu Qiyan likes Yun Yin,

32
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,950
so he kept looking for substitutes afterward.

33
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,840
And the killer has a vendetta against the Xu family to wipe out their descendants.

34
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,120
So he marries one and kills one.

35
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,710
By the way, sir,

36
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,960
when I went to the yamen to collect the relevant files today,

37
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,120
I was stopped by a scholar.

38
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,710
He said he had something important to give us.

39
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,840
I've already arranged with him

40
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,120
to meet at the letter stall this afternoon.

41
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,360
It's almost time now.

42
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,910
We should set out quickly.

43
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,750
Prepare the horses.

44
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:46,120
Take care, miss.

45
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,960
Thank you, sir.

46
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,800
This is Lord Hu, the chief of the Court of Judicial Review.

47
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,840
Greetings, gentlemen.

48
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,710
Regarding the Xu family case,

49
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,630
I have a few doubts I'd like to report to you.

50
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,470
What doubts?

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,190
It's widely said in Lingzhou that the Xu family treated the first wife very well.

52
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,080
But the rumors among the people

53
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,280
don't seem to be accurate.

54
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,630
What do you mean by that?

55
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,560
A few years ago,

56
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,560
when Lady Yun Yin was still alive,

57
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,520
she once asked me to help write a letter for her.

58
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,680
What was the letter about?

59
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,560
I don't remember the details.

60
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,400
I only know it was addressed to a younger relative.

61
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,960
The letter was just full of caring words,

62
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,030
and messages to let them know she was well.

63
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,560
There was nothing improper in it.

64
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,630
Nothing improper?

65
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,840
Why are you stopping me?

66
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,910
His suspicion might be right.

67
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,630
In Yun Yin's letters,

68
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,840
the content was clearly ordinary.

69
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,150
She could have easily asked her own husband to write them.

70
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,400
But she didn't.

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,240
Instead, she went out to the street

72
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,960
and found a letter writer to do it.

73
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:55,030
This proves that the relationship between Yun Yin and Xu Qiyan

74
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,360
is not as good as the rumors say.

75
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,750
As expected of an official,

76
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,310
you hit the nail on the head. That's exactly right.

77
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,680
But what does this have to do with you?

78
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,590
Do you have a grudge against the Xu family,

79
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:06,710
or

80
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,800
are you just looking for a reward for reporting this?

81
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,120
Don't drink so much in the future,

82
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:14,280
and always go practice martial arts near the Xu residence.

83
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,800
That used to be General Li Zuo's mansion.

84
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,800
That whole family died terribly.

85
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:22,710
Did you know that?

86
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:26,160
Now, even the exorcist who tried to drive out ghosts died in that house.

87
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,070
The Xu family is strange too.

88
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,390
They even dared to buy a haunted house.

89
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,000
Such bad luck.

90
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,390
Let's not talk about this.

91
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,920
Let's go have some fun.

92
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,120
Sure, sure.

93
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,070
Let's go, let's go.

94
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,360
Come on, let's go.

95
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,120
That massacre that happened back then

96
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,160
is still vivid in my mind.

97
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,360
All the neighbors know about it.

98
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,190
It was really terrifying.

99
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,390
Yes, yes.

100
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:51,870
Exciting.

101
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,510
Let's go.

102
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,600
You're treating this time, right?

103
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,680
No problem.

104
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,720
Too many things have happened in that mansion.

105
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,430
It's made everyone anxious.

106
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,360
We all hope for an explanation soon.

107
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,070
Is it bad feng shui,

108
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,190
or is there some villain behind all this?

109
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,800
Madam Yunyin liked roses.

110
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,430
So Young Master Qiyan built this garden for her.

111
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,750
Madam Yunyin liked to sing opera.

112
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,000
So Young Master Qiyan built this stage for her.

113
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,070
And this Miaoyin Studio as well.

114
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,600
It was also named Miaoyin Studio because of her.

115
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,070
Then, Qiao'er,

116
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,120
how did Yunyin die?

117
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,390
When I came to the manor,

118
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,310
she had already passed away for quite some time.

119
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,360
Although people outside all say

120
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,190
she was harmed by a vengeful spirit,

121
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,950
the old servants in the manor all say

122
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,270
it seems she died of illness.

123
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,870
Do you know what illness it was?

124
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,830
It seems it was a lung disease.

125
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,000
A lung disease?

126
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,190
Then how long after Yunyin passed away

127
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,040
did Xu Qiyan start marrying again?

128
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:18,240
It was about three or four years later.

129
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,240
Three or four years.

130
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,430
That doesn't seem too heartless.

131
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,070
It's said that when Madam Yunyin had just passed away,

132
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,270
he was heartbroken.

133
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,270
He spent his days obsessed with making paper figurines.

134
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,510
Then one day, for some reason,

135
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,510
he burned all the paper figurines.

136
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,480
He only kept one.

137
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,190
The one that most resembled Madam Yunyin.

138
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,920
He left it here in Miaoyin Studio.

139
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,000
He would gaze at the paper figurine every day.

140
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,950
Madam Liu's funeral was set for tomorrow.

141
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,720
Young Master, you may not know this,

142
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,070
but the Old Madam has given orders.

143
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,920
Madam Liu's funeral will be kept simple.

144
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,430
She will be buried tonight.

145
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:04,720
At night, we yield the road; the dead take precedence.

146
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,720
The spirits are passing; the living should step aside.

147
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,830
At night, we yield the road; the dead take precedence.

148
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,600
The spirits are passing; the living should step aside.

149
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,950
What are you doing?

150
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,310
If the coffin breaks, can you afford to pay for it?

151
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,160
How would I know?

152
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,310
It's so dark.

153
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,240
It's fine, just close it.

154
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:32,830
What's wrong?

155
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:33,920
A ghost.

156
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,040
A ghost.

157
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:35,870
It's a ghost!

158
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:46,750
Sir

159
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,040
Have you found the body?

160
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,950
We can't find it, and we can't look for it either.

161
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:55,510
All the constables in Lingzhou are overwhelmed right now.

162
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,510
They're too busy.

163
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,600
Wait, why is that?

164
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,870
Why are you shouting?

165
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,920
There was just a bandit uprising in the outskirts of Lingzhou.

166
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,480
The authorities are all out hunting down the remaining bandits.

167
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,360
But they can't just leave our case

168
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,070
hanging like this.

169
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:07,800
Exactly.

170
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,390
To them,

171
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,120
this is just

172
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,000
a minor case of a missing bride's body.

173
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,680
Even if they solve it, there's no reward.

174
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,360
But over there, they're after wanted criminals.

175
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,800
There's a big reward if they catch them.

176
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,830
Those money-grubbing fools.

177
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,240
It's outrageous.

178
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,870
What about the coffin?

179
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,560
Did you check it?

180
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,630
We went to look at the coffin.

181
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,600
There was no body inside.

182
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,830
And there were no signs the nails had been pried open.

183
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,630
This means

184
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,920
the switch must have happened before the coffin was sealed.

185
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,600
It was swapped out earlier.

186
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,240
So

187
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,630
Madam Liu's body

188
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,390
should still be in the Xu residence.

189
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,320
Alright then.

190
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
Let's split up.

191
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:05,840
We'll search separately.

192
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,240
Meet in my room tonight.

193
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,600
Wait.

194
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:09,440
What is it?

195
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:16,000
Hu Li and Hu Tu, you two work together.

196
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,510
Young Master Xu

197
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:39,870
On a rainy day like this

198
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,600
why aren't you resting indoors

199
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,200
and instead came out here to water the flowers?

200
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,910
These flowers thrive on water

201
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:54,600
the more water they get, the better they grow

202
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,840
Yun Yin just told me this
