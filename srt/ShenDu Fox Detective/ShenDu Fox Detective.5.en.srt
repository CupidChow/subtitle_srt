1
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:07,600
Regarding the Phoenix murder case

2
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,470
The coroner's autopsy results

3
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,640
reminded me of an old case

4
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,120
What case?

5
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:16,680
Twelve years ago

6
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:21,310
the Li Zuo family massacre

7
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,120
Twelve years ago

8
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,430
Grand General Li Zuo was accused of treason

9
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,120
and was awaiting the imperial verdict

10
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,510
when assassins suddenly broke into his home

11
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,200
and his entire family was slaughtered

12
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,640
After this incident

13
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,150
the Emperor ordered

14
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,870
a thorough investigation to find the murderer

15
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:43,870
However

16
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,150
the real culprit has still not been caught

17
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,560
The way the victims died in that case

18
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:57,680
is almost identical to this case

19
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,840
If we can solve this case

20
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,680
perhaps we can deduce

21
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,310
what really happened

22
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,680
in the old case twelve years ago

23
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,510
Eagle Hook

24
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,070
The weapon the killer used back then

25
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,760
was a specially made weapon

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,040
shaped like an eagle's beak

27
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,680
that pierced straight into the carotid artery

28
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,430
Brother Jianxing

29
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,000
How do you know all this so well?

30
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,150
I've traveled the martial world

31
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,430
and heard a few things

32
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,800
But for over ten years

33
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,030
the case has remained unsolved

34
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,120
Sir

35
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,030
don't you feel ashamed?

36
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,870
Rumors can be frightening

37
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,280
Aren't you worried people will say

38
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,910
it's not that you can't solve it

39
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,240
but that you don't want to?

40
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,840
Brother Jianxing

41
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,710
Since we've come to this point

42
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:53,520
let's be completely honest

43
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,360
Brother Jianxing

44
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,840
are you willing to lend me a hand

45
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,360
to investigate this Phoenix case?

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,560
Okay.

47
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,870
But I need something.

48
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,800
No problem, no problem.

49
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,400
What do you need?

50
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,800
I need

51
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,520
a pig.

52
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,190
See, I told you.

53
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,000
The wound will clot early.

54
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,000
Only this much blood can flow.

55
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,630
A person weighing over a hundred jin

56
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,560
has about how much blood?

57
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,360
About eight or nine jin.

58
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,190
It won't bleed anymore.

59
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,630
About a quarter of an hour.

60
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,310
The killer took the victim away.

61
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,630
Transported them to the crime scene.

62
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:22,360
Spent a quarter of an hour killing and draining the blood.

63
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,280
Then brought the body back to the restaurant.

64
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,870
The whole process took half an hour.

65
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,750
So the killer either walked

66
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,510
or took a carriage.

67
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,920
At this speed,

68
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:40,270
the crime scene is

69
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,720
probably no more than five li from Fulai Restaurant.

70
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,120
Zeng Sheng.

71
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,360
Take a team with you.

72
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,870
Search carefully.

73
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:52,390
Check all suspicious places within five li of Fulai Restaurant.

74
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,630
The crime scene must be well hidden.

75
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,680
There will also be a strong smell of blood.

76
00:04:59,430 --> 00:04:59,920
Yes.

77
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,360
Sir, something's wrong!

78
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,720
Master Hu, Zeng Tou!

79
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:04,800
Something's wrong!

80
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,240
The Phoenix has killed again!

81
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,510
Someone has died again!

82
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,800
How did someone die again?

83
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,040
The scent of camphorwood

84
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,680
Just now, at two other locations in Luoyang

85
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,190
two more bodies were found

86
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,950
The victims are all young women

87
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,720
So far, no connection has been found between them

88
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,750
I'm afraid there will be more victims

89
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:40,190
We need to take the initiative

90
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,070
But the body dumping has no pattern

91
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,720
We can't predict where the bodies will be dumped

92
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:46,630
How do we catch them?

93
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,430
Catch the Phoenix

94
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,270
Map

95
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,680
Every time the Phoenix appears

96
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,560
it flies for a quarter of an hour before disappearing

97
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,870
The dumping site won't be too far away

98
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:08,600
So, based on the two farthest crime scenes

99
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,560
we can determine the killer's area of activity

100
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,390
Search within this circle

101
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,000
Spread our people out

102
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,360
Form a network

103
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,240
This way

104
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,430
once the Phoenix appears

105
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,600
someone can rush over immediately

106
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:21,950
Before tonight

107
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,070
we must catch the killer

108
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,390
Understood

109
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,000
Zeng Sheng

110
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,430
What about those two bodies?

111
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,160
They've both been taken back to the Dali Temple

112
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:32,950
What's wrong?

113
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,720
Don't take them to the coroner's room

114
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,510
Take them all to the courtyard

115
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,480
Brother Jianxing

116
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Your way of investigating cases is truly unique and natural.

117
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,510
It really opened our eyes.

118
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,560
Pretending to be mysterious

119
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,630
I don't think so.

120
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,240
Big Brother Jianxing

121
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,040
He clearly looks like someone with real skills.

122
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,630
You, you...

123
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,600
You call him Big Brother Jianxing?

124
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,310
You two have only known each other for a few days.

125
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,270
And you call him big brother?

126
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,040
You call me—no, you’re the one calling him that.

127
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,720
That's not right.

128
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,000
Something's off.

129
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,600
This is just too strange.

130
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,870
What's wrong?

131
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,920
There are camphor wood strips in Mudan's room.

132
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,070
So she has the scent of camphor wood on her.

133
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:58,800
That makes sense.

134
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,310
Miss Song, in order to prevent

135
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,120
the corpses from being bitten by insects and mosquitoes,

136
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:06,480
placed a lot of camphor wood in the mortuary.

137
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,120
So the five corpses brought in on the first day

138
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,510
also had the scent of camphor wood.

139
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,870
That also makes sense.

140
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:37,870
But you noticed

141
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:40,120
the remaining three bodies

142
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,360
were never brought into the coroner's room

143
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,120
however,

144
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,870
they all have the scent of camphor wood on them

145
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:49,270
so unless these three bodies

146
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,720
all had the habit of using camphor wood strips to repel insects while alive

147
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,630
and

148
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,510
and camphor wood

149
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:56,030
the wood and its scent

150
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,630
are actually different

151
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:01,630
but the camphor scent on the victims

152
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,120
is exactly the same

153
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:05,670
I'll be right back

154
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,240
Brother Jianxing

155
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,870
That kid just left without saying a word

156
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,480
Sir, he was disrespectful to you

157
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,510
I'll go after him right away

158
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,750
No rush, no rush

159
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,720
I know where he's going

160
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,200
Shendu

161
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,790
I'm more familiar with it than he is

162
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,870
You should smell it too

163
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,000
I don't think that's necessary

164
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,390
No, it's very necessary

165
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:34,960
Yes, yes

166
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,150
I also think this scent

167
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,510
is it really the same

168
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,240
or is there a difference

169
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,840
Start smelling from the feet

170
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,600
Let me try

171
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,360
The camphor scent is the same

172
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,670
This means

173
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:54,720
these women

174
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,870
all stayed somewhere with a camphor scent

175
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,510
and it was a large amount of camphor wood

176
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,910
A small amount of camphor strips couldn't do this

177
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,790
The scent of camphor wood

178
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:11,630
Make way

179
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,750
That's it
