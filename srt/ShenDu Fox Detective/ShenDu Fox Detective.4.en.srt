1
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,150
If you can think that way,

2
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,560
then you’re definitely not a bad person.

3
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,520
So it was Lord Hu who helped you clear your name.

4
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,920
Lord Hu sentenced me to execution after the autumn.

5
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:16,000
What?

6
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,710
Two months later, His Majesty granted amnesty to all.

7
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,840
So I was released.

8
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,640
Then you should thank His Majesty.

9
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,310
Do you think

10
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,120
why did Lord Hu sentence me to execution after the autumn

11
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,710
instead of immediate execution?

12
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,230
They were all poisoned by something very strange.

13
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,040
I'd like to hear more details.

14
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,560
The victims died from excessive blood loss.

15
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:42,840
But look,

16
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,760
the wounds are only about the size of a bird peck.

17
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,760
Wounds of this size

18
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,480
aren't enough to cause so much bleeding.

19
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,230
The blood would clot early.

20
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,560
But the blood on these bodies

21
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,710
has all been drained.

22
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,040
And I asked the officers at the scene,

23
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,230
they said there wasn't that much blood at the scene either.

24
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,150
So you think

25
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,040
it was poison that caused so much bleeding?

26
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,000
It's not what I think,

27
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,430
it's what I found from my examination.

28
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,430
This poison is colorless and tasteless.

29
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,040
Plus, the wounds were cleaned.

30
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,230
So it's very hard to detect.

31
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,310
No wonder I couldn't smell anything.

32
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,230
So do you know what kind of poison it is?

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,520
However,

34
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,360
look,

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,150
all the victims have these marks on their bodies.

36
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,360
These marks indicate

37
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,030
the victims were hung upside down before they died.

38
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,400
It's as if they were drained of blood.

39
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,910
It's too cruel.

40
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,120
It's too vicious.

41
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,560
This definitely wasn't done by a phoenix.

42
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,560
When His Majesty ascended the throne,

43
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,470
the people saw a golden phoenix fly out from the Hall of Light.

44
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,960
They believed it was a heavenly omen.

45
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:54,150
But now, with the appearance of the blood phoenix,

46
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,870
the auspicious sign has turned into a bad omen.

47
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,750
In my opinion,

48
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,030
we must thoroughly investigate those behind the blood phoenix incident.

49
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,000
They should be completely eradicated.

50
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:07,560
Additionally,

51
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,960
we should invite street performers

52
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,750
to stage a play where the golden phoenix pecks the blood phoenix.

53
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,280
This will inform the people across the land

54
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,870
that the blood phoenix has been subdued by the auspicious sign.

55
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,150
Sun Chengjing, how dare you!

56
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,190
Your Majesty, please calm your anger.

57
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,630
I deserve to die.

58
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,910
You certainly do.

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,190
Street tricks

60
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,750
cannot be compared to the true omens of this dynasty.

61
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,430
Your Majesty, peace to you.

62
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,960
Lord Hu has arrived.

63
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,800
You may rise.

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,190
Thank you, Your Majesty.

65
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:51,190
I heard that when the phoenix killed yesterday,

66
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:54,960
Lord Hu happened to be at the scene.

67
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:57,960
What a coincidence.

68
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:01,710
Your Majesty,

69
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,710
it was indeed a coincidence.

70
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,000
Then, Lord Hu, what is your view?

71
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,310
In my opinion,

72
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,750
this case

73
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,710
was definitely not caused by a phoenix.

74
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,400
It was man-made.

75
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,400
Since you are so certain,

76
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:23,030
the case will be handed over to the Court of Judicial Review.

77
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,040
Since Your Majesty wants a swift investigation,

78
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,270
could we set a time limit?

79
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,310
After all, rumors can be dangerous.

80
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,430
That would be very good.

81
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,800
I will solve this case within ten days.

82
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,070
Within ten days?

83
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,270
I'm afraid in just a day or two,

84
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,310
these rumors will have already spread beyond the capital.

85
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,430
As the head of the Court of Judicial Review,

86
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,190
I hope Lord Hu can

87
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,480
share the burden for the country

88
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,390
and uncover the truth as soon as possible,

89
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,270
to reassure the people.

90
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:05,950
Hu Zhengyi.

91
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,560
I am here.

92
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,040
I order you to solve the case within three days.

93
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,160
The Censorate will assist.

94
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,270
I will strictly follow Your Majesty's command.

95
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,000
Peony.

96
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,920
I killed her before violating her.

97
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,360
What accomplice?

98
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,920
That's all just your wild guess.

99
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,310
Fine.

100
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,800
I am the top detective in Luoyang.

101
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,630
There's never been a case I couldn't solve.

102
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,120
So,

103
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,720
I've prepared a special feast for you scum.

104
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,600
I've designed a grand meal.

105
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,360
It's called

106
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,000
"Eradicate Evil at the Root."

107
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,070
This cut was clean and decisive.

108
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,750
Even if you end up in the underworld as a ghost,

109
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,680
you'll never be a lecherous ghost.

110
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,480
Not only that,

111
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,920
I'll take your manhood

112
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,680
and shove it in your mouth,

113
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,680
so you won't even be able to speak properly when you meet the King of Hell.

114
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,360
Try it.

115
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,600
I'll talk! I'll talk! I'll talk!

116
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,950
I'll tell you, sir!

117
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,000
The one behind this, the one who ordered me is—

118
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,070
You!

119
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,120
Someone, help!

120
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,000
Save me!

121
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,560
Sir! Sir!

122
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,120
Save me, untie me!

123
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,190
Someone poisoned the water.

124
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,750
But it's so strange,

125
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,040
I've never seen a poison like this before.

126
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,360
This kind of poison

127
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,390
I have never seen it before either.

128
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,870
After that waiter died,

129
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,680
we detained the prison guard who gave him water.

130
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,750
At the same time,

131
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,600
we also investigated

132
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,430
Old Li, who has always delivered water to the Court of Justice.

133
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,310
Old Li is dead, right?

134
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:24,870
Yes.

135
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,950
It was my negligence.

136
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,920
Have you checked the waiter's relationships?

137
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,480
Three years ago, there was a famine in the waiter's hometown.

138
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,430
He fled to the capital.

139
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,430
He was taken in by the shop owner.

140
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,480
But he had a bad habit.

141
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,310
He loved to gamble.

142
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,270
According to the gambling house owner,

143
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,750
he used to bet small amounts.

144
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,160
But recently, he started betting generously.

145
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,830
Betting big, opening big.

146
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:43,950
Big.

147
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,630
It seems he was a hired accomplice.

148
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,680
Find out where his money came from.

149
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:49,600
Yes.

150
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,560
Are you getting used to living at the Dali Court?

151
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,430
To be honest,

152
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,870
it's not as comfortable as the Fulai Restaurant.

153
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:14,390
Although we don't have lavish decorations here,

154
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,510
but

155
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,240
you can stay as long as you like.

156
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:20,830
And it's free.

157
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,310
You asked me to stay,

158
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,510
is there something you want to say to me?

159
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,680
Brother Jianxing,

160
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,830
yesterday was our first meeting,

161
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,600
but I felt you looked familiar.

162
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,510
Have we

163
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,390
met somewhere before?

164
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,630
I'm just a wanderer in the martial world.

165
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:43,960
We probably haven't met.

166
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,510
You're so young yet so skilled in martial arts.

167
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,440
Did you learn from your elders

168
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,320
or did you have a master?

169
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,790
My family is humble,

170
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,200
my parents passed away early,

171
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,390
and I never had a master.

172
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,510
My skills

173
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,910
were learned on the road.

174
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,360
Brother Jianxing,

175
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,360
you only tell half the truth.

176
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,960
You have many secrets.

177
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,550
When living in the martial world,

178
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,750
there are always things one doesn't want to talk about.

179
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,150
For example,

180
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,750
the real reason you came to the Dali Court.

181
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,000
You must be joking, sir.

182
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,030
Weren't you the one who invited me here?

183
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:37,750
Yes, yes.

184
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,270
I forgot.

185
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,630
I forgot, I forgot, I forgot.

186
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,630
To be honest,

187
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,630
the Phoenix murder case

188
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,320
and the coroner's autopsy results

189
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,960
reminded me of an old case.

190
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,200
What case?

191
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,200
Twelve years ago,

192
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,870
the Li Zuo family massacre.
