1
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,840
The Blood God Sect has been destroyed.

2
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:09,280
The sect leader, as the main culprit, has also been sentenced to immediate execution.

3
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:10,640
Why can't we close the case?

4
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,350
How could that be considered hasty?

5
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,920
But you know in your heart,

6
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,040
there's still a mastermind behind this.

7
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,920
It's precisely because there's a mastermind behind this

8
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,350
that we announced the case was closed to the public.

9
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:27,150
To make them lower their guard.

10
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,710
Only then will they slip up.

11
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,280
Right now, they're constantly on guard against us.

12
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,430
We can't find out anything.

13
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,000
What does the Sage think?

14
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,790
This is her intention.

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,040
It's exactly what she wants.

16
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,840
Don't you find it strange?

17
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,430
A person from the martial world,

18
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,310
practicing evil arts and recruiting followers,

19
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,480
insists on causing trouble in the capital.

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,400
Drawing the court's attention.

21
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,070
Unless he actually wants to

22
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:07,480
start a huge bloodbath in the capital.

23
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,280
That scapegoat for the Underworld Emperor

24
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,400
is nothing compared to him.

25
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,950
He's not even in the same league.

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,870
Are you suspecting Sun Chengjing?

27
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,310
I'm certain

28
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,030
he's definitely involved.

29
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,800
I just don't know

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
if, in his official position,

31
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,750
he has someone above him.

32
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,080
We can wait for them to make another move.

33
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,630
By the way,

34
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,800
the case file for Li Zuo that you asked me to retrieve,

35
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,710
I've brought it for you.

36
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,240
Here.

37
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:38,800
Hu Zhengyi

38
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,150
Who are you trying to fool?

39
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,240
This is clearly just a stack of blank paper.

40
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,840
Brother Jianxing, don't be hasty.

41
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,030
Brother Jianxing, please don't be hasty.

42
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,030
Here's what happened.

43
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,800
Twelve years ago,

44
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,240
after General Li's entire family was killed,

45
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,750
the Sage gave an order

46
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,190
to destroy all documents related to the Li Zuo case.

47
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,280
So,

48
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,120
whether it was the officials' impeachment letters against General Li

49
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,960
or the investigation records of the Li family's massacre,

50
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,840
they were all replaced with blank paper.

51
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,960
You were at the Dali Court long ago.

52
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:12,960
You clearly knew.

53
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,310
Why didn't you say so earlier?

54
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,590
The person who tried to assassinate me a few days ago

55
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,240
was an assassin from the Luo Net organization.

56
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,240
Her name is Shen Xuan.

57
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,630
She roamed the martial world alongside the Fox Emperor.

58
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,120
When I mentioned the theft from the armory,

59
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,040
you clearly knew it was Luo Net's doing.

60
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,480
You also knew

61
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,750
that the one trying to assassinate me was Shen Xuan.

62
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,120
Why didn't you say so earlier?

63
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,430
The Sage still wants to see me, so I won't say more.

64
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,800
Don't worry.

65
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,510
You've saved me twice.

66
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,390
Let's call our debts even for now.

67
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,390
As for the Li Zuo case,

68
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,920
I'll keep helping you investigate.

69
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:24,800
By the way,

70
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,430
some procedures

71
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,560
still have to be followed according to the law.

72
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,950
I hope you'll understand, Brother Jianxing.

73
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,240
Who is this?

74
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,430
Hu Zhengyi, that old fox.

75
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,870
You never should have protected him so much in the first place.

76
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,430
I should have killed him with a single arrow.

77
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,630
I've asked around.

78
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,720
The Court of Justice hasn't actually started sending people to pursue him.

79
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,680
Maybe it's really as he said.

80
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,160
Just going through the motions.

81
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,750
You call this going through the motions?

82
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,870
Now the wanted notices are posted all over the city.

83
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,680
From now on, I'll have to sneak around whenever I go out.

84
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,560
Always on edge.

85
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,430
Don't worry.

86
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,950
As long as I'm in Luoyang,

87
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,630
even if you get caught,

88
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,720
I'll still find a way to protect you.

89
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,270
The Western Regions.

90
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,560
Why are we suddenly going to the Western Regions?

91
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,680
Just now, His Majesty summoned Lord Hu.

92
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,800
Regarding the opening of trade with the Western Regions,

93
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,120
he has put the Court of Justice fully in charge.

94
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,720
We're to go to the Western Regions for secret talks.

95
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,870
To establish trade relations with foreign envoys.

96
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,040
Lord Hu asked me to inform you.

97
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,560
You have to go as well.

98
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,390
It seems this journey west

99
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,630
won't be so simple.

100
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,240
If I'm not mistaken,

101
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,630
this was arranged by Sun Chengjing, right?

102
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,560
That's right.

103
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:56,120
Sending us to the unfamiliar Western Regions

104
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,600
not only keeps us

105
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,950
away from the unsolved Blood God case

106
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,430
and the Phoenix case,

107
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,120
but also allows for

108
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,360
some "accidents" to happen along the way.

109
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,560
It's really killing two birds with one stone.

110
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,720
So do you think

111
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,560
Lord Hu wouldn't have thought of this?

112
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,000
In a month,

113
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,430
there will be a Sky Lantern Festival in Liangzhou.

114
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,750
Although it was proposed by the governor of Liangzhou,

115
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,630
it concerns the relations between our dynasty and

116
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,000
the various countries of the Western Regions.

117
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,040
The Emperor has entrusted this important task to the Court of Judicial Review.

118
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,950
How could we possibly refuse?

119
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,190
That's true.

120
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:29,720
Alright.

121
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:30,800
Pack up your things.

122
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,720
We set out tomorrow.

123
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,070
He's trying to lure the snake out of its hole.

124
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,160
Who are you ordering around?

125
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,870
Such disrespect.

126
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,750
Start cutting from the top.

127
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,750
Hurry up, all of you!

128
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,000
Everyone in the back, keep up.

129
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,160
Put that box over there.

130
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,160
Old Lady Liu, do you know what time it is?

131
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,120
Why aren't you out yet?

132
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,360
Sir, come and see!

133
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,270
It's so lively!

134
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,360
Look, everyone!

135
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,270
Which family is having a wedding?

136
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,310
Sir, encountering a happy event when going out is a good sign.

137
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,680
This is a very good omen.

138
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,830
It's clearly a joyful occasion.

139
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,240
But why did their family hang this up?

140
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,310
It's bad luck.

141
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,920
What kind of strange custom is this in Lingzhou?

142
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,720
On such a wonderful day,

143
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,190
why must there be so much crying? I don't want this.

144
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,680
Look at the bridal sedan, look at the betrothal gifts.

145
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,190
Mother.

146
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:33,950
Hurry, let's go.

147
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,870
Let go of me!

148
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,070
You old hag! Mother!

149
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,000
Cui'er is getting married.

150
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,360
Are you mourning in the courtyard?

151
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,440
You're pushing your daughter into a pit of fire! Hurry, let's go!

152
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:41,910
Mother!

153
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:42,750
Go!

154
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,790
That general's mansion is a place haunted by vengeful spirits.

155
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,440
The fortune-teller said,

156
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,510
our Cui'er's birth chart is of the wood element.

157
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,510
She is pure yang in the five elements.

158
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,000
She can ward off demons and monsters. Mother, he's lying!

159
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:53,910
He's lying!

160
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,200
You greedy old man!

161
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,120
I don't believe you at all.

162
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,270
That's right, I won't marry!

163
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,320
Madam Liu,

164
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,240
you've already accepted the Xu family's betrothal gifts.

165
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,550
I must take her away today.

166
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,510
Mother, let's go! Cui'er!

167
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,120
Mother!

168
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,750
Go! Stop!

169
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,870
Mother! Cui'er!

170
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,000
Enough.

171
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,320
Ma'am, may I ask you something?

172
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,510
The General's Mansion in Lingzhou City—

173
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,600
Isn't that the former residence of the late General Li Zuo?

174
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,720
Yes, that's his house.

175
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,960
Now the Xu family lives there.

176
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,670
Since there are rumors of hauntings,

177
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,600
why doesn't the Xu family move out?

178
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,750
Back then, Master Xu was ambushed by bandits while transporting goods.

179
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,600
General Li saved him.

180
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,360
After General Li died,

181
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,910
he bought the mansion.

182
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,000
It's like he's guarding the place for the general.

183
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,750
Such a loyal and righteous family,

184
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,720
if General Li's spirit is watching from above,

185
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,720
he wouldn't harm them.

186
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,510
Lift the sedan chair.

187
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,120
Sir.

188
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,910
This clearly doesn't add up.

189
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,600
I'll go ask.

190
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,150
My Cui'er...

191
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:51,510
Old woman...

192
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,600
Ma'am...

193
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,320
You don't want to marry off your daughter

194
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,240
because in that mansion

195
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,910
there are evil spirits?

196
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:03,000
Back then, the General's Mansion was drenched in blood.

197
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,550
Those wronged souls

198
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,600
are very fierce.

199
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,910
The whole city of Lingzhou knows about it.

200
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,510
What sin have I committed?

201
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,360
Ma'am,

202
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,030
have those spirits ever harmed anyone?

203
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,670
They haven't harmed anyone.

204
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,510
Then can they really be called evil spirits?

205
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,150
How many wives has the Xu family married?

206
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:41,360
Didn't every one of them die under strange circumstances?

207
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,240
Alright, let's go, let's go.

208
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,600
Go back, go back.

209
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,320
My Cui'er, go back.

210
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,630
Jianxing

211
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,320
What do you think?

212
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,120
The whole Li family is loyal and heroic.

213
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,510
Even if they are in the afterlife,

214
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,480
I believe they would never become vengeful spirits.

215
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,840
Well said.

216
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,630
This time, what you said does make sense.

217
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,120
Everyone,

218
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,600
since we've come across this injustice,

219
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,150
as members of the Dali Court,

220
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,750
we can't just stand by and do nothing.

221
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,120
First, for the common people,

222
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:16,320
second, to uphold General Li's good name.

223
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,360
But we have official duties.

224
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,510
We still have to travel.

225
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,840
There's still more than a month left.

226
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,790
From Lingzhou to Liangzhou.

227
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,320
There's enough time.

228
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,670
If it's not enough,

229
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,000
we'll just hurry along the way.

230
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,200
Yes, sir.

231
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,240
This is clearly the forceful abduction of a common girl.

232
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,670
That's right, sir.

233
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,240
That girl is so pitiful.

234
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,120
You must help her.

235
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,000
Alright.

236
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,600
Since no one has any objections,

237
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:50,960
let's use the excuse of offering congratulations

238
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,000
to visit his residence and investigate.
