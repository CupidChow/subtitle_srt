1
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:17,350
Hu Zhengyi

2
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,310
Hu Zhengyi

3
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:36,590
Are you alright?

4
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,790
Long story short.

5
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,950
Why did you block the arrow for him just now?

6
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,150
That was such a good opportunity.

7
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,230
I could have killed him right now.

8
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,400
It's not the right time yet.

9
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,120
Hu Zhengyi is going to help me investigate the old Li family case from back then.

10
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,150
I want to see

11
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,280
what he can actually find out.

12
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,040
He was the one who did it in the first place.

13
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,150
What's left to investigate?

14
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,200
You came all the way to Shendu

15
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,350
just for revenge, didn't you?

16
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,120
That's right.

17
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,590
I remember this face very clearly.

18
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:03,870
But back then

19
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,120
I didn't know who he was.

20
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,790
It took us a lot of effort to find this clue.

21
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:09,310
Back at the restaurant

22
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,840
I recognized him at first glance.

23
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,280
What I want isn't his life.

24
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,150
It's the truth behind all this.

25
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,470
Why did he do that back then?

26
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,400
Who was the mastermind behind it?

27
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,310
Did my father really betray the country?

28
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,910
All of this needs to be investigated.

29
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,360
I understand.

30
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,030
But that scoundrel is extremely cunning.

31
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,520
You're like a lamb in a tiger's den right now.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,150
You must be careful in everything.

33
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,240
Don't worry.

34
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,430
I'll be careful.

35
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,430
But you,

36
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,240
don't act rashly again.

37
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,680
Got it, I'll listen to you.

38
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,630
Guishusheng greets the Fox Emperor.

39
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,590
When I just sparred with Hu Zhengyi,

40
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,800
does he really not know martial arts,

41
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,680
or is he just pretending?

42
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,080
Hu Zhengyi's joints are stiff,

43
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,240
and his muscles and bones are weak.

44
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,630
He doesn't seem like someone who practices martial arts.

45
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,000
You had Guishusheng come all the way from Yaozhou to test him.

46
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,870
No matter how skilled a martial artist is at hiding,

47
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,000
they can't fool Guishusheng.

48
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,240
If, during the fight just now,

49
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,430
Hu Zhengyi had really shown martial arts skills,

50
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,680
then there would be no need to deal with him any further.

51
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:29,360
His life would have ended here in this ghost market.

52
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:38,800
Lord Hu.

53
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:42,800
Lord Hu.

54
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,310
Lord Hu has gone to court.

55
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,470
Your subject greets Your Majesty.

56
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,080
This...

57
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,150
Th-this...

58
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,190
What on earth is going on here?

59
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,360
It's the miasma of the ghost market.

60
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,430
Lord Hu, you sure talk big.

61
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,470
But you ended up lying here.

62
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,590
Brother Jianxing, are you worried about me?

63
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,680
Thank you, thank you.

64
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,360
I wasn't worried about you.

65
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,360
I'm just afraid if you die here, you'll drag me down with you.

66
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:30,950
Don't worry.

67
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,510
I've got a tough life.

68
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,680
It's just a pity that my life...

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,870
I don't know how much longer it will last.

70
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,190
Stop being so dramatic.

71
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,480
Let's go.

72
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,680
What did I tell you all?

73
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,750
I am the renowned number one detective in Luoyang.

74
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,630
A mere phoenix, and yet—

75
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,070
Sir.

76
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:12,750
Sir, I caught it.

77
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,070
I caught the phoenix.

78
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,630
How is this a phoenix?

79
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,630
This is clearly a chicken.

80
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,270
This is definitely a phoenix.

81
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,240
Xiao Zeng,

82
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:26,190
I think you’ve gone crazy trying to catch a phoenix.

83
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,270
You’re even mistaking roast chicken for a phoenix.

84
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,630
Sir, please look carefully.

85
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,830
No matter how closely I look,

86
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,360
it’s still just a chicken.

87
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:35,830
Let’s have it as an extra dish later.

88
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,310
Sir loves eating chicken the most.

89
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,750
Good chicken.

90
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,720
Such good chicken.

91
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,000
Sir.

92
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,600
It tastes pretty good.

93
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,070
As expected of Luoyang’s top detective.

94
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,750
Your chicken-catching skills are truly first-rate.

95
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,160
That’s because I cooked it well.

96
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,390
Tian Tian,

97
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,190
when you made this chicken,

98
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,430
what tools did you use?

99
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,630
This

100
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,240
Isn't this the knife used to cut up corpses?

101
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,360
You guessed right.

102
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,480
Chicken meat is also a chicken's corpse.

103
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,800
There's no knife better than mine

104
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,190
for cutting up corpses.

105
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,270
Makes sense.

106
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,120
Keep eating.

107
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,240
Eat, eat.

108
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,830
Brother Jianxing

109
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,480
This chicken leg is for you.

110
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,070
If you like it, have some more.

111
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,870
You need to eat well to have the energy to investigate.

112
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,510
Thank you.

113
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
What the Dali Court couldn't find out,

114
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,000
how can you find out?

115
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,120
You need to be full to have the strength to investigate.

116
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,240
Tiantian

117
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,070
If you don't like eating drumsticks,

118
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,240
then have some wings instead.

119
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,190
Brother Zeng saved these especially for you.

120
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,310
Thank you, Brother Zeng.

121
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,430
Brother Jianxing,

122
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,240
these wings are for you.

123
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,040
You've been working hard on the case lately.

124
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,920
Eat more to get your strength back.

125
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,830
What's so hard about what he does?

126
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,000
At least I'm always out and about.

127
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,360
He can't even catch a chicken.

128
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,920
Yeah, that's right.

129
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,630
You're the one who works the hardest.

130
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,630
I'm not that capable.

131
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,600
Compared to the top detective in Luoyang.

132
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,870
So full of energy.

133
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,430
After working all day,

134
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,720
he still has time to spend the whole night at the gambling house.

135
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,000
That's impressive.

136
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:03,630
But Zeng Sheng,

137
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,720
you must have lost quite a bit of silver, right?

138
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,120
That's complete nonsense.

139
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,360
Do you have any proof? Did you see it?

140
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,000
I could smell it.

141
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,720
In your hair

142
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,630
there's a strong scent of basil leaves.

143
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,630
That's from the gambling house owner

144
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:26,390
who burns it to keep guests alert.

145
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,950
He lights it on purpose.

146
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,750
Small, small, small.

147
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,390
I don't believe it, just twelve.

148
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:32,800
Let's try again today.

149
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,870
Everyone, think carefully.

150
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:37,120
The gambling house is crowded and poorly ventilated.

151
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:42,750
There's a strong smell of sweat on these clothes.

152
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
The sweat on these clothes

153
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,080
just means I don't like to bathe.

154
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,960
The basil is just my personal preference.

155
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,720
That does make sense.

156
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,670
Take a look here.

157
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,630
Under the soles of these feet

158
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,440
is lacquer from the gambling house.

159
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,910
Small, small, small.

160
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,080
On the hands

161
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:08,000
are marks from the wall plaster of the Dali Temple.

162
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,510
Isn't this enough to show

163
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,320
that you went to the gambling house at midnight

164
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,030
and climbed over the wall into the Dali Temple at dawn?

165
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,390
Even if what you say is true,

166
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,720
how can you prove I lost money?

167
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,870
That, I just guessed.

168
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,080
Seeing how bad your temper is,

169
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,320
I figured you must always lose when you gamble.

170
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,320
Small, small.

171
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,480
Why is it small again?

172
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,390
Three rounds, all small. Let's go again.

173
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,270
Sir, I...

174
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:44,390
I... my stomach hurts a bit.

175
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,550
I'll go to the restroom first.

176
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,840
You all eat first, go ahead.

177
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,630
Why does this smell seem a bit strange to me?

178
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,320
What do you mean, strange?

179
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:01,720
Look.

180
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,080
This hasn't been digested yet.

181
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,720
Camphor leaves and camphor seeds.

182
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,440
Not digested yet.

183
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,440
It's feces.

184
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,240
This is large-leaf camphor.

185
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,600
Large-leaf camphor.

186
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,240
Blood God Sect.

187
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,910
Phoenix case.

188
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,480
Everything is connected now.

189
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,240
That day, I followed the scent

190
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,480
and tracked it to Zeshan Lane.

191
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,910
Behind Zeshan Lane is Fushan Lane.

192
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,600
The large-leaf camphor warehouse is inside Fushan Lane.

193
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,670
And Daohua Lane is also very close to Fushan Lane.

194
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,000
When the camphor wood arrived at the warehouse,

195
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,200
it still had its leaves.

196
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,870
These leaves would be removed at the warehouse.

197
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,670
Then the wood would be transported to Dafu Xian Temple.

198
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,720
So, the fake phoenix

199
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,670
could only eat camphor leaves

200
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:10,200
from this warehouse in all of Luoyang.

201
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,910
I know this kind of fake phoenix.

202
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:18,630
It's called the Red-feathered Chicken.

203
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,750
It's called a chicken,

204
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,440
but it's actually a bird.

205
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,270
It looks very much like a phoenix.

206
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,200
The previous phoenix omens

207
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,790
probably used the same trick.

208
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,720
But now, it's been involved in a death.

209
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:35,480
So it has become an ominous sign.

210
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,870
To disguise a chicken as a phoenix—

211
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,910
what method did this person use?

212
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:45,360
A few years ago,

213
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,750
there was a strange incident

214
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,910
that caused quite a stir in the capital.

215
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,440
Ladies and gentlemen,

216
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:55,480
now it's time for our troupe's

217
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,510
most spectacular act.

218
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,550
Bravo! Bravo!

219
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,840
The Flaming Parrot!

220
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Flaming Parrot? What's a Flaming Parrot?

221
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,120
What is a Flaming Parrot?

222
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,790
Everyone, open your eyes wide.

223
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,480
Don't blink.

224
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,440
Watch closely.

225
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:22,550
Bravo! Bravo!

226
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,080
That's amazing!

227
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,910
So impressive!

228
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:28,750
Yes, it is.

229
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:33,120
It's flying! It's flying!

230
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,080
This is incredible!

231
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,670
So marvelous! So impressive!

232
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:42,510
So impressive!

233
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,870
Good!
