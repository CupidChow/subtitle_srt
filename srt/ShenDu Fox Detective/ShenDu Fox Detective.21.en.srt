1
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,880
This flower thrives on water.

2
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,110
The more water it gets, the better it grows.

3
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,200
Yun Yin just told me this.

4
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,870
May I ask, Young Master Xu,

5
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,040
those previous madams,

6
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,950
how did they pass away?

7
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,430
It was Yun Yin.

8
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,510
Yun Yin killed them.

9
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,950
But Madam Yun Yin

10
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,310
has been dead for quite a while.

11
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,680
You don't understand.

12
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,230
Yun Yin and I are connected in spirit.

13
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
She's still here.

14
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,510
She just doesn't want you to see her.

15
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,950
That makes sense.

16
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,590
After all, that night

17
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,070
I did see, at the stage,

18
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,590
a shadowy figure.

19
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,150
Right? You saw it too.

20
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,630
Only if you see it with your own eyes

21
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,000
will you know I'm not lying.

22
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,360
Yun Yin can't bear to leave me.

23
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,360
Just as I can't let her go.

24
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,630
What a devoted man you are.

25
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,360
This was the first night I entered the manor,

26
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,030
the opera costume I saw when I got up at night.

27
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:00,910
These

28
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,030
were all found in the small building at Miaoyin Studio.

29
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,080
That's strange.

30
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:11,840
You know,

31
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,470
this doesn't look like a woman's size.

32
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,870
Could it be that Yun Yin is taller than most women?

33
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,310
If the paper figure's size

34
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,190
was made according to Yun Yin,

35
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,840
then her build should be similar to Tiantian's.

36
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,470
But this piece of clothing

37
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,630
actually looks more like something a man would wear.

38
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,400
Could it be Xu Qiyan?

39
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,120
That's possible.

40
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,030
If that's the case,

41
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,240
on my first night in the residence,

42
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,360
the woman I saw performing opera

43
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,560
was actually Xu Qiyan in disguise.

44
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,840
This Young Master Xu

45
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,280
has rather unusual interests.

46
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,240
Sir

47
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,190
Sir

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,280
Sir, what are you doing?

49
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,190
If you have something to say, just say it.

50
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,080
Sir

51
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,710
We've searched everywhere in the residence that we could.

52
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,960
But we still haven't found Lady Liu's body.

53
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,280
Based on my observations over the past few days,

54
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,360
this residence

55
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,190
looks small from the outside,

56
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,800
but feels much larger inside.

57
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,080
I suspect there is a secret room in this residence.

58
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,070
Zeng Sheng, did you find the book?

59
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,190
Sir

60
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,510
Just as you predicted,

61
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,480
we found the book at Luquan Palace, east of Lingzhou.

62
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,560
We found this book.

63
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,630
The Sacred Rebirth Incantation Manual.

64
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,040
I've read this book.

65
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,800
It describes a kind of

66
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:45,270
rebirth and resurrection spell.

67
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,830
The caster must gather five brides with different destinies

68
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:51,870
who have all performed the wedding rites with him.

69
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:55,750
With the aid of the Five Elements' cycle of creation,

70
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,950
he can summon back the person he longs for.

71
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,680
Their soul will return to

72
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:05,360
the body of someone with the same destiny as the deceased.

73
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,070
Let me see it.

74
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,830
Could it be that Xu Qiyan wants to use marriage

75
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,390
to resurrect Yun Yin?

76
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,390
Yesterday, I looked at

77
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,310
all the information on the murdered brides.

78
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,680
They were of the Metal element,

79
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,040
Earth element,

80
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,430
Water element,

81
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,600
Fire element,

82
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,920
and Wood element.

83
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,310
Xiaoyaozi, a Taoist priest from another region,

84
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,040
perhaps didn't know about this.

85
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,720
Maybe he discovered Xu Qiyan's murders,

86
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,920
which is why Xu Qiyan silenced him.

87
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,800
Didn't you say you've never been to Lingzhou?

88
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,310
How do you know about Luquan Palace then?

89
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,240
I heard about it before.

90
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,950
Back then, Sun Chengjing was the Censorate official.

91
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,750
When he inspected Lingzhou,

92
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,390
he ordered the construction of Luquan Palace

93
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,360
for the people to worship.

94
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,480
However, some local officials submitted reports

95
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,600
claiming that evil practices were being spread in Luquan Palace.

96
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,950
Secret followers were plotting something sinister.

97
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,600
But these memorials

98
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,950
were all suppressed by Sun Chengjing.

99
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,680
Some of those officials were dismissed,

100
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,310
others were demoted or transferred.

101
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,720
So, coming here,

102
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,190
I can't help but feel

103
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,160
that what happened today

104
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,600
might be connected to Luquan Palace.

105
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,750
Come and take a look.

106
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,560
This book mentions that the Fire Fate is divided into seven types.

107
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,750
They are Thunder Fire, Furnace Fire,

108
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,630
Lamp Fire, Heavenly Fire,

109
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,160
Mountain Base Fire, Mountain Top Fire,

110
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,270
and this one,

111
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,920
Divine Fire.

112
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,360
Divine Fire.

113
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,160
Divine Blood Fire.

114
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,430
Illuminates the heavens.

115
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,390
May this light bless us and last forever.

116
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,950
Divine Blood Fire, illuminating the heavens.

117
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,270
May we receive this light.

118
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,270
May it last for all eternity.

119
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,510
Yes, that's the phrase.

120
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,270
The servant from Fulai Restaurant

121
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,680
shouted this slogan before setting himself on fire.

122
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,070
Do you all remember?

123
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,000
Back when we were in the prison,

124
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,270
the Blood God cultists also shouted something similar.

125
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,680
Does this mean

126
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,680
that Luquan Palace is also connected to the Blood God cult?

127
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,920
It's so late already.

128
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,390
Why hasn't Tiantian come back yet?

129
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,120
Do you know what fate Tiantian has?

130
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:49,800
Metal Fate.

131
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,800
Yun Yin also has the Metal Fate.

132
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,270
So from Xu Qiyan's perspective,

133
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:58,480
Tiantian would be the vessel for Yun Yin's reincarnation.

134
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,390
So Tiantian is very likely to have been captured by him.

135
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,600
To be used for reincarnation.

136
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,870
If that's the case,

137
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,120
then right now, Tiantian

138
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:17,000
is probably with Madam Liu's corpse,

139
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,680
hidden in the same place.

140
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,870
At this moment, Tiantian must be locked in a secret room.

141
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,390
But the Xu residence is so big,

142
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,950
where should we look for the secret room?

143
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,390
I know.

144
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:30,750
Let's go.

145
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,830
Hurry, get inside.

146
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,800
Mother, I don't want to go in.

147
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,150
Father is in danger.

148
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,480
I want to save Father.

149
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,000
Your father is a great general.

150
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,150
His martial arts are unmatched.

151
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,440
He will definitely drive those bad people away.

152
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:51,550
Trust Mother.

153
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,120
Let's go.

154
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:09,910
Why are there so many paper figures?

155
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,390
And these paper figures

156
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:16,790
look exactly like the ones Yun Yin had in Miaoyin Studio.

157
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,440
The paper figure that fell out of the coffin last time

158
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,600
looked just like this too.

159
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,000
Tiantian.

160
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,390
She still has a pulse.

161
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,720
She must have just been drugged.

162
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,840
Dark magic deceived me; there is no more Yun Yin in this world.

163
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,790
So many passionate people.

164
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,480
Li Jianxing.

165
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,120
This secret room.

166
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,630
Only you and he know about it.

167
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,910
So the culprit must have committed suicide out of guilt.

168
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,670
The resurrection spell didn't work.

169
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,750
He lost his faith.

170
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,440
He committed suicide out of guilt.

171
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,200
Isn't this a bit too convenient?

172
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,200
Solving a case isn't as full of twists and turns as storytelling.

173
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,840
This must be the result of a failed ritual.

174
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,270
His mind was thrown into chaos.
