1
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:08,150
The once-famous illusionist troupe of Luoyang City

2
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,150
mysteriously disappeared.

3
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:15,430
Their most famous performance was

4
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,790
the Flaming Parrot.

5
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,790
An illusionist act.

6
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:20,870
That's right.

7
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:23,790
After they vanished,

8
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,680
it's highly likely they were used by Sun Chengjing.

9
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:31,070
They took part in creating the phoenix omen.

10
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:35,200
And after the omen incident,

11
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,070
they disappeared again.

12
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,000
At the time, I suspected

13
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,200
they were probably silenced.

14
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,680
But now it seems

15
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,070
there are still survivors.

16
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,000
And this survivor

17
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:50,350
is the handyman at Fulai Restaurant.

18
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,280
No wonder.

19
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,070
The restaurant waiter was just an accomplice they recruited.

20
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:57,000
The handyman was responsible for creating the phoenix illusion.

21
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:00,590
Someone else was in charge of killing.

22
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,710
And moving the bodies.

23
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,680
So,

24
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,000
catching one or two people is useless.

25
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,040
We need to catch everyone involved in this incident

26
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,950
in one fell swoop.

27
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,590
Brother Jianxing,

28
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,470
I still need your help.

29
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,870
I suspect

30
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,960
they have an underground secret room.

31
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,560
I need you to find this secret room.

32
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,590
Sir

33
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,000
I remember your favorite food is roast chicken, isn't it?

34
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:45,960
Actually,

35
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,190
if I hadn't caught that bald chicken,

36
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,430
you wouldn't have discovered there was something wrong with this warehouse.

37
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,150
Right?

38
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,590
Even if I didn't achieve much, I still put in the effort.

39
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,680
I promise

40
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,470
I absolutely won't gamble again.

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,910
So, in that case,

42
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,190
that bald chicken deserves a lot of credit.

43
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,630
Are you comparing me to a bald chicken?

44
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,190
Quiet, we're handling official business.

45
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,800
Steward, wake up.

46
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,030
Sir has questions for you.

47
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,680
Sir is dead.

48
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,560
It seems our guess was correct.

49
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,470
We just arrived a bit too late.

50
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,240
What should we do now?

51
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,120
Then we'll have to ask him.

52
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,240
Come out.

53
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,280
Murder! Someone's been killed!

54
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,310
There's been a murder!

55
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,080
Someone's been killed!

56
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:01,960
Don't be nervous.

57
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:03,710
What did you see?

58
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,870
I saw someone

59
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,240
kill the steward.

60
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:21,910
Who was it?

61
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,240
I-I didn't see clearly.

62
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,750
It was in a courtyard.

63
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,240
Are you sure you didn't see anything clearly?

64
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,950
Don't kill me, please don't kill me!

65
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,000
I really didn't see anything clearly!

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,870
Don't make things difficult for him.

67
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,950
If he had seen the killer clearly,

68
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:35,630
he'd have ended up like the steward by now.

69
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,430
So, sir,

70
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,390
what should we do now?

71
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,160
We'll have to trouble Brother Jianxing for help.

72
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,310
Strange.

73
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,800
Since there's a smell of blood in the courtyard,

74
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,120
I should be able to smell it.

75
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,950
Unless...

76
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,950
Unless what?

77
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,120
Unless the entrance to the secret room is downwind.

78
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,310
That way, when the wind blows,

79
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,390
the smell of blood would be dispersed.

80
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,190
At this time of year,

81
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,040
the wind in Luoyang comes from the southeast.

82
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,720
Then the entrance to the secret room

83
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,480
must be in the northwest.

84
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,870
The smell of fresh grass

85
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,270
The scent of camphor wood

86
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,360
The smell of blood

87
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,310
Right there

88
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,510
Yes

89
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,630
This is the Red-feathered Chicken

90
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,430
Sir

91
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,270
Isn't this the phoenix I caught before?

92
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,270
Did you see anything?

93
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,560
Divine blood and fire

94
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:03,160
Divine blood and fire

95
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,950
Illuminates the heavens

96
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,360
Illuminates the heavens

97
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,870
May we be blessed by this light

98
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,310
May we be blessed by this light

99
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,510
May it last forever

100
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,040
What nonsense about holy blood

101
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,560
A bunch of scoundrels

102
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,190
Protect the holy blood

103
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,600
Kill them for me

104
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,800
Come on, whoever wants to die, come first

105
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,830
Blood oath to the sacred land, may the gods bless our faith

106
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:42,080
This is a test from the gods

107
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,080
Zeng Sheng, save the people first

108
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:56,840
Understood

109
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,360
Sir

110
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,120
How is it?

111
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,790
Still alive.

112
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,750
Still trying to run?

113
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,910
Listen carefully to my questions.

114
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,080
Who is behind all this?

115
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,510
Where does the blood poison come from?

116
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,790
What are you doing with so much blood?

117
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,390
I won't say anything.

118
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,000
Looking for death?

119
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,720
Wait.

120
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:47,510
Brother Jianxing

121
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,200
You're asking so many questions at once.

122
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,600
How can he answer like that?

123
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,270
I'll just ask you one thing.

124
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:58,320
Why are you taking so much blood?

125
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,870
You're asking me here,

126
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,790
should I tell you,

127
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,120
or should I not tell you?

128
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,870
Should I tell you the truth,

129
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,630
or should I lie to you?

130
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,550
What's wrong?

131
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,000
I get a little dizzy at the sight of blood.

132
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,390
What do you mean by that, talking so strangely?

133
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:24,080
You might as well just tell the truth.

134
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,030
Are you going to talk or not?

135
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,510
If you won't talk,

136
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,200
don't blame me for being rough with you.

137
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,150
I've already devoted myself to the gods.

138
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,720
Why would I fear life or death?

139
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,630
Don't waste your energy.

140
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:37,960
You're not afraid of dying.

141
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:39,440
Fine.

142
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,720
What about them?

143
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,480
If he won't talk, then you tell me.

144
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,270
Why did you kill people and take their blood?

145
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,910
Burn my broken body in the blazing holy fire.

146
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,630
Shut up.

147
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,360
The divine blood fire will soon engulf the entire land.

148
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,440
You disloyal people,

149
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,510
will all turn to ashes.

150
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,960
Hold down his hand.

151
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,320
He's dead.
