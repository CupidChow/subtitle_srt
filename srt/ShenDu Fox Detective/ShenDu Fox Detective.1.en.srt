1
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:13,310
Sister Mudan

2
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:21,760
The medicine is ready.

3
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:23,150
Thank you.

4
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,070
I'll get back to work, then.

5
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,590
Today is the debut of the courtesan Mudan.

6
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,430
She's the top performer in the establishment.

7
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:55,680
They say

8
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,040
this courtesan Mudan

9
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,230
is truly a peerless beauty.

10
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,070
If I could just see her once,

11
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,680
it would be worth it,

12
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,560
even for the fate brought by this rain.

13
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:05,350
Yes, indeed.

14
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,680
That would be such a blessing.

15
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,840
Come, come, let's have another drink.

16
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:10,950
Come on, come on.

17
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:11,680
Alright.

18
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,710
Waiter, bring us some of your signature dishes.

19
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,680
Right away.

20
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,080
Young man,

21
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,870
are you here alone?

22
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,280
Quickly.

23
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,240
Do you mind if we share the table?

24
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,710
As you wish.

25
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:36,840
Thank you.

26
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,840
The food is here.

27
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,240
It smells like blood.

28
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,800
Is this dish not fresh, or...?

29
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,120
I'm truly sorry, sir.

30
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,310
I'll replace it for you right away.

31
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,470
Sorry, sir.

32
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,430
Sir, please.

33
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,000
It's fate that we meet.

34
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,240
No matter who you are, everyone is a guest.

35
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,400
Young man, let's eat together.

36
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,870
The food is here.

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,560
Sir

38
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,630
We truly failed to serve you properly just now.

39
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,800
We sincerely apologize.

40
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,750
These are all our restaurant's signature dishes.

41
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:24,840
Thank you very much.

42
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,680
Please enjoy your meal.

43
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,000
Young man

44
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,280
Here

45
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:34,800
Come

46
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,680
Let me offer you a toast.

47
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,030
With both hands

48
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,310
Sir, it's the Blood Phoenix.

49
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,520
We finally found it.

50
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,630
The phoenix is an auspicious sign for our dynasty.

51
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:29,390
I never thought there would really be a phoenix in this world.

52
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,360
Wait, that's not right.

53
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,720
Aren't phoenixes supposed to be golden?

54
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,240
Why does this phoenix look blood red?

55
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,160
Yeah.

56
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,070
Ladies and gentlemen,

57
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,950
Ladies and gentlemen, the time for the flowers has arrived.

58
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:44,630
The peony banquet begins.

59
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,750
Alright.

60
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:47,870
Alright.

61
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:57,560
Wait, something's wrong.

62
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:22,720
The phoenix is killing people!

63
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,390
The phoenix is killing people!

64
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,950
The phoenix is killing people!

65
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,270
Nobody move!

66
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,120
Lord Hu of the Dali Court is here.

67
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,430
Let's see who dares to make a move.

68
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,680
Peony, wake up!

69
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,800
Peony, you can't die!

70
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,630
Do you know how much I spent to get you back?

71
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,750
Step back.

72
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,830
Why did you just shout that the phoenix killed someone?

73
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,160
I saw it.

74
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,510
I saw the phoenix pass through the screen.

75
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,680
It pecked at Peony's neck.

76
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:03,510
In the sky,

77
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,040
the phoenix was flying.

78
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,390
The phoenix was crying out.

79
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,120
Yes, I heard it too.

80
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,190
But if the phoenix killed someone,

81
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,510
that's a bad omen.

82
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,430
Indeed, traitors are in power now.

83
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,310
They bring disaster to the people.

84
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,480
They will be punished by heaven.

85
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,310
Enough!

86
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,720
Everyone saw it just now.

87
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,240
The phoenix was covered in flames.

88
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,920
If the phoenix killed her,

89
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,560
then on Peony's body,

90
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,270
why isn't there a single burn mark?

91
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,040
It's obvious.

92
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,190
She has been dead for some time.

93
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:30,950
So,

94
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,000
the killer

95
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,430
must be a person.

96
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,560
That means everyone here

97
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,190
is a suspect.

98
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,510
What does this have to do with me?

99
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,120
Especially you.

100
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,160
What do you mean?

101
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,070
Do you think

102
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,360
I didn't notice your hidden dart?

103
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,270
You mean this?

104
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,120
Traveling the martial world

105
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,750
carrying a weapon for self-defense

106
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:05,870
isn't unreasonable, is it?

107
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,120
I think you're planning to assassinate Lord Hu.

108
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,190
I've really learned something new today.

109
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,950
You officers

110
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,600
aren't handling cases properly at the yamen

111
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,390
but come here to drink with courtesans.

112
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,630
The most suspicious ones

113
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,190
are you, aren't you?

114
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,870
Young man

115
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,390
Young man

116
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,600
Are you alright?

117
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,190
What my subordinate just said

118
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,680
might actually be correct.

119
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,000
You are radiating murderous intent.

120
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,510
You really did come here for revenge.

121
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,390
Nonsense.

122
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,430
I'm just traveling and happened to pass through the capital.

123
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,000
What grudge would I have to settle?

124
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,240
The willow catkins in Luoyang

125
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,120
finished falling half a month ago.

126
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,630
This morning, I saw

127
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,190
on the felt cover of a merchant's cart from Luzhou

128
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,430
there were also willow catkins.

129
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:17,240
You'd have to travel at least two hundred li a day

130
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,190
to bring those catkins all the way here.

131
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,190
You have nothing with you

132
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,920
just carrying a sword and traveling a hundred li a day.

133
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,040
You can't be here just for sightseeing, can you?

134
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,070
I guess

135
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,070
the trouble you're looking for

136
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:33,510
is right here.

137
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,390
If I can prove

138
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,030
that the real culprit is someone else?

139
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,750
If you can catch the real killer

140
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,670
the Court of Justice will not falsely accuse you.

141
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,960
It's a deal.

142
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,600
Please help me take his sword.

143
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:40,910
rainwater

144
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,030
sedative

145
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,550
smell of blood

146
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,480
camphorwood scent

147
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,550
mutton smell

148
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,320
smoke

149
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,720
What are you looking at?

150
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,720
If you can solve the case, then do it.

151
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,240
Stop making things mysterious here.

152
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,630
Young man, do you have any insights?

153
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,840
Since they’re all here,

154
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,200
let’s take this opportunity to get rid of them all at once.

155
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,630
to eliminate future troubles.
