1
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,960
Young Master Xu

2
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:21,710
He's such a strange person.

3
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,840
Let's have another drink.

4
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:23,790
Forget it, forget it.

5
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,350
Miss Qiao'er, I'm here to return the key.

6
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,200
Coming.

7
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,920
Qiao'er, here's your key back.

8
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:39,790
Thank you.

9
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,040
You're welcome.

10
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,230
Then I'll head back now.

11
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,280
Alright, go ahead.

12
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,640
I'm leaving.

13
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,590
Still looking?

14
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,040
Just sit here for a while.

15
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,000
There's really nothing we can do.

16
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,960
Seeing Lord Hu and Old Madam Xu

17
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,470
So

18
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,120
so shameless

19
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,910
Just thinking about it gives me goosebumps.

20
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,520
You're absolutely right.

21
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,680
Tiantian

22
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,000
Didn't you just see it?

23
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,280
That old man Hu Zhengyi

24
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,800
at his age

25
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,560
flirting inside

26
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,560
Isn't it shameful?

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,800
Li Jianxing

28
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,840
I noticed when Qiao'er was collecting the keys just now,

29
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,360
she was very attentive to you.

30
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,520
It seems, Brother Jianxing,

31
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,630
you have someone special looking after you.

32
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:58,630
What,

33
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,590
Lord Zeng, are you jealous that I have someone caring for me?

34
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,360
But then again,

35
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,520
having someone care for you is nice,

36
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,400
but being as carefree as Brother Zeng

37
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,680
also seems quite free and easy.

38
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,360
Right?

39
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,520
He... he said nobody wants me.

40
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,310
You're so tall,

41
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,520
yet you're complaining to a little girl.

42
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:21,960
I...

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,590
Alright, that's enough.

44
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,960
Brother Jianxing,

45
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,430
you really are exceptionally charming.

46
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,430
You've only known Miss Qiao'er for a few days,

47
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,520
and she already knows what you like.

48
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,590
Why not make it a double happiness,

49
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,240
and the two of you get married?

50
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,710
Even osmanthus cake...

51
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:39,960
Do you like mung bean cake too?

52
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,400
That's right, Li Jianxing.

53
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:44,590
I think Qiao'er is still quite charming herself.

54
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,080
Why don't you spend a lovely evening with her,

55
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,800
and let me and Tiantian enjoy the rain here?

56
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:50,960
Zeng, you big fool!

57
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,240
You think I can't see through your little schemes?

58
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,590
"Still charming," you say...

59
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,470
With that degenerate pig brain of yours,

60
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,710
can you even use your head to think?

61
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,310
Do you even know how to use idioms? Murder! Murder!

62
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,910
There's been a death in the residence!

63
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,120
It was definitely death by hanging.

64
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,360
And this is the primary crime scene.

65
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,560
How can you tell?

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,030
Based on the direction of the marks on the victim's neck,

67
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,120
it's clear to see

68
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,470
she wasn't strangled by someone.

69
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,750
Also, there's filth on the ground.

70
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,960
This is something that happens

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,360
when someone dies by hanging—they lose control of their bladder.

72
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,830
Everyone, step aside!

73
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,120
Wh-what on earth is going on?

74
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,310
Th-this...

75
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,750
It's gone.

76
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,920
Why is everything gone?

77
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,510
Where are my ritual tools?

78
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,270
What about my talismans?

79
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,390
And where did that painting go?

80
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,040
Young Master Xu,

81
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:52,750
this...

82
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,830
This isn't your doing as well, is it?

83
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,630
You unfilial child!

84
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,750
Madam Xu,

85
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,630
you really can't blame me for this.

86
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,040
This bride

87
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,480
was clearly lured by Lady Yun Yin's ghost.

88
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,430
She was enticed to take her own life.

89
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,190
There's another suspicious point.

90
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,000
If Lady Liu walked here to commit suicide,

91
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,750
then why are her shoes

92
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,920
so clean?

93
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:34,600
So,

94
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,190
the killer must have carried Lady Liu here after she lost consciousness,

95
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,920
bringing her to the crime scene,

96
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,270
and then hanged her from the beam.

97
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,120
Everyone,

98
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:44,560
let's report this to the authorities.

99
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,430
No, we can't.

100
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,510
This is our family.

101
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,950
The agreement we signed with Liu's father.

102
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,120
Liu's father willingly sold his daughter to us.

103
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,510
It's clearly written in the contract.

104
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,270
If the bride dies within three days of the wedding,

105
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,600
no matter the reason,

106
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,360
it must not be reported to the authorities.

107
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,070
But you are just too...

108
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:10,800
Lai Lai.

109
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,000
Since this is a family matter for the Xu family,

110
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,190
we outsiders shouldn't interfere.

111
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,120
But even so,

112
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,070
as honored guests of the Xu residence,

113
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,750
we've encountered such an incident.

114
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,430
It's better to clarify things.

115
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,000
Tonight,

116
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,310
everyone was present at the scene,

117
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,560
except for you, Master.

118
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,720
May I ask you,

119
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,720
where were you at that time, Master?

120
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,390
Well...

121
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,800
I...

122
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,800
Is that even necessary to ask?

123
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,480
I was resting in my own room the whole time.

124
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,190
Attending the wedding during the day

125
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,390
was already the greatest respect I could show to Madam Xu.

126
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,270
As for the banquet that night,

127
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,360
I was feeling indignant,

128
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,430
so I couldn't eat anything, no matter how delicious.

129
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,120
Then, Master, may I ask you,

130
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,160
is there anyone who can vouch

131
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,510
that you were indeed in your room at that time?

132
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,160
Well...

133
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,360
What do you mean by that, young master?

134
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,240
I've already said

135
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,750
I was resting in my own room the whole time.

136
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:22,040
Naturally, there was no one else to witness it.

137
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,830
So, in that case,

138
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,600
what you said can't be verified.

139
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,160
No—

140
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,040
I—I...

141
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,800
Master,

142
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,720
I spent a lot of money to hire you for this job,

143
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,800
but someone still ended up dead.

144
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,360
Madam Xu, this...

145
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,270
If it weren't for your son,

146
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,950
doing what he did,

147
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,920
how would the vengeful spirit come out to harm people?

148
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,160
What evidence do you have

149
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,630
that it was Yun Yin's ghost causing harm?

150
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,430
I... I still...

151
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,750
Even if Yun Yin became a ghost,

152
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,600
she would still be a good ghost.

153
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,360
What?

154
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,120
A good ghost?

155
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,600
Fine, fine, fine.

156
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,240
Young master, you can keep thinking that way.

157
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:08,800
In the end,

158
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,120
it's not me who will be left without descendants.

159
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:14,120
Madam, you may seek someone more capable.

160
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,430
I will take my leave at once.

161
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,680
From now on,

162
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,360
I will no longer concern myself with any matters of the Xu household.

163
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,040
Master, master, please go ahead.

164
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:23,870
Master.

165
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,240
Such grievances...

166
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,270
Such grievances...

167
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,270
It's fine, you two talk.

168
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,120
Just pretend I'm not here.

169
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,030
When you were attending to Lady Liu in the bridal chamber,

170
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,440
did she act strangely in any way?

171
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,480
Strange in any way?

172
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,630
Our young master has always been a bit superstitious.

173
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,320
The bride was frightened.

174
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,390
Has your husband always been like this?

175
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,270
He still can't forget Lady Yun Yin.

176
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,960
Madam, don't be afraid.

177
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,600
I've had too much to drink and feel a bit tired.

178
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,960
Then let me help you remove your hairpins.

179
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,270
Let's go.

180
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,390
After the young master left,

181
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,630
she didn't seem to be in a good mood either.

182
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,750
Qiao'er, I'm here to return the key.

183
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,440
Okay, I'll be right there.

184
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,840
Madam.

185
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,510
Lailai is here to return the key.

186
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:58,390
I'll go get it first.

187
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,440
Go ahead.

188
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,120
Qiao'er, here's your key back.

189
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:06,790
Thank you.

190
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,000
You're welcome.

191
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,790
Then I'll head back now.

192
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,840
Alright, go ahead.

193
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,390
I'm leaving.

194
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,360
Still looking?

195
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,440
Madam, let me help you go rest.

196
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:23,960
Let's go.

197
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:28,240
After helping her wash up, she'll go to sleep.

198
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,750
And she's still wearing her wedding dress.

199
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,790
Madam, please rest first.

200
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,790
I'll head downstairs.

201
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,080
Go ahead.

202
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,630
After that, I went to the kitchen.

203
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,150
I realized the bride hadn't eaten all day.

204
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,120
She seemed so pitiful.

205
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,750
So I wanted to bring her some food.

206
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,120
Sorry for troubling you, Qiao'er.

207
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,080
It's no trouble at all.

208
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,440
If you need help in the future,

209
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,360
you can always come to me.

210
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,320
Alright then.

211
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,320
I'll go with Lailai to return the key.

212
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,360
We saw Xu Qiyan enter the front hall.

213
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,510
When we came back after returning the key,

214
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,120
he was still in the front hall.

215
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,480
So he didn't have time to commit the crime.

216
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,360
Alright.

217
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,120
It's getting late.

218
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,030
You must be tired too.

219
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,480
You should go back and rest early.

220
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,320
Okay.

221
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,630
Then I'll head out first.

222
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,910
Young master, call me if you need anything.

223
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,270
What are you doing?

224
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:48,120
It's almost dawn and you're still here.

225
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,120
What is it?

226
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,150
Are you planning to stay in the same room as me?

227
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,630
It's getting late.

228
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,440
I should go back and rest too.

229
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,750
Goodbye.

230
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,670
Goodbye.
