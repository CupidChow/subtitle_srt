1
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,110
So Yun Yin died in a fire?

2
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,840
If she had died in the blaze,

3
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,120
that would have been a relief.

4
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,840
But she didn't die right away.

5
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,350
Her whole body was burned.

6
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,400
She also developed a lung disease.

7
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,430
She couldn't even think about performing anymore,

8
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,230
even eating became difficult.

9
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,640
She suffered for months before she finally died.

10
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,760
So how do you know all this?

11
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,840
My sister found me back then.

12
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,280
We exchanged letters for a year.

13
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,350
About her situation,

14
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,280
I learned some of it from her letters.

15
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,480
The rest

16
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,150
came from my sister's old maid,

17
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,870
who told me before she passed away.

18
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,120
So you became a maid in the Xu family

19
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,280
to get revenge?

20
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,430
She was my sister to begin with.

21
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,200
For her sake,

22
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,200
giving up some freedom is nothing.

23
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,120
But why

24
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,430
did you hurt those innocent brides?

25
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,430
I was helping them.

26
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,000
I was helping them.

27
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:31,870
Back then, Xu Qiyan asked a Taoist for a resurrection ritual.

28
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,870
He needed five women to bring my sister back to life.

29
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,680
The first bride he married after that was named Wu.

30
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,870
To help Wu escape,

31
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,030
I pretended to be a ghost to distract the Xu family.

32
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,800
But Xu Qiyan was actually pleased.

33
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,400
He thought my sister's spirit had appeared.

34
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,710
If my sister's spirit really is watching from above,

35
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,470
the first person she'd want to kill would be Xu Qiyan.

36
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,000
But how did Wu die?

37
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,080
When she tried to escape

38
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,520
in a panic

39
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,000
she fell into the lake and drowned

40
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,750
It was my fault she died

41
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:23,910
No

42
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,030
No

43
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,030
I was helping her

44
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,630
I was saving her

45
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,360
I was saving all of them

46
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,310
If she lived, she would only suffer

47
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,750
Just like my sister

48
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,430
But I didn't have the power to let them go

49
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,960
I was helping them too

50
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,710
It was that Taoist

51
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,150
It was that Taoist

52
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,000
He said my sister could be brought back to life

53
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,150
Did you ever ask what they wanted?

54
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:56,870
Someone like you

55
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,710
How are you any different from Xu Qiyan?

56
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:16,910
Qiao'er

57
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,710
I will go to the underworld to atone to them

58
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,800
I won't let Xu Qiyan get near them again

59
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,600
Young master

60
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,800
Do you know

61
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,600
those years

62
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,720
were the happiest days of Qiao'er's life

63
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,240
Osmanthus cake is so delicious

64
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,040
Qiao'er wants to have another piece

65
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,190
Alright

66
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,830
Qiao'er, be good

67
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,310
I'll take you to eat osmanthus cake

68
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,040
I'll take you to eat osmanthus cake

69
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:37,680
So Xiaoyaozi was also killed by Sister Qiao'er.

70
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,830
Xiaoyaozi found out she had killed someone.

71
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,240
He threatened her for money.

72
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,160
So Qiao'er silenced him.

73
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,360
Then why didn't she kill Old Madam Xu?

74
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,630
It must be because

75
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,480
Madam Xu treated her like family.

76
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,720
She couldn't bring herself to do it.

77
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,800
That makes sense.

78
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,720
It's you.

79
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,390
Why are you here again?

80
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,360
Madam.

81
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,830
I've come to ask you about some past events.

82
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,830
I hope you can answer truthfully.

83
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,430
Go ahead and ask.

84
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,160
Back then,

85
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,750
a group of officials jointly submitted a petition

86
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,920
to impeach General Li Zuo for treason.

87
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,240
Old Master Xu was among them, right?

88
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,800
Yes.

89
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,510
I tried to persuade him.

90
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,430
But he was misled by others.

91
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,920
He wouldn't listen to my advice at all.

92
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,000
I truly don't know if that was fortunate or not.

93
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,870
As for General Li's impeachment,

94
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,190
before the imperial verdict was given,

95
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:05,360
his entire family was wiped out.

96
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:09,160
Though he died and his clan was destroyed,

97
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,870
he still preserved his reputation for a lifetime.

98
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,830
Among those who impeached General Li Zuo,

99
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,750
who else was there?

100
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,430
I'm just a woman.

101
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,950
He never let me get involved.

102
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,800
However,

103
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:29,800
However what?

104
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,720
I do remember one person.

105
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,830
When they secretly met to discuss impeaching General Li,

106
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,510
I saw him.

107
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,160
Who?

108
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,600
It was Mr. Hu, who came here with you.

109
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,190
Brother Jianxing,

110
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,270
Is there something you want to tell me?

111
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,190
No.

112
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,950
I was just remembering a lot of things.

113
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,000
Strange things.

114
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,360
And also recalling many things

115
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,480
that I never thought of before.

116
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,360
So it’s Lord Hu Zhengyi.

117
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,560
Your skills in solving cases

118
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,430
are already famous throughout the land.

119
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,320
Meeting you today, your reputation is truly well-deserved.

120
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,440
That's right.

121
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,080
I killed the bride.

122
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:55,630
The Lingzhou authorities will handle this case.

123
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,870
Take me to the authorities.

124
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,550
Since you admit it so readily,

125
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:06,670
I suppose you are already prepared to die.

126
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:09,910
Now,

127
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,600
Young Master Xu is already dead.

128
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,910
Even if you are sent to prison,

129
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,240
I doubt you would live to see

130
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,550
the day of your conviction and execution.

131
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,600
I have written down all my crimes.

132
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,480
They are in the front hall of the Xu residence.

133
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,080
So why bother...

134
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:42,630
Alright.

135
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:51,510
I have another question for you.

136
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,600
General Li Zuo and Lady Li—

137
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,510
When they were alive,

138
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,480
did they have any enemies?

139
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,960
Or before the incident,

140
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:07,480
did they have any disputes with anyone?

141
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,960
In your memory,

142
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,670
is there anything suspicious?

143
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,270
I was only seven at the time.

144
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,150
But I was in the woodshed then.

145
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,720
I vaguely remember

146
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,790
hearing those assassins say something strange.

147
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:32,670
What did they say?

148
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,550
It seems to be related to the Sage's ascension.

149
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,600
But as for the details,

150
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,440
I can't really remember.

151
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,790
I was just too scared at the time.

152
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,390
I see.

153
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,320
Did you gain any insights?

154
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,320
Insights?

155
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,870
I actually gained quite a few insights.

156
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,320
While working with Master Hu,

157
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,510
I learned a lot about solving cases.

158
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,080
Thinking back on it,

159
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,150
I really gained a lot.

160
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,030
That was quite a sudden flattery.

161
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,720
You must be up to something.

162
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,030
But this time, at the Sky Lantern Festival,

163
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:23,960
they say

164
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:26,600
there will be trade caravans from over a dozen countries.

165
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,510
The fun is just getting started.

166
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,670
Who knows what will happen next?

167
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,750
It's really something to look forward to.
