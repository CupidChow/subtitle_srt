1
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,600
You traitors,

2
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,600
will all be reduced to ashes.

3
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:09,790
Hold down his hands.

4
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,150
He's dead.

5
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:44,400
Now that he's in the hands of me, Luoyang's top detective, Hu Zhengyi,

6
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,400
wanting to die

7
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,070
won't be that easy.

8
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,790
Take him away.

9
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,480
Feed him my specially made Resurrection Pill.

10
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,070
Bring him back to life.

11
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,430
Then,

12
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:04,200
use all eighteen tortures on him.

13
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,760
If he dies from the pain, just give him more medicine.

14
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,400
What pill?

15
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,480
Hurry up.

16
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:14,870
Yes.

17
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:21,150
Being able to take Master Hu's Three-Corpse Resurrection Pill

18
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,190
is that boy's great fortune.

19
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,960
Once this pill is taken,

20
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,520
he won't even reach the gates of the underworld.

21
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,470
After he returns to life,

22
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,840
the excruciating pain

23
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,360
won't stop for a single moment.

24
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,310
It would be better to just die.

25
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,470
Who else wants to kill themselves?

26
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,430
Let's do it together.

27
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,280
We can all take the medicine at once.

28
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,680
I... I...

29
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,360
I'll confess.

30
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,400
You traitor!

31
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,630
You are a member of our cult.

32
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,400
You traitor, you won't die a good death.

33
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,190
Tell me, why do you kill people for their blood?

34
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,680
The Blood Bath Technique grants immortality.

35
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,000
The cult leader said

36
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,870
that once the Blood Bath Technique is mastered,

37
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,910
every cult member will benefit.

38
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,400
Then why did you

39
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,310
send the corpses back to Fulai Restaurant?

40
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,840
Our superiors ordered us

41
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,000
to deliver a fresh female corpse

42
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,680
every hour.

43
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,280
We were just following orders.

44
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,470
I don't know anything else.

45
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,630
Since they need so many fresh female corpses,

46
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,520
the Blood God Cult's headquarters

47
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,800
surely can't have only this one survivor.

48
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:31,840
Jianxing.

49
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,680
Zeng Sheng.

50
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,030
Continue searching.

51
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:35,710
Yes.

52
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:42,910
Wait.

53
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,030
What is it now?

54
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,280
The secret room is over there.

55
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,240
How do you know?

56
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,280
Trust me.

57
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,280
Go.

58
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,120
We're saved.

59
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,120
Tell me, what is this for?

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,910
They are not sacrifices.

61
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,520
They are sex slaves abducted by the cult leader.

62
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,150
You...

63
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,630
But it has nothing to do with me.

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,150
You're truly an animal.

65
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,590
Guards!

66
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:20,280
Here!

67
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,520
Take them back to Dali Temple.

68
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:22,430
Untie them.

69
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:23,560
Yes.

70
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,600
Thank you, thank you.

71
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,480
Where is Li Jianxing?

72
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,680
He was just here a moment ago.

73
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,390
Zengtou, the Blood God cult leader is missing.

74
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,630
I told you, there's something wrong with that Li guy.

75
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,430
Come with me.

76
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,120
Let's go.

77
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,390
Cult Leader.

78
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,160
I tried to ask you nicely.

79
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,560
But you wouldn't listen.

80
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,480
So I had to bring you here.

81
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,630
Now we can have a proper talk.

82
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,600
I won't say anything.

83
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,120
First, listen carefully.

84
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,070
To the sound of the wind.

85
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,800
Doesn't it sound like the cries of the dead?

86
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:38,360
I don't know how many lives you've taken.

87
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,830
But I can tell you with certainty

88
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,070
that tonight

89
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,480
I'll bury you right here.

90
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,240
The tombstone

91
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,750
is already prepared for you.

92
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,720
Of course,

93
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,800
your head will face outward.

94
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,430
Just imagine, in this pitch darkness,

95
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,870
how many vengeful spirits will come to settle scores with you.

96
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,680
How dare you!

97
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,800
You dare lay a hand on me?

98
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,310
The three thousand followers of the Blood God Sect

99
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,800
won't let you get away with this.

100
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:07,270
Your sect is involved in multiple murder cases.

101
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:10,120
Soon, the authorities will wipe them out completely.

102
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,160
Think carefully, Sect Leader.

103
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,680
Do you really think your followers

104
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,720
and those behind them

105
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,240
will actually come to save you?

106
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,600
You might as well answer my questions honestly.

107
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,680
If I'm in a good mood,

108
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,510
I might just spare your life.

109
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,390
What exactly do you want to know?

110
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:31,920
Listen.

111
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,600
The wrongful case at General Li Zuo's residence twelve years ago—

112
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,360
Tell me everything.

113
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,000
What?

114
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,680
Are you from the General's residence?

115
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,310
Stop pretending in front of me.

116
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,870
I'm asking about you right now.

117
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,830
The matter of the Li residence—

118
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,310
I really haven't forgotten.

119
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,510
That day, back then—

120
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,160
It was truly a tragedy.

121
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,920
Even General Li, who could stop thousands of troops,

122
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,120
died with his eyes open.

123
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,480
The killing was really satisfying.

124
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:13,510
That night, there were corpses everywhere.

125
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,750
The assassins—

126
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,920
their hands were covered in blood.

127
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,950
It was on that very day

128
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,160
that in the midst of blood,

129
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,800
I found my god.

130
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,430
Wait.

131
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,720
You are from the assassin organization Shuangyue.

132
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,480
You really do know quite a lot.

133
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:34,560
That's right.

134
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,190
Before I joined the Blood God Sect,

135
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,360
I was indeed an assassin of Shuangyue.

136
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,630
Why did you attack Li Zuo's residence?

137
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,430
Who gave the order?

138
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,070
How ridiculous.

139
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,830
You're also someone from the martial world.

140
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,190
As assassins,

141
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,870
how could we possibly question our employer?

142
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,480
Then let me ask you something—

143
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,120
something you definitely know.

144
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,070
Where did the blood poison come from?

145
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,240
It was a reward from the master.

146
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,480
Who is the master?

147
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,630
You want to know who the master is?

148
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,240
There's no way I'll tell you.

149
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,310
It's okay if you don't want to talk.

150
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,000
I don't want to talk right now.

151
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,630
You'll want to talk soon enough.

152
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,120
You're crazy.

153
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,830
A human has 206 bones in total.

154
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,510
I've got plenty of time to go crazy with you.

155
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,240
Are you going to talk or not?

156
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,320
Blood poison.

157
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,870
Blood poison is... is...

158
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,910
It came from the East.

159
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,030
There are others.

160
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,240
Other sects as well.

161
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,200
They use it secretly in private.

162
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,120
The Blood Bath Technique can keep you young forever.

163
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,510
I can give you the formula.

164
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,630
But you have to spare my life.

165
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,600
What I want to know now is, who is the master?

166
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:07,600
I'm not the one guilty of this.

167
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,240
Nor is it the Blood God Sect.

168
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,320
It's the one currently in the court.

169
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,720
He was the one who told me about the Blood Bath Technique.

170
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,080
Someone from the court?

171
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,150
Who?

172
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,360
Hu Zhengyi.

173
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,360
Li Jianxing.

174
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,030
Stop resisting.

175
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,910
Surrender now.

176
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,120
Chief Zeng, are you making a mistake?

177
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,270
I'm here to help with the investigation.

178
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,390
Investigate?

179
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,480
Do you need to tie up the main suspect and bring them to the wilderness to investigate?

180
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,840
We've caught you red-handed, and you still dare to argue?

181
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,670
Petty criminal.

182
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,840
Don't think you can fool the master again.

183
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,000
Take them back to the Dali Temple.

184
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,790
Serve tea to Lord Hu.

185
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,320
Thank you, Your Majesty.

186
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,440
Master Hu, what's wrong?

187
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,200
Do you find it too hot to handle?

188
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,910
His Majesty is wise.

189
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,440
