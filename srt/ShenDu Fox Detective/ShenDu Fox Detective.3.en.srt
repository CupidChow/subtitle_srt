1
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,430
What we're looking for is

2
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:10,350
the Dali Temple Minister, Hu Zhengyi.

3
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,760
Zeng Sheng, you're too honest.

4
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,680
You can't even tell when someone's joking.

5
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:26,230
Sir, this...

6
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,590
Is that funny?

7
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,640
It is funny.

8
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,710
Brother,

9
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,350
don't underestimate the Dali Temple.

10
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,710
Since you've come to Luoyang,

11
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,230
the Dali Temple has plenty of rooms.

12
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,590
Stay here for a few days.

13
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,350
Aren't you afraid I'll kill you?

14
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,710
I'm not afraid.

15
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,870
Not at all.

16
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,920
Earlier, you asked why I wasn't handling the case at the yamen.

17
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,560
Instead, I came to the restaurant.

18
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,640
That's because

19
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,480
we heard the Blood Phoenix had reappeared

20
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,480
and flew all the way to this area.

21
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:09,950
We came here specifically to investigate.

22
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:11,920
Recently, many people in the capital

23
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,840
have died tragically at the hands of the Phoenix.

24
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,350
Since you have this ability,

25
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,520
we hope you can help us uncover the truth.

26
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,430
Thank you in advance.

27
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,000
Your room is right here.

28
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,470
This place hasn't been cleaned in half a year, has it?

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,310
Just stay here as you're told.

30
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,560
Let me tell you,

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,710
you're a prime suspect right now.

32
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,310
Don't wander around without reason.

33
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,400
Since Lord Hu has already said

34
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,840
I should stay here temporarily

35
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,030
to help investigate the Phoenix case,

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,430
what right do you have

37
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,240
to treat me like a criminal here

38
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,750
and boss me around?

39
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,360
You...

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,400
I don't need to argue with you.

41
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,470
Hu has always been particular about organizing the case files.

42
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,750
The case files from Section B, Earth category.

43
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,680
You put them in the wrong order.

44
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:29,310
Come out.

45
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,830
There's an assassin! After him!

46
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,000
Yes, after him!

47
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,070
Sir, are you alright?

48
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:43,920
I'm fine.

49
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,390
Let's go, check outside.

50
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:07,270
The weather is dry, be careful with fire.

51
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,830
The weather is dry, be careful with fire.

52
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:29,750
Shen Xuan

53
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,560
Long time no see.

54
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,720
Your fox nose really is sharp.

55
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,310
But you are the Fox Emperor,

56
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
so why insist on being a "dog" at the Dali Temple?

57
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,630
Didn't I tell you to stay in Lingzhou?

58
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,000
Why did you come here to assassinate that old fox?

59
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,680
I don't need you to worry about me.

60
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,720
Even if he's the emperor,

61
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,600
as long as he's your enemy,

62
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,430
I'd still dare to kill him.

63
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:05,720
Sir

64
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,680
I heard you've been staying at Fulai Restaurant lately.

65
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,480
I've only just moved in a few days ago.

66
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,390
But I haven't found the right opportunity to act against him yet.

67
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,270
With your skills,

68
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,000
that shouldn't be the case.

69
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,270
Ever since you told me

70
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,950
that the real culprit behind the Li family's massacre was Hu Zhengyi,

71
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,950
that name has been like a brand

72
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,480
deeply etched in my heart.

73
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,720
But I still need to find out

74
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,830
the whole truth behind the massacre.

75
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,600
So

76
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,040
I need to wait.

77
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,950
You always know what you're doing.

78
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,510
I trust you.

79
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,040
But don't let me down.

80
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:41,830
It wasn't easy to find out

81
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,630
that the massacre back then was connected to Hu Zhengyi.

82
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,480
We can't lose this only lead.

83
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,750
Besides, there have been many unexplained deaths in Luoyang lately.

84
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,120
We can't just stand by and do nothing.

85
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,390
You've only known him for a day,

86
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,830
and you've already been swayed by him.

87
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:59,120
Now you're even helping him investigate the case.

88
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,920
I actually think the Phoenix case isn't that simple.

89
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,750
It should be connected to the massacre back then

90
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,160
in some way.

91
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,870
But after all, you're here for revenge.

92
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,480
With me here,

93
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,720
at least you have someone to watch your back.

94
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,390
You know

95
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,920
how I feel.

96
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,120
Once you've avenged your great grudge,

97
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,750
the two of us will retire to the mountains together.

98
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,000
Wherever you go then,

99
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,560
I'll go too.

100
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:37,830
Shen Xuan

101
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,000
Look into my eyes and say it.

102
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,150
Go out.

103
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,670
Yes.

104
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:01,870
So many.

105
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,550
Based on the investigation at the scene,

106
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,870
we can basically infer

107
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,150
that from late last night until early morning,

108
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,080
the Phoenix appeared five times.

109
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,600
Almost every hour, someone died.

110
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,870
Any leads?

111
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,360
The bodies were discarded randomly.

112
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,550
There’s no pattern at all.

113
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,120
Also, the victims’ times of death

114
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,080
can’t be determined.

115
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,480
The only similarity is

116
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:33,270
all the bodies are of unmarried young girls.

117
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,270
In any case,

118
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,790
I’ll leave this to you, Tiantian.

119
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,960
Don’t worry, Brother Zeng.

120
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:45,790
By the way,

121
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,480
there’s a newcomer at the Dali Court named Li Jianxing.

122
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,600
He looks decent on the outside,

123
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,960
but he’s definitely not a good person.

124
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,750
Remember,

125
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,440
no matter what he says to you,

126
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,550
don’t respond.

127
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,440
Don’t worry.

128
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,440
I am absolutely loyal to Lord Hu.

129
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:16,910
Sorry about that.

130
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,270
Did I scare you?

131
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,510
You’re the one

132
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,000
who looks decent on the outside—Li Jianxing.

133
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,360
That’s not what I meant.

134
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,910
I’m Song Tiantian, coroner of the Dali Court.

135
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,270
I am Li Jianxing.

136
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:38,910
Lord Hu asked me to come and help.

137
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:47,960
Don't move.

138
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,840
There's poison on the blade.

139
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,320
I've been wandering outside for many years.

140
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,120
This is the first time I've seen a female coroner.

141
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,440
And such a skilled female coroner at that.

142
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,840
I'm here to repay Lord Hu's kindness.

143
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,390
Hu Zhengyi, that old fox,

144
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,840
even knows how to win people over.

145
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,910
I truly stayed of my own will.

146
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:14,790
A few years ago,

147
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,750
a brute tried to assault me.

148
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,390
I accidentally killed him.

149
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,000
He was a bad man—he deserved it.

150
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,320
You did the right thing.

151
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,960
What's wrong?

152
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,320
Zengtou is always suspicious and paranoid.

153
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,670
If you can think this way,

154
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,030
then you definitely aren't a bad person.

155
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,080
So,

156
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,120
it was Lord Hu who helped you escape punishment?

157
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,240
Lord Hu sentenced me to execution after the autumn.

158
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:50,440
What?
