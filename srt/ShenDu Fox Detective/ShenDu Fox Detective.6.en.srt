1
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,430
Lin's Warehouse

2
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,640
Who goes there?

3
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,350
How dare you barge into this restricted warehouse?

4
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:21,790
We're from the Court of Judicial Review, investigating a case.

5
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:23,870
The Court of Judicial Review?

6
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,680
Do you have an official badge as proof?

7
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,590
So you're the famous detective of Luoyang, Zeng Tou.

8
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,920
I failed to recognize you.

9
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,280
Officer Zeng, please, come in.

10
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,040
Zeng Sheng from the Court of Judicial Review is here to investigate.

11
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,430
Where is the person in charge?

12
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,510
Coming, coming!

13
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,760
You are Zeng Sheng?

14
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:53,950
That's me.

15
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,870
You're also Zeng Sheng?

16
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,920
Then which one of you is the real Zeng Sheng?

17
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,150
Of course, it's me.

18
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,560
How dare you steal my badge!

19
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,680
Here, take it!

20
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,710
Zeng Tou, since you're already here,

21
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,920
if you don't like me impersonating you,

22
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,430
next time I'll impersonate Lord Hu.

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,590
Let's go to the warehouse.

24
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:18,840
Sir, this way please.

25
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,630
Besides this warehouse in Shendu,

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,360
where else can you find camphor wood?

27
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,680
In our Shendu,

28
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,590
we don't produce this kind of camphor wood.

29
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,960
At most, ordinary people

30
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,120
have some camphor wood strips at home to repel insects.

31
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,560
Sir, you know as well,

32
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,190
it’s transported here from the south,

33
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,680
and then piled up at my place.

34
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,560
After that, it’s distributed for different tasks

35
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,360
and sent to Dafu Xian Temple.

36
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,680
So recently, besides us,

37
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,630
who else has been coming in and out of this warehouse?

38
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,470
Just the porters.

39
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,430
Sir, please come inside.

40
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,310
Sir, this is the place.

41
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,840
All the processed camphor wood

42
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,960
is stored here.

43
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,280
Hu Zhengyi is quite shrewd.

44
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,360
Since he already knew where the camphor wood was stored,

45
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,400
why didn’t he just say so earlier?

46
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,960
Lord Hu’s thoughts

47
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,870
aren’t something someone like you can guess.

48
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:25,470
Manager.

49
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,150
How long has it been since this warehouse was last cleaned?

50
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,750
Oh, come on.

51
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,870
According to the rules,

52
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,910
we clean the warehouse every month.

53
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:35,840
Here,

54
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,710
do we have a transport route

55
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:38,910
and storage map for the camphor wood?

56
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,280
Yes.

57
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,910
Xiao Zhang, the map.

58
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,310
Go on, go.

59
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,710
Camphor wood,

60
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,000
is not a local tree species.

61
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,240
Sir, look,

62
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:58,000
the Sage wants to build Dafu Xian Temple.

63
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,470
Sir, please take a look.

64
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,310
The sage wants to build the Da Fuxian Temple.

65
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,280
The timber is transported via the Luo River to Luoyang.

66
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,470
Then it goes through the warehouse.

67
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:18,430
Finally, it arrives at Da Fuxian Temple.

68
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,840
Da Fuxian Temple.

69
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,870
Alright, leave it to me.

70
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,510
Wait for me at home tonight.

71
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,310
Why are you leaving again?

72
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,270
Zeng Sheng.

73
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:34,950
Zeng Sheng.

74
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,120
You're quite serious.

75
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm solving a case.

76
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,480
So, what did you find?

77
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,070
What are you looking at?

78
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,750
You actually suit this outfit.

79
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,040
Did you find anything?

80
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,480
There were some places I couldn't get to.

81
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,920
But judging from the places I've checked so far,

82
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,870
the scent of camphor is strong.

83
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,310
There's no smell of blood.

84
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,190
Is it possible

85
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,160
that these girls

86
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,310
all stayed somewhere with camphor incense?

87
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:12,830
Pay attention and learn.

88
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,720
The scent of new camphor wood and old camphor wood

89
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,750
is subtly different.

90
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,120
After smelling both the Dafuxian Temple and the warehouse,

91
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,720
one thing is certain.

92
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,680
It's the scent of new camphor wood.

93
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,240
I'll tentatively believe your scent theory.

94
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,560
In the first case at the restaurant,

95
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,720
Mudanhua disappeared for about half an hour.

96
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,830
If we subtract the quarter hour used for bloodletting,

97
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,600
there are still three quarters of an hour left.

98
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,190
Are you sure you could carry someone

99
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,510
and make a round trip in that time?

100
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,560
It's not possible from the restaurant to Dafuxian Temple.

101
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,430
It's not possible from the restaurant to the warehouse either.

102
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,310
I doubt you could do it, too.

103
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,310
Then it must have been picked up during transport.

104
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,360
That's even less likely.

105
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,160
When transporting the body,

106
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,920
the body would definitely be wrapped up.

107
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,270
Even if it came into contact,

108
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,830
it would be hard for the scent to get on the clothes.

109
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,270
If that's what you're saying,

110
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:02,920
then all three places

111
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,630
could be the site of the murder and bloodletting.

112
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,950
So how did the killer manage

113
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,920
to use all three places

114
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:13,000
and finish the murder and bloodletting in half an hour?

115
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,680
That's really strange.

116
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,430
Where did things go wrong?

117
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,190
Got it.

118
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,160
Your dog nose isn't working.

119
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,480
Who's got a dog nose? That's you.

120
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,750
Anyway, I'll report this to Lord Hu.

121
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,430
We should go to the restaurant again.

122
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,630
After all, that's the first crime scene.

123
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,120
Maybe we missed some clues.

124
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:42,870
Not bad, you're a bit smart.

125
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,480
Let's go.

126
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:54,720
Boss.

127
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,160
Why are you here alone?

128
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,240
Sir, we haven't opened for business these days.

129
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,040
That's fine.

130
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,950
We're just here to look around.

131
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:10,430
Fulai Restaurant is quite famous in Shendu.

132
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,000
But now it's so deserted.

133
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,270
Sir, you know as well.

134
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,800
Something so serious happened.

135
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,390
Guests don't want to come anymore.

136
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,870
All the staff have left too.

137
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,630
Now it's just me left.

138
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,070
Doing odd jobs here.

139
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:25,920
Odd jobs.

140
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,920
Have there been any suspicious people these days?

141
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,270
Not even suspicious ones.

142
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,720
No one's come at all.

143
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,720
Where did the boss go?

144
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,190
He said he's not feeling well.

145
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,430
He's resting at home.

146
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:42,510
That night when the phoenix arrived,

147
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,040
did anyone suddenly run out?

148
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,830
I can't really remember.

149
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,480
I might need to think about it.

150
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:50,630
Incense.

151
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,040
Sir.

152
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,480
This is the incense powder bought before the incident.

153
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,600
That's strange...

154
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,800
It was only used once.

155
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,190
Why are two boxes missing?

156
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:11,190
Someone secretly switched the incense coil.

157
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,510
That makes sense.

158
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,040
On the day of the incident,

159
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,390
each of us saw Mudan.

160
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,070
At that time, the waiter reminded us

161
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,430
that Mudan lit an incense coil.

162
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,750
So in everyone's subconscious,

163
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:28,600
they used the incense coil to deduce the time they saw Mudan.

164
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,070
But what they didn't know

165
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,000
was that someone had secretly switched

166
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,430
the incense coil that was already half burned.

167
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,240
This way, in everyone's subconscious,

168
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:40,240
the time of Mudan's disappearance was shortened.

169
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,550
So the subsequent murders

170
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,670
happened about once every hour.

171
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,910
If that's the case,

172
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,440
the warehouse and Dafu Xian Temple

173
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:52,840
could both possibly

174
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,630
be the primary crime scene.

175
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,480
But I still don't understand

176
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,440
why they insisted on bringing the body

177
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,480
back to the restaurant.

178
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,390
Because they wanted to drag me into this.

179
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,720
It seems

180
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,120
like it's aimed at the ascension of the Sage.

181
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,360
But actually, I'm the main target.

182
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,510
Sir,

183
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,080
what do you mean by that?

184
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,000
This case,

185
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,630
as long as I'm present at the scene,

186
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:21,150
can only be investigated by the Dali Court.

187
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,150
This case also involves

188
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,000
the auspicious phoenix sign

189
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,960
that appeared during the Sage's ascension.

190
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,750
If I investigate,

191
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,120
it will inevitably bring up old matters from the Sage's enthronement.

192
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,720
If I don't investigate,

193
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,390
the military order comes first,

194
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,750
and then I'll be dismissed from my post.

195
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,840
This case kills two birds with one stone.

196
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,200
It seems to target the sage.

197
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,870
But in fact, it also conveniently gets rid of me.

198
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:53,550
Sir,

199
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,080
in the current court,

200
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,480
the only ones who oppose you

201
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,270
are Sun Chengjing and his faction.

202
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,150
But if he really did this,

203
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,120
isn't he afraid he might fail to implicate you

204
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,150
and instead

205
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,120
lose his own wealth and status?

206
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,320
Perhaps

207
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,080
there is an extremely important reason

208
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,960
that makes him willing to lose his own wealth and status

209
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:18,030
just to drag me down with him.

210
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:20,480
Shopkeeper,

211
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,320
tell me,

212
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,960
who has the key to this warehouse

213
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,200
here among you?

214
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,960
Only the handyman Xiao Guo has it.

215
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,200
Is it possible he gave it to someone else?

216
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,390
That's absolutely impossible.

217
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,390
Because I warned him from the very beginning,

218
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,080
if he lent the key to anyone else,

219
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,600
and something went missing from the warehouse,

220
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,000
I would never let him off the hook.

221
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,670
Would he lend it to that waiter?

222
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,870
That would never happen.

223
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,200
What about that waiter?

224
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,240
Although he usually works hard,

225
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,320
he's not exactly honest.

226
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,150
We all know that.

227
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,200
Before the Peony Banquet started,

228
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,870
where was the handyman?

229
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,120
He should have been busy in the backyard.

230
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,240
He also usually handles some deliveries.

231
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,670
Since when

232
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,150
has he been working here?

233
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,670
About a month ago.

234
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,600
Zeng Sheng,

235
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,200
you also found out earlier

236
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,360
that the waiter also suddenly came into money

237
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,750
about a month ago, right?

238
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:12,440
Yes.

239
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:16,000
Does the handyman have any particular habits?

240
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,030
He likes to mess around with plants and flowers.

241
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,270
And he's especially fond of cleanliness.

242
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,120
Plants and flowers?

243
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,630
Shopkeeper,

244
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,360
would you mind taking us to your backyard for a look?

245
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,390
This spot

246
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,870
happens to have a clear view of the victim's room.

247
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:36,670
So if that day

248
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,870
someone wanted to move the body from here,

249
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,600
they would first have to make sure

250
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,320
that there was no one in the courtyard.

251
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,550
And the busy servant couldn't tell anyone.

252
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:50,480
Go, go.

253
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,750
So if this matter

254
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:54,080
was to be absolutely foolproof,

255
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,360
everyone,

256
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:56,750
then this person

257
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,240
was actually the servant himself.

258
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,840
You killed Mudan.

259
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,390
Get out of the way!

260
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,000
Jianxing, are you alright?

261
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:22,200
I'm fine.

262
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,600
Don't move.

263
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:27,720
Come with me to Dali Temple.

264
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,600
He's been poisoned by blood toxin.

265
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,000
You should be the ones begging for mercy.

266
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,840
Divine blood fire,

267
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,390
shine upon the heavens,

268
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,630
grant us this light,

269
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,790
and let it last forever.
