1
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,640
Sir

2
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,640
There's news from the Court of Judicial Review

3
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,310
You may depart now

4
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:22,840
There's ash

5
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,310
Since you can't do anything right,

6
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,640
then you deserve to die.

7
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:02,870
Master

8
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,590
There's no one here now.

9
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,280
Hurry up and tell me.

10
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,000
Who is the person behind you?

11
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,870
Are you looking for me?

12
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,590
You betrayed me, the Dark Emperor. Prepare to die.

13
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,630
Who is this?

14
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,280
This move is called "Luring the enemy into the trap."

15
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,800
Although your martial arts are strong,

16
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:38,910
you're not very smart.

17
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,630
Fine, fine.

18
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,280
What a clever trap.

19
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,840
But you alone can't stop me.

20
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,400
What if you add me to the mix?

21
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,240
Don't hold me back.

22
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,910
Still not surrendering?

23
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,710
So what do you suggest?

24
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:09,630
Do you remember the waiter and Old Li who were poisoned?

25
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,310
After the waiter died,

26
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,280
we detained the prison guard who gave him water.

27
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,080
We also investigated

28
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,800
Old Li, who had always delivered water to the Dali Court.

29
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,870
Old Li is dead, right?

30
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:20,080
Yes.

31
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,080
It was my negligence.

32
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,560
After that incident,

33
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,870
I secretly conducted an internal investigation.

34
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,480
I actually found someone.

35
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,870
But I haven't acted against him yet.

36
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,950
As for the leader's conditions,

37
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,310
just agree to them.

38
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,480
As long as they don't violate the law or morals,

39
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,240
I can handle it.

40
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,190
Whether he talks or not doesn't matter.

41
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,870
We just need to make the person behind the scenes

42
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,190
believe that he has talked.

43
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,120
Listen,

44
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,720
I'll tell you everything I know.

45
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,510
Shut up.

46
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,310
No talking.

47
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,240
You dare act so arrogant even in the dungeon?

48
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,830
If you say one more word,

49
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,360
you'll be flogged.

50
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,310
Lord Hu,

51
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,680
you've anticipated everything.

52
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,600
But there's one thing you didn't expect.

53
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,120
You didn't expect that you're even dumber than we thought.

54
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,160
You didn't anticipate my martial arts.

55
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,600
Such shameless boasting.

56
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,390
Chunyang Sword

57
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,510
It really is a fine sword.

58
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,720
It truly lives up to its reputation.

59
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,950
The original owner of this sword

60
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,240
asked me to use this sword

61
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,510
to slay you, the main culprit.

62
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,920
Keep dreaming.

63
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,310
You’re asking for death.

64
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,190
You have nowhere left to run.

65
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,070
Why don’t you just surrender?

66
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,870
I, the Underworld Emperor, am one of the Five Emperors.

67
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,510
How could I let myself be captured by you so easily?

68
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,560
And let you torture me?

69
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,560
Do you recognize him?

70
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,510
No, I don’t.

71
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:57,430
Zeng Sheng.

72
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,190
Here.

73
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,360
Go check the wanted notices from the Dali Court.

74
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,240
See if any match this face.

75
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:03,950
Yes, sir.

76
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,120
Do you think this is too easy?

77
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,270
The Five Emperors.

78
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,190
They are chosen from the major martial arts sects

79
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,920
based on their martial arts skills.

80
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,240
As the Fox Emperor,

81
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,870
I rank last among the Five Emperors.

82
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,120
The Underworld Emperor is ranked fourth.

83
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,000
When I fought him just now,

84
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,750
although his martial arts aren’t bad,

85
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,360
to call him the fourth best today

86
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,120
seems a bit of a stretch.

87
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,000
Of course,

88
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,310
this is all just my own speculation.

89
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:45,720
Sir,

90
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,720
what should we do now?

91
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,800
All our leads have dried up.

92
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,000
Your master is already dead.

93
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,120
You can talk now, can’t you?

94
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,240
Alright.

95
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,000
I'll tell you everything I know.

96
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,560
I'll tell you all of it.

97
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,950
Seven years ago,

98
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,480
it was Lord Mingdi

99
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,600
who saved me from a pile of corpses.

100
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:26,870
After that,

101
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,430
he sent me to the Western Regions to recover.

102
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,120
Until the year before last,

103
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,600
he summoned me back.

104
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,510
He said he had an important task for me.

105
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,800
So,

106
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,600
you came to Shendu

107
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,000
and established the Blood God Sect.

108
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:41,630
That's right.

109
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,870
At first,

110
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,960
we just recited scriptures

111
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,630
and discussed teachings.

112
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,440
Until two months ago,

113
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,390
Lord Mingdi suddenly summoned me

114
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,750
and said we needed the blood of young women

115
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,030
for a ritual.

116
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,840
After that, you all know what happened.

117
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,840
Our Blood God Sect killed people and drained their blood,

118
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,240
spreading fear.

119
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,000
Earlier, you said

120
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,870
the massacre at General Li Zuo's residence

121
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:13,240
was orchestrated by someone in the court.

122
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,630
Who exactly is this person?

123
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,390
All I know is

124
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,000
that person now holds a high position.

125
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,600
But as for who it is,

126
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,120
I'm not sure.

127
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,670
Back then in Shuangyue, I was just a low-level thug.

128
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,550
I followed the leader

129
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,150
and committed many hired killings.

130
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,670
In the end, we turned on each other.

131
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,200
Most of us were killed or wounded.

132
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,750
I suppose it was retribution.

133
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,360
Alright.

134
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,080
I've said everything I needed to say.

135
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,600
I only ask for a quick death.

136
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,510
That's not difficult.

137
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,200
But—

138
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,960
If you want your body to remain intact after death,

139
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,000
and not be thrown into the wild for stray dogs to devour,

140
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,390
you must agree to one thing.

141
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,000
What is it?

142
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,960
Hand over the antidote for the blood poison.

143
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,670
The third brother is dead.

144
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,840
There's that old fox Hu Zhengyi in the Dali Court.

145
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,200
It's not so easy to get in and kill someone.

146
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,480
But the third brother's death wasn't in vain.

147
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,240
The Phoenix case caused such a huge stir.

148
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,550
And now the Blood God Sect is involved too.

149
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,150
I'm afraid that without sacrificing a "Shadow,"

150
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,150
it would be hard to answer for this.

151
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,480
Hu Zhengyi.

152
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,790
The Blood God case is just being wrapped up so hastily.

153
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,200
Brother Jianxing,

154
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,480
it seems you've recovered well.

155
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,390
Lord Hu,

156
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,630
you helped me get the antidote for the blood poison.

157
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:21,910
I owe you for that.

158
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,910
But this case—

159
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,390
is it really ending so hastily?

160
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,840
And you're even posting notices outside to announce it to the world.

161
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:30,360
I'm sorry, but I can't agree with this.

162
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,000
The Blood God Sect has been destroyed.

163
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,270
The sect leader, as the main culprit,

164
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,440
has also been sentenced to immediate execution.

165
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,840
Why can't the case be closed?

166
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,550
How is that considered hasty?

167
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,150
But you know in your heart,

168
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,390
there's still someone behind all this.
