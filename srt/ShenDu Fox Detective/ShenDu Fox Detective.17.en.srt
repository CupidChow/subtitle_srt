1
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,000
Dad

2
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,310
Dad

3
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,280
Are you crazy?

4
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:09,920
I think you're the crazy one.

5
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,840
Why aren't you sleeping in your own room in the middle of the night?

6
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,840
Why did you climb into my bed?

7
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,840
I just got up to use the bathroom.

8
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,190
I saw something strange.

9
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,680
So I came to talk to you about it.

10
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,680
I think the strangest person here is you.

11
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,080
Listen to me.

12
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:33,360
Dusk falls deeply.

13
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,000
The flute plays on the evening boat.

14
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,520
It's hard to rest in the corridor.

15
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:53,150
A haunting dream lingers in my heart.

16
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,120
A female ghost with long hair covering her face

17
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,310
suddenly disappeared.

18
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,240
That's right.

19
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,280
Master Hu

20
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,150
Maybe you've done something guilty

21
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,870
and now the ghost is haunting you.

22
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,560
You think I'm like you?

23
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,520
I really saw it.

24
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,520
That female ghost

25
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,080
Stop!

26
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,960
You're even bringing out talismans?

27
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,470
Young Master Xu

28
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,430
Give that to me.

29
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,750
It's all because of you, you wicked sorcerer.

30
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,150
You've caused Yun Yin to be unable to rest in peace.

31
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,000
Young Master Xu, you've misunderstood me.

32
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,910
What I'm doing

33
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,000
is entirely to help Miss Yun Yin rest in peace.

34
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,840
You, you—

35
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,470
Why can't you tell right from wrong?

36
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:34,910
You—

37
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:35,310
Stop!

38
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,560
What are you all doing?

39
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,520
Madam Xu.

40
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,870
Madam Xu, you're finally here.

41
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:44,000
If your son keeps causing trouble like this,

42
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,710
I'm afraid I won't be able to help any further.

43
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,630
Just now, I heard it clearly from my room.

44
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,960
Those sounds of singing came through.

45
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,310
I'm sure you all heard it too, right?

46
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,310
I heard it.

47
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:57,870
See?

48
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:58,520
I heard it too.

49
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,240
This...

50
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,080
That's the ghost of Lady Yun Yin causing trouble.

51
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,960
The previous new wives were all killed by her.

52
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,960
Nonsense!

53
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,310
Stop fighting!

54
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,240
You—

55
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,000
Are you still going to be obsessed with that woman?

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,590
How long will you remain so stubborn?

57
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,120
She won't let your new wife go.

58
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,520
She wants to end the Xu family line.

59
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:23,870
You don't understand.

60
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,950
None of you understand.

61
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,750
Yun Yin cares about me.

62
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,070
Because Yun Yin cares about me.

63
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,950
Don't remove the talismans again.

64
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,600
You...

65
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,390
Madam Xu, look at this.

66
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,160
This... this is all ruined.

67
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:38,870
You...

68
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,830
This... this...

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,240
What should we do about this?

70
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:42,830
Let me.

71
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,000
I'll pick them all up for you.

72
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,920
I won't leave a single one behind.

73
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,510
This...

74
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,240
Miss Qiao'er.

75
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,870
Xu Qiyan's late wife.

76
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,950
What kind of person was she?

77
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,600
Madam Yun Yin.

78
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,040
She passed away before I came to the Xu residence.

79
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,630
But ever since then,

80
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,830
people in the residence often hear her voice.

81
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,480
Our young master has never been able to forget her.

82
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,000
This stage was built because she loved opera when she was alive.

83
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,430
That's why it was built.

84
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,870
Can't forget her,

85
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,630
yet he keeps getting married.

86
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,480
It's not him who wants to remarry.

87
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,630
It's the old madam.

88
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,630
Our young master can't go against her wishes.

89
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,870
But every bride he marries dies.

90
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,070
Everyone says

91
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,240
it's Madam Yun Yin's jealous spirit.

92
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,390
She won't allow her husband to marry again.

93
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,920
Young master.

94
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,070
This residence is indeed very strange now.

95
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,480
I advise you to leave as soon as possible.

96
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,000
Then I won't disturb your rest any longer.

97
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,160
Heaven and earth bear witness, the sun and moon are our matchmakers.

98
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,480
Today, the groom is Young Master Xu.

99
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,630
He and Miss Liu are deeply in love.

100
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,190
They are to be joined in marriage.

101
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:30,070
May the couple perform the wedding ceremony.

102
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,120
First bow to heaven and earth.

103
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,560
Second bow to the elders.

104
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,430
Sir.

105
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,750
It's clearly a wedding,

106
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,360
but everyone looks so gloomy.

107
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:46,680
It's probably because

108
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,800
something always goes wrong at these weddings.

109
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,390
Why didn't I hear

110
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,830
that strange sound during the day?

111
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,600
What's with the ghosts in the daytime?

112
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:57,950
Those ghosts,

113
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,750
are probably resting in the underworld.

114
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,000
The ceremony is complete.

115
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:05,630
Tonight

116
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,270
is destined to be a sleepless night.

117
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,720
Don't drink too much.

118
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,800
After the banquet,

119
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,240
I'll go keep watch.

120
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,680
I want to see who he really is.

121
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,920
Good son.

122
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,950
Miss Qiao'er

123
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,720
Miss Qiao'er

124
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,560
Miss Qiao'er

125
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,830
I lost the key to my room.

126
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,430
Do you have a spare?

127
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,430
Yes, I do.

128
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,240
Thank you.

129
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,950
I still have things to do.

130
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,950
Then I'll be going now.

131
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,240
Miss Qiao'er

132
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,310
May I ask you something, if it's convenient?

133
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,800
You and Hu, my brother—

134
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,240
Have you met before?

135
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,630
It's just that I often see you two chatting happily.

136
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,240
It's as if old friends have reunited.

137
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,480
No, we just met recently.

138
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,630
You get along so well even though you just met.

139
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,120
It's really enviable.

140
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:28,480
A few days ago, I accidentally made Brother Hu Tu angry.

141
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,600
I've been worrying about how to apologize to him.

142
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,070
I've observed these past couple of days

143
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,240
that he likes sweet things.

144
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,390
Especially osmanthus cake.

145
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,750
If you want to apologize to him,

146
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,510
give him a box of osmanthus cake from West Street.

147
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,670
That would be perfect.

148
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:45,600
Sister Qiao'er

149
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,030
Sister Qiao'er

150
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,120
Why are you still here?

151
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,630
The madam is looking for you everywhere.

152
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:54,480
Hurry up and go.

153
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,150
Miss Hu, I'll go take care of things now.

154
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,480
Alright.

155
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,440
She even knows his favorite food is osmanthus cake.

156
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,000
And she still claims they don't know each other.

157
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,510
She's definitely hiding something from me.

158
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:23,910
Wedding wine

159
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,150
Love lingers beneath the embroidered canopy, with the full moon and blooming flowers.

160
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,600
Please, both of you, have some.

161
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,510
Husband, what are you looking at?

162
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:53,270
Yun Yin should be arriving soon.

163
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,720
Madam, don't be afraid. It's alright.

164
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,200
Has your husband always been like this?

165
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,480
Young master is not a bad person.

166
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,000
It's just that

167
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,000
he can't quite forget Lady Yun Yin.

168
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,670
Madam, don't be afraid.

169
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,270
I've had too much to drink.

170
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,750
I'm feeling a bit tired.

171
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,360
Then let me help you remove your hairpins.

172
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,840
Alright.

173
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:43,720
One should enjoy life to the fullest when things go well.

174
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,910
Madam Dowager.

175
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,030
Today, it's rare for us

176
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,720
to gather together like this.

177
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,510
The atmosphere is so joyful.

178
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,240
This wine,

179
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:58,240
the more you drink, the better it tastes.

180
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,150
Cheers!

181
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,440
Cheers, cheers!

182
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,440
May I ask, madam, how old are you?

183
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,790
Oh, listen to you.

184
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,240
You're joking, just joking.

185
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,510
I'm already at this age.

186
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,510
How can I still talk about being young?

187
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,240
I'll go return the key.

188
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:21,670
I'll go too.

189
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,670
Where are you two going?

190
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,080
Aren't you a guard?

191
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,200
The officials have all had too much to drink.

192
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,150
Leave them here with me.

193
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:28,720
No.

194
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,670
Sir, I...

195
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,510
Step back.

196
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,600
Alright.

197
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Young Master Xu.

198
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,790
Come, let me toast you again.
