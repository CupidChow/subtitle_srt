1
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,640
What do you think, young man?

2
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,240
In the victim's mouth

3
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,120
there's a hint of sedative.

4
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,840
That means she was drugged.

5
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,560
You can even smell that?

6
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:18,280
Of course.

7
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:19,710
Also,

8
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,760
her clothes are damp.

9
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,870
They're filled with the smell of smoke and rainwater.

10
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,200
Maybe even before the dancer started performing,

11
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,310
Mudanhad already been killed.

12
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,760
She was placed behind this screen.

13
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:36,790
After being killed, she was put behind the screen.

14
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,120
How could this happen?

15
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,070
So that's how it is.

16
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,350
The killer filled the sheep intestines with blood.

17
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,560
They wrapped it around Mudan's neck.

18
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,840
It looked like the phoenix was pecking at a person.

19
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,430
But it was actually the sheep intestines.

20
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,710
If that's what you're saying,

21
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,310
the killer could even control the phoenix to target precisely.

22
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,870
That's a bit far-fetched.

23
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,310
Boss,

24
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,150
did Mudan go out today?

25
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,230
No.

26
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,950
Mudan is proud and aloof by nature.

27
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,760
She rarely goes out.

28
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,430
When was the last time you saw her?

29
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,280
About an hour ago, I think.

30
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,680
It should be half an hour ago.

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,430
When the murder happened just now,

32
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,840
you were terrified.

33
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,710
Why do you remember the time so clearly?

34
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,430
Reporting to you, sir,

35
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,960
our establishment always keeps time with incense coils.

36
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,000
One incense coil burns for an hour.

37
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,910
Today, Mudan herself lit the incense.

38
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,030
It should have only burned halfway by now.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,400
If Mudan didn't go out herself,

40
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,590
there's only one possibility.

41
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,710
The killer knocked her out and took her away.

42
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,680
After killing her cruelly,

43
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,310
they brought her back.

44
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,080
Impossible.

45
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,800
The restaurant only has one main entrance.

46
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,240
And all the guests coming and going

47
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,430
I remember them clearly.

48
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,630
That means

49
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,960
the dance floor wasn't the original crime scene.

50
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,590
Sir, this way please.

51
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,910
This is Mudan's boudoir.

52
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,840
There are marks here from rope friction.

53
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,430
The killer could have entered and exited from here.

54
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,030
Look carefully, kid.

55
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,710
This is the second floor.

56
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,280
Do you think the killer can be in two places at once?

57
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,000
He lowers someone down with a rope from above,

58
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,360
while also catching them below at the same time?

59
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,710
Your analysis is correct.

60
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:45,960
So,

61
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,150
in this restaurant,

62
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,240
there must be another accomplice.

63
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,000
I...

64
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,030
When I first saw you,

65
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,310
I smelled a strong scent of blood.

66
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,240
I thought the food wasn't fresh.

67
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,030
But actually, after the rain,

68
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,240
because you were so nervous,

69
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,840
when you moved the body,

70
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,190
you accidentally got blood on yourself.

71
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,800
That bloody smell.

72
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,710
Is it the food that's not fresh, or...

73
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,360
Sir, I'm truly sorry.

74
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,430
I'll change the dish for you right away.

75
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,400
I'm sorry, sir.

76
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,800
After my unintentional reminder,

77
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:29,000
you took the chance to change your clothes.

78
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,560
Sir.

79
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,600
We really didn't serve you well just now.

80
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,800
I'm truly sorry.

81
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:33,920
Please enjoy your meal.

82
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,750
You took advantage of the time before the guests arrived

83
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,870
to hide the body behind that screen.

84
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,510
I accidentally spilled duck blood in the kitchen today.

85
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,120
That's why there's a smell of blood on me.

86
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,000
If that's the case,

87
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,510
then I suspect him as well.

88
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,430
He booked the room next to Peony on the second floor.

89
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,120
He had plenty of opportunities to act.

90
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,830
Suspicions don't matter.

91
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,040
As long as we find the clothes you changed out of,

92
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,360
and check if there's any bloodstain on them,

93
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,680
then compare it with the scene,

94
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,160
everything will become clear.

95
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,190
Sir,

96
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,360
I didn't kill anyone.

97
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,560
I didn't kill anyone.

98
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,720
Sir, I didn't.

99
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,950
I really didn't kill anyone.

100
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:16,720
Sir,

101
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,870
I didn't kill anyone.

102
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,190
Sir Hu, we found it just as expected.

103
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,000
It was hidden very well in the cellar.

104
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,830
The evidence is conclusive.

105
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,800
Do you have anything else to say?

106
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,430
Sir,

107
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,120
How does that saying go again?

108
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,600
Right.

109
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,920
Pick the flower while it is in bloom.

110
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,240
This peony,

111
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,270
I was the one who picked it.

112
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,600
Peony

113
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:05,950
In this lifetime,

114
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,120
I've had enough.

115
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,310
I've had enough.

116
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,720
You beast!

117
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:12,630
I'll beat you to death!

118
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,240
Take this animal away.

119
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,560
I will avenge Peony.

120
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,120
Stop!

121
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:20,360
Let's go.

122
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,600
Everyone else, withdraw for now.

123
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:27,950
Yes.

124
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,680
Wait.

125
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,600
Your behavior earlier was suspicious.

126
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,630
Sir,

127
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,750
I suggest we immediately escort this person back to the Dali Court.

128
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:39,750
And interrogate him strictly.

129
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,800
Young man,

130
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,430
your skill in solving cases by scent

131
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,120
is truly eye-opening.

132
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:50,750
We still have to thank you for your great help.

133
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,190
Sir, your nose

134
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,390
is also very sensitive—no, no, no,

135
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,830
I, I, I...

136
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,720
My nose isn't that good.

137
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,390
I just...

138
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,480
I, I was just guessing.

139
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,120
Is this ability of yours innate

140
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,720
or learned?

141
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,430
Jianxing, don't be afraid.

142
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,560
Mother is here.

143
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,070
No matter what you hear in a moment,

144
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,390
or what you see,

145
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,560
you must not make a sound.

146
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,720
You must hide well.

147
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,390
Go quickly, hurry!

148
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,360
By the way,

149
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,480
I haven't formally introduced myself.

150
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,550
I am Hu Zhengyi, Minister of the Dali Court.

151
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,550
How should I address you, brother?

152
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,150
My surname is Li, given name Jianxing.

153
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,790
Brother Jianxing,

154
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,270
where are you from?

155
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,150
Lingzhou.

156
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,480
That's a nice place.

157
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,840
As I mentioned before,

158
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,000
you came here seeking revenge.

159
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,080
May I ask who your enemy is?

160
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,750
The one I'm looking for is

161
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:34,120
Hu Zhengyi, Minister of the Dali Court.
