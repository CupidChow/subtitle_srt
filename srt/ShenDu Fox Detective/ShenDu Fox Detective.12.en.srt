1
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,560
The people involved

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,560
Should be executed if necessary, investigated if necessary

3
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,840
Even if this person holds a high position

4
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,710
What have you found out?

5
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,350
There is still no concrete evidence

6
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,920
I dare not say

7
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,640
Why are you being so secretive, Minister Hu?

8
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,920
If you have any suspicions

9
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,120
Feel free to speak

10
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,590
Even if a member of the royal family breaks the law

11
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,070
They will be punished according to the law all the same

12
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,000
Your Majesty is overthinking

13
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,230
It has nothing to do with anyone in the court

14
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,230
It's some petty criminals from the underworld

15
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,120
They even dare to compare themselves to the legendary rulers

16
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,350
In my opinion

17
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,790
This case may be related to them

18
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:01,070
I will root them out completely

19
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,870
Even if they are just insignificant rabble

20
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,760
They still dare to plot against the state

21
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,920
You must find evidence as soon as possible

22
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,760
The three-day deadline is up

23
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:14,070
You have only caught the low-level henchmen

24
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,640
But if the mastermind is not eliminated

25
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,710
I'm afraid in the future

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,400
Similar incidents will happen again

27
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,430
I will obey your order

28
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:30,430
Drink it

29
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,590
Thank you, Your Majesty

30
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,120
Be gentle

31
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,710
Is there anything you want to confess on your own?

32
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,560
I'll confess after you make your move.

33
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,240
You'll regret it.

34
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,470
Come here.

35
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,680
The leader of the Blood God Sect isn't the mastermind behind the Phoenix case.

36
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,750
There's someone else behind him.

37
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,750
That's right, keep talking.

38
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,560
Go on.

39
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,030
I can't say anymore.

40
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,630
I was just about to ask who the real culprit is.

41
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:28,960
And then you showed up.

42
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,400
But I can sense that person.

43
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,150
They must be closely connected to the court.

44
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,710
Now you're bringing up the court?

45
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,080
Jianxing, can you stop talking nonsense?

46
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,080
Behind the Blood God Sect,

47
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,750
isn't it you?

48
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,840
So that's your guess?

49
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,280
It's a fact.

50
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,750
The evidence is solid—I saw it with my own eyes.

51
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,470
No, Zeng Sheng.

52
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,400
Use your pig brain and think carefully.

53
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,520
Can you do that?

54
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,430
If he were my subordinate,

55
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,680
why would I interrogate him?

56
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,360
How would I know why you're putting on an act?

57
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,520
Speak.

58
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,870
Why did you sneak into the Dali Temple?

59
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,280
Don't be so loud.

60
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,000
Wasn't it Lord Hu who invited me here?

61
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,520
Weren't you there that day?

62
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:10,840
So you're not going to talk?

63
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,840
Not telling.

64
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,870
Then I'll have to use force.

65
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,470
Do as you wish.

66
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,910
Li Jianxing.

67
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,360
This is the Dali Temple dungeon.

68
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,750
It's not a place for you to act recklessly.

69
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,830
I'd like to see

70
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,070
what you're relying on.

71
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:35,950
Wait.

72
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,560
Sir, sir!

73
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:44,750
Zeng Sheng.

74
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,070
You go out first.

75
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:46,800
Sir.

76
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,560
Please give me a little more time.

77
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,750
I'll get him to talk soon.

78
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,630
How? By what means?

79
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,240
By forcing a confession through torture?

80
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:55,600
Sir, leave.

81
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,040
Sir, although this kid took an injury for you,

82
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,560
it could be a ruse.

83
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,830
Are you going to disobey my order?

84
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,830
I wouldn't dare.

85
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,560
Jianxing.

86
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,870
I remember when we first met,

87
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,190
I told you then

88
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,950
that you came to Luoyang looking for trouble.

89
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,390
Technically, this is your personal business.

90
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,720
I shouldn't pry.

91
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,240
But now,

92
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,920
I have to ask you again.

93
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,510
What exactly is this trouble?

94
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,240
I told you,

95
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,560
it's just a minor issue in the martial world.

96
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:09,950
You're investigating the massacre from twelve years ago.

97
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,360
That's no small matter.

98
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:16,750
The massacre?

99
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,360
I don't know what you're talking about.

100
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,430
Don't you want to know?

101
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,750
How did I figure it out?

102
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,190
Sir, you’re mistaken.

103
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,870
You agreed to come to the Dali Temple

104
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:40,240
because of the Phoenix case.

105
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:41,720
At that time, I thought

106
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,480
you were investigating something.

107
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,750
As for the Phoenix case,

108
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,040
there are only two leads.

109
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,310
The Phoenix and the Blood Poison.

110
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:58,120
I once tested you with the Flaming Parrot case,

111
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,600
but you didn’t seem interested.

112
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,160
But it was different with the Blood Poison.

113
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:07,040
Especially after we discovered the Blood God Sect,

114
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:09,720
you started acting on your own more often.

115
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,800
Speak.

116
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:16,160
What is your relationship

117
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,040
with General Li Zuo’s household?

118
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,120
Impressive.

119
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,830
Sir, your insight is truly sharp.

120
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,800
Since you’ve already guessed it,

121
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,160
I can only tell you the truth.

122
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,510
My father

123
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:34,430
was actually an old friend

124
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,040
of General Li Zuo.

125
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,160
Until his death,

126
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:45,680
my father believed General Li Zuo was murdered by traitors.

127
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,920
On his deathbed, he told me

128
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,680
to seek justice for

129
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,920
General Li, who was brutally killed back then,

130
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,190
and his family.

131
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,950
To uncover the truth,

132
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,270
and catch the culprit.

133
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,120
When I first arrived in Luoyang,

134
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,920
General Li took great care of me.

135
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,830
He was a good man.

136
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,120
He was also my benefactor.

137
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,000
So you have such a connection, sir.

138
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,830
That unsolved case

139
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,190
All these years

140
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,190
I've had the Court of Justice investigating it

141
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,800
On this point

142
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,040
You and I share the same goal

143
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:38,630
What is it

144
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,390
You don't trust me?

145
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,630
Of course I trust you

146
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,790
Since you've said so

147
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,630
Let me help you

148
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:56,630
Let's solve the mystery from back then together

149
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:14,870
Let's go

150
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,120
Go in

151
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,320
What you said to Hu Zhengyi

152
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:40,750
I heard it all

153
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:41,960
Master

154
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,720
Eavesdropping like this isn't a good habit

155
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,670
I didn't expect General Li

156
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,960
And your friends here

157
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,240
After all this time

158
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,320
You still haven't forgotten him

159
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,150
As long as the real culprit isn't caught

160
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,790
We won't forget for a single day

161
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,030
Since you've already heard

162
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,440
My conversation with Lord Hu

163
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,790
You should be very clear

164
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,360
We've reached an agreement

165
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,320
So I'll be out soon

166
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,320
Master

167
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:09,960
As long as you tell me

168
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,000
Who is behind all this

169
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,270
Once I'm out

170
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,870
I might consider helping you

171
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,390
Plead for you and spare your life

172
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,320
Whether you live or die

173
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,440
I'm afraid that's not up to you

174
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,750
I didn't even ask you about the Blood Phoenix incident.

175
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,600
Besides, that case from back then

176
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,440
was settled a long time ago.

177
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,550
Even if you tell me,

178
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,320
I can't expose it anyway.

179
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,320
Isn't that right?

180
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:54,960
Fine.

181
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:57,870
I'll talk.

182
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,270
I'll tell you everything I know.

183
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,080
Shut up.

184
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,790
No talking.

185
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,030
You're still so arrogant even in the dungeon.

186
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,240
If you dare say another word,

187
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:09,790
you'll get the whip.

188
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,080
Hey, Fatty, why are you out here?

189
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,120
I can't.
