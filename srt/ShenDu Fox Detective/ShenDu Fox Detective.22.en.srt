1
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,590
It's you.

2
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,350
Why are you here again?

3
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,040
It is said that Xu Qiyan, by chance,

4
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,430
came across a book called "The Resurrection Chronicle."

5
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,120
The book says

6
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,400
he must marry five women with different destinies

7
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,000
and hold a wedding ceremony with each of them

8
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,680
to bring someone back to life.

9
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,000
Does everyone know who that person is?

10
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:56,120
Of course, it's his beloved wife Yun Yin.

11
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,640
So,

12
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,920
he became ruthless

13
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,310
and took the lives of six people.

14
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,280
Six people!

15
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,710
If you want to know what happens next,

16
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,640
stay tuned for the next episode.

17
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:14,000
Alright, alright, alright.

18
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,870
A man as deeply devoted as Young Master Xu

19
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:17,800
is rare these days.

20
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,240
Is it worth it for an actress?

21
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,800
Since ancient times,

22
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,080
women have always been trouble.

23
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,190
With such a big family business,

24
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,120
the Xu family might lose everything this time.

25
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,190
Exactly.

26
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,800
But Madam Yun Yin didn't do anything wrong.

27
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,430
How is she the source of trouble?

28
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,470
What do you know?

29
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,870
If it weren't for her,

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,030
would Young Master Xu have killed anyone?

31
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,000
But Madam Yun Yin didn't make him do it.

32
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,000
If Xu Qiyan had just married a proper lady,

33
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,590
he wouldn't have ended up like this.

34
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,870
Yes, he's right.

35
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,590
Stop gossiping here.

36
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:45,630
All of you, get lost!

37
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,630
This...

38
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,080
Really...

39
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,910
What does it have to do with him?

40
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,470
Zeng Sheng, tell Jianxing to get in the carriage quickly.

41
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,240
Brother Jianxing, hurry and get on the carriage.

42
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,430
The master has been waiting in the carriage for a long time.

43
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,150
I'm coming.

44
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,150
Young master.

45
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,080
Young master, I'm sorry.

46
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,080
I didn't expect it either.

47
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,000
That Young Master Qiyan would do such a thing.

48
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,680
When Miss Song wakes up,

49
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,190
please convey my apologies to her.

50
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:22,910
Alright.

51
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,080
Qiao'er.

52
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,310
Don't blame yourself too much.

53
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,680
What are your plans after this?

54
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,310
Madam Xu has always treated me well.

55
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,150
Now that the young master has passed away,

56
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,190
and such misfortune has befallen the Xu family,

57
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,840
of course I will stay by her side to take care of her.

58
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,030
That's very good.

59
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:40,560
If I get the chance later,

60
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,710
I'll come back to see you.

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,400
You must take good care of yourself.

62
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:45,680
It's getting late.

63
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,000
It's time to set off.

64
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,400
Qiao'er.

65
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,190
Take care of yourself.

66
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,430
Alright.

67
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,190
Young master, you take care too.

68
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm leaving.

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,630
Let's go.

70
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,520
Big chicken drumstick!

71
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,800
It smells so good.

72
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,800
Tiantian.

73
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,750
Why am I here?

74
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,190
You were just drugged.

75
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,680
We rescued you together.

76
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,310
Thank you all.

77
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:40,800
Tiantian.

78
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,480
Zeng Sheng was really worried at the time.

79
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,430
He rushed to the front.

80
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,870
Thank you, Brother Zeng.

81
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,800
Brother Zeng.

82
00:04:59,270 --> 00:04:59,950
Brother Zeng.

83
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,120
What is this?

84
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,800
I remember now.

85
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,240
This was left by Young Master Xu.

86
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,720
He said it's Yun Yin's keepsake.

87
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,830
I made sure to take it before I lost consciousness.

88
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,390
According to Lingzhou's customs,

89
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,190
it's usually something a mother gives to her daughter.

90
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,870
But this looks really familiar.

91
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,120
I'm sorry, Qiao'er.

92
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,430
I didn't mean to break your sachet.

93
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,560
I'll buy you a new one when I get back.

94
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,800
Th-this...

95
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,240
This is a keepsake my mother left me.

96
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,600
No amount of money can buy it.

97
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,240
Mother, mother

98
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,560
Slow down

99
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,560
What's wrong?

100
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,240
Mother

101
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,510
Can you make me one exactly like this?

102
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,040
Whose sachet is this?

103
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,160
It's Qiao'er's

104
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,000
This is a bit difficult

105
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,830
This isn't ordinary embroidery

106
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:15,720
Look

107
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,430
The stitching technique is extremely intricate

108
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,950
It's very challenging

109
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,480
It's not just that I can't embroider it

110
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,630
I'm afraid that in our whole Lingzhou City

111
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,750
there isn't a single embroiderer who could do it

112
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,560
Qiao'er is so kind

113
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,920
It must just be a coincidence

114
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,360
That's strange

115
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,310
What's wrong?

116
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,480
Earlier, when I was talking with Xu Qiyan

117
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,480
I asked him

118
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,680
how his previous brides died

119
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,800
He firmly believes

120
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,000
that those people

121
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,680
were all killed by Yun Yin's spirit

122
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,870
And he is convinced

123
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:54,390
that Yun Yin is connected to him in spirit

124
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,480
and came back out of jealousy to kill his new brides

125
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:04,190
If he really killed those brides himself

126
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,870
then why would he say that?

127
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,000
Stop the carriage

128
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,950
I need to go back

129
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,950
Miss Qiao'er, I'm here to return the key

130
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:41,430
Coming

131
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:43,830
Thank you

132
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,000
You're welcome

133
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,270
No one has moved the position of the candle.

134
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,120
I sat here.

135
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,550
The shadow couldn't even reach halfway up the window.

136
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,360
Given the bride's height,

137
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,750
her shadow

138
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,600
should be much shorter than mine.

139
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,240
She left.

140
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,240
But the shadow I saw that day

141
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,670
almost reached the middle of the window.

142
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:59,870
That means

143
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,960
the person sitting here that day wasn't Liu.

144
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,840
But if it wasn't Liu,

145
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,750
who else could it have been?

146
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,630
It was white paper scraps.

147
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,200
It was a paper figure.

148
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,030
The "Liu" I saw at that time was actually a paper figure.

149
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,120
If what was placed here was a paper figure,

150
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,670
then Qiao'er is lying.

151
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,840
When you were attending to Liu in the bridal chamber,

152
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,240
did you notice anything strange about her?

153
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,440
Our young master has always been acting strangely.

154
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,150
The bride was frightened.

155
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:49,480
Madam.

156
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:51,550
Madam.

157
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,440
After Xu Qiyan left,

158
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,670
Liu was probably drugged.

159
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,600
She fell into a deep sleep.

160
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,910
And as for Qiao'er,

161
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,440
after tidying up Liu's clothes and jewelry,

162
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:41,000
she must have taken Liu to the stage.

163
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,270
Even if Qiao'er carried her to the stage,

164
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:19,080
she's not much taller or stronger than the bride.

165
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,360
How did she get the bride up onto the beam?
