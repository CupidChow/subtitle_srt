1
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,000
Madam, the guests have arrived.

2
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,600
Honored guests, please come in.

3
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,590
Madam, quickly.

4
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:15,430
Please have a seat.

5
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:15,920
Thank you.

6
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:16,760
Everyone, please sit.

7
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,480
You are just a guard.

8
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,350
How can you overstep and take a seat?

9
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,040
Young Master Hutu,

10
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,040
if you find the food delicious,

11
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,040
please feel free to eat more.

12
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,000
Thank you, Madam, for your hospitality.

13
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,120
Come, everyone, raise your glasses and drink together.

14
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:57,840
Alright.

15
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,070
Thank you, please.

16
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,310
Please.

17
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,790
Madam, why didn't your son come?

18
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,950
He isn't feeling well.

19
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,510
Tonight, I will host everyone myself.

20
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,840
Young Master Xu is truly blessed.

21
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,910
I heard the bride

22
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,360
is as beautiful as a flower and the moon.

23
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,470
Just now, I calculated

24
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,630
Madam Xu's children’s fortune

25
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:30,030
shows auspicious signs this year.

26
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,710
I believe within half a year,

27
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,000
there will be good news.

28
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,750
Then I’ll borrow your auspicious words.

29
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,430
Everyone, please eat.

30
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,560
Don’t be shy.

31
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,630
No need to be polite.

32
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,470
Please.

33
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,680
Why are you so jealous, Master?

34
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,590
Are you from Shanxi, by any chance?

35
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,590
That's right, that's right.

36
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,590
I'm from Bingzhou, Shanxi.

37
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,910
We're from the same place!

38
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,520
I've been traveling the world since I left the mountains.

39
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,800
I really didn't expect this.

40
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,030
To meet a fellow townsman here in Lingzhou today.

41
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,710
It's fate, truly fate.

42
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:25,430
Please.

43
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,910
This is good wine.

44
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,280
I've heard that the incense at Jinyang in Bingzhou is very prosperous.

45
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,750
Have you ever thought about returning to Bingzhou to develop your career?

46
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,000
For someone like me,

47
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,750
just being a wine-and-meat Taoist,

48
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,560
living a carefree life,

49
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,590
why would I need to go back home?

50
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,080
That makes sense.

51
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,630
Please, please.

52
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,030
Please.

53
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:21,710
Come, come.

54
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:23,520
What's wrong?

55
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,840
No need to trouble yourself, young hero.

56
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:25,950
Take your time and enjoy your food.

57
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,390
I'm going to get some fresh air.

58
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,600
You all take your time eating.

59
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,600
Lailai, I'll go with you.

60
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,160
Don't follow me.

61
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:42,750
Uh...

62
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,120
Keep eating, keep eating.

63
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,240
Come on, let's drink.

64
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,270
I have a son and a daughter.

65
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,040
I haven't disciplined them enough.

66
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,240
I'm ashamed, truly ashamed.

67
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,950
Very good, very good.

68
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:57,630
Let's drink.

69
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,120
Young Master Hu, please.

70
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,070
You drink so fast!

71
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,240
Well, well, Li Jianxing.

72
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,600
You're such a playboy.

73
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,390
You've only known that girl for a few days.

74
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,000
And you're already flirting with her.

75
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,600
Why not make it a double celebration?

76
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,190
You two might as well get married.

77
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,800
Dusk falls.

78
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,240
A flute plays on a boat at night.

79
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,870
Who's singing opera?

80
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,510
Who's singing opera this late?

81
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:35,600
A haunting dream lingers in my heart.

82
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:41,600
Yun Yin.

83
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,800
Yun Yin.

84
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:50,800
Sorry.

85
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,240
It's too late at night.

86
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,950
I mistook you for someone else.

87
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,630
You, you are...

88
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,560
I'm Xu Qiyan.

89
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,870
Oh, so it's Young Master Xu.

90
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,390
I didn't mean to intrude.

91
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,510
I'm Hu Lailai.

92
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,190
Just now, when I was over there,

93
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,510
I heard someone singing opera.

94
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,830
So I came over to take a look.

95
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,750
Do you also like listening to opera?

96
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,870
Um,

97
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,190
I'll be leaving now.

98
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,120
Wait.

99
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,390
Miss Lai Lai,

100
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,390
Let me walk you out.

101
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,720
May I ask for your birth date and time?

102
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,430
You're joking, Young Master Xu.

103
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,510
Who asks a lady's birth date and time upon first meeting?

104
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,950
I'll just head back by myself.

105
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,160
Yun Yin,

106
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,190
you'll be able to return soon.

107
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:05,870
Very soon.

108
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,390
Honored guests, please remain seated.

109
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,430
I'm feeling a bit tired.

110
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,920
I still have to arrange the wedding tomorrow morning.

111
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,270
I'll excuse myself for now.

112
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,270
Alright, alright.

113
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,600
Thank you, Madam.

114
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,560
Please, carry on.

115
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,870
We, we...

116
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,040
Let's have a few more drinks, with my fellow townsman.

117
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:29,920
Yes, yes, yes.

118
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,600
Alright, alright, alright.

119
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,430
Please, have a seat.

120
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,040
Come.

121
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,270
Take care, Madam.

122
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,000
Come on.

123
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,270
Let's finish this cup.

124
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,920
Fill it up, fill it up.

125
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,950
Yes, yes, yes.

126
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:42,270
With a true friend, a thousand cups aren't enough.

127
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,310
Son, come here.

128
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,360
Toast your uncle, come on.

129
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,630
Let's do it together.

130
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,160
Come on, come on.

131
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,070
Come.

132
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,430
Together.

133
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,070
Let's clink glasses, let's clink glasses.

134
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:57,950
Have a seat.

135
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,270
Fellow townsman,

136
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,680
do you all still not know

137
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:10,070
what happened here in the past?

138
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,160
We just arrived in Lingzhou.

139
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,310
As for the truth behind it,

140
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,750
we really don't know.

141
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:23,070
We hope you can enlighten us.

142
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,510
Actually, this place

143
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,190
is haunted.

144
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,040
Are you talking about

145
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,310
the vengeful spirits from the General's residence twelve years ago?

146
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,950
On our way to Lingzhou,

147
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,750
we heard quite a few stories like that.

148
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,680
You only know part of it,

149
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,720
but not the whole story.

150
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:47,630
Speaking of the eldest son of the Xu family, Xu Qiyan,

151
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,600
in his early years,

152
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,750
he actually married a beloved wife.

153
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,000
Her name was Yun Yin.

154
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:02,390
After marriage, the two were very much in love.

155
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,630
But for some unknown reason,

156
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,360
In less than a year

157
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,750
that woman named Yun Yin

158
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,320
suddenly passed away

159
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,870
So, Master, you mean

160
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,600
the vengeful spirit from the General's Manor killed Yun Yin?

161
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,960
If you analyze it that way

162
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,240
it doesn't make sense logically

163
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,720
Think about it

164
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,960
the massacre at the General's Manor

165
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,270
happened more than ten years ago

166
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:38,200
if a vengeful spirit really did appear

167
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,510
why was everything peaceful for so many years

168
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,790
and only in the past two years

169
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,910
did it suddenly show up

170
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,200
to harm

171
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,870
a woman who had nothing to do with it?

172
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,840
To find out the truth

173
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,240
I used my spiritual eye

174
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,910
and took a look at that ghost

175
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,240
As a result

176
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,670
guess what happened

177
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,720
What happened?

178
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,150
Later on

179
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,720
I saw that vengeful spirit

180
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,870
actually

181
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,120
it was a female ghost

182
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,270
and the time of her death

183
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:36,390
was only three to five years ago

184
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,120
So you mean

185
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:46,390
the ghost haunting the Xu residence is Yun Yin?

186
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,200
If Xu Qiyan and Yun Yin were truly in love

187
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,670
and she died of illness under his care

188
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,150
Master, let me ask you

189
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,910
