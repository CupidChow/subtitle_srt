1
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,560
You startled me.

2
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,120
A dignified Minister of the Court of Judicial Review,

3
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,200
doing something so sneaky.

4
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,280
Aren't you doing the same?

5
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:46,680
Did you find anything?

6
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,400
Let me check.

7
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,840
Food

8
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:28,800
Rouge

9
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,000
Candles

10
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,280
Wine

11
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,560
How is it?

12
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,120
There's no foul smell.

13
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,910
Even if the room was cleaned, that smell

14
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,870
With my nose

15
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,400
I would still be able to smell it.

16
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,800
It's unlikely it happened in this house.

17
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,630
After being hanged

18
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,560
then moved to the stage.

19
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,400
You didn't smell anything else?

20
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,840
They're all scents that should be in this house.

21
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,400
Nothing unusual.

22
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,280
Let's go take a look outside.

23
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,000
This bridal room isn't far from the stage.

24
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,520
Logically,

25
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,520
if Lady Liu committed suicide, she would have prepared a stool herself.

26
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,190
However,

27
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,590
this old stool

28
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,400
doesn't really seem like something from the bridal room.

29
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,870
There are only chairs with backrests in the bridal room.

30
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,630
They're not easy to move.

31
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,520
And not suitable for hanging oneself.

32
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,360
According to Qiao'er,

33
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,280
the bride shouldn't have left the bridal room.

34
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,630
Then this stool

35
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,840
could it be

36
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:21,560
the murderer brought it from elsewhere

37
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,400
to fake the suicide scene?

38
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,310
A couple of days ago,

39
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,160
the bride died on the stage.

40
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,680
It was terrifying.

41
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,390
I haven't slept well these past two days.

42
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:41,920
Me too.

43
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,560
I'm thinking about leaving the manor.

44
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,040
I've been having nightmares every day.

45
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:45,870
Sisters,

46
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,270
I'm busy.

47
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,750
Have a seat.

48
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,120
Alright.

49
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:52,720
Well...

50
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,070
Brother, I want to ask you something.

51
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,360
About stools like this one,

52
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,560
are there many of them in our residence?

53
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,920
Stools like this,

54
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,070
there are many exactly like this in the residence.

55
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,720
Anyone could take one out to sit for a while.

56
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,600
To enjoy the sun.

57
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,240
So, last night,

58
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,480
in this kitchen,

59
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,830
how many people were there in total?

60
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,430
Last night, it was just me, Zhen'er, and Lian'er.

61
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,240
The cooks had all gone back to rest.

62
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,870
Did anyone else come by to help out?

63
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,630
Everyone was really busy last night.

64
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,680
There was a lot of work.

65
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,950
I didn't really pay attention.

66
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,120
Oh right, Qiao'er came by.

67
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,920
That's right, I would have forgotten if you hadn't mentioned it.

68
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,630
Qiao'er is a favorite of the old madam.

69
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,630
Yesterday was really unusual.

70
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,630
Ran to the kitchen

71
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,510
To help out in a place where rough people like us work

72
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,870
Sister Qiao'er meant well

73
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,040
Meant well

74
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,480
We don't even know what she's really thinking

75
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,480
She used to live a good life

76
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,800
She has high ambitions

77
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,720
She's always sticking close to the madam

78
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,360
Or sticking close to Young Master Qiyan

79
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,190
Maybe she killed someone just to climb up in status

80
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,070
Don't talk nonsense

81
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,190
Zhen'er

82
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,390
You're just a servant girl

83
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,680
Why are you speaking up for her?

84
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:56,240
I...

85
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,240
Do you really think siding with her will help you rise up?

86
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,720
I—I didn't

87
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,800
Sisters

88
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,000
Stop arguing

89
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:02,920
There's no need

90
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,000
Have some tea, have some tea

91
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,070
So this Qiao'er

92
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,000
How long did she help out before going back?

93
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,600
At that time, the chef made a lamb pastry

94
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,600
It was only about half an hour

95
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,270
After that, I went back to the bridal room with her

96
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,000
I can testify

97
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,720
Sister Qiao'er didn't do anything

98
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,480
When you went back to the bridal room with her

99
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,070
Did you bring a stool?

100
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,560
We were both carrying dishes at the time

101
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,720
And when we saw the body

102
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,310
The stool was already at the bride's feet

103
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,270
Have some tea, have some tea

104
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,480
If what she said is true,

105
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,240
Qiao'er was in the kitchen for half an hour.

106
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,480
That means

107
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,680
after Tiantian and I delivered the key,

108
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,240
Qiao'er was in the bridal room

109
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,920
for less than a quarter of an hour

110
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,040
before she went to the kitchen.

111
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:01,240
That short amount of time wasn't enough for her to commit the crime

112
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,270
and then move the body to the stage.

113
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:11,040
If the bride dies within three days of the wedding,

114
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,120
no matter the reason,

115
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,070
it must not be reported to the authorities.

116
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,800
The killer must be among these few people.

117
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,120
Who could it be?

118
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,270
There's actually no dust on this beam.

119
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,630
The scent of gardenias.

120
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,830
It's the fragrance of rouge from the bridal chamber.

121
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,000
The bride clearly hanged herself under the beam.

122
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,600
So how did the scent of rouge end up on the beam?

123
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:20,800
Did she climb up onto the beam?

124
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,190
It seems the killer put the unconscious bride

125
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,920
with a rope around her neck

126
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,870
and laid her flat on the beam.

127
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,120
If the bride turned even a little,

128
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,510
she would lose her balance and fall off the beam.

129
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,750
That would create the effect of hanging.

130
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,600
That makes sense.

131
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,960
It's like a timed killing device.

132
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,480
Doing this

133
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,910
was to give himself an alibi.

134
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,150
But that doesn't add up.

135
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,480
The beam is so high.

136
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,320
How did the killer get the unconscious bride

137
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,360
up there?

138
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,870
Unless

139
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,320
he knows martial arts.

140
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,270
Not necessarily.

141
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,750
Couldn't he just use a ladder?

142
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,870
Why are you running around everywhere?

143
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,670
Aren't you always jumping up and down too?

144
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,870
You seem pretty familiar with this place.

145
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,750
Same to you. Give me a hand.

146
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:28,720
Hold on tight.

147
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:42,790
The killer stood on the beam using a ladder.

148
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,440
Although Madam Liu is petite,

149
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,000
it would still be hard for a woman to lift her.

150
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,440
Old Madam Xu definitely couldn't lift her.

151
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,200
Even the maids in the household would struggle.

152
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,630
Xu Qiyan and the steward were in the front hall the whole time.

153
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,320
The cook was always in the kitchen.

154
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,870
They didn't have time to commit the crime either.

155
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,960
So the biggest suspect

156
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,720
is that Xiaoyaozi.

157
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,630
He wasn't at the banquet at all last night.

158
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,480
And he does have a motive.

159
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,510
Because only if people keep dying

160
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,550
can he keep making money.

161
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,480
So,

162
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,630
while he's staying in Lingzhou,

163
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,440
he's been hanging around the Xu residence.

164
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,030
I'm going to have a good talk with Xiaoyaozi right now.

165
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,870
Murder! Murder!

166
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,840
Quick, put the ladder away!

167
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,000
Hurry, go!

168
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,080
The body is still warm.

169
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,510
She must have died just recently.

170
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,870
Did you find any clues?

171
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,080
I've already searched the area.

172
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,790
I didn't find anyone suspicious.

173
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,390
Even the master is dead.

174
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,360
This vengeful spirit is too powerful.

175
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,790
Silence! Step back.

176
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,440
Even the master is dead.

177
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,910
Could it be that in this residence

178
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,030
there really is a vengeful spirit at work?

179
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,120
Madam, don't worry.

180
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,510
Tomorrow, I'll find

181
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,480
an even more skilled Taoist priest to perform a ritual.

182
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,360
Where is Hu Lailei?

183
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,270
I didn't see him either.

184
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,910
What's going on?

185
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,240
Someone died again.

186
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,080
In the middle of the night...

187
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,390
Why are you with him?

188
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,790
I just got lost.

189
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,360
Thanks to Young Master Xu,

190
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,790
I was able to find my way back.

191
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,790
Tiantian, you...

192
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,120
Tian—Tian what mess?

193
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,840
Come, Lailei.

194
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,320
Come on.

195
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,750
The victim's skull is fractured.

196
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,550
He must have suffered a severe blow before death.

197
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,750
He was beaten to death.

198
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,550
From the looks of it,

199
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,630
the vengeful spirit is just a cover.

200
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,080
The real murderer

201
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,750
is right here in this courtyard.

202
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,670
Who could it be?
