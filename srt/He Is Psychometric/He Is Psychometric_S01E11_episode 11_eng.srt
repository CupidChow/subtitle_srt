1
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:04,780
 He is Psychometric 

2
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:13,510


3
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,110
 He is Psychometric 

4
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,990
Where am I?

5
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:36,490
That's right, that person...

6
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:41,510
 I was just about to go back after waiting. 

7
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:45,240
 What? Me? 

8
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,100
  Wait a moment.  

9
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,750
  This person, why me... 

10
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,420
  That’s right,  I’m sure he could make handcuffs too with these skills  

11
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,670
  Do you live here?  

12
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:24,770
 Yes, I’m a police officer working at the Community Security Center. 

13
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,750
  I'm sure he looks familiar.  

14
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,740
 Where have I see him before? 

15
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,300
  Just where have I see him? 

16
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:45,920
  Dad, I am sleepy.  

17
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,820
  Sleep some more.  

18
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,280
  You... 

19
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:11,770
 Psychometry: An ability to measure and interpret the essence or history of a person or thing through touch.

00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:14,090
 He is Psychometric
 - Episode 11 - 

21
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,530
Jae In, where are you?

22
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:29,310
  The person you are trying to call is not available,  
 you will be forwarded to the mailbox. 

23
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,990
It’s been a while, Kang Seong Mo.

24
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,530
I wanted to talk to you when I heard your voice.

25
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:40,380
I guess I was one step behind. What about Eun Joo? Did you find her?

26
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:46,200
What are you planning now? Will you hide her away from me again?

27
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,050
Just in case you were thinking that way,

28
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:52,330
I brought someone with me too.

29
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,040
If you take away my woman,

30
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,900
it seems only fair that I take away your woman too.

31
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:09,250
Ah, maybe it is not fair.

32
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,550
You can't kill my woman but

33
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,930
I can kill

34
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,000
your woman.

35
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,640
What do you think? Have you figured it out?

36
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,700
This is the reason why I brought you here.

37
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,580
I remember your face.

38
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:48,690
You took my dad's clothes.

39
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:02,200
Its you! The person who stabbed Ahn.

40
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,680
The person that has been watching Prosecutor Kang for a long time,

41
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:09,400
You were the culprit.

42
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:17,000
  New voice message 
  Press the call button to listen 

43
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,990
Is that important now?

44
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,860
What am I going to do with you?

45
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,830
I think that's more important right now.

46
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,800
I can't see it.

47
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,230
Why the hell are you doing this?

48
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:02,640
Do you know the story of the little prince?

49
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,200
On a small star,

50
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,100
where he grew a rose on his own,

51
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,080
the story of The Little Prince.

52
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,700
What are you trying to say?

53
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,880
How about we change the story?

54
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,750
Into a story where the flower that he preciously grew

55
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:32,380
gets plucked.

56
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,140
Could it have been a beautiful fairytale?

57
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:46,280
If it was you, what would you do?

58
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:58,730
 The feeling of losing something that is very precious. 

59
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,930
 Kang Seong Mo, too. 

60
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,970
Ah, the things that are precious to Kang Seong Mo...

61
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:20,290
It's not just one now.

62
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:24,050
His little brother Lee Ahn, Detective Eun Ji Soo too...

63
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:28,130
and you...

64
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:33,650
The things that Kang Seong Mo wants to protect 
 have become quite a lot.

65
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:38,610
That woman is still the only one for me.

66
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,720
That woman?

67
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:48,680
You don't seem to know anything yet.

68
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,560
If you knew who that woman was,

69
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,420
you would understand my actions a bit easier.

70
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,400
Never.

71
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:03,320
It will not work the way you think.

72
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:27,280
Look for any clues. Understood?

73
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,890
Yes.

74
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,720
- Yes, Detective Eun. 
 - Detective Lee, listen to me clearly.

75
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:40,430
Use all the troops you need to find Constable Yoon. I'll take the responsibility for it.

76
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:41,400
Yes, I understand.

77
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,180
And do you remember the guy who discovered the carrier first in the stream?

78
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,790
Do you mean your little brother?

79
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:50,710
- Yes. If there's any place he wants to search, listen to me. 
 - What?

80
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:55,450
If Officer Yoon is kidnapped, there's no one who will be able to find her better than him.

81
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,530
- So no matter, what... 
  - Hello? Detective Eun? 

82
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:58,910
- Hello? 
  - Detective Eun. 

83
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,280
 Secret Agent 

84
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,940
This is driving me crazy.

85
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,800
Jae In.

86
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,110
- Has the kidnapper's face been captured yet? 
 - Not yet.

87
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,980
Jae In, what will happen to our Jae In?

88
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:19,660
Control Center. I have called you two days ago to set up another surveillance camera in front of the Community Security Center. 
 What happened?

89
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,560
 Just a moment. 

90
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,610
What happened to the surveillance camera in front of the 
 Community Security Center?

91
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:28,920
Ah that, the prosecutor who came in yesterday asked for more and told me to set it up urgently.

92
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,880
  Yes it's set up, what is the problem? 

93
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,850
About two hours ago, there was a kidnapping in front of the Community Security Center.

94
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:37,900
Please contact me as soon as you confirmed the suspect's face.

95
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,720
Here, let's see.

96
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,200
Here, here and here are the roads that lead to places without surveillance cameras.

97
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,490
Please block them all and tell them to search every passing vehicle.

98
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,410
- When did this— 
 - Please move quickly.

99
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,560
Yes, I understand.

100
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,620
Our Jae In is fine, right? She'll be fine, right?

101
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:02,080
Of course she is safe.
 I'm not going to let this kid be kidnapped in my area.

102
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,140
I'll see you when I get back.

103
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:09,350
Please find where our Jae In is.

104
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:13,230
Jae In.

What is this? He must be drunk. Let's go.

I'm not going to die.

126
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:47,600
So...

127
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,060
Please show me something Jae In.

128
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,560
Hey punk, what do you know to be here?

129
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,000
You mainly tried searching the roads that were marked on the map, right?

130
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,810
I've sent around the map of the security cameras to the police.

131
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:04,400
I also told them to check empty houses and stores. So go back and wait.

132
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:09,030
I'll search this way. Lieutenant Nam, please go that way.

133
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,030
Lee Ahn!

134
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,800
I have to look!

135
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,890
Jae In will have left me traces of herself.

136
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:18,600
If there's something like that, the police will find it.

137
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,220
No. It's something

138
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:24,340
only I can see.

139
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,730
♫  And I will come again  ♫

140
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,940
♫  Shadows in hold  ♫

141
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,790
♫  I'll do it all again  ♫

142
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,480
  Inspection Checkpoint  

143
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,910
Just a moment. We have an inspection checkpoint.

144
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,570
Is there something wrong?

145
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:48,650
There's been a kidnapping the area. I ask for your cooperation.

146
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:50,800
Please show me your ID.

147
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,800
 Kim Yeong Ho 

148
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,370
Do an identity check. Please open your trunk.

149
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,660
Detective Lee, we've checked his ID.

150
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,830
What are you doing? Please open the trunk.

151
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,200
Thank you for your cooperation.

152
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,500
 Photo of the suspect has been acquired. 

153
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,660
Okay. Send him off.

154
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,020
Yes. Thank you.

155
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,530
With this low resolution...

156
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,320
Get that car!

157
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,730
 Where are you taking me? 

158
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:59,910
  Ahn. Lee Ahn. 

159
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,190
  Abandoned factory  

160
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,280
Jae In! Jae In.

161
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,810
 No Tresspassing 

162
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,630
Jae In!

163
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,250
 Ahn. Lee Ahn.  

164
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,700
She’s here.

165
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:23,280
Yoon Jae In. Jae In!

166
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,080
Jae In!

167
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,080
Jae In!

168
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,440
No! Please, no!

169
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,190
Jae In, come to your senses, Yoon Jae In.

170
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:30,330
Jae In. Yoon Jae In!

171
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:53,550
  Hey, there's something I want to run and tell him, 

172
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,600
 but telling him that 

173
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,510
 doesn't change that Ahn's parents passed away. 

174
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:04,330
 Revealing that my dad isn't a murderer 

175
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,300
 cures only my wounds. 

176
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,150
  I really want to go to him right now.  

177
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:17,790
 But I can't go. 

178
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:23,370
 Don’t cry. Jae In, don’t cry. 

179
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,560
 Don’t cry. It’s okay. 

180
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,390
I'm sorry for coming late.

181
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:45,780
Please come to your senses.

182
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,960
What about Jae In?

183
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,260
I got a call from Ahn but she is not in a critical condition.

184
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,800
Aigoo! Thank you!

185
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,760
Aigoo. Thank God.

186
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,080
Aigoo. Thank Buddha, thank the ancestors.

187
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,360
- That cra— 
 - What about that crazy bast*rd?

188
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,550
Did you catch Jae In’s kidnapper?

189
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,890
It seems like he left the car and ran away. What should we do—

190
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:28,980
What do you mean? We're all dead to Detective Eun if we don't get this punk.

191
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,240
- Spread out! 
 - Yes.

192
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,400
It's fine since Constable Yoon is safe.

193
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,900
First, order security for Constable Yoon while she's in the hospital,

194
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,580
and we'll talk about losing the guy once I return.

195
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,860
Yes, it was this woman.

196
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:10,510
I talked to the prosecutor who came here yesterday.

197
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:13,500
Kim Song Hee has left the island.

198
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,910
Left? When?

199
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:20,010
December 17th. It was the day she received treatment.

200
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,260
Can you explain in detail what happened that day?

201
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,190
A suicide attempt?

202
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,050
 Yes, fortunately, she was found by villagers 

203
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:58,620
 so there was no harm to her life. 

204
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:02,890
 Anyway, I have to say she appeared unstable. 

205
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:07,250
When people come to an unfamiliar island and commit such a thing, it's obvious what story they have.

206
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:12,340
So just to be sure, I asked her for her name and social security number,

207
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:16,860
but she insisted that she'd just pay the medical expenses and leave.

208
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:20,750
Because she knows that the record of her treatment would reveal her whereabouts.

209
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,900
That's probably why she did so.

210
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:27,650
Anyway, we wrestled for some time like that.

211
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:31,090
Then she showed me her ID card and left right away,

212
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:34,370
leaving a ring on the bed.

213
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:36,120
A ring?

214
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:41,940
 Yes. There was a ring that she always fidgeted with. 

215
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:45,330
 We gave it to the prosecutor that came yesterday. 

216
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:25,960
 December 17th would be that day. 

217
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:30,650
 The day of the briefing of Kim Gab Yong's murder of Kang Hee Sook and Park Soo Young. 

218
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,830
 Why did she try to commit suicide on that day of all days? 

219
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,420
Even when she's alive,

220
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,800
why is she keeping it a secret, even from you?

221
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,550
Just why?

222
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,090
  Seoheun General Hospital 

223
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:10,020
Poor thing.

224
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,620
How scared you must have been.

225
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:15,040
How surprised you must have been.

226
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:23,590
Jae In.

227
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,300
 Jae In! 

228
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:38,720
  Ah, but now there isn't just one person 

229
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,280
  who is precious to Seong Mo.  

230
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:45,460
  For me, that woman is still the only one. 

231
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:50,380
  I think Prosecutor Kang's mother is still alive. 

232
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:54,530
  You miss her too, don't you?  

233
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:56,130
  Your mom.  

234
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:59,910
 The woman who lived as the dead Kang Hee Sook's and Park Soo Young 

235
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:02,920
  was Prosecutor Kang's mother, Kang Eun Joo.  

236
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:12,790
I heard that Jae In survived thanks to you finding her so quickly.

237
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:16,290
Thank you. Thank you so much.

238
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,980
Don’t worry.

239
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,850
Jae In is okay now.

240
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:29,790
I've been saying that on our way here, but she won't listen.

241
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:32,260
You should go home and rest too.

242
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,460
You didn't get a wink of sleep, did you?

243
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:37,660
Auntie, please have a rest.

244
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:40,990
The police are protecting her but still,

245
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:42,990
I want to be by her side.

246
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:45,330
But I should stay with her.

247
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:48,480
Sook Ja, Jae In should eat when she wakes up.

248
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,810
Will she gain strength from hospital food?

249
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:52,450
Do you think so?

250
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:56,610
Before lunch, let's go to the market. I'll prepare abalone and chicken.

251
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:59,420
You just cook with your love.

252
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:03,080
Then if she wakes up, call me.

253
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,850
I hope to hear from you. Soon!

254
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:05,480
Okay.

255
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,860
Do me this favor.

256
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,400
Then.

257
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:38,110


258
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,850
Dad...

259
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:01,870
Dad...

260
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:12,270
 I remember your face. 

261
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:15,690
  You took my dad’s clothes.  

262
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:19,740
  It's you! You're the guy who stabbed Ahn, too, 

263
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:23,350
  and was watching Prosecutor Kang for a long time. 

264
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,020
 You were the culprit. 

265
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:31,350
 It will never work out as you planned. 

266
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:17,290
The constable at the Community Security Center,

267
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:21,770
I saw the article that she was kidnapped and rescued.

268
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:24,700
It seems like that man has appeared.

269
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,470
It really is going according to your predictions.

270
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:33,010
What are you planning to do now?

271
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,550
And how much does Ahn know?

272
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,300
Ahn now is

273
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:51,200
no longer the kid that cried about seeing strange things.

274
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,590
Now that we know that he had kidnapped Constable Yoon,

275
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,520
it will only be a matter of time

276
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,930
until the truth is revealed about

277
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:02,960
who that man is,

278
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:05,420
Also,

279
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:08,860
what else he did.

280
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,710
Seong Mo.

281
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:17,230
There was no one to help you back then, but it's different now.

282
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:19,020
Never

283
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:23,360
make rash decisions on your own.

284
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:31,240
If I think about it now,

285
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,080
even then,

286
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,320
I wasn’t alone.

287
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:44,060
 I don't know what's going on but, leaving wounds like this untreated will get infected. 

288
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:48,410
 Overlooking wounds because they're small could end up killing you. 

289
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:52,590
  If I had asked for help... 

290
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:56,590
  Call me if you need any help. 

291
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,920
 Let’s go. 

292
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:09,250
When I discovered that he had appeared again,

293
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:16,120
if only I had made the phone call...

294
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,020
That day...

295
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:26,240
I endlessly regretted,

296
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:31,030
and regretted again.

297
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:35,610
Once again,

298
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:43,320
I don't want people who try to help me, to get hurt.

299
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,350
I have to

300
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:55,080
find a way.

301
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,610
 We checked and the ID card was a stolen one. 

302
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:05,780
 The car was rented with that stolen ID card as well. 

303
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:06,730
What about fingerprints?

304
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:09,370
We've found some things in the vehicle and sent them to Dr. Hong.

305
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:12,640
I'll meet Officer Yoon as soon as I get back.

306
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,400
Did you find Kang Eun Joo?

307
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:31,410
We've searched all the cameras from bus terminals to train platforms in proximity but no traces of Kang Eun Joo.

308
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:33,270
So you didn't meet Prosecutor Kang?

309
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:35,170
 Everywhere I go, I hear the same thing. 

310
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:39,180
The prosecutor who came yesterday already took a copy of everything.

311
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,780
Somehow chasing after Prosecutor Kang has become my specialty.

312
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:45,390
Do you think it's possible Prosector Kang

313
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:47,180
still doesn't know Kang Eun Joo's whereabouts?

314
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:51,810
That's that. I heard fingerprints were found in the kidnapper's car.

315
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:57,670
As you know, it'll take some time to verify the identity.

316
00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:02,270
Doctor Hong, there's a favor I've been meaning to ask from you.

317
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:05,670
I know. Until we find out for certain,

318
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:09,510
to keep the issue of Kang Seong Mo's mother a secret, right?

319
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:12,050
I knew I could trust you.

320
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:15,540
Detective Eun, be careful.

321
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:19,540
If it's like Prosecutor Kang said, you could also be in danger.

322
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,510
I'll see you when I come back.

323
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:12,930
♫  On somedays when I look into your eyes  ♫

324
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:21,090
♫  Why do I keep seeing through the past?  ♫

325
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:27,340
♫  And I'm falling down with you  ♫

326
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,940
Let's stay like this for a little more.

327
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,700
You got hurt too.

328
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,290
I'll get some medicine, just wait.

329
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:42,310
If we stay like this, I think I'll be all better.

330
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:51,250
It must've been so scary.

331
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:59,190
I was sure you would find me.

332
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:02,620
♫  Always  ♫

333
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:07,330
♫  Come  ♫

334
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:10,840
But I was scared.

335
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:15,300
I thought I'd never be able to hold your hand again.

336
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:19,300
I was scared to death.

337
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,950
Ahn,

338
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:23,950
That guy,

339
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:28,940
the guy that kidnapped me,

340
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:31,810
took my father's jacket.

341
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:37,840
That's why my father was framed.

342
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:41,220
- Just now, I remembered his face. 
- I know.

343
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:44,380
You heard about Prosecutor Kang's mother being alive, right?

344
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:50,480
That guy— he's definitely searching for her.

345
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,760
Because it didn't go his way, the people around Prosecutor Kang—

346
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:57,090
You don't have to explain it.

347
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:00,030
What happened in the warehouse,

348
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,690
you read all of it.

349
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,930
Yeah, so let's wait a moment.

350
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:16,790
Even if only for a moment, let's forget about it all.

351
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:20,780
You were even crying all throughout your dreams.

352
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:24,430
And you brought it up as soon as you woke up.

353
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:28,410
That guy,

354
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:32,250
I will find him.

355
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:35,930
Even though my ability,

356
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:40,770
only sees a few out of thousands of pieces,

357
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:47,640
I'm going to match them all.

358
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:53,250
Prosecutor Kang's mother and that person also,

359
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:55,940
you will definitely find them.

360
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,200
I believe you will.

361
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,960
You need to help me.

362
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:08,540
Without you,

363
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:15,100
I'm not a psychometrist but rather just a psycho.

364
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,650
Okay.

365
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,970
What are you doing over there?

366
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:46,820
Shh! I think our visit will only be a disturbance.

367
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,870
Let's leave the two of them alone.

368
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,350
Okay.

369
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:57,980
Why are looking at me like that? Let's go.

370
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:01,880
Stay still, my heart.

371
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:11,230
I'm so relieved that it worked out well for them.

372
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,030
Jae In suffered for so long.

373
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:18,820
I wish she could be happy.

374
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:21,180
You should be thinking of your own happiness.

375
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,400
What?

376
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,160
Nothing. I didn't say anything.

377
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:31,700
-Oh. I have a question. What's a 'psycho-rist'? 
- Huh?

378
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:35,670
I overheard a little of what they were saying.

379
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:40,290
Psycho-rist? Psycho-matrice?

380
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:47,470
- Ah! It could be a profession like a guitarist or a cellist,  couldn't it? 
- Uh...

381
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:49,160
Could it?

382
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:54,860
Well, Lee Ahn sure is a professional in the field of being a psycho.

383
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:58,020
Of course. No one could reach his level. But what about Eun Sol?

384
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:01,100
I left her with the fried chicken owner for two hours.

385
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:04,430
Since I finally have some time off,

386
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:06,260
I should go buy diapers.

387
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,950
You're going to need a porter.

388
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:09,960
I don't need one.

389
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:23,420
Prosecutor Kang's mother made a suicide attempt on December 17th?

390
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:26,500
It was the day we announced that Kim Gab Yong

391
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,950
had murdered the real Kang Hee Sook and Park Soo Young.

392
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,990
Why did it have to be that day?

393
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:36,370
More than that, why hide the fact that she's alive for  thirteen years,

394
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:38,450
and live with different identities?

395
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:40,200
I can't understand that.

396
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,950
I have a lot of questions too.

397
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:45,940
How Kang Eun Woo stayed alive all this time,

398
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:48,510
who on earth that man is,

399
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:52,930
why Kang Seung Mo has been keeping all of this from us.

400
00:39:54,380 --> 00:40:00,070
Could it be that Hyung is really trying to kill that man?

401
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:04,210
He discovered that his mother had a suicide attempt,

402
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:09,470
and if he knows Jae In was kidnapped by that man,

403
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:12,840
Noona, we have to stop him.

404
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:38,190
Yes, before Seong Mo does something he shouldn't,

405
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:42,050
we have to find Kang Eun Joo and that man first.

406
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:45,360
Were there any clues to help find him?

407
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,710
No, we don't even know his name yet.

408
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:51,660
Right now, Dr. Hong is tracing his identity based on the fingerprints from the car.

409
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,510
It's not an easy job.

410
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:58,080
Then wouldn't it be faster to investigate Prosecutor Kang's mother?

411
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,920
If we know what happened before the Yeongseong Apartment fire,

412
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,570
I think we should be able to find that man's identity.

413
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:05,860
If that person's target is Kang Eun Joo,

414
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,950
we should find out what their relationship is first.

415
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:10,040
Even now, he's probably

416
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:14,290
circling around us for clues about Kang Eun Joo.

417
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:18,040
Detective Eun, take care too.

418
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:21,880
I'm okay. I'm more worried about you.

419
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,620
The reason I became a target,

420
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:28,070
no matter how I think about it, I think there's a misunderstanding because Prosecutor Kang had been sponsoring me.

421
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:32,540
He doesn't like me or has feelings for me in such ways.

422
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:36,930
That's not a misunderstanding.

423
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:39,820
That jerk figured Seong Mo out.

424
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:41,210
Huh?

425
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:48,430
Anyway, what's for sure is that Kang Seong Mo and that man,

426
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:51,180
know each other so well.

427
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:55,390
They can predict each other's behavior and know each other's weak points.

428
00:41:55,390 --> 00:42:00,100
The reason why Kang Seong Mo wasn't able to approach you himself and kept Ahn by his side

429
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,330
is probably because of that.

430
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:08,920
He may have kept his feelings perfectly hidden from you,

431
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,460
but he couldn't fool that man.

432
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:15,120
Hyung knew everything from the beginning, right?

433
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:18,650
The Yeongseong Apartment and the Hanmin Care Home fire as well.

434
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:21,060
That the guy did all that because of Hyung's mother.

435
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,500
If it was Kang Seong Mo, he would have known.

436
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:26,910
The problem is, even though he knows that this guy is the culprit,

437
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:30,490
Seong Mo couldn't catch him for a long time since this guy seems like a ghost.

438
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:32,160
  This,  

439
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,570
  is not gone yet.  

440
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:38,410
  I'll have to live with it my whole life.  

441
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:44,370
  If you miss the timing to treat the wound, the wound becomes a scar.  

442
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:48,720
  They say a scar is a sign of overcoming the wound.  

443
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:53,060
 Why does it look like it still hurts?  

444
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:55,210
  It hurts.  

445
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:57,060
  Still.  

446
00:42:58,350 --> 00:43:02,860
  I still have memories from that time.  

447
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,140
Hyung too,

448
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:11,490
was tortured as well.

449
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:15,630
- What? 
 - Hyung has the same wound as Jae In on his ankle.

450
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:20,430
Noona, can you find out where Hyung lived before 
 he moved to the Yeongseong Apartment?

451
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:22,950
I was about to do that.

452
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:26,950
Thirteen years is too long ago to use your ability to see anything.

453
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:29,670
If I can use my power or not,

454
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:32,910
I want to know.

455
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:45,040
  Who that guy is,  

456
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:50,540
  why he did this and what his relationship is with Hyung...  

457
00:43:55,570 --> 00:44:00,310
If I know, when my ability is really needed,

458
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:02,670
maybe I can do better.

459
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:09,700
Right, let's go together.

460
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,570
Ah, and this.

461
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,410
The Yeongseong Apartment, the Hanmin Care Home,

462
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:19,660
and the data about the Kim Gab Yong murder case.

463
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:21,460
I thought you'd want to know.

464
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:23,710
Why did you bring these?

465
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:28,470
Why? Ahn even found where you were kidnapped with his abilities.

466
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:30,300
Is there a reason for me to wait any longer?

467
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:35,990
So you mean, you want us to officially assist in the investigation? You do, don't you?

468
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:37,920
That sounds so fancy. Yes.

469
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,210
Yeah, I'd like you to take care of it officially.

470
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:43,740
Psychometrist Lee Ahn.

471
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:45,180
And Constable Yoon, too.

472
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:47,220
Do you mean it?

473
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:50,130
I can't handle a case and manage him at the same time.

474
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:55,170
And I think you're the only person, who's dedicated enough with a sense of duty.

475
00:44:56,170 --> 00:44:58,550
Noona, thank you so much.

476
00:44:58,550 --> 00:45:00,280
Thank you so, so much, Noona.

477
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,260
Hey, are you not letting go? I have a lot on my mind right now.

478
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:05,430
Don't touch me. Don't read me.

479
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:06,790
What are you doing Officer Yoon? Stop him.

480
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:09,020
Hug her tighter, on my behalf too.

481
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:10,480
Okay, okay.

482
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,410
- Let go, let go! 
 - I love you.

483
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:15,700
Ah let go, let go. I have something to say to Constable Yoon.

484
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:19,070
To Jae In?

485
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:24,750
Look, Constable Yoon.

486
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,810
About your father,

487
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:31,800
I want to apologize on behalf of my dad for wrongly accusing your father.

488
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,600
I'm sorry.

489
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:39,500
I don't know if me working hard can repay the debt,

490
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:42,450
but I won't make the same mistake twice.

491
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:56,560
Noona.

492
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:04,790
Are you alright?

493
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,550
Well, I'm used to getting rejected by Kang Seong Mo.

494
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:12,470
I'll see you when she gets discharged.

495
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,570
Do you maybe have a library or bookstore in the hospital?

496
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:48,450
This way.

497
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:54,610
  The Little Prince  

498
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:09,770
  Yoon Jae In  

499
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:37,080
He shut down the security cameras beforehand and planned his murder thoroughly.

500
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,280
The murdering method is very simple.

501
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,190
The Yeongseong Apartment case, The Hanmin Care Home case and the Kim Gab Yong case

502
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:44,470
were all stabbings in the abdomen.

503
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:46,530
There's something unusual though.

504
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:50,190
The knife that was discovered at the site 
was not an established product.

505
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:52,670
What do you mean it is not an established product?

506
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:55,240
It seems like its homemade.

507
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:59,400
I saw him when he came to the Wire Class when he was searching for me.

508
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,500
He was very good.

509
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:06,420
It's possible that the chains he tied me up with were also hand made.

510
00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:11,600
By the way, where did you go?

511
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:25,370
It's the time you spent on your rose

512
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:28,790
that makes your rose so important.

513
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:34,280
You become responsible forever for what you've tamed.

514
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,930
Right.

515
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:39,080
He talked about that book.

516
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:42,850
I wanted to find out about this guy's mentality so 
 I've been trying to read this book...

517
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:44,960
I don't know.

518
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:50,390
It's just a warm story for me.

519
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:54,740
The time you spent on your rose.

520
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:57,120
So it's not just shortly before moving to the Yeongseong Apartment but

521
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:00,210
it means that the relationship has been entangled for a much longer time.

522
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:05,360
Jae In, you can't overdo it yet.

523
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,700
Let's wrap it up for today.

524
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:15,390
Now the truth will come out.

525
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:18,420
That my dad is not the culprit.

526
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:22,560
So don't cry now. You cant.

527
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,900
I'm not crying.

528
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,860
You are here so why would I cry?

529
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:33,040
I like hearing these words.

530
00:49:37,230 --> 00:49:38,910
What?

531
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:42,820
I like you, Lee Ahn.

532
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,350
I like you a lot.

533
00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:52,090
People say

534
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:54,830
that the moment you think you're going to die,

535
00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:58,020
the days of your life stretch out like a panorama.

536
00:49:58,610 --> 00:50:00,760
It was like that for me, too.

537
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:05,960
I remembered that I never got to tell you this.

538
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:13,350
Even so,  I was going to express my feelings first. You ruined it all.

539
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:15,470
Then you can do it too.

540
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:18,980
Hey, that... That...

541
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:21,710
You already said the words that are easy to say.

542
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:23,940
Right, then what?

543
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:28,060
After that, it's hard to do.

544
00:50:31,850 --> 00:50:36,350
Tell me honestly. You want to hear these words from me, right?

545
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:39,400
Yes. I want to hear them.

546
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:42,740
Why are you so straightforward today?

547
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:48,560
If we two go straight face to face like this, we'll end up in an accident or even a big accident.

548
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:53,070
Can't we get into that big accident?

549
00:50:53,070 --> 00:50:59,600
You, do you even know the meaning of what you are saying right now?

550
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,860
Ah, gosh.

551
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:07,260
See! You're laughing so it's good.

552
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:12,960
Just like everytime you made me laugh when I had a hard time.

553
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:16,300
♫  I’ll be the time you need   ♫

554
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:23,580
now I will make you laugh whenever you are having a hard time.

555
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:27,180
♫   I’ll stay here   ♫

556
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:31,660
♫   And wait for you  ♫

557
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:37,140
♫   I’ll caress your eyes   ♫

558
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:41,880
♫  Don't cry again  ♫

559
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:45,420
♫  I will give you the time you need  ♫

560
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:48,290
♫  I will give you the time you need  ♫

561
00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:51,880
♫  I’ll recognize your heart  ♫

562
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:56,590
♫  Don't hurt alone again  ♫

563
00:51:56,590 --> 00:52:00,340
♫  I'll stay here  ♫

564
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:04,940
♫  With you  ♫

565
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:14,380
♫  My heart remembers you ♫ 

566
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:20,170
I will do it.

567
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:22,030
Forget it.

568
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:24,170
You really don't listen.

569
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:28,360
It got really warm.

570
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:30,620
I wish spring would come quickly.

571
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:33,920
Yeah, that would be nice.

572
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:37,790
I said I'd do it later.

573
00:52:37,790 --> 00:52:40,530
You shouldn't be working as soon as you get discharged.

574
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:41,730
It's not too dirty.

575
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:43,290
She doesn't listen even if you try to stop her.

576
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:46,130
This might be my last time cleaning here.

577
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:49,110
I've gotten attached to this Community Security Center a lot.

578
00:52:49,110 --> 00:52:51,720
What do you mean the last cleaning?

579
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:55,070
Jae In...

580
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:58,230
will soon announce her assignment to the special investigation department.

581
00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:01,360
Hello.

582
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:06,940
We would've come to you if you would have called, so why did you come all the way here?

583
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:13,190
What is it? Why are you bringing your things to the Community Security Center?

584
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,870
I’m here to investigate why.

585
00:53:15,870 --> 00:53:17,770
Here?

586
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:26,570
I mean, I need your help,

587
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:31,080
I said we'd investigate together. I never said I'd bring you into the special investigation unit.

588
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:34,270
Wow. Were you scamming your brother?

589
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:36,200
Constable Yoon, did you think so, too?

590
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:40,460
Yes, I also thought that we'd be working at the special investigation unit.

591
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:41,720
Oh, you didn't know.

592
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:45,550
Prosecutor Kang is taking a leave of absence, and the special investigation unit is being temporarily disbanded.

593
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:50,520
And officially creating a team for the closed cases

594
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:53,310
of Yeongseong Apartment and the suitcase would be awkward.

595
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:55,870
I guess you could say this is my personal investigation.

596
00:53:55,870 --> 00:53:59,050
I didn't think we would all be dropping down to this level.

597
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,930
Constable Yoon, I’m disappointed.

598
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:04,930
Working at the Community Security Center is dropping a level?

599
00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:10,030
Lieutenant Nam here has worked more furiously than anyone in this field.

600
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:17,020
He's not someone you should look down on just because he is approaching retirement.

601
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:20,100
So is Lieutenant Nam on our team too?

602
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:21,590
Of course.

603
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:25,970
Wait. I don't know what's going on but there seems to be a misunderstanding.

604
00:54:25,970 --> 00:54:30,420
I don't intend on getting stabbed while chasing for an arrest at this age.

605
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:34,200
Does that mean everyone's totally against me?

606
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:35,720
Should I just go? Go back?

607
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:39,030
Not to go back, but to take us with you to the special investigation unit!

608
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:42,500
If not, at least the violent crimes unit—

609
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,350
Even you... What would I say to the superiors about taking that guy?

610
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:50,680
You, at least, have a title as a probationer. That kid...

611
00:54:54,130 --> 00:54:57,180
- Anyway, I can't. 
- What is this?

612
00:54:57,180 --> 00:55:00,250
Saying that I'm on the same team but feeling outcast?

613
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:02,790
I’ll explain everything to you when I get back.

614
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:04,810
Let’s go first.

615
00:55:04,810 --> 00:55:07,640
I’ll be borrowing Constable Yoon for the meantime.

616
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,180
Let’s go! Let’s go! Let’s go!

617
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:18,430
This isn't just a feeling but being straight up an outcast.

618
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:25,820
  Yeongseong Apartment Arson Murder Case 

619
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:29,960
  I'm going to properly reinvestigate the Yeongseong Apartment murder case. 

620
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:30,910
  What?  

621
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:32,330
 Don't stop me. 

622
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:38,050
 If you get in the way again then that means that you are definitely hiding something. 

623
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:42,040
 Don't disappoint me any further. 

624
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:45,080
 Eun Ji Soo. Ji Soo! 

625
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:56,030
I think Officer Yoon was right about them going way back.

626
00:55:56,030 --> 00:56:00,160
We're going to go chronologically. Starting from Kang Eun Joo's hometown.

627
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,710
Kangwon-do Kangryung-si.

628
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:06,460
Yes. She lived there until 1996,

629
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:08,860
but frequently moved after that.

630
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:10,840
She roamed all across the country.

631
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:14,490
Then it might be that she started running away from him from 1996.

632
00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:16,870
Yes. But there are more than one or two strange things.

633
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:19,770
First, look at Kang Seong Mo‘s birth records.

634
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:23,990
Seeing Mo's birthday is May 24th, 1988,

635
00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:27,470
but his birth registration was in 1996.

636
00:56:27,470 --> 00:56:28,900
It’s nine years late.

637
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:30,890
What?

638
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:33,510
They didn't report his birth registration for nine years?

639
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:35,860
Also, he was registered under Kang Eun Joo,

640
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:38,690
and there's no record of a father.

641
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:40,580
Then by chance...

642
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:44,250
  You said your father passed away early, right? 

643
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:46,720
  What was he like? 

644
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,150
You heard nothing about Prosecutor Kang’s father, right?

645
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:51,010
Never.

646
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:54,350
Please, I hope it’s not what we imagine it to be.

647
00:57:24,170 --> 00:57:26,410
It seems like they've been out of business for a long time.

648
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:28,620
Let’s go in first.

649
00:57:47,450 --> 00:57:50,350
It must have been an iron factory.

650
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:53,120
I think it’s been a long time since someone’s been here.

651
00:57:55,850 --> 00:58:00,020
You can look for anything left behind from when Seong Mo lived here,

652
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:02,040
and Ahn you know, right?

653
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:03,640
Yeah.

654
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,560
Yes, Dr. Hong.

655
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:20,470
He must have made things from knives to chains

656
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:22,670
in this place.

657
00:58:28,850 --> 00:58:30,510
Wait.

658
00:58:31,190 --> 00:58:33,200
- It’s not that way. 
 - What?

659
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,430
The direction of the footprints,

660
00:58:35,430 --> 00:58:40,930
from here, they head over there.

661
00:58:40,930 --> 00:58:43,850
I think someone has been here recently.

662
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:48,450
- Did you ID the suspect? 
  - No. 

663
00:58:48,450 --> 00:58:54,610
 Rather than that, I found a record of an unsolved case. 

664
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:57,020
An unsolved case?

665
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:03,420
 It's a case from Kangwon-do Kangryung-si in 1996. 

666
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:07,080
 They found the culprit's fingerprints but couldn't find his identity then, either. 

667
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:09,520
 I think that's why it was left unsolved. 

668
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:13,930
  Kangryung Iron Trading Company 

669
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:19,650
What incident was it?

670
00:59:26,350 --> 00:59:28,280
It’s this way.

671
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:51,360
 Wear safety helmet 

672
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:54,630
This way.

673
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:18,960
I see it.

674
01:00:20,610 --> 01:00:22,720
Hyung was here.

675
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:40,030
He definitely came this way.

676
01:00:54,570 --> 01:00:56,410
Wait a second.

677
01:01:04,690 --> 01:01:06,990
There’s no dust only here.

678
01:01:06,990 --> 01:01:08,610
What?

679
01:01:11,090 --> 01:01:14,010
I think someone opened the door recently.

680
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:40,090
What is this?

681
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:48,810
Why is this here?

682
01:01:48,810 --> 01:01:50,760
Is it a basement?

683
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:52,900
I'll have to go inside.

684
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:06,230
  Seong Mo, run away. Run away! 

685
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:07,650
 Run away! Run! 

686
01:02:07,650 --> 01:02:09,550
 Run! 

687
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:14,770
 For as many as nine years, a woman and a child 

688
01:02:14,770 --> 01:02:17,750
were locked up in a basement.

689
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:30,990


690
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:35,440
 He is Psychometric 

691
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:38,300
♫  It's crawlin' in the dark  ♫

692
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:41,290
♫   I'm chained up to the walls   ♫

693
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:45,980
♫   I'm drowning' in my world   ♫

694
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:49,970
♫  It's turning back again  ♫

695
01:02:49,970 --> 01:02:52,960
♫  I'm longing to face  ♫

696
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:57,060
♫   I'll do it on my own   ♫

697
01:03:00,340 --> 01:03:03,500
  Did you mean to come and see me? 

698
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:05,920
  Maybe he didn't want this case to be dug up. 

699
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:08,750
  If he had been perfectly acting... 

700
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:10,660
  So it was closed and buried as quietly as possible. 

701
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:13,620
  You know. That's my real name. 

702
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:16,590
 I came from a place that exists but doesn't exist. 

703
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:18,140
  Please. 

704
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:20,740
  Was my father's investigation not a simple mistake, 

705
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:23,510
 but an intentional cover-up of the truth?  

706
01:03:23,510 --> 01:03:27,410
 We need to at least find invisible traces. That's your specialty. 

707
01:03:27,410 --> 01:03:29,320
 Detective Eun! 

708
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:33,170
♫   Fade away   ♫
