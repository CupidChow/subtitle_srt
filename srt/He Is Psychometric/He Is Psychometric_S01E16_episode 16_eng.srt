1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,230
 He is Psychometric 

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:14,710


3
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,690
 He is Psychometric 

4
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,130
  What's with this security guard and his obsession with the fire protection system?  

5
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:49,100
  No wonder he's a former fire fighter. 

6
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,150
  Unbelievable. 

7
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,830
  Let's say a dog challenges its owner.  

8
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:55,780
  What can you do?  

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,160
  You have to boil it, am I not right?  

10
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,710
  Yes, you boil it until it's tender. 

11
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,200
  What is it again?  

12
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:08,560
 Who is it? 

13
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,920
  What's the matter sir? Did you come because you have something to say to me?  

14
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,450
  What is this bag?  

15
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:21,160
  - I am very sorry. 
 - Hm?  

16
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,080
  This voice...  

17
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:46,930
  What's wrong? What's the matter? 

18
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:32,520
 Psychometry: An ability to measure and interpret the essence or history of a person or thing through touch. 

19
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,750
 He is Psychometric 
 ~ Final Episode ~

20
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,670
Lee Ahn? Ahn!

21
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:54,130
Come to your senses Ahn, Ahn!

22
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,580
No way.

23
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,760
There's an emergency, there's an emergency.

24
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,760
In Unit 702, victim Lee Ahn is injured.

25
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,230
He has no signs of breathing nor a pulse. I request an emergency dispatch!

26
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,410
Ahn!

27
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:53,110
Are you okay? Are you okay?

28
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,030
Jae In.

29
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,750
Jae In.

30
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:21,940
Here, the person that murdered and set the fire...

31
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,920
It was Hyung.

32
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,900
We have to find him.

33
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,650
The police are looking for him, so you stay here.

34
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:58,840
You could die using your ability.

35
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,520
I think I know where Hyung is.

36
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,450
Ahn! Lee Ahn!

37
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,740
Lee Ahn!

38
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,080
Are you okay?

39
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,720
Lee Ahn!

40
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,180
What is going on? Where is he going?

41
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,830
He thinks he knows where Prosecutor Kang is.

42
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,990
Which floor is he going to? The 15th floor? The rooftop?

43
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:10,180
Lieutenant Nam, please go to the rooftop. I'll go to the 15th floor.

44
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,730
Alright.

45
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:16,250
I was too late, wasn't I?

46
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:21,840
I should have come here and asked you to help me.

47
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,160
I am very much too late.

48
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,340
Why did you do that? Did you want to stage it as Kang Geun Taek's doing?

49
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,400
Because you wanted to turn him into a criminal...

50
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,900
Did you kill these people

51
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,030
and set the fire?

52
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:42,390
I knew as soon as I saw the dead body that Kang Geun Taek brought with him,

53
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,330
what his plans were.

54
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:56,050
  Knife, lighter,  

55
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,620
  Mom's ID card... 

56
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,130
  A burnt woman.  

57
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,130
  And I thought...  

58
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:11,340
  What should we do 

59
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,410
  to escape from this hell?  

60
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:16,070
Before he finds my mother...

61
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,510
I thought that if I put him in jail, it would all be over.

62
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,020
  What is this?  

63
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:34,450
 The more people died,  

64
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:38,620
  I thought that the police would look more closely into our case.  

65
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,550
I knew that it was the wrong choice, but...

66
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:49,050
I couldn't stop.

67
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,900
The one who planned this

68
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:57,580
and the one who brought the dead body was Kang Geun Taek...

69
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:00,080
But the one who carried it out was me.

70
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,600
That's when I knew. No matter how much I wanted to deny it...

71
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,190
I...

72
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,540
am the son of a monster.

73
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:24,390
Then, why?

74
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,930
Why did you not escape and stay on the 7th floor?

75
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:33,000
You had time to escape. Why did you stay there

76
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,020
and save me?

77
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:44,060
  Help! 

78
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,730
  Move to the stairs! Lower your body as much as possible!  

79
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,060
  - Lower it. 
 - I was scared.  

80
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:58,110
  I was scared and horrified by what I had done. 

81
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:06,610
Ironically, when I chose to become a monster,

82
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:09,460
for the first time, I realized

83
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,200
what fear and guilt were.

84
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,840
I couldn't move.

85
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,950
Back then, your emotions came to life

86
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,990
and that's why you saved me?

87
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,630
That's right.

88
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,790
 In order to meet the police officer who had offered to help me, 

89
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:51,350
 I went to Unit 1501 but it was empty. 

90
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,950
Lieutenant Nam, I'm at Unit 1501.

91
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,460
Don't move.

92
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,270
I'm sorry, Ahn.

93
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:39,380
I'm sorry, Constable Yoon.

94
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:53,630
Under the provisions of Article 112 of the Criminal Procedure Act,

95
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:56,260
I place you under arrest.

96
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,580
You have the right to remain silent.

97
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:02,510
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.

98
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:06,710
And you have the right to an attorney.

99
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,890
Take him away.

100
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:25,700
It's over, Miss Kang Eun Joo.

101
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,820
We've arrested Kang Geun Taek.

102
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,200
We were told that he is currently in surgery.

103
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,910
And Prosecutor Kang Seong Mo has been arrested as well.

104
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,820
Detective Park, stay here for a while.

105
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,450
Yes.

106
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:53,420
  Operating Room  

107
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:58,500
Due to sepsis and DIC, necrotizing fasciitis has occurred. 
     

108
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,630
We had no choice but to amputate his left arm.

109
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,950
Is his life at risk?

110
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:07,240
 We have moved him to the Intensive Care Unit for now, but I think we will have to continue to keep an eye on his condition. 

111
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:23,410
Do you admit to kidnapping and attempting to murder Kang Geun Taek?

112
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:25,620
Yes, I do.

113
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:31,650
The Yeongseong Apartment murders and arson were of course, committed by me as well.

114
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:34,060
Were you planning on framing Kang Geun Taek for all of it?

115
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:37,740
My priority was only the safety of one single person at that time.

116
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,080
Rather than worrying about the pain or true stories of other people,

117
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:45,060
what will happen to my mother if I were to go to prison,

118
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:48,310
if I would be able to handle Kang Geun Taek on my own,

119
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,850
these were my only concerns.

120
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:54,070
But why did you wait until now to come and save Kang Geun Taek?

121
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,950
You had plenty of time to get your revenge.

122
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:58,460
I didn't save him.

123
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,640
Rather, I wanted that person to feel agony.

124
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,900
I wanted him to die a slow, painful death.

125
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,040
He just turned himself in? Without any protest?

126
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:18,810
Then why the hell did he make us look like idiots, following him as he ran away?

127
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:24,070
Wow, this is driving me crazy. Constable Yoon, is it true that he confessed to everything?

128
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:26,730
- Yes. 
  - I'm going to lose my mind.

129
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,830
  I'll find that guy, no matter what. Promise me that you'll be patient.  

130
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:52,010
  You've grown up a lot, from the kid who used to make a big fuss about seeing weird visions.  

131
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:01,120
  Whoa, this is really our house? 

132
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,620
  Finally, this house seems fit for a prosecutor to live in. 

133
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:07,390
  Anyway, this is a housewarming gift for you guys. 

134
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:09,490
  Oh, thank you. 

135
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,760
  Confiscated Evidence  

136
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:35,750
  Cellphone  

137
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,850
  Kang Seong Mo's Cellphone 

138
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,260
  010-311-0430 

139
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,650
  Kang Seong Mo, where are you right now? 

140
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:06,600
  If you think you're going to threaten me with something like our accounting records, you'd better think again. 

141
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,650
-  It's not a threat but a negotiation.
- Negotiation? 

142
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:13,130
What's this? Is he trying to make a deal to keep himself out of this mess?

143
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:16,090
- Listen until the end. 
   - What is it that you want? 

144
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:19,070
  Is this about Kang Geun Taek or whatever 

145
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:23,290
  and your interrogation as a suspect for his kidnapping? 

146
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:28,230
  Is that it? Are you trying to find a way out of it in case something goes wrong? Is that what you want? 

147
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:32,170
  In those accounting records, from 2004 to 2010, 

148
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:34,660
  there are detailed records of the slush fund 

149
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:40,200
  between YSS Construction and Dragon Head Hunting, extremely detailed records. 

150
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,700
  Bring those records here. Even if you end up killing him, 

151
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,230
  I'll make sure to take care of it with no issues. 

152
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:49,990
  Where are the accounting records? 

153
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:56,980
  Chancellor, those records are going to be like the small stones at the base of a stone tower. 

154
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,780
  What are you blabbering on about right now? 

155
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,410
  They say that you should build the rocks step by step. 

156
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:05,220
  I don't have a lot of time, you see. 

157
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:09,390
  Let's meet up now. Where are you currently? 

158
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:11,840
  Regardless of whatever I've committed, 

159
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,280
 - don't interfere. Follow the legal procedure.
- What? 

160
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:22,870
  And wait until the day that your stone tower is complete. 

161
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:28,230
  For you to be scared to death, holding onto what authority you have, constantly anxious about when the tower will fall, 

162
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:33,170
  that is what I want. 

163
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:39,140
He offered to clear your name as a murder suspect as long as you brought him those accounting records,

164
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:42,490
but you confessed instead?

165
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,630
So? Where are the records currently located?

166
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:53,400
Who I should entrust these documents to?

167
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,970
I thought about that for a long time. But of course, there was only one answer.

168
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:00,370
For the last time,

169
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:04,250
please pass on these words to Ahn.

170
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:14,290
For ruining his past, present, and future,

171
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:18,020
that I'm sorry.

172
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,290
Yeah, Jae In?

173
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:54,310
I asked Prosecutor Kang where the YSS Construction slush fund records are located, but

174
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:58,720
I think he's worried about the information getting leaked since he started to beat around the bush.

175
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,790
Beat around the bush?

176
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:04,720
He's sorry for ruining your past, present, and future.

177
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,600
He wanted me to tell you that.

178
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:11,420
Does he mean that the records are  there? 

179
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,350
Do you know what he means?

180
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:23,950
  Did you have to bring me to a place with so many people just so you could pick a painting? 

181
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:27,870
  Pick one that you like. I'll frame it for my room. 

182
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,080
  If I pick it, then it should go in my room. 

183
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,920
  Whatever, you're so weird. 

184
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:39,560
  Oh! This one's cool. 

185
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:45,080
  A wolf, a lion... 

186
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,070
  Is that one a dog? 

187
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:50,350
  I like this one. 

188
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,570
  Why? You don't like it? 

189
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:55,830
  No, I like it. 

190
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:02,520
  They say that a lion means the present, a wolf is the past, and a dog is the future. 

191
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,430
  You learn from your past 

192
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:09,110
  and so that you don't ruin your future, 

193
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:12,480
  you'll be careful of your actions in the present. 

194
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,820
  That's what it means. 

195
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:22,110
  He's sorry for ruining your past, present, and future. 

196
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:24,490
  He wanted me to tell you that. 

197
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,330
  Financial Account Records  

198
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:19,970
Excuse me.

199
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:26,740
  Seong Mo, I have a favor to ask.  

200
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:33,010
  The people who are unhappy because of your wrongful choices,  

201
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:35,330
  let's not hurt them anymore.  

202
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:39,350
  And if you're trying to kill him and yourself, 

203
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,540
  you absolutely can't do that.  

204
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,410
  If you do,  

205
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:47,210
  you'll never be forgiven by anyone in despair.  

206
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:51,720
  By myself of course as well as those kids.  

207
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:59,290
Don't tell me

208
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:03,490
to understand or forgive Seong Mo yet.

209
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:08,140
That would be too cruel of a request to me right now.

210
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,460
From the current Police Commissioner to Congressmen,

211
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:37,460
YSS Construction bribed all kinds of higher-ups.

212
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,580
This is getting too big.

213
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:44,350
This is not bringing a knife to a gun fight but bringing dust to a gun fight.

214
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:47,020
It's true that it was Prosecutor Kang who committed the murder,

215
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:51,320
but it was the corruption within the YSS construction that caused this disaster.

216
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,170
You knew everything from the beginning, Lieutenant Nam.

217
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:58,540
Right, I know. But the people who let go of this construction scandal

218
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,600
are still in their current jobs.

219
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:05,580
Even if we hand this to the prosecution, it will turn into a piece of garbage in a second.

220
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:11,880
As Prosecutor Kang said, it really takes strength and time.

221
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,640
What's going to be the difference over time?

222
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,520
While these men are continuing this from generation to generation, we're just going to sit and watch?

223
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,060
We can't do that.

224
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,490
We've already started, so we have to end it.

225
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:27,960
So how do we end it?

226
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,230
How?

227
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:36,080
Wouldn't it be possible if we had the power of Director Eun's degree?

228
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:42,910
I was prepared but I didn't expect to be sitting here so quickly.

229
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:44,990
This book is a copy.

230
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:47,660
We have the original, just in case of an emergency.

231
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:51,300
So what you're saying is that I'm going to be a bomb?

232
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,210
You're not the only one who's involved in the Yeongseong Apartment corruption.

233
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:59,680
All the people who overlooked it, all the spectators and all the sympathizers are in on it.

234
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,830
Okay. Let's try it.

235
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:10,590
Gather the press first. That's the only thing that is going to give strength to this matter.

236
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:18,520
  After two months since the re-investigation began, 

237
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:23,000
  the real culprit of the Yeongseong case has turned himself in after fourteen years 

238
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,910
  and we are now in a new situation.  

239
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:27,940
  Attention is being drawn to the announcement of  

240
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:33,080
  Police Director Eun Byung Ho, who was in charge of the investigation at that time, and the corruption of YSS— 

241
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:42,860
Isn't there any news right now where all the reporters have to rush to?

242
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:45,530
I'm telling you to blow something up!

243
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:51,730
First, to the deceased victims of the Yesongseong Apartment fire in 2005

244
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:55,820
and to the family of the deceased, we are asking for forgiveness.

245
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:11,100
I concealed the truth by investigating insincerely

246
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:15,610
and tried to minimize the case. Oblivious of my duty as a police officer,

247
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:17,570
 I received a bribe from YSS Construction 

248
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:20,540
 regarding a raise in my job position and rank. 

249
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:23,360
 I admit to them all 

250
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,120
 and I hereby resign from my position to take full responsibility. 

251
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,950
 The media reports about the corruption in YSS are all true. 

252
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:38,300
 I promise that I will cooperate sincerely with the investigation. 

253
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:42,140
 As a public servant, I failed to set a good example. 

254
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:45,100
 I am truly sorry. 

255
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,560
To protect the people

256
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:54,380
and to properly carry out legal orders are the mission and reason the police exist.

257
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:58,120
Due to me and my own loss of sight of that mission and reason,

258
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:04,370
I hope that the criticism against the entire police force will not continue.

259
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:23,650
Let's see now.

260
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:26,140
A special unit will investigate the prosecution.

261
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:30,190
All we can do now is hope for the tree to be less rotten.

262
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:34,650
I am satisfied that we even came up to here.

263
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:41,020
It's a lawyer I know well.

264
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:44,750
Kang Seong Mo confessed. You don't have to wait any longer.

265
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:46,950
We should get ready for a new trial.

266
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,120
Thank you.

267
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,960
What is there to thank me for?

268
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:53,600
You and Ahn did all the work. All I did was assist you.

269
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,100
Constable Yoon, you did pretty well.

270
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:18,400
Did you sleep at Dae Bong's place yesterday, too?

271
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,150
Yeah.

272
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:22,290
Is Dae Bong's dad not saying anything?

273
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:26,630
The place is so spacious that I don't even know where he is.

274
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:30,570
I've never lived in a house like that before.

275
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:33,430
Me neither.

276
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:40,060
  Police Commissioner Eun Byung Ho's announcement of his resignation prompted an re-investigation into the Yeongseong Apartment case. 

277
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:45,980
  The investigation is following up on the rumors surrounding the corrupt relationships between the prosecution, police, and politicians. 

278
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:49,530
 The police have already attained evidence of the bribes between 

279
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:52,230
 YSS Construction and authority figures in the political and financial circles. 

280
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:56,120
 For inflaming the cases and causing confusion, the Prosecution is filing a lawsuit 

281
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,970
 through a petition to the Blue House. 

282
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:00,330
 The Prosecutors are passing along the right to the exclusive jurisdiction for 

283
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:03,860
 investigation, indictment, and public prosecution. 

284
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,200
 In order to stop the Prosecution's political power 

285
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,420
 and empower the independent voices, 

286
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:12,970
the investigation was passed on much too late.

287
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:29,370
Do you want to go in together?

288
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:32,510
I'm going to make my formal greetings later on.

289
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:34,330
I don't think

290
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:38,030
he'd want to meet his daughter's boyfriend in there.

291
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:42,720
Okay. See you.

292
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,990
You've gotten so thin.

293
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:08,210
You seem to be happier now.

294
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:10,920
Your aunt's been here a lot in the meantime.

295
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,770
She told me you've been working hard.

296
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:16,300
The culprit confessed

297
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:20,270
and the residents of the apartment have testified again.

298
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:23,940
The lawyer said that there would be good results.

299
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:28,490
But he said that we'll have to wait at least three months for a retrial.

300
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:30,980
I'm fine.

301
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:33,580
That is nothing for me.

302
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,570
I'm sorry.

303
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:39,730
What for?

304
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,080
They were only brief moments,

305
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:48,920
but I suspected that you might have actually

306
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,170
been the culprit.

307
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,970
Jae In.

308
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,400
I am sorry

309
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:01,840
for only making you suffer

310
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:05,140
and not being a good dad.

311
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:15,450
Come to think of it, we haven't had

312
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:19,060
a proper date since the first one. Right?

313
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:21,010
Is there anything you want to do?

314
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,210
There's a lot, but I don't want to.

315
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:26,950
I don't want to put my boyfriend's life at risk for a date.

316
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:31,530
I guess I'll never get to enjoy an ordinary date.

317
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:39,090
Right, I was going to tell you something.

318
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:42,160
You're not allowed to touch any corpses anymore.

319
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:42,870
What?

320
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:47,000
No more crime scenes either. No, not even murder weapons. No way! Never!

321
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,460
Then what am I supposed to do?

322
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:51,300
You? There's a lot of types of crimes. Hmm...

323
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,390
Disappearances or voice phishing...

324
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:56,740
Well, I guess you could do something like that.

325
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:00,490
And you? You also shouldn't go to murder scenes either, it's dangerous.

326
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:05,030
I have to go, of course. There's a rumor that I'm about to get a special promotion soon.

327
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,890
A special promotion? Me?

328
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:09,790
Don't you remember? I'm a probationary officer,

329
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:13,800
but there's no way to explain who you are. Detective Eun—

330
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:33,140
I know you're trying hard not to speak about Seong Mo and Ji Soo,

331
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,900
but you don't have to.

332
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:41,800
You never bring them up, so I try not to as well.

333
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:46,070
Your dad said that if you hide your wound, it will fester.

334
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:49,490
So I also don't want to cover it up.

335
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:53,570
Have I ever told you that?

336
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:56,300
I have other ways of knowing.

337
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:08,910
Prosecutor Kang's first trial is coming up soon.

338
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,390
Are you going to go?

339
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,180
  Seoul Seohun Police Station  

340
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,480
Once again,

341
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:35,720
I didn't kill anyone.

342
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,920
Not a single person.

343
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:57,140
I kept asking him from the moment he gained consciousness at the hospital, but he claims he didn't kill anyone.

344
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:59,480
He denies killing Detective Eun as well.

345
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,520
Let's start with the crimes that we can prove with evidence.

346
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:07,270
We can't prove that the fake Kang Eun Joo corpse was already killed before going to Yeongseong Apartment.

347
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:11,980
Nor do we have direct evidence of Kim Gab Yong's murder. All we have is circumstantial evidence from the use of chains.

348
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:17,650
So the only cases remaining are the Hanmin Care Home case and Ji Soo Noona's case.

349
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:21,150
Regarding Detective Eun's case, we have lots of evidence as well as many witnesses.

350
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:23,100
The issue lies with the Hanmin Care Home case.

351
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,780
If he keeps refusing to sign the statement,

352
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:30,210
our only available course of action is to make Kang Eun Joo testify, right?

353
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:33,660
I think that is Kang Geun Taek's goal too.

354
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:37,090
You mean he would do whatever it takes to see Kang Eun Joo's face one last time?

355
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:41,500
He'll always be a monster.

356
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,900
Wouldn't it be too horrific to ask Kang Eun Joo

357
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,380
to testify in front of the man who kept her locked up for nine years?

358
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:51,920
It's more horrifying that he might come back ten years from now to terrorize her again.

359
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,950
We have to lock him up tight while we have the chance.

360
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:59,900
Jae In and I will go to meet Kang Eun Joo.

361
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:03,860
You want me to testify about the Hanmin Care Home case?

362
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,540
In front of that man?

363
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:09,120
I understand that it'll be difficult, but that's the only way

364
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,850
for Kang Geun Taek to receive a long sentence in court.

365
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:16,620
Do you think it'll be possible?

366
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:19,610
I know it's what I have to do, but...

367
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:22,870
Can you give me some more time?

368
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:25,430
I'll think it over.

369
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:28,730
I have some things I have to pack,

370
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:30,400
help me out.

371
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,930
Okay.

372
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,590
Did you know that?

373
00:36:56,950 --> 00:37:02,750
Prosecutor Kang's mom has never said Kang Geun Taek's name.

374
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,760
I know.

375
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,570
By any chance, do you know the reason why?

376
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:16,780
  What's your real name? Where did you come from?  

377
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:19,270
Because she thinks,

378
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:22,870
that everything happened because of that name.

379
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:25,700
  Gwangsa  

380
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:32,040
 You seriously don't have a name or any resident registration? 

381
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,290
 I guess you got abandoned as a kid. 

382
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:40,510
 There's tons of people like you here. 

383
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:43,660
 Those CEO bastards gather those kinds of people here on purpose. 

384
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:46,130
 Since they don't have to pay you a big salary. 

385
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:50,010
 Hey, you should get your resident registration at least. 

386
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:53,550
 You need a name if you want to be registered. 

387
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:55,990
 You don't have a nickname or anything either? 

388
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:57,520
 No. 

389
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,620
 I see. 

390
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:03,200
 Hey, Eun Joo! 

391
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,130
 You know some hanja characters right? Give this guy a name.
     

392
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:16,050
  Geun Taek 

393
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:21,170
 How about Geun Taek? Geun for "roots" and Taek for "home"? 

394
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:22,400
 Geun Taek? 

395
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,300
 You've been wandering around all this time, haven't you? 

396
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,610
 So that you can quickly settle somehwhere. 

397
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,610
 Let's go inside and pack up! 

398
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:43,890
 I like that name. 

399
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,220
 What's your name? 

400
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:49,330
 Me? I'm Kang Eun Joo. 

401
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,660
 Then... 

402
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,980
 I'll be Kang Geun Taek, too. 

403
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:07,510
根宅家宙 
   

404
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:14,640
 That's probably the memory that Kang Eun Joo wants to erase the most. 

405
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:39,690
  Regular/Automatic mode  

406
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:16,070
Excuse me, I'll do it.

407
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,730
I'm sorry.

408
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,030
I'll just do this before I go.

409
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:39,860
You promised Hyung

410
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:42,230
that you wouldn't cry anymore.

411
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:48,090
If you stay inside for the rest of your life, then Hyung capturing Kang Geun Taek and turning himself in will be useless.

412
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:52,890
If I

413
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:58,440
stay here, it brings back too many memories of Hyung.

414
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,850
So that's why I'm leaving.

415
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:03,340
Not because of you.

416
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:10,200
There's too much stuff to pack, I think we'll have to come back another time.

417
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,690
Alright.

418
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:57,700
Make sure you eat all of this, got it?

419
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:01,520
Since it's on me today.

420
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,030
Oh? Really? What for?

421
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:06,090
I didn't think you guys would ever grow up,

422
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:08,460
but you've all become so mature!

423
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:12,490
How could I not treat you guys, as your most respected teacher?

424
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:13,700
Teacher~

425
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,040
And since I'm treating you guys,

426
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,840
one more person will be joining us.

427
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,490
What?

428
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,390
Right on time! Here she comes.

429
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:26,200
Here, sit down.

430
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:30,530
What about Eun Sol?

431
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:32,460
Your aunt is looking after her.

432
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:34,910
She told me to have fun and live for now.

433
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:44,290
Enjoy the food.

434
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:53,420
What's this? Why is it so weird between you guys?

435
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:56,490
Uh...While you guys were occupied,

436
00:42:56,490 --> 00:43:00,010
a lot of stuff happened between us, too.

437
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:01,680
What kind of stuff?

438
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:05,390
I'll tell you later.

439
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:07,830
Let's drink first. Cheers, cheers!

440
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:09,550
Cheers!

441
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,930
Why?

442
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:30,510
Did you see something? You did, didn't you!

443
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,860
Which side do you think she's on?

444
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:44,120
Does she really hate me?

445
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,540
If I were to exaggerate a little,

446
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:52,490
I think she finally recognized your true value.

447
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:55,440
Don't mess it up.

448
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,870
What if she suddenly confesses to you today?

449
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:04,390
♫  I'll protect you, hold my hand now  ♫

450
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:08,890
The man should be the one to confess!

451
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:10,060
Hey, we have to do a toast!

452
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:12,970
- Let's make a toast! 
 - Gather your glasses here.

453
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:15,700
Gather up, cheers!

454
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:20,650
Cheers!

455
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:25,100
The defendant has just pleaded not guilty to all charges. Is that correct?

456
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:31,130
I did not kill anybody.

457
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:32,940
Do you believe that?

458
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:36,730
Order! Order in the court!

459
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:40,240
Is the Prosecution's witness, Kang Eun Joo, present?

460
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,150
  Judge's Bench  

461
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:10,690
Witness. Please say the oath.

462
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:20,250
I swear to be true to my conscience and

463
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:23,210
to speak the truth as it is.

464
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:26,300
If I should lie,

465
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:30,240
I agree to accept the penalty of perjury.

466
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:35,720
Prosecution, you may question the witness.

467
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:39,710
In 2016, just prior to the Hanmin Care Home fire,

468
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:43,890
- did you receive a call from Kang Geun Taek? 
 - Yes.

469
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:47,460
The defendant Kang Geun Taek threatened to kill Song Hee Jung,

470
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:52,550
Yoo Eun Ok, and Jung Man Soon, so you went there, correct?

471
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:54,200
Yes.

472
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,600
 Judge's Bench  
My goodness.

473
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:00,280
Can you explain in detail what happened afterward?

474
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:11,360
Yes, I will

475
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,640
tell you everything.

476
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:23,700
The defendant stabbed the defenseless victims, then set a fire to destroy the bodies.

477
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:28,160
Afterward, instead of stopping, he abducted a police officer

478
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:32,750
and stabbed another, causing her death and then went on the run.

479
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:37,620
The court finds it difficult to understand the motives behind the murders, abduction,

480
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:40,120
and destruction of corpses.

481
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:43,000
 He abused the fact that he has no registration 

482
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,200
 and the crime methods were extremely cruel. 

483
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:50,270
 He shows no remorse for the crimes he committed 

484
00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:54,110
 and doesn't show even a hint of guilt. 

485
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:58,510
 Thus, the Court sentences him to death. 

486
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:19,260
 When we face our uncomrfortable past, 

487
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:25,600
 it's painful, but through the scars, we take a step forward. 

488
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,800
 Police Superintendent Eun Byeong Ho 

489
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,510
  When a second passes, 

490
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:35,610
  the present becomes the past, fairly for everyone. 

491
00:47:35,610 --> 00:47:38,610
  Some escape from their painful past, 

492
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:41,610
  and greet a new life.  

493
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:47,480
 And for another, they are forever trapped in the past, 

494
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:50,710
 ruining whatever remaining future they have left. 

495
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:19,400
The defendant has murdered three residents in the apartment and set the place on fire,

496
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:25,250
causing numerous residents to die or suffer property damage.

497
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:29,040
 The bereaved had to go through tremendous emotional distress 

498
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,460
 which cannot be cured throughout their lives, 

499
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:36,470
 which proves the cruelty of his crime. 

500
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:41,000
 Furthermore, he had confined his father purposely in order to murder him, 

501
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,350
 which should not be treated lightly. 

502
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:49,050
However, he confessed his crimes and asked the bereaved for forgiveness.

503
00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:54,580
He was confined and abused by his own father for nine years during his childhood.

504
00:48:54,580 --> 00:49:00,790
 Even after that, he had to continue hiding and running away for many years. 

505
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:05,490
When he committed the crimes, he was a minor

506
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:07,870
 and had a mental disorder called alexithymia. 

507
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:11,650
 Taking these facts into consideration, 

508
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:14,300
the Court sentences

509
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:20,710
the defendant, Kang Seong Mo, to 13 years in prison.

510
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:38,470
  We use every possible means to heal 

511
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:40,940
  our scars from the past. 

512
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:43,110
 But the scar remains 

513
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:45,620
  and becomes an unforgettable memory. 

514
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:47,700
  It requires too much time 

515
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:50,030
 to fade away. 

516
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:54,260
 This passing moment, 

517
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:59,080
  I wonder... What kind of memory this will be to me? 

518
00:50:10,350 --> 00:50:16,310
 One year later. 

519
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:24,770
♫  This unknown feeling, though I try to hide it   ♫

520
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:26,500
♫   I can't get a hold of it   ♫

521
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:30,000
♫   My heart is growing even today   ♫

522
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,430
♫   I only see you   ♫

523
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:38,390
Just how much longer are you going to sleep?

524
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:40,850
Until it's fully recharged.

525
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:43,550
Recharged, my foot.

526
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:46,220
You're only resting your head on my lap for a while. It's nothing.

527
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:49,050
What are you talking about? I was talking about my phone.

528
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:52,470
Until my phone's fully recharged.

529
00:50:52,470 --> 00:50:56,950
You said you'd study after resting a little, you slacker.

530
00:50:56,950 --> 00:51:02,130
♫  Trust me, Show me your heart   ♫

531
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:09,290
♫  Baby, I wanna stay with you  ♫

532
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:12,050
Is this really the only way?

533
00:51:12,050 --> 00:51:14,540
Is there really no way I can become a cop with just my abilities?

534
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:17,970
I told you. There are professional supervisors,

535
00:51:17,970 --> 00:51:21,520
but they all have at least a master's or doctoral degree.

536
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:25,630
This dirty world only acknowledges those with educational backgrounds. This has got to be reformed first.

537
00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:28,500
Even so, the detectives look for you so often.

538
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:33,450
Yesterday, Mr. Nam wanted your help, but I turned him down because you needed to study.

539
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:35,470
What sort of case is it?

540
00:51:40,450 --> 00:51:43,430
Just what are you doing here?

541
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:47,170
We arrested two homeless people who were residing in an abandoned house a few days ago.

542
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:51,350
According to them, someone is taking out life insurance on homeless people these days.

543
00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:55,350
They agreed to it for a small amount of money to buy drinks,

544
00:51:55,350 --> 00:51:57,770
without knowing that the money was the price for their lives.

545
00:51:57,770 --> 00:51:59,770
Why are you so obsessed with homeless people?

546
00:51:59,770 --> 00:52:03,630
Kang Geun Taek fabricated homeless people's ID cards and lived jobless his whole life.

547
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:08,250
I mean, we still haven't found out how he got the money to eat and live.

548
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:11,030
My theory is that he did it just like this.

549
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:13,320
Kang Geun Taek fabricated homeless people's ID cards

550
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:17,860
for his personal crime purposes and Dragon Head Hunting used that method as a group.

551
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:21,050
Likewise, some kind of huge organization must be involved in this.

552
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:24,030
Here, put this on.

553
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:27,420
My police exams are coming up soon. Have you forgotten?

554
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:29,750
Here, smell me.

555
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:34,130
- What is this?
 - Ugh, the smell!

556
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:35,510
I am perfectly ready!

557
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:37,280
Let's get started then.

558
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,580
- Yes, sir.
 - Yes, sir.

559
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:41,370
Here we go.

560
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:44,260
Let's start by drinking soju.

561
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:46,490
Are we really doing this?

562
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:04,250
Why are your faces like that?

563
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:08,560
What in the world? Where did this pretty flower and this

564
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:11,390
obvious beggar come from?

565
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:15,240
Sook Ja, I'm starving.

566
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:31,000
Though it's good that you're catching bad guys, take care of yourselves, at least.

567
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,400
I had your name cleared anyway,

568
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,180
so should I just quit?

569
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:37,320
Being a cop is much harder than I imagined.

570
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,270
I know you don't mean it.

571
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:42,350
If I lose you, I'll lose my entire group. So, don't even think about it.

572
00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:45,970
Dad, did you hear him? I'm this important.

573
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,160
Clean up fast and change your clothes.

574
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:53,020
It stinks up the house. Goodness.

575
00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:59,750
What's this? Why are the head officer's clothes in our house?

576
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:01,790
Well, these are your dad's.

577
00:54:01,790 --> 00:54:04,450
Those aren't mine.

578
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:05,690
Th-They aren't?

579
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:09,600
Ms. Oh, I guess nothing can be a perfect crime. Why don't we—

580
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,360
What are you talking about? Quickly now,

581
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:15,050
go and clean yourself. You too, clean yourself!

582
00:54:15,730 --> 00:54:16,950
I don't have underwear.

583
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:20,120
Just put on anything.

584
00:54:22,290 --> 00:54:24,330
 Seoheun Community and Security Center 

585
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:26,990
Why doesn't this kid Dae Bong answer his phone?

586
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:33,790
Hey, it's been a while!

587
00:54:33,790 --> 00:54:35,080
How's the work at the security center?

588
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:37,680
I got demoted to here. What do you expect?

589
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:42,770
If you ever see a good case,

590
00:54:42,770 --> 00:54:44,280
call me immediately.

591
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,300
Let's investigate together, okay?

592
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:48,370
- Okay. 
 - Promise?

593
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:53,510
It's not that I have a guilty conscience, by the way.

594
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:57,840
- Bye. 
 - Goodbye.

595
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:09,720
What's this, Lee Dae Bong?

596
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:12,240
Where are you?

597
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:19,570
♫  A tweeting mountain bird, in a singing  forest,  ♫

598
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:26,380
♫  A pretty baby squirrel was living there  ♫

599
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:31,600
Why are you always here instead of the gas station?

600
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:36,280
The gas station works fine without mebut they need me here.

601
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:40,230
Kids stop crying the moment I go in.

602
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:43,650
Give me the car keys.

603
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:45,420
For your exam tomorrow?

604
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:52,760
No. I have somewhere else to go.

605
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:55,310
Sure. Come back soon.

606
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:02,870
Hey! Dae Bong. What are you doing?

607
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:05,780
Oh.

608
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,370
Bye.

609
00:56:50,810 --> 00:56:53,820
I hear news from my mother now and then.

610
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:56,520
You joined the investigative team.

611
00:56:58,580 --> 00:57:01,300
Unofficially, but yes.

612
00:57:03,870 --> 00:57:08,800
You knew that... that this day would come, right?

613
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:12,860
That's why you came back for me,

614
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:18,740
had Jae In and I meet, and left my abilities to Jae In.

615
00:57:19,890 --> 00:57:21,990
After that day,

616
00:57:23,090 --> 00:57:26,420
a part of me must have wanted to become human.

617
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:29,550
I, who was born as a monster,

618
00:57:30,270 --> 00:57:32,720
fought every day.

619
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:35,290
 Hyung, I missed you! 

620
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:38,730
 If I say that I, a murderer, saved you, 

621
00:57:38,730 --> 00:57:42,390
 you'd feel utterly betrayed. 

622
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:47,430
 I stayed by your side despite what I had done 

623
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:50,170
and it made me feel like a monster.

624
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:55,240
But then again, I also worried about you,

625
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:58,720
even missed you.

626
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:04,160
When I came back for you,

627
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,910
it wasn't because I had planned all of this.

628
00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:11,010
Somehow, when I saved you,

629
00:58:11,010 --> 00:58:14,020
in the moment when you received your ability,

630
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:18,300
this all probably,

631
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,370
started then.

632
00:58:28,230 --> 00:58:30,180
It would've

633
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:33,940
been nice if someone would tell us.

634
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:37,240
Tell us that it's enough.

635
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:41,710
The resentment, hate,

636
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,130
and self-blame.

637
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:50,510
If only someone could tell us that it's all enough.

638
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:06,490
  2020 Police Officer Exam 

639
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:24,040
Did you forget that we were going to meet up?

640
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:25,770
Where are you? Did the test go well?

641
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:30,070
Forget about the exam. Dr. Hong suddenly requested my presence.

642
00:59:30,070 --> 00:59:31,970
 I'll finish up and then come to you. 

643
00:59:31,970 --> 00:59:33,830
Dr. Hong?

644
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,900
I told you corpses were off limits.

645
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:41,120
You wait right there! If you die, you'll die by my hands, you—

646
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,140
Did you fly here, Constable Yoon?

647
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:51,430
Dr. Hong, we've talked about this.

648
00:59:51,430 --> 00:59:54,330
He could die if he keeps on touching corpses.

649
00:59:54,330 --> 00:59:55,980
I know that too.

650
00:59:55,980 --> 01:00:00,350
Besides, I won't be calling him for a long time coming.

651
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:02,470
She offered to give me some books on legal medicine.

652
01:00:02,470 --> 01:00:04,080
  Legal Medicine 
Anatomy and Physiology 

653
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:07,160
Dr. Hong is taking a long vacation.

654
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:08,570
Vacation?

655
01:00:08,570 --> 01:00:12,120
I'm exhausted, that's all. The job isn't fun anymore either.

656
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:16,500
If I relax my mind, then a day when I want to come back should come.

657
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:19,600
Keep training him so that reading corpses

658
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:21,860
doesn't faze him until then.

659
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:23,840
Okay?

660
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:35,180
It's so nice!

661
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:40,540
The water pressure is good as well.

662
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:52,110
You had the kind of money to buy a house like this?

663
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:55,920
With my money, I think I could pay two-thirds of the price.

664
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:58,720
And the rest? Loan?

665
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,870
No, your money.

666
01:01:00,870 --> 01:01:02,100
Huh?

667
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:04,820
If you don't have any, we can just get a loan.

668
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:08,470
With the compensation my father received,

669
01:01:08,470 --> 01:01:11,430
I was thinking of buying my own place.

670
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:14,950
See, you need to move out of the Security Center too.

671
01:01:14,950 --> 01:01:17,310
You've stayed there long enough.

672
01:01:17,310 --> 01:01:23,160
So? Are you asking me to live with you?

673
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:27,180
Perfectly, there are three rooms. One for your dad,

674
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:29,990
one for me, and one for you and your aunt.

675
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:34,020
Also, I saw that your aunt is also going to move out soon.

676
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:36,490
She's just looking for the right time.

677
01:01:36,490 --> 01:01:39,700
Could it be, with President Nam?

678
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:51,330
Let's live together, Jae In.

679
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:56,420
I don't like living alone. It's lonely.

680
01:01:56,420 --> 01:01:59,580
If, by any chance, you find living together uncomfortable because of my abilities—

681
01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:01,870
No, I'm not uncomfortable at all!

682
01:02:01,870 --> 01:02:04,910
I love it! Love, love, love it!

683
01:02:04,910 --> 01:02:07,660
I'm buying a house!

684
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:13,590
♫   Rather than many consolations   ♫

685
01:02:13,590 --> 01:02:19,750

687

  Noradrenaline is what makes us store bad memories. 

688
01:02:28,290 --> 01:02:31,610
  Do you know what the opposite of that is? 

689
01:02:32,810 --> 01:02:34,230
  I don't know. 

690
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:36,130
 It's beta-endorphins. 

691
01:02:36,130 --> 01:02:41,110
  It helps you store good memories the more you laugh. 

692
01:02:41,110 --> 01:02:46,020
 Oh, Lee Ahn, you know all kinds of things now. 

693

01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:07,210
♫   Lay on me and take a rest for a moment   ♫

696
01:03:07,210 --> 01:03:13,440
Dr. Hong must still be having a hard time because of her memories of Ji Soo.

697
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:16,520
I just hope it doesn't take her long to move on.

698
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:18,520
You should let go of it now too.

699
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:23,320
I know that you've only been studying instead of diving into the cases with us.

416.666666667 days have already passed.

Finish it up.

702
01:03:41,830 --> 01:03:44,740
  Who is responsible! Wife is in a coma and the baby died during labor.
