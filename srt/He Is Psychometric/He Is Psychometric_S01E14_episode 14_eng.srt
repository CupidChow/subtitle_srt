1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,570


2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,360
 He is Psychometric 

3
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:40,870
 He is Psychometric 

4
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,800
  You said you wouldn't kill them if I came. 

5
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,500
  I was  

6
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,860
  only trying what Kang Seong Mo did—like my son. 

7
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:02,640
  If your efforts made this kid human, then I should be human too. 

8
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,070
  What are you trying to say?  

9
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:07,840
  The Yeongseong Apartment murder, I am saying  

10
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,300
  that it's not what I did.  

11
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,900
  Just like me,  

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,330
  if it's a child without emotions, 

13
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,390
  wouldn't it be possible?  

14
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,650
That's a lie.

15
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,650
There is no way.

16
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:35,460
Kang Geun Taek lied, right?

17
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,850
Hurry and tell me that Hyung didn't do it!

18
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:59,030
Did Hyung tell you about my abilities, too?

19
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,160
I told you.

20
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,660
The places where you can hide,

21
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,930
I've already figured it all out.

22
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:06,050
 Psychometry: An ability to measure and interpret the essence or history of a person or thing through touch. 

23
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:08,170
 He is Psychometric
- Episode 14 - 

24
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:12,700
I said that the Yeongseong Apartment, the Hanmin Care Home, it was all him.

25
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,690
He did it to try to take me.

26
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,790
Then why was Hyung at the Hanmin Care Home?

27
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,600
That didn't happen. It couldn't happen.

28
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,460
I have never met Seong Mo once!

29
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:26,290
Then how did you know about Kang Geun Taek's information about the third basement level at Saeki-dong Station?

30
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,200
How do you know about it now when you didn't know about it in the basement?

31
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,030
Lee Ahn, stop it.

32
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,700
Take her.

33
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,750
If you want to join this case, you have to cool yourself down.

34
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,390
What kind of anger are you taking out here?

35
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:05,290
Memories sometimes deceive themselves

36
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,720
to favor oneself.

37
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:14,710
No matter how much you may be in agony, if you don't look straight ahead,

38
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:18,520
the same mistakes will happen again.

39
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:30,430
Telling the truth is the only way to save you and Prosecutor Kang.

40
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,420
Please remember.

41
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:49,460
There is no way Hyung could have done that.

42
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,090
Kang Geun Taek is deceiving us.

43
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,640
  Doctor Hong  

44
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:11,090
There isn't anything special about the cause of death. It's just like the victims of Yeongseong Apartment and Hanmin Care Home.

45
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,460
Doctor Hong.

46
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:18,950
I know it's different from doing psychometry on other bodies.

47
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,760
It's up to you to decide.

48
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:30,770
  Hong Soo Yeon  

49
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,260
 Choi Yong Hye (Women's Association) 

50
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,280
  Yoo Eun Ok  

51
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:43,800
  Telephone
Lee Ahn  

52
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:07,200
  Lee Ahn, do you even know what you just saw? 

53
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,290
  Come here. I'll kill you.  

54
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:12,120
  Why can't I resolve it on my own? I have this.  

55
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,160
  Okay, okay, okay, okay.  

56
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,280
  - Who doesn't know you like Hyung? 
 - So embarassing.  

57
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,670
 I'd like you to take care of it officially. 

58
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,730
  Psychometrist Lee Ahn.  

59
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:27,630
  Thank you so, so much, Noona.  

60
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:30,870
  - Let go. 
 - I love you.  

61
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,030
  Kang Seong Mo, let go of that knife.  

62
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:44,620
  - Don't come this way. 
 - Please drop the knife!  

63
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,800
  No!  

64
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,880
  Ji Soo... Come to your senses.  

65
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:01,020
  We found your mom. So let's go back.  

66
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:05,290
  So please go back with me.  

67
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:09,000
  No, no... 

68
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:49,450
  Kangryung Iron Factory Confinement Case  

69
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,070
What is all this?

70
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:55,330
We went to look for Kang Geun Taek at the Saeki-dong station and found this.

71
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:58,600
- Did you get the results from the forensic team? 
 - The results came out, but...

72
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,030
Take a look first.

73
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:04,580
They're all Kang Geun Taek's. He must have been all over those ghost stations.

74
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:07,230
That's what I thought at first too.

75
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:11,960
But Ahn said that Prosecutor Kang brought these things.

76
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,160
Prosecutor Kang?

77
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,680
How did this guy find out about it?

78
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,480
What did the National Forensic Service say? Did Prosecutor Kang's fingerprints show up?

79
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:25,790
These metal chains are the evidence for the confinement and murder case of Kim Gab Yong in Kangryung.

80
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:29,080
This knife is evidence for the Hanmin Care Home case.

81
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:34,700
  Hanmin Care Home Fire Murder case 
I checked the evidence room and found out that Prosecutor Kang took this evidence a long time ago.

82
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,270
These are the pieces of evidence involved in this case?

83
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:42,110
You want me to properly solve this entangled case?

84
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:45,000
We'll have a general meeting early tomorrow so prepare for it, Constable Yoon.

85
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,770
- Yes, I will. 
 - I will prepare the meeting.

86
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,550
I also understand this case to a certain extent.

87
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:53,900
No, you can't just understand a certain extent. You need to be sure.

88
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,190
What about Ahn?

89
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,900
Can I join the meeting together with Ahn?

90
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:05,590
If he's going to jump around agitated like before, he doesn't even have to see more memories.

91
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:10,160
- Memories? 
 - If you can calm him down, bring him in then.

92
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,730
What memories?

93
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,150
What on earth is this guy?

94
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,770
Lee Ahn!

95
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,210
Where did he go?

96
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:54,030
The bag at Saeki-dong station had evidence from the confinement case, the Hanmin Care Home case,

97
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:57,110
and the Kim Gab Yong case?
- Yeah.

98
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:03,060
I feel like Prosecutor Kang keeps leading us to these past cases.

99
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:08,260
But earlier,

100
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,640
why were you so agitated at Kang Eun Joo?

101
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:17,270
When Kang Geun Taek met Kang Eun Joo at the Hanmin Care Home,

102
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:20,270
- he talked about Yeongseong Apartment.
- What?

103
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:24,750
It's true that he was thinking about preparing Kang Eun Joo's fake dead body and setting the fire,

104
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,550
but the one to do it wasn't him,

105
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,850
but Seong Mo Hyung.

106
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:37,800
I'm sure that's not true. Prosecutor Kang wouldn't do that.

107
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:40,930
Because Kang Eun Joo heard that from Kang Geun Taek,

108
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:44,670
it seems that she's lying for Seong Mo Hyung's sake, whether it's true or not.

109
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:49,120
While Kang Eun Joo changed her identity from Park Soo Young to Kang Hee Sook and Kim Song Hee,

110
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,510
we need to find evidence that Prosecutor Kang met her.

111
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,440
You don’t need evidence, I saw it all.

112
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,200
The memories you saw are not legally valid.

113
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,300
If we want to use it for the investigation and to make Kang Eun Joo talk,

114
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,050
we need to find the real thing.

115
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:07,270
It doesn't even help when my ability grows.

116
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:11,050
Is that why you were here by yourself?

117
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:13,890
I went to the autopsy room.

118
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:18,560
Noona was always warm but,

119
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,790
she was so cold. I was frightened.

120
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:28,760
I hope she left with only good memories.

121
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:33,210
Was there a memory of the murder scene, too?

122
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:36,490
It’s true that Kang Geun Taek killed Noona.

123
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:40,610
Even though Noona asked Hyung to go back,

124
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:44,590
even though it was her last will, he disappeared.

125
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,940
I keep getting bad thoughts. It's ominous.

126
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:52,280
Ahn, forget what Kang Geun Taek told Kang Eun Joo at the Hanmin Care Home.

127
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,980
He could have been lying to take Kang Eun Joo.

128
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,540
I’d like to think so too, but

129
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:03,490
everything I've seen makes me doubt Hyung.

130
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:29,680
Lee Ahn, these are just short clues that you've seen.

131
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,400
What do you think would be the word completed with this?

132
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,440
Trap.

133
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,880
Yeah.

134
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,840
It's clearly a trap as of now.

135
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:44,380
A trap that can tie you up.

136
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,390
But if...

137
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,640
If we do it like this,

138
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,970
it's a sail. Something that makes a boat move forward.

139
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:57,580
But in the opposite way,

140
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,500
these letters also make the word anchor which stops the ship.

141
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,160
Trap, sail,

142
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,230
and anchor.

143
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:22,580
We have to go to the end to find out what the completed letters mean.

144
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,610
If you sit down like this,

145
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:27,240
you can't complete any letters.

146
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:41,030
Wait, the cases that Seong Mo Hyung brought to his room...

147
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,610
there was one more thing besides the panhandler case.

148
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,840
 Homeless Murder Case 

149
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,610
You mean he brought all the data about the homeless murder cases on purpose?

150
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:54,120
Like the panhandler case?

151
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,580
Wasn't there anything strange here?

152
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,600
If Kang Geun Taek had changed his ID by using the homeless,

153
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,370
I just guessed.

154
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:08,090
ID change, ID change...

155
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,740
Wait a second.

156
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:14,740
Don't tell me it was the case with the Dragon Head Hunting?

157
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:19,630
The Dragon Employment Agency case that Lieutenant Nam rounded up?

158
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:22,100
Yeah, that was the case I was taking care of.

159
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,730
It was a gang that used the homeless and vagabonds for identity theft and murder,

160
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,650
but Kim Gab Yong was released due to lack of evidence.

161
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,700
You need to have talent and tricks for the police to cover you.

162
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,730
If the prosecutor in charge was Prosecutor Kang,

163
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:39,270
then it means he knew Kim Gab Yong who helped Kim Eun Joo with the ID change from the beginning.

164
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:42,410
If Hyung knew since a long time ago that Kang Eun Joo was alive,

165
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:46,390
then I'm sure that Kim Gab Yong was the person he needed the most.

166
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,850
But Prosecutor Kang

167
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:53,300
acted like he didn't know anything about Kim Gab Yong, in front of us.

168
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,600
Things sure are going uneasy.

169
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,750
  I'm sorry but that person doesn't want any further trouble.  

170
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:05,620
  I could kill you here, but without you,  

171
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,660
  I would lose my top customer.  

172
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:13,500
Lieutenant Nam, let me meet Kang Eun Joo again.

173
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,620
What, kid?

174
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,300
I will never press against her will.

175
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,120
If Hyung really instigated the murder of Park Soo Young and Kang Hee Sook,

176
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,680
and even committed the Yeongseong Apartment arson,

177
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,560
then Kang Eun Joo will just be as confused as now.

178
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,890
I'm the one who can understand Kang Eun Joo the most right now.

179
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,310
  The murder of a detective at a ghost station  

180
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:41,260
  has been revealed to be involved  in the murder cases of Yeongseong Apartment and Hanmin Care Home 

181
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,390
 and has caused a great shock.  

182
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,320
 It's been three days since the incident 

183
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,510
 but the whereabouts of the suspect, Kang Geun Taek, are still unknown. 

184
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:51,540
 The police publicly opened a search for Mr. Kang yesterday afternoon, 

185
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:54,100
 and although an exclusive team has been formed to investigate, 

186
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,920
 it has been reported that there is no progress in the investigation. 

187
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:02,120
Where are we?

188
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,950
When I came out of the basement

189
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:11,570
do you know what the first thing I discovered was?

190
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,930
This thing called relationships between people,

191
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:22,290
like the fairytale that my mother read,

192
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,940
I realized it was not simple.

193
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,530
Relationships.

194
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:30,260
People are in numerous relationships,

195
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:34,740
to get what they want, and they have to pay for it.

196
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:39,540
What are you trying to say?

197
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:48,180
The fact that you are a criminal without a resident registration,

198
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,240
it was an administrative loophole for the country.

199
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:04,360
So the investigators quietly filled that hole.

200
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,650
Our lousy wounds

201
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,880
were beyond their priority.

202
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,890
So If I had been caught back then,

203
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:15,870
you mean you wouldn't have come all the way until here?

204
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,710
To watch over my mother,

205
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:24,150
and to find you, I became a prosecutor, but

206
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,450
I've been constantly thinking.

207
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:33,500
Will the social order impose a reasonable punishment?

208
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:40,280
Or will I put blood on my hands?

209
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:48,460
So you're going to make me pay the same price for it?

210
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:52,220
Just like what you and Eun Joo had to go through?

211
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:55,620
The same revenge has no meaning.

212
00:19:55,620 --> 00:20:00,060
You have to suffer more than that for it to be real.

213
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:07,810
Soon, the wound will throb and fester,

214
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:11,270
and you'll gradually rot away.

215
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:13,640
What to do?

216
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:18,870
I still don't know what pain is.

217
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,070
Don’t worry.

218
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:29,360
I will definitely make sure you'll feel it.

219
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:38,480
Kang Geun Taek - suspected of imprisoning Kang Eun Joo and Prosecutor Kang in a basement for 9 years.
   Kang Eun Joo, Kang Seong Mo, Suspect Kang Geun Taek (alias) identity unknown. 

220
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,690
We're assuming he was part of a panhandling ring as a child.

221
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:46,990
As a result, they can't confirm his real name or resident registration.

222
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:49,410
During the time of her escape in the year of '96,
  '96 Kangryung Police Station content of Kang Eun Joo's statement - Kang Geun Taek -&gt; alexithymia 

223
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:51,730
Kang Eun Joo stated that Kang Geun Taek has a alexithymia,
  Obsession &amp;  imprisonment 

224
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:56,100
and testified that he was obsessed with and imprisoned her after having feelings toward her for the first time.

225
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,580
Yeongsoeong Apartment and Hanmin Care Home, too,

226
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:02,580
are claimed to have been acts committed by Kang Geun Taek because of Kang Eun Joo.

227
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:11,310
 There will be a general meeting tomorrow morning. 

228
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:15,680
 I will leave the fewest police officers there as possible, so see you then. 

229
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,490
For Kang Geun Taek to find the missing Kang Eun Joo,

230
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:38,150
he has been lingering around his son Kang Seong Mo for a long time.

231
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:42,070
In order to pressure her, he has hurt and kidnapped surrounding people,

232
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:46,560
and in the end, he killed Detective Eun Ji Soo.

233
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,680
Thus far, all the circumstantial evidence is

234
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,690
pointing toward the suspect Kang Geun Taek, but...

235
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,890
But?

236
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:02,410
Kang Eun Joo's son, Prosecutor Kang Seong Mo,

237
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:04,550
cannot be ruled out as a suspect.

238
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:06,520
What does that mean?

239
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,610
Why is Prosecutor Kang Seong Mo a suspect?

240
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:11,900
Prosecutor Kang Seong Mo knew that Kang Eun Joo was alive.

241
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:17,090
Besides, there is a connection with Kim Gab Yong who has helped Kang Eun Joo change her identity.

242
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:18,370
So, what's the direction of investigation from this point onward?

243
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:23,220
Currently, Kang Geun Taek is being traced by Kang Seong Mo and the end goal is,

244
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:26,030
murder. Rather than Kang Geun Taek,

245
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:30,570
I think it would be much faster to track down Prosecutor Kang Seong Mo.

246
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,910
No, but don't you think Prosecutor Kang became a prosecutor to catch Kang Geun Taek?

247
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:42,670
So why can't he just catch him and put him away, why does he have to kill him?

248
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:47,620
Who missed what would have been done if we had caught him and put him away?

249
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:51,840
How should I take on a person that suddenly takes off his handcuffs and chokes me?

250
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,430
If it was you, what would you have done?

251
00:22:55,870 --> 00:23:00,880
That's why Prosecutor Kang doesn't believe in

252
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,690
the law, police, or justice.

253
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:07,130
When the confinement case was left unsolved and with Kang Eun Joo's body switched with another

254
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:12,370
during the Yeongseong Apartment fire, nothing was able to reveal the truth.

255
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:16,920
Rather, they didn't even consider trying.

256
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,660
I don't know where to start.

257
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:25,570
I don't know the way back well because I naturally always progress straight ahead to whatever I see.

258
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:31,390
I'll tell you honestly that I'm here to persuade you.

259
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:34,440
At first, I didn't know what was going on so I thought my head was going to explode.

260
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:41,500
I decided not to be sure of anything until I meet Hyung and hear everything personally.

261
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,980
Whatever Seong Mo did,

262
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,300
it was all so that I could live.

263
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,480
Seong Mo did nothing wrong.

264
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:56,490
If so, this is the time you should be the one willing to do anything for him,

265
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:58,650
isn't it?

266
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:06,710
I saw someone in the cellar saying that he shouldn't kill that person.

267
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:10,370
I also want to at least block Hyung from murdering, no matter what.

268
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:16,060
Whether it is forgiveness or understanding or resentment, I'll think about that later.

269
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,850
Hyung

270
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:24,360
knew that you were alive, didn't he?

271
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:36,170
So this is what happened because the police didn't work well, right?

272
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:38,310
You really hit your seniors in the bone.

273
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,930
At my age, isn't that when blood is hot by nature? Don't worry about it.

274
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:44,650
Worry about it and engrave it in your bones.

275
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:47,570
Have you guys ever fabricated cases according to your tastes while eating police food?

276
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:50,650
Have you ever given up on a case to leave it unsolved?

277
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:54,900
If you're confident you haven't even a single time, raise your hand!

278
00:24:55,690 --> 00:25:00,790
Honestly, I am not confident. There surely must be somebody, it's just that everyone is hiding it.

279
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:05,600
Don't be ashamed when you're caught and just do it properly now. Go!

280
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:12,320
Constable Yoon, go to Lee Ahn and check to see if he's heard anything from Kang Eun Joo.

281
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,750
Yes, sir.

282
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:23,600
 The memories you saw are not legally valid.   

283
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:29,510
 The real thing must be found in order for the investigation to make Kang Eun Joo talk. 

284
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:36,960
We need to find some real evidence.

285
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:46,060
 I planned on not coming back to Korea. 

286
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:49,330
He thought of not coming back.

287
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:56,240
What did Kang Eun Joo say?

288
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:00,090
Don't be too nervous.

289
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:02,120
It's only just beginning.

290
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:07,760
Jae In, is there any chance that Kang Eun Joo, while living as Park Soo Young or Kang Hee Sook...

291
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,560
Do you think we can see the immigration records?

292
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,420
Yes, if we find the entry and departure records—

293
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,600
I'll call you.

294
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:26,080


295
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,730
It's here.

296
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,340
 Republic of Korea Passport
Surname: Kang
Given names: Seong Mo
Nationality: Republic of Korea
Date of birth: 24 May 1988
Sex: M 

297
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:47,790
I found it. While Kang Eun Joo was living as Park Soo Young,

298
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:51,500
she was in Canada from January 2009 to December 2013.

299
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:55,570
So my suspicions were right. Hyung was also in Canada for an exchange at that time.

300
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:59,840
He came back in 2010 but even after that he has been to Canada multiple times.

301
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,090
And the last day he entered the country,

302
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:05,770
December 1st, 2013.

303
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:09,690
Kang Eun Joo entered the country on the 2nd of December by one day difference.

304
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:14,070
She would have been safe if they stayed.

305
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:16,490
Why would they suddenly come back?

306
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:21,630
Lieutenant Nam, was it perhaps the winter of 2013

307
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:23,660
when you investigated Kim Gab Yong's organization for the homeless murder case?

308
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,650
Yes, that's right, winter of 2013.

309
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:30,770
I think that she returned because her identity might have been revealed when the police started investigating Kim Gab Yong's organization.

310
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:33,470
Then, she changed her name again to Kang Hee Sook.

311
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:39,440
And Kim Gab Yong murdered Park Soo Young and Kang Hee Sook to prevent future trouble.

312
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,400
The person Kim Gab Yong was talking about

313
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,280
was Hyung.

314
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:56,440
 I saw someone in the cellar saying that he shouldn't kill that person. 

315
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:01,030
 I also want to at least block Hyung from murdering, no matter what. 

316
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:05,610
 This is the time you should be the one willing to do anything for him, 

317
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:07,600
 isn't it? 

318
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:13,550
 You must remember the incident where a detective lost her life at a ghost station a while back. 

319
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:19,540
 In addition to the detective murder incident at the ghost station, the fires at Yeongseong Apartment and Hanmin Care Home, 

320
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:22,090
 and the incident from 1996, in Gangryeong-si, Gangwon-do... 

321
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:25,100
How do things keep coming up like this?

322
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,800
The confinement incident?

323
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,590
So they're saying that that is related to Yeongseong Apartment?

324
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:34,600
So does that mean that Jae In is investigating all of these cases?

325
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,540
Even the Yeongseong Apartment case?

326
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,590
Seems to be that way.

327
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:42,530
The Yeongseong Apartment incident was years ago.

328
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:47,360
And that confinement case, whatever it is, happened 20 years ago.

329
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,750
This kid might come back after suffering in vain.

330
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:54,430
I should ask my dad one more time, too.

331
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:59,540
If the person that covered me with the security guard uniform was really Jae In's dad.

332
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:02,430
But you've lived all this time without talking to your father.

333
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:08,210
But if I don't step up during a reinvestigation like this, everything might come to nothing.

334
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:13,180
Would you do that, then?

335
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:18,390
Yes, ma'am here is your bill.

336
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,490
And also, this.

337
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:24,200
You would have seen today's news, right?

338
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,740
This is about the case that my friend is investigating.

339
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:31,250
If you see a guy like this, please alert the authorities as soon as possible.

340
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:33,450
Thank you.

341
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,940
Isn't this a bit much?

342
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,830
What's a bit much?

343
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:44,070
You can't say that if you know what sort of noona the late detective was to my friend.

344
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,150
This guy right here, he followed one lady for her entire life like a madman,

345
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:52,780
then killed the people around him and set things on fire.

346
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:55,900
That's crazy. How could someone do something like that out of love?

347
00:29:55,900 --> 00:30:00,260
It's just that if the other person thinks of 'me' as gruesome,

348
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:03,980
giving up completely is the right thing to do.

349
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,650
That's what I mean.

350
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,890
Let's just think about the facts.

351
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:13,730
Only the facts that I've seen.

352
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:24,220
Although Hyung knew that Kang Eun Joo was alive at the time of the Yeongseong Apartment fire,

353
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:27,360
he reported her as dead.

354
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,590
Kim Gab Yong even killed Park Soo Young and Kang Hee Sook,

355
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:34,100
to change Kang Eun Joo's identity.

356
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:37,100
 But the higher-up doesn't want any future trouble. 

357
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:41,850
Hyung saved Kang Eun Joo from Hanmin Care Home.

358
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,920
Then next...

359
00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:00,260
Okay. Then this is evidence that Prosecutor Kang knew that Kang Eun Joo was alive.

360
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,800
How about lie detection?

361
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:07,950
If it's proven that Kang Eun Joo is lying, wouldn't we be able to extend the period of custody a little more?

362
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:11,260
Not only is the custody investigation period running out, but there's also the possibility of escape, too.

363
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:16,630
More than anything else, I think her leaving with Kang Geun Taek not arrested will be more dangerous.

364
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:18,680
Lie detectors have nearly no legal power.

365
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:23,270
There's no use in getting new information if we know for sure that Kang Eun Joo is lying, either.

366
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:26,890
Then, can we keep her in custody based on her current crimes?

367
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:30,300
Forging official documents, living under a false identity, and obstruction of justice.

368
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,860
Are those enough for a warrant?

369
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:34,000
I would do it but don't know what'll happen.

370
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,480
A woman who was confined for nine years is actually alive,

371
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,830
but the culprit is still at large.

372
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,860
The public is already petitioning that the government release her,

373
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:45,200
and punish the police for our incompetence. They're not fond of us right now.

374
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,490
I found him!

375
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:50,360
Prosecutor Kang was at the hospital to see Detective Eun.

376
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,590
He left the hospital at 5:45 p.m.

377
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:55,060
I have him on camera crossing the street.

378
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:58,780
I want a detailed timeline of his movements. This isn't some alleyway, but the middle of the city.

379
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:01,470
Only a ghost could evade all the cameras.

380
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:04,670
Don't you dare lose sight of him! Come on!

381
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:19,430
Ah! I found Prosecutor Kang.

382
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:22,230
At 6:10PM, he headed towards Bangji 3-ro.

383
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:25,100
Yes, this is the police. Are you the owner of car 3344?

384
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,490
Three days ago, you parked at Banji 3-ro.

385
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:29,250
May I check your black box footage?

386
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:32,540
I found him. HQ Convenience store at 7:20PM, headed in the 4 o'clock direction.

387
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,830
Kangkook 3-dong. Check areas A3, A8, and A7.

388
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:37,210
He entered Seomun Motel at 8:35 pm.

389
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:40,200
- The time he left?
 - Ten minutes later.

390
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:46,880
Keep tracking Kang Seong Mo from when he left the motel.

391
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,710
- Okay, Constable Yoon let's go. 
 - Yes.

392
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,410
Ahn, we tracked Prosecutor Kang.

393
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:55,630
Where is that?

394
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:07,430
The owner said that Prosecutor Kang stayed here for three days.

395
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:11,160
It's already been cleaned. This is why I hate neat people.

396
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,190
I'll ask where the trash was taken.

397
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:15,850
Ahn, you stay here and look for clues.

398
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:17,510
Here?

399
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:20,340
He came back here even though he was in a hurry.

400
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:24,240
Maybe there was something urgent he needed.

401
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,370
Okay.

402
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:40,240
- Does he read not only people's memories but also memories of objects? 
 - Yes.

403
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,130
He sure is gifted.

404
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:56,510
  The trash? I threw it out in front of the door.  

405
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:59,640
  I'm think the garbage truck is already gone.  

406
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:04,810
It's here. Constable Yoon!

407
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:57,190
It's a picture of Kang Geun Taek.

408
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:07,100
What is this?

409
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,380
It seems like a medicine bottle.

410
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,590
I think this medicine was in there.

411
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:45,760
 Kooyang Hospital  

412
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,180
  Jangseok Redevelopment Promotion Area  

413
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,370
  Uinam Villa 
Uinam Traditional Market 

414
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:50,070
  Joongi-dong Apartment  

415
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,100
A map?

416
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,480
Just a second.

417
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,640
  Constable Yoon  

418
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,750
Say it again.

419
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:06,100
It's the Joongi-dong Apartment, Uinam Villa, the Uinam Traditional Market and the Kooyang Hospital.

420
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,340
Just a second, Joongi-dong Apartment is here.

421
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:11,810
And the Uinam Villa should be... Uinam Villa!

422
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:14,500
We found the Uinam Traditional Market and the Kooyang Hospital.

423
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:18,800
Wait, two months ago there was a fire at the Uinam Traditional Market so it is empty.

424
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,600
  The apartment in Joongi-dong is also being redeveloped.  

425
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:24,970
So that means all of these places are places where people don't go.

426
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:27,990
I went to patrol in this area from time to time so I know it.

427
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:30,350
  - Detective Park, check the Kooyang Hospital and the Uinam Villa. 
 - Yes.  

428
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:34,240
Are these places possibly all close to Kangkook Station?

429
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,830
  Yeah, that's right.  

430
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:40,170
Hyung thinks that Kang Geun Taek is probably hiding in one of these places.

431
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:43,900
Do you think he is prepared to lose Kang Geun Taek at Kangkook Station?

432
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:47,680
Take a picture of the map and send it to me. And split up the places and search.

433
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,310
So where should we go?

434
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:59,680
For the first time in a while, let me prepare my senses.

435
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,030
- The closest place to Kangkook Station first—  
 - No, the Kooyang Hospital.

436
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,940
Right, I also feel that way.

437
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,700
Because Kang Geun Taek has a gunshot wound.

438
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:10,220
Right. You can clean a toilet but always leave something behind.

439
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:15,300
He'll have gone to a hospital and taken something that would help him.

440
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:45,770
I think I've at least given

441
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:49,730
some medicine for you and Eun Joo.

442
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:51,720
Right.

443
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:55,820
I don't even know what pain is,

444
00:37:56,690 --> 00:38:01,930
but my mother begs you for medicine every time I seem to have a problem with my body.

445
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:04,870
Then I had to listen to what you wanted in return.

446
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:07,430
You and Eun Joo...

447
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:10,010
I have protected you from a dangerous world,

448
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:13,030
and this is the price for it?

449
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:19,890
The only thing that saved my mother was the hope to go outside.

450
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,030
But going out in this world,

451
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:25,940
my mother lost even that.

452
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:30,100
She blamed herself even though it was not her fault.

453
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:35,020
'Why did so many people have to die because of me?'

454
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:39,340
The reason why my mother, the victim had to suffer

455
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:43,200
was because the assailant didn't pay the consequences of his sins.

456
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,880
I only discovered it later.

457
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,310
Why don't you

458
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:53,260
make Eun Joo watch my body rot instead?

459
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:56,150
If this is my end,

460
00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:00,610
even with this rotting body,

461
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:04,880
I want to see Eun Joo one last time.

462
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:10,460
  Kooyang Hospital  

463
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:16,200
Lee Ahn, you stay here.

464
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:01,920
You living to see my mother,

465
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:06,370
will never happen.

466
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:31,870
  Kang Geun Taek came to this place.  

467
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,940
And...

468
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,290
Hyung too.

469
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:14,990
Yes, I understand.

470
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:21,510
They didn't find anything at the other locations either.

471
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:24,580
Is this guy the only one to trust now?

472
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:02,930
 I told you the places where you can hide, 

473
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:06,160
 I've already figured them all out. 

474
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:32,670
 An anesthetic injection? 

475
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:35,920
I think Hyung found Kang Geun Taek and took him somewhere.

476
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:40,910
But there was nothing found in the other locations from the map.

477
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:42,450
Where did he take him?

478
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:45,530
There's no way there would be surveillance cameras here.

479
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:47,350
I think we're lost here.

480
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:49,750
Let's go back to the police station first.

481
00:42:56,580 --> 00:43:02,760
  Obituary. 
 Lieutenant Eun will be laid to rest at the National Cemetary. 

482
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,900
Salute the deceased!

483
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:03,400
 Lieutenant Eun Ji Soo 

484
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,230
I'm sorry the funeral was so late.

485
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:31,580
I must have kept Ji Soo with me for too long.

486
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:38,730
I've heard you're working together with the investigation. How is it going?

487
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:43,750
I'm still no help.

488
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:47,570
No, you're doing good enough.

489
00:44:47,570 --> 00:44:52,810
I'm sure Detective Eun thinks the same way.

490
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:57,210
And there are still no traces of Prosecutor Kang?

491
00:44:57,210 --> 00:44:58,680
No.

492
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,670
Here.

493
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:05,730
Has it been checked?

494
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:08,740
I discovered Kang Seong Mo's fingerprints on the medicine bottle.

495
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:13,250
And the medicine is called fluvoxamine which is a serotonin reabsorbent.

496
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:18,850
It's a drug used for impulse control or anger control.

497
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:25,250
The reason that Hyung has been taking medicine for that time was not for headaches but for anger control?

498
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:28,770
So does that must mean Hyung is completely free from alexithymia.

499
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:31,610
It doesn't seem like it's only a good thing.

500
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:35,770
Prosecutor Kang doesn't take this medicine and threw it away.

501
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:40,050
Which also means he is not going to calm his anger anymore.

502
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52,070
You think this is going to make me feel pain?

503
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:54,960
It's better than not doing anything at all.

504
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,810
But too bad...

505
00:45:57,810 --> 00:46:01,710
The kid who thinks you're a lifesaver

506
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:04,840
might start to doubt you.

507
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:10,650
As doubt grows, it will turn into assurance, and eventually anger.

508
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:16,790
This kid will be desperate to find you and me.

509
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:20,560
Though I don't know if you're going to be able to endure until then.

510
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:35,920
The investigation isn't easy.

511
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,480
There's much pressure from the higher-ups.

512
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,550
Because of the fact that the suspect Kang Geun Taek doesn't have a resident registration,

513
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:46,710
there is an uproar from the Ministry of Public Administration and Security,

514
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:50,650
and the media is beginning to chatter about the poor construction of the Yeongseong Apartment.

515
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:55,800
Now they'll probably begin special investigation tending YSS Construction.

516
00:46:55,800 --> 00:47:01,050
Dae Nam. As soon as someone else takes my place, the investigation is over.

517
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:04,920
I'll take the handcuffs once the case is over

518
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:09,110
so hang in there till then. I'll bear it as well.

519
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:23,650
It feels like an excuse now but, at first I thought that Yoon Tae Ha was the real culprit.

520
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:25,700
I was sure of it.

521
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:29,160
  To the stairs!  

522
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:30,560
  Go to the stairs.  

523
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,190
  Keep your body down as much as you can.  

524
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:34,180
  Keep your body down as much as you can.  

525
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:36,460
  Keep your body down as much as you can.  

526
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:40,430
  Keep your body down as much as you can.  

527
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:45,120
  One of the residents said that they were given a uniform by Yoon Tae Ha to cover their mouth 

528
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,800
  and showed us the bloodstained uniform. 

529
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,730
  You're fired from today!  

530
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:53,660
  There was also a talk about a fight with the women's association.  

531
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:56,450
Everything was resolving smoothly.

532
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:05,170
  Mr. Eun Byung Ho,  

533
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:09,330
  This is from YSS construction.  

534
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:16,780
  He said it was a simple incentive to conclude the case quickly.  

535
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:20,280
  The sum was not big so I did not think it was dirty money,  

536
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,830
  since I wasn't ashamed of the investigation. 

537
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:27,740
 But,
- The person I told you about, did you find him? 

538
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:30,030
  I told you. There was no such person. 

539
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:32,100
  I certainly saw him. 

540
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:36,310
 Across the apartment that day, he was watching our place. 

541
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:40,530
  Kang Seong Mo came to me multiple times saying that the culprit was someone else. 

542
00:48:40,530 --> 00:48:43,710
I had heard about the Kangryung-si confinement case as well.

543
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:46,560
But you probably couldn't have started a reinvestigation.

544
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:52,970
Even the congressmen that turned a blind eye to the poor construction of YSS Construction,

545
00:48:52,970 --> 00:48:57,310
were busy bribing me, out of fear,

546
00:48:57,310 --> 00:49:00,320
in case I'd investigate the case again.

547
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:13,050
  Detective Eun's watch 

548
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:18,120
When I heard that the police lost the man that killed Ji Soo,

549
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:22,100
do you know what I thought?

550
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:28,050
That it would be obvious for the limbs to malfunction

551
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:30,770
when the head is rotten.

552
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:54,020
So those are the notes on my psychometry.

553
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:56,490
You knew about it?

554
00:49:56,490 --> 00:49:58,060
Yeah.

555
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:05,690
Why would Prosecutor Kang give this to me?

556
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:09,090
If I think of it as a trap as you said,

557
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:13,320
he might have tamed me to use for investigation.

558
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:17,180
What about thinking of it as a sail?

559
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:20,170
- Maybe because he feels sorry? 
- Feels sorry?

560
00:50:20,170 --> 00:50:24,010
The fire occurred because of his mom in the end,

561
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:29,750
and because of that, you and I became victims.

562
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:35,090
Then, I want to think of it this way.

563
00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:38,370
  Anchor  

564
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:39,210
Anchor?

565
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:45,210
That Prosecutor Kang wants us to stop him.

566
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:16,230
  Let's just take one picture, Prosecutor Kang Seong Mo!  

567
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:18,880
 Otherwise, I'll take you to a third round. 

568
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:23,560
  You've never taken pictures like this right? 

569
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:26,730
  There is no way that Kang Seong Mo ever took anything like this.  

570
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:28,320
  I don't pictures like this.  

571
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:31,160
  Cyborg! Smile!  

572
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:34,610
 One, two, three! 

573
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:37,230
 Like this. Smile like this. 

574
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:41,950
  See, you know how to laugh.  

575
00:51:41,950 --> 00:51:45,360
 Smile. One, two, three.  

576
00:51:49,650 --> 00:51:52,530
 Hey, Kang Seong Mo, why do you hide so much? 

577
00:51:52,530 --> 00:51:55,920
 For two years, you’ve been worrying and thinking alone.  

578
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,760
 I’m telling you that I’ll help you.  

579
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,460
 Am I really no help to you at all? 

580
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:04,530
 We have such an unfair relationship. You know everything I’m thinking,  

581
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:06,560
  and I don’t know anything you’re thinking, if you don’t tell me.  

582
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,730
 I think you made a change for the better,  

583
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:10,770
 but why do I feel so uneasy? 

584
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:13,490
 You've definitely changed. 

585
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:16,110
 I wanted to be the one to change you. 

586
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:22,630
 Killing this guy won't heal your wounds. 

587
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:26,020
 It will rather become an even bigger wound. 

588
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:30,260
 So please, 

589
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:32,820
 go back with me, 

590
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:35,090
 Kang Seong Mo. 

591
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:42,120
I'm sorry for coming late.

592
00:52:44,770 --> 00:52:47,040
Like you said,

593
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:56,680
I'm going back now.

594
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:12,960
  Seoul Seoheun Police Station  

595
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,190
How does this make sense?

596
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:17,300
The investigation isn't over yet, and Kang Eun Joo continues to lie—

597
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:18,540
What's happened?

598
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:21,450
Then, at least let her finish her time left in the custody period.

599
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:22,960
Excuse me, Prosecutor!

600
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,510
Prosecutor!

601
00:53:25,510 --> 00:53:28,100
The prosecution office says to release Kang Eun Joo immediately.

602
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:31,960
We can't. Kang Eun Joo's address is still unclear,

603
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:35,090
and she may be in danger again if she goes outside.

604
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:39,120
Don't worry about that, Constable Yoon.

605
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,680
- Hyung. 
 - Prosecutor Kang.

606
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:46,760
I'll take my mother with me, so she will be safe now.

607
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:52,420
Before I take my mother, I think I should make a statement.

608
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:56,230
Are you joking right now? You suddenly show up now and what?

609
00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:57,330
You want to make a statement?

610
00:53:57,330 --> 00:54:01,390
You've got a lot of questions for me too.

611
00:54:01,390 --> 00:54:06,920
I'd like Constable Yoon to take care of the investigation. If that's fine with you Lieutenant Nam.

612
00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:37,000
Lee Ahn, before that,

613
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,750
deliver this to my mother.

614
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,230
  What is this?  

615
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:54,680
  This is the first gift I'm giving to you, mom. 

616
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:57,290
  As long as you keep this on, 

617
00:54:57,290 --> 00:55:00,710
  promise me that you'll erase everything from the past. 

618
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:05,900
 Stop having nightmares and don't be anxious. 

619
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:11,400
  Toss away the guilt as well. 

620
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:15,820
  Okay, I will. 

621
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:18,460
  I also prepared a gift.  

622
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:55,120
Seong Mo came? Here?

623
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:57,180
Yes.

624
00:55:57,180 --> 00:56:01,790
And he asked me to deliver this.

625
00:56:22,690 --> 00:56:26,110
Did Seong Mo catch the man?

626
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:30,510
He didn't kill him, did he?

627
00:56:30,510 --> 00:56:32,410
Right?

628
00:56:48,430 --> 00:56:53,530
Before starting the investigation, I'll have to say this first.

629
00:56:53,530 --> 00:56:58,170
I am sorry I couldn't help you when you were abducted by Kang Geun Taek.

630
00:56:58,170 --> 00:57:03,810
Thanks to the map you left, Ahn was able to find me quickly.

631
00:57:03,810 --> 00:57:05,880
That's a relief.

632
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:10,430
I wish I had told you about my past.

633
00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:16,130
But as you know, it's not that much of a warm story.

634
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:17,670
I understand.

635
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:22,850
I had a hard time talking about my father as well.

636
00:57:22,850 --> 00:57:27,770
So where should we start?

637
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:31,690
Let me ask you bluntly.

638
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:35,420
Where is Kang Geun Taek?

639
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:40,840
What makes you so certain that I know about his whereabouts?

640
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,030
That's...

641
00:57:50,930 --> 00:57:55,650
At the abandoned hospital, we saw you sedating Kang Geun Taek.

642
00:57:55,650 --> 00:57:57,840
I want to know exactly.

643
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:00,350
Was there a witness?

644
00:58:00,350 --> 00:58:03,110
Or is this psychometry?

645
00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:06,480
Psychometry?

646
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:07,630
What is that?

647
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:10,290
- What is she talking about?
 - Be quiet!

648
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:15,590
Visions seen with an ability not based in science,

649
00:58:15,590 --> 00:58:20,390
are not legally admissible as evidence. I'm sure you know that.

650
00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:22,330
Sounds good.

651
00:58:22,330 --> 00:58:26,840
Then, let me ask about the Yeongseong Apartment first.

652
00:58:28,990 --> 00:58:31,630
The Yeongseong Apartment murder arson...

653
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,800
Who did it?

654
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:39,710
Yeongseong Apartment, Hanmin Care Home,

655
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:42,870
and the murder of Kim Gab Yong.

656
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,590
The cause of death was the same.

657
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:51,180
Considering the circumstances, I suspect Kang Geun Taek as the murderer.

658
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:54,300
Are you saying that you had no part in them?

659
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:55,990
I guess I had some part in it,

660
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:58,260
since I was the one

661
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:02,330
who helped my mother escape before the apartment was set on fire.

662
00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:06,280
  There's a phone and money in there. 

663
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:09,220
  Only I know the number, so stay hidden until I contact you. 

664
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:11,070
 Seong Mo. 

665
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:18,770
Then that means you knew from the beginning

666
00:59:18,770 --> 00:59:22,000
that Kang Eun Joo was alive.

667
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,710
Yes. I was protecting her.

668
00:59:29,490 --> 00:59:33,510
I left Unit 701 and headed to Unit 1501 to meet the police officer

669
00:59:33,510 --> 00:59:37,160
who offered me his help but no one was home.

670
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:40,370
That's when I noticed the fire.

671
00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:43,700
Lee Ahn, is that statement true?

672
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:46,050
I don't know

673
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:49,320
whether or not he is telling the truth.

674
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:54,320
I tried heading back to my unit to see what was going on, but it was impossible due to the smoke.

675
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:57,760
Then, as I passed the elevator,

676
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:02,510
I met Yoon Tae Ha and Lee Ahn.

677
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:06,320
You and Ahn know what happened afterward.

678
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:08,450
Then why

679
01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:12,750
didn't you say that your mother was alive?

680
01:00:13,690 --> 01:00:17,510
Is it because the law has never kept the two of you safe?

681
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:21,010
You and I have a lot in common.

682
01:00:21,010 --> 01:00:25,010
We both don't trust the law or the police,

683
01:00:25,010 --> 01:00:28,060
but we chose to work in this very field.

684
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:32,580
It was to solve our problems ourselves.

685
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:36,540
Through Kim Gab Yong, you were able to give your mother new identities.

686
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:41,980
Yes. However, I had no idea that he would kill Park Soo Young and Kang Hee Sook.

687
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:48,080
When Kang Eun Joo returned from  Canada under Park Soo Young's name, it was when Kim Gab Yong was being investigated for the murder of the homeless.

688
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:54,040
Afterward, your mother changed her identity once again to Kang Hee Sook.

689
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:59,110
Despite this, are you saying that you had no idea that Kim Gab Yong

690
01:00:59,110 --> 01:01:03,630
was referring to you as his VIP client?

691
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:06,320
His VIP client?

692
01:01:08,310 --> 01:01:12,270
Let me say this again. Any psychometry readings performed by Ahn

693
01:01:12,270 --> 01:01:16,830
are not admissible as evidence or witness under the eyes of the law.

694
01:01:20,730 --> 01:01:24,770
You seem like a different person, Prosecutor Kang.

695
01:01:25,470 --> 01:01:27,240
What on earth are you doing?

696
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:30,730
The claim that I instigated the murder of Park Soo Yeong and Kang Hee Sook...

697
01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:35,500
There was no reason for me to do it.

698
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:40,070
But the ID change is definitely true.

699
01:01:40,070 --> 01:01:43,470
He's only willing to accept the identity theft charge.

700
01:01:43,470 --> 01:01:45,580
Being a prosecutor, he knows his way around the law.

701
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:48,150
All he'll get is probation.

702
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:51,590
Maybe not even that considering the extenuating circumstances.

703
01:01:53,150 --> 01:01:56,620
- You went to the Hanmin Care Home, right? 
 - Yes.

704
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:58,490
I saved my mother with the help of Kim Gab Yong.

705
01:01:58,490 --> 01:02:01,680
Again even though you knew Kang Geun Taek was committing murder again, you ignored him.

706
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:05,430
Before my mother woke up, I asked Kim Gab Yong to care for my mother.

707
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:07,510
Then I left that place.

708
01:02:07,510 --> 01:02:11,340
I investigated the Care Home incident

709
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:13,710
based on Kim Gab Yong's statement.

710
01:02:13,710 --> 01:02:19,170
Kim Gab Yong testified that the patient Song Hee Jeong killed everyone and then committed suicide.

711
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:21,930
Are you saying

712
01:02:22,930 --> 01:02:25,290
you believed this unbelievable story?

713
01:02:25,290 --> 01:02:28,520
Everyone believed it.

714
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:33,790
The Police Agency and those of the Prosecutor's office all believed him.

715
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:38,950
Only one person thought otherwise.

716
01:02:38,950 --> 01:02:43,880
The only one who was curious about the truth was Detective Eun Ji Soo.

717
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,990
There was only one person.

718
01:02:50,230 --> 01:02:54,270
I will pay for my wrongdoings if there proves to be any,

719
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:58,010
since that's why I came back here.

720
01:02:58,010 --> 01:03:00,460
Prosecutor Kang.

721
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:02,510
I'll get going then.

722
01:03:02,510 --> 01:03:07,860
Leaving my mother in a cage is quite cruel.

723
01:03:18,490 --> 01:03:19,830
What are you thinking?

724
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:22,930
I only want to reveal the truth.

725
01:03:22,930 --> 01:03:26,890
Then why did you look for Kang Eun Joo after the Hanmin Care Home incident?

726
01:03:26,890 --> 01:03:29,510
Was that all a lie?

727
01:03:29,510 --> 01:03:33,120
Was everything you showed me a lie?

728
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:38,360
After the Hanmin Care Home incident, my mother disappeared.

729
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:41,050
When I see her today, I'm going to ask her why.

730
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:44,200
Kang Eun Joo didn't meet you because

731
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:47,380
Kang Geun Taek told her that the Yeongseong Apartment murder

732
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:50,430
was by you.

733
01:03:50,430 --> 01:03:55,920
Was it really not you?

734
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:02,680
Will you believe me if I say no?

735
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:08,070
No. Now I don't believe anything. Nothing at all.

736
01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:21,450
I'll come back for further investigation if necessary.

737
01:04:25,330 --> 01:04:27,120
Hyung!

738
01:04:28,590 --> 01:04:30,880
  Save me.  

739
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:35,410
  I know it looks shameless, 

740
01:04:37,690 --> 01:04:41,180
  but I don't want to die here like this.  

741
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:44,900
  He will see it.  

742
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:51,120
  The only person who can spare you.  

743
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:31,750


744
01:05:32,730 --> 01:05:35,450

 Do you want to try it? 

752
01:06:05,030 --> 01:06:06,340
 Forget it.

01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:08,760
  You mix it up and you solve it yourself.

  Don't think your matching just one side.  

758
01:06:18,070 --> 01:06:21,300
  Consider that you're matching all six sides at once, 

759
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:23,120
  and take them one by one. 

760
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:25,900
  How can I think of all six sides? Maybe just one would be okay. 

761
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:28,730
  It would be easier to think that way. 

762
01:06:28,730 --> 01:06:33,800
  But I want this side, and that side, 

763
