4
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:48,760
 December 11, 2005 - One week after the fire. 

5
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:02,070
 Call me if you need anything. 

6
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,020
 I'll come running. 

7
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,380
 Ta-da. Here's your puppy. 

8
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:37,260
 You can have anything you want except for a puppy. 

9
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:05,970
 Dad!   

10
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:17,770
-  Why did you start the fire?
- You monster!
- What was the reason? 

11
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,750
-  Die!
- Why did you do it? 

12
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,530
 What was the reason? 

13
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,370
 Gwangcheon Police Station. 

14
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,360
 Dad! 

15
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,000
 Yoon Jae In 

16
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:46,020
How long are you going to continue to watch Ahn from the sidelines?

17
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,720
Until he finds someone he truly wants to perform psychometry on.

18
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,130
You see, even I have someone

19
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:57,040
I'd like him to perform a read on.

20
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:03,330
And who is that person?

21
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,990
He probably met that person by now.

22
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,710
That girl.

23
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:31,090
 Psychometry: Soul-measure

00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:33,290
 He is Psychometric 
- Episode 2 - 

25
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,680
Hey, haven't you gone back to your school?

26
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,940
From what I heard this won't be your school starting tomorrow. You're being expelled.

27
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,980
Expelled? Says who?

28
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:57,190
I was disgusted knowing I had to see you every day so I'm relieved.

29
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,700
- You see, I'm in your class.
- What?

30
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,330
Don't follow me or I'll scream.

31
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,480
Hey, I'm not the one who likes to touch people.

32
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,420
I'm Lee Ahn. No one can expel me so easily.

33
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,020
What? What are you looking at?

34
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:20,020
I've been studying psychology and criminal profiling.

35
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,530
- Boys our age have two things they worry most about.
- What?

36
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:28,130
One is grades, while the other is sex. (In Korean, they are homonyms)

37
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:31,410
My hearing's always been good, but aren't they the same?

38
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,900
One is about studies...

39
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,670
and the other is a sexual matter. Sexual.

40
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,100
Sexual? Ah, I get it now.

41
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,560
No one can maintain a perfect balance though.

42
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,500
We each have one we worry about more.

43
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,930
I see you're the type that likes to boast.  What is your point?

44
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,860
You. You ran into both of these issues today.

45
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,550
Your grades and a sexual crime.  Which is the real you?

46
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,590
Neither! That's not me.

47
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:01,960
I've been framed all day today. Can you imagine how unfair this is?

48
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,430
Framed?

49
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,670
Unfair?

50
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,580
I know it all too well.

51
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,450
What...

52
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,160
What was that?

53
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,150
As your friend I did some thinking.

54
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,630
Clearing your name as a pervert isn't the urgent issue here.

55
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:28,470
I know. Getting expelled is huge too.

56
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,020
Why did I have to see someone else's answers?

57
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,890
No. What's more urgent is this.

58
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:39,250
This is So Hyeon's. Can you perform a read on it?

59
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,430
She left school early today. Find out her worries,

60
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:46,700
and see if she's looking for the right moment to ask me out.

61
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,780
Do I look like I have time for that?

62
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:55,120
- Here. Get it after you are expelled then.
- Why you...

63
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,460
- What?
- How about this?

64
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,470
I'll perform a read on the new girl

65
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:13,460
to see what the bathroom pervert looks like, and then catch him.

66
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,330
- You'll perform a read on her and the pervert yourself?
- Yes.

67
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:21,460
So you'll touch the girl who already thinks you're a pervert?

68
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,960
Yeah.

69
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,860
Don't you get why this sounds weird?

70
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,240
You're really not the brightest.

71
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,050
Look who's talking.

72
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,850
Try and study the ones you got wrong on the exam.

73
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:48,520
Get back to your seats.

74
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,670
New transfer girl, I hear you're very smart.

75
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:00,580
Come and solve the problem on the board.

76
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,980
Yes.

77
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:29,030
Wow, would you look at that! This is the class of a student bound for Seoul National University.

78
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:31,640
Watch carefully, you stupid—

79
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,460
Would any of you even understand this?

80
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,970
You want to be a prosecutor?

81
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,480
If possible.

82
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:51,900
Your dad. Is he really running for the district chief position?

83
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,940
Everyone knows already.

84
00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:01,590
Look carefully, you idiots at the difference between you and her.

85
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:06,400
Kids with good discipline, who study hard, stand out already.

86
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,230
Kids with single moms, single dads...

87
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,090
Now even orphans are causing trouble.

88
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:20,210
You are all a waste of space and I just don't know what to do with you.

89
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:24,120
- I didn't solve the problem correctly.
- What?

90
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,570
- I solved it this way because I thought this was the answer you wanted.
- But what?

91
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:31,770
The proposition that the third vector's total

92
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,680
is equal or larger than that of 2 vectors

93
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,360
is true when the third vector is a certain magnitude and direction.

94
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,150
If Z is zero, the proposition itself is contradictory.

95
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:44,860
Quiet!

96
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,830
Why is it contradictory when you solved it so well?

97
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,850
You got it right. Return to your seat.

98
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:55,700
- This problem is a lot like you.
- What?

99
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,170
"The troublesome kids were poorly educated at home."

100
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:02,800
"He scaled the wall and aced the test. So he's the one who broke into the teacher's office."

101
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,250
You pick the answer you like that suits the problem.

102
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:10,580
Hey, transfer kid. You're getting smug just because I praised you a bit.

103
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:14,850
Until he set foot in your office he couldn't tell you apart from the chemistry teacher.

104
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:18,700
Don't you find it weird that the stole the answer sheet to every subject?

105
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,020
I'm not saying it's okay to copy your friend's answers,

106
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:26,640
but did you compare his answers to the ones he said he copied from, before you blamed him?

107
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,100
Hey!

108
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,870
How dare you? What are you trying to do?

109
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:36,160
I don't want to defend him, but you looked down on and attacked us all personally.

110
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,710
That's not something a teacher should do.

111
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:41,030
She lost her mind.

112
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:48,220
Don't move. Don't Move!

113
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,340
If he isn't the culprit, who is?

114
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:58,610
The day before the exam someone broke the office lock and got in.

115
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,670
And you still think he wasn't the culprit?

116
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:05,730
Hey, you said you wanted to become a prosecutor.

117
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:08,520
In a courtroom,

118
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:14,020
the best way to prove someone's innocence is to identify the culprit.

119
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,230
- I plan on doing it.
 - You?

120
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:20,190
Yes. If I do, will you apologize?

121
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:23,420
Waste of space, uneducated, single parents, orphans.

122
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:26,740
Apologize to everyone for what you said.

123
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,980
Return our phones you confiscated!

124
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,300
 - The comic books, too. 
- My handbag. 

125
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,700
 - My makeup! 
- My hair curler! 

126
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:43,230
Give it back!

127
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:45,610
Shut up, all of you!

128
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:51,120
What if you fail? What then?

129
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,910
- Do whatever you want.
- Whatever I want?

130
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,870
Yes. You can even expel me.

131
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:02,670
Oh dear. I can't expel a student who wants to go to Seoul National University. I'm just a math teacher.

132
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:05,230
Then I will drop out.

133
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,960
On your own?

134
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:13,040
Okay, you have until the next math class.

135
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,590
You'd better find the culprit by then.

136
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,320
Dismissed.

137
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,220
Hey. Hey! Wow, awesome.

138
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,850
Hey, our next math class is first period tomorrow.

139
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:40,480
Do well.

140
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,220
I got myself in trouble. Again.

141
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,790
What is wrong with me?

142
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:59,700
I'm supposed to lie low. I must've gone crazy.

143
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:06,160
Drop out? I studied so hard.

144
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,480
I'm crazy. Crazy, crazy, crazy.

145
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:14,560
 Girl's Bathroom   

146
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,750
Stop.

147
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:21,180
You. You like me, right?

148
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,930
Did you follow me to this school?

149
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:26,330
Poor, popular me.

150
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,850
I got riled up and forgot you for a while.

151
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:35,100
If I'd known I'd have to save you, I shouldn't have talked back.

152
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,260
I get what you're thinking now, why you made me a pervert.

153
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,320
You are very impressive. It was a huge success.

154
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:47,040
It wasn't about you. I just can't stand people who talk like that.

155
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,440
I had no intention of helping you at all, so back off.

156
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,200
It's fine either way. I'll help you.

157
00:13:56,210 --> 00:14:00,140
I'll help you catch the culprit who broke into the teacher's office.

158
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,270
Hey, let's get this straight.

159
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:06,510
I'm helping you, not you helping me.

160
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,390
I'm Lee Ahn.

161
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:18,160
Then, let's do it after we catch the intruder.

162
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,580
What?

163
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,280
A handshake.

164
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:26,890
Let's shake hands for just for three seconds. That's it. Okay?

165
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,820
She's so cold.

166
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:41,400
A three second hand shake? He's psycho.

167
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:54,610
Jae In will be home soon, where do I hide this?

168
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:59,360
I'll put it here. It'll be safe here.

169
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,950
She'll find it right away. Where do I put this? This is crazy.

170
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:06,750
If I do this...

171
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:11,300
and hop along. "Jae In. Hi." That's too awkward.

172
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,500
I'll bury it underground.

173
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,870
Goodness gracious. Oh, dear.

174
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,310
Jae In, you came.

175
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:38,850
Hey! Don't spit candy into that expensive handkerchief...

176
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:45,690
Right, it's been less than a weeks since you told me off

177
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:48,280
for buying a set of expensive handkerchiefs, right?

178
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,430
I know, Jae-In but...

179
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,840
Jae-In, this is...

180
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,270
I bought this for a really cheap price.

181
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,850
It's usually ₩6,000,000 a bit expensive, huh? (approx $6,000)

182
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:01,880
But don't be surprised. I haggled it down to half

183
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,290
and bought it for ₩3,000,000!

184
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:04,590
If I hold onto this, it becomes money.

185
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:07,950
It's really hard to find this in the country.

186
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:10,460
This is such a steal. ₩3,000,000 is literally half!

187
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,650
Jae-In. Please.

188
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,190
Please, Jae-In!

189
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:25,080
I'm making quite a bit selling the designer goods you keep buying.

190
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,170
You brat!

191
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:29,030
Oh! There's a buyer already?

192
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,250
It already came up?

193
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,340
Aish...

194
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:39,040
Yes, Reverend. We finished moving in, thanks to you.

195
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,270
Thank you, Reverend.

196
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:44,100
Your sponsor worked really hard.

197
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:48,390
Someone sent us monthly allowances for the past three years.

198
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:53,330
And then you helped us find a house and school. How can I repay you?

199
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:57,420
Can't you ask that person one more time?

200
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,670
I really want to meet that person once.

201
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:02,800
You always get rejected but you're asking again.

202
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,480
I'll pass along the message

203
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,410
that Miss Yoon Jae In would like to meet you.

204
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,240
 TO DO LIST 

205
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,730
 After my part time job at the coffee shop, I should go by the school then. 

206
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,410
You're going to be late again?

207
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,670
You're catching a criminal. Why are you going to be late?

208
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,350
Do you have another younger brother other than me?

209
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:58,970
When you work in society, you can be late sometimes.

210
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:01,650
Why? Do you have something to say to me?

211
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:06,920
Hyung. If, by any chance...

212
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,810
If I got expelled or forced to transfer out, you'll still see me, right?

213
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:16,240
I won't see you until I die.

214
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,350
But what if it's not because of something I did, but unfairly?

215
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:23,220
Even if I was framed? Even if there's clearly something wrong with the world and not me?

216
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:26,130
You seem to have this imagination that even if the entire world turns its back on you,

217
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:29,490
I wouldn't do such a thing... I'm going to be the first one to turn my back on you.

218
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:33,340
You already live so pitifully. How could I possibly watch you become even more pitiful?

219
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,880
Did you practice? Did you memorize that? Is that a rap?

220
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,810
 I get the expulsion part, but what criminal record? 

221
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:42,690
Are you going around meeting your old friends?

222
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:46,340
I'm just imagining the worst case scenario.

223
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:50,410
Don't imagine because you always show me the reality of it.

224
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:53,090
- That's a compliment, right? 
- I'm hanging up.

225
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:18,460
Mom, Dad, why are you guys looking at me like that?

226
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:23,160
White Snow, you don't believe me either?

227
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:34,110
 Dohyun High School 

228
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:25,990
6 2? Darn, I need more than just two digits.

229
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:28,190
Is it 6262?

230
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,810
Please!

231
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,050
What are you doing?

232
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,570
Since when were you here?

233
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,460
6 2?

234
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:04,420
"Darn, I need more than just two digits." From then.

235
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,910
- Well...
- I thought you were thoughtless.

236
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:10,430
You got the password ahead of time. Pretty impressive.

237
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:13,440
Even if I don't have anything else, I do prepare stuff in advance.

238
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,050
Move.

239
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,980
How did you know?

240
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,240
The school anniversary is year 2002, June 2nd.

241
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,730
Because teachers can't handle too many pass codes,

242
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:36,130
I thought about different situations.

243
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:39,600
Who's Kyung Yei Soo? Who is he to tell you the pass code?

244
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,450
Is he in our class?

245
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,830
Hey, let's go together.

246
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:03,450
But will you be okay?

247
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:06,450
You're with a pervert whom you charged with a crime.

248
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,730
In this closed area with just two of us...

249
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,100
 Personal Record 

250
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,310
I found it!

251
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,630
- Yes, Detective Eun.
- I found her.

252
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:54,410
Kang Yi Sook, the person in charge of room 701.

253
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:57,520
 I'm talking about the silver ring. 

254
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,180
Were you still thinking about that?

255
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,480
I'll be right there.

256
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:07,900
 Kim Eun Seok 

257
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,660
There, too?

258
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:15,720
Except the ethics teacher, all the computers have secret codes.

259
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,700
I think they overestimated you saying you're the criminal in the situation.

260
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,920
Are you complimenting me?

261
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:13,880
Oh my...

262
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,610
Did he confiscate all these from kids?

263
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:18,870
The October edition.

264
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,860
A woman?

265
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:44,150
Pervert? You hurt your hand but why is your nose bleeding?

266
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,060
It happens when I focus on something.

267
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,990
You pervert and a fool!

268
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,180
Dang...it's not like that!

269
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:56,810
Don't come close.

270
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,750
I just felt something

271
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:04,570
for sure right now.

272
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:47,670
This is crazy.

273
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,860
I just...

274
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:56,910
You copied exactly alike from person in front.

275
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:01,490
How is it possible to copy exactly even the short answer questions?

276
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:03,530
I told you already.

277
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:05,840
I'm the one who cheated on the test but the one who got us into this office

278
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,050
is you.

279
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:12,330
I surprise myself, too, sometimes.

280
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:17,550
So...

281
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:21,180
I was thinking.

282
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,260
Could it be that the criminal broke into

283
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:26,160
the office for reasons other than for the test?

284
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,500
What?

285
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,300
I just thought about it.

286
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:35,360
Perhaps, she came back to retrieve something that math teacher confiscated.

287
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,250
If I imagine specifically,

288
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:40,880
maybe like a girl who carries cigarettes in her yellow pouch.

289
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:50,450
So she came into the office the day before the test

290
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:51,870
to take her cigarettes back?

291
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:54,540
How about something like a pen she needs in order for her to take the test well?

292
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:58,840
A pen is not a lucky charm. She'd enter the office without permission?

293
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:03,660
Just go and look at Hot Lady.

294
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:08,210
Wow, watch how you talk.

295
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:11,240
The name is Kang Yi Sook. Age 57.

296
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,730
The person Ahn saw that day was her for sure.

297
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:17,670
She worked that day and she was in charge of room 701.

298
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,430
They can't reach her after the fire.

299
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:23,920
If she escaped that day then normally she'd be a witness to the situation,

300
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,590
but they can't reach her.

301
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,490
Right? Isn't it suspicious?

302
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:31,050
Are you thinking that she's involved in that fire?

303
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,190
No, I think that would a reach.

304
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:36,150
But to just let it slide, something doesn't seem right.

305
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:38,820
Everyone is trying to get money from the hospital, claiming

306
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:42,140
that they were psychologically traumatized.

307
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:45,620
It's strange that she disappeared.

308
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:49,450
I'm thinking about heading to the studio-apartment  in front of the hospital because it's a residential area.

309
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:51,250
Do you want to go with me?

310
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:55,300
No. Call me when you meet her.

311
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:59,640
I'll go and see someone who misses me so much.

312
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,140
Yes.

313
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:25,140
Hey.

314
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:28,420
If you want to sleep go home. You're bothersome.

315
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:35,340
Black cap and black clothes.

316
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:39,640
Yellow pouch. A woman...

317
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:44,330
Right! She wanted to steal the tests! We're done now!

318
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:45,470
What is he saying?

319
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:49,230
I worked too much today. I'm dizzy.

320
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:52,000
Hey, don't you have some candy?

321
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,620
Stop talking nonsense and just leave.

322
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,910
Being expelled from school may be okay with you but I can't.

323
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,600
I can't either.

324
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,050
Dang it.

325
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,250
3-1-4-5?

326
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,270
He left. Let's go home.

327
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,140
You just said...

328
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:27,440
- What?
- You said 3-1-4-5.

329
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:36,670
Are you crazy? I didn't say anything.

330
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:40,370
Let go.

331
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,380
I'm so hungry. I'll go first.

332
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,340
Why did I say it first?

333
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:17,780
Why is she so sensitive with 3-1-4-5?

334
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:28,140
 The picture will wear out. 

335
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:31,370
Because I'm afraid to forget her face.

336
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:33,930
What happened to your parole review?

337
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:42,680
You only lived eleven years even though you're a model prisoner.

338
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:47,200
Being discharged is difficult, right?

339
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,310
I didn't hear incorrectly.

340
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:05,200
I'm sure he said 3-1-4-5.

341
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,440
Just how?

342
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,820
Excuse me.

343
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:25,040
Excuse me, student!

344
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,110
Student Yoon Jae In?

345
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:34,810
Do you... know me?

346
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:36,720
I might.

347
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,110
Who are you?

348
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:43,120
You said you wanted to see me.

349
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:47,530
What? Who are you?

350
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:54,210
I heard from the reverend that you wanted to see me.

351
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:56,860
 Then I will relay the message. 

352
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:59,730
 Yoon Jae In wants to see you. 

353
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,980
Were you really surprised?

354
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:11,240
Yes. I didn't know you would be this young.

355
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,330
And I didn't know you would appear so suddenly.

356
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:19,550
To be honest, I live in the house right in front of the rooftop one. I'm not doing so great financially.

357
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:22,620
But you still sent me money...

358
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:26,990
I will definitely repay you for all of the monetary support you sent me.

359
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:30,020
I will accept your payment not as money but as something else.

360
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,610
What's that?

361
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:34,370
You becoming happy.

362
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:40,790
Just repaying with money is...

363
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:43,260
Okay then let's do it that way.

364
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:54,240
But... Haven't we met somewhere else before?

365
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:02,070
I heard that's a pickup line.

366
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:06,860
No... I really did see you from somewhere else.

367
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,470
Aren't you the attorney who's in charge of the fire incident at the nursing home?

368
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:14,240
I saw you on the news.

369
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,580
And then what?

370
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,950
"I saw you on TV."

371
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:19,820
"You were so cool. You're better looking in real life."

372
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:22,840
Typically these comments are some options.

373
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:31,450
I said it to make you laugh.

374
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:37,050
I'm really good with my words otherwise, but it doesnt seem to be the case for my jokes.

375
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:56,480
It was definitely a girl.

376
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,530
 Is it a girl who broke into the office? Is she pretty? 

377
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:04,320
You know how I don't see what's crucial.

378
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:11,570
I couldn't see her face but she was average height and her body was... 36-24-35?

379
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:14,010
There's no one with that dream proportion at our school.

380
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:16,250
But that transfer student.

381
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:18,620
What about her?

382
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:25,270
I heard she's investigating everyone whose scores drastically rose from their last report card.

383
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:26,630
Should we let her just do something stupid?

384
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:32,170
 Or else what? Are you going to talk about you seeing a girl with dream proportions through psychometry? 

385
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:34,010
Then I would be revealing that I'm a crazy guy.

386
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:35,500
You know,  why do I feel like you're suddenly evolving though?

387
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,380
Why do I feel like you're evolving these days?

388
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:40,360
How could you have read the answers off that kid in front of you?

389
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,560
Aish, my ramen!

390
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:46,970
I grew 10cm since last winter.

391
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:53,740
According to Seong Mo Hyung, he thinks my psychometry develops with my physical growth.

392
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:57,200
Psychometry develops as you grow physically?

393
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,570
But what does that mean?

394
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:23,100
 Don't think too much about it! Will you even understand if I explain it? 

395
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:26,930
 It's not that I couldn't explain because I didn't know. 

396
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:28,880
 I have to sleep now. 

397
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:37,750
If you got off work, you should come in. What are you doing out here?

398
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:39,620
What do I have in my fist?

399
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,720
Seriously a mystery. I can't see anything.

400
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,070
Out of any other human beings, you're like an iron wall.

401
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:59,350
It's because you're still lacking in skills.

402
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:04,890
No, it's not. It seems to me that you don't have noradrenaline.

403
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,810
What?

404
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:08,920
You don't remember?

405
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:14,960
 11 years ago 

406
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:31,310
 Get it together. 

407
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:34,600
 If you cry, other people will laugh and bother you some more. 

408
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,930
 Other kids said I was a monster. 

409
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:38,870
 They're the real monsters.   

410
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:42,760
 They do all the bad things. I saw everything. 

411
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,100
 So why do you keep saying you see stuff? 

412
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:52,370
 Hyung, do you also think I'm lying? 

413
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,150
 No. 

414
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:58,490
 I believe you. But the other kids are not acting like that because you're a monster. 

415
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:01,750
 It's because of noradrenaline.   

416
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:04,860
 Nora...what?   

417
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:14,040
 Noradrenaline in the brain turns bad emotions into memories.   

418
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,200
 So instead of all of the good memories in peoples' minds, 

419
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,090
 bad memories emerge. 

420
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:23,530
 Especially because people are bad. Not because you're a monster. 

421
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:27,480
 Bad memories stay with people the longest, and you can see them. 

422
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,580
 Why can I see them? 

423
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:33,470
 I don't want to see them. 

424
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:37,230
 I think it's a relief you can see them. 

425
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:41,390
 Earlier, I wanted to secretly eat another roll of kimbap, 

426
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:43,930
 but I stopped myself because I felt like you'd see. 

427
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:45,360
 Really? 

428
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:49,000
 But I can't even see your memories. 

429
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,640
 That's why you and I match each other so well. 

430
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:57,180
 So you don't feel bad when I touch you? 

431
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,930
 Not at all. 

432
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:10,460
That a day would come where you teach me something.

433
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,730
Is this what they call a reward of raising someone?

434
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:16,880
I raised you! By watching closely you so you don't do anything bad.

435
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,890
You punk.

436
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:27,930
Why?

437
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:29,420
Girl!

438
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,270
Girl?!

439
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:36,660
This is the first time I saw something from you! And it was a girl!

440
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,260
Don't probe.

441
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:40,710
I'm serious!

442
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:44,250
Hey!

443
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:47,520
I can't see anymore. I definitely saw something before!

444
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:11,800
He was a prosecutor.

445
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:39,010
 Do Hyun High School 

446
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:41,720
This is it, right? Your social media account.

447
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,280
You posted this about the duck problem.

448
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:47,480
Why didn't you let the school know when you knew this was a mistake?

449
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,850
Do you think I'm the criminal?

450
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:53,660
Let's just say this is an investigation by an officer.

451
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,340
I want to hear who this school's valedictorian thinks is the criminal.

452
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,130
For free?

453
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:00,720
You know something, don't you?

454
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:05,100
I got the top score and I just don't want to retake the test.

455
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,290
Just that reason.

456
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:09,090
- What about the other kids? 
- What other kids?

457
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:11,940
Oh, the kids who solved those problems?

458
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:15,930
I'm not sure. Why wouldn't they say that an incorrect problem was incorrect?

459
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:16,980
It's not even like you're Hong Gil Dong.

460
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:21,150
I think, including you, that one of those kids who got that problem right is the criminal.

461
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:26,120
You knew the problem was a mistake and you still wrote the teacher's answer.

462
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:30,780
If you reasoned that out this far, then I should give you a present.

463
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:35,500
You only transferred here one day ago so you might not know, but in this school,

464
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:38,390
there's no one else who could solve that problem except for me.

465
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:40,060
At least before you showed up.

466
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:42,490
What is that supposed to mean?

467
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:46,210
Are you saying that all of those kids who solved the problem are the criminals?

468
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:49,000
You said you'd drop out if you can't catch the criminal.

469
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,800
It's good for me if you don't catch the perpetrator.

470
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:05,040
Wait a minute.

471
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:09,400
So the perpetrator is the girl who carries cigarettes in yellow pouch,

472
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,570
but in order to be on top of the game, this is the only way, right?

473
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:15,060
There're only 30 minutes left until math class starts.

474
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:18,120
I don't have time to 'read' all the girls in the school.

475
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,130
No, but this isn't it.

476
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:23,460
If you do this, you'll die.

477
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,500
Let's survive and meet.

478
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:41,670
What is this?

479
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:43,530
Get away!

480
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,870
Dang!

481
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,420
Hey, So Yeon. Don't worry about it.

482
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:41,330
It's Ahn who came in.

483
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:43,780
But So Yeon...

484
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,300
Talk with me for a second.

485
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:53,640
Is everything okay now?

486
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:01,560
- Get up, you bastard!
- Wipe your nose, you bastard!

487
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:12,880
I almost died.

488
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,460
Did you do this?

489
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:21,390
Did all the girls come out?

490
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:23,220
- That's strange.
- Yeah.

491
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:26,100
You're the strangest at this school.

492
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:28,970
Ah right, cigarette. Teacher, do you know

493
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:31,820
a girl who carries cigarettes in her pouch?

494
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:33,300
What?

495
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:44,940
I'm busy right now. Why did you want to talk?

496
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:50,480
You're just like your dad. You can't stand injustice.

497
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,280
What do you want to say?

498
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:55,410
Why did you have to get involved?

499
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:56,650
What?

500
00:44:56,650 --> 00:45:02,240
I have a secret.

501
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:09,710
I'll just tell you now but it's up to you to protect me or not.

502
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:13,920
I owe you something anyway.

503
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,970
What are you talking about? How would I know all the students who smoke in this school?

504
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:19,720
You always borrow cigarettes from the students.

505
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,640
You're setting me up.

506
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:31,410
 Hey, can you give me one cigarette? 

507
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:36,970
Wasn't it a ball point pen?

508
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:43,090
Teacher you know, right? Who's that girl?

509
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:49,790
Where's Kim So Yeon?

510
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:51,480
Why are you looking for So Yeon?

511
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,480
She left with the transfer student.

512
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,690
Transfer girl?

513
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:58,500
Wow, did they already find out?

514
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:05,250
Hey! Why are you looking for her?

515
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:08,700
Why are you looking for So Yeon?

516
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:12,070
So Yeon...

517
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:18,470
...carried a pregnancy test in her yellow pouch and was confiscated.

518
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:25,900
 Hey there, can you give me one cigarette? 

519
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:32,030
 You. Hey you. 

520
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:41,520
 Wake up. You're a senior. Okay? 

521
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,330
 Confiscated. 

522
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,890
She went into the office to take that back.

523
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,030
You probably made a mistake.

524
00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:59,090
The pen you gave to So Yeon is psychometric now.

525
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:15,710
You knew she was the one ever since I talked about yellow pouch.

526
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:19,320
Is that why she broke up with her boyfriend?

527
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,780
- I'll kill that bastard.
- Hey!

528
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:24,390
Il Bong!

529
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:28,090
Is that true?

530
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:31,780
I wanted to apologize to you that my parents were the most outspoken

531
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:37,380
ones to kick you out of the neighborhood a long time ago.

532
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:39,330
I'll take this as paying the debt.

533
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:41,540
Let's not talk about it.

534
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:50,390
So... What are you going to do now?

535
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:54,000
I wanted to endure until graduation

536
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:57,100
but I think that'll be hard.

537
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:06,040
Where did they go?

538
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:15,120
 Go and tell the math teacher. I'll be fine. 

539
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:19,080
Hey transfer student! Where's Kim So Yeon? I heard she's with you.

540
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,620
She went home.

541
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:22,560
She ran away already?

542
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:26,570
Hey! Did you find out something?

543
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:30,600
You knew why she went into the office, right?

544
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,250
Let's go back to the classroom. It'll start soon.

545
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:34,520
You can't tell.

546
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:35,850
What?

547
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:39,460
You can never tell others the reason why she went into the office.

548
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:41,790
Then she'll be expelled.

549
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:45,510
Then what about me? Is it okay for me to expelled? And what about you? Won't you go to college?

550
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:50,710
Sometimes, there are secrets that people protect with their lives.

551
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:55,030
You may not understand but there's such a thing.

552
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:56,800
Did I say I didn't understand?

553
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:01,220
I understand but why would I be expelled because of that?

554
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,770
That fool! Hey, Il Bong?

555
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:11,250
Hey Il Bong, stop it now!

556
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:44,830
So the two who didn't do their homework skipped the class?

557
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:58,230
Jae In, I was always so curious as to

558
00:49:58,230 --> 00:50:01,870
why a smart student like you was aggressive to what I said.

559
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:04,290
I was really curious about that.

560
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:07,240
So I dug into it more.

561
00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:12,270
You're an amazing person.

562
00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:16,320
Single moms and dads are nothing compared to yours.

563
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:20,280
Hey, move away.

564
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,940
Do you want to die?

565
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:38,710
What should I do?

566
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:43,010
Are you studying hard to become an attorney because of your dad?

567
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:46,760
I'm very interested in society.

568
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:51,940
No wonder your dad's name was familiar.

569
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:55,370
Right? Yoon Tae...

570
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:59,880
There was no student who stole the tests from the office.

571
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:05,220
But there was a teacher who stole the tests from the office.

572
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:09,660
What?

573
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:12,690
There's a witness who found a pre-marked answer sheet

574
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:14,880
from your third drawer in your desk.

575
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:30,650
 Why would you have a 

576
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:34,860
 pre-marked answer sheet in your desk a day before the test? 

577
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:37,820
There were five sheets.

578
00:51:40,090 --> 00:51:42,750
I don't understand what you're talking about?

579
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:46,440
Ah, right. I forgot to mention there were names on them.

580
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:50,750
13th rank student Kim Eun Soo, 14th rank student Ahn Kyung Soo,

581
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:52,670
22nd rank student Han So Ra—

582
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:54,620
- What the heck are you talking about?
- You call this

583
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:56,760
as you tripped over your own foot.

584
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:59,110
Kids who answered the problem with errors from this test,

585
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:02,260
along with you, are the perpetrators.

586
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,270
I don't get your nonsense.

587
00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:08,400
I said I can't do that but my mom—

588
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,100
You bastard! You need to shut your mouth!

589
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:16,050
I said to find the perpetrator but you're writing a book.

590
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:21,290
Who in the world came to the office and saw that kind of nonsense?

591
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:22,870
- That is...
- Who is it?

592
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:26,420
Who's saying that nonsense telling people he saw it?

593
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:28,690
It's him.

594
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:34,760
Yes, it's me.

595
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,720
I went into the office.

596
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,450
And as I was stealing Hot Lady from your drawer I saw everything.

597
00:52:39,450 --> 00:52:41,400
So what?

598
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:50,560
  Seoul Education department indicts against  

599
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,230
  a teacher who leaked test questions  

600
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:53,930
  Do Hyun High School's test fraudulence  

601
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:55,340
  Where else other than Do Hyun High? Insane math teacher,  

602
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:56,460
  post the names, I know who they are...  

603
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:57,850
  School corruption is prevalent, that school is known to be one of the worst  

604
00:52:57,850 --> 00:52:59,500
  They say it's Do Hyun High School  

605
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:13,850
Wow.

606
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:18,780
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by the 🙏🏼 Just One Touch 🙏🏼 Team at Viki   

607
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,690
Let me go and let's talk. Let go!

608
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:24,840
Hey, come on!

609
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:32,100
Let go.

610
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:34,750
I didn't get a chance to ask before.

611
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:38,550
How did you know about So Yeon?

612
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:44,220
About her entering the classroom and her secret—you knew all of it.

613
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:48,420
Because... There was an informant.

614
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:50,770
An informant?

615
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:52,650
- Dae Bong! 
- Dae Bong?

616
00:53:52,650 --> 00:53:55,990
Of course, I heard it from him. How else would I have known? He's So Yeon's stalker.

617
00:53:55,990 --> 00:53:59,290
He knew she was the criminal the whole time and hid it from me, that punk.

618
00:53:59,290 --> 00:54:03,450
Then... How much do you know about me?

619
00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:04,420
What do I know about you?

620
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:07,540
3-1-4-5. I need to go over that.

621
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:09,590
What's that?

622
00:54:09,590 --> 00:54:12,160
 3-1-4-5? 

623
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:16,050
That day, in front of the classroom, you definitely said that number.

624
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:17,780
- What's that number? 
- What?

625
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:20,300
I don't even know what it is but you keep asking me about it.

626
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:22,150
You tell me. What is that number?

627
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:23,540
Are you saying I accidentally let it slip?

628
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:27,200
Then what? How else could I know about that number?

629
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,500
We haven't even known each other for that long.

630
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:35,050
Plus, the thing that's important between us isn't that number.

631
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:42,940
 If I catch the criminal who got into the classroom, then let's do it then. 

632
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:44,410
 What? 

633
00:54:44,410 --> 00:54:45,820
 Handshake. 

634
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:49,020
 Holding hands without doing anything else for 3 seconds. 

635
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:52,170
All of a sudden? Right now?

636
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:55,240
Here?

637
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:13,380
Yes, hello?

638
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:15,510
Hello?

639
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:17,150
Oh, the police station?

640
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:22,060
 We got the clear image of the perpetrator on CCTV. 

641
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:24,530
Really? By any chance, is it—

642
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:26,860
 It's not the male student you reported last time. 

643
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:31,020
 He's famous in that area so it's just a matter of time to catch him. 

644
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:36,980
By any chance, did you contact him as well?

645
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:40,970
Ahh I see! I'm not the criminal?

646
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:46,570
I'll be good!

647
00:55:46,570 --> 00:55:48,930
Thank you.

648
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:52,490
Did you hear?

649
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:56,290
They said I wasn't the criminal.

650
00:55:56,290 --> 00:55:59,950
You. You said you saw undergarment sizes.

651
00:55:59,950 --> 00:56:01,490
And that you'd see it from now on.

652
00:56:01,490 --> 00:56:03,950
Fine. Then what was that phone call?

653
00:56:03,950 --> 00:56:06,950
It was definitely something I could misunderstand.

654
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:09,090
You said it yourself.

655
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:14,100
That everyone has a secret they have to risk their life keeping.

656
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:17,710
I have something like that.

657
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:19,850
Wow. What's your identity?

658
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:20,720
What identity?

659
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:25,050
You seem like an idiot but then you suddenly become smart.

660
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:28,690
You seem like a pervert but you're not.

661
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:31,380
You really have a skill of making a compliment sound like an insult.

662
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:36,550
If that's what you call an apology, I'll accept it and move on.

663
00:56:36,550 --> 00:56:41,100
Fine. I'm sorry for calling you a pervert.

664
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:43,120
Sorry.

665
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:46,710
And... Thanks.

666
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:49,750
For keeping the secret about So Yeon.

667
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:51,340
Here.

668
00:56:52,730 --> 00:56:58,680
The transfer student is saying sorry and thanks and no one is around.

669
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:01,520
This is such a waste to hear this by myself.

670
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:04,030
My arm's about to pop off.

671
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:21,020
Since we caught the pervert too, let's just say we shook hands.

672
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,990
Game over.

673
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:38,770
Even though I see him over and over again, he's so handsome.

674
00:57:38,770 --> 00:57:42,830
How can a prosecutor be that good looking?

675
00:57:42,830 --> 00:57:47,100
If only I was ten years younger... "please examine me."

676
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:48,430
I would've said that to him.

677
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:50,780
It's that person.

678
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:53,880
The one who's been supporting us monetarily for the past three years.

679
00:57:56,950 --> 00:58:01,120
Oh my goodness. Then your daddy long legs is

680
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:02,780
this prosecutor?

681
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:06,190
He lives next door so if you see him, greet him properly.

682
00:58:09,310 --> 00:58:11,670
Next door neighbor?!

683
00:58:31,350 --> 00:58:34,470
What? He lives next door?

684
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:37,900
What are you doing out here? Are you coming back from work or leaving for work?

685
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:40,470
I won't be coming home tonight. I came to just change my clothes.

686
00:58:40,470 --> 00:58:42,230
A new case? Should I go with you?

687
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:44,320
You're being like this again.

688
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:47,210
To be honest, there was a small incident at school but

689
00:58:47,210 --> 00:58:49,830
I figured it out well.

690
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:54,010
You figured it out well? I got a call from the school.

691
00:58:54,010 --> 00:58:56,350
No, but it handled itself well so that's pretty mild.

692
00:58:56,350 --> 00:58:59,300
It was something worth getting suspended for.

693
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:07,250
Hyung. Can't you trust me just once?

694
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:13,770
This is the only thing I can do for you.

695
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:17,900
I know.

696
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:20,670
I know you want to do something for me and

697
00:59:20,670 --> 00:59:24,240
I know you want to help with that ability of yours.

698
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:30,190
But I think your psychometry is still pretty dangerous.

699
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:33,530
Psychometry?

700
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:43,830
Your ability can see the person who's wielding the knife, but not the person he stabbed,

701
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:47,850
or know if the person could be covering up for someone else.

702
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:50,260
It's an ability where we can't know anything.

703
00:59:51,770 --> 00:59:57,210
Don't be too proud of seeing only a portion of a big picture.

704
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:17,240
Who's there?

705
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:27,220
Yoon Jae In?

706
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:30,280
You—why are you over there?

707
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:34,220
This is my house.

708
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:36,660
I didn't hear because I wanted to.

709
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:39,890
I listened and yet... I can't quite understand what I heard either.

710
01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:42,920
You misheard whatever it is.

711
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:44,940
Wait just a second!

712
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:49,120
I'm trying to understand the whole situation but I'm not there yet.

713
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:51,990
Don't try to process it because it wasn't anything.

714
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:58,010
So you're really psychometric?

715
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:01,240
That doesn't make sense.

716
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:03,950
That's how you found out.

717
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:07,760
 Can't the reason why the criminal came into the classroom not be because of the exam? 

718
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:11,260
 Maybe he or she came to find an important object right before the exam. 

719
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:13,330
 Perhaps a yellow pouch with cigarettes inside. 

720
01:01:13,330 --> 01:01:14,680
Everything about So Yeon.

721
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:15,650
 3-1-4-5. 

722
01:01:15,650 --> 01:01:20,990
And that number. You found it all out through psychometry.

723
01:01:20,990 --> 01:01:23,070
Is that why you wanted to shake hands—

724
01:01:23,070 --> 01:01:24,870
Do you think I'm a monster?

725
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:27,860
You don't have to look at me like that.

726
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:31,120
You just don't have to come in contact with me.

727
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:34,100
You can see everything if our skins touch?

728
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:39,650
You yourself said everyone has a secret they'd risk their life keeping.

729
01:01:39,650 --> 01:01:44,590
I don't have to see what you're hiding, and my secret...

730
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:46,720
Just pretend like you didn't hear it.

731
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:50,000
No. The fact that you're

732
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:56,220
psychometric, and if that's how you found about my dad...

733
01:01:56,220 --> 01:01:57,690
What?

734
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,500
You're not a monster.

735
01:02:04,310 --> 01:02:10,810
I'm going to go over to you right now and even if I have to shake your hand or whatever else, there's something I want you to find out.

736
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:13,300
"Shake my hand or whatever else?"

737
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:18,110
You wait there. I'll go to you.

738
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:33,260

746
01:03:06,390 --> 01:03:08,860
 This. 

747
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:11,460
 That detective earlier, is she your girlfriend? 

748
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:12,970
 Who are you? 

749
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:15,150
 It's a student named Yoon Jae In. 

750
01:03:15,150 --> 01:03:16,470
 Where is she right now? 

751
01:03:16,470 --> 01:03:18,300
 I don't know why there's a chain. 

752
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:21,270
-  A murderer's daughter, Yoon Jae In. 
- It's so hard... 

753
01:03:21,270 --> 01:03:23,400
 Do you think your father is the criminal? 

754
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:24,530
 You saying you'd help me? 

755
01:03:24,530 --> 01:03:25,220
 Everyone leave! 

756
01:03:26,530 --> 01:03:29,600
 Develop your skills well. 

757
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:33,900
 When I gain confidence, I'll come find you again.
