1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:10,030


2
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,010
 He is Psychometric 

3
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:45,390
Isn't it too early for a Christmas tree? 
     

4
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,500
It's nice to have a big one up for a long time.

5
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,340
Right.

6
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:55,500
Where should I put the star?

7
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,070
The star should be at the very top.

8
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:00,680
On the top?

9
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,670
Should we do that?

10
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,990
Is that good?

11
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,800
 Yes. 

12
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:23,060
Dad, that boy is limping again.

13
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,630
Hey student!

14
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,240
You moved into unit 701 a month ago, right?

15
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,330
You haven't been to the hospital yet?

16
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,220
I'm fine.

17
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,550
It must have hurt a lot. The wound is oozing pus.

18
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,860
Dad, be careful.

19
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,500
How did you get hurt? The wound seems...

20
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,090
Just...

21
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,800
I was just playing around.

22
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,980
I don't know what's going on,

23
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:21,340
but leaving wounds like this untreated will get them infected.

24
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,750
Overlooking wounds just because they are small could kill you.

25
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,950
I didn't know because it didn't hurt.

26
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,910
Wait here for a minute. I’ll buy you some medicine.

27
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:36,020
I have to go home.

28
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:41,670
Then I’ll have to go to the police station, not the pharmacy.

29
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,840
You have a strange wound, you won’t go to the hospital,

30
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,720
and you won’t take any medicine.

31
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,340
I have never seen your parents since you moved here.

32
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,840
Do you happen to be abused?

33
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,470
My mom isn’t like that.

34
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,430
Can you get me some medicine, please?

35
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,150
I’ll take it.

36
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:07,470
Jae In, stay here for a second.

37
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,930
It's pretty, isn't it?

38
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,210
It's pretty.

39
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:26,060
Adjective. To have a beautiful appearance appealing to the eye.

40
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,590
To have loveable or attractive actions.

41
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,750
You're saying that's what it's like?

42
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:36,760
'Adjective', I don't know difficult words like that.

43
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,720
To be pretty means...

44
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,070
Something like this?

45
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:45,770
You smiled.

46
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:58,390
 Psychometry: An ability to measure and interpret the essence or history of a person or thing through touch. 

47
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,590
 He is Psychometric 
- Episode 7 -  

48
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,450
Stop stalling and talk.

49
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,710
Those two don't know yet, right?

50
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,780
Their relationship?

51
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:17,210
Well, it will only be a matter of time before they find out.

52
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:19,080
Why do they need to know?

53
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,820
Why are you meddling and putting them together?

54
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,780
If Ahn is able to reveal something through psychometry,

55
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:36,000
I believe it will be the case from thirteen years ago.

56
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,820
Constable Yoon believes that her father is not the culprit,

57
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,860
and Lee Ahn...

58
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,760
He wishes to solve the case with his abilities.

59
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,640
Does that answer your question?

60
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,850
What if Constable Yoon finds out that her father killed Ahn's parents?

61
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,560
No.

62
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,520
What if Ahn find out that Constable Yoon's father killed his parents?

63
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,730
Both sides will be hurt.

64
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:06,660
To have your heart hurt,

65
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,920
I didn't know what that meant before.

66
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,760
- Huh? 
 - But despite getting hurt,

67
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,960
there exists the truth that must be known.

68
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,960
You also believe that Constable Yoon's father isn't the culprit?

69
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,570
Then is the culprit the man who stabbed Ahn?

70
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,290
Who on earth is that person?

71
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:35,130
Trying to solve the problem that I wasn't able to solve for my entire life in one just go would be greedy, right?

72
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,660
Is this something that I'm allowed to solve?

73
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,930
You won't if I tell you not to?

74
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,400
I'll work even harder if you tell me not to.

75
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,640
Where is the bus that goes home?

76
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,770
I want to take a taxi.

77
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,380
I want to take the bus.

78
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,000
You must have forgotten but I hate buses. I hate crowded areas.

79
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,630
That's why you should challenge yourself.

80
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,890
I'm planning on purposely taking you to the places you hate next time.

81
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:06,130
Hey, I just passed out from overusing my psychometry.

82
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:11,160
I know that your nose bleeds when you concentrate,

83
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,480
but you even pass out when it's too severe?

84
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,920
Today was the first time I passed out.

85
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,320
Will I die if it gets worse?

86
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,350
Hey, then shouldn't you get an examination at the hospital?

87
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,600
What examination, a brain examination?

88
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,160
I guess being smart doesn't always give you good ideas.

89
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,980
Did you forget? This is a brain with an extraordinary ability.

90
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,060
Do you think you'll get dragged to NASA to get investigated?

91
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:37,030
NASA might dissect my brain and put it in alcohol.

92
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,880
You read too many comic books.

93
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,300
How could you say such horrible things so nonchalantly?

94
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,560
What I saw when I was unconscious was much more horrible.

95
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:51,190
The pain really felt like my head was being smashed in.

96
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:57,500
So just let me take a taxi home for now, okay? Okay?

97
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:03,330
Fine. Today's taxi ride will be a reward.

98
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:07,280
Starting tomorrow, I'm going to pick out all the things you hate, to train you, so be ready. Got it?

99
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,220
Okay. Anything is okay as long as it isn't the library.

100
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:21,190
Hey, help me look for a taxi.

101
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,870
Why did he kill her?

102
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:29,200
And why did he get killed too?

103
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,280
- What? 
 - He killed two people.

104
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,440
That man, Kim Gap Yong.

105
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:39,690
Then someone else murdered him.

106
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:52,290
The fake Kang Hee Sook you performed psychometry on in the autopsy room,

107
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:54,510
the woman with the ring,

108
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,340
is there nothing more you remember?

109
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:03,300
It was two years ago. Two long years.

110
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:06,420
It would be weird to remember.

111
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:12,850
I remember everything about you from two years ago.

112
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:22,290
What is that supposed to mean?

113
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:30,330
You were really weird.

114
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,930
Yes, Auntie.

115
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:42,560
 Try not to be too surprised. 

116
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,190
 My brother-in-law... No, your Dad... 

117
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:51,800
Taxi... Taxi...

118
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,630
Taxi!

119
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,110
What's wrong?

120
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,210
I have to hurry.

121
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,780
Is it that again? Hyperventilation?

122
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,030
You don't have a paper bag?

123
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:37,050
Don't worry. I won't touch you until you let me.

124
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,450
Can you catch your breath when you're like this?

125
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,950
I'll go alone. Wait here.

126
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,900
 Dad, please... 

127
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:48,200
 Dad, please don't die. 

128
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,640
Go.

129
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:00,660
Your dad is dead today.

130
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:07,470
Just live pretending I don't exist.

131
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,150
Doesn't living like this feel unfair to you?

132
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:19,000
You living your life in vain because of me,

133
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,940
feels more unfair.

134
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,170
My life

135
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,120
is over anyway.

136
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,470
It hasn't ended yet.

137
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:37,270
I'm just getting started but why are you like this?

138
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:42,680
Why do you sound so weak?

139
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,920
Dad...

140
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,280
You said that

141
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:18,500
leaving a wound untreated will get infected,

142
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:22,690
that a small wound can kill you.

143
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,210
Dad...

144
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:35,020
I'm going to do it.

145
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,110
So, please...

146
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,740
Don't be weak.

147
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,150
Hmm?

148
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,790
You're telling me to eat this?

149
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,010
Well done, my friend.

150
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:59,980
Here, you eat one.

151
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:04,230
And this one... Give it to the prettiest noona outside.

152
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,180
Got it?

153
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,770
This noona is very sad right now.

154
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:11,460
It would be nice if you could give her a hug, but

155
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,350
you don't need to if you don't want to. Okay?

156
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,460
Then you can give her a hug.

157
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:20,690
I'm asking you guys because I can't.

158
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:24,870
Can I just eat both, like you?

159
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:28,360
Then all your teeth will rot. Have you ever been to the dentist?

160
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,810
You'll realize how great the children's hospital is.

161
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:34,830
Great job.

162
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:39,190
I don't like the dentist either.

163
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,970
Oh, you're here?

164
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,550
Let's go home.

165
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,220
Here. You guys eat all these.

166
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,220
You eat two.

167
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,990
 -  I want the green one. 
 - I want the red one. 

168
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,960
Is your dad okay?

169
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:12,640
I only saw you say "Dad." I don't know anything else.

170
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,770
He's okay.

171
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:18,550
And... thank you.

172
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,280
Anyway,  practice for the first day of lessons was fruitful, right?

173
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,290
But there's something I've been curious about since earlier.

174
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:32,150
Where do you touch to do psychometry well?

175
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:35,300
Huh? Hands at first.

176
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,320
I think it's because the tips of the fingers are the most sensitive.

177
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,960
Sensitive skin...

178
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,060
As expected, it's the sense of touch.

179
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,910
Haven't we had this conversation before?

180
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:49,270
No, this is my first time asking.

181
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:53,230
Then, the most sensitive place...

182
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:56,800
 But isn't the most sensitive place to touch...  

183
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:02,500
 The lips... Is it not? 

184
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:08,600
  What do you think? Do you want to try psychometry? 

185
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:12,840
The most sensitive place to touch is probably...

186
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,660
- The lips? 
 - The index finger?

187
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,450
Right, the index finger.

188
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,150
What are you thinking?

189
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,270
Right. I'm something.

190
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:25,790
Right. That must be why ET communed using his index finger too.

191
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:29,500
I'm going. Go inside.

192
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,300
- Go home safely. 
 - O-Okay...

193
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,870
 Have you finished talking to Ji Soo? 

194
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,910
  Will you be late today, too?  

195
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,430
Don't wait for me and sleep.

196
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:43,070
Did you forget that I passed out today? Aren't you worried?

197
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:46,440
You want me to become a widow who lives in solitaire?

198
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,250
You mean "solitude."

199
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,120
Yeah, and who knows that better?

200
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,680
Come home tonight.

201
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,960
I'm not letting it pass this time, so be prepared.

202
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:28,120
 Your ability isn't advancing because you instinctively avoid touching anything with your hands. 

203
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,840
 Even if you don't want to use psychometry on random things, 

204
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,850
 if you have thoughts of investigating with your ability, don't just avoid touching everything. 

205
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,050
Okay, I got it.

206
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,120
 The door has unlocked. 

207
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,910
Here, here.

208
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,890
It's scary, right?

209
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:43,710
That’s right. Was it at around 7 o'clock?

210
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,920
Because of the dog's harsh barking,

211
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,780
we received a complaint.

212
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,830
- At 7? 
- Yes.

213
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:54,350
Have you been robbed?

214
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:57,080
- May I see the CCTV? 
 - Hyung?

215
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,860
The CCTV... Around that time,

216
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:04,710
the recording was temporarily paused due to a checkup.

217
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:07,050
- A CCTV checkup?
- Yes.

218
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:12,390
- Was it scheduled?
- No, a sudden malfunction report came in.

219
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,500
I understand.

220
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,780
It's that person, for sure.

221
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:27,310
I was looking around,

222
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:29,030
but nothing had gone missing.

223
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:37,230
I guess something did. Did he take your photo?

224
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,410
Yes.

225
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:39,780
Hyung, you know who this guy is, right?

226
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:45,020
- No. 
 - Hyung, he took your picture. But you still don't know?

227
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:58,690
  Doesn't living like this feel unfair to you?  

228
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:03,680
  You living your life in vain because of me, 

229
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,920
  feels more unfair.  

230
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:14,510
- When did you get here?
- "Are you okay? Aren't you tired? Don’t worry."

231
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:18,090
Let’s skip all those words, Auntie.

232
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:21,640
I've been hearing those words from you too much.

233
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,260
Did you eat?

234
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:29,310
I think I've heard that even more.

235
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,080
Let's go back in.

236
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:53,920
Do you remember the day I left you?

237
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,310
 Hyung, I missed you. 

238
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:07,000
 I prepared these because you were coming. 

239
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,800
   Ta-da! 

240
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,890
  Have you been studying well?  

241
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,330
  Yes.  

242
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:21,380
  Ahn, I don't think I'll be able to come here for a while.  

243
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,840
  Why?  

244
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,190
  I think I'm going to have to go far away to study.  

245
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:29,330
  Can't I, can't I go as well?  

246
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,580
  I am sorry.  

247
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,520
  Why are you sorry?  

248
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,200
  You're coming back. You're going to come see me.  

249
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:42,790
  Hyung!  

250
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:09,000
That time, I planned on not coming back to Korea.

251
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,190
Never again.

252
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,030
Why?

253
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,820
Because of that person.

254
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:23,070
Have you been escaping from this person?

255
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,810
But then why did you come back again?

256
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:45,770
Because I think I'll now have to go search for that person.

257
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,170
I will find this person...

258
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:57,630
and kill him.

259
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,110
It's nice and cozy.

260
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:20,610
- Do you want anything to drink? 
 - Who are you living here with? I heard it's a one-man-station.

261
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:22,900
With Auntie.

262
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,450
So you want to be a part of the Violent Crimes Unit?

263
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:26,820
Yes.

264
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:38,510
I heard about your father from Prosecutor Kang.

265
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:46,600
Can you tell me about that day?

266
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,510
Everything you remember.

267
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:57,620
The Yeongseong Apartment fire case from back then,

268
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:01,690
my father, who is currently the Chief, was in charge of it.

269
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,850
My father says there were no flaws in the investigation,

270
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:07,740
but we never know.

271
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:12,820
I don’t have any clear evidence proving that my dad isn’t the killer.

272
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:18,090
However, the only evidence for why my father was accused as the culprit

273
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,860
is bothering me.

274
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,820
If it’s the only evidence...

275
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:27,160
The bloodstained uniform?

276
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,600
Yes, that's right.

277
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,840
But I remember

278
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,940
that my dad had left the uniform with me before leaving.

279
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,420
 Stay inside. 

280
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:41,610
  Okay.  

281
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:44,750
With you?

282
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:48,250
Yes. But because I was so young,

283
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:51,630
whether it is my memory or an illusion,

284
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,970
I'm not really sure.

285
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,570
By any chance, if it is a distorted memory—

286
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:01,650
Then my father would be the criminal, right?

287
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,060
But if it's not an illusion,

288
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,430
I’ll find it.

289
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:10,200
Whoever took it.

290
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:14,890
That's why you want Ahn to read your memory from that day.

291
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:17,550
Yes.

292
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:55,790
  I will find this person...  

293
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,090
  and kill him.  

294
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:06,470
  Prosecutor Kang, I think he may just be wanting to ask for your help. 

295
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:16,370
  The fact that he's the only person you can't use psychometry on,  

296
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:20,620
  it might mean that he has completely closed himself off.  

297
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:24,910
  He must have been just that lonely.  

298
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,580
  And there must be a reason for that too.  

299
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:39,300
I'm going to surely find out who that person is.

300
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:43,050
  Seoheun Security Center  

301
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:19,220
Where did I put my car?

302
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,610
Right, I don't have a car.

303
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,130
- Get in! 
 - What's that?

304
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:03,410
I guess running makes me feel somewhat better.

305
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,780
 Mommy. 

306
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,990
That's a lot of cash.

307
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:47,290
This was in front of the daycare center?

308
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:49,980
Is there an ID card?

309
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,370
There's no ID card.

310
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:55,780
Credit card...

311
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:01,590
Dae Bong Lee?

312
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,050
Good morning.

313
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:13,060
Or not?

314
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,680
Hey, Lee Dae Bong,

315
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:20,480
- Did you drop your wallet in front of the daycare center? 
 - Yes.

316
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,920
So Hyun gave me this in the morning.

317
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,210
So Hyun?

318
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:28,310
Kim So Hyun! Kim So Hyun!

319
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:31,140
He sure is happy.

320
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,530
I think he dropped it on purpose.

321
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:35,900
- Why would he drop his wallet on purpose?
-  Last time I saw,

322
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,790
that there were a ton of coupons from Dae Bong's gas station in So Hyun's car.

323
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:41,640
But what do the coupons and  the wallet have to do with each other?

324
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,950
When you like someone, you have the heart of wanting to do anything for them.

325
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:48,900
As long as Dae Bong's feelings from two years ago are still the same.

326
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:53,900
So Hyun! Kim So Hyun! Wait a minute.

327
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,930
- What? 
- I heard you picked up my wallet. I wanted to say thank you.

328
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:01,810
There's nothing to be thankful for. The Security Center is right around the corner.

329
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:05,700
Still, if someone else had picked it up, they might have taken it.

330
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:10,150
I'll compensate for it. I heard that one-tenth should be—

331
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,640
Am I a beggar?

332
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:36,530
I knew that would happen.

333
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:42,090
So, Dae Bong deliberately dropped his wallet for So Hyun to give her compensation money.

334
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:43,250
This is what you think?

335
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,590
Isn't it?

336
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:47,000
Right there. In front of the daycare center.

337
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,700
The place where So Hyun walks by. He left it there for show.

338
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:54,070
To the fact that Dae Bong is not smart enough to plan deliberately dropping his wallet,

339
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,640
I'll bet my two wrists on it.

340
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,400
Hey, those wrists aren't just yours anymore.

341
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,950
You can't just bet them on anything.

342
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:03,160
Why aren't they mine?

343
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,580
Let's call them shared property for now.

344
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,960
Shared— Okay.

345
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,740
Not the actor.

346
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,510
I know, I know.

347
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:24,260
Then what is it?

348
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,990
I know.

349
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:29,480
♫   It's beautiful life   ♫

350
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:35,300
Don't they look alike?

351
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,850
Park Soo Young and Kang Hee Sook.

352
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,960
And the fake Kang Hee Sook as well.

353
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,150
- Is that so? 
 - Take a good look.

354
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:45,620
If Park Soo Young and Kang Hee Sook were both murdered by Kim Gap Yong,

355
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:49,720
My deduction is that this woman most definitely has some relationship to Park Soo Young.

356
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,320
The fake Kang Hee Sook?

357
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,170
So she may have lived as Park Soo Young before living as Kang Hee Sook?

358
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,290
That's right.

359
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:56,590
I think so too.

360
00:33:56,590 --> 00:34:00,510
Park Soo Young has been confined in a mental hospital as an unidentified woman since long ago.

361
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:03,330
But from 2009 to 2013,

362
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:06,310
there's a credit card statement and records of her entering and leaving the country.

363
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:10,380
There are no records after she entered the country in 2013.

364
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:14,340
I believe that's when she changed her identity again.

365
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:17,790
- From Park Soo Young... 
- To Kang Hee Sook.

366
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:23,510
- But what's the reason for claiming that Kim Gap Yong's murder of Park Soo Young and Kang Hee Sook? 
 - Huh?

367
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,620
Was there evidence from the corpse?

368
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:31,930
You suddenly tell me to investigate Kim Gap Yong, after going to the autopsy room, and claim that he is the culprit.

369
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:33,800
Ah, that.

370
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:38,220
There was a witness.

371
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:39,940
Who is that?

372
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,980
There's nothing in the data I've received.

373
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,380
An anonymous informant.

374
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,690
Have you checked if they are trustworthy?

375
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:49,910
Yes. It's a report more trustworthy than you.

376
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:52,560
So what about the data about Kim Gap Yong?

377
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,310
I don't understand why we should investigate him, so—

378
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,300
You still haven't done that?

379
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:59,670
I will do it from now on.

380
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:07,240
I don't understand how he joined the Special Investigation Unit.

381
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:13,400
Here are books on the laws of psychology and crime for today.

382
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,120
Okay, I guess it will all be worth it in the end.

383
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,930
Also, this.

384
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:21,060
  New Language Dictionary  

385
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,460
Aren't you looking down on me too much?

386
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:25,820
Don't forget to write your thoughts afterward.

387
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:31,590
A language dictionary.

388
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,830
  Shared (verb): Owning one property by two or more individuals. 

389
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:47,220
So I was right. I may be stupid but I knew that.

390
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:52,290
But why is she sharing my wrists and all?

391
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:54,290
Geez.

392
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,640
Hey, should I go and apologize?

393
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,840
You scared me. You didn't leave yet?

394
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,500
So Hyun seemed very angry, right?

395
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,280
You didn't drop your wallet on purpose, did you?

396
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,300
What are you saying? Am I crazy?

397
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,680
But I should still go and apologize, right?

398
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,340
Go ahead. Can't you see that I'm studying?

399
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:16,150
What do you mean "studying"? You're here just because of Yoon Jae In too.

400
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:20,110
I need to refine my abilities and upgrade.

401
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:22,430
You go to the gas station.

402
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,100
What's the point of making money when there's nothing to use it on?

403
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,000
What do you mean? There's me.

404
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:32,400
Am I nothing to you?

405
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,800
Here, do whatever you want.

406
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,870
I love you, Lee Dae Bong.

407
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:44,920
I love you so much, seriously.

408
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:03,130
You—you did drop it on purpose.

409
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:05,520
You're the type to use such shallow tricks?

410
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,640
Hey, I take back all the love.

411
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:12,200
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

412
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,550
Constable Yoon, you're already done with this work?

413
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:42,310
You can't even call this work but you can't also say that it isn't.

414
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:44,690
It's all so the people can live.

415
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:49,720
I've caught drug users, robbers, gangsters, but there's really nothing much.

416
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,400
Gangsters, my foot.

417
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,300
It's real.

418
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:56,670
What's real is stuff like this.

419
00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:00,130
Let's see what you've got.

420
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:05,210
How come your life is all full of knockoffs like this?

421
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:07,090
Can you even tell time?

422
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:11,060
Auntie, you said he helped you when you got scammed. Don't be like that.

423
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:15,350
That's right. You still don't realize how dangerous what you did was.

424
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:20,310
What a bluff. I just caught some gangsters at the employment office.

425
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,300
Normally an investigation starts from a small trivial crime.

426
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:32,060
I immediately started a full-scale investigation after you reported it.

427
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:35,570
This is not just a simple employment center but more like a gangster cave.

428
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:39,230
At that moment, my veteran experience kicked in and said, "I should risk my life on this."

429
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:41,180
Now it's time for you to say you fought against seventeen men.

430
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,620
It was twenty-three men.

431
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:45,790
You must have been one of these twenty-three men who lost against one man. Just eat your meal.

432
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,580
Let's stop here.

433
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:51,830
Auntie, my friend's in the library. I'm going to go share this with him.

434
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:55,460
Have you erased your memories from when you bawled your eyes out

435
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:58,220
and snot got into your mouth, back when they took your ID?

436
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:01,600
Should I act like you saved my life then? Dear Lifesaver.

437
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:05,570
Of course, you should. Those gangsters stole people's IDs in order to sell them.

438
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:08,490
There was a rumor that they killed people, too.

439
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:12,330
Identity theft? What happened to the gang?

440
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:15,840
What do you think? It was the cleanest sweep in police history.

441
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,340
By whom? Me.

442
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:20,040
Exactly what kind of gang were they?

443
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,160
Please tell me in detail.

444
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:27,370
These are the files for Kim Gap Yong.

445
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:29,920
But this man, his previous records are impressive.

446
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,340
Fraud, assault, and blackmail.

447
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,940
Most of them ended up on probation but—

448
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:37,150
- Thank you. 
 - Don't you remember?

449
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:39,730
When you were just starting out,

450
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:42,640
you met him once as a victim.

451
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,510
- Is that so? 
 - You'll remember when you see it.

452
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:55,440
The employment center, where Kim Gap Yong was the leader of the action team,

453
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,480
was a human trafficking organization active in Seoul, Gyeonggi-do.

454
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:04,820
Most of the victims were feeble-minded people, older people, homeless, tramps, and credit delinquents.

455
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:07,020
Men were sent to islands or offshore fishing boats,

456
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,020
and women were turned over for prostitution.

457
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:13,470
They stole their ID cards to make fake conditions and open cloned phones

458
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:16,810
to derive the benefits.

459
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:19,290
I mean it literally seems like he's done it all.

460
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:21,600
This case is bigger than I thought.

461
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:25,340
That's right. Each arrest we made was just the tip of the tail.

462
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,540
It must have grown beyond our imagination now.

463
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:30,440
I also had experience with only catching the tip of the tail when I was a new prosecutor.

464
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,090
It means we can't be rash about approaching them.

465
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:36,910
Still, we should be positive and feel lucky the head still exists.

466
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:41,190
There is probably going to be at least one guy that knows about Kang Hee Sook or Park Soo Young.

467
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:45,740
Do you think we'll be rewarded if we do well and clear out this whole gang?

468
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:50,370
Yes, Detective Lee, let's make sure we survive and get that commendation.

469
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:55,070
Does that mean we could die? Then from today on I will—

470
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:57,290
Let's go and see what these guys are like.

471
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:59,830
It's not like we're just tearing down a small store.

472
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:01,570
Hold on.

473
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:08,200
If a psychopath

474
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:12,260
and a sociopath

475
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:15,730
get in a fight,

476
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:22,130
who will win?

477
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:25,010
Look at my handwriting.

478
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:29,070
  Chapter 3: Alexithymia  

479
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:33,330
What is this? Alexithymia?

480
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:35,870
Inability to express emotions?

481
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:40,150
Can't feel emotions?

482
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,680
There're all sorts of strange people in this world.

483
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:49,380
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

484
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:04,360
I'll take this out as well.

485
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,930
We can't lend Korean language dictionaries.

486
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:10,430
Aren't all books here able to be borrowed?

487
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:12,230
This is an exemption.

488
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:16,120
That's strange. Yoon Jae In said that I could.

489
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,750
  Hey! 

490
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:20,090
  Will you let go? 

491
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:23,300
 I love you so much. 

492
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:30,100
If this is because of a social prejudice you have against me,

493
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,390
that's a misunderstanding.

494
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:35,660
It's not a social prejudice but a social convention.

495
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,100
Two-timers are unacceptable.

496
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,120
It's still a misunderstanding! Whether it be prejudice or convention.

497
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:42,710
The one at the officetel is my brother and the guy earlier is my friend.

498
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:44,590
This is the girl I like—

499
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:46,580
Come out quickly.

500
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:50,880
I just heard something super important.

501
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,760
You heard it?

502
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:56,460
It's not something you should really hear without a bouquet. Were you shocked?

503
00:42:56,460 --> 00:43:00,230
Dragon Head Hunting Employment Agency. There was a huge organization that sold stolen identities.

504
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:04,140
They were broken up. No, it seems that they are scattered now.

505
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:07,060
My point is, their headquarters still exist.

506
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:08,440
Dragon Employment Agency?

507
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,120
That doesn't ring a bell?

508
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:15,700
Kang Hee Sook, Park Soo Young, and Kim Gap Yong. They bought and sold IDs.

509
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:16,900
Kim Gap Yong?

510
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:19,730
What's this dry reaction?

511
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:21,800
What was the important thing you were talking about?

512
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,570
No, I'm glad you didn't hear.

513
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:29,600
So where are those headquarters that still exist?

514
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:38,730
- What's that? 
 - Is it not working?

515
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:40,080
Here, let me look.

516
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:44,460
I once entered a shooting competition and won an award, you see.

517
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:46,860
Watch carefully.

518
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:49,450
If I shoot ten bullets, eleven hit the target.

519
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,010
I'm even better at archery.

520
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:55,270
Please watch.

521
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:57,180
Got to lick it.

522
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:59,150
 Eww, that's gross. 

523
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:00,250
It's not gross.

524
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:02,800
And take aim like this.

525
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,410
Did you see that? That's how good I am.

526
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:20,810
One shot, one kill.

527
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:25,470
Ma'am, did the kids do that?

528
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:29,040
I told you guys not  to aim at people!

529
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:35,440
If the kids did it, it would have at least been cute.

530
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,070
Shooting award, my foot.

531
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:41,750
I got an award in a race, too.

532
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:45,270
He's seriously so annoying!

533
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:48,760
Here?

534
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:54,150
Yes. Lieutenant Nam clearly said that the employment agency was here.

535
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:57,050
It's there.

536
00:44:57,050 --> 00:44:58,650
  Dragon Headhunting Employment Agency 

537
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:01,100
Oh, that's right.

538
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:11,730
They use this entire building?

539
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:17,680
Did we come to the wrong place?

540
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,640
That Dragon Employment Agency or Dragon Hunting or whatever,

541
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,170
I heard they went out of business but I guess they're not.

542
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:27,570
I don't have a good feeling about this.

543
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:31,330
Are you prophesying things now? Let's just take a glimpse and leave.

544
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:33,710
It'd be even better if you touch a little, too.

545
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:37,320
Alright. I'm better at practice than theory anyway.

546
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:42,280
I'd show them what I can do if the group didn't get scattered.

547
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:06,200
Welcome customer.

548
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:09,220
Is this your first time at Dragon Head Hunting?

549
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:10,100
Yes.

550
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,520
Come this way.

551
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:34,660
Didn't you say...

552
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:37,790
They got scattered?

553
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:41,260
Apparently, they didn't.

554
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:44,510
I think there was a misunderstanding.

555
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:53,750
You want full reinforcement, not just "some" reinforcements?

556
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:56,960
Everyone knows there's something fishy about that company.

557
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,830
Exactly, so why do you have to root them out now?

558
00:46:59,830 --> 00:47:02,360
Aren't you two investigating the suitcase murder case?

559
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:06,420
What we can tell you for now, is that the suitcase muder case and this company are related.

560
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:08,880
That's the only information I get?

561
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,920
We're not at the stage to be able to explain yet.

562
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,000
Why can't you explain it?

563
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,130
I heard the two bodies found by the river

564
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:20,830
were killed by Kim Gap Yong, a member of that group.

565
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:26,320
And he's the witness in the Hanmin Care Home fire, right?

566
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:29,330
Who told you that? It's classified information.

567
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:33,490
I'm glad you said that. I'm the Police Commissioner, so why can't I know about it?

568
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:36,690
I'm the one on the inside, not the outside.

569
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:39,630
You planted a spy on your own daughter?

570
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:40,590
Detective Eun.

571
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:42,490
Yes, I did. So what?

572
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:43,240
Sir.

573
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:48,390
I'm not giving you any reinforcements until you bring me the detailed evidence and witnesses

574
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:52,180
about who murdered those two victims.

575
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:01,880
Our Detective Meticulous should take care of her tail first.

576
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:05,520
I know who it is. It's Detective Lee for certain.

577
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,880
This is why he reeked of nepotism.

578
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,550
And I'm hearing this from the Police Commissioner's daughter?

579
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:16,460
I got to this point solely with my own abilities.

580
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:20,150
Anyway, it's impossible to make your father understand

581
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:22,560
the relationship between the suitcase murders and Kim Gap Yong for now.

582
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:28,090
I know. We can't tell him about Ahn's psychometry ability either.

583
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:31,720
But that doesn't mean we can just break into that company without any backup like a fool.

584
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,980
Give me some time.

585
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:37,490
I'll think of a way.

586
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:49,670
Nice to meet you.

587
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:54,040
Have you registered for a membership at Dragon Head Hunting?

588
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:56,110
Its our first time.

589
00:48:56,110 --> 00:48:58,620
Can I see your ID card?

590
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:00,950
I didn't bring my ID card.

591
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:06,800
My age is  25 and my name is Yoon Jae... Soon.

592
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:13,830
I'm 25 as well and my name is Lee Ahn Dong.

593
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:17,570
What a perfect age to work.

594
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:20,350
Do you two happen to be in a relationship?

595
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:21,910
- No. 
- Yes.

596
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:23,790
- Yes. 
 - No.

597
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:29,330
We're at the perfect age to work and to date.

598
00:49:32,270 --> 00:49:34,350
This is the membership registration form.

599
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:37,680
There's no membership fee, and you get the first service for free.

600
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:42,090
We're always providing our customers with the most suitable jobs.

601
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:46,580
Read carefully and you don't have to fill it out if you don't want to.

602
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:51,260
Can a credit delinquent become a member?

603
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:57,430
Oh, are you a credit delinquent? Both of you?

604
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:02,480
Yes.

605
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:06,030
Then you must work harder in such a situation.

606
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:09,610
We have a separate employee in charge of that department.

607
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:18,250
Just a moment. Drink these while you wait.

608
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,310
What was that?

609
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:31,040
It feels like we'll actually be employed somewhere at this rate.

610
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,370
I think we came to the wrong place.

611
00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:37,880
Let's just briefly look around and discuss it with Prosecutor Kang and Officer Eun.

612
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:45,970
What is this?

613
00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:05,190
- These people... 
 - What's wrong?

614
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:09,600
That punk, put something in those drinks.

615
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:16,820
No way. Sleeping pills?

616
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:18,790
Probably.

617
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:21,820
So Lieutenant Nam was right about this organization.

618
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:26,750
It became more organized instead of falling apart.

619
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:31,900
  VIP Counselling Room  

620
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:49,060
Where are you going, customers?

621
00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:54,820
I'm going to get my ID card.

622
00:51:56,230 --> 00:52:01,370
Are you going to bring Prosecutor Kang and Officer Eun the next time you come?

623
00:52:08,130 --> 00:52:12,380
  Let's just briefly look around and discuss with Prosecutor Kang and Officer Eun.  

624
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:15,390
It's too late to just leave now.

625
00:52:15,390 --> 00:52:17,250
What do we do?

626
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:18,750
Who are you guys?

627
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:19,800
Do you know how to fight?

628
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,320
You know I don't do anything without being the best, right?

629
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:24,850
I graduated as top student at the police academy.

630
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,400
You're going to have to fight very well.

631
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,950
If not, I might have to touch you to save you.

632
00:52:29,950 --> 00:52:34,260
Sure. I wasn't planning on blocking you out anymore anyway.

633
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:36,170
What?

634
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:38,620
What do you mean by that?

635
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:44,120
Come on,

636
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,000
it's great that you two are a thing but,

637
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
could you focus on us for now?

638
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,870
We're not in the position to be ignored.

639
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:06,980
I have some very important business now.

640
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:10,350
Since we're here, raise your hand if you know Kim Gap Yong.

641
00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:12,970
I'm going to go exactly for whoever that is.

642
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:08,980
I said it's fine!

643
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:11,130
It's a habit!

644
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,830
Yoon Jae In, let's go.

645
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:32,690
Move!

646
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,580
Move!

647
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,570
Get lost!

648
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:51,630
What's this?

649
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:53,500
Get them.

650
00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:01,620
Catch them!

651
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:19,380
Detective Lee! Get every single one of them.

652
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:21,320
What is this situation?

653
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:23,270
The police?

654
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:48,390
How did they know to come? Did you call them?

655
00:56:48,390 --> 00:56:50,470
Are you crazy?

656
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:52,820
We'll be in trouble if they find out we came here on our own.

657
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:54,860
Let's hurry and leave.

658
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:32,430
What is this? I'm a police officer.

659
00:57:32,430 --> 00:57:35,220
Why am I running from the police?

660
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:39,330
Can you let go of this first?

661
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:49,180
Let's make sure things got settled and leave.

662
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:51,100
Okay.

663
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,460
If they find out that we came here on our own,

664
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:57,060
we'd lose all the brownie points we got in the autopsy room yesterday.

665
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:12,470
46, 47...

666
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:15,870
What on earth did I just do?

667
00:58:15,870 --> 00:58:18,630
You jumped into the fire without any protection.

668
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:22,860
My biggest fear became a reality.

669
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:24,340
What's that?

670
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:27,660
Being dumbed down while trying to train you.

671
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:29,770
You were the one who suggested coming here.

672
00:58:29,770 --> 00:58:31,750
I know.

673
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:34,100
After meeting you again,

674
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:37,110
I've become impatient.

675
00:58:40,970 --> 00:58:46,470
Actually... I made a confession to you before.

676
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:49,310
Confession?

677
00:58:50,150 --> 00:58:52,850
That if I met you again,

678
00:58:52,850 --> 00:58:55,860
I wouldn't run away.

679
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:58,910
I said it as I left the rooftop.

680
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:02,820
 Lee Ahn,  

681
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:05,250
 Just in case... 

682
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:09,600
  If you can read my presence here using psychometry,  

683
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:13,420
  I want to tell you that  

684
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:15,680
  your offer to help  

685
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:20,240
  gave me strength for a brief time.  

686
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:25,750
  Continue to develop your ability.  

687
00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:28,560
   Then when I become confident,  

688
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:39,080
  I'll come and look for you.  

689
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:44,480
I've already heard that confession.

690
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:45,300
Really?

691
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:47,690
I told you.

692
00:59:47,690 --> 00:59:50,840
That strangely my psychometry works better when I'm with you.

693
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:53,790
That's really a mystery.

694
00:59:55,110 --> 00:59:59,830
Well, I, myself, am a mystery.

695
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:04,380
We met again not because you came to me, but by coincidence.

696
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:09,590
I was waiting because I was afraid you'd run away if I came on too strong.

697
01:00:09,590 --> 01:00:14,590
Although, I wouldn't say that I've developed my abilities.

698
01:00:14,590 --> 01:00:18,920
That's true.

699
01:00:21,570 --> 01:00:27,020
But, I've made up mind to really try this time.

700
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:32,400
Today?

701
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,420
Now? Here?

702
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:37,810
Yes. Before you change your mind.

703
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:44,770
Use me for practice today.

704
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:05,450
No,

705
01:01:06,190 --> 01:01:11,630
the most sensitive part is this, right?

706
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:25,370
What? This is really awkward for me right now.

707
01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:32,630
You are wrong.

708
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:36,750
It's not there.

709
01:01:37,450 --> 01:01:42,200
I told you. The most sensitive part

710
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:45,930
is here.

711
01:01:56,490 --> 01:02:03,430


712
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:11,460
  He is Psychometric   

713
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:14,100
♫  I know you lie  ♫

714
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:21,020
♫  Feel your heart, the coincidences that keep repeating itself with us  ♫

715
01:02:21,020 --> 01:02:23,630
♫  Feel your heart, the coincidences that keep repeating itself with us  ♫

716
01:02:23,630 --> 01:02:29,150
♫  So take, the feelings that I've been hiding  ♫

717
01:02:29,150 --> 01:02:33,950
♫  Take all the time I've been saving up for you  ♫

718
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:38,240
♫  Don't be afraid  ♫

719
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:40,240
 - Where? 
 - Give me your home address. 

720
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:41,620
 Today's lesson will take place there. 

721
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:44,020
 My daughter, your shoelaces are untied again. 

722
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:45,080
 Dad? 

723
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:46,890
 There's someone I need to teach a lesson or two. 

724
01:02:46,890 --> 01:02:48,110
 Use me 

725
01:02:48,110 --> 01:02:48,880
 for practice today. 

726
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:50,550
 Those two don't know yet, right? 

727
01:02:50,550 --> 01:02:52,500
 You act proud, but you're actually a pervert. 

728
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:54,690
 Hi. Call me if you need any help. 

729
01:02:54,690 --> 01:02:56,720
 Don't forget that I said you'd be in danger. 

730
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:58,490
 I think we should start with this woman. 

731
01:02:58,490 --> 01:03:01,590
 If someone who's precious to Kang Seong Mo is in danger, that's not me. 

732
01:03:01,590 --> 01:03:02,680
  Be careful!  

733
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:05,290
 The murderer died. What is there to hide anyway? 

734
01:03:05,290 --> 01:03:06,340
 You got caught red-handed. 

735
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:10,610
♫   Change, all the hard feelings you've tried to hide   ♫
