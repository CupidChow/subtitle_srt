 December 10th, 2005 
YSS Funeral Hall 

4
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,580
Why did you save me?

5
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:05,900
You should have just let me go together with my mom and dad.

6
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,100
Mom.

7
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:20,270
Mom!

8
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:28,330
Dad!

9
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,930
You can go downstairs first.

10
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,400
This is where you've been.

11
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,760
Have you found the person that I spoke to you about?

12
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,990
Didn't I tell you? There's no such person.

13
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:55,130
I'm sure that I saw someone.

14
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:59,650
That night in front of our apartment, that person was watching us.

15
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,680
Alright, I'll look further into that person.

16
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,880
So you can stop talking about that matter here.

17

  Breaking News: Hero of the Yeongseong Apartment arson case revealed to be the culprit..." 

18
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,340
Hyung, What is that saying?

19
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,270
The man that saved us is the culprit?

20
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,400

  Yeongseong Apartment Arson Culprit Yoon Tae Ha Arrested 

22
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:25,170
 I will go and save your mom and dad now, okay? 

23
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,120
Are you alright? What's wrong?

 - Episode 10 - 

27
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:09,480
You— Your dad is...

28
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,590
Yoon Tae Ha?

29
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:22,770
You know my dad?

30
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,660
No way.

31
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,960
You also know about that case?

32
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,230
My dad was framed.

33
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,560
My dad was a firefighter before he worked as a security guard.

34
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,910
The person who was most worried about the apartment catching fire was my dad,

35
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:52,540
and when the apartment was on fire, my dad was the one to bring people out.

36
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,070
He's definitely not that type of person.

37
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,200
He's not that type of person?

38
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,690
That's the only reason you believe him?

39
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,130
Lee Ahn.

40
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,340
After I got this sh*tty ability,

41
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:34,600
do you know what torments me the most?

42
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,450
Those punks who act like goody-two-shoes on the outside.

43
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:43,080
I've seen all of the atrocious things that they do when no one's looking.

44
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,900
The fact that human beings are dirty, hideous, and awful,

45
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,300
he's first person who ever made me feel those things!

46
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:03,600
The person that I'll resent as long as I live is

47
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,280
your father.

48
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,520
What are you talking about?

49
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:20,450
Ahn, explain it to me so that I can understand.

50
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,870
Ahn.  Lee Ahn!

51
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:13,030
 Is your dad a policeman? 

52
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:16,870
 Then could you ask him to free my dad? 

53
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:20,250
 My dad really isn't a bad person. 

54
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,710
 My dad isn't here. 

55
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,880
 When the apartment caught fire, along with my mom 

56
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,130
 and dad and many other people,  

57
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,850
 they all died. 

58
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,830
What's going on?

59
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:46,060
♫  On some days when I look into your eyes  ♫

60
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:54,190
♫  Why do I keep seeing through the past?  ♫

61
00:10:54,190 --> 00:11:01,410
♫  And I'm falling down with you  ♫

62
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:17,170
♫  Sometimes when I feel you in my arms  ♫

63
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:25,050
♫  I can feel your sorrow through your pains  ♫

64
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:32,840
♫  And I'll always be with you  ♫

65
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,320
♫  Always come  ♫

66
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:41,580
♫  Always come  ♫

67
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:48,800
♫   Listen to my voice into the night   ♫

68
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,700
♫   And hope   ♫

69
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:57,130
♫   I’ll find a way   ♫

70
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:03,730
♫  I can be the one with you always  ♫

71
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:12,060
What on earth did I do to him?

72
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:19,240
♫  And let me be there to guide your way  ♫

73
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:24,150
♫  It's okay to cry  ♫

74
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:31,260
♫  Someday we all fall down  ♫

75
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,890
 My dad caught a lot of bad guys today. 

76
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:44,750
 It's okay to say stuff like that louder. 

77
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:52,990
 I'll go save your mom and dad, okay? 

78
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:55,000
 What does that mean? 

79
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,830
 The man who saved us is the culprit? 

80
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:05,520
 Even if your father did wrong, it's not your fault. 

81
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,380
 The world doesn't think that way. 

82
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,470
 Why do you care about what the world thinks? 

83
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:13,690
 It's fine as long as the people you like don't think that way. 

84
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:21,030
♫   Just remember that when you lie  ♫

85
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:28,710
♫  That you're not alone 'cause I will be with you  ♫

86
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:31,080
So this is what it's like.

87
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:36,730
The feeling of being unable to breathe.

88
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:45,120
♫   And I'lI walk with you always all the time ♫ 

89
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:52,210
  For Yoon Jae In's Emergency Use  

90
00:13:52,210 --> 00:14:03,110
♫  It's okay to cry, someday we all fall down  ♫

91
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:06,720
Why does this have to happen to me? Why?

92
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:11,840
What do you want me to do&gt;

93
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,380
  The sketch of this woman who lived as Kang Hee Sook and Park Soo Young, 

94
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:46,990
  Don't you think she resembles Prosecutor Kang's mother, Kang Eun Joo? 

95
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:16,070
Like I said when the sketch was being made, she only worked for a short time.

96
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:19,780
And she didn't speak much, so I don't remember exactly either.

97
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:22,560
But since you're the only person who remembers,

98
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,070
I ask for your help.

99
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:34,990
 Hanmin Care Home 
Room 701 

100
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,470
 Did all the other patients go somewhere? 

101
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:41,770
 - They went for physical therapy. 
 - It's suffocating, isnt't it? 

102
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:45,320
  Those bars make me feel like this place is a prison cell sometimes. 

103
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,430
I think it is this woman.

104
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:54,560
Can you please take another look?  Are you sure it was really  this woman?

105
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,510
 It's suffocating, isn't it? 

106
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:01,790
  Those bars make me feel like this place is a prison cell sometimes. 

107
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:07,930
  A bird that's been trapped in a cage its entire life 

108
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:10,900
 won't fly away even if you open the door for them. 

109
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,390
  Pardon? 

110
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:19,970
 Whether the bird trapped in the cage would suffer more, 

111
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:23,900
 or the bird unable to fly even when given freedom, 

112
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:29,590
 I don't know anymore. 

113
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:33,630
 Yes, I'm sure it was this woman. 

114
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:03,510
  We found the copy of Kim Song Hee's ID card from the data confiscated from Dragon Head Hunting. 

115
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:07,300
 How come Prosecutor Kang knew this important information 

116
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,100
 And why didn’t he tell us? 

117
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,990
  Kim Song Hee 

118
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:21,720
 If Prosecutor Kang knew that the woman who lived as Kang Hee Sook and Park Soo Young 

119
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,240
 was now living as Kim Song Hee...  

120
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,840
 But, why didn't you say anything to me? 

121
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,950
 That's really strange, isn't it? 

122
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:43,310
 Then what about this case? 

123
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,760
 Why are you trying to close the case so fast? 

124
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,060
 It's just a simple fire case. 

125
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,970
 But I'm bothered that you keep relating it to the Yeongseong Apartment case. 

126
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:52,390
 The composite sketch of the fake Kang Hee Sook. 

127
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:57,220
  - Was this person there also? 
 - No. 

128
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,660
  Who on earth is this woman?  

129
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,870
  The sketch of this woman who took the identities of Kang Hee Sook and Park Soo Young  

130
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:05,280
  Don't you think she resembles Prosecutor Kang's mother Kang Eun Joo? 

131
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,710
  But Prosecutor Kang's mother passed away during the Yeongseong apartment fire. 

132
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,870
  Prosecutor Kang, you would know better than anyone. 

133
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:19,230
 You even participated in your mother's autopsy at a young age. You observed the case that closely. 

134
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:22,360
 Do you truly swear 

135
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,450
 that there were no faults regarding that case? 

136
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:29,800
  - Prosecutor Kang.    
   - Just like the care home arson case, I remember that the Yeongseong Apartment case 

137
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,170
  was wrapped up quite quickly.  

138
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:36,090
 And tell your father this. 

139
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:39,690
 To spend this time reinvestigating the Yeongseong Apartment case instead. 

140
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,990
  He knew it all along. 

141
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,360
 Prosecutor Kang knew 

142
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,030
 that his mother was alive all along. 

143
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,760
Dad, you're inside, right?

144
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:58,020
Oh good, you're here. I was just about to call you over.

145
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:03,120
Your mother said she's getting so many blind date offers for you after the briefing.

146
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:10,050
Well, that's a private matter so we'll talk about it at home.

147
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:14,260
What case do you want to take on this time? I've picked out a few good ones.

148
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,210
 Gyunggeun-dong Abduction Case, Woman Murder Case 

149
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:17,260
What is this?

150
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,770
Now that the suitcase case is over you'll need to start on a new case.

151
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:24,440
Who said it's over? The woman who used Park Soo Young and Kang Hee Sook's identities—

152
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,590
We still haven't found her.

153
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:31,570
She's just one of those who were involved in the identity theft.

154
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,930
You think I let you be a detective just to deal with minor cases?

155
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:38,070
You've started this, so play in the big pool.

156
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:41,630
The Hanmin Care Home and Yeongseong Apartment Arson Case,

157
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:45,470
I'm certain that the two are related to the suitcase case.

158
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:48,850
Yeongseong Apartment?

159
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:53,180
Do you have anything to say to me?

160
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,360
Like what?

161
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,130
You said you investigated everything thoroughly,

162
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:03,560
that everything was done properly! So then, why doesn't this have Seong Mo's statement?

163
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,020
  Yeongseong Apartment   
  2005 Arson Murder Case 

164
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,430
Kang Seong Mo told me the first time I went to the orphanage,

165
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:10,130
that instead of going to the orphanage to give pity and sympathy,

166
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:12,350
to reinvestigate the Yeongseong Apartment arson case.

167
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,800
There was a bloodstained security guard's uniform at the scene,

168
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,960
and the security guard's motive for murder was certain.

169
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,140
How could I surely rely on a child's words and start a reinvestigation?

170
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,330
Is that really it?

171
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,610
It wasn't because there was some other reason?

172
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:28,520
What other reason could there be?

173
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:37,820
- I'm going to properly reinvestigate the Yeongseong Apartment Murder Case. 
- What?

174
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:41,320
Don't stop me. If you get in the way again,

175
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:45,420
then that means that you are definitely hiding something.

176
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:48,230
Don't disappoint me any further.

177
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:53,850
Eun Ji Soo. Ji Soo!

178
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:11,070
  The person you have reached is unavailable... 

179
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:17,120
 I need to talk to you. Call me. 

180
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:28,790
 Secret Agent (Lee Seung Yong)  

181
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,220
Hello, Detective Lee.

182
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:37,700
You found the records of Kim Song Hee?

183
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,180
  It's a small island called Muhyung Island in Jeolla Province.  

184
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:43,960
 There's a record of Kim Song Hee receiving treatment from the health center there a month ago. 

185
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:49,330
 But Prosecutor Kang has already confirmed it at dawn. 

186
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:53,860
 Hey! If Prosecutor Kang confirmed at dawn why am I just finding out now? 

187
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,920
Forget it, I'm hanging up.

188
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,080
 Detective Eun, wait a moment! 

189
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,820
There is something more important than that.

190
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,480
 What else? 

191
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,160
Prosecutor Kang requested for a leave this morning.

192
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,010
He applied for a leave? Why?

193
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:10,550
I don't know. According to the office manager,

194
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:14,060
 he said to update him on further details via email. 

195
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,830
He went out of contact after that.

196
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,880
His end of leave is also indefinite.

197
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,200
Indefinite?

198
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,530
 The prosecutor's office is very upset 

199
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:25,100
 about his sudden and unplanned leave. 

200
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,410
Okay, I'll call you back later.

201
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:38,170
What exactly are you thinking, Kang Seong Mo?

202
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,980
  Seoheun Community Security Center 

203
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:36,000
 The fact that people are dirty, hideous and awful, 

204
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,480
 he that made me feel that way for the first time. 

205
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:46,780
 The person I'll resent as long as I live is your father. 

206
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:01,040
 How can we help you? 

207
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:11,760
It's broken again. Constable Yoon, the center's security camera is broken again.

208
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,240
Constable Yoon.

209
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,450
Yes, this is Constable Yoon from the Seoheun Community Security Center.

210
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:25,270
Hello?

211
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,780
Did you call me?

212
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,640
I see you're trying to be funny but that's old-fashioned.

213
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,500
If you're going to pull that type of comedy,

214
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,420
you need something like this to spice things up.

215
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,880
- I said the security camera outside is acting up again.
- Oh,

216
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,630
I forgot to call the control center yesterday. I'll get to it soon.

217
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:54,300
While you're at it, ask them to install one on your head, too, so we can see why you're acting like this.

218
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:03,400
Constable Yoon, you have a fever.

219
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,640
I’m fine.

220
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,390
That rascal.

221
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,790
It's not him.

222
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:15,580
- Hello, 
- The doorstep is going to get worn down at this rate.

223
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,990
What do you mean it'll get worn down?

224
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:19,710
Yoon Jae In, have you seen Lee Ahn?

225
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:24,260
No, why?

226
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:27,320
I can't get in touch with him it's been this way since last night.

227
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,950
You can't reach him?

228
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:31,610
If you can't reach him then you should go to his house. Why would you come here?

229
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:33,800
Isn't it faster to come here?

230
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,690
His car was here though.

231
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:38,210
- Ms. Kim already came to work. 
 - Does she look all right?

232
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:42,680
Do you think she'd be okay? Her face seemed rotten.

233
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,100
Why is your face rotten?

234
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,240
Did you have a fight with Lee Ahn?

235
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,820
I will be back.

236
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:04,750
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by the 🙏🏼 Just One Touch 🙏🏼 Team at Viki   

237
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:29,210
 Send all the bad memories to me. 

238
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:34,200
 From now on, I’ll only give you good memories. 

239
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,550
 The person I'll live the rest of my live resenting is 

240
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:41,290
 your father. 

241
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:04,990
 CCTV 

242
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,730
I never understood

243
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,530
why you would drink something so bitter.

244
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,130
Here I am drinking it myself, too.

245
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:41,390
  Lee Jung Rok
 Yoo Jin Hee 
We miss you and love you 

246
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:56,180
Hello.

247
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:02,090
- Lets go to the hospital
- Don't mind it.

248
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:06,620
With your hand in that state what would you do if you dropped her? Give her to me.

249
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:10,490
Eun Sol is really shy. She's going to be shocked.

250
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,560
You call this being shy?

251
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,580
She's laughing at me, isn't she?

252
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:28,390
Smelly, smelly, ugh!

253
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:34,070
You take after your mom's pretty smile.

254
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:38,350
But your mom doesn't realize that she's prettier when she smiles than when she's mad.

255
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,430
Wow!

256
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:46,160
What did the doctor say?

257
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:49,950
She said the obvious, she said not to use the hand for the meantime.

258
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,930
She said not to use it.

259
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:59,840
What to do, your mom hurt her hand.

260
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,390
I guess you're going to see me often for the meantime!

261
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:10,450
 Emergency Room 

262
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:15,880
Jae In.

263
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:25,160
Is something going on?

264
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:30,750
I feel like I'm going back and forth between heaven and hell in one day.

265
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:37,290
 The person you are trying to reach cannot be connected... 

266
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:40,490
Why are they both in that state? Did they fight?

267
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:43,610
No, they both hurt themselves at work.

268
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,890
But why is Lee Ahn not picking up?

269
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:51,580
You've definitely moved up in terms of status. You even babysit So Hyun's daughter.

270
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:55,760
As if. Can't you see that I don't even get to sit with them?

271
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,750
What about Lee Ahn? You can't reach him?

272
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:02,420
Yes. It looks like Yoon Jae In has something to do with it.

273
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:06,750
If  Yoon Jae In is in this state then Ahn must be in an even worse state.

274
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:20,260
  Ji Soo Noona 

275
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:28,590
  Ji Soo Noona 

276
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:42,090
I must really be dumb.

277
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:54,020
No matter how I think about it, there's no answer.

278
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:04,020
When I think about you, Mom and Dad,

279
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:14,250
that person, even that girl... I can't help but resent them.

280
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:23,530
But the thought of me shaking off her hand...

281
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,590
I can't get it out of my head.

282
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:40,200
Even though I know the heart she had as she reached her hand to me,

283
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:50,210
even though she didn't do anything wrong...

284
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:10,780
Why isn't this guy answering either?

285
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,300
I'm going to go crazy.

286
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:23,050
Get on. I'll drive you.

287
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:25,200
I want to get some air.

288
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,050
And sober up, too.

289
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:28,380
But your ankle is hurt.

290
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,980
It's better now.

291
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:33,610
I'll take a taxi when it starts hurting. Don’t worry about me.

292
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:37,710
Don't wander around too much and head inside, got it?

293
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:39,710
I'll leave the two girls in your care.

294
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:43,470
Don't worry, I'll bring them home safely.

295
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:45,470
Forget it, just go.

296
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:47,120
No, you drank.

297
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,940
Wouldn't it be better than some stranger driving you home?

298
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,250
I'd rather take the stranger.

299
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:56,490
I didn't even drink just to drive you.

300
00:32:56,490 --> 00:33:01,810
I give up. I'm only going to take Eun Sol so you can walk or run or whatever you want.

301
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:05,720
Lee Dae Bong! Hey!

302
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,560
You aren't getting out?

303
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,400
Dae Bong is a good guy.

304
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,160
I know.

305
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,090
I know. That's why I'm like this.

306
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:18,100
Hey! Stop, stop!

307
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,940
Who said you could take my daughter?

308
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:25,850
Fasten your seatbelt now.

309
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:30,960
I'll also get going.

310
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:34,770
Be careful with your foot.

311
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:37,580
Why can't you say it?

312
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:41,620
Why is Ji Soo suddenly making a fuss about reinvestigating the Yeongseong apartment case?

313
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:44,290
You're right beside her so you should know.

314
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:46,020
I don't know.

315
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:46,940
You don't know?

316
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:51,270
Even if I knew, I said I wouldn't be your secret agent anymore, Chief.

317
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:54,200
Seriously, I can't tell you because I don't know.

318
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,720
- Earlier today, what was the stuff that you went to go see Detective Eun about? 
 - What?

319
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,280
I'm asking on a professional level, not personal.

320
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,550
Tell me everything you've found out until now.

321
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:07,680
Officer Eun Ji Soo found out that the woman from the composite sketch

322
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:11,910
is currently living with the name Kim Song Hee and went to find her.

323
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:16,930
Are you trying to say that she found out the woman that changed her identity with the help of Kim Gab Yong,

324
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:17,960
who killed Kang Hee Sook and Park Soo Young?

325
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,210
She hasn't found her, but she is planning to.

326
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:25,170
Anyway, Detective Eun left this morning, and Prosecutor Kang went to go find that woman.

327
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:27,550
But he suddenly submitted for a leave of absense.

328
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:31,320
What on earth does that woman have to do with Yeongseong apartment?

329
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:35,660
That woman is related to the Yeongseong apartment case?

330
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,800
Get out. Get out right now!

331
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,630
Yes, Sir!

332
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:46,060
What on earth did they found out about?

333
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:16,150
 Yeongseong Apartment Redevelopment Confirmation. 
 Migration period: Octber 19, 2018-January 19, 2019 (3 months). 
YSS Construction.
 

334
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:21,600
  Elevator: 7th floor 

335
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,910
The things that happened back then...

336
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,490
Of course there's no way I can see them.

337
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,140
♫   I can see the look in your eyes   ♫

338
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:27,920
♫   I can hear your heart   ♫

339
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:33,320
♫   Without having to say anything   ♫

340
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,850

341
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:44,250
♫   And I can’t see your eyes   ♫

342
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:48,010
♫   My heart remembers   ♫

343
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:57,260
♫   After a long time passes by   ♫

344
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:01,190
♫   When the memory of you  approaches me  ♫

345
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:04,790
♫   When the memory of you  approaches me  ♫

346
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:08,540
♫   If I call your name    ♫

00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:12,190

353
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:36,870
♫   I’ll recognize your heart   ♫

355
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:45,370

356
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:49,340
♫   And wait for you   ♫

357
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:57,320
♫   Your eyes tell me   ♫

358
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:06,760
♫   My heart remembers you   ♫

359
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,350
What did you say?

360
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:19,020
- Wait a minute, you're saying that Jae In's dad is the culprit of the Yeongseong Apartment fire?
 - Yes.

361
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:23,180
It seems like Ahn found out about that. Even if he was shocked,

362
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:26,080
how could he just go off the grid like this?

363
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,160
It's not Jae In's fault.

364
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,190
Gosh, this is crazy.

365
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:33,170
It's not like he didn't know Jae In was a criminal's daughter.

366
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:37,250
The huge words that were written on the school wall. He went searching for her even after seeing that.

367
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,420
But why now?

368
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:41,060
Ahn's parents

369
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:44,160
passed away from the Yeongseong Apartment fire.

370
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:46,960
What?

371
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:38,890
I'm sorry, for leaving you alone yesterday,

372
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,940
Did you eat?

373
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:46,080
Did you sleep well?

374
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:59,080
Who am I even saying this to?

375
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,860
This was in the car.

376
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:21,290
It's from Yoon Jae In.

377
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:24,730
 The music box I made earlier, I put it in the back seat.   

378
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:28,730
 I worked really hard on it, but I'm not sure if you'll like it.   

379
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:33,860
Looking at this right now, it's too cruel.

380
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:38,030
Should I throw it out? I'll throw it out if you tell me to.

381
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:41,020
Dae Bong...

382
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:45,130
About me...

383
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:50,060
I thought that I liked her a lot,

384
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:52,880
but maybe that wasn't the case.

385
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,780
Running away so fast like that...

386
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:58,190
This isn't a problem that can be resolved by liking someone.

387
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,660
Jae In said this.

388
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:06,820
When we discovered the body in the carrier,

389
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:11,180
what kind of person the deceased woman was,

390
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:14,780
how this person's family would feel,

391
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:18,150
what happened for them to die this way...

392
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:21,550
She asked me if I had ever thought about this seriously.

393
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:24,220
Meanwhile, Jae In

394
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:32,620
never lightly brought up the topic of her dad, not even once.

395
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:40,580
Have I ever seriously thought about her pain?

396
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:46,080
I guess I just wanted to use

397
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:51,520
my silly powers to act like a hero around her,

398
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:55,850
just to look cool,

399
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,770
to impress her.

400
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:07,950
Her wounds, her memories,

401
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:13,850
I talked like I'd take responsibility.

402
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:22,000
But I hurt her the most.

403
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:32,520
With these hands, I said I'd save her.

404
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:40,830
Yet these hands hurt her the most.

405
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:59,540
Oh dear, look at your ankle.

406
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:03,580
How is it? It’s a little better, isn’t it?

407
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:08,560
Why did you raise me, Auntie?

408
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,370
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

409
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:14,640
Dad got arrested and we got kicked out of the neighborhood.

410
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,870
All the relatives turned their backs on me like I was a sinner.

411
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:21,180
But why did you take me in?

412
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:24,990
You saved me.

413
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:27,750
It wasn't the other way around.

414
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,490
When I got divorced,

415
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:35,040
actually,

416
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:39,530
there was a baby in my stomach.

417
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:45,430
But, because I was so mean-spirited back then,

418
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:52,190
the baby realized that and left.

419
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:57,930
At first, I just thought it was all my fault.

420
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:03,540
I cried whenever I opened my eyes.

421
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,970
Ever since I lived with you,

422
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:12,030
I've slowly felt better and better.

423
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:17,120
That little girl is doing the best she can to live.

424
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:21,780
Yes, I should try to live too.

425
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:25,170
I told myself we'd try to get through it together.

426
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:27,350
Sorry.

427
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:33,900
I was too busy thinking about myself to think about your pain.

428
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:40,350
Who doesn't have a painful memory or two in this world?

429
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:45,230
We all fight through it and hide it.

430
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:47,930
That's how everyone lives.

431
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:15,980
 I saw you sitting down and studying with your mom. 

432
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:23,270
 You miss her too, right? Your mom... 

433
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:29,260
  Seong Mo, if I weren't able to see you, 

434
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:32,010
 I'd miss you so much. 

435
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:48,830
I'd like to talk to Prosecutor Kang Seong Mo.

436
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:51,770
 He's currently on his leave.   

437
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:56,430
 You can tell me your message, and I'll relay it to him.   

438
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:59,720
No, I’ll call back next time.

439
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:04,780
  Seoul Prosecutor's Office 

440
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:10,350
Did you finally find it?

441
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:28,050
  Detective Eun Ji Soo 

442
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:32,350
Hello?

443
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:36,470
 Constable Yoon, it's me. I'm in a rush right now, is Ahn with you? 

444
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:37,530
No.

445
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:42,210
Why is he out of contact? This hasn't happened since middle school.

446
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:45,060
  Constable Yoon, by any chance,  

447
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:47,540
  did you get in contact with Prosecutor Kang?  

448
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:48,830
Prosecutor Kang?

449
00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:51,910
Yes, Prosecutor Kang suddenly disappeared.

450
00:48:51,910 --> 00:48:58,620
He came to the security center early this morning.

451
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:13,090
 Prosecutor Kang? 

452
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:19,190
 Prosecutor Kang!  

453
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:32,890
I knew he'd gone to you.

454
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:37,540
Then, did you hear anything from him?

455
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:45,630
 Why did you do that?  

456
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:52,450
 You knew all about my dad. 

457
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:59,550
  You knew it, so how could you? 

458
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:04,580
 You knew Ahn's parents passed away due to the Yeongseong apartment fire. How could you... 

459
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:11,410
 How could you ask me to help Ahn? 

460
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:15,420
  What right do I have for Ahn to help me? 

461
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:23,050
 Officer Yoon, listen carefully to what I have to say from now on. 

462
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,570
  I...  

463
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:35,110
 I know your father isn't the culprit. 

464
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:36,680
 What? 

465
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:40,780
  I can’t explain everything right now, 

466
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,200
  but soon... 

467
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,760
 It will all be revealed. 

468
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:52,740
  I will make sure it happens no matter what. 

469
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:57,440
 Why do you think that my dad isn't the culprit?  

470
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:01,360
 The culprit is someone else.  

471
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:04,950
Who does Prosecutor Kang think the culprit is?

472
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:09,020
If it isn't my father,

473
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:11,000
 who and why set that apartment on fire? 

474
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,360
 Officer Eun, you know, don't you? 

475
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:16,880
I also don’t know in detail,

476
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:21,240
but Prosecutor Kang's mother who we thought passed away during the Yeongseong apartment fire,

477
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:24,160
I think she’s alive.

478
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:28,040
 And Prosecutor Kang has left to confirm it. 

479
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,820
What does that mean?

480
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:33,740
I’m so confused now that I don’t know how to explain it.

481
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:38,970
I'm worried if Ahn finds out Prosecutor Kang disappeared without a word he'll be shocked like he was in the past.

482
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:43,350
If Ahn contacts you, please explain it to him well. I'll call you again.

483
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:52,420
 The culprit is someone else.  

484
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:54,520
 Who is it?  

485
00:51:55,670 --> 00:51:57,040
  I’ll do it with you. 

486
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:01,200
 No, I definitely have to.  

487
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:06,760
 Right now, you need to stay with Ahn. That will be enough. 

488
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:12,140
 He'll need some time but he'll be back soon. 

489
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:18,020
 Soon, I will too.  

490
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:26,400
Where are you going again?

491
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:41,780

Ah, seriously?

494
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:25,690
 Let's meet somewhere else other than the library. 

495
00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:27,690
  Get back safely.  

496
00:54:56,620 --> 00:55:00,460
 What is this? 

497
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:25,540
 Take care of Yoon Jae In! 

498
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:32,190
  Student!  

499
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:34,290
  No, I really did see you from somewhere else.  

500
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:36,840
  Aren't you the prosecutor in charge of the fire incident at the nursing home? 

501
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,160
  What if acid got on your pretty face?  

502
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:42,210
  She shouldn't be acting unpredictably either.  

503
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:44,300
  Like this?

00:56:27,270 --> 00:56:29,510
- Hello? 
 - Why are you not picking up?

508
00:56:29,510 --> 00:56:32,080
Noona, Hyung is acting weird.

509
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:36,500
He left weird things in my room—   Anyway, I can't reach him right now.

510
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:41,480
Ahn. First of all, don't be surprised.

511
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:44,270
Prosecutor Kang took a leave of absence.

512
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:45,130
What?

513
00:56:45,130 --> 00:56:50,420
I think Prosecutor Kang's mother is still alive.

514
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:52,550
What do you mean?

515
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:56,010
This morning he went to Constable Yoon,

516
00:56:56,010 --> 00:56:59,360
told her that Yoon Tae Ha is not the culprit and not to worry,

517
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:02,320
 and went to search for his mother. 

518
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:06,630
That can't be. How can his mother still be alive?

519
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:11,380
 The woman who lived with the identities of Kang Hee Sook and Park Soo Young 

520
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:14,700
is Prosecutor Kang's mother, Kang Eun Joo,

521
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:17,510
that woman with the silver ring you saw.

522
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:24,780
What weird things did he leave in the room?

523
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:28,430
- A map, he left a map. 
 - What kind of map?

524
00:57:28,430 --> 00:57:33,320
It's a map of the area around Seoheun Community Security Center. He marked where all the security cameras are.

525
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:34,830
And...

526
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:40,240
He told me to take care of Yoon Jae In.

527
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:48,070
Lee Ahn. Listen to me carefully from now on.

528
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,530
 Kang Seong Mo said, 

529
00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:03,970
that the more he digs into this case,

530
00:58:04,770 --> 00:58:07,660
the people precious to him will be in danger.

531
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:14,580
He said that the culprit will hurt the people precious to him.

532
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:20,410
 Seong Mo seemed worried about Yoon Jae In. 

533
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:24,790
 The surveillance camera got cut again. Now the streetlamp, too. 

534
00:58:24,790 --> 00:58:27,810
  Someone keeps breaking the Security Center's surveillance cameras. 

535
00:58:27,810 --> 00:58:30,660
 It's already  the third time this month. 

536
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:45,490
Pick up. Please pick up.

537
00:58:56,070 --> 00:58:58,190
Yoon Jae In! Yoon Jae In!

538
00:58:58,190 --> 00:58:59,900

00:59:13,610 --> 00:59:16,910

01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:41,990
  Hyung, you know who this person is right?  

545
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:47,300
  I will find this person and kill him.  

546
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,050
It's that guy.

554
01:03:35,930 --> 01:03:39,190
 Jae In definitely would have left me something, 

555
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:41,970
 traces of herself. 

556
01:03:41,970 --> 01:03:43,980
 It might be unfair   

557
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:47,700
 ecause I could kill your woman.   

558
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:50,000
 Could it be a secret from you, too?   

559
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,440
 Ahn is no longer the boy that used to cry about seeing strange things.
