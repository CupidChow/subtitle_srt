1
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:04,780
 He is Psychometric 

2
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:40,120
 He is Psychometric 

3
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,140
 December 10th, 2005
 One week after the fire 

4
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:57,730
 Is your dad a policeman? 

5
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:58,820
 Yeah. 

6
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,670
 Then can't you ask him to release my dad? 

7
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,860
 My dad really isn't a bad guy. 

8
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,800
 Do you want a piece of candy? 

9
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,960
 Not candy. Your dad. 

10
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,060
 I mean, I was talking about my dad. 

11
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,510
 My dad isn't here. 

12
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,340
 Why not? 

13
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,690
 Did he go somewhere? 

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,730
 There was a fire at our apartment so my mom, my dad, other people... 

15
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:50,220
 A lot of people died. 

16
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,740
 I want to help you but... 

17
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,560
 I'm sorry. 

18
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:18,140


19
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,280
 Lee Ahn. 

20
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,480
 Let's go. 

21
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,300
 Psychometry: A compound word combining 'psyche' and 'metric." An ability to analyze a person or an object by touching them. 

22
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,430
 He is Psychometric 
- Episode 3 - 

23
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,850
So...

24
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:18,490
By "shaking my hand or whatever else," what do you intend to find out with my psychometry?

25
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,880
You see... Well...

26
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:28,190
I heard something so crazy that I must've gone insane earlier. Forget what I said.

27
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:31,890
Don't even worry. My 15th place rank is

28
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:35,810
all because I read people with this.

29
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,490
I found out that So Hyun was the culprit too.

30
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:43,230
Where... how do you touch people

31
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,320
to get the best results with psychometry?

32
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,180
Hands at first.

33
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,900
I think it's because the skin on the fingertips are the most sensitive.

34
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,310
So you can feel things better when you touch sensitive skin?

35
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:01,890
Then basically you react by touch.

36
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,050
Yeah, I think so.

37
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:07,290
But isn't the most sensitive place to touch

38
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,640
your lips?

39
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:24,130
How about it? Want to try psychometry that way?

40
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,250
Why dream this kind of dream?!

41
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,570
Are you in middle school?

42
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:14,040
I'm so embarrassed. Even though I'm by myself, I'm so embarrassed.

43
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,350
Next part of the dream, please.

44
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,800
 Do I seem like a monster? You don't have to look at me like that. 

45
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,500
 You just don't have to come in contact with me. 

46
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,420
 No! 

47
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:50,300
 If you really can do psychometry, 

48
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,840
 and if that's how you found out my dad's prisoner number... 

49
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,780
 What? 

50
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,250
 You're not a monster. 

51
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,640
 I'm going to go over to you, and even if I have to shake your hand or whatever else, 

52
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,730
 there's something I want you to find out. 

53
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,400
 "Shake my hand or whatever else?" 

54
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,380
 You wait right there. I'll go over to you. 

55
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:21,410
 - Hey! Where are you trying to go at this late hour?
- What? 

56
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,900
What on earth did I say to him?

57
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,800
Who?

58
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,230
It's nothing.

59
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,580
You've been acting really weird since yesterday. Do you have something on your mind?

60
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,920
Auntie.

61
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,940
What if, by any chance, someone (re: her dad)â€”

62
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,910
Actually, never mind.

63
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:54,290
What about your dad?

64
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:01,450
What if there was someone who could prove dad was framed?

65
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:03,490
What would you do?

66
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:08,020
Your dad has been serving for the past eleven years.

67
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,940
What's the point of all that now?

68
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,040
Why isn't there a point?

69
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,430
If that happens, then dad can confidently say he's not a murderer and I can also,

70
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,490
stop running away for the rest of my life

71
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:26,220
because I'm scared someone will recognize me as a murderer's daughter.

72
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:30,070
But Jae In, this is

73
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:33,500
something I'm telling you for the first time but

74
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,270
you...

75
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:38,900
What if it's something your dad actually did?

76
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:41,530
That's absurd.

77
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,100
Does it make any sense that a firefighter would kill multiple people by fire?

78
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:52,010
On top of that, the killer stabbed four people. Is that something dad would do?

79
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,920
A person's heart

80
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,970
is not something you can know from the outside.

81
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:00,820
I'm going to school.

82
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:04,530
No, I mean... Jae In, what I'm trying to say is...

83
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:08,640
Do you think it's going to be easy investigating a case from over ten years ago?

84
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,570
I don't want you to get hurt!

85
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,290
Hi.

86
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:42,130
What is this reaction? It's so different from yesterday.

87
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:45,170
Yesterday you were making it sound like you were going to try something with me.

88
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,810
I guess I was a little excited yesterdayâ€”

89
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:51,410
If I use this kind of term, you'll definitely misunderstand.

90
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:54,420
Yesterday, I was a little crazy, insane actually.

91
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,880
Just pretend like you didn't hear anything.

92
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,310
You said it was your dad's prisoner number,

93
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,870
the number I read out loud.

94
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,560
Was he framed?

95
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,030
Isn't that what you wanted me to find out?

96
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,290
No.

97
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:17,980
It's not something I want you to find out, but something I want no one in the world to ever know.

98
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:23,220
You said your secret is your psychometric abilities, right?

99
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,460
Mine is my dad.

100
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:30,900
So let's just pretend like we didn't hear each others' secrets.

101
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:10,110
I forgot something.

102
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,290
I would like for you to not share that we're neighbors to our school peers.

103
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:18,390
Especially that I live on a rooftop.

104
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,940
Why not? There's really no reason for me to say it but

105
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,220
when someone tells me to keep my mouth shut, I want to rebel.

106
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:28,250
As you know, we're going through a tough rage.

107
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,570
You mean, 'tough age.'

108
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:33,240
I hate being looked down upon and being a topic of ridicule.

109
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,220
So you too, if you try to lay a hand on me to find out something,

110
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,350
I'm going to kill you.

111
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:13,290
Don't worry. If our skin doesn't touch, I can't see anything.

112
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:28,440
As expected, buses aren't for me. You go first.

113
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,520
- Is something wrong? 
 - It disappeared.

114
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,460
Who did?

115
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:07,020
The ring.

116
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:11,350
You lost your ring in my car?

117
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:14,280
Kang Hee Sook, the nursing home caretaker!

118
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,930
It was a joke but my timing was off, wasn't it? I'll get going now.

119
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:19,860
Hurry.

120
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,550
It's no use. I waited since last night but she didn't come home.

121
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,690
What did the owner say?

122
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:36,550
Lived here for three years and never missed the rent.

123
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:41,360
But someone else came to sign the contract so the owner never met her.

124
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,820
Unable to be reached after the fire...

125
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:49,540
So I did some investigating and there are more suspicious things.

126
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,610
She secluded herself with bad credit three years ago.

127
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:57,290
Then she suddenly appears and got her license as a nursing home caretaker.

128
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:00,820
But she has no family.

129
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:05,390
There's no one who can testify for her. It's as if she's an invisible woman.

130
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:08,260
Oh, when I showed the lawyers her picture,

131
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:12,110
they all said, "Was this person ever here?"

132
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,980
An invisible woman?

133
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:17,610
It's not even like I'm chasing after a ghost.

134
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:20,680
I don't even know why we're looking for this person.

135
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:26,550
I told Ahn to do some psychometry but I just feel iffy about it all.

136
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:30,480
Her cellphone was disconnected so there's definitely something strange going on.

137
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,280
- So what should we do?
- We should report her missing and wrap things up.

138
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:41,000
They'd think I'm crazy if I suggest looking into the arson case just because I find her suspicious.

139
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,040
Chancellor Eun would love that more than anyone.

140
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,650
Gosh, this makes me crazy.

141
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:52,860
I feel unsatisfied as if I didn't finish wiping my poo.

142
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,550
No, I'm saying that's the feeling.

143
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:02,030
Let's go eat breakfast.

144
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:13,770

145
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:17,760
Lee Ahn! Lee Ahn! Lee Ahn! We're in trouble!

146
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,480
What trouble? The fact that our math teacher got fired or

147
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,030
that the kids who stole the answer sheet ran away overseas?

148
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:27,480
Rich kids really have it easy.

149
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,220
That's not the important thing right now.

150
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,240
Hey.

151
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,280
- Did your dad beat you up?
- I'll be expelled, at the least.

152
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,980
I tried to stop him. But it's okay I didn't use the golf club.

153
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,520
- But that's not the important partâ€” 
- Then this must be about So Hyun.

154
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,790
Yeah. So Hyun came out to school but

155
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:45,730
should I ask her? The baby... what is she going to do?

156
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:48,250
What relation do you have to her?

157
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,870
Don't say "our So Hyun" anymore.

158
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:54,530
Because the memory of your betrayal keeps coming up.

159
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:56,230
Do you really have to call it betrayal?

160
00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:01,790
Hey, if an open kid like you keeps secrets from me, who am I supposed to hang out with?

161
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,660
Ugh, seriously.

162
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,120
I hate people whose insides and outsides are completely different.

163
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,350
Right? I was too much, right?

164
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,800
Don't you think school would be bad for the baby?

165
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,370
Seriously stop it.

166
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:23,340
It's probably not good, right?

167
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,570
 Strawberry Milk 

168
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:39,660
 Bareun Milk 

169
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,610
 What are you doing? 

170
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,550
You're no help.

171
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,100
Seriously...

172
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:09,390
Yoon Jae In. Do you want to go to the club with us today?

173
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:12,150
Your head will hurt if you study too much.

174
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:14,630
- I'm good. 
- It's on us.

175
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:19,160
We feel like you're on our level so we want to welcome you.

176
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,310
Level?

177
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:24,660
My mom is a doctor and her mom is a makchang ( beef entrails ) restaurant chain owner.

178
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:28,750
Even if this school is basically a gutter, not everyone is poor.

179
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:32,630
Ahn, even though he's like that, his brother is a prosecutor.

180
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,840
Dae Bong's family owns a ton of gas stations.

181
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,550
Oh, I see.

182
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:41,670
So that's the level you guys are talking about.

183
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:46,460
Hey, these days, even elementary school kids ask each other how big their houses are while making friends.

184
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:52,780
My mom says your dad will be nominated as a district commissioner. You must be happy.

185
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,050
I've never said that my dad is running for office.

186
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,370
That's not true?

187
00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:02,640
Sorry, I'm not on the same level as you guys with a doctor as a mom and makchang restaurant owners as parents.

188
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,670
So you guys can hang out by yourselves.

189
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:09,530
Wow. This girl is so funny.

190
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:14,490
Hey! What is so great about your dad that you're not on the same level as us?

191
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:16,450
You think your that great?

192
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:19,330
Hey, Kim Eun Sae and Oh Young Eun!

193
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,370
Can you guys get your recycling straight?

194
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:27,900
Why did you put a can in the plastic bin? Are you guys Lee Dae Bong?

195
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,060
We didn't throw that out.

196
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:34,800
Hey, I saw you guys do it. Get it straight.

197
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,710
I'm watching you guys.

198
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,310
Are you sleeping?

199
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:43,080
I'm heating up milk!

200
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,560
 Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency 

201
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:01,390
What are you doing? "We no longer have arraignment rights since the patient from Hanmin Rehabilitation Center passed away."

202
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:04,070
That's what it says. Please stamp it.

203
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:07,730
You said you feel nasty because of the disappearance of the nursing home caretaker.

204
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:11,540
I got a good feeling of what it feels like to not wipe properly.

205
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:14,920
Thereâ€™s no way.

206
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:23,800
Let's check one more time.

207
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:29,290
  Kim Song Hee 
 Female 

208
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,530
- Yes, Prosecutor? 
- I wanted to hear your testimony one more time.

209
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:42,600
I know it's a hassle but could you please come?

210
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,600
 I'm a bit far from there... 

211
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,650
Please.

212
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,490
I understand.

213
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,990
For now, let's push the signing one more day.

214
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:59,580
Thank you so much.

215
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,360
Then let me know when Mr. Kim Gab Yong comes.

216
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,070
I have to leave for a little bit. Please take care of this patient.

217
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,790
- Ms. Kim Song Hee? 
- Yes.

218
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,730
Alright, see you soon.

219
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,850
Aish.

220
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,680
What are you?

221
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:19,880
I don't even expect a greeting from you guys so at least pretend you're studying.

222
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:26,420
Jae In, you can submit the list of colleges you'll want to apply to after discussing with your parent.

223
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,990
Okay.

224
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:32,260
Raise your hands if you still haven't submitted the 'future career report.'

225
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,600
Me. I don't have a place to go.

226
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,990
I know. But I'm getting paid so I can't just waste my time.

227
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:41,330
Submit it by tomorrow!

228
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,410
Whatâ€™s that?

229
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,380
How come you never know anything?

230
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,410
What's all this?

231
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,170
Here.

232
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,020
Oh.

233
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,810
 Liberal Studies department at Seoul National University 

234
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:20,250
I donâ€™t think the shoes and bag are expensive.

235
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,400
They might be.

236
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:27,100
We can know once we see the car.

237
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,420
No?

238
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:34,760
What? She's just leaving?

239
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,110
Fine. Bye.

240
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,020
You got beat up last night,

241
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:59,980
and the next morning, your dad assigns you a driver. I'm so curious about your dad's intentions.

242
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,900
Parental love usually is at its peak

243
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:06,050
a day after you beat your child to death.

244
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:07,770
Mister! Letâ€™s go.

245
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:09,590
Letâ€™s go.

246
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,510
Is that the transfer student?

247
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,480
Who's above the head of the borough?

248
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,020
A city councilman? Is she from a conglomerate family or something?

249
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,700
Why do you keep going up?

250
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,650
Some people are born looking noble.

251
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:40,710
Look at me. Even if I ride in a luxurious car, I still seem like I'm lacking something, right? Now why is that?

252
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:42,770
That's because my dad is a nouveau riche.

253
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:45,800
But she's definitely someone who grew up biting on some gold.

254
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,060
Does she really seem like that?

255
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:50,510
 I would like for you to not share that we're neighbors to our school peers. 

256
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:55,250
 Especially that I live on a rooftop. 

257
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,630
 I hate being looked down upon and being a topic of ridicule. 

258
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:01,230
She lives such a difficult life.

259
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,740
Why?

260
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,560
Nothing.

261
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:51,110
Hello.

262
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:22,110
You acting all high and mighty even here...

263
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:24,890
You brat!

264
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,960
What are you, you punk?

265
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:38,590
If I were you, I wouldn't even walk around because I'd feel so ashamed.

266
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:41,790
Figures. If you were someone who knew what shame was,

267
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:44,050
you wouldn''t sell exam answers to students.

268
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:46,540
Let go! You're not going to let go, you punk?!

269
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,460
Hey, let go! Let the teacher go!

270
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:51,330
What teacher? He isn't even worthy of being called that.

271
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:53,020
This is hydrochloric acid!

272
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,340
I know! So what?

273
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,010
Is it something dangerous?

274
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,590
Is it such a crime to sell exam answers?

275
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:21,780
Even a brat like her can walk around with head high, but what did I do so wrong?

276
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:26,010
I'm going to reveal exactly who you are!

277
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:39,530
This is the CCTV recording.

278
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:42,750
This is the bottle of the drink he was going to spill on me.

279
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,860
It definitely is hydrochloric acid.

280
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:47,840
Apparently, if it touches your skin, it'll burn you.

281
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,250
Did you know that?

282
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:52,530
How could he try to throw that on a girl's face?

283
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:55,700
What were you going to do if I wasn't there?

284
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:59,760
You must have been surprised but you calmly kept the evidence.

285
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,760
Are you okay? You donâ€™t have to go to the hospital?

286
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,480
Iâ€™m okay.

287
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,450
I think you'll need to make a statement at the police station.

288
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:12,210
I'll go after my shift is over. I can't leave right now.

289
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:15,330
Okay. And be sure to tell your parents.

290
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,510
Whose daughter is that smart?

291
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,100
She's the polar opposite of someone else I know.

292
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:35,450
- Who? Me? 
 - Yeah, you.

293
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:37,730
Do you not know the emergency crime report number 112?

294
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:40,430
Am I your personal officer? Your guardian?

295
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:44,150
This punk always calls me when he gets in trouble. Why are you laughing?

296
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:46,220
You're faster that the emergency crime team.

297
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:48,750
Plus, it's not trouble I caused this time.

298
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:52,870
Today, I'm in the position of having saved someone.

299
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:57,270
Oh, right. Wow. This is awkward.

300
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,920
But who is she? Your friend?

301
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:04,150
She's the girl who made me out to be a pervert last time.

302
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:06,610
I heard the real pervert got caught.

303
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:08,340
What's this? Why are you following her around?

304
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,610
Following her around? Who?

305
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:12,340
She transferred to my class not too long ago.

306
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,400
Transfer?

307
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,930
Yeah. She also moved into the rooftop next to us.

308
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:18,950
Same class and neighbor?

309
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:22,800
Isnâ€™t it more like fate than a coincidence?

310
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,140
What fate?

311
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,520
You're overreacting.

312
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:33,770
 Not until there is someone Ahn truly wants to use psychometry on. 

313
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:36,180
 Who is that? 

314
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,920
 He might have met her already... 

315
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,530
 That child. 

316
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:49,600
Oh wait I have to go. See you later.

317
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:52,140
Thank you.

318
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:22,320
How did you know to come?

319
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,650
I saw him follow you starting from school grounds.

320
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:33,330
You know the timing to say thank you is now, right?

321
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:35,720
When this time passes, it'll only become awkward between us.

322
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:40,450
That sucks. You have to hear me say thank you without an audience again.

323
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:45,990
This is your part-time job?

324
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,090
And this is definitely

325
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,820
a secret too?

326
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:58,110
I don't know why I keep getting caught by you with these things.

327
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:02,390
I'm so annoyingly thankful towards you.

328
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:13,860
Here.

329
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:40,130
Put something down! Hurry hurry!

330
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:44,260
- You overreact too much. 
- It's still hot.

331
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,790
Kimchi, kimchi.

332
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:53,230
My dad told me to apply to Seoul National University.

333
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:58,860
He wants to at least tell people I got rejected by Seoul National University since I won't get accepted anywhere.

334
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,150
Then,

335
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,660
should I become a policeman?

336
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,720
There's nothing you're incapable of.

337
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,750
That's a finger that got you to rank 15th place.

338
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:09,200
Is that right?

339
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,010
You said your father was a policeman.

340
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:13,490
That's perfect. You can become a policeman,

341
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:16,160
start a public investigation with the prosecutor and Ji Soo,

342
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,060
catch the bad guys and take over the police squad.

343
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:25,460
My brother would pester me so much. He'd obviously know I got there by cheating.

344
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:28,270
Or how about you study for real?

345
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:32,380
Maybe I should, because studying is the easiest.

346
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:35,230
It really hurts because I got hit so much.

347
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,340
You're really not going to college?

348
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:44,100
My family owns eight gas stations. Why would I go to college?

349
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:48,770
Why do you think I don't act out even though my dad beats me?

350
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:53,430
I wish I was born with an oily spoon too.

351
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:57,410
He should've arrived by now.

352
00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:00,700
 The person you are trying to reach is unavailableâ€” 

353
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,990
He's not picking up his phone.

354
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:03,590
Is that right?

355
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:07,070
Yes, this is Detective Eun Ji Soo.

356
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,560
Yes.

357
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:11,230
What?

358
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:13,250
Yes, I understand.

359
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:17,440
Whatâ€™s the matter?

360
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,090
Earlier, Ahn's friend was almost a victim of a hydrochloric acid terror attack.

361
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:26,430
By 'almost,' you mean they couldn't succeed. They probably told you that the suspect got released.

362
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:27,900
Yeah.

363
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,990
But the victim

364
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:35,380
is a student, Yoon Jae In.

365
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:41,890
It's her, right? The child you were talking about?

366
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:44,040
The one you wanted Ahn to meet.

367
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,010
Where is she now?

368
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:50,640
Welcome.

369
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:53,370
Hello.

370
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:59,340
The teacher who tried to attack you earlier,

371
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,850
he's a first-time-offender and he was considered trustworthy.

372
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:04,720
He got released since it was just an attempt, as well.

373
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,590
So you'll either have to sue

374
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:10,660
or I think weâ€™re going to proceed with the investigation without detention.

375
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,490
I was expecting that.

376
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:14,780
So I think you should be careful for a while.

377
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:17,170
What did your parents say?

378
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:22,130
Theyâ€™re not here. They passed away.

379
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,630
Really? So what do we do?

380
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:28,180
Do you have another guardian?

381
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,720
I'll be her temporary guardian.

382
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,270
Does that make any sense? You're someone who can barely go home because you're so busy. No.

383
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:40,100
Donâ€™t worry. Iâ€™ll take care of myself.

384
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:44,710
I'm just thankful that you worry about me and that you came personally to explain the situation to meâ€”

385
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:47,880
What are you saying, you'll take care of yourself? You're only 19!

386
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,360
Hey, Detective Eun.

387
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,290
Sorry. Ah, seriously!

388
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:58,500
I hate stuff like this!

389
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,820
Last time, that guy who was violent on his date was released

390
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,320
and he eventually killed that woman, remember?

391
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,310
To my memory, he killed her entire family.

392
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:07,810
Surely it wouldn't go to that extremeâ€”

393
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:11,100
Haven't you heard that "surely" can really get someone?

394
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,940
What do I do?

395
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,830
Oh! We can do this.

396
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:24,580
- What? 
- Be her bodyguard for a little while.

397
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,750
- Why should I? 
 - Hey!

398
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:29,740
Same class, neighbor, and you know her teacher's face.

399
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,310
Do I need to explain any more?

400
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,150
You really don't have to do this.

401
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:38,230
You better do it! If you want to go to the autopsy room again.

402
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,360
What was that?

403
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,640
I heard everything.

404
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,050
Anyway, this situation got figured out like this.

405
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:47,720
You really don't have toâ€”

406
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:51,380
No. You can't ignore situations like these.

407
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,950
Imagine if your pretty face got one drop of hydrochloric acid on it.

408
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:57,320
Anyway, use him as much as you want. He doesn't even study anyway.

409
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,720
He's my brother. Shouldn't you get my permission first?

410
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,840
To be exact, he's just a roommate.

411
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,240
He's not related to either of us anyway.

412
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,590
Jae In! I'm a little late, aren't I?

413
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:10,870
Are you getting off now?

414
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:12,730
Yes.

415
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:16,070
That's great. I'll take you home.

416
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:34,910
I feel like I'm always a burden on you.

417
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:37,350
How many part-time jobs do you have?

418
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:42,600
Three. I reduced the number because I have exams coming up.

419
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:46,730
I heard from the reverend that you do really well in school.

420
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:52,280
That you want to work as a judge or a prosecutor when you grow up. Is it because of your dad?

421
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,680
- To prove that your dad is innocent? 
- What?

422
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:00,680
Should I pretend like I don't know this story?

423
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:06,040
If you want, I can smoothly transition to another conversation topic.

424
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:11,230
Yes. Could you please?

425
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:16,710
What should I talk about?

426
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:22,790
Is that detective your girlfriend?

427
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:30,150
I felt like you didn't know what to talk about so I just brought up a topic myself.

428
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:34,660
She's just a colleague and friend, one I knew since I was very young.

429
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,790
She seems like such a cool person.

430
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:41,390
She doesn't have a filter. Very honest and passionate.

431
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:49,410
Thank you.

432
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:52,790
Even though you know everything about me, you still sponsored me.

433
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:59,860
Do you think your dad is the criminal?

434
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:10,040
What are you doing out here?

435
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:16,060
You're him, right?! In the news!

436
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:19,110
The prosecutor for the arson case!

437
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,440
Our Jae In's Daddy Long Legs!

438
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,390
- Let's go in. 
 - Oh my!

439
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:28,020
Hello. I'm so late with greeting you.

440
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,600
- Thank you so much. 
- Yes.

441
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:35,560
You're better looking in real life than on TV!

442
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:37,480
How could you be so good looking?

443
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,440
We'll invite you over for food some time.

444
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,480
You should come in and have a cup of coffee!

445
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,570
No it's okay.

446
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:47,130
Do you want to eat ramen and go ( t/n: netflix and chill )?

447
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:48,980
See you next time, prosecutor!

448
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:51,560
Yes, good night.

449
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,580
 The Mask 

450
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,060
He's just my style!

451
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,920
Just go inside.

452
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,170
Hello?

453
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:49,350
What did you say?

454
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:54,390
 I'm calling from Kangwon Police Agency. You know Kim Gap Young, right? 

455
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,790
What happened?

456
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,830
It's just as I said over the phone.

457
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:17,330
We don't know if it was out of passion or just a robbery.

458
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:21,100
You were on his most recent call log so I called you first.

459
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:28,430
I think he got attacked on his way to see us.

460
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:31,120
Have you figured out where this call is from?

461
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,860
No matter how many times I called it, they didn't pick up. I have to examine it further.

462
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:38,330
This metal chain is a bit weird, isn't it?

463
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:44,620
It's not like they tied it to anything and it doesn't seem like they tried to tie his other ankle.

464
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:49,170
Why is he chained up at all?

465
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:53,180
As if, someone wanted us to see.

466
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:58,790
It's a challenge

467
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:02,180
from the culprit.

468
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,680
What are you doing? Are you not going?

469
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:26,860
What's this? Are you really going to be my bodyguard?

470
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:48,790
â™«  Do you feel now? Was it the finger tip touch?  â™«

471
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:55,920
â™«  I can feel it, where have you been hiding? Oh, my, my gosh!  â™«

472
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,990
â™«  I'm still...  â™«

473
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:59,920
â™«  Keep it in my heart  â™«

474
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:05,740
â™«  What is so dangerous? So, stay with me  â™«

475
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:11,650
â™«  Beautiful thing is inside your heart  â™«

476
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:16,130
â™«  Closer and come with me  â™«

477
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,860
Prosecutor!

478
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,960
Prosecutor Kang!

479
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:45,230
Why are you like this?

480
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:57,000
 Right abdonimal 10 cm, puncture wound, abdominal aortic aneurysm 

481
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,800
 Right abdonimal 10 cm, puncture wound, abdominal aortic aneurysm 

482
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,960
 Right abdonimal 10 cm, puncture wound, abdominal aortic aneurysm 

483
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,200
We have to re-investigate from the beginning.

484
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:08,690
The Hanmin Nursing Home case...

485
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:11,520
Song Yi Jang was not the criminal.

486
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,790
Someone else started the fire.

487
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:16,060
Who?

488
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:17,840
The one who killed Kim Ga Byung.

489
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,090
Who is that?

490
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:25,800
 Yeongseong Apartment Case 

491
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:31,520
Are you saying the crime from the Hanmin Care Home case is linked to the Yeongseong Apartment case?

492
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:39,340
You know something, don't you? Right?

493
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,390
Yoon Jae In.

494
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:52,410
 Yoon Jae-In 

495
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:56,640
This is Sun Hyung High School's uniform isn't it? It's in Woo Hyung City in Gyunggido.

496
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,720
What?

497
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:02,120
These days, you can do image searches.

498
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,170
There are no secrets.

499
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:07,000
Why did you transfer so much?

500
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,270
Your dad wasn't even nominated for the head of the borough.

501
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:15,220
We don't have long until exams. Leave me alone.

502
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:18,980
Oh my. Look at her glaring at us. There's definitely something!

503
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:19,960
Move.

504
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:23,160
Us finding out is just a matter of time.

505
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:35,260
 I heard her dad killed someone. 

506
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,960
 I heard it was a lot of people. 

507
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,800
 So cruel. 

508
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,870
 I wonder what it feels like to have a murderer of a father. 

509
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:41,060
 Lifetime imprisonment? 

510
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,170
 If I were her, I'd just die. 

511
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:43,760
 But why? Shouldn't she kill the same way? 

512
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,470
 I heard he stabbed them and killed them by fire. 

513
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:47,830
 So many people died. 

514
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:49,270
 So cruel! I have chills. 

515
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:50,620
 No way. 

516
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:54,990
 What do you mean? She's just like her dad. 

517
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:09,690
 I heard you want to be a detective. 

518
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:11,570
 Is it because of your dad? 

519
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:13,600
 To prove that he's innocent? 

520
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:16,890
 What if it's something your dad actually did? 

521
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:19,340
 Your dad killed people. So horrible. 

522
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:21,000
 You're so shameless. 

523
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,060
 You should die too. 

524
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:25,570
 Do you think your dad is the criminal? 

525
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,600
Are you okay?

526
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,220
It's hyperventiliation.

527
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:45,360
Because of my anxiety, the carbon dioxide level in my blood goes down.

528
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,300
Do you feel better when you breathe into a paper bag?

529
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:50,810
Yeah.

530
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:54,530
I breathe back in the carbon dioxide I breathe out.

531
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:57,980
I don't know exactly what it is but it doesn't sound too good.

532
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:00,820
Does this happen often?

533
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:02,370
Sometimes, when my stress level gets too high.

534
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:07,520
If it's to the point where you always have to carry around a paper bag, I don't think it's "sometimes."

535
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:13,270
I act all strong but I'm actually mentally a mess.

536
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:18,380
I have to hold out until the exams.

537
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:21,120
It's not even like you'll get better if you get into Seoul National University.

538
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:26,620
I need something to protect me.

539
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:34,750
I don't have parents or any kind of support. I've held out all these years by ranking number one in school.

540
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:38,160
But if people find out I'm a...

541
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:47,190
poor kid living on a rooftop, I become a recipe for disaster.

542
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,940
I can't even stand on my own anymore.

543
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:56,380
You might think this is stupid.

544
00:45:56,380 --> 00:46:00,090
It's not stupid. I'm like that too.

545
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:04,910
I lost my parents and have no support either. The only thing protecting me is

546
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:09,090
my one horrifying skill.

547
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:13,320
You have your hyung. A capable hyung.

548
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:15,490
That hyung,

549
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:21,300
once dropped me off at an orphanage and left me without notice.

550
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,630
 I'm sorry. 

551
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:32,060
 Why are you sorry? You're going to come back, right? 

552
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:34,510
 You're going to come see me. 

553
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:06,790
 If there's someone who messes with me, 

554
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:09,240
 I'm killing you all. 

555
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,190
 Please bring me home with you. 

556
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,950
 You were thrown away too. 

557
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:05,410
 Me too. 

558
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,390
 Are you alone? 

559
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:16,590
 Yeah. Me too. 

560
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:20,630
 Your name is White Snow? 

561
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:26,380
 You really look like snow. 

562
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:31,850
 Sorry. Because I touched you... 

563
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:44,000
  When I touch people, 

564
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:49,730
 they all leave me. 

565
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:56,610
 Do you want to 

566
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:02,370
 go home with me? 

567
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,270
 I came to get you. 

568
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:34,510
 I'm not too late, am I? 

569
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:48,570
 I missed you. 

570
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:56,730
I don't know what's in my brother's heart.

571
00:49:56,730 --> 00:50:00,290
He's the one person my psychometry doesn't work on.

572
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:09,000
He said there was something really important to do. I didn't even know that and just harbored a lot of hate towards him.

573
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:14,370
Did you think your hyung left you because of your strange skill?

574
00:50:14,370 --> 00:50:18,650
I hated a lot. My hyung and

575
00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:22,020
this skill.

576
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:27,750
But not anymore. After I reunited with my hyung, I decided to love my skill.

577
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:32,850
But why are you telling me this?

578
00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:35,480
Isn't this a secret too?

579
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:44,860
So you too can talk about your father.

580
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:47,200
I'll listen.

581
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:51,330
You can't run away forever.

582
00:50:51,330 --> 00:50:54,990
Part-time jobs, studying, and running away on top of that.

583
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,070
Aren't you tired?

584
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:03,320
I'm tired.

585
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,030
I'm so freaking tired.

586
00:51:10,090 --> 00:51:15,310
It might not even be that he was framed. He might actually be the criminal.

587
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:24,390
So... That's why I'm scared.

588
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:29,950
That's why I can't rashly ask you to read into me,

589
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:34,040
because I'm not confident enough.

590
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:41,090
But what if... Just because your dad did something wrong doesn't mean you did.

591
00:51:41,090 --> 00:51:42,690
The world doesn't think like that.

592
00:51:42,690 --> 00:51:48,190
Why do you care about what the world thinks? The only thing that matters is that the people you like don't think that way.

593
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:53,460
I'll help you.

594
00:51:56,430 --> 00:51:58,490
Not now.

595
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:02,430
When you're ready.

596
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:55,090
Damn it, I'm late!

597
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:14,400
What is this?

598
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,650
Hey! We're in trouble!

599
00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:22,060
You, again. If you talk about So Hyun again, I'm done with you.

600
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:24,030
It's Yoon Jae In.

601
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:35,050
 Murderer's Daughter, Yoon Jae In 

602
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:39,480
This... What is this saying right now?

603
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:49,100
 I'm going to reveal exactly who you are. 

604
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,020
 You got it?! 

605
00:53:59,830 --> 00:54:02,160
What are you looking at? Screw off!

606
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:24,530
 I'm tired. 

607
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:26,520
 Murderer's Daughter, Yoon Jae In 

608
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:29,060
 I'm so freaking tired. 

609
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:32,270
 It might not even be that he was framed. 

610
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:34,840
 He might actually be the criminal. 

611
00:54:38,390 --> 00:54:42,220
 I need one thing to protect me. 

612
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:49,370
 I don't have parents or any kind of support. I've held out all these years by being number one in school. 

613
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:54,960
 But if people find out that I'm just a poor kid living on a rooftop, 

614
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:58,170
  I become a recipe for disaster. 

615
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:01,030
 I can't even stand on my own anymore. 

616
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:37,550
 I'll help you. 

617
00:55:37,550 --> 00:55:42,410
 Not now, but when you're ready. 

618
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:09,520
 Daddy... 

619
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:20,350
 Is your dad a police? 

620
00:56:20,350 --> 00:56:23,950
 Then can you ask him to release my dad? 

621
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:28,090
 My dad is not a bad person, really. 

622
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:31,710
 Isnâ€™t it more like fate than a coincidence?  

623
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:34,330
â™«  ...down with you  â™«

624
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:36,580
That was her?

625
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:52,030
â™«  Sometimes when I feel you're in my house  â™«

626
00:56:53,420 --> 00:57:00,160
â™«  I can feel your sorrow through your face  â™«

627
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:05,180
 Just in case... 

628
00:57:07,850 --> 00:57:15,660
 if you can use psychometry to sense my presence here, I wanted to tell you. 

629
00:57:17,450 --> 00:57:19,740
 Your offer to help, 

630
00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:23,970
 strengthened me for a brief time. 

631
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:28,640
 Continue, 

632
00:57:29,490 --> 00:57:32,200
 to develop your ability. 

633
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:36,480
 Then when I become confident 

634
00:57:38,770 --> 00:57:41,570
I'll come and look for you.

635
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:54,270
â™«  Let me be there to guide you the way  â™«

636
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:59,160
â™«  It's okay to cry  â™«

637
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:04,330
â™«  Someday we all fall down  â™«

638
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:20,490
 Two Years Later 

639
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:39,940
â™«  I wish I can be someone for you  â™«

640
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:44,450
â™«  So you're not alone  â™«

641
00:58:44,450 --> 00:58:48,290
â™«  Yeah we'll be alright  â™«

642
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:56,130
â™«  Just remember that when you lie  â™«

643
00:58:56,130 --> 00:58:59,940
â™«  That you're not alone  â™«

644
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:03,920
â™«  'Cause I will be with you  â™«

645
00:59:05,450 --> 00:59:08,210
Jae In! Hey, Yoon Jae In!

646
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:15,360
I'm sorry.

647
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:21,430
â™«  Someday we all fall down  â™«

648
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:39,650
Uh... So,

649
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:42,450
look here. Seven thousand five hundred thirty won as minimum wage,

650
00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:45,500
you worked five hours a day except weekends.

651
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:50,170
So thirty days minus eight days is...

652
00:59:50,990 --> 00:59:52,650
- It's twenty-three days.
- Yeah, right.

653
00:59:52,650 --> 00:59:55,570
You're smart.

654
00:59:55,570 --> 00:59:58,610
Twenty-three days, so twenty-three days

655
00:59:58,610 --> 00:59:59,490
for seven thousand five hundred thirty won...

656
00:59:59,490 --> 01:00:00,770
Welcome!

657
01:00:00,770 --> 01:00:04,030
I'll go out. I'll go out. You calculate.

658
01:00:04,030 --> 01:00:06,390
Where can you find a boss like me?

659
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:11,660
This is same as my Emma.

660
01:00:13,090 --> 01:00:15,780
Sir, how much should I put in?

661
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:21,120
What are you?

662
01:00:25,110 --> 01:00:27,440
 47B 3327 

663
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,350
This is mine.

664
01:00:33,990 --> 01:00:35,580
This is my car.

665
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:39,730
You put this car for service at the car center. I took a peek.

666
01:00:39,730 --> 01:00:42,080
Wow, you see everything.

667
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:44,220
First, let's fill with gas then we can talk.

668
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:47,130
Where are you going? Why do you drive my car like it's yours?

669
01:00:47,130 --> 01:00:49,560
I have something really important today. Really.

670
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:51,000
What? What is it again?

671
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,830
You have to convince me to lend my lucky Emma to you.

672
01:00:53,830 --> 01:00:56,260
I won't let go this time.

673
01:00:58,910 --> 01:01:00,330
 Application for police academy entrance exam 2018 

674
01:01:00,330 --> 01:01:03,390
Prosecutor Kang. Did you know?

675
01:01:03,390 --> 01:01:05,960
That Ahn is taking police examination?

676
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:10,750
Recently he started to study unlike before.

677
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:14,530
What if he passes by chance?

678
01:01:14,530 --> 01:01:21,940
If he can pass the exam through cheating, that means his ability improved to some extent, right?

679
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:25,920
Let's see what happens. It won't be too late to worry about this after the result.

680
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:26,630
Okay.

681
01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:31,090
But is this why you came on your day off?

682
01:01:31,090 --> 01:01:34,200
Yes, of course.

683
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:37,010
Then please excuse me. I have something to take care of.

684
01:01:39,050 --> 01:01:41,380
Prosecutor Kang!

685
01:01:42,150 --> 01:01:43,820
Yes?

686
01:01:44,810 --> 01:01:49,400
I am going on a blind date today.

687
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:53,990
Should I not go?

688
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:55,790
Why not?

689
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:12,750
Dang it. I'm so embarrassed!

690
01:02:15,050 --> 01:02:18,430
I shouldn't see Ahn for a while.

691
01:02:18,430 --> 01:02:21,410
I have to keep this as a secret.

692
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:28,590
  Entrance to the examination  

693
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:40,450


694
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,760
 Please do well. 

695
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:55,570
 My test result is up to you today. 

696
01:03:07,390 --> 01:03:10,950
   Written examination   

697
01:03:52,850 --> 01:03:55,800
Man, I feel guilty.

698
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:03,310
Stop over there.

699
01:04:03,310 --> 01:04:05,830
Ah, my hand aches.

700
01:04:05,830 --> 01:04:10,240
Anything other than taking a test on your own is considered misconduct.

701
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:12,650
You'll be excused right away if caught.

702
01:04:12,650 --> 01:04:19,820


703
01:04:19,820 --> 01:04:26,890
â™«  See your eyes, I can feel it when I see the look in your eyes  â™«

704
01:04:26,890 --> 01:04:29,580
â™«  I know you lie  â™«

705
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:35,160
â™«  The coincidence that repeats  â™«

706
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:36,450
I found you.

707
01:04:36,450 --> 01:04:37,370
â™«  over and over again  â™«

708
01:04:37,370 --> 01:04:38,830
Yoon Jae In.

709
01:04:38,830 --> 01:04:44,590
â™«  So take, my hidden feelings  â™«

710
01:04:44,590 --> 01:04:49,350
â™«  Take the time I saved for you  â™«

711
01:04:49,350 --> 01:04:53,210
â™«  Don't be afraid  â™«

712
01:04:53,210 --> 01:04:57,990
â™«  My heart wants you  â™«

713
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:04,630
 He is Psychometric 

714
01:05:04,630 --> 01:05:09,480
â™«  I know you more than anyone  â™«

715
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:14,860
â™«  I'll tell you my secret feelings  â™«

716
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:17,220
â™«  I need you  â™«

717
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:21,640
â™«  More than anything else  â™«

718
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:26,540
â™«  Change, the heart that you wanted to hide  â™«

719
01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:31,390
â™«  Change all those times when you were hurting  â™«

720
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,200
 I didn't think you'd be a police officer. 

721
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:36,550
 You were going to cheat this morning, right? 

722
01:05:36,550 --> 01:05:39,010
 Are you helping a prosecutor and the detective with your ability? 

723
01:05:39,010 --> 01:05:41,210
 Should I say I'm a psychometrist? 

724
01:05:41,210 --> 01:05:47,150
 Are you sure that you haven't done anything wrong? 

725
01:05:47,150 --> 01:05:49,460
 I think that the kid is kidnapped. 

726
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:52,850
 I'm sure that there's a suitcase with a dead body! 

727
01:05:52,850 --> 01:05:56,490
 Kang Seong Mo, why do you have so many secrets? 

728
01:05:56,490 --> 01:05:59,290
 Someone followed you from our house. 

729
01:05:59,290 --> 01:06:01,830
 He ran away when I approached him.
