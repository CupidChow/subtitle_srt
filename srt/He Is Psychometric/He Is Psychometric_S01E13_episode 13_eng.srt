2
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:46,420
 October 25th, 2005 

3
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,630
They didn't say they were moving in today.

4
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,600
It'll be okay if we stay here.

5
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:35,310
Seong Mo, that person will find me again.

6
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:40,790
He might not even stop until I'm dead.

7
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:44,090
If that bastard appears in front of you again, I'll kill him.

8
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:48,160
So don't worry about it anymore.

9
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,260
If you do that, I'll be even sadder.

10
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,480
I'll be hurt.

11
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:01,120
I taught you what sadness and hurt mean, didn't I?

12
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,450
I know.

13
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,780
The painful feeling when someone dies,

14
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,920
the feeling of losing what is precious to you.

15
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:17,280
Yes. That feeling.

16
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,120
So it means that if you kill someone,

17
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,690
your mother dies too.

18
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:32,000
 Psychometry: An ability to measure and interpret the essence or history of a person or thing through touch.

  Basement  

21
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:53,000
 Seong Mo, your mother will make sure you make it out of here. 

22
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,230
  Kang Geun Taek  

23
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,650
 If someone as small as you is trying to kill someone, 

24
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:03,590
 you should stab here. 

25
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,300
 Metal chains  

26
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,180
  Yoon Jae In 

27
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,070
  Eun Ji Soo

  Yeongseong Apartment 
Security guard sets fire himself. 

29
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,250
  A ghost station that exists but does not exist.  

30
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,680
  Hanmin Care Home and Yeongseong Apartment Fire Copycat  

31
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:25,180
 A person who fights with a monster  

32
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:29,430
 should be careful that they don't turn into a monster during the fight. 

33
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,760
  If I 

34
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,080
  look into the abyss for a long time,  

35
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,620
  the abyss will also go inside of me 

36
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,290
 and I see you.  

37
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,330
  Detective Eun, we're heading to the Saeki-dong ghost station now.  

38
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:11,980
 When you receive our message, please come here quickly. 

39
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:18,960
The picture that Kang Geun Taek took from your house, is this the one?

40
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,240
Yeah.

41
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,840
Seems to be.

42
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,110
What's this?

43
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,530
Why did Hyung—

44
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,050
 Authorized Personnel Only 

45
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,420
It's not Kang Geun Taek.

46
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,750
Kang Eun Joo? Why is Kang Eun Joo here?

47
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,600
Yoon Jae In.

48
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:22,850
Kang Geun Taek wasn't the one that hid that bag.

49
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:26,930
The photos in the bag and the metal chains in the bag, Seong Mo brought them.

50
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:31,840
Something's off. Why make it look like Kang Geun Taek was here?

51
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:36,460
And why is Kang Eun Joo and not Kang Geun Taek here?

52
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:42,120
Let's take Kang Eun Joo to the hospital first.

53
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,590
Kangkook Station.

54
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:05,480
Yoon Jae In! Is there a ghost station at Kangkook, too?

55
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:10,630
  A new transit line from Saeki-dong Station to Kangkook Station in 1988.  

56
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:16,100
Yeah, I heard that the plan for underground line for Saeki-dong and Kangkook Station failed.

57
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,590
But why?

58
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,750
It's not Saeki-dong Station.

59
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,750
Hyung is

60
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,460
at Kangkook station.

61
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,270
Come out.

62
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:39,920
I'm done playing hide-and-seek.

63
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,390
  You discovered where I am.  

64
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:48,310
  You are amazing, Kang Seong Mo.  

65
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:51,520
 Does you finding this place  

66
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:56,220
 mean that you know how I survived so far? 

67
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,680
No matter how terrible your life has been in the past,

68
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,730
murder is not justified.

69
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,390
Did you find Kang Eun Joo?

70
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:10,130
Don't say that name a single time.

71
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:13,340
There's no chance of you ever meeting her again.

72
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,820
Come out now.

73
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,330
Kang Geun Taek.

74
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,270
Noona, it's not Saeki-dong Station, Hyung's mother was there.

75
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,760
You mean you found Kang Eun Joo?

76
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,360
You quickly need to go to Kangkook Station. Hyung is there.

77
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,270
I'm near it right now.

78
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,290
Noona, we have to stop him.

79
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,630
Lieutenant Nam, I'm calling to ask you for an urgent favor.

80
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,610
Yes, Detective Kim it's me, it's been a while. Kangkook Station is your jurisdiction, right?

81
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,620
Gather everyone now and come to the third basement level of Kangkook Station.

82
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,230
I'll explain later. Go there as fast as possible.

83
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,820
Let's talk.

84
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,440
I have nothing to say to you.

85
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,310
Are you the one that told Ji Soo about the Yeongseong Apartment?

86
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:19,770
What did I tell you? To never appear in front of me again.

87
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:37,040
Shut down the Seoheun Community Security Center right now and order the staff to be on standby.

88
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,470
Do you think you can catch me with this stuff again?

89
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:51,280
I was just trying to make sure that you know how much information you have about me today.

90
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:58,140
Come to think of it, facing you one-on-one now would be a reckless thing to do.

91
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,060
Right.

92
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:05,970
So you were after the people that were related to me.

93
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:12,650
 Related... You've created relationships with many people. 

94
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:18,060
 Sympathy, affection, loyalty, pain...  

95
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:21,850
 How is it sharing those things together? 

96
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:26,240
 Did you have the illusion that you are a human? 

97
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:32,280
No, I'm still a monster.

98
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,520
Since I've always thought about killing you,

99
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,910
how I could give you the most suffering,

100
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:45,420
and the cruelest payback, that's all I thought about.

101
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:51,080
 Right. That's why Eun Joo left you too. 

102
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:56,440
 Eun Joo also knew that you were also monster that couldn't be helped. 

103
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:05,150
- As expected, you got my blood. 
 - Shut up.

104
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:11,090
Even if you get out of here safely,

105
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,860
there will be nowhere for you to hide anymore.

106
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:20,070
The investigation about you is all finished.

107
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:28,160
Is that so, Kang Seong Mo?

108
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,490
  Kangkook Station  

109
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,860
She just fainted for a while. We've done first-aid, so she will wake up soon.

110
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:54,390
So this woman is Kang Hee Sook—

111
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:57,790
No, Kim Song Hee?

112
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,610
Her real name is Kang Eun Joo.

113
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:03,500
She is Prosecutor Kang's mother, who died in the Yeongseong Apartment fire.

114
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:08,590
What in the world, I don't understand this.  Then where is Detective Eun now?

115
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,510
Kang Seong Mo. Let go of that knife.

116
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:41,330
Don't come this way, Eun Ji Soo.

117
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:44,190
The first shot was a blank one but the second one is real.

118
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,490
Please drop the knife!

119
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,850
  Eun Ji Soo. Get out of here now, hurry!  

120
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:11,160
I know why you want to kill this guy. I also know the reason why you don't trust the police.

121
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,730
But Kang Seong Mo, you should give me a chance, too.

122
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:18,510
Ji Soo, please don't come this way.

123
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,250
Please... Don't come.

124
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,130
No!

125
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,670
Ji Soo! Eun Ji Soo!

126
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:08,250
Look at that. Kang Seong Mo isn't a monster.

127
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,060
No.

128
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:17,480
If you were a monster, you would go after him. You would leave me alone.

129
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,780
Please, please Ji Soo.

130
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:25,600
We found your mom. So let's go back.

131
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:32,660
Killing this guy won't heal your wounds.

132
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,890
It will rather become an even bigger wound.

133
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:44,820
So please go back with me.

134
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,700
Ji Soo, please stay conscious.

135
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,320
Ji Soo... Come to your senses.

136
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,580
Ji Soo. You can't, no.

137
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,530
No!

138
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,620
  An injured person at Kangkook Station on the third basement level  

139
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,100
  119 Backup needed! 119 Backup needed! 

140
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:45,570
  Suspect escaping from the scene. Requesting support for a patrol car nearby.  

141
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:49,180
  Repeating, the suspect is now on the run after stabbing a police officer.  

142
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:52,480
 Requesting support for a patrol car nearby Kangkook Station.  

143
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,230
Is the victim Detective Eun Ji Soo?

144
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:58,850
Requesting the victim's identity. Requesting the victim's identity!

145
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:03,050
  The injured person at the third basement level of Kangkook Station is Detective Eun Ji Soo from the Seoul Metropolitan Police. 

146
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:06,980
  The suspect on the run has a black jacket and wears a hat and has a gunshot wound.  

147
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,130
  Requesting support for a patrol car nearby.  

148
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:12,460
Make sure to check with the hospital she is taken to and contact me quickly.

149
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:31,870
  Where are you right now? 

150
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,310
I'm in front of Kangkook Station now.

151
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:36,510
Kang Geun Taek ran away from the site.

152
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,680
What?

153
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:42,890
 And Detective Eun... I heard she was stabbed with a knife. 

154
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:47,950
  The police are on their way there now so don't do anything dangerous.  

155
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,480
 Are you listening to me? 

156
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:19,920
Two of you cover the entrance and the rest follow me.

157
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:42,940
  Kang Geun Taek avoids surveillance cameras and travels through ghost stations,  

158
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:45,570
  so he lived his whole life unnoticed.  

159
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:52,020
  I think he learned how to do so during his time in a panhandling ring.  

160
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:04,280
 A place where he can escape to. A place where there is no surveillance camera and won't be seen as much as possible.  

161
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:42,300
  No!  

162
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,490
  How was it 

163
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:10,920
  to live like an invisible person in this world? 

164
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,230
 I think you can understand  

165
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,560
  me better now. 

166
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:36,490
 From now on, every thirty minutes 

167
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:40,120
 I will kill a woman in the hospital room. 

168
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:43,290
As expected, it was you.

169
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:46,490
You killed those people in Hanmin Care Home.

170
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:52,060
  Hee Jung...Jung Hee Jung. 

171
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:58,140
  You said you wouldn't kill them if I came. 

172
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:01,280
 Don’t try to escape from me anymore. 

173
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,110
 Come with me. 

174
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,830
 I could kill you here. 

175
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:41,990
  But if I do, I'll end up losing my VIP customer.  

176
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,130
  You need enemies to have allies. 

177
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:33,160
 Please don’t kill anyone else because of me. 

178
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,490
 Eleven years ago, the fire in that apartment building, 

179
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:40,060
 you think I did it? 

180
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,260
 When you come here, 

181
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:46,340
 I’ll tell you the truth about that day. 

182
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:51,540
The truth of that day?

183
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:55,860
What is the truth about the apartment fire? What the hell is it?

184
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,820
Why is Seong Mo there?

185
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:18,220
Why is Seong Mo at Hanmin Care Home?

186
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,860
How do you know that?

187
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:23,340
Did he take Kang Eun Joo?

188
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,780
Why is he in your memory?

189
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,820
Answer me, Kang Geun Taek. Kang Geun Taek!

190
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:36,390
I’m arresting you on suspicion of kidnapping, confinement, and attempted murder.

191
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:40,590
You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be used against you in court. You have the right to consult an attorney.

192
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:42,730
Answer me Kang Geun Taek!

193
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,830
Arrest him.

194
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:54,700
Don't be mistaken and think Kang Seong Mo is your life savior because he saved you.

195
00:25:54,700 --> 00:26:00,550
Kang Seong Mo, he just tamed you.

196
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,000
What does that mean?

197
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,630
Kang Geun Taek. I said answer me!

198
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:12,860
Kang Geun Taek!

199
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:16,320
Kang Geun Taek! I’m asking you what that means!

200
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,780
Kang Geun Taek answer me!

201
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:22,550
Kang Geun Taek!

202
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:24,490
Kang Geun Taek! Kang Geun Taek!

203
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:27,420
Hey, stop!

204
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,420
Go to Detective Eun quickly.

205
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:33,330
Prosecutor Kang went to the hospital with her, but it doesn't look good.

206
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:58,890
 Operating Room 

207
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,800
  Killing him 

208
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,560
  won't heal your wounds.  

209
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,380
It will rather become an even bigger wound.

210
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,120
So...

211
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,740
Please, come back with me.

212
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:30,080
Kang Seong Mo.

213
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,780
To go back,

214
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,710
it’s too late.

215
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:24,980
What about Ji Soo Noona?

216
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,980
She’s still in surgery.

217
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,570
By any chance, have you seen Seong Mo Hyung?

218
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:34,410
Prosecutor Kang? Prosecutor Kang came here?

219
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:55,570
  Doctor Kim Sung Won of the Department of Neurosurgery, you are requested at the ER. 

220
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,910
How are you feeling?

221
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:12,580
You still need to rest, Kang Eun Joo.

222
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,580
Do you know me?

223
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:32,700
Detective Kim, I think we need to treat the gunshot wound.

224
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:39,880
We’ll move to the police station after the suspect’s gunshot wound is healed.

225
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:44,040
 Code Zero. Code Zero. A car charged into Bukseong Park. 

226
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,730
  Many are injured. Officers in the vicinity, please assist.  

227
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:50,410
It’s code zero again? What’s going on today?

228
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:52,340
  Patrol Car 11 on its way. 

229
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:55,700
 Patrol Car 22 on its way. 

230
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:05,570
Why can't we have some peace and quiet?

231
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,750
So Kang Eun Joo is a woman declared dead from the Yeongseong apartment fire,

232
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:17,850
but she’s alive.

233
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:21,060
Kang Geun Taek, who stabbed Detective Eun,

234
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,820
is the real culprit of the fire?

235
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:25,540
Yes, we’ll find out when we investigate in detail but

236
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:28,520
I believe he was also behind the Hanmin Care Home fire.

237
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,430
The Hanmin Care Home fire?

238
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:33,620
The suspect of that case committed suicide.

239
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:36,260
I don’t know what the hell is going on.

240
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:39,490
I’m concerned that Kang Eun Joo will try to commit suicide.

241
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:43,780
I think you should keep your eyes on Eun Joo during the investigation.

242
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,980
Please do this favor.

243
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,810
Okay, I got it.

244
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:52,130
  Attempted murder suspect escaped custody. Officers in the area, please assist. 

245
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:55,250
  Attempted murder suspect escaped custody and fled the scene. 

246
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:58,000
  Officers in the area, please assist!  

247
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,320
Didn't most of them respond to Bukseong Park?

248
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,120
It’s driving me crazy!

249
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,150
Let’s go.

250
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:15,270
 Operating Room 

251
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:22,160
Quickly, quickly.

252
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:06,830
At 20:35...

253
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:10,890
Eun Ji Soo passed away.

254
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:20,860
Oh god.

255
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,240
 It's lame of you to obsess over living so much. 

256
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:37,100
 Okay then, I'll go first. Live a long, long life. 

257
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,710
 And make sure to come to my funeral. 

258
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:42,720
 In my next life 

259
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,470
 I'm going to date you, Dr. Hong! 

260
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:39,540
  Kooyang Hospital  

261
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,430
  Jangseok Redevelopment Area  

262
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,600
  Uinam Villa  

263
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,530
  Uinam Traditional Market  

264
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,740
  Joongyi-dong Apartment  

265
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:56,100
  Basement, Metal chains, Yeongseong Apartment, Ghost Station, Hanmin Care Home 

266
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:09,370
  Yesterday at 3 PM, at the third basement level of Kangkook Station, 

267
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:14,100
  a man in his fifties was caught fleeing the scene after stabbing police officer Eun. 

268
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:17,400
 However, he escaped police custody while being transported, 

269
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,750
  and the public is criticizing the police for their clumsy work.  

270
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:25,840
  The detective was rushed to the hospital but died from severe loss of blood.  

271
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,770
 The police are chasing the suspect 

272
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:31,670
 based on security footage from the area. 

273
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:36,010
  The detective who was attacked was a lieutenant of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency  

274
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:39,820
 and the incident occurred while trying to apprehend a suspect. 

275
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:42,890
  She was known to have been armed at the time. 

276
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:47,300
  She had fired one blank and one live bullet. 

277
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:51,940
  According to witness statements, the criminal was wounded with a bullet in his arm, 

278
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,600
  and once again evaded the police... 

279
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,540
Turn this off, I can't stand listening to it.

280
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:58,590
You don't deserve to complain.

281
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:00,830
How dare you whine when you lost the guy?

282
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:04,840
Would this have happened if you had told me he was a dangerous guy?

283
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:08,300
Why did you suddenly drag me into this?

284
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:11,950
I need to know something if I'm to investigate or make an excuse.

285
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:15,760
Why did Eun Ji Soo have to die?

286
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:20,090
Forget it. Who am I to blame others?

287
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:23,350
I'm the one who wanted to back out.

288
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:28,360
These were the cases Detective Eun was on.

289
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:31,320
The Yeongseong Apartment fire, Hanmin Care Home fire,

290
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,360
and Kim Gab Yong's murder.

291
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,190
The guy who got away did all this?

292
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:38,250
There's one more.

293
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:42,580
Gangryeong Confinement Case.

294
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:46,270
This is where it all began.

295
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,630
  Just because Seong Mo saved you, 

296
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:55,710
  don't go thinking that he's your life savior.  

297
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,860
  All he did was 

298
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:01,230
  tame you.  

299
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:33,750
  Saeki-dong ghost station 

300
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:36,110
  Just so the child beggars couldn't get away, 

301
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:39,370
  they locked them up with metal chains around their necks. 

302
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:43,570
  Eliminate Panhandling in 100 Days 

303
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:46,470
That case file.

304
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:49,930
He left it here on purpose?

305
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,090
The person who gave Kang Eun Joo that ring,

306
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:32,530
was Seong Mo Hyung.

307
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:43,410
Yoon Jae In. Seong Mo lured us to Saeki-dong Station.

308
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:45,680
He left the files so we'd find that place.

309
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:49,870
Even though he knew that Kang Geun Taek was at Kangkook Station,

310
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:53,180
he sent us to Saeki-dong Station to save us.

311
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:55,190
Ahn. Calm down.

312
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:57,870
And without even realizing that, I sent Noona

313
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:01,290
to where Hyung was,

314
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:05,470
to where that bastard was, to stop Hyung.

315
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,510
I was the one who killed her.

316
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:11,360
Ahn, please don't think like that. What happened,

317
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,780
was nothing but an accident.

318
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:21,110
Hyung even knew that Kang Eun Joo was alive.

319
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:24,040
He was at Hanmin Care Home!

320
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:28,820
Where are you right now? I'll be right there.

321
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,950
 Seoheun Community Center 

322
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:33,520
  Closed 

323
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:40,310
It's no longer a security center. It's closed—

324
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:54,510
I'm not sure if this will offer any comfort, but Ji Soo was like you in your prime.

325
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:58,130
She stuck to the job no matter what and was caring.

326
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:05,030
I have a lot to do, like prepare for her funeral, so I'll be brief.

327
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:09,160
This case, I want you to take it over.

328
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:14,810
- What? 
 - You know what Ji Soo has been looking into,

329
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:18,290
and the problems in the Yeongseong Apartment case's investigation as well,

330
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:20,650
you know better than anyone.

331
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:24,340
I'm asking because you'll make quicker headway than

332
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:27,640
someone who has never studied the case before.

333
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,820
The Gangryeong confinement case, Hanmin Care Home, Yeongseong Apartment.

334
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:35,270
Everyone's focus will be on the shoddy investigation.

335
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:38,330
Are you prepared for that?

336
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:41,740
The Yeongseong Apartment and Hanmin Care Home cases,

337
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:45,020
Ji Soo asked me so many times to reopen the investigations.

338
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:48,820
I always said no.

339
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:52,120
Even when she found out my secret,

340
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:56,060
she said we could start over before it was too late.

341
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:59,630
I'm the one who made things worse.

342
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,580
I...

343
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,930
killed Ji Soo.

344
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:21,040
You did only this much? In one whole day?

345
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:25,030
Detective Park.

346
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:28,940
You're supposed to look in the opposite direction.

347
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,680
How is the tracking of Kang Geun Taek going?

348
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,110
From the crime scene he fled from,

349
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:39,350
we followed him to Uinam Junction.

350
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:40,760
We don't know where he went from there.

351
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:45,090
It'll be impossible to track him with surveillance cameras. He evaded them when he kidnapped Constable Yoon, too.

352
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:47,300
Didn't Kang Seong Mo take Detective Eun to the hospital?

353
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:52,510
Yes. However, I called to try and get his statement, but he won't pick up.

354
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:54,520
Where's Kang Eun Joo?

355
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,390
She's just as frustrating.

356
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:02,650
She's kept her lips sealed since yesterday.

357
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:05,360
She lived as a dead person for thirteen years.

358
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:08,280
She won't speak so easily.

359
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:11,470
Wait and watch. I have an idea.

360
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,750
The person that gifted Hyung the cube was Kang Eun Joo.

361
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:17,920
And the ring that Kang Eun Joo had been wearing was also a gift from Hyung.

362
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:23,380
So that means that Prosecutor Kang knew from the start that Kang Eun Joo was alive.

363
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:29,930
Exactly. And the person who took Kang Eun Joo from the Hanmin Care Home was also Hyung.

364
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:35,650
- So that's why Kang Eun Joo knew about happened at Saeki-dong Station. 
 - What?

365
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:38,160
All you saw of Kang Geun Taek in the basement

366
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,250
was the phrase "a place that doesn't exist."

367
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:43,860
But Kang Eun Joo came to Saeki-dong Station, with a knife.

368
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:49,340
Kang Eun Joo heard Kang Geun Taek had something to do with Saeki-dong Station

369
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:51,360
from Seong Mo?

370
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:54,400
The Hanmin Care Home fire happened in 2016.

371
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:59,720
Prosecutor Kang solved the Saeki-dong beggar case in 2015. If the two of them

372
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:04,580
had stayed in touch, it's possible.

373
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:12,750
The more I know, the more I don't know.

374
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:17,640
If Hyung kept in touch with Kang Eun Joo, why did they make a composite sketch of Kang Eun Joo?

375
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:22,030
Why did he plan for us find her? It doesn't make sense.

376
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:24,580
  What's the truth about the apartment fire?  

377
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:27,840
What the hell is that? Why is  Seong Mo at Hanmin Care Home?

378
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:32,540
  Don't be mistaken and think Kang Seong Mo is your life savior because he saved you. 

379
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:35,390
 Kang Seong Mo, all he did 

380
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:38,580
 was tame you.  

381
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:44,440
Jae In. I think I'll have to meet Kang Eun Joo.

382
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:47,300
The only person who can tell me the truth

383
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:50,600
is her.

384
00:44:57,210 --> 00:44:58,060
Yes, Lieutenant Nam.

385
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:01,750
Let me ask you one question. How did you know that Kang Eun Joo would be at Saeki-dong Station?

386
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:05,450
And how did you know Kang Geun Taek would be at Kangkook Station?

387
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:07,310
That...

388
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:10,910
  Kang Geun Taek and Kang Seong Mo are gone without a trace 

389
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:13,590
 and Kang Eun Joo doesn't speak so we can't proceed with the investigation.  

390
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:16,920
Do you maybe know anything more about this case?

391
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,810
You said you wanted to solve your father's case with your own hands.

392
00:45:19,810 --> 00:45:21,740
Come over and join us. Right now.

393
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:26,570
There is one more person that will join, Lieutenant Nam.

394
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:45,050
Even if people find out about your ability, will you be fine?

395
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:47,980
That doesn't matter.

396
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:56,730
Constable Yoon. I didn't hear anything wrong now, did I?

397
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:01,230
Lee Ahn. What, you read people's memories?

398
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:06,790
It's hard to believe but I saw Kim Gab Yong kill Kang Hee Sook and Park Soo Young.

399
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:09,890
I also found out that this guy was at Kangkook Station.

400
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,150
It was possible because of this ability.

401
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:16,770
This crazy guy. Don't talk nonsense.

402
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:19,300
There is no time now. I have to go meet Kang Eun Joo.

403
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:22,010
I also don't have time to fool around with you, punk.

404
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:23,880
Constable Yoon, let's go.

405
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,730
You told Noona about Director Eun's corruption, right?

406
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:31,710
That's why you feel responsible for this case now.

407
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:37,200
- What? 
 - I saw it when you pulled Kang Geun Taek off me.

408
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,940
I also feel the same way as you.

409
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:45,090
When Noona heard what I said, she went to Kangkook Station and died.

410
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:46,970
You can think of me as a crazy bastard

411
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:50,040
or a monster.

412
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,940
But please just once,

413
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,840
let me meet Kang Eun Joo.

414
00:46:57,430 --> 00:46:59,400
You monstrous punk.

415
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:05,110
How can you read people's memories? Do you believe him too?

416
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:08,840
Detective Eun and Prosecutor Kang knew about it too.

417
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:13,380
So... That's why we investigated this case together.

418
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:18,700
You guys are making a fool out of me.

419
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,890
How can you read memories by touching my hand once?

420
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,850
Constable Yoon, go in first.

421
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:40,250
Lieutenant Nam.

422
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:42,970
No matter what you see through psychometry or whatever from Kang Eun Joo,

423
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:46,210
I'm not sure I can surely count on it.

424
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:48,210
Let me think, too.

425
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:52,040
First, the priority is to persuade Kang Eun Joo to speak.

426
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,510
I'll go meet her first.

427
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:02,980
  Kim Gab Yong Investigation Data 
 Kang Eun Joo Investigation Data  

428
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:11,650
Do you remember me?

429
00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:28,150
I went to that basement.

430
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:33,310
Where you and Prosecutor Kang were locked up.

431
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:37,110
I know it must have been hell.

432
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:40,850
And the police didn't help at all.

433
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:43,580
As long as you could get out of there,

434
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:47,180
you thought that everything was going to be over.

435
00:48:47,870 --> 00:48:50,950
But this memory,

436
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:53,270
like a metal chain to Kang Eun Joo and Prosecutor Kang,

437
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:56,170
it's holding onto your ankles.

438
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:04,810
I will apologize instead.

439
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:10,770
And I promise that this time we will definitely catch him.

440
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:19,550
Is Seong Mo trying to kill this man?

441
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:23,930
Yes. You

442
00:49:23,930 --> 00:49:28,030
went to Saeki-dong Station to kill Kang Geun Taek, right?

443
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:37,570
This man continuously followed us around after we escaped from the basement.

444
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:43,140
Just before we moved to Yeongseong Apartment, Seong Mo

445
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:47,470
was locked up by him again and escaped.

446
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:51,180
And the police only said the same thing every time, didn't they?

447
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:55,560
That they couldn't find a trace of this man.

448
00:49:57,810 --> 00:49:59,500
Yes.

449
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:04,950
Through the Yeongseong Apartment fire,

450
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:07,850
you must have seen the news about your own death.

451
00:50:07,850 --> 00:50:10,870
Why didn't you show up?

452
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:15,650
It was even scarier to say that I am alive.

453
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:20,310
Now matter how much we ran away, this man always found us.

454
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:22,400
  I found you.  

455
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:28,280
If the reason why the police can't find this person

456
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:31,950
is because he doesn't have a name nor a resident registration,

457
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:38,280
I thought that if I lived like that, he wouldn't find me.

458
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:40,560
After the Yeongseong Apartment incident,

459
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:44,460
have you ever met Prosecutor Kang Seong Mo?

460
00:50:50,510 --> 00:50:52,990
No.

461
00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:55,760
Seong Mo also didn't know that I was alive.

462
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:01,570
I didn't want Seong Mo to be in danger because of me.

463
00:51:01,570 --> 00:51:04,070
So I didn't contact him.

464
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:06,030
That's a lie.

465
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:10,780
Kang Eun Joo was clearly meeting Hyung.

466
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:19,140
Then after eleven years, you met Kang Geun Taek at the Hanmin Care Home again.

467
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:23,350
That day in the middle of the night,

468
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:27,050
I got a call from Seong Eui Jeong.

469
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:41,110
 Hello? 

470
00:51:44,290 --> 00:51:47,480
  Seong Eui Jong. What is the matter at this time?  

471
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,510
  What is going on?  

472
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:51,770
  It's been a while.  

473
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:54,770
  Kang Eun Joo.  

474
00:51:56,980 --> 00:52:01,890
  I don't think you would have forgotten my voice.  

475
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:06,660
  All this time, you've been living as a person who's not in the world.  

476
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:09,120
  How did it feel?  

477
00:52:09,970 --> 00:52:12,990
  Now you'll understand me more.  

478
00:52:12,990 --> 00:52:15,490
  That's what I think.  

479
00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:23,310
 I guess you don't even want to let me hear your voice. 

480
00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:30,540
  But what can I do?  

481
00:52:31,930 --> 00:52:34,480
  I'm  

482
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,940
  going crazy to see your face. 

483
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:42,190
  From now on,  

484
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:46,680
  one every thirty minutes,  

485
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:50,500
  I'm going to kill the women in the hospital room.  

486
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:54,140
  Even when the police arrive I'm going to kill them.  

487
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:57,500
  When someone else than you comes,  

488
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:00,080
  I'll kill them, too.  

489
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:05,590
  Please, please don't do this.  

490
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:09,720
  Please don't kill anyone else because of me.  

491
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:16,960
If I didn't go, with the same method for the Yeongseong Apartment,

492
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,770
he threatened to kill people.

493
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:27,180
And I was afraid that people would die again for no reason, because of me.

494
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:30,920
So I went there.

495
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:33,120
Is that a lie too?

496
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,880
That is the truth.

497
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:40,670
But we're missing something more important than that,

498
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:42,710
from Kang Eun Joo.

499
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:48,540
  Please don't kill anyone else because of me.  

500
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:52,690
  Anyone else? Did you say "anyone else"? 

501
00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:55,780
 You really don't know anything. 

502
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:00,790
 The one who set the apartment on fire eleven years ago, 

503
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:04,770
 do you think I was the one who did it? 

504
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:09,200
  When you come here,  

505
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,390
  I'm going to tell you the truth of that day. 

506
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:15,970
That he would tell her the truth about the Yeongseong Apartment Fire,

507
00:54:18,890 --> 00:54:22,350
it was in Kang Geun Taek's memory.

508
00:54:23,410 --> 00:54:25,970
Why are you hiding that?

509
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:34,370
You know Kim Gab Yong, right?

510
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:36,110
Yes.

511
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:42,540
This person gave me an ID.

512
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:46,650
Park Soo Young, Kang Hee Sook,

513
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:49,810
and Kim Song Hee.

514
00:54:49,810 --> 00:54:55,100
The fact that Kim Gab Yong killed Park Soo Young and Kang Hee Sook...

515
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:57,330
Do you know that?

516
00:54:57,330 --> 00:55:01,980
Did you perhaps pay him to murder?

517
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:06,340
Did you want to change your identity without any further trouble?

518
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,320
No.

519
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:11,710
I never imagined that

520
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:14,020
he would kill to change my identity.

521
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:17,560
You went to Hanmin Care Home with Kim Gab Yong, right?

522
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:28,100
 Going alone seems dangerous. 

523
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:30,510
 You should go in with me. 

524
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:36,770
 That person could never kill me. 

525
00:55:36,770 --> 00:55:41,790
  Instead, he'll try to take me by any means. 

526
00:55:42,530 --> 00:55:45,530
  But I have to stop him from killing people first. 

527
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:49,420
 If I don't come out even after thirty minutes, 

528
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:55,120
 then report it to the police. 

529
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:30,460
 Hee Jung. 

530
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:32,830
 Jung Hee Jung. 

531
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:57,470
 But when Kang Eun Joo arrived, the people were already dead. 

532
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:24,510
  All I want is you. 

533
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:26,690
  Stop trying to escape from me. 

534
00:57:26,690 --> 00:57:30,910
  Please, go together with me.  

535
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:45,650
  Kang Geun Taek anesthetized Kang Eun Joo.  

536
00:57:45,650 --> 00:57:50,940
And he tried to take her with him, but Kim Gab Yong came looking for her.

537
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:56,650
That's all I remember from Hanmin Care Home.

538
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:01,250
  I need to step out for a while. Can you keep an eye on this patient? 

539
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:05,640
 I woke up to find myself at the Pureum Care Home. 

540
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:10,750
  Kim Gab Yong gave me a new identity called Kim Song Hee.  

541
00:58:19,310 --> 00:58:20,950
Is that all true?

542
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:27,100
Yes, I saw Kim Gab Yong rescue Kim Eun Joo from Kang Geun Taek.

543
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:32,200
And, the last person who took her

544
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:36,390
was Seong Mo Hyung.

545
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:40,560
Prosecutor Kang was at the scene of Hanmin Care Home fire?

546
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:53,180
Let me ask you one more time.

547
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:58,920
You really haven't met Prosecutor Kang?

548
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:02,720
I haven't.

549
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:08,170
The indentation on your finger. It's from a ring, right?

550
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:11,120
A gift from Prosecutor Kang.

551
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:12,860
I don't know what you're talking about.

552
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:17,410
After your suicide attempt, you left that ring on the island.

553
00:59:17,410 --> 00:59:23,090
Was it because you didn't want Prosecutor Kang to find you

554
00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:25,340
ever again?

555
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:27,180
No.

556
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:30,540
After the Yeongseong Apartment fire, I have not met my son.

557
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:32,620
Not once!

558
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:47,490
We'll stop here for today.

559
00:59:53,650 --> 00:59:55,940
  Kooyang Hospital  

560
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:26,050
  In order to kill someone instantly, 

561
01:00:26,050 --> 01:00:28,580
  you shouldn't stab here, 

562
01:00:29,810 --> 01:00:34,680
  but here. You should've stabbed me here. 

563
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:38,140
  You said you wouldn't kill them if I came. 

564
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:43,600
  I was only trying what Kang Seong Mo did. 

565
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,040
  Like my son.  

566
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:48,550
  Don't say that. 

567
01:00:48,550 --> 01:00:51,360
  He's my son. He has nothing to do with you. 

568
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:53,590
  He's not a monster like you. 

569
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:56,330
  Yes, he's changed. 

570
01:00:56,330 --> 01:01:01,280
  Just like me, he was born unable to feel emotions. 

571
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:04,950
  What made this kid human?  

572
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:11,130
  Mother's love? If your efforts made this kid human,  

573
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:15,000
  then I should be human too.  

574
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:18,860
  But I am still,  

575
01:01:19,770 --> 01:01:22,750
  a monster without emotions.  

576
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:25,260
  What are you trying to say?  

577
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:28,420
  The Yeongseong Apartment murder,  

578
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:33,350
  I am telling you that is not what I did.  

579
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:36,040
  Even after making my fake dead body, 

580
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:39,310
 how can it not be your doing? 

581
01:01:50,230 --> 01:01:51,930
  Right.  

582
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:57,460
  It's me, the person who made the fake body.  

583
01:01:57,460 --> 01:02:02,920
  Because that's the only way I can take you with me.  

584
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:13,870
 But I didn't kill anyone else.  

585
01:02:13,870 --> 01:02:16,780
  I also didn't set the fire.  

586
01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:19,970
  I had the plan but...  

587
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:25,510
 Someone had already done it before I could.  

588
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:28,260
  That can't be.  

589
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:31,870
  Who else could do such a terrible thing if it wasn't you?  

590
01:02:31,870 --> 01:02:34,540
  Just like me,  

591
01:02:35,540 --> 01:02:38,910
  if you're a child without emotions, 

592
01:02:38,910 --> 01:02:41,550
  isn't that possible?  

593
01:02:47,650 --> 01:02:49,890
That's a lie.

594
01:02:49,890 --> 01:02:52,050
There is no way.

595
01:02:53,510 --> 01:02:57,550
Kang Geun Taek lied, right?

596
01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:03,970
Hurry up and tell me that Seong Mo didn't do it!

597
01:03:51,130 --> 01:03:56,640
Did Hyung tell you about my abilities, too?

598
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,040
I told you.

599
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:08,360
The places where you can hide,

600
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:12,710
I've already figured it all out.

601
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:44,080


602
01:04:45,730 --> 01:04:46,980
♫  It's crawling in the dark   ♫

603
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:48,640
  He is Psychometric  

604
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:51,410
♫  I'm chained up to the wall   ♫

605
01:04:51,410 --> 01:04:54,840
♫  I'm drownin' in my world   ♫

606
01:04:57,130 --> 01:05:02,750
♫  It's turning back again, I'm longing to face  ♫

607
01:05:02,750 --> 01:05:07,470
♫  I'll do it on my own  ♫

608
01:05:08,770 --> 01:05:14,570
♫  We'll make it end, take a look around  ♫

609
01:05:14,570 --> 01:05:15,680
♫  All together  ♫

610
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:18,250
  If it were your efforts that made that kid human, 

611
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:20,210
  then I should've been human too.  

612
01:05:20,210 --> 01:05:22,720
  No... 

613
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:26,800
  I feel like Prosecutor Kang is leading us to these past cases. 

614
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:29,150
  The man Kim Gab Yong was talking about... 

615
01:05:29,150 --> 01:05:31,250
  Ahn, we got a lead on where Prosecutor Kang is. 

616
01:05:31,250 --> 01:05:35,000
  If you don't look into it clearly, then history will only repeat itself. 

617
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:39,430
  Isn't this the last chance you could do something for Seong Mo? 

618
01:05:39,450 --> 01:05:41,330
  I am sorry for coming late.  

619
01:05:41,330 --> 01:05:43,910
  I'm going back now.
