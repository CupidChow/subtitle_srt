Love: A heart that treasures others and is warm.

To obsess (verb):

7
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,660
To have your mind continually drawn to and

8
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,220
cling to something that you can't forget.

9
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,220
Seong Mo.

10
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,200
It might be that person again.

11
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,040
 701! Apartment 701, you're home, right? 

12
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,330
 - You saw her go in right? 
- Yeah. 
- She's definitely home. 

13
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:53,230
 I have something to talk to you about. 

14
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:56,700
 Apartment 701! Open the door for a sec! 

15
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,350
- It's open. 
- What's this?

16
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:08,830
I have something to talk to your mom about. She's home, right?

17
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,790
Whatever it is, you can talk to me about it.

18
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,340
The security guard keeps posting this around everywhere.

19
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,160
Did you read it?

20
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,920
No.

21
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,400
Your mom hasn't joined the Women's Association, right?

22
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,390
We have a meeting at my place today. Can you tell her to come over?

23
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,060
Yes.

24
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,460
Okay. Well... I'll be going now.

25
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,950
What?

26
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:45,250
They're so strange, very weird.

27
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:49,270
They moved here over a month ago but they haven't even come by to greet us.

28
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,160
So ridiculous.

29
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,500
His mom's vibe was pretty gloomy too.

30
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,250
I found them.

31
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:19,090

- Episode 5 - 

33
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,630
 Police Station 

34
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,590
 If I become a cop, 

35
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,040
 when a suspect says they're not the criminal, 

36
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,970
I'm going to make sure three, four, even five times and then again, so that

37
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,350
there won't be anyone else misunderstood like my dad

38
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,850
or me.

39
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,920
That's what I thought.

40
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,110
So even if I can't prove that my dad was framed,

41
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:53,620
that's something done worthwhile anyway.

42
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:57,960
Have you finally thought about your life,

43
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,280
regardless of your dad?

44
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,950
- Hyung! 
- It's been a while

45
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,380
Officer Yoon Jae In.

46
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,690
Mister Daddy Long Legs... 
 ( Nickname for a benefactor sponsoring one through school ) 

47
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,900
Mister what?

48
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,030
Wow. What kind of fate is this?

49
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:50,990
So you were her sponsor for three years?

50
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,010
Yeah. It was the Reverend's recommendation.

51
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:57,600
So I was the one who told her to move into the place next to us

52
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,010
and the one who recommended that she transfer to your school.

53
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,870
I'm really sorry about back then.

54
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:05,650
I said I would graduate but I just disappeared. You were mad, right?

55
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:09,120
Don't worry about it. I truly believe that no matter how much you want to avoid it,

56
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,100
things that are meant to happen will happen and

57
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,080
people you're meant to meet you'll meet eventually.

58
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,560
- Since when? 
 - Since I watched the movie, "Comrades: Almost a Love Story"?

59
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,430
So what I'm saying is, instead of avoiding events or people,

60
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:27,380
- you should think about how to handle things from now on. 
- What?

61
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:32,230
"From now on." He's saying 'don't run away anymore' in such a difficult way.

62
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,670
Oh, give me your phone number.

63
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:37,640
My aunt really wants to treat you to a meal.

64
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,940
Okay well, if I say no, you'll continue to feel indebted to me, right?

65
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,830
What about my number? Hyung, write my number down under yours, too.

66
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:49,350
Anyway, I came to pick this punk up today.

67
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,340
Otherwise, he would've even spent the night down by the river.

68
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,530
You're right. He was seriously about to do that.

69
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,130
Contact me.

70
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:16,080
I have something to request of you.

71
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,940
Request? From me?

72
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,910
Because I have something urgent today, I'll ask you next time.

73
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,570
What is it?

74
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,370
You said you would repay me somehow so no rejecting my request.

75
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:30,720
- Okay. 
 - Well then.

76
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,280
What?

77
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:54,530
What is it? What request?!

78
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,020
Are you curious? Then...

79
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,960
I don't know. I can't see anything.

80
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,740
Hey. Don't do this here right now. Hey!

81
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,970
Ahn! Ahn! Hey!

82
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,470
Hey!

83
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,610
They probably misunderstood.

84
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,150
Hurry up and tell me!

85
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,000
Do you know what my hyung was going to ask of you?

86
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:50,960
I can't tell what goes on in my hyung's head.

87
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,880
No. My excuse is too awkward.

88
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,290
- Hey, where are you going?
 - We have a big problem!

89
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,170
Look at that!

90
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,530
Your car door damaged mine!

91
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:07,090
There was only one car next to mine this whole time,

92
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,220
so how dare you try to get out of this?

93
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,140
You hit me? Hit me again!

94
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,770
Use your words!

95
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,060
This brat!

96
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,350
What? An innocent person?

97
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,400
Are you okay?

98
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,740
Ladies! This is violence against the police.

99
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,220
What violence?

100
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,850
They did it first! Look at that!

101
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,940
Getting a dent is such a big problem?

102
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,550
Stop!

103
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,960
Nothing gets solved if you're acting like this!

104
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,470
I'm going to find the perpetrator or some evidence so in the meantime,

105
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,160
everyone calm down and wait.

106
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,610
 With what method is a young lady like you going to catch the criminal? 

107
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:38,690
 It's all over your face that you're a new cop. 

108
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,980
 Look at the audacity of the way you're talking to the police! 

109
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,240
 Do you always speak informally to everyone? 

110
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,730
Come here!

111
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,820
You knew, huh? Huh? And you still hit it?

112
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,390
 You're so rude! 

113
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,200
 You really...! 

114
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,010
 You talk down to everyone! 

115
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:06,300
 Come here! 

116
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,310
It's not that this car hit this one.

117
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,420
It got hit recently but

118
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,690
not by a car door,

119
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,230
something more blunt.

120
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:23,620
Like perhaps... a rock?

121
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,360
Yeah exactly.

122
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,260
Where did you find that?

123
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:32,600
Did you by any chance see who the criminal is?

124
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,550
 Hurry up and get me a hangover soup! 

125
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,210
 There's no kimchi. 

126
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,030
 Take this. 

127
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,060
 What are you doing, not doing your job properly? 

128
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,060
 I'm so sorry! 

129
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,560
 It got on my shoes! 

130
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,990
I know you did it because you were mad but

131
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:50,860
if you damage someone else's belongings,

132
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:54,740
you'll end up hurting your mom whom you were trying to protect.

133
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,680
That woman is so bad

134
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,290
that I was thinking of keeping it a secret but

135
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:05,100
if I keep it a secret, this memory is going to plant itself in your mind

136
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,310
and follow you around and bother you for a long time.

137
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:12,360
Do you want to keep this bad secret from your mom?

138
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,120
Right?

139
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,760
Tell them you were wrong.

140
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:31,110
I was wrong. I’m sorry.

141
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:33,320
How do you educate your child?

142
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,030
Why bash another person's car with a rock?

143
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:41,140
I’ll pay for the repairs.

144
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,100
Please contact me.

145
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:49,430
Don’t say anything later. It’s bad luck, really.

146
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:54,010
Ahjumma! Are you not going to apologize to me?

147
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,090
You made an innocent person out to be a criminal! What do you think you're doing?

148
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:00,020
Who said to park your car next to mine?

149
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:05,170
But, ma’am, don’t come to our store from now on.

150
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:10,360
I will educate my daughter properly so that she won't become someone like you.

151
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,610
It would be nice—

152
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,290
if you wouldn't come to our store again.

153
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,770
I can't believe what I'm hearing!

154
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:24,500
There's always someone like her out there.

155
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,080
If it weren't for you, I would've hit her.

156
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,920
Thank you.

157
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,150
Thank you. And I’m sorry.

158
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,600
I’m sorry.

159
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,690
What's this feeling?

160
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,050
I guess sometimes you don't really win even when you reveal the truth.

161
00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:02,660
You might not have won but at least you really established your skill.

162
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:06,920
Established what? I see things to this extent occasionally.

163
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,180
It's just that situations like this don't happen often.

164
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:13,740
You figured it out but I was the one who got 'thanked'.

165
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,740
Is something going on?

166
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:24,320
You don’t look like you're in a good mood today.

167
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,320
Just... There are just days like this.

168
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,350
Everyone has them.

169
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,260
It’s a bad day.

170
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,690
There are days like that.

171
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,250
Hyung!

172
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:54,810
Aish! That hurt.

173
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:19,360
It's because you keep instinctively avoiding putting your hand on things that your skills aren't improving.

174
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,650
Who says I'm not improving?

175
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:24,370
Even if you don't want to be psychometric,

176
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:28,090
don't avoid touching stuff if you want to get involved in case-work.

177
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:30,220
I'm not.

178
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,850
This is just a habit.

179
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:41,350
Only trying to touch things that are involved with cases

180
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:45,230
is just like trying to avoid studying for an exam by only looking at the answers.

181
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,940
Do you know what I'm saying?

182
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,940
I got it. I'll practice.

183
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,640
I told you I’d do it.

184
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:56,320
I changed my password this morning.

185
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:58,690
Wow, you're the worst...

186
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,480
I can finish this in 3 seconds.

187
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,970
Only six digits? 051203.

188
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,580
You know, the thing about numbers...

189
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,860
If the person who changed it changes it often, they won't be able to memorize it either.

190
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:38,180
It's definitely a date. Just looking at it it's December 3rd, 2005—

191
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,300
What?

192
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:51,430
  December 3, 2018 

193
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,600
  You like this one?  

194
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,980
 Yeah, my dad’s the best.  

195
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,770
  It’s not my dad.  

196
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:13,210
 My dad didn't kill anyone! 

197
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:14,780
 Dad! 

198
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,500
  Jae In!  

199
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,300
 Dad! 

200
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,130
Stuff like my birthday...

201
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:14,490
You said you won't do anything.

202
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:53,140
Jae In. Jae In, what’s wrong?

203
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,040
You were fine just now.

204
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,500
 December 3, 2018 

205
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,290
Today is that day.

206
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:18,440
I don't think my dad did it but,

207
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,920
why does my heart hurt

208
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,940
every time this day comes around, Aunt?

209
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,230
 Ta-da! Here's a puppy! 

210
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,390
 Woof, woof! Woof, woof! 

211
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:58,000
 Woof, woof, woof! 

212
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:05,720
 But the families of those who died that day, 

213
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,280
 they're probably hurting a lot more than I am, right? 

214
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:17,170
 Those people will probably live the rest of their lives hating my dad, right? 

215
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:28,680
That's not your fault. Not yours, Jae In.

216
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:57,910
 Ahn, instead of a puppy, I'll give you anything else. 

217
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:00,040
 Why are you taking that? 

218
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,420
 Mom! Dad! 

219
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,200
 What do you mean you can't get fingerprints? 

220
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,740
 Dad! 

221
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,420
Mom...

222
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,560
 What do you mean you can't identify the witness? 

223
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,690
Why not? Seriously, why not?!

224
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:53,830
Why are you so out there today?

225
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:57,010
She has to get married if she can't catch the criminal.

226
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:58,630
Won't you be quiet?

227
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,510
You said we'd be able to do it yesterday.

228
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,820
Why can't you identify anymore?

229
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:06,320
It looked fine with a naked eye, but the dermis was actually extremely damaged.

230
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,590
I was barely able to get small traces, but there aren't any matches.

231
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:16,950
Gosh, this is nuts. If we can't identify the body, you know this will go unsolved.

232
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:19,830
Do you think I don't know that? Just wait a little longer.

233
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:24,680
Since the body was under water for a long time, I'm considering using the steam technique.

234
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:31,120
If that really doesn't work, then I'll have to get married!

235
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:36,280
Do you think you're the only one? If that were the case, I would've been married a thousand times girl! Move!

236
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,190
 So annoying. 

237
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:41,750
Please!

238
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,540
If you do that, can you really get a— 
 NFS Lab 

239
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,230
Move.

240
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:50,510
 (Wet Heat Technique: Retrieves fingerprints by dipping object in 100 degree Celsius water for three seconds)  

241
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,890
Three seconds.

242
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:54,370
One, two...

243
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,300
You're dead if you don't bring me my car back today.

244
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,990
If it's scratched, then our friendship is done.

245
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:26,660
  I almost died thirteen years ago today.  

246
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:30,260
  Today is the death anniversary date for my parents. I'll see you later. 

247
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:35,530
Death anniversary date for...

248
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:40,660
This is like he's asking me to give him the car. Okay, just keep it.

249
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,950
Welcome!

250
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:47,000
I'll do it.

251
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,010
Yes, how much do you want me to fill it?

252
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,880
Full, please.

253
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,930
- Full? 
- Yes.

254
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,210
Hyung!

255
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,680
Hyung?

256
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,620
  Seo Hen Parcel Service 

257
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,840
Yes, you can go in.

258
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:38,490
  Lee Jung Bok, Yoo Jin Hee  

259
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:48,970
You're here. Why didn't you wake me up?

260
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:51,470
You were sleeping so well.

261
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:57,210
Are you paying respect to my parents? Then I'll go do the same.

262
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,940
Have you been well? 
   Kang Eun Joo June 14th 1970 - December 3rd 2005 
 Rest in Peace Son: Kang Seong Mo   

263
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:15,630
As you can see, Hyung is doing well.

264
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:20,540
He lacks social skills but is really great at his work.

265
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:26,270
He lacks expression of his emotions and has no sense of humor.

266
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:30,700
But he makes good money and recently bought a house so he can get married.

267
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,100
You're complimenting me, right?

268
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:36,150
You know that he saved my life.

269
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:41,530
He's the one who kept me accountable when I was struggling, too.

270
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,280
So...

271
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,500
I'll protect him from now on.

272
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:55,450
I'm only a jobless test-taker who can't even support myself right now,

273
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:59,660
but I'll return this flavor each day until my last day.

274
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,810
You mean favor.

275
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:06,190
Oh, favor.

276
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:10,380
Ah, I memorized this to say to you.

277
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,940
Your parents are waiting too long.

278
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:24,650
We're...

279
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:30,080
connected without words.

280
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,910
 Lee Jung Nok, Yoo Jin Hee 

281
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:41,920
I touched my parents' stuff yesterday.

282
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:48,190
I couldn't use my psychometry.

283
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:52,960
It must mean that your memories are fading on those items.

284
00:27:55,130 --> 00:28:00,080
When the day comes that I can control my ability,

285
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:05,090
do you think I can read my parents' memories?

286
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:11,280
I think so.

287
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,930
I'll

288
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,460
make it happen.

289
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,110
The very first psychometrist in Korea?

290
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:22,510
When that day comes, I'll...

291
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:30,580
No, nothing.

292
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:37,440
 Stop coming to the morgue. 

293
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,020
 - Give it up.
- Are you frustrated like me? 

294
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:43,380
 I'm going crazy, too. It's not like I can improve like grades with studying. 

295
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,740
 Maybe you lack drive and tenacity. 

296
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:50,620
 Do you want to say that in front of Norangjin? 

297
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:57,580
 Listen, Ahn,  Prosecutor Kang... 

298
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,330
 What about Hyung? 

299
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:05,190
 It seems like he's asking for your help. 

300
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:06,810
 Hyung? 

301
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,000
 From me? 

302
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,840
 Yeah, I'm not sure completely but that's what I think. 

303
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,150
 He's the only one who you can't use your psychometry on, 

304
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:22,660
 so that must mean that he's completely closed up. 

305
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:30,670
 He must be so lonely and there must be a reason for it too. 

306
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:36,760
 You must not be the only one who has felt lonely. 

307
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:40,970
What are you doing? Aren't you coming?

308
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:47,020
Let's go together. I'll go everywhere with you.

309
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,860
That sounds so serious.

310
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:51,420
I'm on my way to see Detective Yoon.

311
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:54,350
Why are you going to see her?

312
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:58,050
Are you finally going to ask her for that favor?

313
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,400
Didn't you hear?

314
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,090
To say it again,

315
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:13,200
I hope that you can develop Ahn's psychometric ability.

316
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:18,910
Officer Yoon, you know about Ahn's abilities.

317
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:21,960
How do you know that?

318
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:26,390
 Who is that? 

319
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,760
 Yoon Jae In? 

320
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,700
 Why are you here? 

321
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:45,190
 Because this is my house. I didn't listen because I wanted to. 

322
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:49,730
You heard everything?

323
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:51,320
Up until when?

324
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,590
I'll come to you.

325
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,850
 I'll come to you. 

326
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:58,550
Even that.

327
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:02,440
Especially your words of saying you'd "shake his hand or whatever else" was quite—

328
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,830
Ah, stop!

329
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:07,980
I felt your sincerity.

330
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,800
Wait a minute. Okay, so you overheard it.

331
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:13,020
But why are you telling her to develop my skills?

332
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:16,300
You can decline if you don't want to.

333
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:21,820
But I hope you can do this and not another person.

334
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:30,280
Can you give me some time to think it through?

335
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,450
I need time to think, too.

336
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:35,530
Please don't think. I'll think along with Jae In.

337
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:40,980
If you help me with this, I can return the favor by looking into your transfer.

338
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,890
I think I can help you, too.

339
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:56,620
Where did you go?

340
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,410
You look tired.

341
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:12,780
The main office called about the suitcase murder.

342
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,150
What did they say?

343
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:16,450
We're to take down the police line.

344
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:19,300
Oh, okay.

345
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:24,450
Gosh, that was a tough one.

346
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:27,750
Oh goodness, you're here.

347
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:30,680
Jae In, let's eat lunch.

348
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,780
You came in a strong outfit today.

349
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,580
Thank you.

350
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,550
I see that you didn't have a class this morning.

351
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:43,290
Yes, the Senior Center took the ladies on a field trip.

352
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:44,450
But how did you know that?

353
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:46,800
A veteran never loses his touch.

354
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,030
I had a hunch.

355
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:50,630
It's the three-tier lunchbox.

356
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:54,610
He knew because you always cook a lot when you don't have a morning class.

357
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:56,750
You're learning very quickly.

358
00:32:56,750 --> 00:33:01,180
And here I thought I was slipping some clues.

359
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,170
Let's eat together.

360
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:07,080
Should I? I'll go and wash my hands.

361
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,640
Please keep this for me.

362
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,660
What is this fur?

363
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,670
It's part of me.

364
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:16,760
Why is he doing this to me?

365
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,940
He's so disgusting.

366
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:21,130
Hey, doesn't he have a wife?

367
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:25,560
He's a Wild Goose Dad. I heard his wife is in Canada with their son.     

368
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:29,790
His son's graduation and his retirement are at the same time so he's counting the days.

369
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:32,970
Guys are gross when their wives are not around.

370
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:35,230
Why does he count how many layers of lunch I bring?

371
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:39,400
And why did he give me his disgusting nose hair?

372
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:44,990
What is it? I'm thankful that he allowed me to live here so I just wanted to be polite and invited him to eat a few times

373
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:49,050
and now he expects to eat with me.

374
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:52,730
I'm not sure if I seem like I expect to eat with you.

375
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:56,740
I'll use my utensils.

376
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:00,710
Wow, it gets better each time.

377
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:03,860
Jae In, go ahead and eat.

378
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,980
Hey, Jae In. Did you hear?

379
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,220
Hear what?

380
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:11,570
One of your classmates arrested a thief and a murder suspect.

381
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:14,890
So he'll be hired and be promoted.

382
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:16,390
Ah yes, I heard.

383
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:19,450
Is that possible when his probation period hasn't ended yet?

384
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:22,540
It's because that area has too many cases.

385
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:24,580
Your friend was lucky.

386
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,900
No, Jae In is luckier.

387
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,850
If she is promoted to Homicide Division, she'd have to chase after slashers all the time.

388
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:31,560
She's in a much better place than he is.

389
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,870
There are not too many cases, work hours are set, and they don't ask for overtime.

390
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:39,260
I used to be very competent but it's no use.

391
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,170
Why do you keep on poking me?

392
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:44,440
No, please eat more meat, too.

393
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,790
You seem weak these days.

394
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:49,630
 Ah, open your mouth. Eat meat. 

395
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:53,010
 Off Limits - Police Line 

396
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:03,750
So what that we found the body?

397
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:06,950
I don't know what to do from now on.

398
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:12,400
 I want Jae In to help develop the Ahn's psychometric ability. 

399
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,900
Why did he ask Yoon Jae In?

400
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:22,430
 Your ability can see who holds a knife 

401
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:25,140
 but can't see who he killed. 

402
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:30,050
 Or can't tell if he's holding a knife 

403
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:32,170
 to cover for someone. 

404
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:36,780
 Don't be proud to see only 

405
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:39,280
 a few pieces out of thousands of pieces. 

406
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,200
I see puzzle pieces

407
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,350
and Yoon Jae In puts them together?

408
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:53,760
  Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency  

409
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:23,760
 Please look this way! I'll take it now. Please look here! 
   

410
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,840
 One, two... 

411
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:29,440
 Please look this way, too. 

412
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:35,900
 This way. This way! 

413
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,630
 One, two! Look this way one more time! 

414
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,310
Oh, Yoon Jae In!

415
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,230
Congratulations!

416
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,460
Congratulations!

417
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,730
You guys should also catch thugs

418
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:48,980
that'd give you high-performance points.

419
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:53,510
I feel bad that I'm the only one being promoted.

420
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:54,980
Congratulations!

421
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:58,060
Here, I'll take more pictures! Look over here!

422
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:02,140
Please, smile! One, two, three!

423
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:10,740
Promotion...

424
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:15,160
Promotion to the Homicide Division...

425
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:23,160
Hello!

426
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,090
What performance points?

427
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:31,490
Would I want crimes to happen just to be promoted?

428
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:33,930
According to whose standard is that?

429
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,580
 Oops! 

430
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,680
 Bang! 

431
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:03,160
Ten points for a pickpocket.

432
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,580
 Swishy... 

433
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,610
 Splaaaash! 

434
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,930
Twenty points for organized crime.

435
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:43,810
 Condolence Money 

436
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:44,880
 How much are you giving? 

437
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,990
Hello.

438
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:53,360
Hello.

439
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,170
Please, take care.

440
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,120
 No! 

441
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,010
 Boom! 

442
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:10,190
 What? 

443
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,200
Twenty points for arson.

444
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:19,100
Ye Won!

445
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:25,060
♫ Happy Birthday to you ♫

446
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,700
I'm going crazy.

447
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,770
I only calculate points while looking at people.

448
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:33,410
What kind of policewoman are you?

449
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:50,340
Murder... Fifty points.

450
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:19,170
Seventy points for robbery and murder.

451
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:38,010
Did you think about what Hyung said?

452
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:39,270
I'm contemplating it.

453
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,260
I'm done contemplating.

454
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,600
I want you to do it.

455
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:50,240
Even if I do it, I don't know how to do it.

456
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:54,950
Like you said before, 'you have to do everything.'

457
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:00,000
But even if you don't know how to do it yet,

458
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,850
you have good reasons why you should do it.

459
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:04,610
Reasons why I should do it?

460
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:10,630
I met you a long time before two years ago.

461
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,300
You did?

462
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:40,010
 My daughter, you need to tie your shoelaces. 

463
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:43,110
 My daughter can't fall. 

464
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:46,250
♫  Why do I keep seeing through your eyes  ♫

465
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:49,330
I did psychometry on you,

466
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:54,440
soon after I met you.

467
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:58,020
I didn't even know about my ability back then.

468
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:06,720
 Then can't you ask them to free my dad? 

469
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,860
 My dad is not a bad person. Really. 

470
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:12,390
 Strangely that day, 

471
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:17,300
 I couldn't forget about you. 

472
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,230
Now, I think of it,

473
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:25,240
that was the day I thought maybe I can help people with my ability.

474
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:31,240
Are you saying I met you?

475
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:34,530
You gave me candy, too?

476
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:36,660
You really can't remember?

477
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:37,630
Not at all.

478
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:39,240
Even though you forgot everything,

479
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:43,930
you are the first client to ask my help in a case.

480
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:46,960
First client?

481
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:52,840
So let's do it together.

482
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:59,490
♫  I can be there right with you  ♫

483
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:03,090
♫  And I will walk with you always  ♫

484
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:06,430
If I hold your hand,

485
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:12,520
to what extent will you know my secrets?

486
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,990
I don't know that.

487
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:18,780
People's memories are like a jumbled up pillbox, so

488
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:26,910
I won't know unless I take it to know if it's poison or the antidote.

489
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:43,120
It's not like my ability will develop only through touching.

490
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,670
I haven't decided to take the job or not.

491
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:49,720
It's not like I'm avoiding touching you.

492
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:54,800
Let's say that's the case.

493
00:43:56,770 --> 00:44:02,350
But even though there are many reasons for me to do it, I just have no idea how to help you develop.

494
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:05,060
I don't even know why the prosecutor asked me either.

495
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:09,170
♫  Because I'll be with you  ♫

496
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:13,540
♫  I can be there  ♫

497
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:17,460
If you were to help me, what kind of cases would you take?

498
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:21,900
Think about that.

499
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:25,250
I'll do everything else.

500
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:32,350
♫  Let me be there to guide your way  ♫

501
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:37,240
♫  It's okay to cry  ♫

502
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:43,190
♫  Someday we are all down  ♫

503
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:10,170
What? Are you going out again?

504
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:11,750
I'm late. Detective Eun is waiting.

505
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,620
Ji Soo is waiting?

506
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:18,630
Oh my. Did you take that case? The carrier case?

507
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:22,030
They identified the victim, right?

508
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:26,240
Won't you tell me? Tell me quickly.

509
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:28,070
Tell me quickly.

510
00:45:28,070 --> 00:45:30,670
It was a woman last time, too.

511
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:36,970
We're...

512
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:40,930
The body will be identified soon.

513
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:43,600
In other words, I don't have time to fool around with you.

514
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,260
I'm leaving.

515
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:49,370
Please report to your first witness, okay?

516
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:52,440
Ahjussi. Ahjussi. Hyung!

517
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:55,770
Please tell me! Ahjussi!

518
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:07,770
Wait a minute. I found the body.

519
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:10,520
I have to stick to him no matter what.

520
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:25,030
Where did he go?

521
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:10,710
  Seo Heun Parcel Service  

522
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:34,540
What is with that truck?

523
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:41,300
 Seoul Institute of Scientific Investigation 

524
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:08,790
 Seo Heun Parcel Service 

525
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:31,110
Yeah. What?

526
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:34,170
Someone followed you from our house.

527
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:36,130
 When I approached him, he ran away. 

528
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:37,180
Who was he?

529
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:37,840
 I don't know. 

530
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,260
I'm following him so I'll call you later.

531
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:42,260
Ahn, don't do anything dangerous. Come back. Ahn.

532
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:44,770
Ahn! Lee Ahn!

533
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:48,230
You're here. They have the results.

534
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:51,330
What's wrong with him?

535
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:53,400
Prosecutor Kang!

536
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:05,790
Who are you?

537
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:08,170
Who are you to follow my hyung?

538
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,720
 Ah! 

539
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:35,820
 Emergency Center 

540
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:43,200
Ahn. You have to wake up. Lee Ahn!

541
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,670
He was following you.

542
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:48,670
Don't talk. You're bleeding too much.

543
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:50,560
He's been observing you for a long time.

544
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:54,020
The day we fell from the apartment,

545
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:56,280
he was observing you that day, too.

546
00:53:16,090 --> 00:53:19,800
He should be okay since it missed vital organs.

547
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,490
They say the surgery went well, too.

548
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:27,980
Prosecutor Kang.

549
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:30,490
We're making Doctor Hong wait too long.

550
00:53:30,490 --> 00:53:32,350
Let's go.

551
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:49,020
 He was following you. 

552
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:50,850
 He has been observing you for a long time. 

553
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:53,990
 The day we fell from the apartment, 

554
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:56,070
 he was observing you that day, too. 

555
00:53:56,070 --> 00:54:00,240
You know who it is, Prosecutor Kang, right?

556
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:04,650
If it's the day you and Ahn fell from the apartment,

557
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:06,970
that was thirteen years ago.

558
00:54:06,970 --> 00:54:09,790
If he's been observing you since then,

559
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:12,120
does that mean he's connected to the Yeongseung Apartment fire?

560
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:16,120
Is he the one you think is the criminal?

561
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,350
Hey, Kang Seong Mo!

562
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:54,350
Why do you hide so much?

563
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:57,660
For two years, you’ve been worrying and thinking alone.

564
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:59,960
I'm telling you I'll help you.

565
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:02,880
Am I really no help to you at all?

566
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:09,190
I know it'd be regretful.

567
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:11,380
Who? Me?

568
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:12,980
No.

569
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:21,940
Me.

570
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:27,690
I’m leaving.

571
00:55:31,450 --> 00:55:33,680
What I dropped earlier...

572
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:37,160
You can't throw away food. Wrap up and go home.

573
00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:39,610
Yes.

574
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:44,170
 Open, 09:00-18:00, Seo Heun Police 

575
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:49,140
 Closed, 18:00-09:00, Seo Heun Police  

576
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:15,260
Are you waiting for anyone?

577
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:17,430
No.

578
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:21,770
No. Lee Ahn?

579
00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:25,140
It’s not that, so...

580
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:27,150
Have you finished work?

581
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:31,760
Yes, I’m off. Today has been very strange.

582
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:35,420
Lucky you. A mom's work is never finished.

583
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:39,200
When I get off work, I start my job at home.

584
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:42,120
Want to grab some beer upstairs?

585
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,790
I really want to.

586
00:56:43,790 --> 00:56:48,200
Hey, you deserve it. I can also use the excuse and get a break myself.

587
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:50,290
- Let's go! 
 - I really shouldn't.

588
00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:51,920
Let's go!

589
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:07,290
Are you coming to your senses?

590
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:13,620
Fortunately, the organs weren’t damaged, so the surgery was over quickly.

591
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:18,150
Your guardian said he will come back, so rest.

592
00:57:36,330 --> 00:57:38,520
It’s good.

593
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:40,820
- The beer tastes good. 
 - Great, great!

594
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:48,920
Drink this. You said you wanted to relax.

595
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:53,480
No alcohol since working at a police station is a 24/7 job.

596
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:55,830
Forget it. Let's just drink.

597
00:57:59,950 --> 00:58:01,170
Nice.

598
00:58:01,170 --> 00:58:04,750
This is nice. This room is full of good vibes right now.

599
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:06,430
Feel the vibe?

600
00:58:06,430 --> 00:58:08,400
Drink up.

601
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:14,020
Thank you, Auntie.

602
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:19,620
Yes, let me babysit from time to time if you don't have anyone to take care of her. Okay?

603
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:20,320
Yes.

604
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:21,560
Hurry up and take her home.

605
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:23,890
- I'll be back. Be careful. 
 - Sure.

606
00:58:23,890 --> 00:58:25,740
She's really drunk.

607
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:27,530
Bye.

608
00:58:42,290 --> 00:58:44,660
She fell asleep already.

609
00:58:55,930 --> 00:58:57,880
Coupons...

610
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,070
 Dae Bong 

611
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:03,720
 You were racing in my car? Are you crazy or something? 

612
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:07,250
Hey, I'm the one who got hurt.

613
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:10,030
Your car is perfectly fine.

614
00:59:10,030 --> 00:59:12,900
Forget it. We're not friends anymore.

615
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:15,090
I'm not kidding. Bring my car back and don't ever call me again.

616
00:59:15,090 --> 00:59:17,520
 Dae Bong, I'm hungry. 

617
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:20,130
Bring me some food.

618
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:22,830
You're hungry? What do you want to eat?

619
00:59:22,830 --> 00:59:26,210
 Spicy rice cakes? Dumplings? What? Which hospital are you in? 

620
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:28,520
I want a sundae.

621
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:32,390
What the heck? He hung up so fast.

622
00:59:35,010 --> 00:59:37,090
This isn't it.

623
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:48,030
That's right. This is your gas station.

624
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:53,390
Long time, no see.

625
00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:55,040
Here.

626
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,980
There are

627
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:14,360
too many things I'm curious about.

628
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:20,210
Hurry and come, Hyung.

629
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:26,760
I heard you identified the missing person.

630
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:34,990
Where is the convenience store?

631
01:00:34,990 --> 01:00:37,930
Go down to the second floor underground.

632
01:00:37,930 --> 01:00:39,730
Thank you.

633
01:00:39,730 --> 01:00:42,190
 What did you just say? 

634
01:00:42,190 --> 01:00:46,710
Who is the corpse inside the suitcase?

635
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:50,760
Do you remember Kang Hee Soo?

636
01:00:54,170 --> 01:00:58,420
The caretaker who disappeared from the nursing home fire two years ago?

637
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:02,790
Yes. The woman with the ring that Ahn saw through his psychometry.

638
01:01:02,790 --> 01:01:03,890
 I saw a woman. 

639
01:01:03,890 --> 01:01:06,150
 She was wearing a ring. 

640
01:01:07,610 --> 01:01:09,730
But there's no ring.

641
01:01:09,730 --> 01:01:12,300
Not just the ring. There are so many other strange things.

642
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:13,850
What strange things?

643
01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:16,320
No matter how I look at it, things don't add up.

644
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:20,480
It doesn't make sense that this woman was alive two years ago.

645
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:24,620
This corpse is at least four or five years old.

646
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:30,980
You can't determine the time of death for a corpse found underwater, right?

647
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:32,420
That's right.

648
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:36,340
But we do have another corpse.

649
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:38,450
Just like Park Soo Hyung's body that was found last time,

650
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:40,210
I believe the time of death, the murder method,

651
01:01:40,210 --> 01:01:43,080
and the time the body was abandoned, all coincide.

652
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:47,060
There's no way. There is a definite record that says she worked at Han Min Nursing Home two years ago.

653
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:50,250
That fact bothered me too, so I've been checking and rechecking.

654
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:54,320
The time of her death is definitely before the Han Min Nursing Home fire.

655
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:58,450
If you've confirmed the fingerprints, it is certain that this corpse is Kang Hee Soo.

656
01:01:58,450 --> 01:02:03,890
Then who is the Kang Hee Soo that worked in Han Min Nursing Home two years ago?

657
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:06,560
That's what we need to find out.

658
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:36,970
Wait. Never mind, Hyung.

659
01:02:36,970 --> 01:02:40,290
Why isn't that Dae Bong here yet?

660
01:03:01,330 --> 01:03:05,070
 Who are you? Why are you after my hyung? 

661
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:12,190
Who could it be?

662
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:32,160
 Lee Ahn 

663
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:00,900
 Restricted Area 

664
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:51,030
Hey, why are you so late? Do you know how long I waited for you?

665
01:04:51,790 --> 01:04:58,740
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by the Just One Touch Team at Viki 

666
01:05:00,470 --> 01:05:08,100
 He Is Psychometric 

667
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:10,720
♫  I know you lie  ♫

668
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:20,440
♫  Feel your heart, the coincidences that keep repeating itself with us  ♫

669
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:25,770
♫  So take, the feelings that I've been hiding  ♫

670
01:05:25,770 --> 01:05:30,570
♫  Take all the time I've been saving up for you  ♫

671
01:05:30,570 --> 01:05:32,400
♫  Don't be afraid  ♫

672
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:33,970
 I'll investigate everything again. 

673
01:05:33,970 --> 01:05:36,430
 - Go. 
 - Did he come by already? 

674
01:05:36,430 --> 01:05:38,650
 It may be over only if I die. 

675
01:05:38,650 --> 01:05:41,310
 Officer Yoon Jae In's father is the Yeongseung Apartment fire's... 

676
01:05:41,310 --> 01:05:42,090
 Yoon Tae Ha. 

677
01:05:42,090 --> 01:05:45,430
 Is this what "pretty" looks like? 

678
01:05:45,430 --> 01:05:46,390
 It was him. I'm sure. 

679
01:05:46,390 --> 01:05:47,330
 Kim Gap Yong? 

680
01:05:47,330 --> 01:05:49,950
 He killed Kang Hee Soo. 

681
01:05:49,950 --> 01:05:51,190
 I'll ask you one thing. 

682
01:05:51,190 --> 01:05:54,650
 How much of his power do I need to draw out of him? 

683
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:57,420
 Until he can read me through psychometry. 

684
01:05:57,420 --> 01:05:59,620
 What's wrong, Lee Ahn! Wake up! 

685
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:00,850
 Come to your senses! Hey! 

686
01:06:00,850 --> 01:06:03,090
♫  More than anything  ♫
