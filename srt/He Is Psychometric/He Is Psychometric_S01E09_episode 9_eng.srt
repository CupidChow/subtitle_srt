 November 1st, 2005
Yeongseong Apartment  

5
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:49,220
The villains have showed up. All members, attack!

6
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,770
Come on guys, let's go!

7
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,380
Let's go!

8
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:06,450
It's a strange man.

9
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,370
Can you lend me that if it's a real gun, or move aside?

10
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:14,000
But you really are suspicious. Other people would be at school around this time.

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,710
Why are you here?

12
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:16,970
Because I don't go to school.

13
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:18,860
If you don't go to school,

14
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,670
why are you wearing a school uniform?

15
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,420
Are you interrogating me?

16
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,040
Where are you running off to?

17
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,710
Constable Kim, arrest this person. He's suspicious.

18
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,630
- You're with him?
- No, I'm not.

19
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,250
What are you doing? Search him, Constable Kim!

20
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:55,370
My family name is Yoon, so it isn't Constable Kim, it's Constable Yoon.

21
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:58,740
Oh, I see...

22
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,050
But he sure is suspicious.

23
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,840
Why aren't you going to school?

24
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,930
The reason why I'm not at school at this time is that I don't go to school,

25
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:12,080
and the reason why I'm wearing a uniform despite that,

26
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:17,250
is so my mom doesn't get worried that I'm not at school. Does that satisfy you?

27
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,180
He sure is suspicious.

28
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,900
He seems to have hurt his leg,

29
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,110
but he always walks around like that in the cold.

30
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,070
Do you know him?

31
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,750
No.

32
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,440
But do you know me?

33
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,300
Of course, I do! You're Constable Yoon.

34
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,570
Let's play together.

35
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,710
Sure.

36
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:56,030
But next time. I’m a little busy now.
    

37
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,550
You have to play with me next time, okay?

38
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:06,240

  - Episode 9 -

40
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,080
Your shoelaces are untied.

41
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,010
Sorry. I didn't mean to.

42
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,380
I like the snow.

43
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,940
You can't feel anything no matter how much you touch it.

44
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,310
There is no painful past,

45
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,710
and it doesn't make me think a lot, either.

46
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,530
But the best thing is that

47
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,080
you don't need to ask for permission to touch it.

48
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,020
The surprise attack...

49
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:35,880
I'm not sure if it worked.

50
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:44,430
You've been caught red-handed.

51
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,150
Your feelings.

52
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:50,150
♫   Even if we drift apart again   ♫

53
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:55,590
♫   And I can't see your eyes anymore   ♫

54
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:59,920
♫   My heart remembers   ♫

55
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:07,110
♫   After a long time passes by  ♫

56
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:12,640
♫   When the memory of you   ♫

57
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,120
 It's nice to have a big one up for a long time.  

58
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,880
♫   If I call your name   ♫

59
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,480
♫   And you hear me   ♫

60
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:29,740
♫   I'll recognize you   ♫

61
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:35,300
♫   I'll carress your eyes   ♫

62
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:40,020
♫   Don’t every cry again   ♫

63
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,520
♫   I'll be the time that you need  ♫

64
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,450
♫  I'll be the time that you need   ♫

65
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:49,940
♫   I'll recognize your heart   ♫

66
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:54,760
♫   Don't hurt alone again   ♫

67
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,530
♫   I'll stay here   ♫

68
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:02,910
♫   With you   ♫

69
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:11,690
♫   Your eyes tell me   ♫

70
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:22,390
♫   My heart remembers you   ♫

71
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,410
Don't run away anymore,

72
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,250
or cry by yourself.

73
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,820
The past that you've been running away from all this time,

74
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,260
I'll look into everything.

75
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,160
You saw everything?

76
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,190
About me?

77
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,720
A little.

78
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:11,810
Even though I saw very little,

79
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:14,420
I felt your emotions.

80
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:21,870
I was curious as to why I, of all people, got the ability to read people's pasts.

81
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:26,230
I mean, logically, isn't seeing the future better?

82
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,350
You can stop dangerous situations,

83
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:33,290
avoid hardships,

84
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:39,260
buy a lottery ticket and become rich.

85
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,490
But now I know

86
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,280
why I see the past.

87
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:54,710
You can send all of your bad memories to me.

88
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:01,110
Though I can't go to the past and help you start again,

89
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,390
at least from now on,

90
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:11,660
I'll only give you good memories.

91
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:41,460
You said you'd be excited for just two hours, and you really changed back.

92
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:47,030
Stop drinking, or at least eat some food while you're at it.

93
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:53,150
Have  I ever mentioned that I was very sick as a child?

94
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,500
You were sick? Where?

95
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,700
I had a disease where my heart would beat rapidly at any time.

96
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:02,180
As in paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia?

97
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,580
I never knew you had such a disease, since you're so healthy now.

98
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:11,480
A while after I recovered, I went to the orphanage where Ahn was.

99
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,120
Orphanage?

100
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:19,120
That kid's parents also passed away from the fire at Yeongseong Apartment, right?

101
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,020
Ahn's father was my dad's junior colleague.

102
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,120
He wasn't in the situation to be able to take in Ahn alone,

103
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,640
but my dad must have been concerned for him and visited the orphanage often.

104
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,320
 Yay! 

105
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,570
That was where I met Kang Seong Mo.

106
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,170
 You guys aren't playing soccer? I came here to play with you guys. 

107
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,060
 I'm not playing. 

108
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:52,950
 - I don't like coming into contact with people. 
 - What about you? 

109
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,780
 I don't see the fun in soccer. 

110
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,230
 Then what's fun to you? 

111
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,350
 Nothing. 

112
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,620
 Nothing's fun. 

113
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,630
 Hey, your brother is real strange. 

114
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,580
 I told you I don't like touching people. 

115
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,090
 I guess you're even stranger. 

116
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:19,410
 Noona, were you ever in a hospital for a long time? 

117
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:22,090
 Like getting surgeries? 

118
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:26,050
 How do you know that? Did you hear from my dad? 

119
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:30,380
  See, I saw it again. 

120
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,000
 Lee Ahn, 

121
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,790
 Hey, Lee Ahn! 

122
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,970
 Will you be able to be responsible for that kid for the rest of your life? 

123
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:44,980
 Don't come here if you're coming just for rash pity or sympathy. 

124
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:48,860
 Tell that to your father, too, to spend this time 

125
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,960
 reinvestigating the Yeongseong Apartment case instead. 

126
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:58,060
Kang Seong Mo thought there was something wrong with the Yeongseong Apartment case from the beginning.

127
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,650
Is that why he became a prosecutor?

128
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:05,940
Is that why you became a detective as well? To reinvestigate the case?

129
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,200
I was rather the opposite.

130
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,250
I wanted to prove that my dad wasn't wrong.

131
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,730
I looked into that case as the very first thing after becoming a police officer,

132
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:16,420
and there was nothing to be suspicious of at all.

133
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:20,290
In the situation with no body left, and all evidence destroyed,

134
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:25,230
how could you know the truth with just a piece of a written investigation?

135
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:28,330
It's a document. It's enough if you make it somehow.

136
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,430
Do you,

137
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:36,420
think the same way?

138
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:40,510
Yeongseong Apartment, Hanmin Care Home, and Kim Gab Yong,

139
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,540
the victims' cause of death are all the same. Would it really be just a coincidence?

140
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,830
That's why I'm afraid

141
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:48,420
that my dad might be wrong,

142
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,820
that there might be a secret I don't know of.

143
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,680
 The star should be at the very top. 

144
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,540
 There. Is that good? 

145
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,460
 Yes! 

146
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,720
Seriously?

147
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,610
Be careful. Be careful.

148
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,920
Hey, call me when you get home.

149
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,260
Driver, please take care of her.

You talk like you're my lover.

152
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,240
In my next life,

153
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,450
I'm going to date Dr. Hong for sure!

154
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:01,350
Please take care of her.

155
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:06,920
- Call me! 
 - I will.

156
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,810
 Here are the security camera files you asked for. 

157
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:21,850
 But why do you need these every time?

 Inability to express emotion 'Alexithymia' 
Alexithymia

169
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,660
Inability to express emotion.

170
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,300
Having no words to express one's soul.

171
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:09,710
 They are unable to feel sadness from the death of a pet, 

172
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:13,620
 and do not feel happiness from receiving a birthday gift. 

173
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,670
 Happiness and sadness, anger, remorse, attachment, anticipation, 

174
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:20,290
 excitement, and other words, 

175
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,980
 have no relation to them. 

176
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:28,220
 "happy", "love", "excited", "sad", "painful", "hurt",... 

177
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,090
 Do smart people underline to study words like that? 

178
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:34,250
 Who learns pain through studying? 

179
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,970
 Even if I bleed, I'm fine. It doesn't hurt. 

180
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:42,360
  For other people, it hurts. So you can't ever  

181
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,960
  hurt someone.  

182
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:54,730
What's the matter? Is there more for you to probe from me?

183
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:02,340
There's someone he called right before his death.

184
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:05,220
 Have you checked who this is? 

185
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,020
 I called them many times but they won't answer. 

186
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:12,180
We weren't able to find the identity at the time since it was a cloned phone.

187
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:16,150
Fortunately, that phone number

188
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:19,040
was detailedly left in the records from your organization.

189
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:24,890
It's right, isn't it? The phone number that you used?

190
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:33,350
Prosecutor, it's true that I used that number and that Kim Gab Yong picked up.

191
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,800
But I really didn't kill that woman.

192
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,470
What I want to know is not about the suitcase murder.

193
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:43,200
The word Kim Gab Yong said to you right before his death,

194
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,880
that's what I want to hear about.

195
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,360
 Damn it. 

196
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,970
 Who are you? 

197
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,810
 You, hurry straight to Pureum Care Home in Gangwondo right now. 

198
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:19,080
 Find the woman named Kim Song Hee and take her to a safe place. 

199
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,440
 Do as I say immediately! 

200
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:30,150
He suddenly told me to take this woman to a safe place that no one knows.

201
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,190
All I did was take that one phone call.

202
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,700
Where did you take this woman to?

203
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,710
 She had already disappeared when I arrived. 

204
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:42,350
 I didn't even get to see her face. 

205
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,180
Disappeared?

206
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:59,880
What was the last identity she used?

207
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,190
 Kim Song Hee. Her name was Kim Song Hee. 

208
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:10,420
 I need to leave for a while. Please take care of this patient. 

209
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:50,150
Hey, you. What's with you?

210
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,980
Ah, geez...

211
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,240
Are you crazy!

212
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,510
Did it hurt? Does it hurt? It hurts, right?

213
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,730
Of course, it hurts.

214
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:07,360
Ah, I'm glad, Hyung.

215
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,670
No, I said it hurts! Why is that relief, punk?

216
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,830
It hurt? It really hurts?

217
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:16,170
- Ah, my foot... 
 - Sorry, Hyung.

218
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:19,210
What makes us look like a couple?

219
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:21,990
It's not like I can put up posters announcing that we're brothers.

220
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,400
Tell me.

221
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,130
Why did you attack me all of a sudden?

222
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:30,200
I just wanted to check.

223
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,990
Just in case you had

224
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,160
alexithymia.

225
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,790
What?

226
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,520
Look,

227
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:45,330
if that's not even the case,

228
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:49,570
hurt, painful, happy. Why would you study these things, confusing me and all?

229
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,940
With this, did you really...

230
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:02,900
I saw you sitting down and studying with your mom.

231
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:08,670
She was so young and pretty.

232
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:14,250
  To. My beloved Seong Mo,
From, Mom 

233
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,620
It would've been nice if I could record what I see and show it to you,

234
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,800
or at least photograph it.

235
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:33,080
You miss her too, right? Your mom...

236
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,020
Yes, I envy your ability for the first time.

237
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:44,280
Seems like the training with Constable Yoon is going well.

238
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,150
You seeing me through this book...

239
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:48,360
I would've never imagined it.

240
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,620
You said I'm always beyond imagination.

241
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,540
I get taught one thing and learn ten from it.

242
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:55,110
Follow her around closely, since you have a lot to learn.

243
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:58,740
And don't forget to take her home.

244
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:02,020
What do you mean take her home, I always see her right in front of the security center.

245
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:05,050
Don't you know that a boyfriend should be responsible for his girlfriend's safety?

246
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:09,750
Ah, what girlfriend? I'm getting shy.

247
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,870
Hyung, I'm really in the mood today.

248
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:16,970
Want to sleep together? Or at least shower?

249
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:20,040
Are you crazy? Don't do that, it's disgusting.

250
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,720
- Just a little bit.
 - Ugh, gross! 
- Just ten minutes.

251
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,920
I'll be waiting.

252
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:35,960
 Just in case you had alexithymia. 

253
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:40,380
 I saw you sitting down and studying with your mom. 

254
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:52,290
I said I'm not sleeping with you.

255
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:55,250
I'll put this on your foot. Sit down.

256
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,850
You're really offering to help after you hurt me?

257
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,720
That must hurt.

258
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,540
It looks bad—

259
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:11,270
This...

260
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:15,290
didn't disappear yet.

261
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:18,030
I might have to live with it for the rest of my life.

262
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:22,030
A wound that misses the timing for treatment

263
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:24,330
turns into a scar.

264
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:28,630
They say a scar is proof of overcoming your pain.

265
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:33,550
Why does this still look painful?

266
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,250
It does hurt.

267
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,540
Even now.

268
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:43,660
Since the memories from then remain vividly.

269
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:54,650
Yoon Jae In said,

270
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:58,300
that she's like a baby chick that missed the timing to break out of its shell.

271
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:02,660
And so she wanted me to help her break it.

272
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:08,070
By any chance, are you the same?

273
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,780
I might be.

274
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:16,820
Though I don't know who stabbed me,

275
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,840
nor what happened to you,

276
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,830
the words your mother said,

277
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:25,490
don't forget them.

278
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,290
 What about killing? 

279
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:29,650
  You can never do that, ever. 

280
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:34,210
 Then, I would be very hurt. 

281
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:40,080
I'll find that guy for sure. Promise me that you'll wait.

282
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:50,180
The kid that always used to cry and whine about seeing strange things.

283
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,420
You've grown a lot.

284
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:56,100
Now you almost seem dependable.

285
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:07,730
 Money Demon 

286
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:11,950
Hello?

287
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,990
You want me to send money again? Am I an ATM or the Bank of Korea?

288
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:20,620
You said you'd never contact me after stamping the divorce papers.

289
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:23,850
 I'm already sending the school fees and living expenses exactly. 

290
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:28,100
 Sure. I understand that I'm your financial source, straw, and a fool but, 

291
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:31,780
if you're going to call me at dinnertime, at least ask me how I've been doing before bringing up money,

292
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:34,040
you shameless woman.

293
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,660
I'm hanging up.

294
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:43,820
You must not have gotten off work yet.

295
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:55,680
Is he announcing his dreadful situation?

296
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,950
I very much would like to eat some homemade food.

297
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:15,680
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by the 🙏🏼 Just One Touch 🙏🏼 Team at Viki   

298
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:23,830
Jae In, if she's going to go out,

299
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:28,520
she should at least tell me but

300
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,590
she went out after I prepared a meal and all.

301
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,230
It's not that I want to or anything, but

302
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:37,420
I just don't like to leave cold food leftover.

303
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,420
So let's eat together.

304
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:43,170
What is this awkward generosity?

305
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:46,970
Don't do this if it's for sympathy. It's something I very much hate.

306
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:49,410
Let's just say misery loves company.

307
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:53,960
If you're going to grumble,

308
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,740
why do just eat alone here?

309
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:59,280
You're worrying people.

310
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:12,150
What are you doing?

311
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:14,620
Eat while it's warm.

312
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:19,900
"Eat while it's warm." They sure are beautiful words.

313
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:29,050
Peek-a-boo! Hello!

314
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:33,000
Ahn wasn't at the library, did he go somewhere?

315
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,130
Is this a meeting place for you guys or something?

316
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:38,030
Don't you see it says closed at the door? Do you want an English dictionary?

317
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:40,650
So Hyun's still at work, right? Her car was outside.

318
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:44,730
You're right. Why isn't she off yet?

319
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:48,900
  Let's talk at the police station. Show me the surveillance footage! 

320
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:54,720
Mother, Yoon Joo was jumping on the tables today,

321
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,240
and hit her head on a corner as she fell.

322
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,900
So you're saying that my child lied?

323
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:05,680
Yoon Joo never went on the tables. She said that the teacher hit her!

324
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:10,580
Yoon Joo, is it because if you say you went on the tables

325
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,550
and hurt yourself, that your mother might scold you?

326
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:16,010
Are you threatening the child or what?

327
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:25,830
- Is your wrist okay? 
 - Why are you here again?

328
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:28,350
That's not what's important right now.

329
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:31,200
Should we call Jae In?

330
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,920
Why look for Constable Yoon when you have a veteran investigator here?

331
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,060
I've brought the files of the surveillance footage.

332
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:43,400
It must've been then.

333
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:49,520
It had to be the blind spot, of all places.

334
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:54,520
Of course, there's no way you'd openly beat her up.

335
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:58,420
So you beat her after figuring out where the camera doesn't reach?

336
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,960
You're an expert.

337
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,710
I knew as soon as I heard you raise your child alone.

338
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:07,020
An unmarried single mother?

339
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,520
Exactly how have you been behaving—

340
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,830
Ahjumma! What does that have to do with this?

341
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:17,560
Why doesn't it matter? I can see one and see it all.

342
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:21,030
I'm going to sue you for assault.

343
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:24,560
Mother, please look here for a moment.

344
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,850
The teacher runs towards the blind spot,

345
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:33,630
and the children look in that direction together in shock.

346
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:35,800
Seeing with my experiences from intuition,

347
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,440
I mean, my intuition from my experiences,

348
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,490
It's certain that the teacher ran after the incident occurred.

349
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:44,360
- That's just a speculation. 
 - Your's is a speculation too.

350
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,850
Why is it a speculation, when the kid said so?

351
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:52,320
I'm not done talking. Listen, please!

352
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,760
Though we can't see the entire view,

353
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:02,690
there's the sight of the child jumping on the table and misstepping towards her fall.

354
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:07,130
Now that I've shown you one thing, you can infer ten.

355
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:08,340
So the child  did  fall.

356
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,700
That's right, she did fall!

357
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,640
- Mom.
 - You, follow me!

358
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:18,540
I won't go on the tables again.

359
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:21,410
Shut up. Follow me!

360
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:23,130
Come.

361
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:25,940
Ahjumma, Ahjumma.

362
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:28,340
What do you want?

363
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:33,110
You want me to apologize? I guess I'm sorry.

364
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:38,980
Mom, Mom.

365
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:42,560
You can apologize properly next time.

366
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,640
Don't ever hit the child.

367
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:49,540
I know from being hit by all kinds of people,

368
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:53,310
and scars from being hit by parents hurt the most.

369
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,670
I'll deal with my child on my own.

370
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:58,410
Come!

371
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,700
The bodies of Kang Hee Sook and Park Soo Young, found on the lower Han River,

372
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,440
as the missing person due to a human trafficking organization from five years ago,

373
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:17,300
have been revealed to be murdered by the leader of the organization, Kim Gab Yong.

374
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,700
 Kim Gab Yong took advantage of the 

375
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,950
 homeless or without families and gained profit for years 

376
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:26,700
 by trafficking, kidnapping, and killing them. 

377
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,030
 Since he was found murdered two years ago, 

378
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:32,820
 the case will be turned over to the prosecution without an investigation. 

379
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,210
 The Special Investigation Unit of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, 

380
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:38,490
 raided Kim Gab Yong's organization 

381
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:42,420
 and found evidence proving that the organization gained profit through selling people's personal information. 

382
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:45,520
 Member Mr. Kim and twenty-five other members of the organization were arrested at the scene. 

383
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,750
 We look to further investigate 

384
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:52,040
 those who profitted by soliciting fake identities from this organization. 

385
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:55,810
It's that, right? The case of the suitcases found in the river of our neighborhood?

386
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:58,830
Yes, they're the bodies that Ahn and I found.

387
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:01,220
The suspect is Kim Gab Yong?

388
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:07,190
Yes, it's Kim Gab Yong, the leader of the organization that you swept and disintegrated.

389
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:08,950
You're here?

390
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:13,510
They really rounded up and arrested that organization?

391
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:16,610
They're not the type to leave evidence of their murder.

392
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:18,200
How did they discover that?

393
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,560
From what I heard, a credible testimony came up.

394
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,510
A testimony of the murder scene.

395
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:27,850
A very credible testimony.

396
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:29,770
Who gave that testimony?

397
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:32,120
We don't know about that.

398
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:39,500
The king has donkey's ears!

399
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,600
I saw the donkey's ears!

400
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,620
I saw it, I did! How would they have found it if it weren't for me?

401
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:47,950
I'm Korea's first psycho—, I can't say this out loud.

402
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:51,860
Stop before I arrest you for being a public nuisance.

403
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:54,600
I feel really strange right now.

404
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,340
Why? You think it's unfair?

405
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:00,000
Because it seems like Detective Eun is taking credit for your findings?

406
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,560
Nope. I feel amazing.

407
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:07,320
Because this a case one that you, me, Ji Soo Noona and Seong Mo Hyung worked together on.

408
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,930
Don't you think we're not far from a day when the four of us will get to investigate together?

409
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:13,720
Don't get too ahead of yourself.

410
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:18,930
But, your outfit seems strange today.

411
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:21,430
You don't have your hands in your pockets, either.

412
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:26,240
Since I pull off  hoodies and long-sleeved shirts so well,

413
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,460
I was thinking about pushing forward with that style,

414
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:33,110
but from now on, I'm trying to open up more.

415
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:36,830
It's a positive change. Let's go to the library, I'll pick out some books for you.

416
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:38,990
You don't have to pick a book today.

417
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:40,990
I already have a book I want to read.

418
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:43,350
A book you want to read?

419
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:45,550
Also, leave aside some time in the afternoon today.

420
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,520
What for?

421
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,740
Without thinking too deeply,

422
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:52,890
let's go out today.

423
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:14,150
  New Language Dictionary 

424
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,890
 miss 

425
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:35,250
 miss: to want to meet, 

426
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:37,620
 or to have a fond and desperate longing for. 

427
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:43,870
 Yes. Seong Mo, if I were to be unable to see you, 

428
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:46,220
 I'd miss you very much. 

429
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:51,020
 To want to see someone to the extent of feeling hurt, pain, and sadness, 

430
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,970
 that's what it's like to 'miss.' 

431
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:56,510
 They're all things that I can't feel. 

432
00:35:56,510 --> 00:36:00,900
 Don't worry. You'll be able to later on. 

433
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:05,670
 I won't let you become a monster 

434
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,650
 like that man. 

435
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:31,920
So you avoided me all morning, but you were here all along.

436
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,860
You looked real great on screen today.

437
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:38,290
Combining the detective briefing with your beauty is not fair.

438
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:40,280
Whoa.

439
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:44,090
Detective Eun, please forget my wrongdoings from the past.

440
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:46,390
The chief was worried so

441
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:48,210
I only participated in sharing information,

442
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:51,830
but that will never happen again.

443
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:54,720
So you're going to stop with your secret agent activities?

444
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,710
I thought about the potential for future development,

445
00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:02,640
and I realized that the latest weapon would be better than an old tank.

446
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,250
That's good.

447
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:08,530
Actually, I'm trying to specially recruit you as someone with experience.

448
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:10,650
Huh? What experience?

449
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:12,390
Experiences with being a secret agent.

450
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:16,200
From now on, keep an eye on Prosecutor Kang for me.

451
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,070
Huh? Prosecutor Kang?

452
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:21,640
Yes. Watch everything he does and report to me right away.

453
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,660
Understood?

454
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:26,550
He shouldn't be difficult, but why someone on the same side?

455
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:29,110
Since when did you take on jobs depending on the side?

456
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:31,950
You want to get a taste of the latest weapon?

457
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:34,240
Speaking of Kang Seong Mo's whereabouts,

458
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,670
I saw him go in the interrogation room with a member of the organization

459
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,580
A member of the organization?

460
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:42,060
- He interrogated that guy on his own? 
- Yes.

461
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:45,320
- What did they talk about? 
 - I'm not sure about that.

462
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:48,210
Where is he right now?

463
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:51,390
 What can we help you with? 

464
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:58,350

470
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:53,320
Don't tell me he'd be able to see me like this?

471
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:58,580
I wonder if he's studying well.

472
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:50,190
At this rate,

473
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:54,020
what if that kid and I really enter the Violent Crimes unit together?

00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,260
 I have plans, I'm going ou— Ouch! 

477
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:19,660
Oh my, what was that sound?

478
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:22,630
Jae In, what's the matter?

479
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,100
Did you fall over?

480
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,990
Yes.

481
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:34,080
It isn't easy to shower with your eyes closed.

482
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:37,300
Showering with your eyes closed? What for?

483
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,990
Someone might see.

484
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:41,800
Who would watch you shower?

485
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:47,300
Plus, if someone else is watching, why should you close your eyes?

486
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,590
There's a thing...

487
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,260
Are you hurt?

488
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,570
You got hurt showering with your eyes closed? In case I saw?

489
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:32,210
This isn't a laughing matter.

490
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:37,110
The more I have to help you grow, I didn't realize that I'd have to defend myself.

491
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:38,520
I don't usually see that much.

492
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:42,080
Don't worry. You can open your eyes and shower, change, and everything.

493
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,910
Who are you trying to fool?

494
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:47,300
I knew you wouldn't fall for it.

495
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:50,740
But where are we going?

496
00:41:54,940 --> 00:42:00,500
When I was younger, I got one as a gift,

497
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:03,080
but I lost it.

498
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:06,140
Really? What a coincidence.

499
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,710
Do you like my choice for today?

500
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:14,920
We can customize and make them our own according to our taste.

501
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,300
Do you want to try?

502
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:36,620
Don't copy mine and make yours on your own.

503
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:40,220
You're bothering me because you're too close.

504
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:43,820
Now you're eagerly look for an opportunity to touch me?

505
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,650
Let's do this separately.

506
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:49,810
I can't concentrate.

507
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:51,830
Where are you going?

508
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,360
Dirty Jae In.

509
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:08,130
I've been curious about something for a while.

510
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:11,280
How did Dae Bong find out about your ability?

511
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:14,990
Huh?

512
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:21,740
Just by chance.

513
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,740
It seems like there is something seeing that you're hiding it.

514
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:27,680
So quick-witted.

515
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:32,380
There was an accident. A horrifying accident.

516
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:34,240
What accident?

517
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:39,930
Roughly speaking... Accidental contact.

518
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:45,350
 It was at the height of my reputation as 

519
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:48,310
 Lee Ahn, the notorious legend of Honghak Middle School. 

520
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:50,420
 Let us see! Geez. 

521
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:53,460
 Hey.   

522
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:56,420
 It's fine.   

523
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:18,440
 Sorry, I know I really shouldn't touch you but...   

524
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:23,980
 You can beat me to death. I'm ready to die anyway.   

525
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:25,760
 Where are they?   

526
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:27,860
 What?   

527
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:31,480
 The rascals that said they'd let you in their squad if you did this crap.   

528
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:34,800
You're dead!

529
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,230
 Keep your head up.   

530
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:08,830
 Acting like that is what makes them look down on you and harass you.   

531
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:17,690
 But, how did you know it was them?   

532
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:21,850
 How did you know?   

533
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:42,430
 Then, I ended up seeing Dae Bong's secret.   

534
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,520
 Sorry.   

535
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:49,880
 Even though he had touched me twice, I just couldn't beat him.   

536
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:53,090
So Dae Bong had struggles too.

537
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:56,030
I didn't know because he always seemed bright.

538
00:46:56,030 --> 00:46:58,670
Well, everything is not what it seems.

539
00:46:58,670 --> 00:47:02,660
Dae Bong, that kid, he's the type to have no measures when he gets hooked onto something,

540
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:05,990
so he chased me around until he fell for So Hyun.

541
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:09,300
He'd touch me with no hesitation since I never hit him.

542
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:11,290
I guess So Hyun was your savior.

543
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:15,280
So, how did he find out about your abilities?

544
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:20,230
 Honghak Middle School 

545
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:28,490
 Hey. 

546
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:31,170
 If you get your money ripped off or something again, 

547
00:47:31,170 --> 00:47:36,160
 I won't let it slide like this time. Understood? 

548
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:42,000
 This punk. 

549
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:44,620
 Ahn! 

550
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:49,210
 Did you eat breakfast? Want to go to the store? 

551
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:08,510
 What's this? 

552
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:13,360
 What are you doing? You're not going to move? 

553
00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:18,630
Did you possibly—to Dae Bong's dad?

554
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:21,290
Would I really have gone all out?

555
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:27,490
I just scrapped the car that Dae Bong's father cherished more than his life.

556
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:30,030
I think even that is going all out.

557
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:32,450
I was almost sent to juvenile hall after that but...

558
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:34,420
 Seoul Eunpyeong Police Station 

559
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:42,850
 I'm going to end up spending all my paycheck on paying for your tofu. 

560
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:47,760
 What happened? 

561
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,930
 I heard it would be really difficult this time. 

562
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:52,380
 Thankfully your friend persuaded his dad. 

563
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:54,310
 What friend... 

564
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:57,180
 I don't have anything like that. 

565
00:48:57,180 --> 00:49:00,380
 Ahn! Hi! 

566
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:02,320
 Hi! 

567
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:06,240
 It was obvious how he took care of the situation.   

568
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,780
 He smiled in front of me with his face in a mess,   

569
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:15,460
and he seemed like a real friend.

570
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:20,000
So that's why you confessed about your abilities?

571
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,770
After that, you can imagine

572
00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:25,320
how much was glued to me, right?

573
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,630
I got caught in the end.

574
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:31,630
Well, you shouldn't have secrets from each other.

575
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:34,190
He's your first kiss.

576
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:36,890
That was accidental contact.

577
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:41,420
Still, thanks to your ability that you despised, you made a friend.

578
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:46,180
- Thanks to that ability, I have a girlfriend, too.
 - Hey!

579
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:49,600
Signal before coming in like that.

580
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:52,960
How do you say such cheesy words nonchalantly?

581
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,100
What else do I say?

582
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:57,590
You know today is 'day 1.'

583
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:03,590
What is he talking about?

584
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:07,370
What about you? What relationship do you have with So Hyun?

585
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:11,990
Seeing that you ran away from me but stayed in touch with So Hyun,

586
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:15,290
she seems to know about your secret.

587
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:19,160
So Hyun...

588
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:23,760
I mean, to be exact,

589
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:29,100
So Hyun's dad made a critical testimony for my dad as the criminal.

590
00:50:30,430 --> 00:50:35,060
But, it's not something to resent So Hyun about.

591
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:40,210
I see.

592
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:46,290
Since I want to spend the day having fun without thinking, let's stop talking about that.

593
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:52,410
Okay. Let's do so.

594
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:01,690
 Interrogation on record 

595
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:10,300
 I said I told everything I know to Prosecutor Kang yesterday. 

596
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,670
  Don't leave out anything and say it as it is, 

597
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:16,060
 what you said to Prosecutor Kang. 

598
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:18,790
 Where did you take the woman? 

599
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:22,980
  She had disappeared before I arrived. I didn't even get to see her face. 

600
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:25,080
  Disappear? 

601
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:38,620
  Then, what was the last fake identity she used? 

602
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:43,740
 Kim Song Hee.  Her name was Kim Song Hee. 

603
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:47,320
From the documents we confiscated from Dragon Head Hunting,

604
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:50,100
I found a copy of Kim Song Hee's identification.

605
00:51:50,830 --> 00:51:54,240
After being hospitalized at the Pureum Care Home as the employee mentioned,

606
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,570
it's true that she disappeared on the day.

607
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:58,780
After discovering such big news,

608
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:01,860
why didn't Prosecutor Kang mention it to us?

609
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:04,470
You think it's strange too, right?

610
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:06,790
Even after discovering that the woman changed her identity to Park Soo Young, Kang Hee Sook,

611
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:10,950
and to Kim Song Hee,

612
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:13,780
why did he have to keep it a secret from me?

613
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:17,700
By chance, does he want to solve the case alone,

614
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:19,870
to take all the credit?

615
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:24,390
How can you think like this?

616
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:27,920
 Dr. Hong 

617
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,130
 Detective Eun, can you come over right now? 

618
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:31,460
Now?

619
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:34,320
 Yes, immediately. 

620
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,460
 Report of Autopsy Results 

621
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:06,280
Here is the surveillance footage from Seoheun-dong for a week.

622
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:09,790
This neighborhood is quite quiet, so there aren't many surveillance cameras.

623
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:12,060
But why do you need it?

624
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:15,250
Please give me a map with the locations of the surveillance cameras as well.

625
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:16,760
Alright.

626
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:14,920
 Security Camera Recording 

627
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:11,090
 Security Centre 
Community Culture Centre 

628
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:06,550
 Isn't it pretty? 

629
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:09,480
 Pretty. Adjective.  

630
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:12,700
 To have a beautiful appearance appealing to the eye.  

631
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:16,170
 To have loveable and attractive actions.  

632
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:17,840
 You're saying that's what it's like?  

633
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:21,120
 To be pretty means, something like this? 

634
00:57:23,810 --> 00:57:25,810
 You smiled. 

635
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:53,360
What are you saying right now?

636
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:55,620
I know it sounds unbelievable.

637
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:57,290
But...

638
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:01,620
Look closely at this.

639
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:06,280
The sketch of the woman that lived with the identities of Kang Hee Sook and Park Soo Young,

640
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:11,060
don't you think she resembles Prosecutor Kang's mother, Kang Eun Joo?

641
00:58:11,850 --> 00:58:14,860
I felt iffy after speaking with you yesterday,

642
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:18,230
and looked into the autopsy reports from the Yeongseong Apartment case.

643
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:22,220
But as soon as I saw this photo,

644
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:25,480
I felt like I was hit in the head like the dead Kang Hee Sook.

645
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:32,070
But Prosecutor Kang's mother passed away from the Yeongseong Apartment fire.

646
00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:34,080
And for certain,

647
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:38,540
her body was found with the other corpses from the women's association.

648
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,570
Kang Eun Joo at the time,

649
00:58:42,570 --> 00:58:47,100
her face and hands were burned to the point of being unable to recognize her identity.

650
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:49,660
Thanks to finding her ID card in her pocket,

651
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:52,450
they skipped the DNA test.

652
00:58:56,390 --> 00:59:00,620
 The woman that lived as Kang Hee Sook and Park Soo Young, 

653
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:04,560
 I heard that Prosecutor Kang discovered that she had changed her identity again to Kim Song Hee. 

654
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:08,840
 But why he didn't tell you, 

655
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:11,080
 isn't it very strange? 

656
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:34,520
 Seoheun Patrol Division 
Seoheun Security Center 

657
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:37,850
They stopped the security cameras again,

658
00:59:37,850 --> 00:59:39,970
even the streetlight.

659
00:59:39,970 --> 00:59:41,360
What?

660
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:46,780
Someone keeps breaking the camera at the security center. It's already the third time this month.

661
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:49,390
What's the worry when you have a human security camera here?

662
00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:51,060
You can't compare a security camera to you.

663
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:53,080
Did I overestimate myself again?

664
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:54,880
No, the opposite.

665
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:59,070
You were already looking deeply into others' pain,

666
00:59:59,070 --> 01:00:03,720
I've been underestimating you.

667
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:06,590
You're really lifting my mood since the first date.

668
01:00:07,310 --> 01:00:10,850
The music box I made earlier, I left it in the backseat.

669
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:14,970
I worked hard to make it but I'm not sure if you'll like it.

670
01:00:14,970 --> 01:00:16,090
You're giving it to me?

671
01:00:16,090 --> 01:00:18,030
Weren't you making yours to give it to me?

672
01:00:18,030 --> 01:00:21,650
You barely showed me yours while you were making it earlier.

673
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:23,420
You're so quick-witted.

674
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:27,290
Your talent is definitely a waste to be left in the suburbs of the security center.

675
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:32,660
You'll like mine for sure. I put my heart and soul into it.

676
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:36,120
Still, don't be too impressed.

677
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:37,640
Here.

678
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:40,260
Thank you.

679
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,160
  Seoheun Patrol Divison 
 Seoheun Security Center 

680
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:22,870
He's got multitalented hands of gold.

681
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:47,770
 You like this one? 

682
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:51,470
 Yes!  My dad is really the best! 

683
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:11,790
Sleep with only good memories for today,

684
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:14,360
Yoon Jae In.

685
01:02:42,590 --> 01:02:44,300
Lee Ahn!

686
01:02:47,650 --> 01:02:49,770
The music box...

687
01:02:51,390 --> 01:02:53,470
You already saw it?

688
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:02,120
I don't know if it was like the one your dad gave you.

689
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:03,420
I only caught a glimpse of it.

690
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:06,730
It's exactly like the one that got broken.

691
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:10,060
Thank you so much.

692
01:03:31,730 --> 01:03:35,970
  Yoon Tae Ha, you are under arrest for suspicion of the Yeongseong Apartment arson. 

693
01:03:35,970 --> 01:03:37,090
 Take him. 

694
01:03:37,090 --> 01:03:39,560
 My dad isn't that kind of person! 

695
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:43,100
 My dad didn't kill anyone! 

696
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:45,790
 Dad! 

697
01:03:45,790 --> 01:03:51,150
 Dad! 

698
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:55,240
 My daughter's shoelaces are untied again. 

699
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:58,520
 I can't let my daughter fall. 

700
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:01,680
 I'll be back soon. Stay here, okay? 

701
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:02,790
 Dad! 

702
01:04:02,790 --> 01:04:06,240
 Dad will be done soon, don't worry! 

703
01:04:18,310 --> 01:04:20,030
You...

704
01:04:22,630 --> 01:04:24,600
Your father...

705
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:28,090
was Yoon Tae Ha?

706
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:34,290

 Prosecutor Kang Seong Mo! 

716
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:10,560
  I boasted that I'd protect her, 

717
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:13,650
 but I hurt her the most with these hands. 

718
01:05:13,650 --> 01:05:14,680
 Did you fight with Ahn? 

719
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:16,630
 What right do I have to help Ahn? 

720
01:05:16,630 --> 01:05:19,580
 There's no record of Kang Seong Mo's testimony here. 

721
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:23,220
 He's going to need some time, but he will be back soon.
   

722
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:24,230
 What is this? 

723
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:25,420
 Why did you do that? 

724
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:28,120
 You miss your mother, don't you? 

725
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:31,380
 Prosecutor Kang, I'll ask you for a favor. 

726
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:34,400
  It will all be revealed soon.
