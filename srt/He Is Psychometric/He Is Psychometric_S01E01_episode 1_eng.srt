 Yeongseong Apartment 

4
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,410
  Please Give Way For The Fire Trucks  

5
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:02,400
Mister, I already told you.

6
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,570
You can't pass these out without permission.

7
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:08,550
I keep telling the residents to stop blocking the way for fire trucks,

8
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:10,500
but nobody's cooperating.

9
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,740
You're telling the world that our complex has lousy parking?

10
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,860
I've done everything I can, checking the fire protection system,

11
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,800
but fire safety awareness is especially a mess.

12
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,500
A mess? What the— Who says it's a mess?

13
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,770
Ma'am, you can't turn a blind eye to the resident's safety.

14
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,690
You must be insane!

15
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,850
Mister, from today on, you are fired!

16
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:35,160
Excuse me?

17
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,710
- A puppy! A puppy! 
 - That's enough.

18
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,600
Mom, I want a puppy!

19
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,890
Lee Ahn, stop it.

20
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,050
I told you I wanted a puppy for my birthday!

21
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,080
I said that's enough!

22
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,810
Why can't I have one for my birthday?

23
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,330
- I want a puppy! 
 -Ta-da!

24
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,480
Your puppy's here!

25
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,740
Not this, but a real puppy!

26
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,610
One that really barks! I want one!

27
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,000
Just get him one already.

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,290
- Come here. 
 - What?

29
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,740
If we buy a puppy, are you going to clean up after it?

30
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,640
- No. 
 - I will.

31
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,760
- Will you feed it? 
 - I will. 
 - No. 
 - Take walks, baths, what about when its sick?

32
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,090
I'll do it all!

33
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,620
As if you'll do them all...

34
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:52,190
Ahn, why don't you think of a different present?

35
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:55,920
I'll give you anything you want, except for a puppy.

36
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:00,510
Then, I want a younger sibling.

37
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,910
Where did I put the number for the animal shelter?

38
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,070
Where is it?

39
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:24,350
What is it, mister? Do you have something to say to me?

40
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,560
What...

41
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,880
Ma'am? Oh my gosh! Oh, no!

42
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,700
What's going on?

43
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,940
I'll go get the elevator!

44
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,840
Why do you have that with you?

45
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,260
This one? We never know when bad guys show up.

46
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,930
I mean the other one.

47
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,900
- Are you satisfied now? 
 - I'm really happy.

48
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,860
What should I call my puppy?

49
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,810
  Please Give Way For The Fire Trucks  

50
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:34,720
What on earth?

51
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,180
- Are you okay? 
 - Yeah.

52
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,120
Hold on for a second.

53
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,560
-Why? 
 - What's going on?

54
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,550
Hello?

55
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,970
There are people stuck in the elevator. Is anyone out there?

56
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,800
Dad.

57
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,200
 - Fire! Fire! 

58
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,480
Fire! There's a fire!

59
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,300
It's a fire! Get out!

60
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,950
We're stuck in the elevator.

61
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,850
- Dad! 
 - Hello? Over here.

62
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:43,210
Student! There's a kid here, we have a kid here.

63
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:44,200
Take him with you.

64
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,790
What's going on? Are you alright?

65
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,790
- Yes. 
 - Get out. Take the stairs.

66
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,590
Hurry!

67
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,480
Hurry, hurry!

68
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,250
- Get him out of here. 
 - Mom.

69
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,600
Mom.

70
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,670
There you go.  I got you.

71
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,400
Thank you so much.

72
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,400
Mom! Dad!

73
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,960
We can't wait any longer.

  Psychometry, Greek 
 Psyche (soul) and Metron (measure)    

81
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,480
  He is Psychometric
- Episode 1 -   

82
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,810
What did you say? Psychometry?

83
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,950
Detective Eun, you weren't kidding?

84
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:13,300
There were no security cameras, and the water and ash made a mess.

85
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,130
We couldn't find any evidence, let alone a suspect.

86
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:18,840
I'm losing my mind here.  Would I feel like kidding?

87
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,560
So if this guy touches the corpse,

88
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:25,550
his psychometry or something, 
 will show him the suspect,

89
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,020
and this guy is in here?

90
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,500
He might not see the suspect, but he'll see something.

91
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,750
No, he has to

92
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,660
before Prosecutor Kang arrives.

93
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,740
Is this them?  Victims of the Hanmin Care Home fire.

94
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:40,900
Yeah, that's right.  The others were ruled dead by suffocation,

95
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,690
but these three women are the problem.

96
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:46,570
They all have a deep stab wound in their right abdomen.

97
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:51,620
The fire was set after they were stabbed. Well?

98
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,150
Can you do it?

99
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,700
Of course. 
   NISI 

100
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,740
  A room filled with fire and smoke.    

101
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,380
  We know they were killed before the arson.    

102
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,890
  So this fact means nothing.    

103
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:40,180
  I need a conclusive clue.    

104
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,230
  Who is it? The victim? 

105
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:00,420
  Or is it the perpetrator?    

106
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,200
  Yoo Eun Ok    

107
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,700
  Please! More details! 
 Hanmin Care Home    

108
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:29,630
What was that? Numbers?

109
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,510
Right before their death, the victims all saw some numbers.

110
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,450
Numbers? What kind of numbers?

111
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,580
80B

112
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,890
75A

113
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:58,680
85C.

114
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,530
80B,

115
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,670
75A,

116
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,280
- What? 
  - 85C.

117
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,520
85C.

118
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,070
They're all number-letter combinations.

119
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,530
There's a pattern. What are they?

120
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:14,240
Patient numbers?

121
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,250
I don't think so.

122
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,870
It could be a dying message.

123
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:24,480
What if the suspect set the fire  to destroy the dying message?

124
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,610
We must find out what those numbers mean.

125
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,810
That's all I saw.

126
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:37,630
The meaning of those numbers is for you to find out.

127
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,550
Well? Isn't this good enough to make me

128
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:44,940
the psychometrist for the Special Investigation Unit?

129
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,240
85C?

130
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,640
Aren't these...

131
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,220
- What? Do you have an idea? 
 - Lee Ahn, you...

132
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:56,250
To be honest, I didn't get what "with great power comes great responsibility" meant.

133
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:00,040
I just considered this skill a nuisance.

134
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:06,180
But to think that such a day comes where I put it to use.

135
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:12,330
Hey. Do you even know what you just saw?

136
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,520
Hm?

137
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,650
Yoo Eun Ok, size 75A This is what I saw?

138
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:25,850
Yes. 80B. 75A. 85C.

139
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:29,030
The victim's underwear we found at the scene.

140
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,350
No way.

141
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:36,010
Why did I see those numbers of all things?

142
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:38,290
That's what I'd like to ask you.

143
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,980
Come here. I'll kill you.

144
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:45,340
Wait.  This might not be a clue, but I saw a woman.

145
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,040
Right! She wore a ring.

146
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,060
None of the female corpses had a ring.

147
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,360
If she's not a victim then she's the perpetrator.

148
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,710
The perpetrator? Yeah, right.

149
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:58,330
Are you trying to scam me, too?  Come here!

150
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:02,410
 Dr. Hong, this is Kang Seong Mo. 

151
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:15,030
 Dr. Hong? 

152
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:20,930
- What now? 
 - What? You said great responsibility comes with great power.

153
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:23,870
Tell him what you saw. Be confident.

154
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:26,970
You're the one who called me for help in the first place.

155
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:29,970
- I won't go down alone. 
 - You little...

156
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,090
Dr. Hong.

157
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,880
- Hide for now. 
 - There's nowhere to hide.

158
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,230
Figure it out yourself!

159
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,410
You came.

160
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,620
The culprit is such a psychopath.

161
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,710
Why couldn't he just end with killing

162
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,880
instead of setting the place on fire after?

163
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,790
It seems like the typical behavior of a culprit who wishes to conceal the truth.

164
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:02,740
Exactly! What a total psycho.

165
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,790
Not the culprit, I meant you.

166
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:11,160
You're extremely overreacting right now.

167
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:18,000
You're strangely avoiding my eyes as well.

168
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,550
That's because...

169
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:24,040
 This case is a perfect copycat of the Yeongseong Apartment case 11 years ago. 

170
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,340
 It bothers me. 

171
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,740
Gosh, how annoying.

172
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:35,180
I'm the victim of that case, so why are you bothered?

173
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,180
Yeongseong Apartment?

174
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:40,290
 I'm being considerate of you. Don't you get it? 

175
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:42,020
 I'll keep that in mind. 

176
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,100
 If you really are being considerate of me, 

177
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,490
Stop telling me speculative stories,

178
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:49,560
like a copycat, real culprit, and coincidence.

179
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,030
Show me something real.

180
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,810
Something real?

181
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:57,610
You two paid a visit to the site already,

182
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:59,830
and came to this autopsy room,

183
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:03,100
without answering any of my calls.

184
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,600
It means you had a very important reason.

185
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:10,440
Did you find anything from the bodies?

186
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,720
Ah. Well, that's...

187
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,590
We found the victims' undergarments lying around the site.

188
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:19,020
We were talking about it just now.

189
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,830
- Right? 
 - Yeah...

190
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:24,410
R-R-Right.

191
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,420
Any special meaning to their undergarments?

192
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:31,610
We wanted to figure it out.

193
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:35,510
What about you? Did you find anything?

194
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,010
Ah, nothing special.

195
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,620
See? You didn't find anything either.

196
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:42,210
So why did you call me so much?

197
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:44,790
I found a witness.

198
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:47,040
A witness?

199
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,090
Someone who witnessed the murder scene?

200
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,020
Is the culprit a woman with a ring on her finger?

201
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,460
Or is it the witness?

202
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,910
It's a man.

203
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:55,920
Ahhh...

204
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,280
I see. A man...

205
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,890
We should go see him first then.

206
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,490
Let's go quickly.

207
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:06,260
- All right. 
 - Let's go.

208
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,150
What?

209
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,440
 Prosecutor Kang. 

210
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,130
Let me check something real quick.

211
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:23,540
 Prosecutor Kang. Prosecutor Kang, hold on. 

212
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,690
 Prosecutor Kang! 

213
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:34,190
Hi, Hyung.

214
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:37,590
Didn't I tell you to stay away from this place?

215
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:40,440
Today isn't a waste though.

216
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,240
A ring... A woman with a ring on her finger was on the site.

217
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,840
But the witness didn't say anything about it.

218
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,280
Well, that's sad to hear.

219
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:55,740
A stabbed corpse, a corpse in pieces, or a drowned corpse—which is your type?

220
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,370
What? Why do you ask?

221
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:04,590
If your ability isn't the worst, you'll get to see one soon.

222
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:09,230
I hope you show your ability.

223
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:13,230
Hyung! Hyung! Wait, Hyung!

224
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,250
Wait...

225
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:27,600
No, no. Please.

226
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,620
No, no, no.

227
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,620
I'm sorry, Seong Mo!

228
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:50,290
Don't call my name!

229
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,310
 Let me out! 

230
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:01,980
So you were there when the fire broke out in Hanmin Care Home?

231
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:06,730
Yes, I'm an insurance consultant.

232
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:11,610
I needed to get some information from my client in Room 702 before going to work, so I was on my way there.

233
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,460
 Excuse me! Anyone there? 

234
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,340
 What's going on? 

235
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,750
 Someone set a fire. Over there! 

236
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,350
 Hurry out! 

237
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:52,900
 911? This is the Hanmin Care Home.   

238
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:57,110
 - Ma'am, there's something more. 
 - Yes? 
 - She killed people too. 

239
00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:02,890
Then why did you wait two hours after the accident to say so?

240
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:09,780
I thought...  other people had already reported.

241
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,150
You hurt your leg?

242
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:21,720
I was in a rush to get out. Actually, I felt so sorry and guilty that I evacuated alone,

243
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,320
so I couldn't report it sooner.

244
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,420
I am truly sorry.

245
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:34,290
The suspect is Song Hee Jung, 57 years old.  She was hospitalized three months ago due to depression.

246
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:41,320
According to the nurse in charge, she often threatened other patients that she'd kill everyone.

247
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:47,790
The day before the accident, the hospital gave her notice to leave because she couldn't pay the hospital bill.

248
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:53,760
It is assumed that the suspect made the worst of the situation—that she murdered the victims,

249
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,910
injured herself, then committed arson.

250
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,740
How are public opinions?

251
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:11,250
Rather than the murder or arson, they are mostly criticizing the poor fire system.

252
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:14,260
That's always brought up in every fire case.

253
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:18,510
Lets quickly make the official briefing before the reporters spew any more nonsense.

254
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,170
Yes.

255
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:25,360
It was nice to find the witness early. The prosecution and police won't be criticized.

256
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:30,090
With the Special Investigation Unit, it only took two hours for the case to close.

257
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:32,080
Isn't that too fast Prosecutor Kang?

258
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,960
Ah, well, I was lucky.

259
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,490
Do you two know each other?

260
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:41,690
I've known her for a long time.

261
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:46,220
Is Detective Eun your daughter?

262
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,820
Yes, she still has a lot to learn.

263
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,110
Who's going to make the official announcement then?

264
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,730
Excuse me.

265
00:24:55,070 --> 00:25:00,100
Prosecutor Kang did all the work. It would be inappropriate for us to do it.

266
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:05,150
We do have the witness, but I think it's too soon for an official briefing.

267
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:10,140
Why don't we check his reliability first before and do it afterwards?

268
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,930
Is anything bothering you?

269
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:15,120
- I need to look into something more. 
 - So what is it?

270
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,320
Well, it's not certain enough to share with you yet.

271
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:30,030
Detective Eun. If you turn the tide you better have something more certain than the testimony. You can't stop the briefing headfirst.

272
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:35,960
The testimony isn't enough. I don't want this case to end like the Yeongseong Apartment case.

273
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,430
Why are you bringing that up here?

274
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:41,930
Detective Eun.

275
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,560
The two cases are too similar.

276
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,340
The victims are a group of women.

277
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:51,190
And a fire was lit to cover up the murder.

278
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:55,170
I'm sure you all know this, but the suspect back then never confessed.

279
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:58,160
It's why people are saying that the real killer is back.

280
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,500
- Didn't you check the public opinion first too? 
 - Detective Eun.

281
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,430
What do you mean 'the real killer?

282
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:06,560
Are you saying that your father did a lousy job on the case eleven years ago?

283
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:15,150
Prosecutor Kang, let's get ready for the briefing.

284
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,710
I'm just saying that we should be sure.

285
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:26,930
The suspect's clothes were full of the victims' blood.

286
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:29,250
What more evidence do you need?

287
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:32,100
 The fire which took place on October 3, 2016 around 6 AM,   

288
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,000
 in Room 701 of Hanmin Care Home was revealed to be a case   

289
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,540
 of a depressed patient killing    

290
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:41,070
  the other two patients sharing her room.   

291
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:45,210
  She hurt herself afterwards and then started the fire in the nursing home.    

292
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:49,070
 The tragic incident, which resulted in sixty-eight casualties, 

293
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:54,490
  could've been prevented had fire regulations been followed.    

294
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:56,980
  Dementia or stroke patients... 

295
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:05,690
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by the 🙏🏼 Just One Touch 🙏🏼 Team at Viki 

296
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,430
Shut up.

297
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:16,040
Jae In, over here! Hurry!

298
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,510
Come. Goodness.

299
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,260
Was anyone following you?

300
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,290
Goodness, we weren't born yesterday you know.

301
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:29,870
Must you do this every time though?

302
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:32,530
- Please drive. 
 - Yes.

303
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:38,790
Auntie, go here.

304
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,530
Where?

305
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:44,460
I see you already found yourself a place to live.

306
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:48,750
That's not all. I already found a school and part-time job, too.

307
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:53,110
Right. Well, you're such a veteran now.

308
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,400
Where's my stuff?

309
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,140
Here you go.

310
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:05,530
- Over there, please. 
 - Okay, yes.

311
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:07,510
You're leaving?

312
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:53,420
You! Stop right there!

313
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,000
 When I heard that you caught the killer of the fire case,   

314
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,950
 I thought you had scored big time.   

315
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:13,920
 But what? You saw women's underwear sizes?   

316
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:19,370
Hey. I still made it into the autopsy room and actually read something.

317
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:22,740
"Though the beginning seems humble, the future will be prosperous."

318
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:27,450
You didn't know? That is...

319
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:32,090
A famous guy named Genesis said it.

320
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:33,950
What do you know anyway?

321
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:53,920
Ahh, that perverted jerk.

322
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,610
Why are those the only things I see clearly?

323
00:30:56,610 --> 00:31:02,490
 So what if you're psychometric? All you can see are the sizes of underwear.   

324
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:06,480
 What my grandma said is right. A fly only sees dung.   

325
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,080
That's because you don't know better.

326
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,590
You see, it's all about gradually seeing a little more.

327
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:17,020
What's the fun in seeing the whole picture at first?

328
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:22,250
  You're always such a talker. So what did Prosecutor Kang say?   

329
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:24,880
What do you think? I just ran out of there.

330
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,810
It's a heavy crime having snuck in to see it. But on top of that,

331
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:31,730
you want me to say that I saw underwear?

332
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:35,880
  I feel terrible for him. He's stuck with you for an adoptive brother.     

333
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,730
Hey! What?

334
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:42,830
Hey, I'm really going to see something clearly this time.

335
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:45,530
 - Sure. I wonder what you'll see next time.  
 - You want to die?

336
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:47,690
Do  you  want to die?

337
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:51,460
 Hello? You there? 

338
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:54,110
- Is it fun to peek at girls undressing?
- Hold on.

339
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:56,140
 Are you sulking?   

340
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,260
Me? What are you accusing me of?

341
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:01,620
 That's because you don't know better.  

342
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:05,120
 You see, it's all about gradually seeing a little more. 

343
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,600
 What's the fun in seeing the whole picture at first? 

344
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,780
You've clearly confessed with nowhere to turn, don't you think?

345
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,950
I think there's a misunderstanding.

346
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:16,590
 It's a heavy crime having snuck in to see it. But then on top of that, 

347
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:19,110
 you want me to say I saw underwear? 

348
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:23,970
 Hey, I'm really going to see something clearly this time. 

349
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:26,460
Wow, this is insane.

350
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:35,740
Ahhh! You— That, that—

351
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:39,570
I wasn't the one that peeped at you in the washroom.

352
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:42,510
I never said it was in the restroom.

353
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:47,750
- Huh? 
 - This psycho pervert jerk!

354
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:12,650
Ya!

355
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:14,480
Pervert! Where do you think you're touching?

356
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,220
N-No, this isn't—

357
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:21,510
Really. I really didn't.

358
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:24,690
Ah, no, no, no... It really wasn't me.

359
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:27,130
 Seoul Do Hyeon Police Station 

360
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:31,770
Sir! Teacher! Hyung!

361
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:33,400
Hey, be quiet.

362
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,420
It really wasn't me!

363
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:38,000
This is crazy!

364
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,730
I'm going insane, seriously!

365
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:43,350
Are we done?

366
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,250
You have firm evidence.

367
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:49,880
A perfect complaint that I'd want to use as an example. Missy, you're sharp.

368
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,060
I had no idea I'd be using my essay exam skills here.

369
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,870
- You're a senior in high school? 
 - Yes.

370
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:58,380
There could be hidden cameras inside the restroom. So, please do a thorough site investigation.

371
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,730
Please text me your progress.

372
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:04,380
I can't answer phone calls during class. Alright then.

373
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:07,730
Wait! Hey, where are you going?

374
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:09,320
Hey! Where are you going?

375
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,290
Hey! Stop right there! I'll get you when I catch you!

376
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:16,560
I remember your face. I'll get you when I catch you!

377
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,880
Ouch.

378
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,910
Ahjussi! Ahjussi! You can't just hear one side of the story.

379
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:27,330
How can you put an innocent high schooler behind bars like this? Huh?

380
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:29,230
Hey! Hey!

381
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:33,360
Hey, you're Lee Ahn, right?

382
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,790
Ah, no, no, I'm not.

383
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:44,140
- Do you know him? 
 - You're no cop if you don't know him in that area.

384
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:54,210
 Legendary Lee Ahn from Hong Ak High School. 

385
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:59,790
 I thought he was either in juvenile hall or dead but he turns out to be an innocent high school pervert. 

386
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:01,770
 What a turn of events. 

387
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:12,920
Is he notorious? What do we do then? This is getting out of hand.

388
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,920
Don't you know I have it when things get out of hand? Call Detective Eun Ji Soo at Joongang Station.

389
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,930
Detective Eun Ji Soo?

390
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:23,080
No way! Just put me in jail instead!

391
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,520
Please! Just this once!

392
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,720
I got hit. I got hit.

393
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,770
Hey, where is my gun?

394
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:36,170
So embarrassing...

395
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:39,420
Whoa, walking down memory lane.

396
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,170
Here.

397
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:46,200
- Noona, that's not it—
 - Of all things, now a women's restroom?

398
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:50,460
I said it wasn't me! Do I really look like a perverted loser peeping in women's restrooms?

399
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:55,050
Yes, you do. 85C, 80B, 75A.

400
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:57,480
Unforgettable numbers, huh?

401
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:01,280
They're just numbers.

402
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,000
- You didn't tell Hyung, did you? 
 - What do you think?

403
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,280
Erase everything that happened here from your memory. Okay? Delete, delete.

404
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,060
What's the point of erasing from my memory?

405
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:13,860
How about all the details and specifics written in that complaint?

406
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:19,380
I can also— say that I didn't do it in details and whatnot.

407
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,230
Wait a moment.

408
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:24,580
Do you even know what I meant by "details and specifics?"

409
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:27,580
Wow. I'm not going to say it. I'm offended.

410
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:31,270
Don't think I'm not saying it because I don't know what it means.

411
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:36,430
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by the 🙏🏼 Just One Touch 🙏🏼 Team at Viki 

412
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:39,710
Can't believe I took that punk to an autopsy lab.

413
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,400
What law?

414
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,410
 The Special Act for the Punishment of Sexual Abuse. 

415
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:49,000
 Entering a public area to sexually abuse could land you in prison with a criminal record. 

416
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:55,300
Hey, you might just run into your brother in the courtroom, as prosecutor and defendant.

417
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,150
Criminal record?

418
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:02,290
You're a thorn in his side as is and now a sexual harassment charge?

419
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:05,670
Never mind. It's actually better this way.

420
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:11,050
If you have a conscience, as a criminal, you wouldn't try to help me, or talk about being Korea's first psychometrist.

421
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:14,280
What do you mean? You're the one who told me to be a psychometrist.

422
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:18,380
Hey, that's because I want you to do something with your life since all you do is get in trouble.

423
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:22,680
I said it to encourage you to have a dream. I had no idea you'd bite the bait.

424
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:27,350
So, I'm saying, I want to fulfill my dream. Why aren't you cooperating?

425
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:30,330
How much more can I cooperate with you?

426
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:33,750
I even took you to the autopsy lab without Prosecutor Kang's knowledge.

427
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:37,080
You should've told me it was a Yeongseong Apartment copycat.

428
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:41,020
Had I known, I would've been more serious about the case.

429
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,630
If you rattled off bra sizes more seriously, you'd have felt more ashamed.

430
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,950
Geez, seriously.

431
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:53,260
Anyway, don't let this get out of hand. Discuss it with Prosecutor Kang.

432
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,570
Or else you might really end up in jail as a pervert.

433
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:58,210
I'll take care of it myself. Why get Hyung involved in this?

434
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:00,320
How would you?

435
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:05,030
Why can't I take care of it myself? When I have this?

436
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:11,440
Geez, yes, yes, yes. You're all talk.

437
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:22,010
Is that the same guy?

438
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:26,050
Yes, he was taped jumping the fence the night before the exam.

439
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:29,310
He suddenly ranked 15th in the school from ranking last place.

440
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:34,470
I'm sure he broke into the teachers' office the night before the midterm.

441
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:38,490
When we noticed that lock on the teachers room door was broken,

442
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:41,920
I told you that it looked like someone had broken in.

443
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,720
You're the one who said to let it slide, saying it's not a big deal, Ms. Jung.

444
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,080
- I did?
 - Yes.

445
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:52,690
He got into fights five times,

446
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:59,110
and tardy, early-leave, absences are... 70 days?

447
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:01,960
He's bound to be expelled for being a son-of-a—

448
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,420
For being bad.

449
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:09,330
He's a troublemaker.

450
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:16,100
The cancerous cells aren't considered a lifeform. Just cut him off.

451
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,620
What is all that?

452
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,460
He's here.

453
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,240
That punk.

454
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,390
- Eating alone? 
 - Want some?

455
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:56,470
Weren't you on your way to school earlier? Why are you so late?

456
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:58,810
Something happened.

457
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:01,790
In any case, I'm in big trouble.

458
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:05,290
Don't even talk about it if it's not worse than going to prison for being a pervert.

459
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:10,460
- What the heck is that? Of course, it's much bigger deal than that.
 - What is it?

460
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:15,440
My dear So Hyeon... finally broke up with her boyfriend.

461
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:19,260
She finally saw me for who I am.

462
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:22,860
What if she confesses her love for me today? I'm not ready.

463
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:25,320
So did she say she likes you?

464
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:29,250
As she was going home she glanced at me.

465
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:34,660
She also glanced at Lee Soon Shin's statue, too.

466
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:40,450
Hey, do your psychometric thing on her.

467
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:43,250
Though I'm sure I'm the only one she thinks about.

468
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:47,480
I don't think so. I think General Lee Soon Shin's much more interesting.

469
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:50,590
Oh, right. The math teacher was looking for you.

470
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:53,190
I think you should run. You should run faster!

471
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:56,600
It's refreshing to see someone transferring in senior year.

472
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,290
I look forward to your care.

473
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,220
I have to to say that to you.

474
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:07,040
You're the top student who wants to attend Seoul University. You'll do well on your own.

475
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,250
Future goal—lawyer, prosecutor,

476
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:12,590
judge?

477
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:15,800
Is your family involved in that area?

478
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,030
Well...

479
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:21,800
But why did you transfer so many times without any disciplinary actions?

480
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,960
I just want to study quietly.

481
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,750
Hey pretty. This school is for those who don't want to study.

482
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:28,830
All the losers—

483
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:29,810
Where's that boy?

484
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:32,270
You scared me. He should be here soon.

485
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:34,230
But are you sure about this?

486
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:38,000
Even if it wasn't today's incident he was going to be expelled.

487
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,290
There's a student here and you need to be careful.

488
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:44,920
And I don't see your family information here.

489
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,680
Are there schools where they still write these things?

490
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,330
Huh?

491
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:56,190
Parent's education level, career, housing information...

492
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,460
Gosh, even their salaries?

493
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:01,150
The family information gives students an inferiority complex,

494
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:05,270
and it becomes the starting point of prejudice.

495
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,730
It doesn't matter to me,

496
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:13,550
but if something like this goes on the internet then this can cause headaches for you.

497
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:16,990
That's right. I suggested not to do this many times,

498
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:19,460
but they don't listen to me at all.

499
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:22,730
Should we walk to the class together when the bell rings? Wait just a minute.

500
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:24,020
Do you want to sit here and wait?

501
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:26,920
I'd like to go to the restroom before class starts.

502
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,830
Go and come back.

503
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,420
You're so pretty.

504
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:25,870
 You don't know it. 

505
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:28,640
 You see, it's all about gradually seeing a little more. 

506
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,750
 It's a heavy crime having snuck in to see it. But on top of that, 

507
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:33,320
 you want me to say that I saw underwear? 

508
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:51,750
Who's the math teacher?

509
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:56,690
Was it him?

510
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:58,460
Or was it her?

511
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:02,450
It's a man. Over there with 2:8 ratio hair.

512
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:04,960
Ah, 2:8?

513
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,830
Who are you? Why are you here?

514
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:10,250
You got out pretty quickly. Was it your first offense?

515
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:12,330
You go right now and cancel the charges.

516
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:14,840
If not, then I'll countercharge against you for defamation.

517
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,270
Where is the clip I just filmed?

518
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:19,750
Where's the broadcasting studio?

519
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:23,330
Ah, this is the studio.

520
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:25,150
Geez...

521
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:27,560
I know that the situation was easy for you to misunderstand.

522
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:31,380
But what I saw was not what you're thinking.

523
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:36,080
That was... I don't know how to explain but...

524
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,280
- That was...
- You follow me.

525
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,480
- You follow me.
- Teacher.

526
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,430
Teacher, Teacher, Teacher.

527
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:44,900
Look at him. You did something wrong and you were even late.

528
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:46,200
It really isn't it.

529
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:49,310
I don't know what she said to you but

530
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:51,060
I'm  really  innocent.

531
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:53,420
Innocent?

532
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:55,990
I have evidence and you say you're innocent?

533
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:57,620
What is this?

534
00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:00,660
Top 15th place... Wow, he's genius.

535
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:02,860
Who's this? Oh!

536
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:05,040
Lee Ahn?

537
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:06,810
Is this mine?

538
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:11,260
Right? It doesn't even make sense to you, either. Right?

539
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:30,190
 You copied every subject from the person in front of you? 

540
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:32,480
I was just practicing...

541
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:37,120
is... not how it happened but he didn't cover his tests.

542
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:40,590
I'm not sure if his brain is transparent or my eyes are super good.

543
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:43,090
What did you do in the early morning of Sept. 25th?

544
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:44,050
September 25th?

545
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:48,910
The day before the mid-term! Sunday, to be precise at 5:30 a.m.

546
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:50,810
I must've been in bed if it was early Sunday morning.

547
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:52,460
You bastard—

548
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:57,310
We have CCTV footage of you jumping the school wall.

549
00:45:57,310 --> 00:45:57,990
Ah, that day?

550
00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:02,560
You came into the office and got into computers to get mid-terms, right?

551
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:07,010
I just didn't want to deal with packed bus in the morning so I came to school early.

552
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:10,460
I came to school and realized that it was Sunday.

553
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:13,500
So I went back home, flabbergasted.

554
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:14,950
You didn't know it was Sunday so you came to school?

555
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:17,460
Saying I wouldn't be able to graduate if I missed school again,

556
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:21,380
she told me over and over again so

557
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:23,990
I'm overly sensitive.

558
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:27,960
So on Sunday morning at 5:30 a.m., you came to school automatically, huh?

559
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:31,070
I'm telling you again that I hate packed buses.

560
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:35,430
But is today a false charge day?

561
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:38,630
- If not, is it a hidden camera?
- Hey!

562
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:43,390
You bastard, are you playing with me right now?

563
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:47,180
Because of someone like you the whole school is being criticized.

564
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:49,850
Teachers and students who work hard,

565
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:52,180
are being labeled as a bad teachers and

566
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:54,760
bad students, because of someone like you.

567
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,900
You bastard.

568
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:00,260
You go and bring your parents right now.

569
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:04,930
I'll be considerate of your future so I'll just have you drop out.

570
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:07,450
My parents passed away.

571
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:13,990
But the important point isn't that.

572
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:16,250
Whether expelled or drop out,

573
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:22,490
there's no other school to go to, is the point.

574
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:28,930
I thought you were pathetic so are you an orphan?

575
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:33,100
That's not the point.

576
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:40,180
My older brother told me to graduate from high school no matter what.

577
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:41,700
He ordered me to do that.

578
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,580
You're annoying me now so get out.

579
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:46,450
- Then we'll just expel him from school, right?
- Yes.

580
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:51,730
The graduation is really close so you can suspend me but hold off on expulsion.

581
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:53,780
I'll do 500 hours of volunteer work.

582
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:55,360
I said to get out!

583
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,710
Teacher!

584
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,320
Look at this bastard.

585
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,490
Looks like you'll hit me, huh?

586
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:05,950
Look down. Looks like you'll hit me.

587
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:07,510
Teacher!

588
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:09,090
- Teacher, you can't do this.
- Let me go!

589
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:12,290
You can't do this, really! You really can't do this!

590
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:16,060
We only have a minute left before the morning assembly.

591
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:18,790
So what? Do you have business with him?

592
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:23,090
No, I just want to borrow a cigarette.

593
00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:24,790
I don't smoke.

594
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:30,230
Don't you have some that you took from students?

595
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:32,690
Dang, take it then!

596
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:35,620
Which one? Korean brand or foreign brand?

597
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:38,460
- Korean brand.
- Korean brand? This one!

598
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:46,520
Okay guys! Morning greeting is late. Go back to your seats.

599
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:52,240
We have a transfer.

600
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:55,760
Yeah, no one's interested, right?

601
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,790
Just go and find an empty seat.

602
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:03,060
Where's Lee Ahn?

603
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:06,730
- Excuse me?
- He didn't come back from the teacher's office yet.

604
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:10,760
Right. Prepare for the lesson—

605
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:12,960
Or forget it.

606
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:42,780
 My Brother, Seong Mo.   

607
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:49,080
He saved your life,

608
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:53,610
so the least you can do for him is not to cause any harm.

609
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:02,050
No help at all.

610
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,210
Did you survive alone

611
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:09,020
just to live like this?

612
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:14,900
It's gym class next period.

613
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:17,010
Wear this, transfer student.

614
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:21,390
Kim... So Hyun?

615
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:27,050
You... remember me?

616
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:35,410
It's you, right?

617
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:38,430
I figured you were suspicious when you transferred here at the end of senior year.

618
00:50:38,430 --> 00:50:39,950
It's her for sure.

619
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:42,390
What's suspicious?

620
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:44,680
You.

621
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:53,140
Yoon Kyung Hoon who's running for the district commissioner is your dad, right?

622
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:58,000
I heard everyone moved from Gangnam to this district. You're the one, right?

623
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,670
I understand that you want to know my information but let's do it slowly.

624
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:04,570
Slowly.

625
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:24,610
 I hate seeing how shameless she is. 

626
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:46,250

00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:22,310
 I'll rescue your mom, dad, and 

634
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:24,580
 all your neighbors. 

635
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:26,430
 You can trust me, right? 

636
00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:27,990
 I'll lift you. 

637
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:29,830
 Mom! 

638
00:52:29,830 --> 00:52:32,790
 Mom. 

639
00:52:32,790 --> 00:52:34,270
 Be careful! 

640
00:52:34,270 --> 00:52:36,960
 Careful! 

641
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,040
 Thank you! 

642
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:44,040
 Mom! Dad! 

643
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:48,780
 Just wait here a little bit, okay? I'll go save your mom and dad. 

644
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:55,770
♫  I won't work with you always all the time  ♫

645
00:52:57,050 --> 00:53:04,240
♫  And let me be down to guide your way  ♫

646
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:09,020
 It turns out to the hero, Yoon Tae Ha's self-fabricated scenario. 

647
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:13,220
We'll start the parole review for number 3145.

648
00:53:28,090 --> 00:53:32,690
But you know, Lee Ahn. What exactly can he see?

649
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:37,170
According to Ahn, the strong memories possessed by people or objects.

650
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:38,910
I don't understand.

651
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:40,890
You seem to know exactly what it is.

652
00:53:40,890 --> 00:53:44,480
The answer is the fact that you don't understand.

653
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:50,380
To be honest, it bothers me what Ahn saw in an autopsy room.

654
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:56,400
It's not going to be the bra sizes. You mean the woman wearing the silver ring?

655
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,670
You heard everything from Dr. Hong, right?

656
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:05,970
Today was the first day for Ahn to use psychometry on a corpse so I'm organizing the thought.

657
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:09,120
I think he read the corpse as an object instead of a human.

658
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,300
What's the difference?

659
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:13,000
Human Psychometry is

660
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:20,460
when you can see someone's painful memories and any big or small traumatic events they went through.

661
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:21,730
Oh yes, trauma!

662
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:25,010
Yes. But it's different from seeing objects.

663
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:28,830
Should I say objective, selective, and detached?

664
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:30,910
In short, it's inconsistent.

665
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:35,950
The woman who wore the silver ring probably visited that room many times.

666
00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:38,360
Don't put so much thought into it.

667
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:41,620
A convalescence nurse!

668
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:46,420
That's right! RIght before the victims died, she examined all of their undergarments.

669
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:48,690
But all of the women who died don't have family members.

670
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:51,150
They couldn't move around freely.

671
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:53,590
What if a convalescence nurse gave it to them secretly?

672
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:55,920
Right before they died.

673
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,310
That might be true.

674
00:54:57,310 --> 00:55:02,030
What's this? Are you saying this is meaningless because the case is already closed?

675
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:06,690
Are you focusing on Lee Ahn's skills or

676
00:55:08,990 --> 00:55:11,990
focusing on this case?

677
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,440
Both.

678
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:18,990
Well what about you? Why are you overlooking Lee Ahn and this case so easily?

679
00:55:18,990 --> 00:55:22,010
I'm not overlooking it easily at all.

680
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:36,250
 December 4, 2008 

681
00:55:37,370 --> 00:55:42,000
You know that his ability started when he was eight from the Yeongseong apartment fire, right?

682
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,650
You organized it all since then?

683
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:47,890
I told you, I'm not overlooking this easily at all.

684
00:55:47,890 --> 00:55:52,930
I think you want Ahn to develop psychometrics quickly.

685
00:55:52,930 --> 00:55:55,760
But you're underestimating him.

686
00:55:56,630 --> 00:56:01,330
No I mean... You should have told me this earlier.

687
00:56:01,330 --> 00:56:04,010
Then what about this case?

688
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:06,730
Why are you trying to cover this up so fast?

689
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:09,880
I didn't cover it up, I resolved it.

690
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:12,340
You were always so thorough with everything.

691
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:15,460
This quickly, suddenly, with one witness—resolved?

692
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:21,950
It's a simple fire, but it bothers me that he keeps on mentioning about Yeongseong Apartments.

693
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:29,950
Figures. There are many people who feel anxious just hearing that name.

694
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:33,990
To feel anxious...

695
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:38,470
Exactly. That emotion.

696
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:51,840
No matter how much I run away, I always end up here.

697
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:55,760
Prosecutor!

698
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:02,350
Until when are you planning on just observing Lee Ahn?

699
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:11,870
Until he has someone he truly wants to do psychometry on.

700
00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:19,520
I have someone in mind.

701
00:58:21,050 --> 00:58:24,700
Who is that person?

702
00:58:26,130 --> 00:58:30,770
They might have met already. That child...

703
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:46,690

 You were very successful.

 What is this? Does he live here? 

720
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:45,520
 A woman? 

721
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:47,030
 Pervert, why is your nose bleeding? 

722
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:48,260
 Do I look like a monster? 

723
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:51,290
 You're going to touch the girl who thinks you're a pervert? 

724
00:59:51,290 --> 00:59:53,220
 Yeah. 

725
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:54,490
 Teacher, do you know the girl 

726
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:57,040
 who carries cigarettes in her yellow purse? 

727
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,690
