 He is Psychometric 

4
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,670
What the heck are you thinking?

5
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,450
I only want to reveal the truth.

6
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:54,270
Then why were you searching for Kang Eun Joo after what happened at the Hanmin Care Home?

7
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,130
Was it all a lie?

8
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:00,670
Was everything you showed to me fake?

9
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:03,130
After the Hanmin Care Home

10
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,830
my mother disappeared right in front of me.

11
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:09,130
About the reason, I will meet with her and see what she has to say.

12
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:12,390
Kang Eun Joo not meeting with you

13
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,910
is because Kang Geun Taek told her

14
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,030
that you committed the Yeongseong Apartment murders.

15
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:24,100
You really didn't do it?

16
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,300
If I say no, will you believe me?

17
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,460
No.

18
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:36,420
I can't believe anything anymore! Anything!

19
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,570
If you need me, I'll come and be investigated again.

20
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,770
Hyung.

21
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,650
  Save me. 

22
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:01,130
  I may look shameless but  

23
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,890
  I don't want to die here like this.  

24
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,750
  He will be watching.  

25
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:16,670
  The only one who can save you. 

26
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,590
Let's talk at home.

27
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,730
At home.

 - Episode 15 - 

30
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,450
Seong Mo.

31
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:05,890
Come home... Mother.

32
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,600
Lieutenant Nam.

33
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,480
I know. Detective Kim and Detective Park, keep an eye on them.

34
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,010
Yes, sir.

35
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,460
Seong Mo.

36
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,510
You didn't do anything to that man, right?

37
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,630
Right?

38
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:15,420
Did you know that Kim Gap Yong

39
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,890
killed Park Soo Young and Kang Hee Sook?

40
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,920
Did you know that those women died because of me?

41
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,840
It wasn't because of you.

42
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,150
Kim Gap Yong found my weak point and tried to pressure me.

43
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:32,390
It was for his own benefit, not because of you.

44
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:35,530
You said you would catch that man with your own hands and punish him.

45
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,450
Isn't that why you became a prosecutor?

46
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:41,440
I didn't become a prosecutor to catch that man.

47
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:48,980
I became a prosecutor so I could protect us from him.

48
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,510
If I have strength

49
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:56,030
I thought that man wouldn't appear in front of us anymore.

50
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:58,780
After I escaped from the basement

51
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,740
and found out that no one was helping us,

52
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,430
there hasn't been a day where I didn't kill him in my mind.

53
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,250
So...

54
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:11,070
You really killed him?

55
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:18,190
We either run away or overcome our past sufferings.

56
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:23,110
We've run away so many times, but we always ended up back in the same place.

57
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:27,580
If I try to get revenge by just the law and finish it simply,

58
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,310
I don't think my scars will be healed.

59
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,130
Seong Mo.

60
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:35,950
A person precious to me died.

61
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,500
Even though I pushed her away, she stayed by my side

62
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,520
and in the end, she died.

63
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,680
From stories in the book you used to read to me,

64
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,540
the people who made me feel what those words meant,

65
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:02,480
while watching them fall into danger because of me, I couldn't even do anything for them.

66
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,490
Because of my poor decisions,

67
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,680
they became unhappy.

68
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,920
I told the police everything.

69
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,480
I knew you were alive,

70
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:26,160
and that Kim Gap Yong was protecting you all this time.

71
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,820
So now it's okay for you

72
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,660
to stop hiding from the police.

73
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:44,960
There isn't any evidence that Prosecutor Kang kidnapped Kang Geun Taek.

74
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,810
Prosecutor Kang knew that and came to us.

75
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:53,300
Did he end it and come back?

76
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:58,090
I clearly saw Hyung holding Kang Geun Taek captive.

77
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:02,400
Hyung is trying to pay Kang Geun Taek back in the same way.

78
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,420
Anyway, you saw him in captivity but you didn't see him dead.

79
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,770
But Kang Geun Taek's condition didn't look good.

80
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,800
Just a moment.

81
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:20,920
So you're saying you think Kang Geun Taek is alive?

82
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,280
If he is alive, how much longer can he endure?

83
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,600
 People disappeared from Kuyang hospital five days ago, 

84
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,290
so if he has a bullet wound, he could get tetanus or septicemic shock.

85
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:34,120
 His condition is very dangerous even now. 

86
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,970
I understand, Dr. Hong.

87
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:42,360
Hey, without evidence, you can't put him in the interrogation room.

88
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,790
The important thing right now is

89
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,130
we know that the Hanmin Care Home case was Kang Geun Taek's doing, but

90
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:02,920
there are no clear facts about the Yeongseong Apartment and Kim Gab Yong.

91
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,920
If Hyung did kill Kang Geun Taek,

92
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,930
we will never be able to find out the truth about the Yeongseong Apartment case.

93
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:15,050
Damn it.

94
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:18,920
How could he act as if nothing happened? Especially in front of me and you?

95
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,840
Ahn, in the past you couldn't read Prosecutor Kang but

96
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,950
today you clearly saw something about Kang Geun Taek.

97
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,850
Just try to see.

98
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:28,890
Let's go—to Hyung.

99
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:38,520
 Hanmin Care Home Murder Arson Case 

100
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,460
I moved not too long ago.

101
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:03,470
Now you can live here.

102
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,530
This is my room.

103
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,630
I should clean up my room a bit first.

104
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,630
Are you

105
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:31,320
still living with that kid?

106
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,180
Yes.

107
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,230
It seemed like he was really worried about you.

108
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,800
I know.

109
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,900
Because the one who always held on to me...

110
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,310
was him.

111
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,030
Also, Constable Yoon at the police station.

112
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:01,420
She is the daughter of Security Guard Yoon.

113
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,900
What?

114
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,770
We came just in time.

115
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,950
Lee Ahn, you clean up my room.

116
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:29,950
The one who created the mess should clean it up.

117
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:50,520
Ahn, I'm not going to avoid you anymore.

118
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,650
If I wanted to,

119
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:55,020
I wouldn't have returned.

120
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,650
Ahn, let's go out and talk.

121
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:06,770
Constable Yoon, please take care of my mother.

122
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:34,150
Where did you lock up Kang Geun Taek?

123
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:38,390
If this man is alive, my mother and I will continue to live in hell.

124
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,830
Just tell me if you killed him or not.

125
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:43,510
Just tell me where you left him.

126
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,450
I can't tell you.

127
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,620
Hyung, you shouldn't be the one acting like this to me.

128
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,910
If you conceal the Yeongseong Apartment suspect,

129
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:56,960
Jae In and I will never be able to find out the truth about that day.

130
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,830
I know why you want to kill this guy,

131
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:03,630
but you are not the only victim. We are too!

132
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,400
We are also the victims.

133
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,140
Right.

134
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:13,390
I wanted to kill this guy with my own hands.

135
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:16,140
I wanted to tear him into pieces.

136
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,820
If you were stuck in this basement for nine years

137
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:22,350
and saw my mother running away being anxious and distressed even after that,

138
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:26,580
I thought you could understand me a bit more.

139
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,110
Right, I understand.

140
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,710
But this is never a good method.

141
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:33,230
I know it's not a good method.

142
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,900
But the past is irreversible

143
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,770
and this is the best that I can do right now.

144
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,780
Please don't be like this Hyung, I'm begging you.

145
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:45,380
Please, tell me where Kang Geun Taek is.

146
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,140
  I'm not too late, am I?  

147
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,950
  I missed you, Hyung.  

148
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,370
  He is not dead yet.  

149
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:27,190
  There is no way Hyung could hide that memory from me if he killed him.  

150
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,110
I am sorry.

151
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,650
I am really sorry.

152
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:59,590
I should have returned and

153
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:03,660
testified that the security guard was not the culprit.

154
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,610
If I had done that,

155
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:12,650
he wouldn't have been falsely accused of being the culprit.

156
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:18,460
At that time, to think of another person's life,

157
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,000
I was too weak.

158
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,430
Get up, please.

159
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:29,390
I'll be honest and testify for everything.

160
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,790
I won't run away anymore.

161
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:41,770
Since you left before the Yeongseong Apartment fire,

162
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:44,600
you wouldn't know the truth of that day.

163
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:53,920
Did Prosecutor Kang tell you about the location of the Saeki-dong Station?

164
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,820
  Seong Mo, it's your mother.  

165
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,460
  Yes.  

166
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:21,320
 The Panhandling Organization from the basement 3rd floor of Saeki-dong Station... 
   

167
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:25,940
 That man and this case are connected, right? 

168
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:31,200
  Yes, the scar on the neck and the fact that there is no resident registration is the same.  

169
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,870
  I don't know where Kang Geun Taek is right now but  

170
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:44,060
 moving through and hiding through the ghost stations 

171
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:48,440
  is a great method to avoid people's eyes so there's a high chance that he is still doing so.  

172
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,430
  I am still trying to figure it out.  

173
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,560
  Just hang in there a little longer. 

174
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:58,630
  Soon I will make it possible for you to return to your name. 

175
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:03,070
That was the only information I knew

176
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:05,550
and that was the last call that I'd had with Seong Mo.

177
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:09,750
 The bodies of Kang Hee Sook and Park Soo Young found in the suitcases in Han River last month, 
     

178
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,710
 were missing persons involved in a human trafficking ring.
  

179
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:17,250
 It has been revealed that they were killed by Kim Gab Yong, the active leader of the organization at the time. 

180
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:22,260
  The day I discovered that Kim Gab Yong killed Park Soo Young and Kang Hee Sook, 

181
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,950
 I tried to commit suicide. 

182
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:27,610
  As soon as I woke up, I thought.  

183
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:30,140
 that I should kill that man with my own hands  

184
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,420
  and put an end to this. 

185
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,750
  So as my final choice, 

186
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,050
  I went to Saeki-dong Station.  

187
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:39,320
I should have killed that man

188
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:43,030
and ended everything.

189
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,820
I am so sorry.

190
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:53,070
Running away from Yeongseong Apartment

191
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:56,200
didn't mean everything would be resolved.

192
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,510
I am so, so sorry.

193
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,520
I've had a time where

194
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,040
I thought my dad was the culprit.

195
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,440
Even though it wasn't something I had committed,

196
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,070
I couldn't even breathe or sleep, because of the guilt.

197
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,210
Back then,

198
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,830
I read something:

199
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:34,080
"The scariest punishment God has given us

200
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,990
is time."

201
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:43,700
Where we constantly go back and forth between hope and doubts,

202
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,960
the suffering of time.

203
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:53,990
While my dad was in prison, you and Kang Seong Mo

204
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:00,610
must also have been suffering through the punishment of time,

205
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:07,410
which is why he secretly sponsored me, as well.

206
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:25,710
I am not forgiving you.

207
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:29,790
I'm just understanding you.

208
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:34,510
Just a little... Very little.

209
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,830
- Wheres Lee Ahn?
- He has left.

210
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:05,800
I made him too angry.

211
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,010
You intentionally led us to Saeki-dong station

212
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:12,170
so we could find Kang Eun Joo, didn't you?

213
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:16,440
But you didn't expect that Ahn would be able to see all the way to Kangkook station.

214
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,400
Yes.

215
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,560
I wanted to find my mother

216
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,960
and put an end to this without anyone else getting hurt.

217
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:31,320
You can say it was my last bit of conscience

218
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,330
for the Yeongseong Apartment victims,

219
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:37,310
you and Lee Ahn.

220
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,760
If you had found out where Kang Keun Taek was

221
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,020
you should have asked Detective Eun for help.

222
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,340
She was the one who worried about you

223
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,590
more than anyone else.

224
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:52,510
The case that Kang Geun Taek's fingerprints were left on

225
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:55,240
is only the Gangryeong confinement case.

226
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,350
Even though there is evidence and victims, the statute of limitations is past.

227
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:01,820
And other murder cases,

228
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:06,800
there's no clear evidence

229
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,530
of Kang Keun Taek as the real criminal.

230
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:10,250
But it's different now.

231
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:14,000
We found Kang Eun Joo who is an eyewitness of the Hanmin Care Home case

232
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:17,880
and you are a witness of Detective Eun's murder.

233
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,330
Being thrown in prison

234
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:23,030
serving a sentence of time

235
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:27,240
is only relevant to humans with emotions.

236
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:32,190
To a monster like Kang Geun Taek, that doesn't mean anything.

237
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:48,160
I surely saw something.

238
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:52,360
  TS Bowling Alley  

239
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,620
  Gonam Fire Station. 

240
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:58,280
Dohyun High School was the school I went to.

241
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,720
Why is that...

242
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,070
Dae Bong, it's me.

243
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,760
I have a last minute favor to ask of you.

244
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,640
I surely saw these but I don't know why I did. 
   TS Bowling Alley, Geonam Fire Department, Dohyun High School. 

245
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,330
These places have no connection to Hyung.

246
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:22,810
I checked it on my way here, but these three businesses weren't closed.

247
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:26,280
I don't think they're where Kang Geun Taek would be held captive.

248
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,310
- Ahn! Lee Ahn!
- Yeah, you're here?

249
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:30,550
Yeah,  I got the map.

250
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:33,100
If this is Dohyun High School, where we went,

251
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,910
TS Bowling Alley is here and the Geonam Fire Station is on the other side.

252
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:40,070
Could it be the locations he saw on the way to where he's captive now?

253
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:44,520
Dae Bong, how far are these location apart? Are they connected by a major street?

254
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,290
No.

255
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:50,890
Dohyun High School is is in Dohyun-dong, and TS Bowling Alley is at Saeki-dong,

256
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:54,590
and Geonam Fire Station is in Geonam-dong, the complete opposite side.

257
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:58,820
And they're not connected at all.

258
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:02,630
Should we be looking for a common feature amongst these three places?

259
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:07,060
Is there anything else you saw? I know this area really well.

260
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,890
Everything else was his childhood memories.

261
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:14,150
The harder I try to see, I only see good memories from him.

262
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:17,010
Since all these places are near us, let's go there for now.

263
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:19,640
We may see something else. Thanks, Dae Bong.

264
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,220
Yeah, no problem. Call me if you need anything else.

265
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:36,560
  TS Bowling Alley  

266
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,660
When you saw this bowling alley,

267
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,880
exactly what side was it?

268
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,790
It isn't this side

269
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:48,770
I think I saw this side.

270
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:53,000
This still isn't the course that connects with the other locations.

271
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,130
Could they have gone around on purpose?

272
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:57,830
Are you sure it was this direction?

273
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:00,380
Yeah. I am sure.

274
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:12,070
All the sides of the buildings you saw,

275
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:14,020
they're all the north side of them.

276
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,780
No, it wasn't this close. I think I saw a further view.

277
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:26,230
Further? How far?

278
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:30,060
Then did you see the other places from afar too?

279
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:35,880
Jae In, these places aren't where he's kidnapped nor on the way there.

280
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,510
It's as if someone was looking down from a bird's eye view, all at once.

281
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:41,750
Was it somewhere high up like a rooftop?

282
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:45,290
Could he have been looking down from the place he kidnapped?

283
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:49,560
Then let's find a building where all three locations can be seen.

284
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:01,140
There are no movements from him?

285
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:05,490
 Yes, he's still at home. And this morning Prosecutor Kang went to buy groceries. 

286
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:07,000
What? He bought groceries?

287
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,910
Yes, after killing someone he went and bought groceries. Isn't he truly a scary person?

288
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:13,450
If there's any movement, contact me right away.

289
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:14,420
How about his vehicle?

290
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:18,590
We did find it. But his car was parked at a public lot since a week ago.

291
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,390
We found it again before he came to the station yesterday.

292
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:22,650
What about Kang Seong Mo's phone call records?

293
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:27,450
He has never called or picked up his phone since he announced his leave.

294
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:31,380
There are certain times where it was turned on, but they all took place before this incident.

295
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,030
He turned on the power? Where?

296
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:35,340
Around Moohyeong-do, where Kang Eun Joo was located.

297
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:39,280
And the power was off in front of the hospital that Constable Yoon was admitted to.

298
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,720
The hospital she was admitted to after she was kidnapped?

299
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,700
It seems that Prosecutor Kang went to that place.

300
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,570
So he knew that Constable Yoon was kidnapped by Kang Geun Taek,

301
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:48,590
and on top of that, Detective Eun was murdered by Kang Geun Taek.

302
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:51,530
Prosecutor Kang's motive to kill Kang Geun Taek is quite strong.

303
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,760
- But there's something strange. 
 - What's that?

304
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,110
This phone number. They called Prosecutor Kang

305
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,450
much more than Detective Eun or even Lee Ahn did.

306
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:01,810
After Prosecutor Kang announced his leave, there were several calls a day.

307
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,860
They must be fretting. Could it be Kang Geun Taek?

308
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,560
I don't think so

309
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,770
because these phone calls kept happening even after Kang Geun Taek was held in Kuyang Hospital.

310
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,260
Should I find out the owner's name right away?

311
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:14,480
It's so urgent, it's killing me. Give it to me, we don't have time to go back.

312
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,390
 Hello, this is Noh Jung Hoon. 

313
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:27,500
Attorney General Noh Jung Hoon?

314
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:31,260
Oh, hello this is Nam Dae Nam, is in charge of reinvestigating the Yeongseong Apartment case.

315
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:34,180
 Nam Dae Nam, is something going on? 

316
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:39,040
We were looking through Kang Seong Mo's phone records, and we found your number.

317
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:43,880
I called because I was worried about him after he suddenly submitted for time off of work and disappeared.

318
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:47,490
Not his colleague nor supervisor but you, Attorney General?

319
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:49,710
 You could've asked one of your subordinates to do it. 

320
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:52,500
What's your point?

321
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,490
Never mind, I'll talk to you again.

322
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:59,080
Wow, I only probed a little bit, but he already started to get pent up.

323
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,560
Contact Prosecutor Kang's secretary. Tell them I want to meet immediately.

324
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,310
Yes, I understand.

325
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:12,210
  Recipient: Special Prosecutor Choi Soo Ji 
 Title: Investigation Report 

326
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:15,230
Do you think they're onto us?

327
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:21,620
 Chief of Police: Eun Byeong Ho 

328
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,790
  Attorney General Noh Jung Hoon 

329
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,990
 Chief Eun, let us meet right now. 

330
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:39,540
I am done talking.

331
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,820
I will refuse the joint investigation between the police and prosecution.

332
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:45,900
 What are you trying to do right now? Are you saying we should all go down, or are you just saving yourself? 

333
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,260
I am saying let's do things properly, at least from now on.

334
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:52,390
What did you say when I said you can't touch Dragon Head Hunting any longer?

335
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:54,440
  You said that all you needed to do was pretend to investigate, just pretend.  

336
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,800
Goodbye.

337
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:04,690
What should we do?

338
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:08,840
What can we do? If we can't convince them any longer, we'll have to push it.

339
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,330
Close everything about the Yeongseong Apartment case

340
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:13,810
before things get noisier.

341
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:17,200
You know what I'm saying right?

342
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,730
Yes, I understand.

343
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:23,650
Green onions, chives...

344
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:35,960
  Attorney General Noh Jung Hoon 

345
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:43,740
It's your first time, right?

346
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:48,500
Eating food that I prepared.

347
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,150
Eat up, please.

348
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:13,020
Seong Mo, I have a favor.

349
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:19,780
I think I know what favor you'll ask me.

350
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:23,580
Promise me you'll do as I say from now.

351
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:26,550
  Promise me you'll do as I say from now. 

352
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:32,770
 You need to do exactly as I say, okay? 

353
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:36,880
You need to do exactly as I say, okay?

354
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:42,980
Then, how about we do each other a favor?

355
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:47,910
Detective Nam, I got in touch with the secretary.

356
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:50,260
If we leave right now—

357
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,670
So this is their move?

358
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:56,210
 This is Noh Jung Hoon, Attorney General of the Prosecution Office. 

359
00:29:56,210 --> 00:30:00,510
 The dishonest investigation of the Yeongseong Apartment and Hanmin Care Home cases   
    

360
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:05,720
 is planned to immediately reopen by the prosecution office within the day. 

361
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,780
The police are strongly opposed to this decision. What is the reasoning behind this plan?

362
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:14,140
There's a rumor that there is a connection between the corruption of YSS Construction and the Yeongseong Apartment. Is that true?

363
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,670
Attorney General! One moment, please!

364
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:19,740
Attorney General!

365
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:22,330
  Breaking news: Attorney General Noh Jung Hoon orders a reinvestigation of the Yeongseong Apartment and Hanmin Care Home cases." 

366
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:25,490
Why is the Prosecution Office suddenly trying to get the investigative jurisdiction for this case?

367
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:30,580
Because the Yeongseong Apartment Arson case is entangled with the corruption of YSS Construction, the case is getting out of control.

368
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:33,300
You don't think they're trying to cover it up again, do you?

369
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:37,090
Chief Eun is blocking them, so I don't think the Prosecution Team will be able to steal the jurisdiction, but

370
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:41,430
if by chance, they find Kang Geun Taek before we do, the situation will change.

371
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,160
Let's hurry.

372
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:49,670
  
 Breaking news: Prosecution Chancellor Noh Jung Hoon orders a reinvestigation of the Yeongseong Apartments and Hanmin Care Home cases 

373
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,770
Gosh, why are they talking about that again?

374
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,360
Welcome—

375
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:04,890
What brings you here? Last time, you walked out saying you never wanted to see me again.

376
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:08,820
I came because I have something to ask you.

377
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:22,000
I don't think there are any buildings around here that are high enough to see of all three of those buildings at once. What are you doing?

378
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,520
I'm drawing out what I saw.

379
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:28,770
Over here is the bowling alley, Dohyun High School in the middle, and then the Geonam fire department.

380
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:32,650
And I feel like I saw something else, too.

381
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,710
Right, a cross.

382
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:40,950
Are you talking about a church cross?

383
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:42,890
It wasn't just one.

384
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:47,630
One... Two, three of them!

385
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:52,390
So that means that there are churches toward the north.

386
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,980
One here.

387
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:05,350
Here and here, too.

388
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,170
If you wanted to see all of this in one view...

389
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:09,980
Hold on.

390
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:17,760
I'm positive it's from this viewpoint.

391
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,950
To be able to see all of these locations at once,

392
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:23,450
we need to go further.

393
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:25,010
What are you saying all of a sudden?

394
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:27,820
I know for a fact you told the police

395
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,710
that the security guard gave me a jacket.

396
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:33,160
Are you positive about that?

397
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,220
Of course, I am!

398
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,230
But, honestly, it was so hectic.

399
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:40,820
It was filled with smoke and you couldn't see much in front of you. But you're positive you saw it?

400
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,230
Why are you bringing that up now!?

401
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:44,580
Don't you watch the news?!

402
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:49,720
There's another suspect and not Jae In's dad.

403
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,430
Come on!

404
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,590
Agh, seriously.

405
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,520
  There! To the stairs! Head toward to stairs! 

406
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,720
  Stay as low as you physically can!! 

407
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:11,960
 So Hyun's dad! Go toward the stairs! 

408
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,730
 Move through the stairs! 

409
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:15,870
 Ah! 

410
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:18,070
 So Hyun, let's go! 

411
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,050
You picked up the jacket from hallway?

412
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:25,170
Yes. The jacket said "Yoon Tae Ha"

413
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:29,140
and there was blood all over it! I thought for sure he was the criminal.

414
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:32,930
But how could you testify that the security gave me the jacket?

415
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:36,780
I wasn't the only one who accused the security guard back then!

416
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:39,850
All of the people from the apartment suspected the security guard too!

417
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,800
Though after the fact,

418
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,710
other stories came out.

419
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:58,270
- Other stories? 
  - Back then, after all of the issues were resolved, 

420
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:00,150
 the residents said that 

421
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:04,090
your dad wasn't on the 7th floor in the beginning.

422
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:07,460
He was leading people outside, starting at the top floor.

423
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:12,010
 Also, the biggest issue was that none of the fire protection services were functioning, 

424
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:16,940
 and there was a rumor that the president of the women's association was receiving bribes from the Yeongseong Apartment construction company too. 

425
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:20,020
Can you give me the contact information of the people that said so?

426
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:22,310
My dad is looking into it right now.

427
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,740
Thanks, So Hyun.

428
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:28,020
There's nothing to be thankful for. I'm the one who should be sorry.

429
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,600
 - I'll call you again.
 - Okay.

430
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:44,660
Do you remember the one and only day trip we ever went on after escaping from the basement?

431
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:49,440
- The weather was just like this. 
 - Yes.

432
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:55,330
We wanted to act like nothing ever happened to us, to forget everything and live a normal life.

433
00:34:55,330 --> 00:35:00,690
We wanted to eat kimbap and take pictures like the other families.

434
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:02,470
That's what our plan was.

435
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:05,140
You cried the whole time,

436
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:08,710
when you looked at the captive animals.

437
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:13,590
I couldn't begin to understand why you were crying, nor could I console you.

438
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:19,990
Anyone could tell that we were far from normal.

439
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:24,400
You comforted me.

440
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:30,990
You held my high tightly, right?

441
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:33,890
Should I tell you an interesting story?

442
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,540
An interesting story?

443
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:41,080
Do you know what the 10th Article is in the Constitution of the Republic of Korea?

444
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,860
Is this some kind of silly riddle?

445
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:45,110
You could see it like that, yes.

446
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:51,170
I don't know, what's the answer?

447
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:55,440
The Constitution of the Republic of Korea is for all of its people

448
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,090
to have the right to human dignity and worth,

449
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:04,570
and to pursue happiness.

450
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:09,140
The country acknowledges each person's

451
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:12,270
civil rights and inscrutability.

452
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:18,440
It is obligatory to provide these things.

453
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,400
Isn't it interesting?

454
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:24,480
It is.

455
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:38,470
It looks like they're going pretty far away. Where could they be going?

456
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,230
You don't think they're going to try to run away, do you?

457
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:45,000
There won't be another person to escape from right under my nose.

458
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:50,480
The slush fund records from Dragon Head Hunting have disappeared?

459
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,250
Yes.

460
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:56,420
I am positive that we had collected five volumes of records back then. Right, Detective Lee?

461
00:36:56,420 --> 00:37:00,350
Didn't we pass those on to the Special Prosecutor Team as soon as we received them?

462
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:05,010
That's what I thought too, but it turns out that

463
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:07,320
Prosecutor Kang only gave four volumes of the YSS Construction Slush Fund records to the Special Prosecutor Team.

464
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,910
It seems like the Prosecutor's Office was committed to finding them.

465
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:14,610
Those four volumes have probably been shredded already, so the last one that Prosecutor Kang posses is

466
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:20,060
the very last one. What on earth is he planning to do with it?

467
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,680
Hello?

468
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,900
Understood. Goodbye.

469
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:34,780
Constable Yoon, where are you?

470
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:37,350
We're still trying to find the location that Ahn saw.

471
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:39,340
A body was just found at the Han River,

472
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:42,760
 They say it seems like it's the corpse of Kang Geun Taek. You should hurry over to Dr. Hong. 

473
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:57,610
What are they doing? Why did they come to the local court?

474
00:37:57,610 --> 00:38:00,350
They're here to recover Kang Eun Joo's identity.

475
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:01,800
Ugh.

476
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:06,080
I overreacted, thinking they came to Kangwon-do and escape on a boat or something.

477
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,480
But why aren't they coming out?

478
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,530
Over there, they're coming out now.

479
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:24,620
It's all set now, right?

480
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,250
Yes.

481
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:32,680
I opened this line under my name,

482
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:36,240
but you should change it to your name after you get your ID card.

483
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:42,420
All of the documents are official, so you should get a decision right away.

484
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,740
Alright.

485
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:54,430
So, are you leaving now?

486
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:57,590
You promised that you wouldn't cry.

487
00:38:57,590 --> 00:39:00,650
If you're going to act like this, I can't keep helping you with your favors.

488
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,930
Okay, I understand.

489
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:07,550
I won't ever cry anymore.

490
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,720
Don't sneak around anymore,

491
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:25,990
and just keep looking forward, okay?

492
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:47,810
  Gangryeong Local Court  

493
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:51,130
What the heck? Why is Prosecutor Kang going back inside?

494
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:53,240
Follow him, quickly.

495
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:07,050
Where is Prosecutor Kang going?

496
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:10,900
He said that he has some unfinished business.

497
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:52,660
What the heck? Why is Kang Eun Joo crying?

498
00:40:57,650 --> 00:41:01,430
Detective Park, it looks like that punk is trying to escape. Go track him down.

499
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,050
  Document Submission  

500
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:17,350
I'm a police officer.

501
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:18,810
It looks like you're a second too late.

502
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:22,040
This corpse is under the jurisdiction of the Prosecutor's Office, so you should stay out of it.

503
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:25,910
Now is not the time to argue between Prosectors and Police.

504
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:29,400
Dr. Hong? Dr. Hong?!

505
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,420
Who the hell are you?

506
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:33,490
He's not a police officer.

507
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:34,880
He's here because

508
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,990
I asked him to do something for me.

509
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:38,850
Come in.

510
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:47,720
  NFS National Institute of Scientific Investigation  

511
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:53,020
The body is already pretty far into decomposition, so I can't accurately identify the victim by appearance.

512
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:57,970
In the meantime, there's definitely a gunshot wound on the arm. Do you really think it could be Kang Geun Taek?

513
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:09,460
  Eun Am Police Department 
 459124 
 About 50 years old, Male, Unidentified, Heart Attack. 
 

514
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:39,920
This isn't Kang Geun Taek. This is a homeless man who died of a heart attack.

515
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:48,550
I think that woman outside is trying to make this unidentified body into Kang Geun Taek's.

516
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:51,670
Does she think I'm a pushover?

517
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:55,050
Alright, I'll manage it from here.

518
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:59,390
  The body in Han River found by the Prosecutor's Office this afternoon, 
     

519
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:02,610
  has been alleged to be Kang Geun Taek. 

520
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:03,930
So, because of the YSS Construction Company's corruption,

521
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:07,250
the Prosecutor's Office was desperate enough to fabricate a corpse

522
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:10,100
to try to quickly close this case? Is that right?

523
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,230
This is quite unusual.

524
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:16,370
What the hell is the issue here? We're positive that the corpse isn't Kang Geun Taek.

525
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:20,370
Because having authority means you can turn wrong into right.

526
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:24,250
If the Prosecutor's Office announces that Kang Geun Taek died of suicide,

527
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:29,210
then the truth behind Yeongseong Apartment will get covered up again.

528
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:31,410
Let's have faith in Dr. Hong.

529
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:34,180
She won't let them get away with this easily.

530
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:38,740
I have a good idea.

531
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:40,690
I told you already.

532
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:42,620
This corpse is not Kang Geun Taek.

533
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:46,060
The fingerprints and blood samples from the corpse don't match Kang Geun Taek,

534
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:48,380
and the cause of death is a heart attack, not death by drowning.

535
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:51,910
Also, this gunshot wound was definitely given post-mortem.

536
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:56,450
Look here, this is a post-mortem wound based on the drying from lichenification. 
   Lichenification: a phenomena in which the skin becomes like leather. 

537
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:58,690
This issue has already been closed by the higher-ups.

538
00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:01,960
Please sign off on the cause of death as a suicide.

539
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:09,570
So you're telling me to shut up and just sign the document?

540
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,190
  Autopsy Report 

541
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:21,170
How fun. I've only seen this stuff in movies before.

542
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:24,690
It seems like you have done this kind of stuff several times before, right Prosecutor?

543
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:28,100
You should sign it. If you don't want to lose your job.

544
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:31,400
Have you no shame?

545
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:35,050
The person who died in the Yeongseong Apartment Case wasn't even Kang Eun Joo in the first place,

546
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:38,870
if you guys had properly checked the identity of that corpse, this would have been finished immediately.

547
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:41,610
You guys are to blame, but

548
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:44,890
we were problematic too!

549
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:47,990
Watch what you say. What gives you the right to act out like this?

550
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:50,800
I was doing this job due to my sense of duty.

551
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,160
If I lose that, I have no reason to keep doing this job.

552
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,670
If you don't like it, then stay out of it. There are tons of other people to sign the autopsy report.

553
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,430
 Constable Yoon Jae In 

554
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:06,570
Yes, Detective.

555
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:10,250
I was distracted while calling.

556
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:14,470
You heard everything? And recorded it too?

557
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:17,810
That's right. This is the flipping situation we're in,

558
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:20,350
so we'll have to stay completely alert

559
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:22,280
and find the real Kang Geun Taek.

560
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:24,340
Good work.

561
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:28,620
Let's wait and see

562
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:31,290
who will lose their job first.

563
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:41,090
Also, this gunshot wound was definitely received post-mortem.

564
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:45,660
 Look here. This is a post-mortem wound based on the drying from Hyuk Pi Sang Hwa. 
   (Hyuk Pi Sang Hwa: a phenomena in which the skin becomes like leather.)  

565
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,770
 This issue has already been closed by the higher-ups. 

566
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:51,010
  Please sign it off as a suicide. 

567
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:52,580
Clear evidence secured.

568
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:55,390
I taught you well, Officer Yoon.

569
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:57,100
Does this have legal validity?

570
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:59,670
I've heard that secret recordings can't be evidence.

571
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:03,960
Aside from that, if they know that we have this kind of evidence,

572
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:09,100
they won't be able to pull this off with a fake corpse.

573
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:12,770
Yeah.

574
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:15,320
What are you talking about?

575
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:19,970
What do you mean you lost Prosecutor Kang? Are you really going to continue with this foolishness?

576
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,000
 Attorney General Noh Jang Hoon 

577
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:28,380
 Kang Seong Mo, where are you right now? 

578
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:30,960
If you're planning on threatening me with the stupid records, just give up.

579
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,770
It's not a threat. It's a negotiation.

580
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:35,660
Negotiation?

581
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:41,570
Fine. What is it that you want?

582
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:45,390
 We got a location on Prosecutor Kang's phone. 

583
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:47,560
Where was his last location?

584
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:50,480
Unit 1, Yoosu, Dohyun-dong, Seoul.

585
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,550
He made his last phone call to the Attorney General and turned off his phone fifteen minutes ago.

586
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:55,860
He made a call to the Attorney General?

587
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:59,780
Is he using the slush fund records as bait to hide the murder of Kang Geun Taek?

588
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:02,780
Wait. Dohyun-dong is...

589
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:05,490
It's near there. The places you saw.

590
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:09,220
Hyung is trying to go back to Kang Geun Taek.

591
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:11,200
You guys track the places Ahn saw,

592
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,910
Detective Lee and I will call troops to search the whole area.

593
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:16,070
Search mainly in empty houses or buildings.

594
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:17,910
Yes, sir.

595
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:20,910
At the very least, the building will be at least five floors high.

596
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:22,560
Okay.

597
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:29,630
Constable Yoon! Have you forgotten that you're going after two murder suspects right now?

598
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:31,240
Here.

599
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:35,390
If you find firm evidence, call us first.

600
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:37,950
If you guys act on your own, I won't stay still.

601
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:39,380
Okay.

602
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:41,090
Let's go.

603
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:44,410
Let's go too.

604
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,710
What's wrong?

605
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:09,300
I don't know. My chest is throbbing all of a sudden.

606
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,340
Your chest?

607
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:14,980
Is it because you touched that corpse earlier?

608
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:17,830
I heard that corpse died of a heart attack.

609
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:20,200
It was only a moment.

610
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:44,150
 The wound will begin to throb and fester. 

611
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:48,250
 And it should slowly rot away. 

612
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:50,800
 What to do? 

613
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:55,930
 I still don't know what pain is. 

614
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:02,050
 Don't worry. 

615
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:06,460
 I will let you feel what pain is. 

616
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:04,050
 Hotel 

617
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:07,150
It's not here. It's farther.

618
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:08,800
Let's go.

619
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:35,920
Yes, Lieutenant Nam.

620
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:39,670
There's nothing there either, right?

621
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:42,200
Okay.

622
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:47,100
The view is getting similar to what I saw.

623
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:48,550
It's definitely near here.

624
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:50,530
Let's go up.

625
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:05,310
Okay. I think it's around here.

626
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,260
 How is it? 

627
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:19,000
The height is about the same.

628
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,070
I can see Dohyun High School, the Geonam fire station, the bowling alley sign,

629
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:24,340
and the crosses.

630
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:28,260
But, this building has no empty areas.

631
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:30,690
There's nothing strange on the security cameras either.

632
00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:33,470
Then, it's not here either?

633
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:34,960
  I'll go to the rooftop. 

634
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,360
Look to see if there are any other tall buildings nearby.

635
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:39,920
Okay.

636
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,840
Where on earth is it?

637
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:50,060
Where is it?

638
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:57,720
Lee Ahn!

639
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,810
The tall buildings nearby,

640
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:03,390
I've asked Lieutenant Nam to search them all.

641
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:04,990
Jae In.

642
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:07,840
That.

643
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:14,210
That's Yeongseong Apartment, right?

644
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:26,730
Yeah, it is.

645
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:28,740
The day I transferred,

646
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:32,180
I saw the Yeongseong Apartments from afar while on the rooftop.

647
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:34,040
I remember for sure.

648
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:36,440
No way.

649
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,850
Do you remember when you went to the Yeongseong Apartments recently?

650
00:52:38,850 --> 00:52:43,270
There was a banner about the confirmation of redevelopment. 
 Yeongseong Apartments 2019 Redevelopment Confirmed 

651
00:52:43,270 --> 00:52:48,310
With the redevelopment announcement... They told everyone to move out by January 19th.

652
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:52,260
That means the apartments are now empty, right?

653
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:56,420
If he looked out from around this height,

654
00:52:56,420 --> 00:53:00,400
he must be locked in... The tenth floor?

655
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:04,440
No. The eighth floor?

656
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:09,590
What if it's where the murder took place?

657
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:11,890
Unit 702.

658
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:39,760
Kang Geun Taek is presumed to be confined in Unit 702.

659
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,220
Kang Seong Mo may be there so stay alert.

660
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:43,930
Go!

661
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,930
Hurry!

662
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:02,270
It's happening again?

663
00:54:03,130 --> 00:54:05,460
I'm okay. Let's hurry upstairs.

664
00:54:31,450 --> 00:54:33,220
Break it.

665
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:48,760
 Save me. 

666
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:51,190
 I know I look shameless but, 

667
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:54,100
 I don't want to die here like this. 

668
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:56,690
 He'll be watching, 

669
00:54:57,390 --> 00:55:00,370
 the only person 

670
00:55:01,610 --> 00:55:04,090
 that can save you. 

671
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:08,340
Jae In. It's the smallest room.

672
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,520
Check him.

673
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:39,090
He is alive.

674
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,480
Detective Lee, make sure to keep a definite eye on him to see what kind of person he is.

675
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:52,750
Yes, sir. Kang Geun Taek is going down. Stay alert.

676
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:56,770
I think he will need surgery quickly. His skin has already begun to decay.

677
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,360
We need to find Hyung.

678
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:01,920
This isn't over yet.

679
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:05,690
There's a high possibility that Kang Seong Mo is here,

680
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:07,670
so don't leave out a single room and search them all.

681
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:09,290
Let's go.

682
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:18,020
  Who's there? 

683
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:36,380
  Can I come to the meeting on my mother's behalf?  

684
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:40,330
  My mother asked me to come on her behalf.  

685
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:42,840
  Sure, that's fine.  

686
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:52,730
  She doesn't even show up but sends her kid instead?  

687
00:56:52,730 --> 00:56:55,950
  What are you doing? Come here and sit down.  

688
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:58,130
  Just a second.  

689
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:28,440
 I went from Unit 701 to Unit 1501 in order to meet up with the police officer who offered to help me, 

690
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:32,010
 but it was empty. 

691
00:57:32,010 --> 00:57:35,280
 That's when I found out about the fire. 

692
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,260
 I intended to go back to my apartment to see what was going on, 

693
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:40,310
 but the smoke made that impossible. 

694
00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:45,500
 However, in front of the elevator, 

695
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,980
 I met Yoon Tae Ha and Lee Ahn. 

696
00:57:48,990 --> 00:57:52,700
 Hyung didn't come looking for my dad. 

697
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:57,110
  He was in Unit 702 at that time.  

698
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:13,350
  Seong Mo, I have a favor to ask.  

699
00:58:13,350 --> 00:58:17,880
  Promise me that you'll listen to what I say from now on. 

700
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:23,600
  So... Does this mean we're doing a favor for each other? 

701
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:27,930
  Seong Mo, don't hide anything from me 

702
00:58:27,930 --> 00:58:29,620
  and tell me the truth. 

703
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:33,660
  Don't hide the truth about what happened at the Yeongseong Apartments anymore. 

704
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:38,390
  I don't want to run away from the past anymore either. 

705
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:27,060
  Of course, winter strawberries are the best kind of strawberries, 

706
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:28,860
  they are delicious.  

707
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:34,450
  Student! Where are you going?  

708
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:58,310
  What is all this? What is he thinking?  

709
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:34,350
  Resident Registration Card  

710
01:00:44,490 --> 01:00:48,270
  Knife... Lighter...  

711
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:51,130
 My mom's ID card... 

712
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:55,950
 A burned woman's body. 

713
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:07,720
  Kang Chun Police Department 

714
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:54,350
  I have to see it to the end. Until the end.  

715
01:02:09,450 --> 01:02:11,110
  What is it, sir?  

716
01:02:11,110 --> 01:02:13,450
  What, do you have something to say to me?  

717
01:02:13,450 --> 01:02:15,510
 What's this bag? 

718
01:02:15,510 --> 01:02:18,610
  I am very sorry.  

719
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:22,610
  Hm? This voice is— 

720
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,170
 Madam!! 

721
01:02:53,170 --> 01:02:56,640
  Oh my gosh what do we do?! What do we do?! Why are you doing this?! 

722
01:05:00,170 --> 01:05:01,600
Lee Ahn.

723
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:04,040
Ahn! Come to your senses, Ahn!

724
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:06,010
Ahn!

725
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:16,190
No way.

726
01:05:16,190 --> 01:05:18,260
There's an emergency, there's an emergency!

727
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:20,240
In Unit 702, victim Lee Ahn is injured.

728
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:24,950
He has no signs of breathing nor a pulse. I request an emergency dispatch!

729

738
01:06:28,550 --> 01:06:30,920
  You expected that this day would come, didn't you?  

739
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,880
  That you would meet me and Jae In.  

740
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:34,980
  And you would ask Jae In to handle my ability.  

741
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:36,080
  It's Unit 1501.  

742
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:40,480
  You are under arrest as a criminal under the provisions of Article 112 of the Criminal Procedure Act.  

743
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:44,620
 Lieutenant Nam, you knew from the very beginning that this was caused by the corruption of YSS Construction. 

744
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:46,820
  We have to tie him up and put him away.  

745
01:06:46,820 --> 01:06:49,240
  Are you asking me to rescue you in case something goes wrong?  

746
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:51,980
  There's no other way than bringing Kang Eun Joo to court.  

747
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:54,610
  I didn't kill anybody.  

748
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:57,140
  Are you saying that it's there?
