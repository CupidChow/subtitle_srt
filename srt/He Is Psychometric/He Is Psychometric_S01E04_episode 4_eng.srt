00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,620
 He Is Psychometric 

2
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:15,080


3
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,370
 He Is Psychometric 

4
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:50,650
 December 3rd, 2005 
6:15 pm 
1 hour before Yeongseong Apartment Incident 

5
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,520
 Dad, I love you 

6
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,640
Jae In, I'm going to go pass around some flyers. Wait here, okay?

7
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,920
Okay! Come back soon!

8
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,160
What's this?

9
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,840
Mister. I told you this before.

10
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,600
You can't hand these out without the owners' consent.

11
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,360
No matter how many times I tell the residents to stop blocking the fire truck routes, they don't cooperate.

12
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,510
Are you advertising the fact that our complex has

13
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:27,840
lousy parking?

14
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,850
We don't pay your salary out of our own pockets

15
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:34,600
so that you can intentionally lower the property value of our apartments.

16
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,940
I'm doing this to get my pay's worth.

17
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:42,160
I've done everything I can, checking the fire protection system

18
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,780
but the fire safety awareness is particularly a mess.

19
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,010
A mess? Who said that?

20
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:52,990
Madam, you may receive bribes behind closed doors in this line of work

21
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,340
and you may turn a blind eye here and there.

22
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,230
But you can't turn a blind eye to the residents' safety.

23
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:01,570
Wait, wait wait. What did you say?

24
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:04,870
Bribes? Wow, I'm going to go crazy.

25
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:07,210
You must be crazy!

26
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,050
No, no. I must be the crazy one.

27
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,970
I was told you were trustworthy because you use to be a firefighter.

28
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,720
- I was clearly crazy for believing it!
 - That's not what I meant.

29
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,770
Mister, as of today, you're fired.

30
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,360
What?

31
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,640
My gosh. What a mess.

32
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,900
Isn't this your workplace?

33
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,020
How could you bring a child here?

34
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,180
She came to me because it was almost time for me to get off work.

35
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:37,450
That's enough. You're immediately fired.

36
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,260
What is all this?

37
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,780
Ugh.

38
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:51,110
  Keep roads clear for fire trucks  

39
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,910
Don't pay attention to them. You were just doing what you needed to do.

40
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:00,530
She's the weirdo.

41
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,850
What should I do?

42
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:07,490
What do you mean what should you do? You can look for a new job now.

43
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,650
That's not what I mean.

44
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:14,540
If this apartment catches on fire, it'll be really dangerous.

45
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:19,250
My daughter's shoelaces are untied again.

46
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:22,360
I can't have my daughter tripping over them.

47
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,670
- Go inside, okay? 
- Okay.

48
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,030
  Keep roads clear for fire trucks  

49
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,900


50
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:08,470
 Missing person, Kang Eun Sool 

51
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,530
 Daddy, I love you 

52
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,090
 Look up there! Isn't that a person? 

53
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,440
Huh? Dad?

54
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,810
Dad! Dad!

55
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,900
Dad! Dad!

56
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,130
- Dad! 
- Jae In! I'll be right there, don't worry!

57
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,430
Okay.

58
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,660
Okay!

59
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:21,450
 Pyschometry. Greek "Pysche (Soul)" and "Metron (Measure)". The ability to measure and interpret a person or objects soul. 

60
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,500
 He Is Psychometric 
- Episode 4 - 

61
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,960
Stop.

62
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,770
Oh sorry, my hand was cramping up.

63
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:35,250
 Answers acquired any way other than solving the questions yourself is considered cheating, 

64
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,350
 and if you get caught, you'll be asked to leave immediately. 

65
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:04,020
 I found you, Yoon Jae In. 

66
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:18,830
 Exam Hall 

67
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:22,090
 Now. Please put your pencils down. 

68
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,430
Let's talk outside.

69
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,660
I won't run away.

70
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,990
How come you keep calling me on my day off?

71
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,710
What's this? Are you undercover?

72
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:59,780
Oh, this? I went on a blind date. I ditched after ten minutes.

73
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:05,980
Oh right! I had to see Prosecutor Kang about something!  I just remembered. Do you want to go with me?

74
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:10,660
Why? Are you trying to show me off because I'm all dressed up?

75
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:16,340
Did you realize? I guess it would be too obvious how you feel if you just showed up like this?

76
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:21,660
Totally. Completely. He already knows how I feel.

77
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,930
No way. Did you actually go to him?

78
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,010
You know he's been working weekends for two years.

79
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:34,200
Oh, right. That case... Can't he let it go?

80
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:40,410
 We can't indict because the suspect is dead. 

81
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:44,730
 What? The only witness who named that suspect was murdered. 

82
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,680
 You're reaching, it was simply theft that ended up as murder. 

83
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,030
 The caregiver disappeared from the fire. 

84
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:51,940
  My pride as an officer won't let me give up on this.  

85
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:56,070
  What about my pride? Your father who lived his whole life as a police officer.  

86
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,680
  We informed the public on the fire at the care home  

87
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,080
  you solved the Yeongseong Apartment case eleven years ago. 

88
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,730
 That's right. You would know better than anyone. 

89
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:12,530
 You had to sign your mother off to an autopsy at such a young age, you were following the case so closely. 

90
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:15,700
 Did you feel like my investigation at the time was sloppy? 

91
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:22,720
 - Do you truly believe that there was not a single thing that might've gone wrong? 
- Prosecutor Kang! 

92
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,920
 If I remember correctly, like the care home fire, the Yeongseong Apartment case was also wrapped up fairly quickly. 

93
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:33,300
  - In terms of the law, procedure, and evidence, I did everything properly. 
- Dad!  

94
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:39,000
 If you want another look, either bring me proof or the real arsonist, not a hunch. 

95
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,790
 I heard many prosecutors are also against this. Coming to me won't change anything. 

96
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:49,860
 Fine. I'll take it that means an unofficial investigation  is fine. I'll leave now. 

97
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,890
 Prosecutor Kang's mother wasn't a mere victim of the fire. 

98
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:01,620
She was one of the victims that got stabbed.

99
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,500
Wow. That's why he was hanging onto that case.

100
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,240
I feel like there's something still there but he won't tell me anything.

101
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,010
But it doesn't look like his investigation is moving forward, either.

102
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:18,050
When you really look at him, he doesn't get close to anyone. He's only affectionate towards that psycho.

103
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:22,560
Not "psycho," psychometry!

104
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:30,030
Anyway, if there really is another perpetrator, he can't be an average guy.

105
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,720
He didn't even leave a trace behind.

106
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,720
  Victims personal details  

107
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,380
 I felt so shameful having come out of the building by myself. 

108
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:46,710
 And sorry. Which is why I didn't report it sooner. I'm sorry. 

109
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:50,190
 I think this happened on his way to see us. 

110
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:52,930
  10mm stab wound in right stomach, abdominal aorta ruptured  

111
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,410
  Yoon Tae Ha  

112
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:02,000
 I will go save your mom and dad, okay? 

113
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,860
 Please take care of him. 

114
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,470


115
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,030
 This metal chain is a bit weird, isn't it? 

116
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:18,500
 It's not even like it's tied to anything and it doesn't seem like they tried to chain his other ankle either. 

117
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,730
 Kim Gab Yong Murder Case 

118
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,380
It’s been a while.

119
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,000
I didn’t know you became a police officer.

120
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,590
How have you been?

121
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,700
There's no way she would shake my hand.

122
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,540
No, no.

123
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:55,260
This isn’t it.

124
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:20,440
♫   Some days when I look into your eyes  ♫

125
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:24,940
♫   Why do I keep seeing...  ♫

126
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:29,050
 I need one thing to protect me. 

127
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:32,120
 Since I don't have parents or any support, 

128
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,720
 I held out all this time by being number one at school. 

129
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:41,770
 But if people found out I was just a poor kid living on a rooftop, 

130
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:44,900
 I'd be a recipe for disaster. 

131
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,880
 I won't be able to stand any more. 

132
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,410
 I'm going to reveal exactly who you are! 

133
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,130
 You got it?! 

134
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:53,360
 Are you okay? You don't need to go to a hospital? 

135
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,020
 I'm fine. 

136
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,330
 You can't keep running away. 

137
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:07,060
 Aren't you tired? 

138
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:12,090
 I'm tired. I'm so freaking tired. 

139
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,260
 I'll help you 

140
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:27,180
 whenever you're ready. 

141
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:31,550
 Lee Ahn. I wanted to tell you. 

142
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:37,900
 You saying you'd help me gave me strength for a short time. 

143
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:44,150
 Develop your skills, okay? 

144
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,980
 Yoon Jae In! 

145
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:53,830
 Then when I become more confident, I'll come to find you. 

146
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:58,620
♫   It's okay to cry  ♫

147
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:02,560
♫  Someday we are all down  ♫

148
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:21,380
You were trying to cheat earlier, right? Right?

149
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:24,420
Those people sitting there are people who spent years sitting on their butts in

150
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,600
dorms without windows, studying for years.

151
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,400
Can you really take their effort just like that?

152
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,710
Is that the first thing you're gonna say to me after seeing each other for the first time in two years?

153
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:38,470
Then what? What else would I say?

154
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:42,230
I thought you were going to go to Seoul University. Why are you in the police academy?

155
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:46,250
I couldn't take my exams because I was too busy running away.

156
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,960
I took the detective and police tests.

157
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,790
I was really busy for the past two years.

158
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,880
So why did you run away, like a fool?

159
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,840
Then what about you? Did you live better than I did?

160
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,890
I definitely lived well.

161
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:05,730
Seeing how you're trying to become a cop...

162
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,050
Don’t tell me!

163
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:11,880
Are you helping your brother and that detective with your skills?

164
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,280
Like an investigative adviser?

165
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,570
A more technical term would be a "psychometrist."

166
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:20,510
Really? You're actually doing it?

167
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,120
Of course.

168
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,040
 See anything? 

169
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:38,560
 I see a knife. Really long and sharp. 

170
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,240
 This person is definitely a gangster or a killer. I'm right, aren't I? 

171
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,090
 He's a sushi chef with 30 years experience. 

172
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:52,020
 Welcome! 

173
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,180
 Hyung. 

174
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:02,750
 You only need to see the hit-and-run driver's license plate number. Just the number. 

175
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:06,070
 If you say bra sizes again, you know what'll happen, right? 

176
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,040
 1946 

177
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,000
 I definitely saw it this time! Confident this time! 

178
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,810
  One, nine, four, six. 

179
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,060
 1946 

180
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:54,100
 Right? I told you he'd read this. 

181
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:01,120
 Thank you, thank you. 

182
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,950
 Hey. If you bring him here again, 

183
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:09,640
 the next person who'll be laying in one of these is you. 

184
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,450
She and my hyung are going wild.

185
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:24,210
They said I need to join the force quickly, that I can't hide my skills any longer.

186
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:27,300
- That’s amazing. 
- What about you?

187
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,970
How's it being a cop?

188
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:31,450
It’s hard, but it’s worth it.

189
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:34,240
Where? Near here? Seoul?

190
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,210
Seoheun Patrol Division.

191
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:38,330
Are you in the homicide squad by chance?

192
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:43,250
I'm still on probation. But I think I'll join them soon.

193
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:47,920
Figures, you were always smart, even back then.

194
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,420
Get in. I’ll take you.

195
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,660
- No, I have an appointment. 
- Ah...

196
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,390
Look...

197
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:19,020
 Develop your skills. 

198
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,860
 When I become more confident, 

199
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,550
 I’ll come to find you then. 

200
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,200
What?

201
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:35,490
I still live where I did—right there, that rooftop.

202
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,900
Okay.

203
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,930
- I’ll be going now. 
- Okay.

204
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,210
Bye.

205
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:05,240
Seoheun Patrol Division. That's good. That's good enough.

206
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,250
It’s been a while since you came here. Ahn is doing well, right?

207
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,610
Yes.

208
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:16,450
He isn't going around causing trouble, is he?

209
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:18,810
Well, he's an adult now.

210
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:23,200
So fascinating. How did you discipline a kid like Ahn?

211
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,400
As you know, back then,

212
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,990
if you just touched him, he was ready to destroy everything.

213
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:32,230
You helped him graduate. He's basically a normal human being now.

214
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:35,090
- Of course—
- Although, he's still unemployed.

215
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,950
Work hard.

216
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,060
Hyung!

217
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,320
Why are you so happy? Did you do well on the police test?

218
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,860
Oh, right. I took a test, didn't I?

219
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:57,310
- Did I write my name? 
- You definitely cheated off the person in front of you.

220
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:01,310
- What a relief. I don't have to report you for an exam scheme. 
 - Were you going to report me?

221
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:05,360
Do you want me to be indebted towards you forever?  Aren't you scared? Especially in this generation?

222
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,100
It’s okay. You’re worth it to me.

223
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,680
Value?

224
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,640
What value do I have?

225
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,140
You are the person I saved.

226
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:19,000
It's kind of like keeping the virtue I've saved up to look at from time to time.

227
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,060
The person you saved...

228
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,850
If he became a policeman and did the same line of work you did,

229
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:26,150
in a pyramid scheme-like situation, he could bring you more value. Why don't you think of it that way?

230
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,930
So do you have to only become a policeman?

231
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:30,930
Of course. It was so obvious I was going to die

232
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:35,310
but you saved me and I gained this skill. I need to display it somewhere for this to be right.

233
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:38,820
- It's a crime to keep this hidden. 
- But it's such a wishy-washy skill for it to be displayed.

234
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,720
Wow. You're so bad.

235
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,390
Do you like saving me, then hurting me, you pervert-psychopath?

236
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,790
Sorry, I didn’t think it would hurt you.

237
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:51,130
Anyway, you didn't think this through.

238
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:55,320
How can you call yourself a prosecutor if you buy chicken without beer?

239
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,620
It’s really a mystery, a mystery.

240
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,250
The smell of chicken is killing me.

241
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:10,060
By the way, why are you coming here instead of home?

242
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,170
This is home.

243
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,750
What?

244
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:19,640
I told you a few days ago that we’d move here. I put the address on the fridge.

245
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:24,930
  I still live there. That place. That rooftop.  

246
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,760
No!

247
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,410
Go in first. It’s number 614.

248
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:31,860
I'm going to go buy beer.

249
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,270
I loved that rooftop so much.

250
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:51,090
It's nice and cool in the winter, a scorching hot in the summer.

251
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:55,640
Because it's wide open, you have to worry about invasion of privacy, too.

252
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,120
The view there is the best in the country.

253
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:04,940
Wow. It's here.

254
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:08,880
This is our place?

255
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,440
Now it finally feels like a house a prosecutor would live in.

256
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,200
To be exact, it's an investment.

257
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,730
It's embarrassing to say it's mine because my share is so small.

258
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:22,880
I'm embarrassed too. I'd feel more comfortable staying in a tenement house.

259
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,740
I told you before, right? You're my...

260
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,250
Virtue.

261
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:30,480
Bean rice cake? Why are you his bean rice cake?

262
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,230
I just am.

263
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:35,310
What's this? Is this your newlywed home or something?

264
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:38,750
Anyway, this is my housewarming gift.

265
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,830
- Thank you. 
 - What’s that?

266
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,390
Did you guys just connect mentally or did you plan this?

267
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:46,690
That's right. I was planning on ordering chicken too.

268
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:48,240
Eat first. I'm going to go wash up real quick.

269
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,040
Okay. Wash slowly because there are two chicken legs.

270
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,110
I didn't think this through. I should eat first then wash up.

271
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:58,280
But what is this?

272
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,800
That girly girl type of outfit.

273
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:05,820
I went to visit my dad and then I came from a blind date.

274
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:09,720
Okay, then I’ll do a cold reading now.

275
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,770
 Cold reading: Reading someone's mind without knowing anything. 

276
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:16,760
Seeing that your face is a little red, you already had one round of beer.

277
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,660
Seeing how you bought ten cans of beer,

278
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,630
the blind date didn't go well.

279
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,900
Nope, it went really well.

280
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,790
He completely fell for me.

281
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,190
You?

282
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,560
I see. I guess the blind date went well.

283
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,040
What about your test?

284
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,580
Enough about the test.

285
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:48,210
- Do you know Seoheun Patrol Division by chance?
- Yes.

286
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:49,800
That's our precinct. Why?

287
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,960
Really?

288
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,450
Why? What are you up to?

289
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:56,350
She became a cop, that one.

290
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:01,710
- That one? 
- The girl who made me out to be a pervert when I was a senior in high school. Remember?

291
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:04,100
Yeomsan terror.

292
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,560
You found her?

293
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,240
You remember her too?

294
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,400
Her name is Yoon Jae In, right?

295
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,200
She suddenly disappeared before her exams and became a police officer instead of going to college?

296
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,220
Yeah, she did.

297
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:19,580
Figures. Nowadays, as soon as you graduate from high school

298
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:22,790
there are a lot of people who bypass college and just prepare for official work.

299
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:25,170
Everyone is so impressive at such a young age, aren't they?

300
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,490
Very different from someone I know.

301
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,760
I'm going to go wash up now.

302
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,410
  I’m sorry but I can’t get in touch with her either. 

303
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:14,340
 The deposits aren't going through either. 

304
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:20,670
  I think she needs more time. 

305
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:30,150
I'm still in this state without a degree or a job.

306
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:32,940
But she became so cool.

307
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:38,640
They say first love is like that.

308
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,660
Just like the taste of beer, it's bitter

309
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,430
and nauseating the more you think about it.

310
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:48,030
Why are you so sentiment today?

311
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:51,500
SentimentAL. Mental.

312
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:55,850
There's something going on, huh? If you don't explain it thoroughly,

313
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:58,440
I can figure it out myself.

314
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,880
Where does your evidence-less confidence come from?

315
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,660
You only see useless things.

316
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,390
I don’t know about anyone else but

317
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:12,280
you're so transparent with me, like Dae Bong, so my psychometry works well on you guys.

318
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,510
I'm doing it!

319
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,940
Fine. If I'm going to get caught and be embarrassed,

320
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,450
I might as well confess and go from there.

321
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,400
I confessed to Prosecutor Kang and got rejected.

322
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,530
Again?!

323
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:29,790
What do you mean, again? You knew?

324
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:34,070
 There's a rumor going around at the station that you and I are dating. 

325
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:37,380
 Only at the station? It's spreading across the district. 

326
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:40,750
 I mean, unlike the way you treat other people, 

327
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:43,630
 you treat me comfortably and we're seen close together 

328
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:47,100
 really often so people keep saying we look good together. 

329
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:52,600
 So I was thinking... With this opportunity... 

330
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,960
 How about we not leave it as a misunderstanding and just— 

331
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,070
 Sorry. 

332
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:58,710
 We really did spend a lot of time together without boundaries, huh? 

333
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:02,510
 I didn't think this through. I'll place some distance between us. 

334
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:05,200
 You get back safely. 

335
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:18,360
I was so traumatized because I only saw that about you for the longest time.

336
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,250
But you confessed again?

337
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:23,950
That will is amazing. You're so cool, Eun Ji Soo!

338
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,860
Shut up.

339
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,840
If you knew, you should've told me that you knew!

340
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,390
Is there anyone who doesn’t know you like him?

341
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:34,700
It say's "I like him" all over your face.

342
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:38,930
You’re always chasing him around to eat and drink—even today.

343
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,330
You got rejected but why are you here? So embarrassing!

344
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:44,840
You guys said you moved and you took your exam today.

345
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,010
I’m always your excuse, huh?

346
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:51,060
Fine, just go ahead and ignore my efforts.

347
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,770
Do you know how much I think about you?

348
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:54,650
You really came for me?

349
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:58,650
Really? Without a single bit of dishonesty?

350
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:05,050
"No. My blind date went so well."

351
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:07,990
"He completely fell for me."

352
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,610
Those lines...

353
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:14,580
We saw right through them.

354
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,240
Really?

355
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,450
I'm so embarrassed.

356
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,380
I’m leaving.

357
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:28,340
You should ask my hyung to drive you home. If you keep doing embarrassing things, you eventually get desensitized.

358
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,480
Forget it!

359
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:35,420
I'm not seeing you out.

360
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,220
You want to eat this?

361
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,200
 I still live there, that place, that rooftop. 

362
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,230
 Okay. 

363
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,870
I have to tell her where I live now.

364
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:24,170
That's why I'm going to see her. Just for that reason.

365
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:42,000
- Are you not giving me my car back? 
- Let me use it for one more day.

366
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,060
I have something really important to do.

367
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:47,790
Is there really another good reason why I should?

368
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,700
Yoon Jae In.

369
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:53,530
I found out where she is.

370
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:56,730
Yoon... Yoon... Yoon Jae In...

371
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,800
I'm hanging up.

372
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,060
I love you, Dae Bong!

373
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:05,430
Welcome!

374
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:07,430
What are you doing? Another car's here!

375
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:09,070
I know.

376
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,270
How long is he going to follow Yoon Jae In around?

377
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:20,260
Yes, how much gas would you like put in—

378
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:25,450
This is your gas station?

379
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:29,200
Yeah! I recently opened it.

380
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,660
- I just want 30,000 won worth.
- Huh? Okay.

381
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:39,110
Could you o-o-o-open this please?

382
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,570
Thanks.

383
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:47,300
What should I say?

384
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:50,730
Excuse me.

385
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:55,170
It's been a while, huh?

386
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,270
Can I pay?

387
00:29:57,270 --> 00:30:00,070
Oh, right. It's fine, just go.

388
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:01,830
It's not like there are only a few classmates in this area.

389
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:04,260
I know. I put in gas for free for them, too.

390
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:08,950
I knew you'd be like this so I've actually been avoiding your gas station.

391
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:12,530
Don't do this. Let me pay.

392
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,940
So Yeon.

393
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:52,350
This is something I give to all of my first customers, seriously!

394
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,560
Okay.

395
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,880
I'll use it well.

396
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:03,340
 Dae Bong Gas Station 

397
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,910
Manager! What are you doing?

398
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,730
A baby...

399
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:21,030
I didn't know the words, "Baby on board" could hurt so much.

400
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:25,480
She's not here? There's no cop named Yoon Jae In here? Why not?

401
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,820
Because she's not here.

402
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:30,790
She said she was stationed here.

403
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,530
That's the first time I'm hearing that name.

404
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:34,090
What the heck?

405
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,840
Did she lie to me?

406
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,880
If it's Yoon Jae In, isn't she the probation officer at Seoheun Community Security Center?

407
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,420
The place where they only have one officer, you know.

408
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,600
- Oh, there's a place like that? 
- Seoheun Community Security Center?

409
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,860
Okay, thank you!

410
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,460
Thank you, thank you!

411
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,850
Security center?

412
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,990
One officer... What?

413
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,310
Hello? Yeah, Noona?

414
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,500
Oh, Seoheun Community Security Center?

415
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:15,960
I know. It's at the very tip of Seoheun in a remote place.

416
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,680
Did they not get rid of that place yet?

417
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:22,540
 What's a one-man-station by the way? 

418
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:26,050
 It's basically that you work while living and eating there. 

419
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:01,810
Her house is in the police station?

420
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:05,570
Yeah. But she's stationed there?

421
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:08,450
That place is a bit... meh.

422
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:10,310
What do you mean?

423
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:13,160
I picked this up right in front of the convenience store.

424
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:16,000
Please look for the owner.

425
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:24,690
Here you go.

426
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:31,030
"This child performed a kind act above all other children

427
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:33,030
and is presented this award."

428
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:34,880
Good job!

429
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,950
Thank you!

430
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:47,190
Grandma, this is not the place.

431
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:51,120
Over there, you see the red door over there?

432
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,140
Joo Ha, did you lie?

433
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:57,530
Aigoo, this is a big deal.

434
00:33:57,530 --> 00:34:01,980
- You might have to get handcuffed and go to jail. 
- Say you won't do it again!

435
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:05,290
I won't lie ever again!

436
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:20,100
 No, I mean, there aren't that many people there so there are hardly any incidents or accidents. 

437
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:25,340
 Start at 9 AM, get off exactly at 6 PM. The good thing is that it's an easy job. 

438
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:29,220
 The bad thing is that there's no way to get promoted. 

439
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,610
How did a young girl like her get put there?

440
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:34,710
 Police 

441
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:37,030
- Kid. 
- Grandma.

442
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:40,380
- Drink this! 
- Thank you!

443
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,740
Go on, drink up!

444
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,900
I will! Get home safely.

445
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,530
 Seoheun Community Security Center 

446
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:35,160
I went to the Patrol Division and asked for you.

447
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,950
I didn't think you'd come looking for me.

448
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,600
I didn't lie to you.

449
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:45,460
This is under Seoheun Patrol Division's jurisdiction, and I will go to Violent Crimes.

450
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:48,250
This was my first pick.

451
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:55,580
Ji Soo said that this is where officers come before they retire.

452
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,160
How did you end up here?

453
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:01,860
My partner got transferred here. I asked if there were any cheap homes for rent

454
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:05,290
and he told me to stay here since he has an aparment here.

455
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:08,990
How did you end up asking someone to help you find a home?

456
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:12,520
- I got caught snooping through an old case file. 
 - Already?

457
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:17,580
So I told the truth. I can't become an officer if I get fired during probation.

458
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:21,790
I'm too old to keep running away,

459
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:24,840
and I kind of have social status now.

460
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:29,860
So, did you see your dad's case file?

461
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,570
My partner won't let me see it.

462
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:42,190
It'll leave a trace in the system.

463
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:45,350
If he's caught, they'll revoke his pension. He told me to look into it when I pass probation.

464
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:50,520
Then he brought me to this place in the middle of nowhere.

465
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:54,260
Do you think I got scammed?

466
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,980
Can you even get to the Violent Crimes Division from here?

467
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:00,440
I heard there are zero cases here.

468
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:05,130
How will you gain points to climb the ladder and reach the police headquarters?

469
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:09,510
Hey, how do you know the systems and processes?

470
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:11,350
Because that's what I'm trying to do too.

471
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:15,310
I need to score big if I want to land a position.

472
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:17,400
It's not easy to—

473
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,510
Aha!

474
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:25,730
You said you were helping your prosecutor brother and that detective on cases.

475
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:29,050
You still can't read your brother, isn't it?

476
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:32,020
Th-that's... Well, you see...

477
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:36,220
Officer! What do I do? My Joo Ha disappeared!

478
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:42,130
What do we do?

479
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,850
I think it's because we yelled at her earlier. I can't with this girl...

480
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:51,260
I'm sure it's not a big issue. You search this side and I'll search over here.

481
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,020
Shouldn't you be calling the Patrol Division?

482
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:58,570
This kid's a repeat offender, she's on our Community Security Center blacklist.

483
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:02,360
Hey! What if it's a kidnapping?

484
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:09,360
Joo Ah!

485
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,010
Stop saying ridiculous things.

486
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:13,310
Just because I need to solve a case to get transferred,

487
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:15,250
I'm not praying for situations like this to happen.

488
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:19,090
Who said you were? I'm just worried is all.

489
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:20,660
Hurry up.

490
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:35,350
Joo Ah! Joo Ah!

491
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,260
- Did you happen to see Joo Ah? 
- I haven't. Is something going on?

492
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,840
Please give us a call if you see her.

493
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,540
Joo Ah! Joo Ah!

494
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,850
- Joo Ah! 
- Joo Ah!

495
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:57,820
Have you seen a little girl around?

496
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,670
Sorry.

497
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:04,800
- Joo Ha! 
- Where could she have gone?

498
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:08,770
Hasn't it been one hour since she disappeared?

499
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:11,450
I do feel like she's hiding somewhere.

500
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:15,750
Kids like to cause trouble in places where they can't be seen.

501
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:19,570
What are you saying? You were saying you didn't want any situations earlier.

502
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:21,720
Why would you say that?

503
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,730
Wait.

504
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:26,970
Why? What's wrong?

505
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:31,340
That... That's a toy Joo Ah always carries around.

506
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:02,130
What is it?

507
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:05,170
Hey, what’s wrong with you?

508
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,990
Listen, don't get scared.

509
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:15,060
I think the kid's been kidnapped.

510
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:18,510
- What?
- I just saw it using psychometry.

511
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:21,620
Inside a suitcase—a black suitcase.

512
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,880
No way

513
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,770
Jae In! What are you doing there?

514
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:30,700
What are you doing here?

515
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,230
My bunny.

516
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:39,630
The river is stinking because of the drought. Look at the poop!

517
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:42,580
Be careful. You don't know when it''ll start flowing.

518
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:45,470
I'll be at the center then.

519
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,340
Is she the one who went missing?

520
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:54,850
Is she the one who was...

521
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:56,610
inside a suitcase?

522
00:40:57,610 --> 00:41:02,200
That's weird. I definitely saw black hair sticking out of a suitcase.

523
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,930
Do you want to make a case like that?

524
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:07,010
Are you hallucinating or what?

525
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:09,300
You scared me to death!

526
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,650
But I saw it clearly. I definitely saw it!

527
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,030
How strange.

528
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:19,590
I picked the rabbit up here...

529
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,450
Yoon Jae In! Hey, Yoon Jae In

530
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:26,650
What is it now?

531
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:30,130
Don't even talk to me unless there's a suitcase with a body inside.

532
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:34,430
There is. There really is.

533
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:06,380
We'll have to look closely, but I think it's a woman's body.

534
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,070
What happened?

535
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:09,980
I don't know.

536
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:13,420
By the way, what should we do with that guy?

537
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:17,230
He already testified as a witness. I told him he can go back,

538
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:20,710
but he insisted on waiting for you.

539
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:23,690
Why don't you take the suitcase to Dr. Hong for now?

540
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:25,270
I'll come after I deal with him.

541
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:27,100
Okay.

542
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:34,550
I found the body.

543
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:38,400
I saw the image of the suitcase in my head.

544
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,090
Finally some good work. Anything else?

545
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:42,750
Anything else? Like what?

546
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:43,790
You mean like the culprits face?

547
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:47,090
Don't worry, I'll read every corner of this place overnight.

548
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:48,960
I'll touch every single leaf.

549
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,090
I'll see the culprit's face no matter what, even if I pass out.

550
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:56,000
I don't think that's necessary,

551
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,440
Oh well, you won't even listen to me if I tell you not to.

552
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,990
So you give me permission? You said it yourself

553
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:07,330
There's no need. You'll only waste your energy.

554
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:10,810
I told you about her, my friend from Seoheun Community Security Center.

555
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:13,130
It’s been a while.

556
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:16,380
By the way, she knows about my ability too.

557
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:19,720
What do you mean, he'll only waste his energy?

558
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,460
You already know, Detective.

559
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:24,690
I do, but I'm wondering if you know something else.

560
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:27,420
It's likely that the suitcase was flowing down the river,

561
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:31,450
 and got caught in the bushes when it rained heavily about a month ago. 

562
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:37,260
It's plausible that it got stuck here because of the drought.

563
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:38,460
What?

564
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:39,900
That’s what you think?

565
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:44,050
Bodies of suicide or murder victims often flow downstream.

566
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:47,020
But this is the first time it came all the way to our neighborhood.

567
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:49,510
You can't assume that it traveled here because of that.

568
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:54,070
We got a report that a black suitcase with a body in it was found in the upstream and I went to see it.

569
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:58,020
And it seems like it was the same suitcase and it's in a similar condition too.

570
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:02,720
It seemed like the murder took place about four to five years ago and we identified the body, but we still haven't figured out who the culprit is.

571
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,850
Is that enough?

572
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:09,500
You heard her, right? Your friend doesn't want you to waste your time here.

573
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,910
No way.

574
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:16,090
How could a suitcase with a body in it travel here all the way from Han River? It'd be too heavy.

575
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:20,290
When the body decomposes it becomes buoyant because of the gas it creates.

576
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:24,290
There's been a case where a body had a block of concrete that weighed 25 kg attached to it.

577
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:26,590
I read in a book that a body can even make weights up to 70 kg float.

578
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:29,190
- Will you be guarding the police line here today?
- Yes.

579
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:33,790
That's great. Please make sure he doesn't lurk around here.

580
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:36,610
He didn't understand a single word you just said.

581
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:38,760
I did! Gas from buoyance.

582
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,510
 Gas from decomposition. 

583
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:46,090
A body was found? In the stream here?

584
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:50,440
Yes, that's why I sent Officer Yoon there. How annoying.

585
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:54,450
I chose to come here because there's no crime here. This is a bad sign.

586
00:44:54,450 --> 00:45:00,660
Jae In... I mean, Officer Yoon said she'll give the children a preventative education to teach them to keep safe.

587
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:02,440
She always volunteers to do stuff like that.

588
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,270
- Should I come back later?
- No.

589
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:07,130
I'll do it. I'll do it.

590
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:10,240
Alright, everyone, come gather around.

591
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,760
Come gather around!

592
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:15,330
I'll arrest you if you don't. Gather around!

593
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:17,310
Everyone in Petal Class!

594
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:19,480
Shall we gather round?

595
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:22,860
Yes, yes ma'am!

596
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:25,200
Come sit over here.

597
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,350
Everyone in Petal Class...

598
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:32,140
You sit there and you sit here.

599
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:38,330
I can't believe there was a crime in this neighborhood.

600
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,640
How strange.

601
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:46,590
I hate the people who dump body in the water more than anything.

602
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:49,750
You said you hate the people who dump in septic tanks last time.

603
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:53,860
In my previous life, I must've

604
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:55,790
killed people like this and dumped the bodies.

605
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:57,990
Otherwise, why would I be destined

606
00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:00,900
to be doing this for a living?

607
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,970
I'm sure this is my punishment.

608
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:05,280
What about me then?

609
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:10,270
I must've been your accomplice or at least an abetter.

610
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:21,920
 Restricted Area, undergoing investigation 

611
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:31,690
I told you not to waste your energy.

612
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:34,360
This is the only thing I can do right now.

613
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:37,030
-Do you see anything?
- Of course.

614
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:41,130
Bird poop.

615
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:44,260
Dog poop.

616
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:51,590
Even human poop? What's wrong with them?

617
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:56,530
Don't waste your time. I'm sure the culprit didn't come here.

618
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,730
Today was my chance to prove myself.

619
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:19,060
At least I proved myself to Detective Eun.

620
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:20,710
Do you only care about yourself?

621
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:24,150
This is still my first case even though I'm just guarding the police line.

622
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:27,900
If I get lucky, I spend my day helping people finding things they lost.

623
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:30,570
And I found the body

624
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,420
for your first case.

625
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:36,030
I would've found it myself without you.

626
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:37,420
The suitcase was obviously very suspicious.

627
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:40,410
Who said I was imagining things earlier?

628
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:44,620
Someone yelled at me saying not to talk to them unless there's a suitcase with a body in it.

629
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:47,260
- Who was that?
- Okay, I admit it.

630
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:51,270
It's a little late, but I'll let it slide this time.

631
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:53,390
Look at you all excited.

632
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:56,560
By the way, could you repeat what you said earlier?

633
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:59,750
What? The buoyance thing?

634
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:00,910
I explained three times already.

635
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:03,800
No, not that. I kind of understood that.

636
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:07,820
You said you found a similar suitcase upstream.

637
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:12,400
Are you saying this was done by a serial killer?

638
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:17,530
The suitcase is the same one as the one we found Park Soo Young last time.

639
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:20,140
This time, we're assuming it's a woman in her 50s.

640
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:23,030
Considering she was wearing a winter coat and boots,

641
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:29,200
she was murdered in winter. There were cement blocks in the suitcase just like last time.

642
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,580
Was there anything to identify her?

643
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:32,960
Since the body is in adipocere state, we'll be able to get the fingerprints.

644
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,960
It better not be like last time. We identified the body but couldn't catch the culprit.

645
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:39,640
We couldn't figure out when she went missing since the victim didn't have a family.

646
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:43,470
- But this time—
- Are you saying you can't do it if you can't figure out when she went missing again?

647
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:44,460
Well, that's—

648
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:46,920
This is different. We just had a body then, but now we have two bodies.

649
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:50,430
I'm sure there's a connection between the two bodies.

650
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:56,230
I'm not worried because Prosecutor Kang is involved in this case. But finish it as quickly as you can.

651
00:48:56,230 --> 00:48:58,000
Yes.

652
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:03,960
Cases like this get too much attention since there's no interesting news these days.

653
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:07,530
You'd better get it done before people start calling us incompetent.

654
00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:30,160
Why is he so irritable today?

655
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:39,910
Seriously? Was it because he's upset you aren't getting married?

656
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:41,870
Be quiet.

657
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:46,340
Of course. He's really something.

658
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:50,690
I thought he was such a perfectionist when it comes to cases,

659
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:52,340
- but—
- Perfectionist my foot.

660
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:55,350
He's a crazy old man.

661
00:49:55,350 --> 00:49:59,310
He thinks I'll quit and get married by stressing me out with work.

662
00:49:59,310 --> 00:50:01,440
He's been setting me up on blind dates every week.

663
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,240
He changed his strategy now.

664
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,060
He's still admirable.

665
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:09,240
He went from a regular officer to a police commissioner.

666
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,730
Anyway, I'll see you later when we hear back from the forensic team.

667
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:13,280
Yes.

668
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:21,830
- What?
- Hey.

669
00:50:21,830 --> 00:50:24,380
What do you think was the point of our conversation?

670
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:25,790
We're here to identify the deceased!

671
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:29,460
No, not the meeting. I'm talking about what we just talked about.

672
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,660
Your marriage?

673
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:34,370
Right? That's what you thought too, right?

674
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:40,720
But Prosecutor Kang mentioned my dad at the end.

675
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:45,710
He probably thought no one would notice, but I did.

676
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:48,650
- Isn't he so clever?
- Well...

677
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:52,880
Does mentioning Chancellor Eun make you clever?

678
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,680
How do I become clever?

679
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,860
Life must be hard for you.

680
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:00,840
How do you investigate with a brain like that?

681
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,460
Wait for me!

682
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,060
  Han Min Rehabilitation Center Arson Case  

683
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:23,920
  Missing: Kang Hee Sook  

684
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,560
  Witness: Kim Gap Yong  

685
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:27,620
  A wound in the right abdomen  

686
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:30,250
  A shackle on the right ankle 

687
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:32,850
  Found in the Ra Ohn building's construction site  

688
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:34,120
  Who assaulted Kim Gap Yong?  

689
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:40,090
  Suspect: Yoon Tae Ha, the security guard at Yeongseong Apartment  

690
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:15,730
  Abandoned suitcase case  

691
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:27,560
 For your information, he's the one who found the body for this case. 

692
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:30,680
 He'd get harassed if they find out his brother was the prosecutor for the case. 

693
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,950
 You'd better brace yourself. 

694
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,320
I made it sound as professional as possible.

695
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,680
There's nothing emotional about it.

696
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:42,700
Nice. I did a good job.

697
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:45,750
I should just do it like this from now on.

698
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:52,150
 Yes. 

699
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:55,750
This is the kind of text message,

700
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:58,440
without any emotions, Detective Eun.

701
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:02,290
I want to fight him even more.

702
00:53:02,290 --> 00:53:04,530
  The investigation for Seoheun-gu's black suitcase murder is in jeopardy  

703
00:53:04,530 --> 00:53:05,380
  The investigation for Seoheun-gu's black suitcase murder is in jeopardy  

704
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:09,370
Last time it was a woman in her forties.

705
00:53:09,370 --> 00:53:13,600
It was a woman this time as well.

706
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,720
Yes, I understand.

707
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,110
I’ll be back.

708
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:23,500
I'm going to the Community Security Center. Will you stay here?

709
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,060
What? Hey.

710
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,640
You mean no one will stay here?

711
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:32,600
I told you, there's no point in investigating this place.

712
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:36,940
All the evidence is in that suitcase anyway.

713
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:43,530
Aren't you leaving?

714
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:35,700


715
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:07,210
 Also, a friend of his who became a police officer 

716
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:09,380
 found the body with him. 

717
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:11,510
 They're probably very excited right now. 

718
00:55:11,510 --> 00:55:14,890
 You really should brace yourself. 

719
00:55:18,230 --> 00:55:21,520
I would've touched more things if I knew.

720
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:25,350
I was too tired. I should've touched what's inside.

721
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:27,170
Is that really all you saw?

722
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:30,400
The suitcase and the body with black hair?

723
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,160
Yeah.

724
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,720
That's too bad.

725
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:37,060
But there's something strange.

726
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:41,140
When I'm with you I get better at reading things.

727
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:45,100
I doubt it, it probably just feels like it.

728
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:50,280
It happened two years ago in the teacher's office too.

729
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:52,710
That's strange.

730
00:55:55,470 --> 00:55:58,720
You must've studied a lot while you were away.

731
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,590
I mean, about police work.

732
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:03,420
I've been interested in this field since I was young.

733
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:07,450
I hated the police since they framed my dad.

734
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:11,720
But now that I think about it, I made a faulty assumption.

735
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:17,090
A faulty... right. So that's what it was.

736
00:56:17,090 --> 00:56:21,110
That detective you know, Detective Eun,

737
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:25,060
she came to see me at the convenience store as soon as the math teacher got released.

738
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:29,200
She got upset for me and she told you to be my bodyguard.

739
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:33,880
And I thought not all the detectives are so bad.

740
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:37,870
Is that why you took the police exam?

741
00:56:39,490 --> 00:56:44,160
I thought, "When I become a cop, if the suspect says they're not guilty,

742
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:48,060
I'll check three times or four times, over and over again

743
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:52,200
to make sure that they don't end up like me or my dad."

744
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,620
That's what I thought.

745
00:56:54,620 --> 00:57:00,450
I thought it'd be worth it even though I don't get to prove my dad's innocence.

746
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:04,670
Did you finally get to think about your own life?

747
00:57:04,670 --> 00:57:07,090
Instead of thinking about your dad?

748
00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:13,170
- Hyung!
- Long time no see, Officer Yoon Jae In.

749
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:15,710
Daddy Long Legs...

750
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,760
Daddy what?

751
00:57:34,950 --> 00:57:40,860


752
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:06,350
  He is Psychometric  

753
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:13,520
♫  See your eyes, I sense you looking at your eyes  ♫

754
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,280
♫  I know you like in your heart  ♫

755
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:24,680
♫  The coincidence that repeats  ♫

756
00:58:25,730 --> 00:58:31,250
♫  So take, my hidden feelings  ♫

757
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:36,030
♫  Take, the time I saved for you  ♫

758
00:58:36,030 --> 00:58:39,860
♫  Don't be afraid  ♫

759
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:43,830
 He'll be misunderstood for the rest of his life. 

760
00:58:43,830 --> 00:58:46,460
 You know this would end up being a cold case if we don't catch the culprit. 

761
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:47,700
 You'd better stay alert. 

762
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:51,030
 That's why they keep harassing you like that. 

763
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:54,540
 Could you give me some time to think about it? 

764
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:55,250
 Huh? 

765
00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:58,860
 I'm sorry. He wants no loose ends. 

766
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:01,720
♫  I can tell you now  ♫

767
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:02,480
 Who did you say it is? 

768
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,790
 Don't you remember? Kang Hee Sook. 

769
00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:08,850
 What are you?
