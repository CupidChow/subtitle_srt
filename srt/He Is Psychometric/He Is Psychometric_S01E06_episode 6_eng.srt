00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,670
  He is Psychometric

  He is Psychometric

  December 3rd, 2005 
  6:25 PM  

4
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,180
Mom, that person came.

5
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,180
- He found us? 
 - Promise me you'll do exactly as I say.

6
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:34,840
You must do exactly as I say, alright?

7
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:39,770
 Psychometry: An ability to measure and interpret the essence or history of a person or thing through touch. 

8
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,500
 - Episode 6 - 

9
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:58,320
  You know who it is, right?  

10
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,550
  That man...    

11
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,470
  He was following you. He was observing you for a long time.  

12
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:07,890
  Even on the day we fell from the apartment.  

13
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,400
  He was watching you that day, too.  

14
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,640
  Mom, he's here 

15
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,220
  I might have to die for this to end. 

16
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,650
  Have you been well?  

17
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,950
  As you can see, Hyung is doing well.  

18
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,360
  I’ll protect him from now on.  

19
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,920
  Ahn. You have to wake up. Lee Ahn!  

20
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:54,090
 Lee Ahn 

21
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,180
  Room 903 : Lee Ahn    

22
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:09,220
  Fire Extinguisher  

23
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,070
What took you so long?

24
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:47,700
Do you know how long I've been waiting for you?

25
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:53,170
Can you let go of me?

26
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:04,210
It would've been less embarrassing to fall on the floor.

27
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,600
I've been mastering that skill for years.

28
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,480
I can do a lot without using my hands, you know.

29
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,960
Hey, are you alright?

30
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,350
I heard from Dae Bong that you got stabbed.

31
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,720
I can handle this much.

32
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,940
You might not know this, but I've been through worse.

33
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,400
They say, ignorance makes people daring.

34
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,920
I'm worried I might stoop to your level.

35
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,150
Stoop, what?

36
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:40,410
I'm worried I might lose my pace to you.

37
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:43,940
What if training you makes me stupid too?

38
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,460
Have you decided to do it then?

39
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:51,710
Yes, that's what I came here to tell you.

40
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,010
Let's do it then.

41
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,010
I'll be looking forward to us working together from now on.

42
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:05,160
About my dad's case, when I think I've helped you reach a certain level,

43
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,650
can I ask for your help then?

44
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:13,440
Okay, let's do that.

45
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:34,050
  Room 903 : Lee Ahn 

46
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,750
- We've finished preparing for the meeting. 
 - Okay, let's go.

47
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,180
We'll investigate the two Kang Hee Sooks.

48
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:57,230
The first one is the real Kang Hee Sook, who was killed and left in a ditch four or five years ago.

49
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:01,500
The second one is the Kang Hee Sook imposter.

50
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,480
A woman who impersonated her and got a job at the Hanmin Care Home as a caregiver two years ago.

51
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,720
If the caregiver impersonated Kang Hee Sook, wouldn't she be the killer?

52
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,000
Did she also kill Park Soo Yeong, the body from the first suitcase?

53
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,150
Let's keep all options open.

54
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:20,680
I'll look into the Hanmin Care Home's Kang Hee Sook imposter, the one with the ring.

55
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,540
Ring?

56
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:27,810
There's no mention of her wearing a ring.

57
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:30,390
Who told you about that, is there a witness?

58
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:33,200
Oh, there is, you don't need to know though.

59
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,940
Then I'll look for the murdered Kang Hee Sook's family.

60
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:40,860
We need to know when she disappeared, to identify a suspect.

61
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:45,320
Yes. Okay.

62
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,780
Then let's share any info we come across.

63
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:53,270
I should go and visit Ahn.

64
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:56,540
Oh, okay... sir. 
  (Went from informal to formal) 

65
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,330
I'll call you. 
  (Informal) 

66
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:06,330
Did Prosecutor Kang just talk to you casually?

67
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:10,020
Did you think so too? It wasn't just me thinking that?

68
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,200
Why is he being so scary?

69
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,600
Doesn't speaking casually mean that he wants to get closer?

70
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,340
Right?

71
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,420
But why so suddenly?

72
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:25,090
Most people hate it when someone suddenly speaks casually.

73
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,070
Do you like it?

74
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:36,010
Let's go, we have work to do! 
   First part formal but ends casually) 

75
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,550
Ma'am.

76
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,480
Hold on.

77
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,270
What about what I asked you to investigate?

78
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,190
Come to the security center when you're discharged

79
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:51,550
and in the meantime, I'll think about how to train you.

80
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,820
Yoon Jae In.

81
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,470
Don't thank me, even if you want to.

82
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:01,860
It's not for you, I'm doing this purely for me.

83
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,690
It  doesn't matter.

84
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,490
I'm also doing this for you.

85
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,890
 What took you so long? 

86
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:54,460
 Do you know how long I've been waiting for you? 

87
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,740
Seriously, Yoon Jae In?

88
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,090
  You'll have a lot of questions, but I'm not ready to answer them yet. 

89
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:29,560
  Eat well. 

90
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:39,610
 It's not for you, I'm doing this purely for me. 

91
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,390
 It doesn't matter. 

92
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,230
 I'm also doing this for you. 

93
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,980
That’s a relief. You made a positive decision.

94
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,400
Ahn told me that

95
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,730
it's like a bottle of pills that has all kinds of human memories in it.

96
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:13,630
And that's why he doesn't know whether the one he picks would be a poison or a cure.

97
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:20,730
I don't know if what I have in my bottle is a poison or a cure either,

98
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:24,220
but since I need to find out now, I'll get to it gradually.

99
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:29,730
Yes, that's what I want as well.

100
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,920
Pardon?

101
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:41,190
By the way, who's the one who stabbed Ahn?

102
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,010
I heard he's been stalking you for a long time.

103
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:50,240
I'm not sure who he is either.

104
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:56,110
But what I know is that I no longer can

105
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,840
leave things all mixed up.

106
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,190
  Police Station  

107
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,710
Detective Eun.

108
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,430
Is that all? There’s no photograph of the suspect?

109
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:24,830
No, only the car was captured on the CCTVs at Prosecutor Kang's officetel  (apartment)  and the street.

110
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:29,100
I called the delivery company but they don't know who was driving it.

111
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,920
They'll be sending me the list of employees who came to work at the time.

112
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,980
What about where Ahn was stabbed?

113
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,770
There wasn't any CCTV there.

114
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:38,500
And the witnesses didn't see his face because he was wearing a cap.

115
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,330
Did you check the CCTV at the shops nearby, too?

116
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:42,870
How about the black boxes from the cars that were parked nearby?

117
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,200
Ah, I could have done that.

118
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,260
"Ah, I could have done that?"

119
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,630
That's pretty basic, don't you think?

120
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:53,760
If that's so, Prosecutor Kang would have checked already.

121
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,740
Prosecutor Kang?

122
00:12:54,740 --> 00:13:00,020
Yes, I called him to request some documents and it turns out they already made copies of all of this.

123
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,300
I mean, Prosecutor Kang's team did.

124
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,740
So Prosecutor Kang must've seen the suspect's face already if it was captured somewhere.

125
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,660
Yes, since it's basic.

126
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,880
We're here, you can get out.

127
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,650
Why are we here?

128
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,570
I have something to give you.

129
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,380
It's the notes I've been keeping about Ahn's ability.

130
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,990
I'm sure it'll help.

131
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:38,040
  September 10th, 2008  

132
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,540
Have you been writing all these up to now?

133
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,310
I want you to write in it from now on.

134
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,980
I have a lot of questions, but I'll ask you just one of them.

135
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:52,790
How much of his ability do I have to bring out?

136
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:56,390
Just enough so he'd be helpful to the investigation?

137
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:59,200
Or so that he'd be able to find the culprit?

138
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,500
Would that be enough?

139
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,570
Your mission would end when

140
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,910
Ahn is

141
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:12,930
able to do a psychometric reading on me.

142
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:23,720
Yes, I'll wait.

143
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,240
Just don't run away this time.

144
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,670
It got all cold.

145
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:44,850
  Closed on Sundays. Please call the number below for any inquiries.  

146
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:50,750
  Seoheun Community Security Center  

147
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,230
I haven't seen you in a long time.

148
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:10,010
I'm sorry

149
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,050
that I wasn't able to stop by.

150
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:15,410
I heard from your aunt that you became a police officer.

151
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:17,920
I'm proud of you, my daughter.

152
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:28,430
Now it's your turn to apologize to me.

153
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,950
And I'll cry again,

154
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:33,380
and I'll feel tormented for the next few days.

155
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,650
I haven't been here in a while

156
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:39,010
because I didn't want that.

157
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,340
I know.

158
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,510
I'll get to the point since we don't have much time.

159
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,230
I'm thinking of giving it a shot.

160
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:51,080
I won't run away from what happened that day anymore.

161
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:55,320
- I'll investigate what happened back then from the beginning.
- Jae In.

162
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:59,830
I considered living my life without thinking about you too.

163
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,710
But since the foundation is messed up, I can't seem to build anything on top.

164
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:10,030
Jae In, don't worry about it. I should be the only person to do that.

165
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,870
You should live your life.

166
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,790
What do you want to do now anyway?

167
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:17,230
I heard you've always been failing the parole review.

168
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,100
I know you do that intentionally.

169
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,260
It's not like that.

170
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,970
You think it's better to stay here.

171
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:25,740
You think you'd hurt me if you get out.

172
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:30,520
Are you planning to be trapped in here until you die?

173
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,360
Leave.

174
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,640
Don't come here anymore.

175
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,570
The people from the building...

176
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:49,360
I killed them all.

177
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:15,270
  Happy Correction, Happy Nation  

178
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,560
  Seoheun Hospital  

179
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,140
- What are you doing?
- You scared me.

180
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,000
Don't touch my curtain with your dirty hands!

181
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,130
Can you see without even touching now? I'll wash them, okay?

182
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,680
Move.

183
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,690
Geez!

184
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,140
He's such a drama queen.

185
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,210
The bill has already been paid for.

186
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:31,810
- It's been paid?
- Yes.

187
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:32,950
Was my brother here?

188
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:36,830
My gosh. Was he your brother?

189
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:40,250
Her reaction explains it was Seong Mo.

190
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,750
You seriously have the best life.

191
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,310
He pays for everything, he lets you use his car.

192
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,850
What will you do with your parents' insurance money anyway?

193
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:48,650
Is that what you're worried about?

194
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:50,710
You know my brother never came to see me while I was here, right?

195
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:53,090
I haven't seen my car in a while either.

196
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,350
Let's go home then.

197
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:03,920
Yes, you missed Oppa, didn't you? I missed you, too.

198
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,090
Yes, yes. Did he yell at you at all?

199
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:09,370
Are you okay? It's okay, Oppa is here.

200
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:12,350
Hey, what are you doing? Get in.

201
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,890
Okay.

202
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,050
Isn't this kind of weird? This is my car.

203
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:24,170
Anyone would think it's natural.

204
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:30,530
  "Mystery Science", "The World of Supernatural Powers"...  

205
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:31,960
  The greater the motivation, the stronger the abilities.  

206
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,320
 He gets tired when he uses his power a lot.  

207
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,390
  Using psychometry results in a negative worldview.  

208
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:47,360
♫  And somedays when I look into your eyes  ♫

209
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,480
 June 25th, 2008. 

210
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,550
 A child who lost his parents came to the nursing home. 

211
00:19:55,550 --> 00:20:00,970
♫  And I'm falling down with you  ♫

212
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:04,060
  He apparently lost his mom at a theme park. 

213
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:10,220
  But Ahn found out his address through psychometry. 

214
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:21,800
 But it turns out he was abandoned there by his parents.   

215
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,280
  Not missing but abandoned. 

216
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:35,730
 The police found the parents, but they wouldn't accept the child. 

217
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:50,190
♫  Come, listen to my voice into the night  ♫

218
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:58,360
♫  And hope I'll find a way  ♫

219
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:03,780
  It seems he's burdened by the truth he sees through his power. 

220
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:07,780
  In the world Ahn sees with his power, 

221
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:15,900
 love, joy, sadness are filled with lies. 

222
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,620
  Ahn hates crowded places, but we still went to the park in thick clothes because he feels uncomfortable in the orphanage. 

223
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,060
  Places Ahn never goes - amusement parks, theaters, parks, etc. 

224
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,470
   Places where he can feel many different people's emotions.  

225
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,740
I see.

226
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,970
- Why are we here?
- Because I have business here.

227
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:58,770
- Where are we?
- Bye.

228
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,350
  Seoheun Community Police Security Center 

229
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:05,010
Wow, you came straight to Yoon Jae In as soon as you left the hospital.

230
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:07,060
How pathetic.

231
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,960
 Guys! Let's go in. 

232
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,230
- Let's go inside now. 
 - What?

233
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:14,180
- Is that all you can do. 
 - Go on.

234
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,510
Alright. Did you have fun?

235
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:24,390
I think you have business here too. I'll get going.

236
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:36,100
Welcome. Are you all better now?

237
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:41,690
I'm completely fine now.

238
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,700
Yeah, right.

239
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,760
Just come eat this.

240
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,550
What is this?

241
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:52,950
Did you make these rice cakes for me?

242
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,960
This is so touching.

243
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,600
Thanks.

244
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:10,570
Oh gosh, what did you put in here?

245
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:15,510
It's mustard and you couldn't even 'read' it.

246
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:18,020
Mustard rice cakes, failed.

247
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:21,900
- Water. 
- Water? Here.

248
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,010
Fish sauce?

249
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:32,560
Fish sauce, failed.

250
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,640
This is disappointing.

251
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,140
What do you want from me?

252
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:41,870
Do you expect if I drank coffee I’d see beans being picked in Africa or what?

253
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:44,730
- Follow me.
 - To where?

254
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,850
After giving it a lot of thought,

255
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:50,920
I came to just one conclusion.

256
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,150
What conclusion?

257
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:54,400
Have you heard of the 10,000 Hour Rule?

258
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,760
In order to become an expert in one field, you've got to invest 10,000 hours of effort.

259
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,630
It could be for love.

260
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:05,290
 Seoheun Kindergarten 

261
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:09,280
So Hyun is dancing in front of the kids.

262
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,300
 For another, it could be for work. 

263
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,660
Either way, 10,000 hours of effort can make you an expert in any related field.

264
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,060
10,000 hours?

265
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,490
It takes 10 years, investing 3 hours a day,

266
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:23,100
5 years for 5 hours a day and 3 years for 10 hours a day.

267
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:26,750
Say you invest 24 hours solely in your goal,

268
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:29,730
it still will take 416.66667 days.

269
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:33,720
Does rounding it off to 417 days make you seem less smart?

270
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,180
When did you gain your ability?

271
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,380
When I was eight.

272
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,840
If you had put effort into refining your ability,

273
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,990
at least 3 hours a day,

274
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:44,050
you would have become an expert by now.

275
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:47,810
But instead, you wasted a lot of time letting it waste away.

276
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:49,970
Still, I went through some practices of trial and error.

277
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:51,570
I didn't just do nothing.

278
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:55,160
That's what I'm talking about. Even taking all that into consideration

279
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,120
you need to study with all your might for at least 3 months.

280
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,870
Study?

281
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:04,780
So, where is this place?

282
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,140
Like studying is the easiest thing in the world.

283
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,200
I'm not telling you to study calculus.

284
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,710
What is that?

285
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:16,390
I'm going to assign ten books a day.

286
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:20,490
Read them very carefully every day until I get off from work.

287
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:24,560
And write down your thoughts. It doesn't have to be pages long, so make sure you do it. Okay?

288
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:28,590
I thought we would be doing all kinds of psychometry to train my ability.

289
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:30,180
This is the first step.

290
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:33,490
Read them all, or you'll have to deal with the consequences.

291
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:37,400
I hate touching used books and you want me to flip through these page by page?

292
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,990
I'm telling you to do it because I know you hate it.

293
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:41,870
I read a lot of detective books, too.

294
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:45,970
- You mean comic books, like "Case Closed" and "Kindaichi Case Files"?  
 - That was sharp.

295
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:50,160
Those cases will never happen in our country.

296
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,770
- I read detective novels, too. 
 - Sherlock Holmes, Edgar Allan Poe stories, and

297
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:58,370
detective dramas like CSI are optional subjects.

298
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,830
This is the required subject.

299
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:04,310
Hey, this isn't the proper approach.

300
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:07,170
These are general topics while my ability is supernatural.

301
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:09,950
Exactly. You're a psychometrist.

302
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:12,820
You can read people's memories by touching them.

303
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,440
The same goes for objects, too.

304
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,220
Yes, that's what I can do.

305
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:19,420
That's why I think you should study more.

306
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,720
The more you know, the more you'll see.

307
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,230
You lack the basic knowledge to properly interpret your readings.

308
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:26,700
Is that your way of saying I'm stupid?

309
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,740
That's exactly what I'm saying.

310
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:32,100
The more you know and the smarter you become.

311
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,960
You'll be able to see others' pain and understand them.

312
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,570
You sound like a textbook.

313
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,890
The woman found in the suitcase,

314
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,920
have you thought about who she could be?

315
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:46,730
What about her family? Have you thought about why she died,

316
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,620
or the fear she felt?

317
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:51,060
The corpse...

318
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:54,490
No, I mean the person.

319
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:57,740
She's not a tool for you to test your abilities on.

320
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,470
 Kang Hee Sook 

321
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:28,390
What's this? You're back here again? Unbelievable.

322
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:31,660
I thought this case would solve itself once I identified the victim.

323
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,580
Nothing's easy.

324
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:36,750
Did you find the Kang Hee Sook imposter?

325
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:40,810
No. But there's one person from the care home that remembers her.

326
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:42,440
A facial sketch is being made.

327
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,540
And starting today, the case will be opened to the public.

328
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:49,840
Good. Do what you can to find her family.

329
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,350
I can't believe she has no one looking for her.

330
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:54,240
I feel terrible.

331
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,260
Why are you so sentimental today?

332
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:04,210
Don't worry too much, I'll be at your funeral for three days straight.

333
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,680
We don't die according to age,

334
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,200
you might die before I do.

335
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,570
It's pathetic to obsess over life, you know.

336
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:14,580
Fine, I'll die first then.

337
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,350
You live long and prosper.

338
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:19,380
Just don't forget to be at my funeral.

339
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:23,220
- So how's he doing? 
 - Ahn? He was discharged from the hospital today.

340
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,020
- Why do you ask? 
- Could the stabbing

341
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:29,970
affect his abilities in any way?

342
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:31,830
Why the sudden interest?

343
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:34,530
Didn't you tell me to never bring him around here anymore?

344
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:36,430
So?

345
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:40,560
Anyway, I'm heading home early today.

346
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:45,150
I'm taking the afternoon off.

347
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,130
Go ahead.

348
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,510
I don't have time to hang out with you today, I'm really busy.

349
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:55,560
I do have other friends, you know.

350
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:59,460
I'm taking the afternoon off, which means that the autopsy room will be empty.

351
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:09,190
Just in case, you need to come in here for some reason, use this.

352
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:12,990
You know how a key card works, right?

353
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,780
I'm off then.

354
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,530
You know, this is why I like you.

355
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:36,860
What's going on?

356
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,830
This must be out of order.

357
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:44,750
  Psychology Book  

358
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:49,860
What's that doing in there?

359
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:55,080
The thief called the police first?

360
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,360
We caught her stealing last month,

361
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,640
but we let it go thinking it was a mistake.

362
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,920
- But again— 
- Someone must be putting books in my bag.

363
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,130
Why does she always feel wronged?

364
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:09,570
This isn't the first time for her.

365
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:12,710
She either craves attention or is a kleptomaniac.

366
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:17,020
Listen. I'm telling you that it wasn't me!

367
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,520
Would this be a big score?

368
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,110
Should I help like last time?

369
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,190
Well, whatever.

370
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:25,880
Where were you sitting?

371
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:31,050
Over here, this is where I left my bag.

372
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:42,030
  Psychology Book 

373
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:06,100
Did you leave the table at any time?

374
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,120
I do so often

375
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,840
to grab a meal or to talk on the phone.

376
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,310
Excuse me.

377
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,780
I saw who put this book in the lady's backpack.

378
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,470
 Psychology Book   

379
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,810
The culprit is

380
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,340
a person with red colored nails.

381
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:44,100
Excuse me. May I see your nails?

382
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:50,380
Excuse me. May I see your nails?

383
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:57,240
There's no one here with red nail polish on.

384
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,770
That's impossible. I know what I saw.

385
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:01,960
Maybe the culprit already ran off?

386
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,830
I doubt it.

387
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:08,390
If someone deliberately placed this book in your bag

388
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:11,510
he or she would want to see the case unravel.

389
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:14,320
Wanting to witness the crime that he or she committed

390
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,700
is the psychology of a criminal.

391
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:19,370
How long are you going to keep this up?

392
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:22,480
I can't study because of the three of you.

393
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,550
Hold on.

394
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:35,440
Isn't that a nail tip on your pants?

395
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,800
What?

396
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,720
My gosh, what is this? Goodness!

397
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,690
Omo! I-It wasn't me.

398
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:50,590
As if.

399
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,390
If this isn't definite proof, I don't know what is.

400
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,280
Did she drop it?

401
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,610
She's not the culprit, is she?

402
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:24,220
How did you know?

403
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,430
There was someone I've been suspicious of.

404
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:39,720
Could I talk to you for a second?

405
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:42,160
Me?

406
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:46,160
When you showed me your fingernails, I noticed one of the tips were broken.

407
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:51,130
It looked like you broke it while you peeled off the fake nail in a hurry.

408
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:56,890
It's my habit to chew off my fingernails.

409
00:33:56,890 --> 00:34:01,850
You know DNA can be found from fingernails too, not just blood and hair, right?

410
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:08,060
You broke your fingernails and you're bleeding, too.

411
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:11,150
Should I officially submit the case and contact you after confirming the DNA?

412
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:14,950
Or would you like to apologize now and be done with it?

413
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:18,540
Hey, did you do that?

414
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:21,780
She's really obsessive.

415
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:25,250
She gives you a post-it note if she can hear you breathing.

416
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:29,820
She gives you a look if you shake your leg and she flips out when she hears a pen clicking noise.

417
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,930
I'm so sorry.

418
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:33,980
I'm sorry.

419
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,890
It seems like you're attracting all these cases.

420
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:40,900
But they're all so insignificant.

421
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,650
Anyway, you're the best, Officer.

422
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:49,400
I'd like to thank you as well.

423
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:55,640
 What did she say? 

424
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:10,060
What a nuisance.

425
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:13,600
I'll never act like that in libraries.

426
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,120
  Get it together. Do you love sleeping that much? 

427
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,650
  Can you stop sleeping?  

428
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:29,030
  Ji Soo Noona  

429
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,190
Where are you?

430
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:46,610
Library? With Officer Yoon?

431
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:49,380
You can't study psychometry like that.

432
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,870
I don't know.

433
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:57,010
Anyway, I'm under Officer Yoon's surveillance because of Prosecutor Kang's order.

434
00:35:57,010 --> 00:35:59,170
What's Prosecutor Kang thinking about anyway?

435
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:01,260
Nobody knows what he thinks.

436
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,560
Anyway, let's talk in person. Let's meet up later.

437
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,820
Later? Where?

438
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,790
In the autopsy room.

439
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:09,640
I'm always willing to go to the autopsy room.

440
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,550
 - See you later. 
- Okay.

441
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:15,560
Yes!

442
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:24,650
  Aren't you going to study?  

443
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,790
"Aren't you going to study?"

444
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,290
  Aren't you going to study?  

445
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:44,990
I got it. I got it!

446
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:47,560
Yes! I got it!

447
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,080
I'm going to!

448
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,830
I'm going to study, okay?

449
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:15,570
Officer Yoon is making Ahn study psychometry?

450
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:20,530
I think there's something going on between them.

451
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:24,290
Or is it the three of them? Including Prosecutor Kang?

452
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,300
What? Why is he there?

453
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:46,320
You probably remember the body in the black suitcase that was found in the stream in Seoeundong, Seoul.

454
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,130
Even though the body has been identified,

455
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:51,430
her family hasn't come forward yet.

456
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:54,950
Yes, the deceased woman, who presumably died four or five years ago,

457
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:58,680
was identified as Kang Hee Sook, who was 59 years old according to the fingerprints.

458
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:02,200
But we've been having difficulty investigating since it's unclear when she actually went missing.

459
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:06,750
Could you enlarge the picture so the viewers can get a better look?

460
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:10,060
If you know 59-year-old, Kang Hee Sook, who passed away,

461
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:13,960
or if you know her family, please contact us with any information.

462
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,070
That would be very helpful to the investigation.

463
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:20,000
We did some research on our own.

464
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,140
We found out that Kang Hee Sook was classified as missing

465
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:27,620
during the Hanmin Nursing Home fire two years ago.

466
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,830
What does this mean?

467
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:33,750
That's not a question I agreed to.

468
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:37,100
There was a report saying Kang Hee Sook, who went missing

469
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:40,840
during the Hanmin Nursing Home fire is not the same Kang Hee Sook as in the picture.

470
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:44,010
That means someone assumed the deceased

471
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:46,350
Kang Hee Sook's identity.

472
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:49,400
Could you explain this to the viewers so they could understand better?

473
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,420
That part of the investigation can't be revealed yet.

474
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:55,350
Please contact us with any information about

475
00:38:55,350 --> 00:39:00,020
deceased 59-year-old Kang Hee Sook, who died four or five years ago.

476
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:06,220
  Please contact us with information about Kang Hee Sook.

00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,700
He can't just exit like that, can he?

478
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:11,260
That shouldn't have been on camera.

479
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:15,560
I know it shouldn't have been,

480
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:19,240
but Daddy Long Legs is so charismatic.

481
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,480
Stop calling him, Daddy Long Legs.

482
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,290
Why?

483
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:24,000
Why do you call him, Daddy Long Legs, Auntie?

484
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,890
I think you're too old to be calling him, "Daddy."

485
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:31,840
You calling me "Auntie" makes even less sense.

486
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,290
What should I call you then?

487
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:35,500
Should I call you, Ms. Sook Ja?

488
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,630
How did this get here?

489
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,120
So gross.

490
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:44,120
You can just call me Teacher.

491
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:48,290
Everyone calls me, Music Teacher around here. Haven't you heard?

492
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:52,040
Teacher? You got scammed and cried at the police station

493
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:55,990
with your eye makeup running down your face. You're all grown up now.

494
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:59,410
What are you talking about? Officer Yoon heard everything.

495
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:00,350
You must be crazy.

496
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:03,930
What are you talking about? Did you two know each other?

497
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:06,380
No, we didn't know each other.

498
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,130
We just crossed paths once.

499
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,060
What are you doing here?

500
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:24,010
It's time for you to go home.

501
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:41,320
What's this? Title: Understanding and Analyzing Investigations.

502
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:45,750
Thoughts: Why did they put Chinese characters in the book?

503
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:49,190
There were too many Chinese characters. I couldn't read it.

504
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,990
Seriously.

505
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,080
Title: Crime Scenes.

506
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:57,710
Thoughts: The part with gun murders was very memorable.

507
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:06,860
You think a gun murder will ever happen in this country? Featuring Yoon Jae In?

508
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:11,620
Gun murders are as rare as locked room murders in this country.

509
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,490
Are you willing to learn or not?

510
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:18,020
I'll show you the real "Crime Scenes" and "Understanding and Analyzing Investigations."

511
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,850
Follow me.

512
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:29,590
 The door has been unlocked. 

513
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,730
I'm glad you came.

514
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:37,460
I was wondering if I should've called Officer Yoon, too, or not.

515
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,740
Thank you.

516
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,370
Of course, she came too.

517
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:43,010
We're already deep in this investigation.

518
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:44,820
Right?

519
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:57,250
Honestly, I don't expect a lot from him.

520
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:02,020
- He's come here about ten times already but with no luck. 
- Detective Eun?

521
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,330
Can you guess what he first saw through psychometry?

522
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:06,390
- It was the underwear size— 
- Noona!

523
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:12,720
But I realized it was a very important piece of information.

524
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,170
The undergarments he saw through psychometry

525
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:18,310
were the ones that belonged to the women who died in the ward.

526
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:21,800
And the woman who pretended to be Kang Hee Sook had brought them.

527
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,960
What do you mean?

528
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,620
That woman with the thin ring,

529
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:27,570
the woman you saw through psychometry two years ago,

530
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:29,760
the Kang Hee Sook imposter.

531
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:34,650
The Kang Hee Sook imposter?

532
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:36,600
I saw it on the news earlier.

533
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:40,190
Someone had been living as Kang Hee Sook who already died.

534
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,570
Yes.

535
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:48,430
That woman, who Ahn saw through psychometry,

536
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:50,930
was using a dead woman's name.

537
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:55,250
I think Prosecutor Kang is trying to train you so he can use you.

538
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:57,850
But I'm not patient like that. I need to know now.

539
00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:03,950
Who was it and why did that person have to kill her and live her life instead?

540
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:09,320
Okay. I have no idea what you're talking about, but I just need to have a look.

541
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,060
Right?

542
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:18,230
Hold on.

543
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:24,850
- I can't agree with your method either.
 - What?

544
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:28,900
Ahn might be able to find out something about her right now,

545
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,760
such as how she looked when she was murdered,

546
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,500
and something she experienced while she was alive.

547
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:36,790
But I'm sure it'd be confusing.

548
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:38,530
He probably wouldn't know what he's seeing.

549
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:40,030
- So?
- So, what?

550
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:41,810
You want to wait 10,000 hours?

551
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:44,560
- I can't wait.
- No, wait.

552
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:50,530
- Show us the investigation materials you have so far.
- What?

553
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:53,630
I know this is a rare opportunity for both of us.

554
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:59,780
So if you just give me an hour, I can make Ahn understand this case.

555
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:03,740
He'll definitely be able to see a lot more.

556
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:08,480
Don't worry. Just trust me.

557
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:12,870
I understand what you're trying to say.

558
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:15,710
I'm going to get some materials so just wait here.

559
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:27,750
You're pretty impressive, Yoon Jae In.

560
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:34,080
You—

561
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,720
I didn't seem nervous in front of her, right?

562
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,040
Was I okay?

563
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:41,030
Yeah, you were really cool, Yoon Jae In.

564
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:43,700
What do you mean cool?

565
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:46,690
I didn't understand a single thing she said.

566
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:47,570
What?

567
00:44:47,570 --> 00:44:51,710
You can't just touch the corpse and leave here. This is such an opportunity.

568
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:54,670
It could be my last chance to transfer to Violent Crimes.

569
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:59,160
I'm going to use you and find out everything I need to know about this case—

570
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:03,420
Oh, so it's like that?

571
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:06,620
You're going to train me and transfer to Violent Crimes.

572
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:07,480
You see...

573
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:12,080
So the only people who can help you get there

574
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,240
are the two of us?

575
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:20,420
It's become a habit to seem smart.

576
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:23,680
I guess I just rambled on without thinking.

577
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,030
Fine.

578
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:28,080
It's not too late to start thinking now.

579
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:35,180
Who this person is,

580
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:38,980
why they had to be laying here,

581
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:44,230
let's find out—together.

582
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:53,730
What are you doing here?

583
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:57,140
To check the sketch of the Kang Hee Sook imposter.

584
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:09,310
They could've told me first.

585
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:21,930
I saw you on TV. Your personality came out.

586
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:23,460
You looked great on TV.

587
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:27,020
You threw stuff and left. That was quite a scene.

588
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:30,530
Someone leaked our information, tell your colleagues to be more careful.

589
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:33,860
It wasn't from the police. You know how meticulous I am.

590
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:37,460
It's the prosecutors you should be concerned about.

591
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:41,890
What are you doing here at this hour?

592
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:43,970
  Investigation Notes 

593
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:47,140
I suddenly missed Doctor Hong.

594
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:50,600
I heard Dr. Hong left early today.

595
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:55,870
Tell me where you're going with our investigation data then, Detective Meticulous?

596
00:46:57,110 --> 00:46:58,910
Oh you see...

597
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:05,040
Officer Yoon and Ahn are in the autopsy room right now.

598
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:10,190
I'm assuming Ahn didn't ask to see the case related evidence.

599
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:11,310
I'm assuming it was Officer Yoon?

600
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:15,770
Yeah. She said she couldn't help Ahn with his psychometry without more information.

601
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:17,950
As I expected...

602
00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:24,990
It's Officer Yoon, isn't it?

603
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:26,680
What is?

604
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:33,050
The one you want Ahn to do psychometry on.

605
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:34,520
That's right.

606
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:38,830
Why? Why is it her?

607
00:47:45,110 --> 00:47:47,190
We have such a polar opposite relationship.

608
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:50,120
You know everything I'm thinking

609
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:53,230
and I don't know anything you're thinking, if you don't tell me.

610
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:04,720
Officer Yoon's father is

611
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:08,770
Yoon Tae Ha.

612
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,960
The Yeongseong Apartment case's

613
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:14,370
criminal.

614
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:20,570
I'll head to the autopsy room with the sketch.

615
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:52,190
I think the immediate cause was the injury to the back of her head.

616
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:55,080
Go easy.

617
00:48:55,990 --> 00:49:00,580
I'm saying this person probably died because they got hit on the head and lost a lot of blood, got it?

618
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:02,410
So the culprit killed her and then put her in the suitcase?

619
00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:04,380
Then dropped her in the river.

620
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:05,980
Didn't you watch Prosecutor Kang's briefing on the news show?

621
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:10,760
Her body was found four to five years after her death.

622
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:13,060
She must have had something to say.

623
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:14,970
Say?

624
00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:19,020
She was down in the water for such a long time before I found her.

625
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:24,070
It means she has something to show me.

626
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:27,220
All right. I hope you see it and brag so much about it.

627
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:28,600
I will.

628
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:33,750
Bragging is habitual and infectious you know.

629
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:55,030
What took you so long? Don't count the time we missed because of you.

630
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:57,430
Start counting to an hour from right now.

631
00:49:57,430 --> 00:49:59,070
Okay?

632
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:01,820
All right.

633
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:13,760
  Officer Yoon's father is Yoon Tae Ha. 

634
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,020
 The culprit in the Yeongseong case. 

635
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,010
 Suitcase Body Dump Case 

636
00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:20,220
 Victim: Kang Hee Sook 

637
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:23,170
Kang Hee Sook. Here's the cause of death.

638
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:27,510
Blood loss from the back of her head. Hey, you were right!

639
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:35,660
Is there anything revealed other than her identity and the cause?

640
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:37,190
What?

641
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:39,120
No.

642
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:43,320
By any chance can I see some records of the fire at the nursing home?

643
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:46,260
I heard someone disguised herself as this woman and worked there.

644
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:48,580
Right, the woman with the ring that I saw.

645
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:49,970
Okay.

646
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:57,230
The sketch of this woman came out.

647
00:50:57,230 --> 00:51:00,100
Prosecutor Kang is on his way here with it.

648
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:02,350
What? Hyung is?

649
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:05,590
He knows you’re in the autopsy room.

650
00:51:05,590 --> 00:51:08,530
He wasn’t angry, right?

651
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:10,700
For coming without permission?

652
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,200
Don’t worry.

653
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:15,180
It was the most sincere smile

654
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:18,060
I've ever seen since I've known him.

655
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:21,960
She was more tender-eyed than this.

656
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:23,350
Like this?

657
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:26,200
And she was bit slimmer.

658
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:29,930
 Right, about this much. 

659
00:51:54,520 --> 00:52:00,520
0-5-1-2-0-3.

660
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:06,660
Found you.

661
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:18,340
 Composite Sketch of Kang Hee Sook Imposter 

662
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:22,930
It's out, here you go.

663
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:40,450
Hey, this person is a witness.

664
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:46,740
 Witness: Kim Gab Yong 

665
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:48,760
What's taking him so long?

666
00:53:50,990 --> 00:53:53,570
Let's start without him.

667
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:07,090
 Hold on. Kang Hee Sook, I see you're not dead yet. 

668
00:55:07,090 --> 00:55:11,720
 I'm sorry, but my client wants no loose ends. 

669
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:38,770
She was on the floor bleeding from her head.

670
00:55:38,770 --> 00:55:40,930
Don't rush, take your time.

671
00:55:40,930 --> 00:55:42,940
What did you see?

672
00:55:44,030 --> 00:55:45,900
Black suitcases.

673
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:55,100
 A Hammer. 

674
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:08,350
And a man.

675
00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:17,850
A man? What kind of man?

676
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:37,800
I've seen him before.

677
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,670
It's him, I'm sure of it.

678
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:51,150
Kim Gab Yong?

679
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:52,630
Are you sure it's him?

680
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:54,130
I'm sure.

681
00:56:54,130 --> 00:56:58,400
This man killed Kang Hee Sook.

682
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:03,030
Isn't he the witness in the Hanmin Care Home fire case?

683
00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:06,750
Then why was he killed?

684
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:12,080
  You were at the care home when the fire broke out. 

685
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,920
  I'm an insurance planner. 

686
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,750
  I'd like to hear your witness statement again. 

687
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:19,650
  I know it's a hassle, but could you come to my office? 

688
00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:23,650
  Your name was on his call log, so we contacted you first. 

689
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:26,680
  He must have been attacked while on the way to us. 

690
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,990
I still remember it clearly.

691
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:33,500
He disappeared right after talking to Prosecutor Kang on the phone.

692
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,590
Why would he...

693
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:51,270
 - Lee Ahn! 
- Ahn! 

694
00:57:51,270 --> 00:57:52,520
 - Ahn! 
- Hey! 

695
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:54,230
 Ahn! 

696
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:56,000
 - Ahn! 
- Why? 

697
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,960
 Ahn! Ahn! 

698
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,290
 Lee Ahn! Lee Ahn! 

699
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:01,090
 What's wrong with him? 

700
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:02,740
Ahn! Lee Ahn!

701
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:04,400
Ahn!

702
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,240
Prosecutor Kang, Ahn collapsed!

703
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:17,910
 I'm going to give it a go. 

704
00:58:17,910 --> 00:58:21,610
 I won't run away or avoid it.  

705
00:58:21,610 --> 00:58:23,570
 I'll find out what happened. 

706
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:28,210
 I considered living my own life and forgetting about you, 

707
00:58:29,350 --> 00:58:32,310
 but my mind isn't at ease. 

708
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:36,140
 Everything I do feels like a castle made of sand. 

709
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:41,340
He's being a drama queen again.

710
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:43,650
Just go to bed already.

711
00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:46,800
The guards will make their rounds soon.

712
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:52,070
They already made their last round. They're done for the day.

713
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:55,170
Eh, now you're keeping me up as well. Darn you.

714
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,390
Lee Ahn, are you okay?

715
00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:40,400
Can you hear me?

716
00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:51,390
So, Kim Gab Yong

717
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:55,610
killed the two women in the suitcases with a hammer?

718
00:59:55,610 --> 01:00:00,140
Yes, but it sounded like he was following orders.

719
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:03,440
"I'm sorry, but my client wants no loose ends."

720
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:05,820
 I'm sorry, but my client wants no loose ends. 

721
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:08,650
So someone ordered the hit on those two women?

722
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:11,000
Oh, where's the sketch for the fake Kang Hee Sook?

723
01:00:12,850 --> 01:00:15,120
Did you see this person, too?

724
01:00:16,830 --> 01:00:19,090
No, I told you everything I saw.

725
01:00:19,090 --> 01:00:21,200
Is she the Kang Hee Sook imposter?

726
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,320
Yes.

727
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:27,240
Take a closer look. Is she the woman you saw when you performed a reading on the Hanmin Care Home fire victim?

728
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:28,720
I told you I didn't see a face.

729
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:30,860
I was just double-checking.

730
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:35,910
Could she have ordered the killings in order to assume their identities?

731
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:41,080
Anyway, Kim Gab Yong killed the real Kang Hee Sook and let the imposter take her place.

732
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:44,470
He gave a witness statement for the Hanmin Care Home fire.

733
01:00:44,470 --> 01:00:47,990
It's likely that he was lying.

734
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:51,250
Then who on earth is this woman?

735
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:53,970
We should start by looking into Kim Gab Yong again.

736
01:00:53,970 --> 01:00:59,730
We got everything we need from Kang Hee Sook and we're at a standstill in finding the imposter.

737
01:01:02,350 --> 01:01:04,360
That's exactly what I was going to say.

738
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:06,460
Me, too.

739
01:01:07,350 --> 01:01:09,990
I'm sorry. That was impudent of me, wasn't it?

740
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:13,280
Nonsense. You were right on the spot.

741
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:16,990
I'm sorry to interrupt you guys,

742
01:01:16,990 --> 01:01:23,650
but did she mean that there's no way to find Kang Hee Sook's imposter?

743
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:25,610
What?

744
01:01:25,610 --> 01:01:28,310
He saw the crime scene for us.

745
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:31,400
I guess we can let this much stupidity slide.

746
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:33,320
I'm sorry.

747
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:35,710
What are you apologizing for?

748
01:01:35,710 --> 01:01:36,580
Yeah, why?

749
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:40,490
Well, it's my job to teach and guide him now.

750
01:01:41,410 --> 01:01:45,880
Yeah, according to the 10,000 Hour Rule, you only have to wait 416.666666667 days

751
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:47,370
and I'll turn over a few leaves.

752
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:50,120
- A new leaf! 
- A new leaf! 
- A new leaf!

753
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:56,740
You two did a great job today.

754
01:01:56,740 --> 01:02:02,270
At this rate, it won't take as many as 416.666666667 days.

755
01:02:02,270 --> 01:02:03,520
That's what I said.

756
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:06,650
This goes for Ahn but also you too, Officer Yoon.

757
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:11,000
Hang in there.

758
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,780
Sure thing. I'll wipe him down and keep oiling him some more.

759
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:15,610
I'm not a machine, you know.

760
01:02:15,610 --> 01:02:18,040
Officer Yoon, I'll leave him in your hands.

761
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:22,040
- Let's go.  
- Hold on!

762
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:24,600
Aren't we heading home? Don't you have anything to say?

763
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:27,450
Just look. Oh, wrong side.

764
01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:31,420
Look. We've never talked once since I was attacked.

765
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:36,820
I'm sure you have a lot of questions, but she has just as many.

766
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:38,420
That's right. He's mine tonight.

767
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:40,290
So move.

768
01:02:46,070 --> 01:02:48,340
And he calls me his brother.

769
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:50,170
You saw that, right?

770
01:02:54,910 --> 01:02:57,630
Help me catch a cab, will you?

771
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:01,550
Why did he kill her?

772
01:03:01,550 --> 01:03:05,940
And why did he get killed too?

773
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:08,560
- What? 
- He killed two people.

774
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:11,440
That man, Kim Gab Yong.

775
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:16,090
Then someone else murdered him.

776
01:03:22,850 --> 01:03:28,380
The Kang Hee Sook imposter you performed psychometry on in the autopsy room,

777
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:31,130
the woman with the ring.

778
01:03:31,130 --> 01:03:33,730
Do you remember anything else?

779
01:03:35,850 --> 01:03:39,510
It was two years ago. Two long years.

780
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:42,770
It would be weird to remember.

781
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:49,180
I remember everything about you from two years ago.

782
01:03:55,850 --> 01:03:59,490
What is that supposed to mean?

783
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:07,340
You were really weird.

784
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:16,730
Yes, Auntie.

785
01:04:16,730 --> 01:04:19,330
 Try not to be too surprised. 

786
01:04:19,330 --> 01:04:24,060
 My brother-in-law... No, your Dad... 

787
01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:26,790
Taxi...

788
01:04:26,790 --> 01:04:28,500
Taxi.

789
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:31,280
Taxi!

790
01:04:32,010 --> 01:04:33,600
What's the matter?

791
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:35,960
I have to go.

792
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:40,220
Is it that again? Hyperventilation?

793
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:42,540
Do you have a paper bag?

794
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:44,690
No.

795
01:05:06,220 --> 01:05:08,210
Don't worry.

796
01:05:08,210 --> 01:05:11,060
I won't touch you until you let me.

797
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:23,230
♫  And somedays when I look into your eyes  ♫

01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:28,540
♫  Why do I keep seeing through the past  ♫

799
01:05:28,540 --> 01:05:31,480
 He is Psychometric 

800
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:37,830
♫  And I'm falling down with you  ♫

801
01:05:47,850 --> 01:05:54,010
♫  Sometimes when I feel you in my hands  ♫

802
01:05:55,660 --> 01:06:00,240
♫  I can feel your sorrow through your hand  ♫

803
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:03,350
 The people in the apartment, I killed them all. 

804
01:06:03,350 --> 01:06:06,400
 Why are you being so weak? 

805
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:07,650
 You know who it is, don't you? 

806
01:06:07,650 --> 01:06:11,530
 I hate you wasting your life because of me, even more. 

807
01:06:11,530 --> 01:06:13,900
 I will find him and kill him. 

808
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:16,070
 I think he wants to ask for help. 

809
01:06:16,070 --> 01:06:20,160
 Will Prosecutor Kang and Detective Eun come too next time? 

810
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:23,870
 Since we're here, raise a hand if you know Kim Gab Yong. 

811
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:32,910
♫  And hope, I'll find a way  ♫
