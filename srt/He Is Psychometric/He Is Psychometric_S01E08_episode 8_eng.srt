  Please Give Way For The Fire Trucks 
  December 3rd, 2005, 4 PM  

5
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:50,730
Oh dear.

6
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,290
You're working hard.

7
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,760
You're getting off work already?

8
00:00:58,010 --> 00:00:59,860
This kid,

9
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:03,710
he came barging into the station.

10
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:07,120
My dad caught a lot of bad guys today!

11
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,990
That is something you can say louder.

12
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,450
That kid's sitting there like that again.

13
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,140
Who is he?

14
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,500
Detective, I may be overstepping my bounds,

15
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,380
but do you mind if I ask you for a favor?

16
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,270
He moved into Unit 701 a month ago.

17
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:35,710
He moved in the middle of the night, but the mother was nowhere to be seen.

18
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:39,810
Meanwhile, he sits there looking into the distance all day and night.

19
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:42,980
Hi.

20
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,720
I'm not someone suspicious. I live in Unit 1501.

21
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,930
My dad is this kind of person.

22
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:51,630
So what?

23
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,680
Why are you sitting in the cold without a coat?

24
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,830
This is the best place to see people enter and exit the apartment building.

25
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,020
Who are you waiting for?

26
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,250
Your Mom? Dad?

27
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,300
I’m not waiting for anyone.

28
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:15,030
Could you move aside? You're blocking my view.

29
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:26,040
Just in case, call me if there's anything I can do to help.

30
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,200
Let’s go.

31
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:46,410
- Dad! 
 - Jae In!

32
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,640
It’s cold today, isn’t it?

33
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,100
  Let's go. 

34
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,010
  Seoul Metropolitan Police 
 Lee Jung Rok  

35
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,750
 Psychometry: An ability to measure and interpret the essence or history of a person or thing through touch.

 He is Psychometric 
 - Episode 8 - 

37
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,630
Prosecutor Kang, what are you talking about?

38
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,390
I know organizations like these have collusive ties with the police.

39
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:31,170
If you don't authorize the reinforcements,

40
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,320
Detective Eun and I have no choice but to suspect you.

41
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,190
- Prosecutor Kang! 
 - The suitcase murder case and the organization are unquestionably related.

42
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:43,160
We also believe that the Hanmin Care Home fire is somehow related too.

43
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,350
So, I'm reminding you that you should know when to put an end to it.

44
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:50,540
Prosecutor Kang, is this going to be the last case you take? If not, what's with this rudeness?

45
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,660
I'm telling you this because I have often seen such cases

46
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,130
that if you have a very long tail, not only will your tail get stepped on,

47
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:59,250
but also your tail will strangle your own neck.

   YSS Construction  

49
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:08,210
We have bodies that the public is very interested in, two of them.

50
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:10,500
You're the one who blew this out of proportion.

51
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,060
You went on TV and made a fool of yourself.

52
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,850
About tomorrow, the media will start saying the police are incompetent.

53
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:21,130
Don't you think we'll need to arrest someone?

54
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:33,730
Is the person who said they saw Kim Gab Yong kill Kang Hee Sook and Park Soo Young

55
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:34,850
a credible witness?

56
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:40,240
I can guarantee the credibility of that witness's statement.

57
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,770
Let's make this clear.

58
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:51,530
I'm not giving you back-up because I'm afraid you think I'm connected to any gang.

59
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,730
Oh, whatever. Just take them all.

60
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,280
I'll walk so stop pushing!

61
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,760
Get in!

62
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:18,450
How did you convince my dad, for him to send that many officers?

63
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:22,940
It's more ironic that he needed to be convinced to arrest people like this.

64
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:26,540
Dad's putting safety first because he's getting old.

65
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,170
He was so eager when he was young.

66
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:32,720
Dad... Dad.

67
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,160
I crossed the line between work and family again, didn't I?

68
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,970
You said that your father passed away early, right?

69
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,160
What was he like?

70
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:56,200
For today's field training, use me.

71
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,540
No...

72
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:11,440
The most sensitive part is this, right?

73
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:20,700
Hey. What are you doing?

74
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,480
This is really awkward for me right now.

75
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,700
You’re wrong.

76
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,040
It’s not there.

77
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,790
I told you.

78
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,470
The most sensitive part...

79
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,020
is here.

80
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,050
Hey, you!

81
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,590
I usually don't do things halfway.

82
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,800
Still, this is too...

83
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,450
I was trying hard to step on the brake, but you told me to go.

84
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,650
I've only been looking at you from the start.

85
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,680
Why I said I'd wait for you,

86
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,110
why I'm following you around with the excuse of improving my abilities,

87
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,100
- you know it too.
- Yeah, I know.

88
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:37,130
I'm the one who's using your feelings to my advantage.

89
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,170
That's it?

90
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,370
You're saying you had no feelings for me?

91
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,570
I don't think so.

92
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,280
What did you see?

93
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,370
Memories all about me.

94
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:57,060
A panoramic view of when we met up until now.

95
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,150
No way.

96
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:02,810
W-Why w-would you see such a thing?

97
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,730
There's no way. No way.

98
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:07,530
I didn't think about you at all though?

99
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:14,820
How many negatives do you use in one sentence?

100
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,410
I really

101
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,850
only thought about you?

102
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:28,010
You saw all that?

103
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,520
What should I do?

104
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,040
You!

105
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,660
So, you really were thinking about me.

106
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,110
What?

107
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,320
You didn't see anything, did you?

108
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,260
What do you expect after leaving in such a hurry?

109
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,950
If I were that good, why would I–

110
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:56,640
That really hurt!

111
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,920
How could you lie about that?

112
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,070
- Why you! 
 - Hey, hey! You don't know about reading questions?

113
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:05,070
Bait you throw out to get the answer you want.

114
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,380
Reading questions!

115
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,240
It was in the book you recommended.

116
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,710
I remembered and applied something I learned. You should praise me, not kick me.

117
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:15,050
You're wrong. It's "leading questions", not "reading questions".

118
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:17,810
Reading questions? Reading?

119
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:21,600
Hey, you might trip.

120
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,780
I guess we caught them all. Let's go.

121
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:31,130
"I guess"? That doesn't suit your usual thorough self.

122
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:32,590
Are you better at making jokes

123
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:36,010
or did you learn how to be snarky?

124
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,810
If it was funny, then I succeeded.

125
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:41,730
If you thought I was being snarky, then that's a plus too.

126
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:44,700
Kang Seong Mo. You really...

127
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,240
Why?

128
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,960
I think you've made a change for the better,

129
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,830
but why do I feel so uneasy?

130
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,900
You've definitely changed.

131
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,360
I wanted to be the one to change you.

132
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,960
Now I think

133
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,690
- it began when you met Yoon Jae In again. 
 - Eun Ji Soo.

134
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:08,930
I'll look around some more. You can leave first.

135
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,200
How could you not see anything?

136
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,500
When it was such a big deal for me?

137
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,590
Still, I think I gained something big.

138
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,650
Next time, let's do it with no warning.

139
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:30,600
I get a better reading when my mind is blank, not when there's a countdown.

140
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,760
If you need it to be sudden, I have to do it to you?

141
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,130
That's right.

142
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,960
You're crazy.

143
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,280
You want me to do that? No way.

144
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:45,970
You just have to touch me whenever. Does that require you to be crazy?

145
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:50,220
Oh. I thought...

146
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,940
What are you thinking?

147
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,620
You act so pure and innocent, but you're so perverted.

148
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:02,300
The more I think about it, you dragged me down to your level.

149
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,940
My level of thinking is just the same as yours.

150
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,760
Wait for me.

151
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,700
I also have to go this way, you know.

152
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,990
Pervert.

153
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,080
- Noona. 
- What's going on? Why are you here?

154
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,950
I'm really sorry.

155
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:29,810
Ahn didn't do anything wrong, I'm the one who brought him here.

156
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:33,900
How did you know this place is connected to the suitcase murder?

157
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,240
I'm not sure if it was good or bad luck,

158
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,020
I got to know about it coincidentally.

159
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,710
Well, luck is also a skill. As long as you're not hurt, it's fine.

160
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,270
Let's go.

161
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:54,020
Noona, why are you behaving like this? I'd rather have you get angry or curse at me.

162
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:58,250
I wanted to do that but I'm not going to.

163
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,940
I want to show my respectable side to  Constable Yoon.

164
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,100
In front of her? Why?

165
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,270
Is it strange for a Lieutenant to want to look

166
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:10,390
respectable in front of a rookie?

167
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:13,450
You don't have to bother. She has a crush on you anyway

168
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,490
and became a police officer because of that.

169
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,900
A crush on me?

170
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,310
Then, Constable Yoon, do you perhaps like women?

171
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,840
What?

172
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,470
What a bother.

173
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:30,390
Nothing, let's go eat.

174
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,170
We confiscated all their data.

175
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,650
Look for any information on Park Soo Young and Kang Hee Sook first.

176
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:39,920
- And if you find anything on the fake Kang Hee Sook, report it immediately. 
 - Yes, Sir.

177
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,900
Hurry, hurry!

178
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:45,310
Regardless of Kim Gab Yong, let's take down this gang.

179
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:46,700
Yes.

180
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,090
But I don't see Detective Eun.

181
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,540
It seems like you were too preoccupied to notice,

182
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,080
but it'd be best for you to avoid Detective Eun for awhile.

183
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,200
- Why?
- Think about it carefully.

184
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,710
What did you do to make her want to grab your collar?

185
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,900
No way.

186
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,790
Did she hear me gossip about her?

187
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,210
Thank you.

188
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,080
Hurry up and eat, I have to go back to the station.

189
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,620
Okay.

190
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,900
Eat slowly.

191
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,660
Because you said to eat quickly, she's swallowing it all.

192
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,570
I'm sorry, take it slow, take it slow.

193
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:36,780
I know that you are really busy.

194
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,700
She's arrested a truckload of guys,

195
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,360
so she has statements to take and evidence to go through. You should eat up, too.

196
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,750
More than being busy,

197
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:47,200
I'm going back because there is someone I need to teach a lesson or two today.

198
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,300
I hate being stabbed in the back the most.

199
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,720
There's someone who did worse than us?

200
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,230
So how far have you guys progressed in your lessons?

201
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,310
It's going well.

202
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:11,030
Both in theory and practice.

203
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,860
There hasn't been much progress yet.

204
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,000
You know how unpredictable he can be.

205
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,240
My ability improves with us just being together. I told you, didn't I?

206
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,950
The deeper our relationship gets, the more my ability—

207
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,400
This isn't the unexpected physical contact I talked about.

208
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,220
You should apply a little more strength like you learned at the police academy.

209
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,620
Yes.

210
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,750
I didn't know you were the type to suck up to others.

211
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,300
How sly of you.

212
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,010
Ma'am, it's really good.

213
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:51,300
 They don't know yet  

214
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,850
 what connection they have? 

215
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,210
It's a little salty though, isn't it?

216
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,640
 Fake Passports, Fake ID Cards 

217
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,940
  Authorized Personnel Only   

218
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,690
 Prosecutor Kang Seong Mo. 

219
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,680
Here.

220
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,940
It's the CCTV clip you talked about

221
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:58,860
But... Why do you need this every time?

222
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,340
Hello.

223
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,700
Here is your fried chicken.

224
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,720
You should eat it here. We welcome kids in our store.

225
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,410
Eun Sol is sleeping.

226
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:14,500
Then you should have asked for delivery, why did you come out with a child in this cold?!

227
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,150
If you deliver for only half a chicken, what will you have left?

228
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,620
It won't even be enough to pay for gas.

229
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,900
You should worry about yourself, not me.

230
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,010
Forget it. Just find someone to date.

231
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:28,050
Just because you have a kid,

232
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,480
is it a crime?

233
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,550
Oh! It's so cold!

234
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,830
Can you stop following me around?

235
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,720
Must I say I don't like it and that it's bothersome?

236
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,090
Will you only understand after these harsh words?

237
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:44,480
I'm sorry.

238
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,690
Why is she like that? Wow.

239
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,230
Here.

240
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,310
Half a chicken, right?

241
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:09,600
You're rich, so can't you order a whole chicken or something?

242
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,200
I don't ask for deliveries, though.

243
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,920
I know you come here by yourself because I fuel my car for free if I deliver it to your gas station.

244
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,070
Do you think I don't know what you're thinking?

245
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,970
Anyway, rich people are even stingier.

246
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:23,000
Gosh. That's not true. I'll fuel your car for free if you come next time.

247
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,750
Instead, don't let So Hyun know that I'm a regular here.

248
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,000
She thinks that you are following here around though.

249
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,180
She thinks you're a stalker. If there is a misunderstanding you need to explain.

250
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,120
She's someone with a lot of pride.

251
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,550
She might be embarrassed if she finds out it's a misunderstanding,

252
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:40,520
so just pretend you don't know.

253
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,000
I'll come tomorrow morning.

254
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,190
Tomorrow is my day off. Let's meet somewhere other than the library.

255
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,040
Where?

256
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,000
A place you hate the most.

257
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,030
The places I hate the most are crowded areas.

258
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:59,100
Movie theaters, amusement parks, firework shows, and famous restaurants.

259
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,820
Come to think of it, they're all places for a date.

260
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,280
I'm going.

261
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,250
Go safely.

262
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:09,560
  Recruiting Students!  

263
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,660
This fell off.

264
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,920
  Singing, Guitar, Wire Art, and Yoga classes  

265
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,400
Should I at least start playing the guitar again?

266
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,770
You scared me.

267
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:24,580
I used to sing C'est Si Bon's music back in the day.

268
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,170
Did anyone ask?

269
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:31,410
The singing class might be canceled due to a lack of students.

270
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,800
Granny Kim passed away a few days ago.

271
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,800
Her absence doesn't mean it'll be canceled.

272
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,430
You don't seem to know.

273
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:42,720
The grannies were all shocked and switched to the yoga classes.

274
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,160
R-Really?

275
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,690
It's all a lie when they say they want to die early.

276
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:49,800
Well, should I register for your singing classes?

277
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,540
No thanks.

278
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,260
Why are you doing this?

279
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,450
Get on. I'm also on my way to the security center.

280
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:01,300
Are you crazy? Why would I get on a bike with another person's man? You're ridiculous.

281
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,460
What other person's man?

282
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,970
It's been years since I filed my divorce papers.

283
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:09,640
What are you whispering behind me, making me feel annoyed?

284
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,360
You badmouthed me, didn't you?

285
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,580
I'll be going ahead then.

286
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,100
Geez, what's wrong with you?

287
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,460
It's a thief! My gosh.

288
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,710
He's so weird!

289
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:52,880
What am I applying right now?

290
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,700
But it's still pretty.

291
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,600
 I was trying hard to step on the brakes, but you told me to go. 

292
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,670
 I've only been looking at you from the start. 

293
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:14,640
 Why I said I'd wait for you, 

294
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,980
 why I'm following you around with the excuse of improving my abilities, 

295
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:21,030
 you know it too. 

296
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,520
Why is he always so straightforward?

297
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:29,890
Because of that, it's even harder for me to touch him.

298
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,290
How handsome.

299
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:56,060
I'll be back, watch over the house.

300
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:59,190
Just like last time, if someone strange comes in,

301
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:01,070
just look at his face

302
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,340
rather than getting into a fight you can't win.

303
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:07,540
Then I will pet you and identify the person.

304
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,240
Got it?

305
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:12,550
Now eat your food.

306
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:25,350
 No class for today. Study hard until I contact you again. 

307
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,780
You can't do this. You said we were practicing outdoors today.

308
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:34,100
We'll practice after going through all the theory so just know that.

309
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,530
  1-DAY PASS  

310
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:45,650
He's so quick-witted.

311
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:51,050
Darn it. All my anticipation was fruitile.

312
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:53,980
You mean, futile.

313
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,680
Just don't use words that you don't know.

314
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,940
Why do you keep looking ignorant?

315
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,480
You seem to be taking that often these days.

316
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,280
It's because of the headaches.

317
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,940
I heard that yesterday you were at the site with Constable Yoon.

318
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:11,390
Wow, I don't understand why Ji Soo can't keep a secret from you.

319
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,310
I asked Constable Yoon to keep you grounded,

320
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:17,540
not join you on your reckless adventures.

321
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:24,710
- Did you just laugh?
 You've been telling me that I shouldn't leave any stone unturned.

322
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:27,600
Why are you so lenient when it comes to Yoon Jae In?

323
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:30,880
- Did I laugh?
- Yes.

324
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,930
Full on, very brightly.

325
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,880
I'll be busy in the meantime, just so you know.

326
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,260
Don't call me to complain for no reason.

327
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:45,930
You should be coming home. If you suddenly stop coming, the neighbors will think it's strange.

328
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:48,560
Which neighbor? And what exactly would they think is strange?

329
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:53,240
They'll think we might have broken up or that I'm really a two-timer.

330
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:58,370
What on earth are you saying? I don't get it. I'm leaving.

331
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:02,400
Hyung, I'm going to read some books from your room.

332
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,050
I still don't get what he's talking about.

333
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,820
Bye.

334
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:45,050


335
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,740
 I know that you are watching me. 

336
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:10,510
The things you've done so far

337
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:14,240
and even the things you are planning to do, all of it.

338
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,900
That's right. You would know.

339
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,160
From the start,

340
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:26,670
this was a fight that would only end with one of the two of us dead.

341
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:29,440
If that's the only way

342
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:35,320
to stop you, then that's the way I'll have to go.

343
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,940
 Where should we start? 

344
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,850
 Kang Hee Sook? Park So Young? 

345
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,710
I would like to start with this woman.

346
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:07,730
Who is that? You shouldn't do this to an unrelated person.

347
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:10,480
I'm someone who runs a clean business.

348
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,550
A clean business?

349
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:17,840
You coax desperate people and sell them as slaves to the clean mud flats

350
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,010
or ship them across the ocean in clean fishing vessels.

351
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:24,970
You take their identities to buy unlicensed cars, cloned phones, and open unauthorized bank accounts.

352
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:28,400
You even sell their identities to others.

353
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:33,620
I know it was you that let this woman live under the name of Kang Hee Sook and Park Soo Young.

354
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:36,750
It would have been good if you only lent her the name, why would you add murder to it?

355
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:40,180
That murder has nothing to do with our organization.

356
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,230
Gab Yong did it alone.

357
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,900
 So you're admitting that he killed them? 

358
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,850
 Either way, Gab Yong is dead. 

359
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:49,040
There is no reason to keep that a secret.

360
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:54,190
That's right. The murderer is already dead, why keep anything else hidden?

361
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:55,990
But what I want to know,

362
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:59,180
rather than the victim or the reasons for murder,

363
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,390
is about this woman that is alive.

364
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:04,330
Who is this woman? Where is she right now?

365
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:09,780
I don't know.

366
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:13,490
After Gab Yong died, this woman also disappeared.

367
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:16,460
She disappeared? Then what about the person who killed Kim Gab Yong?

368
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:19,620
If we knew that, do you think we would just be standing by?

369
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:24,520
You see, we're not too shabby at getting information either, but the killer didn't leave a trace.

370
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,580
How did he avoid getting a single photo of his face with surveillance cameras everywhere,

371
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,840
before, during, and after the murder?

372
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,680
 He's no ordinary guy. 

373
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:37,700
 Is this all? No picture of the suspect at all? 

374
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:41,750
 Yes. The surveillance cameras around Prosecutor  Kang's house and the roads nearby only captured his vehicle. 

375
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,110
 What about the location where Ahn was stabbed? 

376
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:45,420
 There were no cameras there. 

377
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,660
 What about the black boxes of the cars parked nearby? 

378
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:52,320
I called to ask for them, but Prosecutor Kang had

379
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,620
already obtained them all.

380
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:03,260
Officer, the fact that Gab Yong killed those women,

381
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:06,350
I can confess to all that.

382
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,470
So let's wrap it up here.

383
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:12,740
Wrap it up? Who says you can just wrap it up?

384
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,790
This is just the beginning.

385
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:23,150
You're quite clueless, aren't you? Many in this building won't want me talking.

386
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:27,990
Would we have run this business without any connections?

387
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,220
Is that so? Let's give it a try.

388
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:39,510
I'm also curious to see how big of a case these suitcases will result in.

389
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:47,670
Most of the members have admitted that Kim Gab Yong killed the two women.

390
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:51,790
But still, there is no one that knows the whereabouts of that person.

391
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:54,490
This is no ordinary organization.

392
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:57,050
They also manage YSS Construction's slush fund.

393
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:58,680
YSS Construction's slush fund?

394
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,440
They put non-employees down on the payroll

395
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,450
and had the money wired to a slush fund.

396
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:10,680
YSS Construction. Now that complicates things.

397
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:25,440
This is getting complicated.

398
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,850
I should sever ties if murder is one of the jobs they do.

399
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:33,440
You're not severing ties with us, are you?

400
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,180
We've worked together for years.

401
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,850
That sounds like a threat.

402
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:38,790
Of course not.

403
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:42,280
We'll take the blow this time

404
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,410
and not let it reach you.

405
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:48,960
We have tracked down the data that could cause danger to us and discarded it.

406
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,420
This won't hurt us that much.

407
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,890
You'll probably make sure of that.

408
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:57,530
It's not the first time for YSS Construction.

409
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,880
Yes, we'll have to tidy this up nicely.

410
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,530
Anyway, from what I hear,

411
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:07,130
your daughter is the lead detective on the case.

412
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:11,260
Was her name Eun Ji Soo?

413
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,180
Hey!

414
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:16,140
Your weakness is still the same,

415
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,490
even after all these years.

416
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:31,440
No way.

417
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,630
How can they steal the case from me in such a short time?

418
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:38,350
The YSS corruption case is not for us to put our hands on.

419
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:40,600
Still, we're the ones that prepped the ingredients.

420
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,970
I can't just watch the others eat our meal.

421
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:45,780
As if they'd even get to that.

422
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:49,950
At times like these, I hate that I am a civil servant.

423
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,510
- Eun Ji Soo.
 - What?

424
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:56,020
I think it would be best if you stepped away from this case.

425
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,690
What? What are you saying all of a sudden?

426
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,890
The suitcase murder case has been wrapped up and the culprit has been revealed as well.

427
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:04,830
What do you mean wrapped up? It hasn't even started yet.

428
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:08,760
If Kim Gab Yong is tied to the missing Hanmin Care Home caregiver,

429
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,580
that fire may have been set by Kim Gap Yong or that woman.

430
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,620
That was my mistake in the first place.

431
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,260
I can reinvestigate.

432
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:19,450
You know, I'm glad you brought it up.

433
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:22,620
You were the one who brought Kim Gab Yong as the witness in the first place.

434
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:27,480
And you know something about Kim Gab Yong's murderer.

435
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:33,150
The man who killed Kim Gab Yong and the man who stabbed Ahn escaped from all the surveillance cameras like a ghost.

436
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:35,930
There are over 300,000 cameras nationwide,

437
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:38,720
but we still haven't found a single picture of this guy.

438
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,740
 What do you think that means? 

439
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,460
He must be no easy guy.

440
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:52,210
He even installed a camera in front of an active prosecutor's residence.

441
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,990
What?

442
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:59,380
I'll have to track the IP address, but I'm sure it is linked to a cloned phone.

443
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,150
What exactly does this guy want from you?

444
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:03,220
If you're not going to back off this case,

445
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:08,460
then remember that you could also be in danger.

446
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,810
Why would I be in danger?

447
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:13,780
If he doesn't get what he wants,

448
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:16,360
he'll ruin everything

449
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:19,900
and everyone precious to me.

450
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,220
What?

451
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,440
It's impossible.

452
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,380
I can't read Seong Mo's thoughts or get the gist of these books.

453
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,200
What is this?

454
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:57,040
There are many good books in Korean, too.

455
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,730
Why read stuff in another language?

456
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:03,230
What language is this anyway? Is it an alien language?

457
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:17,660
The only thing I can read is this. 
  New Korean Dictionary  

458
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:36,990
  ...feeling, happy, pleased. 

459
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:48,870
  ...love, lovely, captivated. 

460
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,030
 ...hurt  

461
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,210
 ...pretty  

462
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:01,230
 ...angry  

463
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:27,230
 - Hey. Speed up with your training and get a read on Seong Mo.  
- What's the matter?

464
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:30,660
Do whatever you can to find out what he is thinking.

465
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:33,590
 The second you do, you can start working here. 

466
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:37,790
I'll hire you as a psychometrist right away, okay?

467
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:45,490
That's just unbelievable.

468
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:49,930
Why am I something he cherishes?

469
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,440
Since when?

470
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,080
What was all that about?

471
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:03,030
 Yoon Jae In 

472
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:07,770
- Hello? 
- I've decided where to have class for today.

473
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:10,530
- Where? 
- Text me your address.

474
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:12,830
We'll study there today.

475
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:16,340
My place?

476
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,770
 Welcome. 

477
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:23,750
Thirty dollars' worth, please.

478
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,240
Okay, okay. We'll get out soon.

479
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,020
- This is your gas station too?

480
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,440
Y-Yeah.

481
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:55,610
Okay. Can I use your toilet?

482
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:58,920
Do you need to change her diaper?

483
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,020
She'll get too cold. Go to the office.

484
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,460
Let's get your diaper changed.

485
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:08,200
Sorry. It won't take too long.

486
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,100
She caught a cold too and...

487
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,900
Hey, you don't have to explain.

488
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,470
I do this much for any customer.

489
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:16,990
Thanks.

490
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,880
Okay.

491
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,130
Would you mind looking away?

492
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:26,190
Why?

493
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:29,560
She's still a girl.

494
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,530
Oh, sorry.

495
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:33,550
Let's change your diaper.

496
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:45,140
I'll pull up your pants.

497
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:48,120
Don't you feel better now?

498
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:51,700
- I'm done.
- Already?

499
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,770
You're an expert.

500
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:56,300
This is nothing for a mom.

501
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:59,000
Are you happy now?

502
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,740
Do you feel better?

503
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,690
You feel better?

504
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:04,980
Are you in a good mood now?

505
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,540
I should go.

506
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,250
Sorry about yesterday.

507
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:20,070
I was inconsiderate.

508
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:22,250
About the wallet?

509
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:27,110
I wasn't angry with you, but with myself.

510
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,040
With yourself? Why?

511
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:33,030
That for a tenth of a second, I considered keeping the money I found in it.

512
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:35,250
For another tenth,

513
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:37,650
I thought of taking the compensation money.

514
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:40,550
I was embarrassed.

515
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:44,030
Anyone would consider that, don't be embarrassed.

516
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:48,600
I swore when I had Eun Sol that

517
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:52,440
I wouldn't be a shameful mom.

518
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:09,690
Welcome to our place.

519
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:11,450
Our place? Ours?

520
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,990
What am I saying?

521
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:18,830
♫  This unknown feeling, though I try to hide it   ♫

522
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,620
♫   I can't get a hold of it   ♫

523
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:24,180
♫   My heart is growing even today   ♫

524
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,930
♫   I only see you   ♫

525
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:28,680
♫   Nothing's ever gonna change   ♫

526
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:32,100
♫   I feel you   ♫

527
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:35,010
♫   This strange attraction   ♫

528
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:39,520
How handsome. Nice.
♫   Tell me honestly   ♫

529
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:45,330
Welcome. 
 ♫   I want to know more   ♫

530
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:49,160
Excuse me. 
♫   There's no need to hide it   ♫

531
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,580
You can wear these. 
 ♫   Oh, trust me   ♫

532
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:58,290
♫   Show me your heart baby   ♫

533
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:00,390
♫   On a sunny day   ♫

534
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:06,050
♫   You took my heart, I end up thinking about you all day   ♫

535
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:07,980
♫   I fall in love   ♫

536
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,470
♫   Tell me about your everything   ♫

537
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:15,320
♫   I only see you   ♫

538
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:20,300
This is White Snow.

539
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,980
Do you want coffee?

540
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:27,010
So it's you, the dog he found when he hit rock bottom.

541
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:31,940
♫  My heart is filled with you ♫ 

542
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:34,300
♫  I wanna stay with you  ♫

543
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,970
What was that?

544
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:40,040
I said I was visiting Prosecutor Kang and Auntie packed a ton of food.

545
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:44,740
I don't have to figure out which one contains fish sauce, do I?

546
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:49,150
You passed an entry-level test like that when you caught the thug had drugged our drinks.

547
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:51,970
Oh, right. I saved Yoon Jae Soon

548
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:54,100
from being sold to a fishing village.

549
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,880
I forgot about that.

550
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,780
Is Prosecutor Kang at work?

551
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:01,020
How's the investigation going?

552
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,500
If he were the type to share such details,

553
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,460
I wouldn't be this frustrated.

554
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:08,140
I'm sure he means well.

555
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,040
Since we are talking about him,

556
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,730
can you think of a way to get me to read him?

557
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:16,170
What?

558
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:21,960
Not long ago, that guy snuck into our place.

559
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,650
That guy? As in...

560
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:25,950
The one who stabbed me.

561
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:29,950
 I didn't see his face, but it was definitely him. 

562
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:36,870
Who is he that he could break into your house?

563
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:38,370
I don't know.

564
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:42,170
What I do know is that his and Seong Mo's bad blood

565
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,880
goes back a long way.

566
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:49,050
 I wasn't going to come back to Korea. 

567
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:52,960
 Were you running away from him? 

568
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,590
 Then why did you come back? 

569
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:57,900
 I'm going to find him 

570
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,190
 and kill him. 

571
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:06,120
- Prosecutor Kang said he'd kill him?
- Yes.

572
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,960
He clearly said he'd kill the guy,

573
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,020
but it sounded like

574
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:16,330
he wanted me to stop him.

575
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:20,470
 To what level must I bring his skills to? 

576
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:23,380
 The mission will end when 

577
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,140
 Ahn can... 

578
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:30,210
 can get a read on me. 

579
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:33,020
Are you guys

580
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:36,380
in a relationship?

581
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:39,190
Or is it about playing hard to get?

582
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:40,450
What?

583
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:44,770
I mean, you both seem to have some kind of unspoken connection.

584
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:48,600
But why do  you insist on having me in the middle

585
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,190
instead of communicating directly?

586
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:52,860
What did my hyung tell you?

587
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:57,760
- It's a secret. You see, he pays me for tutoring you.
- Goodness.

588
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:03,250
Anyway, I need to improve my ability quickly so we can be of help to him.

589
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:07,670
So let's not train in confined places like this.

590
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:10,630
It makes me want to focus on you instead of my training.

591
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:16,550
Your brakes are completely out of order.

592
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,010
Where is Prosecutor Kang's room? This way?

593
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:22,220
No, that way.

594
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,690
Can you do a psychometric reading on Prosecutor Kang's stuff?

595
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:30,450
Only occasionally.

596
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:33,530
Sometimes I can see that he changed the passcode for the front door.

597
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:36,800
You mean you can see things indirectly,

598
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,710
but not directly, right?

599
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:40,950
It's not impossible to see things directly either.

600
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:43,560
I was able to read him perfectly one time.

601
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,800
What did you see?

602
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,680
- A woman. 
 - A woman?

603
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,480
I could see the back of some woman.

604
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:00,170
Isn't it Detective Eun?

605
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:02,590
It's not Ji Soo Noona.

606
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:06,980
I feel sorry for her but he doesn't feel the same way about her.

607
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:12,370
Is there someone else he likes?

608
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:17,560
That's right. You can't hide your feelings toward someone.

609
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,340
So that's why you see it.

610
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:21,020
- Is that so? 
 - Yes.

611
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:23,710
Anyway, I can't read anything in this room.

612
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:26,280
I was also worried about him so I searched here and there,

613
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:30,400
but I can't see it.

614
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,950
That means there's nothing we can get from here.

615
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:36,640
That's right. But since you're already here,

616
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,910
why don't you check out my room, too?

617
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:51,610
You can sit on the bed.

618
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:56,340
If you're shy because you've never been in a man's room, you can cuddle stuff like this.

619
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,090
What do you mean the first time in a man's room?

620
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:04,850
It isn't your first time?

621
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,090
I'm not the type of man who cares about that kind of stuff.

622
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:11,900
As you know, I have the ability to see someone's past if I want,

623
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,880
which is why I have a very good understanding

624
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,030
toward women.

625
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:19,090
What are you babbling about? We walked into Prosecutor Kang's room just now.

626
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:21,360
Ahhhh.

627
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,800
Thank God.

628
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,620
This is the polar opposite of Prosecutor Kang's room.

629
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:27,750
How could you not have a single book in your room?

630
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:30,850
What do you mean there isn't? There is one over there.

631
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:35,610
You studied.

632
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,740
You even studied hard.

633
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:43,460
My hyung studied with it.

634
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:46,120
Is it Prosecutor Kang's?

635
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:49,140
He was a hardworking genius.

636
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:50,950
I can relate to him now.

637
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:53,260
What did you see here?

638
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:56,930
Good, love, happy, sad, painful, hurt.

639
00:44:56,930 --> 00:44:59,410
Do smart people underline words like that?

640
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:02,480
No, I'm asking you if there's anything you saw through psychometry.

641
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,450
This must've been touched by Prosecutor Kang a lot.

642
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:08,530
- There isn't. 
 - At all?

643
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:11,210
Don't show your disappointment so much. You're embarrassing me.

644
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:15,700
Touch every single word as if it's a braille book starting from today.

645
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:19,390
I'll catch two birds this way. I'll make you study and practice psychometry, too.

646
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:21,370
If you see anything, tell me right away.

647
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:24,090
Look at the words one by one?

648
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:43,180
Deputy Director, I'll send a cellphone to you right now.

649
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:44,950
Please send it to NDFC.

650
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,850
  NDFC (National Digital Forensic Center)  

651
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:49,050
  Autopsy Report  

652
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:53,760
Kim Gab Yong, who died two years ago died from getting stabbed in the right abdomen.

653
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,490
 He had a shackle on his ankle too. 

654
00:45:56,490 --> 00:45:59,110
 There were no fingerprints, no witnesses... 

655
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:02,590
The detective wasn't competent either.

656
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:03,980
It's the same.

657
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:04,890
What is?

658
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:07,910
The Yeongseong Apartments, the Hanmin Care Home, and Kim Gab Yong.

659
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:10,550
 The cause of death in all of those cases was a stab wound in the right abdomen. 

660
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:12,270
 That's where that psycho guy got stabbed too. 

661
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:15,520
Yes, it's all the same method.

662
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,800
If we had Kim Gab Yong's body we could've asked Ahn to touch it.

663
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,710
We can't even do that because he was cremated.

664
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:26,790
Since when did you start depending on him more than me?

665
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:29,450
If there was a body, I would've found something.

666
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:31,130
How could you think of him first?

667
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:35,660
I mean, it's because he scored something last time.

668
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:48,090
  Lovable.  

669
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:53,970
It would've been weird if I saw something.

670
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:57,070
This clearly seems like a very old book.

671
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:12,800
  To my beloved Seong Mo, from Mom.   

672
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:20,050
So it was a present from his mom.

673
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:29,880
 I sent what I found in the phone to your e-mail. 

674
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,310
You worked hard.

675
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:46,320
  What did Prosecutor Kang say?  

676
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:50,090
That man will destroy what he cherishes?

677
00:47:50,090 --> 00:47:54,450
It feels weird to hear it like that.

678
00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:57,380
Detective Eun. What Prosecutor Kang said

679
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:00,030
doesn't just mean that he cherishes you.

680
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:02,230
The point is that—

681
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:05,190
He's trying to destroy you.

682
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:07,610
I know that too.

683
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:10,350
How can you smile then?

684
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:13,610
Someone so guarded like him said something like that.

685
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:15,770
Let me just feel excited for two hours.

686
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:17,670
You shouldn't feel excited now.

687
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:22,660
Prosecutor Kang even said you should stay out of this case. Didn't he?

688
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:28,250
Dr. Hong, if someone dear to Kang Seong Mo is in danger,

689
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:30,490
it's not me.

690
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:42,910
 I think I understand why he asked Constable Yoon 

691
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:45,020
 to take care of Ahn. 

692
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:50,600
 The person that Prosecutor Kang wants to protect 

693
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,630
  is that kid.  

694
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:05,760
  Seoheun Community Security Center  

695
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:12,390
What's that? It's broken?

696
00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:18,430
What are you doing?

697
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:23,000
Somebody disabled the CCTV in front of the Community Security Center.

698
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,380
I'll contact the Information Center.

699
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,650
He's got a lot of nerve.

700
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:30,180
Though it's called a Community Security Center, it's still a police station.

701
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:33,740
How dare he disable the one right in front of it?

702
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:54,750
 Oh my. 

703
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:56,350
 My goodness. 

704
00:49:56,350 --> 00:49:58,500
 You must've done this before. 

705
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,250
 So much detail. 

706
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:03,480
 You're great with your hands. 

707
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:08,720
 How did he do that anyway? 

708
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,260
My goodness. This is art.

709
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:13,830
Whoa...

710
00:50:13,830 --> 00:50:17,220
- How do you do that with that stuff?
- So amazing.

711
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:21,070
He makes all kinds of things with wire.

712
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:25,220
You should be a teacher, not a student.

713
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:29,120
That's right, I'm sure he could make handcuffs too with these skills.

714
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:33,040
It's a deep cut.

715
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,070
Are you okay? Oh no.

716
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:36,300
I am fine.

717
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:39,890
Jae In, go to our room and

718
00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:43,060
get the ointment and a bandage out of the first aid kit.

719
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:51,290
Then, I'll ask you for that favor.

720
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,800
Yes.

721
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:06,660
  Painful, hurt...  

722
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:08,360
Okay.

723
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:29,530
    

724
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:37,540
 Seong Mo.. 

725
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:42,730
 Hurt is an emotion you feel when a wound bleeds.   

726
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:45,600
 I already told you when we studied pain. 

727
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:48,600
 Even if I bleed, I am fine. 

728
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:49,870
  It doesn't hurt.  

729
00:51:49,870 --> 00:51:52,300
  For other people, it hurts.  

730
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:54,120
  So you can't ever 

731
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:55,980
  hurt someone.  

732
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:59,290
  Then what about killing? 

733
00:51:59,290 --> 00:52:02,390
 When you die, pain and all emotions disappear. 

734
00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:04,530
  You absolutely can't. Never, ever.  

735
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:08,470
 That will make you the same person as that person. 

736
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:12,550
  Then, I will be very hurt.  

737
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:14,680
 Even if you don't bleed? 

738
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:17,290
 When it comes to pain, 

739
00:52:17,290 --> 00:52:20,060
 rather than wounds of the flesh, 

740
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:23,760
  it is one in the heart, 

741
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,000
 that hurts more. 

742
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:29,900
  Painful, hurt.   

743
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:50,540
    

744
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:57,950
 That will make you the same person as that person. 

745
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:01,090
That person?

746
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:05,720
The cut seems quite deep. Doesn't it hurt?

747
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:09,840
I'm fine.

748
00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:16,020
But... Do you live here?

749
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:22,960
Yes, I'm a police officer working at the Community Security Center.

750
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:28,270
I know. I saw you on patrol in the neighborhood.

751
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:30,580
You do seem familiar.

752
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:32,790
When did you move into this neighborhood?

753
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:34,910
Where?

754
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:41,440
I know most of the people here since it's a small neighborhood.

755
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,870
That helps to prevent crimes to—

756
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:48,460
Not that you'd commit a crime or anything.

757
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:50,000
Yoon Jae In!

758
00:53:56,030 --> 00:53:58,490
I'll see you next time.

759
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:09,290
Yoon Jae In, I saw it.

760
00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:12,180
I think I saw Seong Mo Hyung through that Korean dictionary.

761
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:14,410
 Do you want everyone to know? 

762
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:16,980
Follow me.

763
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:29,580
- So in a dark room. 
 - Yes.

764
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:32,310
- Prosecutor Kang? 
 - Yes.

765
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:34,270
He was studying the Korean dictionary?

766
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:35,880
That's what I'm saying.

767
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:38,760
He was sitting in the dark with his mom

768
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:41,810
and learning about the word 'hurt'.

769
00:54:41,810 --> 00:54:43,850
Who learns about pain through reading?

770
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:46,560
I know, that's why I came to you.

771
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:50,010
You said I'm the one that acts and you're the one that thinks.

772
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:53,520
Just wait a bit. I'm not an answer generating machine.

773
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,650
You need to give me some time to think.

774
00:54:55,650 --> 00:54:58,270
And, anything else?

775
00:54:58,270 --> 00:55:00,500
- There isn't anything. 
 - Huh?

776
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,610
You ran all the way here because you saw that one thing?

777
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:06,550
You told me to tell you immediately if I saw anything.

778
00:55:06,550 --> 00:55:09,980
You should've tried to see more while you were at it.

779
00:55:24,810 --> 00:55:28,350
It'd be nice if Hyung just told me.

780
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:32,100
So difficult.

781
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:36,540
The thing that Prosecutor Kang wanted to show you,

782
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:39,750
- even when he wants to? 
 - What?

783
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:44,480
Sometimes, baby chicks can't get out of the shell,

784
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,930
even though it's time for them to come out.

785
00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:49,700
It's definitely time for them to come out of the shell,

786
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:52,200
but they can't break out of the shell on their own.

787
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:56,290
But if they miss their timing,

788
00:55:56,990 --> 00:55:59,150
the baby chicks end up dying.

789
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:01,900
But they die even if you rashly break the shell from the outside.

790
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,600
Why are you bringing up baby chicks all of a sudden?

791
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:09,600
I'm telling you that you're the one to break the shell for me right now.

792
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:13,850
I'm flattered that you overestimated my ability, but

793
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:17,360
I don't think Hyung thinks that way.

794
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:19,160
No?

795
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:22,780
Prosecutor Kang also wants you to do it.

796
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:28,650
Just like I chose you,

797
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:32,050
Prosecutor Kang is trusting and waiting for you too.

798
00:56:40,790 --> 00:56:45,940
- Which book did you learn pretty words like that from?
- What?

799
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:48,180
Why don't you choose that book for me next time?

800
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:52,130
I want to say something to make your heart skip a beat too.

801
00:56:56,270 --> 00:56:58,450
Your hands are all frozen.

802
00:56:58,450 --> 00:57:01,090
You can warm them by linking arms.

803
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:05,100
Linking arms?

804
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:08,090
What are you thinking about it? Like this!

805
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:10,430
I didn't mean linking arms with me.

806
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:13,520
I didn't say that.

807
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:19,860
Your shoelaces are untied.

808
00:57:30,850 --> 00:57:35,100
Sorry. I didn't mean to.

809
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,960
I like snow.

810
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:50,860
You can't feel anything no matter how much you touch it,

811
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:53,450
there is no painful past

812
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:57,960
and it doesn't make me think a lot either.

813
00:57:58,710 --> 00:58:00,860
The best thing is...

814
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:07,530
You don't have to ask for permission to touch it.

815
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:21,990
  I'll help you.  

816
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:26,840
  Not now, but when you're ready.  

817
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:30,040
  What are you, you punk?  

818
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:33,210
  What would have you done if I wasn't there?  

819
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:35,250
  You know now is the time to thank me, right?  

820
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:36,780
  What are you doing? Aren't you going?  

821
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:42,160
 What? You're really going to be my bodyguard? 

822
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:46,240
  I remember everything about you from two years ago. Let's try it. 

823
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:49,360
  It's not for you, I am doing this purely for me.  

824
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:53,890
  Doesn't matter. I'm also doing this for you too.  

825
00:58:55,490 --> 00:59:00,540
 Narcissism is a habit and it's highly contagious as well. 

826
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:06,340
 I could've proven myself only if they didn't get scattered. 

827
00:59:08,270 --> 00:59:10,450
 - Lee Ahn! 
 - Ahn!  

828
00:59:10,450 --> 00:59:11,690
  - Lee Ahn! What's wrong? 
 - Ahn!  

829
00:59:11,690 --> 00:59:15,520
  - Ahn! Ahn! 
- Lee Ahn! Lee Ahn!  

830
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:22,520
♫  I can be the one with you always  ♫

831
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:27,410
  Don't worry. I won't touch you until you let me.  

832
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:30,700
 I wanted to tell you that 

833
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:35,900
  your offer to help strengthened me for at least a short while.  

834
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:39,960
  Continue to develop your ability.  

835
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:42,990
  Then when I gain confidence, 

836
00:59:42,990 --> 00:59:46,900
  then I will find you.  

837
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:07,260
The surprise attack,

838
01:00:08,190 --> 01:00:10,640
I'm not sure if it worked.

839
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:15,670
You totally

840
01:00:17,490 --> 01:00:19,710
got caught.

841
01:00:21,570 --> 01:00:23,290
Your feelings.

842
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:03,480
♫  I can see the look in your eyes  ♫

843
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:07,130
♫  I can hear your heart  ♫

844
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:12,610
♫  Without having to say anything  ♫

845
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:18,190
♫  Even if we drift apart again  ♫

846
01:01:18,190 --> 01:01:23,630
♫  And I can't see your eyes  ♫

847
01:01:23,630 --> 01:01:27,290
♫  My heart remembers  ♫

848
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:36,430
♫  After a long time passes  ♫

849
01:01:36,430 --> 01:01:40,480
♫  When the memory of you approaches me  ♫

850
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:44,570
♫  When the memory of you approaches me  ♫

851
01:01:44,570 --> 01:01:47,780
 Your shoelaces got undone again. 

852
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:51,490
 You shouldn't fall, my daughter. 

853
01:01:51,490 --> 01:01:57,260
♫  I'll recognize you  ♫

854
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:01,920
Don't run away anymore.

855
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:07,070
Don't cry alone either.

856
01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:09,970
♫  Don't ever cry again  ♫

857
01:02:09,970 --> 01:02:13,480
♫  I'll be the time  ♫

858
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:16,390
♫  That you need  ♫

859
01:02:16,390 --> 01:02:19,230
♫  I'll recognize your heart  ♫

860
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:24,730
The past you've been running away from...

861
01:02:24,730 --> 01:02:26,620
♫  I'll stay here  ♫

862
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:28,450
I'll look into everything.

863
01:02:28,450 --> 01:02:32,060
♫  And wait for you  ♫

864
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:42,580


865
01:02:42,580 --> 01:02:46,260
 He is Psychometric 
♫  I'll caress your eyes  ♫

866
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:50,890
  He is Psychometric  
 ♫ Don't cry again  ♫

867
01:02:50,890 --> 01:02:54,460
♫  I will give you  ♫

868
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:57,360
♫  the time you need  ♫

869
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:00,950
♫  I'll acknowledge your feelings  ♫

870
01:03:00,950 --> 01:03:05,610
♫  Don't hurt alone again  ♫

871
01:03:05,610 --> 01:03:09,450
♫  I'll stay here  ♫

872
01:03:09,450 --> 01:03:12,980
♫  With you   ♫

873
01:03:16,370 --> 01:03:19,710
 Kang Seong Mo knew there was something wrong with the Yeongseong Apartment case from the start.  

874
01:03:19,710 --> 01:03:24,070
 Don't come here if it's because of pity or curiosity. 

875
01:03:24,070 --> 01:03:27,180
 Sorry. I know I shouldn't touch you, but... 

876
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:28,800
 The Yeongseong Apartment, 

877
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:31,390
 Hanmin Care Home, and Kim Gab Yong. 

878
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:33,160
 The victims have the same cause of death. 

879
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:34,620
 Would it be just a coincidence? 

880
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:37,860
 They say scars are the proof that you overcame your pain. Don't forget that. 

881
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:39,590
 They say we can make music boxes. 

882
01:03:39,590 --> 01:03:41,130
 What else do you want me to say? 

883
01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:43,490
 This is our first day as a couple.
