4
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:44,180
-  Did you check the ID of the suspect?
 - No, rather than that 

5
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,620
 I found a record of an unsolved case. 

6
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,670
An unsolved case?

7
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,650
It’s a case from Kangwon-do Kangryung-si in 1996.

8
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,400
 They found the culprit’s fingerprints, 

9
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,460
but they couldn’t find his identity then, either. I think that’s why it was left unsolved.

10
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,290
  Statement 
 Name: Kang Eun Joo
 Gender: Female 
 Resident Registration Number: 700614-2344567

 Yeonhae-dong 12-5 

13
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:09,000
What incident was it?

14
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,840
What is this?

15
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,590
Why is this here?

16
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,450
Is it a basement?

17
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,620
I’ll have to go inside.

18
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,080
 Seong Mo, run away.  

19
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,220
 Run away! Run! Run! 

20
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,750
 For as much as nine years, a woman and a child 

21
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:06,010
 were locked up in a basement. 

22
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,340
 Detective Eun. Are you listening to what I’m saying? 

23
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,680
That's all that's in the records for now.

24
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,480
I'll text you the responsible police station and the case number.

25

 Psychometry: An ability to measure and interpret the essence or history of a person or thing through touch.

 He is Psychometric
- Episode 12 - 

27
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,530
What is all this?

28
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,730
Why in a basement

29
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,990
is there such a prison?

30
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:01,960
Was he locked up?

31
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,060
I saw Hyung running away. At seven years old?

32
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,040
No, around eight years old.

33
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,040
Noona!

34
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,920
He was nine years old.

35
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,000
Seong Mo...

36
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,480
He was locked up here until he was nine.

37
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,950
What are you saying?

38
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:40,380
How can that be possible?

39
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:51,550
Constable Yoon, look inside first together with Ahn.

40
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:55,460
I’ll go to the police station and find out more about this case in detail.

41
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:31,500
 Hey, Kang Seong Mo, why do you hide so much? 

42
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,320
 For two years, you’ve been worrying and thinking alone.  

43
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,390
 I’m telling you that I’ll help you. Am I really no help to you at all? 

44
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,420
 We have such an unfair relationship. 

45
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,720
 You know everything I’m thinking, 

46
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,770
 and I don’t know anything you’re thinking, if you don’t tell me. 

47
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:10,600
Should I stay outside?

48
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,490
I think I'll only be in the way of you reading memories.

49
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:18,390
See if there's anything outside that I can use psychometry on.

50
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,790
Okay.

51
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,150
You shouldn't overdo it. Okay?

52
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,890
You fainted last time.

53
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:40,290
Yeah.

54
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:54,700
 Save me! 

55
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,320
 Get me out! Get me out! 

56
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,940
 Please get me out. 

57
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:10,060
  Save me!  

58
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,570
  If you touch this kid, I will also die.  

59
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,940
 Is that what you want? 

60
00:08:55,790 --> 00:09:01,930
  Seong Mo, Mom will make sure to definitely get you out of here.  

61
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,740
  Kangryung Police Station  

62
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,010
People think that only this type of confinement only happens in foreign countries.

63
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:47,040
but it happens often in our country as well. They just don't get revealed,

64
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,860
like the Sinan slavery and confinement incident and assault of some cults.

65
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,700
A confinement case of this scale

66
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:58,580
must have been pretty eye-catching but I don't remember hearing about it at all.

67
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:03,230
How could it be so quiet when it was left unsolved?

68
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:07,410
Because it was left unsolved, it was hushed up.

69
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,210
 Anything is fine, so please try saying something. 

70
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:20,380
  You need to say something for us to be able to help you!  

71
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,000
  The woman who was detained for nine years even gave birth to a baby, 

72
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,520
 but the police didn't know anything.  

73
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,580
  The police also didn't help her escape  

74
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,250
  but the victims escaped themselves.  

75
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:36,700
The police were bound to face loads of criticism

76
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:40,070
for being unable to even spot a trace of the culprit.

77
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:43,460
Do you know what the biggest critical problem was?

78
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:48,750
This culprit was a guy without a resident registration number.

79
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:57,890
So... This case would've exposed all the police force's weaknesses,

80
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:00,810
so it was covered up as quietly as possible.

81
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:07,610
Here it is.

82
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:10,140
  Kangryung-si Confinement Case 1996 

83
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,320
  Suspect wanted 

84
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,070
  Kang Geun Taek, (alias) 

85
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,530
 Suspect
 Name: Kang Geun Taek (Alias) Unidentified 
 Size: around 175cm, Weight: around 75kg 
 Slender eyes and long scar around neck  

86
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:19,710
Kang Geun Taek...

87
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,990
It was the name that the victim Kang Eun Joo remembered.

88
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:25,530
He is a person without a resident registration number or name so it's pointless.

89
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:27,790
But what is this?

90
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,470
A long scar around the neck?

91
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:34,590
 The culprit seemed to have this old scar around his neck. 

92
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,850
  We couldn't figure out what it was.  

93
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:41,230
 Only Kang Eun Joo and her son saw it themselves. 

94
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:45,700
Do you happen to have evidence stored then?

95
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,920
That... The victim took it with him last year.

96
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,960
The victim?

97
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,550
Well, he became a prosecutor, that son.

98
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:58,120
Ah, I also learned about this case by handing over the evidence to the prosecutor.

99
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:35,200
  I have to teach something to Seong Mo.  

100
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,340
  Please buy some books.  

101
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,440
  I ask you for this favor, please.  

102
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,510
  What use would that be here? 

103
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,920
  The child doesn't laugh,  

104
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,410
  and he doesn't say he's hurt even with his ankle chained up. 

105
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:53,310
  He has nothing he wants, nothing he likes... 

106
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:58,770
  Please, any book.  

107
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:00,240
  Just one, at least.  

108
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,950
  We have to find something where Seong Mo can feel something.  

109
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:06,650
  Please, or he'll be like you... 

110
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:18,350
  Do you think he's gonna be an emotionless monster like me?  

111
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:22,040
  Right, my kid will never be like you.  

112
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,410
  I'm won't let him become a monster that's only obsessed with one person.  

113
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:28,480
  I'll never make him that way.  

114
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,930
An emotionless...

115
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,580
Monster?

116
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,340
  Kangryung-si Iron Factory Confinement Case 
 Year 1996 (Unresolved Case)  

117
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,950
What is this?

118
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:51,250
Behavioral Analysis Results of the Victim, Child Kang Seong Mo

119
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:57,350
Alexithymia - Records of inability to express emotions.

120
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:46,270
  Prosecutor Kang had Alexithymia? 

121
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:49,960
He might have got that from Kang Geun Taek.

122
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,420
I think he was born with it.

123
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:57,650
I know Prosecutor Kang is a bit clumsy with expressing his emotions,

124
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:00,820
but there's no way he has alexithymia.

125
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:05,650
What if during that time, Seong Mo

126
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,070
was perfectly

127
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:12,690
putting on an act?

128
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,900
There's something strange.

129
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,760
Not only Prosecutor Kang but also Kang Geun Taek.

130
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:26,320
If you are unable to express emotions, how can he love Kang Eun Joo

131
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,380
and obsess over her?

132
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,010
I also don't know.

133
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:32,380
This isn't my area of expertise.

134
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:36,450
Either way, I asked Doctor Hong so she'll call me soon.

135
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,940
Yes, Doctor Hong.

136
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:47,620
 Simply put, the inability to express emotions 

137
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:50,670
occurs when the size of the amygdala is small.

138
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,820
The amygdala?

139
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:55,760
 Each person has a different personality and that's what an amygdala influences. 

140
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,680
However that amygdala,

141
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,210
through acquired training or some motivation,

142
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,730
  can possibly grow.  

143
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:05,050
Some motivation?

144
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,370
  Language Dictionary  

145
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:41,390
  Then Kang Geun Taek's meeting with Kang Eun Joo might be that motivation.  

146
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:45,330
  A person without any emotions who felt emotion of love for the first time through her, 

147
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:49,420
 isn't that why he's more obsessive?  

148
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:59,550
  Mom, what's outside the metal cage?  

149
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,620
  Tree,  

150
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,360
  flower,  

151
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,640
  butterfly,  

152
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,290
  sea,  

153
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:19,160
  sky.  

154
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,020
  It's full of beautiful things.  

155
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:26,000
  Does our Seong Mo want to see it?  

156
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,310
  How is it? It's pretty, right?  

157
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,410
  Try touching it.  

158
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,840
  Seong Mo, have a look over there.  

159
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,860
  I don't know what it means to miss something  

160
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:49,300
  and what beautiful means.  

161
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:20,120
Does that mean there was a source of motivation for Seong Mo to feel emotions?

162
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:26,980
Prosecutor Kang probably continuously made efforts not to become a monster like Kang Geun Taek.

163
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:33,960
Ahn said that be had seen Prosecutor Kang being taught of emotions from his mom a long time ago.

164
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,710
Doctor Hong...

165
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:40,750
Is alexithymia possibly

166
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:44,590
similar to being a psychopath?

167
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,620
I know what you are thinking,

168
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:49,570
but people with alexithymia and psychopaths have different brain structures.

169
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:53,650
A psychopath doesn't have the ability to empathize no matter how much you teach them.

170
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:56,780
This alexithymia can change if you try,

171
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:59,260
  though it won't be perfect. 

172
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,390
Thank you Doctor Hong.

173
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,840
I'll call you again.

174
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:12,250
Are you okay?

175
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:21,870
I didn't know why, during all this time, Kang Seong Mo hasn't asked me to help him at all.

176
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:24,560
That has always been a question.

177
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,800
But now I know.

178
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:33,370
He desperately broke off the chains and came out to the world.

179
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:37,360
Rather than helping,

180
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:41,560
people were busy avoiding these two people's wounds.

181
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:47,030
I wonder whether the basement,

182
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,660
or the world was more horrendous to him?

183
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:59,450
  What's the point of breaking off the chain,  

184
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:05,950
  when all this is still grasping onto Seong Mo's ankle? 

185
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:10,740
My dad used to say this,

186
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:15,370
that if you cover the wound, it will fester.

187
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:23,570
He at least now opened the wound that he used to cover.

188
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,550
It will all turn out well.

189
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,330
Right.

190
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:41,100
Just a bit more...

191
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,430
Just a bit...

192
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,370
  "What does it mean to tame?" 

193
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:54,220
  said the Little Prince.  

194
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:58,040
 "It's something that's forgotten 

195
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,080
 " amongst people, 

196
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,390
  but it means to create a relationship." 

197
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:12,180
  I want to stop reading.  

198
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:16,810
  I want to hear more.  

199
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:21,490
  The very last part. 

200
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,700
  You don't want to?  

201
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:33,840
 You're going to regret it. 

202
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:51,670
  You can't.  

203
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:54,090
  You can't.  

204
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:56,080
  Please don't.  

205
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,770
  Don't hit him please.  

206
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:02,920
  You should have come out like this earlier.  

207
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:08,800
  Okay. I will read.  

208
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:13,550
  Instead, I also have a request.  

209
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:16,120
  What more do you need ?  

210
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,440
  The child's clothes, books, a flower pot?  

211
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,530
  Just answer my question.  

212
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,030
  What is your real name?  

213
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,900
  Where are you from?  

214
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:35,270
  Kang Geun Taek is really my real name.  

215
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,030
  And...  

216
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:44,220
  I come from a place that exists but doesn't exist.  

217
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,100
  What?  

218
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,110
  Now as you promised,  

219
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,160
  read.  

220
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,540
  You... 

221
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:40,340
  are the only one on this world to me.  

222
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:50,270
  I'm going to be the only one in the world for you. 

223
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:55,450
  Right, that's the part.  

224
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,750
  Nice.  

225
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:03,230
 Ahn! Wake up, Ahn! 

226
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:06,210
Lee Ahn! Wake up, Ahn!

227
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:07,920
Ahn!

228
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:17,040
Are you okay? Are you coming back to your senses?

229
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:21,010
I told you to take it easy. What are we supposed to do if you die like this?

230
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,470
Don't be angry

231
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:26,920
and give me some candy.

232
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,750
Let's eat first.

233
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:38,080
The police force offers Constable Yoon and I insurance, but not you.

234
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,070
So hurry and eat.

235
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,340
Constable Yoon, make him eat.

236
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:49,910
What does it mean, a place that exists but a place that doesn't exist?

237
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,790
With this riddle-like evidence,

238
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:56,280
do you think Prosecutor Kang found where the culprit is?

239
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:03,710
He's an invisible man from a place that exists but doesn't exist.

240
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,750
Invisible?

241
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:07,610
I told you before, the person without a resident registration number.

242
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:09,510
I also saw it in the news.

243
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:12,280
Invisible children that never had their birth registration,

244
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:17,270
The more they grow, the more likely they are to be exposed to child abuse, human trafficking, and illegal adoption.

245
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:22,700
I think the culprit may have spent a childhood like that.

246
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,620
I think so too. In the past, Prosecutor completely wrapped up an organ trade and human trafficking case,

247
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:30,160
and received a commendation.

248
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:35,080
Some of the rescued young victims from then didn't have resident registration numbers—

249
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:41,460
Why stop in the middle of your sentence?

250
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,500
- I get it. 
 - What is it?

251
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,810
The cases Prosecutor Kang was in charge of,

252
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:49,320
I think there was a process of finding the man in the midst of it.

253
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,260
Then what if we start searching from the cases he was in charge of?

254
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,510
- Eat first and then we'll go. 
 - Is food the problem right now?

255
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:56,700
If you don't eat, I'll leave you both here.

256
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:06,720
What do you mean Ji Soo went to work at the Community Security Center?

257
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,190
Ah, a few days ago there was a case of a policewoman being kidnapped.

258
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:15,320
It was an attempted kidnapping and murder case but the culprit hasn't been caught yet.

259
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:20,500
The last sight of her was when she said she'd investigate herself and left the Seoheun Community Security Center.

260
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,650
Wait a second.

261
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:25,010
Did you just say Seoheun Community Security Center?

262
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:26,870
Yes, that's right.

263
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:30,150
If its the Seoheun Community Security Center...

264
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:35,390
  Yeongseong Apartment Fire Murder Case  

265
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:43,480
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by the 🙏🏼 Just One Touch 🙏🏼 Team at Viki   

266
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:46,830
Come eat.

267
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:56,560
But that Detective Eun or whoever,

268
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,470
what kind of case was it

269
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:00,780
for her to take a kid who has barely been discharged?

270
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,170
Dakgalbi.  
(T/N: Spicy stir-fried chicken) 

271
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:05,190
Weren't you the one who said Jae In was your responsibility?

272
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,760
How can you not know where she went?

273
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,450
Beans cooked in soy sauce, Kimchi Bokkeum.

274
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:13,840
If she gets sent to the hospital again, I'm going to tell her to forget it all.

275
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,070
Bean sprout soup.

276
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:19,730
My nose is faster than my eyes in the midst of distress.

277
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,390
Why?

278
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:32,530
- But why are you here?
- To eat, of course.

279
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:36,250
If there's a case to solve, you're more qualified.

280
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:40,310
Why take Jae In when you're the veteran?

281
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,840
What will you do?

282
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,930
What can I do at this age?

283
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:45,880
They say an old eagle is better than a young crow.

284
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:50,070
The last time Jae In was abducted, when you were in charge of the investigation,

285
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:52,710
it seemed that it wasn't a complete lie that you were famous in your old days.

286
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:57,460
Saying that I was famous in my old days means that I'm a loser in the present.

287
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:01,650
I don't want to do anything that I know I'll fail at.

288
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,750
 Search: invisible children 

289
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:09,840
He must be completely drained.

290
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:17,450
As I started training Ahn, I received a notebook from Prosecutor Kang.

291
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:20,530
- Ah, the note for Lee Ahn's psychometry? 
 - You know?

292
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:22,000
Yeah, I saw it.

293
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,110
The things he's been recording in great detail since Ahn developed his ability.

294
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:28,720
I see he gave that to you.

295
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,420
When Ahn lost the puppy doll that his mom made,

296
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:36,220
there was an entry that he found it with his psychometric ability.

297
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,560
 Desperation, eternity, desire  
- With things Ahn is passionate about,

298
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,750
it said that the psychometrist's ability goes up to its maximum.

299
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:47,460
So that's why he found you at top speed when you were kidnapped.

300
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,970
Now that he knows what that man did to Prosecutor Kang,

301
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,720
he'll do anything

302
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,800
to read about this guy. I'm sure of it.

303
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,680
Let's help him develop his ability a lot,

304
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,520
and exploit them for other cases.

305
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,440
  Yeongseong Apartment  

306
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,360
 Murder/Arson 

307
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,070
  Kang Geun Taek  

308
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,850
Now I can see everything in one picture.

309
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:30,030
  The Yeongseong Apartment, Hanmin Care Home, Kim Gap Yong Murder Case  

310
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:34,520
And the cases of confinement in the iron factory were  all by Kang Geun Taek, who kidnapped Jae In.

311
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:39,320
Yes. The motive for all the murder cases was Prosecutor Kang's mother, Kang Eun Joo.

312
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,160
Then what was the body of Kang Eun Joo found at the Yeongseong Apartment?

313
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,020
He must have killed a woman similar to Kang Eun Joo beforehand,

314
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:47,270
and brought the body.

315
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:51,090
The body contained Kang Eun Joo's ID card.

316
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:52,760
It seems like he even planned the fire in advance.

317
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:57,910
So he planned to fake Kang Eun Joo's death so he could take her away, but failed to do so.

318
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,140
  Director Eun Byung Ho  

319
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:06,520
Anyway, only Kang Eun Joo and Kang Geun Taek know the truth about this day.

320
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,520
- So from now, I– 
- Wait.

321
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,870
That means you know that Constable Yoon's father was framed.

322
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:17,280
But do you know that this case was carried out by Detective Eun Ji Soo's father?

323
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,920
Yes.

324
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,220
What a mischievous fate.

325
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:26,670
Detective Eun, let's talk separately.

326
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,690
Let's forget about our ranks and just talk as colleagues.

327
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:51,420
Yes, go ahead.

328
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:54,830
So you're saying that you know that your father, Eun Byung Ho, was responsible for the Yeongseong Apartment case

329
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:57,030
but you'll investigate anyway.

330
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:59,490
If the real culprit of the Yeongseong Apartment is found,

331
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:02,050
it will be hard for my father to avoid responsibility.

332
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:05,310
But when all the truth is revealed, my father will still say I did a good job.

333
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:08,980
Everyone makes a mistake at least once in their lives.

334
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,710
Mistake?

335
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:13,650
Mistake, you say.

336
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:21,070
I'll be straightforward as well.

337
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,240
I know that during the Yeongseong Apartment fire,

338
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:29,160
you worked in the same station as my father,

339
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,790
although you weren't on the same team.

340
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:36,760
That case... From what point did it go wrong?

341
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:41,410
Was my father's investigation not a simple mistake,

342
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:45,190
but an intentional attempt to cover the truth?

343
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:48,020
  The Blindspot to the Law – Invisible People 

344
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:54,820
Lieutenant Nam was acting strange, right?

345
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:59,820
Yeah. It seemed like he knew something about the Yeongseong Apartment Case.

346
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,350
After you became a probationer,

347
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:05,680
you said you got caught by Lieutenant Nam while looking at the files from the Yeongseong Apartment case,

348
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,690
and that he brought you here.

349
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:13,310
He even gave us a place to live so I thought it was just sympathy,

350
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:15,550
but I don't think that was it.

351
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,170
Maybe did he

352
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:23,060
hope this case would not be dug up?

353
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:30,510
Was there anything you felt while clearing up the identity fraud and human trafficking organization?

354
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:36,070
You must have heard the rumor about the close relationship between that organization and YSS Construction.

355
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:40,760
Yes. But there wasn't a word of it in the newspaper or on broadcasts.

356
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:45,380
That's true. YSS Construction doesn't just do identity fraud.

357
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,460
It has politicians and the police in its pocket.

358
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:50,590
They are out of your reach.

359
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,690
But what does that have to do with this case?

360
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:56,930
YSS Construction's name before they got as big as they are now,

361
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:59,240
was Yeongseong Construction.

362
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:03,820
The Yeongseong Apartment was built in a mess of a structure for any fire-fighting vehicles to enter.

363
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:06,390
Despite the number of casualties,

364
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:09,440
people had no interest. Why?

365
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,530
- Because there was more sensational news. 
 - No way...

366
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:17,200
The hero that saved people turned out to the culprit.

367
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,540
A self-fabricated scenario.

368
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,590
Where can you find more interesting news than that?

369
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:25,690
So to quickly cover the Yeongseong Apartment corruption,

370
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:29,340
my dad pegged Yoon Tae Ha as the culprit?

371
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,870
This is ridiculous.

372
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:36,100
I'm sure you know better about the case's subsequent events,

373
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,920
but Eun Byung Ho began to be quickly promoted

374
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,010
and currently has reached the position as the chief director.

375
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:44,470
What do you think that means?

376
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:12,220
  There are enough reasons why you should dig into the Yeongseong Apartment case as a detective, 

377
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:15,150
  because even Prosecutor Kang's mother's case is involved. 

378
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:19,300
  But as Eun Byung Ho's daughter, 

379
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,400
  this case is Pandora's box.  

380
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,620
  In the end, you'll end up targeting 

381
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:27,510
 your own father, Eun Byung Ho. 

382
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:35,680
It looks like Detective Eun isn't going to come.

383
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:38,070
She doesn't pick up her phone, either.

384
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,170
I'll take you home.

385
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:47,240
What do you mean take me home, when I live right there?

386
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:50,830
I only feel relieved when you're in my sight.

387
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,180
It's not like I can take you to my house.

388
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:56,630
Why would I go to your house–

389
00:34:56,630 --> 00:35:00,440
Wait, the files piled up in Prosecutor Kang's room,

390
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,730
aren't they all investigation files?

391
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:05,000
Yeah, probably.

392
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,290
Let's go right now—to your house.

393
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:14,740
Come sit.

394
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:18,360
Let's talk for a bit.

395
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:31,150
How long will you do whatever you please?

396
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,430
Do you think you can take whatever case you want and leave?

397
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:38,280
In society, there are rules and principles.

398
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,860
Are you acting like this because I have your back?

399
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,630
Return to your team tomorrow.

400
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:49,220
Detective Lee will be in charge of the Seoheun Community Security Center kidnapping case.

401
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:53,570
Dad. Why did you do it?

402
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:57,640
Did you think

403
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,560
that a castle built on sand would last long?

404
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,950
What are you talking about right now?

405
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:08,040
Do you want me to speak of everything you've kept hidden all this time with my own mouth?

406
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,970
I don't know what you are talking about.

407
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:13,800
I know everything about the Yeongseong Apartment.

408
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:20,350
And including YSS Construction—everything.

409
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,730
Eun Ji Soo!

410
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,200
I want you to let me officially reinvestigate it at least now.

411
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,250
That's the most you can do.

412
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,160
It's all in the past.

413
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,760
No, these are all things happening in the present.

414
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,890
Do you know how the people suffering from the past are living right now?

415
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:44,030
If you had just properly investigated—

416
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:53,910
Even if I were to go back to that day, I would make the same choice.

417
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:57,870
- How could you say that?
 - Because it was the path to save your life.

418
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:07,550
To cope with you fainting multiple times a year because of your heart,

419
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:12,250
I was a poor and powerless dad,

420
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:14,960
and I hated it to death.

421
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,540
It was because of me?

422
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:26,030
If you don't want to work properly, you better resign.

423
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:30,250
I won't just sit and watch anymore either.

424
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:02,750
Has Dae Bong Oppa been feeding you well?

425
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,530
It was scary alone, right?

426
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:07,140
Should I take White Snow for the meantime?

427
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:11,560
I have Auntie at home, and it would be lonely for White Snow to be left alone when you're always busy.

428
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:15,800
- Really? 
 - Let's go home together later, okay?

429
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,990
  Eliminate Panhandling in 100 days 

430
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,770
- This is the last of it? 
- Yup.

431
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:48,680
But are there really any clues here that have to do with this guy?

432
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:53,200
Seeing that he's brought them home, it must mean that they were bugging him.

433
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,290
I'm sure there will be something.

434
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:02,450
I'll look it up together with you.

435
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:06,080
- You? 
 - I don't know about other things, but...

436
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,960
I can read Hangul well.

437
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:24,160
Based on Criminal Code, Article 152 Clause 2, the punishment of perjury...

438
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,030
And the goal of... I need to freshen up.

439
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:30,280
My eyes are tired. I'm going to go wash my face.

440
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:34,280
- I overworked myself today. You know, right? 
- I know.

441
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,740
It's not that I don't read because I don't understand.

442
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,340
This isn't your area of expertise.

443
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,870
Don't try to take my job.

444
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,310
But aren't you uncomfortable?

445
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:46,840
What?

446
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,390
Being with just you and me?

447
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:53,760
Not at all. Work is work, privacy is privacy.

448
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,710
I'm pretty good at drawing lines.

449
00:39:57,710 --> 00:40:00,470
- I'm talking about your clothes. 
 - Oh.

450
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:03,480
These clothes seem uncomfortable to work in the whole night.

451
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:08,330
Then can you give me some clothes to change into?

452
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:12,730
What is this feeling of calm before a storm?

453
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:16,630
It's as if a huge group will barge in when I'm not ready.

454
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:19,740
Teacher, this place would have gone out of business if it weren't for the alumni.

455
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:22,970
Why? The chicken here is good, to me.

456
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:26,570
Don't compliment him. It goes to his head.

457
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:29,710
Eat up quickly and start your part-time shift.

458
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:30,960
Aren't you going to go to the gas station?

459
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,110
He's not going. It's about time for So Hyun to come and pick up her order.

460
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:37,280
But isn't she a mother?

461
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:41,880
Are you hitting on a married woman?

462
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:44,910
Morally or legally speaking,

463
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:48,720
there's no reason she can't date whomever she wants.

464
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:55,210
Hey Dae Bong! You can continue following her around if you're confident about taking responsibility.

465
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:58,070
But if you're not serious, stop it right now.

466
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:01,490
Are you confident about convincing your dad about So Hyun? Huh?

467
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:05,340
Hey! This isn't something that will end with a few beats with a golf stick.

468
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,220
You can stop now.

469
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:09,640
Are you after some fun and laughter, is that it?

470
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:12,360
So Hyun is having enough of a hard time right now, punk!

471
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:16,400
You morally dirty—

472
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:18,970
Let's go.

473
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:22,610
You're leaving?

474
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:35,590
Teacher, I just wanted to make her smile.

475
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:38,930
Is that not even allowed?

476
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:47,880
Boss, keep your head up.

477
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,260
I think you're super charming.

478
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:56,580
You're cute, kind, and rich.

479
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:59,870
I must be attractive as an easy boss, not as a man.

480
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:01,630
And so what if she has a child?

481
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:05,530
My dad is a stepdad and is super good to me.

482
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:07,530
Stepdad?

483
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:11,530
It's not that I'd dare to marry So Hyun...

484
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:14,700
Why can't you? You can if you love her.

485
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:19,480
It's that car, isn't it? Isn't it?

486
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,080
Don't look back and just go.

487
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,370
Stop. So Hyun will misunderstand.

488
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:29,080
I'm doing it so she  will  misunderstand!

489
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,060
What?

490
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:34,510
You know nothing about women. A man who throws himself at a woman isn't attractive.

491
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:38,570
 - Let go. 
 - Hurry! 

492
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:41,360
 - Let go. Let go! 
 - If you go now, you'll regret it.   

493
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,310
- Stop it. 
 - Then lean on my shoulder.

494
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,610
- Why would I do that? 
 - Just do it.

495
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:48,910
 - That's nonsense. 
 - It's fine. 
 - She'll get the wrong idea. 

496
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:51,370
  Don't do it.  

497
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:55,130
 - Let's go quickly. Let's go.   
  - Let go.

498
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:57,410
-Geez, let's just go. 
 - Don't do that. Seriously.

499
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:59,200
Don't.

500
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:02,610
I don't want to break her heart

501
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:05,410
just to win her favor.

502
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:18,290
Am I giving you a hard time?

503
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:21,160
If me hanging around you

504
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:24,640
is sickening and disgusting,

505
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:28,830
tell me.

506
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:32,650
I won't show up again.

507
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:35,230
Yeah.

508
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:38,380
I hate it awfully.

509
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:46,100
Right, I got it.

510
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:07,930
  Eliminate Panhandling in 100 Days  

511
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:17,610
There's more relevant data than I expected.

512
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:21,020
Human trafficking, panhandling groups, and organ trafficking.

513
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:22,840
There are many particular cases of murdering the homeless.

514
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:27,010
All these may be related to people with unclear identities.

515
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:48,910
It must've been hard trying to read something you don't even know.

516
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:03,400
  Seong Mo!  

517
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:15,190
  If you want to kill someone with that short height,  

518
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:18,770
 you shouldn't have stabbed here. 

519
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:26,410
  But here.  

520
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:40,820
 Ahn, Lee Ahn! 

521
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:42,740
Lee Ahn!

522
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:46,110
Are you okay? Did you have a nightmare?

523
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,700
Was it a dream?

524
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:53,350
It felt like I was performing psychometry.

525
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:55,680
What dream was it?

526
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:06,020
In the basement, Seong Mo...

527
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:10,950
stabbed that man.

528
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:17,660
It's because you saw too many shocking visions today.

529
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:19,310
You think so?

530
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:24,690
Go sleep in your bed. That way, you can perform to your best ability again tomorrow.

531
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:26,250
What about you?

532
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,950
I'm going to go home soon.

533
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:33,010
I'll take you home.

534
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:34,550
Let's go.

535
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:41,470
- The homeless murder case? 
 - Yes.

536
00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:45,050
Yeah, that case bothers me the most.

537
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:49,340
The day Kang Geun Taek abducted me, he said his ID card was fake.

538
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:52,240
I still haven't found the real owner of the ID card.

539
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:56,580
So he killed homeless people to get his hands on others ID cards.

540
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:59,980
There are a few more murder cases other than that.

541
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:02,820
I'll have to look into them first.

542
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:07,380
There's something I've been unable to understand.

543
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:08,180
What is it?

544
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:12,290
Who is the person Kim Gab Yong mentioned?

545
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:15,200
  I see you aren't dead yet, Kang Hee Sook. 

546
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:19,750
 I'm sorry, but the higher-up doesn't want any future trouble. 

547
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:23,690
I also don't know.

548
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:26,600
In the worst case scenario...

549
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:30,010
Hyung's mother?

550
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:46,580
  Hardware Store  

551
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:50,920
  Knife  

552
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:54,530
 Kang Eun Joo attempted suicide the day she found out 

553
00:47:54,530 --> 00:47:59,720
 the deaths of Kang Hee Sook and Park Soo Young. It keeps bothering me. 

554
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:13,550
  I know that you're watching. 

555
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:16,400
  If the only way to stop you is 

556
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:19,910
  that method, 

557
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:22,420
  I'll have no choice to take that path. 

558
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:28,770
Did you mean that you would come to see me?

559
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:33,270
Sure.

560
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:35,460
Let's meet.

561
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:39,550
As the bait to find Eun Joo,

562
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:43,730
there's nothing as good as you.

563
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,460
  Seoheun Community Security Center  

564
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:50,320
    Eliminate Panhandling in 100 days   

565
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:58,320
Ghost station?
  Saeki-dong Ghost Station 

566
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:01,280
Their hiding place was a ghost station.

567
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,210
Of the children who were allured by the panhandler,

568
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:06,940
most of them did not have a resident registration number

569
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:10,040
and were confined with a metal chain around their necks.

570
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,360
What? Metal chain?

571
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:16,880
Where are the files on the confinement case from Detective Eun?

572
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:26,730
Here.

573
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:29,910
  Mental Certificate 

574
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:31,390
  Wanted: Kangryung-si Iron Factory Confinement Case Suspect 

575
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:34,960
  I remember your face.  

576
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,230
  You took my dad's clothes.  

577
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:45,880
  The scar on the culprit's neck,  

578
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:48,970
that was from the metal chains too.

579
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:54,060
What do you mean? Explain it so it makes sense.

580
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:57,080
  Saeki-dong Ghost Subway 

581
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,540
  Transit routes Saeki-dong Station and Kangguk Station propertyless  

582
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:04,140
In 1988, tracks from Saeki-dong Station to Kangguk Station

583
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:10,330
  and a new transit route were planned but fell through.  

584
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:17,420
  Kangryung-si Iron Factory Confinement Case 
1996 (Unsolved Case) 

585
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:19,170
What is all this?

586
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:22,370
I think we've found where Kang Geun Taek may be hiding.

587
00:50:22,370 --> 00:50:24,690
Why isn't Noona here at such an important time?

588
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:26,980
She's not coming.

589
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:29,830
- What? 
 - And I'll be stepping out of this case.

590
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:30,710
Lieutenant Nam!

591
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:34,000
There's no beginning nor end to this case.

592
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:37,470
Put them away while I go on patrol.

593
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:53,230
  This is no ordinary organization. 

594
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:56,020
  They even manage YSS Construction's slush fund. 

595
00:50:56,020 --> 00:51:00,020
  You know that the YSS corruption case is not for us to put our hands on. 

596
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:04,300
  I think it would be best if you stepped away from this case. 

597
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:08,820
You knew everything.

598
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:16,980
  Psycho Ahn  

599
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:41,320
  Noona, Jae In found clues about the place that exists but doesn't exist. 

600
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,730
  Come quickly. 

601
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:45,920
How can I go see you right now?

602
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:50,350
With what right

603
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,420
do I solve this case?

604
00:51:57,090 --> 00:52:01,160
That's weird, she's been out of reach since last night.

605
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:09,830
By chance, did he appear to Ji Soo?

606
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:14,280
Hello, I am Detective Lee Seung Yong.

607
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:17,660
I've been assigned to investigate Constable Yoon's kidnapping case.

608
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:19,260
What about Detective Eun?

609
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:21,170
She's not feeling well.

610
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:23,860
Noona? Is she really sick?

611
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:26,900
The chief said so in the morning so it should be true.

612
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:30,490
Anyway, he has passed the case on to me.

613
00:52:30,490 --> 00:52:32,290
What is that...

614
00:52:32,290 --> 00:52:34,260
Sit down and talk with me for a bit.

615
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:37,720
I have no files delivered to me from Detective Eun.

616
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:51,890
From when you were kidnapped, could you slowly explain everything to me one by one?

617
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:55,440
Slowly, one by one?

618
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:56,520
Yes.

619
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,890
Oh, you must not know.

620
00:52:58,890 --> 00:53:01,890
It's time for her to go on patrol.

621
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:03,360
Right?

622
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:05,620
Yeah, right-right. I—

623
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:08,130
I will contact you later.

624
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:10,190
Work hard.

625
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:13,580
No, Constable Yoon.

626
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:15,460
Constable Yoon!

627
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:22,720
What's going on? Why is he here instead of Noona?

628
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:25,210
Being sick seems like a lie, right?

629
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,980
It seemed like Lieutenant Nam knew something.

630
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:31,950
We have no other choice. Let's go on our own.

631
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:33,560
Where?

632
00:53:39,770 --> 00:53:42,040
  1329 Sae Ki Dong Station 

633
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:52,200
  Authorized Personnel Only  

634
00:53:57,180 --> 00:54:00,070
Three years ago, in one of the cases that Prosecutor Kang was in charge of,

635
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:04,690
- there was an operation to wipe out crimes for 100 days  and where they detained the panhandler organization.
 - Ah,

636
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:06,930
- The case that he received a commendation for? 
 - Yeah.

637
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:09,320
The suspects and the victims of the case,

638
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:12,290
to put it easily, from the testimonies of the panhandling children and the organization members,

639
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:14,610
there's a place that might be what we're looking for.

640
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:17,190
And that's the Saeki-dong subway station?

641
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:19,740
It's not just any subway station.

642
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:21,460
There's a ghost station.

643
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:23,420
Ghost station?

644
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,670
Make it so I'll understand.

645
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:31,900
  The platform that we pass through is surely a place that exists. 

646
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:35,770
  But, the area below, 

647
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:38,290
  have you ever imagined what it would be? 

648
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:42,800
  30 years ago, to create a transfer subway 

649
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:45,910
  they worked on connecting the lines in the third floor of the basement.  

650
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:50,710
  But that plan fell through and now there are many unused subway stations.  

651
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:55,760
  But out of those ghost stations, Saeki-dong station is 

652
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,190
  where the panhandler organization used to hide.  

653
00:54:58,190 --> 00:55:04,760
  Also... The panhandling organization managed the children using metal chains around their necks. 

654
00:55:50,570 --> 00:55:54,220
The chain marks that were on Kang Geun Taek's neck?

655
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:58,730
Yup. Kang Geun Taek avoided the surveillance cameras through though the ghost stations

656
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:00,950
and lived his whole life out of everyone's sight.

657
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:03,780
I think as he was in the panhandling organization as a child,

658
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:06,820
he learned to move around secretly.

659
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:10,130
But would Kang Geun Taek have come here again?

660
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:13,780
It's where the panhandling organization was confined. There's no way he'd be hiding here again.

661
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:16,590
We'll at least have to search for invisible clues.

662
00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:19,020
That's your specialty.

663
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:26,180
Detective Eun, we're heading to ghost station at Saeki-dong station now.

664
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:29,810
If you hear this message, please come here quickly.

665
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:52,870
  Detective Eun, we're heading to ghost station at Saeki-dong station now. 

666
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:56,660
  If you hear this message, please come here quickly.  

667
00:57:58,130 --> 00:58:01,410
What am I supposed to do if these two go there without a plan?

668
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:08,960
  I want to apologize on behalf of my dad for wrongly accusing your father. 

669
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,080
  I am sorry.  

670
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:15,690
  I don't know if me working hard can repay the debt,  

671
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:18,230
  but I won't make the same mistake twice.  

672
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:29,190
Do you see anything?

673
00:58:29,190 --> 00:58:30,970
Not at all.

674
00:58:43,330 --> 00:58:45,450
What's that?

675
00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:48,340
Lee Ahn.

676
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:54,300
What?

677
00:59:05,130 --> 00:59:07,360
It's his.

678
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:14,260
  Detective Eun Ji Soo  

679
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:16,190
Detective Eun,

680
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:27,890
At the Saeki-dong station's ghost platform,

681
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:29,470
we found the culprit's belongings.

682
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:32,000
It seems like Kang Geun Taek came to this place.

683
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,410
How could you guys just go there with no plan?

684
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:39,250
No, I contacted you too late.

685
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:42,950
  Constable Yoon, don't ever do anything dangerous. Understood? 

686
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:45,720
It's going to take some time for me to get to Saeki-dong station.

687
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:47,720
I'll request police backup.

688
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:49,450
Okay.

689
00:59:49,450 --> 00:59:51,030
I'm sorry,

690
00:59:52,050 --> 00:59:53,870
for going so late.

691
00:59:53,870 --> 00:59:56,330
Come quickly, Detective Eun.

692
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:58,860
  Constable Yoon Jae In 
 Call Ended  

693
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:01,490
  Secret Agent  

694
01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:02,350
  Yes, Detective Eun.  

695
01:00:02,350 --> 01:00:04,460
Send backups to the Saeki-dong Station quickly.

696
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:06,570
What? Why suddenly Saeki-dong station?

697
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:09,950
It's a report that says there's evidence of Constable Yoon's kidnapper hiding there. Hurry!

698
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:13,850
Detective Eun, I am sorry but the Chief Director said no matter what happens,

699
01:00:13,850 --> 01:00:16,800
not to give you anything for the time being.

700
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,500
- What? 
 -   I am very sorry. 

701
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:21,880
 It would be no use for you to call anyone else either. 

702
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:26,690
It's all in the past.

703
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:29,960
There's nothing that will change at this point.

704
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:52,420
  No!  

705
01:00:53,110 --> 01:00:56,350
  Run away. Run, run! 

706
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:12,850
Is the picture that Kang Geun Taek stole from your house,

707
01:01:12,850 --> 01:01:14,110
this one?

708
01:01:14,110 --> 01:01:15,620
Yeah.

709
01:01:16,430 --> 01:01:18,860
I think so.

710
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:32,590
  Kang - Guk  

711
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,610
What's this?

712
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:41,690
Why is Hyung—

713
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:44,970
Why? What did you see?

714
01:02:05,470 --> 01:02:08,910
  If I were to use psychometry on myself, 

715
01:02:08,910 --> 01:02:12,190
  I've tried imagining what I would see. 

716
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:21,090
  The most painful memory of my past, 

717
01:02:23,090 --> 01:02:26,030
 it isn't the Yeongseong Apartment fire, 

718
01:02:26,030 --> 01:02:32,200
 nor the day Jae In was kidnapped. But that day, 

719
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:34,800
 at the ghost station. 

720
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:56,960
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by the 🙏🏼 Just One Touch 🙏🏼 Team at Viki   

721
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:02,480
 He is Psychometric 

722
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:05,360
♫  I'm staring at the wall  ♫

723
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:09,210
♫  Swervin' in the dark  ♫

724
01:03:09,210 --> 01:03:12,030
♫  Like a shade  ♫

725
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:17,180
♫  Shatters me again  ♫

726
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:19,990
♫  Pouring down on me  ♫

727
01:03:19,990 --> 01:03:23,520
♫  The pain even in dreams  ♫

728
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:28,250
♫   Will never set me free   ♫

729
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:30,890
 Not this side, nor that side,   

730
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:32,950
  Without a hitch,  

731
01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:35,450
  I want it to be complete until the end.  

732
01:03:35,450 --> 01:03:37,900
 What do you mean you saw them with Kang Eun Joo? 

733
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:39,660
  Hyung lured us to Saeki-dong Station.  

734
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:41,740
  He put the files there for us to find that location, 

735
01:03:41,740 --> 01:03:43,480
  Hyung!  

736
01:03:44,550 --> 01:03:48,430
  Were you the one that told Ji Soo about the Yeongseong Apartment? 

737
01:03:48,430 --> 01:03:50,230
  After the Yeongseong Apartment case, 

738
01:03:50,230 --> 01:03:53,750
  have you ever met Prosecutor Kang Seong Mo?  

739
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:55,410
  He said to go to where that guy is. 

740
01:03:55,410 --> 01:03:58,080
  Asking us to stop Hyung.  

741
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:00,300
♫  And maybe at the end  ♫
