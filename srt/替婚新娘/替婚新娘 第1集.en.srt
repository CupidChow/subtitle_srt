My name is Yueyao.

4
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:22,640
I'm an assassin,

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,770
but I've lost my memory.

6
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:26,520
My master told me

7
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:28,590
my family was murdered.

8
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:32,610
But he has always refused to tell me who the real culprit is.

9
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,030
Today,

10
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,750
my master suddenly assigned me a mission to kill someone.

-Sir.
-Sir.

00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,910
He is the commander of the Shisi Government Office.

16
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:49,230
He's the right-hand man of the current emperor,

17
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,510
in charge of Qing State's intelligence network.

18
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,030
My master said he's cold-blooded, heartless,

19
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,440
evil, and cruel.

20
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:00,040
No assassin has ever survived an attempt on his life.

21
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,180
I must kill him.

[He Yunxing, Commander of the Shisi Government Office]

23

My master promised me

24
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,830
if I kill He Yunxing,

25
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,080
he'll tell me

26
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,840
who murdered my family.

27
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,590
This is a new dart I forged for you with meteorite iron.

28
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:17,920
Combined with your poison,

29
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,050
the toxic effect will work faster.

30
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,720
I'll carefully follow your teachings, Master.

31
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,450
I'm leaving.

32
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,560
Today is He Yunxing's wedding day.

33
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,350
It's too bad that he'll be killed by me.

34
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,450
Where's the bride?

35
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:13,490
I heard Lord He hasn't even seen the bride

36
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,840
before hastily arranging this marriage.

37
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,430
If... If Lord He finds out the bride has run away,

38
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,710
it would be so embarrassing.

39
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,130
That's not our concern.

40
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:21,790

[Wedding]

44
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,390
Killing you, an evil man,

45
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:03,110
can be considered eliminating a threat to the people.

46
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,960
The wedding was delayed

47
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,350
due to an important case during the day.

48
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,150
I hope you can forgive me, Honey.

49
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,320
You're pretending to be so polite.

50
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:31,750
If I didn't know you are evil,

51
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:34,829
I might have believed this gentleman act of yours.

52
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,910
Honey, you must be tired.

53
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,190
Although our wedding was held hastily,

54
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,410
I won't miss the necessary etiquette

55
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,150
or respect.

56
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,910
It doesn't matter.

Come and lift my veil now.

Come with me.

59
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:06,030
From now on, we'll be husband and wife.

60

We'll depend on each other for survival

61

then what...

69
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,280
does this mean?

70
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:53,630

We haven't drunk cross-cupped wine yet.

81

Here's my another opportunity.

Why do I feel like I know him?

87
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:22,570
Looks like I'm not the only one who wants to kill him.

88
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:26,450
Why don't I take his life while he's injured and get this over with?

89

He just got injured in order to save me.

If I kill him now,

91
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,560
it would make me truly despicable.

92
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,460
I'll spare his life today.

Of course not.

It's a perfect opportunity to poison him.

00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,570
It's very effective and you won't feel any pain.

173
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:33,490
He Yunxing,

174
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,300
I treat you quite well.

175
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,560
Eat.

176
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:48,670
Eat.

177
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:31,310
What's with those memories?

178
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:43,710
Take them down!

179
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:44,280
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

180
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,530
[Healing the World]

181
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:45,840
Are you okay?

182
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:53,430
[General's Mansion]

183
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,750
I definitely knew He Yunxing before.

184
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:04,430
It's very likely that he knows about my past.

185
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:07,420
He might even know who murdered my family.

186
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,950
Perhaps through him,

187
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,700
I can find some clues.

188
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,480
What's this fragrance?

189
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,820
I think I smelt it somewhere before.

190
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:55,520
Mother!

191
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,870
The memory is about...

192
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,510
my mother.

193
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,120
Honey!

194
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,090
You killed my husband!
