[Episode 8]

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,780
Put me down!

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,790
I'll count to three.

5
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:16,430
One.

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:17,200
Two.

7
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:18,180
Three!

8
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,430
You always count to three.

9
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:20,570
Is that all you're good at?

10
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:21,890
What are you plotting?

11
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,370
You always ruin my plans!

12
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:25,760
I'm asking you!

13
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:26,790
Are you mute?

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,060
I'm warning you.

15
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:31,510
Stop following me.

16
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:33,850
I like you!

17
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:37,190
Changning,

18
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,460
I like you.

19
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,620
I've liked you since I was a child.

20
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,990
I have never seen you as a friend.

21
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,750
Do you think I always stop you from getting close to He Yunxing

22
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:47,710
for no reason?

23
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,640
Do you think I follow you around like your tail

24
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,440
for no reason?

25
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,670
Do you think I've taken your words as the gospel since childhood

26
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,710
for no reason?

27
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:58,590
Because I like you.

28
00:00:58,910 --> 00:00:59,750
Because I, Gu Shaozhen,

29
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,610
want to be with you for a lifetime!

30
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,630
Hahaha!

31
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,270
That's so funny.

32
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,050
You must be joking, right?

33
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:12,910
You've succeeded.

34
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,270
I have something to do.

35
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:17,510
I'm leaving now.

36
00:01:17,789 --> 00:01:18,670
Good night.

37
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:20,130
Changning!

38
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:22,190
Don't follow me.

39
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,979
All three darts are here, not one is missing.

40
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,450
So where did He Yunxing's dart come from?

41
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,090
Changning.

42
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,710
Where have you been?

43
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,710
When I was locked inside, why didn't you come and help me?

44
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,230
I had a little incident outside just now.

45
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:03,230
What incident?

46
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,270
Stop asking me.

47
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,510
It has been resolved.

48
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,970
And now it's my turn to ask you.

49
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,900
Has He Yunxing fallen for you?

50
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,510
Well...

51
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,510
How is that possible?

52
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,110
Nothing has happened between us.

53
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,310
What? Oh.

54
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,390
Really?

55
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:27,710
Really.

56
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,920
Should I swear?

57
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,050
If I'm lying, may lightning strike me.

58
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,670
Well, it seems that the medicine didn't work.

59
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,510
Well... yes.

60
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:34,430
This dart was specially made by Master.

61
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,470
Why does He Yunxing have it?

62
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,650
What's his connection with Master?

63
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,770
Master sent me to kill him.

64
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,670
Do they have some deep-seated grudge?

65
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,750
What do novels usually say?

66
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,140
Former lovers turn into enemies?

67
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,150
Do you really

68
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,800
not have any feelings for me at all?

69
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,390
No, no, no.

70
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,600
It seems that He Yunxing likes girls.

71
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,329
Actually,

72
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,100
He Yunxing

73
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,020
is quite a good person.

74
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,390
Yueyao,

75
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,750
when dealing with serious matters,

76
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,190
don't let other thoughts distract you.

77
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:17,730
Aren't you

78
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,310
going to chase after that person?

79
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,830
I've already arranged the deployment.

80
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,420
You know who that person is?

81
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:26,120
Zhao Qingqing.

82
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,910
What?

83
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:30,740
Stay close to me.

84
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:07,400
So clumsy.

85
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,960
There's a secret room here.

86
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:39,510
It's...

87
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,550
Be careful.

88
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,750
Stay close to me.

89
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,110
Stop!

90
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,150
You're asking for death.

91
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,090
Watch out!

92
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,330
Don't be afraid.

93
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,310
Zhao Qingqing?

94
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,520
Two Zhao Qingqings?

95
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,000
Master?

96
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,080
Are you alright?

97
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,320
Wait here for me to come back.

98
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,300
Who exactly are you?

99
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:21,870
After her!

100
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:22,540
Hurry!

101
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,340
Over there!

102
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,850
That way!

103
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,480
Go search over there!

104
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:30,990
Yes!

105
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:33,230
Check over here.

106
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,390
Who are you?

107
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,310
Princess, you came just in time.

108
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:03,410
I was just worried about not having anyone to escort me.

109
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,010
Gu Shaozhen!

110
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,140
Are you alright?

111
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,450
Gu Shaozhen!

112
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,410
Gu Shaozhen!

113
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,650
If you've got the guts, come at me!

114
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,880
Then I'll send you on your way!

115
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:26,820
Don't come any closer!
