[Episode 15]

3
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,120
Man'er, what's wrong?

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,320
How did you end up like this?

5
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:18,350
Man...

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:19,520
Man'er.

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:20,150
Man'er.

8
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:22,780
Man'er.

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,150
Man'er.

10
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:32,640
Are you alright?

11
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:34,710
Man'er.

12
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,750
Man'er seems to have been poisoned.

13
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,070
Let's go back first.

14
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,510
I've been practicing medicine for many years,

15
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:56,240
but I've never seen such a difficult case before.

16
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,670
She's been poisoned by a strange toxin.

17
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,050
I'm sorry, but I'm not capable.

18
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,050
I really can't do anything about it.

19
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,950
This poison is really powerful.

20
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,640
Man'er was ice-cold just now,

21
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,190
now she's burning hot.

22
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,970
What are you trying to do?

23
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,500
You want to test the poison?

24
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,110
This is no ordinary poison.

25
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:40,750
But the doctor just said

26
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,060
this poison is very difficult to cure.

27
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,789
If I don't try, Man'er will die.

28
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,110
If anyone's going to test it, it should be me.

29
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:45,840
Give it to me.

30
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,690
You have more important things to do.

31
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,320
Don't worry.

32
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:54,210
I'm the disciple you've taught by word and deed.

33
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,030
Besides,

34
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:57,150
I've just returned to your side,

35
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,640
and I've just been reunited with my father.

36
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,240
I won't do anything foolish.

37
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,830
I'll use lab mice to test the poison.

38
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:03,300
Really?

39
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,270
Alright then.

40
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:21,990
Yueyao.

41
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:23,579
Yueyao.

42
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,150
Please help me check on Gu Shaozhen quickly.

43
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,820
His wound hasn't been healing well.

44
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,470
Okay.

45
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,290
Okay.

46
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,329
Stop swaying.

47
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,200
You're making me dizzy.

48
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,579
Since when did you care so much about Gu Shaozhen?

49
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:38,150
I don't care about him.

50
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,530
I'm afraid he might die

51
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,790
and delay my schedule to return to the capital.

52
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:42,930
Oh?

53
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:44,790
Is that so?

54
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,200
I'm not here for you to tease me.

55
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,220
Are you going to help or not?

56
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:51,750
Say it.

57
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:52,470
I'll help.

58
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,030
I will.

59
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,510
I'll go

60
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:55,450
and check on

61
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,670
your Gu Shaozhen.

62
00:02:57,829 --> 00:02:58,850
-What a nuisance!
-Your Gu Shaozhen.

63
00:02:58,850 --> 00:02:59,850
Your Gu Shaozhen.

64
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,070
Let's go.

65
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,610
Your Gu Shaozhen.

66
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,030
Do you really know what you're doing?

67
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,840
Don't kill me.

68
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,790
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

69
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,440
Can't you say something nice?

70
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,310
Yueyao is now studying toxicology.

71
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,800
Medicine and poison follow the same principles.

72
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,270
How could your minor injury be difficult for her?

73
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,930
Yueyao understands poisons?

74
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,360
How do you clean the wound every time?

75
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,490
First, wash it with clean water,

76
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:25,860
then apply the ointment.

77
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,079
How can you keep washing the wound?

78
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,540
Why are you scolding her?

79
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,840
You should consider the situation even when you're being protective.

80
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,210
The wound is bandaged so tightly.

81
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:36,630
Not to mention it's blocking the circulation.

82
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,030
Don't you feel uncomfortable being so constricted?

83
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:38,750
I...

84
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,220
I don't feel uncomfortable.

85
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,430
I don't feel uncomfortable at all.

86
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,840
Shut up.

87
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,200
Yueyao.

88
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:48,840
Yueyao, you're kind.

89
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,230
Then teach me.

90
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,110
How should I dress this wound?

91
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,720
When applying medicine,

92
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,579
just apply a thin layer.

93
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,390
Don't wrap the bandage too tightly.

94
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,780
Otherwise, it won't allow the wound to breathe and promote blood circulation.

95
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,510
Okay, okay.

96
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,430
I've got it.

97
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:06,470
Come on,

98
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,190
let me bandage it for you.

99
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:13,800
Are you alright,

100
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:18,680
Yueyao.

101
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,670
Is there any special prescription to help

102
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,210
heal the wound faster?

103
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:28,380
It seems Mr. Gu doesn't want to recover that quickly.

104
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:33,830
Are you still my good sister or not?

105
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,159
You should listen to me.

106
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,120
Alright.

107
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,290
I'll write you a prescription later.

108
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,710
I'll add a few herbs to it.

109
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,550
It will help him recover faster.

110
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:43,680
Changning.

111
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,430
I suddenly want to eat some osmanthus cake.

112
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:47,250
Okay.

113
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,310
I'll go get some for you.

114
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,440
Wait for me a moment.

115
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:51,310
I'm leaving too.

116
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,190
Hey, wait.

117
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:54,550
What?

118
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,440
Do me a favor.

119
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,490
Mr. Gu,

120
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,030
you still need my help?

121
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:04,700
Sister Yueyao,

122
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,890
Sister Yueyao,

123
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,260
can you

124
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,430
change the medicine for me?

125
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,490
What?

126
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,210
I can't hear you.

127
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,490
Can you help me change that medicine?

128
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,650
What's in it for me?

129
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,640
Consider it a favor I owe you.

130
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:25,870
I'll repay you later.

131
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,050
Mr. Gu,

132
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,110
a promise made

133
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,850
is hard to take back.

134
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,550
What do you mean by "hard to take back"?

135
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,870
What are you two talking about?

136
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,310
Here.

137
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,150
Mr. Gu said that since I helped him with his wound,

138
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:35,880
to thank me,

139
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,030
he owes me a favor.

140
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,150
Yes, yes, yes.

141
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,540
Then how will you repay me

142
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,409
for taking such good care of you?

143
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:43,070
Changning,

144
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,170
my wealth and life are all yours.

145
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,170
What else do you want?

146
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,500
I'll give you anything.

147
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,340
Can I just take the wealth

148
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:50,540
and leave the life to Changning?

149
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,000
Who wants his life?

150
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,020
Then I don't know.

151
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:56,390
Ouch, it hurts.

152
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,240
Let me see.

153
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,030
This is wrapped quite well.

154
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,250
Studying poisons is important,

155
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,420
but your health

156
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,890
is also important to take care of.

157
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,470
Here, drink this.

158
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,750
I thought it would be tangerine peel and red bean paste.

159
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,380
Why is it pear soup?

160
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,870
Why do you think?

161
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,700
What did you put in there?

162
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,240
Rock sugar and pears.

163
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,940
How would I know why?

164
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:23,920
Who is it?

165
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:24,900
Sir.

166
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,610
Today is the first day of the month.

167
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:30,030
As per custom, you should submit last month's reports from the Shisi Government Office to the imperial court.

168
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:32,159
I've come specifically to remind you.

169
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,380
Go ahead.

170
00:07:59,110 --> 00:07:59,990
Let's go.

Why doesn't she learn martial arts?

175
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,960
Instead, she's learning such vicious methods?

176
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,890
Her mother's identity is unusual.

177
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,690
What does that mean again?

178
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,190
Mother,

179
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,360
Father has already left.

180
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,470
These are your favorite pastries.

181
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,970
I brought them for you to try.
