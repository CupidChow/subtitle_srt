Yueyao couldn't have killed uncle.

You still want to cover for her?

I saw it with my own eyes.

8

Si Yueyao killed your uncle.

9
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,790
Aunt, are you sure you saw Yueyao

When I arrived, she was the only one here.

Who else could it be if not her?

I won’t let myself be falsely accused.

I suspect

42
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,080
General He tore out his own heart.

43

00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:22,880
the scent emanating from General He's body is very strange.

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,510
It was this scent that controlled General He,

52
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,090
making him lose his mind.

It's a piece of cake.

174
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,030
This way, General Si.

175
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:36,980
My master and madam are just ahead.

176
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,270
This way, please.

177
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:41,669
Who is that person?

178
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,000
Your father.

179
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:51,990
Yunxing.

180
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,950
Greetings, Father-in-law.

181
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:58,150
Quickly, pay your respects to your adoptive father.

182
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:58,610
Father,

183
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,270
I'm not feeling well.

184
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,920
Yunxing, can you take me back to rest first?

185
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:08,750
[General of Border Defense, Si Cheng]
