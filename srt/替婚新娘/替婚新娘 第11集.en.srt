3
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:14,430
Brother Yunxing!

4
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,240
Brother Yunxing!

5
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,270
♫A lifetime is just a few hundred months♫

6
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,240
♫Yet, by fortune, I met you♫

7
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,440
Yao, you...

8
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,350
Brother Yunxing,

9
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,350
♫Like two clouds crossing paths in the sky♫

10
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,220
I remember everything now.

11
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:12,140
♫But at different heights♫

12
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:17,310
♫We glance at each other, unaware♫

13
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,289
Yao,

14
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:16,900
no matter what happens,

15
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:20,960
♫That meeting is the start of fate, and knowing you is the start of calamity♫

16
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:20,270
I'll always be by your side.

17
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,000
♫Loving you, yet not fully♫

18
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,250
♫Then I'll leave you to the one destined for you♫

19
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:35,160
♫With a gentle brush of flower and snow♫

20
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,710
♫I spend but a few years with my love♫

21
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:41,610
♫A heart full of thoughts, yet often I smile♫

22
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:39,330
Changning!

23
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,560
Look at that bird.

24
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,150
It's so pretty.

25
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,320
Aren't...

26
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:13,990
Aren't you angry?

27
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,520
Angry?

28
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,360
Why should I be angry?

29
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,880
He Yunxing and Yueyao were like that. Don't you feel angry?

30
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,210
Isn't that a good thing?

31
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,200
I'm happy

32
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,880
to see my good friend

33
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,140
with her beloved.

34
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,910
What's there to be angry about?

35
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,890
Your good friend?

36
00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:33,650
Her beloved?

37
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,900
So you're not pursuing He Yunxing anymore?

38
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,360
I originally thought they were just putting on an act

39
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,290
and had no feelings for each other.

40
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,360
Now it seems they are in love.

41
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:49,670
So why should I disrupt their happiness and make a fool of myself?

42
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:54,340
It's great that you can see it this way.

43
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,350
I've been waiting for this day for too long.

44
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,350
So...

45
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,070
do I have a chance?

46
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,750
Well, that depends on how you behave.

47
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,720
I...

48
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:25,610
Changning!

49
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:31,960
Have some cake.

50
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,230
Doctor, please hurry.

51
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,000
Okay.

52
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,000
Sir,

53
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:27,910
Xu Yun'er's illness is strange.

54
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,240
Many doctors have no idea how to treat her.

55
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,580
We could ask Doctor Huo

56
00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:34,000
to give it a try.

57
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,020
Doctor Huo,

58
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,360
why did she get worse?

59
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,110
I'm not done yet?

60
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,140
Doctor Huo, you are indeed impressive.

61
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,120
My massage technique can only provide temporary relief.

62
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,190
The poison she has is quite unusual.

63
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,120
I need to study it carefully.

64
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,820
Thank you, Doctor Huo.

65
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:41,400
Don't you want to know where Sui Feng is?

66
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:45,150
To tell you the truth,

67
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,990
I am Sui Feng.

68
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,420
It was you who killed my mother?

69
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,480
Why did you kill my mother?

70
00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:59,460
I'll kill you!

71
00:05:59,460 --> 00:05:59,990
Yueyao!

72
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,020
Yueyao,

73
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,910
calm down.

74
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,170
Your mother was a spy for Daqiu,

75
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,960
but she betrayed Daqiu.

76
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,040
She deserved to be killed.

77
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,130
Nonsense!

78
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,840
My mother is not a spy!

79
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,540
Yao!

80
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:12,490
Yao, calm down!

81
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,970
It might be a trick.

82
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,860
Let me send you back first.

83
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:17,890
Jiu Feng!

84
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,550
Yes!

85
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,670
Keep an eye on her!

86
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:20,390
Yes.

87
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,330
[Today, I'm ordering you, Gu Shaozhen, to secretly investigate whether He Yunxing and Si Cheng]

88
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,330
[have any treasonous intentions. If there is any unusual activity, report it immediately]

89
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:36,330
His Majesty is worried that He Yunxing

90
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,510
marrying General Si's adopted daughter

91
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:41,110
will lead to too much power in the two families.

92
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,290
His Majesty ordered me to investigate secretly,

93
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:46,500
and report immediately

94
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,360
if there's any unusual activity.

95
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,400
What are you hiding?

96
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:56,430
The... the love letter for you that I haven't finished writing.

97
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,960
Who wants your love letter?

98
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:00,750
Hurry up and take your medicine.

99
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:02,460
Okay.

100
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:11,930
It tastes really good.

101
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,550
Mother,

102
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,060
were you really a spy for Daqiu?

103
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,840
How many other secrets do you have?

104
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,040
Mom.

105
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:43,860
Mom,

106
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,830
this jade pendant is so beautiful.

107
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,670
Where did you get it?

108
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,330
Here.

109
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,850
This jade pendant is a key.

110
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,050
There's a golden lock with your father.

111
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,360
Together, they symbolize

112
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,700
a perfect union

113
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,960
and unwavering love.

114
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:02,220
This is the token of love that I gave to your father.

115
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,380
What does the golden lock look like?

116
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,880
It's similar in shape to this one,

117
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:09,120
but a bit smaller.

118
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:47,070
Honey, I was originally a spy sent by Daqiu to Qing State,

119
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:50,550
hiding by your side for my mission.

120
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,710
Now, with the sudden outbreak of war between the two nations,

121
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,640
Sui Feng has ordered me to kill you.

122
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,270
However, over these years of being together,

123
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,530
you have treated me with deep affection.

124
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,580
I also deeply love you.

125
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,070
I could never bring myself to harm you.

126
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,930
After much consideration,

127
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,720
I decided to take Yao and leave you

128
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:13,090
to live in seclusion away from the world.

129
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,120
I left this divorce letter for you,

130
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,220
hoping that you will not be burdened by my identity

131
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,340
and that you have peace and prosperity in this life.

132
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,280
Yao Pan'er.

133
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:31,790
Mother,

134
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,030
you really are a spy for Daqiu.
