[The killer bride]

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,930
[Episode 19]

3
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,440
Please bless him with safety.

4
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:33,360
He Yunxing,

5
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,150
you had me worried sick.

6
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,520
How's your injury?

7
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,400
Does it hurt?

8
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,190
I came to tell you

9
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:42,470
that I'm fine.

10
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:43,550
Don't worry.

11
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:49,820
Alright.

12
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:51,320
Stop crying.

13
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,350
Look at you.

14
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,660
Your eyes are swollen.

15
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:57,990
So,

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,420
have I become ugly?

17
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:03,940
A little.

18
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,539
May you be safe and smooth in your endeavors,

19
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,820
without being burdened by me.

20
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,950
Open the door.

21
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,560
Master Mao,

22
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,750
this is our lady's bedroom.

23
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:12,590
Your behavior

24
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,510
is inappropriate.

25
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,150
Presumptuous!

26
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,480
How dare you speak to me like that?

27
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,150
I could take your head.

28
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,170
It's so early in the morning,

29
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:28,630
and you dared to anger Master Mao?

30
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,829
Just open the doorâ€”no need for all this nonsense!

31
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:32,030
Our lord has said

32
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,550
that that's our lady inside.

33
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,360
No one is allowed to harm her.

34
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:39,930
Go back first.

35
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:40,930
I'll handle this.

36
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:43,860
Go back.

37
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:44,910
I'll handle this.

38
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,530
Just go.

39
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:52,860
Master Mao,

40
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,900
please don't be angry.

41
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,500
He,

42
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:55,510
just like his master,

43
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,550
is very stubborn.

44
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,050
I'll open the door for you.

45
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,170
Master Mao,

46
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,240
after all, that's a woman inside.

47
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,160
It might be a bit inconvenient.

48
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,920
What's inconvenient about it?

49
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,390
Unless there's someone hiding inside.

50
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:13,320
Well...

51
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,670
Master Mao! Master Mao!

52
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,570
Master Mao, what are you looking for?

53
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,280
Stop pretending.

54
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,870
See?

55
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,940
There's only me in this room.

56
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:46,600
Yesterday, you humiliated my husband,

57
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,680
and today you came to humiliate me.

58
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:49,829
I know

59
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,720
you are investigating on orders,

60
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,750
but people who don't know

61
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,390
might think you're seeking personal revenge.

62
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,290
Sharp tongue.

63
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,470
Master Mao, what exactly are you looking for?

64
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,460
Don't you know

65
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,110
what I'm looking for?

66
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,670
Master Mao,

67
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,779
you're looking for me, aren't you?

68
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:23,380
Since there's nothing wrong,

69
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,550
we'll be heading back.

70
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:30,290
Guards.

71
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,680
Strengthen the guard

72
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,550
and keep a close eye on this place.

73
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:34,110
Yes.

74
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,800
Sir.

75
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,170
Sir, please save me!

76
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,480
Don't be afraid.

77
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,560
With me here,

78
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,670
no one can harm you.

79
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,659
Before, you identified Si Yueyao as Sui Feng.

80
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,870
Do you have any evidence?

81
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:03,810
Yes.

82
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,230
There are a large number of secret letters in her bedroom,

83
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:09,890
which are all evidence of her communicating with the Daqiu Court.

84
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:10,990
Nonsense!

85
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,270
Changning meant that

86
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,470
since she is not Si Yueyao's personal maid,

87
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:19,800
how would she know what's in her bedroom?

88
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,830
Unless it's a frame-up.

89
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:25,350
Whether it's true or false, I can judge for myself.

90
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:28,270
Princess, Mr. Gu, you don't need to worry about it.

91
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,280
Sir,

92
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,670
I dare not lie.

93
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,409
Before,

94
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,670
when Si Yueyao just came to the mansion,

95
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:35,840
there weren't enough servants in the household,

96
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,390
so I often accompanied her.

97
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,300
But I was just a servant

98
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,210
while she was the Young Madam.

99
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,280
Although I found her secret letters,

100
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,090
I didn't dare to say anything.

101
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,730
I didn't expect you to have such a face.

102
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:51,890
You have a wicked heart and are framing your master.

103
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,670
Yueyao even wants to save you!

104
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:02,500
Master Mao, you can't really believe what she said, can you?

105
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,920
Mr. Gu, don't worry.

106
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,710
I won't falsely accuse a good person.

107
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,430
Guards. Search.

108
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,270
Master Mao,

109
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,820
what are you doing?

110
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,190
Search!

111
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,140
Yes!

112
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,420
Man'er said

113
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:49,350
there are letters between Yueyao and the Daqiu Court in this room.

114
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,680
Found it.

115
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,020
Master Mao.

116
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,430
I once examined Si Yueyao's handwriting,

117
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,970
[He Yunxing killed the Daqiu spy, threatening the transmission]

118
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,970
[of Daqiu's confidential letters. We must eliminate him as soon as possible.]

119
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:07,310
which matches perfectly with the one on these secret letters.

120
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:14,110
Each of these letters is signed as Sui Feng.

121
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,270
The evidence is conclusive.

122
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,110
Si Yueyao,

123
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,260
what do you have to say for yourself?

124
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:31,790
Si Yueyao is Sui Feng, the spy from Daqiu.

125
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,550
Both witness and evidence are present.

126
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:37,190
He Yunxing and Si Cheng

127
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,550
didn't report Yao Pan'er's identity as a spy,

128
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,780
and now they are sheltering the Sui Feng, the spy from Daqiu.

129
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,270
Your crimes deserve punishment by death.

130
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,360
Guards.

131
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,790
Arrest He Yunxing.

132
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,870
Wait!

133
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,280
There are two divorce letters.

134
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,470
Si Cheng and He Yunxing

135
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:09,370
have long had no relations with my mother and me.

136
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,360
After they learned of our identities,

137
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,420
they abandoned us.

138
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,400
May you be safe and smooth in your endeavors,

139
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,450
without being burdened by me.

140
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,470
Yueyao.

141
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,190
Alright.

142
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:36,910
Well then,

143
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,150
arrest Si Yueyao

144
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,470
and execute her the day after tomorrow.

145
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,390
Who dares!

146
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:56,270
[Emperor]

147
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:53,420
He Yunxing,

148
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,470
seeing the golden medal is equivalent to seeing His Majesty.

149
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,150
Are you trying to rebel?

150
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,790
We still have two days.

151
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,040
Don't be impulsive.

152
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,670
I'll go with you.

153
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,580
[Emperor]

154
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,550
Yueyao...

155
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,660
[Emperor]
