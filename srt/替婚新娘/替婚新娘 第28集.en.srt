you've been quite smug these days.

13

You abused your power to eliminate dissidents.

175
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:44,650
I joined the Shisi Government Office for your sake.

176
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,580
Now that we have taken revenge,

177
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:50,390
I just want to spend the rest of my life here with you.

178
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,780
♫Hey, loving you♫

179
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:53,200
♫Is a journey where I can't control my heartbeat♫

180
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,890
♫Every breath feels sweet♫

181
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,950
Me too.

182
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,520
♫When I look into your eyes♫

183
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,820
♫I would blush, lost in memories alone♫

184
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,200
♫Dreaming of you makes everything meaningful♫

185
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,650
Are you hungry?

186
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,250
♫I give you♫

187
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,140
Yes.

188
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,030
♫The warmth of my hugs♫

189
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,250
What do you want to eat?

190
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,740
♫I'll make all your wishes come true♫

191
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,310
How about Red Bean Soup with Tangerine Peel?

192
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:20,420
♫No regrets, just forever with you♫

193
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,640
That's what I was thinking too.

194
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,340
♫It's love, love, love for you♫

195
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,120
Let's go.

196
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,280
♫I can't stop thinking of you, never wanting to part♫

197
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,470
My name is Si Yueyao.

198
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,290
♫With you by my side♫

199
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,800
I remember everything now.

200
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,830
♫Even the air is filled with anticipation♫

201
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,310
I have a childhood sweetheart who's like a brother to me,

202
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,470
a dedicated master,

203
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,810
♫You're my only destination♫

204
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,880
and a loyal lover.

205
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:39,650
♫No matter how hard the journey is, it's all worth it for you♫

206
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:41,230
His name is He Yunxing.

207
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,760
♫Just you and me♫

208
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,310
♫Together♫
