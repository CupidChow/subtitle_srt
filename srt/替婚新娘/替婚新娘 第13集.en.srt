[The killer bride]

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,010
[Episode 13]

3
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:14,840
You value money over your life!

4
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:24,510
Stop!

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,930
I think this one should taste pretty good.

6
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,490
Could it be that something happened to them?

7
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,750
Let's go check on them.

8
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,030
Yueyao, are you okay?

9
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:41,950
I'm fine.

10
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,990
But Xu Yun'er jumped out the window and ran away,

11
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:45,650
and He Yunxing went after her.

12
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,980
Wait for me! I'm coming too!

13
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,060
Stop!

14
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,420
Gu Shaozhen!

15
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:51,990
It's so dangerous.

16
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,450
Why did you follow me here?

17
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,920
Gu Shaozhen, why did you get hurt again?

18
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:00,910
Just some minor wounds.

19
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:01,270
I'm fine.

20
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,320
Does it hurt?

21
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,430
How did you get the border defense map?

22
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,760
Do you want it?

23
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,870
I'll sell it to you at 20% off.

24
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,670
You're badly hurt,

25
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,079
and you're still thinking about money?

26
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:30,480
This is my only chance to get out of slavery.

27
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,670
Of course, I have to seize it.

28
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:37,790
Who are you?

29
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,829
Brother Yunxing!

30
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:42,310
Yao!

31
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,320
Yao.

32
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:46,829
Yao!

33
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:55,250
Doctor, look at his hand.

34
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:57,920
Your Highness.

35
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,390
Please step aside.

36
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,580
Doctor, how're you going to treat his hand?

37
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,400
I need to pull it out.

38
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,590
Isn't there anesthetic powder?

39
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,070
I came in a hurry

40
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,710
and didn't have time to prepare it.

41
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:16,829
That won't do.

42
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,329
It's okay, Doctor.

43
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,590
Just pull it out. I'm not afraid of pain.

44
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,750
In the past, Guan Yu scraped his bones to remove poison.

45
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,350
Now, I, Gu Shaozhen, will...

46
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,960
Doctor, this won't work.

47
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,510
Look how much pain he's in.

48
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,150
If we don't pull this thorn out,

49
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,590
it will fester and cause infection over time.

50
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,250
Infection?

51
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:34,960
Yes.

52
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,510
That won't do.

53
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,770
Alright, Doctor, go ahead and continue.

54
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,220
It will be very painful when I pull it out.

55
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,550
If Mr. Gu moves too much,

56
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:42,890
it could damage the tendons,

57
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,670
and his hand might become crippled.

58
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:45,530
Your Highness,

59
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,230
please hold his arm.

60
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:47,700
Alright, alright.

61
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,110
So that we can prevent further injury.

62
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,210
Doctor.

63
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,360
Doctor, pull it out.

64
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,280
Changning.

65
00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:56,670
Changning!

66
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,310
Hold it!

67
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,390
Pull it out!

68
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,910
It's okay. It's okay.

69
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:11,590
I'm not in pain.

70
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,790
Don't cry.

71
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,350
I'm not crying.

72
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,010
It's just that my hand hurts.

73
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,040
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:21,589
I'm sorry.

75
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:22,860
It's alright.

76
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,200
Your Highness is much more effective than anesthetic powder.

77
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,310
What are you looking at?

78
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,190
Turn around.

79
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,240
You're awake?

80
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,280
Are you alright?

81
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,750
I'm fine. Did you get hurt?

82
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,870
No, I didn't. Don't worry.

83
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,150
Where's Xu Yun'er?

84
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,230
According to the plan,

85
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,220
I let her go.

86
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,310
As expected, there was a man in black waiting for her.

87
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,430
What about Man'er?

88
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,820
When I entered the room,

89
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,550
you were the only one inside.

90
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,550
She must have been taken away by that man in black.

91
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,590
It was all my fault.

92
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:19,920
I failed to protect her.

93
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,310
Their main objective is the border defense map.

94
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,470
Man'er is not that important to them.

95
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,470
Don't worry.

96
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,910
Man'er should be fine.

97
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,990
Do you think that man in black

98
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,830
could be Sui Feng?

99
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,390
You

100
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,100
should stop worrying so much.

101
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,330
I've already arranged for secret sentries.

102
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,430
If there's any movement,

103
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,030
they will report to me.

104
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,550
Your most important task now

105
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,270
is to drink this calming tea

106
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,570
and get some rest.

107
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:58,920
Be good.

108
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,310
Go to sleep.

109
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,140
What about Changning and Gu Shaozhen?

110
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,220
Changning wasn't hurt.

111
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,440
Gu Shaozhen has some minor injuries.

112
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,950
Stop worrying about others

113
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,950
and take care of yourself, alright?

114
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:44,670
Changning,

115
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,950
you made the bandage so pretty.

116
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,110
You've lost so much blood.

117
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,930
I'll make you some soup later to help you recover.

118
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,790
Are you going to make it yourself?

119
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,030
Dream on!

120
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,070
Are you alright?

121
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:52,980
Sir, General Si has returned.

122
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:55,310
He's waiting for you in the council hall.

123
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,600
Your father's back.

124
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,750
Let's get changed

125
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:06,390
and go see him.
