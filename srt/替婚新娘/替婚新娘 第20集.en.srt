8
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,030
Master Mao, you're really eager, aren't you?

9
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,430
You've even prepared the document for me to frame He Yunxing.

10
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:37,670
You know what?

11
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,110
Since I came in here,

12
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,730
I've never planned on leaving alive.

13
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:48,810

Ah, yes.

Well,

24
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,750
I learned a trick from the old folks in the harem too.

25
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,020
Today,

26
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,230
I'll try it out on you.

27
00:01:59,110 --> 00:01:59,840
Uh-oh.

28

I didn't get it right.

29

It's time for you to return to the capital.

36
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,950
Master Mao. I'm afraid what you're doing

37
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,530
smacks of framing a court official, doesn't it?

38
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,780
I'm here on imperial orders to investigate.

39
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,070
But it seems to me that you're seeking personal revenge, Master Mao!

40
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:09,950
My grandpa, His Majesty, sent you here to conduct a fair investigation,

41
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,480
yet you're trying to force a confession here.

42
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:17,030
I didn't expect Your Highness and Mr. Gu

43
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,210
to be friendly with this spy of Daqiu.

44
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,990
If His Majesty were to find out,

45
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,800
I'm afraid...

46
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,790
What are you talking about, Master Mao?

47
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,230
Her Highness and I are only here

48
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,079

49
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,430

Alright.

51

Your Highness and Mr. Gu,

52
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,650

okay?

57
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,810
Master Mao wouldn't let him in.

58
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,360
He knew Master Mao would give you a hard time,

59
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,420
so he asked us to come and check on you.

Has something happened to Yueyao?

69

Yueyao asked you not to force your way in.

70

Let's think of another way.

71
