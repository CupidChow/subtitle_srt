[The killer bride]

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,950
[Episode 10]

3
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,480
One month ago,

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,790
I received a secret message that Sui Feng was coming to Tingcheng.

5
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,360
So I came.

6
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:21,840
To ensure your safety,

7
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,190
I gave you the assassination order

8
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,600
so that you could come to Tingcheng

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:28,830
and me.

10
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:32,270
Yao.

11
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,040
How could I have forgotten all of this?

12
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,750
How could I have forgotten the murderer who killed my mother?

13
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,320
I deserve to die.

14
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:42,450
I really should die.

15
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,090
Yao, don't be like this.

16
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,070
You have tried.

17
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,710
You sought revenge against him.

18
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,170
You almost lost your life.

19
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:51,220
As long as we're both alive now,

20
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,320
we still have a chance for revenge.

21
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,110
No matter what happens,

22
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,310
I will always be by your side.

23
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,750
But...

24
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:06,090
I don't remember anything about us.

25
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,760
If I can't remember in the future,

26
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:13,990
will you resent me?

27
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:15,750
No,

28
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,240
I've thought about it.

29
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,460
If you don't remember me,

30
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,310
I will still seek revenge against Sui Feng.

31
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,230
Then,

32
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,030
I'll try again

33
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,020
to make you fall in love with me again.

34
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:31,730
This way,

35
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,740
we'll have new memories.

36
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:39,830
Thank you, He Yunxing.

37
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,430
So they have such deep feelings for each other.

38
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:11,550
No wonder He Yunxing would rather die than marry me.

39
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,340
However,

40
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,030
this also shows that I didn't misjudge him.

41
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:20,840
You're back.

42
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,690
I, a noble princess,

43
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,570
have never taken care of someone's daily needs.

44
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,070
That damn Gu Shaozhen,

45
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,230
making me personally apply medicine for him every time.

46
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,280
I'm exhausted to death.

47
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,320
Yueyao.

48
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,270
Yueyao!

49
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,430
Are you alright?

50
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,430
Changning.

51
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,079
I know you like He Yunxing very much.

52
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,040
But if I can't help you anymore,

53
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,730
you won't blame me, will you?

54
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,290
Hey, no one can really control

55
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,110
the matters of feelings.

56
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,970
I admit my attitude towards you wasn't good at first,

57
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,090
but later I saw how sincerely you helped me several times.

58
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,340
I know that.

59
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,270
It's okay.

60
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,420
If we can't be lovers, we can still be friends, right?

61
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,560
Besides,

62
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,150
this time I came,

63
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,880
I gained you as a good sister.

64
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,000
Changning is so open-hearted with me,

65
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,370
and He Yunxing's feelings for me are so deep.

66
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,390
What should I do now?

67
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,230
Yueyao,

68
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,329
what are you thinking about?

69
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:41,730
I'm also very happy to have you as such a good sister.

70
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,790
I didn't expect you to be so carefree.

71
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:47,480
But when I think of that damn Gu Shaozhen,

72
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,150
I can't be so carefree.

73
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,190
Yueyao, you don't know how annoying he is.

74
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:55,040
He sticks to me every day and I can't shake him off.

75
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,480
[Prison]

76
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,810
Tell me, Xu Yun'er,

77
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,370
what's your real purpose?

78
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,030
I'm just a vain woman,

79
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,270
who wants to be a general's wife,

80
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,790
living a glamorous life,

81
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,960
with endless money to spend.

82
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:13,870
Is that wrong?

83
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,710
You don't want to tell me the truth, do you?

84
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:18,510
I certainly have ways to make you talk.

85
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,400
Soul-controlling incense.

86
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,790
You should be quite familiar with it.

87
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,390
It's Sui Feng's secret drug.

88
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,340
I've heard

89
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,370
it can make people spill everything they know.

90
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,430
Today,

91
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,659
I'd like to give it a try

92
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,040
to see if it's really that effective.

93
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,909
Tell me,

94
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,110
did you kill General He

95
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,590
and frame Qiao Niang?

96
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,230
Yes,

97
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,270
it was me.

98
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,650
Let me go!

99
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,150
That day,

100
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,680
I originally intended to find He Yong

101
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,350
to force him to reveal the whereabouts of the border defense map.

102
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,740
I happened to see Qiao Niang stab He Yong.

103
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,510
Honey.

104
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,030
Save me, Honey!

105
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,410
Save me, Honey!

106
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,190
Honey.

107
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,500
What are you doing?

108
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,310
Honey.

109
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,050
Tell me,

110
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,070
where is the border defense map?

111
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,890
Honey.

112
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:31,710
Honey.

113
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,310
I used too much soul-controlling incense,

114
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,830
causing He Yong to go insane

115
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,909
and tear out his own heart, leading to his death.

116
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:44,430
Then I took Qiao Niang's cloud gauze cloak,

117
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,880
copied her face,

118
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,760
created a disguise mask,

119
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,960
and framed Qiao Niang.

120
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,950
Are you Sui Feng?

121
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,540
Did you kill my mother?

122
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,470
Yao!

123
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,010
Yao!

124
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,040
Yao, calm down, please calm down.

125
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,200
I've told you

126
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,840
everything I can.

127
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:07,430
Let...

128
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:07,910
Let...

129
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,530
Let me go, please.

130
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,310
Are you Sui Feng?

131
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,590
Tell me!

132
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:13,320
Yao,

133
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,430
she's not Sui Feng.

134
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:15,790
Calm down.

135
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,320
Tell us, where is Sui Feng?

136
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:18,270
I...

137
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:18,900
I...

138
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,840
I don't know.

139
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:26,550
Jiu Feng!

140
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,030
Yes.

141
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,810
Take her away.

142
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:29,830
Don't let her die.

143
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,350
Yes.

144
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,080
Yao,

145
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,670
Yao, calm down, please calm down.

146
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:42,990
How could they torture my mother like this?

147
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,990
How much pain you must have been in, Mother.

148
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:49,960
Yao.

149
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:53,000
Take a moment to compose yourself.

150
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:53,710
Yao.

151
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,600
Yao.

152
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:56,560
Yao!

153
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,310
Brother Yunxing.

154
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,560
When I grow up, can I be your bride?

155
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,500
Of course.

156
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,360
This is for you.

157
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,890
Is it pretty?

158
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,410
It's beautiful.

159
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,530
From now on, I'll keep this sachet

160
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,880
with me always.

161
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:39,950
Mother!

162
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,600
Don't run!

163
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,360
Mother!

164
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,350
Mother!

165
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,400
What's wrong with you, Mother?

166
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:48,690
Yao.

167
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,740
You must

168
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,210
live well.

169
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:57,670
Mother.

170
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:58,810
Mother.

171
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,830
Mother!

172
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,530
Mother, don't leave me!

173
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:04,470
Mother.

174
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:05,990
Mother!

175
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:06,990
Mother!

176
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,020
