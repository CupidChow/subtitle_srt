[The killer bride]

2
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,900
[Episode 3]

3
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,340
I have such a beautiful daughter?

4
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,570
You're a lucky guy.

5
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,070
Didn't you say you'd come at noon, Sir?

6
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,030
Why are you here already?

7
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,580
I was eager to see my daughter.

8
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,040
After all, I've never seen her before.

9
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:46,980
After all, you see,

10
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,660
I sent you up to the mountain when you were little

11
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,140
to learn skills,

12
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,640
and now you've grown up so much.

13
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,030
I haven't seen you at all.

14
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,090
If you walked down the street now,

15
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,820
I wouldn't even recognize you.

16
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,180
Yes, Father.

17
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,440
I... I wouldn't recognize you either.

18
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,670
Yueyao,

19
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:13,330
from now on, I'll take care of you.

20
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,400
If anyone dares to bully you,

21
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,310
just tell me.

22
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,110
I'll have your back.

23
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,030
The old general's armor is cold,

24
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,690
but his embrace is so warm.

25
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,430
Is this what it feels like to have a father?

26
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,590
These fragrant balms are made from

27
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,060
materials that are extremely hard to obtain.

28
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,360
This Du Juan

29
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:55,030
must not be an ordinary spice merchant.

30
00:01:58,650 --> 00:01:59,710
Didn't I tell you?

31
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,350
You don't need to worry about this case.

32
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,500
A living person suddenly disappeared

33
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,039
from the mansion.

34
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,430
This Du Juan must have already

35
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,580
escaped from the General's Mansion.

36
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,150
My Lady, that's impossible.

37
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,030
On the night of the incident,

38
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,270
I dispatched heavy troops to seal off the General's Mansion.

39
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,170
Even if she had wings,

40
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,300
she couldn't possibly have flown out.

41
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,360
So, you're saying

42
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,160
that no living person

43
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,860
can get out of the General's Mansion now?

44
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,810
Lift the coffin!

45
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,390
Guards.

46
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,110
Open the coffin lid.

47
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:45,710
Yes!

48
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:46,200
Stop!

49
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,160
What are you doing?

50
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,960
How can you dishonor your uncle's spirit?

51
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,800
Prepare some firewood.

52
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,280
Do it.

53
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:02,350
Yes.

54
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,470
Aunt.

55
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,760
Have you noticed the strange odor

56
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,770
from the coffin?

57
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,880
This is a plague that is highly contagious.

58
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,570
If you don't believe me,

59
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:27,380
you can check for any rashes on your body

60
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,980
accompanied by mild itching.

61
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,340
I still won't let you open the coffin.

62
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,060
Don't worry, Aunt.

63
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,510
We won't open the coffin.

64
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:45,220
We just want to give Uncle a high-standard cremation.

65
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,360
This way,

66
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,190
not only will it honor Uncle,

67
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,990
but it will also prevent everyone from getting infected.

68
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:51,990
What do you think?

69
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,550
She has a point.

70
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,570
Let's go with her suggestion.

71
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:13,590
Set up the firewood

72
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,340
and get ready to light the fire.

73
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,140
Light the fire.

74
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,580
Guards.

75
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,500
Open this coffin lid.

76
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,650
Sir, don't burn it.

77
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:40,230
I am the Du Juan you're looking for.

78
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,430
But I didn't kill him.

79
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:44,830
Guards.

80
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,310
Take Du Juan to the interrogation room.

81
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,010
-Yes!
-Yes!

82
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:49,470
Go!

83
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,150
Hurry up!

84
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,620
Go!

85
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,040
This is something your adoptive father asked me to pass on to you.

86
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,270
You should go back and get some rest.

87
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,370
What about you?

88
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,350
I'm going to interrogate Du Juan.

89
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,350
I want to go too.

90
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,430
When Shisi Government Office is handling a case,

91
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,890
outsiders must stay away.

92
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,830
I'm your wife.

93
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,960
I'm not an outsider.

94
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,480
You found Du Juan for me.

95
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:28,880
And I'm very grateful to you.

96
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,410
But as for

97
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,550
finding the murderer,

98
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,590
you should leave it at that.

99
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,450
Do you think I can't persuade you?

100
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:49,950
Brother Yunxing,

101
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,190
can I just hold you like this

102
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,860
and never let go

103
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,420
for the rest of my life?

104
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,380
Okay.

105
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:08,800
Honey,

106
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,470
just take me with you.

107
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,120
Is it that

108
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:16,520
if I don't agree,

109
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,030
you will keep this up forever?

110
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:31,910
Then you'd better

111
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,600
never let go

112
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,840
for the rest of your life.

113
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,220
He Yunxing!

114
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,320
Princess.

115
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,640
Mr. Gu.

116
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,100
No need for formalities.

117
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,050
After hearing that General He was killed by a spy,

118
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,330
[Gu Shaozhen, the heir of the Marquis of Anguo]

119
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,770
Princess Changning and I are quite concerned.

120
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,070
We specially requested His Majesty's permission to come to Tingcheng to assist in the investigation.

121
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,250
Lord He, Madam He, my condolences.

122
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,330
[Princess Changning]

123
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,720
He Yunxing rejected our marriage arrangement because of you?

124
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,040
Princess,

125
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,440
you've misunderstood me.

126
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,300
I'm just an imposter.

127
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,310
You hugged him in public.

128
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:23,150
You don't look dignified as someone from a noble family.

129
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,700
This is a private matter between us as husband and wife,

130
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,640
so you don't need to worry about it, Princess.

131
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,150
You...

132
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:33,190
I...

133
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,000
Come here.

134
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:37,970
Let go of me!

135
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,750
The Princess and I have traveled for two days

136
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,320
and are exhausted.

137
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,340
Could you arrange accommodation for us first?

138
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,710
The official inn is nearby.

139
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,909
I'll have someone arrange for you to go there right away.

140
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:46,270
No.

141
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:52,790
I want to stay here.

142
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:58,730
Honey.

143
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,460
It's getting late.

144
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:01,760
Let's go back to our room and rest.

145
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,870
Actually,

146
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,460
He Yunxing is a good person.

147
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,210
Since I'm just an imposter, I shouldn't hold him back.

148
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:06,890
How about I help

149
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,780
match him with Princess Changning?

150
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,540
No need.

151
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,680
No need.

152
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,440
Well...

153
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:16,430
I mean,

154
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:17,460
Honey,

155
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:20,210
I'll go arrange the Princess's accommodation.

156
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,110
Let's go.

157
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:24,220
How dare you!

158
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:26,120
What's with

159
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,990
all this pulling and tugging on me?

160
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,590
Don't stand on the ceremony.

161
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,490
Just come with me.

162
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,309
Let go!

163
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:33,940
Insolent!

164
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:34,909
Hurry up!

165
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,650
Princess, you have a crush on He Yunxing, don't you?

166
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,650
Isn't it obvious?

167
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:39,429
It is.

168
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,549
It's obvious.

169
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,130
How about I help you?

170
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:43,880
Really?

171
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,510
You're his lawful wife now.

172
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,470
Why do you want to help me?

173
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,910
Being with him

174
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,030
is out of necessity.

175
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,070
Sooner or later, I will divorce him.

176
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,120
Why do you want to divorce him?

177
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,910
Because I'm not worthy of him.

178
00:08:59,190 --> 00:08:59,990
That's why...

179
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,710
I want to help you.

180
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,680
You're quite self-aware.

181
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,460
I'm listening.

182
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,030
How do you plan to help me?

183
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,330
To break up a marriage,

184
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:19,150
one needs to start by separating the bedrooms.

185
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,910
From now on,

186
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:24,030
you will sleep with me.

187
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,460
[General's Mansion]

188
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,240
So you're saying

189
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,810
that Du Juan is just a greedy spice merchant

190
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,680
who came to the mansion, spreading balms,

191
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,310
to confuse the clues and conceal the real culprit in exchange for money?

192
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:41,840
Exactly.

193
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,360
Then who gave her the money?

194
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,340
The identity of this person has not yet been determined.

195
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,970
However, Du Juan has confessed

196
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:49,520
that there is something in her home outside the city

197
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,650
that can prove this person's identity.

198
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,580
A woman's outerwear?

199
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,900
A disguise mask?

200
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:34,840
Why are you here?

201
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,470
I...

202
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,400
I'm here to help you investigate the case.

203
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,430
Didn't I tell you

204
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,700
not to get involved in this case?

205
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:43,120
Give it to me.

206
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,520
I'll give it to you if you let me investigate the case with you.

207
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,640
Give it to me.

208
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:48,770
No.

209
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,280
You...

210
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,020
What are you...

211
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,890
doing?

212
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,320
What do you think I'm going to do?

213
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,170
In broad daylight, how can you...

214
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:01,630
You...
