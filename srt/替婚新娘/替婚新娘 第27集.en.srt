00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,920
[Episode 27]

3
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:16,550
Mr. Gu,

4
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,650
we've found traces of Lord He.

5
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:19,450
Good!

6
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,160
Close in on them!

7
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:22,130
-Yes!
-Yes!

8
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:26,080
Yueyao,

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,070
calm down!

10
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:28,350
I'm Yunxing.

11
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,210
Yueyao!

12
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:37,370
I can't just sit by and do nothing.

13
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,050
God bless us.

14
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,110
I hope after Grandpa receives the letter,

15
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,570
he can distinguish between right and wrong.

16
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:02,890
Yueyao.

17
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,530
Has he left?

18
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,460
He's left.

19
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,150
Untie me.

20
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,600
How's your wound?

21
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,210
It's nothing serious.

22
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,160
Take this.

23
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:35,259
Your acting skills have really improved.

24
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,430
Of course. My master taught me well.

25
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:38,970
I didn't expect that

26
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,020
you managed to develop the antidote for the soul-controlling incense so quickly.

27
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,479
I knew you'd understand it was the antidote.

28
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,590
What should we do now?

29
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,310
Meet up with Shaozhen.

30
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,430
I left marks on my way here.

31
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:54,759
He's on his way here.

32
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:55,479
Let's go.

33
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,310
Stop right there!

34
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,950
So you weren't poisoned.

35
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,100
Prepare to die!

36
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,970
Your dart skills have improved.

37
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,880
You two,

38
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,610
where do you want to go?

39
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,990
We want to kill you.

40
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,430
I'll kill you personally

41
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,829
to avenge my mother.

42
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,110
You should have the ability before you talk big.

43
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,800
Let's find out then.

44
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,500
Yunxing!

45
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,150
Yunxing.

46
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,450
Are you alright?

47
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:31,829
I'm fine.

48
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,530
Be careful.

49
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,870
Lord He, you're quite affectionate.

50
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,750
Now you're still risking your life to protect her

51
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,110
like you did four years ago.

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,320
What a pity.

53
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:49,390
Today, you're going to be a dead couple.

54
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,990
A stone?

55
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,040
Child's play.

56
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,030
The stone is poisonous!

57
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,090
Yueyao!

58
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,400
We've taken care of the spies outside.

59
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,600
Are you guys alright?

60
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,750
Take care of him.

61
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,150
I'm going after Sui Feng.

62
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,350
Come on.

63
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,760
Be careful.

64
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,040
Let's go.

65
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,670
After him!

66
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:45,470
-Yes!
-Yes!

67
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,270
Si Yueyao!

68
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,480
Show yourself!

69
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,910
Aren't you ashamed of being sneaky?

70
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,810
Don't you like to hurt people sneakily?

71
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,390
You've been poisoned by my muscle-relaxing powder.

72
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,730
You can't escape.

73
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,220
Sui Feng,

74
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,790
do you admit your mistakes?

75
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,970
Mistakes?

76
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:41,390
My only mistake was I showed mercy

77
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,830
and didn't kill you two back then.

78
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,220
You killed so many people,

79
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,710
but you feel no remorse at all!

80
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,190
Remorse?

81
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,880
The people of Qing State are all lowly scumbags.

82
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:58,810
Why should I feel any remorse for killing scumbags?

83
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,910
Your mother included.

84
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,830
She betrayed Daqiu.

85
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,120
She deserved to die!

86
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,750
You...

87
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,240
Back then,

88
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,480
you used the soul-controlling incense to torture my mother.

89
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,150
Today,

90
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,080
it's your turn to taste what it's like.

91
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,850
Yueyao.

92
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,150
I finally avenged my mother.

93
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:59,710
These show the places where Daqiu's army stores its provisions.

94
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:03,120
Tell General Si to lead an army to destroy them immediately.

95
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,910
Deliver them to the military camp now!

96
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:05,600
-Yes!
-Yes!

97
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,810
Let's go back first.

98
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:19,410
Master Mao, you came at the perfect time.

99
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,510
Mr. Gu, thank you for leading the way.

100
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:25,650
Otherwise, I wouldn't have been able to find He Yunxing, the traitor.

101
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,470
Master Mao,

102
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,630
He Yunxing has never intended to betray Qing State.

103
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,790
Everything he did

104
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,590
was to catch Sui Feng, Daqiu's spy.

105
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,110
I'm going to say it again.

106
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:35,770
Yueyao is not Sui Feng.

107
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:39,090
Sui Feng has been hiding in Qing State all this time.

108
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,669
He is Doctor Huo, a quack.

109
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:44,600
We found many secret letters of Daqiu here.

110
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,560
Man'er can also testify for us.

111
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:51,030
Even if Si Yueyao is not Sui Feng,

112
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,400
you, He Yunxing, ignored the safety of Qing State

113
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:56,030
and stole the border defense map to save your wife

114
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,230
for the sake of your personal feelings.

115
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,840
According to Qing State's law,

116
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,440
I can execute you on the spot!

117
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:02,470
Guards!

118
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,100
Wait!

119
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,830
He Yunxing already told General Si to reorganize the border defenses

120
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,290
before he took action.

121
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,990
We should report the truth to the court now.

122
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,120
Matters of right and wrong

123
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,310
should be decided by His Majesty!

124
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,560
I'm here to handle the case under His Majesty's order.

125
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,770
Who dares to stop me?

126
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:17,590
Guards!

127
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,270
Kill He Yunxing!
