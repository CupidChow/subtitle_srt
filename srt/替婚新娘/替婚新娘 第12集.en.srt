[Episode 12]

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,110
Mother,

4
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,390
you really are a spy for Daqiu.

5
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:25,680
Si Cheng?

6
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,750
My real father

7
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,310
is General Si?

8
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,400
Yao, what's wrong?

9
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,390
General Si?

10
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:01,630
Yao,

11
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,920
it seems that this

12
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,430
was all destined from fate.

13
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,630
Your mother has been watching over you,

14
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:11,150
which is why you can be reunited with your father.

15
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,160
But...

16
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:18,830
how am I supposed to tell Father?

17
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:20,850
Right now,

18
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:23,590
the situation at the frontline is still tense.

19
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,870
Let's wait for Dad to come back first.

20
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:26,950
Alright.

21
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,150
Sir, bad news.

22
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,430
Xu Yun'er is missing.

23
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:41,110
When did Xu Yun'er go missing?

24
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,310
The kitchen sent food once last night,

25
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,270
and the doctor also brought her medicine once.

26
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,130
The guard said

27
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:49,070
Xu Yun'er was in her room the whole time last night.

28
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,220
He saw her through the window.

29
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,710
But this morning, when he came to deliver food,

30
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,240
he found Xu Yun'er was gone.

31
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,810
Xu Yun'er is injured.

32
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,030
She will definitely leave behind some traces.

33
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:03,870
There.

34
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,110
The Storm Pear Blossom Needles?

35
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,430
That.

36
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,160
Give me that.

37
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,780
The box for the border defense map?

38
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,310
This Xu Yun'er, even while injured,

39
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,650
not only killed the guard

40
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,510
but also managed to take the border defense map.

41
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,610
This spy

42
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,190
is truly impressive.

43
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,040
In fact, the one who's impressive is our Lord.

44
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,570
Xu Yun'er was deliberately let go by our Lord.

45
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,470
The border defense map is fake.

46
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,829
I'm going to lure the snake out of its hole.

47
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:45,890
So what do we do now?

48
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,550

49
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:48,320
set up secret sentries.

50
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,150
If there's any sign of Xu Yun'er,

51
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,220
report to me immediately.

52
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:51,740
Yes.

54
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,300
Where is the border defense map?

55
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,420
I'm sorry.

56
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,630
I didn't get the border defense map.

57
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,590
Please forgive me.

58
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,810
I will investigate thoroughly as soon as possible

59
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,870
and retrieve the border defense map.

60
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,940
If you fail to get the map,

61
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,470
you know what the consequences will be.

62

Since we are here at the frontier,

66
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,680
we should enjoy ourselves thoroughly before heading back to the capital.

67

Changning,

68
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:52,829
do you have any wishes?

69
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,910
I want...

70
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,030
I want to taste all the delicacies of Tingcheng

71

and see all the scenery of the frontier.

72

I'll arrange everything tomorrow.

What are you doing?

77
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,460
Yueyao, have a seat.

78
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,670
I was just about to tell you.

79
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,320
I'm moving out now.

80
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,560
I've stayed here for so long.

81
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,240
It's time for me to make room for He Yunxing.

82
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,560
Why?

83
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,170
Are you still mad at me?

84
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,790
How could I, a noble princess,

85
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:27,910
be angry with you?

86
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,830
I've already moved on.

87
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,560
Changning,

88
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,600
about what happened before,

89
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,630
it was my fault.

90
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,470
This jade pendant looks like it's made with Daqiu craftsmanship.

91
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,870
I will certainly do it without hesitation.

92
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,140
You two sisters don't need to be so formal.

93

If Changning says she has moved on, then she surely has.

94

The craftsmanship of your jade pendant is quite exquisite.

97
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,680
Was it a gift from He Yunxing?

98
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,020
No.

99
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,909
It's a keepsake my mother left me.

Yueyao,

you poor thing.

102
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,870
You lost both your parents when you were young

103
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,430
and were left all alone.

104

Don't worry,

Let's not get in the way.

Why don't we

116
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,470
just bring some food back for Yueyao?

117

How about that?

Yes, yes, yes.

Have you noticed anything suspicious?

137
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,420
That day, after Xu Yun'er met with Doctor Huo,

138
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,130
she suddenly changed her story

143

his technique was very strange,

as if he was telling her something.

Are you suspecting that Doctor Huo is Xu Yun'er's superior, Sui Feng?

Sir.

174
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,020
[General's Mansion]

175
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,100
A secret sentry reported

176
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,760
that Xu Yun'er was spotted at Heyue Restaurant.

177
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:13,450
Let's go.

178
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:18,860
[General's Mansion]

179
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,270
Impressive zither playing.

180
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,250
Sir, Miss, what would you like to eat?

181
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,060
What specialty do you have here?

182
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,590
How about Crystal Hibiscus Dumplings for your wife?

183
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,870
It's a favorite dessert among the ladies of Tingcheng.

184
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,070
What nonsense are you talking about?

185
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,230
I'm not his wife.

186
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:33,750
Alright, we'll go with that.

187
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,350
Bring it quickly.

188
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,880
Got it! I guarantee your wife will be pleased.

189
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,820
Why are they here too?

190
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,400
Let's focus on ourselves.

191
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,530
Don't disturb them.

192
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,550
Keep enjoying the music.

193
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:01,640
I heard the border defense map of Qing State is in your hands.

194
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:02,570
That's right.

195
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,960
The border defense map is with me.

196
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:08,450
But this border defense map is a highly sought-after item,

197
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,800
so the price

198
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,790
naturally won't be low.

199
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:15,690
Is this enough?

200
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,890
Where's the map?

201
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:19,920
It's you?

202
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,360
Who are you?

203
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,590
It's you!

204
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,610
Give me the map.

205
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:30,570
No!

206
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,640
You value money over your life!

207
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,250
Stop!
