[The killer bride]

2
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,840
[Episode 16]

3
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,710
Mother.

4
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,680
Father has already left.

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,030
These are your favorite pastries.

6
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:26,710
I brought them for you to try.

7
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,630
[Grave of my late mother Yao Pan'er]

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,470
Isn't this a ritual used only by people from Daqiu?

9
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:36,070
Oh, right.

10
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,470
Also,

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,950
this fruit tea.

12
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,990
Father specifically instructed me to bring it.

13
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:48,770
Daqiu fruit tea.

14
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:50,990
Her mother is from Daqiu?

15
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:56,270
Could

16
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,780
Yueyao's mother be a Daqiu spy?

17
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,800
Si Cheng and He Yunxing

18
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,320
are both protecting her and her mother?

19
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:18,539
Mr. Gu.

20
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,539
You must personally hand this to His Majesty.

21
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:22,630
Don't let anything happen to it.

22
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:23,180
Do you understand?

23
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:23,630
Yes.

24
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,520
In case this letter is intercepted,

25
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,390
I need to have a backup plan.

26
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:39,620
Gu Shaozhen.

27
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,390
You're sending secret messages to my grandfather.

28
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:44,860
You...

29
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,039
How did you know?

30
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,940
Those are the red-feathered carrier pigeons specially raised by my grandfather.

31
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,000
I've seen them since I was a child.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,130
How could I not know?

33
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,610
I...

34
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,479
You...

35
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,900
You're hiding something from me.

36
00:01:59,150 --> 00:01:59,880
I...

37
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,980
[By today's secret order, Gu Shaozhen is to conduct a covert investigation into]

38
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,980
[whether He Yunxing and Si Cheng have any treasonous intentions. Any unusual activities must be reported immediately.]

39
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:10,690
So,

40
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,370
on the surface, you came to Tingcheng to supervise the case,

41
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,570
but actually you are here to spy on Si Cheng and He Yunxing.

42
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,820
Throughout history,

43
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,470
marriages between powerful officials have always been extremely sensitive matters.

44
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,150
Now,

45
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,640
I've discovered that Yueyao's mother is a spy from Daqiu.

46
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,579
Si Cheng and He Yunxing knew about this

47
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:29,640
but kept it hidden.

48
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,740
Yueyao's identity is also unclear.

49
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,050
If she's also a spy,

50
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,900
if something goes wrong,

51
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,079
it would be a major threat to the country and the people.

52
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:37,870
I can't not report it.

53
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,950
I know Yueyao

54
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,070
better than anyone.

55
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,900
Even if her mother was a spy,

56
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,680
she definitely isn't one.

57
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,520
If you don't believe me,

58
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,930
we can ask her directly in front of Yueyao.

59
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:49,740
Let's go.

60
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,120
Well.

61
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,310
Listen to me, Changning.

62
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,570
The princess is right.

63
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:55,660
Yueyao.

64
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,340
He Yunxing.

65
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,360
You and Si Cheng knew Yueyao's mother was a spy

66
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,510
but kept it hidden.

67
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,990
What are you plotting?

68
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,110
What I've been aiming for

69
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,670
has always been Yueyao's safety.

70
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,320
As for you, Mr. Gu,

71
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,110
are you trying

72
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,950
to destroy both the Si and He families?

73
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,550
I swear,

74
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:23,490
I never thought of it that way.

75
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,440
Yueyao's mother was indeed a spy,

76
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,240
but back then,

77
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,880
she never did anything to harm Qing State.

78
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,820
Instead, her feelings for General Si Cheng

79
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,100
made her willing to sacrifice herself.

80
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,260
Doesn't such true love deserve protection?

81
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:34,890
This...

82
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,370
My mother was indeed a spy.

83
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,740
But she also deeply loved my father.

84
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,180
Otherwise, she wouldn't have given up the chance to save her own life,

85
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,920
taking me into seclusion,

86
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,000
and ultimately being killed by Sui Feng.

87
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,210
I have half Daqiu blood in me.

88
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,570
but I was born in Qing State,

89
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:54,870
grew up in Qing State.

90
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,579
All my family and friends are in Qing State.

91
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,870
I also have half Qing blood in me.

92
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,590
I will never betray Qing State.

93
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,080
I truly don't know the inside story.

94
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,590
But even if I keep it hidden,

95
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,590
if it ever comes to light,

96
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,800
you'll all be punished.

97
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,220
As the head of the Shisi Government Office,

98
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,550
you should know better than I do.

99
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,950
If His Majesty blames us,

100
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,040
I'll take full responsibility.

101
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,300
For the sake of a woman,

102
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:18,430
is it worth it?

103
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,920
If Changning was in danger now,

104
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,710
would you think it's worth it?

105
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,810
If because of my affairs,

106
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,810
Father and He Yunxing get involved,

107
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,640
I'd rather die myself.

108
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,930
Why are you all staring at me?

109
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,830
I never intended to put anyone in mortal danger.

110
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:46,270
Yes.

111
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,930
I admit I was a bit reckless.

112
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:48,760
I apologize.

113
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,230
Yueyao, I'm sorry.

114
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,350
He Yunxing, I'm sorry.

115
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,530
Fortunately, He Yunxing intercepted the secret letter.

116
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,090
Otherwise, how many people would you have harmed?

117
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:58,790
I know I was wrong.

118
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:59,790
I know I was wrong.

119
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,680
So,

120
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:06,050
please, Changning and Mr. Gu, keep this a secret for me.

121
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,930
Don't worry.

122
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,320
I will definitely keep it a secret for you.

123
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,150
I...

124
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,300
What's wrong? You don't agree?

125
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,080
I suddenly remembered.

126
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,990
To prevent the secret letter from being intercepted by the Shisi Government Office,

127
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:21,600
I...

128
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,420
I sent someone to deliver the secret letter.

129
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:28,550
I'm afraid it can't be retrieved now.

130
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,380
You...

131
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:30,750
I...

132
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:31,720
I was wrong!

133
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,380
I was wrong!

134
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,040
I was wrong.

135
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,630
I...

136
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:35,430
Idiot!

137
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,430
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

138
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,590
What should we do now?

139
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,400
Gu Shaozhen, are you kidding me?

140
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,850
You're driving me crazy!

141
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,830
If His Majesty receives the secret letter,

142
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,280
he will surely send someone to Tingcheng.

143
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,110
We'll deal with it when the time comes.

144
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,580
I'm sorry, Changning.

145
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:51,000
We must face what we have to face.

146
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,710
You're really driving me crazy!

147
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,450
I'm sorry, Changning.

148
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,950
Changning,

149
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:23,820
you can hit me or scold me,

150
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:26,530
but just don't give me the silent treatment.

151
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,470
You're really hitting me?

152
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:30,070
Well,

153
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:31,830
then go easy on me.

154
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,159
If you hurt me too much,

155
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,050
there won't be anyone to buy you delicious food anymore.

156
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:35,980
Come on, go ahead.

157
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:36,420
Come on.

158
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:36,880
Come on.

159
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,950
You're smiling.

160
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:41,530
Changning,

161
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,310
as long as you're not angry, it's fine.

162
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:43,930
Don't worry.

163
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,930
I'll explain what I've done myself.

164
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,770
How will you explain?

165
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,750
Yueyao's mother was a spy.

166
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:51,870
This is a fact.

167
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,310
It doesn't allow for our explanation.

168
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,159
We...

169
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,810
We can submit that suicide note as evidence,

170
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:58,990
and then reveal her mother's

171
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,790
decision to turn over a new leaf.

172
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,320
My brilliantly clever Mr. Gu,

173
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,360
why are you being so muddle-headed at a time like this?

174
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,490
Even if we tell them,

175
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,390
how to judge

176
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,240
and what the sentence

177
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,310
will be depends on the will of my grandfather.

178
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,350
It's not something we can control.

179
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:18,800
Changning,

180
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:23,020
this is the first time you've called me clever.

181
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,080
I just called you muddle-headed a moment ago.

182
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,010
You remember all the compliments,

183
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:30,150
but forget all the criticisms, is that it?

184
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,409
Weren't you not angry just now?

185
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,330
Why are you angry again?

186
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,790
Never mind.

187
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:09,540
The woman I chose, I must cherish.

Don't hurt me.

Don't hurt me.

your medicine is working.

Man'er,

195
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,580
don't be afraid.

No one here will hurt you.

Look at me, who am I?

You are Sui Feng.

We should call for a doctor.

Someone,

206
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,360
call for a doctor.

207
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,220
That won't be necessary.

It seems she recognizes you quite clearly.

I'm afraid it's you, He Yunxing, who's delirious.
