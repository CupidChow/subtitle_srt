[The killer bride]

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,940
[Episode 18]

3
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:14,750
You don't have any evidence.

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,990
Master Mao,

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:17,650
please be careful with your words.

6
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,910
The witness personally identified her.

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,680
This is not a groundless rumor.

8
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,140
I will find out

9
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:25,760
the truth.

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,550
You've had a tiring journey.

11
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,630
Why don't you go back and rest early?

12
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,060
His Majesty ordered me to investigate this case.

13
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,350
I can't slack off.

14
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:36,520
I think

15
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,370
the one who should rest well

16
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,670
is you, Lord He.

17
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,070
What do you mean?

18
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,470
Through careful consideration,

19
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:48,000
I think in this case,

20
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,030
it's better for you to avert suspicion.

21
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:53,940
Pass my order.

22
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,310
From today onwards,

23
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,710
He Yunxing is not allowed to handle this case.

24
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:58,400
I disagree.

25
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:01,430
The spy case threatens the stability of the country.

26
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,190
We can't afford any mistake.

27
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,230
Lord He, you should look at the bigger picture

28
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,330
and understand His Majesty's good intentions.

29
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,110
You...

30
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:19,870
I'm doing this for the sake of Lord He's career.

31
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,110
Am I right?

32
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:25,780
Lord He,

33
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,870
please hand over your commander's token.

34
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:40,350
Master Mao,

35
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:44,200
please make sure to uncover the truth.

36
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,280
You are the Imperial Envoy.

37
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,150
Bending the law for personal gains

38
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,759
is an even greater crime.

39
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,200
Of course. You can rest assured.

40
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,080
[Commander]

41
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,240
What is on your mind?

42
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:27,780
Yunxing.

43
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,470
I wonder how I taught my disciple.

44
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,400
You have such poor vigilance.

45
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,730
Because I knew you would come to me.

46
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,370
They didn't give you a hard time, did they?

47
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,460
With you, Commander He,

48
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,630
how would they dare?

49
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,290
I'll get you out of here as soon as possible.

50
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,020
I know.

51
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:09,250
You...

52
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:10,860
How...

53
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,660
How did you guys get here?

54
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,470
Through the tunnel.

55
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:15,470
We came here

56
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,630
to discuss with you

57
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:18,170
how to catch Sui Feng.

58
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,630
Catch Sui Feng.

59
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:27,940
That's what happened.

60
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,590
I'll never let Changning go for a political marriage.

61
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:33,230
So we have to catch Sui Feng.

62
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,350
But now, Man'er insists that I am Sui Feng.

63
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,800
And she's unconscious.

64
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,390
How should we investigate this?

65
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,320
We must find a way

66
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,620
to wake Man'er up.

67
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,180
Mr. Gu,

68
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:44,680
do me a favor.

69
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,380
Stall Master Mao.

70
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,110
Okay, leave it to me.

71
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,850
Master Mao,

72
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,790
you're still up

73
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:53,780
at this hour?

74
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:55,340
Mr. Gu, why are you here?

75
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,910
Where are the guards?

76
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,780
Answer my questions truthfully,

77
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,000
or I'll kill you.

78
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,380
Did Sui Feng make you frame Yueyao?

79
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:06,230
Yes.

80
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,830
What's that sound inside?

81
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,760
Where is Sui Feng?

82
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,710
I don't know what place that is.

83
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,200
I was blindfolded at that time.

84
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,839
Master Mao! Master Mao.

85
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,910
I'm going in to take a look.

86
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,200
There's really nothing inside, Master Mao.

87
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:24,880
Move aside!

88
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,270
Master Mao!

89
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:26,750
There's nothing here!

90
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,470
Stop!

91
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,720
He Yunxing,

92
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,280
you actually want to kill her.

93
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,070
Master Mao, you misunderstood.

94
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,110
Lord He was just using the needle

95
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,750
to wake Man'er up.

96
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,010
Mr. Gu,

97
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,030
are you joking with me?

98
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,750
Everyone knows He Yunxing would only use the Soul-Capturing Needle

99
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,820
to harm people.

100
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,420
Master Mao, looks like

101
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,510
you firmly believe I'm guilty, right?

102
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,440
I saw it with my own eyes.

103
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,930
There's no doubt about it.

104
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,870
Guards,

105
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,630
lock him up.

106
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,020
After daybreak,

107
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,930
I'll deal with him properly.

108
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:04,590
-Yes!
-Yes!

109
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:05,250
This...

110
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:06,710
Well...

111
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,080
-Please.
-Please.

112
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,190
Well...

113
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,110
Master Mao, let's talk.

114
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:13,790
Master Mao.

115
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:26,630
Yueyao.

116
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,270
It's already dawn.

117
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,070
Why haven't they returned yet?

118
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,110
Don't worry.

119
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,630
They should be back soon.

120
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,020
Stop.

121
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,790
Master Mao,

122
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,430
where are you taking Lord He?

123
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,400
Man'er is fine.

124
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,090
Let's negotiate again, okay?

125
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,310
Master Mao,

126
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,720
are you taking me to the courtyard where Yueyao is imprisoned?

127
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,040
You have deep feelings for Si Yueyao.

128
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:11,190
Now you're being punished because of her.

129
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,440
If I don't let her see this,

130
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,370
wouldn't that be a shame?

131
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,560
How despicable and shameless!

132
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,080
Don't be impulsive.

133
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:24,350
Can't you see he's trying to provoke you?

134
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,950
If you make a scene now,

135
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,860
no one will be able to save Yueyao.

136
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:31,990
Master Mao, where are you going?

137
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,190
I'll show you the way.

138
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,550
Follow me.

139
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,420
Let's go.

140
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,900
Kneel!

141
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,110
Thirty strokes on the back.

142
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:57,909
Yes, sir!

143
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:58,750
Master Mao,

144
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,530
so many strokes would cripple him!

145
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:03,050
He Yunxing is very tough.

146
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,220
Do it!

147
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,310
I'd like to see who dares to touch Lord He!

148
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,110
Jiu Feng,

149
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,300
back off!

150
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:08,950
Sir!

151
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:09,800
Back off!

152
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:15,990
Do it now.

153
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,210
Yes, sir!

154
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,420
Brother Yunxing!

155
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,030
Yueyao.

156
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,030
Open the door now!

157
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,200
Open the door!

158
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,430
Stop beating him!

159
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,360
Calm down first.

160
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:32,700
Stop!

161
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:35,750
Calm down first.

162
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,130
Open the door!

163
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,000
Stop beating him!

164
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,270
Open the door!

165
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:42,750
Stop beating him!

166
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,400
Yueyao.

167
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,080
Let's think of another way.

168
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,890
Open the door now!

169
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,810
Stop beating him!

170
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:55,710
Open the door now!

171
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,390
Open the door now!

172
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,110
Master Mao.

173
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,350
Stop beating him.

174
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:06,930
Master Mao,

175
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,320
do you plan to let He Yunxing go?

176
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:11,880
Look.

177
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:13,930
My subordinate

178
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,750
has gotten used to slacking off.

179
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,870
He doesn't even have much strength.

180
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,830
I want someone else to beat him.

181
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,710
There's no one else here.

182
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,430
Well, who else can do that?

183
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,070
Let him do that then.

184
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:38,330
This... This is not appropriate, right?

185
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:42,750
Jiu Feng,

186
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:45,080
take the rod.

187
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:48,580
Go.

188
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:51,790
Sir.

189
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:52,950
Take the rod!

190
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:09,800
He Yunxing,

191
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:16,600
I never thought you would kneel before me.

192
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,300
If you beg for mercy,

193
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:23,430
I might show some leniency.

194
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,470
Yunxing.

195
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,550
Beat him!

196
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,310
Sir.

197
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,190
Beat him!

198
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,710
Sir, I...

199
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,480
Didn't you eat?

200
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,550
Beat him hard!

201
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,710
Otherwise,

202
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:50,910
he won't be able to get off with just 30 strokes on the back.

203
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,590
Use more strength.

204
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:54,590
Sir, I...

205
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,030
Do it!

206
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:57,210
No.

207
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,830
-Stop!
-Yueyao.

208
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,330
Yueyao!

209
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,210
Yueyao!

210
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,900
Yueyao, calm down first!

211
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,600
They must have been caught in the act by Master Mao.

212
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,230
Calm down.

213
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:18,330
Or He Yunxing will have taken this beating for nothing.

214
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,540
Stop.

215
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:24,750
Yueyao.

216
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:27,070
Stop.

217
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,270
Don't hurt yourself.
