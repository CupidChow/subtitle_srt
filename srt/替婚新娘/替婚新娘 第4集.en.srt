[The killer bride]

2
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:12,940
[Episode 4]

3
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:13,990
You...

4
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:14,870
What are you...

5
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:15,830
Doing?

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,970
What do you think I'm doing?

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,030
In broad daylight, how could you...

8
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:22,470
You...

9
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:38,920
Honey.

10
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:40,860
In broad daylight,

11
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,110
what were you thinking just now?

12
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:45,780
I...

13
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:47,340
I was thinking...

14
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,320
I was thinking about...

15
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,320
What the person who traded with Du Juan wearing the disguise mask

16
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,390
looks like.

17
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,600
We'll know what that person looks like

18
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,710
soon enough.

19
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:05,040
Sir.

20
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:06,550
As per your instructions,

21
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:09,020
I've recreated the facial contours from the mask using beeswax

22
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,420
and had a painter draw it.

23
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,450
The facial contours

24
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,150
look a bit familiar.

25
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,550
Indeed, this face does look very familiar.

26
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,520
Where have we seen it before?

27
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,240
This cloud gauze blouse is made of plain gauze.

28
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:35,030
Plain gauze is the most precious fabric nowadays.

29
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,759
It's not something an ordinary woman can afford.

30
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,750
I know where I've seen it before.

31
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:42,590
It's this.

32
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,310
Qiao Niang?

33
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,600
The contours of the human skin mask

34
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,520
really are of Qiao Niang's.

35
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:53,520
Honey.

36
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,210
Your memory is quite good now.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,800
Since I remembered my mother...

38
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,690
Wait.

39
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,310
How do you know my memory has improved?

40
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,950
I didn't say it improved.

41
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,230
I said it's

42
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,110
quite good now.

43
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:18,910
Wait for me.

44
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,430
I'm a female relative,

45
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,550
so it'll be easier for me to strike up a conversation.

46
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,079
I'll go and test the waters.

47
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,720
Good day, ladies.

48
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,090
I heard that Qiao Niang is unwell.

49
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,790
I, Yueyao, your niece-in-law,

50
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,850
have come specially to attend to you.

51
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,660
Stay away from me!

52
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:54,990
I...

53
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,040
I...

54
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,350
I'll kill you!

55
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,040
-Don't you think about hurting me again.
-Your Ladyship.

56
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,520
Man'er.

57
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,950
Quickly take her back to her room.

58
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:05,390
Yes.

59
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,030
Don't you think about hurting me again!

60
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,110
Don't you think about hurting me again!

61
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,510
Don't be afraid, My Lady.

62
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,330
I'll kill you.

63
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:10,810
I'll kill you.

64
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:14,580
You're hurt.

65
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,580
You're bleeding.

66
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,100
Let me help you bandage it.

67
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,040
Since your uncle passed away,

68
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,410
her episodes have become more frequent.

69
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,270
Does this belong to Qiao Niang?

70
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,430
It is hers.

71
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,890
Your uncle had it custom-made for her.

72
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,680
She said it was lost a couple of days ago, and she couldn't find it.

73
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,940
Why do you have it?

74
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,710
Qiao Niang has never hurt anyone during her episodes before.

75
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,310
What's wrong with her today?

76
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,650
[General's Mansion]

77
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,700
Why did Qiao Niang want to kill me as soon as she saw me?

78
00:03:59,200 --> 00:03:59,630
I'm...

79
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,270
I'm sorry.

80
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,790
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

81
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:02,990
Does it hurt?

82
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,520
You've just noticed me?

83
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:07,880
It doesn't hurt.

84
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:11,780
You know what?

85
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,570
If I hadn't been there today,

86
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,750
you would have been the one who got injured.

87
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,740
Don't get involved in this case anymore.

88
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,810
I know.

89
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:22,390
You're trying to protect me by keeping me away from the investigation.

90
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,710
But I don't want to be a useless person.

91
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,960
Alright, I agree then.

92
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,680
But you can't act alone.

93
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,150
I promise you.

94
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,600
I've figured it out.

95
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:06,840
Look.

96
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,610
It's half a bloody handprint.

97
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,390
Qiao Niang.

98
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,400
I have some questions for you.

99
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,580
If there's any offense,

100
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,990
please forgive me.

101
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,330
On the day of the incident,

102
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,830
did you see my uncle?

103
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,380
I...

104
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,200
I was unwell that day.

105
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,760
I didn't see him.

106
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,380
Is that so?

107
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,470
But according to the servants and guards on duty,

108
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,870
you had been to the study.

109
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:44,850
I...

110
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,060
I remembered it wrong.

111
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,120
General was drunk that day.

112
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,350
I did go there to deliver some hangover-cure soup.

113
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,470
I left immediately after.

114
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,990
Were you wearing this when you delivered the soup?

115
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,390
No.

116
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,510
It wasn't me.

117
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,850
Yunxing, what do you mean?

118
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,310
Are you suspecting that Qiao Niang killed your uncle?

119
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,140
So why is there half a bloody handprint of uncle's

120
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,950
on your coat?

121
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,510
You must have a death wish!

122
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,680
I don't know.

123
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,150
I lost my cloud gauze blouse long ago.

124
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:15,850
You lost it?

125
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:16,950
When did you lose it?

126
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:17,750
And where did you lose it?

127
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,710
Don't ask me.

128
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:19,520
I don't know.

129
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:20,110
I don't know.

130
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:20,870
Fine, Qiao Niang.

131
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:21,870
Let me remind you.

132
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,830
This bloodstained coat

133
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,030
was found at Du Juan's house.

134
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,950
Since I was taken into the General's Mansion as a concubine,

135
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,310
I have never gone out.

136
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,250
I didn't even know Du Juan before.

137
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,110
That's right.

138
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,850
Qiao Niang has always been in poor health.

139
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:34,980
She rarely goes out.

140
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,630
Could there be some misunderstanding?

141
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,670
Wasn't the one wearing a disguise mask

142
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,750
who had Du Juan come to the mansion to spread the fragrance

143
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,250
you?

144
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,320
I've already investigated.

145
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:47,070
Qiao Niang.

146
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,280
You used to be an embroiderer in a sewing workshop.

147
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,680
But you suddenly became Madam Qiao of the general's mansion.

148
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:53,550
Tell me.

149
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,950
How did you seduce my uncle,

150
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,100
and what was your purpose of entering the mansion?

151
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,680
I didn't seduce him!

152
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:02,670
It was him...

153
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,750
Don't ask anymore.

154
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,920
Family scandals shouldn't be spread to the outside.

155
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,350
Why are you doing this?

156
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:11,950
Qiao Niang.

157
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,110
If you have any grievances,

158
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,830
good or bad, you can tell me everything.

159
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,320
I will judge for myself.

160
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,380
When I was little,

161
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,230
my parents passed away suddenly.

162
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:33,350
After that, I supported myself by embroidering all alone.

163
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:34,790
Half a year ago,

164
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,280
I came to the General's Mansion to deliver embroidery.

165
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,270
But He Yong lusted after me.

166
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,280
He forced me to stay in the back quarters as his concubine.

167
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,380
All along,

168
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,750
I've been using all kinds of excuses

169
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,520
to refuse his advances.

170
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,330
Until that day...

171
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,070
Come here.

172
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:03,870
Let go!

173
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,000
Let go!

174
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,050
Let go of me!

175
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,450
You must have a death wish!

176
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,990
Later, I had a terrible headache.

177
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,230
I don't remember how I got out.

178
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:47,430
When I woke up again, I was already in bed.

179
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,070
My husband...

180
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:56,270
My husband was actually killed by you.

181
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,840
You murderer!

182
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,230
Sir.

183
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,560
This is the hairpin.

184
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,550
Madam.

185
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,180
I'm sorry.

186
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,820
Qiao Niang.

187
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,870
So why are you afraid of me?

188
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,420
Don't come any closer!

189
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:30,940
Stay away!

190
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,860
Don't kill me!

191
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:33,620
-Don't kill me!
-Qiao Niang.

192
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,080
Come on.

193
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,130
Qiao Niang, don't be afraid.

194
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:35,600
Go away!

195
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:37,870
Let's go back first.

196
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,390
Don't be afraid.

197
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,750
Why is Qiao Niang always so scared of me?

198
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,600
Qiao Niang was shocked earlier.

199
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,230
She was overwhelmed with emotion.

200
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,470
Don't take it to heart.

201
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,270
No.

202
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,220
I must get to the bottom of this.

203
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:02,280
Could Qiao Niang really be the murderer of my mother?

204
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:08,510
Uncle is now dead and couldn't testify.

205
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:11,400
How can we be sure that what Qiao Niang said

206
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,110
is true?

207
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:15,830
Case reenactment.
