1
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:45,671
Are you God?

2
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:50,342
That's one name I have.

3
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:53,470
Some call me the universe.

4
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,847
Others call me time.

5
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:57,849
You know what they say.

6
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:01,979
"God is everywhere and in everything."

7
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,230
I believe you,

8
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:04,690
so give me back

9
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:06,775
my powers.

10
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,402
I can't do that.

11
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,572
-What?
-Even though I gave you the powers,

12
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:12,948
I didn't take them away from you.

13
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:15,742
Did this happen
because I haven't made a new deal?

14
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:19,204
Can I get my powers back
if I make one right now?

15
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:21,164
Deals won't change anything.

16
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:23,208
Since the powers are in the wrong body,

17
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:26,503
it's only natural for them to fade
until they're completely gone.

18
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,589
Then I'll…

19
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,008
That's right.

20
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,469
You're dying as we speak.

21
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,973
Then how can I get my powers back?

22
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,850
There must be a way.

23
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:41,601
It's simple.

24
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,813
You can get your powers back

25
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:46,857
once the woman dies.

26
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,286
Once the current owner is gone,

27
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,371
the tattoo will return
to its original owner.

28
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:02,831
What if she doesn't die?

29
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:07,085
If she stays alive until the full moon,

30
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:08,754
the tattoo will disappear.

31
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:13,508
And you'll cease to exist
through spontaneous combustion.

32
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,597
You went to such great lengths
to keep her alive so far,

33
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,516
but she must die
for you to get your powers back.

34
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:24,811
What's the point of all this?

35
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,190
Why are you doing this to us?

36
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,983
I don't know everything
just because I'm God.

37
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,571
The world works
in surprisingly imperfect ways.

38
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,325
All you do is make your choice,

39
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,911
and the roulette wheel spins on its own.

40
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:47,918
That's how the world works.

41
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,253
What kind of an irresponsible--

42
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:53,590
If someone is to be held responsible,
it'd be you, not me.

43
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,468
I may have set the basic rules,

44
00:02:56,551 --> 00:03:00,597
but humans freely make choices
rather than following those rules,

45
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,557
creating countless anomalies.

46
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,852
You humans love to
blame fate for everything,

47
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:09,147
but fate is nothing more than
a web woven by a myriad of choices

48
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:10,857
of your making.

49
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:17,948
He's a demon.

50
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:21,827
Also known as the devil.

51
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,915
He brings misfortune upon humans

52
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:28,792
and leads them to hell.

53
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,421
That's just ridiculous.

54
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,631
I know it's hard to believe.

55
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:39,803
But you must have figured out
that he's no ordinary human.

56
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,055
That's why you asked me
about his identity.

57
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,224
Still, how could he be the devil?

58
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,435
Are you saying

59
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:49,980
Do-hee knows his identity
but still trusts him so completely?

60
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,481
That's not like her at all.

61
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,316
A demon's specialty

62
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,736
is stirring up human desires
and bewitching them,

63
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:58,029
thereby captivating their hearts.

64
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,408
That's how a demon operates.

65
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,583
Director Jeong is always
holding Do Do-hee by the wrist.

66
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:11,835
Have you noticed that?

67
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:14,212
Yes.

68
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:16,548
A demon has special powers.

69
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,341
They're dangerous and powerful.

70
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,219
And they've transferred
to Do Do-hee's wrist.

71
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:22,929
The tattoo.

72
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,890
That's right. The tattoo.

73
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,309
That's the source of his powers.

74
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,479
That's why he needs Do Do-hee.

75
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,314
To be more precise,

76
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,609
he needs the tattoo on her wrist.

77
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,626
Is there no other way?

78
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,587
A way that both of us can live?

79
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:57,589
Unfortunately,

80
00:04:58,798 --> 00:04:59,966
there isn't.

81
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:03,261
At the full moon,
the roulette wheel will come to a stop,

82
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:07,015
and the game will end one way or another.

83
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:24,449
EPISODE 10
BREAKING THROUGH THE SHELL

84
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:29,621
The tattoo.

85
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,581
That's the source of his powers.

86
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,792
That's why he needs Do Do-hee.

87
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,627
He needs the tattoo on her wrist.

88
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,589
What do you get
from your relationship with Do-hee?

89
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:43,927
I don't see how you'd benefit
from being her husband and bodyguard.

90
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,303
I need her.

91
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,813
DEMON: REFERS TO A GHOST,
GUARDIAN, OR THE DEVIL…

92
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,109
DEVIL

93
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,528
DEVIL'S TRUMPETS, THE 7 DEVILS

94
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:07,867
WOMAN OFFERED AS A SACRIFICE

95
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:10,287
HUMANS BEWITCHED BY THE DEVIL

96
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,502
What are you looking for?

97
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:21,256
Now that the culprit is dead,
it's all over, isn't it?

98
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:29,723
Come in.

99
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:37,355
This arrived from Do Do-hee
earlier this afternoon.

100
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,192
RENUNCIATION OF INHERITANCE

101
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:44,696
Luckily, she kept her promise.

102
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:45,822
Congratulations, honey.

103
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,532
What do you mean, congratulations?

104
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,868
Everything was mine by right,

105
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,703
and I only reclaimed it.

106
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,622
Absolutely.

107
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,458
You went through so much.

108
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,766
RENUNCIATION OF INHERITANCE
BENEFICIARY: DO DO-HEE

109
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:21,274
MIRAE ELECTRONICS' FIRST OFFICIAL
ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENT

110
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:27,906
YEAR 2006

111
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:54,307
So it's you.

112
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:55,850
Mother's way out.

113
00:07:57,018 --> 00:08:00,397
You'll be living here from now on.

114
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,442
Think of us as your family now.

115
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,070
That's what everyone says at first.

116
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:09,531
Until they run out of money.

117
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:12,117
I'm not exactly promising to adore you…

118
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,704
or shower you with affection.

119
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:17,831
And I never expected that from you.

120
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,165
Mother.

121
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,876
There you are.

122
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,421
You're Do-hee, right?

123
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:26,172
Welcome.

124
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,075
ENFORCER

125
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,291

127
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,756
DELETE

128
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,596
WHY HAVEN'T I HEARD FROM YOU?

129
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,681
DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE BAILING OUT

130
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:31,988
You can get your powers back

131
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,281
once the woman dies.

132
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,783
What if she doesn't die?

133
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,451
The tattoo will disappear.

134
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,164
And you'll cease to exist
through spontaneous combustion.

135
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,086
What's all this?

136
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:49,214
Ta-da.

137
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,299
I made a cake.

138
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,136
But Halloween has already passed.

139
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,471
When is your birthday?

140
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:58,223
I don't have one.

141
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,141
You seemed envious of Christmas,

142
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:02,769
so I wanted to practice
making a birthday cake for you.

143
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,231
What should I write on the cake?

144
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,816
"Merry Demon"?

145
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:09,734
That sounds weird.

146
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:11,569
I'll just write your name.

147
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,866
GU-WON

148
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,541
I'm charging up.

149
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,254
Is something wrong?

150
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,758
No, nothing's wrong.

151
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,012
Are you sure?

152
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,182
You took off so abruptly.

153
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,225
Where did you go?

154
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,105
I went to the theater.

155
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,732
You wouldn't believe
how much Mr. Park was whining.

156
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,317
Was it something serious?

157
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,654
It's all been sorted out.

158
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,951
Anyhow,

159
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,078
I think cakes should be made by experts.

160
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:05,206
We can always buy a cake,
so just hang out with me.

161
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,292
But we have an expert here.

162
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,835
Me.

163
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,753
Do Do-hee, the CEO of Mirae F&B.

164
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,797
If I'm not an expert, I don't know who is.

165
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,301
Why do you look at me with such distrust?

166
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,971
Enjoy the expertly prepared cake.

167
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,312
So? Can you feel the expertise?

168
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,816
No?

169
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,736
-It tastes amazing.
-Really?

170
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,488
I can totally tell
it was made by an expert.

171
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:39,908
See? I told you.

172
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,034
Let me have a taste.

173
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,535
No, don't!

174
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:47,415
It'd be a shame to eat this masterpiece.

175
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:50,293
Let's just appreciate it
by looking at it like this.

176
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,170
Look, appreciate it.

177
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,338
It's that good?

178
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,632
It's beyond your imagination.

179
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:56,883
Really?

180
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,968
Then it'd be a shame to eat it.

181
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:02,597
It's so salty!

182
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:04,599
Oh no.

183
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:05,725
But I…

184
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,977
I thought I was adding sugar,

185
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,271
but it must've been salt.

186
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,149
That's why it tastes so good.

187
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,526
-You're lying.
-I mean it.

188
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,445
You could even sell it.

189
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,489
Launch it as your company's new product.

190
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,741
Salted rolls are all the rage now.

191
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,118
-Salted rolls?
-Yes.

192
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:26,621
-Do you like them?
-I do.

193
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,124
Great. Then this won't go to waste.

194
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:34,921
Have some salted cake.

195
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,799
Here comes the salt.

196
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,720
I had dinner, so I'm full.

197
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,138
But it's really tasty.

198
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:46,015
-Have some. Try the cookie.
-No, thanks.

199
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,270
I love the smell of the night.

200
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,232
Are you okay with heights now?

201
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,483
I'm not sure.

202
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:57,902
But…

203
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,697
looking at your face
chases away all my fears.

204
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:02,824
Maybe because you're my guardian.

205
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:08,037
If the world were to end tomorrow,

206
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,163
what would you do?

207
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:11,499
Why would the world end?

208
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:16,379
By some random twist of fate, I suppose.

209
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,214
A twist of fate?

210
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,719
Then I guess there's nothing
I could do about it.

211
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,430
That's terrible.

212
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,265
I just have to watch the world end?

213
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:31,602
In that case,

214
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:34,397
I'd just…

215
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:39,902
stay home with you all day

216
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,196
and laze around.

217
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:46,909
I'd sleep in
and make silly jokes with you.

218
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:51,414
I'd spend the day in peace

219
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,124
as if it were to continue forever.

220
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,586
That'd be the best thing I could do

221
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,087
so as not to be played by fate.

222
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,051
And?

223
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:04,844
-And?
-Yes.

224
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,184
We could walk around together all day.

225
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,103
The world may end the next day,

226
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:15,938
but we'll etch it into our memories.

227
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:19,317
And?

228
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:20,651
And?

229
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:23,196
The day can't be that long.

230
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,950
Is there anything you want to do

231
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,453
by yourself?

232
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:32,872
No.

233
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,999
I want to spend my last day with you.

234
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,805
Let's stay up all night tonight.

235
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:50,306
Why?

236
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:52,850
I just feel like

237
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:56,187
it'd be a waste if we slept tonight.

238
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,526
No. I have work tomorrow.

239
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:06,197
Let tomorrow take care of itself.

240
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,532
Tonight,

241
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,119
you should have fun until morning breaks.

242
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:14,038
-What are you doing?
-It's the devil's temptation.

243
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:16,374
All right.

244
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,793
I'm really good at staying up all night.

245
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,586
I get that you're good at everything,

246
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,380
-but you're even good at that?
-I am.

247
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,798
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

248
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:53,286
I thought looking at my face
chases away all your fears?

249
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,833
I guess a guardian is no use
against horror movies.

250
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:03,713
Does that really scare you?

251
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,675
What scares you then?

252
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:12,889
Then again,

253
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,725
a demon wouldn't be
scared of those things.

254
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,674
How boring to the very end.

255
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,143
So much for being good at
staying up all night.

256
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,617
What scares me…

257
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,412
is you disappearing…

258
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,124
from this world.

259
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:28,047
What scares me the most…

260
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:32,843
is a world without you.

261
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:03,124
Jeong Gu-won.

262
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,626
Don't go.

263
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,505
Stay by my side.

264
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,888
I can't stay by your side anymore.

265
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:20,808
Why not?

266
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,227
I'm going away.

267
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,271
To a faraway place…

268
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:28,524
that you can't reach.

269
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,198
I'll come find you.

270
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:40,995
I'll…

271
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,582
never give you up.

272
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:32,838
A full moon.

273
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,262
Set.

274
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,264
Flush!

275
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,060
That's amazing.

276
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:55,695
Hi there.

277
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:00,199
This is no time for gambling.

278
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:02,868
No wonder the world is a mess.

279
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,664
I love choices.

280
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:11,502
It's a joy to watch how my choices

281
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,087
lead to unexpected outcomes.

282
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,884
I'll have my usual. Make it two.

283
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,761
-Understood, ma'am.
-I'll have a glass of red wine.

284
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,140
-Certainly, sir.
-Just as you enjoy gambling,

285
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,307
I enjoy wine.

286
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:28,894
Some call wine the tears of God.

287
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:33,274
I never cry.

288
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,151
Here's my advice.

289
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,069
Never say never.

290
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,614
You seemed pretty down earlier,

291
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:42,450
but the look in your eyes has changed.

292
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:45,119
I won't give up on either one of us.

293
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,079
I'm choosing

294
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:49,707
both me and Do Do-hee.

295
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,917
You must've come up with some great idea.

296
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:54,462
But it doesn't matter.

297
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:58,799
The rule is that if one wins,
the other must lose.

298
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,303
You told me

299
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,305
that even though you set the rules,

300
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,932
humans make the choices.

301
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,644
I choose

302
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,731
to struggle against it as much as I can.

303
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,774
You've really become human.

304
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:18,944
Choosing to struggle in vain.

305
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:24,074
You're right.

306
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,953
This is what it means to be human.

307
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,458
Let's make a bet.

308
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,503
If I get my powers back

309
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:37,213
and Do Do-hee lives,

310
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,297
you lose.

311
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,381
I told you.

312
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:41,675
That's never going to happen.

313
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,093
Remember?

314
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,138
Never say never.

315
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:47,264
I'm off.

316
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:55,272
That's the way it is with humans.

317
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,274
Pitiful things.

318
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:20,422
How did it go, Director Jeong?

319
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:23,008
Did the homeless lady know something?

320
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:28,347
What time did you say
Do Do-hee and I fell into the sea?

321
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,766
It was shortly after midnight,
so around 12:30 a.m.

322
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,268
Shortly after midnight?

323
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:36,146
Are you getting the tattoo back?

324
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,356
Is that what she told you to do?

325
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:39,817
That's a relief.

326
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,653
I was worried
there was nothing you could do.

327
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,280
Mr. Park.

328
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,322
Yes?

329
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:47,157
If I don't make it back,

330
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,495
take over my position.

331
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:55,291
What?

332
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,626
Put my belongings up for auction

333
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:01,755
and use the proceeds
to finish paying for your new car.

334
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:04,675
And tell Ga-young…

335
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:09,763
that I went somewhere far away.

336
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,059
Why are you saying all this?

337
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:17,605
It sounds as if you're going to die.

338
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:19,273
No one's going to die.

339
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,358
I'm saying it just in case.

340
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,126
There you are.

341
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:24,672
I thought you went away somewhere.

342
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:26,632
Where would I go?

343
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,760
I had this dream
where you told me you were going away.

344
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,261
How did you know?

345
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:33,681
We're going on a trip today.

346
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:36,100
-A trip?
-Let's go to Sokcho.

347
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,102
What for?

348
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:43,440
There will be a full moon tonight.

349
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:47,736
Just like the night
my tattoo transferred to you.

350
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:51,949
The tattoo…

351
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:54,827
will come back to me.

352
00:24:57,538 --> 00:24:58,455
Really?

353
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:00,207
Yes.

354
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,919
So there was a way?

355
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,173
That's great.

356
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:12,136
A honeymoon.

357
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,887
We never went on our honeymoon.

358
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:14,930
This can be it.

359
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:16,598
What do you say?

360
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,226
Sounds good.

361
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:30,571
BOOST YOUR VIRILITY
LORD OF HELL

362
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:42,708
I feel so alert and clear now.

363
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,710
What a peaceful day.

364
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:49,047
It's as if the world
were free of any problems.

365
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:50,507
What are you talking about?

366
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:54,344
Mr. Noh is likely to be elected chairman
at today's stockholders' meeting.

367
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:55,929
That is clearly a problem.

368
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:58,056
What does that have to do with us?

369
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,143
It has everything to do with us.

370
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:04,688
It means we've lost our chance

371
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:07,107
to be the next chairperson's
closest allies.

372
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:12,446
I was so close to becoming
an executive of Mirae Group.

373
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:14,072
"Director Han."

374
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:17,117
That's not going to happen
even if Ms. Do becomes the chairwoman.

375
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:18,494
Why not?

376
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,204
Who is more qualified than me?

377
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:21,955
It's best if you don't know.

378
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:23,457
They say ignorance is bliss.

379
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:25,959
Some amazing pep talk, isn't it?

380
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:27,252
It really is.

381
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,964
Just tell me.

382
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:33,425
What do I need to change
to become an executive?

383
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:36,845
Good morning, Ms. Do.

384
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,514
Good morning.

385
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,599
-Have a nice day, Ms. Do.
-Have a nice day.

386
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:42,643
You too.

387
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:49,191
I freed up your afternoon
as you instructed.

388
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:50,734
Thank you.

389
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:53,612
-…now departing!
-Ladies…

390
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:55,614
-Da-jeong.
-You better…

391
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:59,493
get your act together.

392
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:05,082
I'm sorry for making you work
so late all the time.

393
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,692
I've really got to quit drinking.

394
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:45,455
Let's take a little break.

395
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,125
-My goodness!
-What's going on?

396
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,378
What was that?

397
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:00,888
There was a rat.

398
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:09,354
-A rat?
-A rat?

399
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,403
-Open the door.
-Jeez.

400
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:18,739
-I'm opening it.
-Open it.

401
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,411
That hurts.

402
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:28,206
Doctor,

403
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,917
is it supposed to hurt this much?
404

404
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,342
She signed the document.

405
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,259
What?

406
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:42,220
She even signed the document?

407
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:44,973
What on earth is she plotting?

408
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:47,643
She thinks way too many steps ahead of me.

409
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,144
I can't keep up.

410
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:52,856
Doctor!

411
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:55,275
Doctor.

412
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:58,028
Please continue with the procedure
so I can get smarter.

413
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,821
I could use a rush of dopamine.

414
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,908
Hold on, that hurts!

415
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:06,203
RENUNCIATION OF INHERITANCE

416
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,268
You haven't sorted it out yet?

417
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,729
-Sorry?
-The girls.

418
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:36,733
I did.

419
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,870
Should I leave?

420
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:53,583
The food is ready.

421
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:56,378
You should eat well on the big day.

422
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,338
You too, Do-gyeong.

423
00:29:58,922 --> 00:29:59,756
Okay.

424
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,535
You've been waiting so desperately
for the full moon.

425
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,871
But that's what will happen?

426
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,250
What if

427
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,545
you go into the sea,
but the tattoo doesn't return?

428
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:41,089
What will happen then?

429
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:42,507
In that case,

430
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:46,219
Do-hee will go back
to her normal life without me,

431
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:49,514
and I'll go out in a fiery blaze,
like a campfire.

432
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,400
Director Jeong pretends to be strong
even in the face of death.

433
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:05,614
No, I shouldn't cry.

434
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,574
Not when he's staying strong.

435
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:14,498
My goodness!

436
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:21,004
Your footsteps are so light
that I didn't notice you coming in.

437
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:26,676
Don't you leave me in the dark again.

438
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,011
What do you mean?

439
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:29,930
What's wrong with Director Jeong?

440
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,807
What? There's nothing wrong.

441
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:38,563
Can he even come to watch me perform?

442
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,274
Is he even coming back?

443
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:43,777
Of course he can watch you perform.

444
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,696
He's definitely going to come back.

445
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:48,448
No matter…

446
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:01,336
Don't worry, Star Jin.

447
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,713
Both Director Jeong and his tattoo
will come back!

448
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:08,593
They have to.

449
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:11,847
ATTEMPTED KIDNAPPING AND MURDER

450
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,932
2 FROZEN CORPSES AT THE SCENE

451
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:18,145
Any ideas, sir?

452
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:22,774
We haven't found the weapon
Gi Kwang-chul used on Mr. Jeong,

453
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:23,900
have we?

454
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:26,945
No, we combed through the area
but failed to find it.

455
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:30,991
Mr. Jeong was stabbed in the heart.

456
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:34,077
So was Gi Kwang-chul
after his body burned.

457
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:35,078
That's right.

458
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:37,956
That can't just be a coincidence, can it?

459
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,249
That's because it isn't.

460
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:49,342
I was going to visit you,
so you came at the right time.

461
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:51,469
I thought I should clear things up.

462
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:54,514
The knife stuck into
Gi Kwang-chul's dead body

463
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:57,517
is the same one he used on me.

464
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:03,482
You may think that I have
enough reason to kill him,

465
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:04,649
but it wasn't me.

466
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:07,110
I was home with Do Do-hee that day,

467
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:08,528
so I have a solid alibi.

468
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:10,238
Check the CCTV footage if you want.

469
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:12,991
We haven't even made you our suspect,

470
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:15,452
so why are you telling us this?

471
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:19,039
I believe

472
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:22,125
that the knife is a warning
directed at me.

473
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:23,960
But if the warning

474
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:25,962
turns out…

475
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:28,965
to be directed at Do Do-hee,

476
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:33,303
she might face danger again.

477
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:35,639
So I have

478
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:37,933
a favor to ask you.

479
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:42,270
Please keep her safe.

480
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:53,156
Is the cable car too old-fashioned?

481
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:56,743
But that's part of its charm.

482
00:33:57,953 --> 00:33:59,371
Okay, this looks good.

483
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:02,415
After the cable car, we'll go for dinner.

484
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,878
SOKCHO RECOMMENDATIONS

485
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,341
Is Gu-won running late?

486
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:19,182
Hello?

487
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:20,475
This is Jin Ga-young.

488
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:23,186
We need to talk.

489
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:27,566
So you're going to
try to restore the tattoo.

490
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:29,693
Yes.

491
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:32,654
Do you want Director Jeong
to get his powers back?

492
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:36,283
Yes, of course.

493
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:38,451
What will you do…

494
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:42,330
if it doesn't work tonight?

495
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:44,833
If it doesn't work?

496
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,128
What do you mean?

497
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:51,089
What if you jump into the water,
but the tattoo doesn't go back?

498
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,591
What will you do then?

499
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:02,559
Did the director tell you
that it's definitely going to work?

500
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:06,896
Director Jeong

501
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:10,400
is planning to die in your stead
if it doesn't work.

502
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:16,823
Ms. Jin, I don't understand what you're--

503
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:19,617
He'll die if the tattoo
doesn't return to him tonight.

504
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,747
But if you die,

505
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:26,958
the tattoo will return to him.

506
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,223
This is poison.

507
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:45,518
Even a few pills can be deadly.

508
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:49,856
I beg you.

509
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:52,525
Please save Director Jeong.

510
00:35:57,781 --> 00:35:58,823
Jin Ga-young.

511
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:02,535
What are you doing here?

512
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:04,537
Gu-won.

513
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:05,705
Is it true?

514
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:08,708
Will you die if we fail tonight?

515
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:14,089
I only told her the truth.

516
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,885
Don't listen to that nonsense. Let's go.

517
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:21,846
Answer me.

518
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,014
Is it true?

519
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:29,145
The only thing you can do for him is die.

520
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:30,063
Jin Ga-young!

521
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,607
I told you not to cross the line.

522
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:41,908
I'm so confused right now.

523
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:44,035
I need some time to think.

524
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,456
I'm just trying to save you.

525
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,749
Don't delude yourself.

526
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:52,001
You mean nothing to me.

527
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:19,487
If the world were to end tomorrow,

528
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,073
what would you do?

529
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:24,367
Why would the world end?

530
00:37:25,452 --> 00:37:29,539
By some random twist of fate, I suppose.

531
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,339
Is it true?

532
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:41,885
Will Jeong Gu-won die
if he doesn't get the tattoo back tonight?

533
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:45,096
You knew about it, didn't you?

534
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:47,682
I did.

535
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:53,021
Director Jeong himself
only found out last night.

536
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,359
So that's why he was…

537
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:12,415
Director Jeong

538
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:14,918
is planning to die in your stead
if it doesn't work.

539
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:17,670
But if you die,

540
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:19,798
the tattoo will return to him.

541
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:36,189
Do you know how many times
I almost died today?

542
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:37,816
I wanted to check something.

543
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:39,984
Then you should've told me beforehand.

544
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:41,069
If I had told you,

545
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:43,238
you would've refused.

546
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:50,995
I can't stay by your side anymore.

547
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:52,747
I'm going away.

548
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:54,958
To a faraway place

549
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,210
that you can't reach.

550
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:33,955
Do-hee.

551
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:39,586
Let's go.

552
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,799
Let's find a way
for you to get the tattoo back.

553
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:49,012
We can't die just like this,
not after what we've been through.

554
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:53,892
Even if we have to jump into the sea
a hundred or even a thousand times,

555
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:57,103
I'll make sure the tattoo returns to you.

556
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:58,855
I'll do whatever it takes…

557
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,162
I'll also do whatever it takes.

558
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:16,789
Anything at all.

559
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:40,063
SUNWOL FOUNDATION

560
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:43,775
I'm here to ask you about
the tattoo you mentioned last time.

561
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:46,903
Will it put Do-hee in danger?

562
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:49,572
I have no idea.

563
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:53,076
But one thing's for sure.

564
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,996
No human got to have a happy ending
after encountering Director Jeong.

565
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,959
They either remain in a living hell

566
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,253
or sell their soul and go to hell.

567
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:08,216
Either way, they end up in hell.

568
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,177
I can't just sit back.

569
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,221
I have to stop him.

570
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:20,019
Then today is your last chance.

571
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,064
Come to think of it,
you'll get a birthday now.

572
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:10,445
You'll be reborn as a perfect demon.

573
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,740
That must be why
I wanted to make you a birthday cake.

574
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,701
Let's make a proper one this time.

575
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:21,956
It feels rather nice

576
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:25,209
to think I'll get a birthday.

577
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:43,519
Remember our deal?

578
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:47,190
We share the same fate, remember?

579
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:49,901
Always keep in mind
that we're in the same boat.

580
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:51,360
It's too high!

581
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:55,615
I'm my bodyguard's bodyguard!

582
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:03,748
Why did you propose to me?

583
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,082
I don't want you to die.

584
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:07,126
Stop! Hold on a second.

585
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:09,253
"The rest of our lives"?
That wasn't part of the deal.

586
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:18,638
I just want to accept you the way you are.

587
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:22,475
Apparently, demons used to be
the guardians of mankind.

588
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:26,020
Then you're back to being
your original self.

589
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:28,356
You're my guardian.

590
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,329
Everyone I've ever loved is dead.

591
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:45,081
And you'll die

592
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,083
because of me too.

593
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:48,000
I don't care.

594
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,256
If the world were to end tomorrow,

595
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:56,092
is there anything you want to do
by yourself?

596
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:57,802
No.

597
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:00,221
I want to spend my last day with you.

598
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:47,560
Shall we?

599
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:51,397
Let's go.

600
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:17,673
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR JEONG GU-WON

601
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:29,060
Director Jeong.

602
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:52,041
Let's begin

603
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:55,461
the 36th special stockholders' meeting
of Mirae Group.

604
00:45:58,089 --> 00:45:59,090
Suk-min.

605
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:02,802
What if this is a poisoned chalice
or something?

606
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:05,721
We might be hitting rock bottom
if we drink from it.

607
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:08,182
The board has recommended

608
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:11,143
Acting Chairman Noh Suk-min
for the chairperson position.

609
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:14,105
You shouldn't dream of climbing higher

610
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,315
without daring to hit rock bottom.

611
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,157
Where's Do-gyeong?

612
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:28,119
He isn't feeling well.

613
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:30,246
Again?

614
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:32,832
He's too sickly for his age.

615
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:34,250
Let's take a vote

616
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:37,962
on whether to elect Mr. Noh as chairman.

617
00:46:44,677 --> 00:46:47,304
I hope we do better
than we did at the Han River last time.

618
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,809
Thanks for telling me beforehand
this time.

619
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:57,273
That was a rehearsal for today.

620
00:46:59,692 --> 00:47:00,776
We're almost there.

621
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:04,655
Everything will soon

622
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:06,991
go back to normal.

623
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,919
LOW FUEL

624
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:37,813
Let me go pay for this.

625
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:39,190
What's that?

626
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,149
A postcard.

627
00:47:40,733 --> 00:47:42,276
To commemorate today.

628
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:48,199
Wait, should we also get a cake
so we can celebrate later?

629
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:49,992
Let's see what they have.

630
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:52,745
-Get a strawberry cake.
-Okay.

631
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:12,056
You haven't sorted it out yet?

632
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:13,140
The girls.

633
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:15,684
I did.

634
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,734
ENFORCER

635
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:27,238
Noh Suk-min!

636
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:48,092
ENFORCER

637
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:53,722
My phone's right here.

638
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,767
So how come you have the exact same one?

639
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:04,692
I carve lessons into your body
so you remember them better,

640
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:07,862
but you always seem to forget
after a while.

641
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:24,879
Like I said,

642
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,424
I'm going to fix you up.

643
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:35,723
Prove your worth to me.

644
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:55,075
CREDIT CARD
PROCEED WITH PAYMENT

645
00:50:01,874 --> 00:50:03,167
I beg you.

646
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,543
Please save Director Jeong.

647
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:44,917
-Hi, Seok-hoon.
-Where are you? Are you alone?

648
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:47,419
That came out of the blue.

649
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:48,545
Answer me.

650
00:50:48,629 --> 00:50:49,922
Are you with Jeong Gu-won?

651
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:53,926
Yes.

652
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:55,594
He's not right next to me though.

653
00:50:55,678 --> 00:50:56,929
You're in danger.

654
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:59,098
Keep away from him.

655
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:01,141
I know

656
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:02,893
what he is.

657
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,151
I'm on my way to you.

658
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:14,029
-So keep away from him--
-I understand what you're saying,

659
00:51:14,113 --> 00:51:15,781
but it's not like that.

660
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:17,366
He would never do such a thing.

661
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:19,243
You're being fooled, Do-hee.

662
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:22,037
Do you know
why he dragged you all the way there?

663
00:51:22,121 --> 00:51:24,748
It's to save himself by killing you!

664
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,799
I'm sorry. I'm hanging up.

665
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:35,551
The votes are in.

666
00:51:36,135 --> 00:51:39,263
With more than 78.5% of the vote,

667
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:43,225
Mr. Noh Suk-min has been elected
the chairman of Mirae Group.

668
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:52,401
Do-hee!

669
00:52:15,174 --> 00:52:16,008
Do-hee.

670
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:29,938
Do-hee!

671
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,161
No, Director Jeong.

672
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:46,330
You're a mere human now.

673
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:47,998
You'll die if you go in there!

674
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:50,042
Let go.

675
00:52:51,085 --> 00:52:52,336
Just look the other way.

676
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:55,547
Do Do-hee has to die for you to live!

677
00:52:57,925 --> 00:52:59,093
I can't live without her.

678
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:30,332
Ms. Jin,

679
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:32,042
what was that about?

680
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:35,254
Do-hee has to die for him to live?

681
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:37,464
It's all over now.

682
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,510
They'll both die.

683
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,012
No.

684
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:45,389
Do-hee…

685
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:50,936
No.

686
00:54:03,449 --> 00:54:05,200
Humans always end up

687
00:54:05,284 --> 00:54:08,829
choosing one over the other.

688
00:54:09,538 --> 00:54:11,748
Whether they want to or not,

689
00:54:11,832 --> 00:54:14,626
that is their destiny.

690
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:12,935
If we ever end up
having to make a cruel choice,

691
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,687
I'll choose you.

692
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,440
Because I know

693
00:55:18,524 --> 00:55:21,652
that losing someone I love
is worse than losing myself.

694
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:26,532
Please don't resent my choice.

695
00:55:27,616 --> 00:55:30,744
Please forgive me for condemning you

696
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,288
to the same hell I went through.

697
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:49,513
Do-hee!

698
00:56:04,945 --> 00:56:07,948
Remembering the value of trust
that I learned from my mother,

699
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:11,743
I will restore Mirae Group
to its former glory.

700
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:19,126
CHAIRMAN NOH SUK-MIN

701
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,545
Mother.

702
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:24,881
Are you happy now?

703
00:56:24,965 --> 00:56:26,341
MIRAE GROUP

704
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:30,095
I've become the devil just as you wanted.

705
00:56:53,035 --> 00:56:54,328
Please hurry.

706
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:55,871
There are people inside!

707
00:56:58,248 --> 00:56:59,082
Hurry.

708
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:34,720
How…

709
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:50,277
Do-hee.

710
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:05,876
Do-hee.

711
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:38,617
The tattoo…

712
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:43,413
has come back to me.

713
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:50,564
Congratulations. You don't flicker
or need to charge up anymore.

714
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:51,648
I still need to charge up.

715
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:53,775
Go away!

716
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:55,485
Wolsim!

717
01:00:55,569 --> 01:00:57,153
Why am I still dreaming
of when I was human

718
01:00:57,237 --> 01:00:59,197
when my powers have returned?

719
01:00:59,281 --> 01:01:02,576
Perhaps you want to remain a human.

720
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:05,620
So they survived that fiery pit?

721
01:01:05,704 --> 01:01:07,247
The culprit knew we were in Sokcho.

722
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:08,790
Someone leaked our information.

723
01:01:08,874 --> 01:01:10,792
The people who knew we were in Sokcho are…

724
01:01:10,876 --> 01:01:12,127
I'm here to join your side.

725
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:15,338
Let's resolve our past conflicts
and work together from now on.

726
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:23,930
