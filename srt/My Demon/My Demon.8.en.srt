1
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:46,213
SUNWOL FOUNDATION

2
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:54,680
It hurts, doesn't it?

3
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,102
Do Do-hee.

4
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,920
Your heart is about to split in half.

5
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,465
Like a ripe apple.

6
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:14,092
See you in hell.

7
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:16,470
Director Jeong!

8
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:32,319
Director Jeong.

9
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,362
That bastard!

10
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,489
Director Jeong.

11
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:36,948
-Director Jeong.
-Someone's on the ground.

12
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:40,702
Someone call an ambulance!

13
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:42,788
Someone get Do Do-hee here, please!

14
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:43,955
Get Do Do-hee!

15
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,917
Do Do-hee!

16
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,763
I know that you're not the culprit
better than anyone, Ms. Do.

17
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,516
But the higher-ups were pressuring me.

18
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,477
When will I be released?

19
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,979
You can leave
once the warrant is reviewed.

20
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,732
It'll be dismissed
since there's no evidence.

21
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,442
Detective Park.

22
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,320
-What is it?
-It's…

23
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:22,369
BP and pulse are dropping.

24
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,745
More fluid, please.

25
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,873
He's going to be okay, right?

26
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,334
Please save him.

27
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,129
Please let me go see him.

28
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,047
He got stabbed!

29
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:37,175
He's dying as we speak.

30
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:38,093
Please?

31
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,095
Seok-hoon.

32
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,263
I have to get out of here.

33
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,056
I have to go see Jeong Gu-won.

34
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,519
I have to go see him.

35
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,946
More gauze, please.

36
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,782
Increase the IV flow.
Are we ready for surgery?

37
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:02,451
Yes, everyone's on standby.

38
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,244
Send the patient to the OR…

39
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,417
Please save him.

40
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,010
Hang in there, Jeong Gu-won.

41
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,346
Just a little longer.

42
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,854
How is he, Doctor?

43
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:34,024
We've sutured the wound,
but he's already lost too much blood.

44
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,067
And his heart valves
are seriously damaged.

45
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,905
He might not make it through the night.

46
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:41,740
Do something.

47
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,910
Do whatever it takes to save him!

48
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,746
Please save him.

49
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:50,457
I beg you.

50
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:13,939
-Hurry.
-This is your fault.

51
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:16,233
All of this happened because of you.

52
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,902
You killed Director Jeong!

53
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,487
-Let go!
-Stop it.

54
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,905
Pull yourself together.

55
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,824
We have to save Director Jeong first.

56
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,784
Come with me.

57
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,081
Please wait outside.

58
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:14,833
It's too late.

59
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:23,216
I was too late.

60
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,558
You were always there to protect me.

61
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,103
But I…

62
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,356
couldn't…

63
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:16,895
You're heavy. Will you move?

64
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:23,902
Jeong Gu-won.

65
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:28,615
Your crying face from up close

66
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,284
is hilarious.

67
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,334
It's so funny that I can't even die.

68
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:45,340
I thought you were dead!

69
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:50,637
Are you not fully healed?

70
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,305
It worked only halfway again.

71
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,308
Useless powers.

72
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:57,602
I'll get the doctor.

73
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:05,485
Just give me a second.

74
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,697
I need to charge up.

75
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:22,419
Director Jeong…

76
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,587
She saved him.

77
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,760
She doesn't know how
that will come to threaten her own life.

78
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:16,139
Poor thing.

79
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:25,607
EPISODE 8
THE FATEFUL CHOICE

80
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,178
Do-hee.

81
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,188
I'll be back soon.

82
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:08,775
I won't leave you alone for too long.

83
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,173
Star Jin.

84
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,510
I looked everywhere for you.

85
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:38,888
Until now,

86
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,433
I was content…

87
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,479
with being Director Jeong's
human companion.

88
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:52,068
Because I was more special
than other humans.

89
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,073
No other woman came before me.

90
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:10,587
But then she showed up.

91
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,217
Do Do-hee…

92
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,722
cut in front of me.

93
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:38,364
Why aren't you asking anything?

94
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,869
Because you wouldn't tell me anyway.

95
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:50,835
Thank you.

96
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,256
You don't have to say those things to me.

97
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,718
Things like "Thank you" or "I'm sorry."

98
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:01,429
I'm okay

99
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,598
as long as you're safe.

100
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,475
That's all I need.

101
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,652
Let's hurry. We don't want to get
Detective Park in trouble.

102
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,002
Do Do-hee.

103
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,142
Is he still not up?

104
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,355
The doctor said
that he should get better now.

105
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,983
Why can't he recover?

106
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:57,527
What on earth is happening to him?

107
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,405
Well…

108
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:10,331
How's Mr. Jeong?

109
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:15,044
He's still in critical condition.

110
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,097
Director Jeong.

111
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:10,850
Director Jeong!

112
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:18,399
Are you okay?

113
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,109
Does it hurt that much?

114
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,029
It's just…

115
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,281
I had a nightmare.

116
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:29,160
Director Jeong.

117
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,037
It hurts.

118
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,330
I'm sorry.

119
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:35,833
Where's Do Do-hee?

120
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,587
The result should be out by now.

121
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,133
Detective Park.

122
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,302
What is it now?

123
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,054
The warrant has been reviewed and…

124
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:53,518
it's been dismissed.

125
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,436
Why would you pause?

126
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,479
You scared me.

127
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:06,697
How's Jeong Gu-won?

128
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:07,990
He's awake.

129
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,160
That's a relief.

130
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,500
HANKOOK UNIVERSITY GENERAL HOSPITAL

131
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,798
Get me some water, Mr. Park.

132
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,716
You want water?

133
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:28,886
Not this.

134
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:29,804
I want cold water.

135
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,597
You want cold water.

136
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:33,850
It's ice-cold.

137
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,519
Come on. Where's my straw?

138
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:45,778
You can sit down.

139
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,030
What's that?

140
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,366
I know how much you love your sweets.

141
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,452
I tried some, and they melt in your mouth.

142
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:00,877
Sit down.

143
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,878
Okay.

144
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,799
Scratch my back. It itches like crazy.

145
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,551
-A little higher.
-Here?

146
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,553
-A little lower.
-Around here?

147
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,264
Are you scratching
the wrong places on purpose?

148
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,224
Why did you stop?

149
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,769
You certainly were a nobleman
in your past life.

150
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:21,355
You're a natural when it comes to
bossing people around.

151
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,316
-Around here?
-No.

152
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,692
Yes, there you go.

153
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:25,818
You can sit down.

154
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:30,656
I may look okay on the outside,
but I'm a wreck on the inside.

155
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,409
How far along are you in your recovery?

156
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,788
I'd say I cheated death by a whisker.

157
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,373
It's a miracle that you survived.

158
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:42,710
I thought I'd never get to see you again.

159
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,629
What are you talking about? I'm a demon.

160
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,172
As an apex predator, I…

161
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,510
Hit that pain relief button.

162
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:51,427
Pain relief…

163
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,514
It hurts like crazy.

164
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:58,893
-What are you doing?
-I pushed it.

165
00:16:58,976 --> 00:16:59,977
Keep going.

166
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:01,187
-But…
-More.

167
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,855
Keep going.

168
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:03,940
Do Do-hee?

169
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:05,858
Delivery.

170
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:07,652
-Delivery?
-What is it?

171
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:08,736
This way.

172
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,947
Put them over here.

173
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:13,866
GET WELL SOON, BOSS
WILD DOGS

174
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,201
Goodbye.

175
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,120
Do they think this is a funeral home?

176
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,873
What kind of fool sends funeral sprays
to someone recovering?

177
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,042
"Wild Dogs"?

178
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,169
Who are they?

179
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:31,300
We must protect our boss.

180
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:32,468
-Let's protect him!
-Let's protect him!

181
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:33,511
Sir.

182
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:38,266
Boss.

183
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:39,475
-Boss!
-Boss!

184
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,936
Who's the scumbag that did this to you?

185
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:44,063
Boss, I'll find the bastard and--

186
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,691
I'm not your boss, and I'm not dead yet.

187
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,359
So get rid of the flowers.

188
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:51,696
Are you in pain, boss?

189
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,948
-Nurse! Doctor!
-Help!

190
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,033
-Get me the hospital director!
-Get lost!

191
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:57,451
-Come on!
-Hurry!

192
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:00,663
If you so much as approach me
within a 5 m radius,

193
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,039
I'll make you regret it.

194
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,132
-Back up.
-Keep going.

195
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,009
-Back up a bit more.
-Jeez, that's long.

196
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:17,930
That's 5 m, sir.

197
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:23,144
Our boss has made
his historic first order.

198
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,896
Do not cross over this line.

199
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,481
Everyone move over here!

200
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,617
BARK, BARK, BARK, BARK, BARK
WE BARK TO SHOW OUR LOVE FOR THE BOSS

201
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,747
What's wrong with them?

202
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,667
I'd rather get another hit on the head.

203
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:47,877
Definitely.

204
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,712
Disgusting.

205
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:58,137
Sir.

206
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,223
Guys, the boss's wife is here.

207
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,434
-You look beautiful, ma'am!
-You look beautiful, ma'am!

208
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,103
Your boss's wife?

209
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:09,899
Don't look them in the eye.

210
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:23,871
Sir.

211
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,833
The bed is way too high.

212
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,752
Getting on it feels like rock climbing.

213
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,801
-Jeong Gu-won.
-Do Do-hee!

214
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:40,888
Is it okay for you to move around?

215
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,765
Of course. I'm fine now. Watch this.

216
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,813
You shouldn't move around yet.
Lie down right now.

217
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,357
I'm really fine, I swear.

218
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,650
Sure you are.

219
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:58,989
Who are those men in black outside?

220
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:03,327
Director Jeong happens to be popular
with people from all walks of life.

221
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:05,538
Let's go home now.

222
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,416
If I stay here,
those punks will keep bothering me.

223
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,001
Your treatment isn't over yet.

224
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:13,087
Being with you is the best treatment.

225
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,464
Oh, my heart.

226
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:24,765
All right.

227
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:36,861
Mr. Jeong may have had an attitude,

228
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,905
but he was good at heart.

229
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:44,618
Even those who accused Ms. Do of murder
are now supporting us

230
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,121
after hearing about what happened to him.

231
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,457
That's because they feel guilty!

232
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,334
What's the point of all that now?

233
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:55,671
Why are you crying?

234
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,591
Don't be like that. We have work to do.

235
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,426
Let's show Ms. Do a neat chart

236
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,887
illustrating the shifts
in public opinion of her.

237
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:08,309
That is Mr. Jeong's parting gift
for Ms. Do!

238
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,186
We have to get back to work!

239
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,190
My goodness.

240
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,983
Mr. Jeong is fine.

241
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,651
-Sorry?
-What?

242
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:23,866
I knew it! I picked a good card today!

243
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,493
You did?

244
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:27,745
Mr. Jeong!

245
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:43,112
He saw my face. He'll come for me.

246
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:13,851
Damn it!

247
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:22,776
He's coming.

248
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,112
He's coming for me.

249
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:30,993
He's coming.

250
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:57,227
We're not even getting any static,
let alone sparks.

251
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:05,069
Perhaps we could speed up charging

252
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:09,740
if more surface area came in contact.

253
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,160
That makes perfect sense.

254
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:14,995
Then…

255
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,289
should we try hugging?

256
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:21,335
That's a good suggestion.

257
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,338
Then…

258
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:27,591
should I do this?

259
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:31,804
No.

260
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:33,681
More like this.

261
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,810
How about…

262
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:53,909
How does it feel?

263
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:58,080
I feel like I'm charging up nicely.

264
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:05,796
The lengths I go to charge you up.

265
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:47,671
All of this happened because of you.

266
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:49,757
You killed Director Jeong!

267
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:00,517
You're up.

268
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:02,895
Yes.

269
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:11,737
Don't move.

270
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:19,787
Let's go find the scumbag.

271
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:22,206
I saw his real face,
even if it was just half of it.

272
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:23,165
Now I can find him.

273
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,125
You're not going anywhere
in this condition.

274
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:26,168
Recovery comes first.

275
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,377
Revenge comes first.

276
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:29,922
I'll find him and burst his heart right…

277
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,805
You're not ready for any revenge yet.

278
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,109
It's working.

279
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:56,532
Not anymore.

280
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,534
I guess you need a lot more.

281
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,536
But still…

282
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,120
Breathing's gotten a lot easier.

283
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:04,915
You should get better
the more you charge up.

284
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,427
I have to go to work.

285
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:21,014
Can you take the day off?

286
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:22,474
-No.
-A flat-out no?

287
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,935
But you're the CEO.

288
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:27,396
Why don't you celebrate my survival
by declaring today…

289
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:29,439
the company's anniversary?

290
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,484
Rest up.

291
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:36,697
Then just five more minutes.

292
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,283
Let me charge up a bit more.

293
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:59,094
It was quite chaotic last night.

294
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:00,971
For the peace of mankind,

295
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:03,348
let's make up.

296
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:05,767
We didn't fight,
so there's no need to make up.

297
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:09,187
Also, I couldn't care less
about the peace of mankind.

298
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:14,026
There once lived a man
who loved eating pork.

299
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,777
Let's call him K.

300
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:17,362
One day,

301
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:20,991
K met a very special pig.

302
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,702
Imagine K developing affection
for this specific pig

303
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:26,038
and eventually
for all the pigs in the world.

304
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,375
Wouldn't K become a vegetarian then?

305
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:34,671
What do you say?

306
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:38,216
Let's work together
to turn K into a vegetarian.

307
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,804
What a load of bull.

308
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,727
She doesn't seem to realize
the peace of mankind is in our hands.

309
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,229
A demon is on the verge
of becoming a guardian.

310
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:00,447
Wait up.

311
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:02,616
Let me come with you.

312
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,869
Don't take your injury lightly.

313
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:07,621
You barely escaped death.

314
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:10,040
So stay home and rest for today.

315
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:13,210
Look what he did to me.

316
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:15,170
Who knows what he might do to you?

317
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:19,216
I have another bodyguard
waiting at the office.

318
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:20,509
So don't worry and--

319
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,970
No. I can't trust anyone right now.

320
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:25,889
What if the bastard shows up
disguised as a bodyguard?

321
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:28,558
I'm going to protect you myself.

322
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:31,144
Stop right there.

323
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,527
I forbid you to do so.

324
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,153
Who gives you the right?

325
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:43,615
As your butler, I put your safety first.

326
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:47,119
-You can't guard anyone in this state.
-Then you're fired.

327
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:50,080
You're no longer my butler,
so stop butting in and go home.

328
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:53,750
Is this how little you think of
our friendship forged by capitalism?

329
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:55,502
Do as he says.

330
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:56,795
You do as I say.

331
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:59,047
-I feel hurt!
-For crying out loud!

332
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:03,218
As a matter of fact, there is a solution.

333
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:14,521
This car is spacious enough
for all of us and then some.

334
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:15,647
Am I right?

335
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:21,820
Shouldn't you work on the performance
instead of following me around?

336
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,030
We'll put it on hold.

337
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:25,365
How could we carry on
when you just got stabbed?

338
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:27,826
I don't really see a correlation there.

339
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,536
An AI like you wouldn't understand.

340
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,297
You need to charge up
whenever you can to recover.

341
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:42,466
You said I can't in front of others.

342
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,301
We're officially married now.

343
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:02,110
Upon an anonymous person's request,

344
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:03,612
I accused Ms. Do Do-hee

345
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:07,366
of murdering Chairwoman Ju Cheon-suk.

346
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:11,453
I caused Ms. Do Do-hee immense damage.

347
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,372
I sincerely apologize.

348
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:19,419
Are you keeping logs of
the articles and comments by keywords?

349
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:21,129
-Yes, sir.
-Also,

350
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:24,424
Sunwol Foundation's general manager
is coming with Mr. Jeong.

351
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:26,343
I wonder if the general manager

352
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,303
would be just as handsome as Mr. Jeong.

353
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:34,101
Be careful
or you might fall into the mirror.

354
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:36,937
Here they come.

355
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:51,827
The man with the twisted head?

356
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,578
Right, it's him.

357
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,875
I apologize for the other day.

358
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,507
You scared me!

359
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,343
-I just…
-I'm okay.

360
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:11,429
I wanted to celebrate
Mr. Jeong's discharge from the hospital.

361
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:28,363
Is everyone okay?

362
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,782
Are you all good?

363
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,458
Following the confession
made by Clickbaity News yesterday,

364
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:44,129
as well as the attack on Mr…
I mean, the attack on Director Jeong,

365
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:47,757
the public opinion on Ms. Do
has shifted dramatically.

366
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:52,137
Favorable comments and news articles
about the two of you are also increasing.

367
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:55,599
Those who accused you of murder
are showing their sympathy for you now.

368
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:58,226
That's right.
Now they're eager to find out

369
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:02,522
who tried to bring you down
and kill Mr. Jeong.

370
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:06,818
No one can stop you
from running for chairwoman now.

371
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:11,448
This is all thanks to Director Jeong,
who risked his life for Ms. Do.

372
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:13,658
A round of applause!

373
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:19,372
I actually prepared a cake for you,

374
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:22,918
but I didn't bring it out earlier
as the party popper alarmed all of you.

375
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,795
What kind of cake? Strawberry? Chocolate?

376
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,255
Ta-da.

377
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:30,091
I'm not a fan of green tea
or whipped cream.

378
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:32,928
No, that's not it.
It's a black tea chiffon cake.

379
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,764
-Is that right?
-One, two

380
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,557
-One, two, three, four
-One, two, three, four

381
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:40,769
-Congratulations
-Dear Director Jeong

382
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:46,399
-Congratulations, dear Mr. Jeong
-Congratulations, dear Mr. Jeong

383
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:53,073
-On your discharge
-On your discharge

384
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:56,534
Should I make a wish?

385
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:58,245
-Sure.
-Go ahead.

386
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,667
One, two, three.

387
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:19,641
I'm sorry.

388
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:22,727
Are you okay?

389
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,324
-What's the matter?
-What do you mean?

390
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:37,784
Why were you so startled?

391
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:40,412
I've never seen you so scared before.

392
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,581
Me? Scared?

393
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:43,999
I'm a demon.

394
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,459
Nice try, but you can't fool me.

395
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:50,088
Go back to the theater
if you're going to keep talking nonsense.

396
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,215
Suit yourself then.

397
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:55,969
I'll spill everything to Do Do-hee
so she'd have you stay home.

398
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:59,139
You can't do that.

399
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:01,474
So just tell me what's going on.

400
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,479
I had this dream.

401
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:10,191
I was engulfed in huge flames,

402
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,569
and my whole body was on fire.

403
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:17,157
I can still recall
the feeling of my fingertips burning.

404
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,576
It's driving me crazy.

405
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,330
Was it spontaneous combustion?

406
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:26,666
Is this what humans call

407
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,085
fear?

408
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,213
Director Jeong.

409
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:34,174
I guess

410
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,510
I'm becoming mentally soft
as my powers weaken.

411
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:42,307
Once I recover,
everything will go back to normal.

412
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:51,900
I'm here to see Mr. Jeong.

413
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,235
He's not in at the moment.

414
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,279
Then I'd like to see Ms. Do.

415
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,033
Please proceed as suggested.

416
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:01,451
Thank you.

417
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:08,416
Ms. Jin Ga-young is here to see you.

418
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,177
Would you like some coffee or tea?

419
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,178
No need.

420
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,888
I'm not here for a chitchat.

421
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:26,768
Stop taking advantage of Director Jeong
and let him go.

422
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,770
We need each other.

423
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:29,688
Each other?

424
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:31,356
You mean you need him.

425
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:35,276
You're leading him around by the nose,
exploiting his weakness.

426
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:38,947
He almost died because of you.

427
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,282
Just how selfish are you going to be?

428
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:45,662
Sort out your mess on your own.

429
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:49,749
Stop exploiting Director Jeong
by threatening him with his tattoo.

430
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,173
I checked the CCTV at the theater,

431
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:00,176
and you were right.

432
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,511
The book was stolen.

433
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:05,849
An hour of the footage was missing
on the night the book disappeared

434
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:08,143
as well as the day you were attacked.

435
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:12,105
The culprit installed malware
to meddle with the CCTV at certain times.

436
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,815
Then that means

437
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,651
he knows what I am.

438
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:25,201
Mr. Jeong.

439
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:27,245
Someone was asking for you earlier.

440
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,204
Who?

441
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:30,498
It was a tall woman.
I don't know who it was.

442
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:34,627
Director Jeong!

443
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:48,016
I'm relieved to see you're okay.

444
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,060
Thank goodness.

445
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:07,160
I'll call a taxi.

446
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:09,621
You can go ahead, Mr. Park.

447
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,331
I'd like to talk to the director.

448
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:12,624
About what?

449
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,375
Let's just go, Star Jin.

450
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:15,585
It won't take long.

451
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:32,644
I heard that your powers were flickering.

452
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,062
No need to worry.

453
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,814
They'll be fine once I get my tattoo back.

454
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:38,191
I'm not so sure.

455
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:42,153
Do Do-hee is the reason
your powers are weakening.

456
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,072
It's not like that.

457
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,657
That's what you want to believe.

458
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,034
Deep down, you know it too.

459
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:50,578
Everything points to her as the problem.

460
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:52,413
That's none of your business.

461
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,457
Is she special to you now?

462
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:01,714
Does she hold a special place
in your heart?

463
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,515
You're becoming more and more human

464
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:13,393
because you keep experiencing
human emotions because of her.

465
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:15,687
Because you're…

466
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,483
in love with her.

467
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:26,573
Nothing is more human than loving someone.

468
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:29,534
-Stop it.
-You're the one who should stop.

469
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:31,160
If you're a demon, act like one!

470
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,497
Didn't you say so yourself

471
00:39:34,581 --> 00:39:37,041
that humans are
insignificant and weak beings?

472
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:41,838
Is that what you want to be?

473
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,845
You have to stop.

474
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:51,514
If you don't,

475
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,059
it won't end here.

476
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:15,997
Would you like some music?

477
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:18,583
No, thank you.

478
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:20,293
Okay.

479
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:25,381
Did Ga-young say anything stupid to you?

480
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:29,010
Not really.

481
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:33,222
She just invited me
to watch her performance.

482
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:37,101
Did she say something to you?

483
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:40,897
No, she didn't.

484
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:46,110
Please do come.

485
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:48,655
It's put on hold for now,
but not for too long.

486
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:50,031
Swords will be flying through the air.

487
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:51,866
I will.

488
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:58,289
Ms. Jin must've been shocked
by what happened to you.

489
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:03,836
I could feel how sincerely
she cared about you.

490
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:54,053
Madam Ju.

491
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:56,889
Should I

492
00:41:57,974 --> 00:42:00,059
keep pushing forward?

493
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,939
Jeong Gu-won almost died because of me,

494
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,735
even though he had
nothing to do with this fight.

495
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:13,656
I don't know if I should
keep pushing forward

496
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:15,658
at the expense of someone else.

497
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:18,494
But…

498
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,497
if I give up here,

499
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:27,295
it'll be unfair to you.

500
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,885
Don't worry about a dead person.

501
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:36,888
I'm just worried
it'll be frustrating for you.

502
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:39,724
I am frustrated.

503
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,852
I'm so frustrated and upset.

504
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:47,523
I lost my dear family,

505
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,027
and I don't even know who did it.

506
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:01,788
But you have a new family now.

507
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:05,708
Don't lose your new family

508
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:08,586
because of your dead one.

509
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:12,256
Still…

510
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:19,055
Do what's best for you.

511
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:22,934
Do what's best for me?

512
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:26,354
What's best for someone you care about

513
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:29,273
is also what's best for you.

514
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:35,071
Then what about you?

515
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:39,784
What's best for you?

516
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:46,457
What's best for you…

517
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,211
is what's best for me.

518
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:21,325
Seok-hoon.

519
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,453
I need to talk to you.

520
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,435
Are you okay?

521
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:49,228
Are you in pain?

522
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:51,272
I'm fine.

523
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:52,940
Did you take the painkillers?

524
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:54,191
I don't need them.

525
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:56,611
I feel great
because I've been charging up.

526
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:00,948
We should get ready for work.

527
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:18,132
Mr. Jeong.

528
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:23,179
I heard you got hurt.

529
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:25,389
I saw on the news
that someone attacked you.

530
00:45:25,473 --> 00:45:27,558
Don't believe everything
you see on the news.

531
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:29,769
They even accused
an innocent person of murder.

532
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:32,229
Let's go inside.

533
00:45:34,649 --> 00:45:36,275
Run away if you want to live.

534
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:42,573
Everyone by Do Do-hee's side
ends up dying.

535
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:50,414
Should I go beat him up?

536
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:54,585
Even I could beat him to a pulp.

537
00:45:56,212 --> 00:45:57,338
Don't mind him.

538
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:12,061
I guess Seok-hoon can't make it.

539
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:15,815
Do Do-hee's only loyal ally
would hardly miss this meeting.

540
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:17,817
He's probably running late again.

541
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,363
Let us begin the special board meeting.

542
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:26,033
Today, we will take a nomination vote

543
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:28,661
for the next chairperson of Mirae Group.

544
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:30,204
I have something to announce.

545
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:32,957
Each candidate will get a chance
to make a speech later.

546
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,543
It's an important matter
related to the vote.

547
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:38,671
All right, go ahead.

548
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:46,846
To prevent any further
conflicts and disputes,

549
00:46:48,097 --> 00:46:50,266
I hereby withdraw my candidacy.

550
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:55,521
What on earth is she playing at now?

551
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:01,277
We need to talk.

552
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:02,987
Later.

553
00:47:04,113 --> 00:47:08,117
Then let us take a vote
on whether to propose Mr. Noh Suk-min

554
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,536
as the sole candidate
for the chairperson position

555
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:12,413
at the stockholders' meeting.

556
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:23,090
IN FAVOR, AGAINST, ABSTENTION

557
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:32,224
What do you think you're doing?

558
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:34,602
Let's talk outside.

559
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:38,397
You made a difficult decision.

560
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,274
I appreciate it.

561
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:42,026
What are you playing at?

562
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:48,491
I've decided to forgive and forget.

563
00:47:49,075 --> 00:47:51,744
I'll also renounce my inheritance.

564
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:54,163
So let's put an end

565
00:47:55,498 --> 00:47:57,041
to the war.

566
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:06,717
I'm glad you made
a wise decision in the end.

567
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:11,639
Good job.

568
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:35,454
Tell me why you're doing this.

569
00:48:41,669 --> 00:48:43,087
I'm tired of it all.

570
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:45,422
Is that it?

571
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:48,259
I can't keep living in anxiety and fear.

572
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:51,178
I can't even go to work
or take a walk by myself.

573
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,390
I want to live in peace like everyone else

574
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:56,642
and go back to my normal life.

575
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:00,479
So I got rid of the reason
they wanted to hunt me down.

576
00:49:00,563 --> 00:49:01,397
No.

577
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:03,357
You're lying.

578
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:06,110
Look me in the eye.

579
00:49:07,236 --> 00:49:08,571
And tell me the truth.

580
00:49:19,415 --> 00:49:20,916
I can't trust you anymore.

581
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:23,419
What?

582
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:26,422
You can no longer protect me.

583
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:29,884
You've become so weak

584
00:49:31,177 --> 00:49:32,887
that you can't even protect yourself.

585
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:41,103
Does that answer your question?

586
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:53,968
No…

587
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,304
Why isn't he here yet?

588
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:58,639
Why?

589
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:14,613
There's something wrong with his powers.

590
00:51:33,549 --> 00:51:34,967
What is she thinking?

591
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:37,219
What's her next move?

592
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:40,931
She really caught me off guard this time.

593
00:51:41,015 --> 00:51:42,850
Maybe she just gave up.

594
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:46,895
She's too young to handle
everything that's happened after all.

595
00:51:46,979 --> 00:51:50,232
Like I said many times,
that's not how she is.

596
00:51:50,316 --> 00:51:53,068
I'm sure she's making us
let our guard down

597
00:51:53,152 --> 00:51:55,321
only to stab us all in the back.

598
00:51:56,989 --> 00:51:58,490
Her bodyguard was also recently attacked.

599
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,076
That probably scared her.

600
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,454
No way. She's not the one
who was attacked.

601
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:06,540
She's someone who wouldn't give up
even at gunpoint.

602
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:09,168
Whatever the reason,
I'm glad she finally realized her position

603
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:10,252
and gave up.

604
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:15,132
Great job, honey.

605
00:52:15,716 --> 00:52:17,384
He's not the chairman yet.

606
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:19,511
Isn't it too early for a toast?

607
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:23,057
Do-gyeong.

608
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:26,685
-Thank you for the meal.
-Stay seated until everyone's done.

609
00:52:26,769 --> 00:52:27,728
I have plans.

610
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:33,525
Noh Do-gyeong.

611
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:35,486
Sit back down right now.

612
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:52,086
Shall we?

613
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:11,522
Open the door, Director Jeong!

614
00:53:13,232 --> 00:53:14,733
Director Jeong!

615
00:53:17,403 --> 00:53:19,279
You can no longer protect me.

616
00:53:21,657 --> 00:53:23,826
You've become so weak

617
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:26,495
that you can't even protect yourself.

618
00:53:46,432 --> 00:53:48,100
You mean you need him.

619
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,979
You're leading him around by the nose,
exploiting his weakness.

620
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:54,356
He almost died because of you.

621
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:57,443
Just how selfish are you going to be?

622
00:53:57,526 --> 00:53:59,111
Run away if you want to live.

623
00:53:59,862 --> 00:54:01,989
Everyone by Do Do-hee's side
ends up dying.

624
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:12,708
RESULTS OF MIRAE GROUP
SPECIAL BOARD MEETING

625
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:15,669
CEO NOH SUK-MIN TO BE SOLE CANDIDATE
FOR THE CHAIRPERSON POSITION

626
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:24,470
I'm going to give up, Seok-hoon.

627
00:54:25,554 --> 00:54:28,015
I'll withdraw my candidacy tomorrow.

628
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:29,641
Do-hee.

629
00:54:29,725 --> 00:54:32,436
I've done my best.
I'm sure Madam Ju would understand.

630
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:36,857
It's not like catching the culprit
will bring her back to life.

631
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:43,447
I think I just needed something
to take my anger out on

632
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,407
after losing Madam Ju.

633
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:48,994
That's why I couldn't let go.

634
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,247
Once I let go,

635
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:55,042
everyone will be happy.

636
00:54:56,502 --> 00:54:57,961
Are you doing this

637
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:00,923
for Mr. Jeong?

638
00:55:02,925 --> 00:55:05,886
Because you don't want him
to get hurt again?

639
00:55:10,933 --> 00:55:14,520
I don't want to lose someone
I care about again.

640
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:36,500
You knew everything, didn't you?

641
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:37,876
What happened?

642
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:40,045
I'm sure she told you everything.

643
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:41,547
Why did she suddenly give up?

644
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:44,383
If you're so curious, ask her yourself.

645
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:46,134
She won't tell me anything!

646
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:49,763
Didn't you tell me

647
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,974
she must have her reasons
for not saying anything?

648
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:56,436
You should've talked her out of it
by any means necessary.

649
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:59,481
Don't you know how important it is
for her to find Ju Cheon-suk's killer?

650
00:55:59,565 --> 00:56:02,150
I do know. I know it all too well!

651
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:05,320
Do-hee has always

652
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:08,699
blamed herself for her parents' deaths.

653
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:11,243
She'll now blame herself
for my aunt's death as well

654
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:13,120
because of you!

655
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:15,956
What?

656
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,791
You're the reason why she gave up.

657
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:21,753
She didn't want you to get hurt again.

658
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:29,094
Do Do-hee!

659
00:56:51,617 --> 00:56:53,535
GU-WON THE SAVIOR

660
00:57:14,306 --> 00:57:15,682
All the flowers have withered.

661
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:26,026
Madam Ju.

662
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:32,282
You never got to see

663
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:35,285
your prized plants bearing fruit.

664
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,456
Are you really okay?

665
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:45,337
I'm sorry, Madam Ju.

666
00:57:51,802 --> 00:57:53,095
I'm so sorry.

667
00:58:09,403 --> 00:58:10,779
Let's go back.

668
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:13,990
If you're giving up because of me,

669
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:16,118
let's go back and fight again.

670
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:21,039
It's not like that.

671
00:58:21,999 --> 00:58:22,916
Do Do-hee.

672
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:25,252
Do what's best for you.

673
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:31,258
Because that's what's best for me.

674
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:42,477
They're all dead.

675
00:58:44,396 --> 00:58:45,897
Madam Ju,

676
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:47,232
Mom, and Dad.

677
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:50,318
Everyone I've ever loved is dead.

678
00:58:54,573 --> 00:58:55,699
And you'll die…

679
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:01,288
because of me too.

680
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:08,044
I don't care.

681
01:00:23,245 --> 01:00:25,288
Even if my feelings for you

682
01:00:25,372 --> 01:00:28,500
make me insignificant and weak,

683
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:31,795
you are my fate

684
01:00:33,672 --> 01:00:35,006
that I cannot defy.

685
01:01:37,569 --> 01:01:40,280
What's best for you
has become what's best for me.

686
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:42,449
I'm not giving up on Do Do-hee
no matter what.

687
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:44,826
Hubby, give me a piggyback ride.

688
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:46,870
I feel so free and happy.

689
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:47,996
You call yourselves the Wild Dogs?

690
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:49,039
I have a task for you.

691
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:50,248
If you fail,

692
01:01:50,332 --> 01:01:52,584
I forbid you to show up
in front of me ever again.

693
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:53,835
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

694
01:01:53,919 --> 01:01:55,712
-Yes, Detective?
-We found the culprit, Ms. Do.

695
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:56,838
His name is Gi Kwang-chul.

696
01:01:56,922 --> 01:01:59,090
He's currently on our wanted list,
so we'll be able to track him down soon.

697
01:01:59,174 --> 01:02:00,592
The hide-and-seek is over.

698
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:03,011
The clocks. They've stopped.

699
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:05,430
My powers weren't just flickering.

700
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:07,140
They're completely gone.

701
