1
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:48,340
A storage locker?

2
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:03,230
Let's go.

3
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,325
What the…

4
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:58,910
Well…

5
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:04,916
I was just covering our faces
so he wouldn't recognize us.

6
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:09,254
Good call.

7
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,425
Why didn't your powers work
all of a sudden?

8
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,011
Right? Why didn't they work?

9
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:21,725
Noh Do-gyeong.

10
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:33,654
He's gone.

11
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,742
Where did he go?

12
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,035
Did he go outside?

13
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:13,985
We can't let Noh Do-gyeong see this.

14
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,701
What was he looking for in here?

15
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:23,036
Did he already take it?

16
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,122
What are you looking for?

17
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,502
You're that Arabica woman.

18
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,087
Arabica?

19
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,004
As in coffee?

20
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:34,256
What are you looking for?

21
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,425
I know this place
like the back of my hand, so tell me.

22
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:37,843
Who are you?

23
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:39,344
Who do I look like?

24
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:41,054
-A beggar.
-Bingo.

25
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,181
I accept wire transfers.

26
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:44,808
JESUS CORP.
DAEGUK BANK

27
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,059
"Jesus Corp."?

28
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:48,437
It sounds pretty reliable, doesn't it?

29
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,189
Where did you sneak up from?

30
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:54,234
I never snuck up on you.
You just didn't notice me.

31
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,777
And I'm not the intruder here.

32
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:57,904
You're the ones who entered my turf.

33
00:03:58,947 --> 00:03:59,781
Your turf?

34
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,622
I have the best spot around here.

35
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,207
Warm and sunny.

36
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,586
We don't have time for this.

37
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,175
It's flickering.

38
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,556
What flickers

39
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,266
is bound to go out sooner or later.

40
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,314
Do you know her?

41
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:36,359
She's just another deranged human
with a messed up soul.

42
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,528
Don't mind her.

43
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:56,379
EPISODE 7
STAINED RELATIONSHIPS

44
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:01,510
Where did he go?

45
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,595
Let's go after him.

46
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:04,971
This should do.

47
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:07,641
What are you doing?

48
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:09,184
I want to test something out.

49
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,027
My powers are fine.

50
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,780
So what went wrong earlier?

51
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,573
Let's go find Noh Do-gyeong first.

52
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,009
Should we follow him in?

53
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:44,469
No, that's too…

54
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,360
That's too risky.

55
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:03,238
Let's call it a day.

56
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:24,467
Do-gyeong.

57
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,223
-Yes?
-Can we talk for a second?

58
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,894
Have you been seeing
your psychiatrist these days?

59
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,940
I want to take a break from therapy.
I've been busy lately.

60
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,360
Speaking of which,

61
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:46,823
your father was asking
what you were up to these days.

62
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:47,824
And?

63
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,118
I told him I didn't know.

64
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:52,871
As expected.

65
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,457
Just keep being in the dark.

66
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,374
Do-gyeong.

67
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,876
I can take care of myself.

68
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,544
So stop making appointments.

69
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:01,921
I don't trust psychiatrists.

70
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,232
Ma'am.

71
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:25,070
I loved our meditation session today.

72
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:28,239
I have to attend a charity event tomorrow,

73
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:30,617
so can we reschedule our session?

74
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,534
Of course.

75
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:32,869
Thank you.

76
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,414
A bad connection?

77
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:37,874
What was the problem?

78
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,386
It's making my head spin.

79
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:52,764
That's right.

80
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,557
The same thing happened that day too.

81
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,309
The day I lost my powers.

82
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:59,896
I almost got hit by a car
because my powers were acting up.

83
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,940
And that's how my tattoo
transferred to you.

84
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,902
You're clearly the problem here.

85
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,154
If anyone has a problem, it's you.
Don't blame me.

86
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:09,280
I'm not blaming you.

87
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:12,701
It's just that my powers
never flickered until I met you.

88
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:15,412
Nor did my tattoo ever transfer to anyone.

89
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,247
Don't you hear yourself?

90
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,707
You're blaming me

91
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:22,544
for almost getting hit by a car
and for your tattoo transferring to me.

92
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:23,753
You're also blaming me

93
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,756
for your amazing powers flickering today.

94
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,719
What I mean is it'll be a nuisance
if they act up again at a crucial moment.

95
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:32,804
-Like earlier.
-A "nuisance"?

96
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,807
If it was such a nuisance,
why did you do it?

97
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,350
Do you think I enjoyed it?

98
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,477
-So you didn't enjoy it?
-Did you?

99
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:52,824
Why isn't Mr. Park here yet?

100
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,828
I can't even have my coffee comfortably,
for crying out loud.

101
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,748
Where's the coffee?

102
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,926
SUNWOL THEATER
CONSTRUCTION COMPLETION CEREMONY

103
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,932
Sunwol Theater…

104
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:02,018
Going to some newlyweds'
housewarming party?

105
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,854
They're not really married,
nor is it a housewarming party.

106
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,440
I was just joking. Don't be so stiff.

107
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:10,068
I'm not stiff.
It's just that you're too relaxed.

108
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:14,072
That's a lot of stuff.
It seems a bit unnecessary.

109
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,574
Have you ever heard this phrase?

110
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:20,829
"The coming of a person
means their whole life comes with them."

111
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,547
Come hither, life!

112
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:32,590
Come hither!

113
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,888
What are all these?

114
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,974
My clothes, my necessities,

115
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,768
and my small but precious collection
that reflects my taste.

116
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,313
-You call this a small collection?
-Yes.

117
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,899
It's as if the entire
Sunwol Foundation is moving in.

118
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,361
That's because Sunwol Foundation and I
are one and the same.

119
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,822
Where should I put these?

120
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,032
Those are my treasures.
Put them over here.

121
00:10:58,116 --> 00:10:59,784
No, there's no room over here.

122
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,745
-Put them in Do Do-hee's room that way.
-Okay.

123
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:03,997
No!

124
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:13,006
Can we talk for a second?

125
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:18,803
What is this about? Can it wait?

126
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:32,400
You're not the only one living here.

127
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:35,236
You share this apartment with me.

128
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,613
So?

129
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,364
Get rid of all the unnecessary things.

130
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,825
Then everything stays. I need all of it.

131
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,368
-Get rid of them right now.
-No.

132
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,537
Do you want to live
in such a cramped space?

133
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:46,497
It's your fault
for living in a tiny place.

134
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:48,041
It's not that the place is tiny.

135
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:51,377
It's that you have
way too much stuff, you hoarder.

136
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:52,879
It's not just some stuff.

137
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:56,215
Each object reflects my taste and history
and represents my identity.

138
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,800
Each object is Jeong Gu-won himself.

139
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:05,558
You leave me no choice.

140
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:16,027
Enjoy living
with your countless other selves.

141
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,243
At least give me my coffee.

142
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,330
Thanks.

143
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:41,552
It's finally sinking in
that you're married.

144
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,137
Is this how marriage is?

145
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:46,057
I can't even bring my stuff
into the house freely?

146
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,768
How would I know? I'm a shining solo.

147
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,353
Not like you ever could,

148
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,313
but you should never get married.

149
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:54,357
-Don't jinx it!
-My coffee!

150
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:56,526
Watch what you say.

151
00:12:58,236 --> 00:12:59,988
I'll take your stuff with me.

152
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:01,239
Go back inside.

153
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,156
No.

154
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,992
I have my pride.

155
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:05,451
I can't go back in like this.

156
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,082
Do you know how hard it was to get this?

157
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,001
Do you?

158
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:14,210
Is it that bad?

159
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,586
I'm not drinking it.

160
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,171
It could be all the garlic I ate.

161
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,385
That's just how marriage is.

162
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,724
You talk as if you've been married before.

163
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,308
I did get married.

164
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:33,563
-What?
-To be more exact, I was married.

165
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,523
When did this happen?

166
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,358
On a sabbatical five years ago.

167
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:40,987
I didn't let anyone know just in case.

168
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,405
It was low-key.

169
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,657
That's the only thing

170
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:47,160
I commend myself for
regarding that marriage.

171
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,211
Marriage sure is crazy in many ways.

172
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:01,799
This too?

173
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:03,634
Lucky me.

174
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,557
See? Everything fits.

175
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,185
How can she live in a place
smaller than a car?

176
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,771
It's not that the place is small.
It's your greed that's too much.

177
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,190
Look at all the stuff you own.

178
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:22,487
DO-HEE THE NUTJOB

179
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:24,906
Who is this?

180
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:25,990
"Who is this?"

181
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:29,285
Mr. Who, aren't you coming back in?

182
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,622
You told me to live with my other selves.

183
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:40,630
Did he just run away from home?

184
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,177
He ran out after just one day?

185
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,970
I should teach him a lesson.

186
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,514
I'm never calling him again.

187
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:51,891
I shouldn't have registered his…

188
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,811
When did he hide that there?

189
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:57,522
Unbelievable.
You're the one who kicked me out.

190
00:14:58,523 --> 00:14:59,941
You should get going.

191
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,317
Go work on the performance.

192
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:06,280
The thing is, Star Jin disappeared
after finding out about your marriage.

193
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,866
The press conference is tomorrow,
but I can't reach her.

194
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,326
She's skipping rehearsals too.

195
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,287
Could you go talk to her?

196
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:14,622
Why should I?

197
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:17,125
She must feel like
her guardian is cheating on her.

198
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,085
Forget it. Cancel the show
if she doesn't come back.

199
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,795
-I can't just--
-Go.

200
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:22,755
-Still--
-Just go!

201
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:39,021
What on earth is this?

202
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,277
He has way too many selves.

203
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:47,321
Talk about the splitting of the ego.

204
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:52,160
You got yourself a doormat.

205
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,043
A doormat?

206
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,630
Someone who's always there.

207
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:08,092
You take them for granted,
end up neglecting them,

208
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:11,429
and blame them for everything
because they're that easy to you.

209
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,098
Like how we were with each other.

210
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:19,020
Is that why you threw me
that surprise party?

211
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,313
To make me appreciate you?

212
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,734
You really craved my love, didn't you?

213
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,862
I liked that we
treated each other that way.

214
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,282
That's what a real family is like.

215
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:34,994
Though we weren't related,

216
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,122
we were most like family to each other.

217
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,251
I agree.

218
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,297
But don't worry.

219
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,799
No one can ever replace you.

220
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,849
SEOK-HOON

221
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:06,859
Hi, Seok-hoon.

222
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,611
Hi, Do-hee. Where are you?

223
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,239
I'd like to talk to you in private.

224
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:12,740
About what?

225
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,535
It's about Mr. Jeong Gu-won.

226
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,834
So you're not going to call me?

227
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,712
Then I'll just live in my car.

228
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,297
No big deal.

229
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:35,429
For crying out loud.

230
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:39,016
Why is there so much stuff?

231
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,738
This is better than the apartment.

232
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:54,657
More spacious and comfortable.

233
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,548
I didn't know you were here, Ms. Shin.

234
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,925
I'm here because
Mr. Jeong was moving in today.

235
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:15,845
I see.

236
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,432
-Shall we talk in the study?
-Sure.

237
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,061
What is this about?

238
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:28,441
Has Mr. Jeong officially moved in?

239
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,401
It's to prevent gossip about our marriage.

240
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,864
What is it? Just spit it out.

241
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,408
Did Jeong Gu-won
get in trouble or something?

242
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:41,787
Do-hee, how much do you know about him?

243
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,081
Well…

244
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,959
There doesn't seem to be much
to know about him.

245
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:50,880
Did you look into him properly
before marrying him?

246
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:55,426
Are you talking about
his family or educational credentials?

247
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,095
I have something to show you.

248
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:10,524
This is from the construction completion
ceremony of Sunwol Theater back in 1977.

249
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,110
Take a look at this.

250
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,697
Mr. Jeong is here.

251
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:33,214
He's the spitting image
of his grandfather.

252
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:36,676
This is the former executive director.

253
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:39,845
Is that really what you think?

254
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,138
Then what else?

255
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,058
Talk about dominant genes.

256
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,518
How can they look so alike?

257
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,243
THE MAN DO DO-HEE CHOSE,
JEONG GU-WON'S LOOKS AND WEALTH

258
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,786
No signal underground?

259
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,178
That's better.

260
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,266
It's working.

261
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,476
It's working.

262
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:29,270
It's working!

263
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,858
Oh, come on.

264
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,447
I didn't know we were expecting a guest.

265
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,990
I had to talk with Do-hee.

266
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,032
About what?

267
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,286
Let's go grab a drink.

268
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:51,625
Don't you want to know
what Do-hee and I talked about?

269
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,051
Get to the point.

270
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:03,429
I don't want to leave
Do Do-hee alone for too long.

271
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:04,555
Don't worry.

272
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,223
Ms. Shin is with her.

273
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:08,684
That's good. She's someone I can trust.

274
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:12,062
There seem to be many things

275
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:14,440
you and Do-hee are keeping from me.

276
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,569
That's because we have
a very special relationship.

277
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:26,952
You're not human, are you?

278
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:29,538
What do you…

279
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:32,249
What do you mean?

280
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,210
I'm obviously human, aren't I?

281
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:36,837
Are you a vampire?

282
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:38,881
Don't you compare me
to those damn mosquitos.

283
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:48,933
I find you very suspicious, Mr. Jeong.

284
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:51,936
Isn't it that you just hate me?

285
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:53,813
That's also true.

286
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,148
Speaking of which,

287
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:58,943
I plan on keeping an eye on you.

288
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:04,573
And if it becomes clear
that you could be a harm to Do-hee,

289
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:10,830
I won't just sit back, Mr. Jeong.

290
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,125
Then what?

291
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:18,462
I'll dig out your secret
and reveal it to the whole world.

292
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,882
I'm not scared at all.

293
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:24,134
You're really bad with threats.

294
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:28,055
I admit that I'm not a scary person.

295
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:32,768
But I can certainly be a nuisance.

296
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:34,687
I'm quite persistent.

297
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:42,403
I'll disturb and bother you
so persistently

298
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,155
that you can no longer maintain

299
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:48,117
the peace and happiness
that you enjoy in your daily life.

300
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:49,743
You see,

301
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:52,413
one termite can
slowly eat away at the wood

302
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,623
to the point
that the whole house collapses.

303
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:02,464
Gosh, I got myself another fan.

304
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,341
I'm too popular for my own good.

305
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:11,890
But you shouldn't bother.

306
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:13,726
Because I'm made of concrete.

307
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,227
Bye.

308
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:27,239
Come hang out at our bar.
It's around the corner.

309
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:29,033
Are you sure you don't want to?

310
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,367
That's a shame.

311
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:33,787
Want to hang out at our bar?

312
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:37,124
I'll give you free drinks and food
and hook you up with hot guys.

313
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,293
Get lost.

314
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,339
-Come back if you change your mind!
-I don't give a damn about any boring guy.

315
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,262
What the…

316
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:56,852
It hurts.

317
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:04,610
Go get me more drinks!

318
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:07,488
I said get more drinks!

319
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,374
Where are you hiding?

320
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,334
Jin Ga-young!

321
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,086
Come out right now!

322
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,421
Or else I'll beat you up.

323
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:27,508
A good girl should obey
if your old man tells you to get drinks

324
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,760
or even to drop dead.

325
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:33,180
How dare you talk back to me?

326
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,099
You brat.

327
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:39,978
I got you, you damn rat.

328
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:43,524
Did you think you could hide from me?

329
00:24:58,122 --> 00:24:59,373
Who are you?

330
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:02,626
What the hell are you doing in my house?

331
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,627
Hi.

332
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:05,212
I'm here to collect a debt from you.

333
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:06,588
You're a loan shark?

334
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:08,674
Fine, I'll pay you back.

335
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:09,883
How much?

336
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:12,970
You sold your soul to me
for 100 million won 10 years ago.

337
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,222
And I'm here to collect it.

338
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:17,808
What? Ten years ago?

339
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,560
You don't remember?

340
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,813
You were pretty drunk then too.

341
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,189
Let me jog your memory.

342
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:29,486
You gambled away all the money I gave you
right then and there.

343
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:32,781
I thought that was a dream.

344
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:33,699
No, it wasn't.

345
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:36,618
Here's proof.

346
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,789
Damn it.

347
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,875
Take my soul if you can.

348
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:44,710
Lay a finger on me,

349
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,879
and I'll cut your whole hand off!

350
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:49,548
This hand?

351
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:07,733
You shouldn't have gambled
if you're neither talented nor lucky.

352
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:10,611
Come on out.

353
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:12,404
No one's going to harm you anymore.

354
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:24,625
Are you an angel?

355
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:27,878
Me? What makes you think so?

356
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,880
You saved me.

357
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,346
Angels…

358
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:39,765
never come to save you.

359
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:43,268
Then who are you?

360
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,229
I'm a demon.

361
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:48,357
You humans call me the devil.

362
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:50,859
A demon?

363
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,501
Mister!

364
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,169
Take me with you!

365
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,588
I don't make deals with children.

366
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:13,048
Then forget about deals!

367
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:16,510
I'm good at cooking and doing laundry!

368
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:18,011
I'm good at everything!

369
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:19,054
No, thanks.

370
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,907
I'm going to find you.

371
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,660
I'll find you no matter what,

372
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:43,787
and I'll…

373
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,215
Do you know how hard it was to find you?

374
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:01,930
Do you have any idea
what I've been holding onto until now?

375
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,228
Excuse me. Are you okay?

376
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,232
Did you get dumped?

377
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:14,943
Stop crying and join us.

378
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:18,322
-Get lost.
-Don't be like that.

379
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,407
I could be your rebound.

380
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,783
What the hell?

381
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:23,869
Beat it, you creep.

382
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,625
What? Say that again, you slut.

383
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:33,420
Are you okay?

384
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:34,630
-Let me go.
-Hey, don't.

385
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,548
-Go ahead and hit me.
-Why you little…

386
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,759
-Let go!
-Hit me, you scumbag!

387
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:48,435
Director Jeong.

388
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,442
-Fine.
-Let's go.

389
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:57,611
-I get it, so let go!
-Let's just go.

390
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,783
I knew you'd come to save me again.

391
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:15,087
We're almost there, Star Jin.

392
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,713
You're such a good girl.

393
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,383
Let's sit you down.

394
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:20,759
There you go.

395
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:26,098
Director Jeong,

396
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:28,266
you're not married for real, are you?

397
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,728
It's just for show, right?

398
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:37,359
Yes.

399
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,154
All right then.

400
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:43,782
That's all I need to know.

401
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:48,078
Goodness, I feel so sorry for her.

402
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:52,374
I have a nuisance on my tail, Mr. Park.

403
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:56,044
Not her.

404
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:57,212
Then who else?

405
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,006
Ju Seok-hoon is going to tail me.

406
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:02,509
I told you it would break
the hearts of many

407
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,428
if you married Do Do-hee.

408
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:08,890
A man's grudge is a scary thing.
We have a major situation here.

409
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,602
What if he gets up to something?

410
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:14,813
Like what? I doubt it.

411
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,149
It doesn't bode well.

412
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,946
More papers to sign?

413
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:27,409
Sunwol Foundation doesn't stop running
just because you're not here.

414
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:33,123
How is marriage treating you?

415
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,207
I don't know.

416
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,168
It's awkward and uncomfortable.

417
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:37,961
As expected.

418
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:44,051
Even so, I feel at ease
since Do Do-hee's always in my sight.

419
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,472
I'm talking about the tattoo.

420
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:51,683
I feel relieved to have the tattoo
in sight all the time.

421
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:53,101
Seriously…

422
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:01,109
By the way,
something strange happened today.

423
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,027
Like what?

424
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,403
My powers…

425
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,198
flickered.

426
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,992
That's ridiculous.
What are they, fluorescent lights?

427
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:10,619
They suddenly stopped working.

428
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:13,413
But when I tried again,

429
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:15,415
it was fine.

430
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:16,917
Maybe it was a bad connection.

431
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,128
That's what I thought,
but it had happened before too.

432
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:22,005
When I got into the accident
with Do Do-hee.

433
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:23,590
That's true.

434
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:26,593
You mentioned this happening
when you first lost your powers.

435
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:30,180
Were there any symptoms
before they flickered?

436
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:34,643
I also had the same dream
again this morning.

437
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:41,066
Could it be

438
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:42,901
that you're becoming human?

439
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:43,819
Becoming human?

440
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,571
Your memories return to you
the longer you stay without your powers.

441
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:50,659
And the more human you become,
the weaker your powers get.

442
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:51,576
You're right.

443
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:54,871
Come to think of it,
it wasn't like me to experience

444
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:57,541
a sudden surge of unreasonable
and unnecessary emotions.

445
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,418
Unreasonable and unnecessary emotions?

446
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:02,671
Emotions like guilt and compassion.

447
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,089
And lo…

448
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,090
What?

449
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:07,801
That's about it.

450
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:10,762
This really isn't like you.

451
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,430
Lie low until you get the tattoo back.

452
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:14,474
What if something happens
while your powers--

453
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:16,393
All right, I get it!

454
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:18,353
There's no need to nag.

455
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:23,650
I'm not nagging.
I'm just expressing my concerns.

456
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:28,029
When I get my tattoo back,

457
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:31,283
everything…

458
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:34,202
will go back to normal, right?

459
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,581
Both my powers…

460
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:42,711
and emotions.

461
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:47,174
SUNWOL FOUNDATION

462
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:49,236
What a lunatic.

463
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:49,671
So you came back home at night?

464
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:51,423
You're still up.

465
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,676
How could I go to bed
when I didn't even know where you were?

466
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,803
Were you worried about me?

467
00:34:57,387 --> 00:34:58,388
As if.

468
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:01,766
Humans worry even when
their dogs don't come home,

469
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,393
although you wouldn't understand.

470
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,645
-Now that you're back, I'm off to bed.
-Hold on.

471
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:08,523
I'd like to charge up.

472
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:09,608
Charge?

473
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:20,744
Do you really think

474
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:23,288
this will make your powers
stop flickering?

475
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:27,417
We should try what we can.

476
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:34,007
Could it be because
it's time for a new deal?

477
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,553
There are no signs
of spontaneous combustion.

478
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:42,390
I may have used up my powers
while taking us around.

479
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,062
We should be careful then.

480
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:54,194
Don't mind me and go to sleep.

481
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:59,532
I can't sleep with someone next to me,
so go ahead and sleep yourself.

482
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:02,285
Demons don't need sleep.

483
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:04,996
Then I guess we're staying up all night.

484
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:12,856
This unreasonable and unnecessary emotion

485
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,650
that will be gone soon…

486
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,008
MS. SHIN

487
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,145
Yes, Ms. Shin?

488
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:36,231
We have a problem, Ms. Do.

489
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:40,026
Who benefited the most
from Chairwoman Ju's death?

490
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,236
It's Do Do-hee.

491
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,197
Why would she disregard her own children,
who are successful CEOs,

492
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,115
and leave everything to some young girl?

493
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:48,034
That makes no sense.

494
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,327
-More importantly,
-More importantly,

495
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,453
…her will was last edited…

496
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:52,497
-…on the day of Chairwoman Ju's death.
-…on the day of Chairwoman Ju's death.

497
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,249
-…on the day of Chairwoman Ju's death.
-…Chairwoman Ju's death.

498
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,375
…on the day of Chairwoman Ju's death.

499
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:58,419
-The will was tampered with.
-She was cremated to destroy evidence.

500
00:38:58,503 --> 00:38:59,337
Is she…

501
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,381
Is she the witch of the century or what?

502
00:39:02,382 --> 00:39:03,883
MIRAE GROUP'S PRINCESS
COMMITTED MURDER FOR INHERITANCE?

503
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,056
She committed murder for the inheritance?

504
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,808
What? What happened?

505
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,227
This is insane.

506
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:19,566
THE DEATH OF MIRAE GROUP'S CHAIRWOMAN JU,
WAS CEO DO AFTER THE INHERITANCE?

507
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:21,150
Show no leniency.

508
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:23,278
Take a firm stand!

509
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,404
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

510
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:26,239
-Hello.
-I got you.

511
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:28,867
-We'll have to take legal action
-You too! You're all dead meat.

512
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,369
-unless you take down the article.
-Take a firm stand!

513
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,913
Clickbaity News
first launched this fake news,

514
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:36,457
which then circulated on social media
and online communities.

515
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:39,586
Even the press joined in
on spreading the misinformation.

516
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:41,671
We're taking legal action
and deleting the articles,

517
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:45,216
but we can't seem to keep up
with all the new articles.

518
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,803
What exactly did Mr. Lee hear
at the wedding?

519
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:50,471
When will you break the story?

520
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:51,931
Today is a happy day.

521
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,392
Let her enjoy it.

522
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,604
Mr. Lee assumed
they were talking about a surprise gift.

523
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,647
It did catch me by surprise.

524
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,901
The board evaluates
chairperson candidates, right?

525
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:04,277
Yes.

526
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,571
But they'll probably cite
the damage to the corporate image

527
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,656
and deny your candidacy.

528
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:12,660
Has the legal team
gathered for the meeting?

529
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,746
-Yes.
-Please start without me.

530
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:15,872
Yes, ma'am.

531
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:22,003
I'll go talk to the board members.

532
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:26,132
I'll try to persuade those who were
on good terms with Aunt Cheon-suk and…

533
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:27,717
How about we go the easy way first?

534
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:29,218
Which is?

535
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:32,847
Why don't we persuade
the source of the rumors in person?

536
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,807
It's not that simple.

537
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:38,394
Those who spread fake news for a living
won't bat an eye at most things.

538
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:40,271
Please give us some time.

539
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,273
We'll see what we can do.

540
00:40:57,747 --> 00:40:59,040
So are we visiting this guy?

541
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,501
We have to stop by somewhere first.

542
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:06,047
Ms. Do.

543
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:08,591
Where did she go?

544
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:37,954
Stay here.

545
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,247
I'll talk to him alone.

546
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,722
What brings you all the way here?

547
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:02,895
You sent me a wedding gift
that I don't deserve.

548
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:09,444
You seemed bent on
keeping the stock prices up.

549
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:12,238
But when it comes to bringing me down,

550
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,532
you couldn't care less
about the corporate image.

551
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:20,621
Nothing could possibly stop the truth
from coming out.

552
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:25,877
I didn't know the word "truth"
could be used that way.

553
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,296
The truth is whatever
the majority wants to believe.

554
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:32,759
And you definitely deserve the gift.

555
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,306
Madam Ju used to say

556
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,601
that she gave birth to the devil's spawn.

557
00:42:48,608 --> 00:42:51,736
I guess a mother knows her child
better than anyone does.

558
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:55,656
She went so far as to put you behind bars
to put some sense into you.

559
00:42:57,867 --> 00:42:59,285
But she failed.

560
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:09,504
I've always been curious.

561
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:15,093
Was it really a drunken mistake
when you ran someone over?

562
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:16,803
Or…

563
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,055
did you step on the pedal

564
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:21,808
on purpose?

565
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:31,025
Why don't you see for yourself?

566
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:20,074
Do Do-hee!

567
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:22,451
Are you okay?

568
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:28,249
You should always be careful.

569
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:32,295
Anyone can have a bad day.

570
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:34,839
Like the bastard I ran over.

571
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,100
How cowardly.

572
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:49,562
Shooting at me from behind.

573
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:51,480
That's what it means to be at war.

574
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:56,986
You may be a fake husband,
but you should be a real bodyguard.

575
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:05,620
Let's go.

576
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:08,289
We have a war to win.

577
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:25,556
Do you see the look in her eyes?

578
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:28,976
It sends shivers down my spine.

579
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:31,187
You actually can
judge a book by its cover.

580
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:34,398
She proposed to him at the funeral
where everyone else was in grief,

581
00:45:34,482 --> 00:45:36,817
and got married immediately afterward.

582
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:40,613
It's as if she'd been waiting
for Chairwoman Ju to die.

583
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:42,615
The government

584
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:45,534
should punish such maniacs
for the greater good and…

585
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:49,830
What's happening?

586
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:52,124
What's going on?

587
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:54,543
I was getting a ton of donations.

588
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:57,338
Having fun?

589
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:58,506
Oh, my goodness!

590
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:02,093
You're Do Do-hee.

591
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:04,804
You look much better in real life.

592
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:10,142
How much did you get paid?

593
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:14,855
I know who put you up to this.

594
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:16,273
What do you mean?

595
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:17,733
I have no idea.

596
00:46:17,817 --> 00:46:19,694
I just got paid in Bitcoin.

597
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:23,239
I suppose. They'd never be that careless.

598
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:26,033
So who is it? Noh Suk-min? Noh Su-ahn?

599
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:28,119
Hold on. Who else could it be?

600
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:30,329
What's your wish?

601
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:31,914
That came out of nowhere.

602
00:46:31,998 --> 00:46:34,166
There must be a reason why
you're doing this.

603
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:37,920
I just want to get famous and rich.

604
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:40,673
I can grant that wish for you.

605
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:42,008
What?

606
00:46:51,726 --> 00:46:52,727
Where are we?

607
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,186
The Bank of Korea's vault.

608
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:55,104
What?

609
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,148
Holy shit!

610
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,442
Unbelievable! How much could this be?

611
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:01,652
Are you a magician or something?

612
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:04,488
Since you have money now,
it's time to give you fame.

613
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:07,658
-How?
-We're going to leave you in here.

614
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:10,786
When the bank opens in the morning,
you'll be caught red-handed.

615
00:47:11,454 --> 00:47:14,540
Your face and name
will be all over the news.

616
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,960
-What?
-See you on the news.

617
00:47:18,044 --> 00:47:20,129
Sir, wait!

618
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:21,547
I'll do anything you say.

619
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:22,882
-Anything I say?
-Yes.

620
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:25,051
-No.
-Please!

621
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:33,726
You must have charged up well.
Your powers are back.

622
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:35,644
I know. I worried for nothing.

623
00:47:40,441 --> 00:47:42,026
What do you want?

624
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,611
Where did you hide the demon manual?

625
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:46,989
You really did an amazing job this time.

626
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:49,867
I put it on the shelf.

627
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:50,993
I can't find it.

628
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,162
By the way, the sound quality is insane.

629
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:55,164
It's as if you're right behind me.

630
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:56,749
I am right behind you.

631
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:58,042
My goodness!

632
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,460
Gosh.

633
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:01,962
I'll never get used to this.

634
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:04,590
Why can't you find the book? It's right…

635
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:08,094
It's not there.

636
00:48:08,177 --> 00:48:09,804
I could've sworn I put it there.

637
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:11,055
I told you. It's not there.

638
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:13,140
Are you sure you didn't misplace it?

639
00:48:13,224 --> 00:48:14,058
HISTORY OF SUNWOL FOUNDATION

640
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:16,310
I haven't touched it
since we read it together.

641
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:17,770
And you didn't go through my stuff?

642
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:19,105
I didn't.

643
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:30,366
"Jeong Il-won, Jeong I-won,
Jeong Sam-won…"

644
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:32,660
As in one, two, and three?

645
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,663
Everyone around me
seems to have sticky fingers.

646
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:39,959
I guess your next name
will be Sip-won like "ten won."

647
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:42,086
I don't think so.

648
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:43,129
But it is.

649
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:45,131
Pal-won for eight, Gu-won for nine,

650
00:48:45,214 --> 00:48:46,423
Sip-won for ten.

651
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:48,551
I will never go with that name.

652
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:50,761
Why not? I like it.
It rolls off the tongue.

653
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:52,054
Sip-won.

654
00:48:52,138 --> 00:48:52,972
Jeong Sip-won.

655
00:48:53,556 --> 00:48:54,390
She has a point.

656
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:57,393
Our foundation is all about tradition.
Keep the tradition alive.

657
00:48:57,476 --> 00:49:00,479
I shouldn't have started
with the name Jeong Il-won.

658
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:03,023
What's the title of the missing book?

659
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:04,608
I'll help you look for it.

660
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:07,820
The title is simply "Demon."

661
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:10,531
It's green, and there's
an eye-like thing on the spine.

662
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:11,448
Oh, that one.

663
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:14,702
He was so protective of it,
so I assumed it was his diary.

664
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:15,953
What kind of book is it?

665
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:17,580
It's a demon manual.

666
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:20,708
What is he, an air purifier?

667
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:21,792
See? She also thinks…

668
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,920
I'd love to give it a read
when we find it.

669
00:49:25,004 --> 00:49:25,963
Why would you read it?

670
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:28,716
Because I use a demon as my bodyguard.

671
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:29,633
"Use"?

672
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:31,927
You use me as a charger as well.

673
00:49:32,553 --> 00:49:33,470
That's true.

674
00:49:37,183 --> 00:49:39,518
So what's written in that book?

675
00:49:39,602 --> 00:49:41,937
The etymology behind the name "demon,"
their powers and usage,

676
00:49:42,021 --> 00:49:42,938
limitations, and--

677
00:49:43,022 --> 00:49:44,023
Anyway,

678
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:45,774
it's an important book.

679
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:48,068
Limitations? I didn't know you had them.

680
00:49:48,152 --> 00:49:49,278
So…

681
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:53,991
It's top secret, so I can't tell you.

682
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:58,829
What's gotten into you, Mr. Park?
You usually can't keep your mouth shut.

683
00:49:58,913 --> 00:50:01,248
I'm a professional butler.

684
00:50:17,056 --> 00:50:18,432
Their powers?

685
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:21,101
"The limitations of a demon."

686
00:50:21,185 --> 00:50:26,106
"Demons cannot interfere with God's work."

687
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:30,694
"They cannot kill the living
or bring the dead back to life."

688
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:32,446
"Nor can they prevent natural disasters…"

689
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:35,866
"Upon breaking this rule,

690
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:40,329
they perish through
spontaneous combustion."

691
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:45,084
Just take us to where the book is.

692
00:50:45,668 --> 00:50:48,504
You can find a person
as long as you know their face.

693
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:49,880
You could find the book that way.

694
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:51,507
It doesn't work on objects.

695
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,133
My powers only work on faces.

696
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:54,969
Your powers are surprisingly limited.

697
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:57,554
But there is another way.

698
00:51:14,113 --> 00:51:15,030
It's not on the shelves.

699
00:51:15,114 --> 00:51:17,032
Where on earth did you hide it?

700
00:51:17,116 --> 00:51:19,868
Check the CCTV footage.
It's either misplaced or stolen.

701
00:51:19,952 --> 00:51:21,578
Who'd steal it? No one knows about it.

702
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:25,916
Ju Seok-hoon is suspicious about who I am.
703

703
00:51:30,296 --> 00:51:32,423
He saw right through me.

704
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,842
Still, it couldn't have been him.

705
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:38,470
He'd never sneak into
someone's place to steal.

706
00:51:39,138 --> 00:51:40,097
We don't know that.

707
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,558
How come you trust him but no one else?

708
00:51:44,977 --> 00:51:46,603
The final rehearsal. Excuse me.

709
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,189
A rehearsal?

710
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:52,526
Lower the brightness.
It's too bright right now.

711
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,823
I'm glad to see you working so hard.

712
00:51:57,906 --> 00:52:00,284
I'm going to show everyone
why I'm called a star.

713
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:02,828
It's perfect.

714
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,386
Will you be okay?

715
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:22,139
Of course.

716
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:25,017
Their marriage is just for show anyway.

717
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:30,999
That was perfect!

718
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:37,756
What do you think?

719
00:53:57,109 --> 00:53:58,485
It was wonderful.

720
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:02,781
The beauty of the performance
made it all the more sorrowful.

721
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:05,784
It wasn't for you.

722
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:27,097
Why didn't you compliment her?

723
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:29,558
She's finally back on track
and working so hard.

724
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:32,269
This was what I saw in my dream.

725
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:36,648
A memory from when I was human.

726
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:38,525
What?

727
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:41,570
The woman in my dream
was dancing just like…

728
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:55,000
SUNWOL FOUNDATION

729
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,168
She was amazing.

730
00:54:57,336 --> 00:54:59,338
I had thought she was just someone mean.

731
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:02,633
Perhaps she's sensitive
because she's an artist.

732
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:07,137
What's wrong?

733
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:09,014
What do you mean?

734
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:11,808
You seem a bit out of it
since we watched the performance.

735
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:15,896
It's nothing.

736
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:17,564
Let me take you home.

737
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:19,775
Do you have somewhere to go?

738
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:21,610
There will be a press conference soon.

739
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:24,571
I should at least be there
as the executive director.

740
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:40,254
Again?

741
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:46,927
Jeong Gu-won.

742
00:55:52,391 --> 00:55:53,725
Why now of all times?

743
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:58,564
What's going on?

744
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:00,315
What should we do?

745
00:56:01,525 --> 00:56:03,527
You scumbags
haven't come to your senses yet?

746
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:07,322
On the count of three, run.

747
00:56:08,574 --> 00:56:12,452
I'll beat you all to a pulp today.

748
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:16,665
One, two, three.

749
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:18,250
Boss!

750
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:19,209
-Boss!
-Boss!

751
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:22,796
Sit.

752
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:29,136
Please be our boss, boss!

753
00:56:30,304 --> 00:56:32,055
-What?
-We, Wild Dogs,

754
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:34,766
need someone powerful like you.

755
00:56:35,434 --> 00:56:36,476
With your…

756
00:56:39,605 --> 00:56:41,023
With your powers,

757
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,774
the whole nation… No.

758
00:56:42,858 --> 00:56:46,778
The whole world will fall into our hands!

759
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:51,408
-Is that right?
-Yes, sir!

760
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:52,492
Great!

761
00:56:52,576 --> 00:56:53,452
Then…

762
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:54,494
Let's go.

763
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:58,540
-Boss?
-Boss!

764
00:56:58,624 --> 00:57:00,375
Don't follow me, or else…

765
00:57:00,459 --> 00:57:02,586
Do you know what this can do?

766
00:57:03,337 --> 00:57:05,088
Don't follow me.

767
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:11,887
Seriously, didn't I tell you
not to follow me?

768
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:13,639
-They say, none but the brave
-Don't follow me!

769
00:57:13,722 --> 00:57:16,558
-deserve a true boss.
-Go away!

770
00:57:16,642 --> 00:57:17,851
I…

771
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:18,894
Okay?

772
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:25,484
Boss…

773
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,706
Because I use a demon as my bodyguard.

774
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:40,624
"Use"?

775
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:42,793
You use me as a charger as well.

776
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:44,252
That's true.

777
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:47,673
So what's written in that book?

778
00:57:47,756 --> 00:57:49,966
The etymology behind the name "demon,"
their powers and usage,

779
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:50,926
limitations, and--

780
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:18,078
ENFORCER, ABRAXAS

781
00:58:19,997 --> 00:58:22,040
Let's get rid of the obstacle first.

782
00:58:24,126 --> 00:58:25,293
Didn't you read the book?

783
00:58:25,377 --> 00:58:28,547
He's not human. He's a monster.

784
00:58:33,802 --> 00:58:37,514
No, he was human
until Do Do-hee showed up.

785
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:41,643
He can't kill you, but you can kill him.

786
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:48,567
Once you kill him, you'll be the devil.

787
00:59:27,606 --> 00:59:28,648
See you later.

788
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,401
When will you be back?

789
00:59:34,154 --> 00:59:36,990
I'm just worried
you'll run away from home again.

790
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:41,536
I won't be long.

791
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:48,001
I'll need to charge up as soon as I can.

792
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:34,131
I'd like to thank all the reporters
who came to grace today's performance.

793
01:00:34,673 --> 01:00:38,218
Our star of the night
just got back from her Europe tour.

794
01:00:39,845 --> 01:00:42,389
This isn't the circus, for heaven's sake.

795
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:43,640
The youngest to hold the title

796
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:45,809
of Intangible Cultural Heritage
of Pyeongannam-do's Towel Dance.

797
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:48,395
The Beyoncé of Korean traditional dance!

798
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:52,190
Jin Ga-young!

799
01:01:22,596 --> 01:01:24,055
What brings you here, Detec…

800
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:31,188
You're under arrest
for the murder of Chairwoman Ju Cheon-suk.

801
01:01:33,273 --> 01:01:34,107
Excuse me?

802
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:37,485
You have the right to remain silent
and the right to an attorney.

803
01:01:38,153 --> 01:01:41,198
Anything you say
can be used against you in court.

804
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:54,044
Hey, you should let it go.

805
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:56,546
Just blame your fate.

806
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:02,010
Who's blaming fate?
You should be blaming yourself.

807
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:07,098
No one can stop the roulette wheel
that has begun spinning.

808
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:11,811
All that's left for you are choices.

809
01:02:14,773 --> 01:02:19,778
Seocho police have arrested Do Do-hee,
CEO of Mirae F&amp;B, for murder.

810
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:23,365
CEO Do is suspected of murdering
Chairwoman Ju Cheon-suk of Mirae Group…

811
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:26,409
It's not over yet, is it?

812
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:29,120
Actually,

813
01:02:29,955 --> 01:02:31,122
it's all over now.

814
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:40,966
They can't detain you
for more than 48 hours without evidence.

815
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:44,094
So hang in there a bit longer.

816
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:47,931
Suk-min must know
that there's no evidence.

817
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:49,641
So why is he taking things so far?

818
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:52,185
All they want

819
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:56,189
is a headline that says
I was arrested on criminal charges.

820
01:02:57,524 --> 01:02:58,900
Public criticism

821
01:02:58,984 --> 01:03:01,403
will give them an excuse
to deny my candidacy.

822
01:03:04,072 --> 01:03:04,990
Don't worry.

823
01:03:05,824 --> 01:03:07,075
Everything will work out.

824
01:03:10,996 --> 01:03:12,455
It'll be fine.

825
01:03:26,386 --> 01:03:27,804
Beginning the monster hunt.

826
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:48,158
MS. SHIN

827
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:52,203
Ms. Do has been arrested.

828
01:03:58,585 --> 01:04:00,920
SUNWOL FOUNDATION

829
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:08,762
I'm sorry.

830
01:04:15,477 --> 01:04:17,312
It hurts, doesn't it?

831
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:34,681
Do Do-hee.

832
01:06:08,673 --> 01:06:09,799
Do Do-hee.

833
01:07:15,490 --> 01:07:16,824
Please let me go see him.

834
01:07:16,908 --> 01:07:17,992
He got stabbed!

835
01:07:18,076 --> 01:07:18,910
It's too late.

836
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:20,370
I was too late.

837
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:22,330
You killed Director Jeong!

838
01:07:22,413 --> 01:07:23,998
All of this happened because of you.

839
01:07:24,082 --> 01:07:25,792
Just how selfish are you going to be?

840
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,627
Stop taking advantage of Director Jeong
and let him go.

841
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:28,753
I have something to announce.

842
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:31,464
To prevent any further
conflicts and disputes,

843
01:07:31,548 --> 01:07:33,383
I hereby withdraw my candidacy.

844
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:34,717
He might not make it through the night.

845
01:07:34,801 --> 01:07:36,094
Hang in there.

846
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:37,178
Just a little longer.

847
01:07:41,808 --> 01:07:46,813
