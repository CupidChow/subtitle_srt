00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:51,051
FINANCIAL CHIEF MANAGER OF CONGLOMERATE
MR. CHA FOUND HANGING IN PUBLIC BATHROOM

2
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,806
Jeong Gu-won?

3
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,401
You have something precious to me.

4
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,738
I want you to be more responsible.

5
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:00,829
Acid?

6
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:02,456
Are you…

7
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,515
So I wasn't seeing things the other day.

8
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,102
What…

9
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:26,563
are you?

10
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:30,192
I'm…

11
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:32,903
a demon.

12
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,115
You humans call me…

13
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:40,077
the devil.

14
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:05,185
EPISODE 3
JOINING HANDS WITH A DEMON

15
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:17,114
We analyzed the liquid on the ground,

16
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:21,118
and it turned out to be sulfuric acid.

17
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,621
Had it splashed directly onto your face
in that concentration and amount,

18
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,498
it would've melted it
and could've been fatal.

19
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:31,336
It's highly likely
that they're targeting you.

20
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,255
Is there anyone you suspect?

21
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,759
I'm Cha Tae-jun,
the head of Mirae Group's financial team.

22
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:41,763
I'm reaching out to share
an important piece of information.

23
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:44,683
Does anything come to mind?

24
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:46,268
No.

25
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:49,730
I can't think of anyone
who would resent me enough to do this.

26
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:02,033
Humans are so insignificant.

27
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,745
Come in.

28
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:06,955
Move along.

29
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,373
Line up here.

30
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:09,499
Hurry up!

31
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,211
Do gambling houses
let homeless people in these days?

32
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:14,755
Business is slow for them.

33
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,382
Where do you think you're going?

34
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:20,177
Let go! You can't do this to a lady!

35
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,345
I'll question you first
since you're in such a hurry.

36
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:23,847
Go sit down, all of you.

37
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:25,724
Sit down.

38
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,392
What's your resident ID number?

39
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,229
Drink this while you wait, sir.

40
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:33,273
I don't drink rubbish like this.

41
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,609
You and your attitude.

42
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,444
Did you live abroad or something?

43
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,071
Don't get me wrong. I'm older than I look.

44
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:43,325
I see. Okay, sure.

45
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,452
BACKGROUND CHECK

46
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,454
Her name actually means "lady."

47
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,039
NAME: NOH SUK-NYEO
ADDRESS: UNCLEAR

48
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,130
What's taking Do Do-hee so long?

49
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,550
What the hell?

50
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,719
The wonderful aroma of Arabica.

51
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,067
You're hanging by a thread now.

52
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,570
You might actually die.

53
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,614
And in a very…

54
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:25,408
insignificant way at that.

55
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,794
Why are there so many
crazy humans these days?

56
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:36,837
Are you finished?

57
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,089
You've been waiting for her?

58
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,882
It must be reassuring to have him.

59
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,427
Please keep me updated
on the investigation.

60
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,096
I will. Have a safe trip home.

61
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,065
Don't you think

62
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:59,442
the two of them will get married?

63
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:00,902
I highly doubt it.

64
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,656
The roulette wheel's finally spinning.

65
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:05,615
-The roulette?
-Yes.

66
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,580
I'm betting everything on an odd number.

67
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,964
Is it that hard to keep yourself safe?

68
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,341
What if I had been even a second late?

69
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:26,052
My precious tattoo would have burned away.

70
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,763
So you're saying that you're a demon?

71
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,183
So you're the devil.
Why call yourself a demon?

72
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:33,768
What are you, a Pokémon?

73
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:34,769
A Poké…

74
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,189
Listen carefully.

75
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:42,235
A demon is an extremely noble being
whose goal is to make deals with humans.

76
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,904
What kind of deals?

77
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:48,241
Simply put, I grant humans' wishes.

78
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:52,078
-Like a genie in a bottle?
-Don't you compare me to that beefy Smurf.

79
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:56,041
You've seen what I can do.
If I wasn't a demon, what would else I be?

80
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,251
We normally call the likes of you
superhumans.

81
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,587
Forget it. Think whatever you want.

82
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,381
-Then you are a genie--
-Except for that.

83
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:04,799
To be honest,

84
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:07,636
I don't care
whether you're a devil or an angel.

85
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:10,597
-You don't believe me.
-That's not the point.

86
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,266
The point is that you possess
amazing powers

87
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,810
and that I have your tattoo,
the source of them all.

88
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:17,479
So you don't believe me.

89
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,065
No, I don't.

90
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,608
I knew it.

91
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,069
You humans are always so doubtful.

92
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:27,113
I was wondering
why you were so obsessed with the tattoo.

93
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,957
Things must've been pretty rough for you.

94
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,834
You need to stay close to me
to use your powers,

95
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,503
but you have no excuse to do that.

96
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,463
You're not my ex, much less my boyfriend.

97
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,632
What you need right now

98
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,259
seems to be a title
that would let you stay close to me.

99
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:50,470
-Am I wrong?
-What are you trying to say?

100
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:54,057
We share the same fate.

101
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,892
That's what I'm trying to say.

102
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:57,769
The same fate?

103
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,729
We're in the same boat now.

104
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,731
And there's a way
for both of us to get what we want.

105
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:02,774
Which is?

106
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,027
You're going to be my bodyguard.

107
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:07,821
Bodyguard? What do you mean?

108
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,740
Let me break it down for you.

109
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,826
A bodyguard is someone
who protects their client from--

110
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,495
I know what a bodyguard does.

111
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,830
I'm a demon.

112
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,541
Are you telling me to protect
some insignificant human?

113
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,251
You could tell yourself

114
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,753
that you're protecting
your precious tattoo instead.

115
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,672
-No.
-If protecting's not your thing,

116
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,215
think of it as fighting the bad guys.

117
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,259
You want me to fight on your behalf?

118
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,386
Do you actually think I'm a Pokémon?

119
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,805
You'd be in trouble if I died, no?

120
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:36,099
What would happen to your tattoo
if I died?

121
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,020
As you know,

122
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:42,897
I'm in danger right now.

123
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,775
I don't know who's after me or why,

124
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,610
but someone's out to kill me.

125
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,947
You need your tattoo,

126
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,824
and I need your powers.

127
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:55,785
This is the only way
for both of us to get what we want.

128
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:56,786
Don't you agree?

129
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,810
-So will you be my bodyguard?
-My answer is a firm no.

130
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,689
Then what do you suggest?
Do you have a better idea?

131
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,027
I don't know,
but I won't be your bodyguard.

132
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,826
-Where are you going?
-The creep might try his luck again.

133
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,203
I'll walk you to your door.

134
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,789
That's exactly what a bodyguard does.
There's not much to it.

135
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:43,291
I said I'll never be your bodyguard.

136
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:46,503
Get in front of me. I'll watch your back.

137
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,214
How's the security here?

138
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:51,966
Do you not hear yourself?

139
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,852
SUNWOL FOUNDATION

140
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,318
I'm incredible as…

141
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,612
Oops, my bad.

142
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,282
Maybe not.

143
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:02,745
To think my amazing powers

144
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:06,291
depend on the wrist of such
an insignificant and weak human being.

145
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:08,835
What if he breaks into her place?

146
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,837
If she dies and I lose my powers for good,

147
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,006
how am I to make deals?

148
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,341
Just be her bodyguard
if you're so worried.

149
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:16,718
Don't be ridiculous.

150
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,887
How can a demon become a bodyguard?

151
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,722
Demons used to be bodyguards.

152
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,849
What nonsense is that?

153
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,977
"Demons originally existed among humans

154
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,688
and protected them as their guardians."

155
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,231
Guardians are basically bodyguards.

156
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:32,442
I don't want to be either.

157
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,652
I'm cut out to be a demon.

158
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,572
How did you get this out anyway?

159
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,658
I was tidying up your desk.

160
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:42,076
By the way,

161
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,455
what if Do Do-hee runs her mouth
about your identity?

162
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,665
She doesn't even believe I'm a demon.

163
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,752
And you know how humans are.

164
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:58,968
I saw the devil.

165
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,387
-Oh, my.
-Dear Lord.

166
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,975
What did the devil look like?

167
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,687
The devil showed up in front of me

168
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:13,942
as the man of my dreams
in order to tempt my soul.

169
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:18,488
A chiseled and well-proportioned nose.

170
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,949
Skin as smooth as porcelain.

171
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,576
Sexy yet innocent lips.

172
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:25,244
Most importantly,

173
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:27,205
he had this melancholy look in his eyes.

174
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,999
Even his voice was like music to my ears.

175
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,168
I ended up

176
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:36,464
falling in love with the devil.

177
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,772
No one will believe I exist,

178
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,816
and they will soon forget

179
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,318
ever hearing about me.

180
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:58,736
You're right.

181
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:02,407
I got flogged big time in my past life
for saying I'd seen an evil spirit.

182
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,201
My butt still aches when it rains.

183
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:08,287
You're exaggerating.
That wasn't even in this life.

184
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:12,333
Anyway, would your powers
really disappear if Do Do-hee died?

185
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,460
I have no idea. That's why I'm so anxious.

186
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:15,878
Something bad might happen.

187
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:19,966
This damn manual is full of threats
and has no useful information.

188
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,176
I should just throw it away and…

189
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:25,471
No, I shouldn't.

190
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:26,806
So you admit it's a manual?

191
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:33,146
All I want is to have
my peaceful and comfortable life back.

192
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,356
I just want to live eternally

193
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,900
as an apex predator
who never ages or dies.

194
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,153
Is that too much to ask?

195
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,073
-You're not hiding it?
-You'll find it anyway.

196
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,826
I quite liked the challenge.

197
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:56,878
Seriously…

198
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,425
Be my bodyguard.

199
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,093
How persistent.

200
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,512
Or should I go laser off this tattoo?

201
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:08,681
Is she threatening a demon right now?

202
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,433
Appointment booked.

203
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,101
Treatment begins in five, four,

204
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,311
three, two, one.

205
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,980
-Tattoo covered with Pororo.
-That nutjob!

206
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,528
DO-HEE THE NUTJOB

207
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:27,867
PHOTO SENT

208
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,160
He's not taking the bait.

209
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:55,019
He saved me again.

210
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:59,690
Just like last time.

211
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,946
Mr. Cha, the Mirae Group head of finance,
who was accused of embezzlement,

212
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,031
was found dead this afternoon.

213
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:10,993
A passerby found his body
in a public restroom near his house

214
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,703
around 2 p.m. and made a report.

215
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,751
MY DELICATE BLOSSOM

216
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,675
Why are you being so clingy?
You saw me just the other day.

217
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,302
I know you're happy because I called.

218
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:29,971
Did you call to nag me again?

219
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,848
That's not why I called.

220
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:36,144
Is everything okay
at your company these days?

221
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:37,228
My company?

222
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:38,646
Why?

223
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:43,943
I saw on the news
that your head of finance killed himself.

224
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:49,240
The thing is, he called me yesterday

225
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:51,409
and said he had important intel.

226
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:56,831
I disregarded it,
assuming he was after some money.

227
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,541
But now that he killed himself,

228
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,043
something doesn't feel right.

229
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,798
Shouldn't you be worrying
about your own company?

230
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:07,300
This is nothing,

231
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,385
so stop being nosy
and focus on your company.

232
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:22,607
Ms. Yoon.

233
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:26,152
Bring me every news article
about the deceased head of finance

234
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,279
and the financial statements
for the last decade,

235
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:31,282
be it for headquarters or the affiliates.

236
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,270
I've been blind all this time.

237
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,070
Good morning, Director Jeong.

238
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,821
Come on in.

239
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:14,200
You seem to be in a good mood today.

240
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:19,163
I just realized
the situation might not be too bad.

241
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:22,500
It's not like my tattoo is gone.
It's safe on that woman's wrist.

242
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:25,795
You're one positive man.

243
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,965
I also realized
I couldn't get my tattoo back

244
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,050
-just by jumping into the water.
-Then?

245
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:34,136
The conditions would have to be
the same as when I lost it.

246
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,763
What conditions?

247
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,765
Location, temperature, weather, and so on.

248
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:41,435
If the same conditions are met,
I'm sure I'll get my tattoo back.

249
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:43,521
That makes sense.

250
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,569
Do you smell something burning?

251
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:53,572
I roasted the coffee beans
to perfection today.

252
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:54,490
That's not it.

253
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:58,286
This is the smell of burning meat,
not of plants.

254
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,206
You're right.

255
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,333
It smells like when you grill steak.

256
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:06,961
I'm also feeling some heat.

257
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:12,842
-Mr. Park.
-Yes?

258
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:13,759
What the…

259
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:17,263
-Is this the spontaneous combustion?
-Just like that?

260
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,021
Have you recovered your tattoo…

261
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,648
What's going on here?

262
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:30,192
You told her everything? Why would you…

263
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:33,696
My life was at risk.

264
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,573
I had to confess.

265
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:37,408
Help us out over here!

266
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:41,746
It's getting worse!

267
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:44,332
Is the oxygen fueling the flames?

268
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:46,667
Cut out that scientific gibberish!

269
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:49,378
It's so damn hot!

270
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:50,379
It's hot!

271
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,302
What just happened?

272
00:18:56,927 --> 00:19:00,097
The spontaneous combustion has begun.

273
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,684
No, this is not okay.

274
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:12,360
I just fell asleep.

275
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,613
Who's calling this early?

276
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,994
GU-WON THE SAVIOR

277
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,166
You'll be my bodyguard?

278
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,210
-She picked up.
-Be quiet. I can't hear.

279
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,836
Where are you? Are you home?

280
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:32,463
I am.

281
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,465
I need to see you. I'll come right over.

282
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,097
What's your plan?

283
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,224
I need to make a deal.

284
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,645
Put it all in! I need to go now!

285
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:50,689
Right now?

286
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:54,777
My goodness.

287
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,085
You can't just show up like this.

288
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,420
I haven't even washed up.

289
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:13,421
I'll be your bodyguard.

290
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,673
Really?

291
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:17,550
Good, you made the right…

292
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,261
Hold on. What changed your mind?

293
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:23,139
You were so against it yesterday.

294
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,391
I thought about it all night,

295
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,601
and it suddenly hit me.

296
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:29,812
Even insignificant things
deserve protection.

297
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:33,315
Humans even protect
insignificant and worthless insects

298
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:34,650
like longhorn beetles.

299
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:37,611
Are you comparing me to a longhorn beetle?

300
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:39,280
Both deserve to be protected.

301
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:41,282
Something's fishy.

302
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,743
There must be a reason
why you changed your mind.

303
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,911
You hated the idea yesterday.

304
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:47,121
What made you…
305

305
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:50,100
-What are you doing?
-What?

306
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,419
Very suspicious.

307
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,463
You must be hiding…

308
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:57,882
Focus, Do Do-hee.

309
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,758
We share the same fate, remember?

310
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:02,595
Always keep in mind
that we're in the same boat.

311
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,184
You're right.

312
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:11,228
Sure, be my bodyguard.

313
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:14,273
Can you start today?

314
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,357
Before that,

315
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,776
I need you to come with me first.

316
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:26,035
This place…

317
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,455
It's too high!

318
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,918
Why did you bring me here?

319
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,297
This is the best place
to spot humans for a deal.

320
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:42,176
I don't do well with heights!

321
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,892
Oh, come on!

322
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:53,521
Found one! Let's go!

323
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,360
This way.

324
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:06,033
Let me take some.

325
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:10,120
Can you hold this?

326
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:14,875
Additional chemotherapy
would be meaningless.

327
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,586
Still…

328
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:20,256
Is there anything we can try?

329
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,382
I'm sorry.

330
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:22,675
Over there.

331
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:25,844
I won't even ask you to let her live.

332
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:31,600
I just want Yeon-seo to stop suffering.

333
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:34,311
Even if it's just for one day.

334
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:38,899
That's all I wish for.

335
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:41,735
I'll grant your wish.

336
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,364
Who are you?

337
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:47,241
I'm a demon.

338
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:49,493
In other words, you just hit the jackpot.

339
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,079
What?

340
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:54,957
If you sign a deal with me,
your kid will be healthy for ten years.

341
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:59,545
I don't know who you are,
but you can't just barge in here…

342
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:02,798
Yeon-seo!

343
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,425
Oh no!

344
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,468
-We're both short on time, so here it is.
-Yeon-seo…

345
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:24,153
How did you…

346
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,873
The terms are simple.

347
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,666
You're going to hell after ten years.

348
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:39,710
If I do,

349
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:42,463
can Yeon-seo really live?

350
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:45,049
Make up your mind
before I go find another person.

351
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,301
Wait, you're pushing her too--

352
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:48,385
Stay out of this.

353
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:50,804
Give her time to think.
It's a difficult decision.

354
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:51,930
There's no time!

355
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:53,891
Time?

356
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:02,358
So you're doing this because…

357
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:03,359
I'll sign it.

358
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:08,739
I would go to worse places than hell

359
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:12,117
if it would stop Yeon-seo's suffering.

360
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:26,757
That was close.

361
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,844
Does the spontaneous combustion speed up
the more I use my powers?

362
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:38,811
Do you know any nice cake places?

363
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,270
It's your industry, after all.

364
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,190
Cake?

365
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:46,485
I always celebrate a new deal
with dessert.

366
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,320
What happens after you burst into flames?

367
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:51,115
I'd burn away.

368
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:55,577
You mean you'll die?

369
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,079
Kind of.

370
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:00,249
I'll cease to exist for good,
which is more cruel than death.

371
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,042
So that's why you make deals.

372
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:04,211
To stop yourself from burning away.

373
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:06,463
And you even celebrate by eating cake.

374
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,383
You really are the devil, aren't you?

375
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,344
Nothing's free in this world.

376
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,848
I get to live eternally
in return for granting human wishes.

377
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:18,308
I'd say that calls for a celebration.

378
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:20,185
You're exploiting people's misfortune.

379
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:22,938
Is that wrong?
You want to do that to me too.

380
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,065
Each and every moment of your life

381
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:27,568
is built on the desperation
and misfortune of others.

382
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:28,777
Doesn't that bother you?

383
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:31,405
I don't know why you're so upset,

384
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:33,073
but I save people.

385
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:35,743
Didn't you see the child dying in pain?

386
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,705
Will she ever be happy again
after finding out that she survived

387
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,832
at the expense of her loved one?

388
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,334
You wouldn't be able to understand,

389
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:46,420
but humans
can feel this thing called guilt.

390
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:49,798
Humans tend to romanticize
unnecessary and inefficient emotions

391
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:52,384
as part of being human.

392
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,606
Let's head to the office.

393
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:07,441
No.

394
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:08,984
I'm not going to use you

395
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,278
lest I end up
exploiting others' misfortunes.

396
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,578
You can afford to say that now.

397
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:21,663
But once your life is at risk,

398
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:23,540
you'll end up relying on my powers.

399
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:27,628
By nature, humans surpass demons

400
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,339
when it comes to selfishness.

401
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:41,642
You killed someone
on top of all your dirty tricks?

402
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,770
You'll have to pay

403
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,480
for what you've done.

404
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,098
That's what I'm talking about.

405
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:29,940
Director Jeong! How are your fingers?

406
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,233
I made a deal,

407
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:32,818
and my fingers are fine.

408
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,069
Don't talk to me.

409
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:38,198
I was worried sick,
thinking I'd never see you again.

410
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,951
What do you take me for?

411
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:44,913
I got restless after you stormed out,

412
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:47,082
so I looked into the day
you lost your tattoo.

413
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,084
-And?
-Listen to this.

414
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:53,964
Assuming that you fell into the sea
around 30 minutes after midnight,

415
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:57,092
the temperature of the seawater
in that area was 15.8°C.

416
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:01,346
And here comes the most important part.

417
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,514
That night,

418
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:07,060
there was a full moon.

419
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:13,400
How often does that occur?

420
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:14,568
Every 29.5 days.

421
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:17,195
Since it's been 1.5 days…

422
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,447
Just 28 days to go.

423
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,823
Another 28 days?

424
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,243
That's too long.

425
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:25,621
But aren't you Do Do-hee's bodyguard now?

426
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:27,873
Oh, that.

427
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,708
-I got fired.
-Already?

428
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:32,210
She doesn't want my help anymore.

429
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:34,421
Did you two fight or something?

430
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:38,258
-Humans are just too greedy!
-What?

431
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:40,844
Why would they pray
if they don't want to pay the price?

432
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:42,638
I can't hear a word you're saying.

433
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:45,474
It's like they pester me
to do wonders for free.

434
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,479
Now that I've literally put out that fire,

435
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:53,482
the tables have turned.

436
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,526
What exactly did she say?

437
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:57,694
Whatever.

438
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:59,696
I don't care what she says anymore.

439
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:07,454
In response
to the recent sugar juice scandal,

440
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:11,875
the PR team suggests
focusing on health-oriented new products.

441
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:16,213
Ma'am?

442
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:19,341
Ms. Do.

443
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:23,887
Please go on.

444
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:26,556
The healthy image of our new products

445
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,310
will replace all the negativity
from the sugar juice scandal.

446
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:31,853
"Be on the defense…"

447
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,148
I mean, "Be on the offense."

448
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:38,402
Your words inspired us.

449
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,171
I brought what you asked for.

450
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,970
Also, I'll get your bodyguards in order
as soon as possible.

451
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:15,939
Will she ever be happy again
after finding out that she survived

452
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:17,691
at the expense of her loved one?

453
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,360
You wouldn't be able to understand,

454
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:22,279
but humans
can feel this thing called guilt.

455
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:27,367
Is something bothering you?

456
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:29,745
Not at all. Why would I be bothered?

457
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:41,006
SEOUL HANSE MEDICAL CENTER

458
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,640
Oh no.

459
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:52,893
I'm sorry, sir.

460
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,854
Tell him you're sorry, Yeon-seo.

461
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,564
I'm sorry.

462
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:01,693
So your name's Yeon-seo?

463
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:03,987
Do you have a wish?

464
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,406
Her wish is about to come true.

465
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:09,785
She wanted to spend
her tenth birthday out of the hospital.

466
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:12,120
Is that your wish?

467
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:13,747
Spending your birthday
out of the hospital?

468
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:17,793
No? Then what is it?

469
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:25,884
I hope my parents
won't have to suffer because of me.

470
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,636
That's my wish.

471
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:35,393
Yeon-seo.

472
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:37,187
Honey.

473
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,480
Mommy!

474
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:41,274
-Don't run, you'll trip.
-Don't run, Yeon-seo.

475
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:43,276
My goodness.

476
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,740
I told you not to run.

477
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:56,790
Humans.

478
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,168
They're ever so difficult.

479
00:32:16,143 --> 00:32:17,477
The cake's here.

480
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,479
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

481
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:21,982
-How many candles are there?
-Ten.

482
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,024
-Ten.
-Ten.

483
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:24,443
You're turning ten, Yeon-seo.

484
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:28,321
You love flowers, don't you?

485
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,243
-Let's sing.
-Okay.

486
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,495
Here we go.

487
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:38,373
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

488
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:41,168
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

489
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:44,504
-Happy birthday, dear Yeon-seo
-Happy birthday, dear Yeon-seo

490
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:47,466
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

491
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:01,479
I would go to worse places than hell…

492
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,150
if it would stop Yeon-seo's suffering.

493
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:29,299
We're here, ma'am.

494
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:45,083
Hey.

495
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,254
I mean, ma'am.

496
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,464
Do you have any weapons? Maybe a handgun?

497
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:56,595
MARTIAL ARTS FOR BODYGUARDS

498
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,061
I guess…

499
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:08,523
I don't exactly need one,
being a weapon myself.

500
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,869
UNDERSTANDING SECURITY EQUIPMENT

501
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,873
Mr. Han.

502
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:27,792
What's with the sudden bodyguard?

503
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:33,757
Ms. Do will be taking center stage
in our new product promotion.

504
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,426
She must be preparing
for her eventual fame.

505
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:40,221
She's really a step ahead of everyone,
isn't she?

506
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:46,311
By the way, don't you think

507
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,855
the bodyguard is
unnecessarily good-looking?

508
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:51,816
What do you mean, "unnecessarily"?

509
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,277
Talk about workplace benefits.

510
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:58,114
Since he's a bodyguard,

511
00:35:58,198 --> 00:35:59,866
he must be a really good fighter.

512
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:01,201
Is he perfect or what?

513
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:04,287
But I bet he has a weakness.

514
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,123
-He has to.
-That's right.

515
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:08,375
-For example…
-For example?

516
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:11,544
He could be bad in bed.

517
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:13,463
Why is that a weakness?

518
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:15,256
How does that qualify as a fault?

519
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,675
That's perfectly fine!

520
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:19,803
It could happen to anyone.

521
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:23,098
Why would that ever be a problem?

522
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:25,183
I didn't want to know.

523
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:39,739
Being a bodyguard is pretty easy.

524
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:43,284
Were you expecting some kind of drama?

525
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:44,953
As if.

526
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:48,123
Why did you come back?

527
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,041
You didn't want to be my bodyguard.

528
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:52,001
Just because.

529
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:55,255
My life was so peaceful and perfect
that it was almost boring.

530
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:57,257
I thought I could use some trouble.

531
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,635
What changed your mind though?

532
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:01,928
You didn't want my powers.

533
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:04,472
Just because.

534
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:08,601
It takes one scumbag to deal with another.

535
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,237
How did you end up a demon?

536
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,905
Were you born one?

537
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:22,782
Is it a family business

538
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:24,742
like a generations-old restaurant?

539
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:27,495
Comparing demons to restaurants? I truly…

540
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,123
have no words.

541
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:33,001
How old are you? When were you born?

542
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,753
I've lived for 200 years as a demon.

543
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:40,091
You really don't look your age.

544
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,762
Anyway, does that mean
that there was a time

545
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:45,305
you weren't a demon?

546
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,724
-I used to be human.
-Really?

547
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:51,769
Of course, I was on a different level
from all those other insignificant humans.

548
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:53,688
Although I don't remember it.

549
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:56,149
To me, it seems like self-hatred.

550
00:37:56,232 --> 00:38:00,278
You consider humans insignificant
because you were too.

551
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:03,072
It's written in a book.

552
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:05,617
"God needed someone to work in hell,

553
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,286
so he hand-picked a human
to become a demon."

554
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:11,873
And I'm the human he chose.

555
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,708
Not because you were anything special

556
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:16,169
but because you fit the job description.

557
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,088
You're a jerk.

558
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:28,473
WORDS OF THE ALMIGHTY JU:
THIS IS IT FOR ME. I LOVE YOU, DO-HEE

559
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:29,682
What is it now?

560
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:30,767
ALMIGHTY JU

561
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:39,734
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached.

562
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:41,611
-Turn the car around.
-Please leave a message…

563
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:49,035
Madam Ju?

564
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:52,872
Why are you sitting on the ground?

565
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:54,749
It'll take a toll on your knee.

566
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:56,000
I can't believe you.

567
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:04,634
Madam Ju?

568
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,179
MISSED CALLS
MY DELICATE BLOSSOM

569
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,938
Madam Ju, are you okay?

570
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:23,987
Madam Ju?

571
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,488
This isn't funny.

572
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:27,657
What's going on?

573
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:33,413
Madam Ju, wake up.

574
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:35,623
Madam Ju.

575
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:37,876
You can't do this.

576
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,752
This is a prank, right?

577
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:42,755
You totally got me, so please wake up.

578
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:45,174
I'm here.

579
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:48,344
I'm right here. Please wake up.

580
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:51,931
That's enough.

581
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:56,269
Save her.

582
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,524
I can't bring the dead back to life.

583
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,403
Why not? I know you can!

584
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:07,071
Save her right now.

585
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,741
Please save her.

586
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:12,952
I'll sign a contract
or whatever you want me to, so please.

587
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:14,871
Please save her.

588
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,415
Just this once.

589
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:19,876
Madam Ju!

590
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,295
You can't do this.

591
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:24,631
Wake up!

592
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:28,968
Madam Ju!

593
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,932
Please save her.

594
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:31,990
It seems as if all the life
has been drained from Ms. Do overnight.

595
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:34,659
She must be in shock.

596
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,661
She was very close with the chairwoman.

597
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:40,915
Should we go comfort her?

598
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:44,168
Futile consolation attempts
will only hurt her further.

599
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:47,255
Try not to let your emotions show.

600
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,424
That's the best thing you can do for her.

601
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,028
She's been like that the whole time.

602
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:18,786
So it's you.

603
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:27,628
You're not even crying.

604
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:32,508
I don't deserve to cry.

605
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:38,556
They died because of me.

606
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:44,312
So what if it was my birthday?

607
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:48,357
I should never have rushed them.

608
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:56,949
Do you think you're God?

609
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:01,954
How can anyone die because of you?

610
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:07,251
You feel sorry for yourself
if you think like that, don't you?

611
00:43:08,795 --> 00:43:13,341
You're no better than a speck of dust
floating around.

612
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,802
A speck of dust

613
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:18,346
can't tip the scales.

614
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:48,960
There you go.

615
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:52,296
Good girl.

616
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:13,818
Mom. Dad.

617
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:18,114
I miss you.

618
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:25,454
Do-hee.

619
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:28,875
Do-hee.

620
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:33,421
I called your name many times,
but you didn't answer.

621
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:38,801
Madam Ju didn't like taking pictures.

622
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:41,262
She said they never did her justice.

623
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,472
I think this one looks good.

624
00:44:44,182 --> 00:44:45,850
But it's nothing like her.

625
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:50,563
That smile makes her look like
she's only a shell of herself.

626
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:55,776
Funeral portraits reflect how the bereaved
want to remember the deceased.

627
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:59,864
It still feels like
the whole thing is just a joke.

628
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:02,867
I feel like she'll show up any minute

629
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:04,952
and shout, "Surprise, you little brat!"

630
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,830
Then burst into laughter.

631
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:11,375
That would be much more like her.

632
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:14,003
She was such an eccentric person.

633
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,923
I thought her last moments
would also be special.

634
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:19,425
But a heart attack?

635
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:26,682
You just got here?

636
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:30,311
Yes, Aunt Cheon-suk had apparently ordered

637
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:32,605
an audit team to be formed
before she passed.

638
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:35,816
It was put on hold,
but I had to take care of some paperwork.

639
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,276
An audit team?

640
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:39,862
Who put it on hold?

641
00:45:39,946 --> 00:45:42,031
The board passed an emergency motion.

642
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:43,658
You didn't hear about it?

643
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:48,204
This is hardly the time for an audit.

644
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:50,498
Look at that.

645
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:53,626
Everyone's busy buttering Suk-min up.

646
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:55,920
Is this the Joseon Dynasty or what?

647
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,588
Being the eldest son means nothing.

648
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:00,091
Mom never liked Suk-min.

649
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:03,386
She even sent him to prison
for driving drunk.

650
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:05,888
I have a feeling

651
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:09,392
Mom would've made an unusual choice.
Don't you agree?

652
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:11,936
Right. She was unique indeed.

653
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:15,648
Seok-hoon, come over here for a second.

654
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:28,703
You two always seemed to have

655
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:31,455
a special bond.

656
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:35,876
Camaraderie between outsiders, is that it?

657
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,504
It's just that we
studied abroad together as students.

658
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:40,965
But don't fool yourself, Do-hee.

659
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:43,342
Seok-hoon has
a different background from you.

660
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:47,596
He comes from the Ju family,

661
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,850
while you come from a vulgar family

662
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:54,562
who worked with machines
and other people's hair.

663
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:55,771
What's vulgar

664
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,399
is the way you think.

665
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:01,819
Is this the Joseon Dynasty or what?

666
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:04,989
You're still talking back to me?

667
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,242
My mom is no longer here
to take your side.

668
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:16,292
Stop drinking unless you want
everyone to see your true colors.

669
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:19,045
I can never get through funerals
without alcohol.

670
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:21,380
Everyone's wearing black.

671
00:47:21,464 --> 00:47:22,757
It's horrible.

672
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,509
I put up with even more horrible things

673
00:47:25,593 --> 00:47:27,344
while being sober.

674
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:31,432
Mom was always mean.

675
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:33,476
I guess that's why…

676
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:36,270
you two got along.

677
00:47:42,902 --> 00:47:44,779
Hello, Isabelle.

678
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,697
Hi, it's been a while.

679
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:49,617
I'm so glad to see you.

680
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,623
I heard a lot about you from Chairman Noh.

681
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:58,626
I see.

682
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,169
It's too early to call me that.

683
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,338
Congratulations, ma'am.

684
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:04,090
Please don't say that.

685
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:06,467
I'm afraid that's a bit inappropriate.

686
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:09,470
I think so too.

687
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:13,432
There are more and more
female CEOs as well.

688
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:15,142
You're right.

689
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:18,104
Austin!

690
00:48:18,187 --> 00:48:19,063
Justin!

691
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:25,945
-Austin!
-Boys will be boys.

692
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:30,241
Justin!

693
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,633
So this was a party, not a funeral?

694
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:36,974
CCTV CONTROL ROOM
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

695
00:50:31,654 --> 00:50:34,990
The seasons differ above and below ground.

696
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:37,493
Underground, spring starts around October.

697
00:50:38,327 --> 00:50:42,122
Even during the chilly winter
above ground,

698
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:45,626
buds are sprouting below the ground.

699
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:49,505
So tell yourself this
when things get tough.

700
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:53,133
"Spring is about to begin within me."

701
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:58,222
What's with this Mother Nature vibe?
It's not like you.

702
00:50:59,348 --> 00:51:00,683
I was having a moment there.

703
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:02,518
Just play along, you brat.

704
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:04,311
Pick a character and stick to it.

705
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:06,355
Are you Mother Nature or Sailor Mouth?

706
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:07,564
I'm Sailor Mouth, so what?

707
00:51:08,524 --> 00:51:10,442
Just put that in here.

708
00:51:10,526 --> 00:51:11,944
Gosh, the water's leaking!

709
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:14,363
-Hey, you just go away.
-What's wrong with this?

710
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:15,739
Go away!

711
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:20,577
-You can't sprinkle it like that!
-Okay, I get it!

712
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:40,848
I thought no one was here.

713
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:43,642
Want one?

714
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:46,895
Madam Ju hates the smell of cigarettes.

715
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:50,065
Grandma? But she's gone.

716
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,443
Everything belongs to my dad now,

717
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:54,153
and it'll all be mine soon.

718
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:56,989
I'd prefer the smell of cigarettes
over that of an old granny.

719
00:51:58,574 --> 00:52:00,659
I said Madam Ju hates
the smell of cigarettes.

720
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:04,997
I'll let it slide today.

721
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:06,623
Because today

722
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:08,917
is a happy day.

723
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:15,799
I can't let it slide.

724
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:26,060
So I wasn't the only one
who wanted to get out of there.

725
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:27,853
Can I join?

726
00:52:29,063 --> 00:52:30,022
Who are you?

727
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:33,776
I'm someone inseparable
from Ms. Do Do-hee here.

728
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:37,613
But don't get me wrong. I'm not her ex,

729
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:39,073
much less her boyfriend.

730
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:41,700
-Are you her bodyguard?
-No.

731
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:43,577
I just got off work.

732
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:44,703
Want a sip?

733
00:52:46,372 --> 00:52:48,290
You can't hide your upbringing.

734
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:49,917
You two are a perfect match.

735
00:52:56,215 --> 00:52:57,925
What the hell?

736
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:04,014
Want a sip?

737
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:13,399
Madam Ju

738
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:16,110
used to hole up here

739
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:19,446
whenever she was feeling down.

740
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:25,244
I never got that about her…

741
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:29,206
until now.

742
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:32,626
The greenhouse
didn't just protect her plants

743
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:35,337
but Madam Ju herself.

744
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:39,299
She was aware…

745
00:53:41,093 --> 00:53:43,637
that her children would rejoice

746
00:53:44,138 --> 00:53:45,681
at her death.

747
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:50,018
Her prediction came true.

748
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:53,397
That must've been
why she was always so mean.

749
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:56,859
She was lonely all her life

750
00:53:57,609 --> 00:53:59,820
to the very end.

751
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:05,492
It breaks my heart
that I never got to say goodbye to her.

752
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:14,626
Do you know
why people wear black to funerals?

753
00:54:17,296 --> 00:54:21,049
It's to prevent the soul of the deceased
from recognizing and following them.

754
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:24,136
That's why

755
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:26,930
they hide themselves in black clothing.

756
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:30,309
Then I'm wearing the wrong color today.

757
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:35,272
Madam Ju must be so lonely today too.

758
00:54:36,899 --> 00:54:39,735
She can't recognize anyone
at her own funeral.

759
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:01,673
She can recognize you now.

760
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:05,135
What's the point?

761
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:09,056
I wouldn't know
even if she came to see me.

762
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:10,933
Just give it a chance.

763
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:08,532
Thank you, Madam Ju,

764
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:11,243
for finding me.

765
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:15,664
Both 17 years ago and now.

766
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,086
Thanks to you,

767
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:25,340
I got to act like the devil's spawn
as much as I wanted.

768
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:39,229
If we ever get a second chance…

769
00:56:44,443 --> 00:56:45,527
let's…

770
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:50,574
fight even harder

771
00:56:52,284 --> 00:56:54,369
and love each other more dearly.

772
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:30,405
My goodness.
What are you, in a fashion show?

773
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:32,908
You just have to stand out, don't you?

774
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:35,535
Aren't we all here as the bereaved family?

775
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:38,413
Who gave her the right to be here?

776
00:57:38,497 --> 00:57:41,875
The detective has some information
for all of us.

777
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:44,294
What on earth could it be?

778
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:49,549
Good to see you all.

779
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:54,972
Sorry, that came out wrong.

780
00:57:55,055 --> 00:57:56,556
Whatever this is, make it quick.

781
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,142
It's rude of us
to leave our guests on their own.

782
00:57:59,226 --> 00:58:00,352
Of course, sir.

783
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:01,520
Detective Lee.

784
00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:08,527
There are just too many documents
to go through.

785
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:12,990
Did the deceased often take painkillers?

786
00:58:13,073 --> 00:58:15,450
Yes, she had a knee problem.

787
00:58:15,534 --> 00:58:17,953
The medicine she took
on the day of her death…

788
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:21,081
was diclofenac.

789
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:24,084
Hold on. That's not possible.

790
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:27,003
She never took that
because she was allergic.

791
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:30,632
But it's been confirmed
that it was diclofenac

792
00:58:30,716 --> 00:58:33,677
that she took on the day of her death.

793
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:37,556
I'm telling you this because
the label didn't match the contents.

794
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:40,267
Are you saying that Mother passed

795
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:43,019
due to medical negligence?

796
00:58:43,103 --> 00:58:45,772
We thought it was a simple heart attack.

797
00:58:45,856 --> 00:58:48,066
Didn't Director Choi prescribe her meds?

798
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:49,526
How could this happen?

799
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:53,321
We'll investigate all possibilities,
so let's not jump to any conclusions.

800
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:57,576
Mr. Cha and the audit team.

801
00:58:57,659 --> 00:59:00,037
All I can tell you right now

802
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:03,623
is that it has the power
to make you chairwoman of Mirae Group.

803
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:10,088
Perhaps Mr. Cha

804
00:59:10,589 --> 00:59:12,299
had proof of someone's wrongdoing.

805
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:16,386
And that person killed Madam Ju

806
00:59:17,596 --> 00:59:19,389
to stop her from digging it out.

807
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:22,976
Medical negligence doesn't sound good.

808
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:27,439
Especially since everyone's saying
Mirae Group is in crisis.

809
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:29,775
We'll only be giving them
something to gossip about.

810
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:32,819
Just thinking about what people will say

811
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,363
gives me a headache.

812
00:59:35,447 --> 00:59:38,533
Everyone will be busy making up stories.

813
00:59:38,617 --> 00:59:41,495
They think we chaebols
sold our souls to the devil or something.

814
00:59:42,204 --> 00:59:44,831
By how much did our stock prices drop?

815
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:46,500
We can't risk them dropping further.

816
00:59:47,334 --> 00:59:50,504
First, who knew about
the deceased's allergy

817
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:52,422
to diclofenac?

818
00:59:52,506 --> 00:59:53,507
Her doctor…

819
00:59:55,801 --> 00:59:57,636
as well as everyone here.

820
01:00:16,238 --> 01:00:17,948
Let's announce that it was a heart attack.

821
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:20,408
That's a good idea.

822
01:00:20,492 --> 01:00:23,912
We can't afford any rumors
right before succession.

823
01:00:23,995 --> 01:00:24,955
Then again,

824
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:28,750
it's not like Mom can come back to life
if we reveal the truth.

825
01:00:30,377 --> 01:00:32,838
I'll put in a word
with the commissioner general.

826
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:36,925
Be sure to keep this a secret.

827
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:42,597
Where's Attorney Jeong?

828
01:00:42,681 --> 01:00:44,099
He's waiting outside.

829
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:46,768
Is the will going to be read outside?

830
01:00:46,852 --> 01:00:48,854
We want to make it official.

831
01:00:49,437 --> 01:00:51,898
Sure, there's no point in waiting.

832
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,780
Detective Park.

833
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:23,430
Madam Ju was murdered.

834
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:29,603
It wasn't a heart attack
or medical negligence.

835
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:31,271
It was murder.

836
01:01:39,154 --> 01:01:40,697
I know why Madam Ju was killed

837
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:42,782
and why I might get killed.

838
01:01:42,866 --> 01:01:44,326
Are you drunk?

839
01:01:44,993 --> 01:01:47,454
Why are you making a scene?

840
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:49,831
Which of you did it?

841
01:01:50,332 --> 01:01:52,751
You? Or you?

842
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:54,836
Or…

843
01:01:56,004 --> 01:01:57,047
were you all in on it?

844
01:01:57,756 --> 01:01:58,882
Take her away.

845
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:05,430
Step back if you don't want to get hurt.

846
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:08,391
Do-hee, what's wrong?

847
01:02:08,475 --> 01:02:09,309
What's going on?

848
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:10,560
Let's get started.

849
01:02:10,644 --> 01:02:12,938
Ms. Do Do-hee's presence is required.

850
01:02:22,614 --> 01:02:25,992
Ms. Ju Cheon-suk
left a will detailing her assets,

851
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:30,830
including shares and convertible bonds,
with a suspensive condition.

852
01:02:30,914 --> 01:02:31,873
Condition?

853
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:34,918
Her will is as follows.

854
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:39,547
"I bequeath all real estate,
including the mansion in Hannam-dong,

855
01:02:39,631 --> 01:02:42,634
and cash to be donated
to Hansarang Welfare Foundation."

856
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:46,805
"I also bequeath Mirae Group's
management rights,

857
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:48,723
as well as all shares of its affiliates,

858
01:02:48,807 --> 01:02:50,809
to the designated legatee."

859
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:55,188
So who's the designated legatee?

860
01:02:55,689 --> 01:02:58,775
"The designated legatee
is Mirae F&B's CEO,

861
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:00,652
Do Do-hee."

862
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:09,494
What just happened?

863
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:12,289
As expected of her.

864
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:15,542
So this was a surprise party?

865
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:17,711
"The inheritance

866
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:21,256
is contingent upon Do Do-hee
registering her marriage within one year

867
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:24,134
following the passing
of the testator, Ju Cheon-suk."

868
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,264
"If this condition is not met,

869
01:03:29,347 --> 01:03:32,350
her share shall be bequeathed
to Hansarang Welfare Foundation."

870
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:34,519
Do Do-hee…

871
01:03:35,729 --> 01:03:37,022
will be our chairwoman?

872
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:40,316
The deceased also wrote letters
to her family members,

873
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,111
as this news would give you quite a shock.

874
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:48,992
Let me see.

875
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:51,202
I'm sure there's more.

876
01:03:51,286 --> 01:03:52,829
Mom wouldn't have done this to me.

877
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:57,375
"Money ruined you all."

878
01:03:57,459 --> 01:03:59,002
"Every man in your life is…"

879
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:00,962
Seriously?

880
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:03,173
What does it say?

881
01:04:07,218 --> 01:04:08,428
You don't want to know.

882
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:17,187
Madam Ju.

883
01:04:19,022 --> 01:04:20,273
What on earth is this?

884
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:24,944
She made this decision

885
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:27,155
after much contemplation.

886
01:04:32,202 --> 01:04:37,332
TO DO-HEE

887
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:44,464
You!

888
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:47,967
What did you do?

889
01:04:48,051 --> 01:04:49,677
What the hell did you do?

890
01:04:49,761 --> 01:04:52,222
Calm down. Pull yourself together!

891
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:54,474
You're not going to accept it, are you?

892
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:16,955
The only way to stop me

893
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:19,541
is to kill me.

894
01:05:23,294 --> 01:05:24,129
Do-hee.

895
01:05:26,506 --> 01:05:28,675
Wait and see, Madam Ju.

896
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:31,136
I promise to reveal the truth

897
01:05:31,219 --> 01:05:33,179
even if I have to join hands with a demon.

898
01:05:50,697 --> 01:05:51,906
Mr. Jeong Gu-won.

899
01:05:53,867 --> 01:05:55,410
Marry me.

900
01:07:08,149 --> 01:07:09,692
I think you should stay out of it.

901
01:07:09,776 --> 01:07:11,069
I need to find out who's behind it.

902
01:07:11,152 --> 01:07:12,654
To do that,
I'll need to form an audit team.

903
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:14,405
Ms. Do and Mr. Jeong.

904
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:17,825
The way they interact
hints at physical intimacy.

905
01:07:17,909 --> 01:07:19,869
I don't want you to go out alone
and get in trouble.

906
01:07:19,953 --> 01:07:21,454
So let me keep holding your wrist.

907
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:23,039
People already suspect
we're dating as it is.

908
01:07:23,122 --> 01:07:24,999
It's a beautiful day, Young Master Yi-sun.

909
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:25,959
Young Master!

910
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:27,460
My memories are starting to come back.

911
01:07:27,544 --> 01:07:30,338
There's nothing like
secretly holding hands

912
01:07:30,421 --> 01:07:31,881
under the table at team dinners.

913
01:07:31,965 --> 01:07:34,926
There's something so enjoyable
about secret physical touch.

914
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:36,010
I like Do Do-hee.

915
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:45,061
