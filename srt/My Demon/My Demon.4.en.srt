1
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,091
Mr. Jeong Gu-won.

2
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:52,636
Today, I'm making
the greatest bet of my life

3
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,513
on this man.

4
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:58,183
Marry me.

5
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,384
I don't want to.

6
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:41,768
Why not? Just marry her.

7
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,316
That was the worst bet ever.

8
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,407
Do-hee.

9
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,783
Don't say anything.

10
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:08,629
Why would you follow me out right now?

11
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:09,921
To protect you.

12
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:11,256
I'm your bodyguard.

13
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,470
I keep my work and personal life separate.

14
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:21,808
I must've been crazy.

15
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:52,089
EPISODE 4
SWEET BUT DANGEROUS

16
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,424
-I want to hold it!
-No!

17
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,802
-Let me hold it!
-I said no!

18
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,011
Ta-da.

19
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:14,820
She's unbelievable!

20
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,030
Did you see that?

21
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:20,534
She proposed to him
right in front of our eyes to rub it in!

22
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:29,876
I got stabbed in the back
by my own mother.

23
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:31,878
Let's take legal action.

24
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:33,922
There's no point.

25
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:36,299
-Why not?
-We both have already received

26
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:39,261
more than our statutory shares
from Mother.

27
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,055
We won't get another penny.

28
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,849
Okay, let me think.

29
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,601
What if we claimed
that Mom had Alzheimer's?

30
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:50,480
That her will is invalid
since she was mentally unfit.

31
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,816
Attorney Jeong assisted her.

32
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,152
It's already been legally reviewed.

33
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:57,654
Shit!

34
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:04,369
Austin! Justin!

35
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:06,830
Come here, you little brats!

36
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,750
What do we do now, honey?

37
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,140
12 YEARS AGO

38
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,433
Do it by the book.

39
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:30,103
He should pay for what he's done.

40
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,900
I made a mistake because I was drunk.

41
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,236
I didn't know it was a person!

42
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,156
Mother!

43
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,169
Mother…

44
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,881
is driving you into a corner again.

45
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,344
If this is what she wanted,

46
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:05,263
I'll follow suit.

47
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:42,676
I'm pretty chill,

48
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,637
which means I already got over it.

49
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,515
Then why are you sitting back there?

50
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,478
My seat was always here.

51
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,021
Then why did you--

52
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:58,942
You probably want to explain in detail
why you had to turn down my offer,

53
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,944
but I'm not interested.

54
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:04,322
-I wasn't going to explain--
-I haven't been sleeping well lately.

55
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,116
I wasn't in my right mind,

56
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,661
and it was a spur-of-the-moment thing
like sleep-talking.

57
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:14,082
Don't tell me you thought
I was being serious.

58
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,417
The proposal?

59
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,044
I wouldn't use such a grand term.

60
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:20,130
Then what else should I call a proposal?

61
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,506
An accident.

62
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,301
It would make a lot more sense
to call it a small accident.

63
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,678
It doesn't matter to me either way.

64
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:30,682
What doesn't matter to you?

65
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:32,350
Calling it an accident?

66
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:33,852
Or that I wasn't being serious?

67
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,228
Or the fact that I proposed…

68
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,110
The fact that I sleep-talked?

69
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:44,738
If I had to answer, all three of them.

70
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,288
Just put on some music.

71
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,667
Play some uplifting music.

72
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:02,297
Will I ever get married?

73
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,676
Will I ever get married?

74
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:08,928
Next song.

75
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,181
It's already the end of the year

76
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:16,144
I even thought about marrying you

77
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,938
-With our own house
-Next song.

78
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,023
With our own room

79
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:23,818
Will you marry me…

80
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:27,072
-Everyone's got marriage on their minds.
-I said I don't!

81
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,573
…the rest of your life with me

82
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,661
The two of us…

83
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,245
I want some peace and quiet.

84
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,247
You wanted music a minute ago.

85
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:37,832
Turn off the music, please.

86
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,143
I won't let what happened today
get in our business because I'm chill.

87
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,270
But you've been the very opposite…

88
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,402
TO DO-HEE

89
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:17,914
I don't feel hurt at all,
probably because I never meant it.

90
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,960
It's just that I happened to notice
Jeong Gu-won at that moment.

91
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,169
There's nothing more to…

92
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:26,214
I mean,

93
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,468
if you weren't going to marry me,
why did you hit on me?

94
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:33,013
Why did you keep showing up
in front of me?

95
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,852
Do that again,

96
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:43,231
and I'll drag you to our wedding
with a snare around your neck.

97
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:47,986
TO DO-HEE

98
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:54,075
No, a tranquilizer gun would be better

99
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,910
since he's not human.

100
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:57,245
The ones they use on elephants.

101
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,456
Right in the neck
with a dosage high enough

102
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,623
to knock out an elephant.

103
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:01,791
Bang.

104
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,754
I better stay out of her sight for now.

105
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,312
Jeong Gu-won?

106
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:36,785
I can't believe it.

107
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,163
They killed Aunt Cheon-suk over an audit?
And now they're after you?

108
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,873
I need to find out who's behind it.

109
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,333
To do that,

110
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,169
I'll need to become chairwoman
and form an audit team myself.

111
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,379
No, I think you should stay out of it.

112
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:49,964
You'll be in even more danger.

113
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:51,925
I'm already in danger anyway.

114
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,595
I can't be safe
until the culprit is caught.

115
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:56,888
Still, Do-hee…

116
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,183
It's my fault.

117
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:05,522
It feels like

118
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,566
all of this happened because of me.

119
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:13,988
Madam Ju was killed
while trying to leave her position to me.

120
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:18,409
And I was the one who warned her
that something was up.

121
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:19,953
You know that's not true.

122
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,373
This was going to happen eventually.

123
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,125
You should be blaming
the one who killed her.

124
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:27,794
That's why I need to find out

125
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,838
who did this.

126
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:39,973
Anyway…

127
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,601
The guy at the funeral…

128
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,688
He's the guy
you went on a blind date with, right?

129
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,857
Was his name Jeong Gu-won?

130
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:52,193
-Yes.
-I get that you were desperate,

131
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:55,905
but how could you think of marrying a guy
you went on one date with?

132
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,702
He's a bit more than that.

133
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,328
Do you have feelings for him?

134
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:04,205
It's not like that.

135
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:08,751
He saved me multiple times.

136
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,881
So that's why you hired him
as your bodyguard?

137
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,467
He's the one

138
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,804
who can keep me safe
better than anyone else.

139
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,359
You're back.

140
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,529
Why do you always hang out in my office?

141
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,657
Because your office is nicer than mine.

142
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:45,705
How was the food?

143
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,332
What do chaebols serve at funerals?

144
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:52,211
It wasn't a funeral, but a party.

145
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:54,964
A surprise party at that.

146
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:59,093
-What?
-Human greed knows no end.

147
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,596
Now that I'm her bodyguard,
she wants me to marry her.

148
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,182
-Who does?
-Who else? Do Do-hee.

149
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,018
She proposed to me today.

150
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,144
What?

151
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,228
Hold on.

152
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:12,440
So that movie was a true story?

153
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:13,691
What movie?

154
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,486
THE BODYGUARD

155
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,988
This is a movie
about a singer and her bodyguard.

156
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:23,076
They hate each other's guts at first,
but they fall in love.

157
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,452
We're not like that.

158
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:27,246
Do Do-hee said the proposal
was just her sleep-talking.

159
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,291
Humans tend to be more sincere
in situations like that.

160
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,542
In their sleep, while drunk…

161
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:34,629
That's when they let their guard down.

162
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,297
She said she wasn't being serious.

163
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:41,928
"Rule number one for bodyguards."

164
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,846
"Never let her out of your sight."

165
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,139
"Rule number two."

166
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:46,849
"Never stray far from her."

167
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:47,767
"Rule number three."

168
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:50,228
"Never…

169
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,607
fall in love with her."

170
00:12:57,151 --> 00:13:00,029
This is my favorite romance movie.

171
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,740
I should've become a bodyguard,
not a butler.

172
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:06,619
"No!"

173
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:09,580
That's nothing but human delusion.

174
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,874
What would you know
when you're clueless about love?

175
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,126
I'm not clueless.

176
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,044
I'm just not swayed
by something so stupid.

177
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,212
Love is a weakness.

178
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,630
Humans are already foolish,

179
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:20,133
and it only makes them even more foolish.

180
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:23,302
You're only like this
because you didn't get enough love.

181
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:25,138
You would've become
a guardian and not a demon

182
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,974
-if only you'd been loved.
-Enough with your talk about guardians.

183
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,894
Cut it out and get back to work.

184
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,354
Look at that tower of papers.

185
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:34,897
I finished my work a while ago.

186
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:37,900
Those are for you.

187
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:40,862
All of them?

188
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,449
My goodness.

189
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,869
You can't possibly sleep on the sofa.

190
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:48,786
I won't.

191
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:51,789
I'll keep watch all night,
so you can go to sleep.

192
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:53,166
I said I'm fine.

193
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:56,210
Do you think I'd get any sleep
if I left you alone right now?

194
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,755
I won't, so I'd rather keep watch.

195
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:03,051
You know I can't sleep
with another person under the same roof.

196
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:05,178
Then I'll be outside the door.

197
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:07,513
I was a Marine, remember?

198
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,017
I shouldn't have told you all that.

199
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,770
I'm not going to tell you
anything from now on.

200
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,355
Don't you dare do that.

201
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:17,774
What I'm saying is…

202
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:22,153
Do you think I'd get any sleep
knowing you're staying awake for me?

203
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:23,946
Right?

204
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:27,283
Fine.

205
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,201
Take it.

206
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:32,997
Here.

207
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,667
I'll get going, so sleep tight.

208
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:40,046
I'll go dig through some papers
since that's what I'm good at.

209
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:41,881
Thanks.

210
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:45,927
Thank me later
when you can finally sleep without worry.

211
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,305
Right. Give me your phone.

212
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,933
Why do you need my phone?

213
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:57,396
I'm going to add myself
as your emergency contact.

214
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,774
GUARDIAN

215
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,109
There.

216
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,445
Don't worry too much.

217
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:05,947
Security's tight here.

218
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,408
Don't keep things to yourself,

219
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:10,076
and don't try too hard to be okay.

220
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,954
You can't possibly be okay
after what you've been through.

221
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:15,039
I know I fall short,

222
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,376
but I'll do my best
to fill in for Aunt Cheon-suk.

223
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:23,464
You fall way too short.

224
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:28,594
You'd have to be way surlier
to fill in for Madam Ju.

225
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,184
Call me if anything happens.

226
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:36,519
I will.

227
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:38,938
One more thing.

228
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,774
What was that about an elephant earlier?

229
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:42,817
An elephant?

230
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,113
I have no idea.

231
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,907
-I clearly heard you talking about
-I'm so tired.

232
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:53,077
-knocking out an elephant or something.
-I'm going to bed. Get going.

233
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,745
-Thanks.
-Bye.

234
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:07,884
I'm all alone again

235
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:10,720
for the first time…

236
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,432
in 17 years.

237
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,399
Let's just get to the next step.

238
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,652
I should probably read
Madam Ju's letter first.

239
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,157
GROUP CHAT WITH LEE NU-RI,
PARK SEONG-HYEON, KIM SO-YEON…

240
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,241
What's this?

241
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:34,952
Nice pictures, Do-hee.

242
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:38,206
-Who's the guy?
-Who are you talking about? Show me.

243
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:39,916
A guy?

244
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,714
MIRAE HEIR TURNED DOWN
AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT

245
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:49,258
What the heck is this?

246
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,807
I can't believe I have to
manually sign every document.

247
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:58,643
With my powers gone,

248
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,062
life is such a drag.

249
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,234
What are you going to do about Do Do-hee?

250
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:07,485
I mean the proposal.

251
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,071
I'm not crazy enough to marry her
in addition to being her bodyguard.

252
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,869
For a demon, as an apex predator,
to marry an insignificant human

253
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,206
would be like a meat eater marrying a pig.

254
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,959
Is this how animals feel?

255
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,879
I'm sorry, pigs, chickens,
and the occasional cows.

256
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:28,339
There's no need for me
to get too involved.

257
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,884
All I have to do
is hold out until the next full moon

258
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:34,011
and go back to being my perfect self.

259
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,055
I'm finally done.

260
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,559
The man Do Do-hee proposed to.

261
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:41,602
It's you, isn't it?

262
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:42,895
MIRAE HEIR TURNED DOWN
AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT

263
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:45,940
Calm down and put your sword down first.

264
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,901
Is she a complete nutjob or what?

265
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:56,742
DO-HEE THE NUTJOB

266
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:59,245
And she has great timing.

267
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,333
I need to see you right now!

268
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:19,307
Why are you wearing sunglasses at night?
You think you're famous or something?

269
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,474
I am.

270
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,351
You made me an instant celebrity.

271
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:23,853
How could I not wear them?

272
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:28,149
They blurred the wrong face.

273
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,734
My face would have gotten them more--

274
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,069
So why did you turn me down
at the speed of light?

275
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:33,946
You were probably intimidated by my status

276
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,282
and didn't want to look like a snob
by saying yes right away.

277
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,326
I understand all that because I'm chill.

278
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:40,077
Still,

279
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:42,997
I'd appreciate an explanation.

280
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,875
Like I said, I plan on staying single.

281
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,879
Same here.

282
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,547
Good, so let's forget
that anything happened.

283
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,550
Thanks for offering to forget
something so embarrassing for me,

284
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,677
but the whole world
already knows about it.

285
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,596
Why me, though?

286
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:02,224
Why did you choose me
out of all those people there?

287
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,142
That's…

288
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,230
Don't tell me what I've heard is true.

289
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:11,317
Like in that movie…

290
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,569
-What do you mean?
-I heard

291
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,363
humans tend to be more sincere in sleep.

292
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:16,906
I wasn't being serious!

293
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:22,745
Then why should I play along
with your inexplicable whims?

294
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:26,666
Find another person
who will marry you, no questions asked.

295
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:27,708
Don't worry.

296
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:29,585
Even if you were the last guy on Earth,

297
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,629
I would never, ever marry you.

298
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:33,589
That's a relief.

299
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,261
Did he just turn me down again?

300
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,013
He turned me down twice in a day?

301
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:43,099
-I'll give you a lift.
-Forget it!

302
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,850
What if there's another acid attack?

303
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:50,481
Start the car.

304
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:02,743
I blame it all on your name.

305
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,415
First, at the sea,

306
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:09,583
and then today.

307
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,254
"Salvation."

308
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:16,132
It's just too sweet.

309
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:21,345
I thought you had to be asleep
to be sincere.

310
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,389
It's because it's fake.

311
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,184
Fake things are always sweeter.

312
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:29,687
Salvation,

313
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,231
love, happiness, and whatnot.

314
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,900
Sweet things are bad for you.

315
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,945
Do you know what's the worst of all?

316
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:41,449
Happiness.

317
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:47,121
Humans end up unhappy
because they try to be happy.

318
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,711
That's why I don't try to be happy.

319
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,380
If happiness isn't your goal in life,

320
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,717
why do you work so hard?

321
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:04,472
Just out of habit.

322
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,767
After my parents passed,

323
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:13,397
it felt as if I'd get swallowed up
if I didn't work hard.

324
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:18,986
By things like sadness, guilt, self-pity,

325
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,279
and so on.

326
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:23,783
And before I knew it,

327
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,743
it became a habit.

328
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:06,492
What the hell? Damn it!

329
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,167
How pathetic.

330
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:26,804
TO DO-HEE

331
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:51,579
What happened?

332
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,540
You were snoring so loudly.

333
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:56,667
Me?

334
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,585
We're here.

335
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:06,302
I must've been very tired.

336
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,761
I don't usually snore.

337
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:11,265
I don't want you to go out alone
and get in trouble,

338
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,891
so call me if you need me.

339
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:14,310
Though I'd rather you didn't.

340
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,584
PERSONAL INFORMATION
DO DO-HEE

341
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:40,753
ADD EMERGENCY CONTACT

342
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,340
GU-WON THE SAVIOR

343
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,637
MOTHER, FATHER, BROTHER,
SISTER, SON, DAUGHTER,

344
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,929
FRIEND, SPOUSE, PARTNER,
SECRETARY, MANAGER…

345
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:53,432
He's my bodyguard after all.

346
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:56,185
I should put personal matters aside.

347
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,020
GUARDIAN: SEOK-HOON
MANAGER: GU-WON THE SAVIOR

348
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,825
TO DO-HEE

349
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:23,712
Dear Do-hee.

350
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:27,675
Madam Ju.

351
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,179
If you're reading this,

352
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:38,018
it would mean
that I left you all alone once again.

353
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:43,107
I'm not so curious
about how my life will end.

354
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:49,488
But I just hope
that my death won't hurt you.

355
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:51,365
That…

356
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,243
you'll be able to shake it off

357
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:57,246
as if it were a mischievous prank.

358
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,251
So Do-hee,

359
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:06,839
crying once is enough.

360
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:17,099
The position I'm leaving you with

361
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:21,645
is a battlefield
where tears aren't allowed.

362
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,606
FAMILY CONSENT FORM

363
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,192
WE GIVE OUR CONSENT TO THE AUTOPSY

364
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:30,988
I failed.

365
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,366
People may think I'm successful,

366
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:36,785
but I'm surrounded

367
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:42,416
by rotten people who remind me
that I've utterly failed.

368
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,712
You must be wondering

369
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:49,840
why I required you to marry
in order to become chairwoman.

370
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:52,926
This position

371
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:55,512
is incredibly lonely.

372
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:01,685
I've felt it to my core,
being on my own all this time.

373
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:05,731
Without you,

374
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:11,820
I would've drowned
in the hell that is loneliness.

375
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:16,533
I couldn't have you experience

376
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,037
the same hell I went through.

377
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,247
So…

378
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,292
if you're determined to take my place,

379
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,003
be sure to find someone

380
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:32,341
who will keep you company
and be on your side.

381
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,011
THE LATE JU CHEON-SUK

382
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,430
If you fail to find such a person,

383
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:41,809
just throw this position to the wolves

384
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,186
and save yourself.

385
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:48,941
This is the only thing I can do

386
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,069
as I leave you behind
in the den of wolves.

387
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:57,950
I understand your intentions, Madam Ju.

388
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:01,954
But you trust me, don't you?

389
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:05,040
I can manage well on my own.

390
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,274
HERE LIES A LEGEND
CHOI DEOK-HO

391
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:44,413
We don't deserve to shed a single tear

392
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,623
until we've avenged our boss's death!

393
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:50,502
We will offer that bastard's head
to our boss!

394
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:51,879
No matter what!

395
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:59,469
Sir, I got a lead
on that bastard from the restaurant.

396
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:02,472
His name is Jeong Gu-won,
and I have his credit card number.

397
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:03,390
And take a look.

398
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:11,106
Only this part breaks up.

399
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:14,985
The employees were clueless,
so this wasn't their doing.

400
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:19,740
Who the hell is this prick?

401
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,672
Good morning, Young Master.

402
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:38,800
It's a beautiful day, Young Master Yi-sun.

403
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:40,135
Young Master!

404
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:12,000
Good morning, Director Jeong.

405
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:16,880
-Mr. Park.
-Yes?

406
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:22,302
My memories from when I was human
are starting to come back.

407
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:30,143
Yi-sun? You don't know the family name?

408
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:31,645
That's what everyone called me.

409
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,773
Shall I delve into the matter?

410
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:39,027
I could look into noblemen named Yi-sun
from the Joseon Dynasty.

411
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:40,988
I'm not sure if it'd do me any good

412
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:43,532
to know who I was when I was human.

413
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,783
I'm not even sure that's me.

414
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,410
What's there to lose?

415
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:49,496
Let me see. Kim Yi-sun? Park Yi-sun?
What could it be?

416
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:53,125
But why are your memories
suddenly coming back after 200 years?

417
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:59,256
-What?
-Without your powers,

418
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:01,550
you're practically nothing…
I mean, a human.

419
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,385
That must be why they're coming back.

420
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:04,720
You're a human now.

421
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,680
So? What about it?

422
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:10,684
It means that you're mortal,
just like everyone else.

423
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:13,478
Car accidents are a bigger risk
than spontaneous combustion.

424
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:16,273
Goodbye, eternal life. Hello, aging.

425
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:17,190
Aging?

426
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:21,528
You'll look like me in no time.

427
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,030
No!

428
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:24,322
That can't happen.

429
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:26,408
No way.

430
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,869
I don't believe it. My face…

431
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,579
Here… and here…

432
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:33,623
No.

433
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:34,624
My tattoo.

434
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,960
I need my tattoo back.

435
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:38,545
Let's go.

436
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,925
CHAIRWOMAN JU DIES OF A HEART ATTACK
FAMILY BIDS TEARFUL FAREWELL

437
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,808
Give me your wrist. Quickly.

438
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:02,611
Weren't you going to do something?

439
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,530
-No.
-Then why are you holding my wrist?

440
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:06,615
How should I put it?

441
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:07,949
It gives me peace of mind.

442
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:09,534
Let's stay like this from now on.

443
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:14,164
I can't do that.

444
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,833
I have a public face to uphold.

445
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:20,879
You turned me down at the speed of light
not once but twice in a day.

446
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,798
If I let you hold me by the wrist,

447
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,466
what would people think of me?

448
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,093
That you're chill?

449
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:27,511
I'm not chill.

450
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:29,971
In fact, I care so much
that I'm practically boiling.

451
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:31,431
This is your chance to be chill.

452
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:34,017
You can be chill. I'll live the way I am.

453
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:36,853
This is for both of us.

454
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:40,232
Arthritis might stop me
from saving you in the future.

455
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,149
Arthritis?

456
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:44,528
I hate to admit it,
but I'm a mere human without my powers.

457
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:47,489
That means time isn't on my side anymore.

458
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:48,407
So?

459
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,826
I'm going to age just like all of you.

460
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,414
Are you saying

461
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:59,292
you want to keep holding my wrist
because you're afraid you'll age?

462
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:01,253
Yes, you get that now?

463
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:03,880
No.

464
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:05,215
What is it now?

465
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,342
You're treating me
like a wireless charger.

466
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:09,386
And you treat me like a Pokémon.

467
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:10,679
Demon, Pokémon. Same difference.

468
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:13,140
Whatever, you ignorant human.

469
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:15,725
Then I'll stop being your bodyguard.

470
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:17,894
Suit yourself.

471
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:21,398
If I die, your precious tattoo
will vanish with me.

472
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:24,067
Is that a threat?

473
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:25,527
You're the one who wants to quit.

474
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,612
Why can't you just charge me up?

475
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,657
I can't do it all the time.

476
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:32,117
Then when?

477
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:54,431
Good times.

478
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:57,017
Good times

479
00:32:58,435 --> 00:33:01,730
are always excruciatingly short.

480
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:13,783
Goodness!

481
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:16,077
My treasure…

482
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:17,913
I'm so sorry.

483
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:24,294
I don't have any cash on me.

484
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,296
You don't?

485
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,214
No.

486
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,675
You can always wire me.

487
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:31,968
JESUS CORP.
DAEGUK BANK

488
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:32,886
MIRAE F&B

489
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:33,803
Good morning.

490
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:36,306
-Good morning.
-"Good morning"?

491
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:39,809
How can you say that
when our chairwoman passed away?

492
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:42,979
Let's face it.
You never even talked to her in person.

493
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:45,482
I think it's unnecessary
to pretend to be sad.

494
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,901
What's the point of making it big

495
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:50,654
and having connections
throughout the world?

496
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,240
Life is fleeting.

497
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:55,116
On that note,

498
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,826
how about a team dinner?

499
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,162
My reading said today's a bad day
for my social life.

500
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:02,415
How come every day
is a bad day for your social life?

501
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:11,049
Don't.

502
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:38,660
You're aging even as we speak.

503
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:55,677
Ms. Do is here. Smile.

504
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:01,850
Ms. Shin.

505
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,561
What happened to my actual date?

506
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,691
I mean the one I couldn't meet last time

507
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,568
because I was stuck with the wrong one.

508
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,153
Shall I arrange a meeting?

509
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,195
As soon as possible.

510
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:15,739
Yes, ma'am.

511
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:19,242
Also, I've secured the footage
you talked about.

512
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:23,663
What's this?

513
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:27,876
Madam Ju died from a drug allergy
on the day she ordered an audit team.

514
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,628
Since her medicine was in her bag,

515
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,672
the cameras must've caught someone
tampering with it.

516
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,550
It'll take forever
to go through all these.

517
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:37,427
Good luck.

518
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:38,970
Did you forget?

519
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:41,348
We're in the same boat.

520
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:44,684
Again, good luck.

521
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:00,992
Start with the most recent ones

522
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:03,620
so that we don't check
the same ones twice.

523
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:06,414
Am I a bodyguard or a private detective?

524
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:08,375
You're asking too much of me.

525
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:11,586
My eyes are burning.

526
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,006
This is too primitive.

527
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,132
Let's find another way.

528
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:17,050
Like what?

529
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:19,552
I could find the guy who was after you
with my powers.

530
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:23,056
-Is that possible?
-Of course.

531
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:26,518
-How come you never told me that?
-You never asked.

532
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,480
What have we been doing all this time?

533
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,649
Then we can also find out
who's behind him.

534
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:33,983
Problem solved.

535
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,862
-Let's go catch him right now.
-Okay.

536
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,783
Hold on a second.

537
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:44,869
Promise me one thing first.

538
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:45,829
What is it?

539
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:48,248
You won't need me
once we catch the culprit,

540
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:49,707
but I'll still need you.

541
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:52,836
It's obvious
how your attitude will change.

542
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,379
Don't be silly.

543
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:56,965
-You don't trust me?
-No.

544
00:36:58,758 --> 00:36:59,676
Fine.

545
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:04,264
I'll help you get your tattoo back
even after we catch the culprit.

546
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:05,682
Are you happy now?

547
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:11,438
Hold on. Just a second.

548
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:12,564
What is it now?

549
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,441
-One more thing.
-There's more?

550
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:17,610
Let me charge regardless of where we are
and who's watching.

551
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,614
-That's too much.
-Forget it then.

552
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:23,825
Fine, I'll do that.

553
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:27,745
I'll let you charge whenever you want
once the culprit is caught. Happy now?

554
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:29,706
Keep your word.
555
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:31,1000
I will, so hurry up
before I change my mind.

555
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,543
I'm already regretting it.

556
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,421
Hold on.

557
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:39,799
Bring us close to the culprit,
but not too close.

558
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:40,884
I may have to report it to--

559
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,969
Be quiet. You're distracting me.

560
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:56,649
What's going on?

561
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,120
What, you can't do it?

562
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:10,538
Give me a minute.

563
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:11,748
That's not right.

564
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:17,962
All that fuss for this?

565
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:20,089
What's going on? Why isn't it working?

566
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:23,259
Have you lost all your powers?

567
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,104
I haven't.

568
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:39,734
Then why?

569
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,694
Name anyone.

570
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:43,071
Someone I've met in person.

571
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,492
Mr. Han from the PR team?

572
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,954
The overzealous one? Got it.

573
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,962
Ms. Do, I've scheduled your date on…

574
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,810
I knew it. What was I expecting?

575
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:17,021
Gather up, guys.

576
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:22,318
Don't you think something's going on
between Ms. Do and Mr. Jeong?

577
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,445
What do you mean?

578
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:27,824
I bet the two of them are dating.

579
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:34,289
The way they interact
hints at physical intimacy.

580
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,916
You couldn't be more wrong.

581
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:40,587
Mr. Jeong turned down Ms. Do's proposal.

582
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:43,423
She wouldn't have proposed to him
if nothing was going on.

583
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,593
-You're right.
-I am.

584
00:39:46,676 --> 00:39:48,177
What are you saying?

585
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:52,348
Workplace romance can be so exciting.

586
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:53,641
Have you done it yourself?

587
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:55,018
Of course.

588
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,644
You know what the best part is?

589
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,479
What is it?

590
00:39:58,563 --> 00:39:59,480
Team dinners.

591
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:01,733
You're obsessed.

592
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:06,821
There's nothing like
secretly holding hands

593
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:09,115
under the table at team dinners.

594
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:13,703
There's something so enjoyable
about secret physical touch.

595
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:19,292
To workplace romance.

596
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:20,710
Cheers.

597
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:26,758
Even the slightest touch…

598
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:32,889
and momentary eye contact
can make sparks fly.

599
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:38,061
In my case,
we were holding hands for five hours.

600
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:41,773
You didn't even go to the restroom?

601
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:42,774
Don't be ridiculous.

602
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:44,984
-Should we…
-Should we…

603
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:53,576
What was that?

604
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,078
Is it a rat?

605
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:58,456
-A rat?
-Wait.

606
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:06,798
-Open the door.
-Open it.

607
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:07,965
-Me?
-Yes.

608
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:09,634
Come on.

609
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:13,054
-Open it!
-Here we go!

610
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,280
What's the point in finding Mr. Han?

611
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:33,491
There's something wrong
with the culprit, not me.

612
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:37,286
I clearly saw his face, so why…

613
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:39,372
-So it involves facial recognition?
-Yes.

614
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,083
Did he get plastic surgery?

615
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:44,961
Anyway, my powers aren't the problem,

616
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,796
so let me keep holding your wrist.

617
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:49,132
I said, "After we catch the culprit."

618
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:54,429
People already suspect
we're dating as it is.

619
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:33,843
ABRAXAS:
RELEASE THE HUNTING DOG

620
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:38,139
Why won't my powers work on that bastard?

621
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:41,684
Do you want to go for drinks
after work, Mr. Jeong?

622
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:44,228
I'd like to throw you a welcome party.

623
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:48,900
Is there a team dinner?

624
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:51,569
Ms. Choi, isn't today a bad day
for your social life?

625
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:52,987
But it's a good day

626
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:54,864
for my dating life.

627
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:56,783
Gosh, what's with you?

628
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:57,700
A team dinner?

629
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,043
You still haven't found him?

630
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:08,628
No, sir.

631
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:11,631
I had my guys ask around, but…

632
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:15,218
Hire a private detective,
storm the card company, or something!

633
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:17,303
Find him!

634
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:18,846
-I'm sorry, sir!
-I'm sorry, sir!

635
00:43:21,224 --> 00:43:22,767
You bozos.

636
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:24,602
Goodness, boss.

637
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:33,236
This is on the house.

638
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:36,697
Hey, the ice is melting.

639
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:38,241
Bring some new ice!

640
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:40,493
I'm sorry, sir.

641
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:46,124
THOSE WHO SEEK ME DILIGENTLY FIND ME
PROVERBS 8:17

642
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:58,010
JEONG GU-WON
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF SUNWOL FOUNDATION

643
00:43:58,094 --> 00:43:59,512
BODYGUARD OF DO DO-HEE, CEO OF MIRAE F&B…

644
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:38,801
You killed someone
on top of all your dirty tricks?

645
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:43,431
You'll have to pay

646
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:45,850
for what you've done.

647
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,029
I knew it.

648
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:03,868
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

649
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:54,961
That wakes me up.

650
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:13,396
They already got to it.

651
00:46:17,066 --> 00:46:18,484
You're not done yet?

652
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:19,485
I'm almost done.

653
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:21,445
SEOK-HOON

654
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:25,700
Hi, Seok-hoon.

655
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:28,786
I secured Mr. Cha's laptop
and took a look,

656
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:30,287
but it was way too clean.

657
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:32,081
It's already been wiped out.

658
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:34,625
I'm going through the CCTV footage,
and it's the same.

659
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:38,754
Why don't we have dinner together?

660
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:40,965
I'll come right over.

661
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:42,883
I didn't realize how late it was.

662
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:45,094
Sure, I should eat something anyway.

663
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:49,515
No, you already have plans.

664
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:51,392
I do?

665
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:04,739
Why is everyone so quiet?

666
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,323
Is Ms. Do making you uncomfortable?

667
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:13,998
If we'd known Ms. Do was coming,
we would've booked a nicer place.

668
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:19,837
This was supposed to be
a casual welcome party for Mr. Jeong.

669
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:23,591
For the first round,
let's casually go for somaek.

670
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:29,930
That's what I'm talking about.

671
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:31,974
Here we go.

672
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:36,604
My goodness!

673
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,817
He's more resourceful than he looks.

674
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:45,571
-For the star of the night.
-No, thanks. I'm still working.

675
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,990
But it's your welcome party.

676
00:47:48,074 --> 00:47:52,411
Then let's all drink on his behalf
to welcome him to the company.

677
00:47:52,495 --> 00:47:53,746
Bottoms up!

678
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:56,415
-Welcome to the company.
-Cheers.

679
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:12,181
This is going to be a fun night!

680
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:15,309
-Let me.
-Pour me one.

681
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,269
Here you go.

682
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:21,816
That's too much. Drink this.

683
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:31,325
It sure is a bad day for my social life.

684
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,786
My superstitions never betray me.

685
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,249
Ms. Choi, you prefer soju?

686
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:40,709
Let's drink. Bottoms up!

687
00:48:40,793 --> 00:48:41,794
-Bottoms up!
-Bottoms up!

688
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:42,878
-Nice!
-Yes!

689
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:48,843
-This is nice.
-It is.

690
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:51,470
Let's drink some more.

691
00:48:54,223 --> 00:48:55,850
-Cheers.
-Way to go!

692
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:58,394
-Should Ms. Do drink too?
-Let's go in order!

693
00:48:58,477 --> 00:49:00,479
-Cheers.
-Let's go!

694
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,651
Ms. Choi's out.

695
00:49:06,402 --> 00:49:07,236
Ms. Choi.

696
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:09,446
Use this as a pillow.

697
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:11,282
That's smart.

698
00:49:13,576 --> 00:49:18,038
Ms. Do, your face has gone red.

699
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,249
You're even redder.

700
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:23,210
It's because I've been drinking.

701
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:25,838
Sure, of course.

702
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:28,174
Can I ask you something?

703
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:30,926
Why did you turn Ms. Do down?

704
00:49:32,178 --> 00:49:34,847
Are we playing truth or dare?

705
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:37,933
Is she not your type?

706
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:39,518
Why don't we call it a day?

707
00:49:39,602 --> 00:49:41,854
That's not it. I like her.

708
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:48,319
-Then why?
-Exactly. Why?

709
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:49,945
So why?

710
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:55,701
People who like pork

711
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:57,661
don't marry pigs, do they?

712
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:04,293
Am I that drunk?

713
00:50:05,461 --> 00:50:06,879
It's already 8 p.m.

714
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:09,048
-We might miss the last bus.
-What?

715
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:10,716
I'll get going.

716
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:13,052
Bye. I think I'll have another…

717
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:15,179
-Let's just go.
-What?

718
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,390
-Ms. Choi.
-Ms. Choi, let's go.

719
00:50:18,474 --> 00:50:20,309
-We're leaving.
-Excuse us.

720
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:22,978
It was supposed to be a good day
for my dating life.

721
00:50:23,062 --> 00:50:25,231
-Let's go.
-Okay.

722
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:27,149
My gosh.

723
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:28,943
I can finally charge without…

724
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:32,321
I'm not in the mood.

725
00:50:39,495 --> 00:50:42,039
But why?

726
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:45,834
What is it now?

727
00:50:45,918 --> 00:50:48,462
I can't charge when we're around others
or when you're not in the mood.

728
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:50,339
Then when can I ever charge?

729
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:51,715
You're seriously…

730
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:55,844
Forget it.

731
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:02,476
I'm human.

732
00:51:02,977 --> 00:51:05,271
I'm a person with emotions,
not just a charger for…

733
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:21,537
I'd rather age than put up with her.

734
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:29,920
Something might happen
if I leave her alone.

735
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:04,038
You're the trash from the other day.

736
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:05,622
Trash?

737
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:09,585
I don't know what tricks
you used last time, but--

738
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:11,337
Nice to see you, but I have to take this.

739
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:12,963
I'm not done.

740
00:52:15,591 --> 00:52:19,053
Hey, good job.
I didn't see that coming. Nice.

741
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:26,060
You guys leave me no choice.

742
00:52:27,061 --> 00:52:29,897
He has another newspaper.

743
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:31,523
All right.

744
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:34,902
DO-HEE THE NUTJOB

745
00:52:42,785 --> 00:52:44,161
-Get him.
-Yes, sir.

746
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:49,500
The number you have dialed cannot be…

747
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:50,501
GU-WON THE SAVIOR

748
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:52,002
Where did he go?

749
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:57,883
GU-WON THE SAVIOR

750
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:37,339
Mother.

751
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:42,344
Did you even have the right
to criticize others' wrongs?

752
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:31,518
You bastard.

753
00:54:32,311 --> 00:54:33,395
I finally got you.

754
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:38,650
Hey.

755
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:41,778
Say hi…

756
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:44,990
to the boss for me.

757
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:09,681
Jeong Gu-won.

758
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:13,101
Do Do-hee.

759
00:55:14,353 --> 00:55:15,604
What do you want?

760
00:55:20,943 --> 00:55:22,528
I'm…

761
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:27,032
my bodyguard's bodyguard!

762
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:28,909
What is she saying?

763
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:33,956
Boys, take care of her.

764
00:55:35,207 --> 00:55:37,751
Stay away.

765
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:41,421
Why is charging
always the problem for everything?

766
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:44,550
Stay away.

767
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,262
Is that a gun?

768
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:57,020
Get her!

769
00:55:58,313 --> 00:55:59,523
Jeong Gu-won!

770
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,102
Do you know

771
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:39,646
how to tango?

772
00:56:40,731 --> 00:56:41,565
Tango?

773
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:04,004
-What's happening?
-Something's wrong.

774
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:05,339
This is strange, sir.

775
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:08,634
You must trust your partner
when you tango.

776
00:57:08,717 --> 00:57:10,719
Why are you suddenly talking about tango?

777
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:11,928
Get it together!

778
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:14,806
Don't fall for his tricks.

779
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:16,099
What is this?

780
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:17,601
Get him!

781
00:57:22,022 --> 00:57:23,231
Behind you!

782
00:57:29,655 --> 00:57:31,031
Hey, give me that.

783
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:23,333
You morons,
why are you dancing all of a sudden?

784
00:58:23,417 --> 00:58:25,001
Pull yourselves together!

785
00:58:25,085 --> 00:58:26,962
What is this?!

786
00:58:33,802 --> 00:58:34,970
"Rule number one for bodyguards."

787
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:37,556
"Never let her out of your sight."

788
00:58:41,143 --> 00:58:42,394
"Rule number two."

789
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:44,354
"Never stray far from her."

790
00:58:59,828 --> 00:59:01,079
"And rule number three."

791
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:04,750
"Never…

792
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:08,628
fall in love with her."

793
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:23,662
Something's wrong with me.

794
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:25,247
Falling for a worthless human being?

795
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:26,873
What's with the attitude?
Did I do something wrong?

796
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:29,084
I don't see why I should be nice to you.

797
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:32,796
I declare that CEO Noh Suk-min
has been elected acting chairman.

798
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:34,631
Do send me a wedding invitation.

799
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:36,174
I insist on being there as your family.

800
01:00:36,258 --> 01:00:38,593
It doesn't matter who.
It's not a real marriage anyway.

801
01:00:38,677 --> 01:00:40,011
Let's register our marriage today.

802
01:00:40,095 --> 01:00:41,721
Are you really going to marry
that sleazebag?

803
01:00:41,805 --> 01:00:42,848
Why are you so upset?

804
01:00:42,931 --> 01:00:45,475
Pull yourself together
and tell me what your problem is.

805
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:47,227
You want to know what my problem is?

806
01:00:51,398 --> 01:00:56,403
