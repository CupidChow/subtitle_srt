1
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,040
will be eliminated.

2
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,440
Do you understand?

3
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,640
Yes.

4
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,360
Then...

5
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,520
hidden depth

6
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,680
Qing Gang,

7
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,400
Her Highness,

8
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,400
are you all right?

9
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,440
Why are you betraying me, Mr. Xing?

10
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,400
I'm just

11
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,400
You look down on Shuyin too much.

12
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,560
Why do you care about her?

13
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,840
Are you still angry

14
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,800
about what I said?

15
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,240
I'm a straightforward person.

16
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,880
I'm not good at talking.

17
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,920
But I have no bad intentions

18
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,160
to Prince of Chiyin and Princess.

19
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,200
You were set up by someone today.

20
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,080
I can't stand by and do nothing.

21
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,600
You're really a stubborn man.

22
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,880
You can set up a trap.

23
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,240
Anyway,

24
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,640
I didn't want to stay here.

25
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,280
I hate people who do little things.

26
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,680
Why don't you and I go up the mountain together?

27
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,040
You...

28
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:45,640
You...

29
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:50,720
Be careful.

30
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:58,920
Open it.

31
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,000
Save me.

32
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,240
Yin has been promoted to the Minister of Rites.

33
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,960
He has made a wide selection.

34
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,240
He has made one step closer to the goal

35
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,320
I set for him.

36
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,600
Congratulations, Master.

37
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,560
The result of this selection

38
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,240
must be in my control.

39
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:37,620
I will send the

40
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,600
court to you anyway.

41
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,000
I will make it a deal.

42
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,920
With the Southern Strike,

43
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,920
Yin Jiainger will drink to continue one's Mencius Rank.

44
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,760
As a Shaosi,

45
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,520
I will give you one hundred thousand Gengshaped Seals.

46
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,640
Still yuan permanently.

47
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,920
Can you hope to warm the aquela

48
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,520
Bai Xue Lu is the eldest daughter of the Bai family.

49
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,920
She is smart and smart.

50
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,720
I think she will be able to help Yin'er to take over the throne in the future.

51
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,720
Let them both make a compromise.

52
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,120
Yes.

53
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,920
Cun Sha, what does this mean?

54
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,920
Qing Gang defeated the Shi clan.

55
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,720
The Shi clan defeated the Qing clan.

56
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,120
Qing Gang defeated the Shi clan.

57
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,920
The identity of the young minister is me.

58
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:32,920
How dare he do such a small thing under my nose?

59
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,320
I will make him regret it.

60
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,920
You all drive Qiong Qi to his side.

61
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,520
If anything happens, it will be his life.

62
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,120
It's just that how to deal with the princess of the Chi clan?

63
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,920
She is traveling with Qing Gang.

64
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:54,320
If he faces Qiong Qi, he will be hurt.

65
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,520
Since he is in a group with Qing Gang,

66
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,520
so he lost his life, it's also his life.

67
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,120
Yes.

68
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,520
General Qing, so many people are looking for you.

69
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,320
Why did you choose me?

70
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,720
Don't worry.

71
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,320
On the battlefield, I won't give up on any of my brothers.

72
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:19,520
Here, I will be the one to take care of them.

73
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,320
I won't abandon you.

74
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,720
You misunderstood. I am not trying to be nice to you.

75
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,720
I just don't want to go up the mountain and worship any of the Shi.

76
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,520
Since we are in a group, I can only say sorry here.

77
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,520
Why are you here if you don't want to worship the Shi?

78
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,920
Oh no, it's Qiong Qi.

79
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,720
What kind of luck do we have? Run!

80
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,720
Hurry.

81
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,920
Qing Gang!

82
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,120
Qing Zhou!

83
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,120
Qing Gang!

84
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,720
Qing Gang!

85
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,720
Qing Zi, you want to use poison, don't you?

86
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,720
Hurry and use poison.

87
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,120
Even if you can't defeat him, you can make him weaker.

88
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,520
Hurry!

89
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,720
Why are you hesitating?

90
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,720
It's the time to die!

91
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,520
What poison did you use? Why is it not working?

92
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,320
But it's okay. It gave us a time to run away.

93
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,720
Using poison is a common way. I don't like it.

94
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,920
So even though I am Qing Zu, I didn't do much.

95
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,120
So you don't have any powerful poison.

96
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,320
Looks like we are going to die this time.

97
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,320
I am thirsty.

98
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,520
How did Qiong Qi know where they are hiding?

99
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,720
I saw the wind and rain blowing.

100
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,920
I didn't expect it to be Qiong Qi.

101
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,920
How did you see it? Where did you go?

102
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,920
I...

103
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,720
I went to Qianyue Peak to clean up that girl.

104
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,520
I didn't expect Qing Gang to save her.

105
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,120
I saw her.

106
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,520
You guys are interfering with the selection.

107
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,320
The Nine-Yi Mountain Law says that interfering with the selection requires punishment.

108
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:33,520
Then I will punish myself for not sleeping on the tree or on the bed for a month.

109
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,120
I am doing this for your own good.

110
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,720
But Qiong Qi is already in the mountain.

111
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,720
They might have met each other.

112
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,920
I am not going to let you go.

113
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,120
I am going to punish myself.

114
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,120
They might have met each other.

115
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,520
You are not allowed to save them.

116
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,520
What is this?

117
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,520
How is Qiong Qi so hard to deal with?

118
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,720
I told you to use your pepper powder.

119
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,520
I will think of a way.

120
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,120
I will stop her. You run away.

121
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,920
It is written in the Cloud Wilderness Book.

122
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,520
Qiong Qi is a vicious beast.

123
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,720
He fights with officials.

124
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,520
He is the one who has the power and rewards the evil.

125
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,720
He kills the evil.

126
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,520
Kill the evil.

127
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,320
Wait.

128
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,320
If you bite him to death today, you will be eliminated.

129
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,920
Qing Gao, you have a day.

130
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,920
Qiong Qi, what the book says is all fake.

131
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,120
You are not a beast.

132
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,920
I think you are a great beast.

133
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,520
Qiong Qi, you don't know,

134
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,120
he is a famous demon in the army.

135
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,520
He kills people without blinking.

136
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,520
He is the most dangerous person in the world.

137
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,720
If you bite him to death today, you will be eliminated.

138
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,720
I...

139
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,920
at me.

140
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,120
at me.

141
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,920
My life doesn't count.

142
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,120
I believe I'm just a gentleman.

143
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,920
I didn't expect I would be in your hands today.

144
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,680
Are you trying to kill people?

145
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,680
Lord Qiushan,

146
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,680
goodbye.

147
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,240
What were you singing just now?

148
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,760
It's recorded in the ancient books.

149
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,480
Qiongqi likes evil people

150
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,040
and hates righteous people.

151
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,640
I was just trying to get lucky.

152
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,440
I was talking

153
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,160
about all sorts of things

154
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,400
and I was out of the picture.

155
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,480
Luckily, Qiongqi is simple-minded.

156
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,200
She won't be able to hear anything.

157
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,000
It seems that we

158
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,600
should make up for our mistakes today.

159
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,600
I finally escaped from the trap.

160
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,920
What's going on?

161
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,840
Should he be hurt?

162
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,680
Why are you here?

163
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,520
Chenging.

164
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,320
Chenging.

165
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,080
Go where?

166
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,760
The smell of the Jun閑

167
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,840
is so strong.

168
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,200
Could it be she is back?

169
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,600
Is this...

170
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,080
Is this the legendary Chaos?

171
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,600
It's been in use for hundreds of years.

172
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,480
Why did it suddenly appear?

173
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,840
Qiongqi is in a crisis.

174
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,120
Could it be that the Chaos

175
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,360
is Qiongqi's problem?

176
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,640
It's chasing after her.

177
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,840
Before the Heaven and Earth were opened,

178
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,840
Chaos was formed by the spirit of grudges.

179
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,560
It's not in any system.

180
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,080
Even the previous Star Lord

181
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,560
couldn't handle Chaos.

182
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,240
Not to mention them.

183
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,200
I'm afraid you and the Great Sage

184
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,240
are no match for it.

185
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,920
The Chaos is gone.

186
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,540
The

187
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:12,840
Lough is gone.

188
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,840
Nothing is left.

189
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,960
Nothing is dead.

190
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,240
It's hard for these two people

191
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,720
to get rid of Qiongqi.

192
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,520
If they were swallowed by Chaos,

193
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,120
I don't think

194
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,440
even the bones will be left.

195
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,440
Maybe it's the will of the heavens.

196
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,040
Shiyi.

197
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:27,760
Yes.

198
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,600
The Chaos is gone.

199
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,720
The Chaos is gone.

200
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,840
The Chaos is gone.

201
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,960
The Chaos is gone.

202
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,080
The Chaos is gone.

203
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,200
The Chaos is gone.

204
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,320
The Chaos is gone.

205
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,440
The Chaos is gone.

206
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,560
The Chaos is gone.

207
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,600
She must have gone to save

208
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,640
the daughter of the Immortal.

209
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,760
This...

210
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,720
What is she doing here?

211
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,440
She ordered you to send flowers with the beauty group.

212
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,160
Beauty group.

213
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,040
Beauty life.

214
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,160
Little helper.

215
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,320
Hurry, Chongyuan.

216
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,360
Qingdao.

217
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,120
Chongyuan.

218
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:40,840
Qingdao.

219
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,760
Be careful.

220
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,400
Where am I?

221
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,200
Why am I

222
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,440
in this place?

223
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,480
Here it is.

224
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,240
How could a little boy

225
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,280
be so impetuous

226
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,560
and so strange?

227
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,160
Who are you?

228
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,800
Who I am doesn't matter.

229
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:29,740
What matters is that he's a

230
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,000
courtesan.

231
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,320
No.

232
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,240
No matter how he says, he's a courtesan.

233
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,680
No matter how cruel he is,

234
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,000
he won't be so cruel.

235
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,280
Why not?

236
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,640
He was a courtesan before.

237
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,080
Didn't he ask Chong Ming to deal with you?

238
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,920
Everything is fake.

239
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,400
He lied to me.

240
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,280
He wouldn't do that.

241
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:53,960
You're lying.

242
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,480
It's all a lie.

243
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,280
You're despicable.

244
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,400
You want to save someone by using your own ways.

245
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,000
But you have to stay here

246
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,200
and live with your own people.

247
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,200
You're despicable.

248
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,240
You want to live with your own people.

249
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,080
But you have to stay here

250
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,880
and live with your own people.

251
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,360
You're despicable.

252
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,240
You want to live with your own people.

253
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,920
But you have to stay here

254
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,520
and live with your own people.

255
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,960
You're despicable.

256
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,840
You want to live with your own people.

257
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,560
But you have to stay here

258
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,280
and live with your own people.

259
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,960
But you have to stay here

260
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,720
and live with your own people.

261
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,480
But you have to stay here

262
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,240
and live with your own people.

263
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,960
But you have to stay here

264
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,320
and live with your own people.

265
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,520
If you live with your own people,

266
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,400
something is wrong with you.

267
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,520
But you have to stay here

268
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,760
and live with your own people.

269
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,120
That's why you live with your own people.

270
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,600
If you live with your own people,

271
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,000
something is wrong with you.

272
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,560
Look at it.

273
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,160
If you stay here

274
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,760
and live with your own people,

275
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,680
then what good willberg innovation

276
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,920
does to the people?

277
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,400
So what good was that till now?

278
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,160
Little things are happening.

279
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,240
This part is how it is now.

280
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,520
The third part does a lot now.

281
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,280
I'm going to kill you.

282
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,480
You look down on me.

283
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,480
Let me go.

284
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,480
Let me go.

285
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,040
Let me go.

286
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,280
Don't move.

287
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,920
The person you want to kill

288
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,320
is right in front of you.

289
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,560
It's really you.

290
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,920
Let me go.

291
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,920
I'm going to kill you.

292
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,320
I'm going to kill you.

293
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,520
Why don't you move?

294
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,840
I don't want you to die.

295
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You don't want me to die?

296
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,000
This is the Abyss of the God of Deception.

297
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,080
The God of Deception is using your abyss.

298
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,840
Don't look at it.

299
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,320
Don't listen to it either.

300
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,520
Who are you?

301
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,160
What happened just now?

302
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,880
Did you save me?

303
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,560
What's wrong with my eyes?

304
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,160
Why can't I see anything?

305
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,960
Why is my voice

306
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,520
so strange?

307
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
We are still in the chaos.

308
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,000
You are affected by the dust.

309
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,400
You can't move for a while.

310
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,920
You will recover later.

311
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,920
Chaos?

312
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,480
When the Red Alliance was founded,

313
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,520
the Heavenly Emperor was in chaos.

314
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,920
After the gods left the Heavenly Emperor,

315
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,720
they only left this place to absorb the grudges.

316
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,320
The Duke of Mount Buzhou,

317
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,720
the female frog,

318
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,720
was taken to the border of the Four Tribes.

319
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,320
Their grudges

320
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,120
were absorbed here.

321
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,320
And this chaos

322
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,720
became the place

323
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:28,720
where the world

324
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,920
likes to absorb the most

325
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,720
the place where there is no grudges

326
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,920
and the place where there is no evil.

327
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,520
The place where there is no evil.

328
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,720
And the place where there is no evil.

329
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,120
Then who are you?

330
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,720
Why are you here?

331
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,320
Why are you saving me?

332
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,320
You don't have to ask me that.

333
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,120
If you believe me,

334
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,520
just come with me.

335
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,920
Thank you.

336
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,920
Thank you, Senior.

337
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,120
I thought I lost my mind just now.

338
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,720
Did I do something

339
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,720
that was unreasonable?

340
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,120
No.

341
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,720
It's just an illusion.

342
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,320
Princess Zhuo Yan.

343
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,520
Don't come over.

344
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,120
Run.

345
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:22,720
Don't be angry.

346
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:24,920
Help.

347
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:25,920
Help.

348
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,520
Sister.

349
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,320
Sister.

350
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:30,920
Sister.

351
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:33,720
Go.

352
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:34,920
I can't let both of them

353
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,720
die here.

354
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,320
Go.

355
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,320
The evil eye of the Bear Jin is the same as the evil eye of the world.

356
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,720
The city is covered with the sun.

357
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,120
The city is covered with the sun.

358
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:42,920
Wait.

359
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,920
I can't eat this evil rabbit.

360
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,520
I'm sorry.

361
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:54,720
I'm sorry.

362
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,320
Sister.

363
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,120
It's disrespectful.

364
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,720
It's a rebellion.

365
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,520
It kills people like horses.

366
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,320
It's a big thief who steals people.

367
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,720
It's a thief

368
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,520
who steals people.

369
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,320
Yong Zhi.

370
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,520
We can't eat this person.

371
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,520
Don't make me mad.

372
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,120
Really.

373
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:37,920
That guy

374
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:38,920
really messed up with us

375
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,520
all in a sudden.

376
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:46,920
Really?

377
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:48,920
How would I believe it?

378
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,120
Let's kill all the villains together

379
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,120
and save the capital city.

380
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,120
Do you really think

381
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,320
you can kill us all in a second?

382
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,320
What if the government

383
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,520
is also responsible for this?

384
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:00,720
Then

385
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,440
Pig moon!

386
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,200
I'm scared!

387
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:24,660
Sister!

388
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,440
There must be a high overlooked person

389
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,400
helping out secretly.

390
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:30,680
Who?

391
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,720
I don't know who it is.

392
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,080
Are you all right?

393
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,640
General Qin,

394
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,840
we've only met twice.

395
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,280
You already know me so well.

396
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,480
I'm not filial

397
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,160
and I'm a murderer.

398
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,760
I'm a thief.

399
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,240
I think General Qin won't mind

400
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,240
if I put on his clothes.

401
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,040
You can take it.

402
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,760
Qiong Qi likes bad people.

403
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,280
That's why he made such a plan.

404
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,920
He won't destroy your intention.

405
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,960
Don't be nervous, General Qin.

406
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,440
I know

407
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,400
you've always been good to me.

408
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,240
But Qiong Qi didn't believe it at all.

409
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,880
Why did he leave

410
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,080
with a change of heart?

411
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,560
I don't know.

412
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,120
Why did he leave with a change of heart?

413
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,680
Of course, we are blessed with the world.

414
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,400
That's why we escaped.

415
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,880
But it's not safe to stay here forever.

416
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,280
Let's get out of here.

417
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,880
Where's your team?

418
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,280
Princess Zhu Yan was swallowed by a group of darkness.

419
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,080
I'm looking for her everywhere.

420
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,560
A Yan and you?

421
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,480
Where is she now?

422
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,640
We should hurry up...

423
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,000
We won't keep you from looking for her.

424
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,880
Zhu Yan is so smart.

425
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,280
She'll be fine.

426
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,400
I'm looking forward to

427
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,840
seeing you on the mountain.

428
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,600
General Qin, I'll wait for you.

429
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,800
General Qin,

430
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,480
I'll leave A Yan to you.

431
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,080
God bless me.

432
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,560
I'll be the first to be killed.

433
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,040
Stop.

434
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,040
What did I

435
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,320
come across just now?

436
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,760
So soft...

437
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,540
similar to a Supporting reliablewolf.

438
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,900
Did I meet a ghost?

439
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,780
Will I die?

440
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,500
Here you are.

441
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,820
What's this?

442
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,620
There's a ghost here.

443
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,380
If you meet it, you'll die.

444
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,380
I see.

445
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,820
This is the Spider of Qujie.

446
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,300
Thank you, Senior.

447
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,340
Let's go.

448
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,940
The medicine is really bitter.

449
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,380
But it's your good intention.

450
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,860
I'd better bear it.

451
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:14,940
It's strange.

452
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:18,340
Why does the Spider of Qujie have the smell of the yellow lotus?

453
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,340
Senior.

454
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,980
What's going on?

455
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:25,860
This...

456
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,340
It's you.

457
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,860
Why did you come to save me?

458
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,660
I'd come to save anyone.

459
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,740
The Sixth Brother came to the mountain

460
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,580
because he worshiped me.

461
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,660
I can't let anyone of you

462
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,060
get hurt.

463
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,660
You're so nice.

464
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,260
I think you're the one who

465
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,860
wanted to get me killed.

466
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,580
I'm afraid that it'll be too big and hard to clean up.

467
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,940
That's why I came to save you.

468
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,940
Whatever you think.

469
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,540
What's wrong with the yellow lotus?

470
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,500
I just want you to shut up.

471
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,780
So you thought I was a coward?

472
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,940
There was no danger just now.

473
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,260
But you made me eat such bitter food.

474
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,500
You made me eat such bitter food.

475
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:24,100
It wasn't the Ghost Sister just now.

476
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,700
What is it then?

477
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,380
Forget it.

478
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,180
Let's forget about it.

479
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,620
Whatever you think.

480
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,300
Stop!

481
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,300
Since we've escaped from danger,

482
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,980
why don't we split up into two groups?

483
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,540
Each group will go out.

484
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,900
Anyway, if you want to slander me,

485
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,740
I don't want to be with you.

486
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:12,900
You!

487
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,780
Don't follow me.

488
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,140
I have to think about it.

489
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,740
I'll leave now.

490
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,780
Goodbye.

491
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,300
I am the Young Master.

492
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,340
Do not disturb her.

493
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,580
Try our best.

494
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,780
Do not disturb her, do not disturb her.

495
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,820
Young Master, of course I will do that.

496
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:50,700
I promise you,

497
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,020
I will use this opportunity

498
00:31:54,380 --> 00:32:01,580
to finally make UCA

499
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:02,660
my first place.

500
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,540
Come back and stay.

501
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,300
Don't forget,

502
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,700
there is no one in Europe

503
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,380
who has the ability to protect GO.

504
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,500
Do you want to go back?

505
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:12,660
You're asking now,

506
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,540
Do we have to go through it?

507
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,940
You can fly, right?

508
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:20,140
Chaos is not within any realm of magic.

509
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:23,180
Here, I can't use magic.

510
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,620
It's cold.

511
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,620
And here too,

512
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:15,820
?

513
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,260
Run!

514
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,560
Yi Yi.

515
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,740
Yi Yi.

516
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,820
Come in.

517
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,020
Yi Yi.

518
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,800
Yi Yi.

519
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,580
Yi Yi.

520
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,760
Yi Yi.

521
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,400
Yi Yi.

522
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:58,980
Yi Yi.

523
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,660
Yi Yi.

524
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,340
Yi Yi.

525
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,900
Yi Yi.

526
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,240
Yi Yi.

527
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,300
Yi Yi.

528
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,660
Yi Yi.

529
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,060
to resist external attacks.

530
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,500
But if I close it,

531
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,340
it's just a bud.

532
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,100
It can only be used to fight back with brute force.

533
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,460
Have you not seen

534
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,660
how I used it all the way?

535
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:28,900
I...

536
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,900
I broke it.

537
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,820
What should I do?

538
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,460
What else can you do?

539
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:54,220
Can I

540
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,140
stay with you?

541
00:34:59,140 --> 00:34:59,780
What?

542
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,980
The magic weapon I used to stay with you.

543
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:07,980
I'm sorry.

544
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,660
You're not sorry for me.

545
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,180
You're sorry for yourself.

546
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,500
You don't want to take me as your teacher.

547
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,420
I won't take you as my disciple either.

548
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,540
Although you're not sincere about your teacher,

549
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,100
you can't even laugh at

550
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,100
how I used the magic weapon.

551
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,260
So,

552
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,060
you were angry just now

553
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,380
because I didn't learn it

554
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,780
and I broke your magic weapon.

555
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,660
Magic weapon is an external object.

556
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,660
How could I break it?

557
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:39,860
So,

558
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,940
I'm more important than the magic weapon.

559
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,180
Ridiculous.

560
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,580
Human life

561
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,700
is more important than the magic weapon.

562
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,140
What's this?

563
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,300
De-m 형e

564
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,460
Come up here.

565
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:42,660
I didn't do it on purpose just now.

566
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,580
What's going on?

567
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:57,860
It looks like

568
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,180
she was influenced

569
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,180
by our previous weakness.

570
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,460
She's reacting at her own pace.

571
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,620
Right,

572
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,440
Looks like I'm wrong.

573
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:32,580
The

574
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,560
lie I told you is not a lie.

575
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:35,820
Yeah?

576
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,200
You look like being prepared.

577
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,860
Stop qualitatively examining me

578
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,340
게 poetic

579
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,420
Maybe

580
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,180
I must be stricken by despair

581
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,820
So distressed

582
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,500
Nope

583
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:54,140
How am I to liberate my emotions?

584
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:55,580
Tihong

585
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,700
How to stop the blood

586
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:03,120
how to end this

587
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,160
oppressed

588
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,100
other

589
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:06,960
you

590
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,000
Although I only have one face

591
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,600
like His Highness,

592
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,280
I'll never forget

593
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,760
his beauty.

594
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,640
It's your turn.

595
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,480
And his beauty

596
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,240
is in my heart forever.

597
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,080
My mother

598
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,520
often made pastries for me when young.

599
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,760
It tasted good.

600
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,160
It melted in my mouth.

601
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,880
Father was against my cultivation when I was young.

602
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,160
He always said

603
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,400
that it's not good for girls to use swords and swords.

604
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:11,760
But

605
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,040
ever since I came back from Jialan City,

606
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,080
he changed his mind

607
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,160
after hearing the words of the Crown Prince.

608
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,560
Sometimes,

609
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,360
he would even instruct me personally.

610
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,640
Once Upon a Time Solitary Kyosho

611
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,760
I can't remember.

612
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,120
You die.

613
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,200
Why does he have Sn ingredients

614
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,480
on the planet,

615
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,080
and he is always a lonely man

616
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,800
with a thousand miles away from home?

617
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,120
Every spring,

618
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,240
해야n capitphone will make a kite

619
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:02,240
and take me and Yufei to the grasslands.

620
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,200
The kite on the side of the house is big and light.

621
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,520
It's not the same every year.

622
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,880
And Yufei is the best singer on the grassland.

623
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,120
Do you know?

624
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,840
Every time during the festival,

625
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,960
we would hold hands around the fire,

626
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,360
watch her sing, dance,

627
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,880
and eat roasted lamb.

628
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:22,720
By the way,

629
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,200
I have another friend called Xu Ying.

630
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,760
She was born in Jialan Imperial City.

631
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,760
She is very innocent.

632
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,920
She is very gentle and cute.

633
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,000
Father, mother, son,

634
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,520
Yuan, Yufei, and Xu Ying.

635
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,560
I've told you all of them.

636
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,760
Is there anything else that makes you happy?

637
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:09,680
By the way,

638
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,480
there's one more thing.

639
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,080
Later, I met you in Mount Jiuyi.

640
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,560
Is this

641
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,600
something that makes you happy?

642
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,080
Oh no!

643
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,000
I'm in trouble!

644
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,040
I'm in trouble!

645
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,040
I'm in trouble!

646
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,080
I'm in trouble!

647
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,080
I'm in trouble!

648
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,200
I'm in trouble!

649
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,320
I'm in trouble!

650
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,440
I'm in trouble!

651
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,080
I'm in trouble!

652
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,160
I said something wrong!

653
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,320
The bridge must be broken!

654
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,360
Let's run!

655
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,120
What's going on?

656
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,680
At that time,

657
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,480
you treated me like that.

658
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,600
I swore I would never see you again.

659
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,720
But why

660
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,160
did this bridge of good intentions come out?

661
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,120
Let's go.

662
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:22,680
Grade Tenاه

663
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,040
I wonder,

664
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,680
does the road at the beginning

665
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,920
also mean you meant it?

666
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,920
Does this memory

667
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,960
make you happy?

668
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,200
Good.

669
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,160
You finally made me angry.

670
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,880
You're really happy.

671
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,120
Let's go.

672
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:49,920
I'm sorry.

673
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:50,920
I'm sorry.

674
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:51,920
I'm sorry.

675
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:52,920
I'm sorry.

676
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:53,920
I'm sorry.

677
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:54,920
I'm sorry.

678
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:55,920
I'm sorry.

679
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:56,920
I'm sorry.

680
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:57,920
I'm sorry.

681
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:58,920
I'm sorry.

682
00:44:58,920 --> 00:44:59,920
I'm sorry.

683
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:00,920
I'm sorry.

684
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:01,920
I'm sorry.

685
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:02,920
I'm sorry.

686
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:03,920
I'm sorry.

687
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:04,920
I'm sorry.

688
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:05,920
I'm sorry.

689
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:06,920
I'm sorry.

690
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:07,920
I'm sorry.

691
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:08,920
I'm sorry.

692
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:09,920
I'm sorry.

693
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:10,920
I'm sorry.

694
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:11,920
I'm sorry.

695
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:12,920
I'm sorry.

696
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:13,920
I'm sorry.

697
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:14,920
I'm sorry.

698
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:15,920
I'm sorry.

699
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:16,920
I'm sorry.

700
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:17,920
I'm sorry.

701
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,680
Every time I miss you.

702
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:30,580
Sometimes, I want to grams me CR's but conditions weakening at 1550's

703
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:35,080
This dream is changeable light with no deep and sky-blue sky

704
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,160
This story still beautiful because of the love

705
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,080
Song takes the Sydney washed deep in ice

706
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,340
And deep at 200's

707
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:43,000
Red and the blue sick as red while red

708
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,080
My hand is broken

709
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,880
compare my heart and your heart

710
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:50,720
anxiety

711
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:53,660
are soous
