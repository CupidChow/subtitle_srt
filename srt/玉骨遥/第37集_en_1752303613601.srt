I want to be the wind that you made

I want to be the wind that you made

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I want to be the wind that you made

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I want to be the wind that you made

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I want to be the wind that you made

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I want to be the wind that you made

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I want to be the wind that you made

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I want to be the wind that you made

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I want to be the wind that you made

I want to be the wind that you made

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I want to be the wind that you made

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I want to be the wind that you made

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Why did I barge into your sleeve today

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
They seem to have lost their direction

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,040
it has always been the fight between soft-hearted and decisive.

47
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,000
In this world,

48
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,560
no one is alone.

🎵 масс bermini 고 Mohammad's cheek never dried🎵

It's you?

57
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,900
Heir Apparent!

58
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Your Highness!

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Princess, you're awake.

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Where's Shifu?

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Shao Simin woke up today at this time.

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
He's going to Jiuyi County.

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Lord Chongming went with him.

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Why did I fall asleep?

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Shao Simin lit a few incense for you last night.

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
He thinks you're too tired.

67
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
He wants you to have a good rest.

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Jiuyi County?

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
At Jiuyi County, you clearly...

70
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Oh no.

71
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Shifu must have found something wrong

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
and is going to Jiuyi County to ask about my identity.

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Don't worry, Princess.

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
With Lord Chongming around,

75
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
there should be no problem.

76
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Princess, it's raining outside.

77
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Take an umbrella.

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Jiuyi County has been searched.

79
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Where did Shifu and the others go?

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I don't know.

81
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I don't know.

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I don't know.

83
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I don't know.

84
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Where did Shifu and the others go?

85
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Your Highness, Chongming.

86
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
This...

87
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Your Highness.

88
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Why are you so tired?

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's all my fault.

90
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I didn't explain it to you.

91
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
He said he wanted to find some herbs

92
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
that can cure the allergy.

93
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So he brought him here.

94
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I really want to know

95
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
what happened to us.

96
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
This feeling

97
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
is one more moment with you.

98
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's one more point.

99
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
But

100
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
those things that belong to you and me,

101
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I just want you to tell me personally.

102
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Or I'll remember it by myself.

103
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I won't pretend to be someone else.

104
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So...

105
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Don't worry.

106
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Thank you.

107
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Tonight, I'll treat you to a drink.

108
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
For this umbrella?

109
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
For this fruit.

110
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Luckily, this is the last day.

111
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You can rest in peace.

112
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Zhu Yan,

113
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
on the last day,

114
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
you need to take Shiyi

115
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
to the Fanyin Lake.

116
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You can try the blood of the Star-repearing Star.

117
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
By then,

118
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
you'll be in peace.

119
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
The seven-medicine Xuanlang in the Fanyin Lake

120
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
will be the only thing that can save you.

121
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm sure

122
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
you'll be able to do it.

123
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm sure.

124
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'm sure.

125
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
The seven-medicine Xuanlang in the Fanyin Lake

126
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
will be the only thing that can save you.

127
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Why are you sighing?

128
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I heard about it

129
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
in the legend of the West Lake.

130
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
The West Lake is good,

131
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
but it's in the dusk.

132
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Although it's good,

133
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
it's too sad.

134
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
In my opinion,

135
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
it's because

136
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
the West Lake is good,

137
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
and it's the same as the military.

138
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I can't believe it.

139
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm not sure

140
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
the West Lake is as good as the military.

141
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm not sure

142
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
the West Lake is as good as the military.

143
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I can't believe

144
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
the West Lake is as good as the military.

145
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I want to say

146
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
although I don't remember

147
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
what happened to us,

148
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
but this thought

149
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
is getting clearer

150
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
in my mind.

151
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,040
I just want to drink with you.

152
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:48,640
Drink...

153
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,440
Master's soul

154
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,120
has been turned into a flower.

155
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,880
It will never be shaken again.

156
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,400
Let me

157
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,240
bear with it for the last time.

158
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,120
I want to dance for you.

159
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,760
Let's go.

160
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,560
You used to

161
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,320
dance for me,

162
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,640
right?

163
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,080
Just now,

164
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,800
it was like...

165
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,360
It was like it was imprinted in my mind.

166
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,840
You...

167
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,000
We loved each other,

168
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,040
right?

169
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,480
I just wanted to say

170
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,960
that we've been like this for our whole lives.

171
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,920
Okay?

172
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,360
We've been like this

173
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,680
for our whole lives.

174
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,600
Okay?

175
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,400
When you wake up tomorrow,

176
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,800
I'll tell you.

177
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,760
It's a deal.

178
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,280
It's a deal.

179
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,880
I can't stop this love.

180
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,720
It's all fate.

181
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,480
It's all fate.

182
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,200
Let's make it come true.

183
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,720
Let's make it come true.

184
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,480
It's like fate.

185
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,320
Forget about it.

186
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,840
Let's forget about it.

187
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,760
Let's bury the past.

188
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,640
Let's forget about it.

189
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,040
Let's forget about it.

190
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,000
Let's forget about it.

191
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:26,160
Because of you, I lost myself in planes and

192
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:31,720
didn't even get to see the new sky.

193
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,160
I immediately felt

194
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,820
But how would you laugh at me?

195
00:14:44,220 --> 00:15:08,940
Thank you, my

196
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,920
you may lose your hearing and vision.

197
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:20,800
Zhu Yan.

198
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,400
Are you okay?

199
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,800
Go to rest.

200
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,240
Leave the rest to me.

201
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,680
My wife is good at'shurt.

202
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,140
Herises.

203
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,440
Such as these twoiving'

204
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,300
City of bedu'ds.

205
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,620
Your sons

206
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,920
Asly

207
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,500
You don't blame me for your wife's mess me.

208
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,120
And asly

209
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,820
Of Lift your eyes.

210
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,680
You stop угing me.

211
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,600
You are here.

212
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,360
Zhu Yan, you...

213
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,480
You really...

214
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,240
You...

215
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,560
It seems that

216
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,560
he really wants your life.

217
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,640
You want my life?

218
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,000
I really want your life.

219
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,000
There are many people who want your life.

220
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,880
Your guards were too quick to eat,

221
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,480
and caused the empty funeral.

222
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,880
The only empress who was loyal to you

223
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,280
was killed by you.

224
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,120
The only heir who was loyal to you

225
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,520
was also driven away by you.

226
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,880
But why did you

227
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,960
make a wish for me?

228
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,560
I understand.

229
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,480
You want to

230
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,960
avenge Bai Yan.

231
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:38,920
Shut up!

232
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,280
I don't want to hear

233
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,680
his name from your mouth.

234
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,400
I made a wish for you

235
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,000
to

236
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,680
give Bai Yan and Ying'er

237
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,840
a fair return.

238
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,320
Why can't I see anything?

239
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,160
In the end,

240
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,080
you may even lose

241
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,360
your hearing and vision.

242
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,080
No.

243
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,000
I can't let him see me like this.

244
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,320
Go.

245
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:42,680
Go.

246
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:45,960
Go!

247
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,640
Go.

248
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,160
Your Majesty.

249
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,480
How dare you poison me?

250
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,320
I'm wronged.

251
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,760
I'm wronged, Your Majesty.

252
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,240
This Minister Da

253
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,840
hasn't come back to the palace for more than ten years.

254
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:14,960
Now,

255
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,360
when you were sick,

256
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,520
he showed up immediately.

257
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,080
He just wants to frame me.

258
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,120
His purpose

259
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,080
is to repel me.

260
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,400
In fact,

261
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,600
he wants to break his way for Xu Yongji.

262
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,320
I don't want

263
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,840
Ying'er to come back to me.

264
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,240
What?

265
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,040
You are the bitch.

266
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,760
You are the bitch who poisoned me.

267
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,040
I...

268
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,440
I must kill you today.

269
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,320
I...

270
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,040
I must kill you.

271
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,040
Your Majesty,

272
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,720
I can die.

273
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,800
But I have a condition.

274
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,760
I beg you.

275
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,880
I will take all the blame.

276
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,480
I just hope

277
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,960
you won't be angry with me.

278
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,640
I didn't expect

279
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,000
I didn't

280
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,280
know

281
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
so many things

282
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
were done by this bitch.

283
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,400
I

284
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,200
have nothing to say.

285
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,640
She lied to you?

286
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,400
She knew

287
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,040
there were many things in it.

288
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,400
But for your great love,

289
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,880
she let Yan and Ying'er

290
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,720
suffer such a bad fate.

291
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,600
Now the truth is out.

292
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,640
I know

293
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,640
I'm sorry for Bai Yan.

294
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,240
What are you waiting for?

295
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,880
Send the edict

296
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,480
to clear their name.

297
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,640
Okay.

298
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,000
I promise you.

299
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,040
I can

300
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,960
restore Shiyi

301
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,680
and the crown prince's identity.

302
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,560
But do you really

303
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,480
plan to

304
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,440
stop her from taking off the robe?

305
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,040
Take off the robe

306
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,960
and go back to this dirty palace?

307
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,200
And you,

308
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,120
the bastard who killed her mother

309
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,600
and her father?

310
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,320
I just want to let Ying'er

311
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,960
live a long life

312
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,280
without illness

313
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,080
and live a long life.

314
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:51,960
Father,

315
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,280
we are brothers.

316
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,240
I beg you.

317
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,560
Can you...

318
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,680
Can you let Ying'er come back

319
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,560
and take your father?

320
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,920
No way!

321
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,600
Guards.

322
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,680
Yes.

323
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,520
Send my edict

324
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,160
to take the title of Prince Qin

325
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,080
and make him a commoner

326
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,520
like Bai Yan,

327
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,360
Shi Hao, the empress of the Ren family.

328
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,640
Take his legacy

329
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,960
and sign it in the imperial treasury

330
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,640
and sign it in the crown prince's name.

331
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,520
Shiyi,

332
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,920
I am sorry.

333
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,640
From now on,

334
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,040
you can restore the title of Prince.

335
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,880
Yes.

336
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,320
His dream has already been in the $بحalahkg negative classification,

337
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,360
the dessert he loves more.

338
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:12,920
I heard of this

339
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:13,560
for three years.

340
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,440
He became unconscious for three days.

341
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,320
What did he happen?

342
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,080
Xue Lu,

343
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,600
do you have any idea?

344
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,600
I've tried all the methods in the medical books.

345
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,600
But none of them worked.

346
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,600
It's clear that

347
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,600
his illness wasn't caused by external forces.

348
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,600
There's only one possibility.

349
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,600
What is it?

350
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,600
Unless the one Zhu Yan got

351
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,600
wasn't a disease from the mortal world,

352
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,600
the medicine was useless.

353
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,600
Do you still remember

354
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,600
the clothes he wore when we met Zhu Yan?

355
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,600
Zhu Yan!

356
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,600
Zhu Yan!

357
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,600
Zhu Yan, what's wrong?

358
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,600
Don't send me back to the medical room.

359
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,600
Zhu Yan!

360
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,600
Zhu Yan!

361
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,600
That night,

362
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,600
he couldn't hear or see

363
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,600
and he couldn't recognize us.

364
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,600
That's right.

365
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,600
I saw a record in an ancient book.

366
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,600
If a living person

367
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,600
enters the border of the yin and yang,

368
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,600
and makes any mistakes,

369
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,600
he will be completely lost.

370
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,600
Zhu Yan's symptoms are very similar.

371
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,600
If you're right,

372
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,600
the only thing that can save his life

373
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,600
is not medical skills, but magic.

374
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,600
But he won't let us

375
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,600
send him to the Nine-Wear Mountain.

376
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,600
It must be the Youngest Si Ming

377
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,600
and him

378
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,600
who are the most important people in the world.

379
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,600
What's wrong with them?

380
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,600
It's just that he's like this now.

381
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,600
He can't stand the pain.

382
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,600
Is there a cure for this?

383
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,600
The human sense is different from the five-star.

384
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,600
The wood belongs to the wood.

385
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,600
You made it yourself.

386
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,600
The water belongs to the water.

387
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,600
The white team is close to the lake,

388
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,600
so they are good at water magic.

389
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,600
If they work together,

390
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,600
Zhu Yan can be saved.

391
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,600
Then, I'll do it.

392
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,600
The heavenly object has a soul.

393
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,600
The ten-time magic

394
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,600
needs to be used to

395
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,600
purify the magical treasure.

396
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,600
Fortunately, Bai Fengming

397
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,600
gave me the four-star soul.

398
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,600
Qinggang,

399
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,600
take out your sword.

400
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,600
This sword was given to me by the Youngest Si Ming.

401
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,600
It's not a Qing clan's treasure.

402
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,600
I'm a member of the Qing clan.

403
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,600
I'm a man of the West.

404
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,600
I've never got

405
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,600
a treasure from the tribe.

406
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,600
I'll go and borrow it now.

407
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,600
Is it too late?

408
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,600
I can't get a treasure from the tribe.

409
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,600
The tribe?

410
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,600
You have one.

411
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,600
But you gave it to me.

412
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,600
Xue Lu.

413
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,600
I have the best treasure

414
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,600
of the Qing clan.

415
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,600
I don't need anything else.

416
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,600
I'm going to the tribe.

417
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,600
I'll go with you.

418
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,600
I'll go with you.

419
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,600
I'll go with you.

420
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,600
I'll go with you.

421
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,600
I'll go with you.

422
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,600
I'll go with you.

423
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,600
I'll go with you.

424
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,600
I'll go with you.

425
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,600
I'll go with you.

426
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,600
I'll go with you.

427
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,600
I'll go with you.

428
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,600
I'll go with you.

429
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,600
I'll go with you.

430
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,600
I'll go with you.

431
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,600
I'll go with you.

432
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,600
I'll go with you.

433
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,600
You provided

434
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,600
the Qing clan with the weapon.

435
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,600
You're from the ice clan?

436
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:44,200
I am the leader of the Ice Tribe, Wu Xian.

437
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,000
I am here at the order of my master.

438
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,200
I am the leader of the Nine City, Xiao Qi Jiang.

439
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,760
Aren't you afraid that I'll punish you

440
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,840
by giving you to His Majesty?

441
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,000
You can only be in trouble forever

442
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,080
if you work with my master.

443
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,800
You always say that

444
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,440
your master...

445
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,320
Who is your master?

446
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,320
Where is he?

447
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,440
You...

448
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,480
You'll know when you agree to work with me.

449
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,800
Back then,

450
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,160
you assassinated Shi Ying.

451
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,800
Your Ice Tribe is a general who lost his troops.

452
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,200
Shi Ying was still safe and sound in the end.

453
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,600
I didn't kill him

454
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,400
because the time hadn't come yet.

455
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,560
If Luo Xi was killed,

456
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,600
the Green Tribe would be in trouble.

457
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,400
How can I cooperate with her

458
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,400
to let the Wu Tribe enter the empty grave?

459
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,120
Now my master has no worries about the future.

460
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,440
He can send out the food to help you

461
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,360
and get what he wants.

462
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,840
Why did your master choose me?

463
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,400
What does he want?

464
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,400
He took my master to the White Tower of Jialan.

465
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,040
It must be a great favor

466
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,880
for you.

467
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,600
You want the Imperial Ring, don't you?

468
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,560
It's the sacred item that contains the power of ancient times.

469
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,440
Only the Emperor's blood

470
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,280
can be the choice of the Goddess.

471
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,000
What do you want it for?

472
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,680
My master is interested in the empty grave.

473
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,400
He wants to take the sacred item and open his eyes.

474
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,520
Where is your master?

475
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,840
vä här ä ä

476
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,340
You are...

477
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:48,040
You want to take

478
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,080
your master's secret.

479
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,360
Who the hell are you?

480
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,140
Just take�

481
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,140
You

482
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,700
What a fright

483
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,180
What did you say

484
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:21,500
Chooming

485
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,180
Why are you here

486
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,540
Not

487
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,740
Not Deathswind

488
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,720
I'm not dead yet.

489
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,800
You're awake.

490
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,280
It's because of the Star-Glowing Snow.

491
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,400
It's more than ten days away from the Star Sea Cloud Pond.

492
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,680
The Star-Glowing Snow.

493
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,360
The Star-Glowing Snow.

494
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,600
It's Yan'er.

495
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,760
It's Yan'er, right?

496
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,480
How is she?

497
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,440
Where is she?

498
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,680
She's not here.

499
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,200
She's not here.

500
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:03,840
Yan'er.

501
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,640
She only used three days

502
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,480
to get through the Star-Glowing Snow.

503
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,720
Then she sacrificed half of her life to save you.

504
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,760
You still have twenty-seven years to live.

505
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,960
She went down the mountain because she saw you were fine.

506
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,920
She asked me to tell you

507
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:25,920
to take care of each other.

508
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,440
You don't have to worry about her.

509
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,800
I'll wait.

510
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,880
It's Master, right?

511
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,720
It's Master who forced her.

512
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,160
She shouldn't have promised.

513
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,120
I've let her down.

514
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,880
I killed the man I loved.

515
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,800
But I was closer to her by dying.

516
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,400
I know you're worried about Zhu Yan.

517
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,280
But you killed Zhiyuan for the world.

518
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,320
Besides,

519
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,920
you died because of him.

520
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,920
You know him very well.

521
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,120
If you don't let him save you,

522
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,520
he will never be at peace.

523
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:19,960
Anyway,

524
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,200
he hurt you

525
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,840
and saved you.

526
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,400
You two are a match made in heaven.

527
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,240
Kewei,

528
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,560
you deserve it.

529
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,880
You deserve it.

530
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,120
He hates me,

531
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,920
but he didn't forgive me.

532
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,800
Otherwise,

533
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,960
he wouldn't even come to see me.

534
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,280
That's good.

535
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,520
I don't know

536
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,760
what kind of face I should use.

537
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,880
I'll come to see him.

538
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,280
Shiying, where are you going?

539
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:10,880
Shiying.

540
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,280
I want to be alone.

541
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,840
What are you doing?

542
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:02,960
A few days ago,

543
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,240
Miss Zhu Yan made a bowl of snow rice cake

544
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,240
and shared it with me.

545
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,240
It was very delicious.

546
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,920
So I asked her for a prescription.

547
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,240
But I didn't expect

548
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,280
it was too hard to control the fire.

549
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,680
Come on, look.

550
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,160
Young Si Ming, it's you.

551
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:17,960
You're awake.

552
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,480
You just said

553
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,400
Zhu Yan has been in a bad mood

554
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,560
for the past few days.

555
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,760
I'm sorry.

556
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:25,680
I'm sorry.

557
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,520
I'm sorry.

558
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,400
I'm sorry.

559
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,360
I'm sorry.

560
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,280
I'm sorry.

561
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,240
I'm sorry.

562
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,200
Zhu Yan has been on the mountain

563
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,360
for the past few days.

564
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,120
She even made a bowl of snow rice cake.

565
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,600
Why did she make it?

566
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,080
Well...

567
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,040
I don't know.

568
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,000
You want me to take you

569
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,200
to see Si Ming.

570
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,680
That's why you said it, right?

571
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,840
Let me tell you.

572
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,320
In fact,

573
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,560
Young Si Ming woke up a few days ago.

574
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,920
But he lost his memory for some reason.

575
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,280
Miss Zhu Yan was by your side.

576
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,400
She took care of you

577
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,080
for three days and nights

578
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,800
without any help.

579
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,440
I don't know anything else.

580
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,680
Why did you ask me to stay here?

581
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,200
Because in this place,

582
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,240
I remember everything.

583
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,040
I'm here

584
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,240
to be the prince

585
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,040
and be part of the famous

586
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,920
amous culture of Cang borrowiness family.

587
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,400
But as for Chu and Vao,

588
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,160
I'm just being an관 clear.

589
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,680
How about you

590
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,080
I've been with him for three days.

591
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,440
He danced the last dance

592
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,680
for me here.

593
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,120
Right?

594
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,280
The Fanyin Lake

595
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,000
is the place where Yan'er and I first met.

596
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,040
If Yan'er wants to end my relationship with me,

597
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,640
she will choose this place.

598
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,840
You remember everything?

599
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,360
Why are you guys hiding this from me?

600
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,080
Why are you hiding it from me?

601
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,080
Shuyan, she...

602
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,040
She already knew about the fate.

603
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,360
She was worried that if she got you involved,

604
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,800
she would choose to leave.

605
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,200
So she hid it from you.

606
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,960
She wanted to end your relationship with her.

607
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:48,600
She...

608
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,360
She wanted to end your relationship with her.

609
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,960
She wanted to end your relationship with her.

610
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,240
She wanted to end your relationship with her.

611
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:53,920
She...

612
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,440
No.

613
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,320
How could you remember it?

614
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:00,920
Da Siming said that

615
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,840
you wouldn't remember it for the past three days.

616
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,200
Yan'er's feelings for me?

617
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,280
What feelings?

618
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,600
Didn't you remember it?

619
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:10,840
Tell me.

620
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,280
What feelings?

621
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,760
You lied to me.

622
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,200
Although I lost my memory,

623
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,520
I didn't lose my heart.

624
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,520
Right.

625
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:31,640
She used half of her life to save me.

626
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,280
She took care of me for three days without hesitation.

627
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,720
She made me a snowman.

628
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,720
She danced for me.

629
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,240
Although she said that she liked Zhiyuan the most,

630
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,040
the one who let her give her everything

631
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,080
was me.

632
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:58,520
So Yan'er's lover is me, right?

633
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,720
She said that she liked Zhiyuan the most

634
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,360
just to save her.

635
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,440
Chu Ming.

636
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,320
I never begged you in my life.

637
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,720
This is the only time in my life

638
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,560
that I beg you to tell me the truth.

639
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,240
I'll go to find her now.

640
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,000
But there's not so much to prove.

641
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,480
Since Yan'er is willing to use half of her life

642
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,000
to save me,

643
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,840
why can't I be like her

644
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,240
and fight for our feelings

645
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,240
for once again?

646
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,760
She can do nothing to stop me.

647
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,400
How can I stop her?

648
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:40,960
Yan'er.

649
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,480
Yan'er.

650
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,080
Yan'er.

651
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,000
Yan'er.

652
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:47,800
Yan'er.

653
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:48,560
Yan'er.

654
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,360
Yan'er.

655
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,000
Your Majesty.

656
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,760
It's good that you're fine.

657
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,760
I'm worried about you.

658
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,680
Yan'er.

659
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,120
It was my fault before.

660
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,840
I shouldn't have forced you to return to Hongchen.

661
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,440
I've thought about it.

662
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,320
In the future, you can stay in the mountain

663
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,720
and do the same as before.

664
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,840
I'll make you the first person

665
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,760
who came to Jiuyi Mountain.

666
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,840
Zhu Yan is your sister.

667
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,800
You can't go to her.

668
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,800
I won't let you

669
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,360
risk your life again.

670
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,040
I died because of Yan'er.

671
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,600
But I also died because of her.

672
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:00,000
The fate can be changed.

673
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,480
Everything is in the hands of people.

674
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,440
No.

675
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,960
I won't allow it.

676
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,480
Your Majesty, you raised me,

677
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,160
taught me,

678
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,880
and dedicated your life

679
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,400
for me.

680
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,760
Now you still care about me.

681
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,320
I'm grateful.

682
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,400
But Your Majesty,

683
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:33,960
I've died once.

684
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,120
Knowing what is most important to me

685
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,800
is what I want to accompany and take care of her.

686
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,920
I don't want to waste her time

687
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,800
giving me the life I want.

688
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,480
I don't want to waste my second life

689
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,520
even for a moment.

690
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:54,480
I've lost my reputation in the past.

691
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,760
I don't want to

692
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,520
care about the one I love in this life.

693
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,400
Please let me go to hell

694
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,680
and return to Yan'er.

695
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,000
Yes.

696
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,160
Come on in.

697
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,200
and my life.

698
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:44,640
In the past,

699
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,680
my entire life has been trying to strangle you.

700
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,000
From now on,

701
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,320
you have your own decision.

702
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,280
Thank you, True Master.

703
00:43:59,200 --> 00:43:59,760
Si Niu.

704
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,760
I'll kill you!

705
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:34,760
Why is this the world?

706
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:39,760
Why are the flowers and snow so beautiful?

707
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,760
Love and hate are not clear.

708
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,760
Why is this world so deep?

709
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:54,760
Why is this world so far away?

710
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,760
Why is this world so different?

711
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,760
The more beautiful the moon is, the more hurtful the tears are.

712
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,760
The bottom line in your heart,

713
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:14,760
a wind that dares to touch my soul.

714
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,760
Lock me in the heart of your kiss,

715
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:24,760
not leaving you.

716
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,760
The bottom line in your heart,

717
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:34,760
a wind that dares to touch my soul.

718
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,760
The feelings can be stored,

719
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,760
you and I will not be in the same face.

720
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:48,760
The bottom line in your heart,

721
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,760
a wind that dares to touch my soul.

722
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:58,760
Lock me in the heart of your kiss,

723
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,760
not leaving you.

724
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:08,760
The bottom line in your heart,

725
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,760
a wind that dares to touch my soul.

726
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:18,760
The feelings can be stored,

727
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,760
you and I will not be in the same face.
