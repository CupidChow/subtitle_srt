1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I want to spend the rest of my life with you

2
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Please give me a life of shining fortune

3
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I am a piece of jade, a piece of jade

4
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I am not a piece of heaven

5
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
But I will give you my whole life

6
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I will give you my whole life

7
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I am a piece of jade, a piece of jade

8
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I want to spend the first time with you

9
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
In my heart

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I dragged you down

11
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
and you didn't get into the real world

12
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It doesn't matter

13
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
According to your order

14
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
we have taken down all the letters

15
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
that you have sent to the Nine-Mountains

16
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Good job

17
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's still the old rules

18
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Come to get the letter tomorrow

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yes

20
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yan, your letter is so funny

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Chong Ming is beautiful, but the feathers are black

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You are so active, but you can only sleep in bed

23
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I can't help thinking about you two

24
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You are so funny

25
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But you have to take care of yourself

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
and take care of Chong Ming

27
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I heard from Shiyu

28
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
In the southern part of the Nine-Mountains

29
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
there is a female dragon

30
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The concubines in the palace

31
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
use this to make their eyes

32
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's a sacred medicine for shining fortune

33
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Chong Ming

34
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Chong Ming

35
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Chong Ming

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Chong

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Chong Ming

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Chong Ming

39
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Chong Ming

40
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Why are you with the tree?

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Let me see

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's cute

43
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Chong Ming

44
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Should you eat something?

45
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I am starving

46
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I am so hungry

47
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I am starving

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I can't see anyone

49
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Chong Ming

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You have suffered from the fire

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
for several days

52
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You should eat something

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I swear

54
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
No matter what you become

55
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
you will always be the most beautiful bird

56
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Just a bird?

57
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
No

58
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I mean

59
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
when I was in the human form

60
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I was the most handsome young man

61
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Except my master

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You are so smart

63
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You really won't laugh at me?

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Of course

65
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You should eat something now

66
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
and drink some fish soup

67
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It smells so good

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It smells so good

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I cooked fish soup for two hours

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's so delicious

71
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's so nutritious

72
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Give it to me

73
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Slow down

74
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The gods and beasts on the mountain

75
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
will keep going through the festival

76
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
as long as they are alive

77
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
A thousand years of festival

78
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
and a hundred years of festival

79
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I have experienced

80
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
such a festival a hundred times

81
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's like a thunder and fire festival

82
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It will be over in a second

83
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I am so annoyed

84
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
with the fire every time

85
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It will burn my beautiful feathers

86
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I am so annoyed

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's been half a year since I had a seed

88
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Slow down

89
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The goddesses in the palace

90
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
use this to help with the inflammation

91
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's a holy medicine for the hair

92
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I think it can help the insects

93
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
to recover their inflammation

94
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Is it not enough?

95
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I can make more for you

96
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
One more bowl

97
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
No, no, no, two more bowls

98
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I am so annoyed

99
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
with the fire every time

100
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's a holy medicine for the hair

101
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I think it can help the insects

102
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
to recover their inflammation

103
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's a holy medicine for the hair

104
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I think it can help the insects

105
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
to recover their inflammation

106
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's a holy medicine for the hair

107
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I think it can help the insects

108
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
to recover their inflammation

109
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's a holy medicine for the hair

110
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I think it can help the insects

111
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
to recover their inflammation

112
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's a holy medicine for the hair

113
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I think it can help the insects

114
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
to recover their inflammation

115
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's a holy medicine for the hair

116
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I think it can help the insects

117
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
to recover their inflammation

118
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's a holy medicine for the hair

119
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I think it can help the insects

120
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
to recover their inflammation

121
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's a holy medicine for the hair

122
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I think it can help the insects

123
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
to recover their inflammation

124
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's a holy medicine for the hair

125
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I think it can help the insects

126
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
to recover their inflammation

127
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Yin'er

128
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Who are you?

129
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm here to save you

130
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm here to save you

131
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You came for my master

132
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You wanted to take my suit

133
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You just want to die

134
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Even if I die here

135
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I won't let my master come

136
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Young monk, move away

137
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Even if something bad happens

138
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
you can't leave here

139
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
If you can break the forbidden

140
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
you can go up to heaven

141
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
If you break the forbidden

142
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
you will lose your power

143
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Besides, you have more than 30% of power

144
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
If you want to kill the enemy

145
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
you will be in danger

146
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm here to save you

147
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Even if I break the forbidden

148
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I will do whatever I want

149
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You want to stop me?

150
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
If you don't cooperate

151
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
you can use your body to see him

152
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's the same

153
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You should be the ones who should die

154
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Master

155
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You shouldn't come here

156
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
The Ice Tribe

157
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You are the first ones to break the forbidden

158
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Now you are here to take me here

159
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
What do you want?

160
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You were the little god of the forbidden

161
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I should have killed you

162
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I should have killed you

163
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Killed me?

164
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Qing tribe sent people to kill me

165
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You have colluded with Qing tribe

166
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You are about to die

167
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Don't bother about him

168
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You are about to die

169
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You are about to die

170
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Don't bother about him

171
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
The Ice Tribe will be in the forbidden

172
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I will keep you

173
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You will be in the forbidden?

174
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I will let you see the forbidden

175
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Master

176
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
The Stone of Life is the time of winter

177
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
and the time of cold

178
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
The place of life is the place of the Chizu and the Yang

179
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
In the old book of the present

180
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
what was on it

181
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
was the birthday on the coffin

182
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
According to the actual birthday of Zhu Yan

183
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
He is

184
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
the one who was killed

185
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Master

186
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
The Ice Tribe kidnapped Zhu Yan

187
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
and he was killed

188
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
and he was killed

189
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Follow me

190
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Hurry

191
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Master

192
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Have you passed the coffin?

193
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
No

194
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Because of me?

195
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
No

196
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You are in danger because of me

197
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Their target is me

198
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You go back to Jiuyi Mountain and ask for help

199
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
But

200
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Go

201
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Ok

202
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Master

203
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You will die today

204
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
because of the death of Kong Sang

205
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Ying'er

206
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Ying'er

207
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Ying'er

208
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Ying'er, be careful

209
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Ying'er

210
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Ying'er will be in danger if you keep going like this

211
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I can only use the beads

212
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Master

213
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You use the beads

214
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Master

215
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
You should be careful

216
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Ok

217
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,440
no

218
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,760
that was just an purple

219
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,220
master

220
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,760
master

221
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:27,740
when the attack will be like this we can制

222
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,020
Listen to��릴게요

223
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,340
Look at me

224
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:43,020
Let's quickly parties

225
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:43,720
Hurry up.

226
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,740
Kendys?!

227
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,600
We were hit quite a lot last night.

228
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,280
We're about to die.

229
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,500
Six performances actually.

230
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,580
That's sound wine staff mines.

231
00:17:48,700 --> 00:18:10,060
The

232
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,060
I'm not good at magic.

233
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,060
I didn't ask my master

234
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,060
for too much damage.

235
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,060
Luckily, A Yan taught me the Water Spell.

236
00:18:40,060 --> 00:19:06,800
Sprites

237
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,580
You won't repeat the same mistake?

238
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,820
Touch the

239
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:43,060
How long do I have to wait?

240
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,060
How long do I have to wait?

241
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:50,060
How long do I have to wait?

242
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:55,060
Waiting for this little life to turn into a sword

243
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:58,060
But comforts me in the ice

244
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:01,060
When the most beautiful stone is cut

245
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:04,060
When time, when time

246
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:07,060
Only your face

247
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:11,060
I will always stay in the past

248
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:16,060
Waiting for this little life to turn into a sword

249
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:22,060
When the most beautiful stone is cut

250
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:28,060
When the moon and the sky cross the eternal moon

251
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:34,060
I will miss you forever

252
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,060
It's strange

253
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,060
Master didn't change

254
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:45,060
Is it too weak?

255
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,060
Master

256
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:57,060
The situation was urgent just now

257
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,060
I'm sorry

258
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,060
How are you now?

259
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,060
Master

260
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,060
Dragon God

261
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,060
You are Dragon God

262
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,060
Dragon God who has been sealed for thousands of years

263
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,060
It was actually trapped in the abyss of the sky

264
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:48,060
You are the starry earth

265
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,060
The dragon barrier that you have left

266
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:55,060
Do you want the emperor to accompany you to harass me?

267
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:59,060
The abyss of the sky is a place where there are millions of people

268
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,060
Dragon God, you misunderstood

269
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,060
We didn't come to disturb you on purpose

270
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,060
We were ambushed

271
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,060
We were ambushed

272
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,060
I accidentally fell here

273
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,060
Who are you ambushed?

274
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,060
It's the Ice Tribe

275
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,060
My master said they are Ice Tribe people

276
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,060
They want to kill my master

277
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,060
Dragon God, don't ask me why

278
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,060
I didn't understand it myself

279
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,060
Anyway, they pushed us here

280
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:24,060
Dragon God, my master is injured

281
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:27,060
Please, can you send us out?

282
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:33,060
If the Song people ask me to go out

283
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,060
No matter what the breath on my body is

284
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:38,060
It's the breath that trapped me thousands of years ago

285
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,060
Dragon God, you misunderstood

286
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:43,060
My master is the god of Mount Jiuyi

287
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,060
It has nothing to do with the person you want to find

288
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,060
Master

289
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,060
Go quickly

290
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,060
Master

291
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,060
Go

292
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:37,060
It's the protective talisman that A'Yuan gave me

293
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,060
You actually have the dragon blood bone jade

294
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:43,060
You want me to teach the god to protect you, the Song people

295
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:47,060
Are you the one I'm waiting for?

296
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,060
You know me

297
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,060
No

298
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,060
The person I'm waiting for is the daughter of the Bai tribe

299
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,060
Not you

300
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,060
I can eat dragon blood bone jade

301
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:01,060
It has a great relationship with my country

302
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,060
If I kill you

303
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:08,060
I'm afraid it will disrupt the magic of the red side

304
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,060
Dragon God

305
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:12,060
I don't understand a word you said

306
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,060
But as long as I'm here

307
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:16,060
I will never let you hurt my master

308
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:20,060
Go back to where you should be

309
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,060
Master

310
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,060
We finally came out

311
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,060
It's all my fault

312
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,060
I had to step on the dragon

313
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,060
And hurt my master like this

314
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,060
Master

315
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,060
I'll take you back

316
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:08,060
Where am I?

317
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:12,060
You don't show up

318
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:18,060
You and I are only a distance

319
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:21,060
How many lives are there?

320
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,060
It's getting dark

321
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,060
I can't be locked up

322
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:28,060
I have to find a way to get out of here

323
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,060
Master

324
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:33,060
If only I could become Xia Baishou

325
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,060
But in the water

326
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:42,060
There's no way to make you change

327
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:47,060
What should I do?

328
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:53,060
Should I wait a little longer?

329
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:00,060
I'm afraid

330
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,060
Zhongyin

331
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,060
Da Simin

332
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,060
Finally

333
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,060
Ying

334
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,060
Ying

335
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,060
Take Shao Simin back to heal

336
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,060
Yes

337
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,060
Yin Yang Ji Hui

338
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,060
Liuli Hua Xian

339
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,060
Liuli Hua Xian

340
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,060
It's really you

341
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,060
Zhu Yan is also badly injured

342
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:21,060
I've put some spiritual power into him

343
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,060
Take him back to heal

344
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,060
Yes

345
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,060
Yes

346
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,060
Yes

347
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,060
Come

348
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,060
Yin

349
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,060
Yin

350
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,060
Yin

351
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,060
Yin, go

352
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,060
Yin

353
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,060
Xie Tian, Xie Ding, you finally woke up

354
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,060
You've been unconscious for three days and three nights

355
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,060
Do you know?

356
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,060
Come

357
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,060
Come, slow down

358
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,060
How is Zhu Yan?

359
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,060
How is he?

360
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,060
He almost killed you

361
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:21,060
I shouldn't have been so lucky

362
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,060
He saved me

363
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,060
If it weren't for him

364
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:29,060
I would have died in the hands of the sick

365
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,060
But if it weren't for him

366
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,060
How could you go to that female Luo Xi?

367
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:53,060
Da Simin has lost his spiritual power to Zhu Yan

368
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,060
So he can recover

369
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,060
His pulse is balanced

370
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:58,060
He can wake up tomorrow

371
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,060
Such a big thing happened

372
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,060
It's good that you didn't suspect

373
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,060
His heart is seriously injured

374
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,060
It will take some time to recover

375
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,060
Prepare the medicine

376
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,060
It's not good to overdo it

377
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,060
Don't overdo it

378
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,060
Let him rest slowly

379
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,060
By the way

380
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:22,060
Don't forget to add some tonic

381
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,060
He is afraid of bitterness

382
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:48,100
Add some dry

383
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,100
You only care about this girl

384
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,100
Have you ever thought about how long you can recover?

385
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,100
You lost a lot before you broke the mirror

386
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:59,100
I don't know if you can get into the real world in the future

387
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,100
You don't even want to die for her

388
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,100
No

389
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:19,100
You don't like her, do you?

390
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,100
What did you say?

391
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,100
No, I didn't say anything

392
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,100
I just said I thought too much

393
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,100
You are a person who serves the gods

394
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,100
How can you fall in love with a common man?

395
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,100
Don't think about those messy things

396
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,100
By the way

397
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,100
Da Simin is waiting for you in Qingxiu Hall

398
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,100
He said he would heal your wound

399
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,100
You should go back

400
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,100
He really likes Zhu Yan, right?

401
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,100
You are talking nonsense

402
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,100
You are so stubborn

403
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,100
Master

404
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,100
Master

405
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,100
Go

406
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,100
Master

407
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,100
Go

408
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,100
Tell me, you two

409
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,100
You two

410
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,100
You two

411
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,100
You two

412
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,100
Go

413
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,100
Tell me, you two

414
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,100
He risked his life to save you

415
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,100
You risked your life to protect him

416
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,100
You two are in the same boat

417
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:22,100
But you are the one who is in danger

418
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,100
Master

419
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,100
Master

420
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,100
Master

421
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,100
Master

422
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,100
Don't die

423
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,100
I won't let you die

424
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,100
Princess

425
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,100
You are finally awake

426
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,100
How is my master?

427
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,100
Young Master is fine

428
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,100
How is he?

429
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,100
He is fine

430
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,100
How is he?

431
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,100
He is fine

432
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,100
How is he?

433
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,100
He is fine

434
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,100
How is he?

435
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,100
Young Master

436
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,100
Young Master is here to see you this morning

437
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,100
He told me to make this medicine

438
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,100
This medicine

439
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,100
Young Master is worried that you are afraid of suffering

440
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:01,100
He told me to add some liver and stomach fluid

441
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,100
Master is so thoughtful for me

442
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,100
Where is he now?

443
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,100
Young Master should be back to Qingxiu Hall to heal his wound

444
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,100
Princess

445
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,100
Do you have any other orders?

446
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,100
No

447
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,100
Thank you

448
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,100
Xue Ying suggested that I go to the Demon Realm

449
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:27,100
But the Ice Tribe is ambushed here to catch me

450
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:30,100
How can there be such a coincidence?

451
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:35,100
Is it because someone wants to frame me

452
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,100
and think that Master will save me

453
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:41,100
So he imitated Xue Ying's handwriting

454
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,100
and tricked me to go to the Demon Realm

455
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,100
No

456
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,100
I have to write to Xue Ying

457
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:58,100
I saw Dragon God at the bottom of the abyss

458
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,100
I think the medical soldiers in the Nine-Eleven Army

459
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:04,100
and the water in the East and West West are all damaged

460
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,100
They are all caused by Dragon God

461
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,100
They are all caused by Dragon God

462
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:07,660
When the

463
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,100
black magic came

464
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:12,100
I was sure that I would kill Cang Wu

465
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,100
So I also wrote that

466
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,100
there is a wise man behind the Ice Tribe

467
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,100
to plan for them

468
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,100
Master, have you heard about it?

469
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,100
This wise man can make the Ice Tribe

470
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,100
bow down to the dust

471
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:29,100
I think he must be a man who is used to the world

472
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,100
But I have never heard of his rumors

473
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,100
It's like something happened in the sky

474
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:39,100
It seems that the chaos of the air and the sea is already at its peak

475
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:43,100
The Sea King is always making trouble

476
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:47,100
Now Dragon God is awake

477
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:50,100
I'm afraid that the rumors of the return of the sea king

478
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,100
will not be accepted

479
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:57,100
The Sea King will definitely use this to frame the people of the Jiao tribe

480
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:00,100
and cause a bloodshed

481
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:05,100
Ying'er, the one who attacked you before was the Ice Tribe

482
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:09,100
But the one behind must be the Green Tribe

483
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,100
But the Ice Tribe is no longer alone

484
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:15,100
They colluded with the traitors and sacrificed themselves for me

485
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,100
When the world is in chaos

486
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:24,100
Jiuyishan will not be a place for the peace

487
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,100
You need to prepare early

488
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,100
I'm flattered

489
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,100
Don't worry, Master

490
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:33,100
I'm the Young Minister of Jiuyishan

491
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,100
If there is a disaster in Kongsang

492
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:37,100
I will do my best to protect the world

493
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,100
and not let my cultivation down

494
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,100
It's the Green Tribe

495
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:48,100
I'm afraid that the Green Consort will not give up easily

496
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,100
She has already taken over your identity

497
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:53,100
She will definitely kill you

498
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,100
I only have one identity

499
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,100
I'm the Young Minister of Jiuyishan

500
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,100
If the world is in chaos

501
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:02,100
we will be the ones who will be in danger

502
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:06,100
Why is Master related to the Green Consort?

503
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,100
Ying'er

504
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:19,100
This time you have already reached the real world

505
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,100
But because of the old Zhu Yan

506
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,100
you have lost your credit

507
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:28,100
I don't know when I will be able to get Ji Yuan

508
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,100
Don't you regret it?

509
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:36,100
In your heart, is Zhu Yan so important?

510
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:41,100
You don't like her, do you?

511
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,100
When I was in danger

512
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,100
Master saved me

513
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,100
This is the responsibility of the world's master

514
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,100
for the disciples

515
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,100
Zhu Yan died in the hands of the Ice Tribe

516
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,100
because of my care

517
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,100
This is an unexpected disaster

518
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:06,100
I hope you don't make it difficult for him because of this

519
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,100
Who do you think I am?

520
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,100
Don't I understand this?

521
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:16,100
I see that both of you have traces of magic

522
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:19,100
Do you remember what happened during the battle?

523
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:25,100
Master used the bow to help me deal with the damage

524
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:31,100
Such a loyal and righteous person is rare

525
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,100
Ying'er

526
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:37,100
You must treat her well in the future

527
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,100
Don't let her down

528
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:42,100
She saved you with her love and care

529
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:45,100
But I still have to remind you

530
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:48,100
The King and the Consort cannot do anything to you

531
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:51,100
but they may do something to the people around you

532
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,100
If you don't plan ahead

533
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:56,100
Zhu Yan and his Chizhi Clan

534
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,100
will be in a very bad situation

535
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,100
I hope you can help them

536
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,100
I will be very grateful

537
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,100
I will be very grateful

538
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,100
I will be very grateful

539
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,100
I will be very grateful

540
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,100
I will be very grateful

541
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,100
The King and his Chizhi Clan

542
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,100
may be implicated by you

543
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,100
What is my identity?

544
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:23,100
Why are they implicated by me and the Chizhi Clan?

545
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:31,100
The best way is to take off your robe

546
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,100
and return to the capital

547
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:37,100
Now the King and the Consort are confused

548
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,100
Everyone can't stand it

549
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:42,100
If you return to Jialan

550
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,100
and show your identity as the Crown Prince

551
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:47,100
I believe you will be able to win

552
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,100
The Crown Prince?

553
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,100
The Crown Prince?

554
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:57,100
Master is the Crown Prince of that year

555
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:03,100
Take off your robe and go to the hell

556
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:07,100
Shi Ying will lose her magical power

557
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:11,100
What will I use to protect the people of Kongsang?

558
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:16,100
I hope you don't think like that anymore

559
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:29,100
The light in the dark

560
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:33,720
is like a flower with a

561
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,100
How could Yan'er hear that?

562
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,100
I'm afraid so

563
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,100
Impossible

564
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:32,100
The most difficult thing in the world is to be an official

565
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:36,100
Yan'er, I want you to be the most difficult official

566
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,100
until you are willing to go down the mountain for her

567
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:01,100
The Crown Prince of my yearning heart

568
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,100
is actually my master

569
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:13,100
I actually kissed Master

570
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:15,100
I kissed him

571
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,100
I kissed him

572
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,100
I kissed him

573
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,100
I kissed him

574
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,100
I kissed him

575
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:25,100
I kissed him

576
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,100
I kissed him

577
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,100
I kissed Master

578
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,100
I can't think, I can't think

579
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:38,100
I'm afraid that Consort Qing won't give up easily

580
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,100
She will use your identity

581
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:43,100
to get rid of you

582
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:47,100
Even Consort Qing in Jialan knows

583
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,100
my identity

584
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:53,100
But why didn't she tell me?

585
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,100
I advise you

586
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:58,100
Don't waste your life for a ridiculous idea

587
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:01,100
No one deserves you to do this

588
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,100
So

589
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:09,100
Master looks down on his past

590
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:12,100
But I still keep pestering him

591
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,100
I'm so stupid

592
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,100
Yan'er

593
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,100
Yes

594
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,100
Yan'er

595
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:55,100
Yan'er

596
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:14,100
I miss you

597
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:18,100
I miss your heart

598
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:23,100
I miss you

599
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:28,100
I miss you

600
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:32,100
I miss you

601
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:53,100
I miss you
