1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,160
What we years were for

2
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,300
Is both deep and shallow

3
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:42,120
In us has knowledge

4
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,000
and will

5
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:51,360
It falls at the bottom of the heart

6
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,840
I couldn't Lun killing me

7
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,080
We sit next to each other

8
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:27,640
He couldn't even

9
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,920
and the world.

10
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,880
But did you see it?

11
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,160
This world is endless.

12
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,280
These despicable people

13
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,880
don't deserve

14
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,280
your mercy and forgiveness.

15
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,720
I want revenge!

16
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,120
Shi Ying!

17
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,520
Shi Ying, what's wrong?

18
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,600
Get off me!

19
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,560
Chun Hua.

20
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,440
Awesome!

21
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,120
Awesome!

22
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,040
Did I come here

23
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,160
before?

24
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,080
But I haven't seen it before.

25
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,400
Am I CG a dream?

26
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,760
Help!

27
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,200
Master Chong Ming,

28
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,800
what are you doing here?

29
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:13,580
Who?

30
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:17,760
Master Chong Ming?

31
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,140
You...

32
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,220
How did you become мe?

33
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:22,820
Come on.

34
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,320
Chun Hua,

35
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,360
I think I said it before.

36
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,400
This woman has been possessed by the Shadow of the Stone.

37
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,160
Maybe she can save the Shadow of the Stone.

38
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,760
Come on. Follow me.

39
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,680
Where are we going?

40
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,000
Aren't you looking for my former friend?

41
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,800
He's inside.

42
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,800
Who?

43
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,480
He won't let you go.

44
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,160
Under the spell,

45
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,240
I'll let you rest in peace.

46
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,160
I'll avenge you.

47
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,640
Hurry.

48
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,440
Stop!

49
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,200
Stop!

50
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,320
Stop!

51
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,120
Stop!

52
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,600
Ah?

53
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,240
Go away!

54
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,680
Go away!

55
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm not going anywhere.

56
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,760
Hurry up and go outside.

57
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,560
Good.

58
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,080
Three...

59
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,200
A Yan doesn't deserve youribilance.

60
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,160
He doesn't deserve youribilance.

61
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,020
You are finally awake.

62
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,080
You're finally awake.

63
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:21,980
Wait for me,

64
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,780
do you have Sister Qin?

65
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,920
The

66
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,920
The

67
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,920
The

68
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,920
Little Monk,

69
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,920
I always feel like

70
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,920
I've seen you before.

71
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,920
Don't talk.

72
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,920
Don't frown.

73
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,920
If you frown, it won't look good.

74
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,920
I hurt you.

75
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,920
You hit me quite hard.

76
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,920
But it's okay.

77
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,920
My mother said that

78
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,920
I was tough.

79
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,920
I haven't seen my mother for a month.

80
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,920
I already miss her a lot.

81
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,920
What did I just hear you say?

82
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,920
Have you never seen your mother again?

83
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,920
Little Monk.

84
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,920
You...

85
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,920
How are you?

86
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,920
I'll be fine.

87
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,920
No.

88
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,920
You and I have a promise.

89
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,920
When I wake up,

90
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,920
you have to promise me one thing.

91
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,920
Okay?

92
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,920
Okay.

93
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,920
You promise me too.

94
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,920
Tong Ming, hurry up!

95
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,920
Tong Ming.

96
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,920
Tong Ming.

97
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,920
Tong Ming.

98
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,920
Tong Ming.

99
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,920
Tong Ming.

100
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,920
Tong Ming.

101
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,920
Tong Ming.

102
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,920
Tong Ming.

103
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,920
Tong Ming.

104
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,920
Tong Ming.

105
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,920
Tong Ming.

106
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,920
Tong Ming.

107
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,920
Tong Ming.

108
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,920
Tong Ming.

109
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,920
Tong Ming.

110
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,920
Tong Ming.

111
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,920
Tong Ming.

112
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,920
Tong Ming.

113
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,920
Tong Ming.

114
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,920
Tong Ming.

115
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,920
Tong Ming.

116
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,920
Tong Ming.

117
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,920
Tong Ming.

118
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,920
Tong Ming.

119
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,920
Tong Ming.

120
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,920
Tong Ming.

121
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,920
Tong Ming.

122
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,920
Tong Ming.

123
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,920
Tong Ming.

124
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,920
Tong Ming.

125
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,920
Tong Ming.

126
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,920
Tong Ming.

127
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,920
Tong Ming.

128
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,920
Tongёрll.

129
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,920
Tongенить.

00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,920
Tongが

131
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,920
Tongoooooj slot

132
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,040
Your Majesty!

133
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,880
Mom...

134
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,400
You must kill her.

135
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,040
Otherwise,

136
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,160
she will become

137
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,040
the one who marries you.

138
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:31,960
Amber?

139
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,040
Isn't that Amber?

140
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,200
Amber is a combination of Yin and Yang.

141
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,800
The jade eye is on fire.

142
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,440
Amber.

143
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,600
Junior, stop!

144
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,360
The daughter is the end of your life.

145
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:49,960
It's not her.

146
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,160
You and Da Si Ming

147
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,320
are both reading my elixir books.

148
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:54,920
Her birthday

149
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,240
is not as predicted.

150
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,320
It's probably me

151
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,600
and the power of the Chis.

152
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,280
It's just a coincidence.

153
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,680
There is no such coincidence in the world.

154
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,400
If you don't want to do it,

155
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,160
I'll do it.

156
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,600
I'll do it.

157
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,240
What's wrong with you?

158
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,560
You can't even take this hit from me.

159
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,480
You've given up your power to her.

160
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm not sure if she's a person of the Chis.

161
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,120
But she just saved our lives.

162
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,360
This is for sure.

163
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,680
Don't be so heartless.

164
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,920
I'm a bird, not a human.

165
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,880
You don't have to be so heartless.

166
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,240
Leave this kind of

167
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,440
ungrateful thing to me.

168
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,880
Even if there's any retribution in the future,

169
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,040
I'm willing to take it.

170
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,840
If you want to kill her,

171
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,080
kill me.

172
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,560
If she's really your sister,

173
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,480
she'll kill you

174
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,720
even if she saves you.

175
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,360
I've lived for thousands of years.

176
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,800
Normally, people like you

177
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,840
who are not sure of the present

178
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,520
will not have any good results.

179
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,360
The present?

180
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,000
If you were a bird of the Chis,

181
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,520
you wouldn't have been by my side

182
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,120
as a god who's in the back.

183
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:14,960
You're going to

184
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,600
vent my curse.

185
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,760
When Xu Guo scolded me for being a ghost,

186
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,440
the only person who did something for me

187
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,400
was you, right?

188
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,520
Little...

189
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,360
Little God Guan.

190
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,600
Where is this place?

191
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,920
Why is my clothes wet?

192
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,280
You're a white god.

193
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,080
You can't bear the aura of the Yangtze River.

194
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,680
I brought you here

195
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,360
to use the cold water of the Cold River

196
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,240
as a medium

197
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,280
to make the spirit energy

198
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,280
in your body.

199
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,000
You used all your spirit energy

200
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,640
to save me?

201
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,800
Will you get hurt

202
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,160
if you die?

203
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,240
I love you.

204
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:18,680
Besides,

205
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,680
it's my fault.

206
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,440
It's okay. It's okay.

207
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,640
Let's not talk about it

208
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,680
if it's over.

209
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,240
Little God Guan,

210
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,200
you're so amazing.

211
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,440
You used all your spirit energy

212
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,080
to save me.

213
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,360
You can still use it.

214
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,480
I feel that

215
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,520
my body is full of energy now.

216
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,720
I even have more memories

217
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,320
than before.

218
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,880
It's amazing.

219
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,920
I can jump so far.

220
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,640
Lord Chong Ming,

221
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,120
today is a good day.

222
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,320
I not only saw you

223
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,680
become a human being for the first time,

224
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,880
but also met you

225
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,280
and understood you.

226
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,080
I met you and understood your past friends

227
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,560
without even knowing you.

228
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,080
By the way,

229
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,080
I was dead just now.

230
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,240
This little God Guan

231
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,800
restored me easily.

232
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,280
Isn't this power

233
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,800
similar to the skill of the Spring of the Dreadless?

234
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,400
He is the master of the world I'm looking for.

235
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,800
Lord Chong Ming.

236
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,440
Are you...

237
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,520
Are you angry?

238
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,960
Aren't we

239
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,840
friends?

240
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,320
We've been out for too long.

241
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,200
Chong Ming is a little impatient.

242
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,120
Since your injury has healed,

243
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,080
let's go back.

244
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,480
Little God Guan.

245
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,680
Is your injury healed?

246
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,680
I mean,

247
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,840
here...

248
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,640
Chong... Chong Ming, let's go.

249
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,760
Are we going back?

250
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,400
Great.

251
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,520
I didn't have time to see you when I came.

252
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,520
When we go back,

253
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,040
I must wear a big eye mask.

254
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,520
But...

255
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,960
Where do you want to sit?

256
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,480
If you're so tall,

257
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,880
and sit in front of me,

258
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,560
you'll block my view.

259
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,320
If you sit behind me...

260
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,320
Is it so obvious that herself

261
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,920
could be the king of the rim?

262
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,920
It doesn't look so sure...

263
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,440
Wait for me.

264
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,080
Let you save enough

265
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,720
This place is very well-kept

266
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,920
Not as good as my Jiuyi Mountain

267
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,120
Sir

268
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,680
Your guest room service

269
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,040
Each group booked a hotel

270
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,280
Stay and play

271
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,760
I will go

272
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,440
Are you ok?

273
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,600
The young divine is emotional

274
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,400
Can't be excited

275
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,760
Really making people heartache

276
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,980
Help me!

277
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:08,280
Kowtow Sub parlar

278
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,520
Listen to me cuently.

279
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,280
Old Master,

280
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,480
where is this place?

281
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,420
It's my maternal letsch.

282
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,200
My Lord,

283
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,560
can I cosmeate Bruce?

284
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,060
The Devil of the Lent teachings

285
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,300
is problematic for your maternal letsch.

286
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,960
I happened to meet you at that time.

287
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,280
Luckily,

288
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,060
I saved your perils

289
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,040
so that I obtained

290
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,500
Tambourines of timing.

291
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,460
we're Duo houses here before,

292
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,820
which must be the destiny

293
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,860
that TangXia family arranged!

294
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,680
The fate

295
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,560
does hold everything there?

296
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,360
Was she

297
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,160
the person

298
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,680
Yeah, you miss me oh my god

299
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,280
Madam and I have never been apart.

300
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,800
We are separated by fate.

301
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,560
But I'm here to pay my respects to you.

302
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,280
Wait.

303
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,400
Your Majesty.

304
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,880
Thank you for my mother.

305
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,480
My Lord.

306
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,320
You are an expert in the world with boundless power.

307
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,040
I'm just a mule in front of you.

308
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,800
I have no right to criticize you.

309
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,280
I just want to tell you some sincere words.

310
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,680
I don't know why you are so stubborn.

311
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,680
But I heard your words.

312
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,520
Now I see His Majesty is sad and speechless.

313
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,360
I think there must be some wrong doing.

314
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,560
You were just like a devil.

315
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,880
That's why.

316
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,600
But as a parent,

317
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,160
I hope my children can live a safe life.

318
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,920
I appreciate your kindness.

319
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,920
But you are young and naive.

320
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,080
You can't understand many things.

321
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,000
You are wrong.

322
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,080
I don't want to let you down

323
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,440
and let the bad guys take advantage of you.

324
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,400
That's why I'm like this.

325
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,960
My father's wife is so ungrateful.

326
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,560
She always thinks I'm a thorn in the flesh and a nail in the palm.

327
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,120
She always thinks about how to get rid of me.

328
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,320
In order to protect me,

329
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,360
my mother has suffered all kinds of humiliation.

330
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,920
Once, on my birthday,

331
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,440
something happened.

332
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,000
It snowed heavily.

333
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,960
I've never seen snow before.

334
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,320
It was so cold and snowy.

335
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,600
So I secretly piled up a snowman.

336
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,840
But Consort Zheng misjudged me

337
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,480
and wanted to hurt her.

338
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,360
So I knelt in front of Consort Zheng

339
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,640
and swallowed the snowman

340
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,840
one by one.

341
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,600
And then?

342
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,960
After that,

343
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,120
my mother fell ill.

344
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,200
I swore to avenge her.

345
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,240
But she was so angry.

346
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,000
Before she passed out,

347
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,320
she said to me,

348
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,320
I'll never forget it.

349
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,440
She said to me,

350
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,160
Yan'er,

351
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,600
I'm protecting you

352
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,280
not because I want you to be born a human,

353
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,320
but because I want you to live a decent life.

354
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,400
If you're angry for a moment,

355
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,600
you'll be the one who's most upset

356
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,000
if you delay yourself and twist your mind.

357
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,600
And you'll be the one

358
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,280
who wants to see those people who bully you.

359
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,080
Mother,

360
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,360
I want to grow up quickly

361
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,640
and protect you.

362
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,320
You can't protect my mother alone.

363
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,920
You have to be a man who is strong

364
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,440
and protect the people of Gongsan.

365
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,680
It was because of my mother's teaching

366
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,200
that I didn't get entangled in thoughts

367
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,600
and live a healthy and happy life.

368
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,320
And that Consort Zheng

369
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,320
was so jealous of me

370
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,160
that she couldn't get up

371
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,960
when I was nine.

372
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,800
So, my lord,

373
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,960
I just tried to persuade you.

374
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,360
Do you think

375
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,520
I'm sincere?

376
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,920
But I have something to tell you.

377
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,160
You're named Chan Yue on your birthday.

378
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,240
You're the emperor.

379
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,600
Where did you get the snowman?

380
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,000
How do you know when I was born?

381
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,680
When I went to the Library,

382
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,880
I read the book of the noble lady of the ceremony.

383
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,040
It's not important.

384
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,400
Just answer my question.

385
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,800
I was born on the day of the Winter Moon.

386
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,800
I was only two years old when I was admitted into the mansion.

387
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,440
But my father was worried

388
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,640
that Consort Zheng thought

389
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:22,540
the person born on the day of the

390
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,000
Winter Moon

391
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:26,920
was the one who was the most important.

392
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:27,680
Shiyi,

393
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,560
you really have to do it this time.

394
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,160
My lord,

395
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,640
let me light the long-lasting grass for you.

396
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,440
Actually,

397
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,320
it was five years ago

398
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,680
when I used the magic to light the fire of the memorial hall last time.

399
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,040
Five years ago,

400
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,240
who did you remember?

401
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,560
My lord, you're a stranger.

402
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,720
It's okay for me to tell you.

403
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,720
The one I commemorated

404
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,200
is only a friend to me.

405
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,320
Then,

406
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,160
why did you commemorate him?

407
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,680
Everyone says

408
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,240
he's a vicious disciple of the world.

409
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,800
But only I know

410
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,640
how a person who let me learn the magic

411
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,000
and protect the country

412
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,720
can be a villain.

413
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,920
Although there is only one reason,

414
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,200
you believed him

415
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,600
when everyone was scolding him

416
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,720
to commemorate him.

417
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,960
If he knew it,

418
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,000
he would be very grateful to you.

419
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,280
I think he should know it.

420
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,200
That day, my tears fell into the fire.

421
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,520
The blood cold fever

422
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,880
suddenly turned into a fire

423
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,360
and hit my eyebrows.

424
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,760
But I didn't get hurt at all.

425
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,000
I think

426
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,080
this is his response to me in the heaven.

427
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,680
The Chi clan's magic is good.

428
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,880
The tears of the young women are the cause.

429
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,080
The prophecy of the Great Third Master

430
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,160
is all fulfilled.

431
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,320
Do it.

432
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,920
The three coincidences

433
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,880
have made you a bad omen.

434
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,520
If you met the Purple Demon

435
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,960
before,

436
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,840
you will die in his hands in the future.

437
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,520
You must kill him.

438
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,160
My Lord,

439
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,960
why are you looking at me like this?

440
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,880
Kill him this time.

441
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,680
If you want to kill him, kill me first.

442
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,520
What...

443
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,440
What...

444
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,200
My Lord, this is...

445
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,160
There are strange winds in the mountains.

446
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,360
They will take people away.

447
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,080
No wonder

448
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,520
I was also caught in the wind hole.

449
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,400
Chong Ming, what's wrong with you?

450
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,360
Xiao Ying Zi,

451
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,320
I'm afraid you'll get hurt before you can get back your power.

452
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,040
You are the only one who has the power to seal me.

453
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,760
I'm so angry.

454
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,640
Chong Ming didn't hide from the strange wind just now.

455
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,760
He got a cold and couldn't open his mouth.

456
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,440
He got a cold so quickly.

457
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,360
That's indeed a strange wind.

458
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,600
Have you ever seen such a beautiful monster?

459
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,400
You are the monster.

460
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,520
Your whole family is the monster.

461
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,280
Chong Ming, are you really okay?

462
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,040
I've removed the cold shoes for him.

463
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,640
He can send you back.

464
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,520
Chong Ming,

465
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,240
you must send the Princess back to the mountain

466
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,440
safely and safely.

467
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:39,880
This time,

468
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,040
there must be no more accidents.

469
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,760
Your Lordship,

470
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,000
I was the one who failed to keep a steady capacity earlier.

471
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,960
Your Lordship, do not fault me for that.

472
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,640
This time,

473
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,440
you can keep a steady mind.

474
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,560
Your Lordship, what are you gonna do?

475
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,960
His Lordship!

476
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,960
Why is this jewel so familiar?

477
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,920
I think I've been to the Empire Valley before.

478
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,160
But I can't remember anything.

479
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,360
I've seen you before.

480
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,400
Right?

481
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,800
You want to erase my memory,

482
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,240
right?

483
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,160
It's me.

484
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,960
I'm the one who lost my memory.

485
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,040
I don't want anyone to know about my existence.

486
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,720
I don't want anyone to know that I live here.

487
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,080
Will you do the same this time?

488
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,000
I'm sorry.

489
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,080
No!

490
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,320
We're friends now.

491
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,120
No!

492
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,000
My Lord,

493
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,120
have you erased my memory?

494
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,560
Or will you erase it later?

495
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,960
You promised me.

496
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,160
When I wake up,

497
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,840
you'll do something for me.

498
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,840
I promised her one thing.

499
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,080
But she hasn't done it yet.

500
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,400
So I can't erase her memory about it.

501
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,360
It's the rule of the magic.

502
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,560
The rule of the magic.

503
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,160
My Lord,

504
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,240
I beg you.

505
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,080
Don't erase my memory.

506
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,360
I swear

507
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,360
I won't tell anyone that I've been here.

508
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,080
You promised me.

509
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,480
When you wake up,

510
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,040
I'll do something for you.

511
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,760
What do you want me to do?

512
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,520
I want...

513
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,960
My Lord,

514
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,320
you just got out of the pain of losing your mother.

515
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,080
So I asked you to be my teacher.

516
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,720
It's not appropriate.

517
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,340
It's the bell of the

518
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,120
Mawshi Temple.

519
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,280
My Lord,

520
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,480
if I don't go back,

521
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,960
my father will find out.

522
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,600
As for the thing I want to beg you,

523
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,120
we'll talk about it another day.

524
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,040
Don't worry.

525
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,160
I won't tell anyone

526
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,240
that I've been here.

527
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,040
I won't tell anyone even if I die.

528
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:24,800
Okay.

529
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:25,920
I believe you.

530
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:26,920
But

531
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,920
the Emperor's Valley is the forbidden area of Mount Jiuyi.

532
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,560
Those who break in will die.

533
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,320
Don't come here again.

534
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:36,920
Chong Ming,

535
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,680
I'm counting on you.

536
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,440
I didn't mean to give you flowers that day.

537
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,160
But you wanted to worship me.

538
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,800
You were a true heart that sent me to the world.

539
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,600
But you became the rain in my life.

540
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,880
You broke into the Emperor's Valley

541
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,360
and started the rain.

542
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,520
You helped me see through the devil.

543
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,520
Our fates are entangled.

544
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,080
Even if I die because of you,

545
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,280
you will always be grateful to me.

546
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,400
What is this?

547
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,720
Eat it.

548
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,080
I'll tell you.

549
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,720
I

550
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,880
threw that girl

551
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,240
from Mount Jiuyi.

552
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,320
I threw her out of the Seven Soul Six Ports.

553
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,600
Then,

554
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,400
she became the fruit of this poison.

555
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,320
Her name is

556
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,120
Duanhuo.

557
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,600
Duanhuo?

558
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,840
Duanhuo?

559
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,000
Duanhuo?

560
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:00,960
Duanhuo?

561
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:01,960
Duanhuo?

562
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:02,920
Duanhuo?

563
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:03,760
Duanhuo?

564
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,720
Duanhuo?

565
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,000
Duanhuo?

566
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:06,960
After you take it,

567
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,520
you'll die immediately.

568
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,960
It's better than being

569
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,280
tortured by that girl after a few years.

570
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,400
If she's already gone,

571
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,920
who will come to

572
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,200
break through my heart in the future?

573
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,360
You know she's your sister.

574
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,800
Why did you let her go?

575
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,080
You even sealed my magic power.

576
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,880
Luckily, I'm very intelligent.

577
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,320
I spent a whole day

578
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,560
picking up the fruit of the poison

579
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,960
and continuing your spiritual power.

580
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:33,920
Otherwise,

581
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,000
you wouldn't be able to hide it from me.

582
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,520
You let me protect the world and the people.

583
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,600
But did you see it?

584
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,800
This world is so cruel.

585
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,960
These ruthless villains

586
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,760
don't deserve

587
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,160
your mercy and forgiveness.

588
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,440
I want to take revenge!

589
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,560
Then what should I do

590
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,000
for you?

591
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,760
Kill her?

592
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,040
Kill someone who

593
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,760
risked his life to remember me?

594
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,000
And now,

595
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,160
you're bringing back

596
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,600
the girl I saved from the devil?

597
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,320
When you learn something,

598
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,360
it's your mother's wish

599
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,840
to protect the world and the people

600
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,280
with magic.

601
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,240
The rain is far away,

602
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,440
but the virtue of being a human is ahead.

603
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,600
I'm unable to do it.

604
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,680
But, Chongmin, don't worry.

605
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,400
I'll cherish

606
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,920
my life

607
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,760
because I want to be like my mother

608
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,040
and learn something soon

609
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,520
and protect the world and the people

610
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,440
with magic.

611
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,880
What about the memory?

612
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,080
Why was it removed?

613
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,200
Because I promised her a wish.

614
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,680
So I couldn't break the spell on her.

615
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,120
In fact,

616
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,120
she's just a young star.

617
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,920
As long as she doesn't see me,

618
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,320
she'll forget

619
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,040
me in a few days.

620
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,800
But can she forget it?

621
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,240
Five years have passed.

622
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,320
She hasn't forgotten the shadow of the Crown Prince.

623
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,280
Everyone says

624
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,840
she's the evil disciple of the world.

625
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,320
But only I know

626
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,200
that a person who asked me to learn magic

627
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,520
and protect the country

628
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,120
can't be a bad person.

629
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,840
Five years have passed.

630
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,520
She still remembers me.

631
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,080
It's really rare.

632
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,640
I admit that

633
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,240
I'm very grateful to her.

634
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,280
But I've thought it over.

635
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,320
Whether she comes or not,

636
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,520
I won't see her again.

637
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,040
That's good.

638
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,480
But I think

639
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,240
the memory should be removed.

640
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,440
Otherwise, Da Siming will know

641
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,600
that I won't let her go.

642
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,000
It's for her own good.

643
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,120
As for her wish,

644
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,600
it's easy to satisfy her.

645
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,640
I know what she wants.

646
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:06,960
You know?

647
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,760
Of course.

648
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,520
She has praised me

649
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,080
several times.

650
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,080
What she wants

651
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,120
is my feather.

652
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,200
Although this little girl

653
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,640
is a little bit talkative,

654
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,520
her taste is good.

655
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:31,680
Yanxi Palace

656
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,880
We went to Lanone dop circa 200 years ago.

657
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:57,800
Today the

658
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,000
Picket is free.

659
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,200
I want to go without you.

660
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,600
Perhaps with you,

661
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,040
I'll surely get more human senses,

662
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,440
much marché in the world.

663
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,360
Do you dare to choose me?

664
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,560
Naive?

665
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,240
Yes.

666
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,560
Erniang is not strong,

667
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,240
and he has a lot of rationality.

668
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,200
Although his power cannot be mentioned,

669
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,640
his determination and strength

670
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,120
What else can be so magical

671
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,840
about the feather of a bird?

672
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,440
You can have the feather of a bird?

673
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,240
As far as I know,

674
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,400
the four palaces are just a few pieces.

675
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,640
A friend of mine gave me this.

676
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,520
They gave me such a nice gift.

677
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,080
Are they also trying to be my friends?

678
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,600
Who are they?

679
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,680
I can't tell you.

680
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,080
But I think

681
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,520
that person

682
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,040
is the one who can teach me

683
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,400
the magic of the Spring of the Crying Wood.

684
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,000
You can't tell anyone about this.

685
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,360
And you can't tell anyone

686
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,640
about the feather of the Bird of the Spring of the Bird.

687
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,760
Is there any clue

688
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,200
about the magic you want to learn?

689
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,640
Can the magic

690
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,840
really bring the Crown Prince back to life?

691
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,760
I don't know about that either.

692
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,080
But I'll try my best

693
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,600
to get at least a little hope.

694
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:34,240
I also want to see him again.

695
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,000
Then I hope

696
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,840
you can get well soon.

697
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,160
By the way, Yufei.

698
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,680
Prepare a paper and a pen for me.

699
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,400
I'm going to write a letter to An Yuan

700
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,560
to ask him to prepare a gift for me.

701
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,720
It's a gift of replying to him

702
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,080
and a gift of being a teacher.

703
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,160
You must be special.

704
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,360
Yes, My Lady.

705
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:56,960
Your Highness,

706
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,200
Princess Xueyin is here.

707
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:01,880
Xueyin.

708
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,440
Have you just cried?

709
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,720
What's wrong?

710
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,320
Just now,

711
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,760
Nanny sent someone to tell us to go to the Square of Unmindfulness.

712
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,000
She said she wanted to knock on the door

713
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,000
of the Unmindful Star Stone.

714
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,080
I'm really annoyed.

715
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,560
Forget it.

716
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,080
I was the stupid one.

717
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,040
It's okay to not want the Unmindful Star Stone.

718
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,640
Don't say that.

719
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,560
Wait for me.

720
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,680
My Lady,

721
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,640
this is a gift from someone.

722
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,040
If you send it out,

723
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,280
others will be sad when they know it.

724
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:50,880
Anyway,

725
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,440
it's more important to Xueyin.

726
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,760
Xueyin, look.

727
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,080
This is the feather of the Chou Ming Goddess Bird.

728
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,520
If you use it to decorate your dance group,

729
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,200
you can surely beat any other

730
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,160
Qizhen Goddess in the world.

731
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,040
Here you are.

732
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,120
Chou Ming feather is very rare in the rumors.

733
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,680
Yan, how did you get it?

734
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,240
Don't ask me about it.

735
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,200
Take it.

736
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,680
No, no.

737
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,440
This gift is too precious.

738
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,120
Even if I give up the Unmindful Star Stone,

739
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,520
I can't accept it.

740
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,760
Xueyin,

741
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,040
the Unmindful Star Ceremony is only once every ten years.

742
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,640
You only have one chance in your life

743
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,200
to be the Unmindful Star Stone.

744
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,160
Xueyin,

745
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,240
do you want your mother

746
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,800
to be sad for you in heaven?

747
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,840
No matter how precious it is,

748
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,360
it's just an external object.

749
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,280
As long as you promise me

750
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,840
not to tell anyone about the feather

751
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,120
I gave you,

752
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,240
it's okay.

753
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,880
Yan,

754
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,240
thank you.

755
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,280
Thank you.

756
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,280
I won't let you down.

757
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,320
I believe you.

758
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,960
My lords and princesses,

759
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,920
His Highness Shiyu has just arrived in Mount Jiuyi.

760
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:18,920
He's tired.

761
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,200
He's not feeling well.

762
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,120
He's not feeling well.

763
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,400
So he's going to the ceremony today.

764
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,480
Banchun mushroom,

765
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,000
Yunkui,

766
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,480
dragon bud,

767
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,160
and cangshan incense.

768
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,440
These are all

769
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,560
medicinal herbs that can be nourished by the liver

770
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,280
and nourished by the body.

771
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,640
Could it be

772
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,080
that my father

773
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,840
made them for the guest in the mountain?

774
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,080
I bought these

775
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,640
from the divine servant in the mountain

776
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,880
at a high price.

777
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,840
The smell of the medicinal herbs

778
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,640
is so good.

779
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,360
It's really magical.

780
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,640
Xueyin,

781
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,120
you should think about it

782
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,960
like your sister.

783
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,040
Don't forget the mission

784
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,320
of the Bai clan.

785
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,000
Yes.

786
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,360
Xue Lu,

787
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:06,760
please send the medicinal herbs

788
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,920
to His Highness.

789
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,120
You must seize the opportunity.

790
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,160
Yes.

791
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,160
Do you know why my father asked me to go?

792
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,360
Because only my method

793
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,160
can stop His Highness Shiyu

794
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,880
and make him obey the order

795
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,600
and stabilize the defense of our six clans.

796
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,400
Now you should know

797
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,600
that Wang Xing's position

798
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,360
is in a state of no doubt.

799
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,520
Ying.

800
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,440
Your Majesty.

801
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,160
Your skills are quite bad.

802
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,280
Is there any problem

803
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,960
witholling practice recently?

804
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,100
No, I've been君

805
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,640
I really haven't been kind enough.

806
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,120
My practice is indeed slow.

807
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,280
Ying

808
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:05,400
came to die because of my training.

809
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,900
Only after that

810
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,500
could I不是ave my 85% Palanquin

811
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,560
to revenge.

812
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,240
Why is it

813
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,760
so 이것-be?

814
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,600
Could it be

815
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,800
that someone in the mountain

816
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,760
helped him to get through the trial?

817
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,200
I just went

818
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,120
to the US

819
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,360
I just went to worship your mother.

820
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,120
I just went to worship your mother.

821
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:22,120
I just went to worship your mother.

00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,120
I just went to worship your mother.

824
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,120
I just went to worship your mother.

825
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,120
I just went to worship your mother.

00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:32,120
I just went to worship your mother.

827
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:34,120
I just went to worship your mother.

828
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,120
I just went to worship your mother.

829
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,120
I just went to worship your mother.
