1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,520
I want to spend the rest of my life with you

2
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,200
I want to be with you

3
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:14,720
Please give me a life of shining fortune

4
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,400
I want to be with you

5
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,000
I want to be with you

6
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,520
But I will sacrifice myself for you

7
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,200
I want to be with you

8
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,960
No matter how hard it is

9
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,480
I want to be with you

10
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:48,480
In my heart

11
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,560
The journey to the capital is easy for ordinary people

12
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,480
The sound of thousands of books is just to expand your hearing

13
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,640
There will be more things that are more than ordinary people

14
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,680
I want you to learn

15
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,600
The name of Changyan, the betrayer of the law

16
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,800
Not only thank you, but also can eliminate the long-term

17
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,000
Don't you owe me a wish

18
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,560
Then my wish is changed into this now

19
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,960
I want to be with you

20
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,920
I want to be with you

21
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,360
But I will sacrifice myself for you

22
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,640
I want to be with you

23
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,040
In my heart

24
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,080
The journey to the capital is easy for ordinary people

25
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,960
The sound of thousands of books is just to expand your hearing

26
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,360
There will be more things that are more than ordinary people

27
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,160
I want to be with you

28
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,600
I want to be with you

29
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,720
I want to...

30
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,600
me...

31
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,160
me...

32
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,240
I really don't want to die

33
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,440
Zhu Yan, wake up.

34
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,200
He's so considerate to you

35
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,920
because you went to the mountain.

36
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,760
It doesn't mean anything.

37
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,720
It's a good thing

38
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,640
that I almost forgot something important.

39
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,720
Give it to me.

40
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,880
What?

41
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,520
Hair.

42
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,040
The Chancellor Hermits have a hairstyle

43
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,880
that suits me well.

44
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,120
However, I only got the latter part.

45
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,020
When I come back from the mountain,

46
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,160
I'll never track down the Chancellor again.

47
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,280
Good.

48
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:13,960
Bao Qing,

49
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,160
Young Master,

50
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,840
I'm keeping this hair.

51
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,760
Maybe it reminds me

52
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,160
of the sunset in the valley today.

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,160
Please let me

54
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,280
keep this memory.

55
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,040
Memory?

56
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,960
Your wish has come true.

57
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,880
I don't want to erase your memory

58
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,840
and I'm also sorry for your subordinate.

59
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,200
Don't be so cold-hearted.

60
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,400
Why do you turn your face around?

61
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,560
You're still the same as before.

62
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,120
I hope you'll go back to the West Desert

63
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,600
and only remember the magic.

64
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,360
Don't remember me.

65
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,400
Call me.

66
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:29,720
Supreme WriteDIs

67
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,600
houses in黒 Si Ming's hair

68
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,460
so black and soft,

69
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,580
so it looks good.

70
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,680
D Greenland Que for you.

71
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,300
Please.

72
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,000
Have you got it?

73
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,240
Here you are.

74
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,280
How is it?

75
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,800
I'm a good talker, right?

76
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,040
Thank you.

77
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,080
No.

78
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,520
Qing Gang is a man who would never

79
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,040
use poison in his life.

80
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,080
How could he use Shao Siming's hair

81
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,640
to increase his magic?

82
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,720
He is not a man

83
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,160
who likes to gossip.

84
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,440
No.

85
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,960
I have to go and have a look.

86
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,560
Shao Siming's hair?

87
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,880
It's really a puzzle.

88
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,800
Shao Siming,

89
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,040
I'm sorry.

90
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,560
Qing Gang!

91
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,120
Qing Gang!

92
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,320
Qing Gang!

93
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,360
Qing Gang!

94
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,320
Qing Gang!

95
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,320
Qing Gang!

96
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,240
Qing Gang!

97
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,120
Qing Gang!

98
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,040
Qing Gang!

99
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:12,880
Qing Gang!

100
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,560
Qing Gang!

101
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,440
This is the magic you mentioned?

102
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,400
Why do I look like

103
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,480
I'm trying to kill someone?

104
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,600
And this pen.

105
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,240
What's wrong?

106
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,720
Princess Zhu Yan,

107
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,720
I don't want to hurt you.

108
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,880
I'm not afraid of my friends hurting me.

109
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,400
I'm afraid that my friends

110
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,920
will use me.

111
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,840
Why don't you go to Shao Siming with me

112
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,200
and make things clear?

113
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,440
Or

114
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,960
you can kill me

115
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,080
and let me shut up.

116
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,360
What?

117
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You can't do it?

118
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,800
Then don't blame me.

119
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,880
Are you going to report it?

120
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,200
Go.

121
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,880
Shao Siming!

122
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,720
Shao Siming!

123
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,080
Is this thing important?

124
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,880
This pen

125
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,400
is made of your birth hair.

126
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,080
The first word you write is your name.

127
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,200
Tell me,

128
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,640
what's your name?

129
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,280
Ying.

130
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,520
My name is Shi Ying.

131
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,600
Yes.

132
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,520
This pen

133
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,520
is the first pen in your life.

134
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,440
You must keep it.

135
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,600
I'll do as you say.

136
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,480
How did you get this pen?

137
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,680
Qinggang asked me to get your hair a few days ago.

138
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,000
I thought about it and felt strange.

139
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,640
So I went to his room to ask him.

140
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,560
And I saw that

141
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,600
he put your hair

142
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,760
and this pen together.

143
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,720
So

144
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,280
what you said today

145
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,440
is just to get my hair.

146
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,000
You didn't mean to learn it.

147
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,480
Shouldn't you care about your own safety?

148
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,600
You're just being too careful.

149
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,640
Because I care about you.

150
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,760
And every student,

151
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,440
this is my first time as a teacher.

152
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,960
I hope I can do well.

153
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,040
What Zhu Yan said today

154
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,240
is true.

155
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,160
Shao Siming's virtue of life

156
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,400
is Zhu Yan's lifelong benefit.

157
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,240
I've known

158
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,760
the difference between me and other disciples.

159
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,040
The other day,

160
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,760
Shao Siming told me

161
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,240
what he said in the Valley.

162
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,360
I was still not convinced.

163
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,800
Now I understand.

164
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,080
I was harsh.

165
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,160
You don't have to slander yourself.

166
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,800
Learn more things in the mountains.

167
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,200
You'll learn a lot of things

168
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,080
when you get to the mountain.

169
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,080
As for this thing,

170
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,360
don't worry.

171
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,080
It doesn't hurt me.

172
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,160
I remember it's on this board.

173
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,320
Am I old?

174
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,680
Is my memory bad?

175
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,080
This spell can take the fruit of the South Mountain.

176
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,280
It can be said that the person who practices it is righteous.

177
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,240
It's not for women.

178
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,600
That's good.

179
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,920
Now Shi Ying

180
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,680
won't be possessed by that girl.

181
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,080
Shao Siming.

182
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,760
Shao Siming is here.

183
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,840
Since someone is waiting for you,

184
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,320
why didn't you come?

185
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,400
I think Princess Zhu Yan

186
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,120
told Shao Siming.

187
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,520
You guessed my mission.

188
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,880
I know I'm not as powerful as Shao Siming.

189
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,400
But I have a duty.

190
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,600
I can only risk my life to fight against you.

191
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,200
I'm sorry.

192
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,680
Get out of the ring!

193
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,840
Stone Bone of Qintong.

194
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,120
Nice!

195
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,040
Go.

196
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,480
Go away.

197
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,480
Why didn't you kill me?

198
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,600
What else can you do?

199
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,880
Just use it.

200
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:00,840
By the way,

201
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,400
you can still use poison.

202
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,280
Otherwise,

203
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,760
it's hard to deal with it.

204
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,960
I have to complete my mission.

205
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,720
I can't just end it like this.

206
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,600
Once you confirm the identity of Shao Si Ming,

207
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,160
you use the Qingzu technique as a bait

208
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,440
to break the seal of the Queta Zhi in your body.

209
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,440
Then you become the Queta Zhi, the giant poison.

210
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,400
By then,

211
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,680
you just have to have any physical contact with him.

212
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,800
The giant poison of Queta Zhi

213
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,720
will be transferred to him.

214
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,640
He will be poisoned to death.

215
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,840
The Qingzu technique has been used.

216
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,720
He will die.

217
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,960
If he doesn't die,

218
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,920
he will be the Queen.

219
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,360
I'm sorry.

220
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,400
You are the Queta Zhi?

221
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,840
The Qingzu technique has been used.

222
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,800
He will die.

223
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,120
If he doesn't die,

224
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,920
he will be the Queen.

225
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,200
Shao Si Ming,

226
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,600
why are you...

227
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,600
You'd rather commit suicide

228
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,560
because you feel guilty about using poison to kill me.

229
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,200
But the Queta Zhi

230
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,920
has been transferred to you now.

231
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,320
Of course I know.

232
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,480
And the poison in your body

233
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,960
has been removed.

234
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,920
Shao Si Ming,

235
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,360
the poison will be triggered immediately.

236
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,960
You have to save me.

237
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,920
Qingmu will die.

238
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:53,680
But you...

239
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,160
Since I dare to do so,

240
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,000
it's natural that I'm guilty.

241
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,800
If you do so,

242
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,960
you will be fully confident.

243
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,560
The Queta Zhi

244
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,160
can't be cured by you.

245
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,680
I can use the spiritual power in my body

246
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,200
to suppress it temporarily

247
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,560
and force it out of my body.

248
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,440
Look.

249
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,000
Am I safe and sound now?

250
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,400
The Queta Zhi poison in the civilized world

251
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,880
can't be cured by him.

252
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,840
Shao Si Ming,

253
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,960
I'm here to kill you.

254
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,040
But you saved me.

255
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,080
Qinggang,

256
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,720
you are a kind person.

257
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,080
We are both disciples.

258
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,800
I came here at night

259
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,360
just to teach my disciples

260
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,480
martial arts.

261
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,520
All your actions

262
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,520
were just to show my ability.

263
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,960
So you don't need to be so nervous.

264
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,800
The fight,

265
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:49,800
the winning or losing

266
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,920
are all ordinary.

267
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,720
If you can't remember people, you will die.

268
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,440
Isn't it a waste of your pride?

269
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,640
You have the blood of Qingfu

270
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,760
from ancient times.

271
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,600
Qinggang,

272
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,200
do you know

273
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,360
why I broke your sword just now?

274
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,440
It's Shao Si Ming's fault.

275
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,880
His power is far better than mine.

276
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,400
The reason why Qingfu sword

277
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,280
is known to the world,

278
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,000
is that it's not just a trick

279
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,280
to make a sword into a sword.

280
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,240
It's the way to make a sword

281
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,600
with a soft hand.

282
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,240
It's the way to make a sword

283
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,440
with a soft hand.

284
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,000
It's not a violent trend

285
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,680
that can be used for a lifetime.

286
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,080
The way to make a sword

287
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,200
with a soft hand.

288
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,480
Qinggang,

289
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,080
I hope you will

290
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,720
value Qing's life

291
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,840
more than anything else.

292
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,040
Shao Si Ming,

293
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,520
please remember

294
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,160
your teachings.

295
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,920
You will never

296
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,760
be able to live in the blood of Qingfu.

297
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,640
And your identity,

298
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,160
I won't tell anyone about it.

299
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,600
Everything in the past

300
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,320
has been turned into smoke.

301
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:13,880
Now,

302
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:14,680
in the future,

303
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,880
I'm just a Shao Si Ming of Mount Jiuyi.

304
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,840
Thank you for your gift.

305
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:20,880
Without it,

306
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,800
I can only return it.

307
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:29,840
Qingfu Sword

308
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,040
This is the Qingfu Sword.

309
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,800
I hope you won't let it down.

310
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,040
Thank you, Shao Si Ming.

311
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:45,040
Qingfu Sword

312
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,040
Episode 16

313
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,280
Didn't you go to find Qinggang?

314
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,280
You're poisoned.

315
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,600
Qu Tazhi

316
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,040
will help me get through.

317
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,080
You...

318
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,200
You knew he was very weak.

319
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,400
How dare you go there?

320
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,160
I can use my cultivation

321
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,480
to suppress the poison.

322
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,200
But if I don't detoxify him,

323
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,600
Qinggang will be poisoned.

324
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,240
You...

325
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,000
How long can you delay it?

326
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Only a few hours.

327
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,720
His life is not as important as yours.

328
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,320
Shao Si Ming.

329
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,000
Shao Si Ming.

330
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:30,880
Shao Si Ming.

331
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,240
I've thought about it.

332
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,480
It's not that simple.

333
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,280
Shao Si Ming.

334
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,160
You...

335
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,040
Did Qinggang do it?

336
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,360
Qinggang.

337
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,120
Qinggang was poisoned by the poison.

338
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,480
He looked for my hair.

339
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,160
He just wanted to use my power

340
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,360
to get the flower ring.

341
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,760
He's not evil.

342
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,240
You detoxified his poison.

343
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,440
You went there to detoxify yourself?

344
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,840
He didn't know about it.

345
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,640
Don't tell anyone.

346
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,000
Don't worry about him.

347
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,920
Think about Qu Tazhi's detoxification.

348
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,640
Qu Tazhi?

349
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,040
What's that?

350
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,000
Let's go find Da Si Ming.

351
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,680
No.

352
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,280
Da Si Ming didn't know about the detoxification.

353
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,480
If he knew I was poisoned,

354
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,560
he would only be angry with Qinggang.

355
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:16,880
Oh no.

356
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,520
I can't suppress the poison.

357
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,520
Look.

358
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,680
Does this shape look like a flower?

359
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:24,960
It's not the time.

360
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,440
What flower?

361
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,760
Qu Tazhi.

362
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,640
Qu Tazhi's You Ming Flute.

363
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,760
I have a way.

364
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,920
I can try it.

365
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,000
Stop fooling around.

366
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,200
I believe you.

367
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,400
This...

368
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,760
Be careful.

369
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,080
Here.

370
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,080
It's here.

371
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,320
You brought us here

372
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,120
for that day?

373
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,920
That day?

374
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,440
No.

375
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,120
Since it's called Flute Flower,

376
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,520
and the poison is a flower,

377
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,880
maybe only the butterfly can detoxify it.

378
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,000
In this night,

379
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,880
only this method can lure the firefly.

380
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,120
You're so naive.

381
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,200
Chong Ming.

382
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,280
Can you think of any other way?

383
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,680
If you can't,

384
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,320
even if I'm the One-Self,

385
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,120
there's only one way.

386
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:30,880
Shao Siming.

387
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,160
Hold the Seven Stars Lantern.

388
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,680
They will absorb human life force

389
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,240
and Shao Siming will attack the hell by himself.

390
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,440
I've tasted this bitter taste.

391
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,280
The Seven Stars Lantern.

392
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,960
I wanted to take the risk.

393
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,520
I didn't expect I got it right.

394
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,280
This poison

395
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,600
needs your force

396
00:23:52,680 --> 00:24:03,720
to suppress the

397
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,780
etched-k Dashing Tiger's Flute

398
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,560
so you can guess his name correctly.

399
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,280
That's good luck that I didn't close.

400
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,040
Thank you.

401
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,640
You saved me.

402
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,800
But thank me?

403
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,520
I didn't know the world before.

404
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,200
I was attacked in the Mount Jiuyi.

405
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,080
I know I'm much worse.

406
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,400
But I didn't expect

407
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,560
that the powerful Shao Siming

408
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,200
would need me.

409
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,800
Now I know

410
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,840
I won't be troubled by my own downfall.

411
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,120
Yes.

412
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,240
I'm much worse than others.

413
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,360
I can't be the first Shao Siming.

414
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,720
But I have my strengths.

415
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,200
I'll work harder every day.

416
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,520
She's a good girl.

417
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,200
But she's a lucky girl.

418
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,800
The hair on the brush is not as good as Shao Siming's.

419
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,800
Shao Siming is not a prince.

420
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,720
Qinggang is the empress's daughter.

421
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,200
She's willing to leave me.

422
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,960
In this case,

423
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,120
the tribe won't send people to disturb Shao Siming again.

424
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,640
The King of the Mountain

425
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,600
Princess Xue Fu.

426
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:10,920
You...

427
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:11,920
How long have you been here?

428
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,400
Not long.

429
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,400
What did you see?

430
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,760
I saw it clearly.

431
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,000
Qing Caitlin courier confirmed the identity of Crown Prince Xi.

432
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:22,720
하

433
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,920
You two have another quarrel.

434
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,360
I don't think he wanted to go into it without warning.

435
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,440
Onion Ring.

436
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,640
I'm right to give you the letter.

437
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,800
Please don't make a fool of me, Your Highness.

438
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:58,960
It's easy to say.

439
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,040
Tell me

440
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,320
what the letter you wrote to the Prince is.

441
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,280
I'll leave.

442
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,920
The letter wasn't for the Prince.

443
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,360
Then it's for Consort Qing.

444
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,320
Actually,

445
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,360
Consort Qing asked me

446
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,200
to do the same thing as you.

447
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,320
But

448
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,360
you're so flustered now.

449
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,080
You must have hidden something.

450
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:29,960
And

451
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,120
that person must be the late Prince.

452
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,520
I saw

453
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,840
you and Consort Qing

454
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,520
were talking about the same thing.

455
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,680
You were poisoned by the Qing clan,

456
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,040
but you knew how to deal with it.

457
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,840
And you didn't tell the truth.

458
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,400
Because last night,

459
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,920
I saw you

460
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,240
being so happy for the young Minister.

461
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,320
You...

462
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,600
You're so mean.

463
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,440
You just don't want to confess.

464
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,480
You'll have a scar

465
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,680
in my hand in the future.

466
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,600
What on earth are you going to do?

467
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,080
Don't worry.

468
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,520
I'll tell the young Minister

469
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,960
about his background.

470
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,200
Young Minister.

471
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,560
I have something to report to you.

472
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,000
Yes.

473
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,840
Minister.

474
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,840
I saw

475
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,640
that Qing Gang had rebelled against Consort Qing.

476
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,640
The threat of the Qing clan to the young Minister

477
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,080
has been resolved.

478
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,760
How did you know

479
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,320
that the Qing clan

480
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,640
had a threat to the young Minister?

481
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,560
Now that you know it,

482
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,920
why did you hide it from me?

483
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,800
You've been watching me

484
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,320
and I'm the one who's watching you.

485
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,480
It's very important to the young Minister,

486
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,560
isn't it?

487
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,520
I'm not wrong about you.

488
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,720
You're much better

489
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,480
than your coward father.

490
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,520
But I hate

491
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,240
to guess

492
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,600
who I really am.

493
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,560
Do you think

494
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,760
with your background

495
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,320
and a little information,

496
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,120
you can talk to me

497
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,320
and talk about the deal?

498
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,360
I dare not.

499
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,640
I'd like to follow you

500
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,960
for the rest of my life.

501
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,560
For the rest of your life?

502
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,640
It's not your turn to talk about it.

503
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,400
When will you get the position of Chief

504
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,800
and have the right to work together?

505
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,880
I'm in line with the goal of the Minister.

506
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,840
I'm determined to get the position of Chief.

507
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,000
Out heads released

508
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,360
This magicMerger

509
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,600
is meant to be a weapon

510
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,280
and it was B hassle

511
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,360
of killing foes from the bottom side of the Flory Lake

512
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,560
that you love so much

513
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,960
and can suppress

514
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,440
the continuous fire.

515
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,200
You had more chances

516
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,160
and more chances to be in the favour

517
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,160
when we were in the competition.

518
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,160
Thank you, Chief Minister.

519
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:40,880
dorri

520
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,880
But the advert has instigated his own

521
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:45,760
rather 3 minutes

522
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,800
It's the best way to use the kid

523
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,040
learned a little

524
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,340
Although it is a little

525
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,700
consulted time

526
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,720
this is not a child

527
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,520
Do you want us to everybody

528
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,660
to be convincing?

529
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,660
Well

530
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,680
The one who can take us

531
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,800
more easily

532
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,760
I've prepared it.

533
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:08,840
Really?

534
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,120
Qingge.

535
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,360
Do you know

536
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,800
how miserable you made

537
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,440
Shao Siming a few days ago?

538
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:23,960
Shao Siming?

539
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,720
Shao Siming is in trouble?

540
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,400
Did he take a day off yesterday because...

541
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,520
Of course he's fine.

542
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,680
But

543
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,000
how did you, a fool,

544
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,200
get the poison?

545
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,120
I didn't.

546
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,560
How did he get the poison?

547
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,080
Do you know

548
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,080
how much effort he put in to get it out?

549
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,880
You must be careful in the future.

550
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,120
I'm the one who caused Shao Siming trouble.

551
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,280
No wonder

552
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,040
you, a general who's good at fighting,

553
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,760
had to climb up the mountain to take the position of the leader.

554
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,320
So you wanted him to help you get the poison.

555
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,240
Did Shao Siming tell you that?

556
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:00,840
Yes.

557
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,320
And

558
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,320
if you treat me as a friend,

559
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,720
you must tell me about the trouble in the future.

560
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,360
Although I'm not as capable as Shao Siming,

561
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,960
I might be able to help you.

562
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:15,760
Okay.

563
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,680
Thank you,

564
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,120
Princess Zhuo Yan.

565
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,720
According to the rank,

566
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,280
you should sit there.

567
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,520
Yan.

568
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:38,800
Yan.

569
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,160
Yes.

570
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,040
The teacher is here.

571
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,160
Okay.

572
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:49,880
Send it out.

573
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:50,720
Yes.

574
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,880
Everyone,

575
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,440
this is the theme of today's class.

576
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,880
Snacks.

577
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,520
The jade grass

578
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,520
is as fragile as jade.

579
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,040
There are fine thorns on the crystal.

580
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,120
The beautiful pearl leaves are colorful.

581
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,080
Those who are too lazy to do so

582
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,400
are the most beautiful.

583
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,480
Sir,

584
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,720
what's the use of jade grass?

585
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,360
Please don't laugh.

586
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,720
It's a good thing

587
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,840
that Princess Zhuo Yan doesn't know how to ask.

588
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,880
The most important thing

589
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,160
in the cultivation of medicine

590
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,000
is to get rid of all the bad thoughts

591
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,280
and focus on the good.

592
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,800
This jade grass

593
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,760
can help you concentrate.

594
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,960
After we make it,

595
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,120
we will put it in the spiritual power

596
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,680
and wear it when we practice.

597
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,480
If there are any bad thoughts,

598
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,840
it will automatically

599
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,080
kill and kill.

600
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,600
Thank you, Sir.

601
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,760
I understand.

602
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,520
Sir,

603
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,600
the most important thing

604
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,200
is to practice the jade grass.

605
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,600
Will Shao Siming take the class himself?

606
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,160
Shao Siming

607
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,160
will examine your class by himself.

608
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,200
If you have the chance,

609
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,200
you can make a jade grass ring.

610
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,200
Shao Siming will make it later.

611
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,280
He will make a dress from it

612
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,000
and use it for tomorrow's show.

613
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,480
Yan,

614
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,600
why are you forcing yourself?

615
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,120
You have one, why bother to make another one?

616
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,840
You can have mine.

617
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,760
Look at mine.

618
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,160
Look.

619
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,560
Greetings, Shao Siming.

620
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,640
Shao Siming,

621
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,280
this is the jade grass ring I made for you.

622
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,480
What does he do?

623
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,560
He home a broken vial!

624
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,280
How dare he press his confidence on me?

625
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,400
He should be жел Round upward.

626
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,520
Vishu Kra Feldhai

627
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,560
His coincidence was dead?

628
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,560
His fate is unknown.

629
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,840
When he is dead,

630
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,360
there is always someone

631
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,680
searching for his meet.

632
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:56,940
Only one of him is a denken살 a

633
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,040
ten-year old camp's princess of the Virtual World.

634
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,920
Come on, excluding Xiao Ni.

635
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,440
I've told you earlier.

636
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,960
Foreign babies are so explorer.

637
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,080
And your life as well.

638
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:39,700
Come.

639
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,580
Wipe off your hand and hands.

640
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,140
She said this this works best for your Direalm.

641
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,300
When I get up tomorrow morning,

642
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,060
the wounds will be gone.

643
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:51,660
Smells good.

644
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,220
Who gave you these?

645
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,180
She knew that I'm going up there.

646
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,300
And heard everything

647
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,740
and listened to the lessons of Mount Jiuyi.

648
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,940
He was afraid that I would suffer.

649
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,260
Before he left,

650
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,740
he sent me a bunch of things

651
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,580
that might be useful.

652
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,500
His Highness Shiyu really cares about you.

653
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,260
What else did he send you?

654
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,300
Let me see.

655
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:20,980
So many.

656
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,260
This is

657
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,540
the candy from Huaqinzhai in Jialan City.

658
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:29,580
Wow.

659
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,740
It's said that only ten boxes are left in a day.

660
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,140
We have to queue up in the middle of the night.

661
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:36,420
He was afraid that I would suffer.

662
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:40,220
He said that the candy was sweet.

663
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,940
His Highness Shiyu is really good to you.

664
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,100
He cares about your safety.

665
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,700
I admire him.

666
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,460
He is not a playboy

667
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,340
who is just playing with the wind.

668
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,860
I hope that I can meet him

669
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:59,300
at the Mid-Autumn Festival Gala.

670
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:01,740
Besides,

671
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,700
my mother wouldn't have done it

672
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,300
without any trouble.

673
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,460
Now,

674
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,140
she has two candy boxes.

675
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,780
Xueying,

676
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,940
as long as you work hard,

677
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,180
you won't have any regrets

678
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,420
even if you don't get the result.

679
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,500
That's your feeling.

680
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,580
I'm like that too.

681
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:24,780
Although

682
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:29,460
I'm a little Southern,

683
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,420
he's accepted my invitation,

684
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,100
no?

685
00:38:54,780 --> 00:39:10,560
They'reec memb

686
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,500
pe ap

687
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,380
I agree.

688
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,380
Who made this ugly thing

689
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,260
so ugly?

690
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,540
It's her again.

691
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:26,180
Why did you choose her

692
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,820
and her ring?

693
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,020
You should clean it up.

694
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,060
This ring is not neat at all.

695
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:31,820
If you put it in the past,

696
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,260
you would have thrown it away.

697
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:35,940
It's really ugly.

698
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:37,820
I want to help her clean it up.

699
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:38,940
Why did you choose it?

700
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:39,580
Why?

701
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,940
I said a lot of hurtful words

702
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,100
to break Zhu Yan's heart.

703
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,020
If it were someone else,

704
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,460
I would have been upset.

705
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:52,180
Zhu Yan is always the same.

706
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:53,580
I want to

707
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,500
encourage her.

708
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,300
You are not

709
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,060
wavering because of the fact, are you?

710
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,100
Don't forget

711
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,940
she is your sister.

712
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,660
I don't care.

713
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,140
What?

714
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,060
You...

715
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,380
What did you say?

716
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,700
Listen to me.

717
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,780
Life and death are determined by the heavens.

718
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,260
I never hesitate.

719
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:16,620
Not to mention

720
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,940
Zhu Yan won't stay in the mountain for a long time.

721
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,060
She doesn't have the ability.

722
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:21,620
No.

723
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,060
I want to know what you think.

724
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,860
I won't keep her.

725
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,220
If she knows

726
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,620
the crown prince she cares about

727
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:29,940
is such a...

728
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,020
such a cold-hearted person,

729
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,220
she will be very upset.

730
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,420
Although Da Siming

731
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,260
has no more doubts,

732
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,340
she has a lot of dreams at night.

733
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,500
She will make troubles.

734
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,420
Chongming,

735
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:46,820
don't worry.

736
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:52,860
I said so many reasons

737
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,900
that I didn't want to keep her in the mountain.

738
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,980
But I'm just thinking about her.

739
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:01,580
She must have taken a place in your heart.

740
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,300
How can I be at ease?

741
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:08,100
The red jade orb appeared.

742
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,740
And it takes very Luo Bamboo fruit.

743
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,780
Her vector몐 body looks like that of a woman.

744
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:31,620
Also she can't be a store

745
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,260
Don't be noisy.

746
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:34,700
I Tulip

747
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,340
Try it.

748
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,300
You've eaten it.

749
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:37,540
Here.

750
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:39,700
No.

751
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,220
It's really delicious.

752
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,300
I picked it for you.

753
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:42,860
You don't want to eat it?

754
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:44,780
It's really delicious.

755
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:45,260
Try it.

756
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,100
Try it.

757
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:48,940
Eat it.

758
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,460
Hurry up.

759
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:51,660
Eat it.

760
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:52,660
I won't bother you.

761
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:53,420
I won't bother you.

762
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:12,680
The

763
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,620
I mean, it's time to sleep.

764
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:15,500
It's time to sleep.

765
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,460
I'm not like you.

766
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,660
I have no fear of the benefits of the past.

767
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:19,860
Goodbye.

768
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:23,620
I...

769
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:45,500
Sister.

770
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,140
How's the boy?

771
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,100
Look at the bracelet I made.

772
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:48,740
Is it good?

773
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,420
Who is your sister?

774
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:51,300
You're older than me.

775
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,300
Of course you're my sister.

776
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:53,820
Shao Siming is here.

777
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:54,820
Okay.

778
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:55,500
Shao Siming is here.

779
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:57,660
I'm not thin.

780
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:03,020
Greetings, Shao Siming.

781
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,780
Whose bracelet is Shao Siming wearing?

782
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:06,780
Who is it?

783
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:07,540
I don't know.

784
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:11,580
Whose is it?

785
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:18,980
The light is red.

786
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:20,740
It seems to be from the sky.

787
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:21,740
What's this?

788
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:24,660
Look, A Yan.

789
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,860
Shao Siming used your bracelet to demonstrate.

790
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:29,860
Who is he?

791
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:33,740
Shao Siming.

792
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:35,700
Why are you looking at me like this?

793
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:39,060
Do you like me?

794
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:42,500
You're out of your mind.

795
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:46,980
Just do it, Mr. Xiaobai.

796
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:47,860
You...

797
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:51,460
You...

798
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:52,060
You...

799
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:52,660
You...

00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:53,260
You...

00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:53,860
You...

You...

804
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:55,660
You...

805
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:56,460
You...

806
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:57,260
You...

807
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:57,860
You...

808
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:58,460
You...

809
00:44:58,460 --> 00:44:59,260
You...

810
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:00,060
You...

811
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:00,860
You...

812
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:01,660
You...

813
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:02,260
You...

814
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:03,060
You...

815
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:03,860
You...

816
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:04,660
You...

817
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,460
You...

818
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:06,260
You...

819
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:07,260
You...

820
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:08,260
You...

821
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:09,260
You...

822
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:10,260
You...

823
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:11,260
You...

824
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:12,260
You...

825
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:13,260
You...

826
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:14,260
You...

827
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:15,260
You...

828
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:16,260
You...

829
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:17,260
You...

830
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:18,260
You...

831
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:19,260
You...

832
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:20,260
You...

833
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:21,220
You...

834
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:25,220
Xiaobai.

835
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:26,780
It is good to see you.

836
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:29,780
I am finally going to say.

837
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:33,220
Could you take me to the cinema?

838
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:34,980
Would you get out of my sight

839
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:37,380
in a reply?

840
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:39,780
You're so amazing.

841
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:41,420
Come on.

842
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:43,860
Barbara, she also didn't read your carrier book.

843
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:46,260
First, she moved to the set.

844
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:47,780
What set?

845
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:49,180
Get out of my sight.

846
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:54,180
You are the light of my life

847
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:59,180
You are the light of my life

848
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:03,180
You are the light of my life
