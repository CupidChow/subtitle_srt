1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I want to be with you in this life

2
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Give me a life of shining fortune

3
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I want to be with you in this life

4
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I want to be with you forever

5
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
But I ask you to give me the courage

6
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I want to be with you forever

7
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I want to be with you forever

8
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I want to be with you forever

9
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
In my heart

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I, Zhu Yan, am a human

11
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I am not a bird that you can easily catch

12
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You, duck

13
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Your Majesty

14
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Young Commander, where did you hide me?

15
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You are the main guest of these students

16
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
If you want me to be a guest, please don't interfere

17
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You can't hurt anyone

18
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I will give you

19
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
This place is so strange

20
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
How did Young Commander hide me?

21
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I was also hidden by him

22
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Why can't I remember this experience?

23
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
There seems to be something wrong in the hall

24
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I don't know who is the culprit

25
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
This kind of strange movement should be the ants in the mountains

26
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Maybe it's the food of the insects

27
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Oh

28
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
If you have nothing else to say, I will start training

29
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Oh

30
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So Young Commander hid me in his sleeve

31
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Ying, I was too cautious

32
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I made you misunderstand

33
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I hope you don't mind

34
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The first choice is to focus on your own interests

35
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I don't know who is more important to you

36
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I have just met the four of them today

37
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I don't dare to make a decision

38
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's okay

39
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I just hope to know

40
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Let's talk about that Princess Xihuang first

41
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I did have a brief exchange with that Princess Xihuang in the chaos

42
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
She is brave and righteous

43
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Brave and righteous

44
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
But she is stupid, reckless and naughty

45
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
If you want to be a talent, you need time to work

46
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
What did you say?

47
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Stupid, reckless and naughty

48
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
In your opinion, what about Bai Zu and Bai Xue Lu?

49
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Bai Xue Lu is a tough and strong girl

50
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
She is a good girl

51
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
She has no taste

52
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Let me tell you what stupid, reckless and naughty is

53
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Useless

54
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I thought I had entered the pupils

55
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I don't have summer Mommy

56
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,640
I'm sorry.

57
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,240
Let go.

58
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,480
What did I do wrong?

59
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,120
You gave me such a bad review.

60
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,120
Of course I had to write it down

61
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,360
to remind myself.

62
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,600
The character is not a phoenix.

63
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,560
The style is a type.

64
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,160
I'm sure you also appreciate

65
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,280
your work.

66
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,240
Let me help you again.

67
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,960
Since you think

68
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,520
it's stupid, impulsive and playful,

69
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,480
and you wrote these characters yourself,

70
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,880
let them

71
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,960
test you every time.

72
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,040
Get out.

73
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,560
The End

74
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Young Minister,

75
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,800
please forgive me.

76
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,320
Please help me get rid of this.

77
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,320
Then stay here

78
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,000
to prove that you are not like this.

79
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,600
You will disappear naturally.

80
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,400
I...

81
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,400
You...

82
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,560
You are threatening me to stay here.

83
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,320
I told you.

84
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,360
After the school is over a month later,

85
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,720
you can go down the mountain.

86
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,120
An Ran, you...

87
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,840
The color of the pill?

88
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,760
How can a person

89
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,080
with such a bad taste

90
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,160
be compared to the color of the pill?

91
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,160
No, no.

92
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,640
I want to remind you that

93
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,560
the character on your hand

94
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,440
will not disappear naturally

95
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,240
because the time is up.

96
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,800
If you can't reach the standard of the young minister,

97
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,680
you will go down the mountain

98
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,680
with the character on your hand in a month.

99
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,240
You...

100
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,240
This young minister

101
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,720
just doesn't want me to leave.

102
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,000
He still has to be so cold to me.

103
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,200
He wants me to feel inferior to him?

104
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,160
I won't let you do as you please.

105
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,320
Isn't this Princess Zhu Yan?

106
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,360
Why are you here?

107
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,360
What good things are you hiding?

108
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,360
What is this?

109
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,120
A stupid, reckless and naughty person.

110
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,880
Why are you holding the handwriting?

111
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,760
I thought you went to find the young minister early

112
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,120
to get some reward.

113
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,200
I didn't expect it to be a good punishment.

114
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,000
The character on your face is called Qin Xing.

115
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,680
What is the name of the character on your hand?

116
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,120
Let me see.

117
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,600
You are really good at describing.

118
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,760
I will send you a letter

119
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,920
when I get back.

120
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,240
What?

121
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,040
It sounds like you are embarrassing me.

122
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,840
You are not allowed to bring any items on the mountain.

123
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,880
Isn't it special

124
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,120
that I have the character on my hand?

125
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,040
Maybe

126
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,000
from tomorrow on,

127
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,600
someone will be looking down on me.

128
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,160
You are unique and unique.

129
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,840
You are wonderful.

130
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,800
I have never seen someone

131
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,040
who likes to put a gold sticker on his face.

132
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,680
It is a punishment,

133
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,240
but it sounds like a good thing.

134
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,040
Of course it is a good thing.

135
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,320
If you don't believe me,

136
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,360
I will punish you.

137
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,600
He is willing to point a finger at you.

138
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,640
You...

139
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,400
I think we should not bother the young minister.

140
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,560
See you when the official teacher is having a class.

141
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,160
General Qin, thank you for helping me with the sword

142
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,280
a few days ago.

143
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,760
I have cleaned the sword myself

144
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,280
and sent it to your residence.

145
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,040
Sent it to my residence?

146
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,960
This is...

147
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,920
This is...

148
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,080
This is...

149
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,240
This is...

150
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,400
This is...

151
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,560
This is...

152
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,280
This...

153
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:34,760
Is something

154
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,800
ART.

155
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,080
Yan,

156
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,960
why are you still not up?

157
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,280
You're almost late.

158
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,280
Why is your hair wet?

159
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,240
It's already dark.

160
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,920
Why are you still here?

161
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,400
I didn't make a mess for you.

162
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,320
You didn't wash your hair?

163
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,280
Don't worry.

164
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,040
It's fine.

165
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,320
There may be a good show later.

166
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,600
Okay, okay.

167
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,640
Hurry up.

168
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,080
Young Minister's order.

169
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,240
Young Minister's order.

170
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,800
Young Minister's order.

171
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,840
Young Minister's order.

172
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,840
I didn't see it.

173
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,200
You're quite shy.

174
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,720
Since we've been through the set-up,

175
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,920
I'll share the punishment for you.

176
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,560
Please take a seat.

177
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,120
Zhu Yan is late.

178
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,120
You'll be deducted one point.

179
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,480
Zhu Yan is late.

180
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,320
You're not allowed to be late.

181
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,640
You'll be deducted one point.

182
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,640
Zhu Yan is late.

183
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,320
You're not allowed to be late.

184
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,280
You'll be disqualified.

185
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,520
You'll be deducted one point.

186
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,360
Zhu Yan is currently ranked

187
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,800
as the first in the Daoist School.

188
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,720
Young Minister's order.

189
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,640
Why are you so noisy?

190
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,320
Princess Zhu Yan,

191
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,360
Princess Zhu Yan,

192
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,080
the magic is automatic.

193
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,000
It can't even interfere with

194
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,000
the Grand Minister's order.

195
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,480
Why would it interfere with Young Minister's order?

196
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,040
Exactly.

197
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,600
The magic system has been

198
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,840
popularized in Ye City.

199
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,560
Haven't you seen it before?

200
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,000
I forgot.

201
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,000
Princess Zhu Yan is from the West Desert.

202
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,280
Her land is remote.

203
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,760
How can she be related to her?

204
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,800
You're right, Princesses.

205
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,840
Our land is remote

206
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,040
and it's hard to manage.

207
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,600
Since the magic is so good,

208
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,960
why don't you

209
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,840
donate 180 schools of the West Desert

210
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,760
to us?

211
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,200
Everyone will appreciate

212
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,120
the friendship between the Bai and Xuan tribes.

213
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,680
The Bai and Xuan tribes

214
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,200
have been waiting for the answer.

215
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,760
They are also following the rules.

216
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,920
This is a gift from Mount Jiuyi.

217
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,320
It's a reward for the family.

218
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,000
Each family gets one point.

219
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,560
Thank you, Young Minister.

220
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,160
The magic is also a kind of art.

221
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,760
Please give me

222
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,040
the most basic knowledge.

223
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,760
It seems that I'm being suspicious.

224
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,760
How could Zhu Yan

225
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,800
be related to the Grand Minister's order?

226
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,360
Greetings, Grand Minister.

227
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,440
Your Highness.

228
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,680
I'm here to see you.

229
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,840
I'm here to see you.

230
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,920
I'm here to see you.

231
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,080
I'm here to see you.

232
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,240
I'm here to see you.

233
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,400
I'm here to see you.

234
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,040
Greetings, Young Minister.

235
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,240
Don't stand on ceremony.

236
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,320
Young Minister, please come with me.

237
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,200
I have something to tell you.

238
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,240
Yes.

239
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,200
What is it that you want to see me for?

240
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,040
Have you heard of the Queta-Zhi?

241
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,000
Queta-Zhi?

242
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,760
You mean

243
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,280
the poisonous thing that the Qing tribe has been missing for a long time?

244
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:02,880
Yes.

245
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:03,920
Yes.

246
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,160
I received the news

247
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,840
that Qing Gang brought the Queta-Zhi

248
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,120
into the mountain.

249
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,880
This Queta-Zhi is extremely poisonous.

250
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,320
It has no taste or color.

251
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,120
No one has seen it.

252
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,040
Only because the people who have seen it

253
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,880
have no one to return it.

254
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,840
That's why

255
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,040
Qing Gang avoided

256
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,880
the strict search when he entered the Mountain of Nine Faces.

257
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,080
At the test of Qianyue Peak,

258
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,800
you even blamed me.

259
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,080
I shouldn't have let you two

260
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,240
attack him.

261
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,160
Since he passed the test,

262
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,160
it's not convenient for him to be disqualified.

263
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,520
Let him stay in the Mountain of Nine Faces for the time being.

264
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,440
I agree with what Qing Gang did.

265
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,240
Although he is a man of uncivilized behavior,

266
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,560
he is upright in character.

267
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,520
He doesn't seem to want to kill me.

268
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,640
People shouldn't be reckless.

269
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,840
I just want to remind you that

270
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,560
in the three patrols,

271
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,160
he will definitely attack you.

272
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,880
You should be more careful

273
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,880
in his every move.

274
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,560
Yes.

275
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,960
The

276
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:31,680
Bad Head

277
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:42,540
We need the

278
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,520
Mr. Huang We need the

279
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,600
Mr. Huang

280
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,640
We need the

281
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,720
him again.

282
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,800
mode four,

283
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,040
metre point,

284
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,240
figure,

285
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:52,880
needle.

286
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:53,680
pancake pressure,

287
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,000
stone step 저

288
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,920
pit stop i

289
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:56,440
mut.

290
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:56,740
Chooseères

291
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,120
picket

292
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,320
What

293
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,720
How

294
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,320
The one who knows the truth can follow the harmony of heaven and earth

295
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,200
and follow the etiquette of the eight winds.

296
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,360
The one who knows the truth can travel between heaven and earth

297
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,280
and listen to the eight answers.

298
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,160
The one who knows the truth can take advantage of heaven and earth

299
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,360
to grasp the Yin and Yang,

300
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,840
change the stars and change the moon,

301
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,280
and change the heaven and earth.

302
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,080
Only the Star Lord, Langgan,

303
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,560
has been able to

304
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,720
really understand the truth for thousands of years.

305
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,720
The first word is not in the class.

306
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,800
One point less.

307
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,520
One point less again.

308
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,720
Princess, please rise.

309
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,680
Do you think the class is boring and boring?

310
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,920
It's not good for your ears.

311
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,240
I...

312
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,040
If I say it directly, I won't understand.

313
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,880
They are going to make fun of me again.

314
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,960
I'm not being taught.

315
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,640
I can be embarrassed,

316
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,400
but I can't be embarrassed to the West.

317
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,560
I think

318
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,160
what I said is all theory

319
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,440
and useless.

320
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,520
It's just a dead end.

321
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,360
I want to

322
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,960
learn some powerful magic.

323
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:08,960
Deputy Chief Shao.

324
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,320
You want to learn magic?

325
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,640
Good.

326
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,000
Then tell me,

327
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,400
what is the most powerful magic

328
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,760
in the Nine-Weak Mountain Sect?

329
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,360
Who can tell me the answer to this question?

330
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,360
Deputy Chief Shao.

331
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,760
The beads are the most powerful attack technique

332
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,240
in the Nine-Weak Mountain Sect.

333
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,400
The beads have no bones,

334
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,840
and the demons are all dead.

335
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,040
The beads are the attack technique.

336
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,080
Is the attack technique

337
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,600
the most powerful magic in the world?

338
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,760
What if the beads

339
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,800
break through the most powerful defense technique in the world?

340
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,200
What should we do?

341
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,280
So I think this answer is not appropriate.

342
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,080
Good.

343
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,680
Princess Zhu Yan is right.

344
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,400
Then I'll ask you again.

345
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,240
What do you think is the most powerful defense technique?

346
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,100
Pls be藏身

347
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,280
Wishful thinking.

348
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,160
Good.

349
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,480
Captain Shao.

350
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,760
The previous nine-weak mountain's

351
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,160
It's just a theory.

352
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,720
What if the beads are facing the thousand-leaf tree?

353
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,200
If they can't meet each other,

354
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,960
it means there's no best tree in the world.

355
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,680
So I think

356
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,760
it's not a good idea to ask this question.

357
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,760
He's right.

358
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,720
You've already dealt with

359
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,320
the divine official just now.

360
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,800
But you're sleeping.

361
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,160
The magic is a pure soul

362
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,280
who can take over Yin and Yang.

363
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,560
Upgrade the moon and change the sky and earth.

364
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,080
The person who practices the magic

365
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,440
is as deep as the skin,

366
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,760
but he wants to move the sky and earth.

367
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,760
What he learns is how to use the power.

368
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,200
However, everything in the world has its own tricks.

369
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,120
The only thing that can be found

370
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,400
is the changing week and the passing year.

371
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,640
Therefore, the highest magic

372
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,800
is to use the power of time to the void

373
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,720
to change everything.

374
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,880
This point has been written in the clear way.

375
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,560
Upgrade the moon and change the sky and earth.

376
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,800
These words.

377
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,840
Since we can use the time to build the void,

378
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,200
we can control time.

379
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,120
There's a way to return to the Heavenly Park.

380
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,960
But I remember someone said

381
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:43,880
there's no such thing.

382
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,640
Everything in the world has its own limits.

383
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,040
Because of the limits,

384
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,520
there are you, me,

385
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,760
flowers, trees,

386
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,840
the sky and the earth.

387
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,120
There are everything in the world,

388
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,480
including the cloud and the living.

389
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,000
If there is no limit,

390
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,840
everything in the world is a mess.

391
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,960
Life and death are the highest limits.

392
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,360
They can't be exceeded.

393
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,560
This point has been written in the clear way.

394
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,440
If you listen to the magic seriously,

395
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,320
you won't have this argument.

396
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,960
If you could tell me the magic's principle directly,

397
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,720
I would practice hard.

398
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,280
The God has taught me.

399
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,080
The person who practices the magic has four levels.

400
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,000
It's actually the inside and outside.

401
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,120
I can recognize the principle of everything in the world.

402
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,960
If you don't know the way of the sky and the earth,

403
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,160
the way of Yin and Yang,

404
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,400
even if I tell you the magic's principle,

405
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,160
how can you understand it?

406
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,920
I...

407
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,520
Zhu Yan, do you accept the punishment?

408
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,520
I...

409
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,960
I won't punish you.

410
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,280
You just need to copy and write the book of Yuan Xu Jing

411
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,760
and read it three times.

412
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,120
Read it three times?

413
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,760
There are so many books?

414
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,600
Send them to the Qingxiu Hall in three days.

415
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,120
Three days?

416
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,040
How can I copy them?

417
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,480
You reminded me of the right time.

418
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,840
You can save your time for dinner.

419
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,160
Isn't that enough?

420
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,800
Yan,

421
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,520
take a break.

422
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,320
You've been copying for half a day.

423
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,400
You haven't had breakfast,

424
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,960
and it's past lunchtime.

425
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,280
Shao Si Ming isn't here.

426
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,360
Just have some.

427
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,800
Forget it.

428
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,240
I can't let him look down on me.

429
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,680
I'd better finish it earlier.

430
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,600
I'd better eat something earlier.

431
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,080
Princess Xue Ying.

432
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,120
General Qing.

433
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,440
Princess Zhu Yan.

434
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,720
I have something important to discuss with you.

435
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,440
May I ask if you could stay away for a while?

436
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,920
Remember to eat.

437
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,920
Princess Zhu Yan,

438
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,720
I have a favor to ask.

439
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,640
Are you going to the Qingxiu Hall tomorrow

440
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,960
to find Shao Si Ming?

441
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,920
Could you...

442
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,240
Could you help me get a hair of Shao Si Ming?

443
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,680
I can help you copy the scriptures as a reward.

444
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,680
Shao Si Ming's hair?

445
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,160
I heard that Shao Si Ming is a genius in magic.

446
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,680
Getting his hair can make magic more effective.

447
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,800
So I...

448
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,600
It's okay if you don't want to.

449
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,680
Just pretend that I've never been here.

450
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,800
Wait.

451
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,040
You agreed?

452
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,720
I'll help you copy the scriptures now.

453
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,520
You don't have to help me copy the scriptures.

454
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,440
As long as you tell me what those words

455
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,480
mean when they're combined.

456
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,800
Snow Land

457
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,720
Your Majesty, Princess Snow Land is here.

458
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,640
Greetings, Da Si Ming.

459
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,720
Snow Land,

460
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,080
your performance in the mountains

461
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,520
has been very good in the past ten days.

462
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,760
Thank you, Da Si Ming.

463
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,680
Let me ask you.

464
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,920
When you came to Mount Jiuyi,

465
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,440
did your father

466
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,240
say anything to you?

467
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,400
Da Si Ming,

468
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,000
my father only said

469
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,800
to let me and my sister go back early.

470
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,440
If that's the case,

471
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,240
why are you still fighting for the position of Chief?

472
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,760
I stayed

473
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,960
because I'm different from my father.

474
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,720
I admire your high-quality

475
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,960
and powerful magic.

476
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,440
I'd like to follow you to have a rest.

477
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:56,920
Good.

478
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,000
I admire

479
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,920
a woman as ambitious as you.

480
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,240
This book

481
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,520
is the first magic of Mount Jiuyi

482
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,080
that I've ever learned.

483
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,720
Take it and practice it.

484
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,000
Thank you, Da Si Ming.

485
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,720
If you're interested,

486
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,600
please pay more attention

487
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,160
to that general of the Qing clan.

488
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,360
Qing Gang?

489
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:26,960
I'll do as you say.

490
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,760
If he does anything,

491
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,000
I'll report it to Da Si Ming.

492
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,000
Go ahead.

493
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,480
Come here.

494
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,520
My magic medicine is finally done.

495
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,920
Where is Lord Chong Ming?

496
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,920
In order to match

497
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,240
your color of soy sauce,

498
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,400
he went up the mountain and smashed it.

499
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,280
It's not difficult.

500
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,840
He can just ask me directly.

501
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,920
Chong Ming is also respected.

502
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,360
That's right.

503
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,640
He is a great bird.

504
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,000
How could he be as stupid,

505
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,040
reckless

506
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,000
and playful as me?

507
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,360
What are you doing?

508
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,400
You made a mistake and missed five words.

509
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,600
It's all related to the operation of the small boat.

510
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,240
You need to review this theory more.

511
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,680
The Book of Songs has 24 pages of book.

512
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,040
You can borrow it to read.

513
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,640
Don't you look down on me?

514
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,040
Why do you have to review it for me?

515
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,480
I know why you are in class.

516
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,840
It's because you were young

517
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
and your teacher didn't teach you theory.

518
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,160
You are not interested in theory.

519
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,560
You don't understand what the God said.

520
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,160
It's boring and boring.

521
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,680
That's why you are here.

522
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,160
I asked you to copy the scriptures

523
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,320
to make up for the lack of theory.

524
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,200
I will reveal the mistakes to you.

525
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,240
You can do it as soon as possible.

526
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,160
How do you know I am...

527
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,400
You are a human.

528
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,400
I know your advantages and disadvantages.

529
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,480
Including me?

530
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,000
Since you are my disciple,

531
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,120
I will take the responsibility of your teacher this month.

532
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,640
This is my responsibility.

533
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,400
But I hope you won't be ashamed.

534
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,600
As for how much you can listen,

535
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,360
it's your fate.

536
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,960
It has nothing to do with me.

537
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,840
Can you help me get a hair of Shao Si Ming?

538
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,520
I was listening to Shao Si Ming.

539
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,000
I almost forgot that I was just doing my job.

540
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,880
Shao Si Ming is serious and serious.

541
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,760
He is the best example.

542
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,360
You worked so hard to change Zhu Yan.

543
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,480
I should do something for you.

544
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:36,440
Or I can help you

545
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,680
to get Zhu Yan to blow the candle for you.

546
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,280
I got it.

547
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,360
You want me to get the jade jade

548
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,480
to blow the candle for you.

549
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,440
No.

550
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,560
Then you want me to get the jade jade

551
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,480
to blow the candle for you.

552
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,480
No.

553
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,720
Then you want me to get the jade jade

554
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,240
to stand farther away from you.

555
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,360
So that I can hear your teachings.

556
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,240
You said no.

557
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,840
Yes.

558
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,520
Since Shao Si Ming told me

559
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,240
not to stand farther away from you,

560
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,680
I'll stand farther away from you

561
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,480
to hear your teachings.

562
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,920
What are you thinking?

563
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,840
Does Shao Si Ming

564
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,680
want to watch Zhu Yan

565
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,000
be stupid,

566
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,400
reckless and naughty all his life?

567
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,360
Can't I

568
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,120
see him as a man

569
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,600
and do something for him?

570
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,480
You are so serious

571
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,400
about changing Zhu Yan's skin.

572
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,920
I want to do something for you, too.

573
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,920
Why are you defending me?

574
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,680
Look at your mistake.

575
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,680
It's the same as the last one.

576
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,120
You didn't solve the problem.

577
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,720
You need to break the rules

578
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,080
to make up for the mistakes of the past.

579
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,480
Then

580
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,000
open a book for me.

581
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,040
No.

582
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,360
Come with me.

583
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,120
Me? Now?

584
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,720
Where do we go?

585
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,600
Where?

586
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,000
It's noon.

587
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,680
It seems that you will take me to eat delicious food.

588
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,440
Wow.

589
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,800
Since you are interested in reading,

590
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,280
I will teach you the way to read.

591
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,840
The ten thousand books can be passed on

592
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,760
to greatly increase the speed of your reading.

593
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,920
The ten thousand books can be passed on?

594
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,360
What is that?

595
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,800
It's the most basic reading technique.

596
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,360
The six children

597
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,760
have learned it

598
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,480
in the first month of the school's birthday

599
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,840
in their families.

600
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,160
Everyone can do it.

601
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,480
But I can't.

602
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,200
Okay. I'll learn it.

603
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,240
When I went down the mountain in January,

604
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,680
I must have learned it.

605
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,280
Very good.

606
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,560
I want you to master it before it gets dark.

607
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,520
But

608
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,600
it's less than three hours.

609
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,240
I can teach you

610
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,400
three hours.

611
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,080
Turn on for me.

612
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,200
If anything extraordinary

613
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,240
happens and my head is covered in worms,

614
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,880
I will bring

615
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,880
It's very exciting.

616
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,520
I only feel a little confused in my head.

617
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,360
Not to mention understanding.

618
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,640
The person who practices the law

619
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,920
should improve his body's

620
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,920
weight, sound, movement,

621
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,080
and sense of movement

622
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,840
to the same as ordinary people.

623
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,680
The sound of all the books

624
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,880
only expands your hearing.

625
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,320
In the future,

626
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,280
there are more things

627
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,920
that are more than ordinary people

628
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,960
that you need to learn.

629
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,480
I see.

630
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,360
According to the method I taught you,

631
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,400
you should study hard.

632
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,760
If you succeed,

633
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,840
you can at least guarantee

634
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,280
that you won't sleep

635
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,360
in class when you are hungry.

636
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,640
A month later,

637
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,040
you go down the mountain and return to Tianji Feng City.

638
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,160
It's not a waste of time.

639
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,120
If you can't hold on,

640
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,640
the exit is over there.

641
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:54,880
Okay.

642
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,120
I'll learn.

643
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,720
What's so great about it?

644
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,200
I'll go down the mountain and return to Tianji Feng City.

645
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,400
I'll go down the mountain and return to Tianji Feng City.

646
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,520
I'll go down the mountain and return to Tianji Feng City.

647
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,640
I'll go down the mountain and return to Tianji Feng City.

648
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,880
I'll go down the mountain and return to Tianji Feng City.

649
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,160
I'll go down the mountain and return to Tianji Feng City.

650
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,360
I'll go down the mountain and return to Tianji Feng City.

651
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,560
I'll go down the mountain and return to Tianji Feng City.

652
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,880
I'll go down the mountain and return to Tianji Feng City.

653
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,080
I'll go down the mountain and return to Tianji Feng City.

654
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,320
I'll go down the mountain and return to Tianji Feng City.

655
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,320
I'll go down the mountain and return to Tianji Feng City.

656
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,320
I'll go down the mountain and return to Tianji Feng City.

657
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,280
Great!

658
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,760
I haven't had much food

659
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,520
in the past few days.

660
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,120
I finally have a good appetite for dinner.

661
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:56,840
Young Commander,

662
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,480
what delicious food have you prepared?

663
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,560
Sit down.

664
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,360
Thank you, Young Commander.

665
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,640
It doesn't taste good either.

666
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,120
Young Commander,

667
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,320
I'll go and have a look.

668
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,320
I'll go and have a look.

669
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,320
I'll go and have a look.

670
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,320
I'll go and have a look.

671
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,320
I'll go and have a look.

672
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,800
Young Commander,

673
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,800
are you going to

674
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,560
cook fish with some tea soup?

675
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,480
I don't like wedding food.

676
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,920
Then,

677
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,440
I've prepared other side dishes.

678
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,720
There are many wild mushrooms in the mountains.

679
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,600
I'm not good at talking.

680
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,360
I can't guess

681
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,440
what the fresh dishes you have prepared.

682
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,520
Road Sign of Xingyang

683
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,800
Just eat this?

684
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,280
Tea Soup Rice.

685
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,960
I haven't eaten much since this morning.

686
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,960
Just eat this.

687
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,080
How can I enjoy eating the meal?

688
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,960
how can I be full?

689
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,040
I'm afraid it's the last dinner

690
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,120
of Mt Jiper.

691
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,240
We don't know

692
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,040
the breakfast menu will be fulfilled.

693
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,240
N waterproof food

694
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,920
the rich can sing and sing the poor

695
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,960
for the last meal of the mountain.

696
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,640
If you don't want to eat,

697
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,040
I won't force you.

698
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,600
I want to eat.

699
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:12,640
Otherwise,

700
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,520
I won't be able to eat this.

701
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,640
Have you learned

702
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,960
the method of sending the sound of the ten thousand books?

703
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,440
The method taught by the Supreme Commander

704
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,440
is really amazing.

705
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,560
Don't flatter me.

706
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,200
What did you gain just now?

707
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,200
I just found out

708
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,960
that there is no difference

709
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,400
between the power of the ten thousand books

710
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,800
and the power of the ten thousand books.

711
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,400
How much did you borrow from the Heavenly Emperor?

712
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,160
You have to return it to him.

713
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,200
How much did you borrow from time?

714
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,640
You have to return it to time.

715
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,000
The more you are good at the magic of carving,

716
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,560
the more you harm yourself.

717
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,800
If you don't know the law,

718
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,840
you will be blinded.

719
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,920
It is possible that you will not be able to

720
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,400
learn the law and will go against the law.

721
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,160
Once there was a senior

722
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,000
who forced the beads

723
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,000
when the power of the magic was about to dissipate,

724
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,280
and caused the soul to fly and break.

725
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:05,800
I was too careless in the class a few days ago.

726
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,760
Thank you for waking me up.

727
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Knowing wrong can change.

728
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,120
Good at removing the smoke.

729
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,920
The method of carving is like the sea of smoke.

730
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,320
From now on,

731
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,240
if you have any questions,

732
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,600
you can ask me anytime.

733
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,080
Really?

734
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,080
It was recorded in the Book of Clouds and Waves.

735
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,600
There is a powerful poison heart technique

736
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,280
that can read the power of the ten thousand books.

737
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,280
It can read the thoughts of Dong Kong Zaren.

738
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,000
The superior asked you

739
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,960
if you know this technique.

740
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,280
Then he can also

741
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,440
see my thoughts and thoughts.

742
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,480
I know you are a person.

743
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,240
I won't use you.

744
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,240
Play with fire.

745
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,880
Why is there a word less?

746
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,840
You are not a fire.

747
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,240
Although you are a little naughty,

748
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,640
you can still be friendly.

749
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,160
Is this a reward for my hard work?

750
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:09,920
This is it.

751
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,720
This is the power of the ten thousand books.

752
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,640
I can read the power of the ten thousand books.

753
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,440
I can read the power of the ten thousand books.

754
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,040
I can read the power of the ten thousand books.

755
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:18,880
That's it.

756
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,600
Great.

757
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,320
Finally, I can eat fish.

758
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,560
This is my fish.

759
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,520
Delicious.

760
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,320
This is delicious.

761
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,000
This is my reward.

762
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,640
Lord Chongming,

763
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,680
since you only like fish head,

764
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,680
why don't you give me fish meat?

765
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,360
How about

766
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,920
I help you find the salt of the gold button?

767
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,440
But this is the fish I got first.

768
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,480
Chongming.

769
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,040
You can't catch it.

770
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:07,880
You are a human.

771
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,360
What fish can't you catch?

772
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,120
Come on.

773
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,080
Stop.

774
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,880
You can't catch it.

775
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,360
Come on.

776
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,080
Father said

777
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,800
once a tree has a blue light,

778
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,200
it means it has a feeling for Dragon God.

779
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,480
No wonder I was dizzy before.

780
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,720
Is Dragon God

781
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,400
around here?

782
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,680
But I came here two hundred years ago.

783
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,720
I don't feel like that.

784
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,280
Is Dragon God

785
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,480
awake again?

786
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,840
Is Dragon God's place

787
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,920
near Mount Jiuyi?

788
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,680
death

789
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,800
Young Messenger,

790
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,040
I have a gift for you.

791
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,600
is the first step in the ceremony.

792
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:41,640
Last time,

793
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,000
you already experienced the ceremony in the main hall.

794
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,480
You don't need to warm yourself up.

795
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,880
You can come now.

796
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,760
It's a good omen.

797
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,360
crown prince,

798
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,880
masterpiece,

799
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,280
Entertainment student,

800
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,560
does around us

801
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,680
you don't need to do it again.

802
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,720
That's different.

803
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,800
I was not convinced

804
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,240
before.

805
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,400
Today,

806
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,600
I have to do it properly

807
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,360
to show my sincerity.

808
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,400
You are just a disciple of Ji Ming.

809
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,520
You will go down the mountain after a month.

810
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,240
You don't need to be so grand.

811
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,280
As the Supreme Priest

812
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,280
said when he was making the jade seal,

813
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,400
a month's master

814
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,240
is a month's responsibility.

815
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:35,680
So,

816
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,520
as a disciple of a month,

817
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,640
I should do my duty as a disciple.

818
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,120
Master,

819
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,320
please allow me

820
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,840
to comb your hair.

821
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:54,520
Comb hair?

822
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,360
It's a skill

823
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,840
that I've learned since ancient times.

824
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,360
If it wasn't for the Supreme Priest's order,

825
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,320
the transmission of my ten thousand books,

826
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,360
I'm afraid

827
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,360
I would never learn

828
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,640
the etiquette of the Four Deities

829
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,200
and the words of the Master.

830
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,720
That was ten thousand years ago.

831
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,640
The etiquette has been abolished.

832
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,560
That's why

833
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,400
I can show my sincerity.

834
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,400
Master,

835
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,200
don't you owe me a wish?

836
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,400
Then my wish

837
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,920
will be changed into this.

838
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,200
Master,

839
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,320
I'm sorry.

840
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,480
I'm sorry.

841
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,560
I'm sorry.

842
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,720
I'm sorry.

843
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,880
I'm sorry.

844
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,040
I'm sorry.

845
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,200
I'm sorry.

846
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,360
I'm sorry.

847
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,520
I'm sorry.

848
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:44,680
I'm sorry.

849
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:45,840
I'm sorry.

850
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I'm sorry.

851
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,160
I'm sorry.

852
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,320
I'm sorry.

853
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,480
I'm sorry.

854
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,640
I'm sorry.

855
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:52,800
I'm sorry.

856
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:53,960
I'm sorry.

857
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,120
I'm sorry.

858
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,280
I'm sorry.

859
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,440
I'm sorry.

860
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,600
I'm sorry.

861
00:43:58,760 --> 00:43:59,760
I'm sorry.

862
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:00,920
I'm sorry.

863
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,080
I'm sorry.

864
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,880
I'm sorry.

865
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,040
I'm sorry.

866
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,320
I'm sorry.

867
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,800
Hello!

868
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,320
Hello, Ex perché.

869
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,480
My name is Xiaoci.

870
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:14,640
Miss Shen.

871
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,600
You are a cuckold now.

872
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,160
It is remarkable to see company growth.

873
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,360
And now

874
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,720
they will live here together in this modelling company.

875
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:27,480
And offer their gifts.

876
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,400
We will welcome you.

877
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:30,400
Come with us.

878
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,400
