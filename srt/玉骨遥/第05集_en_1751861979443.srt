1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The world is like a flower blooming in the night

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The yellow leaves are like the stars

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The yellow leaves are like the stars

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The yellow leaves are like the stars

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The yellow leaves are like the stars

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The yellow leaves are like the stars

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The yellow leaves are like the stars

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The yellow leaves are like the stars

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The yellow leaves are like the stars

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Give me a life of shining scenery

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I am a cloud in the sky

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I am a cloud in the sky

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I am the courage to fight for you

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I am the destiny that you have chosen

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I am the destiny that you have chosen

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I want to be the first person you met

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I want to be the first person you met

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The Long Ballad

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The Long Ballad

20
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Ying'er was supposed to be a demon

21
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
But now she is determined to revenge

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
How could she be so beautiful?

23
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Did someone in the mountain help her get through this?

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I just went to worship your mother

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Ying'er, your mother was so sad

26
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You must get back the justice for her

27
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Master, I have made a big mistake

28
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Now I can't disobey my mother's order

29
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I have decided to follow my mother's wish

30
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I will practice magic and never enter the family

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You bastard, I have told you

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Your mother said this to you for your safety

33
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Shouldn't you value your mother more?

34
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
She died for you today

35
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You should fight for her tomorrow

36
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
But master, if I am hated

37
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I will be the most ungrateful person my mother wants to see

38
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
That will be a disappointment for my mother

39
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I have made up my mind

40
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Please follow my wish

41
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Good

42
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You stay in the valley all day

43
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You are easy to be a coward

44
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Tomorrow is the ceremony

45
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
But you are not good at it

46
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Your talent is the most important

47
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I will order you to go to the Water Mirror tomorrow

48
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
To observe and record this ceremony

49
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You can go to the valley

50
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And see your brother

51
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You should know that he will be the one to take you to the ceremony

52
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yes

53
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Da Si Ming

54
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Da Si Ming, what's going on?

55
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
He asked me to go to the ceremony

56
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You can pretend to be sick and ask for mercy

57
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You forget that the princess is also on the mountain

58
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Of course I remember

59
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
But if I don't go, Da Si Ming will be suspicious

60
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I am afraid it will be more difficult to explain

61
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Cang Shu Ge is a little bit away from the ceremony

62
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I won't see him

63
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Chong Ming, don't worry

64
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I have made up my mind

65
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I won't be suspicious

66
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Good

67
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Now he is far away

68
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
If you see him again

69
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You must get rid of his memory

70
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Let him forget you completely

71
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So you can be safe

72
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Da Si Ming asked you to go to the ceremony

73
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
But there are hundreds of gods on Mount Jiuyi

74
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Why did he ask you to go?

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Why?

76
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Da Si Ming knows that Shi Yu and I have a deep relationship

77
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's good to see him for five years

78
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yes

79
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I don't want to compete with others

80
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
But I can't give up

81
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
How can I treat those who support me?

82
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Everyone

83
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Everyone

84
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Everyone

85
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Everyone

86
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Everyone

87
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Everyone

88
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Raise your head

89
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Breathe into the Dan Tian

90
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Nectar is empty

91
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Breathe in

92
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And breathe out

93
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Everyone

94
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
There is someone like me in this world

95
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Sorry

96
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I just passed by

97
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I didn't know someone was here

98
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's ok

99
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I am funny

100
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I want to laugh

101
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
But it's better than laughing

102
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Right?

103
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I have the same one

104
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Really?

105
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I have a lecture tomorrow

106
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I haven't prepared it yet

107
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm sorry

108
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Actually

109
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
My father wants me to be happy

110
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So he sent people to find this kind of secret

111
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
But

112
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Most people who can read this kind of secret

113
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
can say they know the art and can do it

114
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
They can't understand our pain

115
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's useless to read

116
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You are right

117
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You are not from the six branches, right?

118
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I

119
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I am a mountaineer

120
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So your father will take your class in public tomorrow?

121
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Almost

122
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Can you help me?

123
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I think

124
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
If it's me

125
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I will feel much better if someone is with me

126
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
That's a good idea

127
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Can you be the one who accompanies me?

128
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
We are strangers who meet each other by chance

129
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I am not that important

130
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You want to be brave, right?

131
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
We can form an alliance and encourage each other

132
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
We can name this alliance

133
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
The Alliance of the Fallen

134
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
No

135
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's so sad

136
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
How about the Alliance of the Night?

137
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
The Alliance of the Night?

138
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
The Alliance of the Night?

139
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I think

140
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I am like a person who walks in the night

141
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I hope I can walk to the dawn

142
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I can't get a good name for the first time

143
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Don't laugh at me

144
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
No

145
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
This is your progress

146
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Really?

147
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
From now on

148
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
From now on

149
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
We should be more and more brave

150
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
From now on

151
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
We should be more and more brave

152
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
My goal is

153
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
To pass the exam tomorrow

154
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
My goal is

155
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
No more being bullied

156
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Is there anyone bullying you?

157
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Actually

158
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
The one who can bully me is not someone else

159
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:16,680
It's my own

160
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I will be very angry if I am with a stranger

161
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Tomorrow

162
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You will see me pass the exam

163
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You are here

164
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,080
Brother

165
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,560
Why you suddenly appear?

166
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,240
Good.

167
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,840
Princess Snow-Cloaked is perfect in her dance.

168
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,760
She's gorgeous.

169
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,600
She's the best choice of the Star-Defying Envoy.

170
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,760
The Star-Defying Envoy

171
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,520
should be made by Princess Snow-Cloaked.

172
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,000
The dance of Princess Snow-Cloaked

173
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,400
is really good.

174
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,680
Since the dance of Princess Xueying

175
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,000
has been lost,

176
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,440
the Star-Defying Envoy has been...

177
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,360
Mengmeng.

178
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,640
Why is she here?

179
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,680
Sorry, Mengmeng.

180
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,920
I'm late.

181
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,680
The dance is...

182
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,360
The dance is remade.

183
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,560
Luckily,

184
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,680
I have the worm feather

185
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,360
that my mother left as decoration.

186
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,600
Mengmeng.

187
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,480
Can I still be the Star-Defying Envoy?

188
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,680
Although Princess Snow-Cloaked

189
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,080
has been disqualified for her fault,

190
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,040
she has been remade immediately.

191
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,560
You two are not different.

192
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:08,800
How about this?

193
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,480
We'll meet with Prince Shiyu later.

194
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,520
Please make your own decision.

195
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,000
Yes.

196
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,280
Yuan.

197
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,760
I received a precious gift

198
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,920
from the mountain.

199
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,160
So you must

200
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,440
find me a good item

201
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,520
and return it to her.

202
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,200
Don't let me be embarrassed.

203
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,560
Chief Steward Yuan.

204
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,280
You can find a good item

205
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,080
and return it to her in the mansion.

206
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,960
It's a small matter,

207
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,800
but it's very important to you.

208
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,600
Today is the opening of

209
00:12:50,760 --> 00:13:11,700
the

210
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,580
Ent freaking

211
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,260
plans.

212
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:23,420
фильм

213
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,220
'll be chosen for it!

214
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,820
faithful

215
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:27,940
Commandery Prince

216
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,700
to win the Grand 있2

217
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,300
Making of

218
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,460
Gee James

219
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,580
Momo

220
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,500
Yes.

221
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,920
Yilending Pass

222
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
The sea bass shell from deep sea.

223
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,500
Come and have a look.

224
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,500
The sea bass shell from deep sea.

225
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,500
Come and have a look.

226
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,500
Welcome.

227
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,500
The nine fountains in deep sea.

228
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,500
The black sand lake of a thousand years.

229
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,500
Welcome.

230
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,500
Come and have a look.

231
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,500
Great.

232
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,500
Great.

233
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,500
Great.

234
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,500
Great.

235
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,500
Great.

236
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,500
Great.

237
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,500
Come and have a look.

238
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,500
Sir, look.

239
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,500
Sir.

240
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,500
Come and have a look.

241
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,500
So heavy.

242
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,500
Sir, come and have a look.

243
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,500
The black armor of the Xuanzu is famous all over the world.

244
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,500
But it's not easy to meet our new treasure.

245
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,500
The iron plate.

246
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,500
It's not easy to make it by yourself.

247
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,500
Come and have a look.

248
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,500
Come and have a look.

249
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,500
Come and have a look.

250
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,500
Come and have a look.

251
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,500
Sir.

252
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,500
Look at the black sand lake in my home.

253
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,500
It's very good.

254
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,500
Sir.

255
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,500
Is there any better black sand lake?

256
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,500
You really want it?

257
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,500
I really have a good black sand lake.

258
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,500
This is made from the sea bass shell from deep sea.

259
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
I have been collecting it for more than ten years.

260
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,500
Look.

261
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,500
Especially this kind of gold shell is very precious.

262
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,500
It's more precious than the moon shell.

263
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,500
This is really extraordinary.

264
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,500
You have a good taste.

265
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,500
Sir.

266
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,500
Sir.

267
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,500
Sir.

268
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,500
Sir.

269
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,500
Sir.

270
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,500
This is too...

271
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,500
Sir.

272
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,500
Without us protecting you,

273
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,500
what business can you do?

274
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,500
Go to have a dream.

275
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,500
This is...

276
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,500
The Navy is coming again.

277
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,500
Look.

278
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,500
It's so annoying.

279
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,500
What Navy?

280
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,500
So many years.

281
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,500
The dragon god has been subdued.

282
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,500
The sea king is in danger.

283
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,500
After they finish eating,

284
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:22,520
they will look for the

285
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,540
Sir, what I have collected for you

286
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,540
is to make you a contribution to the Jiao clan.

287
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,540
Shi Xianghu, get up.

288
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,540
I beg you.

289
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,540
Get out.

290
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,540
No, sir.

291
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,540
Get out.

292
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,540
What are you looking at?

293
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,540
Get out.

294
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,540
Get out.

295
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,540
Old man, be careful.

296
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,540
Please take it.

297
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,560
These pearls should be enough

298
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,560
to buy the Jiao Xiao.

299
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,560
No, no, no.

300
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,560
The Jiao Xiao has been taken by the thief.

301
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,560
I can't take your money.

302
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,560
I have seen her eyes.

303
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,560
It's enough that she knows everything.

304
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,560
No, sir.

305
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,560
No, sir.

306
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,560
Unfortunately,

307
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,560
I have to give her another gift.

308
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,560
Sir, wait.

309
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,580
This is a token of my gratitude.

310
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,580
Please take it.

311
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,580
Thank you, sir.

312
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,580
Sir.

313
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,580
Sir.

314
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,580
Sir.

315
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,580
Sir.

316
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,580
Sir.

317
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,580
Sir.

318
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,580
Sir.

319
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,580
Sir.

320
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,580
Sir.

321
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,600
Sir.

322
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,600
Sir.

323
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,600
Are you the leftist?

324
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,600
I am Shi Tuo.

325
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,600
You saved me back then.

326
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,600
You have mistaken me.

327
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,600
Sir.

328
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,600
I will always remember your figure.

329
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,600
The Navy has changed.

330
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,600
People are coming to disturb us.

331
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,600
You can't leave me alone.

332
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,600
I told you.

333
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,600
I am not him.

334
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,600
Really?

335
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,620
Dad, what's wrong?

336
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,620
Ruyi.

337
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,620
Ruyi.

338
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,620
Why are you here?

339
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,620
It's not true.

340
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,620
He heard the name Ruyi.

341
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,620
He will never turn back.

342
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,620
Back then,

343
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,620
the sir called him the lonely star.

344
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,620
He saw someone who was bullied

345
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,620
and tried to kill him.

346
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,620
He will never let him continue to do evil.

347
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,620
The King's Valley is heavily guarded.

348
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,620
How can you break in?

349
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,620
The troupe will go to the sand.

350
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,620
You can buy the troupe.

351
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,620
You can save your money.

352
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,620
Sir.

353
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,620
Do you need some help?

354
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,620
The troupe will buy the troupe.

355
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,620
You can save your money.

356
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,620
The view is beautiful.

357
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,620
It's not as good as the Mount Jiuli.

358
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,620
Sir.

359
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,620
Your guest room service.

360
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,620
The troupe will book a hotel.

361
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,620
You can have fun.

362
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,620
Welcome, Your Highness.

363
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,620
How could it be him?

364
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,620
Greetings, Your Highness.

365
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,620
Please rise.

366
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,620
Thank you, Your Highness.

367
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,620
Because my father is busy at noon,

368
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,620
I am here

369
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,620
to pray for him.

370
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,620
Your Highness.

371
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,620
The ceremony is about to begin.

372
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,620
The two princesses of the Bai family are divided.

373
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,620
They are the top of the list.

374
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,620
I dare not make any decision.

375
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,620
Please make your own decision.

376
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,640
Princess Xue Lu.

377
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,640
Princess Xue Ying.

378
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,640
Are they both

379
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,640
the top of the list of the Bai family?

380
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,640
Your Highness.

381
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,640
Princess Xue Lu is not the top.

382
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,640
But she is very good at martial arts.

383
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,640
According to the ancestral rules,

384
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
the top of the list of Bai family should be the top of the list.

385
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,640
I think it's a good idea.

386
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,640
Your Highness.

387
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,660
According to the ancestral rules,

388
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:37,660
the top of the list of Bai family should be the top of the list.

389
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,660
We will follow the ancestral rules.

390
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,660
Yes.

391
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,660
Princess Xue Lu.

392
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,660
I am so talented.

393
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,660
I can't change the rules.

394
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,660
I don't have the advantage of martial arts.

395
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,660
You are so talented.

396
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,660
You must have other opportunities.

397
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,680
Yes.

398
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,680
Thank you, Your Highness.

399
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,680
Your Highness.

400
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,680
The three-day festival has been completed.

401
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,680
The auspicious time has come.

402
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,680
The ceremony can begin.

403
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,680
Although Your Highness didn't choose you as the star,

404
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,680
it's obvious that you have a different view of yourself.

405
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,700
Compared to this,

406
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,700
the reputation of Your Highness is much more important.

407
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,860
Public恩利

408
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,540
is more important for us.

409
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,840
Among all the adventures

410
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,300
in the six castles,

411
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,020
stands the silverта имไป

412
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:05,500
Which means

413
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,460
it's ah

414
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,740
My name is

415
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,540
YouTube

416
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,940
To serve you

417
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:22,340
as a martial boy

418
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:26,100
All the kind to worship it

419
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,860
I'll let you learn some

420
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,820
hidden in the second hell of the human world

421
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,840
and beautifully infusing the soul within you.

422
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,040
The adjuster has now stolen the seal

423
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,060
of the fuel of a circle.

424
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,420
We are taking the soul of death

425
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,480
for the sake of the way of sacrifice.

426
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:47,880
otticon,

427
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,940
I have abandoned the baby genius.

428
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,400
Yes, Prince.

429
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,660
I also want to thank you.

430
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,020
I'll let you see

431
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,180
that all your respect

432
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,060
has been taken by Shi Yu.

433
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,140
Bai Chuan.

434
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:14,900
Bai Chuan.

435
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:32,580
Your brother is far worse than you.

436
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,580
Don't underestimate him.

437
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,140
He can do it.

438
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,100
I hope you can trust yourself

439
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,020
and pass the test.

440
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,020
Bai Chuan is a strong man.

441
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,900
The world is bright.

442
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,740
The future is bright.

443
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,740
The future is bright.

444
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,140
The future is bright.

445
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,180
I, Zhao Xu,

446
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,700
welcome all gods

447
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,180
and prepare for victory.

448
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,180
I, Cheng Jiexia,

449
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,500
follow the example of the Emperor

450
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,860
and become the heir.

451
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,060
I, Zhang Huangzhou,

452
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,260
follow the example of the Emperor

453
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,780
and reflect on my mistakes.

454
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,100
I, Zhao Shi,

455
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,380
thank the Emperor

456
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,660
for raising me

457
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,180
and helping me for many lives.

458
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,500
I, Hong Ji,

459
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,740
follow the example of the Emperor

460
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,140
and try my best

461
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,580
to enjoy the world.

462
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,900
I, Fan Yu,

463
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,740
accept the help

464
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,980
of the late Emperor

465
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,260
and the ancestors

466
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,660
to help me

467
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,140
to have a good fortune

468
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,740
and live a peaceful life.

469
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,780
To have a good fortune and live a peaceful life.

470
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,580
How is it?

471
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,100
The child is good, right?

472
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,860
And he is so handsome.

473
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,300
He is not like you.

474
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,700
He is more like me.

475
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,300
I want to say

476
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,580
that all of you

477
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,180
are not as beautiful as me.

478
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,500
Of course.

479
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,340
But they are all

480
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,340
the strong-headed grass

481
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,660
that scolded you and made you angry.

482
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,780
They are not worthy of

483
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:06,860
my beauty.

484
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,260
I don't show up.

485
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,220
This is a punishment

486
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,140
that is unbearable to them.

487
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,660
I don't care about this anymore.

488
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:13,820
And you

489
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,940
don't have to worry about it.

490
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,660
Music.

491
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,020
Wuji.

492
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,960
Do you think you can always

493
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,860
make people happy?

494
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:05,180
Can you make money

495
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,980
from me each day?

496
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,620
Is that the only answer?

497
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,300
It's too much.

498
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,540
Then how about

499
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,640
I just play for you with our lives?

500
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:17,980
Well.

501
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,220
We can survive.

502
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:27,980
There!

503
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:28,560
There!

504
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,320
Isn't this...

505
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,680
Isn't this my feather?

506
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,440
She made a dance dress

507
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,520
and gave it to someone else.

508
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,680
How could she have the famous feather?

509
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,800
Did Yin'er really have someone to hide from that day?

510
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,880
It was this Bai Xueying.

511
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,760
She helped Yin'er get through the demon's heart.

512
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:51,960
It's too risky.

513
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,600
If Commander finds out,

514
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,000
she will be suspicious.

515
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,280
What should we do?

516
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,560
It's my duty.

517
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,640
I have to do this.

518
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,720
You're not in your right mind.

519
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,640
Go back quickly.

520
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,760
Or you'll break the bow.

521
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,960
Do you hear me?

522
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,000
Zhu Yan.

523
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:28,920
Zhu Yan.

524
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,600
Lord Xiao Chengguan.

525
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,680
Why are you here?

526
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,760
Before the dance ends,

527
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,080
try to get close to Wang Xing.

528
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,080
I...

529
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:35,760
Don't talk.

530
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,000
Just do as I say.

531
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,880
I can listen to you.

532
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,080
But why?

533
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,080
There's no time to explain.

534
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,880
Go break the feather of the insects.

535
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:43,840
I'll try my best.

536
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,560
Chen Jianzai.

537
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:57,960
Hurry.

538
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,240
Hurry.

539
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,440
Lord Xiao Chengguan.

540
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,600
Lord Xiao Chengguan.

541
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,080
Yan.

542
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,240
Are you okay?

543
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,600
I'm fine.

544
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,160
I just sprained my ankle.

545
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,560
Xue Yao.

546
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,160
You danced so well.

547
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,160
Luckily, I came back in time.

548
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,160
In my opinion,

549
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,320
you don't have to wait till you're 18.

550
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,160
Princess Chizu

551
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,200
asked you to accept the knot immediately.

552
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,320
What a bad luck!

553
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,680
There won't be any regret

554
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,880
in this matter.

555
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,640
I hope that Da Siming

556
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,760
won't suspect it.

557
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:03,880
Have you ever

558
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,040
removed his memory?

559
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,120
His wish

560
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,840
is not your wish.

561
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:11,960
What?

562
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,640
Thank you for your help.

563
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,160
Especially, the princess of the Bai family.

564
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,240
Princess Xue Lu.

565
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,480
You danced so well.

566
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,280
Thank you, Your Highness.

567
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,560
You're so kind.

568
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,400
I knew it.

569
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,640
Your Highness is so kind.

570
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,600
Are you okay?

571
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,280
I need your help.

572
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,840
The dance dress is so beautiful.

573
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,360
How did you get it?

574
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,680
Your Excellency,

575
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,360
my late mother gave me this dance dress

576
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,720
before I died.

577
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,360
The name of the dance dress is very precious.

578
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,440
It's in the palace.

579
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,200
How did your mother get it?

580
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,000
Well, I said

581
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,240
I couldn't tell anyone.

582
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,920
I didn't ask anyone.

583
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,320
Or,

584
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,560
someone you can't tell

585
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,880
gave it to you.

586
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,520
What do you mean?

587
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,200
My mother did give me this dance dress.

588
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,520
Chongming did have a problem.

589
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,720
It was cut off

590
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,920
and it was not in the public.

591
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,040
Did Princess Bai get it?

592
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,200
Did I think too much?

593
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,520
Please continue.

594
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,520
As expected, Your Excellency

595
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,840
doesn't want people to know about the little priest.

596
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,400
I almost got into trouble.

597
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,080
It's all my fault.

598
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,880
I didn't keep my promise.

599
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,520
No wonder

600
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,360
he was so angry just now.

601
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,080
He left without saying anything.

602
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,040
Apply it on both sides.

603
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:38,920
Apply it all.

604
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,240
Yes.

605
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,640
Yan'er.

606
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,000
It hurts.

607
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,760
I told you to be gentle.

608
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,200
Father, why are you here?

609
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:50,920
Your Highness.

610
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,280
Now, the two kings are competing on Mount Jiuyi.

611
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,520
It's raining.

612
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,400
I'm worried that I'll stay here.

613
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,200
Are you okay?

614
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,560
I'll be gentle.

615
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,720
You can't be alone.

616
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,080
Let's go home as soon as possible.

617
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,800
My foot is hurt like this.

618
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,320
I can't stand the pain of going down the mountain.

619
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,280
It's not a sprain.

620
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,640
You're sitting on a carriage.

621
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,040
You can't walk on your own.

622
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,400
Why can't you walk?

623
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,200
I'm very hurt.

624
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,040
It's very serious.

625
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,280
It's an old injury.

626
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,600
I was hurt once when I went down the mountain.

627
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,920
Right, Yufei?

628
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,040
Yes, Your Highness.

629
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,440
And I've been working hard

630
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,440
to practice martial arts these days.

631
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,680
I felt exhausted.

632
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,880
My stomach hurts.

633
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,240
I feel tired and restless.

634
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,120
If I go down the mountain with my father,

635
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,840
I'll be seriously ill.

636
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,800
Father knows you're a cunning person.

637
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,120
You also know I'm in trouble.

638
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,640
Prince Bai is in a hurry to marry his daughter.

639
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,200
And Prince Qing is in a hurry to have a heir.

640
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,680
They almost broke their faces today.

641
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,600
If I go down the mountain again,

642
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,880
they'll force me to stand on the right foot.

643
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,240
It would be great if Mother were here.

644
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,400
She won't be like you

645
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,360
and ignore me.

646
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,600
Okay.

647
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,800
Then you should rest for another day.

648
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,640
We'll set out tomorrow morning.

649
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,360
Don't walk too much.

650
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,920
This is a gift from Prince Shiyu

651
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,280
to the two princesses of Bai's Mansion.

652
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,600
It's a pair of pearl earrings.

653
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,440
Thank you, Your Highness.

654
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,560
Thank you, Momo.

655
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,800
Tui Liu, let's go.

656
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,240
Where are you going?

657
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,920
I'm going to send the medicine to Yan.

658
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,280
I heard that Princess Zhu Yan

659
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,480
is not rewarded.

660
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,560
She's really a sister of Princess Xue Ying.

661
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,280
Qing He.

662
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,160
Your Highness.

663
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,520
I'm here to see you.

664
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,560
I'm here to see you.

665
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,840
I'm here to see you.

666
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,960
I'm here to see you.

667
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,080
I'm here to see you.

668
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,200
I'm here to see you.

669
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,280
Let's go.

670
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,000
Your Highness.

671
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,040
I came to apologize to joint officer.

672
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,600
I was very careful when I came.

673
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,000
No one will find out.

674
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,600
It was my fault last time.

675
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,880
I shouldn't have given the feather to someone else.

676
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,240
I almost caused trouble for the Magistrate.

677
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,200
But I came here

678
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,800
to apologize to her in person.

679
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,680
Please let me see her.

680
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,400
As I expected,

681
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,280
this woman is really confusing.

682
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,480
I'll just kill her.

683
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,600
Tell me.

684
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,680
Magistrate.

685
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:10,840
Stop.

686
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,920
I've told you not to enter the valley.

687
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,120
Why are you here?

688
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,040
I...

689
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,440
I'm here to apologize...

690
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,280
I'm here to apologize.

691
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,240
You know,

692
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,680
my foot is injured.

693
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,560
It hurts so much.

694
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,040
Magistrate,

695
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,880
please let me finish.

696
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,200
I don't care about the pain.

697
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,200
You fell down when you were dancing?

698
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,720
Why is your right foot injured?

699
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,800
Actually,

700
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,800
my foot is injured.

701
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,280
But I'm sincere in apologizing.

702
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,480
Because Xueying is my good friend.

703
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,120
I can't bear to see her be framed

704
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,920
and lose the qualification of the Magistrate.

705
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,360
That's why I gave the feather to her.

706
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,680
Sorry.

707
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,080
I didn't consider it seriously enough.

708
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:12,920
I'm sorry.

709
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:15,920
Fine.

710
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,240
Since you're here today,

711
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,560
let's finish this.

712
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,560
What's your wish?

713
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,720
Tell me.

714
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,320
I'll fulfill it for you.

715
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,160
My wish?

716
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,720
My wish is

717
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,520
to be a teacher.

718
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,960
Is there really a magic

719
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,960
that can make the primordial spirit

720
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,760
come back to life?

721
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,520
You don't want to learn

722
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,640
the magic of the primordial spirit, do you?

723
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,000
How do you know?

724
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,440
Did I tell you

725
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,800
when I first met you?

726
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,120
Magistrate, I'm not stupid.

727
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,000
And I have the foundation of magic.

728
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,480
You'll promise me, right?

729
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,200
You want to learn this magic

730
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,280
to show your understanding of magic.

731
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,640
You're shallow and boring.

732
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,880
You're just like the six sons.

733
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,200
Men learn magic

734
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,960
to pursue fame and wealth.

735
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,920
Women learn magic

736
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,480
to decorate their family

737
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,960
and marry a good family.

738
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,200
I won't accept

739
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,600
such a disciple.

740
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,080
Give up on it.

741
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,000
I'm not here to pursue fame and wealth.

742
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,560
I'm not here to marry.

743
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:27,880
I...

744
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,000
I'm here for a person.

745
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,360
I told you before

746
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,520
that my old friend

747
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,240
died because of a conspiracy.

748
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,840
I want to learn this magic

749
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,960
to make him come back to the mortal world.

750
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,120
But everyone,

751
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,800
even the Commander, said

752
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,440
there's no such magic in the world.

753
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,320
So I thought

754
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,840
maybe only a master like you

755
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,280
can teach me.

756
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,320
I really want to save him.

757
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,400
You want to revive him?

758
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,240
Yes.

759
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,440
You saved me before.

760
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,760
So I thought

761
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,280
maybe you can make him come back to the mortal world.

762
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,040
I want to save him.

763
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,440
Master, please.

764
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,000
Please teach me.

765
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:18,920
No.

766
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,280
They're right.

767
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,720
There's no such magic in the world.

768
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,040
Master,

769
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,640
you're joking, right?

770
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,000
I advise you

771
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,120
not to waste your life

772
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,920
for a ridiculous idea.

773
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,040
Why did you do that?

774
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,480
No.

775
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,800
You don't know.

776
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,200
He's worth it.

777
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,840
I can't fulfill this wish.

778
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,440
Say something else.

779
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,560
I don't have any other wishes.

780
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,520
I only have this one wish.

781
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:08,960
Good.

782
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,400
I'll return this to you.

783
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,680
I hope you won't come back.

784
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,720
Is it really gone?

785
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,480
I've been so determined this time.

786
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,120
He won't come back.

787
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,760
Chongmin, you...

788
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,200
It's so touching.

789
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,280
I was so desperate.

790
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,080
But I was fooled by the fortune.

791
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,280
Why did he do that?

792
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,080
If he didn't go to the mortal world,

793
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,880
he would still be a traitor.

794
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,520
After I kill him,

795
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,000
I'll buy him more poison.

796
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,140
Your Highness!

797
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:11,880
Your Highness!

798
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,120
Your Highness!

799
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,080
Liu,

800
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,280
send the medicine to Зhuyuan.

801
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,120
I want to be alone for a while.

802
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,720
But...

803
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,960
I can't show him

804
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,720
Yes.

805
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,240
Xueying.

806
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,200
You...

807
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,440
Are you angry because I hid my identity

808
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,200
or because of what happened today?

809
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,440
None of them.

810
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,320
How many women have you met?

811
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,200
It's natural that you don't know me.

812
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,240
How could I not know you?

813
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,120
You are the Snow White.

814
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,080
The white of Snow White.

815
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,560
The snow of Snow White.

816
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,120
The white of Snow White.

817
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:00,680
I have something for you.

818
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,400
It's not that pretty.

819
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,400
It's natural that you dislike it.

820
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:09,640
But

821
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,400
I made it myself.

822
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,240
Then...

823
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,440
Then why did you...

824
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,120
I wanted to protect you.

825
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,240
I wanted to protect you.

826
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,440
I wanted to protect you.

827
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,680
I wanted to protect you.

828
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:33,760
I wanted to protect you.

829
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,320
I wanted to protect you.

830
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,080
What does that mean?

831
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,720
Your father urged us to get married as soon as possible.

832
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,280
But my mother and Juezhu didn't want to.

833
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,440
If they knew that we were close,

834
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,200
I wouldn't dare to think about it.

835
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:55,480
Although we want to keep the secret between us,

836
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,120
and we can't see each other often,

837
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,760
our alliance

838
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,320
is in our hearts.

839
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,200
We can't let go of each other.

840
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,400
We can't let go of each other.

841
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,480
We can't let go of each other.

842
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,680
We can't let go of each other.

843
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:09,760
We can't let go of each other.

844
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,960
We can't let go of each other.

845
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,120
We can't let go of each other.

846
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,360
We can't let go of each other.

847
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,600
We can't let go of each other.

848
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,760
We can't let go of each other.

849
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,960
We can't let go of each other.

850
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,160
We can't let go of each other.

851
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,200
We can't let go of each other.

852
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,440
We can't let go of each other.

853
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,600
We can't let go of each other.

854
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,800
We can't let go of each other.

855
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,000
We can't let go of each other.

856
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,200
We can't let go of each other.

857
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,200
We can't let go of each other.

858
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,360
We can't let go of each other.

859
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:02,400
I can't let go of you anymore.

860
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:07,480
Touring every corner and building the.

861
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:12,320
How to relationship,

862
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,600
how can we be together.

863
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,280
Can't hold back.

864
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,120
Everyday is my problem,

865
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:22,120
No way.

866
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:27,120
The heart you left

867
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:32,120
You have been missing me

868
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:37,120
Even if I have to leave you

869
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:42,120
I am by your side

870
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:47,120
The heart you left

871
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:52,120
You have been missing me

872
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:57,120
Even if I have to leave you

873
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:02,120
I am by your side

874
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:22,120
I am by your side

875
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:27,120
The heart you left

876
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:32,120
You have been missing me

877
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:37,120
Even if I have to leave you

878
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:42,120
I am by your side

879
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:53,120
The Heart You Left
