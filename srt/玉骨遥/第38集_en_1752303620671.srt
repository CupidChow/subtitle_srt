1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,420
the

2
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,720
audiences

3
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:01,920
Time flies, I want to be with you

4
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:09,520
Give me a life of shining scenery

5
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,120
I am a flower, you are a spring

6
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,920
I am a flower, you are a spring

7
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,520
I am a flower, you are a spring

8
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,520
I am a flower, you are a spring

9
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,120
I am a flower, you are a spring

10
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,920
In the vast sea of clouds

11
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,520
I want to be with you

12
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,120
In my heart

13
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,920
We have loved each other, right?

14
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,320
I am leaving

15
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,520
Zhu Yan

16
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,720
You saved me

17
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,120
Yes

18
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,720
Xue Lu and I are going to Jiuyi Mountain

19
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,120
to discuss the key with Shao Siming

20
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,720
We didn't expect to bump into you

21
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,520
You are together

22
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,520
Xue Lu is my wife now

23
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,520
Although Jiu died, it is not regretted

24
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,520
In the end, the beauty returns

25
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,520
Congratulations

26
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,320
Thank you

27
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,720
Xue Lu, since you chose Qingang

28
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,320
I believe you will be together

29
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,520
We will be friends in the future

30
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:15,120
I want to apologize for the mistakes I made before

31
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,720
Let bygones be bygones

32
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,520
I haven't thanked you for saving me

33
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:30,120
Well, you are going to find Shao Siming, right?

34
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,920
I won't bother you

35
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,320
You should go

36
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,120
Don't mention my name

37
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,120
Zhu Yan

38
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,320
What happened between you and Shao Siming?

39
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,320
Don't ask me if you don't want to say

40
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,720
You just recovered

41
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,520
If you can't hear or see it suddenly

42
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,320
We don't have anything important

43
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,720
So we stay here for a few days

44
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,120
But...

45
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,120
But what?

46
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,720
You just said you would treat us as friends

47
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,320
Now you are going back on your word?

48
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,920
I will go to see how the medicine is going

49
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,120
Tell me your story

50
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,320
Bai Feng Lin is a traitor

51
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,320
He didn't admit what he did

52
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,320
We came here all the way till Qingang came

53
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,920
But we didn't take my mother's tablet back to Bai's mansion

54
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,720
I feel a little sorry

55
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,520
If your mother is in heaven

56
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,720
will she really go back to Bai's mansion?

57
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,520
Xue Lu

58
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,520
I believe as a mother

59
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,720
I don't care about a heartless man

60
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,320
who doesn't want to give his name

61
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,720
And I don't care about a meaningless tablet

62
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,720
But you

63
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,120
He is the most worried daughter

64
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,720
Xue Lu

65
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,320
You and Qingang are in love

66
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,520
Your magic is already in Bai's family

67
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,720
This is what he wants to see the most

68
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,920
His daughter is the same as he expected

69
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,720
She grows up as a mother

70
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,720
and is unworthy of Xue Lu

71
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:45,700
The reason why the white ancestors and the white

72
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,320
Xue Lu

73
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,720
You have taken the first step

74
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,320
and fly to heaven

75
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,720
Go to the wider world

76
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,920
Do you feel better?

77
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,120
Things and changes are fine

78
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,520
Thank you

79
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,720
But we have to find a way to get back

80
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,920
the other three things

81
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,720
Don't worry

82
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,320
Thank you for being here

83
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,120
By the way, Qingang

84
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,320
I owe you an explanation about the Zhao Yun Du case

85
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,920
I am not a spy of the Navy

86
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,320
I just don't want to see

87
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,720
so many innocent lives

88
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,520
die in this disaster for nothing

89
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,720
I guessed it

90
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,920
I think the same as you

91
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,720
But

92
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,120
it's a big thing

93
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,520
But after you recover

94
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,120
you still need to give the officials

95
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,920
a reason to make it clear

96
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,520
It's a deal

97
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:54,920
Zhu Yan

98
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,720
Xue Lu

99
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,720
The young minister is going to resign

100
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,920
and go to hell

101
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,920
Really?

102
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,720
The mountain is preparing for the ceremony

103
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,920
The holy officials are coming to Jiuyi Mountain

104
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,320
Master just recovered

105
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,920
How can I stand it?

106
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,920
No wonder you don't want to tell us

107
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,920
The young minister died for you

108
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,520
so he wants to take off his robe

109
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,520
You left Jiuyi Mountain for Bixian

110
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,920
But after today

111
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,320
you and him have no more names

112
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,320
and can be together with him

113
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,720
I feel a little uncomfortable

114
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,920
I'll go back and rest

115
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,720
Zhu Yan

116
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,720
Zhu Yan

117
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,120
Zhu Yan, are you awake?

118
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,120
Zhu Yan

119
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:04,920
Zhu Yan

120
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,720
Where is he?

121
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,120
Did he go to Jiuyi Mountain by himself?

122
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,720
I think so

123
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,320
He must be worried

124
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,920
after hearing the news about the young minister

125
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,520
I hope they can take this opportunity

126
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,720
to solve the misunderstanding

127
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,520
Qin Gang, take the edict

128
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,320
The emperor's son Qing Yun

129
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,120
was poisoned by the poison of the poison

130
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,720
and killed the emperor

131
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,520
It's hard to tolerate

132
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,120
and the people are angry

133
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,920
He is now sentenced to death

134
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,120
His brother Qing Dongfang

135
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,520
colluded with the foreign tribes

136
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,320
and committed a crime

137
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,920
and was sentenced to death

138
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,320
According to the edict of the national law

139
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,120
Qin Gang is loyal and brave

140
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,520
He is a good official

141
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,320
and a good official

142
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,920
He is the leader of the country

143
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,720
and he is considered the King of Qing

144
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,720
That's all

145
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,320
I obey the edict

146
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,920
Thank you, Your Majesty

147
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,120
If the emperor asks the King of Qing

148
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,920
to return to Jialan to be sealed

149
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,320
please leave as soon as possible

150
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,120
After this matter

151
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,320
I will return to Jialan immediately

152
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,120
Good, that's good

153
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,920
The navy was in chaos before

154
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,120
and the soldiers were active secretly

155
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,520
At this time, heroes like the King of Qing

156
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,120
who are brave and good at fighting

157
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,920
are making great achievements

158
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,120
The army

159
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,320
Yes

160
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,320
On the way to Jiuyi County

161
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,520
we met a group of

162
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,520
hasty soldiers

163
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,520
They should have gone

164
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,720
to Jiuyi Mountain

165
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,920
Qin Gang

166
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,720
We have to go to Jiuyi Mountain immediately

167
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,320
Those people must have gone for Shao Siming

168
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,920
Do they want to take advantage of Shao Siming

169
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,520
and just leave Wanjie hell

170
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,720
and attack when they have no strength to resist

171
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,520
Yes

172
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:10,920
Go

173
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,720
Go

174
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:12,720
Ma Long

175
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,120
This is the way to practice jade

176
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,720
I will never regret it.

177
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,920
I've been a god for a long time.

178
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,920
I was born in the year of the ox.

179
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,320
I'm willing to serve the gods for life.

180
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,120
Today,

181
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,320
I'm not in the mood to leave,

182
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,320
but I'm already moved.

183
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,720
I'm determined to leave today.

184
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,320
I'm guilty for my sins.

185
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,720
I'm willing to

186
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,320
die for the sake of the gods.

187
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,920
I'm willing to

188
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,920
die for the sake of the gods.

189
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,720
I'm willing to die for the sake of the gods.

190
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,520
I'll wear the jade with the blood of the ox.

191
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,280
I'll go to the mountains and rivers and

192
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,320
the sea to atone for my sins.

193
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,720
Today,

194
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,120
I'll personally resign to the gods.

195
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,920
I'll die for the sake of the gods.

196
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,920
Go.

197
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,920
Give up your flesh and blood

198
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,520
and atone for your sins.

199
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,120
Then,

200
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,320
you can take off your robe

201
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,120
and return to the mortal world.

202
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:42,920
Ying'er,

203
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,520
whether Chen Xin has moved,

204
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,920
only you know.

205
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,120
You can continue to be your bodyguard.

206
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,520
Why must you go to the mountains and rivers?

207
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,320
No.

208
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,120
The gods already know.

209
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,920
I'm willing to die for the sake of the gods.

210
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,120
I'm willing to die for the sake of the gods.

211
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,120
I know.

212
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,920
The Jiuyi Mountain disciple Shi Ying

213
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,120
is willing to take off his robe

214
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,920
and return to the mortal world

215
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,520
to atone for his sins.

216
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,920
He will not die.

217
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,520
The Jiuyi Mountain disciple Shi Ying

218
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,320

227
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,320

228
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,120
I'm willing to die for the sake of the gods.

229
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,720
I'm willing to die for the sake of the gods.

230
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,320
I'm willing to die for the sake of the gods.

248
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,120
Ying'er.

249
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,320
Mother.

250
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,520
Ying'er.

251
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,120
Mother.

252
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,320
Mother.

253
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,920
In my whole life,

254
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,520
I'm like the bird on the screen in the palace.

255
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,520
Even if I can escape,

256
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,720
I won't have a soul.

257
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,120
I will send you out of the palace.

258
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,920
Don't worry.

259
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,720
I will pray for you every day in the palace.

260
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,720
I will never ask for a short sword.

261
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,720
I will make those who harm us

262
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,720
sincerely.

263
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,320
But your fake death

264
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,720
is a crime of deceiving the emperor.

265
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,520
Once you leave,

266
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,920
don't come back.

267
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,920
No.

268
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,320
I will never leave you alone

269
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,520
in the palace.

270
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,320
Mother.

271
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,520
A human heart is not like a bird in a cage.

272
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,720
It's like a garden.

273
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,720
All the past

274
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,720
has been destroyed.

275
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,520
As long as the spring breeze blows,

276
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,720
it will revive.

277
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,320
Mother.

278
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,520
The free sky outside the city of Jialan

279
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,520
is the spring breeze.

280
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,120
Mother.

281
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,520
I will protect you

282
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,520
for the rest of my life.

283
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,440
Wait, don't move.

284
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,560
Turn now.

285
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,720
You think you can save me?

286
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,720
No!

287
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,720
No!

288
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,720
No!

289
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,720
No!

290
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,720
No!

291
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,720
No!

292
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,720
No!

293
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,720
Mother!

294
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,720
No!

295
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,720
She...

296
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,720
What's wrong with her?

297
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,720
This is the heart demon illusion.

298
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,720
The heart is evil and the heart is evil.

299
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,720
Ying'er is facing the biggest fear and pain in her life.

300
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,720
She is trying to get her own blood to fight against the hell.

301
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,720
If she can't defeat it,

302
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,720
she will become a demon and will never be convinced.

303
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,720
Become a demon?

304
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,720
Aren't you afraid that your heart will turn into my leg?

305
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,720
Brother Lin,

306
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:53,980
I will fight a guest to

307
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,180
Greenye.

308
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,720
Thank you, Greenye.

309
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,720
Please consider it as my last wish.

310
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,720
It's really you.

311
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,320
Master, it's me.

312
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,720
Why are you here?

313
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,160
I've been waiting for you.

314
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,280
It's you.

315
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,200
You killed my Yuan.

316
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,720
Why did you do that?

317
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,400
Why?

318
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,720
I want to kill you.

319
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,320
I want to kill you!

320
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,120
Fine.

321
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,120
I want to kill you!

322
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,400
Master, no!

323
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,160
No!

324
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,320
Master!

325
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,560
Master!

326
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,920
Master!

327
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,640
No!

328
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,840
Master!

329
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,280
Master!

330
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,840
Master!

331
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,200
Master!

332
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I'm sorry.

333
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,920
I killed the man you love.

334
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,280
I'll pay you back.

335
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,240
Master, stop it!

336
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,280
Stop it!

337
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,360
Master!

338
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,640
I want to kill you!

339
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,120
Master!

340
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,680
Master!

341
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,120
Master!

342
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,120
Master!

343
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,480
Zhuyuan!

344
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,880
Master!

345
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,320
Master...

346
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,120
Master...

347
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,400
Master!

348
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,120
I'm afraid.

349
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,580
Master.

350
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,720
Ten of cs butterfly,

351
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,440
9999 minha,

352
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,520
that is the hoş law of heart demon.

353
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,560
That is the doctrinal veil

354
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,600
when abusing army and pile it up.

355
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,400
Am I wrong?

356
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,960
You say,

357
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,840
Now, it has ended.

358
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:19,920
What's next

359
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,160
is my ultimate takeover.

360
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,020
Merciless childhood.

361
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:32,880
Master.

362
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,440
Master.

363
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,960
Master!

364
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,960
Master!

365
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,560
Thunder stormed the Qi Sea

366
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,560
and took back all the cultivation of the passers-by.

367
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,560
Master!

368
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,560
Master!

369
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,560
Master!

370
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,560
Master!

371
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,560
The passers-by

372
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,560
have fallen on this last stage.

373
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,560
Ying,

374
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,560
you must succeed!

375
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,560
Master!

376
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,560
Master!

377
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,560
Master!

378
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,560
Master!

379
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,560
Master!

380
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,560
Ying!

381
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,560
Master!

382
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,560
Master!

383
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,560
Ying!

384
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,560
Ying!

385
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,560
Master!

386
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,560
Ying!

387
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,560
It's really you.

388
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,560
You really came.

389
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,560
Ying!

390
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,560
Master!

391
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,560
For this day,

392
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,560
I have prepared for ten years.

393
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,560
As long as he takes this spiritual medicine,

394
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,560
and gives him some spiritual power,

395
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,560
he can be saved.

396
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,560
Ying!

397
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,560
Ying!

398
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,560
Master!

399
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,560
The food is not good for those who come.

400
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,560
It's hard to break through

401
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,560
the ice barrier set by them.

402
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,560
Protect Shi Ying.

403
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,560
You ice-cooked food

404
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,560
actually came from the Qing Dynasty.

405
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,560
You are willing to go to the clouds

406
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,560
and destroy the world.

407
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,560
If you are willing to go to the clouds,

408
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,560
then you should go to the sky.

409
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,560
If you don't go to the sky,

410
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,560
then you will be destroyed.

411
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,560
I'm also willing to go to the sky.

412
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,560
I'm willing to go to the sky.

413
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,560
I'm willing to go to the sky.

414
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,560
I'm willing to go to the sky.

415
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,560
I'm willing to go to the sky.

416
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,560
It's my first time in the past thousand years.

417
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,560
Can you tell me

418
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,560
who gave you the courage

419
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,560
to enter Mount Jiuli?

420
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,560
Why do you know so much

421
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,560
about the people who are about to die?

422
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,560
Wait!

423
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,560
Shi!

424
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,560
Shi Feng Ju Mian!

425
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,560
We are both on the verge of death.

426
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,560
Protect Shi Ying.

427
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,560
Shi Ying!

428
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,560
Yin Yang Xiang Mu,

429
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,560
I will destroy it.

430
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,560
Yuan Zhu!

431
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,560
Da Si Ming!

432
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,560
Zun Sha!

433
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,560
Da Si Ming!

434
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,560
Da Si Ming!

435
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,560
Da Si Ming!

436
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,560
Dappa?!

437
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,560
Da Si Ming!

438
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,560
Shi Feng?

439
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,560
Master?

440
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,560
Ying Er?

441
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,560
Ying Er.

442
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:39,560
Say it!

443
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,560
Askّ whose son I'mand your master?

444
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:21,560
I can't protect your cultivation.

445
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,560
Your Majesty,

446
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,560
Yan'er told me

447
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,560
that you're protecting her.

448
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,560
But I know

449
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,560
that you can't protect her.

450
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,560
I'm sorry.

451
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,560
I'm sorry.

452
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,560
I'm sorry.

453
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,560
I'm sorry.

454
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,560
But I know

455
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,560
that you did all this

456
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,560
for me.

457
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,560
For me.

458
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,560
For me.

459
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,560
Yan'er.

460
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,560
Yan'er.

461
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,560
Yan'er.

462
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,560
Wait.

463
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,560
What else?

464
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,560
I know.

465
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,560
Yan,

466
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,560
don't marry Shi Jun.

467
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,560
Come with me.

468
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,560
I don't want to

469
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,560
see

470
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,560
your eyes again.

471
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,560
I'm sorry.

472
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,560
Liu Mei.

473
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,560
I'm sorry.

474
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,560
I'm sorry, Yan.

475
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,560
Yan,

476
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,080
Qiu Shui An

477
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,400
was the one

478
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,200
who used the poison

479
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,120
to manipulate your mother.

480
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,760
After the news was out,

481
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,360
she chose to commit suicide on the spot.

482
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,040
And the King of Qin

483
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,720
was also expelled from the throne.

484
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,160
Before I die,

485
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,800
let me ask you

486
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,280
why you fell to the river

487
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:32,440
for the

488
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,400
good of their mother and son.

489
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,400
It's not an accident.

490
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,400
Maybe Kong Sang

491
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,400
will fall into the fire again.

492
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,400
Ying'er,

493
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,400
you've been reborn,

494
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,400
but you have no power.

495
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,400
I wanted to advise you

496
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,400
to be careful and be careful.

497
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,400
No.

498
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,400
But I know

499
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,400
your temperament

500
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,400
will never be

501
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,400
in a mess.

502
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,400
Ying'er,

503
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,400
do everything

504
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,400
with both your strength

505
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,400
and your strength.

506
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,400
Don't force yourself.

507
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,400
It's good to have no regrets.

508
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,400
Because in this world,

509
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,400
nothing is more important

510
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,400
than life.

511
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,400
Back then,

512
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,400
I chose

513
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,400
to be a fool

514
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,400
and let your father

515
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,400
take over the throne.

516
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,400
My brother

517
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,400
was the emperor's concubine.

518
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,400
It caused the court

519
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,400
to be in chaos.

520
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,400
Kong Sang was in danger.

521
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:21,400
We were wrong.

522
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,400
It wasn't those

523
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,400
innocent people.

524
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,400
You have to help us

525
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,400
to make up for this mistake.

526
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,400
You have to make this land

527
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,400
return to the peace of the sea.

528
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,400
Your Majesty,

529
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,400
I hope you can meet my mother

530
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,400
in heaven.

531
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,400
Your Highness,

532
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,600
the timing of the food and water

533
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,400
is too coincidental and strange.

534
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,400
I'll go back to Jialan

535
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,400
to reinforce the border guard.

536
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,400
Be careful.

537
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,400
Cousin,

538
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,400
I owe you a sincere apology.

539
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,400
If there's a place

540
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,400
that can be useful

541
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,400
to me and Jingang,

542
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,400
we'll do whatever it takes

543
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,400
to help you.

544
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,400
Thank you.

545
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,400
Cousin,

546
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,400
I'll do as you said.

547
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,400
You have to take care of yourself

548
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,400
and recover soon.

549
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,400
City, Jinyan,

550
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,400
Xuanlu,

551
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,400
and Qingang,

552
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,400
we'll meet again.

553
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,400
Don't be so sad.

554
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,400
You two

555
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,400
should go for a walk.

556
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,400
Dasi has been lonely for most of her life.

557
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,400
I'll stay with her.

558
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,400
Linglong.

559
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,400
I'll be back tomorrow.

560
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,400
conditions were good.

561
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,000
которую

562
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,400
Good peppercorn.

563
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,400
Don't open it.

564
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,400
If you shouldn't eat it,

565
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,400
Bring it here

566
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,400
and smell it.

567
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,400
Ok.

568
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,400
Old Man來了。

569
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:25,280
Why would I like to see you more carefully now?

570
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,440
Quite surprising.

571
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,960
I just want to be around you.

572
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,840
My fine brother,

573
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,280
you are an capricious woman.

574
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:45,000
Snap out of it or I will cut off the ears of you two.

575
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,600
I'll look for you for the rest of my life.

576
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,800
and your grief.

577
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,520
Yu Lang,

578
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,120
let's come another day.

579
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,000
If someone finds out

580
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:04,920
that we're secretly

581
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,960
entering Qingjiang Lake,

582
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,320
they'll be afraid that we...

583
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,400
Father,

584
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,680
I'm guilty.

585
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,600
I shouldn't have burned my mother to death.

586
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,600
Your Highness,

587
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,720
Please get up.

588
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:26,760
Why didn't you

589
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,080
mutual Blbing away

590
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,920
from what Bai Feng Lin was doing?

591
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,400
Ninth Eldestellkeeping Mountain experienced THIS drumming.

592
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,360
His Highness is absolutely physically disabled.

593
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,280
I am afraid he's crystal-beld

594
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,760
by the mysterious bling of Rings of Fire.

595
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,160
We shouldn't

596
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,120
add any more weight to his examination.

597
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:45,520
That's true.

598
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:46,320
Since the

599
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,160
evolraszam of these scholars

600
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:48,960
has Ontario already taken to treatment,

601
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,480
when the lord of the SPirits is taking the lead,

602
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,220
Will you 씨가e Blknow the sin on Bai Feng Lin directly

603
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,240
Please watch Yigu Yao.
