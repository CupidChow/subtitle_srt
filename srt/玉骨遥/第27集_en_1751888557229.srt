1
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,600
I invite you to watch Yu Gu Yao.

2
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,080
Now,

3
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,680
I'm afraid that all the Western Sea Army

4
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,880
is looking for Master.

5
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,040
And you've lost your magic power.

6
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,680
What if you meet them?

7
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,040
Protect me with my life.

8
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,040
Master, be careful.

9
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:24,920
Ding Er.

10
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,600
Master.

11
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,440
Leave me alone.

12
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,640
Master, go.

13
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,080
Go.

14
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,000
Master, go.

15
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,560
Master.

16
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,640
Be careful.

17
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,280
Go.

18
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,600
Let me go.

19
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,480
Master.

20
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,880
God bless me.

21
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,360
Master.

22
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,080
Song Ke.

23
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,840
You've lost your magic power.

24
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,200
Master.

25
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:14,840
I...

26
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,840
Master, leave me alone.

27
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I advise you

28
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,000
to stop playing the zither.

29
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,760
This net

30
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,520
is the treasure of our clan.

31
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,720
It's made of

32
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,160
the black iron of the sea

33
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,520
that has been under the sea for thousands of years.

34
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,040
The more you try to untie it,

35
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,760
the tighter it will be.

36
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,160
It will make the people of Zhao State more painful.

37
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:32,880
Go.

38
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,480
Master.

39
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,560
Ding Er.

40
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,880
Let me go.

41
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,640
Go.

42
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,360
Yun He.

43
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,000
Go.

44
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,600
Master.

45
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,280
This is...

46
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,240
Where's Zhu Yan?

47
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,120
He was taken away by the Navy.

48
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,120
Those people

49
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,400
used the magic weapon of the merman

50
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,280
to escape by the water.

51
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,440
I'm going to save him.

52
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,240
Master.

53
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,960
Do you want to use the source of the source

54
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,640
to forcefully destroy the evil and restore the magic power?

55
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,880
Never.

56
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,800
The source of the source is the foundation of cultivation.

57
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,840
If you don't use the source of the source

58
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,640
temporarily,

59
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,160
you may be incited to the devil in the future.

60
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,120
Master.

61
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:50,880
Master.

62
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,960
This place is not far from the Heaven's City.

63
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,520
Why don't we ask Lord Chi for help?

64
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,640
You can't help me at all.

65
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,240
But...

66
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,080
The source of the source is the foundation of cultivation.

67
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,680
The source of the source is the foundation of cultivation.

68
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,120
The source of the source is the foundation of cultivation.

69
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,720
The source of the source is the foundation of cultivation.

70
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,280
The source of the source is the foundation of cultivation.

71
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,880
The source of the source is the foundation of cultivation.

72
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,560
The source of the source is the foundation of cultivation.

73
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,120
The source of the source is the foundation of cultivation.

74
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,680
The source of the source is the foundation of cultivation.

75
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,120
The source of the source is the foundation of cultivation.

76
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,640
The source of the source is the foundation of cultivation.

77
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,120
The source of the source is the foundation of cultivation.

78
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,680
The source of the source is the foundation of cultivation.

79
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,160
The source of the source is the foundation of cultivation.

80
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,600
The source of the source is the foundation of cultivation.

81
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,160
The source of the source is the foundation of cultivation.

82
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,760
The source of the source is the foundation of cultivation.

83
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,720
I'm not

84
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:57,140
the зновжส難 tournament's

85
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,140
You wasted your energy and energy

86
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,140
to get me this woman.

87
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,140
What use is that?

88
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,140
Elder, calm down.

89
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,140
This woman is not a common person.

90
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,140
She is a disciple of Turong Ke,

91
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,140
a princess of Chizu.

92
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,140
Elder.

93
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,140
You, the pirates of the Sea Kingdom,

94
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,140
don't want to use me

95
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,140
to threaten my father.

96
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,140
Elder!

97
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,140
Dragon Blood Ancient Jade?

98
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,140
It's Dragon Blood Ancient Jade!

99
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,140
If you wear it, you can't kill the Jiao Clan.

100
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,140
The Dragon Blood Ancient Jade is my treasure.

101
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,140
It's very precious.

102
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,140
How could it be in the hands of a empty-handed person?

103
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,140
How did you get it?

104
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,140
I know.

105
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:19,140
That person has been living in Chibang Prefecture all these years.

106
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,140
I'm sure that he gave you the ancient jade.

107
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,140
Since you are so important to him,

108
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,140
I'll borrow you to use it.

109
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,140
Who is this person?

110
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,140
What do you want?

111
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,140
Tell them to

112
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,140
keep an eye on him.

113
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,140
Yes.

114
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:58,020
The

115
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,020
Why is my liver getting stronger?

116
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,020
Could it be

117
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,020
that the Sea Emperor is nearby?

118
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,020
This is a dream.

119
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,020
Could it be that Yan'er has something to do with the Sea Emperor?

120
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,020
Let's go.

121
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,020
Let's go.

122
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,020
Let's go.

123
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,020
Isn't that Yu Ji and Su Mo?

124
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,020
Why did they become like this?

125
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:45,020
Could it be that one of them is the Sea Emperor?

126
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:50,020
Could it be that the child in my dream is Su Mo?

127
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,020
Officer Zhi.

128
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,020
It's really Officer Zhi.

129
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,020
The Sea Emperor should be that child.

130
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,020
Officer,

131
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,020
Elder Jian asked me to come and greet you.

132
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,020
I won't say it again.

133
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,020
You misunderstood.

134
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,020
Elder Jian means

135
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,020
to ask me if I want to meet the princess of the Shi Clan.

136
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,020
What did you say?

137
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,020
You tables and chairs

138
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,020
are 10 years old.

139
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,020
It's nothing.

140
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,020
Will you outline the order for the sent-off?

141
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,020
Do you want to make it an official announcement?

142
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,020
HQ already decided on the person who will listen to your nagging,

143
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,020
and the point of the matter.

144
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,020
The chiefierte singer,

145
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:46,020

Dare to do it?

149
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,980
I'm afraid he doesn't want his good disciple's life.

150
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,300
This is...

151
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:55,660
This...

152
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:14,540
Stop!

153
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,420
T sleep!

154
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,580
Why is my son alive?

155
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,260
My name is Huo Lian YiOf YuwenLähes

156
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,700
Your beauty里

00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,380
Please come again.

158
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:34,020
My body get beaten as soon as I entered the swallowing hole.

159
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,260
Did you never know that theностью of the 14 committee was Bangladeshi?

160
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:48,420
She is a man who

161
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:56,860
DR murders

162
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:12,820
Where is he?

163
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,660
to make a great contribution to the country.

164
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,220
Kill them!

165
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,220

Kill them!

168
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,220
Tong Long Ke.

169
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,220
I'm afraid

170
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,500
you can't save him anymore.

171
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,260
Good.

172
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,140
You asked for it.

173
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:43,940
Wait a minute.

174
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:10,860
It's you?

175
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,460
It's you.

176
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,020
You want him here?

177
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,020
Give him to me.

178
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,140
Master.

179
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,580
God is so cruel.

180
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,900
He even fought with Kong San.

181
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,340
Now,

182
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,140
how can I

183
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,620
help Yan'er?

184
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,460
I can't just let him be in the same situation.

185
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:41,420
Then,

186
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,020
protect him.

187
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,460
You know him?

188
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,580
I know him longer than you do.

189
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,260
You...

190
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:55,620
Master.

191
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,100
He can't go anywhere

192
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,500
just for a sword stroke.

193
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,820
But you intended to kill him

194
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,980
just now because he is hit by his d tam.

195
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,620
He hasn't beenTHATED nie your life yet.

196
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,780
He's your pet as a noun,

197
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,500
you think just because the end of the words

198
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,500
If I hadn't stopped you,

199
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,540
you wouldn't have known the pain

200
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,860
when you came here.

201
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:46,560
The

202
00:14:46,560 --> 00:15:07,420
Autumn

203
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:07,980
Autumn

204
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:08,460
Where is this place?

205
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,480
Yan'er, you're awake.

206
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,140
Yan'er.

207
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:12,940
Yan'er.

208
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,100
Master,

209
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,860
you saved me.

210
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,740
Yan'er, are you all right?

211
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:22,820
I'm fine.

212
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,420
Master,

213
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,300
how come your power

214
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,700
has recovered so quickly?

215
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,180
Did you use the True Soul?

216
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,340
How could I be so stupid

217
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,300
to use the True Soul for you?

218
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,820
I just took some fruit.

219
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,900
Shiyi vomited blood just now.

220
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,980
It was clearly the True Soul.

221
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,140
But she didn't want Yan'er to know

222
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,780
that Shiyi was really good to Yan'er.

223
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,020
Yan'er only cares about her.

224
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,340
I came too late in this matter.

225
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,820
I didn't save you just now.

226
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:01,700
It was her.

227
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,340
She said she knew you.

228
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,060
Yuan.

229
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:09,860
Come.

230
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,620
You're here too.

231
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,020
You and Young Master are fighting against each other.

232
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,780
You must have a lot to say.

233
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,300
It's all right.

234
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,180
Master,

235
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,300
this is the one I mentioned to you before.

236
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,580
Chief Steward Yuan.

237
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,260
Yuan, thank you.

238
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,580
So,

239
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,620
you're Chief Steward Yuan

240
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,100
that Yan'er often mentions.

241
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,260
Yan'er often mentioned you to me too.

242
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,460
Young Master is powerful and has no double power.

243
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,220
Why did you make him take the risk today?

244
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,940
The Imperial Army is cunning and dangerous.

245
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,740
But I didn't expect

246
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,460
that the Chief Steward of the Chifu

247
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,700
is the leader of the Imperial Army.

248
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,660
Those people just now called you a great man.

249
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,300
Master,

250
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,420
it's like this.

251
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,100
Yuan...

252
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,460
I was expelled from the Chifu long ago.

253
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,980
I've been separated from the old friends.

254
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,020
What I did

255
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,580
has nothing to do with the Chis.

256
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,340
But

257
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:16,140
you're important in the Imperial Army.

258
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,940
Those people killed Wu Weisui

259
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,700
and took Yan'er away from the prison.

260
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,100
The Han people

261
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,940
are making a scene in the west.

262
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,420
Do you really

263
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,460
know all these?

264
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,380
Master,

265
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,940
there are seven people

266
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,060
who do these things.

267
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,300
They're Elder Jian.

268
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,460
I even heard it myself.

269
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,340
He's trying to threaten Yuan with me.

270
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:39,820
Yuan

271
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,620
has just returned to the Imperial Army.

272
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,900
He's trying to find his own sister.

273
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,020
He's definitely not with them.

274
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,900
You're brave and ambitious.

275
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,540
You're very loyal.

276
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,940
You're different from the usual Imperial Army.

277
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,820
But why

278
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,020
did you and I fight on the battlefield

279
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,900
and know the situation that day

280
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,660
and that someone in the Imperial Army

281
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,460
would make fun of me?

282
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:10,740
And

283
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,820
your sister is also a member of the Imperial Army.

284
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,780
Your family has a long history with the Imperial Army.

285
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,980
So why have you been

286
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,780
in the Chifu all these years?

287
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,580
The Imperial Army is familiar with the road

288
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,180
and is very close to Tianji and Fengcheng.

289
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,260
Why are they so familiar with the terrain?

290
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,100
It's the Chizu's army.

291
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,660
My father's army is coming soon.

292
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,380
I have to go.

293
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,140
I'll explain to you

294
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,740
the answer you want later.

295
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:41,780
Wait.

296
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,260
If you really have no qualms,

297
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,220
you can lead the Imperial Army to surrender

298
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,900
and go back to Tianji and Fengcheng with us

299
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,140
to explain everything.

300
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,020
I will withdraw from Tianji and Fengcheng

301
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,500
and promise not to rebel again.

302
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,740
The Imperial Army is in chaos now.

303
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,300
I can't risk it and return to the mountain.

304
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,460
The Imperial Army's army

305
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,900
will be killed by the ambush.

306
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,100
You know the soldiers down there

307
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,380
are just following orders.

308
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,700
If you want them to die,

309
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,940
you would have done it earlier.

310
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:07,740
Right?

311
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,380
If they resist,

312
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,060
they will only die more.

313
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,180
Shao Siming,

314
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,860
I know you are not a man of iron heart.

315
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,260
If you don't want to see

316
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,580
the blood flowing in the river,

317
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,260
let us go.

318
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:21,660
Master,

319
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,340
I know you are worried.

320
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,980
But I believe in Yuan.

321
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,860
He will never betray his faith.

322
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,380
Yuan,

323
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,500
when the time comes,

324
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,540
you will give us an explanation.

325
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,260
Don't keep us waiting.

326
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,460
Okay?

327
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,660
I will never let Yan down.

328
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:45,820
Okay.

329
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,220
You can go.

330
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,940
But don't forget

331
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,500
you owe us a real explanation.

332
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,340
I have one more thing to do.

333
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,340
Master,

334
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,420
I will go.

335
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,180
Shao Siming,

336
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,340
I will leave Yan to you.

337
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,060
But what happened today

338
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,060
will never happen again.

339
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,580
How can you

340
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,300
leave Yan to me?

341
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,660
Yan is my disciple.

342
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,300
I will not let him be in danger.

343
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,180
You just need to remember what you promised.

344
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,300
I will protect Yan

345
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,260
and let him be in danger again.

346
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,900
I will protect him.

347
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,420
Master,

348
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,020
you also believe in Yuan, right?

349
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:52,620
Otherwise,

350
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,820
no matter how much I say,

351
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,460
you will not let him go.

352
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:58,940
Master,

353
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,540
Yuan is the leader of the Navy.

354
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,380
Can you not tell me

355
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,980
about the others?

356
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,500
You are very considerate of him.

357
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,220
You are so happy

358
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,100
when you saw me let him go?

359
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,860
Of course not.

360
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,820
I am happy

361
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,020
because

362
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,300
you are willing to believe

363
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,580
the people I believe.

364
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:44,700
Hurry up!

365
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,500
Go over there!

366
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,100
Yan!

367
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:47,620
Yes!

368
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,100
Go over there!

369
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:48,620
Yan!

370
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,140
Yes!

371
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:49,660
Yan!

372
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,140
Yan!

373
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:50,620
Yan!

374
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,140
Yan!

375
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:51,660
Yan!

376
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,220
Yan!

377
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:52,780
Yan!

378
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,300
Yan!

379
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:53,780
Yan!

380
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,380
Yan!

381
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,060
Yan!

382
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:55,580
Yan!

383
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,100
Yan!

384
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:56,580
Yan!

385
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,100
Yan!

386
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:57,620
Yan!

387
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,100
Yan!

388
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:58,620
Yes!

389
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,420
Yan!

390
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,380
Yan!

391
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,140
Father!

392
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,340
Yan!

393
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,020
Father!

394
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:05,820
I am here to protect you!

395
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,620
Yes!

396
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:07,420
Father!

397
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,540
Yan, you...

398
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:10,980
Are you okay?

399
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,380
I am fine.

400
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,380
That's good.

401
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,220
Yan!

402
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:28,820
Yan!

403
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:29,500
Yan!

404
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,220
Yan!

405
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:30,940
Yan!

406
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,660
Yan!

407
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,460
Yan!

408
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,340
Yan!

409
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,540
Yan!

410
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,420
Yan!

411
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,220
Yan!

412
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,220
Yan!

413
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,220
Yan!

414
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,020
Yan!

415
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:39,860
Yan!

416
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:40,540
Yan!

417
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,540
Yan!

418
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,460
Yan!

419
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,060
Yan!

420
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:43,900
You are all dead!

421
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,020
Yan!

422
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:45,820
Stop!

423
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:46,820
The army of the Star Valley is here.

424
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,700
Everyone retreat!

425
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,580
We are all dead!

426
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,380
You are all dead!

427
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,020
Yan!

428
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,700
What are you doing?

429
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,420
You'd rather die

430
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,820
than to be buried.

431
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,700
Today's battle

432
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,100
will be recorded

433
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,780
in the history of the Sea Kingdom.

434
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,700
We will fight until the end!

435
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,020
We will not retreat until we die!

436
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,340
We will fight until the end!

437
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,620
We will not retreat until we die!

438
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,940
We will not retreat until we die!

439
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,220
We will not retreat until we die!

440
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,700
You escaped from the Star Valley.

441
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,020
You are not the only one

442
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,460
who knows how to solve the Star Valley.

443
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,900
Ru Yi.

444
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:37,460
Go!

445
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,300
That's strange.

446
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,340
Hurry up!

447
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,500
The Sea Kingdom Army

448
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,500
has always fought with their lives.

449
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,860
They will never give up until they die.

450
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,340
This time, they are willing to withdraw their troops.

451
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,740
Hurry up!

452
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,420
Hurry up!

453
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,220
Hurry up!

454
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:53,820
Hurry up!

455
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,620
Hurry up!

456
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,340
Hurry up!

457
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,180
Hurry up!

458
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,180
Young Commander.

459
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,420
Have you seen their leader?

460
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,100
I just rescued Yan.

461
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,460
The army arrived.

462
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,580
So I haven't seen the leader.

463
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,540
Yan.

464
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,180
You suffered.

465
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,540
Young Commander.

466
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,060
It's all because of you

467
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,260
who have been protecting Zhao.

468
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,700
Only by doing this

469
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,900
can I escape from the Huotu Tribe

470
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,180
and the Sea Kingdom Army.

471
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,020
Young Master.

472
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,620
You have been so kind to me.

473
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:31,180
I will always remember it.

474
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,540
I am a god.

475
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:35,860
But I have been

476
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,980
interfering with the West Wilderness.

477
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,780
I am in a bad situation.

478
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,300
You don't have to thank me.

479
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,180
Since Yan is safe now,

480
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,860
I should get up.

481
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,380
Your Highness.

482
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,460
You touched Zhenyuan.

483
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:18,860
Shouldn't you rest more?

484
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:20,980
It's okay.

485
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:22,380
By the way,

486
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:23,980
the last time you blamed me

487
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,260
why you let him go?

488
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:27,660
It's the first time.

489
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,260
We don't know who he is.

490
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,820
But now

491
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,780
we know who he is.

492
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,260
We'll go to Jialan Pagoda to confirm it.

493
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,780
If he's really Haihuang,

494
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,580
we'll meet again soon.

495
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:45,660
If he's the way I think he is,

496
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,820
then Haihuang is

497
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,580
a lucky man

498
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,580
for Kong Sang.

499
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,140
I never thought

500
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,740
he's the one

501
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,340
that Zhu Yan always mentions,

502
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,460
but he looks young.

503
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,580
He's about your age.

504
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:04,820
Shi Ying,

505
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,340
if you don't be careful,

506
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,620
Yan might be abducted.

507
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,540
China

508
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,020
You younger idiots

509
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,900
are called military districts of Wei.

510
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,260
We failed to kill

511
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:48,340
theAPCachine

512
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,380
in the same ran.

513
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,340
you played bills

514
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,340
at last.

515
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:51,940
Did youも

516
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,900
to save his disciple.

517
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,380
Now, in order to save his disciple,

518
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,300
he has turned the army of the Haikou

519
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,940
into a flat land.

520
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,660
Everyone is in danger.

521
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,420
So today,

522
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,220
we should all focus on one thing.

523
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,060
The one who should make the contribution

524
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,060
and the one who should attack

525
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,180
are all crazy.

526
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,340
Ru Yi,

527
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,340
do you know that?

528
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,220
Although I don't know

529
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,620
all of Elder's plans,

530
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,060
you left us

531
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,660
and led us

532
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,380
for two hundred years.

533
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,940
Compared to you,

534
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,580
we are more willing

535
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,900
to believe in his plans.

536
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:34,820
When did you become

537
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,940
so indiscriminate?

538
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,660
We haven't seen each other for more than two hundred years.

539
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,460
Are you going to

540
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,700
blame me now?

541
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,100
When you left us,

542
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,020
I was caught by the empty-sand man

543
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:48,980
and tortured.

544
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,260
Elder Jian saved me.

545
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,980
You were completely unnoticed in the past two hundred years.

546
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:53,940
Elder Jian gave me

547
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,380
a new identity and mission.

548
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,140
Speaking of this,

549
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,860
the time I spent with Elder Jian

550
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,060
is much longer than

551
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,020
the time I spent with you.

552
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,260
I don't know you are still alive.

553
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,740
When you know I am still alive,

554
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,460
you chose to stay

555
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,140
with that Princess Hongsao, right?

556
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,580
You are discerning.

557
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,540
Have some tea.

558
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:58,900
The ship

559
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,340
is leaving in seven days.

560
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,780
After seven days,

561
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:08,500
the

562
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,820
ship will appear

563
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:10,740
at this point.

564
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,460
If Rougan Jiaoan

565
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,660
appears at the same time,

566
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,460
how are we going to

567
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,940
determine which is the ship?

568
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,540
when the real body of the Sea Emperor was pointed out?

569
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,540
I didn't know where the Sea Emperor was.

570
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,540
But the Heaven Realm took advantage of me

571
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,660
to guide the world.

572
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,300
And there was only one chance.

573
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,500
If I missed it,

574
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,540
I couldn't push it anymore.

575
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,780
Since it's the real body pointed out this time,

576
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,180
there must be some strange signs.

577
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:42,100
The blood of the turtle was empty at that time.

578
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,900
The dragon's tail was in danger.

579
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,460
I see.

580
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,980
The one with the dragon's tail is the Sea Emperor.

581
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,780
When you left this place,

582
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,860
you were a young man in Wei Ji Guan.

583
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,500
After many years, you returned to your hometown.

584
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,780
You must have had some feelings.

585
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,220
Xiao Ying Zi,

586
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,540
do you remember the life here?

587
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,140
Since my mother passed away,

588
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:28,460
I have no more feelings for this place.

589
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,420
Jialan doesn't belong to me.

590
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:34,060
And I don't belong to Jialan.

591
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:37,820
Let's go.

592
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:45,940
Ruyi,

593
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,340
how have you been these years?

594
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,220
Where is the man you gave him the painting?

595
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,100
He's dead.

596
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:04,540
And you?

597
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,220
Is that Princess Chi Zuo

598
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,940
who was captured by the sword master?

599
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,020
It's not her.

600
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,300
Then why are you willing to die for her?

601
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:20,020
Do you know that Jiao Ren can only love one person in his life?

602
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,580
The man who once lived with me

603
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,180
died 200 years ago.

604
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,740
I'm the same as you.

605
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,260
No.

606
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,980
You fell in love with a empty-sacred man.

607
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,060
But the man I fell in love with

608
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,860
died in the hands of an empty-sacred man.

609
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,660
I'm not the same as you.

610
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,260
You fell in love with a empty-sacred man.

611
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:45,780
You were the steward

612
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,500
of an empty-sacred man for more than 200 years.

613
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,980
But these days,

614
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,540
I've been waiting for the King of the Sea to come back

615
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,980
to avenge them.

616
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:57,980
Ruyi,

617
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,740
you're in such a hurry to go to Ye City.

618
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,500
Do you have any task?

619
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,540
All these years,

620
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,780
I've been doing things that are not for me.

621
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,420
I don't have to tell Mr. Zuo Quan Shi everything, do I?

622
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,980
Of course, if you have nothing else to do,

623
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,100
please go back.

624
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,900
I'm deeply grieved

625
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,020
and I'm in a hurry to go to the army.

626
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,620
I didn't take good care of you.

627
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:33,420
Zhiyuan.

628
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:34,860
Zhibing.

629
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,820
Your names

630
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,060
are written on the paper.

631
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:41,460
I'm deeply grieved and I'm in a hurry to go to the army.

632
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,900
This is the current situation

633
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,140
of our Jiao people.

634
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,100
I hope that after you grow up,

635
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,220
you can take on my important task

636
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,100
and make the Jiao clan a better country.

637
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,940
Do you understand?

638
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,580
Yes, Father.

639
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,380
Yes, Father.

640
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,100
I don't like to be a ship.

641
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,660
I don't like to be his son.

642
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:23,340
I don't want to be called Zhibing.

643
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,780
What name do you want to be called?

644
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,700
I'll be called Ruyi.

645
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,900
Ruyi is the most powerful name.

646
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,620
Okay, I promise you.

647
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,740
I'll protect you from now on.

648
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,860
I'll call you that when you're gone.

649
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:45,340
But don't let Father hear it.

650
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:46,660
Ruyi, Ruyi.

651
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,260
You're much better than Zhibing.

652
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,420
Thank you, Brother.

653
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,940
When you grow up,

654
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,980
you'll be the most beautiful Jiao people in the world.

655
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:54,980
Don't cry.

656
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,140
My sister

657
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,540
has finally grown up to be the most beautiful person in the world.

658
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:03,740
I'm sorry.

659
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,940
I know that no matter how many times I explain it,

660
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,540
I can't make up for my guilt towards you.

661
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:11,940
I'm sorry.

662
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,580
I've said it.

663
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,260
Don't mention the past.

664
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,100
Have you taken the initiative?

665
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,900
You never liked to fight in the past.

666
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,900
I fought for the country.

667
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:33,140
For the people of the thousand tribes,

668
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:36,300
it's nothing to take the pain of this life.

669
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,900
You were deceived by Elder Jian.

670
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,620
War is not the only way to restore the country.

671
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,460
Jiuyi Mountain and Shao Simin

672
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,060
are not like what they said.

673
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:47,300
Those Jiao people

674
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,140
were turned into puppets by Great Shaman that day.

675
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,260
They wanted to kill me.

676
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,380
Shao Simin did it to save me.

677
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:58,620
I know that the Haiguo Army has its own problems.

678
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,060
But compared to the Kongsang people,

679
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,820
I'm more willing to believe in my own compatriots.

680
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,500
I'm not asking you to betray your own compatriots.

681
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,620
We Jiao people will have

682
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,940
our own future.

683
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,700
The hope is with the King of the Sea.

684
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,420
If fewer people die,

685
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,940
we can restore the country.

686
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,020
What will you choose?

687
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,100
You said that

688
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,500
because you already have a plan.

689
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,860
Do you remember Ning Xue Zhu?

690
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,060
If the King of the Sea enters the Night City,

691
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,580
it will be more difficult to find him.

692
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,260
We must find him

693
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,740
before he enters the Night City.

694
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,220
What's the use of it, Lord Zhi?

695
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,700
The King of the Sea is here.

696
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,660
I'm here to find him.

697
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,780
There is a small city here.

698
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,500
People who enter the Night City will stay here.

699
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,340
We enter the city

700
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,540
and take these Ning Xue Zhu to search the city separately.

701
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,060
If Ning Xue Zhu sheds blue light,

702
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,940
it means that he has reached the King of the Sea.

703
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,540
When you pass the message to me,

704
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,780
I'll go to confirm it.

705
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,620
Do you remember Ning Xue Zhu?

706
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:35,020
My blood can feel the power of the King of the Sea.

707
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,740
I support Ning Xue Zhu.

708
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,580
I'll send Ning Xue Zhu

709
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:41,060
to the sword master and his subordinates

710
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,740
to help them find the King of the Sea.

711
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,140
But I must feel the King of the Sea first.

712
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,580
After I find the King of the Sea alone,

713
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,740
I'll inform you.

714
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,420
Then we can make a decision together.

715
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,380
Okay?

716
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:01,860
That's right.

717
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,460
This is what my father told me when I was a child.

718
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:07,300
It's also a special place for a man's blood.

719
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,620
Then, as you said,

720
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:13,380
I'll leave the matter of finding the King of the Sea to you.

721
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,620
The King of the Sea only

722
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,180
wants to find the King of the Sea

723
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,700
and not to make trouble.

724
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,060
Yes.

725
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,020
I still have some food here.

726
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,740
Let's give it to the child first.

727
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,220
Thank you.

728
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,180
This stone is too hard.

729
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,300
These people are all the King of the Sea.

730
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,540
Take them down!

731
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:03,980
What are you doing?

732
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,460
What are you doing?

733
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,220
I said yes.

734
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:10,020
All the people who are the King of the Sea are the King of the Sea.

735
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,860
One person will be rewarded with two stones.

736
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:14,620
Kill them!

737
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,260
Yes!

738
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,100
Take down their Ningbi Pearl.

739
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,180
Didn't Lord Zi order

740
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,580
that the Sword Elder

741
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,300
was trying to seduce him to find the King of the Sea?

742
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,220
He's busy looking for the King of the Sea.

743
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,420
How would he know what happened here?

744
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,340
Hurry up and do it!

745
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:29,740
I'm sorry.

746
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,420
I'm sorry.

747
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,380
I'm sorry.

748
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,340
No.

749
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,220
The Ningbi Pearl is gone.

750
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:58,620
Luckily, there's a little rabbit.

751
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,460
No!

752
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,740
The King of the Sea has appeared.

753
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:22,020
But where did this lowly trick come from?

754
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,260
Could it be

755
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,980
that the King of the Sea is in danger?

756
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,420
Dragon kiss!

757
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,260
Only the King of the Sea has dragon kiss!

758
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,220
The King of the Sea?

759
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:42,660
Could it be the King of the Sea?

760
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,020
We have to take the King of the Sea back

761
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,020
and let him witness it.

762
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:45,980
Don't run!

763
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,100
Don't run!

764
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,540
Stop!

765
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,380
Don't run!

766
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,620
Help, King of the Sea!

767
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:53,700
Help!

768
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:55,580
Don't run!

769
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,780
You're going to die.

770
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,700
I hate you all.

771
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:10,900
Why are you running?

772
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:36,020
Jing rim

773
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,700
The wizard Mater able to understand

774
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:57,940
unexpected

775
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:59,220
Xiaoyu.

776
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:02,900
Xiaoyu.

777
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,940
Let's see where you're going.

778
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:22,260
API

779
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:00,900
This is the

780
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,900
True God of Sea, Yuyuko.

781
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:04,900
It seems that the True God of Sea has been identified.

782
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:06,900
It's in the south.

783
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,900
There is only one demon in front of us.

784
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:32,500
How can we meet?

785
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:37,500
How can we be apart?

786
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:42,500
How can the flowers and snow be so beautiful?

787
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:47,500
Love and hate are not clear.

788
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:52,500
How can the rain become dust?

789
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:57,060
How can the clouds disappear?

790
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:02,060
How can the shadow of the cloud break and disappear?

791
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:06,060
Yuyuko is beautiful, tears are burning.

792
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:12,060
The bottom line at the end of your heart

793
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:17,060
is the soul that Yufeng dares to make.

794
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:21,620
Lock the heart in my hand

795
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:26,620
and ignore you.

796
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:31,620
The bottom line at the end of your heart

797
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:36,620
is the soul that Yufeng dares to make.

798
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:41,620
How can the heart be broken?

799
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:46,620
We are just like a couple.

800
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:51,620
The bottom line at the end of your heart

801
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:56,620
is the soul that Yufeng dares to make.

802
00:45:57,620 --> 00:46:01,620
Lock the heart in my hand

803
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:06,620
and ignore you.

804
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:11,620
The bottom line at the end of your heart

805
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:16,620
is the soul that Yufeng dares to make.

806
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:21,620
The bottom line at the end of your heart

807
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:26,620
is the soul that Yufeng dares to make.

808
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:31,620
How can we meet?

809
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:36,620
How can we be apart?
