1
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,280
to watch the moment of love.

2
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,040
Why would I bother you?

3
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,640
Your Highness.

4
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,640
Have you seen Uncle Feng?

5
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,480
Master,

6
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,480
you asked me to go down the mountain

7
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,960
because you knew my parents would pick me up.

8
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,160
You didn't want me to be in the middle

9
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,120
and make things difficult for you,

10
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,640
right?

11
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,040
I left home for two years and failed to go to school.

12
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,120
If my parents

13
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,560
came to pick me up,

14
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,680
I would still stay

15
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,720
and be a teacher.

16
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,040
I've made up my mind.

17
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,920
I don't want to cause any trouble for you.

18
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,000
I'll go down the mountain

19
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,800
with my parents tomorrow.

20
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,160
Master,

21
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,440
I know

22
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,640
your identity will be exposed

23
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,560
and it will attract Uncle Xuanran.

24
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,840
That's what my parents

25
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,400
wanted.

26
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,040
But

27
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,400
you must take good care of yourself.

28
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,480
No matter where I am,

29
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,360
I'll always

30
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,520
be with you.

31
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,640
I know.

32
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,600
You should go.

33
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,160
Master,

34
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,880
when can I come back?

35
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,120
Master,

36
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,540
you're a determined man.

37
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,620
Master is determined

38
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,020
to not go back to the Red City

39
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,020
to care about the secular affairs.

40
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,100
But

41
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,900
I believe this storm

42
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,380
will pass soon.

43
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,140
Then I can come back,

44
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,220
right?

45
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,860
Actually, there are many ways.

46
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:18,700
For example,

47
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,620
I will have a headache.

48
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,820
Master just needs to answer

49
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,020
this spell

50
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,580
to take the spirit grass

51
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,900
from Mount Jiuyi for a long time.

52
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,020
Then you can call me back.

53
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:31,740
Or

54
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,700
Master can come to Tianji City to find me.

55
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,460
Then I can take Master

56
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,100
to ride horses,

57
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:36,820
ride sand,

58
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:37,620
ride camels.

59
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,580
We can also eat

60
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,700
roasted lamb skewers together.

61
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,980
If I miss Master,

62
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,820
I will have a hangover.

63
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,620
Master taught me the art of calligraphy.

64
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,020
I will also practice hard.

65
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,940
providing for each other and

66
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,820
this is the censer.

67
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,340
The ancient weapon that the Empress passed down

68
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,500
is also your first gift.

69
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,540
Master.

70
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,460
You must remember

71
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,860
to come to Tianji Peak to find me.

72
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,500
You must come.

73
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,700
You must come to see me.

74
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,100
You must come.

75
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,460
I will miss you.

76
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,900
You really let him go?

77
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,740
How cruel.

78
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,100
You know my situation.

79
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,140
If I let him stay,

80
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,100
it will be more dangerous.

81
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,500
But you have already given him the jade bone.

82
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,660
That is the token of love

83
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,340
that the Emperor of the Star King gave to Bai Wei.

84
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,140
It is also the gift that the Emperor of the Empty Sang Empire

85
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,580
gave to the Empress.

86
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,140
Shi Ying,

87
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,340
you clearly can't let him go.

88
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,100
Why did you...

89
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,100
Anyway, in this life,

90
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,980
I will be the Emperor's wife.

91
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,980
I will not give this to other women.

92
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,260
Let him be Yan'er's wife.

93
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,780
Thank you, Minister Da,

94
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,580
for taking care of my daughter these years.

95
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,340
Minister Da, we will take our leave.

96
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,260
Wait.

97
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,580
Tell in the capital city,

98
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:38,720
for

99
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,680
Your Majesty.

100
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,440
I've eliminated Yu Du.

101
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,080
There's no major harm.

102
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,640
Thank you for your advice.

103
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,720
I hope we'll see each other soon.

104
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,800
Let's go

105
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:51,060
昔制

106
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,200
I should talk to you about

107
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,400
If the king and concubines can not reconcile

108
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,140
Then we may

109
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,900
will hurt the people around you.

110
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,100
If you don't plan ahead,

111
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,420
Zhu Yan and the Chizhi Clan

112
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,260
will be implicated because of you.

113
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,380
Come on. Look at this.

114
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,420
Shake it.

115
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:37,780
Come on.

116
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,380
I just said it.

117
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,020
You should be more careful.

118
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,100
I'll leave it to you.

119
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,140
Don't worry.

120
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,300
Yan.

121
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,380
Yan.

122
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,540
I've been looking for you since I came back.

123
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,220
You've been gone.

124
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,180
So you're hiding here.

125
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,420
I thought you went somewhere.

126
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,820
Now it's not easy

127
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,740
to meet Mr. Yuan.

128
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:16,740
I didn't know that

129
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,380
you thought you were hiding from me.

130
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,820
You're kidding.

131
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,380
You were recovering.

132
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,300
I was afraid that you would be disturbed.

133
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,020
Actually,

134
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,940
I have to thank you.

135
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,660
Yan, do you know that

136
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,500
my master and I

137
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,780
met Dragon God in the Abyss of Cangwu.

138
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,940
Thanks to the jade that you gave me,

139
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,100
Dragon God didn't hurt me.

140
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,660
Yan, do you know why?

141
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,700
What did Dragon God say to you?

142
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,420
I don't know

143
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,180
what he meant.

144
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,580
But he said

145
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,180
the one he was waiting for was not me.

146
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,860
He also said

147
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,420
the sacred thing of the Jiao Clan

148
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,100
protected me, the empty-sum person.

149
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,180
Yan, you're a Jiao person.

150
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,580
Do you know what he meant?

151
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,580
Dragon God has woken up.

152
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,180
It seems that the day is not far away.

153
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,500
Princess is indeed

154
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,900
the one who is responsible for the dragon blood.

155
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,700
Is there any chance

156
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,340
that she has something to do with the Sea Emperor?

157
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:30,740
Yan,

158
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,180
I'm sorry.

159
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,060
Yan.

160
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:34,860
Yan.

161
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,660
Actually, I don't know

162
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,180
what's wrong with this jade.

163
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,380
But since Dragon God didn't hurt you,

164
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,860
it means that this jade is very useful.

165
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,220
Don't take it off.

166
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,140
By the way, Princess,

167
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,580
I haven't congratulated you yet.

168
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:49,980
You finally get what you want.

169
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,420
What I want?

170
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,380
Are you saying

171
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,820
my master

172
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,940
is the late prince?

173
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,020
In order to save the prince,

174
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,620
I have to learn the art of magic.

175
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,060
God will not let you down.

176
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,660
Although there is no way to return to heaven,

177
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,620
there is a person who can help you.

178
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,740
I'm really happy.

179
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,460
I didn't expect that

180
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,580
the prince I admired since I was a child

181
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,780
is my most admired master.

182
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,580
I've always seen

183
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,220
your affection for the prince since I was a child.

184
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,860
Now the prince has become his master.

185
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,700
It seems that the relationship between you and Shao Siming

186
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,980
has become closer.

187
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,460
But

188
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,740
I have no right to feel sad.

189
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,220
But

190
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,260
it's because of my master's identity

191
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,780
and the reputation of the world,

192
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,780
that I have all kinds of troubles.

193
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,820
My master was worried about my parents' worries,

194
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,980
so he asked me to go down the mountain.

195
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,260
Actually,

196
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,180
I wanted to stay on the mountain

197
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,740
and stay with him

198
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,380
to share his worries.

199
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,460
Princess, you are in danger twice.

200
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,620
You really made the prince and the princess worry.

201
00:12:59,140 --> 00:12:59,860
Fortunately,

202
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,380
Shao Siming is a talented person.

203
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,660
With the help of Shao Siming,

204
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,100
he will overcome the difficulties.

205
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,220
Princess.

206
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:10,780
Please.

207
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:11,500
Please.

208
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,500
Princess.

209
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,940
Master.

210
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:56,260
Innovative portrait,

211
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,740
What do you want to order today?

212
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,940
Just order what I like to eat.

213
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,140
I'll have a roast lamb leg first.

214
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,780
The fatter, the better.

215
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,460
Five jin of beef sauce, please.

216
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,460
I'll order more.

217
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:10,860
By the way,

218
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,860
the wine is the best.

219
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,620
Okay, wait a minute.

220
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:19,860
I forgot to ask you.

221
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,340
You haven't ordered anything yet.

222
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,460
I'll order it later.

223
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,500
I'll order it later.

224
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,580
I'll order it later.

225
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,260
Mr. Wen,

226
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,700
you haven't ordered anything yet.

227
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,140
Enough. Enough.

228
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,340
But

229
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,580
can you finish eating so much?

230
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,860
This is not a big deal.

231
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,700
This is my usual appetizer.

232
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,420
You have a good appetite.

233
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,180
Jin State doesn't allow false eyebrows.

234
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,580
I

235
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,900
admire you.

236
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,420
Mr. Wen,

237
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,820
why don't you eat?

238
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,380
Are you not satisfied with the food I ordered?

239
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,540
My future husband

240
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,580
must want to eat with me.

241
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,180
If there is no consensus on the food,

242
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,460
I'm afraid that

243
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,700
he'll eat the food

244
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:20,780
I cook.

245
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,260
I'm afraid that

246
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,860
he'll eat the food I cook.

247
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,060
I'll have to check later.

248
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,940
I like

249
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,580
дваき料理 your order.

250
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,860
If you like it, eat more.

251
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,740
Let go of her!

252
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,580
What are you doing?

253
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,180
policemen,

254
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,700
you're-

255
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,060
Let go of me!

256
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,860
I'll take you home.

257
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:56,940
Let's go.

258
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,540
Who is it?

259
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,940
Let go of your sword.

260
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,100
Didn't you hear that I said I didn't want to?

261
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,620
I think you're a dog holding a monkey.

262
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,780
It's your fault.

263
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,580
You should be punished.

264
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,460
If you dare to come to Tianji Fengchou Lake again,

265
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,940
your end

266
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,220
will be like this knife.

267
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,740
You'll be killed

268
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,180
wherever you go.

269
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:43,580
Hero.

270
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,540
Hero.

271
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,340
Hero.

272
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,020
Goodbye.

273
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:47,860
Goodbye.

274
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:49,580
Let go of me.

275
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,180
Let go of me.

276
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:50,780
Let go of you.

277
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,380
Get out of here.

278
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,380
Get out of here.

279
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,140
Get out of here.

280
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,460
Miss.

281
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:57,700
Here.

282
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,620
Are you hurt?

283
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,340
Thank you for saving me.

284
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:06,740
Take it.

285
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,140
It's a small deal.

286
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,660
Thank you, miss.

287
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,660
You should forgive others.

288
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,380
That man didn't take advantage of you.

289
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,660
You're a girl.

290
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,060
Why do you have to be so arrogant?

291
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,180
You even said something

292
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,020
in front of so many people.

293
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,380
Something?

294
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:33,860
What happened just now

295
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,660
was just a joke

296
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,780
under the bright sun.

297
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,820
I didn't allow him to tell anyone.

298
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,660
If you can't stand his behavior,

299
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:42,700
you can report it to the police.

300
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,900
Men will handle it.

301
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,100
You don't need to show up

302
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,180
as a woman.

303
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,100
Yes.

304
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,820
If you were a man

305
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,060
and stood up,

306
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,780
I wouldn't have to do it.

307
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,100
Everyone,

308
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,140
right?

309
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,300
Yes.

310
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,820
Yes.

311
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,540
Yes.

312
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,940
Yes.

313
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:01,620
Enough.

314
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,020
I've been patient for a long time.

315
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,100
You're so arrogant.

316
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,700
You were so arrogant

317
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,660
and ungrateful.

318
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,220
You even stood up

319
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,420
as a woman.

320
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,260
Yes.

321
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,140
A woman

322
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,900
should be gentle

323
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,660
and gentle.

324
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,340
I've been practicing martial arts for many years.

325
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,740
I've never thought of standing on anyone's head.

326
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:23,980
But

327
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,820
I have enough courage

328
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,140
to not let people look down on me

329
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,140
and do things to me.

330
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,140
If I meet this again,

331
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,620
I will stand up first.

332
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,540
Well said.

333
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,100
You don't have to endure it.

334
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,340
Well said.

335
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,260
You're so good.

336
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:41,780
You're so good.

337
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,700
You're so good.

338
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,540
You're so good.

339
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,420
Master,

340
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,180
I miss you so much.

341
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:51,020
I saved a poor girl today.

342
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,780
Someone said I was busy.

343
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,020
A woman shouldn't learn martial arts.

344
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,460
I often remember

345
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,500
what you said to me.

346
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,180
A woman

347
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,340
can also protect her country.

348
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,940
If all men

349
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,660
are like you,

350
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,740
there won't be so much

351
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,140
injustice, right?

352
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:40,200
Instant

353
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,420
Zhu Yan has some

354
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,740
rightlaughs and responsible potatoes.

355
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,460
Trust me,

356
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,620
he even has good memory.

357
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,860
Also sent me a red and white occupied flower.

358
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:51,680
Look.

359
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,340
I'm going to try

360
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,620
is not for eating, right?

361
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,700
Where's my prescription?

362
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,100
Is it with you?

363
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,500
Where's the prescription Zhu Yuan gave me?

364
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,580
Is it here?

365
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,340
Where is it?

366
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,140
Master, Master.

367
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,260
We've made a deal.

368
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,780
As long as I reach the top of the tree,

369
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,060
you can teach me the next step.

370
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,020
Don't play tricks on me.

371
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,140
We'll talk when you get there.

372
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,500
What's so hard about that?

373
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,260
Look.

374
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,420
Ah.

375
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,100
How is it?

376
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,340
It's far from the top of the tree.

377
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,940
What's so great about that?

378
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,580
If I can't do it for a day,

379
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:11,980
I can do it for a month.

380
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,780
If I can't do it for a month,

381
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,900
I can do it for a year.

382
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,140
If I can't do it for a year,

383
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,300
I can stay by your side for a lifetime.

384
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,180
Then I can learn everything.

385
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,260
He saved us.

386
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,220
�

387
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:35,660
Di Ren Jie.

388
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,700
PM 1 my oasis.

389
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,260
Have a look at the cloth.

390
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,020
Miss, have a look at the cloth.

391
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:57,740
Look at the material.

392
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,180
The winter is so long in Jiuyi Mountain.

393
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,660
It's perfect for you to pick one for your master.

394
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,020
Princess,

395
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,300
you've bought a lot of things for your master

396
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,940
since you came out for half a day.

397
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,300
Are you here to meet me

398
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,860
or to buy a gift for your master?

399
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:17,940
I came out for so long,

400
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,300
but I forgot the rice cake.

401
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,540
But my master's gift is not finished yet.

402
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,660
How about we meet another day?

403
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,100
Here.

404
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,540
Sir, this...

405
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,140
No need to look for it.

406
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,380
Thank you, sir.

407
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,220
Princess, you're mistaken.

408
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,220
You're so attentive to your master.

409
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,700
It shows that you're a person of great affection.

410
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,020
It's my honor to be close to you.

411
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,180
You can buy as much as you want.

412
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,820
I also want to respect his old age.

413
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,100
My master is not old.

414
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,860
He's much better than you.

415
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,540
Actually, I'm mad at him

416
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,260
for traveling around the world.

417
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,220
I have no plan to get married in the past three or five years.

418
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:01,620
Goodbye.

419
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,620
It's okay.

420
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,060
I can wait.

421
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,180
Because you deserve it.

422
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,580
We've only been together for a day.

423
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,580
How do you know if I deserve it?

424
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:17,100
Who doesn't know that the Princess Zhuyan of Tianjifeng City

425
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,980
is known as the most valuable lotus

426
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:23,140
in the grasslands.

427
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,620
I think

428
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:28,780
it's not appropriate to describe a person as valuable as a lotus.

429
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,260
I'm sorry.

430
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,780
I mean,

431
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,180
you're the only daughter of the West Emperor's leader, Prince Chi.

432
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,820
Of course, you're more noble than others.

433
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,740
Everyone is equal.

434
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,580
Who is more noble than others?

435
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,220
The book says that everyone is equal.

436
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,300
How can you compare with them

437
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,420
and these people?

438
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,900
You and I were born with the Golden Soup Stone.

439
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,220
We were born to be more noble than others.

440
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,580
If I'm not the daughter of Prince Chi,

441
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,700
would you still look at me differently?

442
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,980
But you're already the daughter of Prince Chi.

443
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,500
When we get married,

444
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:02,060
our children will be the most valuable

445
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,140
in the whole West Emperor,

446
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,380
whether it's blood or wealth.

447
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,900
But I don't like you.

448
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,940
I already have someone in mind.

449
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,220
Who doesn't know that

450
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,820
the Princess just came back from Mount Jiuyi to cultivate.

451
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,940
Mount Jiuyi is a place where the cultivators of the Qingxing and Guayu are all here.

452
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,900
How can you meet someone you like?

453
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:22,860
You...

454
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,140
He's my one-sided lover.

455
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,500
Princess.

456
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:31,740
A Yan.

457
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:37,860
You mean him?

458
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,100
Impossible.

459
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,820
A low-ranking person like him

460
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,340
is not worthy of you.

461
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,220
You...

462
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,500
Low-ranking person?

463
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,260
He's not even a person.

464
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,420
How can you say that?

465
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,220
He's just a few beautiful things.

466
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,180
What's wrong with a low-ranking person?

467
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,620
A low-ranking person is also a person.

468
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,340
It's because there are people like you

469
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,380
that the differences between the two tribes won't be eliminated.

470
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,740
I'm telling you.

471
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,340
A Yan is my one-sided lover.

472
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,180
A low-ranking person?

473
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,300
In my opinion,

474
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,140
he's more noble than

475
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,100
a low-ranking person like you.

476
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,620
No wonder he evenless deserves the title of sake.

477
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,340
So what if I un missile him.

478
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:21,620
In my opinion,

479
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,900
an un Cupid is much more noble

480
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,780
than a low-ranking person like you.

481
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,700
The princess and doctor

482
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,100
were really with him.

483
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,180
I'm telling you.

484
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:41,020
Because I seen his whole life

485
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:43,220
similar to these two tribes on the Personally Seored liking.

486
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,780
I just don't want anything to do with him.

487
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,060
I let you go because of the relationship between Prince of Chiyin.

488
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,420
Stop fooling around.

489
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:49,940
Apologize to me now.

490
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,580
I'll pretend nothing happened.

491
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,580
You should apologize to me.

492
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,980
Yuan, tell him

493
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,140
how much you like me.

494
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,180
You know that

495
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:03,180
you're the one I care about most in my life.

496
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,860
Good!

497
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:06,980
Good!

498
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,260
Good!

499
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,100
Good!

500
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,660
Go away!

501
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,820
Don't ever let me see you again!

502
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:15,940
Go away!

503
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,100
Your Highness,

504
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,700
although I know

505
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:23,900
the scene you played

506
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,340
was to make the young master angry,

507
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,300
I'm afraid it'll ruin your reputation.

508
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,460
It's fine.

509
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,860
I don't want to marry anyway.

510
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,620
It's better not to marry for the rest of my life.

511
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,140
All right.

512
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,340
Take me to eat something delicious.

513
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,540
Yanfeng Restaurant is ahead.

514
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,260
Let's go.

515
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,540
What's delicious today?

516
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,020
Yuan,

517
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,460
do you know how many

518
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,860
blind dates my parents have arranged for me recently?

519
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,460
Eleven!

520
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,340
I'm so tired.

521
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,020
They must have introduced you

522
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,740
to a lot of people.

523
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,540
Even if you marry them,

524
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,100
they won't dare to bully you.

525
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,340
Of course I know

526
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,100
they're doing this for my own good.

527
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,300
I have to be able to get along with them.

528
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,260
Let's say the man who was the first wife of the West Emperor.

529
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,780
He's so generous.

530
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,500
In fact,

531
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,060
he's just taking advantage of his money

532
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,340
and looking down on others.

533
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,260
He even dares to humiliate you in public.

534
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,100
In my opinion,

535
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,260
he can't even compare to your finger.

536
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,380
You've been living with me since childhood.

537
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,020
You naturally think I'm good in every way.

538
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,740
Of course not.

539
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,820
In terms of appearance,

540
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,340
for example, Tianji City,

541
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,660
there are only a few men

542
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,700
in the whole West Emperor who are as handsome as you.

543
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,260
In terms of character,

544
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,300
how many people in the world

545
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,420
are as gentle and considerate as you?

546
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,020
In terms of knowledge,

547
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,340
you have a lot of experience.

548
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,340
From childhood to adulthood,

549
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,380
there's nothing that can beat you.

550
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:54,980
All right, Princess.

551
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,420
Don't say anymore.

552
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:57,740
Let's eat.

553
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,380
Here.

554
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,300
Yuan,

555
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,700
I'm curious.

556
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,540
What kind of woman

557
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,780
would a perfect person like you like?

558
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,100
Yuan,

559
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,300
I know that a perfect person

560
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,780
can only be gender-divided

561
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,460
after falling in love with someone.

562
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,500
What kind of woman

563
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,060
do you like?

564
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,940
She's very beautiful, right?

565
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,380
Did you two get together in the end?

566
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:32,980
Yuan.

567
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:38,500
Yes.

568
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:41,940
She's beautiful.

569
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,300
I love her very much.

570
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:49,020
A perfect person can only love one person in his or her life.

571
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,740
I only love her.

572
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,980
For hundreds of years,

573
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,540
I only loved her.

574
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,580
How touching.

575
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,100
Then,

576
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:04,380
what does it feel to fall in love with someone?

577
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,700
How did you know it was her?

578
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,420
You will be happy because of her,

579
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,380
and worry because of her.

580
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,260
Because she's by your side,

581
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,300
you'll find everything interesting.

582
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,140
Thank you, Minister Shao.

583
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,420
You'll feel very relaxed

584
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,700
when you're with her.

585
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,420
Sometimes, you don't even need to say anything

586
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,940
and you can be with her.

587
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:53,860
You and Master

588
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,580
also liked this instrument.

589
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,140
You even gave me the same name.

590
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,980
You don't want to leave her

591
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,900
and protect her at all times.

592
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,820
You don't want her to be hurt at all.

593
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,100
You don't want her to be hurt at all.

594
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,420
Master.

595
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:20,700
Do I like Master?

596
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:22,860
Impossible.

597
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,300
Zhu Yan, Zhu Yan.

598
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,420
Master is not a human.

599
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,540
You can't use this feeling to poison him.

600
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,060
You can't even imagine it.

601
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,260
Is this love?

602
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,300
I mean,

603
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,420
it's nothing special.

604
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,620
If that's the case,

605
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,220
I like Yuan, too.

606
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:44,900
Look,

607
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,180
I don't like vegetables since I was a kid.

608
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,900
But Yuan asked me to eat it,

609
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,180
so I ate it.

610
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,460
Besides,

611
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,260
it's the most relaxed and comfortable

612
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,660
when I'm with Yuan.

613
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,260
Sometimes, I don't even need to say anything

614
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,900
and Yuan knows it.

615
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:01,460
Besides,

616
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,140
I want to protect Yuan.

617
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,180
You'll be happy because of her

618
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,300
and worry about her.

619
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,580
Because she's by your side,

620
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,020
you'll find everything interesting.

621
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,860
You'll feel relaxed when you're with her.

622
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,180
You don't need to say anything

623
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,940
and you'll feel the same as her.

624
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,460
You don't want to leave her at all.

625
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,580
Besides, you want to protect her.

626
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,180
You don't want her to be hurt at all.

627
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,100
Yuan.

628
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,500
Your Highness,

629
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,300
we should go back.

630
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:54,940
But...

631
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,700
We haven't eaten anything yet.

632
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,260
coming.

633
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,140
Such a IKEA room.

634
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:05,260
You think I don't want to live here?

635
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,020
You stay here,

636
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,660
but should leave me talk with you.

637
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,180
Tell me.

638
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,260
These are the lights I forgot to send you.

639
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,140
It seems there's no way I can ph 있잖아요.

640
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:19,620
Ignore them.

641
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,140
world when you left,

642
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,340
you didn't notice anything until now?

643
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:26,660
What's the matter?

644
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,820
Tian Ji Gang is in가리워 vertices

That's love.

655
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:05,460
One day, it will be a dream.

656
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,500
Master,

657
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,180
what are you doing now?

658
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,220
I miss you so much.

659
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,500
Master,

660
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,900
I miss you so much.

I miss you so much.

662
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:32,900
I miss you so much.

00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,900
I miss you so much.

664
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,900
I miss you so much.

665
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:35,900
I miss you so much.

666
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:36,900
I miss you so much.

667
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:37,900
I miss you so much.

668
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:38,900
I miss you so much.

669
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,900
I miss you so much.

670
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,900
I miss you so much.

671
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,900
I miss you so much.

672
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,900
I miss you so much.

673
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:43,900
I miss you so much.

674
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:44,900
I miss you so much.

675
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,900
I miss you so much.

676
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:46,900
I miss you so much.

677
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,900
I miss you so much.

I miss you so much.

690
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,100
I miss you so much.

691
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,100
I miss you so much.

692
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,100
I miss you so much.

693
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,100
I miss you so much.

694
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,100
I miss you so much.

695
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,100
I miss you so much.

696
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,100
I miss you so much.

697
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,100
I miss you so much.

698
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,100
I miss you so much.

699
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,100
I miss you so much.

700
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,100
I miss you so much.

701
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,100
I miss you so much.

702
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,100
I miss you so much.

703
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,100
I miss you so much.

704
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,100
I miss you so much.

705
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,100
I miss you so much.

706
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,100
I miss you so much.

707
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,100
I miss you so much.

708
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,100
I miss you so much.

709
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,100
I miss you so much.

710
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,100
I miss you so much.

711
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,100
I miss you so much.

712
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,100
I miss you so much.

713
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,100
When you practice,

714
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,500
you must calm your mind.

715
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,100
The spiritual barrier

716
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,500
is neither heavy nor light.

717
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,700
It's neither narrow nor narrow.

718
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,500
If there are too many noises,

719
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,700
the barrier can be turned back.

720
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,300
If there are too many images,

721
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,500
the barrier can be blocked from the outside.

722
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,300
The so-called too many noises

723
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,500
have no image.

724
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,900
Everything is too dark

725
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,100
and nothing can be helped.

726
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,900
The barrier is too dark

727
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,100
and nothing can be helped.

728
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,300
The barrier is too dark

729
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,500
and nothing can be helped.

730
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:51,900
The barrier is too dark

731
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,900
and nothing can be helped.

732
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,100
What is this place?

733
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,500
Why am I here?

734
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,700
Is anyone here?

735
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,700
Is anyone here?

736
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,700
What kind of monster are you?

737
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,700
What kind of monster are you?

738
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,100
I'm Zhu Yan.

739
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,900
I'm Zhu Yan.

740
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,100
Impossible.

741
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,100
How could I hear her voice?

742
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,100
There has never been a noise

743
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,300
that has crossed my spiritual barrier.

744
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,700
It's strange.

745
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,100
Why didn't I respond

746
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,500
when I called my name?

747
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,700
Could it be that my name

748
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,500
was eaten

749
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,300
by this white hair?

750
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,500
It was eaten.

751
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,900
Who are you?

752
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,300
Do you like me so much?

753
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,300
Do you like me so much?

754
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,100
Yue Gu, Yue Gu.

755
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,900
Why did you become

756
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,700
brighter than usual?

757
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,700
I'm not a human.

758
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,300
I'm a monster.

759
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,900
I'm a monster.

760
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,700
I'm a monster.

761
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,100
What is this place?

762
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,900
The ground is like a mirror.

763
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,700
It's amazing.

764
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,500
I must write a letter

765
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,900
to tell my master.

766
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,700
If my master

767
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,100
can do it himself now, it will be great.

768
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,300
I...

769
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,100
Master.

770
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,100
Master.

771
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,100
Is it really you?

772
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,500
This place is so clear, master.

773
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,900
Master.

774
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,300
I miss you so much.

775
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,100
I miss you.

776
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,700
I really miss you so much, master.

777
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,380
You really

778
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,300
miss me so much?

779
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:19,900
Master.

780
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:21,900
Want to work more?

781
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,500
Huai Yi.

782
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,900
How did you get the warmth.

783
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:42,940
епы

784
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:44,060
iced

785
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,380
Are you Master's hand 되지 ?

786
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,140
What happened to Jiuying ?

787
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,900
It's just the scent of a fairy.

788
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:16,980
Over a Har bowl of?".

789
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:22,900
I've come taht one which used to be part of its garden

790
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:26,740
could become a fairy now before I can focus on the garden

791
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,500
there I'll find what I need.

792
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:32,300
Then I can sit in its sacrum

793
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,300
to rest in peace.

794
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:36,980
I architectural design

795
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:39,580
was indeed proven by this baptizing benefit.

796
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,820
the moon is fair in my heart.

797
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:08,580
The light in my Public View

798
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:11,580
The snow is falling, the flowers are blooming.

799
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,580
Xu Yuan Shu,

800
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:15,580
you made me see my master.

801
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:19,580
The morning dew is falling, the flowers are blooming.

802
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:23,580
The life is like a dream.

803
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:27,580
Is it because you are Xu Yuan Shu?

804
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:30,580
The flowers are blooming, the flowers are blooming.

you are really like my master.

810
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:51,580
When my master is serious about thinking about problems,

811
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:54,580
he is also frowning.

812
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:58,580
The moon is shining.

813
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:03,580

817
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:06,580
How can I be willing to

818
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:10,580
be in the shadow of the moon?

819
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:16,580
Why am I always by your side?

820
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:21,580
I want to be with you.

821
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:26,580
You dare not to be my friend.

822
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:31,580
I will be your star.

00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:41,580
The heart is with you.

00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:46,580
You can be my star.

826
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:51,580
